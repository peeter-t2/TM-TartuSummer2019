12.442	On January 4, 1934,
16.513	a young man delivered a report
19.529	to the United States Congress
21.914	that 80 years on,
23.868	still shapes the lives of
23.868	everyone in this room today,
28.528	still shapes the lives of
28.528	everyone on this planet.
34.222	That young man wasn't a politician,
37.102	he wasn't a businessman,
39.101	a civil rights activist
40.438	or a faith leader.
42.213	He was that most unlikely of heroes,
45.484	an economist.
49.007	His name was Simon Kuznets
51.552	and the report that 
51.552	he delivered was called
54.696	"""National Income, 1929-1932."""
59.148	Now, you might think
60.632	this is a rather dry and dull report.
63.723	And you're absolutely right.
65.805	It's dry as a bone.
68.26	But this report is the foundation
70.57	of how, today, we judge the 
70.57	success of countries:
73.503	what we know best as
73.503	Gross Domestic Product,
77.052	GDP.
79.363	GDP has defined and shaped our lives
82.266	for the last 80 years.
84.864	And today I want to talk about 
86.681	a different way to measure
86.681	the success of countries,
90.52	a different way to define 
90.52	and shape our lives
93.669	for the next 80 years.
96.926	But first, we have to understand
98.817	how GDP came to
98.817	dominate our lives.
102.726	Kuznets' report was delivered
104.986	at a moment of crisis.
106.708	The U.S. economy was plummeting
108.734	into the Great Depression
110.349	and policy makers were 
110.349	struggling to respond.
113.434	Struggling because they didn't
113.434	know what was going on.
116.579	They didn't have data and statistics.
119.961	So what Kuznet's report gave them
122.783	was reliable data on what 
122.783	the U.S. economy
126.061	was producing,
127.196	updated year by year.
130.264	And armed with this information,
132.604	policy makers were, eventually,
134.612	able to find a way out 
134.612	of the slump.
138.04	And because Kuznets' invention
139.922	was found to be so useful,
141.694	it spread around the world.
143.382	And now today, every country
145.851	produces GDP statistics.
148.815	But, in that first report,
151.922	Kuznets himself delivered a warning.
155.466	It's in the introductory chapter.
157.447	On page seven he says,
159.481	"""The welfare of a nation can, therefore,"
162.11	scarcely be inferred
163.664	from a measurement of 
163.664	national income
165.664	"as defined above."""
167.601	It's not the greatest sound 
167.601	bite in the world,
170.969	and it's dressed up in the cautious 
170.969	language of the economist.
174.598	But his message was clear:
176.774	GDP is a tool
178.508	to help us measure
178.508	economic performance.
181.566	It's not a measure
181.566	of our well-being.
184.534	And it shouldn't be a guide 
184.534	to all decision making.
189.351	But we have ignored Kuznets' warning.
192.221	We live in a world where
193.777	GDP is the benchmark of success
196.9	in a global economy.
199.177	Our politicians boast when
199.177	GDP goes up.
202.406	Markets move
203.69	and trillions of dollars of capital
205.564	move around the world
206.988	based on which countries
206.988	are going up
208.739	and which countries 
208.739	are going down,
210.58	all measured in GDP.
213.204	Our societies have become
214.533	engines to create more GDP.
218.908	But we know that GDP is flawed.
222.443	It ignores the environment.
224.973	It counts bombs and prisons as progress.
228.629	It can't count happiness or community.
231.878	And it has nothing to say 
231.878	about fairness or justice.
236.621	Is it any surprise that our world,
239.324	marching to the drumbeat of GDP,
242.155	is teetering on the brink
242.155	of environmental disaster
245.432	and filled with anger and conflict?
248.938	We need a better way
248.938	to measure our societies,
253.341	a measure based on the real 
253.341	things that matter to real people.
258.724	Do I have enough to eat?
260.686	Can I read and write?
262.762	Am I safe?
264.5	Do I have rights?
266.655	Do I live in a society where
266.655	I'm not discriminated against?
269.784	Is my future and the future of my children 
269.784	prevented from environmental destruction?
276.222	These are questions that GDP
278.113	does not and cannot answer.
283.016	There have, of course,
284.535	been efforts in the past
285.921	to move beyond GDP.
288.563	But I believe that we're living
289.938	in a moment when we
291.212	are ready for a measurement revolution.
294.952	We're ready because we've seen,
297.628	in the financial crisis of 2008,
299.862	how our fetish for economic growth
302.681	led us so far astray.
304.712	We've seen, in the Arab Spring,
307.096	how countries like Tunisia
308.941	were supposedly economic superstars,
311.691	but they were societies
313.216	that were seething with discontentment.
316.495	We're ready, because today
316.495	we have the technology
320.183	to gather and analyze data
322.498	in ways that would have been
322.498	unimaginable to Kuznets.
326.545	Today, I'd like to introduce you 
326.545	to the Social Progress Index.
331.428	It's a measure of the 
331.428	well-being of society,
334.155	completely separate from GDP.
336.912	It's a whole new way
336.912	of looking at the world.
340.569	The Social Progress Index
342.179	begins by defining what it
343.502	means to be a good society
345.449	based around three dimensions.
348.94	The first is, does everyone have
348.94	the basic needs for survival:
353.035	food, water, shelter, safety?
355.885	Secondly, does everyone have
358.605	access to the building blocks 
358.605	to improve their lives:
361.436	education, information, health
361.436	and sustainable environment?
365.948	And then third, does every 
365.948	individual have access
369.632	to a chance to pursue their goals
372.412	and dreams and ambitions
374.26	free from obstacles?
375.417	Do they have rights,
376.964	freedom of choice,
378.353	freedom from discrimination
379.875	and access to the the world's
379.875	most advanced knowledge?
383.336	Together, these 12 components
386.7	form the Social Progress framework.
390.035	And for each of these 12 components,
392.123	we have indicators to measure 
392.123	how countries are performing.
395.554	Not indicators of effort or intention,
398.683	but real achievement.
400.931	We don't measure how much
400.931	a country spends on healthcare,
404.133	we measure the length and 
404.133	quality of people's lives.
408.446	We don't measure whether governments
408.446	pass laws against discrimination,
413.045	we measure whether people 
413.045	experience discrimination.
417.475	But what you want to know
418.835	is who's top, don't you?
418.835	(Laughter)
421.851	I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.
423.668	Okay, I'm going to show you.
425.194	I'm going to show you on this chart.
427.59	So here we are,
428.934	what I've done here is put on the 
428.934	vertical axis social progress.
433.146	Higher is better.
434.481	And then, just for comparison,
436.503	just for fun,
437.825	on the horizontal axis
437.825	is GDP per capita.
441.693	Further to the right is more.
443.583	So the country in the world
446.737	with the highest social progress,
450.127	the number one country on social progress
453.486	is New Zealand.
456.882	(Applause)
460.398	Well done! Never been; must go.
463.215	(Laughter)
465.537	The country with the least social progress,
468.399	I'm sorry to say, is Chad.
470.716	I've never been; maybe next year.
473.638	(Laughter)
475.447	Or maybe the year after.
477.639	Now, I know what you're thinking.
479.212	"You're thinking, ""Aha,"
480.592	but New Zealand has a higher GDP
482.988	"than Chad!"""
484.85	It's a good point, well made.
487.344	But let me show you
488.806	two other countries.
490.069	Here's the United States —
492.495	considerably richer than New Zealand,
495.242	but with a lower level of social progress.
497.688	And then here's Senegal —
500.34	it's got a higher level of 
500.34	social progress than Chad,
504.337	but the same level of GDP.
506.286	So what's going on? Well, look.
508.035	Let me bring in the rest of 
508.035	the countries of the world,
510.536	the 132 we've been able to measure,
512.744	each one represented by a dot.
515.082	There we go. Lots of dots.
516.581	Now, obviously I can't do all of them,
518.323	so a few highlights for you:
520.056	The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.
524.876	My country, the United Kingdom,
526.98	is sort of middling, sort of dull,
529.697	but who cares —
531.062	at least we beat the French.
533.24	(Laughter)
540.737	And then looking at the 
540.737	emerging economies,
543.004	top of the BRICS, 
543.004	pleased to say, is Brazil.
546.338	(Applause)
548.044	Come on, cheer!
549.831	Go, Brazil!
551.773	Beating South Africa,
553.306	then Russia,
554.599	then China
555.733	and then India.
557.307	Tucked away on the right-hand side,
559.672	you will see a dot of a 
559.672	country with a lot of GDP
563.025	but not a huge amount 
563.025	of social progress —
564.968	that's Kuwait.
566.946	Just above Brazil
568.637	is a social progress superpower —
570.956	that's Costa Rica.
572.456	It's got a level of social progress the same 
572.456	as some Western European countries,
576.431	with a much lower GDP.
578.4	Now, my slide is getting 
578.4	a little cluttered
580.682	and I'd like to step back a bit.
582.364	So let me take away these countries,
583.818	and then pop in the regression line.
586.732	So this shows the average relationship
588.385	between GDP and social progress.
590.896	The first thing to notice,
593.138	is that there's lots of noise
594.993	around the trend line.
596.69	And what this shows,
598.275	what this empirically demonstrates,
601.157	is that GDP is not destiny.
604.192	At every level of GDP per capita,
607.395	there are opportunities
607.395	for more social progress,
610.593	risks of less.
612.596	The second thing to notice
614.056	is that for poor countries,
616.559	the curve is really steep.
618.532	So what this tells us is that
619.807	if poor countries can get
621.06	a little bit of extra GDP,
622.954	and if they reinvest that
624.737	in doctors, nurses, water supplies,
627.409	sanitation, etc.,
628.782	there's a lot of social progress bang
630.801	for your GDP buck.
632.387	And that's good news, and that's what 
632.387	we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,
635.962	with a lot of people lifted out of poverty
637.963	by economic growth and good policies
640.173	in poorer countries.
642.045	But go on a bit further up the curve,
644.242	and then we see it flattening out.
646.351	Each extra dollar of GDP
648.603	is buying less and less social progress.
651.839	And with more and more
651.839	of the world's population
654.513	living on this part of the curve,
657.076	it means GDP is becoming
659.3	less and less useful
661.084	as a guide to our development.
663.6	I'll show you an example of Brazil.
665.747	Here's Brazil:
666.97	social progress of about 70 out of 100,
669.841	GDP per capita about 
672.335	And look, Brazil's above the line.
675.256	Brazil is doing a reasonably good job
677.142	of turning GDP into social progress.
680.467	But where does Brazil go next?
682.454	Let's say that Brazil
683.966	adopts a bold economic plan
685.738	to double GDP in the next decade.
688.041	But that is only half a plan.
691.657	It's less than half a plan,
693.934	because where does Brazil
693.934	want to go on social progress?
697.186	Brazil, it's possible
699.504	to increase your growth,
701.239	increase your GDP,
702.816	while stagnating or going backwards
704.706	on social progress.
706.055	We don't want Brazil
707.241	to become like Russia.
708.973	What you really want is for Brazil
711.288	to get ever more efficient at creating 
711.288	social progress from its GDP,
716.241	so it becomes more like New Zealand.
718.539	And what that means is that
720.119	Brazil needs to prioritize social progress
722.776	in its development plan
724.468	and see that it's not just growth alone,
726.88	it's growth with social progress.
729.532	And that's what the Social 
729.532	Progress Index does:
732.15	It reframes the debate about development,
734.76	not just about GDP alone,
736.82	but inclusive, sustainable growth
739.399	that brings real improvements 
739.399	in people's lives.
743.818	And it's not just about countries.
746.394	Earlier this year,
749.184	with our friends from the Imazon 
749.184	nonprofit here in Brazil,
753.751	we launched the first subnational 
753.751	Social Progress Index.
758.408	We did it for the Amazon region.
760.868	It's an area the size of 
760.868	Europe, 24 million people,
764.656	one of the most deprived 
764.656	parts of the country.
767.084	And here are the results,
768.994	and this is broken down
770.629	into nearly 800 different municipalities.
774.133	And with this detailed information
775.816	about the real quality of life
778.034	in this part of the country,
779.977	Imazon and other partners
781.957	from government, 
781.957	business and civil society
784.286	can work together to construct
786	a development plan
787.677	that will help really improve
787.677	people's lives,
790.014	while protecting that 
790.014	precious global asset
793.25	that is the Amazon Rainforest.
796.221	And this is just the beginning,
798.122	You can create a Social Progress Index
800.501	for any state, region, 
800.501	city or municipality.
805.656	We all know and love TEDx;
807.729	this is Social Pogress-x.
809.971	This is a tool for anyone to come and use.
813.165	Contrary to the way we 
813.165	sometimes talk about it,
816.045	GDP was not handed down from 
816.045	God on tablets of stone. (Laughter)
822.365	It's a measurement tool
822.365	invented in the 20th century
826.36	to address the challenges
826.36	of the 20th century.
831.152	In the 21st century,
833.004	we face new challenges:
835.456	aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.
838.564	To face those challenges,
840.223	we need new tools of measurement,
842.243	new ways of valuing progress.
845.997	Imagine if we could measure
848.395	what nonprofits, charities,
850.925	volunteers, civil society organizations
852.894	really contribute to our society.
856.7	Imagine if businesses competed
859.768	not just on the basis of
859.768	their economic contribution,
863.179	but on their contribution 
863.179	to social progress.
867.003	Imagine if we could hold 
867.003	politicians to account
870.95	for really improving people's lives.
875.146	Imagine if we could work together —
878.131	government, business, 
878.131	civil society, me, you —
883.199	and make this century the 
883.199	century of social progress.
888.704	Thank you.
889.783	(Applause)
