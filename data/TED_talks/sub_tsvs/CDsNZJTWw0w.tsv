13.252	Looking deeply inside nature,
15.982	through the magnifying glass of science,
19.095	designers extract principles,
19.095	processes and materials
22.7	that are forming the very basis
22.7	of design methodology.
27.252	From synthetic constructs
27.252	that resemble biological materials,
32.352	to computational methods
32.352	that emulate neural processes,
35.743	nature is driving design.
39.398	Design is also driving nature.
42.128	In realms of genetics, regenerative
42.128	medicine and synthetic biology,
45.887	designers are growing novel technologies,
48.616	not foreseen or anticipated by nature.
53.14	Bionics explores the interplay
53.14	between biology and design.
59.107	As you can see, my legs are bionic.
62.99	Today, I will tell human stories
62.99	of bionic integration;
68.538	how electromechanics attached
68.538	to the body, and implanted inside the body
74.261	are beginning to bridge the gap
74.261	between disability and ability,
78.999	between human limitation
78.999	and human potential.
84.681	Bionics has defined my physicality.
88.228	In 1982, both of my legs were amputated
90.704	due to tissue damage from frostbite,
92.832	incurred during
92.832	a mountain-climbing accident.
95.95	At that time, I didn't
95.95	view my body as broken.
100.417	I reasoned that a human being
100.417	"can never be ""broken."""
105.655	Technology is broken.
108.409	Technology is inadequate.
111.638	This simple but powerful idea
111.638	was a call to arms,
116.12	to advance technology
116.12	for the elimination of my own disability,
120.651	and ultimately, the disability of others.
124.46	I began by developing specialized limbs
127.442	that allowed me to return
127.442	to the vertical world
129.927	of rock and ice climbing.
131.418	I quickly realized that the artificial
131.418	part of my body is malleable;
136.06	able to take on any form, any function --
140.434	a blank slate for which to create,
143.397	perhaps, structures that could extend
143.397	beyond biological capability.
149.391	I made my height adjustable.
150.765	I could be as short as five feet
150.765	or as tall as I'd like.
153.469	(Laughter)
155.922	So when I was feeling bad about myself,
159.296	insecure, I would jack my height up.
161.157	(Laughter)
163.062	But when I was feeling
163.062	confident and suave,
165.283	I would knock my height down a notch,
165.283	just to give the competition a chance.
169.076	(Laughter)
171.195	(Applause)
173.322	Narrow-edged feet allowed me
173.322	to climb steep rock fissures,
176.615	where the human foot cannot penetrate,
179.241	and spiked feet enabled me
179.241	to climb vertical ice walls,
183.447	without ever experiencing
183.447	muscle leg fatigue.
187.399	Through technological innovation,
189.613	I returned to my sport,
189.613	stronger and better.
192.478	Technology had eliminated my disability,
195.085	and allowed me a new climbing prowess.
197.451	As a young man, I imagined a future world
197.451	where technology so advanced
201.038	could rid the world of disability,
202.844	a world in which neural
202.844	implants would allow
204.964	the visually impaired to see.
207.026	A world in which the paralyzed
207.026	could walk, via body exoskeletons.
212.645	Sadly, because of
212.645	deficiencies in technology,
215.447	disability is rampant in the world.
217.205	This gentleman is missing three limbs.
219.903	As a testimony to current technology,
219.903	he is out of the wheelchair,
223.75	but we need to do a better job in bionics,
223.75	to allow, one day, full rehabilitation
229.695	for a person with this level of injury.
233.876	At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
233.876	the Center for Extreme Bionics.
237.479	The mission of the center
237.479	is to put forth fundamental science
242.051	and technological capability
243.911	that will allow the biomechatronic
243.911	and regenerative repair of humans,
247.682	across a broad range
247.682	of brain and body disabilities.
253.707	Today, I'm going to tell you
253.707	how my legs function, how they work,
257.468	as a case in point for this center.
260.77	Now, I made sure to shave
260.77	my legs last night,
262.921	because I knew I'd be showing them off.
264.892	(Laughter)
266.365	Bionics entails the engineering
266.365	of extreme interfaces.
269.619	There's three extreme
269.619	interfaces in my bionic limbs:
272.515	mechanical, how my limbs
272.515	are attached to my biological body;
276.619	dynamic, how they move
276.619	like flesh and bone;
279.942	and electrical, how they communicate
279.942	with my nervous system.
282.856	I'll begin with mechanical interface.
285.904	In the area of design,
285.904	we still do not understand
289.071	how to attach devices
289.071	to the body mechanically.
293.185	It's extraordinary to me
293.185	that in this day and age,
296.352	one of the most mature,
296.352	oldest technologies
298.701	in the human timeline, the shoe,
298.701	still gives us blisters.
303.121	How can this be?
304.602	We have no idea how to attach
304.602	things to our bodies.
308.364	This is the beautifully
308.364	lyrical design work
311.293	of Professor Neri Oxman
311.293	at the MIT Media Lab,
313.738	showing spatially varying
313.738	exoskeletal impedances,
317.186	shown here by color variation
317.186	in this 3D-printed model.
321.811	Imagine a future where clothing
321.811	is stiff and soft where you need it,
326.359	when you need it, for optimal
326.359	support and flexibility,
329.913	without ever causing discomfort.
332.112	My bionic limbs are attached
332.112	to my biological body
335.558	via synthetic skins
335.558	with stiffness variations,
339.644	that mirror my underlying
339.644	tissue biomechanics.
344.359	To achieve that mirroring, we first
344.359	developed a mathematical model
347.557	of my biological limb.
349.129	To that end, we used
349.129	imaging tools such as MRI,
352.435	to look inside my body,
354.023	to figure out the geometries
354.023	and locations of various tissues.
357.752	We also took robotic tools --
359.163	here's a 14-actuator circle
359.163	that goes around the biological limb.
364.891	The actuators come in,
364.891	find the surface of the limb,
367.463	measure its unloaded shape,
369.732	and then they push on the tissues
371.407	to measure tissue compliances
371.407	at each anatomical point.
375.542	We combine these imaging and robotic data
377.813	to build a mathematical description
377.813	of my biological limb, shown on the left.
381.479	You see a bunch of points, or nodes?
383.257	At each node, there's a color
383.257	that represents tissue compliance.
386.431	We then do a mathematical transformation
386.431	to the design of the synthetic skin,
390.397	shown on the right.
392.088	And we've discovered optimality is:
394.516	where the body is stiff,
394.516	the synthetic skin should be soft,
397.397	where the body is soft,
397.397	the synthetic skin is stiff,
400.881	and this mirroring occurs
400.881	across all tissue compliances.
404.72	With this framework,
404.72	we've produced bionic limbs
407.505	that are the most comfortable
407.505	limbs I've ever worn.
411.077	Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
411.077	our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,
417.19	will no longer be designed
417.19	and manufactured using artisan strategies,
420.87	but rather, data-driven
420.87	quantitative frameworks.
424.098	In that future, our shoes
424.098	will no longer give us blisters.
429.04	We're also embedding
429.04	sensing and smart materials
431.961	into the synthetic skins.
433.556	This is a material developed
433.556	by SRI International, California.
438.048	Under electrostatic effect,
438.048	it changes stiffness.
441.349	So under zero voltage,
441.349	the material is compliant,
444.698	it's floppy like paper.
446.096	Then the button's pushed,
446.096	a voltage is applied,
448.588	and it becomes stiff as a board.
450.604	(Tapping sounds)
453.666	We embed this material
453.666	into the synthetic skin
456.338	that attaches my bionic limb
456.338	to my biological body.
459.888	When I walk here, it's no voltage.
462.342	My interface is soft and compliant.
464.423	The button's pushed,
464.423	voltage is applied, and it stiffens,
467.438	offering me a greater maneuverability
467.438	over the bionic limb.
470.915	We're also building exoskeletons.
473.327	This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft
475.607	in just the right areas
475.607	of the running cycle,
478.569	to protect the biological joints
478.569	from high impacts and degradation.
482.847	In the future, we'll all
482.847	be wearing exoskeletons
485.657	in common activities, such as running.
488.966	Next, dynamic interface.
490.474	How do my bionic limbs
490.474	move like flesh and bone?
493.799	At my MIT lab, we study how humans
493.799	with normal physiologies
497.808	stand, walk and run.
499.338	What are the muscles doing,
500.753	and how are they controlled
500.753	by the spinal cord?
503.697	This basic science
503.697	motivates what we build.
506.166	We're building bionic ankles,
506.166	knees and hips.
508.528	We're building body parts
508.528	from the ground up.
511.854	The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
511.854	are called BiOMs.
515.041	They've been fitted
515.041	to nearly 1,000 patients,
	wounded U.S. soldiers.
522.005	How does it work?
523.187	At heel strike, under computer control,
525.226	the system controls stiffness,
527.226	to attenuate the shock
527.226	of the limb hitting the ground.
530.287	Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
530.287	outputs high torques and powers
534.407	to lift the person
534.407	into the walking stride,
536.786	comparable to how muscles
536.786	work in the calf region.
541.096	This bionic propulsion is very important
541.096	clinically to patients.
544.85	So on the left, you see
544.85	the bionic device worn by a lady,
547.928	on the right, a passive device
547.928	worn by the same lady,
550.887	that fails to emulate
550.887	normal muscle function,
553.737	enabling her to do something
553.737	everyone should be able to do:
557.439	go up and down their steps at home.
559.634	Bionics also allows
559.634	for extraordinary athletic feats.
563.149	Here's a gentleman running
563.149	up a rocky pathway.
567.784	This is Steve Martin --
567.784	not the comedian --
570.633	who lost his legs in a bomb blast
570.633	in Afghanistan.
574.327	We're also building exoskeletal
574.327	structures using these same principles,
579.218	that wrap around the biological limb.
582.311	This gentleman does not have
582.311	any leg condition, any disability.
587.922	He has a normal physiology,
589.826	so these exoskeletons are applying
589.826	muscle-like torques and powers,
594.419	so that his own muscles need not
594.419	apply those torques and powers.
599.079	This is the first exoskeleton in history
599.079	that actually augments human walking.
604.501	It significantly reduces metabolic cost.
607.668	It's so profound in its augmentation,
610.406	that when a normal, healthy person
610.406	wears the device for 40 minutes
613.579	and then takes it off,
615.302	their own biological legs feel
615.302	ridiculously heavy and awkward.
620.039	We're beginning the age in which
620.039	machines attached to our bodies
623.474	will make us stronger
623.474	and faster and more efficient.
627.699	Moving on to electrical interface:
629.47	How do my bionic limbs communicate
629.47	with my nervous system?
632.651	Across my residual limb are electrodes
634.517	that measure the electrical
634.517	pulse of my muscles.
637.286	That's communicated to the bionic limb,
639.229	so when I think about moving
639.229	my phantom limb,
642.306	the robot tracks those movement desires.
646.02	This diagram shows fundamentally
646.02	how the bionic limb is controlled.
650.67	So we model the missing biological limb,
653.099	and we've discovered
653.099	what reflexes occurred,
655.937	how the reflexes of the spinal cord
655.937	are controlling the muscles.
659.302	And that capability is embedded
659.302	in the chips of the bionic limb.
665.009	What we've done, then, is we modulate
665.009	the sensitivity of the reflex,
668.993	the modeled spinal reflex,
668.993	with the neural signal,
672.112	so when I relax my muscles
672.112	in my residual limb,
675.565	I get very little torque and power,
678.436	but the more I fire my muscles,
678.436	the more torque I get,
681.181	and I can even run.
684.014	And that was the first demonstration
684.014	of a running gait under neural command.
688.982	Feels great.
690.158	(Applause)
696.149	We want to go a step further.
697.558	We want to actually close the loop
700.629	between the human
700.629	and the bionic external limb.
704.407	We're doing experiments
705.582	where we're growing nerves,
705.582	transected nerves,
708.075	through channels, or micro-channel arrays.
710.129	On the other side of the channel,
711.847	the nerve then attaches to cells,
714.2	skin cells and muscle cells.
716.926	In the motor channels, we can sense
716.926	how the person wishes to move.
721.07	That can be sent out wirelessly
721.07	to the bionic limb,
724.731	then [sensory information]
724.731	on the bionic limb
727.137	can be converted to stimulations
727.137	in adjacent channels,
730.662	sensory channels.
731.918	So when this is fully developed
731.918	and for human use,
735.97	persons like myself will not only have
738.63	synthetic limbs that move
738.63	like flesh and bone,
742.187	but actually feel like flesh and bone.
746.187	This video shows Lisa Mallette,
748.201	shortly after being fitted
748.201	with two bionic limbs.
751.471	Indeed, bionics is making
751.471	a profound difference in people's lives.
754.988	(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.
759.519	LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!
762.678	(Video) (Laughter)
764.145	LM: It's just like I've got a real leg!
769.237	Woman: Now, don't start running.
770.855	Man: Now turn around,
770.855	and do the same thing walking up,
773.673	but get on your heel to toe, like you
773.673	would normally just walk on level ground.
777.426	Try to walk right up the hill.
781.411	LM: Oh my God.
784.037	Man: Is it pushing you up?
785.307	LM: Yes! I'm not even --
785.307	I can't even describe it.
790.286	Man: It's pushing you right up.
792.608	Hugh Herr: Next week,
792.608	I'm visiting the Center --
795.18	Thank you. Thank you.
796.356	(Applause)
799.886	Thank you.
801.193	Next week I'm visiting the Center
801.193	for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
805.042	and I'm going to try to convince CMS
807.669	to grant appropriate
807.669	code language and pricing,
810.248	so this technology can be made available
810.248	to the patients that need it.
814.003	(Applause)
815.05	Thank you.
816.234	(Applause)
819.873	It's not well appreciated,
819.873	but over half of the world's population
823.841	suffers from some form of cognitive,
823.841	emotional, sensory or motor condition,
828.632	and because of poor technology,
828.632	too often, conditions result in disability
833.066	and a poorer quality of life.
835.113	Basic levels of physiological function
835.113	should be a part of our human rights.
840.077	Every person should have the right
840.077	to live life without disability
844.057	if they so choose --
845.978	the right to live life
845.978	without severe depression;
848.724	the right to see a loved one,
848.724	in the case of seeing-impaired;
852.129	or the right to walk or to dance,
854.042	in the case of limb paralysis
854.042	or limb amputation.
857.633	As a society, we can
857.633	achieve these human rights,
861.323	if we accept the proposition
861.323	that humans are not disabled.
867.794	A person can never be broken.
870.5	Our built environment, our technologies,
873.199	are broken and disabled.
875.444	We the people need not
875.444	accept our limitations,
878.5	but can transcend disability
878.5	through technological innovation.
882.599	Indeed, through fundamental advances
882.599	in bionics in this century,
886.583	we will set the technological foundation
886.583	for an enhanced human experience,
890.765	and we will end disability.
893.456	I'd like to finish up
893.456	with one more story, a beautiful story.
897.613	The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.
900.36	Adrianne lost her left leg
900.36	in the Boston terrorist attack.
904.766	I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
904.766	at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
908.745	Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.
911.245	Adrianne breathes and lives dance.
914.366	It is her expression. It is her art form.
916.66	Naturally, when she lost her limb
916.66	in the Boston terrorist attack,
920.683	she wanted to return to the dance floor.
923.828	After meeting her
923.828	and driving home in my car,
926.011	I thought, I'm an MIT professor.
926.011	I have resources.
929.888	Let's build her a bionic limb,
931.45	to enable her to go back
931.45	to her life of dance.
935.396	I brought in MIT scientists
935.396	with expertise in prosthetics,
938.896	robotics, machine learning
938.896	and biomechanics,
941.229	and over a 200-day research period,
941.229	we studied dance.
945.389	We brought in dancers
945.389	with biological limbs,
949.31	and we studied how they move,
951.969	what forces they apply on the dance floor,
955.166	and we took those data,
956.717	and we put forth
956.717	fundamental principles of dance,
960.516	reflexive dance capability,
962.327	and we embedded that intelligence
962.327	into the bionic limb.
965.992	Bionics is not only about making
965.992	people stronger and faster.
969.761	Our expression, our humanity
969.761	can be embedded into electromechanics.
975.52	It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts
975.52	in the Boston terrorist attack.
981.733	In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards
