12.873	1.3 billion years ago,
16.104	in a distant, distant galaxy,
19.198	two black holes locked into a spiral,
22.576	falling inexorably towards each other
25.234	and collided,
26.632	converting three Suns' worth of stuff
29.599	into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
33.769	For that brief moment in time,
36.538	the glow was brighter than all the stars
39.974	in all the galaxies
41.659	in all of the known Universe.
44.426	It was a very
46.226	big
47.401	bang.
50.297	But they didn't release
50.297	their energy in light.
53.135	I mean, you know, they're black holes.
57.229	All that energy was pumped
57.229	into the fabric of space and time itself,
62.094	making the Universe explode
62.094	in gravitational waves.
65.731	Let me give you a sense
65.731	of the timescale at work here.
69.317	1.3 billion years ago,
71.952	Earth had just managed to evolve
71.952	multicellular life.
76.25	Since then, Earth has made and evolved
79.926	corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people
79.926	and even -- God save us -- the Internet.
86.063	And about 25 years ago,
88.602	a particularly audacious set of people --
90.644	Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne
90.644	and Ronald Drever at Caltech --
96.047	decided that it would be really neat
97.865	to build a giant laser detector
100.602	with which to search
100.602	for the gravitational waves
103.008	from things like colliding black holes.
106.308	Now, most people thought they were nuts.
109.287	But enough people realized
109.287	that they were brilliant nuts
113.225	that the US National Science Foundation
113.225	decided to fund their crazy idea.
118.288	So after decades of development,
121.657	construction and imagination
124.16	and a breathtaking amount of hard work,
128.168	they built their detector, called LIGO:
131.343	The Laser Interferometer
131.343	Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
136.651	For the last several years,
137.985	LIGO's been undergoing
137.985	a huge expansion in its accuracy,
141.608	a tremendous improvement
141.608	in its detection ability.
144.624	It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
148.116	In early September of 2015,
151.005	LIGO turned on for a final test run
153.885	while they sorted out
153.885	a few lingering details.
157.978	And on September 14 of 2015,
162.28	just days after the detector
162.28	had gone live,
166.842	the gravitational waves
166.842	from those colliding black holes
170.653	passed through the Earth.
172.977	And they passed through you and me.
175.59	And they passed through the detector.
179.143	(Audio) Scott Hughes:
179.143	There's two moments in my life
181.668	more emotionally intense than that.
183.383	One is the birth of my daughter.
184.946	The other is when I had to say goodbye
184.946	to my father when he was terminally ill.
190.051	You know, it was the payoff
190.051	of my career, basically.
194.491	Everything I'd been working on --
194.491	it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)
201.416	Allan Adams: So that's my very good friend
201.416	and collaborator, Scott Hughes,
205.61	a theoretical physicist at MIT,
207.825	who has been studying
207.825	gravitational waves from black holes
210.634	and the signals that they could impart
210.634	on observatories like LIGO,
214.187	for the past 23 years.
216.892	So let me take a moment to tell you
216.892	what I mean by a gravitational wave.
221.489	A gravitational wave is a ripple
224.581	in the shape of space and time.
227.468	As the wave passes by,
229.503	it stretches space and everything in it
231.906	in one direction,
233.089	and compresses it in the other.
235.893	This has led to countless instructors
235.893	of general relativity
238.966	doing a really silly dance to demonstrate
238.966	in their classes on general relativity.
242.922	"""It stretches and expands,"
242.922	"it stretches and expands."""
248.08	So the trouble with gravitational waves
250.28	is that they're very weak;
250.28	they're preposterously weak.
253.302	For example, the waves that hit us
253.302	on September 14 --
256.724	and yes, every single one of you
256.724	stretched and compressed
261.442	under the action of that wave --
263.734	when the waves hit, they stretched
263.734	the average person
266.663	by one part in 10 to the 21.
269.798	That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,
272.694	and a one.
275.519	That's why everyone thought
275.519	the LIGO people were nuts.
279.523	Even with a laser detector five kilometers
279.523	long -- and that's already crazy --
285.429	they would have to measure
285.429	the length of those detectors
289.078	to less than one thousandth
289.078	of the radius of the nucleus
293.083	of an atom.
294.265	And that's preposterous.
296.48	So towards the end
296.48	of his classic text on gravity,
300.497	LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne
304.508	described the hunt
304.508	for gravitational waves as follows:
307.519	"He said, ""The technical difficulties"
307.519	to be surmounted
310.694	in constructing such detectors
313.031	are enormous.
315.574	But physicists are ingenious,
318.408	and with the support
318.408	of a broad lay public,
321.972	"all obstacles will surely be overcome."""
326.138	Thorne published that in 1973,
335.149	Now, coming back to LIGO,
336.432	Scott likes to say that LIGO
336.432	acts like an ear
339.67	more than it does like an eye.
341.629	I want to explain what that means.
343.863	Visible light has a wavelength, a size,
346.209	that's much smaller
346.209	than the things around you,
348.806	the features on people's faces,
350.329	the size of your cell phone.
353.582	And that's really useful,
354.813	because it lets you make an image
354.813	or a map of the things around you,
358.044	by looking at the light
358.044	coming from different spots
360.456	in the scene about you.
361.631	Sound is different.
364.111	Audible sound has a wavelength
364.111	that can be up to 50 feet long.
367.585	And that makes it really difficult --
369.386	in fact, in practical purposes,
369.386	impossible -- to make an image
372.45	of something you really care about.
374.292	Your child's face.
376.777	Instead, we use sound
376.777	to listen for features like pitch
380.931	and tone and rhythm and volume
384.073	to infer a story behind the sounds.
388.065	That's Alice talking.
389.943	That's Bob interrupting.
391.5	Silly Bob.
393.809	So, the same is true
393.809	of gravitational waves.
397.688	We can't use them to make simple images
397.688	of things out in the Universe.
402.776	But by listening to changes
404.476	in the amplitude and frequency
404.476	of those waves,
407.943	we can hear the story
407.943	that those waves are telling.
412.224	And at least for LIGO,
413.789	the frequencies that it can hear
413.789	are in the audio band.
418.011	So if we convert the wave patterns
418.011	into pressure waves and air, into sound,
423.121	we can literally hear
423.121	the Universe speaking to us.
427.089	For example, listening to gravity,
427.089	just in this way,
431.244	can tell us a lot about the collision
431.244	of two black holes,
433.958	something my colleague Scott has spent
433.958	an awful lot of time thinking about.
437.776	(Audio) SH: If the two black holes
437.776	are non-spinning,
440.271	you get a very simple chirp: whoop!
442.469	If the two bodies are spinning
442.469	very rapidly, I have that same chirp,
446.146	but with a modulation on top of it,
447.892	so it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
450.281	It's sort of the vocabulary of spin
450.281	imprinted on this waveform.
455.213	AA: So on September 14, 2015,
458.524	a date that's definitely
458.524	going to live in my memory,
461.474	LIGO heard this:
463.743	[Whirring sound]
466.416	So if you know how to listen,
466.416	that is the sound of --
471.32	(Audio) SH: ... two black holes,
471.32	each of about 30 solar masses,
474.558	that were whirling around at a rate
476.274	comparable to what goes on
476.274	in your blender.
479.331	AA: It's worth pausing here
479.331	to think about what that means.
482.157	Two black holes, the densest thing
482.157	in the Universe,
485.466	one with a mass of 29 Suns
487.67	and one with a mass of 36 Suns,
490.481	whirling around each other
493.178	before they collide.
494.36	Just imagine the power of that.
496.819	It's fantastic.
499.167	And we know it because we heard it.
503.827	That's the lasting importance of LIGO.
507.049	It's an entirely new way
507.049	to observe the Universe
510.782	that we've never had before.
512.663	It's a way that lets us hear the Universe
515.751	and hear the invisible.
519.496	And there's a lot out there
519.496	that we can't see --
522.556	in practice or even in principle.
524.208	So supernova, for example:
526.241	I would love to know why very massive
526.241	stars explode in supernovae.
530.709	They're very useful;
531.884	we've learned a lot
531.884	about the Universe from them.
534.252	The problem is, all the interesting
534.252	physics happens in the core,
537.283	and the core is hidden behind
537.283	thousands of kilometers
539.812	of iron and carbon and silicon.
541.911	We'll never see through it,
541.911	it's opaque to light.
544.24	Gravitational waves go through iron
544.24	as if it were glass --
548.18	totally transparent.
550.512	The Big Bang: I would love
550.512	to be able to explore
552.933	the first few moments of the Universe,
555.796	but we'll never see them,
557.468	because the Big Bang itself
557.468	is obscured by its own afterglow.
562.703	With gravitational waves,
564.917	we should be able to see
564.917	all the way back to the beginning.
568.425	Perhaps most importantly,
570.243	I'm positive that there
570.243	are things out there
573.3	that we've never seen
574.915	that we may never be able to see
576.692	and that we haven't even imagined --
579.969	things that we'll only
579.969	discover by listening.
583.255	And in fact, even
583.255	in that very first event,
585.939	LIGO found things that we didn't expect.
589.564	Here's my colleague and one of the key
589.564	members of the LIGO collaboration,
593.079	Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT,
593.079	addressing exactly that:
596.741	(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars
596.741	which produce the black holes
599.975	that we observed here
601.261	are the dinosaurs of the Universe.
603.063	They're these massive things
603.063	that are old, from prehistoric times,
606.762	and the black holes are kind of like
606.762	the dinosaur bones
609.432	with which we do this archeology.
611.074	So it lets us really get
611.074	a whole nother angle
613.646	on what's out there in the Universe
615.551	and how the stars came to be,
615.551	and in the end, of course,
618.338	how we came to be out of this whole mess.
622.304	AA: Our challenge now
623.98	is to be as audacious as possible.
627.84	Thanks to LIGO, we know how
627.84	to build exquisite detectors
630.766	that can listen to the Universe,
632.359	to the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
635.89	Our job is to dream up and build
635.89	new observatories --
639.102	a whole new generation of observatories --
641.157	on the ground, in space.
643.559	I mean, what could be more glorious
643.559	than listening to the Big Bang itself?
648.973	Our job now is to dream big.
651.552	Dream with us.
652.807	Thank you.
653.99	(Applause)
