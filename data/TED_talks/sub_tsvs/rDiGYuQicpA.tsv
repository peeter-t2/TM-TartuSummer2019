28.337	Thank you so much, Chris.
29.552	And it's truly a great honor
29.552	to have the opportunity
33.526	to come to this stage twice;
33.526	I'm extremely grateful.
36.554	I have been blown away by this conference,
40.112	and I want to thank all of you
40.112	for the many nice comments
45.804	about what I had to say the other night.
48	And I say that sincerely,
50.899	partly because (Mock sob)
52.887	I need that.
54.062	(Laughter)
59.943	Put yourselves in my position.
61.888	(Laughter)
68.44	I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.
71.021	(Laughter)
73	Now I have to take off my shoes
73	or boots to get on an airplane!
76.388	(Laughter)
79.117	(Applause)
85.589	I'll tell you one quick story
87.336	to illustrate what
87.336	that's been like for me.
90.479	(Laughter)
92.024	It's a true story --
92.024	every bit of this is true.
95.158	Soon after Tipper and I left the --
95.158	(Mock sob) White House --
98.767	(Laughter)
100.809	we were driving from our home
100.809	in Nashville to a little farm we have
109	Driving ourselves.
110.514	(Laughter)
113	I know it sounds like
113	a little thing to you, but --
115.741	(Laughter)
121.234	I looked in the rear-view mirror
126.965	and all of a sudden it just hit me.
130.195	There was no motorcade back there.
131.855	(Laughter)
134.533	You've heard of phantom limb pain?
136.55	(Laughter)
141.386	This was a rented Ford Taurus.
145.626	(Laughter)
148.154	It was dinnertime,
150.184	and we started looking for a place to eat.
153.588	We were on I-40.
155.017	We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.
158.238	We got off the exit,
158.238	we found a Shoney's restaurant.
161.95	Low-cost family restaurant chain,
161.95	for those of you who don't know it.
166.877	We went in and sat down at the booth,
166.877	and the waitress came over,
171.336	made a big commotion over Tipper.
173.346	(Laughter)
175.833	She took our order, and then went
175.833	to the couple in the booth next to us,
179.277	and she lowered her voice so much,
181.405	I had to really strain to hear
181.405	what she was saying.
184.43	"And she said ""Yes, that's former"
184.43	Vice President Al Gore
187.133	"and his wife, Tipper."""
189	And the man said,
190.551	"""He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"""
192.767	(Laughter)
197.699	(Applause)
202	There's been kind
202	of a series of epiphanies.
205.143	(Laughter)
206.311	The very next day,
206.311	continuing the totally true story,
210	I got on a G-V to fly to Africa
210	to make a speech in Nigeria,
216	in the city of Lagos,
216	on the topic of energy.
219.301	And I began the speech
219.301	by telling them the story
223.121	of what had just happened
223.121	the day before in Nashville.
226.196	And I told it pretty much the same way
226.196	I've just shared it with you:
229.526	Tipper and I were driving ourselves,
231.288	Shoney's, low-cost
231.288	family restaurant chain,
233.35	what the man said -- they laughed.
235.703	I gave my speech, then went back
235.703	out to the airport to fly back home.
239.31	I fell asleep on the plane
241.2	until, during the middle
241.2	of the night, we landed
243.762	on the Azores Islands for refueling.
246.364	I woke up, they opened the door,
246.364	I went out to get some fresh air,
249.5	and I looked, and there was a man
249.5	running across the runway.
253	And he was waving a piece
253	of paper, and he was yelling,
256.079	"""Call Washington! Call Washington!"""
260.981	And I thought to myself,
260.981	in the middle of the night,
263.45	in the middle of the Atlantic,
264.91	what in the world could be
264.91	wrong in Washington?
267.154	Then I remembered
267.154	it could be a bunch of things.
269.439	(Laughter)
275	But what it turned out to be,
276.951	was that my staff was extremely upset
280.286	because one of the wire services
280.286	in Nigeria had already written a story
286.512	about my speech,
287.956	and it had already been printed in cities
289.956	all across the United States of America.
292.312	It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
294.164	(Laughter)
295.553	And the story began,
298.238	"""Former Vice President Al Gore"
298.238	"announced in Nigeria yesterday,"" quote:"
302.555	'My wife Tipper and I have opened
302.555	"a low-cost family restaurant'"" --"
306.208	(Laughter)
307.874	"""'named Shoney's,"
309.246	"and we are running it ourselves.'"""
311.069	(Laughter)
314.413	Before I could get back to U.S. soil,
316.595	David Letterman and Jay Leno
316.595	had already started in on --
320.733	one of them had me
320.733	in a big white chef's hat,
324	Tipper was saying,
324	"""One more burger with fries!"""
326.453	(Laughter)
327.524	Three days later,
328.83	I got a nice, long, handwritten letter
331.593	from my friend and partner
331.593	and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,
335.038	"""Congratulations"
335.038	"on the new restaurant, Al!"""
337.458	(Laughter)
344.155	We like to celebrate
344.155	each other's successes in life.
347.316	(Laughter)
353.606	I was going to talk
353.606	about information ecology.
356.177	But I was thinking that,
358.219	since I plan to make a lifelong habit
358.219	of coming back to TED,
362	that maybe I could talk
362	about that another time.
364.717	(Applause)
366.141	Chris Anderson: It's a deal!
367.562	(Applause)
370.212	Al Gore: I want to focus
370.212	on what many of you have said
374.754	you would like me to elaborate on:
376.644	What can you do about the climate crisis?
381.317	I want to start with a couple of --
384.68	I'm going to show some new images,
387.273	and I'm going to recapitulate
387.273	just four or five.
393.075	Now, the slide show.
394.671	I update the slide show
394.671	every time I give it.
398	I add new images,
399.261	because I learn more about it
399.261	every time I give it.
402.823	It's like beach-combing, you know?
404.798	Every time the tide comes in and out,
404.798	you find some more shells.
408	Just in the last two days, we got
408	the new temperature records in January.
414.007	This is just for
414.007	the United States of America.
417.041	Historical average
417.041	for Januarys is 31 degrees;
419.803	last month was 39.5 degrees.
423.932	Now, I know that you wanted some more
423.932	bad news about the environment --
428.769	I'm kidding.
430.404	But these are the recapitulation slides,
433.484	and then I'm going to go into new
433.484	material about what you can do.
436.902	But I wanted to elaborate
436.902	on a couple of these.
439.321	First of all, this is where
439.321	we're projected to go
442.656	with the U.S. contribution
442.656	to global warming,
444.782	under business as usual.
446.59	Efficiency in end-use electricity
446.59	and end-use of all energy
452	is the low-hanging fruit.
453.648	Efficiency and conservation --
453.648	it's not a cost; it's a profit.
458.176	The sign is wrong.
460.877	It's not negative; it's positive.
463.044	These are investments
463.044	that pay for themselves.
465.908	But they are also very effective
465.908	in deflecting our path.
470.62	Cars and trucks -- I talked
470.62	about that in the slideshow,
474.639	but I want you to put it in perspective.
477.893	It's an easy, visible target of concern --
482.514	and it should be --
484	but there is more global warming pollution
484	that comes from buildings
488.703	than from cars and trucks.
491	Cars and trucks are very significant,
493.665	and we have the lowest
493.665	standards in the world.
496.274	And so we should address that.
496.274	But it's part of the puzzle.
499.324	Other transportation efficiency
499.324	is as important as cars and trucks.
504.709	Renewables at the current levels
504.709	of technological efficiency
509.075	can make this much difference.
510.846	And with what Vinod, and John Doerr
510.846	and others, many of you here --
516.825	there are a lot of people
516.825	directly involved in this --
519.416	this wedge is going to grow
519.416	much more rapidly
521.972	than the current projection shows it.
524.183	Carbon Capture and Sequestration --
524.183	that's what CCS stands for --
529.947	is likely to become the killer app
529.947	that will enable us
536.786	to continue to use fossil fuels
536.786	in a way that is safe.
544.459	Not quite there yet.
545.819	OK. Now, what can you do?
551.495	Reduce emissions in your home.
554.022	Most of these expenditures
554.022	are also profitable.
559.007	Insulation, better design.
561	Buy green electricity where you can.
564.436	I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.
568.27	Use light rail.
570.505	Figure out some of the other options
570.505	that are much better.
573.311	It's important.
575.254	Be a green consumer.
576.997	You have choices with everything you buy,
580	between things that have a harsh effect,
583.631	or a much less harsh effect
583.631	on the global climate crisis.
589.87	Consider this:
591.726	Make a decision to live
591.726	a carbon-neutral life.
595.663	Those of you who are good at branding,
598.121	I'd love to get your advice and help
600.617	on how to say this in a way
600.617	that connects with the most people.
606.719	It is easier than you think.
608.724	It really is.
612.223	A lot of us in here
612.223	have made that decision,
615.642	and it is really pretty easy.
617.8	It means reduce
617.8	your carbon dioxide emissions
623.751	with the full range
623.751	of choices that you make,
626.471	and then purchase or acquire offsets
630.62	for the remainder that you have not
630.62	completely reduced.
633.761	And what it means is elaborated
633.761	at climatecrisis.net.
640.755	There is a carbon calculator.
644.501	Participant Productions convened --
648	with my active involvement --
650.594	the leading software writers in the world,
653.435	on this arcane science
653.435	of carbon calculation,
656.762	to construct a consumer-friendly
656.762	carbon calculator.
661.317	You can very precisely calculate
661.317	what your CO2 emissions are,
667.55	and then you will be given
667.55	options to reduce.
670.892	And by the time the movie
670.892	comes out in May,
674.113	this will be updated to 2.0,
676	and we will have click-through
676	purchases of offsets.
680	Next, consider making
680	your business carbon-neutral.
683.246	Again, some of us have done that,
684.878	and it's not as hard as you think.
688.196	Integrate climate solutions
688.196	into all of your innovations,
692.41	whether you are from the technology,
694.347	or entertainment, or design
694.347	and architecture community.
698	Invest sustainably.
700.067	Majora mentioned this.
702.248	Listen, if you have invested money
702.248	with managers who you compensate
709.064	on the basis of their annual performance,
711.805	don't ever again complain
711.805	about quarterly report CEO management.
717.807	Over time, people do
717.807	what you pay them to do.
721.736	And if they judge how much
721.736	they're going to get paid
726.453	on your capital that they've invested,
729.777	based on the short-term returns,
731.744	you're going to get short-term decisions.
735.999	A lot more to be said about that.
737.636	Become a catalyst of change.
739.406	Teach others, learn about it,
739.406	talk about it.
744.263	The movie is a movie version
744.263	of the slideshow
747.692	I gave two nights ago,
747.692	except it's a lot more entertaining.
751.694	And it comes out in May.
754.437	Many of you here have the opportunity
754.437	to ensure that a lot of people see it.
760.106	Consider sending somebody to Nashville.
764.39	Pick well.
766.381	And I am personally going to train people
766.381	to give this slideshow --
770.851	re-purposed, with some
770.851	of the personal stories obviously replaced
775.63	with a generic approach,
777.724	and it's not just the slides,
777.724	it's what they mean.
780.447	And it's how they link together.
782.072	And so I'm going to be conducting
782.072	a course this summer
786.683	for a group of people that are
786.683	nominated by different folks
790.542	to come and then give it en masse,
792.795	in communities all across the country,
795	and we're going to update the slideshow
795	for all of them every single week,
799.689	to keep it right on the cutting edge.
802.744	Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,
802.744	somewhere in that process,
806.649	posted with tools
806.649	and limited-use copyrights,
811.508	so that young people can remix it
811.508	and do it in their own way.
817	(Applause)
820.17	Where did anybody get the idea
821.684	that you ought to stay
821.684	arm's length from politics?
824.06	It doesn't mean
824.06	that if you're a Republican,
826.174	that I'm trying to convince you
826.174	to be a Democrat.
828.935	We need Republicans as well.
830.464	This used to be a bipartisan issue,
832.497	and I know that
832.497	in this group it really is.
834.978	Become politically active.
836.554	Make our democracy work the way
836.554	it's supposed to work.
839.753	Support the idea of capping
839.753	carbon dioxide emissions --
845.326	global warming pollution --
845.326	and trading it.
847.365	Here's why: as long as the United States
847.365	is out of the world system,
852	it's not a closed system.
853.692	Once it becomes a closed system,
853.692	with U.S. participation,
857.763	then everybody
857.763	who's on a board of directors --
860.01	how many people here
860.01	serve on the board of directors
863.023	of a corporation?
865.415	Once it's a closed system,
866.865	you will have legal liability
866.865	if you do not urge your CEO
873.126	to get the maximum income from reducing
873.126	and trading the carbon emissions
877.277	that can be avoided.
878.61	The market will work
878.61	to solve this problem --
883.949	if we can accomplish this.
887.434	Help with the mass persuasion campaign
887.434	that will start this spring.
890.843	We have to change the minds
890.843	of the American people.
893.375	Because presently, the politicians
893.375	do not have permission
896.158	to do what needs to be done.
898.355	And in our modern country, the role
898.355	of logic and reason no longer includes
903.833	mediating between wealth and power
903.833	the way it once did.
906.811	It's now repetition of short, hot-button,
912.395	We have to buy a lot of those ads.
915.221	Let's re-brand global warming,
915.221	as many of you have suggested.
919.555	"I like ""climate crisis"""
919.555	"instead of ""climate collapse,"""
922.448	but again, those of you
922.448	who are good at branding,
924.799	I need your help on this.
926.768	Somebody said the test
926.768	we're facing now, a scientist told me,
930.892	is whether the combination
930.892	of an opposable thumb
934	and a neocortex is a viable combination.
936.947	(Laughter)
938.825	That's really true.
943.16	I said the other night,
943.16	and I'll repeat now:
946.584	this is not a political issue.
948.773	Again, the Republicans here --
948.773	this shouldn't be partisan.
954.336	You have more influence
954.336	than some of us who are Democrats do.
958.421	This is an opportunity.
959.921	Not just this, but connected
959.921	to the ideas that are here,
964.797	to bring more coherence to them.
967.495	We are one.
969.065	Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
971.424	(Applause)
