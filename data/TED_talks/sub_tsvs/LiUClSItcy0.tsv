17.366	To most of you, this is a device
19.244	to buy, sell, play games,
22.252	watch videos.
24.162	I think it might be a lifeline.
26.302	I think actually it might be able to save more lives
28.718	than penicillin.
30.218	Texting:
31.691	I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting,
34.51	a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see --
37.76	hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else --
40.385	or trying to translate the abbreviations
42.177	LOL, LMAO, HMU.
45.135	I can help you with those later.
46.968	But the parents in the room
49.01	know that texting is actually
50.635	the best way to communicate with your kids.
53.26	It might be the only way to communicate with your kids.
56.093	(Laughter)
57.76	The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month,
62.385	unless she's a girl, then it's closer to 4,000.
65.885	And the secret is she opens every single one.
69.468	Texting has a 100 percent open rate.
73.177	Now the parents are really alarmed.
74.593	It's a 100 percent open rate
76.427	even if she doesn't respond to you
78.177	when you ask her when she's coming home for dinner.
79.927	I promise she read that text.
81.468	And this isn't some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon.
87.552	Texting actually overindexes
88.927	for minority and urban youth.
91.01	I know this because at DoSomething.org,
93.885	which is the largest organization
95.593	for teenagers and social change in America,
98.552	about six months ago we pivoted
100.01	and started focusing on text messaging.
101.635	We're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week
105.843	about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green
108.552	or to work on homeless issues and things like that.
111.718	We're finding it 11 times more powerful than email.
115.135	We've also found an unintended consequence.
121.218	We've been getting text messages back like these.
124.26	"""I don't want to go to school today."
127.51	"The boys call me faggot."""
129.385	"""I was cutting, my parents found out,"
133.968	and so I stopped.
135.843	"But I just started again an hour ago."""
138.052	"Or, ""He won't stop raping me."
141.343	He told me not to tell anyone.
142.718	"It's my dad. Are you there?"""
145.51	That last one's an actual text message that we received.
148.635	And yeah, we're there.
151.385	I will not forget the day we got that text message.
153.927	And so it was that day that we decided
156.343	we needed to build a crisis text hotline.
159.468	Because this isn't what we do.
160.968	We do social change.
162.302	Kids are just sending us these text messages
164.302	because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them
167.218	and there's nowhere else to turn
169.01	that they're sending them to us.
171.593	So think about it, a text hotline; it's pretty powerful.
173.885	It's fast, it's pretty private.
175.593	No one hears you in a stall, you're just texting quietly.
179.01	It's real time.
181.052	We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals.
184.214	That's great.
186.468	But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data.
190.885	Because I'm not really comfortable just helping that girl
193.385	with counseling and referrals.
195.135	I want to prevent this shit from happening.
198.635	So think about a cop.
201.968	There's something in New York City.
203.718	The police did it. It used to be just guess work, police work.
206.26	And then they started crime mapping.
209.843	And so they started following and watching
211.218	petty thefts, summonses, all kinds of things --
214.26	charting the future essentially.
216.01	And they found things like,
218.718	when you see crystal meth on the street,
220.343	if you add police presence,
221.968	you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate
225.093	of assaults and robberies that would happen.
228.677	In fact, the year after
229.802	the NYPD put CompStat in place,
232.427	the murder rate fell 60 percent.
235.593	So think about the data from a crisis text line.
240.135	There is no census on bullying and dating abuse
243.51	and eating disorders and cutting and rape --
246.427	no census.
248.177	Maybe there's some studies, some longitudinal studies,
250.51	that cost lots of money and took lots of time.
253.135	Or maybe there's some anecdotal evidence.
255.51	Imagine having real time data
258.51	on every one of those issues.
260.177	You could inform legislation.
261.968	You could inform school policy.
263.76	You could say to a principal,
265.843	"""You're having a problem every Thursday at three o'clock."
268.635	"What's going on in your school?"""
270.593	You could see the immediate impact of legislation
273.135	or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly
275.427	and see what happens as a result.
278.968	This is really, to me,
280.635	the power of texting and the power of data.
284.01	Because while people are talking about data,
286.26	making it possible for Facebook
287.843	to mine my friend from the third grade,
290.093	or Target to know when it's time for me to buy more diapers,
293.052	or some dude to build a better baseball team,
296.052	I'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting
301.218	to help that kid go to school,
303.343	to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom
305.427	and absolutely to help that girl whose father's raping her.
309.343	Thank you.
312.135	(Applause)
