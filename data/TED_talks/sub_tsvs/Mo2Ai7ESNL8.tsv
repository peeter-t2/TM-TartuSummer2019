12.996	So recently, we heard a lot about
12.996	how social media helps empower protest,
17.802	and that's true,
19.181	but after more than a decade
20.836	of studying and participating
20.836	in multiple social movements,
24.501	I've come to realize
26.303	that the way technology
26.303	empowers social movements
29.614	can also paradoxically help weaken them.
32.72	This is not inevitable,
32.72	but overcoming it requires diving deep
36.604	into what makes success possible
36.604	over the long term.
40.897	And the lessons apply in multiple domains.
43.458	Now, take Turkey's
43.458	Gezi Park protests, July 2013,
47.453	which I went back to study in the field.
50.49	Twitter was key to its organizing.
52.943	It was everywhere in the park --
52.943	well, along with a lot of tear gas.
56.337	It wasn't all high tech.
58.175	But the people in Turkey had already
58.175	gotten used to the power of Twitter
62.053	because of an unfortunate incident
62.053	about a year before
65.994	when military jets had bombed and killed
	near the border region,
73.874	and Turkish media completely
73.874	censored this news.
78.618	Editors sat in their newsrooms
80.456	and waited for the government
80.456	to tell them what to do.
83.355	One frustrated journalist
83.355	could not take this anymore.
85.955	He purchased his own plane ticket,
87.645	and went to the village
87.645	where this had occurred.
89.957	And he was confronted by this scene:
92.623	a line of coffins coming down a hill,
92.623	relatives wailing.
98.021	He later he told me
98.021	how overwhelmed he felt,
100.462	and didn't know what to do,
102.183	so he took out his phone,
104.156	like any one of us might,
105.924	and snapped that picture
105.924	and tweeted it out.
109.122	And voila, that picture went viral
112.849	and broke the censorship
112.849	and forced mass media to cover it.
117.237	So when, a year later,
117.237	Turkey's Gezi protests happened,
120.418	it started as a protest
120.418	about a park being razed,
123.14	but became an anti-authoritarian protest.
125.443	It wasn't surprising
125.443	that media also censored it,
129.601	but it got a little ridiculous at times.
132.533	When things were so intense,
134.603	when CNN International
134.603	was broadcasting live from Istanbul,
138.998	CNN Turkey instead was broadcasting
138.998	a documentary on penguins.
145.351	Now, I love penguin documentaries,
145.351	but that wasn't the news of the day.
149.934	An angry viewer put his two screens
149.934	together and snapped that picture,
154.231	and that one too went viral,
156.098	and since then, people call Turkish media
156.098	the penguin media. (Laughter)
160.586	But this time, people knew what to do.
162.751	They just took out their phones
162.751	and looked for actual news.
165.71	Better, they knew to go to the park
165.71	and take pictures and participate
170.174	and share it more on social media.
172.125	Digital connectivity was used
172.125	for everything from food to donations.
178.675	Everything was organized partially
178.675	with the help of these new technologies.
183.947	And using Internet to mobilize
183.947	and publicize protests
188.153	actually goes back a long way.
190.609	Remember the Zapatistas,
192.454	the peasant uprising
192.454	in the southern Chiapas region of Mexico
197.089	led by the masked, pipe-smoking,
197.089	charismatic Subcomandante Marcos?
202.72	That was probably the first movement
204.599	that got global attention
204.599	thanks to the Internet.
207.69	Or consider Seattle '99,
209.338	when a multinational grassroots effort
209.338	brought global attention
214.141	to what was then an obscure organization,
214.141	the World Trade Organization,
218.826	by also utilizing these digital
218.826	technologies to help them organize.
223.367	And more recently, movement after movement
225.902	has shaken country after country:
228.74	the Arab uprisings from Bahrain
228.74	to Tunisia to Egypt and more;
233.872	indignados in Spain, Italy, Greece;
233.872	the Gezi Park protests;
238.744	Taiwan; Euromaidan in Ukraine; Hong Kong.
242.968	And think of more recent initiatives,
242.968	like the #BringBackOurGirls hashtags.
247.68	Nowadays, a network of tweets
247.68	can unleash a global awareness campaign.
254.536	A Facebook page can become the hub
254.536	of a massive mobilization.
258.454	Amazing.
260.224	But think of the moments I just mentioned.
264.538	The achievements they were
264.538	able to have, their outcomes,
269.203	are not really proportional
269.203	to the size and energy they inspired.
274.013	The hopes they rightfully raised
274.013	are not really matched
278.034	by what they were able to have
278.034	as a result in the end.
282.502	And this raises a question:
286.204	As digital technology makes things
286.204	easier for movements,
290.429	why haven't successful outcomes
290.429	become more likely as well?
294.452	In embracing digital platforms
294.452	for activism and politics,
300.017	are we overlooking some of the benefits
300.017	of doing things the hard way?
304.251	Now, I believe so.
305.468	I believe that the rule of thumb is:
307.273	Easier to mobilize does not always mean
307.273	easier to achieve gains.
312.61	Now, to be clear,
315.503	technology does empower in multiple ways.
318.357	It's very powerful.
319.817	In Turkey, I watched
319.817	four young college students
323.863	organize a countrywide citizen journalism
323.863	network called 140Journos
328.093	that became the central hub
328.093	for uncensored news in the country.
332.524	In Egypt, I saw another four young people
332.524	use digital connectivity
337.671	to organize the supplies and logistics
337.671	for 10 field hospitals,
341.518	very large operations,
343.529	during massive clashes
343.529	near Tahrir Square in 2011.
349.5	And I asked the founder
349.5	of this effort, called Tahrir Supplies,
353.217	how long it took him to go from when
353.217	he had the idea to when he got started.
359.327	"""Five minutes,"" he said. Five minutes."
361.686	And he had no training
361.686	or background in logistics.
364.234	Or think of the Occupy movement
364.234	which rocked the world in 2011.
367.957	It started with a single email
369.935	from a magazine, Adbusters,
369.935	to 90,000 subscribers in its list.
375.176	About two months after that first email,
378.16	there were in the United States
384.509	Less than one month after the first
384.509	physical occupation in Zuccotti Park,
390.333	a global protest was held
390.333	in about 82 countries, 950 cities.
397.174	It was one of the largest
397.174	global protests ever organized.
399.919	Now, compare that to what the Civil Rights
399.919	Movement had to do in 1955 Alabama
406.606	to protest the racially segregated
406.606	bus system, which they wanted to boycott.
412.743	They'd been preparing for many years
414.495	and decided it was time
414.495	to swing into action
416.561	after Rosa Parks was arrested.
418.764	But how do you get the word out --
420.43	tomorrow we're going to
420.43	start the boycott --
422.593	when you don't have Facebook,
422.593	texting, Twitter, none of that?
428.001	So they had to mimeograph 52,000 leaflets
433.171	by sneaking into a university
433.171	duplicating room
436.364	and working all night, secretly.
438.905	They then used the 68
438.905	African-American organizations
442.398	that criss-crossed the city
442.398	to distribute those leaflets by hand.
446.365	And the logistical tasks were daunting,
446.365	because these were poor people.
451.335	They had to get to work, boycott or no,
453.425	so a massive carpool was organized,
456.327	again by meeting.
458.443	No texting, no Twitter, no Facebook.
460.838	They had to meet almost all the time
460.838	to keep this carpool going.
464.407	Today, it would be so much easier.
466.679	We could create a database,
466.679	available rides and what rides you need,
471.667	have the database coordinate,
471.667	and use texting.
474.949	We wouldn't have to meet all that much.
477.503	But again, consider this:
479.779	the Civil Rights Movement
479.779	in the United States
482.773	navigated a minefield
482.773	of political dangers,
487.267	faced repression and overcame,
487.267	won major policy concessions,
492.77	navigated and innovated through risks.
496.006	In contrast, three years
496.006	after Occupy sparked
499.539	that global conversation about inequality,
502.145	the policies that fueled it
502.145	are still in place.
505.97	Europe was also rocked
505.97	by anti-austerity protests,
509.115	but the continent
509.115	didn't shift its direction.
513.237	In embracing these technologies,
516.173	are we overlooking some of the benefits
516.173	of slow and sustained?
522.581	To understand this,
524.45	I went back to Turkey
524.45	about a year after the Gezi protests
527.573	and I interviewed a range of people,
529.85	from activists to politicians,
533.557	from both the ruling party
533.557	and the opposition party and movements.
538.174	I found that the Gezi protesters
538.174	were despairing.
541.48	They were frustrated,
543.511	and they had achieved much less
543.511	than what they had hoped for.
546.567	This echoed what I'd been hearing
546.567	around the world
549.105	from many other protesters
549.105	that I'm in touch with.
552.891	And I've come to realize
552.891	that part of the problem
555.198	is that today's protests have become
555.198	a bit like climbing Mt. Everest
561.067	with the help of 60 Sherpas,
563.524	and the Internet is our Sherpa.
566.651	What we're doing is taking the fast routes
570.964	and not replacing the benefits
570.964	of the slower work.
574.303	Because, you see,
575.999	the kind of work that went into organizing
578.867	all those daunting,
578.867	tedious logistical tasks
581.65	did not just take care of those tasks,
584.279	they also created the kind of organization
584.279	that could think together collectively
588.963	and make hard decisions together,
591.238	create consensus and innovate,
591.238	and maybe even more crucially,
595.175	keep going together through differences.
598.542	So when you see this
598.542	March on Washington in 1963,
603.33	when you look at that picture,
605.014	where this is the march where
605.014	Martin Luther King gave his famous
608.355	"""I have a dream"" speech, 1963,"
611.207	you don't just see a march
611.207	and you don't just hear a powerful speech,
615.649	you also see the painstaking,
615.649	long-term work that can put on that march.
621.122	And if you're in power,
622.917	you realize you have to take
622.917	the capacity signaled by that march,
627.218	not just the march, but the capacity
627.218	signaled by that march, seriously.
631.724	In contrast, when you look
631.724	at Occupy's global marches
635.727	that were organized in two weeks,
637.369	you see a lot of discontent,
638.753	but you don't necessarily see teeth that
638.753	can bite over the long term.
643.617	And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement
643.617	innovated tactically
647.71	from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins
647.71	to pickets to marches to freedom rides.
654.496	Today's movements scale up very quickly
654.496	without the organizational base
658.311	that can see them through the challenges.
660.9	They feel a little like startups
660.9	that got very big
664.7	without knowing what to do next,
666.705	and they rarely manage to shift tactically
669.362	because they don't have
669.362	the depth of capacity
671.859	to weather such transitions.
674.151	Now, I want to be clear:
674.151	The magic is not in the mimeograph.
679.668	It's in that capacity to work together,
679.668	think together collectively,
685.489	which can only be built
685.489	over time with a lot of work.
688.671	To understand all this,
690.747	I interviewed a top official
690.747	from the ruling party in Turkey,
694.571	"and I ask him, ""How do you do it?"""
696.739	They too use digital technology
696.739	extensively, so that's not it.
700.442	So what's the secret?
702.372	Well, he told me.
703.896	He said the key is
703.896	he never took sugar with his tea.
710.532	I said, what has that
710.532	got to do with anything?
713.593	Well, he said, his party starts
713.593	getting ready for the next election
716.759	the day after the last one,
718.3	and he spends all day every day
718.3	meeting with voters in their homes,
722.281	in their wedding parties,
722.281	circumcision ceremonies,
724.863	and then he meets with his colleagues
724.863	to compare notes.
727.818	With that many meetings every day,
727.818	with tea offered at every one of them,
732.384	which he could not refuse,
732.384	because that would be rude,
735.736	he could not take even one cube of sugar
735.736	per cup of tea,
740.379	because that would be many kilos of sugar,
740.379	he can't even calculate how many kilos,
744.335	and at that point I realized
744.335	why he was speaking so fast.
747.979	We had met in the afternoon,
747.979	and he was already way over-caffeinated.
752.527	But his party won two major elections
757	within a year of the Gezi protests
757	with comfortable margins.
760.658	To be sure, governments have
760.658	different resources to bring to the table.
763.997	It's not the same game,
763.997	but the differences are instructive.
767.154	And like all such stories, this is not
767.154	a story just of technology.
771.009	It's what technology allows us to do
771.009	converging with what we want to do.
776.091	Today's social movements
776.091	want to operate informally.
779.877	They do not want institutional leadership.
782.147	They want to stay out of politics because
782.147	they fear corruption and cooptation.
787.013	They have a point.
788.546	Modern representative democracies
788.546	are being strangled in many countries
791.961	by powerful interests.
794.244	But operating this way
794.244	makes it hard for them
797.518	to sustain over the long term
797.518	and exert leverage over the system,
801.268	which leads to frustrated
801.268	protesters dropping out,
804.53	and even more corrupt politics.
807.889	And politics and democracy
807.889	without an effective challenge hobbles,
812.977	because the causes that have inspired
812.977	the modern recent movements are crucial.
819.37	Climate change is barreling towards us.
822.465	Inequality is stifling human growth
822.465	and potential and economies.
827.348	Authoritarianism is choking
827.348	many countries.
829.633	We need movements to be more effective.
832.384	Now, some people have argued
832.384	that the problem is
835.062	today's movements are not formed of people
835.062	who take as many risks as before,
841.521	and that is not true.
843.569	From Gezi to Tahrir to elsewhere,
846.131	I've seen people put their lives
846.131	and livelihoods on the line.
849.769	It's also not true,
849.769	as Malcolm Gladwell claimed,
852.188	that today's protesters
852.188	form weaker virtual ties.
854.93	No, they come to these protests,
854.93	just like before,
858.721	with their friends, existing networks,
861.333	and sometimes they do
861.333	make new friends for life.
863.635	I still see the friends that I made
866.221	in those Zapatista-convened
866.221	global protests more than a decade ago,
869.643	and the bonds between strangers
869.643	are not worthless.
872.615	When I got tear-gassed in Gezi,
874.899	people I didn't know helped me
874.899	and one another instead of running away.
880.171	In Tahrir, I saw people, protesters,
883.398	working really hard to keep
883.398	each other safe and protected.
886.208	And digital awareness-raising is great,
888.097	because changing minds
888.097	is the bedrock of changing politics.
891.816	But movements today have to move beyond
891.816	participation at great scale very fast
899.216	and figure out how
899.216	to think together collectively,
902.715	develop strong policy proposals,
902.715	create consensus,
906.456	figure out the political steps
906.456	and relate them to leverage,
910.13	because all these good intentions
910.13	and bravery and sacrifice by itself
913.813	are not going to be enough.
915.485	And there are many efforts.
917.381	In New Zealand, a group of young people
917.381	are developing a platform called Loomio
921.77	for participatory
921.77	decision making at scale.
924.771	In Turkey, 140Journos
924.771	are holding hack-a-thons
928.046	so that they support communities
928.046	as well as citizen journalism.
932.619	In Argentina, an open-source platform
932.619	called DemocracyOS
935.725	is bringing participation
935.725	to parliaments and political parties.
939.133	These are all great, and we need more,
942.518	but the answer won't just be
942.518	better online decision-making,
946.694	because to update democracy, we are going
946.694	to need to innovate at every level,
952.247	from the organizational
952.247	to the political to the social.
956.74	Because to succeed over the long term,
960.692	sometimes you do need tea without sugar
963.064	along with your Twitter.
964.697	Thank you.
966.209	(Applause)
