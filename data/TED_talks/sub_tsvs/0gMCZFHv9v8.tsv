12.346	This is me building a prototype
15.116	for six hours straight.
18.036	This is slave labor to my own project.
21.957	This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.
26.947	And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world
31.713	with brute-force assembly techniques.
34.501	And this is exactly why I started studying
37.335	how to program physical materials to build themselves.
41.604	But there is another world.
43.364	Today at the micro- and nanoscales,
45.359	there's an unprecedented revolution happening.
48.11	And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials
52.242	to change shape, change properties
54.966	and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.
57.952	There's even a software called cadnano
60.459	that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes
63.242	like nano robots or drug delivery systems
66.326	and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.
70.629	But if we look at the human scale,
72.702	there's massive problems that aren't being addressed
75.758	by those nanoscale technologies.
78.126	If we look at construction and manufacturing,
80.225	there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption
84.418	and excessive labor techniques.
86.745	In infrastructure, let's just take one example.
89.25	Take piping.
90.733	In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes
94.458	that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.
98.917	We bury them in the ground.
100.208	If anything changes -- if the environment changes,
102.829	the ground moves, or demand changes --
105.466	we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.
109.716	So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,
113.084	that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials
118.255	and the built environment.
119.932	And I don't mean automated machines.
122.118	I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.
124.577	But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.
128.461	And that's called self-assembly,
130.517	which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure
135.034	through only local interaction.
137.527	So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?
140.702	We need a few simple ingredients.
142.677	The first ingredient is materials and geometry,
145.516	and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.
148.985	And you can use passive energy --
150.643	so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.
155.327	And then you need smartly designed interactions.
158.402	And those interactions allow for error correction,
160.535	and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.
164.535	So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,
167.767	from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional
171.051	and even four-dimensional systems.
174.118	So in one-dimensional systems --
176.004	this is a project called the self-folding proteins.
178.911	And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --
183.618	in this case it's the crambin protein --
186.299	you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --
189.945	and you break that down into a series of components.
193.096	And then we embed elastic.
195.37	And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,
197.711	it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
202.562	And this gives us a tangible model
204.662	of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds
208.396	and all of the intricacies of the geometry.
210.68	So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.
214.128	And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --
216.93	so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.
221.229	In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal
225.682	with Autodesk and Arthur Olson
227.646	where we looked at autonomous parts --
229.344	so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.
233.663	And we built 500 of these glass beakers.
236.429	They had different molecular structures inside
238.896	and different colors that could be mixed and matched.
241.12	And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.
243.369	And so these became intuitive models
245.87	to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.
249.362	This is the polio virus.
251.179	You shake it hard and it breaks apart.
253.111	And then you shake it randomly
254.557	and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.
258.061	And this is demonstrating that through random energy,
261.028	we can build non-random shapes.
265.656	We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.
269.18	Last year at TED Long Beach,
271.334	we built an installation that builds installations.
274.545	The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?
278.082	So we built a large rotating chamber,
280.583	and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,
283.796	adding energy to the system
285.381	and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works
288.827	and how we could use this
290.206	as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.
294.952	So remember, I said 4D.
296.619	So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,
300.314	which is a collaboration with Stratasys,
302.2	and it's called 4D printing.
304.035	The idea behind 4D printing
305.995	is that you take multi-material 3D printing --
308.995	so you can deposit multiple materials --
311.184	and you add a new capability,
313.068	which is transformation,
314.934	that right off the bed,
316.251	the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
320.578	And this is like robotics without wires or motors.
324.078	So you completely print this part,
325.729	and it can transform into something else.
328.533	We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.
333.494	And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior
336.617	and try to optimize which parts are folding when.
339.819	But most importantly, we can use this same software
342.549	for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems
345.457	and human scale self-assembly systems.
348.3	These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.
351.813	Here's the first demonstration.
353.53	A single strand dipped in water
355.434	that completely self-folds on its own
357.783	into the letters M I T.
361.701	I'm biased.
363.523	This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank
366.972	that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.
371.595	So no human interaction.
373.446	And we think this is the first time
375.335	that a program and transformation
377.582	has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.
380.832	And it also might just be the manufacturing technique
383.562	that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.
387.696	So I know you're probably thinking,
388.882	okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?
393.114	So I've started a lab at MIT,
395.369	and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.
397.251	And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials
400.395	for the built environment.
401.586	And we think there's a few key sectors
403.549	that have fairly near-term applications.
405.863	One of those is in extreme environments.
407.918	These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,
410.464	our current construction techniques don't work,
412.952	it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.
416.512	And space is a great example of that.
418.879	We're trying to design new scenarios for space
421.245	that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures
424.545	that can go from highly functional systems from one to another.
428.235	Let's go back to infrastructure.
430.346	In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.
434.245	And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.
437.045	Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract
440.668	to change capacity or change flow rate,
443.418	or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.
447.952	So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.
450.562	This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.
454.845	So I want to remind you today
456.66	of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.
460.044	These are complex things built with complex parts
463.509	that come together in complex ways.
466.294	So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from
469.493	to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,
473.546	how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,
477.245	so that we can go from a world like this
480.32	to a world that's more like this.
492.632	Thank you.
494.542	(Applause)
