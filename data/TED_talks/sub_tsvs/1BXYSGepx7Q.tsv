12.85	So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?
15.883	I would be shocked if you hadn't.
18.509	This is a technology --
18.509	it's for genome editing --
21.735	and it's so versatile and so controversial
24.593	that it's sparking all sorts
24.593	of really interesting conversations.
28.631	Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?
31.281	Should we edit a human embryo?
34.041	And my personal favorite:
36.997	How can we justify
36.997	wiping out an entire species
40.672	that we consider harmful to humans
43.14	off the face of the Earth,
44.466	using this technology?
47.165	This type of science
47.165	is moving much faster
50.472	than the regulatory mechanisms
50.472	that govern it.
53.34	And so, for the past six years,
55.431	I've made it my personal mission
57.863	to make sure that as many people
57.863	as possible understand
60.897	these types of technologies
60.897	and their implications.
64.021	Now, CRISPR has been the subject
64.021	of a huge media hype,
69.089	and the words that are used most often
69.089	"are ""easy"" and ""cheap."""
74.337	So what I want to do is drill down
74.337	a little bit deeper
77.5	and look into some of the myths
77.5	and the realities around CRISPR.
82.954	If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,
85.594	the first thing that you have to do
85.594	is damage the DNA.
89.098	The damage comes in the form
89.098	of a double-strand break
92.164	through the double helix.
93.752	And then the cellular repair
93.752	processes kick in,
97.088	and then we convince
97.088	those repair processes
99.751	to make the edit that we want,
102.054	and not a natural edit.
103.62	That's how it works.
105.929	It's a two-part system.
107.676	You've got a Cas9 protein
107.676	and something called a guide RNA.
111.071	I like to think of it as a guided missile.
113.557	So the Cas9 --
113.557	I love to anthropomorphize --
116.227	so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing
119.481	that wants to chew DNA,
121.05	and the guide RNA is the leash
121.05	that's keeping it out of the genome
125.23	until it finds the exact spot
125.23	where it matches.
128.912	And the combination of those two
128.912	is called CRISPR.
131.83	It's a system that we stole
133.422	from an ancient, ancient
133.422	bacterial immune system.
137.469	The part that's amazing about it
137.469	is that the guide RNA,
142.041	only 20 letters of it,
143.956	are what target the system.
146.57	This is really easy to design,
148.737	and it's really cheap to buy.
150.985	So that's the part
150.985	that is modular in the system;
155.014	everything else stays the same.
157.481	This makes it a remarkably easy
157.481	and powerful system to use.
162.047	The guide RNA and the Cas9
162.047	protein complex together
166.311	go bouncing along the genome,
168.267	and when they find a spot
168.267	where the guide RNA matches,
171.784	then it inserts between the two strands
171.784	of the double helix,
174.663	it rips them apart,
176.692	that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,
179.962	and all of a sudden,
181.816	you've got a cell that's in total panic
183.74	because now it's got a piece
183.74	of DNA that's broken.
187	What does it do?
188.32	It calls its first responders.
190.959	There are two major repair pathways.
193.605	The first just takes the DNA
193.605	and shoves the two pieces back together.
198.698	This isn't a very efficient system,
200.82	because what happens is
200.82	sometimes a base drops out
203.573	or a base is added.
205.024	It's an OK way to maybe, like,
205.024	knock out a gene,
208.841	but it's not the way that we really want
208.841	to do genome editing.
212.098	The second repair pathway
212.098	is a lot more interesting.
215.017	In this repair pathway,
216.677	it takes a homologous piece of DNA.
219.382	And now mind you, in a diploid
219.382	organism like people,
222.046	we've got one copy of our genome
222.046	from our mom and one from our dad,
226.318	so if one gets damaged,
227.617	it can use the other
227.617	chromosome to repair it.
230.036	So that's where this comes from.
232.518	The repair is made,
234.006	and now the genome is safe again.
236.616	The way that we can hijack this
238.497	is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,
242.229	a piece that has homology on both ends
244.397	but is different in the middle.
246.12	So now, you can put
246.12	whatever you want in the center
248.611	and the cell gets fooled.
250.15	So you can change a letter,
252.293	you can take letters out,
253.582	but most importantly,
253.582	you can stuff new DNA in,
256.53	kind of like a Trojan horse.
259.089	CRISPR is going to be amazing,
261.298	in terms of the number of different
261.298	scientific advances
264.94	that it's going to catalyze.
266.621	The thing that's special about it
266.621	is this modular targeting system.
269.866	I mean, we've been shoving DNA
269.866	into organisms for years, right?
273.657	But because of the modular
273.657	targeting system,
275.808	we can actually put it
275.808	exactly where we want it.
279.423	The thing is that there's
279.423	a lot of talk about it being cheap
285.116	and it being easy.
286.882	And I run a community lab.
290.242	I'm starting to get emails from people
290.242	that say stuff like,
293.822	"""Hey, can I come to your open night"
296.243	and, like, maybe use CRISPR
296.243	"and engineer my genome?"""
299.884	(Laugher)
301.018	Like, seriously.
303.376	"I'm, ""No, you can't."""
305.203	(Laughter)
306.237	"""But I've heard it's cheap."
306.237	"I've heard it's easy."""
308.616	We're going to explore that a little bit.
310.823	So, how cheap is it?
312.796	Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.
315.665	It's going to take the cost of the average
315.665	materials for an experiment
319.308	from thousands of dollars
319.308	to hundreds of dollars,
321.864	and it cuts the time a lot, too.
323.824	It can cut it from weeks to days.
326.246	That's great.
327.762	You still need a professional lab
327.762	to do the work in;
330.476	you're not going to do anything meaningful
330.476	outside of a professional lab.
334.012	I mean, don't listen to anyone who says
336.04	you can do this sort of stuff
336.04	on your kitchen table.
339.421	It's really not easy
339.421	to do this kind of work.
343.953	Not to mention,
343.953	there's a patent battle going on,
346.285	so even if you do invent something,
348.135	the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley
348.135	are in this incredible patent battle.
354.795	It's really fascinating
354.795	to watch it happen,
357.207	because they're accusing each other
357.207	of fraudulent claims
360.479	and then they've got people saying,
362.234	"""Oh, well, I signed"
362.234	"my notebook here or there."""
365.042	This isn't going to be settled for years.
367.167	And when it is,
368.351	you can bet you're going to pay someone
368.351	a really hefty licensing fee
371.66	in order to use this stuff.
373.343	So, is it really cheap?
375.148	Well, it's cheap if you're doing
375.148	basic research and you've got a lab.
381.22	How about easy?
381.22	Let's look at that claim.
384.417	The devil is always in the details.
387.881	We don't really know
387.881	that much about cells.
391.036	They're still kind of black boxes.
392.73	For example, we don't know
392.73	why some guide RNAs work really well
397.614	and some guide RNAs don't.
399.701	We don't know why some cells
399.701	want to do one repair pathway
403.193	and some cells would rather do the other.
406.27	And besides that,
407.578	there's the whole problem
407.578	of getting the system into the cell
410.471	in the first place.
411.759	In a petri dish, that's not that hard,
413.785	but if you're trying to do it
413.785	on a whole organism,
416.254	it gets really tricky.
418.224	It's OK if you use something
418.224	like blood or bone marrow --
421.434	those are the targets
421.434	of a lot of research now.
423.685	There was a great story
423.685	of some little girl
425.96	who they saved from leukemia
427.636	by taking the blood out, editing it,
427.636	and putting it back
430.334	with a precursor of CRISPR.
432.869	And this is a line of research
432.869	that people are going to do.
435.689	But right now, if you want to get
435.689	into the whole body,
438.266	you're probably going
438.266	to have to use a virus.
440.434	So you take the virus,
440.434	you put the CRISPR into it,
442.831	you let the virus infect the cell.
444.561	But now you've got this virus in there,
446.728	and we don't know what the long-term
446.728	effects of that are.
449.44	Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,
451.732	a very small percentage,
451.732	but they're still there.
454.717	What's going to happen
454.717	over time with that?
458.039	These are not trivial questions,
460.275	and there are scientists
460.275	that are trying to solve them,
462.939	and they will eventually,
462.939	hopefully, be solved.
465.249	But it ain't plug-and-play,
465.249	not by a long shot.
468.907	So: Is it really easy?
471.032	Well, if you spend a few years
471.032	working it out in your particular system,
475.389	yes, it is.
477.426	Now the other thing is,
479.534	we don't really know that much about how
479.534	to make a particular thing happen
485.917	by changing particular spots
485.917	in the genome.
489.306	We're a long way away from figuring out
491.497	how to give a pig wings, for example.
494.364	Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle
494.364	for an extra leg.
497.252	That would be kind of cool, right?
498.922	But what is happening
500.482	is that CRISPR is being used
500.482	by thousands and thousands of scientists
504.856	to do really, really important work,
507.252	like making better models
507.252	of diseases in animals, for example,
512.72	or for taking pathways
512.72	that produce valuable chemicals
517.726	and getting them into industrial
517.726	production in fermentation vats,
522.021	or even doing really basic research
522.021	on what genes do.
526.022	This is the story of CRISPR
526.022	we should be telling,
528.975	and I don't like it
528.975	that the flashier aspects of it
532.463	are drowning all of this out.
534.243	Lots of scientists did a lot of work
534.243	to make CRISPR happen,
538.841	and what's interesting to me
540.484	is that these scientists
540.484	are being supported by our society.
545.423	Think about it.
546.606	We've got an infrastructure that allows
546.606	a certain percentage of people
550.983	to spend all their time doing research.
554.984	That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,
558.998	and I would say that makes us all
558.998	the shepherds of CRISPR.
563.49	We all have a responsibility.
565.749	So I would urge you to really learn
565.749	about these types of technologies,
570.01	because, really, only in that way
572.415	are we going to be able to guide
572.415	the development of these technologies,
576.791	the use of these technologies
578.747	and make sure that, in the end,
578.747	it's a positive outcome --
583.034	for both the planet and for us.
586.698	Thanks.
587.914	(Applause)
