12.802	I moved back home 15 years ago
16.577	after a 20-year stay in the United States,
19.441	and Africa called me back.
21.805	And I founded my country's first
25.346	graphic design and new media college.
27.657	And I called it the Zimbabwe
27.657	Institute of Vigital Arts.
32.583	The idea, the dream, was really
32.583	for a sort of Bauhaus
36.82	sort of school where new
36.82	ideas were interrogated
41.426	and investigated,
44.639	the creation of a new visual language
47.399	based on the African creative heritage.
52.38	We offer a two-year diploma
55.805	to talented students who have
55.805	successfully completed
59.569	their high school education.
61.749	And typography's a very important
61.749	part of the curriculum
64.686	and we encourage our students
64.686	to look inward for influence.
69.629	Here's a poster designed
69.629	by one of the students
71.995	"under the theme ""Education is a right."""
76.152	Some logos designed by my students.
80.435	Africa has had a long
80.435	tradition of writing,
84.503	but this is not such a well-known fact,
86.675	"and I wrote the book ""Afrikan"
86.675	"Alphabets"" to address that."
90.608	The different types of writing in Africa,
94.155	first was proto-writing,
96.4	as illustrated by Nsibidi,
98.568	which is the writing
98.568	system of a secret society
101.64	of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.
105.47	So it's a special-interest writing system.
109.34	The Akan of people of Ghana
109.34	and [Cote d'Ivoire]
112.915	developed Adinkra symbols
112.915	some 400 years ago,
116.96	and these are proverbs,
116.96	historical sayings,
120.828	objects, animals, plants,
123.538	and my favorite Adinkra system
125.546	is the first one at the top on the left.
127.922	It's called Sankofa.
128.924	"It means, ""Return and get"
128.924	"it."" Learn from the past."
134.918	This pictograph by the Jokwe
134.918	people of Angola
137.719	tells the story
137.719	of the creation of the world.
141.538	At the top is God,
141.538	at the bottom is man, mankind,
146.942	and on the left is the sun,
146.942	on the right is the moon.
151.85	All the paths lead to and from God.
155.705	These secret societies
155.705	of the Yoruba, Kongo
160.099	and Palo religions
162.294	in Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,
166.031	developed this intricate writing system
169.955	which is alive and well
169.955	today in the New World
173.724	in Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.
179.912	In the rainforests of the Democratic
179.912	Republic of Congo,
183.208	in the Ituri society,
186.099	the men pound out a cloth
186.099	out of a special tree,
189.87	and the women, who are also
189.87	the praise singers,
192.963	paint interweaving patterns
195.644	that are the same in structure
198.374	as the polyphonic structures
198.374	that they use in their singing --
203.029	a sort of a musical score, if you may.
207.017	In South Africa, Ndebele women
209.766	use these symbols and other
209.766	geometric patterns
213.124	to paint their homes in bright colors,
216.938	and the Zulu women use the symbols
219.86	in the beads that they weave
221.358	into bracelets and necklaces.
224.501	Ethiopia has had the longest
224.501	tradition of writing,
228.58	with the Ethiopic script
228.58	that was developed
230.899	in the fourth century A.D.
232.861	and is used to write Amharic,
235.375	which is spoken by over 24 million people.
238.66	King Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum
238.66	Kingdom of Cameroon
243.117	developed Shü-mom at the age of 25.
246.682	Shü-mom is a writing system.
248.769	It's a syllabary. It's not
248.769	exactly an alphabet.
251.762	And here we see
251.762	three stages of development
255.077	that it went through in 30 years.
259.716	The Vai people of Liberia had
259.716	a long tradition of literacy
265.276	before their first contact
265.276	with Europeans in the 1800s.
269.211	It's a syllabary and reads
269.211	from left to right.
273.793	Next door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende
277.364	also developed a syllabary,
279.387	but theirs reads from right to left.
283.019	Africa has had a long tradition of design,
286.409	a well-defined design sensibility,
290.032	but the problem in Africa has been that,
292.334	especially today, designers in Africa
295.032	struggle with all forms of design
297.566	because they are more apt to look outward
302.072	for influence and inspiration.
304.7	The creative spirit in Africa,
304.7	the creative tradition,
308.897	is as potent as it has always been,
311.773	if only designers could look within.
315.82	This Ethiopic cross illustrates
318.711	what Dr. Ron Eglash has established:
321.491	that Africa has a lot
321.491	to contribute to computing
325.38	and mathematics through their intuitive
325.38	grasp of fractals.
330.756	Africans of antiquity
330.756	created civilization,
334.823	and their monuments,
334.823	which still stand today,
338.136	are a true testimony of their greatness.
341.72	Most probably,
341.72	one of humanity's greatest achievements
345.638	is the invention of the alphabet,
348.604	and that has been attributed
348.604	to Mesopotamia
351.722	with their invention
351.722	of cuneiform in 1600 BC,
357.287	followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,
361.025	and that story has been cast
361.025	in stone as historical fact.
366.494	That is, until 1998,
369.208	when one Yale professor
369.208	John Coleman Darnell
374.327	discovered these inscriptions
374.327	in the Thebes desert
377.717	on the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,
381.077	and these have been dated
381.077	at between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,
387.313	centuries before Mesopotamia.
390.322	Called Wadi el-Hol
393.25	because of the place
393.25	that they were discovered,
396.456	these inscriptions --
396.456	research is still going on,
399.861	a few of them have been deciphered,
402.659	but there is consensus among scholars
405.166	that this is really
405.166	humanity's first alphabet.
410.383	Over here, you see a paleographic chart
413.427	that shows what has
413.427	been deciphered so far,
416.544	starting with the letter
416.544	"A, ""ālep,"" at the top,"
419.953	"and ""bêt,"" in the middle, and so forth."
423.638	It is time that students
423.638	of design in Africa
427.251	read the works of titans
427.251	like Cheikh Anta Diop,
431.468	Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop,
433.584	whose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated
436.667	by this discovery.
439.8	The last word goes
439.8	to the great Jamaican leader
442.887	Marcus Mosiah Garvey
444.876	and the Akan people of Ghana
448.076	with their Adinkra symbol Sankofa,
450.449	which encourages us to go to the past
452.691	so as to inform our present
454.863	and build on a future
454.863	for us and our children.
459.465	It is also time that designers in Africa
463.706	stop looking outside.
466.332	They've been looking
466.332	outward for a long time,
468.722	yet what they were looking for
471.034	has been right there
471.034	within grasp, right within them.
475.987	Thank you very much.
477.791	(Applause)
