14.24	So this right here
15.76	is the tiny village of Elle,
15.76	close to Lista.
19.84	It's right at the southernmost
19.84	tip of Norway.
23.32	And on January 2 this year,
25.76	an elderly guy who lives in the village,
28	he went out to see what was cast ashore
30.92	during a recent storm.
34.08	And on a patch of grass
34.08	right next to the water's edge,
37.32	he found a wetsuit.
39.92	It was grey and black,
39.92	and he thought it looked cheap.
44.24	Out of each leg of the wetsuit
46.32	there were sticking two white bones.
50.12	It was clearly the remains
50.12	of a human being.
54.16	And usually, in Norway,
54.16	dead people are identified quickly.
57.32	So the police started searching
58.88	through missing reports
58.88	from the local area,
61	national missing reports,
62.24	and looked for accidents
62.24	with a possible connection.
64.72	They found nothing.
66.92	So they ran a DNA profile,
68.44	and they started searching
68.44	internationally through Interpol.
71.6	Nothing.
74.24	This was a person
74.24	that nobody seemed to be missing.
78.52	It was an invisible life
78.52	heading for a nameless grave.
84	But then, after a month,
85.76	the police in Norway got a message
85.76	from the police in the Netherlands.
90.08	A couple of months earlier,
90.08	they had found a body,
92.72	in an identical wetsuit,
92.72	and they had no idea who this person was.
97.791	But the police in the Netherlands
97.791	managed to trace the wetsuit
100.72	by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.
104.12	So they were then able to tell
106.32	that both wetsuits were bought
106.32	by the same customer at the same time,
111.68	October 7, 2014,
114.16	in the French city of Calais
114.16	by the English Channel.
117.76	But this was all
117.76	they were able to figure out.
120.96	The customer paid cash.
122.64	There was no surveillance
122.64	footage from the shop.
125.28	So it became a cold case.
127.84	We heard this story,
129.08	and it triggered me and my colleague,
129.08	photographer Tomm Christiansen,
132.343	and we of course had the obvious question:
132.343	who were these people?
135.44	At the time, I'd barely
135.44	heard about Calais,
137.464	but it took about two
137.464	or three seconds to figure out
140.32	Calais is basically known for two things.
143.28	It's the spot in continental Europe
143.28	closest to Britain,
146.12	and a lot of migrants and refugees
146.12	are staying in this camp
149.68	and are trying desperately
149.68	to cross over to Britain.
152.92	And right there was a plausible theory
152.92	about the identity of the two people,
157.88	and the police made this theory as well.
160.28	Because if you or I or anybody else
160.28	with a firm connection to Europe
163.495	goes missing off the coast of France,
163.495	people would just know.
166.72	Your friends or family
166.72	would report you missing,
169	the police would come search for you,
169	the media would know,
171.8	and there would be
171.8	pictures of you on lampposts.
174.08	It's difficult to disappear
174.08	without a trace.
177.12	But if you just fled the war in Syria,
179	and your family,
179	if you have any family left,
182	don't necessarily know where you are,
184.08	and you're staying here illegally
186.12	amongst thousands of others
186.12	who come and go every day.
189.44	Well, if you disappear one day,
189.44	nobody will notice.
193.6	The police won't come search for you
193.6	because nobody knows you're gone.
198.16	And this is what happened
198.16	to Shadi Omar Kataf
200.92	and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
204.768	Me and Tomm went to Calais
204.768	for the first time in April this year,
207.84	and after three months of investigation,
207.84	we were able to tell the story
211.2	about how these two young men
211.2	fled the war in Syria,
214	ended up stuck in Calais,
215.76	bought wetsuits and drowned
215.76	in what seems to have been an attempt
219.16	to swim across the English Channel
219.16	in order to reach England.
223.28	It is a story about the fact
223.28	that everybody has a name,
226.52	everybody has a story,
226.52	everybody is someone.
229.48	But it is also a story about what
229.48	it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.
235.12	So this is where we started our search.
237.08	This is in Calais.
238.6	Right now, between 3,500
238.6	and 5,000 people are living here
241.72	under horrible conditions.
243.32	It has been dubbed
243.32	the worst refugee camp in Europe.
246.32	Limited access to food,
246.32	limited access to water,
249.4	limited access to health care.
250.92	Disease and infections are widespread.
253.92	And they're all stuck here
253.92	because they're trying to get to England
257.12	in order to claim asylum.
258.56	And they do that by hiding in the back
258.56	of trucks headed for the ferry,
262.12	or the Eurotunnel,
264.44	or they sneak inside
264.44	the tunnel terminal at night
266.8	to try to hide on the trains.
269.519	Most want to go to Britain
269.519	because they know the language,
272.48	and so they figure it would be easier
272.48	to restart their lives from there.
276	They want to work, they want to study,
277.84	they want to be able
277.84	to continue their lives.
280	A lot of these people are
280	highly educated and skilled workers.
282.96	If you go to Calais and talk to refugees,
282.96	you'll meet lawyers, politicians,
286.52	engineers, graphic designers,
286.52	farmers, soldiers.
289.2	You've got the whole spectrum.
291.52	But who all of these people are
293.92	usually gets lost in the way
293.92	we talk about refugees and migrants,
298.4	because we usually do that in statistics.
301.44	So you have 60 million refugees globally.
303.64	About half a million
303.64	have made the crossing
305.68	over the Mediterranean
305.68	into Europe so far this year,
308.16	and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.
310.44	But these are numbers,
311.96	and the numbers don't say anything
311.96	about who these people are,
315.8	where they came from, or why they're here.
319.64	And first, I want to tell you
319.64	about one of them.
322.52	This is 22-year-old
322.52	Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
326.12	We first heard about him
326.12	after being in Calais the first time
329.04	looking for answers to the theory
329.04	of the two dead bodies.
331.84	And after a while, we heard this story
334	about a Syrian man
334	who was living in Bradford in England,
337.32	and had been desperately searching
337.32	for his nephew Mouaz for months.
341.12	And it turned out the last time
341.12	anybody had heard anything from Mouaz
345.12	was October 7, 2014.
347.8	That was the same date
347.8	the wetsuits were bought.
351.24	So we flew over there and we met the uncle
353.4	and we did DNA samples of him,
355.52	and later on got additional DNA samples
355.52	from Mouaz's closest relative
358.84	who now lives in Jordan.
360.6	The analysis concluded
362.72	the body who was found in a wetsuit
362.72	on a beach in the Netherlands
366.24	was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.
369.72	And while we were doing
369.72	all this investigation,
372.24	we got to know Mouaz's story.
375.32	He was born in the Syrian capital
375.32	of Damascus in 1991.
379.24	He was raised in a middle class family,
381.122	and his father in the middle there
381.122	is a chemical engineer
383.813	who spent 11 years in prison for belonging
383.813	to the political opposition in Syria.
388.12	While his father was in prison,
389.76	Mouaz took responsibility
389.76	and he cared for his three sisters.
393.04	They said he was that kind of guy.
395.04	Mouaz studied to become
395.04	an electrical engineer
397.84	at the University of Damascus.
400.44	So a couple of years into the Syrian war,
402.44	the family fled Damascus and went
402.44	to the neighboring country, Jordan.
406.6	Their father had problems
406.6	finding work in Jordan,
409.16	and Mouaz could not continue his studies,
411.16	"so he figured, ""OK, the best thing"
411.16	I can do to help my family
414.48	would be to go somewhere
414.48	where I can finish my studies
417.24	"and find work."""
418.8	So he goes to Turkey.
420.24	In Turkey, he's not accepted
420.24	at a university,
423.44	and once he had left Jordan as a refugee,
423.44	he was not allowed to reenter.
428.24	So then he decides to head for the UK,
430.88	where his uncle lives.
432.44	He makes it into Algeria,
432.44	walks into Libya,
435.6	pays a people smuggler to help him
435.6	with the crossing into Italy by boat,
439.44	and from there on he heads to Dunkirk,
441.36	the city right next to Calais
441.36	by the English Channel.
445.955	We know he made at least 12 failed
445.955	attempts to cross the English Channel
449.36	by hiding in a truck.
451.52	But at some point,
451.52	he must have given up all hope.
455.36	The last night we know he was alive,
457.44	he spent at a cheap hotel
457.44	close to the train station in Dunkirk.
461.52	We found his name in the records,
461.52	and he seems to have stayed there alone.
465.68	The day after, he went into Calais,
465.68	entered a sports shop
469.64	a couple of minutes
469.64	before 8 o'clock in the evening,
472.12	along with Shadi Kataf.
473.68	They both bought wetsuits,
475.72	and the woman in the shop
477.16	was the last person we know of
477.16	to have seen them alive.
481.76	We have tried to figure out
481.76	where Shadi met Mouaz,
485.08	but we weren't able to do that.
487.52	But they do have a similar story.
489.64	We first heard about Shadi
489.64	after a cousin of his, living in Germany,
493.56	had read an Arabic translation
493.56	of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.
498.04	So we got in touch with him.
500.92	Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,
503.48	was also raised in Damascus.
505.88	He was a working kind of guy.
507.44	He ran a tire repair shop
507.44	and later worked in a printing company.
510.88	He lived with his extended family,
512.8	but their house got bombed
512.8	early in the war.
515.76	So the family fled to an area
515.76	of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.
523.04	Yarmouk is being described
523.04	as the worst place to live
526.96	on planet Earth.
529.24	They've been bombed by the military,
529.24	they've been besieged,
532.039	they've been stormed by ISIS
533.445	and they've been cut off
533.445	from supplies for years.
536.32	There was a UN official
536.32	who visited last year,
538.487	"and he said, ""They ate all the grass"
538.487	"so there was no grass left."""
545.44	Out of a population of 150,000,
547.84	only 18,000 are believed
547.84	to still be left in Yarmouk.
551.96	Shadi and his sisters got out.
554.04	The parents are still stuck inside.
558.4	So Shadi and one of his sisters,
558.4	they fled to Libya.
561.96	This was after the fall of Gaddafi,
563.651	but before Libya turned
563.651	into full-blown civil war.
568	And in this last remaining
568	sort of stability in Libya,
571.48	Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed
571.48	to spend most of his time underwater.
577.8	He fell completely in love with the ocean,
580.68	so when he finally decided
580.68	that he could no longer be in Libya,
583.92	late August 2014,
586.2	he hoped to find work
586.2	as a diver when he reached Italy.
590.6	Reality was not that easy.
593.52	We don't know much about his travels
595.36	because he had a hard time
595.36	communicating with his family,
598.08	but we do know that he struggled.
600.12	And by the end of September,
601.52	he was living on the streets
601.52	somewhere in France.
604.84	On October 7, he calls
604.84	his cousin in Belgium,
607.88	and explains his situation.
609.88	"He said, ""I'm in Calais. I need you"
609.88	to come get my backpack and my laptop.
615.08	I can't afford to pay the people smugglers
615.08	to help me with the crossing to Britain,
619.04	but I will go buy a wetsuit
619.04	"and I will swim."""
622.56	His cousin, of course,
622.56	tried to warn him not to,
625.04	but Shadi's battery
625.04	on the phone went flat,
627.2	and his phone was never switched on again.
631.52	What was left of Shadi
631.52	was found nearly three months later,
637.56	in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.
640.56	He's still waiting
640.56	for his funeral in Norway,
642.72	and none of his family
642.72	will be able to attend.
647.08	Many may think that the story
647.08	about Shadi and Mouaz
649.64	is a story about death,
652.8	but I don't agree.
654.04	To me, this is a story about two questions
654.04	that I think we all share:
659.52	what is a better life,
661.32	and what am I willing to do to achieve it?
664.76	And to me, and probably a lot of you,
666.56	a better life would mean
668.16	being able to do more
668.16	of what we think of as meaningful,
671.08	whether that be spending more time
671.08	with your family and friends,
674.104	travel to an exotic place,
675.64	or just getting money
675.64	to buy that cool new device
678	or a pair of new sneakers.
679.72	And this is all
679.72	within our reach pretty easily.
683.84	But if you are fleeing a war zone,
685.8	the answers to those two questions
685.8	are dramatically different.
689.8	A better life is a life in safety.
692.08	It's a life in dignity.
694.44	A better life means
694.44	not having your house bombed,
697.12	not fearing being kidnapped.
698.68	It means being able
698.68	to send your children to school,
701.133	go to university,
702.32	or just find work to be able to provide
702.32	for yourself and the ones you love.
706.76	A better life would be
706.76	a future of some possibilities
710.4	compared to nearly none,
712.72	and that's a strong motivation.
715.48	And I have no trouble imagining
717.6	that after spending weeks or even months
721.12	as a second-grade citizen,
723.04	living on the streets
723.04	or in a horrible makeshift camp
727.2	with a stupid, racist name
727.2	"like ""The Jungle,"""
730.68	most of us would be willing
730.68	to do just about anything.
735.2	If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz
737.48	the second they stepped into the freezing
737.48	waters of the English Channel,
741.56	they would probably say,
741.56	"""This is worth the risk,"""
745.16	because they could
745.16	no longer see any other option.
749.4	And that's desperation,
751.68	but that's the reality of living
751.68	as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.
757.76	Thank you.
759	(Applause)
769.91	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.
771.58	This is Tomm Christiansen,
772.84	who took most of the pictures you have
772.84	seen and they've done reporting together.
777.68	Tomm, you two have been
777.68	back to Calais recently.
780.08	This was the third trip.
781.72	It was after the publication
781.72	of the article.
783.8	What has changed?
783.8	What have you seen there?
785.96	Tomm Christiansen:
785.96	The first time we were in Calais,
788.413	it was about 1,500 refugees there.
790.08	They had a difficult time,
790.08	but they were positive, they had hope.
793.76	The last time, the camp has grown,
793.76	maybe four or five thousand people.
798.8	It seemed more permanent,
798.8	NGOs have arrived,
801.4	a small school has opened.
803.24	But the thing is that the refugees
803.24	have stayed for a longer time,
806.64	and the French government has managed
806.64	to seal off the borders better,
811.56	so now The Jungle is growing,
814.64	along with the despair
814.64	and hopelessness among the refugees.
818.88	BG: Are you planning to go back?
818.88	And continue the reporting?
823.6	TC: Yes.
824.84	BG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,
826.88	and to me, it's amazing
826.88	that in the current climate
829.32	of slashing budgets
829.32	and publishers in crisis,
831.88	Dagbladet has consented
831.88	so many resources for this story,
835.8	which tells a lot about newspapers
835.8	taking the responsibility,
838.682	but how did you sell it to your editors?
842.36	Anders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,
844.4	because we weren't able to know
844.4	what we actually could figure out.
848.4	As soon as it became clear
849.68	that we actually could be able
849.68	to identify who the first one was,
854.16	we basically got the message
854.16	that we could do whatever we wanted,
857.24	just travel wherever you need to go,
857.24	do whatever you need to do,
860.28	just get this done.
863.72	BG: That's an editor
863.72	taking responsibility.
866.08	The story, by the way,
866.08	has been translated and published
868.724	across several European countries,
868.724	and certainly will continue to do.
872	And we want to read the updates from you.
872	Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.
875.56	(Applause)
