25	You'll be happy to know that
25	I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,
29.956	but other people's tragedy.
31.281	It's a lot easier to be lighthearted
31.281	about other people's tragedy
34.374	than your own,
35.549	and I want to keep it
35.549	in the spirit of the conference.
40.069	So, if you believe the media accounts,
42.262	being a drug dealer in the height
42.262	of the crack cocaine epidemic
46.839	was a very glamorous life,
46.839	in the words of Virginia Postrel.
50.689	There was money,
50.689	there was drugs, guns, women,
54.892	you know, you name it -- jewelry,
54.892	bling-bling -- it had it all.
59.181	What I'm going to tell you today is that,
59.181	in fact, based on 10 years of research,
64.669	a unique opportunity
64.669	to go inside a gang --
67.152	to see the actual books,
67.152	the financial records of the gang --
70.084	that the answer turns out not to be
72.476	that being in the gang
72.476	was a glamorous life.
76	But I think, more realistically,
76	that being in a gang --
78.775	selling drugs for a gang -- is perhaps
78.775	the worst job in all of America.
82.705	And that's what I'd like
82.705	to convince you of today.
85.594	So there are three things I want to do.
87.529	First, I want to explain
87.529	how and why crack cocaine
91.261	had such a profound influence
91.261	on inner-city gangs.
96.794	Secondly, I want to tell you
98.625	how somebody like me
98.625	came to be able to see
103.525	the inner workings of a gang --
103.525	an interesting story, I think.
106.906	And then third, I want to tell you,
106.906	in a very superficial way,
109.84	about some of the things we found
111.451	when we actually got to look
111.451	at the financial records,
114.039	the books, of the gang.
115.751	So before I do that, just one warning,
119.204	which is that this presentation
119.204	has been rated 'R'
122.962	by the Motion Picture
122.962	Association of America.
125.552	It contains adult themes, adult language.
128.71	Given who is up on the stage,
128.71	you'll be delighted to know
131.434	that, in fact, there'll be no nudity --
134	(Laughter)
136.417	Unexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.
139.024	(Laughter)
143.962	So let me start by talking
143.962	about crack cocaine,
147.519	and how it transformed the gang.
149.501	To do that, you have to actually go
149.501	back to a time before crack cocaine,
152.929	in the early '80s, and look at it
152.929	from the perspective of a gang leader.
156.363	Being a gang leader in the inner city
156.363	wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s --
162.327	the early '80s, let me say.
163.844	Now, you had a lot of power,
163.844	and you got to beat people up --
166.767	you got a lot of prestige,
166.767	a lot of respect.
169.323	But the thing is,
169.323	there was no money in it.
171.9	The gang had no way to make money.
173.585	You couldn't charge dues
173.585	to the people in the gang,
176.011	because the people in the gang
176.011	didn't have any money.
178.645	You couldn't really make any money
178.645	selling marijuana --
181.277	marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.
183.697	You can't get rich selling marijuana.
185.587	You couldn't sell cocaine;
187.402	cocaine's a great product --
187.402	powdered cocaine --
189.84	but you've got to know rich white people.
191.83	And most of the inner-city gang members
191.83	didn't know any rich white people,
195.347	so couldn't sell to that market.
196.91	You couldn't really do
196.91	petty crime, either.
198.954	Turns out, petty crime's
198.954	a terrible way to make a living.
201.653	As a result, as a gang leader,
201.653	you had, you know, power --
204.832	it's a pretty good life --
204.832	but the thing was, in the end,
207.547	you were living at home with your mother.
209.538	And so it wasn't really a career.
211.245	There were limits to how powerful
211.245	and important you could be
214.107	if you had to live at home
214.107	with your mother.
216.203	Then along comes crack cocaine.
219.306	And in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,
222.345	crack cocaine was the extra-chunky
222.345	version of tomato sauce
226.8	for the inner city.
227.975	(Laughter)
229	Because crack cocaine
229	was an unbelievable innovation.
231.528	I don't have time to talk about it today,
231.528	but if you think about it,
234.773	I would say that in the last 25 years,
236.64	of every invention or innovation
236.64	that's occurred in this country,
239.8	the biggest one in terms of impact
241.603	on the well-being of people
241.603	who live in the inner city,
245.493	was crack cocaine.
246.668	And for the worse --
246.668	not for the better, but for the worse.
249.473	It had a huge impact on life.
250.951	So what was it about crack cocaine?
252.839	It was a brilliant way
252.839	of getting the brain high.
257.434	Because you could smoke crack cocaine --
257.434	you can't smoke powdered cocaine --
263	and smoking is a much more efficient
263	mechanism of delivering a high
266.409	than snorting it.
267.936	And it turned out there was this audience
267.936	that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,
272.409	but when it came, it really did.
274.205	And it was a perfect drug;
275.634	you could buy the cocaine
275.634	that went into it for a dollar,
279.834	sell it for five dollars.
281.343	Highly addictive --
281.343	the high was very short.
283.695	So for fifteen minutes,
283.695	you get this great high,
286.391	and then when you come down,
287.772	all you want to do is get high again.
290.492	It created a wonderful market.
292.406	And for the people who were there
292.406	running the gang,
295.562	it was a great way, seemingly,
295.562	to make a lot of money.
299	At least for the people on the top.
301.209	So this is where we enter the picture.
303.091	Not really me -- I'm really
303.091	a bit player in all this.
305.62	My co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh,
305.62	is the main character.
308.509	He was a math major in college
308.509	who had a good heart,
314	and decided he wanted
314	to get a sociology PhD,
316.785	came to the University of Chicago.
318.438	Now, the three months
318.438	before he came to Chicago,
321.092	he had spent following the Grateful Dead.
323.647	And in his own words,
323.647	"he ""looked like a freak."""
327.138	He's a South Asian --
327.138	very dark-skinned South Asian.
331.35	Big man, and he had hair,
331.35	"in his words, ""down to his ass."""
335.795	Defied all kinds of boundaries:
337.538	Was he black or white?
337.538	Was he man or woman?
339.8	He was really a curious sight to be seen.
343	So he showed up
343	at the University of Chicago,
345.159	and the famous sociologist
345.159	William Julius Wilson
347.866	was doing a book that involved
347.866	surveying people all across Chicago.
353.514	He took one look at Sudhir, who was going
353.514	to go do some surveys for him,
357.162	and decided he knew exactly
357.162	the place to send him,
359.556	which was to one of the toughest,
359.556	most notorious housing projects
362.704	not just in Chicago,
362.704	but in the entire United States.
365.219	So Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never
365.219	really been in the inner city,
368.912	dutifully took his clipboard
368.912	and walked down to this housing project,
373.839	gets to the first building.
375.767	The first building?
375.767	Well, there's nobody there.
378.264	But he hears some voices
378.264	up in the stairwell,
381.418	so he climbs up the stairwell,
381.418	comes around the corner,
385	and finds a group of young
385	African-American men playing dice.
390.293	This is about 1990,
390.293	peak of the crack epidemic.
393.296	This is a very dangerous job,
393.296	being in a gang.
395.478	You don't like to be surprised.
397.017	You don't like to be surprised
397.017	by people who come around the corner.
400.554	And the mantra was:
400.554	shoot first; ask questions later.
403.902	Now, Sudhir was lucky --
403.902	he was such a freak,
406.108	and that clipboard
406.108	probably saved his life,
408.343	because they figured no other
408.343	rival gang member
410.59	would be coming up to shoot
410.59	at them with a clipboard.
413.109	(Laughter)
414.134	So his greeting was not particularly
414.134	warm, but they did say,
417.189	well, OK -- let's hear
417.189	your questions on your survey.
421.26	So -- I kid you not --
422.489	the first question on the survey
422.489	that he was sent to ask was:
426.3	"""How do you feel about being"
426.3	"poor and Black in America?"""
429.03	(Laughter)
432.185	Makes you wonder about academics.
433.9	(Laughter)
435.828	So the choice of answers were:
437.733	[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]
441.404	(Laughter)
443.429	What Sudhir found out is, in fact,
443.429	that the real answer was the following:
446.958	[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad
446.958	D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]
449.857	(Laughter)
451.478	The survey was not, in the end, going
451.478	to be what got Sudhir off the hook.
455.022	He was held hostage
455.022	overnight in the stairwell.
458.526	There was a lot of gunfire,
459.855	there were a lot of philosophical
459.855	discussions he had with the gang members.
463.498	By morning, the gang leader arrived,
465.272	checked out Sudhir,
465.272	decided he was no threat,
467.414	and they let him go home.
468.66	So Sudhir went home,
468.66	took a shower, took a nap.
471.812	And you and I, probably, faced
471.812	with the situation, would think,
476.635	"""I guess I'm going to write"
476.635	my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,
479.731	I've been following them
479.731	"for the last three months."""
482.194	(Laughter)
483.226	Sudhir, on the other hand,
484.509	got right back, walked
484.509	down to the housing project,
486.954	went up to the second floor,
488.321	"and said: ""Hey, guys, I had so much fun"
488.321	hanging out with you last night,
492.247	"I wonder if I could do it again tonight."""
494.249	And that was the beginning of what turned
494.249	out to be a beautiful relationship
497.904	that involved Sudhir living in the housing
497.904	project on and off for 10 years,
501.523	hanging out in crack houses,
501.523	going to jail with the gang members,
506.302	having the windows shot out of his car,
508.864	having the police break into his apartment
508.864	and steal his computer disks --
512.386	you name it.
513.568	But ultimately, the story
513.568	has a happy ending for Sudhir,
516.408	who became one of the most
516.408	respected sociologists in the country.
519.675	And especially for me,
521.068	as I sat in my office
521.068	with my Excel spreadsheet open,
524.511	waiting for Sudhir to come and deliver
524.511	to me the latest load of data
527.872	that he would get from the gang.
529.782	(Laughter)
533.575	It was one of the most unequal
533.575	co-authoring relationships ever --
537.003	(Laughter)
538.047	But I was glad to be
538.047	the beneficiary of it.
541.562	So what did we find?
543.389	What did we find in the gang?
545.771	Well, let me say one thing:
547.481	We really got access
547.481	to everybody in the gang.
551.108	We got an inside look at the gang,
551.108	from the very bottom up to the very top.
555.456	They trusted Sudhir, in ways
555.456	that really no academic has ever --
560.466	or really anybody, any outsider --
560.466	has ever earned the trust of these gangs,
565.042	to the point where they actually opened up
567.523	what was most interesting
567.523	for me -- their books,
569.804	the financial records they kept.
571.367	They made them available to us,
571.367	and we not only could study them,
574.463	but we could ask them questions
574.463	about what was in them.
577.083	So if I have to kind of summarize
577.083	very quickly in the short time I have
580.533	what the bottom line of what
580.533	I take away from the gang is,
584.507	it's that, if I had to draw
584.507	a parallel between the gang
587.241	and any other organization,
589.384	it would be that the gang
589.384	is just like McDonald's,
592.699	in a lot of different respects --
592.699	the restaurant McDonald's.
595.572	So first, in one way,
597.214	which isn't maybe the most interesting
597.214	way, but it's a good way to start --
600.853	is in the way it's organized,
600.853	the hierarchy of the gang,
603.523	the way it looks.
604.698	So here's what the org chart
604.698	of the gang looks like.
607.176	I don't know if you know much
607.176	about org charts,
609.407	but if you were to assign a stripped-down
609.407	and simplified McDonald's org chart,
613.138	this is exactly what it would look like.
615.116	It's amazing, but the top
615.116	level of the gang,
617.334	they actually call themselves
617.334	"the ""Board of Directors."""
619.985	(Laughter)
621.088	And Sudhir says
623.059	it's not like these guys
623.059	had a very sophisticated view
626.477	of what happened
626.477	in American corporate life,
629.966	but they had seen movies
629.966	"like ""Wall Street,"""
632.055	and they had learned a little bit
632.055	about what it was like
635.454	to be in the real world.
637.429	Now, below that board of directors,
639.287	you've got essentially
639.287	what are regional VPs --
641.716	people who control, say, the South Side
641.716	of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.
645.525	Sudhir got to know very well the guy
645.525	who had the unfortunate assignment
649	of trying to take the Iowa franchise,
651.363	which, it turned out, for this black gang,
653.448	was not one of the more brilliant
653.448	financial endeavors they undertook.
657.57	(Laughter)
658.848	But the thing that really makes the gang
658.848	seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.
663.168	The guys who are running
663.168	the local gangs --
667.532	the four-square-block
667.532	by four-square-block areas --
670.507	they're just like the guys, in some sense,
670.507	who are running the McDonald's.
674.033	They are the entrepreneurs.
675.526	They get the exclusive property rights
675.526	to control the drug-selling.
679.286	They get the name of the gang behind them,
679.286	for merchandising and marketing.
686.298	And they're the ones who basically
686.298	make the profit or lose a profit,
689.663	depending on how good
689.663	they are at running the business.
692.266	Now, the group I really want you
692.266	to think about, though,
695.195	are the ones at the bottom --
695.195	the foot soldiers.
697.472	These are the teenagers, typically,
699.544	who'd be standing out on the street
699.544	corner, selling the drugs.
702.592	Extremely dangerous work.
705.036	And important to note is that almost all
705.036	of the weight, all of the people
710.438	in this organization are at the bottom --
710.438	just like McDonald's.
713.519	So in some sense, the foot soldiers
713.519	are a lot like the people
716.503	who are taking your order at McDonald's,
718.493	and it's not just by chance
718.493	that they're like them.
720.955	In fact, in these neighborhoods,
720.955	they'd be the same people.
723.78	So the same kids who are working
723.78	in the gang were actually,
726.705	at the very same time,
726.705	typically working part-time
729.488	at a place like McDonald's.
731.043	Which already foreshadows
731.043	the main result that I've talked about,
734.458	about what a crappy job
734.458	it was, being in the gang.
737.572	Because obviously, if being in the gang
737.572	were such a wonderful, lucrative job,
741.247	why in the world would these guys
741.247	moonlight at McDonald's?
744.515	So what do the wages look like?
744.515	You might be surprised.
747.587	But based on being able to talk to them
747.587	and to see their records,
751.238	this is what it looks
751.238	like in terms of the wages.
753.732	The hourly wage the foot soldiers
753.732	were earning was $3.50 an hour.
757.846	It was below the minimum wage.
757.846	And this is well-documented.
761.259	It's easy to see by the patterns
761.259	of consumption they have.
764.146	It really is not fiction -- it's fact.
767.145	There was very little money in the gang,
767.145	especially at the bottom.
771	Now if you managed to rise up, say,
771	and be that local leader,
774.409	the guy who's the equivalent
774.409	of the McDonald's franchisee,
777.17	you'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.
779.079	And that, in some ways,
779.079	was the best job you could hope to get
782.429	if you were growing up in one of these
782.429	neighborhoods as a young black male.
786.111	If you managed to rise to the very top,
	is what you'd hope to make.
790.979	Truly, you would be a great success story.
793.732	And one of the sad parts
793.732	of this is that, indeed,
796.832	among the many other
796.832	ramifications of crack cocaine
799.401	is that the most talented individuals
799.401	in these communities --
803.555	this is what they were striving for.
805.31	They weren't trying to make it
805.31	in legitimate ways,
807.802	because there were
807.802	no legitimate channels out.
810.016	This was the best way out.
811.413	And it actually was
811.413	the right choice, probably,
814.108	to try to make it out this way.
818.117	You look at this,
819.425	the relationship to McDonald's
819.425	breaks down here.
822.368	The money looks about the same.
824.327	Why is it such a bad job?
825.793	Well, the reason it's such a bad job
825.793	is that there's somebody shooting at you
829.533	a lot of the time.
831.119	So, with shooting at you,
831.119	what are the death rates?
834	We found, in our gang --
835.181	and admittedly, this was not really
835.181	a standard situation;
838.441	this was a time of intense violence,
838.441	of a lot of gang wars,
842.907	as this gang actually
842.907	became quite successful.
845.59	But there were costs.
846.85	And so the death rate --
848.619	not to mention the rate of being arrested,
848.619	sent to prison, being wounded --
853.603	the death rate in our sample
853.603	was seven percent per person per year.
858.332	You're in the gang for four years,
860.087	you expect to die
860.087	with about a 25 percent likelihood.
864.627	That is about as high as you can get.
866.753	So for comparison's purposes,
868.624	let's think about some other walk of life
868.624	you may expect might be extremely risky.
873.65	Let's say that you were a murderer
875.666	and you were convicted of murder,
875.666	and you're sent to death row.
878.891	It turns out, the death rates on death row
878.891	from all causes, including execution:
882.884	two percent a year.
884.064	(Laughter)
885.089	So it's a lot safer being on death row
888.746	than it is selling drugs
888.746	out on the street.
891.844	That gives you some pause,
891.844	for those of you who believe
894.746	that a death penalty's going to have
894.746	an enormous deterrent effect on crime.
900.556	To give you a sense of just how bad
900.556	the inner city was during crack --
903.895	and I'm not really focusing
903.895	on the negatives,
906.653	but really, there's another story
906.653	to tell you there --
909.597	if you look at the death rates
909.597	just of random, young black males
913.359	growing up in the inner city
913.359	in the United States,
915.77	the death rates during crack
915.77	were about one percent.
918.57	That's extremely high.
919.746	And this is violent death --
919.746	it's unbelievable, in some sense.
922.761	To put it into perspective: if you compare
922.761	this to the soldiers in Iraq,
927.515	for instance, right now
927.515	fighting the war: 0.5 percent.
931.205	So in some very literal way,
934.266	the young black men who were
934.266	growing up in this country
937.198	were living in a war zone,
939.035	very much in the sense that the soldiers
939.035	over in Iraq are fighting in a war.
945.829	So why in the world, you might ask,
948.868	would anybody be willing
948.868	to stand out on a street corner
952.687	selling drugs for $3.50 an hour,
955	with a 25 percent chance of dying
955	over the next four years?
958	Why would they do that?
959.959	And I think there are a couple answers.
962.806	I think the first one
962.806	is that they got fooled by history.
968.513	It used to be the gang
968.513	was a rite of passage;
970.854	that the young people controlled the gang;
972.912	that as you got older,
972.912	you dropped out of the gang.
976.463	So what happened was,
977.663	the people who happened to be
977.663	in the right place at the right time --
980.965	the people who happened to be leading
980.965	the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s --
986.405	became very, very wealthy.
988.388	And so the logical thing to think
990.516	was that they are going
990.516	to age out of the gang
993.664	like everybody else has,
994.885	and the next generation is going
994.885	to take over and get the wealth.
998.024	There are striking similarities,
998.024	I think, to the Internet boom.
1001.033	The first set of people in Silicon Valley
1001.033	got very, very rich.
1004.283	And then all of my friends said,
1004.283	"""Maybe I should go do that, too."""
1008.397	And they were willing to work very cheap
1008.397	for stock options that never came.
1013.025	In some sense,
1013.025	that's what happened, exactly,
1015.423	to the set of people we were looking at.
1018.961	They were willing to start at the bottom,
1021.18	just like, say, a first-year
1021.18	lawyer at a law firm
1024.261	is willing to start at the bottom,
1026.456	work 80-hour weeks
1026.456	for not that much money,
1028.543	because they think
1028.543	they're going to make partner.
1030.876	But the rules changed,
1030.876	and they never got to make partner.
1033.686	Indeed, the same people who were running
1033.686	all of the major gangs in the late 1980s
1037.569	are still running the major gangs
1037.569	in Chicago today.
1039.999	They never passed on any of the wealth,
1041.906	So everybody got stuck
1041.906	at that $3.50-an-hour job,
1044.774	and it turned out to be a disaster.
1047.31	The other thing the gang was
1047.31	very good at was marketing and trickery.
1051.597	And so for instance,
1051.597	one thing the gang would do is --
1055.269	the gang leaders would have
1055.269	big entourages,
1057.525	and they'd drive fancy cars
1057.525	and have fancy jewelry.
1060.761	So what Sudhir eventually realized
1060.761	as he hung out with them more,
1063.871	is that, really, they didn't own
1063.871	those cars -- they just leased them,
1067.155	because they couldn't afford
1067.155	to own the fancy cars.
1069.858	And they didn't really have gold jewelry,
1069.858	they had gold-plated jewelry.
1073.344	It goes back to, you know,
1073.344	the real-real versus the fake-real.
1076.728	And really, they did all sorts
1076.728	of things to trick the young people
1080.714	into thinking what a great deal
1080.714	the gang was going to be.
1083.531	So for instance, they would give
1083.531	a 14-year-old kid
1086.346	a whole roll of bills to hold.
1089.496	That 14-year-old kid
1089.496	would say to his friends,
1092.35	"""Hey, look at all the money"
1092.35	"I got in the gang."""
1094.581	It wasn't his money -- until he spent it,
1096.582	and then he was in debt to the gang,
1098.325	and was sort of an indentured
1098.325	servant for a while.
1100.738	So I have a couple minutes.
1102.312	Let me do one last thing
1102.312	I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,
1106.381	which is to talk about what we learned
1106.381	more generally about economics,
1111.659	from the study of the gang.
1113.69	So, economists tend to talk
1113.69	in technical words.
1117.269	Often, our theories fail quite miserably
1117.269	when we over the data,
1120.894	but what's kind of interesting
1120.894	is that in this setting,
1123.704	it turned out that
1123.704	some of the economic theories
1126.045	that worked not so well
1126.045	in the real economy
1128.204	worked very well in the drug economy,
1130.418	in some sense, because
1130.418	it's unfettered capitalism.
1132.808	Here's an economic principle.
1134.225	This is one of the basic ideas
1134.225	in labor economics,
1136.591	"called a ""compensating differential."""
1138.399	It's the idea that the increment to wages
1138.399	that a worker requires
1141.865	to leave him indifferent
1141.865	between performing two tasks,
1144.503	one which is more unpleasant
1144.503	than the other.
1146.632	Compensating differential -- it's why
1146.632	we think garbagemen might be paid more
1150.302	than people who work in parks.
1151.86	The words of one of the members
1151.86	of the gang, I think, make this clear.
1157.806	So it turns out -- I'm sort
1157.806	of getting ahead of myself --
1160.52	it turns out, in the gang,
1160.52	when there's a war going on,
1163.697	they actually pay the foot soldiers
1163.697	twice as much money.
1166.738	It's exactly this concept.
1168.051	Because they're not willing to be at risk.
1170.707	And the words of a gang member
1170.707	capture it quite nicely, he says:
1173.753	"""Would you stand around here when all"
1173.753	"this shit ..."" -- the shooting --"
1177.127	"""... if all this shit's"
1177.127	going on? No, right?
1179.264	So if I gonna be asked to put my life
1179.264	"on the line, then front me the cash, man."""
1183.094	I think the gang member says it
1183.094	much more articulately
1185.666	than the economist, about what's going on.
1187.707	(Laughter)
1189.346	Here's another one.
1191	Economists talk about game theory,
1192.666	that every two-person game
1192.666	has a Nash equilibrium.
1195.048	Here's the translation
1195.048	you get from the gang member.
1197.53	They're talking about the decision
1197.53	of why they don't go shoot --
1200.907	One thing that turns out to be a great
1200.907	business tactic in the gang:
1204.797	if you go and just shoot guns in the air
1204.797	in the other gang's territory --
1208.703	people are afraid to go buy drugs there,
1210.668	they're going to come
1210.668	into your neighborhood.
1212.8	Here's what he says
1212.8	about why they don't do that:
1215.12	"""If we start shooting around there,"
1215.12	the other gang's territory,
1218.165	nobody, I mean, you dig it,
1218.165	nobody gonna step on their turf.
1221.072	But we gotta be careful,
1222.248	'cause they can shoot around here too
1222.248	"and then we all fucked."""
1225.198	(Laughter)
1226.223	So that's the same concept.
1227.545	Then again, sometimes
1227.545	economists get it wrong.
1229.783	One thing we observed in the data
1229.783	is that it looked like --
1234.478	the gang leader always got paid.
1237.782	No matter how bad it was economically,
1237.782	he always got himself paid.
1242.258	We had some theories related to cash flow,
1244.432	and lack of access to capital markets,
1244.432	and things like that.
1247.287	Then we asked the gang member,
1248.747	"""Why is it you always get paid"
1248.747	"and your workers don't always get paid?"""
1252.124	His response is,
1253.299	"""You got all these niggers below you"
1253.299	who want your job, you dig?
1256.41	If you start taking losses,
1256.41	"they see you as weak and shit."""
1259.217	And I thought about it and said,
1260.789	"""CEOs often pay themselves"
1260.789	million-dollar bonuses,
1264.454	even when companies
1264.454	are losing a lot of money.
1266.79	And it never would really occur
1266.79	to an economist
1269.029	that this idea of 'weak and shit'
1269.029	"could really be important."""
1271.949	(Laughter)
1275.239	"Maybe ""weak and shit"" is an important"
1275.239	hypothesis that needs more analysis.
1281	Thank you very much.
1282.175	(Applause)
