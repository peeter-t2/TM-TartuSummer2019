19.051	Of the five senses, vision is the one
19.051	that I appreciate the most,
22.33	and it's the one that I can
22.33	least take for granted.
25.98	I think this is partially due
25.98	to my father, who was blind.
28.905	It was a fact that he didn't make
28.905	much of a fuss about, usually.
32.032	One time in Nova Scotia, when we went
32.032	to see a total eclipse of the sun --
35.69	(Laughter)
36.732	Yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,
38.845	which may or may not refer
38.845	to James Taylor, Warren Beatty
41.693	or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.
43.549	They handed out these dark plastic viewers
46.109	that allowed us to look
46.109	directly at the sun
48.182	without damaging our eyes.
49.473	But Dad got really scared;
49.473	he didn't want us doing that.
52.233	He wanted us instead to use
52.233	these cheap cardboard viewers,
55.115	so that there was no chance at all
55.115	that our eyes would be damaged.
58.799	I thought this was
58.799	a little strange at the time.
61.093	What I didn't know at the time
62.585	was that my father had actually
62.585	been born with perfect eyesight.
65.667	When he and his sister Martha
65.667	were just very little,
68.35	their mom took them out
68.35	to see a total eclipse --
70.852	or actually, a solar eclipse --
72.407	and not long after that, both of them
72.407	started losing their eyesight.
76.712	Decades later, it turned out
76.712	that the source of their blindness
80.198	was most likely some sort
80.198	of bacterial infection.
83.03	As near as we can tell,
83.03	it had nothing whatsoever to do
85.685	with that solar eclipse,
87.632	but by then my grandmother
87.632	had already gone to her grave
90.324	thinking it was her fault.
92.847	So, Dad graduated Harvard in 1946,
95.848	married my mom,
97.03	and bought a house
97.03	in Lexington, Massachusetts,
99.285	where the first shots were fired
99.285	against the British in 1775,
102.899	although we didn't actually hit
102.899	any of them until Concord.
105.998	He got a job working for Raytheon
105.998	designing guidance systems,
109.596	which was part of the Route 128
109.596	high-tech axis in those days --
112.672	so, the equivalent
112.672	of Silicon Valley in the '70s.
115.913	Dad wasn't a real
115.913	militaristic kind of guy;
118.296	he just felt bad that he wasn't able
118.296	to fight in World War II
121.465	on account of his handicap,
123.139	although they did let him get through
124.945	the several-hour-long army physical exam
128.706	before they got to the very last test,
128.706	which was for vision.
131.752	(Laughter)
134.418	So Dad started racking
134.418	up all of these patents
137.593	and gaining a reputation as a blind
137.593	genius, rocket scientist, inventor.
141.086	But to us he was just Dad,
141.086	and our home life was pretty normal.
145.673	As a kid, I watched a lot of television
147.592	and had lots of nerdy hobbies
147.592	like mineralogy and microbiology
151.254	and the space program
151.254	and a little bit of politics.
153.798	I played a lot of chess.
155.042	But at the age of 14, a friend
155.042	got me interested in comic books,
158.209	and I decided that was
158.209	what I wanted to do for a living.
161.476	So, here's my dad:
163.284	he's a scientist, he's an engineer
163.284	and he's a military contractor.
169.185	So, he has four kids, right?
171.008	One grows up to become
171.008	a computer scientist,
173.136	one grows up to join the Navy,
175.088	one grows up to become an engineer ...
177.354	And then there's me:
177.354	the comic book artist.
180.338	(Laughter)
184.092	Which, incidentally, makes me
184.092	the opposite of Dean Kamen,
186.804	because I'm a comic book artist,
186.804	son of an inventor,
189.29	and he's an inventor,
189.29	son of a comic book artist.
191.649	(Laughter)
192.902	Right? It's true.
194.089	(Applause)
196.767	The funny thing is,
196.767	Dad had a lot of faith in me.
199.126	He had faith in my abilities
199.126	as a cartoonist,
201.302	even though he had no direct evidence
201.302	that I was any good whatsoever;
204.613	everything he saw was just a blur.
206.304	Now, this gives a real meaning
206.304	"to the term ""blind faith,"""
209.04	which doesn't have the same
209.04	negative connotation for me
211.656	that it does for other people.
213.153	Now, faith in things which cannot
213.153	be seen, which cannot be proved,
216.321	is not the sort of faith that I've ever
216.321	really related to all that much.
220.07	I tend to like science,
221.521	where what we see and can ascertain
221.521	are the foundation of what we know.
226.981	But there's a middle ground, too --
229.133	a middle ground tread by people
229.133	like poor old Charles Babbage
232.712	and his steam-driven computers
232.712	that were never built.
236.164	Nobody really understood
236.164	what it was that he had in mind
239.237	except for Ada Lovelace,
241.49	and he went to his grave
241.49	trying to pursue that dream.
245.308	Vannevar Bush with his memex --
247.728	this idea of all of human
247.728	knowledge at your fingertips --
250.729	he had this vision.
252.281	And I think a lot of people in his day
254.147	probably thought he was a bit of a kook.
256.11	And, yeah, we can look back
256.11	in retrospect and say,
258.549	"""Yeah, ha-ha, it's all microfilm --"
260.794	(Laughter)
261.841	But that's not the point;
261.841	he understood the shape of the future.
264.951	So did J.C.R. Licklider and his notions
264.951	for computer-human interaction.
269.565	Same thing: he understood
269.565	the shape of the future,
272.458	even though it was something
272.458	that would only be implemented
276.084	by people much later.
277.499	Or Paul Baran, and his vision
277.499	for packet switching.
280.242	Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
283.101	Or even the people
283.101	who actually pulled it off,
285.317	the people at Bolt, Beranek
285.317	and Newman in Boston,
287.951	who just would sketch out these structures
290.887	of what would eventually
290.887	become a worldwide network,
293.447	and sketching things on the back
293.447	of napkins and on note papers
297.089	and arguing over dinner
297.089	at Howard Johnson's --
299.411	on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,
301.825	just two miles from where I was studying
301.825	the Queen's Gambit Deferred
305.082	and listening to Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips
307.206	"singing ""Midnight Train to Georgia"" --"
309.398	(Laughter)
310.425	in my dad's big easy chair, you know?
312.291	So, three types of vision, right?
314.252	Vision based on what one cannot see,
317.253	the vision of that unseen and unknowable.
320.046	The vision of that which has already
320.046	been proven or can be ascertained.
323.53	And this third kind, a vision of something
323.53	which can be, which may be,
330.079	based on knowledge
330.079	but is, as yet, unproven.
333.807	Now, we've seen a lot
333.807	of examples of people
335.885	who are pursuing
335.885	that sort of vision in science,
338.227	but I think it's also true
338.227	in the arts, it's true in politics,
341.205	it's even true in personal endeavors.
343.417	What it comes down to, really,
343.417	is four basic principles:
346.09	learn from everyone;
347.313	follow no one;
349.141	watch for patterns;
350.989	and work like hell.
352.192	I think these are the four principles
352.192	that go into this.
355.236	And it's that third one, especially,
357.091	where visions of the future
357.091	begin to manifest themselves.
360.759	What's interesting is that this particular
360.759	way of looking at the world,
364.158	is, I think, only one
364.158	of four different ways
366.314	that manifest themselves
366.314	in different fields of endeavor.
369.054	In comics, I know that it results
369.054	in sort of a formalist attitude
373.561	towards trying to understand how it works.
375.644	Then there's another,
375.644	more classical attitude
377.899	which embraces beauty and craft;
380.506	another one which believes
380.506	in the pure transparency of content;
384.562	and then another, which emphasizes
384.562	the authenticity of human experience
388.533	and honesty and rawness.
389.975	These are four very different ways
389.975	of looking at the world.
392.803	I even gave them names:
393.979	the classicist, the animist,
393.979	the formalist and iconoclast.
396.75	Interestingly, they seem
396.75	to correspond more or less
399.314	to Jung's four subdivisions
399.314	of human thought.
401.909	And they reflect a dichotomy
401.909	of art and delight
404.721	on left and the right;
405.96	tradition and revolution
405.96	on the top and the bottom.
408.484	And if you go on the diagonal,
408.484	you get content and form,
411.151	and then beauty and truth.
412.416	And it probably applies just as much
412.416	to music and movies and fine art,
416.526	which has nothing whatsoever
416.526	to do with vision at all,
419.527	or, for that matter, nothing to do
419.527	with our conference theme
422.432	"of ""Inspired by Nature,"""
423.788	except to the extent
423.788	of the fable of the frog
426.492	who gives a ride to the scorpion
426.492	on his back to get across the river
429.784	because the scorpion
429.784	promises not to sting him,
432.018	but the scorpion stings him anyway
432.018	and they both die,
434.576	but not before the frog asks
434.576	him why, and the scorpion says,
437.489	"""Because it's my nature."""
438.712	In that sense, yes.
439.891	(Laughter)
443.26	So this was my nature.
444.514	The thing was, I saw that the route I took
447.652	to discovering this focus in my work
451.521	and who I was --
453.389	I saw it as just this road to discovery.
455.64	Actually, it was just me
455.64	embracing my nature,
457.887	which means that I didn't actually fall
457.887	that far from the tree, after all.
463.87	"So what does a ""scientific mind"""
463.87	do in the arts?
468.87	I started making comics, but I also
468.87	started trying to understand them,
472.285	almost immediately.
473.46	One of the most important things
473.46	about comics that I discovered
476.566	was that comics are a visual medium,
478.437	but they try to embrace
478.437	all of the senses within it.
481.403	So, the different elements
481.403	of comics, like pictures and words,
485.494	and the different symbols
485.494	and everything in between
488.036	that comics presents,
489.247	are all funneled through
489.247	the single conduit, a vision.
491.839	So we have things like resemblance,
493.84	where something which resembles
493.84	the physical world can be abstracted
497.104	in a couple of different directions:
498.89	abstracted from resemblance,
498.89	but still retaining the complete meaning,
502.514	or abstracted away
502.514	from both resemblance and meaning
505.255	towards the picture plane.
506.535	Put all these three together,
506.535	and you have a nice little map
509.393	of the entire boundary
509.393	of visual iconography,
511.532	which comics can embrace.
513.341	And if you move to the right
513.341	you also get language,
516.203	because that's abstracting
516.203	even further from resemblance,
519.204	but still maintaining meaning.
521.807	Vision is called upon to represent sound
524.581	and to understand
524.581	the common properties of those two
528.176	and their common heritage as well;
530.34	also, to try to represent
530.34	the texture of sound
532.749	to capture its essential
532.749	character through visuals.
537.466	There's also a balance between the visible
537.466	and the invisible in comics.
542.489	Comics is a kind of call and response,
544.41	in which the artist gives you something
544.41	to see within the panels,
547.576	and then gives you something
547.576	to imagine between the panels.
551.355	Also, another sense
551.355	which comics' vision represents,
555.644	and that's time.
557.314	Sequence is a very important
557.314	aspect of comics.
560.982	Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
564.276	And this temporal map was something
564.276	that energizes modern comics,
567.936	but I was wondering
567.936	if perhaps it also energizes
570.881	other sorts of forms,
572.423	and I found some in history.
574.936	You can see this same principle operating
577.644	in these ancient versions
577.644	of the same idea.
580.652	What's happening is,
581.829	an art form is colliding
581.829	with a given technology,
584.195	whether it's paint on stone,
585.56	like the Tomb of Menna the Scribe
585.56	in ancient Egypt,
587.981	or a bas-relief sculpture
587.981	rising up a stone column,
590.609	or a 200-foot-long embroidery,
592.661	or painted deerskin and tree bark
594.662	running across 88 accordion-folded pages.
597.124	What's interesting is,
597.124	"once you hit ""print"" --"
599.313	and this is from 1450, by the way --
601.194	all of the artifacts of modern comics
601.194	start to present themselves:
604.351	rectilinear panel arrangements,
605.891	simple line drawings without tone,
607.683	and a left-to-right reading sequence.
611.093	And within 100 years, you already start
611.093	to see word balloons and captions,
616.125	and it's really just a hop, skip
616.125	and a jump from here to here.
619.839	So I wrote a book about this in '93,
619.839	but as I was finishing the book,
623.298	I had to do a little bit of typesetting,
625.238	and I was tired of going
625.238	to my local copy shop to do it,
627.93	so I bought a computer.
629.199	And it was just a little thing --
630.897	it wasn't good for much
630.897	except text entry --
633.087	but my father had told me
633.087	about Moore's law back in the '70s,
636.951	and I knew what was coming.
638.879	And so, I kept my eyes peeled
641.601	to see if the sort
641.601	of changes that happened
643.666	when we went from pre-print
643.666	comics to print comics
646.3	would happen when we went beyond,
646.3	to post-print comics.
649.665	So, one of the first things proposed
651.437	was that we could mix
651.437	the visuals of comics
653.815	with the sound, motion
653.815	and interactivity of the CD-ROMs
656.65	being made in those days.
657.88	This was even before the Web.
659.483	And one of the first things they did was,
661.468	they tried to take the comics page as is
663.403	and transplant it to monitors,
664.887	which was a classic McLuhanesque mistake
666.912	of appropriating the shape
666.912	of the previous technology
669.435	as the content of the new technology.
671.52	And so, what they would do
671.52	is have these comic pages
674.024	that resemble print comics pages,
675.683	and they would introduce
675.683	all this sound and motion.
678.123	The problem was that if you go
678.123	with this basic idea
681.388	that space equals time in comics,
683.76	what happens is that
683.76	when you introduce sound and motion,
686.499	which are temporal phenomena
686.499	that can only be represented through time,
689.922	they break with that continuity
689.922	of presentation.
695.15	Interactivity was another thing.
696.716	There were hypertext comics,
696.716	but the thing about hypertext
699.507	is that everything in hypertext
699.507	is either here, not here,
702.24	or connected to here;
703.422	it's profoundly nonspatial.
704.796	The distance from Abraham Lincoln
704.796	to a Lincoln penny
707.273	to Penny Marshall to the Marshall Plan
707.273	"to ""Plan 9"" to nine lives:"
710.382	it's all the same.
711.557	(Laughter)
712.774	But in comics,
715.65	every aspect of the work,
715.65	every element of the work,
718.544	has a spatial relationship
718.544	to every other element at all times.
721.703	So the question was:
722.895	Was there any way to preserve
722.895	that spatial relationship
725.896	while still taking advantage
725.896	of all of the things
728.268	that digital had to offer us?
729.935	And I found my personal answer for this
731.99	in those ancient comics
731.99	that I was showing you.
734.324	Each of them has a single
734.324	unbroken reading line,
737.688	whether it's going zigzag across the walls
737.688	or spiraling up a column
741.405	or just straight left to right,
742.957	or even going in a backwards zigzag
742.957	across those 88 accordion-folded pages,
747.03	the same thing is happening;
748.448	that is, that the basic idea
748.448	that as you move through space
751.258	you move through time,
752.437	is being carried out
752.437	without any compromise,
754.545	but there were compromises when print hit.
756.6	Adjacent spaces were no longer
756.6	adjacent moments,
759.54	so the basic idea of comics
759.54	was being broken again and again
762.783	and again and again.
763.963	And I thought, OK, well, if that's true,
766.313	is there any way,
766.313	when we go beyond today's print,
769.244	to somehow bring that back?
772.395	Now, the monitor is just as limited
772.395	as the page, technically, right?
777.656	It's a different shape,
777.656	but other than that,
779.807	it's the same basic limitation.
781.736	But that's only if you look
781.736	at the monitor as a page,
785.299	but not if you look
785.299	at the monitor as a window.
788.021	And that's what I propose,
789.292	that perhaps we could create
789.292	these comics on an infinite canvas,
792.433	along the X axis and the Y axis
795.367	and staircases.
797.164	We could do circular narratives
797.164	that were literally circular.
800.094	We could do a turn in a story
800.094	that was literally a turn.
803.536	Parallel narratives
803.536	could be literally parallel.
807.307	X, Y and also Z.
810.569	So I had all these notions.
811.915	This was back in the late '90s,
813.447	and other people in my business
813.447	thought I was pretty crazy,
816.302	but a lot of people then went on
816.302	and actually did it.
818.851	I'm going to show you a couple now.
821.093	This was an early collage comic
821.093	by a fellow named Jasen Lex.
827.966	And notice what's going on here.
829.765	What I'm searching for
829.765	is a durable mutation --
832.309	that's what all of us are searching for.
834.31	As media head into this new era,
837.514	we are looking for mutations
837.514	that are durable,
840.03	that have some sort of staying power.
843.567	Now, we're taking this basic idea
843.567	of presenting comics in a visual medium,
847.695	and we're carrying it through all the way
847.695	from beginning to end.
851.03	That's that entire comic you just saw,
851.03	up on the screen right now.
854.225	But even though we're only experiencing it
854.225	one piece at a time,
857.308	that's just where
857.308	the technology is right now.
859.914	As the technology evolves,
861.676	as you get full immersive
861.676	displays and whatnot,
864.684	this sort of thing
864.684	will only grow; it will adapt.
867.478	It will adapt to its environment;
867.478	it's a durable mutation.
873.055	Here's another one.
874.244	This is by Drew Weing; this is called
876.565	"""'Pup' Ponders the Heat Death"
876.565	"of the Universe."""
904.392	See what's going on here
906.909	as we draw these stories
906.909	on an infinite canvas
912.165	is you're creating a more pure expression
912.165	of what this medium is all about.
921.99	We'll go by this a little quickly.
921.99	You get the idea.
924.587	I just want to get to the last panel.
932.375	[Cat 1: Pup! Earth to Pup!
932.375	Cat 2: Come play baseball with us!]
935.495	(Laughter)
936.582	[Pup: Did either of you realize
938.206	that eventually the universe
938.206	will be nothing but a thin, cold gas
941.525	spread across infinite, lonely space?]
943.509	[Cat 1: Oh ...
943.509	Cat 2: We'd better hurry, then!]
946.155	(Laughter)
949.847	Just one more.
953.474	Talk about your infinite canvas.
955.443	It's by a guy named
955.443	Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.
958.593	Why is this important?
961.228	I think this is important because media --
964.727	all media --
966.093	provide us a window back into our world.
968.898	Now, it could be that motion pictures
968.898	and eventually, virtual reality,
973.244	or something equivalent to it,
973.244	some sort of immersive display,
976.447	is going to provide us
976.447	with our most efficient escape
980.588	from the world that we're in.
982.03	That's why most people turn
982.03	to storytelling, to escape.
984.834	But media provides us with a window
984.834	back into the world we live in.
991.585	And when media evolve
994.752	so that the identity of the media
994.752	becomes increasingly unique --
999.753	because what you're looking at
999.753	is comics cubed,
1002.977	you're looking at comics
1002.977	that are more comics-like
1005.376	than they've ever been before --
1006.995	when that happens, you provide
1006.995	people with multiple ways
1009.671	of reentering the world
1009.671	through different windows.
1013.673	And when you do that, it allows them
1013.673	to triangulate the world they live in
1017.464	and see its shape.
1018.863	That's why I think this is important.
1020.664	One of many reasons,
1020.664	but I've got to go now.
1022.743	Thank you for having me.
