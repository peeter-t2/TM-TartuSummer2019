13.014	I'll begin today
14.825	by sharing a poem
16.891	written by my friend from Malawi,
20.026	Eileen Piri.
22.162	Eileen is only 13 years old,
25.506	but when we were going through
25.506	the collection of poetry that we wrote,
31.38	I found her poem so interesting,
34.248	so motivating.
36.245	So I'll read it to you.
38.905	She entitled her poem
38.905	"""I'll Marry When I Want."""
42.503	(Laughter)
45.359	"""I'll marry when I want."
47.89	My mother can't force me to marry.
52.79	My father cannot force me to marry.
57.526	My uncle, my aunt,
60.336	my brother or sister,
62.681	cannot force me to marry.
65.885	No one in the world
68.254	can force me to marry.
71.55	I'll marry when I want.
74.499	Even if you beat me,
77.077	even if you chase me away,
79.747	even if you do anything bad to me,
82.928	I'll marry when I want.
86.364	I'll marry when I want,
89.267	but not before I am well educated,
93.005	and not before I am all grown up.
97.323	"I'll marry when I want."""
100.831	This poem might seem odd,
103.827	written by a 13-year-old girl,
107.356	but where I and Eileen come from,
112.139	this poem, which I have just read to you,
115.9	is a warrior's cry.
119.616	I am from Malawi.
123.191	Malawi is one of the poorest countries,
127.115	very poor,
129.994	where gender equality is questionable.
134.522	Growing up in that country,
136.844	I couldn't make my own choices in life.
140.095	I couldn't even explore
142.393	personal opportunities in life.
145.389	I will tell you a story
147.919	of two different girls,
150.381	two beautiful girls.
154.026	These girls grew up
156.58	under the same roof.
158.693	They were eating the same food.
161.41	Sometimes, they would share clothes,
164.173	and even shoes.
166.982	But their lives ended up differently,
171.649	in two different paths.
175.039	The other girl is my little sister.
178.754	My little sister was only 11 years old
183.677	when she got pregnant.
188.029	It's a hurtful thing.
193.352	Not only did it hurt her, even me.
196.633	I was going through a hard time as well.
200.232	As it is in my culture,
203.947	once you reach puberty stage,
206.942	you are supposed to go
206.942	to initiation camps.
210.82	In these initiation camps,
213.118	you are taught how
213.118	to sexually please a man.
216.973	There is this special day,
218.761	"which they call ""Very Special Day"""
221.965	where a man who is hired
221.965	by the community
224.519	comes to the camp
227.143	and sleeps with the little girls.
231.252	Imagine the trauma that these young girls
233.766	go through every day.
238.766	Most girls end up pregnant.
241.925	They even contract HIV and AIDS
244.542	and other sexually transmitted diseases.
247.692	For my little sister,
247.692	she ended up being pregnant.
252.603	Today, she's only 16 years old
256.666	and she has three children.
259.662	Her first marriage did not survive,
263.307	nor did her second marriage.
266.604	On the other side, there is this girl.
271.341	She's amazing.
273.314	(Laughter)
275.218	(Applause)
279.723	I call her amazing because she is.
282.138	She's very fabulous.
285.203	That girl is me. (Laughter)
288.964	When I was 13 years old,
291.982	I was told, you are grown up,
295.396	you have now reached of age,
298.228	you're supposed to go
298.228	to the initiation camp.
301.595	"I was like, ""What?"
304.567	I'm not going to go
304.567	"to the initiation camps."""
310.349	You know what the women said to me?
313.112	"""You are a stupid girl. Stubborn."
316.734	You do not respect the traditions
316.734	"of our society, of our community."""
324.001	I said no because I knew
324.001	where I was going.
327.809	I knew what I wanted in life.
331.773	I had a lot of dreams as a young girl.
336.238	I wanted to get well educated,
339.883	to find a decent job in the future.
342.363	I was imagining myself as a lawyer,
344.122	seated on that big chair.
346.832	Those were the imaginations that
349.138	were going through my mind every day.
352.468	And I knew that one day,
354.302	I would contribute something,
354.302	a little something to my community.
358.876	But every day after refusing,
361.407	women would tell me,
363.427	"""Look at you, you're all grown up."
363.427	Your little sister has a baby.
366.817	"What about you?"""
368.303	That was the music
368.303	that I was hearing every day,
373.017	and that is the music
373.017	that girls hear every day
376.894	when they don't do something
376.894	that the community needs them to do.
383.524	When I compared the two stories
383.524	between me and my sister,
387.448	"I said, ""Why can't I do something?"
392.185	Why can't I change something
392.185	that has happened for a long time
397.246	"in our community?"""
399.661	That was when I called other girls
402.169	just like my sister, who have children,
404.723	who have been in class but they have
404.723	forgotten how to read and write.
408.187	"I said, ""Come on, we can "
408.187	remind each other
410.297	how to read and write again,
412.432	how to hold the pen,
412.432	"how to read, to hold the book."""
416.24	It was a great time I had with them.
419.885	Nor did I just learn a little about them,
424.157	but they were able to tell me
424.157	their personal stories,
427.594	what they were facing every day
429.405	as young mothers.
432.075	That was when I was like,
434.072	'Why can't we take all these things
434.072	that are happening to us
437.996	and present them and tell our mothers,
437.996	our traditional leaders,
441.873	"that these are the wrong things?"""
443.87	It was a scary thing to do,
445.937	because these traditional leaders,
447.91	they are already accustomed to the things
450.114	that have been there for ages.
452.554	A hard thing to change,
454.481	but a good thing to try.
457.105	So we tried.
459.357	It was very hard, but we pushed.
462.245	And I'm here to say that in my community,
465.109	it was the first community after girls
467.669	pushed so hard to our traditional leader,
471.036	and our leader stood up for us
471.036	and said no girl has to be married
475.425	before the age of 18.
477.654	(Applause)
485.502	In my community,
487.243	that was the first time a community,
489.89	they had to call the bylaws,
492.351	the first bylaw that protected girls
495.858	in our community.
498.052	We did not stop there.
499.84	We forged ahead.
502.789	We were determined to fight for girls
502.789	not just in my community,
506.643	but even in other communities.
509.429	When the child marriage bill
509.429	was being presented in February,
513.562	we were there at the Parliament house.
517.208	Every day, when the members
517.208	of Parliament were entering,
521.294	we were telling them,
521.294	"""Would you please support the bill?"""
524.383	And we don't have
524.383	much technology like here,
529.142	but we have our small phones.
531.139	"So we said, ""Why can't we get "
531.139	"their numbers and text them?"""
536.178	So we did that. It was a good thing.
539.428	(Applause)
541.448	So when the bill passed,
541.448	we texted them back,
544.421	"""Thank you for supporting the bill."""
546.849	(Laughter)
547.919	And when the bill was signed
547.919	by the president,
551.264	making it into law, it was a plus.
554.63	Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
554.63	marriage age, from 15 to 18.
560.482	(Applause)
566.495	It's a good thing to know
566.495	that the bill passed,
570.071	but let me tell you this:
573.113	There are countries where 18
573.113	is the legal marriage age,
577.501	but don't we hear cries
577.501	of women and girls every day?
581.773	Every day, girls' lives
581.773	are being wasted away.
587.416	This is high time for leaders
587.416	to honor their commitment.
593.87	In honoring this commitment,
596.239	it means keeping girls' issues
596.239	at heart every time.
601.951	We don't have to be subjected as second,
605.712	but they have to know that women,
605.712	as we are in this room,
609.95	we are not just women,
609.95	we are not just girls,
613	we are extraordinary.
614.98	We can do more.
616.893	And another thing for Malawi,
619.888	and not just Malawi but other countries:
622.79	The laws which are there,
626.575	you know how a law is not a law
626.575	until it is enforced?
632.426	The law which has just recently passed
635.839	and the laws that in other countries
635.839	have been there,
638.463	they need to be publicized
638.463	at the local level,
642.387	at the community level,
644.57	where girls' issues are very striking.
649.956	Girls face issues, difficult issues,
649.956	at the community level every day.
655.274	So if these young girls know
655.274	that there are laws that protect them,
660.359	they will be able to stand up
660.359	and defend themselves
663.145	because they will know that
663.145	there is a law that protects them.
669.254	And another thing I would say is that
673.363	girls' voices and women's voices
677.961	are beautiful, they are there,
680.724	but we cannot do this alone.
683.905	Male advocates, they have to jump in,
686.575	to step in and work together.
688.525	It's a collective work.
691.103	What we need is what girls elsewhere need:
693.843	good education, and above all,
693.843	not to marry whilst 11.
702.085	And furthermore,
704.953	I know that together,
708.018	we can transform the legal,
711.966	the cultural and political framework
715.135	that denies girls of their rights.
719.906	I am standing here today
724.964	and declaring that we can
724.964	end child marriage in a generation.
732.677	This is the moment
734.86	where a girl and a girl,
734.86	and millions of girls worldwide,
739.294	will be able to say,
741.895	"""I will marry when I want."""
745.099	(Applause)
755.284	Thank you. (Applause)
