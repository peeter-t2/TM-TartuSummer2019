16.02	I started Improv Everywhere
16.02	about 10 years ago
18.22	when I moved to New York City
18.22	with an interest in acting and comedy.
21.74	Because I was new to the city,
21.74	I didn't have access to a stage,
24.74	so I decided to create
24.74	my own in public places.
28.14	So the first project
28.14	we're going to take a look at
30.54	is the very first No Pants Subway Ride.
32.46	Now, this took place in January of 2002.
34.46	And this woman is the star of the video.
36.42	She doesn't know she's being filmed.
38.18	She's being filmed with a hidden camera.
40.14	This is on the 6 train in New York City.
42.1	And this is the first stop along the line.
44.22	These are two Danish guys
45.5	who come in and sit down
45.5	next to the hidden camera.
49.14	And that's me right there in a brown coat.
51.18	It's about 30 degrees outside.
52.86	I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
55.42	And the girl's going
55.42	to notice me right here.
60.14	(Laughter)
65.54	And as you'll see now,
65.54	I'm not wearing pants.
67.78	(Laughter)
71.9	At this point --
73.86	at this point she's noticed me,
75.38	but in New York there's weirdos
75.38	on any given train car.
78.02	One person's not that unusual.
79.499	She goes back to reading her book,
79.499	"which is unfortunately titled ""Rape."""
82.94	(Laughter)
86.3	So she's noticed the unusual thing,
86.3	but she's gone back to her normal life.
89.86	Now, in the meantime, I have six friends
91.82	who are waiting
91.82	at the next six consecutive stops
94.18	in their underwear as well.
95.86	They're going to be entering
95.86	this car one by one.
98.22	We'll act as though
98.22	we don't know each other.
100.74	And we'll act as if it's just
100.74	an unfortunate mistake we've made,
103.78	forgetting our pants
103.78	on this cold January day.
105.98	(Laughter)
121.06	(Laughter continues)
132.54	So at this point,
133.82	she decides to put the rape book away.
136.18	(Laughter)
138.26	And she decides to be a little bit
138.26	more aware of her surroundings.
141.62	In the meantime, the two Danish guys
141.62	to the left of the camera,
144.62	they're cracking up.
145.86	They think this is the funniest thing
145.86	they've ever seen before.
148.86	And watch her make eye contact
148.86	with them right about now.
153.7	(Laughter)
158.54	And I love that moment in this video,
160.38	because before it became
160.38	a shared experience,
162.98	it was something
162.98	that was maybe a little bit scary,
165.78	or something that was
165.78	at least confusing to her.
168.06	And then, once it became
168.06	a shared experience,
170.18	it was funny and something
170.18	that she could laugh at.
172.62	So the train is now pulling
172.62	into the third stop along the 6 line.
189.98	(Laughter)
193.46	So the video won't show everything.
195.18	This goes on for another four stops.
197.3	A total of seven guys
197.3	enter anonymously in their underwear.
200.58	At the eighth stop,
200.58	a girl came in with a giant duffel bag
203.34	and announced she had
203.34	pants for sale for a dollar --
205.82	like you might sell batteries
205.82	or candy on the train.
209.06	We all very matter-of-factly
209.06	bought a pair of pants, put them on
212.14	"and said, ""Thank you."
212.14	"That's exactly what I needed today,"""
214.9	and then exited without
214.9	revealing what had happened
218.1	and went in all different directions.
219.94	(Applause)
222.94	Thank you.
224.98	So that's a still from the video there.
227.7	And I love that girl's reaction so much.
229.7	And watching that videotape later that day
231.724	inspired me to keep doing what I do.
234.06	And really one of the points
234.06	of Improv Everywhere
236.62	is to cause a scene in a public place
238.66	that is a positive experience
238.66	for other people.
240.9	It's a prank, but it's a prank
240.9	that gives somebody a great story to tell.
244.38	And her reaction inspired me
245.78	to do a second annual
245.78	No Pants Subway Ride.
247.82	And we've continued to do it every year.
249.749	This January, we did
249.749	the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride
252.46	where a diverse group of 3,500 people
254.82	rode the train in their
254.82	underwear in New York --
257.1	almost every single
257.1	train line in the city.
259.18	And also in 50 other cities
259.18	around the world,
261.58	people participated.
262.82	(Laughter)
264.98	As I started taking improv class
264.98	at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater
268.42	and meeting other creative people
268.42	and other performers and comedians,
271.7	I started amassing
271.7	a mailing list of people
273.779	who wanted to do these types of projects.
275.779	So I could do more large-scale projects.
277.74	Well, one day I was walking
277.74	through Union Square,
280.1	and I saw this building,
280.1	which had just been built in 2005.
283.66	There was a girl in one of the windows
283.66	and she was dancing.
286.5	It was very peculiar,
286.5	because it was dark out,
288.7	but she was backlit
288.7	with florescent lighting.
290.94	She was very much onstage
292.22	and I couldn't figure out
292.22	why she was doing it.
294.46	After about 15 seconds,
294.46	her friend appeared --
296.66	she had been hiding behind a display.
298.5	They laughed, hugged
298.5	each other and ran away.
300.66	Maybe she had been dared to do this.
302.42	So I got inspired by that.
303.74	Looking at the entire facade --
303.74	there were 70 total windows --
306.7	and I knew what I had to do.
308.1	(Laughter)
309.66	So this project is called Look Up More.
311.58	We had 70 actors dress in black.
313.18	This was completely unauthorized.
314.82	We didn't let the stores know
314.82	we were coming.
316.98	And I stood in the park giving signals.
318.9	The first signal was for everybody
318.9	to hold up these four-foot tall letters
322.42	"that spelled out ""Look Up More,"""
324.02	the name of the project.
326.46	The second signal was for everybody
326.46	to do jumping jacks together.
330.66	You'll see that start right here.
332.3	(Laughter)
334.78	And then we had dancing.
334.78	We had everyone dance.
337.02	And then we had dance solos
338.38	where only one person would dance
338.38	and everybody would point to them.
341.62	(Laughter)
348.38	So then I gave a new hand signal,
350.02	which signaled the next soloist
350.02	down below in Forever 21,
353.42	and he danced.
355.54	There were several other activities.
357.34	We had people jumping up and down,
357.34	people dropping to the ground.
360.78	And I was standing
360.78	just anonymously in a sweatshirt,
363.26	putting my hand on and off of a trashcan
363.26	to signal the advancement.
366.54	And because it was in Union Square Park,
366.54	right by a subway station,
369.74	there were hundreds of people by the end
369.74	who stopped and looked up
372.9	and watched what we were doing.
376.9	There's a better photo of it.
378.46	So that particular event
378.46	was inspired by a moment
382.26	that I happened to stumble upon.
384.62	The next project I want to show
386.14	was given to me
386.14	in an email from a stranger.
388.98	A high school kid in Texas
388.98	wrote me in 2006
391.34	"and said, ""You should get"
391.34	as many people as possible
393.82	to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants
396.42	"and go into a Best Buy and stand around."""
398.7	(Laughter)
401.14	(Applause)
403.42	So I wrote this high school kid
403.42	back immediately
407.94	"and I said, ""Yes, you are correct."
409.62	I think I'll try to do that
409.62	"this weekend. Thank you."""
412.14	So here's the video.
413.54	So again, this is 2005.
415.06	This is the Best Buy in New York City.
417.58	We had about 80 people
417.58	show up to participate,
420.38	entering one by one.
421.7	There was an eight-year-old girl,
421.7	a 10-year-old girl.
424.201	There was also a 65-year-old man
424.201	who participated.
427.26	So a very diverse group of people.
429.26	(Laughter)
430.42	And I told people,
430.42	"""Don't work. Don't actually do work."
433.1	But also, don't shop.
434.34	Just stand around
434.34	"and don't face products."""
436.78	Now you can see the regular employees
438.62	by the ones that have
438.62	the yellow tags on their shirt.
441.14	Everybody else is one of our actors.
442.9	(Laughter)
444.78	The lower-level employees
444.78	thought it was very funny.
447.26	Several of them went
447.26	to go get their camera from the break room
450.26	and took photos with us.
451.54	A lot of them made jokes
451.54	about trying to get us to go to the back
454.62	to get heavy television sets
454.62	for customers.
457.26	The managers and the security guards,
457.26	on the other hand,
460.22	did not find it particularly funny.
462.54	You can see them in this footage.
464.18	They're wearing either
464.18	a yellow shirt or a black shirt.
466.82	And we were there probably 10 minutes
468.66	before the managers decided to dial 911.
471.18	(Laughter)
473.46	So they started running around
475.26	telling everybody the cops were coming,
475.26	"""Watch out, the cops are coming."""
478.86	And you can see the cops
478.86	in this footage right here.
481.5	That's a cop wearing black right there,
481.5	being filmed with a hidden camera.
485.02	Ultimately, the police
485.02	had to inform Best Buy management
487.7	that it was not, in fact, illegal
487.7	to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants.
491.3	(Laughter)
493.62	(Applause)
497.14	Thank you.
498.38	(Applause)
500.1	So we had been there for 20 minutes;
500.1	we were happy to exit the store.
504.54	One thing the managers were trying to do
504.54	was to track down our cameras.
508.62	And they caught a couple of my guys
508.62	who had hidden cameras in duffel bags.
512.14	But the one camera guy they never caught
514.069	was the guy that went in
514.069	just with a blank tape
516.3	and went over to the Best Buy
516.3	camera department
518.54	and just put his tape
518.54	in one of their cameras
520.7	and pretended to shop.
522.78	So I like that concept of using
522.78	their own technology against them.
525.94	(Laughter)
527.66	I think our best projects
527.66	are ones that are site-specific
530.38	and happen at a particular
530.38	place for a reason.
532.58	And one morning, I was riding the subway.
534.557	I had to make a transfer
534.557	at the 53rd St. stop
536.7	where there are
536.7	these two giant escalators.
538.74	And it's a very depressing place
538.74	to be in the morning, it's very crowded.
542.22	So I decided to try and stage something
544.14	that could make it as happy
544.14	as possible for one morning.
547.66	So this was in the winter of 2009 --
547.66	8:30 in the morning.
551.18	It's morning rush hour.
552.74	It's very cold outside.
554.5	People are coming in from Queens,
556.14	transferring from the E train
556.14	to the 6 train.
559.06	And they're going up
559.06	these giant escalators
562.18	on their way to their jobs.
566.1	[Rob wants]
571.495	[to give you]
575.435	(Laughter)
576.609	[a high five!]
577.886	(Laughter)
580.354	[Get ready!]
581.627	(Laughter)
588.62	(Applause)
595.26	Thank you.
596.5	So there's a photograph
596.5	that illustrates it a little bit better.
599.54	He gave 2,000 high fives that day,
602.22	and he washed his hands
602.22	before and afterward
604.62	and did not get sick.
606.06	And that was done also without permission,
608.084	although no one seemed to care.
610.22	So I'd say over the years,
611.54	one of the most common criticisms
611.54	I see of Improv Everywhere
614.78	left anonymously on YouTube comments
616.7	"is: ""These people"
616.7	"have too much time on their hands."""
619.86	And you know, not everybody's
619.86	going to like everything you do,
622.82	and I've certainly developed a thick skin
622.82	thanks to Internet comments,
626.14	but that one's always bothered me,
627.82	because we don't have
627.82	too much time on our hands.
630.18	The participants
630.18	in Improv Everywhere events
632.3	have just as much leisure time
632.3	as any other New Yorkers,
634.98	they just occasionally choose
634.98	to spend it in an unusual way.
637.9	You know, every Saturday and Sunday,
639.66	hundreds of thousands of people each fall
641.74	gather in football stadiums
641.74	to watch games.
644.46	And I've never seen anybody comment,
644.46	looking at a football game,
647.54	"""All those people in the stands,"
647.54	"they have too much time on their hands."""
651.02	And of course they don't.
652.3	It's a perfectly wonderful way
652.3	to spent a weekend afternoon,
655.18	watching a football game in a stadium.
657.06	But I think it's also
657.06	a perfectly valid way
659.26	to spend an afternoon
659.26	freezing in place with 200 people
662.46	in the Grand Central terminal
664.14	or dressing up like a ghostbuster
666.46	and running through
666.46	the New York Public Library.
668.74	(Laughter)
670.86	Or listening to the same MP3
670.86	as 3,000 other people
674.1	and dancing silently in a park,
676.26	or bursting into song in a grocery store
678.46	as part of a spontaneous musical,
680.7	or diving into the ocean in Coney Island
680.7	wearing formal attire.
684.14	(Laughter)
685.58	You know, as kids, we're taught to play.
687.54	And we're never given a reason
687.54	why we should play.
689.94	It's just acceptable
689.94	that play is a good thing.
692.18	And I think that's sort of
692.18	the point of Improv Everywhere.
694.94	It's that there is no point
694.94	and that there doesn't have to be a point.
698.26	We don't need a reason.
698.26	As long as it's fun
700.3	and it seems like
700.3	it's going to be a funny idea
702.54	and it seems like the people
702.54	who witness it
704.86	will also have a fun time,
706.34	then that's enough for us.
707.74	And I think, as adults, we need to learn
709.78	that there's no right
709.78	or wrong way to play.
712.26	Thank you very much.
713.5	(Applause)
