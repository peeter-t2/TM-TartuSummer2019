13.809	The idea of eliminating poverty
13.809	is a great goal.
19.026	I don't think anyone
19.026	in this room would disagree.
22.512	What worries me
22.512	is when politicians with money
27.06	and charismatic rock stars --
29.705	(Laughter)
31.309	use the words,
32.65	""" ... it all just sounds so, so simple."""
39.073	Now, I've got no bucket of money today
42.189	and I've got no policy to release,
45.404	and I certainly haven't got a guitar.
47.667	I'll leave that to others.
50.44	But I do have an idea,
52.146	and that idea is called
52.146	Housing for Health.
55.344	Housing for Health works with poor people.
58.061	It works in the places where they live,
61.116	and the work is done
61.116	to improve their health.
65.049	Over the last 28 years,
67.228	this tough, grinding, dirty work
70.68	has been done by literally
70.68	thousands of people around Australia
75.165	and, more recently, overseas,
77.629	and their work has proven
79.857	that focused design can improve
79.857	even the poorest living environments.
85.331	It can improve health
86.697	and it can play a part in reducing,
86.697	if not eliminating, poverty.
93.256	I'm going to start
93.256	where the story began --
99.2	A man called Yami Lester,
99.2	an Aboriginal man,
101.947	was running a health service.
104.625	Eighty percent of what walked
104.625	in the door, in terms of illness,
108.599	was infectious disease --
110.812	third world, developing world
110.812	infectious disease,
113.684	caused by a poor living environment.
119.381	Yami assembled a team in Alice Springs.
122.977	He got a medical doctor.
125.466	He got an environmental health guy.
128.266	And he hand-selected a team
128.266	of local Aboriginal people
133.034	to work on this project.
135.54	Yami told us at that first meeting,
137.269	"""There's no money,"" --"
137.269	always a good start --
141.035	""" ... no money, you have six months,"
144.548	"and I want you to start on a project --"""
144.548	which, in his language,
147.586	"he called ""Uwankara Palyanku Kanyintjaku,"""
150.338	"which, translated, is ""a plan"
150.338	"to stop people getting sick"" --"
155.324	a profound brief.
159.265	That was our task.
162.279	First step, the medical doctor went away
162.279	for about six months.
166.932	And he worked on what were to become
166.932	these nine health goals --
171.387	what were we aiming at?
175.236	After six months of work,
175.236	he came to my office
177.451	and presented me with
177.451	those nine words on a piece of paper.
182.046	[The 9 Healthy Living Practices: Washing,
182.046	clothes, wastewater, nutrition, crowding,
186.066	animals, dust, temperature, injury]
187.757	I was very unimpressed.
187.757	Big ideas need big words,
191.051	and preferably a lot of them.
193.45	This didn't fit the bill.
195.29	What I didn't see and what you can't see
199.68	was that he'd assembled thousands of pages
204.018	of local, national
204.018	and international health research
207.808	that filled out the picture
207.808	as to why these were the health targets.
212.634	The pictures that came a bit later
212.634	had a very simple reason.
216.81	The Aboriginal people who were our bosses
216.81	and the senior people
220.097	were most commonly illiterate,
222.463	so the story had to be told in pictures
224.646	of what these goals were.
226.371	We worked with the community,
228.697	not telling them what was going to happen
230.704	in a language they didn't understand.
233.593	So we had the goals
233.593	and each one of these goals --
236.86	and I won't go through them all --
238.745	puts at the center the person
238.745	and their health issue,
242.848	and it then connects them
244.824	to the bits of the physical
244.824	environment that are actually needed
249.333	to keep their health good.
251.262	And the highest priority,
251.262	you see on the screen,
253.967	is washing people once a day,
253.967	particularly children.
258.31	And I hope most of you are thinking,
260.088	"""What? That sounds simple."""
261.414	Now, I'm going to ask you all
261.414	a very personal question.
265.494	This morning before you came,
266.899	who could have had a wash using a shower?
272.198	I'm not going to ask if you had a shower,
272.198	because I'm too polite.
275.437	That's it.
276.612	(Laughter)
277.637	All right, I think it's fair to say
279.423	most people here could have had
279.423	a shower this morning.
282.494	I'm going to ask you to do some more work.
284.642	I want you all to select one of the houses
287.17	of the 25 houses you see on the screen.
289.246	I want you to select one of them
289.246	and note the position of that house
292.676	and keep that in your head.
294.077	Have you all got a house?
295.627	I'm going to ask you to live there
295.627	for a few months,
298.101	so make sure you've got it right.
299.731	It's in the northwest of
299.731	Western Australia, very pleasant place.
302.778	OK. Let's see if your shower
302.778	in that house is working.
307.328	"I hear some ""Aw!"" and I hear some ""Ah!"""
310.487	If you get a green tick,
310.487	your shower's working.
313.291	You and your kids are fine.
314.601	If you get a red cross,
316.994	well, I've looked carefully
316.994	around the room
319.257	and it's not going to make
319.257	much difference to this crew.
322.457	Why? Because you're all too old.
325.005	I know that's going to come as a shock
325.005	to some of you, but you are.
328.241	And before you get offended and leave,
330.144	I've got to say that being too old,
331.984	in this case, means that pretty much
331.984	everyone in the room, I think,
335.556	is over five years of age.
339.465	We're really concerned
339.465	with kids naught to five.
342.25	And why?
343.946	Washing is the antidote
343.946	to the sort of bugs,
348.771	the common infectious diseases
348.771	of the eyes, the ears,
352.018	the chest and the skin
354.438	that, if they occur in the first
354.438	five years of life,
357.334	permanently damage those organs.
361.515	They leave a lifelong remnant.
365.123	That means that by the age of five,
367.249	you can't see as well
367.249	for the rest of your life.
369.559	You can't hear as well
369.559	for the rest of your life.
372.073	You can't breathe as well.
373.439	You've lost a third of your lung
373.439	capacity by the age of five.
376.953	And even skin infection,
378.82	which we originally thought
378.82	wasn't that big a problem,
382.4	mild skin infections
382.4	naught to five give you
384.649	a greatly increased
384.649	chance of renal failure,
387.129	needing dialysis at age 40.
390.364	This is a big deal, so the ticks
390.364	and crosses on the screen
393.283	are actually critical for young kids.
396.697	Those ticks and crosses
396.697	represent the 7,800 houses
399.83	we've looked at nationally
399.83	around Australia,
401.918	the same proportion.
403.351	What you see on the screen --
408.087	lived in by 50,000 indigenous people --
414.167	Ten percent of those same 7,800 houses
414.167	had safe electrical systems.
420.52	And 58 percent of those houses
420.52	had a working toilet.
427.691	These are by a simple, standard test.
430.457	In the case of the shower:
432.882	does it have hot and cold water,
432.882	two taps that work,
437.414	a shower rose to get water
437.414	onto your head or onto your body,
442.187	and a drain that takes the water away?
444.045	Not well-designed,
444.045	not beautiful, not elegant --
448.117	just that they function.
449.308	And the same tests
449.308	for the electrical system
451.555	and the toilets.
453.811	Housing for Health projects
453.811	aren't about measuring failure --
456.767	they're actually about improving houses.
459.475	We start on day one of every project.
463.393	We've learned -- we don't make promises,
463.393	we don't do reports.
466.656	We arrive in the morning with tools,
466.656	tons of equipment, trades,
472.002	and we train up a local team
472.002	on the first day to start work.
475.51	By the evening of the first day,
477.314	a few houses in that community are better
477.314	than when we started in the morning.
481.749	That work continues for six to 12 months,
484.028	until all the houses are improved
485.75	and we've spent our budget
485.75	of 7,500 dollars total per house.
490.375	That's our average budget.
492.451	At the end of six months to a year,
492.451	we test every house again.
496.771	It's very easy to spend money.
498.856	It's very difficult to improve
501.198	the function of all those
501.198	parts of the house.
503.627	And for a whole house,
503.627	the nine healthy living practices,
506.647	we test, check and fix
511.161	And these are the results we can get
511.161	with our 7,500 dollars.
515.275	We can get showers
515.275	up to 86 percent working,
517.901	we can get electrical systems
517.901	up to 77 percent working
521.716	and we can get 90 percent
521.716	of toilets working
524.373	in those 7,500 houses.
527.226	(Applause)
528.431	Thank you.
529.703	(Applause)
536.021	The teams do a great job,
536.021	and that's their work.
540.816	I think there's an obvious question
542.956	that I hope you're thinking about.
545.593	Why do we have to do this work?
548.059	Why are the houses in such poor condition?
551.271	Seventy percent of the work we do
551.271	is due to lack of routine maintenance --
554.832	the sort of things that happen
554.832	in all our houses.
557.261	Things wear out, should have been done
557.261	by state government or local government,
561.168	simply not done, the house doesn't work.
564.378	Twenty-one percent of the things we fix
564.378	are due to faulty construction --
568.293	literally things that are built
568.293	upside down and back to front.
571.318	They don't work, we have to fix them.
574.081	And if you've lived in Australia
574.081	in the last 30 years, the final cause --
579.705	you will have heard always
579.705	that indigenous people trash houses.
583.384	It's one of the almost
583.384	rock-solid pieces of evidence
586.846	which I've never seen evidence for,
588.885	"that's always reeled out as ""That's"
588.885	"the problem with indigenous housing."""
592.369	Well, nine percent
592.369	of what we spend is damage,
594.563	misuse or abuse of any sort.
598.12	We argue strongly that the people
598.12	living in the house
601.189	are simply not the problem.
603.384	And we'll go a lot further than that;
605.206	the people living in the house
605.206	are actually a major part of the solution.
609.749	Seventy-five percent
609.749	of our national team in Australia --
613.138	over 75 at the minute --
615.615	are actually local, indigenous people
615.615	from the communities we work in.
619.967	They do all aspects of the work.
622.192	(Applause)
627.953	In 2010, for example, there were 831,
631.835	all over Australia,
631.835	and the Torres Strait Islands,
634.432	all states, working to improve the houses
634.432	where they and their families live,
638.915	and that's an important thing.
641.198	Our work's always had a focus on health.
644.332	That's the key.
646.434	The developing world bug,
646.434	trachoma, causes blindness.
649.918	It's a developing-world illness,
652.308	and yet, the picture you see behind
654.161	is in an Aboriginal community
654.161	in the late 1990s,
657.981	where 95 percent of school-aged
657.981	kids had active trachoma
662.005	in their eyes, doing damage.
665.142	OK, what do we do?
666.442	Well, first thing we do,
666.442	we get showers working.
669.769	Why? Because that flushes the bug out.
671.634	We put washing facilities
671.634	in the school as well,
673.999	so kids can wash their faces
673.999	many times during the day.
676.76	We wash the bug out.
678.673	Second, the eye doctors tell us
678.673	that dust scours the eye
682.538	and lets the bug in quick.
683.879	So what do we do?
685.112	We call up the doctor of dust,
685.112	and there is such a person.
688.636	He was loaned to us by a mining company.
690.586	He controls dust on mining company sites.
693.28	And he came out and, within a day,
695.107	it worked out that most dust
695.107	in this community
697.322	was within a meter of the ground,
697.322	the wind-driven dust --
700.596	so he suggested making mounds
700.596	to catch the dust
703.501	before it went into the house area
703.501	and affected the eyes of kids.
707.247	So we used dirt to stop dust.
710.814	We did it. He provided us dust monitors.
713.606	We tested and we reduced the dust.
716.086	Then we wanted to get rid
716.086	of the bug generally.
718.311	So how do we do that?
719.485	Well, we call up the doctor of flies --
719.485	and, yes, there is a doctor of flies.
724.728	As our Aboriginal mate said,
726.306	"""You white fellows ought to get out more."""
728.441	(Laughter)
730.695	And the doctor of flies
730.695	very quickly determined
733.824	that there was one fly
733.824	that carried the bug.
737.926	He could give school kids
737.926	in this community
740.373	the beautiful fly trap you see
740.373	above in the slide.
743.575	They could trap the flies,
743.575	send them to him in Perth.
746.635	When the bug was in the gut,
748.112	he'd send back by return post
748.112	some dung beetles.
751.103	The dung beetles ate the camel dung,
753.42	the flies died through lack of food,
755.19	and trachoma dropped.
756.523	And over the year, trachoma dropped
756.523	radically in this place, and stayed low.
762.36	We changed the environment,
762.36	not just treated the eyes.
767.079	And finally, you get a good eye.
770.81	All these small health gains
772.729	and small pieces of the puzzle
772.729	make a big difference.
775.975	The New South Wales Department of Health,
777.982	that radical organization,
779.283	did an independent trial over three years
782.847	to look at 10 years of the work
782.847	we've been doing
785.444	in these sorts of projects
785.444	in New South Wales.
787.936	And they found a 40 percent reduction
787.936	in hospital admissions
793.504	for the illnesses that you could attribute
793.504	to the poor environment --
797.258	a 40 percent reduction.
799.652	(Applause)
807.845	Just to show that the principles
807.845	we've used in Australia
810.591	can be used in other places,
811.953	I'm just going to go
811.953	to one other place, and that's Nepal.
814.715	And what a beautiful place to go.
816.35	We were asked by a small
816.35	village of 600 people
819.735	to go in and make toilets
819.735	where none existed.
823.764	Health was poor.
826.27	We went in with no grand plan,
827.763	no grand promises of a great program,
829.914	just the offer to build
829.914	two toilets for two families.
833.146	It was during the design
833.146	of the first toilet
836.518	that I went for lunch,
837.801	invited by the family
837.801	into their main room of the house.
840.874	It was choking with smoke.
842.898	People were cooking
842.898	on their only fuel source, green timber.
846.497	The smoke coming off
846.497	that timber is choking,
848.618	and in an enclosed house,
848.618	you simply can't breathe.
852.048	Later we found the leading cause
852.048	of illness and death
855.962	in this particular region
855.962	is through respiratory failure.
859.541	So all of a sudden, we had two problems.
861.689	We were there originally
861.689	to look at toilets
863.777	and get human waste
863.777	off the ground, that's fine.
866.099	But all of a sudden now
866.099	there was a second problem:
869.037	How do we actually get the smoke down?
870.886	So two problems, and design should
870.886	be about more than one thing.
874.946	Solution: Take human waste,
874.946	take animal waste,
878.54	put it into a chamber,
878.54	out of that, extract biogas,
881.922	methane gas.
883.585	The gas gives three to four
883.585	hours cooking a day --
887.01	clean, smokeless and free for the family.
890.674	(Applause)
895.842	I put it to you:
895.842	is this eliminating poverty?
898.75	And the answer from the Nepali team
898.75	who's working at the minute would say,
903.186	don't be ridiculous --
904.361	we have three million
904.361	more toilets to build
906.457	before we can even make
906.457	a stab at that claim.
909.332	And I don't pretend anything else.
912.315	But as we all sit here today,
914.997	there are now over 100 toilets built
916.857	in this village and a couple nearby.
919.294	Well over 1,000 people use those toilets.
922.767	Yami Lama, he's a young boy.
925.966	He's got significantly less gut infection
925.966	because he's now got toilets,
930.294	and there isn't human waste on the ground.
934.04	Kanji Maya, she's a mother,
934.04	and a proud one.
937.381	She's probably right now
937.381	cooking lunch for her family
941.848	on biogas, smokeless fuel.
944.317	Her lungs have got better,
945.587	and they'll get better as time increases,
947.587	because she's not cooking
947.587	in the same smoke.
949.792	Surya takes the waste
949.792	out of the biogas chamber
952.418	when it's shed the gas,
952.418	he puts it on his crops.
955.359	He's trebled his crop income,
958.081	more food for the family
958.081	and more money for the family.
961.02	And finally Bishnu,
961.02	the leader of the team,
965.798	has now understood that not only
965.798	have we built toilets,
968.985	we've also built a team,
971.161	and that team is now
971.161	working in two villages
973.817	where they're training up
973.817	the next two villages
976.314	to keep the work expanding.
978.168	And that, to me, is the key.
979.817	(Applause)
984.508	People are not the problem.
988.609	We've never found that.
990.22	The problem: poor living environment,
992.939	poor housing and the bugs
992.939	that do people harm.
997.137	None of those are limited by geography,
997.137	by skin color or by religion.
1002.9	None of them.
1005.087	The common link between all
1005.087	the work we've had to do
1007.564	is one thing, and that's poverty.
1011.41	Nelson Mandela said, in the mid-2000s,
1011.41	not too far from here,
1015.211	he said that like slavery and apartheid,
1015.211	"""Poverty is not natural."
1021.516	It is man-made and can be
1021.516	overcome and eradicated
1025.399	"by the actions of human beings."""
1028.864	I want to end by saying
1030.197	it's been the actions of thousands
1030.197	of ordinary human beings
1036.378	doing -- I think -- extraordinary work,
1039.627	that have actually improved health,
1042.295	and, maybe only in a small way,
1042.295	reduced poverty.
1045.44	Thank you very much for your time.
1047.136	(Applause)
