25	With all the legitimate concerns
25	about AIDS and avian flu --
28	and we'll hear about that from the
30	brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --
32	I want to talk about the other
32	pandemic, which is
34.358	cardiovascular disease,
34.358	diabetes, hypertension --
37	all of which are completely
37	preventable for at
40	least 95 percent of people
42	just by changing diet and lifestyle.
43	And what's happening is that there's a
44	globalization of illness
44	occurring, that people
46.263	are starting to eat like us,
46.263	and live like us, and
49	die like us. And
49	in one generation, for example,
52	Asia's gone from having
52	one of the lowest rates of
54	heart disease and obesity
54	and diabetes to one
56.167	of the highest. And in Africa,
56.167	cardiovascular disease
59	equals the HIV and AIDS deaths
62	in most countries.
63	So there's a critical
63	window of opportunity we
65	have to make an important
65	difference that can
67	affect the lives of literally
67	millions of people,
69	and practice preventive
69	medicine on a global
71.12	scale.
72	Heart and blood vessel
72	diseases still kill more
74.215	people -- not only in this
74.215	country, but also
76.335	worldwide -- than everything
76.335	else combined, and yet
79	it's completely preventable
79	for almost everybody.
82	It's not only preventable; it's actually
84	reversible. And for the last
84	almost 29 years,
86.167	we've been able to show
86.167	that by simply changing
88.43	diet and lifestyle, using
88.43	these very high-tech,
91	expensive, state-of-the-art
91	measures to prove how
93.358	powerful these very simple
93.358	and low-tech and low-cost
96	interventions can be like -- quantitative
98	arteriography,
98	before and after a year, and
100.072	cardiac PET scans.
101	We showed a few months
101	ago -- we published the
103	first study showing you
103	can actually stop or
105.12	reverse the progression
105.12	of prostate cancer by
107.287	making changes in diet
107.287	and lifestyle, and 70 percent
110	regression in the tumor
110	growth, or inhibition of
114	the tumor growth, compared
114	to only nine percent in the
116	control group.
117	And in the MRI and MR
117	spectroscopy here, the
119.12	prostate tumor activity
119.12	is shown in red -- you can
121.12	see it diminishing after a year.
123	Now there is an epidemic
123	of obesity: two-thirds of
126	adults and 15 percent of kids.
126	What's really concerning
129	to me is that diabetes has
129	increased 70 percent in the
132	past 10 years, and this may be the first
134	generation in which our kids
134	live a shorter life
136	span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's
138	preventable.
139	Now these are not election
139	returns, these are the
142	people -- the number
142	of the people who are obese
144.31	by state, beginning in '85,
144.31	'86, '87 -- these are
148	from the CDC website --
148	'88, '89, '90, '91 -- you
152	get a new category --
152	'92, '93, '94, '95, '96,
156	'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001
156	-- it gets worse. We're
161	kind of devolving. (Laughter)
166	Now what can we do about this?
166	Well, you know, the
169	diet that we've found
169	that can reverse heart
170	disease and cancer is an Asian diet.
172	But the people in Asia
172	are starting to eat like we
174	are, which is why they're
174	starting to get sick
175	like we are.
176	So I've been working
176	with a lot of the big food
178	companies. They can make
178	it fun and sexy and hip
180	and crunchy and convenient
180	to eat healthier foods,
182.405	like -- I chair the advisory
182.405	boards to McDonald's,
185	and PepsiCo, and ConAgra,
185	and Safeway, and soon
187	Del Monte, and they're
187	finding that it's good
189.167	business.
190	The salads that you see
190	at McDonald's came from
191	the work -- they're going
191	to have an Asian salad. At
193	Pepsi, two-thirds
193	of their revenue growth came
195	from their better foods.
196	And so if we can do that,
196	then we can free up
198.167	resources for buying drugs
198.167	that you really do need
201	for treating AIDS and HIV
201	and malaria and for
204	preventing avian flu. Thank you.
