13.24	Here's a startling fact:
15.095	in the 45 years since the introduction
15.095	of the automated teller machine,
18.84	those vending machines that dispense cash,
21.72	the number of human bank tellers
21.72	employed in the United States
24.92	has roughly doubled,
26.2	from about a quarter of a million
26.2	to a half a million.
29.52	A quarter of a million in 1970
29.52	to about a half a million today,
32.58	with 100,000 added since the year 2000.
36.84	These facts, revealed in a recent book
39.28	by Boston University
39.28	economist James Bessen,
42.44	raise an intriguing question:
44.64	what are all those tellers doing,
46.56	and why hasn't automation
46.56	eliminated their employment by now?
50.6	If you think about it,
51.96	many of the great inventions
51.96	of the last 200 years
55.12	were designed to replace human labor.
58.72	Tractors were developed
60.52	to substitute mechanical power
60.52	for human physical toil.
64.88	Assembly lines were engineered
67.24	to replace inconsistent human handiwork
70.6	with machine perfection.
72.56	Computers were programmed to swap out
75.8	error-prone, inconsistent
75.8	human calculation
78.48	with digital perfection.
80.76	These inventions have worked.
82.96	We no longer dig ditches by hand,
85.04	pound tools out of wrought iron
87.12	or do bookkeeping using actual books.
90.24	And yet, the fraction of US adults
90.24	employed in the labor market
95	is higher now in 2016
97.88	than it was 125 years ago, in 1890,
100.64	and it's risen in just about every decade
103.68	in the intervening 125 years.
106.56	This poses a paradox.
108.76	Our machines increasingly
108.76	do our work for us.
111.84	Why doesn't this make our labor redundant
111.84	and our skills obsolete?
116	Why are there still so many jobs?
119.72	(Laughter)
121.48	I'm going to try to answer
121.48	that question tonight,
123.84	and along the way, I'm going to tell you
123.84	what this means for the future of work
127.6	and the challenges that automation
127.6	does and does not pose
131.8	for our society.
134.52	Why are there so many jobs?
137.68	There are actually two fundamental
137.68	economic principles at stake.
141.08	One has to do with human genius
143.8	and creativity.
145.24	The other has to do
145.24	with human insatiability,
148.12	or greed, if you like.
149.72	I'm going to call the first of these
149.72	the O-ring principle,
152.48	and it determines
152.48	the type of work that we do.
154.68	The second principle
154.68	is the never-get-enough principle,
157.32	and it determines how many jobs
157.32	there actually are.
161.44	Let's start with the O-ring.
163.8	ATMs, automated teller machines,
166.6	had two countervailing effects
166.6	on bank teller employment.
169.96	As you would expect,
169.96	they replaced a lot of teller tasks.
172.68	The number of tellers per branch
172.68	fell by about a third.
176.24	But banks quickly discovered that it
176.24	also was cheaper to open new branches,
180.08	and the number of bank branches
180.08	increased by about 40 percent
183.24	in the same time period.
184.76	The net result was more branches
184.76	and more tellers.
189.44	But those tellers were doing
189.44	somewhat different work.
192.88	As their routine,
192.88	cash-handling tasks receded,
196.56	they became less like checkout clerks
198.72	and more like salespeople,
200.56	forging relationships with customers,
202.64	solving problems
203.88	and introducing them to new products
203.88	like credit cards, loans and investments:
208.12	more tellers doing
208.12	a more cognitively demanding job.
212.84	There's a general principle here.
215.12	Most of the work that we do
216.84	requires a multiplicity of skills,
221.16	and brains and brawn,
224.36	technical expertise and intuitive mastery,
228	perspiration and inspiration
228	in the words of Thomas Edison.
231.48	In general, automating
231.48	some subset of those tasks
234.76	doesn't make the other ones unnecessary.
237	In fact, it makes them more important.
241.08	It increases their economic value.
243.08	Let me give you a stark example.
245.12	In 1986, the space shuttle Challenger
248.96	exploded and crashed back down to Earth
251.28	less than two minutes after takeoff.
253.72	The cause of that crash, it turned out,
256.84	was an inexpensive rubber O-ring
256.84	in the booster rocket
260.4	that had frozen on the launchpad
260.4	the night before
263.28	and failed catastrophically
263.28	moments after takeoff.
266.68	In this multibillion dollar enterprise
269.519	that simple rubber O-ring
271.24	made the difference
271.24	between mission success
273.839	and the calamitous death
273.839	of seven astronauts.
277.6	An ingenious metaphor
277.6	for this tragic setting
281.36	is the O-ring production function,
283.6	named by Harvard economist Michael Kremer
286.12	after the Challenger disaster.
288.16	The O-ring production function
288.16	conceives of the work
290.76	as a series of interlocking steps,
293.12	links in a chain.
294.4	Every one of those links must hold
294.4	for the mission to succeed.
298.12	If any of them fails,
300.28	the mission, or the product
300.28	or the service,
303.6	comes crashing down.
305.56	This precarious situation
305.56	has a surprisingly positive implication,
310.52	which is that improvements
312.44	in the reliability
312.44	of any one link in the chain
315.44	increases the value
315.44	of improving any of the other links.
319.24	Concretely, if most of the links
319.24	are brittle and prone to breakage,
324.24	the fact that your link
324.24	is not that reliable
326.72	is not that important.
328	Probably something else will break anyway.
330.024	But as all the other links
330.024	become robust and reliable,
334.04	the importance of your link
334.04	becomes more essential.
337.56	In the limit, everything depends upon it.
340.64	The reason the O-ring was critical
340.64	to space shuttle Challenger
344.2	is because everything else
344.2	worked perfectly.
347.48	If the Challenger were
347.48	kind of the space era equivalent
350.08	of Microsoft Windows 2000 --
352.64	(Laughter)
354.76	the reliability of the O-ring
354.76	wouldn't have mattered
357.24	because the machine would have crashed.
359.122	(Laughter)
361.96	Here's the broader point.
363.56	In much of the work that we do,
363.56	we are the O-rings.
367.4	Yes, ATMs could do
367.4	certain cash-handling tasks
370.96	faster and better than tellers,
374	but that didn't make tellers superfluous.
376.08	It increased the importance
376.08	of their problem-solving skills
379.4	and their relationships with customers.
382.04	The same principle applies
382.04	if we're building a building,
385.36	if we're diagnosing
385.36	and caring for a patient,
387.92	or if we are teaching a class
391.08	to a roomful of high schoolers.
393.56	As our tools improve,
395.96	technology magnifies our leverage
398.08	and increases the importance
398.08	of our expertise
402	and our judgment and our creativity.
405	And that brings me
405	to the second principle:
408.16	never get enough.
410.28	You may be thinking, OK, O-ring, got it,
412.72	that says the jobs that people do
412.72	will be important.
415.84	They can't be done by machines,
415.84	but they still need to be done.
418.84	But that doesn't tell me
418.84	how many jobs there will need to be.
421.76	If you think about it,
421.76	isn't it kind of self-evident
424.24	that once we get sufficiently
424.24	productive at something,
426.8	we've basically
426.8	worked our way out of a job?
428.92	In 1900, 40 percent of all US employment
431.72	was on farms.
433	Today, it's less than two percent.
435.28	Why are there so few farmers today?
437.48	It's not because we're eating less.
439.36	(Laughter)
442.04	A century of productivity
442.04	growth in farming
444.8	means that now,
444.8	a couple of million farmers
447	can feed a nation of 320 million.
449.76	That's amazing progress,
451.44	but it also means there are
451.44	only so many O-ring jobs left in farming.
455.6	So clearly, technology can eliminate jobs.
458.64	Farming is only one example.
460.4	There are many others like it.
463.44	But what's true about a single product
463.44	or service or industry
467.44	has never been true
467.44	about the economy as a whole.
470.24	Many of the industries
470.24	in which we now work --
472.76	health and medicine,
474.92	finance and insurance,
477.16	electronics and computing --
479.72	were tiny or barely existent
479.72	a century ago.
482.48	Many of the products
482.48	that we spend a lot of our money on --
485.32	air conditioners, sport utility vehicles,
487.48	computers and mobile devices --
489.2	were unattainably expensive,
490.88	or just hadn't been invented
490.88	a century ago.
493.92	As automation frees our time,
493.92	increases the scope of what is possible,
498.92	we invent new products,
498.92	new ideas, new services
502.16	that command our attention,
503.76	occupy our time
505.32	and spur consumption.
507.76	You may think some
507.76	of these things are frivolous --
511	extreme yoga, adventure tourism,
513.8	Pok√©mon GO --
515.08	and I might agree with you.
516.979	But people desire these things,
516.979	and they're willing to work hard for them.
520.48	The average worker in 2015
522.68	wanting to attain
522.68	the average living standard in 1915
526.96	could do so by working
526.96	just 17 weeks a year,
530.32	one third of the time.
532.24	But most people don't choose to do that.
534.44	They are willing to work hard
536.159	to harvest the technological bounty
536.159	that is available to them.
540.48	Material abundance has never
540.48	eliminated perceived scarcity.
544.6	In the words of economist
544.6	Thorstein Veblen,
547.2	invention is the mother of necessity.
551.52	Now ...
553.4	So if you accept these two principles,
555.28	the O-ring principle
555.28	and the never-get-enough principle,
558.2	then you agree with me.
559.56	There will be jobs.
561.56	Does that mean there's
561.56	nothing to worry about?
563.76	Automation, employment, robots and jobs --
566.56	it'll all take care of itself?
569.12	No.
570.36	That is not my argument.
572.44	Automation creates wealth
575	by allowing us to do
575	more work in less time.
577.6	There is no economic law
579.2	that says that we
579.2	will use that wealth well,
582	and that is worth worrying about.
584.8	Consider two countries,
586.64	Norway and Saudi Arabia.
588.8	Both oil-rich nations,
590.4	it's like they have money
590.4	spurting out of a hole in the ground.
594	(Laughter)
595.56	But they haven't used that wealth
595.56	equally well to foster human prosperity,
600.8	human prospering.
602.44	Norway is a thriving democracy.
605.2	By and large, its citizens
605.2	work and play well together.
608.88	It's typically numbered
608.88	between first and fourth
611.92	in rankings of national happiness.
614.68	Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy
617.36	in which many citizens
617.36	lack a path for personal advancement.
621	It's typically ranked 35th
621	among nations in happiness,
624.52	which is low for such a wealthy nation.
626.64	Just by way of comparison,
628	the US is typically ranked
628	around 12th or 13th.
631.4	The difference between these two countries
633.52	is not their wealth
634.8	and it's not their technology.
636.56	It's their institutions.
638.56	Norway has invested to build a society
641.76	with opportunity and economic mobility.
645.12	Saudi Arabia has raised living standards
647.32	while frustrating
647.32	many other human strivings.
650.6	Two countries, both wealthy,
653.4	not equally well off.
655.88	And this brings me
655.88	to the challenge that we face today,
660.24	the challenge that
660.24	automation poses for us.
662.4	The challenge is not
662.4	that we're running out of work.
664.88	The US has added 14 million jobs
666.84	since the depths of the Great Recession.
669	The challenge is that many of those jobs
671.56	are not good jobs,
672.88	and many citizens
672.88	cannot qualify for the good jobs
676	that are being created.
677.84	Employment growth in the United States
677.84	and in much of the developed world
681.36	looks something like a barbell
682.84	with increasing poundage
682.84	on either end of the bar.
686.24	On the one hand,
687.48	you have high-education, high-wage jobs
690.32	like doctors and nurses,
690.32	programmers and engineers,
693.92	marketing and sales managers.
695.68	Employment is robust in these jobs,
695.68	employment growth.
698.72	Similarly, employment growth
698.72	is robust in many low-skill,
702.76	low-education jobs like food service,
705.84	cleaning, security,
708.12	home health aids.
710.08	Simultaneously, employment is shrinking
713.2	in many middle-education,
713.2	middle-wage, middle-class jobs,
717.28	like blue-collar production
717.28	and operative positions
721.12	and white-collar
721.12	clerical and sales positions.
724.12	The reasons behind this contracting middle
726.4	are not mysterious.
727.64	Many of those middle-skill jobs
729.64	use well-understood rules and procedures
732.16	that can increasingly
732.16	be codified in software
735.28	and executed by computers.
738.2	The challenge that
738.2	this phenomenon creates,
741.6	what economists call
741.6	employment polarization,
744.16	is that it knocks out rungs
744.16	in the economic ladder,
746.8	shrinks the size of the middle class
748.64	and threatens to make us
748.64	a more stratified society.
751.8	On the one hand, a set of highly paid,
751.8	highly educated professionals
755.88	doing interesting work,
757.32	on the other, a large number
757.32	of citizens in low-paid jobs
760.76	whose primary responsibility is to see
760.76	to the comfort and health of the affluent.
766.44	That is not my vision of progress,
768.8	and I doubt that it is yours.
771.44	But here is some encouraging news.
773.48	We have faced equally momentous
773.48	economic transformations in the past,
778.36	and we have come
778.36	through them successfully.
781.08	In the late 1800s and early 1900s,
786.04	when automation was eliminating
786.04	vast numbers of agricultural jobs --
790.6	remember that tractor? --
792.96	the farm states faced a threat
792.96	of mass unemployment,
795.68	a generation of youth
795.68	no longer needed on the farm
799.52	but not prepared for industry.
802.08	Rising to this challenge,
803.68	they took the radical step
805.2	of requiring that
805.2	their entire youth population
808.04	remain in school
808.04	and continue their education
810.92	to the ripe old age of 16.
813.6	This was called the high school movement,
815.6	and it was a radically
815.6	expensive thing to do.
818.44	Not only did they have
818.44	to invest in the schools,
820.72	but those kids couldn't work
820.72	at their jobs.
823.44	It also turned out to be
823.44	one of the best investments
826.76	the US made in the 20th century.
829	It gave us the most skilled,
829	the most flexible
831.36	and the most productive
831.36	workforce in the world.
834.08	To see how well this worked,
834.08	imagine taking the labor force of 1899
838.64	and bringing them into the present.
840.88	Despite their strong backs
840.88	and good characters,
843.84	many of them would lack
843.84	the basic literacy and numeracy skills
847.64	to do all but the most mundane jobs.
850.6	Many of them would be unemployable.
853.84	What this example highlights
853.84	is the primacy of our institutions,
857.6	most especially our schools,
859.4	in allowing us to reap the harvest
861.96	of our technological prosperity.
864.28	It's foolish to say
864.28	there's nothing to worry about.
866.72	Clearly we can get this wrong.
869.64	If the US had not invested
869.64	in its schools and in its skills
873.16	a century ago with
873.16	the high school movement,
875.44	we would be a less prosperous,
877.12	a less mobile and probably
877.12	a lot less happy society.
880.76	But it's equally foolish
880.76	to say that our fates are sealed.
883.52	That's not decided by the machines.
885.24	It's not even decided by the market.
887	It's decided by us
887	and by our institutions.
890.36	Now, I started this talk with a paradox.
892.96	Our machines increasingly
892.96	do our work for us.
895.64	Why doesn't that make
895.64	our labor superfluous,
897.92	our skills redundant?
899.16	Isn't it obvious that the road
899.16	to our economic and social hell
902.6	is paved with our own great inventions?
906.04	History has repeatedly offered
906.04	an answer to that paradox.
910.24	The first part of the answer
910.24	is that technology magnifies our leverage,
913.88	increases the importance, the added value
916.52	of our expertise,
916.52	our judgment and our creativity.
920.08	That's the O-ring.
921.88	The second part of the answer
921.88	is our endless inventiveness
924.64	and bottomless desires
926.12	means that we never get enough,
926.12	never get enough.
928.48	There's always new work to do.
931.96	Adjusting to the rapid pace
931.96	of technological change
935.32	creates real challenges,
936.8	seen most clearly
936.8	in our polarized labor market
939.8	and the threat that it poses
939.8	to economic mobility.
943.32	Rising to this challenge is not automatic.
946.4	It's not costless.
947.92	It's not easy.
949.36	But it is feasible.
951.12	And here is some encouraging news.
952.96	Because of our amazing productivity,
955.12	we're rich.
956.4	Of course we can afford
956.4	to invest in ourselves and in our children
959.56	as America did a hundred years ago
959.56	with the high school movement.
962.92	Arguably, we can't afford not to.
966.12	Now, you may be thinking,
967.92	Professor Autor has told us
967.92	a heartwarming tale
970.8	about the distant past,
972.6	the recent past,
974	maybe the present,
974	but probably not the future.
977.32	Because everybody knows
977.32	that this time is different.
981.28	Right? Is this time different?
984.12	Of course this time is different.
986.04	Every time is different.
987.76	On numerous occasions
987.76	in the last 200 years,
991.4	scholars and activists
991.4	have raised the alarm
994.2	that we are running out of work
994.2	and making ourselves obsolete:
997.76	for example, the Luddites
997.76	in the early 1800s;
1002.4	US Secretary of Labor James Davis
1005.36	in the mid-1920s;
1007.8	Nobel Prize-winning economist
1007.8	Wassily Leontief in 1982;
1013	and of course, many scholars,
1016.28	pundits, technologists
1018.44	and media figures today.
1021.6	These predictions strike me as arrogant.
1025.8	These self-proclaimed oracles
1025.8	are in effect saying,
1028.52	"""If I can't think of what people"
1028.52	will do for work in the future,
1031.96	then you, me and our kids
1034.88	"aren't going to think of it either."""
1037.76	I don't have the guts
1039.72	to take that bet against human ingenuity.
1042.92	Look, I can't tell you
1042.92	what people are going to do for work
1045.92	a hundred years from now.
1047.839	But the future doesn't hinge
1047.839	on my imagination.
1051.28	If I were a farmer in Iowa
1051.28	in the year 1900,
1055.079	and an economist from the 21st century
1055.079	teleported down to my field
1058.64	"and said, ""Hey, guess what, farmer Autor,"
1062	in the next hundred years,
1063.56	agricultural employment is going to fall
1063.56	from 40 percent of all jobs
1067.36	to two percent
1068.6	purely due to rising productivity.
1071.4	What do you think the other
1075.4	"I would not have said, ""Oh, we got this."
1078.24	We'll do app development,
1078.24	radiological medicine,
1081.12	"yoga instruction, Bitmoji."""
1084.12	(Laughter)
1085.68	I wouldn't have had a clue.
1087.84	But I hope I would have had
1087.84	the wisdom to say,
1090.36	"""Wow, a 95 percent reduction"
1090.36	in farm employment
1094.4	with no shortage of food.
1096.56	That's an amazing amount of progress.
1099	I hope that humanity
1099	finds something remarkable to do
1102.4	"with all of that prosperity."""
1105.12	And by and large, I would say that it has.
1109.96	Thank you very much.
1111.24	(Applause)
