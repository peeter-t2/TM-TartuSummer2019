12.763	You're looking at a woman
12.763	who was publicly silent for a decade.
18.711	Obviously, that's changed,
20.967	but only recently.
23.051	It was several months ago
24.629	that I gave my very first
24.629	major public talk
27.602	at the Forbes 30 Under 30 summit:
30.217	1,500 brilliant people,
30.217	all under the age of 30.
35.101	That meant that in 1998,
37.865	the oldest among the group were only 14,
41.452	and the youngest, just four.
45.039	I joked with them that some
45.039	might only have heard of me
48.628	from rap songs.
50.58	Yes, I'm in rap songs.
53.727	Almost 40 rap songs. (Laughter)
58.614	But the night of my speech,
58.614	a surprising thing happened.
62.109	At the age of 41, I was hit on
62.109	by a 27-year-old guy.
69.155	I know, right?
72.301	He was charming and I was flattered,
74.914	and I declined.
77.387	You know what his
77.387	unsuccessful pickup line was?
81.141	He could make me feel 22 again.
84.461	(Laughter) (Applause)
90.637	I realized later that night,
90.637	I'm probably the only person over 40
95.908	who does not want to be 22 again.
98.509	(Laughter)
101.109	(Applause)
107.269	At the age of 22,
107.269	I fell in love with my boss,
112.294	and at the age of 24,
115.115	I learned the devastating consequences.
119.667	Can I see a show of hands of anyone here
122.848	who didn't make a mistake
122.848	or do something they regretted at 22?
129.151	Yep. That's what I thought.
132.648	So like me, at 22, a few of you
132.648	may have also taken wrong turns
138.428	and fallen in love with the wrong person,
141.466	maybe even your boss.
144.378	Unlike me, though, your boss
146.973	probably wasn't the president
146.973	of the United States of America.
151.802	Of course, life is full of surprises.
156.098	Not a day goes by that I'm not
156.098	reminded of my mistake,
161.021	and I regret that mistake deeply.
165.404	In 1998, after having been swept up
165.404	into an improbable romance,
172.026	I was then swept up into the eye
172.026	of a political, legal and media maelstrom
177.488	like we had never seen before.
181.535	Remember, just a few years earlier,
183.877	news was consumed from just three places:
186.879	reading a newspaper or magazine,
189.551	listening to the radio,
191.386	or watching television.
193.004	That was it.
194.304	But that wasn't my fate.
198.259	Instead, this scandal was brought to you
201.881	by the digital revolution.
204.281	That meant we could access
204.281	all the information we wanted,
207.988	when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere,
212.283	and when the story broke in January 1998,
216.973	it broke online.
219.759	It was the first time the traditional news
222.76	was usurped by the Internet
222.76	for a major news story,
227.283	a click that reverberated
227.283	around the world.
232.484	What that meant for me personally
234.922	was that overnight I went
234.922	from being a completely private figure
240.04	to a publicly humiliated one worldwide.
245.487	I was patient zero
245.487	of losing a personal reputation
249.782	on a global scale almost instantaneously.
255.588	This rush to judgment,
255.588	enabled by technology,
257.927	led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.
262.042	Granted, it was before social media,
265.101	but people could still comment online,
268.653	email stories, and, of course,
268.653	email cruel jokes.
274.881	News sources plastered
274.881	photos of me all over
277.97	to sell newspapers, banner ads online,
281.754	and to keep people tuned to the TV.
285.913	Do you recall a particular image of me,
289.462	say, wearing a beret?
293.224	Now, I admit I made mistakes,
296.219	especially wearing that beret.
300.267	But the attention and judgment
300.267	that I received, not the story,
304.556	but that I personally received,
304.556	was unprecedented.
308.92	I was branded as a tramp,
312.079	tart, slut, whore, bimbo,
318.627	and, of course, that woman.
322.455	I was seen by many
325.22	but actually known by few.
328.608	And I get it: it was easy to forget
332.186	that that woman was dimensional,
334.787	had a soul, and was once unbroken.
341.505	When this happened to me 17 years ago,
341.505	there was no name for it.
346.404	Now we call it cyberbullying
346.404	and online harassment.
352.421	Today, I want to share
352.421	some of my experience with you,
355.917	talk about how that experience has helped
355.917	shape my cultural observations,
360.351	and how I hope my past experience
360.351	can lead to a change that results
365.203	in less suffering for others.
370.221	In 1998, I lost my reputation
370.221	and my dignity.
375.494	I lost almost everything,
378.994	and I almost lost my life.
384.905	Let me paint a picture for you.
389.319	It is September of 1998.
392.866	I'm sitting in a windowless office room
395.552	inside the Office
395.552	of the Independent Counsel
398.616	underneath humming fluorescent lights.
403.051	I'm listening to the sound of my voice,
406.882	my voice on surreptitiously
406.882	taped phone calls
410.62	that a supposed friend
410.62	had made the year before.
413.756	I'm here because
413.756	I've been legally required
417.331	to personally authenticate
417.331	all 20 hours of taped conversation.
425.194	For the past eight months,
425.194	the mysterious content of these tapes
429.181	has hung like the Sword
429.181	of Damocles over my head.
433.129	I mean, who can remember
433.129	what they said a year ago?
437.215	Scared and mortified, I listen,
443.013	listen as I prattle on
443.013	about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;
447.555	listen as I confess my love
447.555	for the president,
451.426	and, of course, my heartbreak;
454.805	listen to my sometimes catty,
454.805	sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self
459.623	being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;
465.262	listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,
468.121	to the worst version of myself,
470.805	a self I don't even recognize.
476.537	A few days later, the Starr Report
476.537	is released to Congress,
480.659	and all of those tapes and transcripts,
480.659	those stolen words, form a part of it.
486.79	That people can read the transcripts
486.79	is horrific enough,
490.961	but a few weeks later,
493.708	the audio tapes are aired on TV,
497.005	and significant portions
497.005	made available online.
502.661	The public humiliation was excruciating.
507.245	Life was almost unbearable.
512.938	This was not something that happened
512.938	with regularity back then in 1998,
518.054	and by this, I mean the stealing
518.054	of people's private words, actions,
523.836	conversations or photos,
526.459	and then making them public --
529.038	public without consent,
531.475	public without context,
533.937	and public without compassion.
538.091	Fast forward 12 years to 2010,
541.181	and now social media has been born.
545.158	The landscape has sadly become much
545.158	more populated with instances like mine,
550.19	whether or not someone
550.19	actually make a mistake,
553.208	and now it's for both public
553.208	and private people.
558.92	The consequences for some
558.92	have become dire, very dire.
565.799	I was on the phone with my mom
568.347	in September of 2010,
571.064	and we were talking about the news
572.921	of a young college freshman
572.921	from Rutgers University
575.713	named Tyler Clementi.
578.656	Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
581.804	was secretly webcammed by his roommate
584.183	while being intimate with another man.
588.826	When the online world
588.826	learned of this incident,
591.264	the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.
596.079	A few days later,
597.998	Tyler jumped from 
597.998	the George Washington Bridge
601.714	to his death.
603.247	He was 18.
607.644	My mom was beside herself about
607.644	what happened to Tyler and his family,
612.347	and she was gutted with pain
614.902	in a way that I just couldn't
614.902	quite understand,
618.57	and then eventually I realized
620.94	she was reliving 1998,
623.921	reliving a time when she sat
623.921	by my bed every night,
630.824	reliving a time when she made me shower
630.824	with the bathroom door open,
636.797	and reliving a time
636.797	when both of my parents feared
640.907	that I would be humiliated to death,
643.857	literally.
648.339	Today, too many parents
651.286	haven't had the chance to step in
651.286	and rescue their loved ones.
654.628	Too many have learned
654.628	of their child's suffering and humiliation
658.809	after it was too late.
661.944	Tyler's tragic, senseless death
661.944	was a turning point for me.
666.541	It served to recontextualize
666.541	my experiences,
670.582	and I then began to look at the world
670.582	of humiliation and bullying around me
674.877	and see something different.
678.36	In 1998, we had no way of knowing
678.36	where this brave new technology
683.584	called the Internet would take us.
686.254	Since then, it has connected people
686.254	in unimaginable ways,
690.462	joining lost siblings,
692.379	saving lives, launching revolutions,
696.45	but the darkness, cyberbullying,
696.45	and slut-shaming that I experienced
701.3	had mushroomed.
705.145	Every day online, people,
705.145	especially young people
709.845	who are not developmentally
709.845	equipped to handle this,
712.772	are so abused and humiliated
715.304	that they can't imagine living
715.304	to the next day,
717.996	and some, tragically, don't,
721.145	and there's nothing virtual about that.
725.551	ChildLine, a U.K. nonprofit that's focused
725.551	on helping young people on various issues,
731.628	released a staggering statistic
731.628	late last year:
735.309	From 2012 to 2013,
738.93	there was an 87 percent increase
742.204	in calls and emails related
742.204	to cyberbullying.
747.08	A meta-analysis done
747.08	out of the Netherlands
749.262	showed that for the first time,
751.257	cyberbullying was leading
751.257	to suicidal ideations
756.299	more significantly than offline bullying.
760.199	And you know what shocked me,
760.199	although it shouldn't have,
763.96	was other research last year
763.96	that determined humiliation
767.897	was a more intensely felt emotion
770.895	than either happiness or even anger.
776.305	Cruelty to others is nothing new,
779.49	but online, technologically
779.49	enhanced shaming is amplified,
785.87	uncontained, and permanently accessible.
791.187	The echo of embarrassment used to extend
791.187	only as far as your family, village,
796.877	school or community,
799.221	but now it's the online community too.
803.099	Millions of people, often anonymously,
805.941	can stab you with their words,
805.941	and that's a lot of pain,
809.934	and there are no perimeters
809.934	around how many people
813.07	can publicly observe you
815.158	and put you in a public stockade.
819.717	There is a very personal price
822.186	to public humiliation,
825.13	and the growth of the Internet
825.13	has jacked up that price.
831.841	For nearly two decades now,
834.268	we have slowly been sowing the seeds
834.268	of shame and public humiliation
838.386	in our cultural soil,
838.386	both on- and offline.
844.207	Gossip websites, paparazzi,
844.207	reality programming, politics,
849.105	news outlets and sometimes hackers
849.105	all traffic in shame.
854.941	It's led to desensitization
854.941	and a permissive environment online
859.159	which lends itself to trolling,
859.159	invasion of privacy, and cyberbullying.
865.521	This shift has created
865.521	what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls
869.306	a culture of humiliation.
873.09	Consider a few prominent examples
873.09	just from the past six months alone.
878.269	Snapchat, the service which is used
878.269	mainly by younger generations
883.353	and claims that its messages
883.353	only have the lifespan
886.048	of a few seconds.
887.751	You can imagine the range
887.751	of content that that gets.
891.161	A third-party app which Snapchatters
891.161	use to preserve the lifespan
895.294	of the messages was hacked,
897.988	and 100,000 personal conversations,
897.988	photos, and videos were leaked online
904.838	to now have a lifespan of forever.
909.095	Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
909.095	had their iCloud accounts hacked,
913.251	and private, intimate, nude photos
913.251	were plastered across the Internet
917.198	without their permission.
919.08	One gossip website
919.08	had over five million hits
923.212	for this one story.
927.027	And what about the Sony Pictures
927.027	cyberhacking?
930.526	The documents which received
930.526	the most attention
933.523	were private emails that had
933.523	maximum public embarrassment value.
939.559	But in this culture of humiliation,
942.809	there is another kind of price tag
942.809	attached to public shaming.
947.639	The price does not measure
947.639	the cost to the victim,
950.797	which Tyler and too many others,
953.05	notably women, minorities,
955.024	and members of the LGBTQ
955.024	community have paid,
959.202	but the price measures the profit
959.202	of those who prey on them.
964.868	This invasion of others is a raw material,
968.931	efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
968.931	packaged and sold at a profit.
974.921	A marketplace has emerged
974.921	where public humiliation is a commodity
980.703	and shame is an industry.
984.047	How is the money made?
987.739	Clicks.
989.573	The more shame, the more clicks.
992.104	The more clicks,
992.104	the more advertising dollars.
997.428	We're in a dangerous cycle.
999.633	The more we click on this kind of gossip,
1002.558	the more numb we get
1002.558	to the human lives behind it,
1006.279	and the more numb we get,
1006.279	the more we click.
1011.735	All the while, someone is making money
1014.658	off of the back 
1014.658	of someone else's suffering.
1018.871	With every click, we make a choice.
1021.674	The more we saturate our culture
1021.674	with public shaming,
1025.086	the more accepted it is,
1026.945	the more we will see behavior
1026.945	like cyberbullying,
1030.148	trolling, some forms of hacking,
1032.795	and online harassment.
1035.721	Why? Because they all have
1035.721	humiliation at their cores.
1043.429	This behavior is a symptom
1043.429	of the culture we've created.
1047.725	Just think about it.
1051.232	Changing behavior begins
1051.232	with evolving beliefs.
1054.644	We've seen that to be true
1054.644	with racism, homophobia,
1058.15	and plenty of other biases,
1058.15	today and in the past.
1062.91	As we've changed beliefs
1062.91	about same-sex marriage,
1066.068	more people have been
1066.068	offered equal freedoms.
1070.55	When we began valuing sustainability,
1072.733	more people began to recycle.
1075.681	So as far as our culture
1075.681	of humiliation goes,
1078.956	what we need is a cultural revolution.
1082.601	Public shaming
1082.601	as a blood sport has to stop,
1086.524	and it's time for an intervention
1086.524	on the Internet and in our culture.
1091.401	The shift begins with something simple,
1091.401	but it's not easy.
1096.137	We need to return to a long-held value
1096.137	of compassion -- compassion and empathy.
1102.772	Online, we've got a compassion deficit,
1105.959	an empathy crisis.
1109.091	Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,
1112.995	"""Shame can't survive empathy."""
1116.571	Shame cannot survive empathy.
1122.515	I've seen some very dark days in my life,
1126.136	and it was the compassion and empathy
1126.136	from my family, friends, professionals,
1132.197	and sometimes even strangers
1132.197	that saved me.
1137.583	Even empathy from one person
1137.583	can make a difference.
1142.318	The theory of minority influence,
1144.991	proposed by social psychologist
1144.991	Serge Moscovici,
1148.195	says that even in small numbers,
1150.981	when there's consistency over time,
1153.233	change can happen.
1155.834	In the online world,
1155.834	we can foster minority influence
1159.061	by becoming upstanders.
1161.488	To become an upstander means
1161.488	instead of bystander apathy,
1165.214	we can post a positive comment for someone
1165.214	or report a bullying situation.
1170.452	Trust me, compassionate comments
1170.452	help abate the negativity.
1175.385	We can also counteract the culture
1175.385	by supporting organizations
1179.193	that deal with these kinds of issues,
1181.469	like the Tyler Clementi
1181.469	Foundation in the U.S.,
1184.277	In the U.K., there's Anti-Bullying Pro,
1187.088	and in Australia, there's Project Rockit.
1192.35	We talk a lot about our right
1192.35	to freedom of expression,
1198.157	but we need to talk more about
1200.182	our responsibility
1200.182	to freedom of expression.
1203.736	We all want to be heard,
1206.475	but let's acknowledge the difference
1206.475	between speaking up with intention
1211.258	and speaking up for attention.
1215.684	The Internet is 
1215.684	the superhighway for the id,
1219.222	but online, showing empathy to others
1222.38	benefits us all and helps create
1222.38	a safer and better world.
1227.93	We need to communicate
1227.93	online with compassion,
1231.134	consume news with compassion,
1233.595	and click with compassion.
1236.289	Just imagine walking a mile
1236.289	in someone else's headline.
1243.476	I'd like to end on a personal note.
1247.561	In the past nine months,
1249.651	the question I've been 
1249.651	asked the most is why.
1253.175	Why now? Why was I 
1253.175	sticking my head above the parapet?
1257.193	You can read between the lines
1257.193	in those questions,
1259.71	and the answer has nothing
1259.71	to do with politics.
1263.559	The top note answer was and is
1263.559	because it's time:
1269.166	time to stop tip-toeing around my past;
1271.873	time to stop living a life of opprobrium;
1275.115	and time to take back my narrative.
1278.349	It's also not just about saving myself.
1283.194	Anyone who is suffering from shame
1283.194	and public humiliation
1286.607	needs to know one thing:
1289.394	You can survive it.
1292.111	I know it's hard.
1294.874	It may not be painless, quick or easy,
1298.505	but you can insist
1298.505	on a different ending to your story.
1303.181	Have compassion for yourself.
1306.548	We all deserve compassion,
1309.636	and to live both online and off
1309.636	in a more compassionate world.
1315.835	Thank you for listening.
1318.435	(Applause)
