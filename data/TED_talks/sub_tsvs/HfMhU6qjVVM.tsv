16.06	"""You have cancer."""
20.5	Sadly, about 40 percent of us will hear
20.5	those three words within our lifetime,
25.66	and half will not survive.
28.78	This means that two out of five
28.78	of your closest friends and relatives
32.66	will be diagnosed
32.66	with some form of cancer,
35.14	and one will die.
39.1	Beyond the physical hardships,
40.58	roughly one-third
40.58	of cancer survivors here in the US
43.78	will go into debt from treatment.
45.54	And they're at least two and a half times
45.54	more likely to declare bankruptcy
49.3	than those without cancer.
51.5	This disease is pervasive.
53.9	It's emotionally draining
55.5	and, for many,
56.74	financially destructive.
59.7	But a cancer diagnosis
59.7	doesn't have to be a death sentence.
63.74	Finding cancer early,
65.62	closer its genesis,
66.86	is one of the critical factors
66.86	to improving treatment options,
70.5	reducing its emotional impact
72.5	and minimizing financial burdens.
75.38	Most importantly,
76.62	finding cancer early --
77.9	which is one of the primary
77.9	aims of my research --
80.82	greatly enhances your odds of survival.
83.94	If we just look at the case
83.94	of breast cancer for example,
86.7	we find that those who are diagnosed
86.7	and treated at stage one
90.22	have a five-year survival rate
90.22	of nearly 100 percent --
94.58	odds that decrease to just 22 percent
94.58	if treated at stage four.
99.86	And similar trends are found
99.86	for colorectal and ovarian cancer.
105.82	Now, we're all aware
105.82	that an early diagnosis that is accurate
111.3	is critical for survival.
115.42	The problem is that many
115.42	cancer diagnostic tools are invasive,
119.26	costly,
120.5	often inaccurate
121.74	and they can take an agonizing
121.74	amount of time to get the results back.
126.34	Still worse, when it comes
126.34	to some forms of cancer,
128.78	such as ovarian,
128.78	liver or pancreatic cancer,
133.1	good screening methods simply don't exist,
136.7	meaning that often people wait
136.7	until physical symptoms surface,
140.78	which are themselves already
140.78	indicators of late-stage progression.
145.74	Like a tornado strike in an area
145.74	without an early warning system,
149.34	there is no alarm to warn,
151.26	for the danger is already at your doorstep
154.14	when your odds of survival
154.14	are greatly reduced.
159.22	Having the convenience and accessibility
159.22	of regular screening options
163.5	that are affordable, noninvasive
163.5	and could provide results much sooner,
168.86	would provide us with a formidable
168.86	weapon in the fight against cancer.
174.58	An early warning would allow us
174.58	to get out ahead of the disease
177.66	instead of merely
177.66	following in its relentless wake.
180.42	And this is exactly what I've been doing.
182.42	For the past three years,
182.42	I've been developing technologies
185.58	that could ultimately aid clinicians
187.34	with rapid, early-stage
187.34	cancer diagnostics.
190.74	And I've been fueled
190.74	by a deep scientific curiosity,
194.62	and a passion to change these statistics.
198.7	Last year however,
200.78	this fight became much more personal
203.86	when my wife was diagnosed
203.86	with breast cancer.
207.38	It was an experience that added a strong
207.38	and unexpected emotional dimension
211.82	to these efforts.
215.06	I know firsthand how life-altering
215.06	treatment can be,
219.34	and I'm keenly aware
219.34	of the emotional havoc
222.02	that cancer can wreak on a family,
224.5	which in our case
224.5	included our two young daughters.
228.22	Because we found it early
228.22	during a routine mammogram,
231.38	we were able to focus
231.38	primarily on treatment options
235.1	for the localized tumor,
236.66	reaffirming to me
236.66	how important an early diagnosis is.
242.78	Unlike other forms of cancer,
245.22	mammograms do offer an early-stage
245.22	screening option for breast cancer.
248.9	Still, not everyone has this done,
251.14	or they may develop breast cancer
252.75	before the middle age recommendation
252.75	for having a mammogram.
257.38	So, there's still
257.38	a lot of room for improvement,
259.66	even for cancers
259.66	that do have screening options,
261.94	and, of course, considerable benefits
261.94	for those that don't.
265.5	A key challenge then
265.5	for cancer researchers
268.26	is to develop methods
269.58	that make regular screening
269.58	for many types of cancers
273.14	much more accessible.
275.74	Imagine a scenario
275.74	where during your regular checkup,
278.82	your doctor can take
278.82	a simple, noninvasive urine sample,
282.62	or other liquid biopsy,
284.54	and present you with the results
284.54	before you even leave the doctor's office.
288.62	Such a technology could
288.62	dramatically reduce the number of people
292.18	who slip through the net
292.18	of an early-stage cancer diagnosis.
296.66	My research team
296.66	of engineers and biochemists
299.5	is working on exactly this challenge.
302.14	We're working on ways to frequently
302.14	activate an early-stage cancer alarm
307.3	by enabling regular screenings
307.3	that would start when a person is healthy
311.66	so that action could be taken
311.66	to stop cancer the moment it emerges,
315.98	and before it can progress
315.98	beyond its infancy.
320.46	The silver bullet in this case
320.46	are tiny vesicles,
323.5	little escape pods regularly shed
323.5	by cells called exosomes.
328.5	Exosomes are important biomarkers
331.26	that provide an early-warning system
331.26	for the development of cancer.
335.54	And because they're abundantly present
335.54	in just about every bodily fluid,
338.98	including blood, urine and saliva,
341.5	they're extremely attractive
341.5	for noninvasive liquid biopsies.
346.86	There's just one problem.
348.46	An automated system for rapidly sorting
348.46	these important biomarkers
352.78	is not currently available.
355.5	We've created a technology
355.5	that we call nano-DLD
358.82	that is capable of precisely this:
361.74	automated exosome isolation
364.46	to aid rapid cancer diagnostics.
367.86	Exosomes are the newest
367.86	early-warning weapon, if you will,
371.42	to emerge on the liquid biopsy front.
373.5	And they're really, really small.
375.82	They measure just 30 to 150
375.82	nanometers in diameter.
380.1	This is so tiny
381.42	that you could fit about a million
381.42	of them into a single red blood cell.
385.62	That's roughly the difference
385.62	between a golf ball
387.98	and a fine grain piece of sand.
390.74	Once thought to be little bins
390.74	for unwanted cellular waste,
394.46	it has been found
394.46	that cells actually communicate
397.46	by producing and absorbing these exosomes
400.62	which contain surface receptors,
403.02	proteins and other genetic material
403.02	collected from their cell of origin.
408.34	When absorbed by a neighboring cell,
411.02	exosomes release their contents
411.02	into the receiving cell,
414.86	and can set in motion
414.86	fundamental changes in gene expression --
418.1	some good,
419.34	and this is where cancer comes in,
421.1	some bad.
422.7	Because they are clothed
422.7	in the material of the mother cell,
426.5	and contain a sample of its environment,
428.46	they provide a genetic snapshot
428.46	of that cell's health and its origin.
435.02	All of these qualities
435.02	make exosomes invaluable messengers
438.18	that potentially allow physicians
439.82	to eavesdrop on your health
439.82	at the cellular level.
443.9	To catch cancer early, however,
445.58	you have to frequently
445.58	intercept these messages
448.54	to determine when cancer-causing
448.54	troublemakers within your body
452.06	decide to start staging a coup,
453.9	which is why regular
453.9	screening is so critical
456.94	and why we're developing
456.94	technologies to make this possible.
460.94	While the first exosome-based diagnostics
460.94	emerged on the market just this year,
466.62	they are not yet part
466.62	of mainstream healthcare options.
471.14	In addition to their recent emergence,
473.02	another factor that's limiting
473.02	their widespread adoption
476.5	is that currently, no automated
476.5	exosome isolation system exists
480.46	to make regular screening
480.46	economically accessible.
484.62	The current gold standard
484.62	for exosome isolation
487.38	includes ultracentrifugation,
489.34	a process requiring
489.34	expensive laboratory equipment,
492.62	a trained lab tech
493.9	and about 30 hours of time
493.9	to process a sample.
498.42	We've come up with a different approach
498.42	for achieving automated exosome isolation
503.1	from a sample such as urine.
505.38	We use a chip-based, continuous flow
505.38	separation technique
509.66	called deterministic lateral displacement.
512.66	And we have done with it
514.06	what the semiconductor industry has done
514.06	so successfully for the past 50 years.
518.54	We shrunk the dimensions
518.54	of this technology
520.62	from the micron scale
520.62	to the true nanoscale.
524.54	So how does it work?
526.02	In a nutshell,
527.3	a set of tiny pillars
527.3	separated by nanoscopic gaps
531.3	are arranged in such a way
532.58	that the system divides
532.58	the fluid into streamlines,
535.66	with the larger cancer-related
535.66	nanoparticles being separated
539.06	through a process of redirection
539.06	from the smaller, healthier ones,
542.98	which can in contrast
544.54	move around the pillars
544.54	in a zigzag-type motion
547.1	in the direction of fluid flow.
549.9	The net result is a complete separation
549.9	of these two particle populations.
555.26	You can visualize this separation process
558.98	similar to traffic on a highway
558.98	that separates into two roads,
562.86	with one road going into
562.86	a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain,
566.34	and the other road going around it.
568.42	Here, smaller cars
568.42	can go through the tunnel
571.22	while larger trucks,
571.22	carrying potentially hazardous material,
574.54	are forced to take the detour route.
577.42	Traffic is effectively separated
577.42	by size and contents
581.54	without impeding its flow.
583.58	And this is exactly how our system works
583.58	on a much, much smaller scale.
589.42	The idea here is that
589.42	the separation process for screening
593.3	could be as simple as processing
593.3	a sample of urine, blood or saliva,
597.38	which is a near-term possibility
597.38	within the next few years.
600.7	Ultimately, it could be used
600.7	to isolate and detect target exosomes
606.02	associated with
606.02	a particular type of cancer,
609.26	sensing and reporting
609.26	their presence within minutes.
612.42	This would make rapid diagnostics
612.42	virtually painless.
616.54	Broadly speaking,
617.82	the ability to separate
617.82	and enrich biomarkers
620.5	with nanoscale precision
620.5	in an automated way,
624.14	opens the door to better understanding
624.14	diseases such as cancer,
627.62	with applications ranging
627.62	from sample preparation to diagnostics,
631.62	and from drug resistance
631.62	monitoring to therapeutics.
635.26	Even before my wife's bout with cancer,
637.3	it was a dream of mine to facilitate
637.3	the automation of this process --
641.66	to make regular screening more accessible,
644.62	similar to the way Henry Ford
644.62	made the automobile accessible
647.54	to the general population
649.14	through development of the assembly line.
651.42	Automation is the key to accessibility.
656.1	And in the spirit of the Hoover dream,
657.98	"""a chicken in every pot"
657.98	"and a car in every garage,"""
660.9	we're developing a technology
662.34	that could ultimately place
662.34	an early-warning cancer detection system
666.18	in every home.
667.82	This would allow
667.82	every man, woman and child
669.9	the opportunity to be regularly tested
669.9	while they're still healthy,
674.06	catching cancer when it first emerges.
677.22	It is my hope and dream
678.74	to help people around the world
678.74	avoid the high costs --
682.46	physical, financial and emotional --
685.02	faced by today's cancer patients,
687.42	hardships that I'm well acquainted with.
691.22	I'm also happy to report that because
691.22	we caught my wife's cancer early,
695.62	her treatment was successful,
697.3	and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.
699.58	(Applause)
707.98	It is an outcome that I would like to see
707.98	for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.
713.1	With the work that my team
713.1	has already done
715.18	on separation of nanoscale biomarkers
717.94	for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics,
720.9	I am optimistic
720.9	that within the next decade,
723.46	this type of technology will be available,
726.06	helping protect our friends,
726.06	our family and future generations.
730.5	Even if we are so unlucky
730.5	as to be diagnosed with cancer,
734.42	that early-stage alarm
734.42	will provide a strong beacon of hope.
738.1	Thank you.
739.34	(Applause)
