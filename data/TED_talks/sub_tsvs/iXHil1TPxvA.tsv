13.354	Virtual reality started for me
13.354	in sort of an unusual place.
18.976	It was the 1970s.
21.173	I got into the field very young:
21.173	I was seven years old.
24.383	And the tool that I used 
24.383	to access virtual reality
29.245	was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.
32.81	This is a commercial for 
32.81	that particular item:
35.201	(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!
36.776	Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.
38.767	That gyro-power sends him 
38.767	over 100 feet at top speed.
41.536	Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.
43.628	I rode this motorcycle everywhere.
46.587	And I was there with Evel Knievel; we 
46.587	jumped the Snake River Canyon together.
50.847	I wanted the rocket.
52.216	I never got the rocket,
52.216	I only got the motorcycle.
57.626	I felt so connected to this world.
60.203	I didn't want to be a storyteller 
60.203	when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.
64.44	I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.
67.644	I had so much empathy for him.
70.747	But it didn't work out. (Laughter)
73.358	I went to art school.
75.382	I started making music videos.
77.792	And this is one of the early
77.792	music videos that I made:
80.866	"(Music: ""Touch the Sky"" by Kanye West)"
86.756	CM: You may notice 
86.756	some slight similarities here.
90.032	(Laughter)
91.818	And I got that rocket.
94.461	(Laughter)
97.104	So, now I'm a filmmaker,
97.104	or, the beginning of a filmmaker,
101.509	and I started using the tools that are
101.509	available to me as a filmmaker
105.243	to try to tell the most compelling stories
105.243	that I can to an audience.
109.831	And film is this incredible medium
109.831	that allows us to feel empathy
112.98	for people that are very different than us
115.006	and worlds completely 
115.006	foreign from our own.
117.838	Unfortunately,
118.668	Evel Knievel did not feel the same 
118.668	empathy for us that we felt for him,
123.527	and he sued us for this video --
126.33	(Laughter) --
128.061	shortly thereafter.
130.11	On the upside, the man 
130.11	that I worshipped as a child,
134.95	the man that I wanted 
134.95	to become as an adult,
138.066	I was finally able to get his autograph.
142.556	(Applause)
149.832	Let's talk about film now.
154.849	Film, it's an incredible medium,
157.745	but essentially, it's the same
157.745	now as it was then.
161.06	It's a group of rectangles that are
161.06	played in a sequence.
164.529	And we've done incredible things
164.529	with those rectangles.
168.362	But I started thinking about,
171.247	is there a way that I can use modern
171.247	and developing technologies
175.616	to tell stories in different ways
177.741	and tell different kinds of stories
179.482	that maybe I couldn't tell using
179.482	the traditional tools of filmmaking
183.793	that we've been using for 100 years?
185.964	So I started experimenting,
188.785	and what I was trying to do was
188.785	to build the ultimate empathy machine.
195.054	And here's one of the early experiments:
197.588	(Music)
200.412	So this is called
200.412	"""The Wilderness Downtown."""
202.656	It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.
204.712	It asked you to put in the address
204.712	where you grew up at the beginning of it.
208.362	It's a website.
209.359	And out of it starts growing these little
209.359	boxes with different browser windows.
214.275	And you see this teenager 
214.275	running down a street,
216.657	and then you see Google Street View
216.657	and Google Maps imagery
219.415	and you realize the street
219.415	he's running down is yours.
221.939	And when he stops in front of a house,
221.939	he stops in front of your house.
227.735	And this was great, and I saw people 
227.735	having an even deeper emotional reaction
231.417	to this than the things that 
231.417	I had made in rectangles.
234.631	And I'm essentially taking 
234.631	a piece of your history
238.562	and putting it inside 
238.562	the framing of the story.
241.981	But then I started thinking,
243.578	okay, well that's a part of you,
245.43	but how do I put all of you
245.43	inside of the frame?
250.731	So to do that, I started
250.731	making art installations.
253.834	And this is one called 
253.834	"""The Treachery of Sanctuary."""
256.374	It's a triptych. I'm going to show
256.374	you the third panel.
259.392	(Music)
283.26	So now I've got you inside of the frame,
286.848	and I saw people having even more
286.848	visceral emotional reactions
291.403	to this work than the previous one.
294.08	But then I started thinking about frames,
294.08	and what do they represent?
298.23	And a frame is just a window.
300.487	I mean, all the media that we watch --
300.487	television, cinema --
303.566	they're these windows into 
303.566	these other worlds.
305.819	And I thought, well, great. 
305.819	I got you in a frame.
308.507	But I don't want you in the frame,
308.507	I don't want you in the window,
311.634	I want you through the window,
311.634	I want you on the other side,
314.523	in the world, inhabiting the world.
318.218	So that leads me back to virtual reality.
321.123	Let's talk about virtual reality.
324.634	Unfortunately,
325.934	talking about virtual reality
325.934	is like dancing about architecture.
330.423	And this is actually someone dancing
330.423	about architecture in virtual reality.
337.34	(Laughter)
339.823	So, it's difficult to explain.
339.823	Why is it difficult to explain?
343.084	It's difficult because it's a very 
343.084	experiential medium.
346.782	You feel your way inside of it.
348.698	It's a machine, but inside of it,
350.496	it feels like real life,
350.496	it feels like truth.
353.945	And you feel present in the world
353.945	that you're inside
356.466	and you feel present with the people
356.466	that you're inside of it with.
359.689	So, I'm going to show you a demo
359.689	of a virtual reality film:
363.785	a full-screen version of
363.785	all the information
366.006	that we capture when
366.006	we shoot virtual reality.
368.209	So we're shooting in every direction.
370.034	This is a camera system that we built
372.21	that has 3D cameras that look
372.21	in every direction
375.235	and binaural microphones
375.235	that face in every direction.
377.987	We take this and we build, basically,
377.987	a sphere of a world that you inhabit.
383.333	So what I'm going to show you
383.333	is not a view into the world,
386.736	it's basically the whole world
386.736	stretched into a rectangle.
390.107	So this film is called 
390.107	"""Clouds Over Sidra,"""
393.495	and it was made in conjunction with 
393.495	our virtual reality company called VRSE
397.989	and the United Nations,
399.755	and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.
402.788	And we went to a Syrian refugee camp
402.788	in Jordan in December
406.625	and shot the story of a 12-year-old
406.625	girl there named Sidra.
410.982	And she and her family fled Syria
410.982	through the desert into Jordan
414.473	and she's been living in this
414.473	camp for the last year and a half.
420.207	(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.
422.72	I am 12 years old.
424.616	I am in the fifth grade.
426.418	I am from Syria,
426.418	in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.
431.605	I have lived here in the Zaatari camp
431.605	in Jordan for the last year and a half.
438.923	I have a big family:
440.931	three brothers, one is a baby.
443.697	He cries a lot.
447.142	I asked my father if I cried when 
447.142	I was a baby and he says I did not.
452.197	I think I was a stronger baby
452.197	than my brother.
455.821	CM: So, when you're inside 
455.821	of the headset.
458.731	you're not seeing it like this.
460.351	You're looking around through this world.
462.423	You'll notice you see full
467.711	And when you're sitting there
467.711	in her room, watching her,
470.702	you're not watching it through
470.702	a television screen,
473.115	you're not watching it through a window,
473.115	you're sitting there with her.
476.523	When you look down, you're sitting
476.523	on the same ground that she's sitting on.
480.915	And because of that,
482.666	you feel her humanity in a deeper way.
487.054	You empathize with her in a deeper way.
491.59	And I think that we can change
491.59	minds with this machine.
497.917	And we've already started
497.917	to try to change a few.
501.69	So we took this film to the World Economic
501.69	Forum in Davos in January.
506.536	And we showed it to a group of people
509.022	whose decisions affect the lives
509.022	of millions of people.
513.102	And these are people 
513.102	who might not otherwise
515.22	be sitting in a tent 
515.22	in a refugee camp in Jordan.
521.484	But in January, one afternoon
521.484	in Switzerland,
527.813	they suddenly all found themselves there.
532.309	(Applause)
538.699	And they were affected by it.
541.058	So we're going to make more of them.
544.374	We're working with the 
544.374	United Nations right now
547.46	to shoot a whole series of these films.
549.515	We just finished shooting
549.515	a story in Liberia.
552.187	And now, we're going 
552.187	to shoot a story in India.
555.633	And we're taking these films,
557.511	and we're showing them 
557.511	at the United Nations
560.036	to people that work there and people
560.036	that are visiting there.
563.023	And we're showing 
563.023	them to the people
564.81	that can actually change the lives
564.81	of the people inside of the films.
569.274	And that's where I think we just
569.274	start to scratch the surface
572.955	of the true power of virtual reality.
576.614	It's not a video game peripheral.
578.835	It connects humans to other humans
578.835	in a profound way
583.408	that I've never seen before 
583.408	in any other form of media.
586.873	And it can change people's
586.873	perception of each other.
590.612	And that's how I think
592.298	virtual reality has the potential
592.298	to actually change the world.
598.604	So, it's a machine,
601.151	but through this machine
601.151	we become more compassionate,
606.074	we become more empathetic,
606.074	and we become more connected.
611.667	And ultimately, we become more human.
616.491	Thank you.
617.651	(Applause)
