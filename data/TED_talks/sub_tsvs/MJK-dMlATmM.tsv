12.741	Sleep.
14.383	It's something we spend about
14.383	a third of our lives doing,
17.204	but do any of us really understand what it's all about?
20.525	Two thousand years ago, Galen,
22.74	one of the most prominent medical researchers
24.88	of the ancient world,
25.939	proposed that while we're awake,
28.258	our brain's motive force, its juice,
31.62	would flow out to all the other parts of the body,
34.19	animating them but leaving the brain all dried up,
38.204	and he thought that when we sleep,
39.82	all this moisture that filled the rest of the body
42.358	would come rushing back,
44.102	rehydrating the brain
45.913	and refreshing the mind.
48.459	Now, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,
50.88	but Galen was simply trying to explain
52.921	something about sleep
54.528	that we all deal with every day.
57.185	See, we all know based on our own experience
59.109	that when you sleep, it clears your mind,
61.821	and when you don't sleep,
63.283	it leaves your mind murky.
66.21	But while we know a great deal more about sleep now
68.722	than when Galen was around,
70.526	we still haven't understood why it is that sleep,
73.406	of all of our activities, has this incredible
76.035	restorative function for the mind.
78.754	So today I want to tell you about
80.254	some recent research
81.61	that may shed new light on this question.
84.368	We've found that sleep may actually be
87.573	a kind of elegant design solution
89.946	to some of the brain's most basic needs,
92.523	a unique way that the brain
94.469	meets the high demands and the narrow margins
97.292	that set it apart from all the other organs of the body.
102.291	So almost all the biology that we observe
105.346	can be thought of as a series of problems
107.8	and their corresponding solutions,
109.841	and the first problem that every organ must solve
113.321	is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel
115.819	all those cells of the body.
117.56	In the brain, that is especially critical;
120.138	its intense electrical activity uses up
122.355	a quarter of the body's entire energy supply,
125.213	even though the brain accounts
126.843	for only about two percent of the body's mass.
130.18	So the circulatory system
131.792	solves the nutrient delivery problem
134.223	by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients
136.763	and oxygen to every corner of our body.
140.106	You can actually see it in this video here.
143.12	Here, we're imaging blood vessels
144.702	in the brain of a living mouse.
147.597	The blood vessels form a complex network
150.117	that fills the entire brain volume.
152.465	They start at the surface of the brain,
154.266	and then they dive down into the tissue itself,
157.147	and as they spread out, they supply nutrients
159.508	and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.
165.276	Now, just as every cell requires
168.246	nutrients to fuel it,
170.137	every cell also produces waste as a byproduct,
173.277	and the clearance of that waste
174.823	is the second basic problem
177.09	that each organ has to solve.
179.882	This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,
182.465	which has evolved to meet this need.
184.895	It's a second parallel network of vessels
187.707	that extends throughout the body.
189.721	It takes up proteins and other waste
191.678	from the spaces between the cells,
193.602	it collects them, and then dumps them into the blood
196.414	so they can be disposed of.
198.675	But if you look really closely at this diagram,
200.464	you'll see something
201.858	that doesn't make a lot of sense.
204.186	So if we were to zoom into this guy's head,
206.943	one of the things that you would see there
209.136	is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.
213.298	But that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?
216.392	I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ
219.597	that produces a correspondingly
219.597	large amount of waste
222.162	that must be efficiently cleared.
224.739	And yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that
227.701	the approach that the rest of the body takes
229.497	to clearing away its waste
231.482	won't work in the brain.
234.491	So how, then, does the brain solve
236.539	its waste clearance problem?
238.293	Well, that seemingly mundane question
241.982	is where our group first jumped into this story,
245.39	and what we found
247.411	as we dove down into the brain,
249.746	down among the neurons and the blood vessels,
252.637	was that the brain's solution
254.82	to the problem of waste clearance,
257.383	it was really unexpected.
259.2	It was ingenious,
262.05	but it was also beautiful.
265.168	Let me tell you about what we found.
266.835	So the brain has this large pool
269.389	of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.
272.85	We call it the CSF.
274.169	The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,
278.149	and wastes from inside the brain
279.672	make their way out to the CSF,
281.894	which gets dumped, along with 
281.894	the waste, into the blood.
285.157	So in that way, it sounds a lot like
286.277	the lymphatic system, doesn't it?
288.869	But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste
291.625	from inside the brain,
293.357	they don't just percolate their way randomly
295.764	out to these pools of CSF.
298.138	Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing
301.861	that organizes and facilitates this process.
305.753	You can see that in these videos.
307.902	Here, we're again imaging into the brain
310.94	of living mice.
312.424	The frame on your left shows
314.347	what's happening at the brain's surface,
316.406	and the frame on your right shows
317.97	what's happening down below the surface of the brain
319.916	within the tissue itself.
321.639	We've labeled the blood vessels in red,
323.898	and the CSF that's surrounding the brain
325.922	will be in green.
327.745	Now, what was surprising to us
329.545	was that the fluid on the outside of the brain,
332.796	it didn't stay on the outside.
335.608	Instead, the CSF was pumped back into
339.011	and through the brain
340.884	along the outsides of the blood vessels,
343.916	and as it flushed down into the brain
346.3	along the outsides of these vessels,
348.1	it was actually helping to clear away,
350.912	to clean the waste from the spaces
353.353	between the brain's cells.
356.199	If you think about it,
358.111	using the outsides of these blood vessels like this
361.588	is a really clever design solution,
364.107	because the brain is enclosed
366.829	in a rigid skull
368.652	and it's packed full of cells,
370.755	so there is no extra space inside it
373.5	for a whole second set of vessels
373.5	like the lymphatic system.
377.1	Yet the blood vessels,
378.359	they extend from the surface of the brain
380.317	down to reach every single cell in the brain,
382.926	which means that fluid
384.164	that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels
387.46	can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,
391.26	so it's actually this really clever way
393.444	to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,
397.209	to take over and replace the function
399.998	of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,
403.181	to make it so you don't need them.
405.592	And what's amazing is that no other organ
407.909	takes quite this approach
409.55	to clearing away the waste from between its cells.
412.61	This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.
418.43	But our most surprising finding
420.698	was that all of this,
422.801	everything I just told you about,
425.151	with all this fluid rushing through the brain,
428.469	it's only happening in the sleeping brain.
432.653	Here, the video on the left
434.103	shows how much of the CSF is moving
436.364	through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.
439.97	It's almost nothing.
441.843	Yet in the same animal,
443.418	if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,
446.623	what we see is that the CSF
449.38	is rushing through the brain,
451.798	and we discovered that at the same time
453.958	when the brain goes to sleep,
456.57	the brain cells themselves seem to shrink,
459.233	opening up spaces in between them,
461.27	allowing fluid to rush through
463.407	and allowing waste to be cleared out.
466.14	So it seems that Galen may actually have been
468.654	sort of on the right track when he wrote about
470.91	fluid rushing through the brain
473.61	when sleep came on.
475.252	Our own research, now it's 2,000 years later,
478.705	suggests that what's happening is that
480.775	when the brain is awake
482.834	and is at its most busy,
484.948	it puts off clearing away the waste
487.31	from the spaces between its cells until later,
490.381	and then, when it goes to sleep
492.24	and doesn't have to be as busy,
494.588	it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode
497.165	to clear away the waste
498.852	from the spaces between its cells,
500.36	the waste that's accumulated throughout the day.
502.777	So it's actually a little bit like how you or I,
505.185	we put off our household chores during the work week
508.267	when we don't have time to get to it,
509.729	and then we play catch up on all
509.729	the cleaning that we have to do
512.99	when the weekend rolls around.
515.748	Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,
519.02	but I haven't been very specific
520.472	about the kinds of waste
521.866	that the brain needs to be clearing
524.161	during sleep in order to stay healthy.
526.704	The waste product that these recent studies
528.301	focused most on is amyloid-beta,
530.719	which is a protein that's made
530.719	in the brain all the time.
533.914	My brain's making amyloid-beta right now,
535.772	and so is yours.
537.93	But in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
539.932	amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates
542.531	in the spaces between the brain's cells,
544.544	instead of being cleared away 
544.544	like it's supposed to be,
547.97	and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta
549.98	that's thought to be one of the key steps
552.193	in the development of that terrible disease.
554.814	So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared
557.908	from the brain when it's awake
559.64	versus when it's asleep,
561.418	and we found that indeed,
563.296	the clearance of amyloid-beta
565.186	is much more rapid from the sleeping brain.
569.705	So if sleep, then,
571.384	is part of the brain's solution
573.342	to the problem of waste clearance,
575.352	then this may dramatically change how we think
577.728	about the relationship between sleep,
579.963	amyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.
583.319	A series of recent clinical studies
585.277	suggest that among patients
587.11	who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,
590.204	worsening sleep quality and sleep duration
593.27	are associated with a greater amount
595.288	of amyloid-beta building up in the brain,
598.1	and while it's important to point out
599.967	that these studies don't prove
601.677	that lack of sleep or poor sleep
603.866	cause Alzheimer's disease,
606.273	they do suggest that the failure of the brain
608.883	to keep its house clean
610.795	by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta
613.551	may contribute to the development
615.453	of conditions like Alzheimer's.
619.07	So what this new research tells us, then,
620.975	is that the one thing that all of you
623.302	already knew about sleep,
624.71	that even Galen understood about sleep,
627.363	that it refreshes and clears the mind,
630.434	may actually be a big part
631.975	of what sleep is all about.
634.292	See, you and I, we go to sleep
635.81	every single night,
637.543	but our brains, they never rest.
640.546	While our body is still
642.38	and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,
645.451	the elegant machinery of the brain
647.127	is quietly hard at work
649.107	cleaning and maintaining
651.3	this unimaginably complex machine.
654.135	Like our housework,
655.176	it's a dirty and a thankless job,
657.925	but it's also important.
660.18	In your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen
662.583	for a month,
664.491	your home will become completely unlivable
666.93	very quickly.
668.537	But in the brain, the consequences
670.625	of falling behind may be much greater
673.556	than the embarrassment of dirty countertops,
676.284	because when it comes to cleaning the brain,
678.848	it is the very health and function
681.224	of the mind and the body that's at stake,
684.169	which is why understanding these
686.41	very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today
690.682	may be critical for preventing and treating
693.675	diseases of the mind tomorrow.
696.703	Thank you.
