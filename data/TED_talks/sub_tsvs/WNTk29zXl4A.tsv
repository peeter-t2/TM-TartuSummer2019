15.26	It's Monday morning.
18.26	In Washington,
20.26	the president of the United States
22.26	is sitting in the Oval Office,
24.26	assessing whether or not
26.26	to strike Al Qaeda
28.26	in Yemen.
30.26	At Number 10 Downing Street,
32.26	David Cameron is trying to work out
35.26	whether to cut more public sector jobs
38.26	in order to stave off a double-dip recession.
41.26	In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez
44.26	is standing at the door,
46.26	listening to her baby crying and crying,
49.26	trying to work out whether she should let it cry
52.26	until it falls asleep
54.26	or pick it up and hold it.
57.26	And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,
61.26	trying to work out
63.26	whether I should let him drink
65.26	the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water
68.26	that his doctors just came in and said,
71.26	"""You must make him drink today,"" --"
73.26	my father's been nil by mouth for a week --
76.26	or whether, by giving him this bottle,
80.26	I might actually kill him.
83.26	We face momentous decisions
86.26	with important consequences
88.26	throughout our lives,
90.26	and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.
93.26	We talk things over with our friends,
96.26	we scour the Internet,
99.26	we search through books.
102.26	But still,
104.26	even in this age
106.26	of Google and TripAdvisor
108.26	and Amazon Recommends,
111.26	it's still experts
113.26	that we rely upon most --
116.26	especially when the stakes are high
118.26	and the decision really matters.
121.26	Because in a world of data deluge
123.26	and extreme complexity,
126.26	we believe that experts
128.26	are more able to process information than we can --
131.26	that they are able to come to better conclusions
134.26	than we could come to on our own.
137.26	And in an age
139.26	that is sometimes nowadays frightening
142.26	or confusing,
144.26	we feel reassured
146.26	by the almost parental-like authority
149.26	of experts
151.26	who tell us so clearly what it is
154.26	we can and cannot do.
158.26	But I believe
160.26	that this is a big problem,
162.26	a problem with potentially dangerous consequences
166.26	for us as a society,
169.26	as a culture
171.26	and as individuals.
173.26	It's not that experts
175.26	have not massively contributed to the world --
177.26	of course they have.
179.26	The problem lies with us:
182.26	we've become addicted to experts.
185.26	We've become addicted to their certainty,
188.26	their assuredness,
190.26	their definitiveness,
192.26	and in the process,
194.26	we have ceded our responsibility,
196.26	substituting our intellect
198.26	and our intelligence
201.26	for their supposed words of wisdom.
204.26	We've surrendered our power,
207.26	trading off our discomfort
209.26	with uncertainty
211.26	for the illusion of certainty
213.26	that they provide.
216.26	This is no exaggeration.
219.26	In a recent experiment,
221.26	a group of adults
223.26	had their brains scanned in an MRI machine
226.26	as they were listening to experts speak.
230.26	The results were quite extraordinary.
233.26	As they listened to the experts' voices,
236.26	the independent decision-making parts of their brains
241.26	switched off.
243.26	It literally flat-lined.
246.26	And they listened to whatever the experts said
248.26	and took their advice, however right or wrong.
252.26	But experts do get things wrong.
256.26	Did you know that studies show
259.26	that doctors misdiagnose
262.26	four times out of 10?
265.26	Did you know
267.26	that if you file your tax returns yourself,
270.26	you're statistically more likely
272.26	to be filing them correctly
274.26	than if you get a tax adviser
276.26	to do it for you?
278.26	And then there's, of course, the example
280.26	that we're all too aware of:
282.26	financial experts
284.26	getting it so wrong
286.26	that we're living through the worst recession
288.26	since the 1930s.
292.26	For the sake of our health,
294.26	our wealth
296.26	and our collective security,
298.26	it's imperative that we keep
301.26	the independent decision-making parts of our brains
305.26	switched on.
307.26	And I'm saying this as an economist
309.26	who, over the past few years,
311.26	has focused my research
313.26	on what it is we think
315.26	and who it is we trust and why,
318.26	but also --
320.26	and I'm aware of the irony here --
322.26	as an expert myself,
325.26	as a professor,
327.26	as somebody who advises prime ministers,
330.26	heads of big companies,
332.26	international organizations,
334.26	but an expert who believes
336.26	that the role of experts needs to change,
339.26	that we need to become more open-minded,
342.26	more democratic
344.26	and be more open
346.26	to people rebelling against
348.26	our points of view.
351.26	So in order to help you understand
354.26	where I'm coming from,
356.26	let me bring you into my world,
359.26	the world of experts.
361.26	Now there are, of course, exceptions,
365.26	wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.
371.26	But what my research has shown me
374.26	is that experts tend on the whole
377.26	to form very rigid camps,
380.26	that within these camps,
382.26	a dominant perspective emerges
385.26	that often silences opposition,
388.26	that experts move with the prevailing winds,
391.26	often hero-worshipping
394.26	their own gurus.
396.26	Alan Greenspan's proclamations
398.26	that the years of economic growth
401.26	would go on and on,
404.26	not challenged by his peers,
407.26	until after the crisis, of course.
411.26	You see,
414.26	we also learn
416.26	that experts are located,
418.26	are governed,
420.26	by the social and cultural norms
423.26	of their times --
425.26	whether it be the doctors
427.26	in Victorian England, say,
429.26	who sent women to asylums
432.26	for expressing sexual desire,
435.26	or the psychiatrists in the United States
438.26	who, up until 1973,
441.26	were still categorizing homosexuality
445.26	as a mental illness.
447.26	And what all this means
449.26	is that paradigms
451.26	take far too long to shift,
454.26	that complexity and nuance are ignored
458.26	and also that money talks --
461.26	because we've all seen the evidence
464.26	of pharmaceutical companies
466.26	funding studies of drugs
469.26	that conveniently leave out
471.26	their worst side effects,
474.26	or studies funded by food companies
477.26	of their new products,
480.26	massively exaggerating the health benefits
483.26	of the products they're about to bring by market.
486.26	The study showed that food companies exaggerated
488.26	typically seven times more
491.26	than an independent study.
495.26	And we've also got to be aware
497.26	that experts, of course,
499.26	also make mistakes.
501.26	They make mistakes every single day --
504.26	mistakes born out of carelessness.
507.26	A recent study in the Archives of Surgery
510.26	reported surgeons
512.26	removing healthy ovaries,
515.26	operating on the wrong side of the brain,
518.26	carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,
521.26	elbow, eye, foot,
524.26	and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.
527.26	A common thinking error
529.26	of radiologists, for example --
532.26	when they look at CT scans --
535.26	is that they're overly influenced
537.26	by whatever it is
539.26	that the referring physician has said
541.26	that he suspects
543.26	the patient's problem to be.
546.26	So if a radiologist
548.26	is looking at the scan
550.26	of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,
553.26	what happens is that,
555.26	if they see evidence
557.26	of pneumonia on the scan,
560.26	they literally stop looking at it --
563.26	thereby missing the tumor
565.26	sitting three inches below
567.26	on the patient's lungs.
571.26	I've shared with you so far
574.26	some insights into the world of experts.
577.26	These are, of course,
579.26	not the only insights I could share,
581.26	but I hope they give you a clear sense at least
584.26	of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,
587.26	why we need to rebel
589.26	and why we need to switch
591.26	our independent decision-making capabilities on.
595.26	But how can we do this?
598.26	Well for the sake of time,
601.26	I want to focus on just three strategies.
606.26	First, we've got to be ready and willing
608.26	to take experts on
611.26	and dispense with this notion of them
614.26	as modern-day apostles.
616.26	This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.
619.26	in every single subject,
621.26	you'll be relieved to hear.
623.26	But it does mean persisting
626.26	in the face of their inevitable annoyance
629.26	when, for example,
631.26	we want them to explain things to us
633.26	in language that we can actually understand.
638.26	Why was it that, when I had an operation,
641.26	my doctor said to me,
643.26	"""Beware, Ms. Hertz,"
645.26	"of hyperpyrexia,"""
647.26	when he could have just as easily said,
649.26	"""Watch out for a high fever."""
653.26	You see, being ready to take experts on
657.26	is about also being willing
659.26	to dig behind their graphs,
662.26	their equations, their forecasts,
664.26	their prophecies,
666.26	and being armed with the questions to do that --
669.26	questions like:
671.26	What are the assumptions that underpin this?
674.26	What is the evidence upon which this is based?
677.26	What has your investigation focused on?
681.26	And what has it ignored?
684.26	It recently came out
686.26	that experts trialing drugs
689.26	before they come to market
691.26	typically trial drugs
694.26	first, primarily on male animals
698.26	and then, primarily on men.
701.26	It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact
704.26	that over half the world's population are women.
709.26	And women have drawn the short medical straw
712.26	because it now turns out that many of these drugs
715.26	don't work nearly as well on women
718.26	as they do on men --
720.26	and the drugs that do work well work so well
723.26	that they're actively harmful for women to take.
726.26	Being a rebel is about recognizing
729.26	that experts' assumptions
732.26	and their methodologies
734.26	can easily be flawed.
737.26	Second,
739.26	we need to create the space
742.26	"for what I call ""managed dissent."""
745.26	If we are to shift paradigms,
747.26	if we are to make breakthroughs,
749.26	if we are to destroy myths,
752.26	we need to create an environment
754.26	in which expert ideas are battling it out,
757.26	in which we're bringing in
759.26	new, diverse, discordant, heretical views
762.26	into the discussion,
764.26	fearlessly,
766.26	in the knowledge that progress comes about,
769.26	not only from the creation of ideas,
773.26	but also from their destruction --
776.26	and also from the knowledge
779.26	that, by surrounding ourselves
781.26	by divergent, discordant,
784.26	heretical views.
786.26	All the research now shows us
788.26	that this actually makes us smarter.
793.26	Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion
796.26	because it goes against our very instincts,
799.26	which are to surround ourselves
802.26	with opinions and advice
804.26	that we already believe
807.26	or want to be true.
809.26	And that's why I talk about the need
811.26	to actively manage dissent.
815.26	Google CEO Eric Schmidt
817.26	is a practical practitioner
820.26	of this philosophy.
822.26	In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --
825.26	arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --
828.26	and draws them into the discussion,
831.26	trying to see if they indeed are
834.26	the person with a different opinion,
837.26	so that they have dissent within the room.
840.26	Managing dissent
842.26	is about recognizing the value
845.26	of disagreement, discord
848.26	and difference.
850.26	But we need to go even further.
853.26	We need to fundamentally redefine
856.26	who it is that experts are.
860.26	The conventional notion
862.26	is that experts are people
865.26	with advanced degrees,
867.26	fancy titles, diplomas,
870.26	best-selling books --
872.26	high-status individuals.
874.26	But just imagine
876.26	if we were to junk
878.26	this notion of expertise
882.26	as some sort of elite cadre
886.26	and instead embrace the notion
889.26	of democratized expertise --
892.26	whereby expertise was not just the preserve
895.26	of surgeons and CEO's,
897.26	but also shop-girls -- yeah.
901.26	Best Buy,
903.26	the consumer electronics company,
905.26	gets all its employees --
908.26	the cleaners, the shop assistants,
910.26	the people in the back office,
913.26	not just its forecasting team --
915.26	to place bets, yes bets,
918.26	on things like whether or not
920.26	a product is going to sell well before Christmas,
923.26	on whether customers' new ideas
926.26	are going to be or should be taken on by the company,
930.26	on whether a project
932.26	will come in on time.
934.26	By leveraging
936.26	and by embracing
938.26	the expertise within the company,
940.26	Best Buy was able to discover, for example,
943.26	that the store that it was going to open in China --
947.26	its big, grand store --
949.26	was not going to open on time.
952.26	Because when it asked its staff,
954.26	all its staff, to place their bets
957.26	on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,
961.26	a group from the finance department
964.26	placed all their chips
966.26	on that not happening.
969.26	It turned out that they were aware,
971.26	as no one else within the company was,
974.26	of a technological blip
976.26	that neither the forecasting experts,
978.26	nor the experts on the ground in China,
981.26	were even aware of.
985.26	The strategies
987.26	that I have discussed this evening --
990.26	embracing dissent,
992.26	taking experts on,
994.26	democratizing expertise,
996.26	rebellious strategies --
999.26	are strategies that I think
1001.26	would serve us all well to embrace
1003.26	as we try to deal with the challenges
1006.26	of these very confusing, complex,
1009.26	difficult times.
1011.26	For if we keep
1013.26	our independent decision-making part
1015.26	of our brains switched on,
1018.26	if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,
1021.26	if we devolve authority,
1023.26	if we are rebellious,
1025.26	but also
1027.26	if we become much more comfortable
1029.26	with nuance,
1031.26	uncertainty and doubt,
1034.26	and if we allow our experts
1037.26	to express themselves
1039.26	using those terms too,
1041.26	we will set ourselves up
1043.26	much better
1045.26	for the challenges of the 21st century.
1049.26	For now, more than ever,
1052.26	is not the time
1054.26	to be blindly following,
1056.26	blindly accepting,
1058.26	blindly trusting.
1061.26	Now is the time to face the world
1064.26	with eyes wide open --
1067.26	yes, using experts
1069.26	to help us figure things out, for sure --
1072.26	I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --
1076.26	but being aware
1078.26	of their limitations
1081.26	and, of course, also our own.
1085.26	Thank you.
1087.26	(Applause)
