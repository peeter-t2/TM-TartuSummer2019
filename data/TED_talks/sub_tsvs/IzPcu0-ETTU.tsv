16.779	What I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,
19.554	and this is from a book I'm preparing called
23.37	"""Letters to a Young Scientist."""
25.795	I'd thought it'd be appropriate to
27.946	present it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience
33.035	in teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.
36.731	And you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing
42.13	that teaching and counseling.
43.811	So let me begin by urging you,
46.709	particularly you on the youngsters' side,
49.258	on this path you've chosen,
51.234	to go as far as you can.
53.138	The world needs you, badly.
56.606	Humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.
61.124	There is going to be no turning back.
63.603	Although varying among disciplines -- say, astrophysics,
68.528	molecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public
72.49	health, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,
78.684	to public health, environmental science.
81.165	Knowledge in medical science and science overall
84.281	is doubling every 15 to 20 years.
87.418	Technology is increasing at a comparable rate.
90.506	Between them, the two already pervade,
93.49	as most of you here seated realize,
96.354	every dimension of human life.
98.739	So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,
103.795	so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict
108.522	its outcome even a decade from the present moment.
112.97	There will come a time, of course,
114.667	when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,
118.418	which actually began in the 1600s,
120.554	has to peak and level off,
123.37	but that's not going to matter to you.
124.618	The revolution is going to continue
125.932	for at least several more decades.
128.89	It'll render the human condition
130.634	radically different from what it is today.
132.98	Traditional fields of study are going to continue to grow
139.298	and in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.
144.123	In time, all of science will come to be
147.97	a continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.
153.426	That's why you need not just be training
156.626	in one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,
161.066	related to and even distant from your own initial choice.
164.754	Keep your eyes lifted and your head turning.
168.699	The search for knowledge is in our genes.
171.764	It was put there by our distant ancestors
175.276	who spread across the world,
176.899	and it's never going to be quenched.
178.594	To understand and use it sanely,
181.787	as a part of the civilization yet to evolve
185.746	requires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.
191.588	In education, medicine, law, diplomacy,
195.626	government, business and the media that exist today.
199.914	Our political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific
204.874	literacy, which most badly lack today --
207.97	no applause, please.
209.514	It will be better for all
211.972	if they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.
216.643	Therefore you will do well to act on the side,
219.802	no matter how far into the laboratory
222.507	you may go, to serve as teachers
225.826	during the span of your career.
227.834	I'll now proceed quickly,
229.909	and before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset
233.098	and a potential barrier to a scientific career.
236.53	If you are a bit short in mathematical skills,
240.01	don't worry.
241.339	Many of the most successful scientists
243.85	at work today are mathematically semi-literate.
248.05	A metaphor will serve here:
250.535	Where elite mathematicians and statisticians
256.538	and theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm
261.603	of science, the remaining large majority of
265.306	basic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be
270.018	said to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout
275.37	the frontiers, they cut the pathways,
278.122	they raise the buildings along the way.
280.858	Some may have considered me foolhardy,
284.034	but it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics
287.795	when talking to candidate scientists.
289.858	During 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,
293.658	I watched sadly as bright students turned away
297.775	from the possibility of a scientific career
300.699	or even from taking non-required courses in science
304.427	because they were afraid of failure.
306.258	These math-phobes deprive science and medicine
309.618	of immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.
312.867	Here's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:
316.818	Understand that mathematics is a language
319.41	ruled like other verbal languages,
323.234	or like verbal language generally, by its own grammar
326.233	and system of logic.
328.138	Any person with average quantitative intelligence
330.996	who learns to read and write mathematics
334.138	at an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty
340.89	picking up most of the fundamentals
342.954	if they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.
348.291	The longer you wait to become at least semi-literate
352.074	the harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal
358.082	language, but it can be done at any age.
361.059	I speak as an authority
362.77	on that subject, because I'm an extreme case.
366.621	I didn't take algebra until my freshman year
370.282	at the University of Alabama.
372.313	They didn't teach it before then.
374.634	I finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,
379.538	where I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,
384.164	little more than half my age.
386.594	A couple of them were students
388.066	in a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.
391.322	I swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.
396.578	I found out that in science and all its applications,
399.674	what is crucial is not that technical ability,
403.636	but it is imagination in all of its applications.
406.805	The ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes
411.139	pictured by intuition.
414.075	I found out that advances in science rarely come upstream
418.419	from an ability to stand at a blackboard
421.451	and conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions
424.586	and equations.
426.442	They are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,
431.874	during which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.
436.434	Ideas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied
441.633	for its own sake.
443.05	Of foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge
448.691	of all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain
455.34	you propose to enter.
456.78	When something new is discovered,
458.906	it's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is
463.875	to find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.
468.027	If that step proves too difficult for
470.579	the person or team that made the discovery,
474.751	a mathematician can then be added by them
480.05	as a collaborator.
482.347	Consider the following principle,
484.506	which I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:
489.706	It is far easier for scientists
494.106	including medical researchers, to require needed collaboration
498.675	in mathematics and statistics
500.793	than it is for mathematicians and statisticians
504.474	to find scientists able to make use of their equations.
508.57	It is important in choosing the direction to take in science
512.664	to find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,
518.41	and focus on that.
520.05	Keep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:
524.746	For every scientist, whether researcher, technician,
529.282	teacher, manager or businessman,
532.377	working at any level of mathematical competence,
536.364	there exists a discipline in science or medicine
539.818	for which that level is enough to achieve excellence.
543.754	Now I'm going to offer quickly
546.314	several more principles that will be useful
548.722	in organizing your education and career,
551.41	or if you're teaching, how you might
555.795	enhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.
560.683	In selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,
564.482	or to develop world-class expertise,
567.682	take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.
573.01	Judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers
577.722	are on hand.
579.258	This is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement
582.908	of broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself
586.347	in ongoing research to programs of high quality.
590.81	It is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful
595.538	programs, and to make friends and colleagues of your age
599.426	for mutual support.
601.282	But through it all, look for a way to break out,
603.97	to find a field and subject not yet popular.
607.906	We have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.
611.683	There is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,
616.794	as measured in discoveries per investigator per year.
620.411	You may have heard the
622.018	military dictum for the gathering of armies:
625.778	March to the sound of the guns.
628.499	In science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.
635.009	So Wilson's Principle Number Three:
637.714	March away from the sound of the guns.
641.058	Observe from a distance,
642.922	but do not join the fray.
645.019	Make a fray of your own.
647.387	Once you have settled on a specialty,
651.642	and the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,
656.922	your potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it
662.203	enough to become an expert.
664.883	There are thousands of professionally delimited
668.21	subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry
670.686	to biology and medicine.
672.602	And on then into the social sciences,
675.498	where it is possible in short time to acquire
678.7	the status of an authority.
681.274	When the subject is still very thinly populated,
684.786	you can with diligence and hard work become
687.407	the world authority.
689.618	The world needs this kind of expertise,
693.579	and it rewards the kind of people
695.754	willing to acquire it.
697.906	The existing information and what you self-discover
702.402	may at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect
706.513	to other bodies of knowledge.
708.549	Well, if that's the case,
710.418	good. Why hard instead of easy?
714.56	The answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.
719.415	In the attempt to make scientific discoveries,
722.834	every problem is an opportunity,
724.827	and the more difficult the problem,
726.322	the greater will be the importance of its solution.
729.082	Now this brings me to a basic categorization
732.89	in the way scientific discoveries are made.
735.765	Scientists, pure mathematicians among them,
739.129	follow one or the other of two pathways:
742.396	First through early discoveries,
744.506	a problem is identified
746.65	and a solution is sought.
748.482	The problem may be relatively small;
751.011	for example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?
756.432	Or larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?
762.338	As the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered
766.797	and other questions are asked.
768.442	This first of the two strategies is like a hunter,
771.458	exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,
775.707	who finds other quarries along the way.
778.626	The second strategy of research
781.458	is to study a subject broadly
783.25	searching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena
788.026	"like a hunter in what we call ""the naturalist's trance,"""
791.827	the researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,
795.49	any quarry worth taking.
796.874	The search is not for the solution of the problem,
799.227	but for problems themselves worth solving.
802.434	The two strategies of research,
804.426	original research, can be stated as follows,
807.611	in the final principle I'm going to offer you:
811.899	For every problem in a given discipline of science,
816.163	there exists a species or entity or phenomenon
819.738	ideal for its solution.
821.684	And conversely, for every species or other entity
827.082	or phenomenon, there exist important problems
830.018	for the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.
837.595	Find out what they are.
839.532	You'll find your own way to discover,
842.667	to learn, to teach.
844.85	The decades ahead will see dramatic advances
848.283	in disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.
852.85	All of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science
858.875	behind it you will master.
860.458	You have chosen a calling that will come in steps
863.922	to give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.
869.333	And I thank you for having me here tonight.
871.946	(Applause)
877.314	Oh, thank you.
878.586	Thank you very much.
885.742	I salute you.
