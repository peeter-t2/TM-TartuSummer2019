13	A human child is born,
23	and for quite a long time
28	is a consumer.
33	It cannot be consciously a contributor.
45	It is helpless.
47	It doesn't know how to survive,
50	even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
65	It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
81	It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
94	It has to totally surrender,
99	as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.
104	It has to totally surrender.
110	That implies a lot of trust.
120	That implies the trusted person
127	won't violate the trust.
130	As the child grows,
135	it begins to discover
139	that the person trusted is violating the trust.
145	"It doesn't know even the word ""violation."""
150	Therefore, it has to blame itself,
156	a wordless blame,
159	which is more difficult to really resolve --
171	the wordless self-blame.
177	As the child grows to become an adult:
182	so far, it has been a consumer,
186	but the growth of a human being
189	lies in his or her capacity to contribute,
199	to be a contributor.
203	One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,
209	one feels big,
212	one feels: I have enough.
218	To be compassionate is not a joke.
222	It's not that simple.
225	One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
232	That bigness should be centered on oneself,
235	not in terms of money,
238	not in terms of power you wield,
242	not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,
250	but it should be centered on oneself.
255	The self: you are self-aware.
259	On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.
266	Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
276	You can be compassionate occasionally,
281	more moved by empathy
285	than by compassion.
292	Thank God we are empathetic.
296	When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
301	In a Wimbledon final match,
308	these two guys fight it out.
311	Each one has got two games.
316	It can be anybody's game.
319	What they have sweated so far has no meaning.
326	One person wins.
332	The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net
342	and shake hands.
347	The winner boxes the air
350	and kisses the ground,
355	throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.
359	(Laughter)
362	And this guy has to come to the net.
366	When he comes to the net,
369	you see, his whole face changes.
374	It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.
379	Why? Empathy.
384	That's human heart.
386	No human heart is denied of that empathy.
392	No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
398	No culture, no nation and nationalism --
404	nothing can touch it
407	because it is empathy.
410	And that capacity to empathize
416	is the window through which you reach out to people,
424	you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --
429	even words, even time.
434	Compassion is not defined in one form.
439	There's no Indian compassion.
442	There's no American compassion.
446	It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
452	Why? Because it is there in everybody.
463	It's experienced by people occasionally.
470	Then this occasional compassion,
475	we are not talking about --
479	it will never remain occasional.
482	By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
490	"You can't say, ""Please love me."""
494	Love is something you discover.
497	It's not an action,
502	but in the English language, it is also an action.
507	I will come to it later.
511	So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
518	I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,
525	which is within our experience, everybody's experience.
532	In spite of a very tragic life,
541	one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.
551	And the one who is happy,
554	even for a slapstick joke,
562	accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.
571	That means the whole universe,
575	known things and unknown things.
579	All of them are totally accepted
585	because you discover your wholeness in yourself.
591	"The subject -- ""me"" --"
595	and the object -- the scheme of things --
598	fuse into oneness,
603	"an experience nobody can say, ""I am denied of,"""
609	an experience common to all and sundry.
615	That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --
624	all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards
629	and layoffs
634	and, finally, baldness --
638	you can be happy.
642	But the extension of the logic is
647	that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
653	You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
659	There's no choice in this:
661	that only confirms the reality
667	that the wholeness cannot be different from you,
674	cannot be minus you.
678	It has got to be you.
681	You cannot be a part of wholeness
684	and still be whole.
687	Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,
691	that realization, that recognition:
696	"""Maybe I am the whole."
699	Maybe the swami is right.
702	"Maybe the swami is right."" You start your new life."
713	Then everything becomes meaningful.
719	I have no more reason to blame myself.
723	If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
729	But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --
735	if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:
744	body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
750	Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,
754	and power is therefore limited,
757	and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.
762	Compassion is going to be limited.
765	Everything is going to be limitless.
770	You cannot command compassion
776	unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,
780	either you are or you are not. Period.
785	And there is no way of your being not limitless too.
794	Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.
804	And the wholeness is the reality of you
809	when you relate to the world.
811	It is love first.
814	When you relate to the world,
816	the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
821	is, what we say, love.
826	And itself becomes compassion
830	if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.
841	Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.
851	You express yourself because you have compassion.
857	To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.
863	To discover the capacity to give and share,
868	you need to be giving and sharing.
870	There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
875	You learn swimming by swimming.
879	You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
883	(Laughter)
885	You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
889	You learn cooking by cooking,
891	having some sympathetic people around you
894	to eat what you cook.
896	(Laughter)
904	And, therefore, what I say,
908	you have to fake it and make it.
910	(Laughter)
917	You need to.
920	My predecessor meant that.
926	You have to act it out.
931	You have to act compassionately.
938	There is no verb for compassion,
943	but you have an adverb for compassion.
947	That's interesting to me.
951	You act compassionately.
957	But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
961	That is where you fake.
964	You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
968	(Laughter)
973	You fake it and make it.
977	You act compassionately as though you have compassion:
980	grind your teeth,
983	take all the support system.
985	If you know how to pray, pray.
989	Ask for compassion.
992	Let me act compassionately.
995	Do it.
997	You'll discover compassion
999	and also slowly a relative compassion,
1004	and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,
1008	you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation
1013	of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,
1019	and that's what you are.
1021	With these words, thank you very much.
1024	(Applause)
