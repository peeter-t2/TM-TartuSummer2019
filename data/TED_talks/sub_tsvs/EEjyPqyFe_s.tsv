12.96	So it was the fall of 1902,
15.519	and President Theodore Roosevelt
17.437	needed a little break from the White House,
19.217	so he took a train to Mississippi
21.595	to do a little black bear hunting outside of a town
23.723	called Smedes.
25.91	The first day of the hunt,
25.91	they didn't see a single bear,
27.97	so it was a big bummer for everyone,
29.49	but the second day, the dogs cornered one
32.334	after a really long chase, but by that point,
34.734	the president had given up
36.178	and gone back to camp for lunch,
37.92	so his hunting guide cracked the animal
40.531	on the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,
43.199	and then tied it up to a tree
44.907	and started tooting away on his bugle
47.519	to call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor
49.558	of shooting it.
51.074	The bear was a female.
53.431	It was dazed, injured,
56.007	severely underweight, a little mangy-looking,
59.654	and when Roosevelt saw this animal
61.721	tied up to the tree,
63.343	he just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.
65.142	He felt like that would go against his code
67.293	as a sportsman.
69.259	A few days later, the scene was memorialized
71.96	in a political cartoon back in Washington.
74.995	"It was called ""Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"""
77.116	and it showed Roosevelt with
77.116	his gun down and his arm out,
79.495	sparing the bear's life,
81.132	and the bear was sitting on its hind legs
82.658	with these two big, frightened, wide eyes
84.696	and little ears pricked up at the top of its head.
86.826	It looked really helpless, like you just wanted to
88.334	sweep it up into your arms
90.034	and reassure it.
91.25	It wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,
92.716	but if you go looking for the cartoon now,
94.784	you recognize the animal right away:
97.52	It's a teddy bear.
99.474	And this is how the teddy bear was born.
101.095	Essentially, toymakers took
101.095	the bear from the cartoon,
103.603	turned it into a plush toy, and then named it
105.203	after President Roosevelt -- Teddy's bear.
108.397	And I do feel a little ridiculous
110.541	that I'm up here on this stage
113.476	and I'm choosing to use my time
114.894	to tell you about a 100-year-old story
117.162	about the invention of a squishy kid's toy,
120.26	but I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,
124.22	inside that story is a more important story,
127.181	a story about how dramatically our ideas
129.409	about nature can change,
131.005	and also about how, on the planet right now,
134.345	the stories that we tell
136.441	are dramatically changing nature.
138.709	Because think about the teddy bear.
140.241	For us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,
142.746	because bears are so cute and cuddly,
144.249	and who wouldn't want to give
144.249	one to their kids to play with,
146.721	but the truth is that in 1902,
149.253	bears weren't cute and cuddly.
150.881	I mean, they looked the same,
152.182	but no one thought of them that way.
153.315	In 1902, bears were monsters.
156.161	Bears were something that frickin' terrified kids.
159.485	For generations at that point,
161.145	the bear had been a shorthand for all the danger
164.418	that people were encountering on the frontier,
166.177	and the federal government was actually
167.545	systematically exterminating bears
169.83	and lots of other predators too,
171.083	like coyotes and wolves.
172.933	These animals, they were being demonized.
174.781	They were called murderers
176.079	because they killed people's livestock.
178.235	One government biologist, he explained this
180.773	war on animals like the bear by saying
182.953	that they no longer had a place
185.343	in our advancing civilization,
187.589	and so we were just clearing them out of the way.
191.317	In one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves
195.083	had been slaughtered.
196.29	The grizzly would soon be wiped out
198.147	from 95 percent of its original territory,
201.58	and whereas once there had been 30 million bison
204.802	moving across the plains, and you would have
206.42	these stories of trains having to stop
208.128	for four or five hours so that these thick,
210.116	living rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,
213.444	now, by 1902, there were maybe 
213.444	less than 100 left in the wild.
218.803	And so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born
221.84	into the middle of this great spasm of extermination,
225.364	and you can see it as a sign that
226.91	maybe some people deep down
228.55	were starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.
232.616	America still hated the bear and feared it,
235.644	but all of a sudden, America also wanted
237.2	to give the bear a great big hug.
240.086	So this is something that I've been really
240.086	curious about in the last few years.
242.315	How do we imagine animals,
243.989	how do we think and feel about them,
245.587	and how do their reputations get written
248.063	and then rewritten in our minds?
250.319	We're here living in the eye of a great storm
253.163	of extinction where half the species on the planet
256.015	could be gone by the end of the century,
258.167	and so why is it that we come to care about
259.701	some of those species and not others?
262.571	Well, there's a new field, a relatively new field
264.701	of social science that started looking at
266.147	these questions and trying to unpack the powerful
268.315	and sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships
270.047	that we have to animals,
272.168	and I spent a lot of time looking through
273.609	their academic journals,
275.633	and all I can really say is that their findings
277.439	are astonishingly wide-ranging.
279.425	So some of my favorites include that
281.251	the more television a person
281.251	watches in Upstate New York,
283.892	the more he or she is afraid
285.545	of being attacked by a black bear.
287.242	If you show a tiger to an American,
290.03	they're much more likely to assume that it's female
292.14	and not male.
293.4	In a study where a fake snake
295.168	and a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,
297.153	drivers hit the snake much
297.153	more often than the turtle,
299.405	and about three percent of
299.405	drivers who hit the fake animals
301.469	seemed to do it on purpose.
303.747	Women are more likely than men to get a
306.337	"""magical feeling"" when they see dolphins in the surf."
309.372	Sixty-eight percent of mothers with
311.184	"""high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"""
314.564	identified with the dancing cats
316.209	in a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)
318.674	Americans consider lobsters
320.359	more important than pigeons
321.655	but also much, much stupider.
323.841	Wild turkeys are seen as only slightly
323.841	more dangerous than sea otters,
326.837	and pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.
332.01	So some of this is physical, right?
333.443	We tend to sympathize more
333.443	with animals that look like us,
336.066	and especially that resemble human babies,
337.696	so with big, forward-facing eyes
339.123	and circular faces,
340.385	kind of a roly-poly posture.
342.119	This is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,
344.154	your great aunt in Minnesota,
345.294	there's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,
346.867	and not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.
349.579	But it's not all physical, right?
352.248	There's a cultural dimension to
352.248	how we think about animals,
355.432	and we're telling stories about these animals,
357.312	and like all stories,
358.67	they are shaped by the times and the places
360.743	in which we're telling them.
361.619	So think about that moment
363.093	back in 1902 again where a ferocious bear
366.011	became a teddy bear.
367.444	What was the context?
367.444	Well, America was urbanizing.
370.511	For the first time, nearly a
370.511	majority of people lived in cities,
373.27	so there was a growing distance
373.27	between us and nature.
375.706	There was a safe space where we could
377.498	reconsider the bear and romanticize it.
380.172	Nature could only start to
380.172	seem this pure and adorable
382.906	because we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.
385.66	And you can see that cycle playing out
387.185	again and again with all kinds of animals.
389.347	It seems like we're always stuck between
391.223	demonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,
393.63	and then when we get very close to doing that,
395.21	empathizing with it as an underdog
397.747	and wanting to show it compassion.
400.272	So we exert our power,
402.07	but then we're unsettled
403.514	by how powerful we are.
406.289	So for example, this is one of
408.413	probably thousands of letters and drawings
411.05	that kids sent to the Bush administration,
412.594	begging it to protect the polar bear
414.305	under the Endangered Species Act,
415.572	and these were sent back in the mid-2000s,
418.08	when awareness of climate
418.08	change was suddenly surging.
420.233	We kept seeing that image of a polar bear
421.562	stranded on a little ice floe
422.98	looking really morose.
424.327	I spent days looking through these files.
426.091	I really love them. This one's my favorite.
428.25	If you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning
430.361	and then it's also being eaten simultaneously
432.776	by a lobster and a shark.
435.48	This one came from a kid named Fritz,
437.192	and he's actually got a solution to climate change.
438.886	He's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.
440.732	"He says, ""I feel bad about the polar bears."
443.382	I like polar bears.
445.494	"Everyone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."""
451.28	So 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers
454.275	writing about polar bears leaping into their boats
456.583	and trying to devour them,
457.826	even if they lit the bear on fire,
459.493	but these kids don't see the polar bear that way,
461.673	and actually they don't even see the polar bear
463.463	the way that I did back in the '80s.
465.223	I mean, we thought of these animals
466.343	as mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.
469.209	But look now how quickly that climate change
471.529	has flipped the image of the animal in our minds.
474.415	It's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer
476.855	to this delicate, drowning victim,
479.929	and when you think about it, that's kind of
481.442	the conclusion to the story
483.423	that the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,
486.725	because back then, America had more or less
489.615	conquered its share of the continent.
490.93	We were just getting around to
492.233	polishing off these last wild predators.
494.251	Now, society's reach has expanded
496.805	all the way to the top of the world,
498.865	and it's made even these, the most remote,
501.159	the most powerful bears on the planet,
503.191	seem like adorable and blameless victims.
506.69	But you know, there's also a
506.69	postscript to the teddy bear story
509.581	that not a lot of people talk about.
511.218	We're going to talk about it,
513.001	because even though it didn't really take long
515.174	after Roosevelt's hunt in 1902
516.974	for the toy to become a full-blown craze,
518.951	most people figured it was a fad,
521.452	it was a sort of silly political novelty item
523.684	and it would go away once the president left office,
525.926	and so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,
529.723	William Howard Taft,
531.148	was getting ready to be inaugurated,
532.556	the toy industry was on the hunt
534.488	for the next big thing.
537.315	They didn't do too well.
539.572	That January, Taft was the guest of honor
542.171	at a banquet in Atlanta,
543.61	and for days in advance,
545.479	the big news was the menu.
546.924	They were going to be serving him
548.01	a Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,
550.074	called possum and taters.
552.98	So you would have a whole opossum
555.582	roasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,
556.947	and then sometimes they'd leave
558.394	the big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.
561.878	The one brought to Taft's table
563.557	weighed 18 pounds.
566.742	So after dinner, the orchestra started to play,
569.446	and the guests burst into song,
571.286	and all of a sudden, Taft was surprised
572.91	with the presentation of a gift
574.632	from a group of local supporters,
576.524	and this was a stuffed opossum toy,
578.96	all beady-eyed and bald-eared,
581.17	and it was a new product they were putting forward
583.87	to be the William Taft presidency's answer
586.592	to Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.
590.14	"They were calling it the ""billy possum."""
594.586	Within 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company
598.436	was up and running, brokering deals
599.986	for these things nationwide,
601.586	and the Los Angeles Times announced,
603.184	"very confidently, ""The teddy bear"
605.136	has been relegated to a seat in the rear,
607.662	and for four years, possibly eight,
610.26	the children of the United States
612.214	"will play with billy possum."""
615.446	So from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.
617.57	There were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,
620.038	billy possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.
622.2	There were smaller billy possums on a stick
623.93	that kids could wave around like flags.
626.872	But even with all this marketing,
628.79	the life of the billy possum
630.82	turned out to be just pathetically brief.
634.004	The toy was an absolute flop,
636.047	and it was almost completely forgotten
637.626	by the end of the year,
638.994	and what that means is that the billy possum
641.086	didn't even make it to Christmastime,
642.586	which when you think about it is
643.626	a special sort of tragedy for a toy.
647.475	So we can explain that failure two ways.
649.398	The first, well, it's pretty obvious.
651.588	I'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:
653.476	Opossums are hideous. (Laughter)
656.337	But maybe more importantly is that
659	the story of the billy possum was all wrong,
661.69	especially compared
663.221	to the backstory of the teddy bear.
665.302	Think about it: for most of
665.302	human's evolutionary history,
667.544	what's made bears impressive to us
669.869	has been their complete independence from us.
672.041	It's that they live these parallel lives
674.626	as menaces and competitors.
677.131	By the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,
679.486	that stature was being crushed,
681.464	and the animal that he had roped to a tree
683.702	really was a symbol for all bears.
686.003	Whether those animals lived or died now
688.43	was entirely up to the compassion
691.44	or the indifference of people.
693.857	That said something really ominous
695.681	about the future of bears,
698.363	but it also said something very 
698.363	unsettling about who we'd become,
701.5	if the survival of even an animal like that
703.942	was up to us now.
706.231	So now, a century later, if you're at all
708.311	paying attention to what's
708.311	happening in the environment,
710.511	you feel that discomfort so much more intensely.
714.189	We're living now in an age of what scientists
717.011	"have started to call ""conservation reliance,"""
719.221	and what that term means is that we've disrupted
721.411	so much that nature can't possibly
721.411	stand on its own anymore,
724.575	and most endangered species
726.277	are only going to survive
728.049	if we stay out there in the landscape
730.167	riggging the world around them in their favor.
732.663	So we've gone hands-on
734.519	and we can't ever take our hands off,
736.957	and that's a hell of a lot of work.
738.85	Right now, we're training condors
741.929	not to perch on power lines.
743.881	We teach whooping cranes
743.881	to migrate south for the winter
746.594	behind little ultra-light airplanes.
748.893	We're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.
752.202	We monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.
756.552	So we've gone from annihilating species
759.869	to micromanaging the survival of a lot of species
763.373	indefinitely, and which ones?
765.315	Well, the ones that we've told
766.507	compelling stories about,
768.131	the ones we've decided ought to stick around.
771.346	The line between conservation and domestication
774.92	is blurred.
776.945	So what I've been saying is that the stories
778.797	that we tell about wild animals are so subjective
781.42	they can be irrational
782.582	or romanticized or sensationalized.
784.766	Sometimes they just have
784.766	nothing to do with the facts.
787.515	But in a world of conservation reliance,
790.765	those stories have very real consequences,
792.971	because now, how we feel about an animal
795.399	affects its survival
797.029	more than anything that you read about
799.389	in ecology textbooks.
801.438	Storytelling matters now.
803.84	Emotion matters.
805.373	Our imagination has become an ecological force.
811.025	And so maybe the teddy bear worked in part
812.962	because the legend of Roosevelt
815.653	and that bear in Mississippi
817.708	was kind of like an allegory
819.168	of this great responsibility that society
821.261	was just beginning to face up to back then.
823.955	It would be another 71 years
826.375	before the Endangered Species Act was passed,
828.229	but really, here's its whole ethos
830.559	boiled down into something like a scene
832.513	you'd see in a stained glass window.
834.859	The bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,
837.851	and the president of the United States
840.402	decided to show it some mercy.
842.794	Thank you.
845.44	(Applause)
