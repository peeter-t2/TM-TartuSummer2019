12.88	So when I was a kid ...
15.08	this was my team.
16.4	(Laughter)
17.6	I stunk at sports.
19.64	I didn't like to play them,
19.64	I didn't like to watch them.
22.88	So this is what I did. I went fishing.
25.16	And for all of my growing up
25.16	I fished on the shores of Connecticut,
28.68	and these are the creatures
28.68	that I saw on a regular basis.
32.6	But after I grew up and went to college,
35.24	and I came home in the early 90's,
37.92	this is what I found.
39.64	My team had shrunk.
41.28	It was like literally having
41.28	your roster devastated.
44.4	And as I sort of looked into that,
46.44	from a very personal
46.44	point of view as a fisherman,
48.84	I started to kind of figure out,
50.44	well, what was the rest of the world
50.44	thinking about it?
53.04	First place I started to look
53.04	was fish markets.
55.28	And when I went to fish markets,
57.08	in spite of where I was --
58.36	whether I was in North Carolina,
58.36	or Paris, or London, or wherever --
62.44	I kept seeing this weirdly
62.44	repeating trope of four creatures,
67.64	again and again --
68.88	on the menus, on ice --
70.48	shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.
73.36	And I thought this was pretty strange,
75.76	and as I looked at it, I was wondering,
77.8	did anyone else notice
77.8	this sort of shrinking of the market?
81.44	Well, when I looked into it,
82.84	I realized that people
82.84	didn't look at it as their team.
85.76	Ordinary people, the way they looked
85.76	at seafood was like this.
89.44	It's not an unusual human characteristic
91.92	to reduce the natural world
91.92	down to very few elements.
95.64	We did it before, 10,000 years ago,
95.64	when we came out of our caves.
98.96	If you look at fire pits
98.96	from 10,000 years ago,
101.52	you'll see raccoons,
101.52	you'll see, you know, wolves,
104.12	you'll see all kinds
104.12	of different creatures.
106.2	But if you telescope to the age of --
106.2	you know, 2,000 years ago,
109.88	you'll see these four mammals:
111.8	pigs, cows, sheep and goats.
114.24	It's true of birds, too.
115.48	You look at the menus
115.48	in New York City restaurants
120.24	you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse,
120.24	dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.
125	But telescope ahead to the age
125	of modern animal husbandry,
127.96	and you'll see four:
129.36	turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.
132.48	So it makes sense
132.48	that we've headed in this direction.
135.08	But how have we headed in this direction?
137.057	Well ...
138.28	first it's a very, very new problem.
140.16	This is the way we've been fishing
140.16	the oceans over the last 50 years.
143.92	World War II was a tremendous incentive
143.92	to arm ourselves in a war against fish.
149.16	All of the technology
149.16	that we perfected during World War II --
152.44	sonar, lightweight polymers --
154.12	all these things
154.12	were redirected towards fish.
156.44	And so you see this tremendous buildup
156.44	in fishing capacity,
159.88	quadrupling in the course of time,
161.56	from the end of World War II
161.56	to the present time.
164.48	And right now that means
165.88	we're taking between 80 and 90 million
165.88	metric tons out of the sea every year.
169.56	That's the equivalent
169.56	of the human weight of China
172.8	taken out of the sea every year.
174.36	And it's no coincidence
174.36	that I use China as the example
177	because China is now
177	the largest fishing nation in the world.
180.04	Well, that's only half the story.
181.68	The other half of the story
183.08	is this incredible boom
183.08	in fish farming and aquaculture,
187.16	which is now, only
187.16	in the last year or two,
189.4	starting to exceed the amount
189.4	of wild fish that we produce.
192.8	So that if you add wild fish
192.8	and farmed fish together,
196.84	you get the equivalent
196.84	of two Chinas created from the ocean
200.32	each and every year.
201.6	And again, it's not a coincidence
201.6	that I use China as the example,
204.76	because China, in addition
204.76	to being the biggest catcher of fish,
207.84	is also the biggest farmer of fish.
210.84	So let's look though at the four choices
210.84	we are making right now.
215.4	The first one --
216.64	by far the most consumed seafood
216.64	in America and in much of the West,
220.36	is shrimp.
221.6	Shrimp in the wild --
221.6	as a wild product --
224.08	is a terrible product.
225.44	5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish
225.44	are regularly killed
229.92	to bring one pound of shrimp
229.92	to the market.
232.36	They're also incredibly fuel inefficient
232.36	to bring to the market.
235.48	In a recent study that was produced
235.48	out of Dalhousie University,
238.6	it was found that dragging for shrimp
240.44	is one of the most carbon-intensive
240.44	ways of fishing that you can find.
244.64	So you can farm them,
246.32	and people do farm them,
247.6	and they farm them a lot
247.6	in this very area.
249.64	Problem is ...
250.88	the place where you farm shrimp
250.88	is in these wild habitats --
254.12	in mangrove forests.
255.36	Now look at those lovely
255.36	roots coming down.
257.44	Those are the things
257.44	that hold soil together,
259.56	protect coasts, create habitats
259.56	for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,
263.36	all sorts of things
263.36	that are important to this environment.
266.161	Well, this is what happens
266.161	to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.
269.185	We've lost millions of acres
269.185	of coastal mangroves
271.519	over the last 30 or 40 years.
272.959	That rate of destruction has slowed,
275.44	but we're still
275.44	in a major mangrove deficit.
278.76	The other thing that's going on here
280.52	is a phenomenon that the filmmaker
280.52	"Mark Benjamin called ""Grinding Nemo."""
284.68	This phenomenon is very, very relevant
287.2	to anything that you've ever seen
287.2	on a tropical reef.
289.72	Because what's going on right now,
291.4	we have shrimp draggers
291.4	dragging for shrimp,
293.6	catching a huge amount of bycatch,
295.48	that bycatch in turn gets ground up
295.48	and turned into shrimp food.
299.6	And sometimes, many of these vessels --
301.76	manned by slaves --
303.16	"are catching these so-called ""trash fish,"""
305.88	fish that we would love to see on a reef,
307.857	grinding them up
309.08	and turning them into shrimp feed --
310.864	an ecosystem literally eating itself
310.864	and spitting out shrimp.
315.12	The next most consumed seafood in America,
317.32	and also throughout the West,
319.04	is tuna.
320.28	So tuna is this ultimate global fish.
323.36	These huge management areas
323.36	have to be observed
326.4	in order for tuna to be well managed.
328.36	Our own management area,
330.16	called a Regional Fisheries
330.16	Management Organization,
332.64	is called ICCAT,
333.88	the International Commission
333.88	for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.
337.12	The great naturalist
337.12	Carl Safina once called it,
339.84	"""The International Conspiracy"
339.84	"to Catch all the Tunas."""
343.12	Of course we've seen
343.12	incredible improvement
345.2	in ICCAT in the last few years,
346.72	there is total room for improvement,
348.48	but it remains to be said
348.48	that tuna is a global fish,
351.4	and to manage it,
351.4	we have to manage the globe.
354.24	Well, we could also try to grow tuna
356.2	but tuna is a spectacularly bad
356.2	animal for aquaculture.
359.84	Many people don't know this
359.84	but tuna are warm-blooded.
362.96	They can heat their bodies 20 degrees
362.96	above ambient temperature,
366.4	they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.
368.52	So that pretty much eliminates
370.28	all the advantages
370.28	of farming a fish, right?
372.4	A farmed fish is --
373.64	or a fish is cold-blooded,
373.64	it doesn't move too much.
376.093	That's a great thing for growing protein.
378.12	But if you've got
378.12	this crazy, wild creature
380.48	that swims at 40 miles an hour
380.48	and heats its blood --
383	not a great candidate for aquaculture.
385.76	The next creature --
387	most consumed seafood in America
387	and throughout the West --
390	is salmon.
391.24	Now salmon got its plundering, too,
393.44	but it didn't really necessarily
393.44	happen through fishing.
396.6	This is my home state of Connecticut.
398.4	Connecticut used to be home
398.4	to a lot of wild salmon.
401.48	But if you look
401.48	at this map of Connecticut,
403.56	every dot on that map is a dam.
407.4	There are over 3,000 dams
407.4	in the state of Connecticut.
411.28	I often say this is why people
411.28	in Connecticut are so uptight --
414.84	(Laughter)
416.44	If somebody could just
416.44	unblock Connecticut's chi,
420	I feel that we could have
420	an infinitely better world.
422.52	But I made this particular comment
424.28	at a convention once
424.28	of national parks officers,
426.96	and this guy from North Carolina
426.96	sidled up to me, he says,
429.72	"""You know, you oughtn't be so hard"
429.72	on your Connecticut,
433.04	cause we here in North Carolina,
433.04	"we got 35,000 dams."""
437.88	So it's a national epidemic,
437.88	it's an international epidemic.
440.76	And there are dams everywhere,
442.24	and these are precisely the things
443.92	that stop wild salmon
443.92	from reaching their spawning grounds.
446.72	So as a result,
446.72	we've turned to aquaculture,
448.84	and salmon is one the most successful,
448.84	at least from a numbers point of view.
452.52	When they first started farming salmon,
454.76	it could take as many
454.76	as six pounds of wild fish
457.72	to make a single pound of salmon.
459.92	The industry has, to its credit,
459.92	greatly improved.
462.6	They've gotten it below two to one,
464.291	although it's a little bit of a cheat
466.6	because if you look at the way
466.6	aquaculture feed is produced,
469.44	they're measuring pellets --
470.92	pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.
473.2	Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.
475.88	So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,
475.88	the fish in and the fish out --
479.4	kind of hard to say.
480.76	But in any case,
482	credit to the industry,
483.24	it has lowered the amount of fish
483.24	per pound of salmon.
485.84	Problem is we've also gone crazy
488.04	with the amount of salmon
488.04	that we're producing.
490.28	Aquaculture is the fastest growing
490.28	food system on the planet.
493.92	It's growing at something
493.92	like seven percent per year.
496.92	And so even though
496.92	we're doing less per fish
500.96	to bring it to the market,
502.28	we're still killing
502.28	a lot of these little fish.
505.04	And it's not just fish
505.04	that we're feeding fish to,
508.24	we're also feeding fish
508.24	to chickens and pigs.
511.6	So we've got chickens
511.6	and they're eating fish,
514.56	but weirdly, we also have fish
514.56	that are eating chickens.
518.84	Because the byproducts of chickens --
518.84	feathers, blood, bone --
521.96	get ground up and fed to fish.
524.28	So I often wonder,
525.52	is there a fish that ate
525.52	a chicken that ate a fish?
529.36	It's sort of a reworking
529.36	of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --
532.4	(Laughter)
533.52	All together, though,
533.52	it results in a terrible mess.
536.32	What you're talking about
537.72	is something between 20 and 30 million
537.72	metric tons of wild creatures
543.4	that are taken from the ocean
543.4	and used and ground up.
546.4	That's the equivalent
546.4	of a third of a China,
548.48	or of an entire United States of humans
550.56	that's taken out of the sea
550.56	each and every year.
554.16	The last of the four
554.16	is a kind of amorphous thing.
556.72	"It's what the industry calls ""whitefish."""
560.24	There are many fish that get cycled
560.24	into this whitefish thing
563.24	but the way to kind of tell
563.24	the story, I think,
565.48	is through that classic piece
565.48	of American culinary innovation,
568.44	the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.
569.84	So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
569.84	actually started as halibut.
572.84	And it started because
572.84	a local franchise owner
575.2	found that when he served
575.2	his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.
580.76	Because it was a Catholic
580.76	community, they needed fish.
583.32	So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,
585.2	"""I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,"
585.2	"going to be made out of halibut."""
588.72	"Ray Kroc said, ""I don't think"
588.72	it's going to work.
591.04	I want to do a Hula Burger,
592.36	and there's going to be
592.36	a slice of pineapple on a bun.
594.908	But let's do this, let's have a bet.
596.668	Whosever sandwich sells more,
596.668	"that will be the winning sandwich."""
600.2	Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean
600.2	that the Hula Burger didn't win.
604.56	So he made his halibut sandwich.
606.72	Unfortunately though,
606.72	the sandwich came in at 30 cents.
610.08	Ray wanted the sandwich
610.08	to come in at 25 cents,
612.64	so he turned to Atlantic cod.
614.6	We all know what happened to
614.6	Atlantic cod in New England.
617.4	So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
617.4	is made out of Alaska pollock,
620.92	it's the largest fin fish fishery
620.92	in the United States,
623.68	2 to 3 billion pounds of fish
623.68	taken out of the sea every single year.
628.08	If we go through the pollock,
629.64	the next choice is probably
629.64	going to be tilapia.
632.12	Tilapia is one of those fish
632.12	nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.
635.12	It's actually a very efficient converter
635.12	of plant protein into animal protein,
639.4	and it's been a godsend
639.4	to the third world.
641.48	It's actually a tremendously
641.48	sustainable solution,
643.88	it goes from an egg
643.88	to an adult in nine months.
646.12	The problem is that when you
646.12	look about the West,
648.48	it doesn't do what the West
648.48	wants it to do.
650.52	It really doesn't have what's called
650.52	an oily fish profile.
653.28	It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s
655.68	that we all think are going
655.68	to make us live forever.
659	So what do we do?
660.52	I mean, first of all,
660.52	what about this poor fish, the clupeids?
663.72	The fish that represent a huge part
663.72	of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.
668.76	Well, one possibility
668.76	that a lot of conservationists have raised
671.84	is could we eat them?
673.48	Could we eat them directly
673.48	instead of feeding them to salmon?
676.4	There are arguments for it.
677.76	They are tremendously fuel efficient
677.76	to bring to market,
680.404	a fraction of the fuel cost
680.404	of say, shrimp,
682.52	and at the very top
682.52	of the carbon efficiency scale.
685.88	They also are omega-3 rich,
685.88	a great source for EPA and DHA.
690.04	So that is a potential.
691.52	And if we were to go down that route
691.52	what I would say is,
695.24	instead of paying a few bucks a pound --
695.24	or a few bucks a ton, really --
699.08	and making it into aquafeed,
701.08	could we halve the catch
701.08	and double the price for the fishermen
704.4	and make that our way
704.4	of treating these particular fish?
709.2	Other possibility though,
709.2	which is much more interesting,
711.92	is looking at bivalves,
711.92	particularly mussels.
714.32	Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA,
714.32	they're similar to canned tuna.
719.28	They're also extremely fuel efficient.
721.24	To bring a pound of mussels to market
723.08	is about a thirtieth of the carbon
723.08	as required to bring beef to market.
726.72	They require no forage fish,
728.32	they actually get their omega-3s
728.32	by filtering the water of microalgae.
732.6	In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,
732.6	they don't come from fish.
735.84	Microalgae make the omega-3s,
735.84	they're only bioconcentrated in fish.
739.92	Mussels and other bivalves
741.2	do tremendous amounts of water filtration.
743.224	A single mussel can filter
743.224	dozens of gallons every single day.
746.8	And this is incredibly important
746.8	when we look at the world.
749.6	Right now, nitrification,
749.6	overuse of phosphates in our waterways
753.2	are causing tremendous algal blooms.
755.56	Over 400 new dead zones
755.56	have been created in the last 20 years,
759.84	tremendous sources of marine life death.
764.32	We also could look at not a fish at all.
766.52	We could look at a vegetable.
767.96	We could look at seaweed, the kelps,
769.72	all these different varieties of things
769.72	that can be high in omega-3s,
773.08	can be high in proteins,
774.4	tremendously good things.
776.04	They filter the water
776.04	just like mussels do.
778.72	And weirdly enough,
780	it turns out that you
780	can actually feed this to cows.
782.64	Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.
784.88	But if you wanted to keep growing cattle
786.84	in a time and place
786.84	where water resources are limited,
789.68	you're growing seaweed in the water,
789.68	you don't have to water it --
792.8	major consideration.
794.48	And the last fish is a question mark.
797.24	We have the ability
797.24	to create aquacultured fish
801.12	that creates a net gain
801.12	of marine protein for us.
804.56	This creature would have to be vegetarian,
806.72	it would have to be fast growing,
808.52	it would have to be adaptable
808.52	to a changing climate
811.2	and it would have to have
811.2	that oily fish profile,
813.56	that EPA, DHA, omega-3
813.56	fatty acid profile that we're looking for.
817.48	This exists kind of on paper.
820.44	I have been reporting
820.44	on these subjects for 15 years.
824.08	Every time I do a new story,
824.08	somebody tells me,
827	"""We can do all that. We can do it."
827	We've figured it all out.
829.88	We can produce a fish
831.12	that's a net gain of marine protein
831.12	"and has omega-3s."""
833.72	Great.
834.96	It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.
837.12	It is time to scale this up.
838.88	If we do,
	a third of the world catch,
843.64	stays in the water.
845.88	So I guess what I'm saying is
845.88	this is what we've been going with.
849.2	We tend to go with our appetites
849.2	rather than our minds.
852.4	But if we went with this,
852.4	or some configuration of it,
855.92	we might have a little more of this.
859.12	Thank you.
