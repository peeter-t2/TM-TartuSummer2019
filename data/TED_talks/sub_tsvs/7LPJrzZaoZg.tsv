12.86	I've got a confession.
14.58	I love looking through people's garbage.
17.812	Now, it's not some creepy thing.
19.741	I'm usually just looking
19.741	for old electronics,
21.931	stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
24.381	I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
28.044	Each one's got three different motors,
30.677	so now you can build things that move.
32.638	There's switches so you can
32.638	turn things on and off.
35.377	There's even a freaking laser,
37.259	so you can make a cool robot
37.259	into an awesome robot.
42.778	Now, I've built
42.778	a lot of stuff out of garbage,
45.968	and some of these things
45.968	have even been kind of useful.
48.773	But here's the thing,
49.982	for me, garbage is just a chance to play,
52.607	to be creative and build things
52.607	to amuse myself.
55.554	This is what I love doing,
55.554	so I just made it part of my day job.
59.214	I lead a university-based
59.214	biological research lab,
61.795	where we value curiosity
61.795	and exploration above all else.
65.756	We aren't focused
65.756	on any particular problem,
68.376	and we're not trying to solve
68.376	any particular disease.
70.962	This is just a place where people can come
73.67	and ask fascinating questions
73.67	and find answers.
77.47	And I realized a long time ago
79.359	that if I challenge people
79.359	to build the equipment they need
82.625	out of the garbage I find,
84.762	it's a great way to foster creativity.
87.549	And what happened
88.724	was that artists and scientists
88.724	from around the world
91.629	started coming to my lab.
93.669	And it's not just because
93.669	we value unconventional ideas,
96.902	it's because we test and validate them
99.244	with scientific rigor.
101.62	So one day I was hacking something,
101.62	I was taking it apart,
105.545	and I had this sudden idea:
107.426	Could I treat biology like hardware?
110.889	Could I dismantle a biological system,
113.164	mix and match the parts
114.611	and then put it back together
114.611	in some new and creative way?
117.946	My lab started working on this,
120.054	and I want to show you the result.
123.601	Can any of you guys
123.601	tell me what fruit this is?
127.278	Audience: Apple!
128.453	Andrew Pelling:
128.453	That's right -- it's an apple.
130.634	Now, I actually want you to notice as well
132.657	that this is a lot redder
132.657	than most apples.
136.294	And that's because
136.294	we grew human cells into it.
139.044	We took a totally innocent
139.044	Macintosh apple,
143.246	removed all the apple cells and DNA
146.289	and then implanted human cells.
148.332	And what we're left with
148.332	after removing all the apple cells
151.405	is this cellulose scaffold.
153.17	This is the stuff that gives plants
153.17	their shape and texture.
156.331	And these little holes that you can see,
158.327	this is where all
158.327	the apple cells used to be.
161.254	So then we come along,
162.462	we implant some mammalian cells
162.462	that you can see in blue.
165.548	What happens is,
165.548	these guys start multiplying
167.78	and they fill up this entire scaffold.
170.414	As weird as this is,
172.775	it's actually really reminiscent
172.775	of how our own tissues are organized.
176.955	And we found in our pre-clinical work
179.232	that you can implant
179.232	these scaffolds into the body,
181.652	and the body will send in cells
181.652	and a blood supply
184.359	and actually keep these things alive.
187.348	This is the point
187.348	when people started asking me,
190.469	"""Andrew, can you make"
190.469	"body parts out of apples?"""
195.794	"And I'm like, ""You've come"
195.794	"to the right place."""
198.049	(Laughter)
199.715	I actually brought this up with my wife.
201.924	She's a musical instrument maker,
203.682	and she does a lot
203.682	of wood carving for a living.
206.529	So I asked her,
208.865	"""Could you, like,"
208.865	literally carve some ears
212.126	"out of an apple for us?"""
213.682	And she did.
215.157	So I took her ears to the lab.
217.953	We then started preparing them.
220.979	Yeah, I know.
222.34	(Laughter)
225.397	It's a good lab, man.
227.139	(Laughter)
228.624	And then we grew cells on them.
231.008	And this is the result.
233.916	Listen, my lab is not
233.916	in the ear-manufacturing business.
239.778	People have actually been working
239.778	on this for decades.
243.138	Here's the issue:
244.81	commercial scaffolds can be
244.81	really expensive and problematic,
249.24	because they're sourced
249.24	from proprietary products,
251.865	animals or cadavers.
259.259	We used an apple and it cost pennies.
262.873	What's also really cool here
264.934	is it's not that hard
264.934	to make these things.
267.103	The equipment you need
267.103	can be built from garbage,
270.059	and the key processing step
270.059	only requires soap and water.
274.866	So what we did was put all
274.866	the instructions online as open source.
279.393	And then we founded
279.393	a mission-driven company,
281.553	and we're developing kits
281.553	to make it easier
283.955	for anyone with a sink
283.955	and a soldering iron
286.55	to make these things at home.
288.132	What I'm really curious
288.132	about is if one day,
292.229	it will be possible to repair, rebuild
292.229	and augment our own bodies
297.504	with stuff we make in the kitchen.
301.321	Speaking of kitchens,
303.442	here's some asparagus.
305.402	They're tasty, and they make
305.402	your pee smell funny.
308.109	(Laughter)
309.386	Now, I was in my kitchen,
309.386	and I was noticing
312.033	that when you look down
312.033	the stalks of these asparagus,
314.643	what you can see
314.643	are all these tiny little vessels.
317.658	And when we image them in the lab,
319.331	you can see how the cellulose
319.331	forms these structures.
322.832	This image reminds me of two things:
325.701	our blood vessels
327.607	and the structure and organization
327.607	of our nerves and spinal cord.
331.854	So here's the question:
333.86	Can we grow axons and neurons
333.86	down these channels?
338.064	Because if we can,
339.714	then maybe we can use asparagus
339.714	to form new connections
344.005	between the ends of damaged
344.005	and severed nerves.
347.627	Or maybe even a spinal cord.
350.126	Don't get me wrong --
351.436	this is exceptionally challenging
353.464	and really hard work to do,
355.083	and we are not the only ones
355.083	working on this.
358.116	But we are the only ones using asparagus.
361.08	(Laughter)
364.06	Right now, we've got
364.06	really promising pilot data.
367.202	And we're working with tissue engineers
369.109	and neurosurgeons
370.299	to find out what's actually possible.
372.793	So listen, all of the work I've shown you,
375.371	the stuff that I've built
375.371	that's all around me on this stage
378.588	and the other projects
378.588	my lab is involved in
381.282	are all a direct result
381.282	of me playing with your garbage.
385.393	Play -- play is a key part
385.393	of my scientific practice.
391.454	It's how I train my mind
391.454	to be unconventional and to be creative
395.462	and to decide to make human apple ears.
398.491	So, the next time any of you
398.491	are looking at some old,
403.166	broken-down, malfunctioning,
403.166	piece-of-crap technology,
407.769	I want you to think of me.
410.199	Because I want it.
411.381	(Laughter)
412.556	Seriously, please find any way
412.556	to get in touch with me,
416.587	and let's see what we can build.
418.552	Thank you.
419.727	(Applause)
