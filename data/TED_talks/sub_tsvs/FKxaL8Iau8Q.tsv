12.585	I'm going to be talking about designing humor,
14.445	which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes
16.419	to some of the discussions about constraints,
20.127	and how in certain contexts, humor is right,
22.885	and in other contexts it's wrong.
24.576	Now, I'm from New York,
27.352	so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.
30.938	Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,
37.43	Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor
42.413	except this woman.
45.129	(Video) Woman: (Laughs)
62.378	Bob Mankoff: That's my first wife.
63.778	(Laughter)
66.053	That part of the relationship went fine.
68.545	(Laughter)
72.11	Now let's look at this cartoon.
75.632	One of the things I'm pointing out is that
77.208	cartoons appear within the context
79.512	of The New Yorker magazine,
81.225	that lovely Caslon type, and it seems
83.166	like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.
86.64	It's making a little bit fun of getting older,
88.711	and, you know, people might like it.
90.063	But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.
93.299	You couldn't satisfy this guy.
95.745	"""Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit."
98.832	It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,
100.492	"but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."""
103.965	(Laughter)
107.183	The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,
110.693	very easy for people to get their nose out of joint.
113.301	And one of the things that you realize
116.235	is it's an unusual environment.
118.702	Here I'm one person talking to you.
120.845	You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.
124.543	In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,
128.824	and when you actually look at that,
130.316	and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,
133.828	and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor
137.144	is really interesting.
138.727	Let's look at this cartoon.
140.365	"""Discouraging data on the antidepressant."""
142.7	(Laughter)
144.724	Indeed, it is discouraging.
147.735	Now, you would think, well, look,
149.537	most of you laughed at that.
151.206	Right? You thought it was funny.
152.627	In general, that seems like a funny cartoon,
154.309	but let's look what online survey I did.
157.693	Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
159.81	A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
163.173	But look at the individual responses.
165.484	"""I like animals!!!!!"" Look how much they like them."
167.787	(Laughter)
171.314	"""I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."""
174.413	This person rated it a two.
176.302	"""I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons."""
180.684	To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.
185.81	Other people thought it was funny.
187.567	That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor
190.636	when you don't have the contagion of humor.
194.814	Humor is a type of entertainment.
196.531	All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,
200.338	something that might happen wrong,
202.458	and yet we like it when there's protection.
204.927	That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.
207.662	The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?
211.812	That's a bad zoo.
213.393	(Laughter)
215.916	It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.
219.938	But this is a worse one.
222.093	(Laughter)
225.898	So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,
230.017	you have to see, where is that tiger going to be?
232.866	Where is the danger going to exist?
234.228	How are you going to manage it?
236.447	My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.
240.844	But The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,
245.063	and we have 1,000 cartoons.
246.58	Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.
249.456	Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine
252.619	if we removed the articles.
254.635	(Laughter)
258.367	But I feel that would be a huge loss,
263.324	one I could live with, but still huge.
267.097	Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.
270.013	The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine
272.011	does 10 or 15 ideas every week.
274.567	But they mostly are going to be rejected.
277.633	That's the nature of any creative activity.
280.677	Many of them fade away. Some of them stay.
284.141	Matt Diffee is one of them.
285.559	Here's one of his cartoons.
287.577	(Laughter)
293.152	"Drew Dernavich. ""Accounting night at the improv."""
296.046	"""Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience"
298.15	"to shout out some random numbers."""
302.909	"Paul Noth. ""He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."""
307.685	(Laughter)
312.458	Now I know all about rejection,
314.34	because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school
318.587	and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,
322.019	from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,
327.093	and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.
331.689	At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --
336.041	[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] —
337.036	magically changed to this.
338.61	[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]
342.048	(Laughter)
344.859	Now of course that's not what happened,
347.128	but that's the emotional truth.
351.745	And of course, that is not New Yorker humor.
354.168	What is New Yorker humor?
355.957	Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.
360.649	Finally, in 1980, I received the revered
363.53	New Yorker contract,
365.724	which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business.
369.759	"From 1980. ""Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement"
373.269	"there of -- "" blah blah blah blah -- blur --"
375.722	"""for any idea drawings."""
379.15	With respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract
382.176	"is the word ""cartoon"" mentioned."
384.255	"The word ""idea drawings,"" and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons."
389.704	So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something
393.129	that requires you to think.
396.414	Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking
399.199	on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part
402.196	to make it into a cartoon.
404.306	(Laughter)
410.071	Here are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.
415.214	"""There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."""
421.359	This is What Lemmings Believe.
423.327	(Laughter)
429.616	The New Yorker and I, when we made comments,
432.541	the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.
437.052	What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?
439.34	No. It's about us.
441.692	You know, it's my view basically about religion,
444.572	that the real conflict and all the fights between religion
449.259	is who has the best imaginary friend.
452.14	(Laughter)
457.271	And this is my most well-known cartoon.
459.263	"""No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"""
463.015	It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.
465.582	It's even on thongs,
468.344	"but compressed to ""How about never — is never good for you?"""
474.971	Now these look like very different forms of humor
478.37	but actually they bear a great similarity.
480.764	In each instance, our expectations are defied.
485.187	In each instance, the narrative gets switched.
488.903	There's an incongruity and a contrast.
491.157	"In ""No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"""
494.406	what you have is the syntax of politeness
496.886	and the message of being rude.
499.147	That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy
502.416	where we mash up these two things which don't go together
506.195	and temporarily in our minds exist.
508.976	He is both being polite and rude.
511.496	In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker
514.767	and the vulgarity of the language.
516.748	Basically, that's the way humor works.
518.773	So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.
521.295	Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.
524.837	Nobody is much interested, and the frog dies.
527.485	Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.
532.208	But really, it makes me —
534.013	Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,
536.085	The Laughing Audience.
538.017	There are the people, fops up there,
539.798	but everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing
542.923	except one guy.
545.414	This guy. Who is he? He's the critic.
549.954	He's the critic of humor,
552.396	and really I'm forced to be in that position,
555.564	when I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger
558.86	that I will become this guy.
563.977	Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of
566.87	how they imagine if we really exaggerated that.
570.594	"(Video) Bob Mankoff: ""Oooh, no."
573.62	Ehhh.
576.148	Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.
585.422	Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.
589.36	I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.
592.059	No. Nah. No.
595.72	Overdrawn. Underdrawn.
598.717	Drawn just right, still not funny enough.
601.387	No. No.
604.653	For God's sake no, a thousand times no.
608.018	(Music)
611.292	No. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later]
617.277	Hey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?
621.043	Office worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.
623.186	Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.
626.111	Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.
628.054	Office worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.
630.256	Eh, no.
631.696	Office worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.
633.111	Office worker: BLT?BM: No.
634.048	Office worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No.
636.668	Office worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.
639.189	(Music)
641.77	No. No.
643.714	Definitely no. [Several hours after lunch]
646.944	(Siren)
668.695	No. Get out of here.
671.192	(Laughter)
672.609	That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.
676.086	Now, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,
679.352	"so many that there are many books called ""The Rejection Collection."""
682.456	"""The Rejection Collection"" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor."
686.834	And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here
689.301	who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.
693.124	See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.
695.612	It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.
698.889	So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.
703.311	"""I'm thinking about having a child."""
706.022	(Laughter)
711.31	There you have an interesting -- the guilty laugh,
715.084	the laugh against your better judgment.
718.342	(Laughter)
721.393	"""Ass-head. Please help."""
724.555	(Laughter)
726.838	Now, in fact, within a context of this book,
730.502	"which says, ""Cartoons you never saw and never will see"
733.544	"in The New Yorker,"" this humor is perfect."
736.267	I'm going to explain why.
737.872	There's a concept about humor about it being
739.584	a benign violation.
741.917	In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think
743.894	it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.
747.435	"If we think it's completely wrong, we say, ""That's not funny."""
750.371	And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?
754.036	"And so, this benign, that's true of ""No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"""
759.416	It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.
761.574	Within that context, we feel it's okay.
764.478	"So within this context, ""Asshead. Please help"""
767.69	is a benign violation.
769.734	Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
774.063	"""T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response"
777.606	"help treat cancer?"" Oh, goodness."
781.516	You're reading about this smart stuff,
785.278	this intelligent dissection of the immune system.
789.299	You glance over at this, and it says,
793.032	"""Asshead. Please help""? God."
798.194	So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.
802.794	There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.
805.917	Everything will be within the context and our expectations.
809.768	One way to look at it is this.
813.206	It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,
817.347	a theory about motivation and the mood we're in
819.195	and how the mood we're in determines the things we like
822.309	or dislike.
824.009	When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.
828.307	We want high arousal. We feel excited then.
831.616	If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.
834.22	"""The Rejection Collection"" is absolutely in this field."
839.801	You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.
842.157	You want to be transgressed.
846.647	It's like this, like an amusement park.
851.017	Voice: Here we go. (Screams)
860.18	He laughs. He is both in danger and safe,
864.15	incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.
867.298	If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,
870.523	they will laugh at very, very little.
872.789	"This is another cartoon from ""The Rejection Collection."""
875.074	"""Too snug?"""
879.533	That's a cartoon about terrorism.
881.736	The New Yorker occupies a very different space.
885.092	It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,
888.817	and in that space, the cartoons are different.
892.309	Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did
894.678	right after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.
899.276	How would The New Yorker attack it?
900.705	"It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, ""Too snug?"""
905.258	Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because
907.482	actually I thought maybe people would be offended.
911.442	The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened
915.088	after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,
919.12	the suicide bomber is all in little pieces,
921.909	and he's saying to the suicide bomber,
924.009	"""You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."""
927.28	(Laughter)
931.382	Better left undrawn.
934.806	The first week we did no cartoons.
937.454	That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.
940.43	It's not always appropriate every time.
943.028	But the next week, this was the first cartoon.
946.676	"""I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."""
951.286	It basically was about, if we were alive,
954.305	we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.
956.102	We were going to exist. Here's another one.
958.373	"""I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."""
963.708	These cartoons are not about them. They're about us.
967.266	The humor reflects back on us.
969.59	The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,
973.425	is a friend makes fun of an enemy.
977.05	It's called dispositional humor.
979.183	It's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.
982.652	Here's another cartoon.
985.062	"""I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."""
988.694	(Laughter)
997.851	Humor does need a target.
1002.215	But interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.
1006.391	The target is the readership and the people who do it.
1008.951	The humor is self-reflective
1011.119	and makes us think about our assumptions.
1013.972	Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary.
1017.507	"""Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,"
1020.161	three years your junior, your age on the dot,
1023.127	"exactly your age."""
1025.695	That is a deeply profound cartoon.
1029.119	And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,
1033.59	make cartoons say something besides funny
1037.297	and something about us. Here's another one.
1039.544	"""I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,"
1041.752	"Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people."""
1045.075	(Laughter)
1050.722	"""Excuse me — I think there's something wrong with this"
1053.763	"in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint."""
1059.587	So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,
1063.563	our foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.
1067.828	The New Yorker demands
1070.35	some cognitive work on your part,
1073.067	and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,
1075.422	"who wrote ""The Act of Creation"" about the relationship"
1078.337	between humor, art and science,
1081.134	is what's called bisociation.
1083.214	You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,
1086.81	and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.
1089.982	If the different frames of reference don't come together
1092.464	in about .5 seconds, it's not funny,
1094.45	but I think they will for you here.
1096.384	Different frames of reference.
1098.458	"""You slept with her, didn't you?"""
1101.286	(Laughter)
1106.574	"""Lassie! Get help!!"""
1108.915	(Laughter)
1112.883	It's called French Army Knife.
1115.575	(Laughter)
1122.031	"And this is Einstein in bed. ""To you it was fast."""
1124.699	(Laughter)
1131.93	Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.
1135.154	Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.
1139.218	How many people know what this cartoon means?
1143.445	The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.
1147.949	This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.
1153.655	That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year
1156.196	"called ""I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test."""
1159.266	(Laughter)
1161.345	The other thing The New Yorker plays around with
1163.283	is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,
1165.993	is sort of the basis of humor.
1167.581	Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.
1170.988	But the way incongruity works is, observational humor
1174.581	is humor within the realm of reality.
1177.003	"""My boss is always telling me what to do."" Okay?"
1182.481	That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.
1185.474	Here, cowboy to a cow:
1187.67	"""Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."""
1192.027	We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.
1195.703	Here, in the nonsense range:
1199.201	"""Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"""
1204.256	Now that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.
1208.599	In general, people who enjoy more nonsense,
1211.396	enjoy more abstract art,
1213.366	they tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.
1216.591	But for us, and for me, helping design the humor,
1220.256	it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.
1222.821	It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting.
1227.236	So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon,
1231.846	and I think this sums up the whole thing, really,
1234.606	about The New Yorker cartoons.
1236.972	"""It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it."""
1239.844	(Laughter)
1243.277	And now, when you look at New Yorker cartoons,
1245.559	I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them.
1247.739	Thank you.
1248.952	(Applause)
1252.589	Thank you. (Applause)
