15.585	What I'm going to show you
15.585	are the astonishing molecular machines
20.926	that create the living
20.926	fabric of your body.
24.25	Now molecules are really, really tiny.
28.057	And by tiny, I mean really.
31.905	They're smaller
31.905	than a wavelength of light,
33.931	so we have no way
33.931	to directly observe them.
37.011	But through science,
37.011	we do have a fairly good idea
39.378	of what's going on
39.378	down at the molecular scale.
42.059	So what we can do is actually
42.059	tell you about the molecules,
44.86	but we don't really have a direct way
44.86	of showing you the molecules.
48.121	One way around this is to draw pictures.
50.395	And this idea is actually nothing new.
52.959	Scientists have always created pictures
55.271	as part of their thinking
55.271	and discovery process.
58.081	They draw pictures
58.081	of what they're observing with their eyes,
60.98	through technology
60.98	like telescopes and microscopes,
63.396	and also what they're thinking
63.396	about in their minds.
65.859	I picked two well-known examples,
67.486	because they're very well-known
67.486	for expressing science through art.
71.44	And I start with Galileo,
71.44	who used the world's first telescope
75.167	to look at the Moon.
76.377	And he transformed
76.377	our understanding of the Moon.
78.708	The perception in the 17th century
80.365	was the Moon was a perfect
80.365	heavenly sphere.
82.835	But what Galileo saw
82.835	was a rocky, barren world,
85.843	which he expressed
85.843	through his watercolor painting.
88.671	Another scientist with very big ideas,
91.594	the superstar of biology
91.594	is Charles Darwin.
94.142	And with this famous entry
94.142	in his notebook,
96.21	he begins in the top left-hand
96.21	"corner with, ""I think,"""
99.074	and then sketches out
99.074	the first tree of life,
101.805	which is his perception
101.805	of how all the species,
104.759	all living things on Earth are connected
104.759	through evolutionary history --
108.641	the origin of species
108.641	through natural selection
110.912	and divergence
110.912	from an ancestral population.
113.775	Even as a scientist,
115.648	I used to go to lectures
115.648	by molecular biologists
118.185	and find them completely incomprehensible,
120.934	with all the fancy technical
120.934	language and jargon
123.226	that they would use
123.226	in describing their work,
125.374	until I encountered
125.374	the artworks of David Goodsell,
128.449	who is a molecular biologist
128.449	at the Scripps Institute.
131.214	And his pictures -- everything's accurate
131.214	and it's all to scale.
134.807	And his work illuminated for me
137.26	what the molecular world
137.26	inside us is like.
140.075	So this is a transection through blood.
142.124	In the top left-hand corner,
142.124	you've got this yellow-green area.
145.125	The yellow-green area is the fluid
145.125	of blood, which is mostly water,
148.365	but it's also antibodies, sugars,
148.365	hormones, that kind of thing.
151.376	And the red region is a slice
151.376	into a red blood cell.
153.888	And those red molecules are hemoglobin.
155.778	They are actually red;
155.778	that's what gives blood its color.
158.497	And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge
160.488	to soak up the oxygen in your lungs
162.189	and then carry it
162.189	to other parts of the body.
164.326	I was very much inspired
164.326	by this image many years ago,
166.882	and I wondered whether
166.882	we could use computer graphics
169.457	to represent the molecular world.
171.085	What would it look like?
172.26	And that's how I really began.
174.123	So let's begin.
175.76	This is DNA in its classic
175.76	double helix form.
178.169	And it's from X-ray crystallography,
178.169	so it's an accurate model of DNA.
181.549	If we unwind the double helix
181.549	and unzip the two strands,
184.544	you see these things that look like teeth.
186.587	Those are the letters of genetic code,
188.428	the 25,000 genes
188.428	you've got written in your DNA.
190.721	This is what they typically talk about --
190.721	the genetic code --
193.681	this is what they're talking about.
195.396	But I want to talk about
195.396	a different aspect of DNA science,
198.19	and that is the physical nature of DNA.
200.103	It's these two strands
200.103	that run in opposite directions
202.712	for reasons I can't go into right now.
204.906	But they physically run
204.906	in opposite directions,
207.138	which creates a number of complications
207.138	for your living cells,
210.793	as you're about to see,
212.046	most particularly
212.046	when DNA is being copied.
214.432	And so what I'm about to show you
216.374	is an accurate representation
216.374	of the actual DNA replication machine
220.414	that's occurring right now
220.414	inside your body,
222.495	at least 2002 biology.
224.617	So DNA's entering the production line
224.617	from the left-hand side,
227.994	and it hits this collection,
227.994	these miniature biochemical machines,
231.185	that are pulling apart the DNA strand
231.185	and making an exact copy.
234.353	So DNA comes in and hits this blue,
234.353	doughnut-shaped structure
237.886	and it's ripped apart
237.886	into its two strands.
240.679	One strand can be copied directly,
242.327	and you can see these things
242.327	spooling off to the bottom there.
245.274	But things aren't so simple
245.274	for the other strand
247.558	because it must be copied backwards.
249.347	So it's thrown out
249.347	repeatedly in these loops
251.481	and copied one section at a time,
251.481	creating two new DNA molecules.
255.549	Now you have billions of this machine
255.549	right now working away inside you,
260.856	copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.
263.936	It's an accurate representation,
265.494	and it's pretty much at the correct speed
265.494	for what is occurring inside you.
269.047	I've left out error correction
269.047	and a bunch of other things.
271.888	(Laughter)
273.671	This was work from a number of years ago--
275.816	Thank you.
277.009	(Applause)
278.405	This is work from a number of years ago,
280.358	but what I'll show you next
280.358	is updated science,
282.649	it's updated technology.
283.835	So again, we begin with DNA.
285.219	And it's jiggling and wiggling there
286.961	because of the surrounding
286.961	soup of molecules,
289.166	which I've stripped away
289.166	so you can see something.
291.573	DNA is about two nanometers across,
291.573	which is really quite tiny.
294.572	But in each one of your cells,
296.03	each strand of DNA is about
299.674	So to keep the DNA organized
299.674	and regulate access to the genetic code,
303.514	it's wrapped around these
303.514	purple proteins --
305.621	or I've labeled them purple here.
307.227	It's packaged up and bundled up.
308.835	All this field of view
308.835	is a single strand of DNA.
311.771	This huge package of DNA
311.771	is called a chromosome.
314.877	And we'll come back
314.877	to chromosomes in a minute.
317.675	We're pulling out, we're zooming out,
319.765	out through a nuclear pore,
321.26	which is the gateway to this compartment
321.26	that holds all the DNA,
324.944	called the nucleus.
326.917	All of this field of view
326.917	is about a semester's worth of biology,
331.172	and I've got seven minutes,
332.561	So we're not going to be
332.561	able to do that today?
335.273	"No, I'm being told, ""No."""
337.676	This is the way a living cell
337.676	looks down a light microscope.
341.065	And it's been filmed under time-lapse,
341.065	which is why you can see it moving.
344.587	The nuclear envelope breaks down.
346.192	These sausage-shaped things
346.192	are the chromosomes,
348.461	and we'll focus on them.
349.666	They go through this very striking motion
349.666	that is focused on these little red spots.
354.328	When the cell feels it's ready to go,
354.328	it rips apart the chromosome.
358.587	One set of DNA goes to one side,
360.652	the other side gets
360.652	the other set of DNA --
362.699	identical copies of DNA.
364.56	And then the cell splits down the middle.
366.544	And again, you have billions of cells
366.544	undergoing this process
369.427	right now inside of you.
371.602	Now we're going to rewind
371.602	and just focus on the chromosomes,
374.482	and look at its structure and describe it.
377.248	So again, here we are
377.248	at that equator moment.
380.654	The chromosomes line up.
381.878	And if we isolate just one chromosome,
383.729	we're going to pull it out
383.729	and have a look at its structure.
386.57	So this is one of the biggest
386.57	molecular structures that you have,
389.656	at least as far as we've discovered
389.656	so far inside of us.
393.286	So this is a single chromosome.
395.286	And you have two strands of DNA
395.286	in each chromosome.
397.911	One is bundled up into one sausage.
399.656	The other strand is bundled up
399.656	into the other sausage.
402.413	These things that look like whiskers
402.413	that are sticking out from either side
405.999	are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.
407.929	They're called microtubules,
407.929	that name's not important.
410.864	But we're going to focus on
410.864	the region labeled red here --
413.619	and it's the interface between
413.619	the dynamic scaffolding
416.18	and the chromosomes.
417.371	It is obviously central
417.371	to the movement of the chromosomes.
420.5	We have no idea, really,
420.5	as to how it's achieving that movement.
424.096	We've been studying this thing
424.096	they call the kinetochore
426.767	for over a hundred years
426.767	with intense study,
428.863	and we're still just beginning
428.863	to discover what it's about.
431.713	It is made up of about
434.491	thousands of proteins in total.
436.99	It is a signal broadcasting system.
439.834	It broadcasts through chemical signals,
442.022	telling the rest of the cell
442.022	when it's ready,
444.79	when it feels that everything
444.79	is aligned and ready to go
447.645	for the separation of the chromosomes.
449.647	It is able to couple onto the growing
449.647	and shrinking microtubules.
453.003	It's involved with the growing
453.003	of the microtubules,
456.226	and it's able to transiently
456.226	couple onto them.
459.359	It's also an attention-sensing system.
461.203	It's able to feel when the cell is ready,
463.203	when the chromosome
463.203	is correctly positioned.
465.461	It's turning green here because it feels
465.461	that everything is just right.
469.298	And you'll see,
469.298	there's this one little last bit
471.58	that's still remaining red.
473.037	And it's walked away
473.037	down the microtubules.
477.149	That is the signal broadcasting system
477.149	sending out the stop signal.
480.352	And it's walked away --
480.352	I mean, it's that mechanical.
483.072	It's molecular clockwork.
484.664	This is how you work
484.664	at the molecular scale.
487.869	So with a little bit
487.869	of molecular eye candy,
490.157	(Laughter)
491.379	we've got kinesins, the orange ones.
493.353	They're little molecular courier
493.353	molecules walking one way.
496.15	And here are the dynein,
496.15	they're carrying that broadcasting system.
499.32	And they've got their long legs
500.888	so they can step around
500.888	obstacles and so on.
502.978	So again, this is all derived
502.978	accurately from the science.
506.029	The problem is we can't show it
506.029	to you any other way.
508.603	Exploring at the frontier of science,
508.603	at the frontier of human understanding,
513.461	is mind-blowing.
515.974	Discovering this stuff
517.176	is certainly a pleasurable
517.176	incentive to work in science.
521.22	But most medical researchers --
523.901	discovering the stuff is simply steps
523.901	along the path to the big goals,
528.138	which are to eradicate disease,
528.138	to eliminate the suffering
532.583	and the misery that disease causes
534.682	and to lift people out of poverty.
536.386	Thank you.
537.682	(Applause)
