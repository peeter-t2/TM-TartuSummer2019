12.868	There's something that I'd like you to see.
16.473	(Video) Reporter: It's a story that's deeply unsettled
18.957	millions in China:
21.011	footage of a two-year-old girl
22.891	hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby,
27.443	footage too graphic to be shown.
30.683	The entire accident is caught on camera.
33.363	The driver pauses after hitting the child,
36.171	his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second.
40.083	Within two minutes, three people pass two-year-old Wang Yue by.
44.028	The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely.
47.712	Others look at her before moving off.
53.54	Peter Singer: There were other people
54.807	who walked past Wang Yue,
57.134	and a second van ran over her legs
58.853	before a street cleaner raised the alarm.
62.069	She was rushed to hospital, but it was too late. She died.
67.27	I wonder how many of you, looking at that,
71.078	"said to yourselves just now, ""I would not have done that."
74.761	"I would have stopped to help."""
76.965	Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you.
80.865	As I thought, that's most of you.
83.741	And I believe you. I'm sure you're right.
85.708	But before you give yourself too much credit,
88.947	look at this.
90.609	UNICEF reports that in 2011,
94.785	6.9 million children under five
98.734	died from preventable, poverty-related diseases.
104.186	UNICEF thinks that that's good news
106.448	because the figure has been steadily coming down
109.626	from 12 million in 1990. That is good.
113.679	But still, 6.9 million
116.783	is 19,000 children dying every day.
122.107	Does it really matter
124.893	that we're not walking past them in the street?
127.798	Does it really matter that they're far away?
133.016	I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference.
136.434	The fact that they're not right in front of us,
138.842	the fact, of course, that they're of a different nationality
141.003	or race, none of that seems morally relevant to me.
144.978	What is really important is,
146.498	can we reduce that death toll? Can we save
150.763	some of those 19,000 children dying every day?
155.729	And the answer is, yes we can.
159.347	Each of us spends money
161.89	on things that we do not really need.
164.071	You can think what your own habit is,
166.003	whether it's a new car, a vacation
168.568	or just something like buying bottled water
171.248	when the water that comes out of the tap
173.271	is perfectly safe to drink.
175.801	You could take the money you're spending
177.448	on those unnecessary things
179.343	and give it to this organization,
181.709	the Against Malaria Foundation,
184.636	which would take the money you had given
187.208	and use it to buy nets like this one
190.911	to protect children like this one,
194.45	and we know reliably that if we provide nets,
198.746	they're used, and they reduce the number of children
202.148	dying from malaria,
204.604	just one of the many preventable diseases
207.412	that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children
211.364	dying every day.
215.012	Fortunately, more and more people
217.196	are understanding this idea,
219.71	and the result is a growing movement:
223.028	effective altruism.
225.684	It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.
230.068	The heart, of course, you felt.
231.779	You felt the empathy for that child.
234.922	But it's really important to use the head as well
238.956	to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed,
243.749	and not only that, but also I think reason helps us
248.083	to understand that other people, wherever they are,
251.852	are like us, that they can suffer as we can,
255.443	that parents grieve for the deaths of their children,
258.116	as we do,
259.919	and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,
264.137	it matters just as much to all of these people.
267.38	So I think reason is not just some neutral tool
270.448	to help you get whatever you want.
271.943	It does help us to put perspective on our situation.
276.573	And I think that's why
278.452	many of the most significant people in effective altruism
283.458	have been people who have had backgrounds
285.842	in philosophy or economics or math.
290.58	And that might seem surprising,
292.045	because a lot of people think,
293.378	"""Philosophy is remote from the real world;"
297.191	economics, we're told, just makes us more selfish,
301.134	"and we know that math is for nerds."""
304.665	But in fact it does make a difference,
307.423	and in fact there's one particular nerd
309.359	who has been a particularly effective altruist
313.579	because he got this.
315.496	This is the website of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,
318.775	and if you look at the words on the top right-hand side,
322.571	"it says, ""All lives have equal value."""
326.498	That's the understanding,
328.367	the rational understanding of our situation in the world
331.989	that has led to these people
334.25	being the most effective altruists in history,
338.931	Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.
341.603	(Applause)
347.736	No one, not Andrew Carnegie, not John D. Rockefeller,
351.905	has ever given as much to charity
354.563	as each one of these three,
357.811	and they have used their intelligence
360.563	to make sure that it is highly effective.
364.643	According to one estimate, the Gates Foundation
367.731	has already saved 5.8 million lives
371.539	and many millions more, people, getting diseases
374.697	that would have made them very sick,
376.224	even if eventually they survived.
379.475	Over the coming years, undoubtably the Gates Foundation
382.075	is going to give a lot more,
384.739	is going to save a lot more lives.
388.714	Well, you might say, that's fine if you're a billionaire,
392.956	you can have that kind of impact.
395.38	But if I'm not, what can I do?
398.328	So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask
401.652	that maybe stand in the way of them giving.
405.1	They worry how much of a difference they can make.
407.467	But you don't have to be a billionaire.
410.692	This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy
414.356	at the University of Oxford.
416.382	He became an effective altruist when he calculated
419.97	that with the money that he was likely to earn
422.245	throughout his career, an academic career,
424.645	he could give enough to cure 80,000 people of blindness
431.312	in developing countries
433.358	and still have enough left
435.631	for a perfectly adequate standard of living.
440.355	So Toby founded an organization
442.352	called Giving What We Can to spread this information,
446.438	to unite people who want to share some of their income,
450.364	and to ask people to pledge to give 10 percent
453.077	of what they earn over their lifetime
455.188	to fighting global poverty.
458.509	Toby himself does better than that.
460.948	He's pledged to live on 18,000 pounds a year --
465.348	that's less than 30,000 dollars --
468.092	and to give the rest to those organizations.
471.492	And yes, Toby is married and he does have a mortgage.
477.066	This is a couple at a later stage of life,
480.711	Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott,
483.707	who, when they were young, when they met,
485.234	were activists against the Vietnam War,
488.388	fought for social justice,
490.367	and then moved into careers, as most people do,
493.251	didn't really do anything very active about those values,
496.86	although they didn't abandon them.
499.699	And then, as they got to the age at which many people
502.078	start to think of retirement, they returned to them,
505.484	and they've decided to cut back on their spending,
508.648	to live modestly, and to give both money and time
513.793	to helping to fight global poverty.
518.671	Now, mentioning time might lead you to think,
521.713	"""Well, should I abandon my career and put all of my time"
525.337	into saving some of these 19,000 lives
528.542	"that are lost every day?"""
530.205	One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue
532.907	of how you can have a career that will have
535.73	the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch.
539.451	He's a graduate student in philosophy,
542.107	and he's set up a website called 80,000 Hours,
546.459	the number of hours he estimates
548.133	most people spend on their career,
550.505	to advise people on how to have the best,
552.717	most effective career.
554.697	But you might be surprised to know
556.911	that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider,
559.932	if they have the right abilities and character,
562.197	is to go into banking or finance.
566.864	Why? Because if you earn a lot of money,
570.675	you can give away a lot of money,
573.014	and if you're successful in that career,
575.06	you could give enough to an aid organization
577.674	so that it could employ, let's say, five aid workers
582.604	in developing countries, and each one of them
585.896	would probably do about as much good
587.74	as you would have done.
589.274	So you can quintuple the impact
592.284	by leading that kind of career.
596.405	Here's one young man who's taken this advice.
598.925	His name is Matt Weiger.
600.266	He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math,
604.028	actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis
607.747	last year when he graduated.
610.126	But he's gone into finance in New York.
613.352	He's already earning enough
614.957	so that he's giving a six-figure sum to effective charities
619.223	and still leaving himself with enough to live on.
622.952	Matt has also helped me to set up an organization
626.823	that I'm working with that has the name taken
629.876	from the title of a book I wrote,
631.503	"""The Life You Can Save,"""
633.401	which is trying to change our culture
636.142	so that more people think that
639.875	if we're going to live an ethical life,
641.592	it's not enough just to follow the thou-shalt-nots
645.423	and not cheat, steal, maim, kill,
647.803	but that if we have enough, we have to share some of that
650.69	with people who have so little.
654.043	And the organization draws together people
656.822	of different generations,
658.506	like Holly Morgan, who's an undergraduate,
660.351	who's pledged to give 10 percent
661.868	of the little amount that she has,
663.817	and on the right, Ada Wan,
665.87	who has worked directly for the poor, but has now
668.597	gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give.
673.099	Many people will think, though,
674.624	that charities aren't really all that effective.
678.606	So let's talk about effectiveness.
680.399	Toby Ord is very concerned about this,
682.389	and he's calculated that some charities
685.276	are hundreds or even thousands of times
688.065	more effective than others,
690.123	so it's very important to find the effective ones.
692.959	Take, for example, providing a guide dog for a blind person.
697.99	That's a good thing to do, right?
700.802	Well, right, it is a good thing to do,
702.824	but you have to think what else you could do with the resources.
705.741	It costs about 40,000 dollars to train a guide dog
709.985	and train the recipient so that the guide dog
712.481	can be an effective help to a blind person.
715.865	It costs somewhere between 20 and 50 dollars
720.137	to cure a blind person in a developing country
723.143	if they have trachoma.
725.153	So you do the sums, and you get something like that.
728.224	You could provide one guide dog
729.97	for one blind American,
732.315	or you could cure between 400
735.191	and 2,000 people of blindness.
738.962	I think it's clear what's the better thing to do.
742.559	But if you want to look for effective charities,
746.074	this is a good website to go to.
748.306	GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities,
753.19	not just whether they're well-run,
755.155	and it's screened hundreds of charities
757.455	and currently is recommending only three,
760.754	of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one.
764.987	So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations,
767.61	thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can
770.62	both have a somewhat broader list,
772.986	but you can find effective organizations,
776.322	and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor.
780.498	I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website
783.074	looking at effective animal organizations.
786.506	That's another cause that I've been concerned about
788.51	all my life, the immense amount of suffering
791.114	that humans inflict
792.64	on literally tens of billions of animals every year.
796.897	So if you want to look for effective organizations
799.223	to reduce that suffering,
801.296	you can go to Effective Animal Activism.
804.297	And some effective altruists think it's very important
807.336	to make sure that our species survives at all.
811.093	So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction.
814.523	Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of
817.166	recently, when an asteroid passed close to our planet.
821.323	Possibly research could help us not only to predict
824.329	the path of asteroids that might collide with us,
826.3	but actually to deflect them.
829.092	So some people think that would be a good thing to give to.
831.756	There's many possibilities.
833.998	My final question is,
835.709	some people will think it's a burden to give.
838.74	I don't really believe it is.
840.373	I've enjoyed giving all of my life
842.553	since I was a graduate student.
843.871	It's been something fulfilling to me.
846.704	Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist.
849.135	He thinks that the life he's saving is his own.
852.509	And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression
856.436	until she got involved with effective altruism,
858.668	and now is one of the happiest people she knows.
862.214	I think one of the reasons for this
863.987	is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome
867.254	what I call the Sisyphus problem.
870.125	Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian,
873.318	condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder
876.341	up to the top of the hill.
878.02	Just as he gets there, the effort becomes too much,
881.07	the boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill,
884.311	he has to trudge back down to push it up again,
887.615	and the same thing happens again and again
890.034	for all eternity.
892.416	Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle,
895.431	where you work hard to get money,
898.113	you spend that money on consumer goods
900.358	which you hope you'll enjoy using?
903.93	But then the money's gone, you have to work hard
906.661	to get more, spend more, and to maintain
909.561	the same level of happiness, it's kind of a hedonic treadmill.
912.568	You never get off, and you never really feel satisfied.
915.934	Becoming an effective altruist gives you
918.926	that meaning and fulfillment.
920.416	It enables you to have a solid basis for self-esteem
924.607	on which you can feel your life was really worth living.
928.732	I'm going to conclude by telling you
931.288	about an email that I received
933.421	while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago.
938.345	It's from a man named Chris Croy, who I'd never heard of.
941.372	This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery.
945.791	Why was he recovering from surgery?
948.325	"The email began, ""Last Tuesday,"
951.882	I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger.
955.74	That started a kidney chain
957.825	"which enabled four people to receive kidneys."""
962.494	There's about 100 people each year in the U.S.
964.933	and more in other countries who do that.
967.651	I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say
969.815	that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did.
973.187	Well, I have to admit, I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that,
976.61	because I still have two kidneys.
982.872	But Chris went on to say that he didn't think
985.138	that what he'd done was all that amazing,
987.818	because he calculated that the number of life-years
991.325	that he had added to people, the extension of life,
993.873	was about the same that you could achieve
996.682	if you gave 5,000 dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation.
1002.518	And that did make me feel a little bit better,
1006.594	because I have given more than 5,000 dollars
1010.148	to the Against Malaria Foundation
1012.995	and to various other effective charities.
1017.898	So if you're feeling bad
1019.332	because you still have two kidneys as well,
1023.414	there's a way for you to get off the hook.
1026.048	Thank you.
1027.248	(Applause)
