13	I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule
17	from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.
23	I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history
26	of compassion and the golden rule.
28	So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,
33	and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy
35	as your average compassion talk.
37	I want to warn you about that.
40	So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.
44	The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.
47	And I think it's great that
49	the leaders of the religions of the world
52	are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles
57	that are integral to their faiths.
60	At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.
63	I think nature gave them a helping hand here.
67	I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule
72	are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.
75	But I'm also going to argue
77	that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,
81	you realize that just affirming compassion,
85	and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.
88	There's a lot of work to be done after that.
91	OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.
96	In the beginning, there was compassion,
99	and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,
102	but actually even before that.
104	I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,
108	even before there were homo sapiens,
111	feelings like compassion and love and sympathy
113	had earned their way into the gene pool,
117	and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.
120	It happened through a principle known as kin selection.
124	And the basic idea of kin selection is that,
130	if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,
133	and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,
137	then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes
142	underlying the compassion itself.
145	So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually
149	a gene's way of helping itself. OK.
153	I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.
157	I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.
160	This doesn't bother me so much,
162	that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion
166	is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.
168	Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection
171	is just that it means that this kind of compassion
175	is naturally deployed only within the family.
178	That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.
181	The bad news is that this kin selected compassion
184	is naturally confined to the family.
186	Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,
190	a second kind of evolutionary logic.
193	"Biologists call that ""reciprocal altruism."" OK."
196	And there, the basic idea is that
199	compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
207	Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion
212	as you may have heard in the past,
214	but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion
219	is ultimately self-serving too.
222	It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
224	It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.
229	And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.
235	I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,
241	you feel really bad.
243	But if you read in the newspaper
244	that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,
247	you can probably live with that.
249	That's just human nature.
251	So, it's another good news/bad news story.
253	It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family
255	by this kind of evolutionary logic.
257	The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.
262	So, there's still work to be done.
264	Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,
269	which I think is kind of good news,
271	which is that the way that this is played out in the human species,
275	it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
279	I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,
283	but you can go to a hunter gatherer society
287	that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,
290	no exposure to ethical philosophy,
292	and you'll find, if you spend time with these people,
294	that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,
297	and that bad deeds should be punished.
299	And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.
305	So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,
309	you treat other people well.
311	And it's good to treat other people well.
313	That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.
317	So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,
320	you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;
323	we still aren't to universal love,
325	and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,
330	it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.
335	I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,
339	but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?
342	So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.
346	Now, we have a rationale for that.
348	We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
353	None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.
357	We have the capacity to carve out exceptions,
360	put people in a special category.
362	And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison,
366	you have this impartial judiciary
369	determining who gets excluded from the golden rule --
373	that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions
377	about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,
380	is we use a much rougher and readier formula.
383	Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --
387	if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --
389	I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.
394	We all do that,
396	and you see it all over the world.
399	You see it in the Middle East:
402	people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.
405	They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,
407	"""Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things"
409	"that put them in a special category."""
411	The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,
414	but they impose one on Gaza, and they say,
416	"""Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves."""
419	So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.
427	And it's natural to do that.
430	So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us
433	is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.
439	It's not going to save the world.
441	Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.
446	Are you on the edges of your seats here?
449	Good, because before I tell you about that good news,
451	I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.
456	So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news
459	that may save the world.
462	It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.
465	It's just a quick introduction to game theory.
468	This won't hurt. Okay.
470	It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.
472	If you ask what kind of a situation
476	is conducive to people becoming friends and allies,
479	the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.
482	And if you ask what kind of situation
484	is conducive to people defining people as enemies,
486	it's a zero-sum situation.
488	So, what do those terms mean?
490	Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,
493	where there's a winner and a loser.
495	So, their fortunes add up to zero.
498	So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,
503	or good for them, bad for you.
505	Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.
508	Now, if you're playing doubles,
510	then the person on your side of the net
512	is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,
515	because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --
518	or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.
520	That's a non-zero-sum game.
522	And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
525	In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:
528	that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,
531	but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.
534	You both feel you've won.
536	In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.
539	It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.
542	So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.
549	And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,
553	about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,
556	by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels
562	where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation
565	with some of their friends or allies.
568	The deployment of the golden rule
570	most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.
573	So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness
575	are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule
579	to kind of work their magic.
581	With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.
583	Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.
587	And now I can admit that it might not too,
590	now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.
596	But it may. And the good news is that history
601	has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,
605	these webs that can be these channels for compassion.
609	You can go back all the way to the stone age:
612	technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing,
620	a lot of transportation and communication technologies --
623	has just inexorably made it so that more people
626	can be in more non-zero-sum relationships
629	with more and more people at greater and greater distances.
632	That's the story of civilization.
635	It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village
640	to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.
643	And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.
647	"You've probably heard the term ""interdependence"""
649	applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.
653	If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,
656	then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.
659	And you see this all the time in the modern world.
661	You saw it with the recent economic crash,
663	where bad things happen in the economy --
666	bad for everybody, for much of the world.
669	Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.
672	And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence
675	that this non-zero-sum kind of connection
678	can expand the moral compass.
681	I mean, if you look at the American attitudes
684	toward Japanese during World War II --
688	look at the depictions of Japanese
690	in the American media as just about subhuman,
692	and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,
694	really without giving it much of a thought --
697	and you compare that to the attitude now,
699	I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.
702	Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship
705	forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.
708	So, I think that's good.
710	And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.
713	Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.
717	And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.
722	For example, probably a lot of American Christians
726	don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship
730	with Muslims halfway around the world,
732	but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier
737	with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,
740	that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists
743	to threaten American security.
745	If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.
749	So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.
752	And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,
757	why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?
761	The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.
764	Certainly, a couple of things are that,
768	first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.
772	And also, sometimes people don't recognize
776	the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.
781	In both of these areas,
783	I think politicians can play a role.
786	This isn't only about religion.
788	I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,
793	Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,
796	in this regard.
798	And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,
801	when people around the world are looking at them,
803	are looking at their nation
805	and picking up their cues
807	for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation --
811	like, say, America, or any other nation --
814	human psychology is such that they use cues like:
817	Do we feel we're being respected?
819	Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,
822	you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,
825	mutually profitable relationship with people.
828	So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.
833	And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.
838	If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,
840	politicians, religious leaders, and us,
843	"it would be what I call ""expanding the moral imagination"" --"
848	that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes
851	of people in very different circumstances.
854	This is not the same as compassion,
856	but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.
862	And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,
865	which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.
868	That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.
873	Once we define somebody as an enemy,
875	we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.
880	So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:
884	somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.
888	Well, the average American is going to resist
891	the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head
895	and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.
898	"And if you tell them, ""Well, they think America disrespects them"
902	and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.
905	Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much
907	"that you kind of hated them briefly""?"
909	You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.
912	And, similarly, the person in Iran:
914	when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,
918	they'll have trouble with that.
920	So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination
925	to a place it doesn't naturally go.
928	I think it's worth the trouble because,
931	again, it just helps us to understand.
933	If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,
935	it helps to understand what makes them do it.
937	And I think it's good moral exercise.
940	I would say here is where religious leaders come in,
943	because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,
950	at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain
952	to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.
957	I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.
961	It's their great calling right now,
963	to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,
967	appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.
971	I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,
977	as far as compassion and the golden rule go,
981	by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule
987	are in some sense built into human nature.
992	It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.
997	And it's going to take real work to change that.
1001	But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.
1006	(Applause)
