12.588	I'm a computer science professor,
15.619	and my area of expertise is
17.932	computer and information security.
20.131	When I was in graduate school,
22.451	I had the opportunity to overhear my grandmother
25.052	describing to one of her fellow senior citizens
29.186	what I did for a living.
31.555	Apparently, I was in charge of making sure that
35.117	no one stole the computers from the university. (Laughter)
39.017	And, you know, that's a perfectly reasonable thing
41.761	for her to think, because I told her I was working
43.681	in computer security,
45.188	and it was interesting to get her perspective.
48.785	But that's not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard
51.402	anyone say about my work.
53.419	The most ridiculous thing I ever heard is,
55.703	I was at a dinner party, and a woman heard
58.837	that I work in computer security,
60.62	and she asked me if -- she said her computer had been
64.137	infected by a virus, and she was very concerned that she
67.573	might get sick from it, that she could get this virus. (Laughter)
71.524	And I'm not a doctor, but I reassured her
74.467	that it was very, very unlikely that this would happen,
77.611	but if she felt more comfortable, she could be free to use
80.412	latex gloves when she was on the computer,
82.26	and there would be no harm whatsoever in that.
85.652	I'm going to get back to this notion of being able to get
88.159	a virus from your computer, in a serious way.
91.667	What I'm going to talk to you about today
93.307	are some hacks, some real world cyberattacks that people
98.153	in my community, the academic research community,
100.707	have performed, which I don't think
103.501	most people know about,
104.709	and I think they're very interesting and scary,
107.737	and this talk is kind of a greatest hits
110.178	of the academic security community's hacks.
113.169	None of the work is my work. It's all work
115.156	that my colleagues have done, and I actually asked them
117.33	for their slides and incorporated them into this talk.
119.887	So the first one I'm going to talk about
121.629	are implanted medical devices.
124.303	Now medical devices have come a long way technologically.
127.343	You can see in 1926 the first pacemaker was invented.
134.751	hopefully a little smaller than that one that you see there,
137.303	and the technology has continued to move forward.
140.271	In 2006, we hit an important milestone from the perspective
144.904	of computer security.
148.071	And why do I say that?
149.412	Because that's when implanted devices inside of people
152.302	started to have networking capabilities.
155.047	One thing that brings us close to home is we look
156.927	at Dick Cheney's device, he had a device that
159.632	pumped blood from an aorta to another part of the heart,
163.501	and as you can see at the bottom there,
164.684	it was controlled by a computer controller,
167.693	and if you ever thought that software liability
170.21	was very important, get one of these inside of you.
173.799	Now what a research team did was they got their hands
177.494	on what's called an ICD.
178.914	This is a defibrillator, and this is a device
180.984	that goes into a person to control their heart rhythm,
185.32	and these have saved many lives.
187.658	Well, in order to not have to open up the person
190.13	every time you want to reprogram their device
192.324	or do some diagnostics on it, they made the thing be able
194.779	to communicate wirelessly, and what this research team did
197.881	is they reverse engineered the wireless protocol,
200.491	and they built the device you see pictured here,
202.363	with a little antenna, that could talk the protocol
205.123	to the device, and thus control it.
209.598	In order to make their experience real -- they were unable
212.287	to find any volunteers, and so they went
214.759	and they got some ground beef and some bacon
216.903	and they wrapped it all up to about the size
218.691	of a human being's area where the device would go,
221.489	and they stuck the device inside it
222.943	to perform their experiment somewhat realistically.
226.075	They launched many, many successful attacks.
229.095	One that I'll highlight here is changing the patient's name.
232.151	I don't know why you would want to do that,
233.144	but I sure wouldn't want that done to me.
235.248	And they were able to change therapies,
237.579	including disabling the device -- and this is with a real,
240.074	commercial, off-the-shelf device --
241.97	simply by performing reverse engineering and sending
244.016	wireless signals to it.
247.005	There was a piece on NPR that some of these ICDs
250.585	could actually have their performance disrupted
253.007	simply by holding a pair of headphones onto them.
256.658	Now, wireless and the Internet
258.067	can improve health care greatly.
259.719	There's several examples up on the screen
261.806	of situations where doctors are looking to implant devices
264.913	inside of people, and all of these devices now,
267.778	it's standard that they communicate wirelessly,
270.903	and I think this is great,
272.315	but without a full understanding of trustworthy computing,
275.42	and without understanding what attackers can do
277.827	and the security risks from the beginning,
279.974	there's a lot of danger in this.
282.364	Okay, let me shift gears and show you another target.
283.841	I'm going to show you a few different targets like this,
285.929	and that's my talk. So we'll look at automobiles.
288.846	This is a car, and it has a lot of components,
291.742	a lot of electronics in it today.
293.362	In fact, it's got many, many different computers inside of it,
297.739	more Pentiums than my lab did when I was in college,
300.894	and they're connected by a wired network.
304.533	There's also a wireless network in the car,
307.964	which can be reached from many different ways.
311.197	So there's Bluetooth, there's the FM and XM radio,
314.898	there's actually wi-fi, there's sensors in the wheels
317.718	that wirelessly communicate the tire pressure
319.871	to a controller on board.
321.677	The modern car is a sophisticated multi-computer device.
326.595	And what happens if somebody wanted to attack this?
329.917	Well, that's what the researchers
331.234	that I'm going to talk about today did.
333.105	They basically stuck an attacker on the wired network
336.082	and on the wireless network.
338.404	Now, they have two areas they can attack.
341.103	One is short-range wireless, where you can actually
343.141	communicate with the device from nearby,
344.922	either through Bluetooth or wi-fi,
347.059	and the other is long-range, where you can communicate
349.233	with the car through the cellular network,
351.015	or through one of the radio stations.
352.975	Think about it. When a car receives a radio signal,
356.024	it's processed by software.
358.225	That software has to receive and decode the radio signal,
361.286	and then figure out what to do with it,
362.405	even if it's just music that it needs to play on the radio,
365.429	and that software that does that decoding,
367.697	if it has any bugs in it, could create a vulnerability
370.79	for somebody to hack the car.
373.825	The way that the researchers did this work is,
376.777	they read the software in the computer chips
381	that were in the car, and then they used sophisticated
384.193	reverse engineering tools
385.607	to figure out what that software did,
387.662	and then they found vulnerabilities in that software,
390.703	and then they built exploits to exploit those.
394.049	They actually carried out their attack in real life.
396.431	They bought two cars, and I guess
397.781	they have better budgets than I do.
400.699	The first threat model was to see what someone could do
403.289	if an attacker actually got access
405.433	to the internal network on the car.
407.486	Okay, so think of that as, someone gets to go to your car,
410.089	they get to mess around with it, and then they leave,
412.993	and now, what kind of trouble are you in?
415.361	The other threat model is that they contact you
418.153	in real time over one of the wireless networks
420.61	like the cellular, or something like that,
422.665	never having actually gotten physical access to your car.
426.665	This is what their setup looks like for the first model,
429.489	where you get to have access to the car.
431.172	They put a laptop, and they connected to the diagnostic unit
434.559	on the in-car network, and they did all kinds of silly things,
437.498	like here's a picture of the speedometer
440.281	showing 140 miles an hour when the car's in park.
443.097	Once you have control of the car's computers,
445.47	you can do anything.
446.389	"Now you might say, ""Okay, that's silly."""
448.005	Well, what if you make the car always say
449.664	it's going 20 miles an hour slower than it's actually going?
452.405	You might produce a lot of speeding tickets.
454.947	Then they went out to an abandoned airstrip with two cars,
458.803	the target victim car and the chase car,
461.548	and they launched a bunch of other attacks.
464.294	One of the things they were able to do from the chase car
467.06	is apply the brakes on the other car,
469.034	simply by hacking the computer.
470.594	They were able to disable the brakes.
473.025	They also were able to install malware that wouldn't kick in
476.203	and wouldn't trigger until the car was doing something like
478.628	going over 20 miles an hour, or something like that.
482.374	The results are astonishing, and when they gave this talk,
485.132	even though they gave this talk at a conference
486.848	to a bunch of computer security researchers,
488.574	everybody was gasping.
490.274	They were able to take over a bunch of critical computers
493.973	inside the car: the brakes computer, the lighting computer,
497.734	the engine, the dash, the radio, etc.,
500.561	and they were able to perform these on real commercial
502.854	cars that they purchased using the radio network.
505.881	They were able to compromise every single one of the
508.884	pieces of software that controlled every single one
511.35	of the wireless capabilities of the car.
514.365	All of these were implemented successfully.
516.878	How would you steal a car in this model?
519.23	Well, you compromise the car by a buffer overflow
522.91	of vulnerability in the software, something like that.
525.437	You use the GPS in the car to locate it.
527.64	You remotely unlock the doors through the computer
529.835	that controls that, start the engine, bypass anti-theft,
532.973	and you've got yourself a car.
534.641	Surveillance was really interesting.
537.128	The authors of the study have a video where they show
540.337	themselves taking over a car and then turning on
542.886	the microphone in the car, and listening in on the car
545.647	while tracking it via GPS on a map,
548.998	and so that's something that the drivers of the car
550.711	would never know was happening.
552.879	Am I scaring you yet?
555.013	I've got a few more of these interesting ones.
556.956	These are ones where I went to a conference,
558.789	and my mind was just blown, and I said,
560.722	"""I have to share this with other people."""
562.548	This was Fabian Monrose's lab
564.171	at the University of North Carolina, and what they did was
567.627	something intuitive once you see it,
569.702	but kind of surprising.
571.416	They videotaped people on a bus,
573.675	and then they post-processed the video.
576.515	What you see here in number one is a
578.978	reflection in somebody's glasses of the smartphone
583.361	that they're typing in.
584.786	They wrote software to stabilize --
586.761	even though they were on a bus
588.126	and maybe someone's holding their phone at an angle --
591.337	to stabilize the phone, process it, and
593.707	you may know on your smartphone, when you type
595.592	a password, the keys pop out a little bit, and they were able
598.531	to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing,
601.371	and had a language model for detecting typing.
605.692	What was interesting is, by videotaping on a bus,
608.027	they were able to produce exactly what people
610.156	on their smartphones were typing,
612.307	and then they had a surprising result, which is that
614.567	their software had not only done it for their target,
617.331	but other people who accidentally happened
618.734	to be in the picture, they were able to produce
620.82	what those people had been typing, and that was kind of
623.547	an accidental artifact of what their software was doing.
627.164	I'll show you two more. One is P25 radios.
631.467	P25 radios are used by law enforcement
634.267	and all kinds of government agencies
637.674	and people in combat to communicate,
639.41	and there's an encryption option on these phones.
642.243	This is what the phone looks like. It's not really a phone.
644.971	It's more of a two-way radio.
646.177	Motorola makes the most widely used one, and you can see
649.499	that they're used by Secret Service, they're used in combat,
652.148	it's a very, very common standard in the U.S. and elsewhere.
655.25	So one question the researchers asked themselves is,
657.555	could you block this thing, right?
660.259	Could you run a denial-of-service,
661.842	because these are first responders?
663.666	So, would a terrorist organization want to black out the
665.467	ability of police and fire to communicate at an emergency?
669.955	They found that there's this GirlTech device used for texting
673.027	that happens to operate at the same exact frequency
675.745	as the P25, and they built what they called
678.016	My First Jammer. (Laughter)
682.35	If you look closely at this device,
684.728	it's got a switch for encryption or cleartext.
688.358	Let me advance the slide, and now I'll go back.
691.408	You see the difference?
693.955	This is plain text. This is encrypted.
696.512	There's one little dot that shows up on the screen,
699.069	and one little tiny turn of the switch.
701.154	"And so the researchers asked themselves, ""I wonder how"
703.058	many times very secure, important, sensitive conversations
707.315	are happening on these two-way radios where they forget
708.938	"to encrypt and they don't notice that they didn't encrypt?"""
711.848	So they bought a scanner. These are perfectly legal
715.187	and they run at the frequency of the P25,
718.645	and what they did is they hopped around frequencies
720.412	and they wrote software to listen in.
722.922	If they found encrypted communication, they stayed
725.556	on that channel and they wrote down, that's a channel
727.242	that these people communicate in,
729.03	these law enforcement agencies,
730.652	and they went to 20 metropolitan areas and listened in
734.043	on conversations that were happening at those frequencies.
737.518	They found that in every metropolitan area,
740.757	they would capture over 20 minutes a day
742.911	of cleartext communication.
745.286	And what kind of things were people talking about?
747.286	Well, they found the names and information
748.77	about confidential informants. They found information
751.622	that was being recorded in wiretaps,
753.824	a bunch of crimes that were being discussed,
756.534	sensitive information.
757.696	It was mostly law enforcement and criminal.
761.059	They went and reported this to the law enforcement
762.893	agencies, after anonymizing it,
764.916	and the vulnerability here is simply the user interface
767.916	wasn't good enough. If you're talking
769.31	about something really secure and sensitive, it should
772.126	be really clear to you that this conversation is encrypted.
775.419	That one's pretty easy to fix.
777.305	The last one I thought was really, really cool,
778.974	and I just had to show it to you, it's probably not something
781.787	that you're going to lose sleep over
782.792	like the cars or the defibrillators,
784.583	but it's stealing keystrokes.
787.606	Now, we've all looked at smartphones upside down.
790.353	Every security expert wants to hack a smartphone,
792.543	and we tend to look at the USB port, the GPS for tracking,
797.155	the camera, the microphone, but no one up till this point
800.363	had looked at the accelerometer.
801.943	The accelerometer is the thing that determines
803.59	the vertical orientation of the smartphone.
807.084	And so they had a simple setup.
808.501	They put a smartphone next to a keyboard,
811.259	and they had people type, and then their goal was
813.971	to use the vibrations that were created by typing
816.827	to measure the change in the accelerometer reading
821.067	to determine what the person had been typing.
824.243	Now, when they tried this on an iPhone 3GS,
826.819	this is a graph of the perturbations that were created
829.588	by the typing, and you can see that it's very difficult
832.829	to tell when somebody was typing or what they were typing,
835.907	but the iPhone 4 greatly improved the accelerometer,
838.997	and so the same measurement
842.477	produced this graph.
844.309	Now that gave you a lot of information while someone
846.795	was typing, and what they did then is used advanced
850.036	artificial intelligence techniques called machine learning
853.043	to have a training phase,
854.474	and so they got most likely grad students
856.71	to type in a whole lot of things, and to learn,
860.499	to have the system use the machine learning tools that
863.267	were available to learn what it is that the people were typing
866.13	and to match that up
868.957	with the measurements in the accelerometer.
871.434	And then there's the attack phase, where you get
873.069	somebody to type something in, you don't know what it was,
875.88	but you use your model that you created
877.177	in the training phase to figure out what they were typing.
880.619	They had pretty good success. This is an article from the USA Today.
884.103	"They typed in, ""The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled"
886.712	"that Rahm Emanuel is eligible to run for Mayor of Chicago"""
889.674	— see, I tied it in to the last talk —
891.028	"""and ordered him to stay on the ballot."""
893.146	Now, the system is interesting, because it produced
895.917	"""Illinois Supreme"" and then it wasn't sure."
898.803	The model produced a bunch of options,
900.753	and this is the beauty of some of the A.I. techniques,
903.462	is that computers are good at some things,
905.712	humans are good at other things,
907.246	take the best of both and let the humans solve this one.
909.177	Don't waste computer cycles.
910.559	A human's not going to think it's the Supreme might.
912.695	It's the Supreme Court, right?
914.435	And so, together we're able to reproduce typing
916.965	simply by measuring the accelerometer.
919.914	Why does this matter? Well, in the Android platform,
923.416	for example, the developers have a manifest
927.564	where every device on there, the microphone, etc.,
930.148	has to register if you're going to use it
932.104	so that hackers can't take over it,
934.42	but nobody controls the accelerometer.
937.528	So what's the point? You can leave your iPhone next to
939.744	someone's keyboard, and just leave the room,
941.85	and then later recover what they did,
943.489	even without using the microphone.
945.2	If someone is able to put malware on your iPhone,
947.374	they could then maybe get the typing that you do
950.222	whenever you put your iPhone next to your keyboard.
952.543	There's several other notable attacks that unfortunately
954.814	I don't have time to go into, but the one that I wanted
956.945	to point out was a group from the University of Michigan
959.222	which was able to take voting machines,
961.663	the Sequoia AVC Edge DREs that
964.161	were going to be used in New Jersey in the election
965.716	that were left in a hallway, and put Pac-Man on it.
967.877	So they ran the Pac-Man game.
971.5	What does this all mean?
973.247	Well, I think that society tends to adopt technology
976.894	really quickly. I love the next coolest gadget.
979.718	But it's very important, and these researchers are showing,
982.332	that the developers of these things
983.692	need to take security into account from the very beginning,
986.557	and need to realize that they may have a threat model,
989.342	but the attackers may not be nice enough
991.804	to limit themselves to that threat model,
993.581	and so you need to think outside of the box.
996.118	What we can do is be aware
997.696	that devices can be compromised,
1000.175	and anything that has software in it
1001.874	is going to be vulnerable. It's going to have bugs.
1004.523	Thank you very much. (Applause)
