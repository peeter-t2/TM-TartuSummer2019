13.506	I feel so fortunate that my first job
15.708	was working at the Museum of Modern Art
18.14	on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray.
21.594	I learned so much from her.
23.98	After the curator Robert Storr
25.748	selected all the paintings
27.267	from her lifetime body of work,
30.019	I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s.
33.661	There were some motifs and elements
36.217	that would come up again later in her life.
39.723	I remember asking her
41.362	what she thought of those early works.
43.92	If you didn't know they were hers,
45.384	you might not have been able to guess.
47.954	She told me that a few didn't quite meet
50.877	her own mark for what she wanted them to be.
54.484	One of the works, in fact,
55.913	so didn't meet her mark,
57.434	she had set it out in the trash in her studio,
60.406	and her neighbor had taken it
62.247	because she saw its value.
64.817	In that moment, my view of success
67.766	and creativity changed.
70.282	I realized that success is a moment,
73.17	but what we're always celebrating
75.106	is creativity and mastery.
79.114	But this is the thing: What gets us to convert success
82.751	into mastery?
84.98	This is a question I've long asked myself.
87.771	I think it comes when we start to value
90.352	the gift of a near win.
93.944	I started to understand this when I went
96.139	on one cold May day
98.122	to watch a set of varsity archers,
100.673	all women as fate would have it,
102.97	at the northern tip of Manhattan
105.05	at Columbia's Baker Athletics Complex.
108.469	I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox,
112.138	the idea that in order to actually hit your target,
114.969	you have to aim at something slightly skew from it.
119.411	I stood and watched as the coach
121.404	drove up these women in this gray van,
124.118	and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus.
127.096	One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand
129.99	and arrows in the left with yellow fletching.
132.507	And they passed me and smiled,
135.19	but they sized me up as they
136.99	made their way to the turf,
138.609	and spoke to each other not with words
140.363	but with numbers, degrees, I thought,
143.08	positions for how they might plan
144.378	to hit their target.
146.911	I stood behind one archer as her coach
149.294	stood in between us to maybe assess
151.316	who might need support, and watched her,
153.773	and I didn't understand how even one
155.86	was going to hit the ten ring.
158.711	The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance,
161.359	it looks as small as a matchstick tip
164.269	held out at arm's length.
166.366	And this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight
169.645	on each shot.
172.352	She first hit a seven, I remember, and then a nine,
175.044	and then two tens,
176.324	and then the next arrow
177.56	didn't even hit the target.
179.779	And I saw that gave her more tenacity,
181.78	and she went after it again and again.
184.566	For three hours this went on.
187.512	At the end of the practice, one of the archers
189.933	was so taxed that she lied out on the ground
192.519	just star-fished,
194.46	her head looking up at the sky,
196.492	trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call
199.104	that still point of the turning world.
202.99	It's so rare in American culture,
205.005	there's so little that's vocational about it anymore,
208.015	to look at what doggedness looks like
210.609	with this level of exactitude,
212.72	what it means to align your body posture
215.101	for three hours in order to hit a target,
218.468	pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity.
222.538	But I stayed because I realized I was witnessing
224.763	what's so rare to glimpse,
227.098	that difference between success and mastery.
230.971	So success is hitting that ten ring,
233.595	but mastery is knowing that it means nothing
235.711	if you can't do it again and again.
239.267	Mastery is not just the same as excellence, though.
242.988	It's not the same as success,
244.821	which I see as an event,
247.054	a moment in time,
248.64	and a label that the world confers upon you.
251.938	Mastery is not a commitment to a goal
255.072	but to a constant pursuit.
257.977	What gets us to do this,
259.854	what get us to forward thrust more
262.4	is to value the near win.
266.057	How many times have we designated something
268.209	a classic, a masterpiece even,
271.08	while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished,
274.658	riddled with difficulties and flaws,
276.881	in other words, a near win?
279.899	Elizabeth Murray surprised me
281.793	with her admission about her earlier paintings.
285.013	Painter Paul Cézanne so often
285.013	thought his works were incomplete
288.665	that he would deliberately leave them aside
290.487	with the intention of picking them back up again,
293.037	but at the end of his life,
294.78	the result was that he had only signed
299.735	"His favorite novel was ""The [Unknown]"
299.735	"Masterpiece"" by Honoré de Balzac,"
303.885	and he felt the protagonist was the painter himself.
309.481	Franz Kafka saw incompletion
311.415	when others would find only works to praise,
314.666	so much so that he wanted all of his diaries,
317.099	manuscripts, letters and even sketches
319.196	burned upon his death.
321.525	His friend refused to honor the request,
324.32	and because of that, we now have all the works
325.998	we now do by Kafka:
327.767	"""America,"" ""The Trial"" and ""The Castle,"""
331.16	a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence.
334.785	The pursuit of mastery, in other words,
337.32	is an ever-onward almost.
341.958	"""Lord, grant that I desire"
343.934	"more than I can accomplish,"""
346.01	Michelangelo implored,
347.569	as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel,
351	and he himself was that Adam
352.949	with his finger outstretched
354.455	and not quite touching that God's hand.
359.028	Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving.
363.616	It's in constantly wanting to close that gap
366.921	between where you are and where you want to be.
371.119	Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft
374.707	and not for the sake of crafting your career.
378.925	How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs
381.59	live out this phenomenon?
384.359	We see it even in the life
385.864	of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders,
388.674	who tells me that his triumphs
390.348	are not merely the result
392.271	of a grand achievement,
394.066	but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.
399.06	We thrive when we stay at our own leading edge.
402.796	It's a wisdom understood by Duke Ellington,
405.491	who said that his favorite song out of his repertoire
408.417	was always the next one,
410.552	always the one he had yet to compose.
414.211	Part of the reason that the near win
416.34	is inbuilt to mastery
418.632	is because the greater our proficiency,
420.985	the more clearly we might see
423.145	that we don't know all that we thought we did.
426.363	It's called the Dunning–Kruger effect.
428.994	The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin
431.921	when they asked him,
432.949	"""What do you think increases with knowledge?"""
435.646	"and he said, ""You learn how little you know."""
440.328	Success motivates us, but a near win
442.652	can propel us in an ongoing quest.
445.527	One of the most vivid examples of this comes
447.646	when we look at the difference
449.436	between Olympic silver medalists
451.382	and bronze medalists after a competition.
454.333	Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell
456.946	studied this difference and found
459.092	that the frustration silver medalists feel
461.616	compared to bronze, who are typically a bit
463.577	more happy to have just not received fourth place
466.05	and not medaled at all,
467.729	gives silver medalists a focus
469.684	on follow-up competition.
472.107	We see it even in the gambling industry
474.389	that once picked up on this phenomenon
476.375	of the near win
477.867	and created these scratch-off tickets
480.13	that had a higher than average rate of near wins
483.458	and so compelled people to buy more tickets
486.267	that they were called heart-stoppers,
488.216	and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses
491.279	in Britain in the 1970s.
494.67	The reason the near win has a propulsion
496.919	is because it changes our view of the landscape
499.803	and puts our goals, which we tend to put
502.454	at a distance, into more proximate vicinity
505.059	to where we stand.
506.905	If I ask you to envision what a
506.905	great day looks like next week,
510.083	you might describe it in more general terms.
513.788	But if I ask you to describe a
513.788	great day at TED tomorrow,
517.439	you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.
520.9	And this is what a near win does.
522.563	It gets us to focus on what, right now,
525.109	we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.
529.89	It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984
533.046	missed taking the gold in the heptathlon
535.052	by one third of a second,
537.313	and her husband predicted that would give her
539.194	the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition.
543.156	In 1988, she won the gold in the heptathlon
546.528	and set a record of 7,291 points,
550.703	a score that no athlete has come very close to since.
555.81	We thrive not when we've done it all,
558.521	but when we still have more to do.
561.928	I stand here thinking and wondering
564.01	about all the different ways
565.708	that we might even manufacture a near win
568.105	in this room,
569.37	how your lives might play this out,
571.439	because I think on some gut level we do know this.
576.23	We know that we thrive when we stay
577.982	at our own leading edge,
579.499	and it's why the deliberate incomplete
581.965	is inbuilt into creation myths.
584.458	In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women
586.98	would deliberately put an imperfection
589.423	in textiles and ceramics.
591.07	It's what's called a spirit line,
593.861	a deliberate flaw in the pattern
595.97	to give the weaver or maker a way out,
598.998	but also a reason to continue making work.
603.67	Masters are not experts because they take
605.447	a subject to its conceptual end.
608.065	They're masters because they realize
609.774	that there isn't one.
612.352	Now it occurred to me, as I thought about this,
615.462	why the archery coach
617.25	told me at the end of that practice,
619.42	out of earshot of his archers,
621.665	that he and his colleagues never feel
623.642	they can do enough for their team,
625.902	never feel there are enough visualization techniques
628.779	and posture drills to help them overcome
631.566	those constant near wins.
633.846	It didn't sound like a complaint, exactly,
636.293	but just a way to let me know,
638.886	a kind of tender admission,
640.366	to remind me that he knew
640.366	he was giving himself over
643.631	to a voracious, unfinished path
646.786	that always required more.
649.711	We build out of the unfinished idea,
652.86	even if that idea is our former self.
657.316	This is the dynamic of mastery.
660.331	Coming close to what you thought you wanted
663.364	can help you attain more than you ever dreamed
666.09	you could.
667.701	It's what I have to imagine Elizabeth Murray
670.575	was thinking when I saw her smiling
672.59	at those early paintings one day
674.851	in the galleries.
677.922	Even if we created utopias, I believe
680.288	we would still have the incomplete.
683.59	Completion is a goal,
685.754	but we hope it is never the end.
689.747	Thank you.
692.528	(Applause)
