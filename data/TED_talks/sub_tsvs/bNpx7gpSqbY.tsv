12.961	I'm really excited to share with you
14.944	some findings that really surprise me
17.534	about what makes companies 
17.534	succeed the most,
20.085	what factors actually matter the most
20.085	for startup success.
25.063	I believe that the startup organization
27.212	is one of the greatest forms
27.212	to make the world a better place.
31.63	If you take a group of people 
31.63	with the right equity incentives
34.756	and organize them in a startup,
36.635	you can unlock human potential
36.635	in a way never before possible.
40.609	You get them to achieve 
40.609	unbelievable things.
43.679	But if the startup 
43.679	organization is so great,
45.799	why do so many fail?
47.281	That's what I wanted to find out.
48.878	I wanted to find out what
48.878	actually matters most
51.363	for startup success.
52.573	And I wanted to try 
52.573	to be systematic about it,
54.782	avoid some of my instincts
54.782	and maybe misperceptions I have
57.935	from so many companies
57.935	I've seen over the years.
60.201	I wanted to know this
61.428	because I've been starting businesses
61.428	since I was 12 years old
64.476	when I sold candy at the bus stop
64.476	in junior high school,
67.131	to high school, when I made
67.131	solar energy devices,
69.442	to college, when I made loudspeakers.
71.229	And when I graduated from college,
71.229	I started software companies.
74.255	And 20 years ago,
74.255	I started Idealab,
76.064	and in the last 20 years,
76.064	we started more than 100 companies,
79.305	many successes, and many big failures.
81.629	We learned a lot from those failures.
83.988	So I tried to look across what factors
86.735	accounted the most for company
86.735	success and failure.
89.898	So I looked at these five.
91.458	First, the idea.
92.418	I used to think that 
92.418	the idea was everything.
94.574	I named my company Idealab
94.574	for how much I worship
96.881	"the ""aha!"" moment when you first"
96.881	come up with the idea.
99.474	But then over time,
100.385	I came to think that maybe the team,
100.385	the execution, adaptability,
103.97	that mattered even more than the idea.
106.121	I never thought I'd be quoting
106.121	boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,
110.483	but he once said,
112.342	"""Everybody has a plan, until they get"
112.342	"punched in the face."" (Laughter)"
116.945	And I think that's so true
116.945	about business as well.
119.864	So much about a team's execution
122.14	is its ability to adapt to getting punched
122.14	in the face by the customer.
125.9	The customer is the true reality.
127.588	And that's why I came to think
129.039	that the team maybe
129.039	was the most important thing.
132.036	Then I started looking
132.036	at the business model.
134.148	Does the company have a very clear path
134.148	generating customer revenues?
137.398	That started rising to the top
137.398	in my thinking
139.502	about maybe what mattered
139.502	most for success.
141.819	Then I looked at the funding.
143.216	Sometimes companies received
143.216	intense amounts of funding.
145.916	Maybe that's the most important thing?
147.754	And then of course,
147.754	the timing.
149.3	Is the idea way too early and
149.3	the world's not ready for it?
152.11	Is it early, as in, you're in advance
152.11	and you have to educate the world?
155.557	Is it just right?
156.366	Or is it too late, and there's
156.366	already too many competitors?
159.229	So I tried to look very carefully
159.229	at these five factors
161.818	across many companies.
162.869	And I looked across all 100
162.869	Idealab companies,
165.064	and 100 non-Idealab companies
166.518	to try and come up with 
166.518	something scientific about it.
169.574	So first, on these Idealab companies,
171.899	the top five companies --
173.772	Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo,
173.772	NetZero, Tickets.com --
177.188	those all became billion-dollar successes.
179.262	And the five companies on the bottom --
181.175	Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife,
181.175	Desktop Factory, Peoplelink --
183.985	we all had high hopes for,
183.985	but didn't succeed.
186.888	So I tried to rank across all 
186.888	of those attributes
189.833	how I felt those companies scored
189.833	on each of those dimensions.
193.075	And then for non-Idealab companies,
193.075	I looked at wild successes,
196.54	like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber
196.54	and Youtube and LinkedIn.
200.133	And some failures:
201.385	Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com
203.185	Flooz and Friendster.
204.465	The bottom companies had intense funding,
206.469	they even had business models
206.469	in some cases,
208.548	but they didn't succeed.
209.695	I tried to look at what factors
209.695	actually accounted the most
212.556	for success and failure across
212.556	all of these companies,
215.109	and the results really surprised me.
217.338	The number one thing was timing.
219.638	Timing accounted for 42 percent
222.14	of the difference
222.14	between success and failure.
224.64	Team and execution came in second,
226.742	and the idea,
227.564	the differentiability of the idea,
227.564	the uniqueness of the idea,
230.481	that actually came in third.
231.884	Now, this isn't absolutely definitive,
233.849	it's not to say that 
233.849	the idea isn't important,
236.066	but it very much surprised me that
236.066	the idea wasn't the most important thing.
239.706	Sometimes it mattered more when 
239.706	it was actually timed.
242.306	The last two, business model and funding,
242.306	made sense to me actually.
245.681	I think business model
245.681	makes sense to be that low
248.048	because you can start out
248.048	without a business model
250.428	and add one later if your customers
250.428	are demanding what you're creating.
253.895	And funding, I think as well,
255.301	if you're underfunded at first
255.301	but you're gaining traction,
258.076	especially in today's age,
259.365	it's very, very easy to get
259.365	intense funding.
261.426	So now let me give you some specific
261.426	examples about each of these.
264.546	So take a wild success like Airbnb
264.546	that everybody knows about.
267.459	Well, that company was famously
267.459	passed on by many smart investors
270.524	because people thought,
271.666	"""No one's going to rent out a space"
271.666	"in their home to a stranger."""
274.719	Of course, people proved that wrong.
276.444	But one of the reasons it succeeded,
278.298	aside from a good business model,
278.298	a good idea, great execution,
281.283	is the timing.
282.02	That company came out
282.02	right during the height of the recession
285.299	when people really needed extra money,
287.117	and that maybe helped people overcome
288.931	their objection to renting out
288.931	their own home to a stranger.
291.777	Same thing with Uber.
292.896	Uber came out,
293.949	incredible company,
293.949	incredible business model,
296.11	great execution, too.
297.174	But the timing was so perfect
298.656	for their need to get drivers
298.656	into the system.
300.805	Drivers were looking for extra money;
300.805	it was very, very important.
303.927	Some of our early successes, Citysearch,
303.927	came out when people needed web pages.
307.705	GoTo.com, which we announced
307.705	actually at TED in 1998,
310.182	was when companies were looking for
310.182	cost-effective ways to get traffic.
313.513	We thought the idea was so great,
315.085	but actually, the timing was probably
315.085	maybe more important.
317.846	And then some of our failures.
319.284	We started a company called Z.com,
319.284	it was an online entertainment company.
322.761	We were so excited about it --
324.204	we raised enough money,
324.204	we had a great business model,
326.746	we even signed incredibly great
326.746	Hollywood talent to join the company.
329.994	But broadband penetration
329.994	was too low in 1999-2000.
332.382	It was too hard to watch
332.382	video content online,
334.538	you had to put codecs in your browser
334.538	and do all this stuff,
337.347	and the company eventually
337.347	went out of business in 2003.
339.978	Just two years later,
341.074	when the codec problem
341.074	was solved by Adobe Flash
343.959	and when broadband penetration
343.959	crossed 50 percent in America,
347.633	YouTube was perfectly timed.
349.59	Great idea, but unbelievable timing.
351.319	In fact, YouTube didn't even have
351.319	a business model when it first started.
354.759	It wasn't even certain that 
354.759	that would work out.
357.042	But that was beautifully, 
357.042	beautifully timed.
359.177	So what I would say, in summary,
360.728	is execution definitely matters a lot.
363.513	The idea matters a lot.
364.757	But timing might matter even more.
366.516	And the best way to really assess timing
368.562	is to really look at whether 
368.562	consumers are really ready
371.179	for what you have to offer them.
372.715	And to be really, really honest about it,
374.677	not be in denial about
374.677	any results that you see,
376.938	because if you have something you love,
376.938	you want to push it forward,
380.149	but you have to be very, very honest
380.149	about that factor on timing.
383.219	As I said earlier,
384.089	I think startups can change the world
384.089	and make the world a better place.
387.478	I hope some of these insights
388.876	can maybe help you
388.876	have a slightly higher success ratio,
391.528	and thus make something great
391.528	come to the world
393.748	that wouldn't have happened otherwise.
395.594	Thank you very much,
395.594	you've been a great audience.
397.931	(Applause)
