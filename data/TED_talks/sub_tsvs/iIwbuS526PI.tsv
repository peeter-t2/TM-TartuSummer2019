681.213	Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.
682.78	That's amazing.
684.532	(Applause)
688.07	You just don't hear that every day.
689.7	(Laughter)
691.651	Usman, the official story is that
694.052	you learned to play the guitar
695.532	by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.
697.515	Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --
700.687	That was the first thing I learned,
702.983	and then I started progressing to other things.
705.614	And I started watching Kaki King a lot,
708.653	and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,
712.406	so then I started watching his videos,
714.55	and it's very surreal right now to be --
717.794	(Laughter)
719.955	(Applause)
724.655	CA: Was that piece just now,
726.427	that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?
729.617	UR: I'd never learned it before,
730.713	but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,
733.73	so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.
738.121	And it finally happened, so ...
740.809	(Laughter)
742.261	CA: Preston, from your point of view,
743.713	I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?
745.577	How does it feel to see someone like this
748.425	come along taking your art and doing so much with it?
753.125	Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing,
755.474	and I feel really proud, really honored.
758.769	And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool.
764.273	(Laughter)
767.193	CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?
772.505	Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?
774.937	PR: We haven't prepared anything.
777.719	CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what.
782.033	If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
785.594	and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
787.017	and we just see that, I just think --
788.545	I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.
791.361	And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.
793.273	(Applause)
