13.364	I just met you on a bus,
16.637	and we would really like 
16.637	to get to know each other,
19.078	but I've got to get off at the next stop,
21.564	so you're going to tell me 
21.564	three things about yourself
26.331	that just define you as a person,
29.911	three things about yourself
31.689	that will help me understand who you are,
35.298	three things that just 
35.298	get to your very essence.
39.292	And what I'm wondering
42.37	is, of those three things,
45.659	is any one of them
47.649	surviving some kind of trauma?
52.673	Cancer survivor, rape survivor,
58.37	Holocaust survivor, incest survivor.
63.487	Ever notice how we tend to identify ourselves
66.931	by our wounds?
69.462	And where I have seen this survivor identity
73.938	have the most consequences
76.426	is in the cancer community.
78.979	And I've been around this 
78.979	community for a long time,
81.713	because I've been a hospice 
81.713	and a hospital chaplain
84.907	for almost 30 years.
88.204	And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center
93.937	when I received the news that
96.242	my mother had breast cancer.
99.677	And then five days later,
101.859	I received the news that I had breast cancer.
107.326	My mother and I can be competitive —
109.959	(Laughter) —
111.747	but I was really not trying to
111.747	compete with her on this one.
116.179	And in fact, I thought, well,
118.204	if you have to have cancer,
120.139	it's pretty convenient to be working
121.86	at a place that treats it.
123.371	But this is what I heard from 
123.371	a lot of outraged people.
126.068	What?
127.53	You're the chaplain.
129.45	You should be immune.
131.74	Like, maybe I should have just gotten off
133.817	with a warning instead of an actual ticket,
136.112	because I'm on the force.
139.88	So I did get my treatment at the
139.88	cancer center where I worked,
142.855	which was amazingly convenient,
145.376	and I had chemotherapy
147.615	and a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,
150.325	and so before I say another word,
150.325	let me just say right now,
152.45	this is the fake one. (Laughter)
157.224	I have found that I need to get that out of the way,
160.437	because I'll see somebody go
162.211	"""Oh, I know it's this one."""
164.428	And then I'll move or I'll 
164.428	gesture and they'll go,
166.892	"""No, it's that one."""
169.445	So now you know.
171.616	I learned a lot being a patient,
173.753	and one of the surprising things was
175.275	that only a small part of the cancer experience
179.382	is about medicine.
181.474	Most of it is about feelings and faith
185.827	and losing and finding your identity
188.46	and discovering strength
190.038	and flexibility you never even knew you had.
193.96	It's about realizing that
196.289	the most important things in life are
199.359	not things at all, but relationships,
202.44	and it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty
206.506	and learning that the way to
206.506	get out of almost anything
209.945	"is to say, ""I have cancer."""
214.26	So the other thing I learned was that
216.773	"I don't have to take on ""cancer survivor"""
220.227	as my identity,
222.195	but, boy, are there powerful forces
225.814	pushing me to do just that.
229.36	Now, don't, please, misunderstand me.
233.678	Cancer organizations
235.637	and the drive for early screening
237.617	and cancer awareness and cancer research
240.271	have normalized cancer,
242.386	and this is a wonderful thing.
243.71	We can now talk about cancer
245.794	without whispering.
247.572	We can talk about cancer and
247.572	we can support one another.
252.09	But sometimes, it feels
255.176	like people go a little overboard
256.574	and they start telling us how we're going to feel.
261.779	So about a week after my surgery,
265.322	we had a houseguest.
268.202	That was probably our first mistake.
270.95	And keep in mind that
272.471	at this point in my life
274.141	I had been a chaplain for over 20 years,
277.763	and issues like dying and death
280.086	and the meaning of life,
281.642	these are all things I'd been 
281.642	yakking about forever.
284.82	So at dinner that night,
287.32	our houseguest proceeds to
287.32	stretch his arms up over his head,
290.056	"and say, ""You know, Deb,"
292.861	now you're really going to learn what's important.
297.01	Yes, you are going to make some big changes
299.707	in your life,
301.077	and now you're going to start
301.077	thinking about your death.
304.725	"Yep, this cancer is your wakeup call."""
310.52	Now, these are golden words
313.175	coming from someone who is speaking about
315.154	their own experience,
317.573	but when someone is telling you
319.949	how you are going to feel,
322.342	it's instant crap.
324.388	The only reason I did not kill him
327.292	with my bare hands
329.283	was because I could not lift my right arm.
333.378	But I did say a really bad word to him,
337.596	followed by a regular word, that —
340.497	(Laughter) —
341.72	"made my husband say, ""She's on narcotics."""
345.238	(Laughter)
347.196	And then after my treatment, it just felt like
349.69	everyone was telling me what my
349.69	experience was going to mean.
352.973	"""Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."""
355.765	"""Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."""
357.389	"""This means you're going to be wearing"
358.651	the pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt
361.042	and the headband and the earrings
362.904	"and the bracelet and the panties."""
366.64	Panties. No, seriously, google it.
369.869	(Laughter)
371.92	How is that raising awareness?
374.011	Only my husband should be seeing my panties.
376.078	(Laughter)
377.747	He's pretty aware of cancer already.
382.158	It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,
385.302	this is just taking over my life.
388.452	And that's when I told myself, 
388.452	claim your experience.
393.424	Don't let it claim you.
397.086	We all know that
399.194	the way to cope with trauma, with loss,
403.316	with any life-changing experience,
405.741	is to find meaning.
407.891	But here's the thing:
410.128	No one can tell us
411.795	what our experience means.
414.531	We have to decide what it means.
417.82	And it doesn't have to be some gigantic,
419.952	extroverted meaning.
421.959	We don't all have to start a foundation
424.47	or an organization or write a book
426.622	or make a documentary.
429.502	Meaning can be quiet
432.449	and introverted.
434.62	Maybe we make one small decision about our lives
440.548	that can bring about big change.
445.626	Many years ago, I had a patient,
447.566	just a wonderful young man
449.571	who was loved by the staff,
452.306	and so it was something of a shock to us to realize
455.19	that he had no friends.
458.974	He lived by himself,
461.28	he would come in for chemotherapy by himself,
465.308	he would receive his treatment,
467.253	and then he'd walk home alone.
470.984	"And I even asked him. I said, ""Hey,"
472.748	"how come you never bring a friend with you?"""
475.489	"And he said, ""I don't really have any friends."""
480.208	But he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.
482.469	We all loved him, and people were going
482.469	in and out of his room all the time.
486.845	So at his last chemo,
489.804	we sang him the song
491.131	and we put the crown on his 
491.131	head and we blew the bubbles,
493.898	and then I asked him, I said,
496.339	"""So what are you going to do now?"""
500.795	And he answered,
502.605	"""Make friends."""
504.238	And he did.
506.35	He started volunteering 
506.35	and he made friends there,
509.904	and he began going to a church
509.904	and he made friends there,
512.59	and at Christmas he invited my husband
512.59	and me to a party in his apartment,
515.55	and the place was filled with his friends.
520.667	Claim your experience.
522.91	Don't let it claim you.
524.559	He decided that the meaning of his experience
529.431	was to know the joy of friendship,
533.198	and then learn to make friends.
537.806	So what about you?
541.792	How are you going to find meaning
544.145	in your crappy experience?
546.592	It could be a recent one,
548.483	or it could be one that you've been carrying around
550.454	for a really long time.
554.345	It's never too late to change what it means,
558.855	because meaning is dynamic.
561.11	What it means today
562.771	may not be what it means a year from now,
564.698	or 10 years from now.
567.541	It's never too late to become someone other
570.151	than simply a survivor.
573.672	Hear how static that word sounds?
576.996	Survivor.
578.913	No movement, no growth.
583.304	Claim your experience.
585.191	Don't let it claim you, because if you do,
587.812	I believe you will become trapped,
590.973	you will not grow, you will not evolve.
596.915	But of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures
600.393	that cause us to take on that identity of survivor.
604.764	Sometimes we just like the perks.
608.657	Sometimes there's a payoff.
612.165	But then we get stuck.
615.9	Now, one of the first things I learned
617.711	as a chaplain intern was the three C's
621.817	of the chaplain's job:
624.208	Comfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront
631.17	or challenge.
633.325	Now, we all pretty much love the comforting
635.271	and the clarifying.
637.128	The confronting, not so much.
642.07	One of the other things that I loved
644.064	about being a chaplain was
646.522	seeing patients a year, or even several years
650.995	after their treatment, because
652.836	it was just really cool to see 
652.836	how they had changed
655.536	and how their lives had evolved
657.752	and what had happened to them.
659.642	So I was thrilled one day
662.162	to get a page down into the lobby of the clinic
664.61	from a patient who I had seen the year before,
668.191	and she was there with her two adult daughters,
670.665	who I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.
674.924	So I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic
678.461	because she had just gotten
678.461	all of her test results back
680.712	and she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.
686.9	Which I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.
691.657	So they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,
697.15	and it was so weird, because
699.957	within two minutes, she 
699.957	started retelling me the story
703.839	of her diagnosis and her 
703.839	surgery and her chemo,
708.369	even though, as her chaplain, 
708.369	I saw her every week,
711.837	and so I knew this story.
714.728	And she was using words like suffering,
717.77	agony, struggle.
721.765	And she ended her story with,
724.379	"""I felt crucified."""
729.173	And at that point, her two 
729.173	daughters got up and said,
731.837	"""We're going to go get coffee."""
735.749	And they left.
738.89	Tell me three things about
738.89	yourself before the next stop.
741.725	People were leaving the bus before she even got
744.481	to number two or number three.
749.858	So I handed her a tissue,
753.345	and I gave her a hug,
756.642	and then, because I really cared for this woman,
760.152	I said,
762.238	"""Get down off your cross."""
764.544	"And she said, ""What?"""
768.81	"And I repeated, ""Get down off your cross."""
774.224	And to her credit, she could 
774.224	talk about her reasons
778.869	for embracing and then clinging to this identity.
783.988	It got her a lot of attention.
786.01	People were taking care of her for a change.
789.115	But now, it was having the opposite effect.
792.81	It was pushing people away.
795.293	People kept leaving to get coffee.
799.04	She felt crucified by her experience,
802.941	but she didn't want to let that crucified self die.
809.163	Now, perhaps you are thinking
812.08	I was a little harsh with her,
815.03	so I must tell you that
817.138	I was speaking out of my own experience.
820.83	Many, many years before,
823.674	I had been fired from a job that I loved,
827	and I would not stop talking about my innocence
830.716	and the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,
834.12	until finally, just like this woman,
835.25	people were walking away from me,
837.291	until I finally realized
840.527	I wasn't just processing my feelings,
844.399	I was feeding them.
847.107	I didn't want to let that crucified self die.
851.17	But we all know that with any resurrection story,
856.592	you have to die first.
859.22	The Christian story,
861.043	Jesus was dead a whole day in the tomb
864.315	before he was resurrected.
866.81	And I believe that for us,
868.648	being in the tomb
870.78	means doing our own deep inner work
874.766	around our wounds
877.47	and allowing ourselves to be healed.
881.943	We have to let that crucified self die
885	so that a new self, a truer self,
888.604	is born.
890.986	We have to let that old story go
893.844	so that a new story, a truer story,
897.991	can be told.
901.03	Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.
906.573	What if there were no survivors,
909.154	meaning, what if people decided
911.95	to just claim their trauma as an experience
914.82	instead of taking it on as an identity?
918.99	Maybe it would be the end of being
920.992	trapped in our wounds
923.35	and the beginning of amazing
926.904	self-exploration and discovery and growth.
930.83	Maybe it would be the start of defining ourselves
935.625	by who we have become
938.205	and who we are becoming.
942.375	So perhaps survivor was not
948.146	one of the three things that you would tell me.
953.353	No matter.
954.67	I just want you all to know that
956.91	I am really glad that we are on this bus together,
961.223	and this is my stop.
965.119	(Applause)
