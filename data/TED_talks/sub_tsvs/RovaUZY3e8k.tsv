14.79	Hello.
16	I'm a toy developer.
18.845	With a dream of creating new toys
18.845	that have never been seen before,
22.899	I began working at a toy company
22.899	nine years ago.
26.026	When I first started working there,
28.062	I proposed many new ideas
28.062	to my boss every day.
32.02	However, my boss always asked
34.838	if I had the data to prove it would sell,
37.442	and asked me to think of product
37.442	development after analyzing market data.
40.875	Data, data, data.
42.539	So I analyzed the market data
42.539	before thinking of a product.
46.788	However, I was unable to think
46.788	of anything new at that moment.
51.08	(Laughter)
52.542	My ideas were unoriginal.
54.591	I wasn't getting any new ideas
54.591	and I grew tired of thinking.
58.904	It was so hard that I became this skinny.
63.585	(Laughter)
65.582	It's true.
65.582	(Applause)
68.224	You've all probably had
68.224	similar experiences and felt this way too.
72.279	Your boss was being difficult.
72.279	The data was difficult.
74.891	You become sick of thinking.
76.682	Now, I throw out the data.
79.587	It's my dream to create new toys.
82.596	And now, instead of data,
84.824	I'm using a game called Shiritori
84.824	to come up with new ideas.
89.012	I would like to introduce
89.012	this method today.
92.58	What is Shiritori?
94.701	Take apple, elephant 
94.701	and trumpet, for example.
97.166	It's a game where 
97.166	you take turns saying words
99.4	that start with the last letter
99.4	of the previous word.
101.962	It's the same in Japanese and English.
103.864	You can play Shiritori as you like:
106.158	"""neko, kora, raibu, burashi,"" etc, etc."
106.158	[Cat, cola, concert, brush]
109.396	Many random words will come out.
112.084	You force those words to connect to what
112.084	you want to think of and form ideas.
117.174	In my case, for example,
117.174	since I want to think of toys,
120.777	what could a toy cat be?
123.66	A cat that lands after doing
123.66	a somersault from a high place?
127.227	How about a toy with cola?
129.353	A toy gun where you shoot cola
129.353	and get someone soaking wet?
132.354	(Laughter)
133.343	Ridiculous ideas are okay.
133.343	The key is to keep them flowing.
136.376	The more ideas you produce, you're sure
136.376	to come up with some good ones, too.
141.732	A brush, for example.
141.732	Can we make a toothbrush into a toy?
146.598	We could combine
146.598	a toothbrush with a guitar and --
150.464	(Music noises) --
152.609	you've got a toy you can play with
152.609	while brushing your teeth.
155.765	(Laughter) (Applause)
157.531	Kids who don't like to brush
157.531	their teeth might begin to like it.
161.484	Can we make a hat into a toy?
164.706	How about something like a roulette game,
164.706	where you try the hat on one by one,
168.757	and then, when someone puts it on,
168.757	a scary alien breaks through the top
173.641	"screaming, ""Ahh!"""
175.635	I wonder if there would be
175.635	a demand for this at parties?
178.63	Ideas that didn't come out while you stare
178.63	at the data will start to come out.
183.873	Actually, this bubble wrap,
183.873	which is used to pack fragile objects,
189.745	combined with a toy,
189.745	made Mugen Pop Pop,
194.551	a toy where you can pop
194.551	the bubbles as much as you like.
197.823	It was a big hit when it reached stores.
200.013	Data had nothing to do with its success.
202.96	Although it's only popping bubbles,
205.662	it's a great way to kill time,
207.716	so please pass this around
209.77	amongst yourselves today and play with it.
212.325	(Applause)
216.856	Anyway, you continue to come up with
216.856	useless ideas.
219.544	Think up many trivial ideas, everyone.
221.894	If you base your ideas on data analysis
221.894	and know what you're aiming for,
225.591	you'll end up trying too hard,
228.06	and you can't produce new ideas.
230.002	Even if you know what your aim is,
232.235	think of ideas as freely as if you were
232.235	throwing darts with your eyes closed.
236.121	If you do this, you surely will hit
236.121	somewhere near the center.
239.272	At least one will.
240.86	That's the one you should choose.
242.907	If you do so, that idea will be in demand
245.541	and, moreover, it will be brand new.
248.325	That is how I think of new ideas.
250.441	It doesn't have to be Shiritori;
250.441	there are many different methods.
253.633	You just have to choose words at random.
255.543	You can flip through a dictionary
255.543	and choose words at random.
258.49	For example, you could look up two
258.49	random letters and gather the results
262.904	or go to the store
262.904	and connect product names
266.552	with what you want to think of.
269.992	The point is to gather random words,
273.142	not information from the category
273.142	you're thinking for.
276.487	If you do this, the ingredients for
276.487	the association of ideas are collected
282.467	and form connections
282.467	that will produce many ideas.
285.356	The greatest advantage to this method
285.356	is the continuous flow of images.
289.245	Because you're thinking
289.245	of one word after another,
292.218	the image of the previous word
292.218	is still with you.
294.884	That image will automatically
294.884	be related with future words.
297.649	Unconsciously, a concert will
297.649	be connected to a brush
300.171	and a roulette game
300.171	will be connected to a hat.
302.36	You wouldn't even realize it.
303.74	You can come up with ideas that
303.74	you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.
307.081	This method is, of course,
307.081	not just for toys.
309.181	You can collect ideas for books, apps,
309.181	events, and many other projects.
313.892	I hope you all try this method.
318.17	There are futures that are born from data.
321.089	However, using this silly game
321.089	called Shiritori,
325.859	I look forward to
325.859	the exciting future you will create,
328.959	a future you couldn't even imagine.
332.49	Thank you very much.
334.891	(Applause)
