12.58	I'm going to talk to you tonight
14.348	about coming out of the closet,
16.044	and not in the traditional sense,
17.256	not just the gay closet.
19.568	I think we all have closets.
21.622	Your closet may be telling someone
23.514	you love her for the first time,
25.736	or telling someone that you're pregnant,
27.882	or telling someone you have cancer,
30.414	or any of the other hard conversations
32.445	we have throughout our lives.
34.711	All a closet is is a hard conversation,
38.381	and although our topics may vary tremendously,
41.435	the experience of being in
43.107	and coming out of the closet is universal.
46.438	It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
52.03	Several years ago,
53.399	I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,
57.17	a local diner in town,
59.241	and during my time there I would go through phases
61.956	of militant lesbian intensity:
65.521	not shaving my armpits,
67.296	quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.
70.845	And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts
73.1	and how recently I had shaved my head,
75.8	the question would often be sprung on me,
77.327	usually by a little kid:
79.41	"""Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"""
84.577	And there would be an awkward silence at the table.
87.249	I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,
89.672	hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.
92.791	The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper
95.628	and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.
97.946	But I would say nothing,
99.65	and I would seethe inside.
101.886	And it got to the point where every time I walked up
103.534	to a table that had a kid anywhere between
103.534	three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
107.562	(Laughter)
109.008	And that is a terrible feeling.
111.256	So I promised myself, the next
111.256	time, I would say something.
115.104	I would have that hard conversation.
117.472	So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
120.023	"""Are you a boy or are you a girl?"""
122.795	Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,
125.948	and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101
129.899	on this table. (Laughter)
132.237	I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.
134.737	I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.
136.535	I've even got this little bit from
136.535	"""Vagina Monologues"" I'm going to do."
139.833	So I take a deep breath and I look down
143.428	and staring back at me is a
143.428	four-year-old girl in a pink dress,
147.807	not a challenge to a feminist duel,
149.852	just a kid with a question:
152.412	"""Are you a boy or are you a girl?"""
154.783	So I take another deep breath,
156.428	squat down to next to her, and say,
157.795	"""Hey, I know it's kind of confusing."
159.917	My hair is short like a boy's,
161.679	and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,
163.711	and you know how sometimes
163.711	you like to wear a pink dress,
165.678	and sometimes you like to
165.678	wear your comfy jammies?
168.334	"Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."""
172.026	And this kid looks me dead in the eye,
174.114	without missing a beat, and says,
175.745	"""My favorite pajamas are purple with fish."
177.697	"Can I get a pancake, please?"""
179.588	(Laughter)
182.309	"And that was it. Just, ""Oh, okay. You're a girl."
185.775	"How about that pancake?"""
188.018	It was the easiest hard conversation
190.5	I have ever had.
192.892	And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,
195.554	we were both real with each other.
198.915	So like many of us,
200.691	I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,
203.028	most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.
205.642	But inside, in the dark,
207.666	you can't tell what color the walls are.
209.834	You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.
213.244	So really, my closet is no different than yours
216.995	or yours or yours.
219.82	Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons
221.564	why coming out of my closet was
221.564	harder than coming out of yours,
223.895	but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.
226.097	Hard is hard.
228.09	Who can tell me that explaining to
228.09	someone you've just declared bankruptcy
232.233	is harder than telling someone
232.233	you just cheated on them?
234.472	Who can tell me that his coming out story
237.059	is harder than telling your five-year-old 
237.059	you're getting a divorce?
239.936	There is no harder, there is just hard.
243.275	We need to stop ranking our hard
243.275	against everyone else's hard
246.813	to make us feel better or worse about our closets
249.212	and just commiserate on the 
249.212	fact that we all have hard.
253.275	At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,
256.611	and they may feel safe,
258.541	or at least safer than what lies
258.541	on the other side of that door.
261.488	But I am here to tell you,
263.253	no matter what your walls are made of,
265.378	a closet is no place for a person to live.
269.946	Thanks. (Applause)
272.106	So imagine yourself 20 years ago.
276.334	Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,
281.142	and high-heeled shoes.
283.1	I was not the militant lesbian
284.995	ready to fight any four-year-old
284.995	that walked into the cafe.
288.934	I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner
292.623	of my pitch-black closet
294.887	clutching my gay grenade,
297.142	and moving one muscle is the scariest thing
300.774	I have ever done.
303.087	My family, my friends, complete strangers --
305.303	I had spent my entire life
306.745	trying to not disappoint these people,
308.369	and now I was turning the world upside down
311.985	on purpose.
313.609	I was burning the pages of the script
315.727	we had all followed for so long,
317.954	but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
321.597	One of my most memorable grenade tosses
323.475	was at my sister's wedding.
325.636	(Laughter)
327.546	It was the first time that many in attendance
330.241	knew I was gay, so in doing 
330.241	my maid of honor duties,
333.412	in my black dress and heels,
335.528	I walked around to tables
337.333	and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,
339.502	folks that had known me for years.
342.67	And after a little small talk,
342.67	one of the women shouted out,
345.781	"""I love Nathan Lane!"""
348.283	And the battle of gay relatability had begun.
351.371	"""Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"""
353.218	"""Well, yeah, actually, we have"
353.218	"friends in San Francisco."""
355.85	"""Well, we've never been there"
355.85	"but we've heard it's fabulous."""
358.385	"""Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?"
360.246	He's really good and he has
360.246	"never talked about a girlfriend."""
363.395	"""Ash, what's your favorite TV show?"
365.033	Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will &amp; Grace.
367.168	And you know who we love? Jack.
368.771	"Jack is our favorite."""
370.596	And then one woman, stumped
373.188	but wanting so desperately to show her support,
375.676	to let me know she was on my side,
378.05	she finally blurted out,
379.93	"""Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."""
383.276	(Laughter)
385.839	And I had a choice in that moment,
387.918	as all grenade throwers do.
389.846	I could go back to my girlfriend
389.846	and my gay-loving table
393.286	and mock their responses,
395.185	chastise their unworldliness and their inability
397.559	to jump through the politically correct 
397.559	gay hoops I had brought with me,
400.477	or I could empathize with them
403.345	and realize that that was maybe one of
403.345	the hardest things they had ever done,
407.062	that starting and having that conversation
410.458	was them coming out of their closets.
412.843	Sure, it would have been easy
412.843	to point out where they felt short.
416.111	It's a lot harder to meet them where they are
418.366	and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.
420.658	And what else can you ask someone to do but try?
425.503	If you're going to be real with someone,
427.576	you gotta be ready for real in return.
431.146	So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
434.545	Ask anybody I have ever dated.
436.566	But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call
439.794	the three Pancake Girl principles.
441.431	Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,
445.203	but know what it takes to come out of any closet
448.379	is essentially the same.
450.338	Number one: Be authentic.
453.018	Take the armor off. Be yourself.
454.732	That kid in the cafe had no armor,
456.468	but I was ready for battle.
458.764	If you want someone to be real with you,
461.353	they need to know that you bleed too.
464.337	Number two: Be direct. Just
464.337	say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
467.347	If you know you are gay, just say it.
470.083	If you tell your parents you might be gay,
471.951	they will hold out hope that this will change.
473.593	Do not give them that sense of false hope.
476.502	(Laughter)
478.455	And number three, and most important --
483.062	(Laughter)
485.386	Be unapologetic.
489.117	You are speaking your truth.
491.182	Never apologize for that.
495.079	And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,
497.501	so sure, apologize for what you've done,
500.439	but never apologize for who you are.
503.943	And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,
506.687	but that is on them, not on you.
509.447	Those are their expectations
509.447	of who you are, not yours.
511.919	That is their story, not yours.
516.14	The only story that matters
517.926	is the one that you want to write.
520.642	So the next time you find yourself
522.485	in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,
524.705	know we have all been there before.
528.027	And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
531.205	And we know it's hard but we need you out here,
534.923	no matter what your walls are made of,
537.604	because I guarantee you there are others
539.618	peering through the keyholes of their closets
541.545	looking for the next brave soul to
541.545	bust a door open, so be that person
545.677	and show the world that we
545.677	are bigger than our closets
548.707	and that a closet is no place for a person
552.099	to truly live.
553.839	Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)
