15.26	Okay, I'm going to show you
18.26	again something about our diets.
21.26	And I would like to know what the audience is,
24.26	and so who of you ever ate insects?
29.26	That's quite a lot.
31.26	(Laughter)
33.26	But still, you're not representing
35.26	the overall population of the Earth.
37.26	(Laughter)
39.26	Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
42.26	But this is quite good.
45.26	Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?
48.26	Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.
51.26	And here you see just a selection.
53.26	There's six million species of insects on this planet,
56.26	six million species.
58.26	There's a few hundreds of mammals --
60.26	six million species of insects.
63.26	In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,
66.26	we would come at much larger numbers.
69.26	In fact, of all animals on Earth,
72.26	of all animal species,
76.26	But if we would count all the individuals,
79.26	and we take an average weight of them,
81.26	it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms
84.26	for each of you and me on Earth.
87.26	That means that in terms of biomass,
89.26	insects are more abundant than we are,
92.26	and we're not on a planet of men,
94.26	but we're on a planet of insects.
97.26	Insects are not only there in nature,
99.26	but they also are involved in our economy,
101.26	usually without us knowing.
103.26	There was an estimation,
105.26	a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago
107.26	that the U.S. economy
109.26	benefited by 57 billion
112.26	dollars per year.
114.26	It's a number -- very large --
117.26	a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
120.26	And so I looked up what the economy was paying
123.26	for the war in Iraq
125.26	in the same year.
127.26	It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
129.26	Well we know that that
131.26	was not a cheap war.
133.26	So insects, just for free,
135.26	contribute to the economy of the United States
137.26	with about the same order of magnitude,
140.26	just for free, without everyone knowing.
142.26	And not only in the States,
144.26	but in any country, in any economy.
146.26	What do they do?
148.26	They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.
150.26	A third of all the fruits that we eat
152.26	are all a result
154.26	of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.
157.26	They control pests,
159.26	and they're food for animals.
161.26	They're at the start of food chains.
163.26	Small animals eat insects.
165.26	Even larger animals eat insects.
167.26	But the small animals that eat insects
169.26	are being eaten by larger animals,
171.26	still larger animals.
173.26	And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
177.26	There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
179.26	And here you see me
181.26	in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --
183.26	about two million inhabitants.
185.26	If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,
188.26	where you can select which fish you want to eat,
191.26	you can select which insects you would like to eat.
193.26	And they prepare it in a wonderful way.
195.26	And here you see me enjoying a meal
197.26	with caterpillars, locusts,
200.26	bee pupae -- delicacies.
203.26	And you can eat something new everyday.
206.26	There's more than 1,000 species of insects
209.26	that are being eaten all around the globe.
212.26	That's quite a bit more
214.26	than just a few mammals that we're eating,
216.26	like a cow or a pig
218.26	or a sheep.
220.26	More than 1,000 species --
222.26	an enormous variety.
225.26	And now you may think, okay,
227.26	in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.
230.26	Well we've seen already that quite some of you
232.26	already ate insects maybe occasionally,
235.26	but I can tell you that every one of you
237.26	is eating insects, without any exception.
240.26	You're eating at least
244.26	What are you eating?
246.26	Tomato soup, peanut butter,
248.26	chocolate, noodles --
250.26	any processed food that you're eating
252.26	contains insects,
254.26	because insects are here all around us,
257.26	and when they're out there in nature
259.26	they're also in our crops.
261.26	Some fruits get some insect damage.
264.26	Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,
266.26	that go to the tomato soup.
268.26	If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.
271.26	And that's your view of a tomato.
274.26	But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,
277.26	and as long as they meet
279.26	the requirements of the food agency,
282.26	there can be all kinds of things in there,
284.26	no problem.
286.26	In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,
289.26	there's meat in there anyway?
291.26	(Laughter)
295.26	In fact, all our processed foods
297.26	contain more proteins
299.26	than we would be aware of.
303.26	So anything is a good protein source already.
306.26	Now you may say,
308.26	"""Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."""
311.26	We're even doing this on purpose.
313.26	In a lot of food items that we have --
315.26	I have only two items
317.26	here on the slide --
319.26	pink cookies or surimi sticks
321.26	or, if you like, Campari --
323.26	a lot of our food products that are of a red color
326.26	are dyed with a natural dye.
329.26	The surimi sticks
331.26	[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,
333.26	is white fish
335.26	that's being dyed with cochineal.
337.26	Cochineal is a product
339.26	of an insect that lives off these cacti.
342.26	It's being produced in large amounts,
348.26	in the Canary Islands in Peru,
351.26	and it's big business.
353.26	One gram of cochineal
356.26	costs about 30 euros.
358.26	One gram of gold
361.26	is 30 euros.
364.26	So it's a very precious thing
367.26	that we're using to dye our foods.
370.26	Now the situation in the world is going to change
373.26	for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.
375.26	The human population is growing very rapidly
378.26	and is growing exponentially.
380.26	Where, at the moment, we have
382.26	something between six and seven billion people,
384.26	it will grow to about nine billion
386.26	in 2050.
389.26	That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,
392.26	and this is something that worries more and more people.
395.26	There was an FAO conference last October
397.26	that was completely devoted to this.
399.26	How are we going to feed this world?
401.26	And if you look at the figures up there,
403.26	it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,
406.26	but we need an agricultural production increase
408.26	of 70 percent.
410.26	And that's especially because this world population
412.26	is increasing,
414.26	and it's increasing, not only in numbers,
417.26	but we're also getting wealthier,
420.26	and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
423.26	and also starts to eat more meat.
426.26	And meat, in fact, is something
428.26	that costs a lot
430.26	of our agricultural production.
432.26	Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,
435.26	and at the moment, most of us here
437.26	get it from livestock,
439.26	from fish, from game.
441.26	And we eat quite a lot of it.
443.26	In the developed world it's on average
449.26	which goes up to 120
451.26	in the United States
453.26	and a bit lower in some other countries,
455.26	but on average 80 kilograms
457.26	per person per year.
459.26	In the developing world it's much lower.
462.26	It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
464.26	But it's increasing enormously.
466.26	In China in the last 20 years,
468.26	it increased from 20 to 50,
471.26	and it's still increasing.
474.26	So if a third of the world population
477.26	is going to increase its meat consumption
480.26	from 25 to 80 on average,
483.26	and a third of the world population
485.26	is living in China and in India,
487.26	we're having an enormous demand on meat.
491.26	And of course, we are not there to say
493.26	that's only for us, it's not for them.
496.26	They have the same share that we have.
498.26	Now to start with, I should say
500.26	that we are eating way too much meat
502.26	in the Western world.
504.26	We could do with much, much less --
506.26	and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,
509.26	and you can easily do without anything.
511.26	You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
514.26	But then there's a lot of problems
516.26	that come with meat production,
518.26	and we're being faced with that more and more often.
521.26	The first problem that we're facing is human health.
524.26	Pigs are quite like us.
526.26	They're even models in medicine,
529.26	and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
532.26	That means that pigs also share diseases with us.
535.26	And a pig disease,
537.26	a pig virus, and a human virus
539.26	can both proliferate,
541.26	and because of their kind of reproduction,
543.26	they can combine and produce a new virus.
545.26	This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s
548.26	during the classical swine fever outbreak.
551.26	You get a new disease that can be deadly.
555.26	We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us
558.26	that this doesn't happen.
560.26	So that's one point for insects.
563.26	(Laughter)
565.26	And there's the conversion factor.
568.26	You take 10 kilograms of feed,
570.26	you can get one kilogram of beef,
573.26	but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
575.26	So if you would be an entrepreneur,
577.26	what would you do?
579.26	With 10 kilograms of input,
581.26	you can get either one or nine kg. of output.
584.26	So far we're taking
586.26	the one, or up to five kilograms of output.
589.26	We're not taking the bonus yet.
591.26	We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.
594.26	So that's two points for insects.
596.26	(Laughter)
598.26	And there's the environment.
600.26	If we take 10 kilograms of food --
602.26	(Laughter)
604.26	and it results in one kilogram of beef,
607.26	the other nine kilograms are waste,
609.26	and a lot of that is manure.
612.26	If you produce insects, you have less manure
614.26	per kilogram of meat that you produce.
617.26	So less waste.
619.26	Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,
622.26	you have much, much less ammonia
625.26	and fewer greenhouse gases
627.26	when you have insect manure
629.26	than when you have cow manure.
631.26	So you have less waste,
633.26	and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign
636.26	as it is with cow dung.
638.26	So that's three points for insects.
640.26	(Laughter)
643.26	"Now there's a big ""if,"" of course,"
645.26	and it is if insects produce meat
648.26	that is of good quality.
650.26	Well there have been all kinds of analyses
652.26	and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,
655.26	it's very good.
657.26	In fact, it's comparable
659.26	to anything we eat as meat at the moment.
661.26	And even in terms of calories, it is very good.
663.26	One kilogram of grasshoppers
665.26	has the same amount of calories
667.26	as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.
669.26	So that's four points for insects.
671.26	(Laughter)
674.26	I can go on,
676.26	and I could make many more points for insects,
678.26	but time doesn't allow this.
680.26	So the question is, why not eat insects?
682.26	I gave you at least four arguments in favor.
684.26	We'll have to.
686.26	Even if you don't like it,
688.26	you'll have to get used to this
690.26	because at the moment,
694.26	is being used to produce livestock.
696.26	That's not only the land
698.26	where the livestock is walking and feeding,
700.26	but it's also other areas
702.26	where the feed is being produced and being transported.
705.26	We can increase it a bit
707.26	at the expense of rainforests,
709.26	but there's a limitation very soon.
711.26	And if you remember that we need to increase
713.26	agricultural production by 70 percent,
715.26	we're not going to make it that way.
717.26	We could much better change
719.26	from meat, from beef,
722.26	to insects.
724.26	And then 80 percent of the world
727.26	already eats insects,
729.26	so we are just a minority --
731.26	in a country like the U.K., the USA,
734.26	the Netherlands, anywhere.
737.26	On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos
739.26	where they have abundantly present
741.26	all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
746.26	On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
748.26	So people there are eating them,
751.26	not because they're hungry,
753.26	but because they think it's a delicacy.
755.26	It's just very good food.
757.26	You can vary enormously.
759.26	It has many benefits.
761.26	In fact, we have delicacy
763.26	that's very much like this grasshopper:
765.26	shrimps, a delicacy
768.26	being sold at a high price.
770.26	Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
772.26	There are a few people who don't like shrimp,
774.26	but shrimp, or crabs,
776.26	or crayfish,
778.26	are very closely related.
780.26	They are delicacies.
782.26	"In fact, a locust is a ""shrimp"" of the land,"
785.26	and it would make very good into our diet.
788.26	So why are we not eating insects yet?
790.26	Well that's just a matter of mindset.
792.26	We're not used to it,
794.26	and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
797.26	That's why we're changing the perception of insects.
800.26	And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,
803.26	in telling people what insects are,
806.26	what magnificent things they are,
808.26	what magnificent jobs they do in nature.
810.26	And in fact, without insects,
812.26	we would not be here in this room,
814.26	because if the insects die out,
816.26	we will soon die out as well.
819.26	If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
822.26	(Laughter)
824.26	So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.
826.26	And some might think, well they're not yet available.
828.26	Well they are.
830.26	There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,
833.26	and one of them is here in the audience,
835.26	Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.
837.26	I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --
840.26	not visible, but as animal protein
842.26	in the food.
846.26	And maybe by 2020,
849.26	you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
852.26	And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.
855.26	A Dutch chocolate maker.
858.26	(Music)
895.26	(Applause)
897.26	So there's even a lot of design to it.
899.26	(Laughter)
902.26	Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,
905.26	and she puts the insects on the menu
907.26	in her restaurant in her ministry.
910.26	And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
913.26	over to the Hague recently,
916.26	she went to a high-class restaurant,
919.26	and they ate insects all together.
921.26	It's not something that is a hobby of mine.
924.26	It's really taken off the ground.
926.26	So why not eat insects?
928.26	You should try it yourself.
930.26	A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together
933.26	in a square in Wageningen town,
936.26	and they ate insects at the same moment,
938.26	and this was still big, big news.
941.26	I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,
944.26	because it's just a normal way of doing.
946.26	So you can try it yourself today,
949.26	and I would say, enjoy.
952.26	And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,
955.26	and he can have the first bite.
958.26	(Applause)
970.26	Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first.
973.26	Marcel Dicke: It's all protein.
976.26	BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.
979.26	And it looks delicious.
981.26	They just make it [with] nuts or something.
984.26	MD: Thank you.
986.26	(Applause)
