14.206	I'm a potter,
17.224	which seems like a fairly humble vocation.
21.749	I know a lot about pots.
24.629	I've spent about 15 years making them.
28.309	One of the things that really
28.309	excites me in my artistic practice
31.339	and being trained as a potter
34.056	is that you very quickly learn
34.056	how to make great things out of nothing;
39.5	that I spent a lot of time at my wheel
39.5	with mounds of clay trying stuff;
46.283	and that the limitations
46.283	of my capacity, my ability,
49.775	was based on my hands and my imagination;
52.506	that if I wanted to make
52.506	a really nice bowl
54.706	and I didn't know how to make a foot yet,
56.81	I would have to learn how to make a foot;
59.829	that that process of learning
59.829	has been very, very helpful to my life.
64.983	I feel like, as a potter,
66.957	you also start to learn
66.957	how to shape the world.
71.067	There have been times
71.067	in my artistic capacity
74.178	that I wanted to reflect
77.041	on other really important moments
79.704	in the history of the U.S.,
79.704	the history of the world
83.814	where tough things happened,
85.405	but how do you talk about tough ideas
88.086	without separating people
88.086	from that content?
92.196	Could I use art like these old,
92.196	discontinued firehoses from Alabama,
97.792	to talk about the complexities of a moment
97.792	of civil rights in the '60s?
103.946	Is it possible to talk about my father
103.946	and I doing labor projects?
108.797	My dad was a roofer, construction guy,
108.797	he owned small businesses,
112.954	and at 80, he was ready to retire
112.954	and his tar kettle was my inheritance.
119.85	Now, a tar kettle doesn't sound
119.85	like much of an inheritance. It wasn't.
123.659	It was stinky and it took up
123.659	a lot of space in my studio,
127.606	but I asked my dad if he would be willing
127.606	to make some art with me,
131.901	if we could reimagine this kind
131.901	of nothing material
135.732	as something very special.
138.217	And by elevating the material
138.217	and my dad's skill,
141.607	could we start to think about tar
141.607	just like clay, in a new way,
147.905	shaping it differently,
147.905	helping us to imagine what was possible?
153.607	After clay, I was then kind of turned on
153.607	to lots of different kinds of materials,
157.79	and my studio grew a lot
157.79	because I thought, well,
160.762	it's not really about the material,
160.762	it's about our capacity to shape things.
164.849	I became more and more interested in ideas
167.705	and more and more things that 
167.705	were happening just outside my studio.
173.897	Just to give you a little bit of context,
173.897	I live in Chicago.
177.104	I live on the South Side now.
177.104	I'm a West Sider.
180.359	For those of you who are not Chicagoans,
180.359	that won't mean anything,
183.773	but if I didn't mention
183.773	that I was a West Sider,
186.025	there would be a lot of people
186.025	in the city that would be very upset.
190.204	The neighborhood that I live in
190.204	is Grand Crossing.
193.153	It's a neighborhood
193.153	that has seen better days.
196.976	It is not a gated community by far.
201.071	There is lots of abandonment
201.071	in my neighborhood,
204.205	and while I was kind of busy
204.205	making pots and busy making art
207.711	and having a good art career,
209.662	there was all of this stuff
209.662	that was happening
211.807	just outside my studio.
214.46	All of us know about
214.46	failing housing markets
217.748	and the challenges of blight,
219.58	and I feel like we talk about it
219.58	with some of our cities more than others,
223.057	but I think a lot of our
223.057	U.S. cities and beyond
225.991	have the challenge of blight,
228.011	abandoned buildings that people
228.011	no longer know what to do anything with.
232.237	And so I thought, is there a way
232.237	that I could start to think
235.093	about these buildings as an extension
235.093	or an expansion of my artistic practice?
240.479	And that if I was thinking
240.479	along with other creatives --
243.498	architects, engineers,
243.498	real estate finance people --
247.166	that us together might be able
247.166	to kind of think
250.046	in more complicated ways
250.046	about the reshaping of cities.
255.085	And so I bought a building.
256.733	The building was really affordable.
259.473	We tricked it out.
261.185	We made it as beautiful as we could
261.185	to try to just get some activity happening
265.62	on my block.
267.872	Once I bought the building
267.872	for about 18,000 dollars,
270.31	I didn't have any money left.
272.33	So I started sweeping the building
272.33	as a kind of performance.
277.599	This is performance art,
277.599	and people would come over,
280.341	and I would start sweeping.
281.897	Because the broom was free
281.897	and sweeping was free.
284.544	It worked out.
286.703	(Laughter)
288.938	But we would use the building, then,
288.938	to stage exhibitions, small dinners,
294.389	and we found that that building
294.389	on my block, Dorchester --
298.336	we now referred to the block
298.336	as Dorchester projects --
301.052	that in a way that building
301.052	became a kind of gathering site
304.535	for lots of different kinds of activity.
306.769	We turned the building into
306.769	what we called now the Archive House.
311.222	The Archive House would do
311.222	all of these amazing things.
314.403	Very significant people
314.403	in the city and beyond
317.747	would find themselves
317.747	in the middle of the hood.
320.422	And that's when I felt like
322.79	maybe there was a relationship
322.79	between my history with clay
325.602	and this new thing that was
325.602	starting to develop,
328.172	that we were slowly starting
330.514	to reshape how people imagined
330.514	the South Side of the city.
335.44	One house turned into a few houses,
337.622	and we always tried to suggest
340.084	that not only is creating
340.084	a beautiful vessel important,
344.008	but the contents of what happens
344.008	in those buildings is also very important.
347.884	So we were not only thinking
347.884	about development,
350.532	but we were thinking about the program,
352.854	thinking about the kind of connections
352.854	that could happen
356.36	between one house and another,
356.36	between one neighbor and another.
362.159	This building became what we call
362.159	the Listening House,
365.181	and it has a collection of discarded books
368.431	from the Johnson Publishing Corporation,
371.102	and other books from an old bookstore
371.102	that was going out of business.
375.095	I was actually just wanting to activate
375.095	these buildings as much as I could
379.368	with whatever and whoever would join me.
383.678	In Chicago, there's
383.678	amazing building stock.
386.612	This building, which had been
386.612	the former crack house on the block,
390.791	and when the building became abandoned,
393.345	it became a great opportunity to really
393.345	imagine what else could happen there.
397.246	So this space we converted into
397.246	what we call Black Cinema House.
401.298	Black Cinema House was an opportunity
401.298	in the hood to screen films
405.419	that were important and relevant
405.419	to the folk who lived around me,
409.633	that if we wanted to show
409.633	an old Melvin Van Peebles film, we could.
413.348	"If we wanted to show ""Car Wash,"" we could."
416.018	That would be awesome.
417.991	The building we soon outgrew,
420.546	and we had to move to a larger space.
423.053	Black Cinema House, which was made
423.053	from just a small piece of clay,
427.488	had to grow into a much larger
427.488	piece of clay, which is now my studio.
434.779	What I realized was that
434.779	for those of you who are zoning junkies,
438.588	that some of the things that I was doing
440.582	in these buildings
440.582	that had been left behind,
443.881	they were not the uses by which
443.881	the buildings were built,
447.713	and that there are city policies that say,
449.941	"""Hey, a house that is residential"
449.941	"needs to stay residential."""
453.26	But what do you do in neighborhoods when
453.26	ain't nobody interested in living there?
458.067	That the people who have
458.067	the means to leave have already left?
462.011	What do we do with
462.011	these abandoned buildings?
464.498	And so I was trying
464.498	to wake them up using culture.
467.703	We found that that
467.703	was so exciting for folk,
470.706	and people were so responsive to the work,
470.706	that we had to then find bigger buildings.
475.271	By the time we found bigger buildings,
477.316	there was, in part, the resources 
477.316	necessary to think about those things.
481.569	In this bank that we called the Arts Bank,
481.569	it was in pretty bad shape.
485.901	There was about six feet
485.901	of standing water.
489.187	It was a difficult project to finance,
491.649	because banks weren't interested
491.649	in the neighborhood
494.079	because people weren't interested
494.079	in the neighborhood
496.641	because nothing had happened there.
498.742	It was dirt. It was nothing.
498.742	It was nowhere.
502.724	And so we just started imagining,
502.724	what else could happen in this building?
508.381	(Applause)
513.846	And so now that the rumor
513.846	of my block has spread,
516.615	and lots of people are starting to visit,
518.595	we've found that the bank
518.595	can now be a center
520.696	for exhibition, archives,
520.696	music performance,
523.908	and that there are people
523.908	who are now interested
526.686	in being adjacent to those buildings
526.686	because we brought some heat,
530.224	that we kind of made a fire.
532.677	One of the archives that we'll have there
532.677	is this Johnson Publishing Corporation.
536.926	We've also started to collect
536.926	memorabilia from American history,
540.525	from people who live
540.525	or have lived in that neighborhood.
544.356	Some of these images
544.356	are degraded images of black people,
548.094	kind of histories
548.094	of very challenging content,
551.368	and where better than a neighborhood
553.829	with young people who are constantly
553.829	asking themselves about their identity
558.099	to talk about some of the complexities
560.354	of race and class?
562.896	In some ways, the bank represents a hub,
566.623	that we're trying to create a pretty 
566.623	hardcore node of cultural activity,
571.975	and that if we could start
571.975	to make multiple hubs
574.842	and connect some cool
574.842	green stuff around there,
577.791	that the buildings that we've
577.791	purchased and rehabbed,
580.74	which is now around 60 or 70 units,
584.014	that if we could land
584.014	miniature Versailles on top of that,
589.447	and connect these buildings
589.447	by a beautiful greenbelt --
592.93	(Applause) --
595.855	that this place where people
595.855	never wanted to be
599.315	would become an important destination
601.776	for folk from all over
601.776	the country and world.
605.027	In some ways, it feels
605.027	very much like I'm a potter,
608.812	that we tackle the things
608.812	that are at our wheel,
612.225	we try with the skill that we have
614.488	to think about this next bowl
614.488	that I want to make.
619.028	And it went from a bowl to a singular
619.028	house to a block to a neighborhood
623.927	to a cultural district
623.927	to thinking about the city,
626.621	and at every point, there were things
626.621	that I didn't know that I had to learn.
630.707	I've never learned so much
630.707	about zoning law in my life.
633.749	I never thought I'd have to.
635.529	But as a result of that, I'm finding
635.529	that there's not just room
638.486	for my own artistic practice,
640.227	there's room for a lot of other
640.227	artistic practices.
643.803	So people started asking us,
645.382	"""Well, Theaster, how are you"
645.382	"going to go to scale?"""
647.853	"and, ""What's your sustainability plan?"""
649.988	(Laughter) (Applause)
654.739	And what I found was that
654.739	I couldn't export myself,
658.616	that what seems necessary
658.616	in cities like Akron, Ohio,
662.355	and Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana,
664.955	is that there are people in those places
664.955	who already believe in those places,
668.653	that are already dying
668.653	to make those places beautiful,
671.579	and that often, those people
671.579	who are passionate about a place
675.038	are disconnected from the resources
675.038	necessary to make cool things happen,
679.45	or disconnected from
679.45	a contingency of people
682.027	that could help make things happen.
683.908	So now, we're starting to give advice
683.908	around the country
688.2	on how to start with what you got,
690.345	how to start with the things
690.345	that are in front of you,
693.14	how to make something out of nothing,
695.517	how to reshape your world
695.517	at a wheel or at your block
700.045	or at the scale of the city.
702.53	Thank you so much.
704.225	(Applause)
711.695	June Cohen: Thank you. So I think
711.695	many people watching this
715.201	will be asking themselves
715.201	the question you just raised at the end:
718.406	How can they do this in their own city?
720.588	You can't export yourself.
722.209	Give us a few pages out of your playbook
722.209	about what someone who is inspired
725.882	about their city can do
725.882	to take on projects like yours?
728.772	Theaster Gates: One of the things
728.772	I've found that's really important
731.965	is giving thought to not just
731.965	the kind of individual project,
736.052	like an old house,
738.846	but what's the relationship
738.846	between an old house,
741.717	a local school, a small bodega,
744.875	and is there some kind of synergy
744.875	between those things?
747.871	Can you get those folk talking?
750.169	I've found that in cases
750.169	where neighborhoods have failed,
754.72	they still often have a pulse.
756.903	How do you identify the pulse
756.903	in that place, the passionate people,
760.362	and then how do you get folk
760.362	who have been fighting,
763.367	slogging for 20 years, reenergized
763.367	about the place that they live?
767.758	And so someone has to do that work.
770.219	If I were a traditional developer,
770.219	I would be talking about buildings alone,
774.492	and then putting
774.492	"a ""For Lease"" sign in the window."
778.439	I think that you actually
778.439	have to curate more than that,
781.086	that there's a way in which
781.086	you have to be mindful about,
783.784	what are the businesses
783.784	that I want to grow here?
786.84	And then, are there people
786.84	who live in this place
789.282	who want to grow those businesses with me?
791.302	Because I think it's not just
791.302	a cultural space or housing;
794.135	there has to be the recreation
794.135	of an economic core.
797.177	So thinking about those things
797.177	together feels right.
800.845	JC: It's hard to get people
800.845	to create the spark again
803.651	when people have been
803.651	slogging for 20 years.
805.698	Are there any methods you've found
805.698	that have helped break through?
808.815	TG: Yeah, I think that now
808.815	there are lots of examples
811.782	of folk who are doing amazing work,
813.616	but those methods are sometimes like,
813.616	when the media is constantly saying
818.051	that only violent things
818.051	happen in a place,
821.023	then based on your skill set
821.023	and the particular context,
824.32	what are the things that you can do
824.32	in your neighborhood
827.64	to kind of fight some of that?
829.765	So I've found that
829.765	if you're a theater person,
832.668	you have outdoor street theater festivals.
834.943	In some cases, we don't have
834.943	the resources in certain neighborhoods
838.867	to do things that are
838.867	a certain kind of splashy,
842.211	but if we can then find ways
842.211	of making sure that people
845.322	who are local to a place,
846.854	plus people who could be supportive
846.854	of the things that are happening locally,
850.686	when those people get together,
852.45	I think really amazing things can happen.
854.586	JC: So interesting.
856.072	And how can you make sure
856.072	that the projects you're creating
858.394	are actually for the disadvantaged
860.159	and not just for the sort of
860.159	vegetarian indie movie crowd
864.199	that might move in
864.199	to take advantage of them.
866.318	TG: Right on. So I think this is where
866.318	it starts to get into the thick weeds.
871.359	JC: Let's go there.
871.359	TG: Right now, Grand Crossing
873.996	is 99 percent black, or at least living,
876.993	and we know that maybe
876.993	who owns property in a place
880.313	is different from who walks
880.313	the streets every day.
882.774	So it's reasonable to say
882.774	that Grand Crossing is already
885.63	in the process of being something
885.63	different than it is today.
889.485	But are there ways to think about
889.485	housing trusts or land trusts
895.08	or a mission-based development
897.518	that starts to protect
897.518	some of the space that happens,
900.281	because when you have
900.281	7,500 empty lots in a city,
904.6	you want something to happen there,
906.551	but you need entities that are not
906.551	just interested in the development piece,
911.055	but entities that are interested
911.055	in the stabilization piece,
914.143	and I feel like often the developer piece
914.143	is really motivated,
917.649	but the other work of a kind
917.649	of neighborhood consciousness,
921.016	that part doesn't live anymore.
922.99	So how do you start to grow up
922.99	important watchdogs
927.796	that ensure that the resources
927.796	that are made available
930.518	to new folk that are coming in
931.954	are also distributed to folk
931.954	who have lived in a place for a long time.
935.346	JC: That makes so much sense.
935.346	One more question:
937.955	You make such a compelling case for beauty
937.955	and the importance of beauty and the arts.
942.002	There would be others who would argue
942.002	that funds would be better spent
945.28	on basic services for the disadvantaged.
948.484	How do you combat that viewpoint,
948.484	or come against it?
952.194	TG: I believe that beauty 
952.194	is a basic service.
954.694	(Applause)
962.333	Often what I have found is that
962.333	when there are resources
966.168	that have not been made available
966.168	to certain under-resourced cities
969.628	or neighborhoods or communities,
971.694	that sometimes culture is the thing
971.694	that helps to ignite,
976.397	and that I can't do everything,
979.037	but I think that there's a way in which
979.037	if you can start with culture
982.444	and get people kind of
982.444	reinvested in their place,
985.416	other kinds of adjacent
985.416	amenities start to grow,
989.689	and then people can make a demand
989.689	that's a poetic demand,
993.642	and the political demands that
993.642	are necessary to wake up our cities,
998.883	they also become very poetic.
1000.646	JC: It makes perfect sense to me.
1002.558	Theaster, thank you so much
1002.558	for being here with us today.
1005.225	Thank you. Theaster Gates.
