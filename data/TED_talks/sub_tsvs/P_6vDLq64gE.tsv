15.285	Okay, now I don't want
15.285	to alarm anybody in this room,
20.26	but it's just come to my attention
20.26	that the person to your right is a liar.
24.26	(Laughter)
26.26	Also, the person to your left is a liar.
29.26	Also the person sitting
29.26	in your very seats is a liar.
32.26	We're all liars.
34.26	What I'm going to do today
36.26	is I'm going to show you what the research
36.26	says about why we're all liars,
39.86	how you can become a liespotter
41.46	and why you might want
41.46	to go the extra mile
44.26	and go from liespotting to truth seeking,
47.26	and ultimately to trust building.
49.26	Now, speaking of trust,
52.26	ever since I wrote
52.26	"this book, ""Liespotting,"""
55.26	no one wants to meet me in person
55.26	anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
58.26	"They say, ""It's okay, we'll email you."""
61.26	(Laughter)
63.26	I can't even get
63.26	a coffee date at Starbucks.
67.26	"My husband's like, ""Honey, deception?"
69.26	Maybe you could have focused on cooking.
69.26	"How about French cooking?"""
72.475	So before I get started,
72.475	what I'm going to do
74.642	is I'm going to clarify my goal for you,
77.26	which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
79.26	Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,
81.26	those kids in the back of the room
81.26	"that are shouting, ""Gotcha! Gotcha!"
84.618	Your eyebrow twitched.
84.618	You flared your nostril.
87.26	I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'
87.26	"I know you're lying."""
90.26	No, liespotters are armed
92.26	with scientific knowledge
92.26	of how to spot deception.
95.26	They use it to get to the truth,
97.26	and they do what mature
97.26	leaders do everyday;
99.38	they have difficult conversations
99.38	with difficult people,
102.26	sometimes during very difficult times.
104.26	And they start up that path
104.26	by accepting a core proposition,
108.26	and that proposition is the following:
110.26	Lying is a cooperative act.
114.037	Think about it, a lie has no power
114.037	whatsoever by its mere utterance.
117.26	Its power emerges
119.26	when someone else agrees
119.26	to believe the lie.
121.38	So I know it may sound like tough love,
123.38	but look, if at some point
123.38	you got lied to,
127.26	it's because you agreed to get lied to.
129.26	Truth number one about lying:
129.26	Lying's a cooperative act.
132.26	Now not all lies are harmful.
134.26	Sometimes we're willing
134.26	participants in deception
137.26	for the sake of social dignity,
140.26	maybe to keep a secret that should
140.26	be kept secret, secret.
143.26	"We say, ""Nice song."""
145.26	"""Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."""
148.26	Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,
150.26	"""You know, I just fished"
150.26	that email out of my Spam folder.
153.26	"So sorry."""
156.26	But there are times when we are unwilling
156.26	participants in deception.
159.523	And that can have dramatic costs for us.
162.26	Last year saw 997 billion dollars
165.26	in corporate fraud alone
165.26	in the United States.
169.593	That's an eyelash
169.593	under a trillion dollars.
171.632	That's seven percent of revenues.
173.26	Deception can cost billions.
175.26	Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
178.26	Or in the case
178.26	of double agents and traitors,
181.26	like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,
183.26	lies can betray our country,
185.26	they can compromise our security,
185.26	they can undermine democracy,
188.284	they can cause the deaths
188.284	of those that defend us.
191.26	Deception is actually serious business.
194.26	This con man, Henry Oberlander,
194.26	he was such an effective con man,
198.26	British authorities say
200.26	he could have undermined the entire
200.26	banking system of the Western world.
203.76	And you can't find this guy on Google;
203.76	you can't find him anywhere.
206.96	He was interviewed once,
206.96	and he said the following.
209.46	"He said, ""Look, I've got one rule."""
211.16	And this was Henry's rule, he said,
213.26	"""Look, everyone is willing"
213.26	to give you something.
215.66	They're ready to give you something
215.66	"for whatever it is they're hungry for."""
219.256	And that's the crux of it.
220.66	If you don't want to be
220.66	deceived, you have to know,
223.113	what is it that you're hungry for?
224.813	And we all kind of hate to admit it.
227.26	We wish we were
227.26	better husbands, better wives,
230.26	smarter, more powerful, taller, richer --
234.26	the list goes on.
236.26	Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,
238.26	to connect our wishes and our fantasies
240.26	about who we wish we were,
240.26	how we wish we could be,
243.26	with what we're really like.
246.26	And boy are we willing to fill in
246.26	those gaps in our lives with lies.
249.523	On a given day, studies show
249.523	that you may be lied to
252.26	anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
254.26	Now granted, many of those are white lies.
257.26	But in another study,
259.26	it showed that strangers lied three times
261.26	within the first 10 minutes
261.26	of meeting each other.
263.665	(Laughter)
265.26	Now when we first hear
265.26	this data, we recoil.
268.26	We can't believe how prevalent lying is.
270.26	We're essentially against lying.
272.26	But if you look more closely,
272.26	the plot actually thickens.
276.26	We lie more to strangers
276.26	than we lie to coworkers.
279.26	Extroverts lie more than introverts.
283.26	Men lie eight times more about themselves
283.26	than they do other people.
288.26	Women lie more to protect other people.
291.26	If you're an average married couple,
294.26	you're going to lie to your spouse
294.26	in one out of every 10 interactions.
298.26	Now, you may think that's bad.
300.26	If you're unmarried,
300.26	that number drops to three.
302.57	Lying's complex.
304.26	It's woven into the fabric
304.26	of our daily and our business lives.
307.284	We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
309.26	We parse it out on an as-needed basis,
311.26	sometimes for very good reasons,
313.26	other times just because
313.26	we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
316.475	That's truth number two about lying.
318.26	We're against lying,
320.26	but we're covertly for it
322.26	in ways that our society has sanctioned
322.26	for centuries and centuries and centuries.
326.284	It's as old as breathing.
328.26	It's part of our culture,
328.26	it's part of our history.
330.713	Think Dante, Shakespeare,
330.713	the Bible, News of the World.
336.26	(Laughter)
338.26	Lying has evolutionary value
338.26	to us as a species.
340.57	Researchers have long known
340.57	that the more intelligent the species,
344.26	the larger the neocortex,
346.26	the more likely it is to be deceptive.
348.26	Now you might remember Koko.
350.26	Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla
350.26	who was taught sign language?
353.523	Koko was taught to communicate
353.523	via sign language.
356.26	Here's Koko with her kitten.
358.26	It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
361.26	Koko once blamed her pet kitten
361.26	for ripping a sink out of the wall.
365.26	(Laughter)
367.26	We're hardwired to become
367.26	leaders of the pack.
369.475	It's starts really, really early.
371.26	How early?
373.26	Well babies will fake a cry,
375.26	pause, wait to see who's coming
377.26	and then go right back to crying.
379.26	One-year-olds learn concealment.
381.26	(Laughter)
383.26	Two-year-olds bluff.
385.26	Five-year-olds lie outright.
387.26	They manipulate via flattery.
389.26	Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.
392.26	By the time you enter college,
394.26	you're going to lie to your mom
394.26	in one out of every five interactions.
397.66	By the time we enter this work world
397.66	and we're breadwinners,
400.56	we enter a world that is just cluttered
400.56	with Spam, fake digital friends,
404.26	partisan media,
406.26	ingenious identity thieves,
408.26	world-class Ponzi schemers,
410.26	a deception epidemic --
412.26	in short, what one author calls
412.26	a post-truth society.
417.261	It's been very confusing
417.261	for a long time now.
423.925	What do you do?
425.26	Well, there are steps we can take
425.26	to navigate our way through the morass.
429.26	Trained liespotters get to the truth
432.26	The rest of us,
432.26	we're only 54 percent accurate.
435.26	Why is it so easy to learn?
437.26	There are good liars and bad liars.
439.499	There are no real original liars.
441.16	We all make the same mistakes.
441.16	We all use the same techniques.
444.16	So what I'm going to do is I'm going
444.16	to show you two patterns of deception.
447.813	And then we're going
447.813	to look at the hot spots
450.036	and see if we can find them ourselves.
451.913	We're going to start with speech.
453.56	(Video) Bill Clinton:
453.56	I want you to listen to me.
455.918	I'm going to say this again.
457.36	I did not have sexual relations
457.36	with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
464.26	I never told anybody to lie,
464.26	not a single time, never.
468.26	And these allegations are false.
471.26	And I need to go back to work
471.26	for the American people.
473.856	Thank you.
475.856	(Applause)
478.26	Pamela Meyer: Okay,
478.26	what were the telltale signs?
481.26	Well first we heard what's known
481.26	as a non-contracted denial.
485.26	Studies show that people
485.26	who are overdetermined in their denial
488.284	will resort to formal rather
488.284	than informal language.
491.26	We also heard
491.26	"distancing language: ""that woman."""
494.26	We know that liars will unconsciously
494.26	distance themselves
496.999	from their subject,
498.26	using language as their tool.
501.26	Now if Bill Clinton had said,
501.26	"""Well, to tell you the truth ..."""
504.332	or Richard Nixon's favorite,
504.332	"""In all candor ..."""
506.647	he would have been a dead giveaway
508.36	for any liespotter that knows
510.26	that qualifying language, as it's called,
510.26	qualifying language like that,
513.713	further discredits the subject.
515.26	Now if he had repeated
515.26	the question in its entirety,
518.26	or if he had peppered his account
518.26	with a little too much detail --
522.26	and we're all really glad
522.26	he didn't do that --
524.475	he would have further discredited himself.
526.499	Freud had it right.
528.26	Freud said, look,
528.26	there's much more to it than speech:
531.26	"""No mortal can keep a secret."
534.26	If his lips are silent,
534.26	"he chatters with his fingertips."""
537.26	And we all do it no matter
537.26	how powerful you are.
540.26	We all chatter with our fingertips.
542.26	I'm going to show you
542.26	Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama
545.26	who's chattering with his fingertips.
548.26	(Laughter)
551.26	Now this brings us to our next pattern,
551.26	which is body language.
557.26	With body language,
557.26	here's what you've got to do.
560.26	You've really got to just throw
560.26	your assumptions out the door.
563.26	Let the science temper
563.26	your knowledge a little bit.
565.713	Because we think liars
565.713	fidget all the time.
568.26	Well guess what, they're known to freeze
568.26	their upper bodies when they're lying.
572.046	We think liars won't look you in the eyes.
574.26	Well guess what, they look
574.26	you in the eyes a little too much
577.16	just to compensate for that myth.
578.76	We think warmth and smiles
578.76	convey honesty, sincerity.
582.26	But a trained liespotter
582.26	can spot a fake smile a mile away.
586.26	Can you all spot the fake smile here?
590.26	You can consciously contract
590.26	the muscles in your cheeks.
595.26	But the real smile's in the eyes,
595.26	the crow's feet of the eyes.
598.26	They cannot be consciously contracted,
600.26	especially if you overdid the Botox.
602.26	Don't overdo the Botox;
602.26	nobody will think you're honest.
605.26	Now we're going to look at the hot spots.
607.26	Can you tell what's happening
607.26	in a conversation?
609.57	Can you start to find the hot spots
612.26	to see the discrepancies
614.26	between someone's words
614.26	and someone's actions?
616.475	Now, I know it seems really obvious,
618.26	but when you're having a conversation
618.26	with someone you suspect of deception,
623.26	attitude is by far the most overlooked
623.26	but telling of indicators.
626.36	An honest person
626.36	is going to be cooperative.
628.58	They're going to show
628.58	they're on your side.
630.652	They're going to be enthusiastic.
632.26	They're going to be willing and helpful
632.26	to getting you to the truth.
635.56	They're going to be willing
635.56	to brainstorm, name suspects,
638.36	provide details.
639.66	They're going to say,
641.26	"""Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll"
641.26	"that forged those checks."""
644.46	They're going to be infuriated
644.46	if they sense they're wrongly accused
647.76	throughout the entire course
647.76	of the interview, not just in flashes;
650.96	they'll be infuriated throughout
650.96	the entire course of the interview.
654.223	And if you ask someone honest
655.66	what should happen
655.66	to whomever did forge those checks,
658.26	an honest person is much more likely
660.06	to recommend strict rather
660.06	than lenient punishment.
663.26	Now let's say you're having
663.26	that exact same conversation
665.951	with someone deceptive.
667.26	That person may be withdrawn,
669.26	look down, lower their voice,
671.26	pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
673.26	Ask a deceptive person
673.26	to tell their story,
675.332	they're going to pepper it
675.332	with way too much detail
678.26	in all kinds of irrelevant places.
681.26	And then they're going to tell their story
681.26	in strict chronological order.
684.76	And what a trained interrogator does
686.56	is they come in and in very subtle ways
686.56	over the course of several hours,
690.26	they will ask that person
690.26	to tell that story backwards,
693.26	and then they'll watch them squirm,
695.26	and track which questions produce
695.26	the highest volume of deceptive tells.
698.713	Why do they do that?
698.713	Well, we all do the same thing.
701.26	We rehearse our words,
703.26	but we rarely rehearse our gestures.
705.26	"We say ""yes,"" we shake our heads ""no."""
707.26	We tell very convincing stories,
707.26	we slightly shrug our shoulders.
710.38	We commit terrible crimes,
712.26	and we smile at the delight
712.26	in getting away with it.
715.26	Now, that smile is known
715.26	"in the trade as ""duping delight."""
718.26	And we're going to see that
718.26	in several videos moving forward,
721.26	but we're going to start --
721.26	for those of you who don't know him,
724.36	this is presidential
724.36	candidate John Edwards
726.46	who shocked America by fathering
726.46	a child out of wedlock.
729.26	We're going to see him talk
729.26	about getting a paternity test.
732.26	See now if you can spot him
732.26	"saying, ""yes"" while shaking his head ""no,"""
736.284	slightly shrugging his shoulders.
738.26	(Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy
738.26	to participate in one.
740.96	I know that it's not possible
740.96	that this child could be mine,
743.86	because of the timing of events.
745.46	So I know it's not possible.
747.26	Happy to take a paternity test,
747.26	and would love to see it happen.
751.26	Interviewer: Are you going to do
751.26	that soon? Is there somebody --
754.332	JE: Well, I'm only one side.
754.332	I'm only one side of the test.
757.26	But I'm happy to participate in one.
761.055	PM: Okay, those head shakes
761.055	are much easier to spot
763.513	once you know to look for them.
765.06	There are going to be times
765.06	when someone makes one expression
769.06	while masking another that just
769.06	kind of leaks through in a flash.
772.26	Murderers are known to leak sadness.
774.26	Your new joint venture partner
774.26	might shake your hand,
776.86	celebrate, go out to dinner with you
776.86	and then leak an expression of anger.
781.26	And we're not all going to become
781.26	facial expression experts overnight here,
784.86	but there's one I can teach you
784.86	that's very dangerous
787.362	and it's easy to learn,
788.599	and that's the expression of contempt.
790.46	Now with anger, you've got
790.46	two people on an even playing field.
793.484	It's still somewhat
793.484	of a healthy relationship.
795.699	But when anger turns to contempt,
795.699	you've been dismissed.
799.26	It's associated with moral superiority.
801.26	And for that reason, it's very,
801.26	very hard to recover from.
804.26	Here's what it looks like.
806.26	It's marked by one lip corner
806.26	pulled up and in.
810.26	It's the only asymmetrical expression.
813.26	And in the presence of contempt,
813.26	whether or not deception follows --
817.26	and it doesn't always follow --
819.26	look the other way,
819.26	go the other direction,
821.332	reconsider the deal,
823.26	"say, ""No thank you. I'm not coming up"
823.26	"for just one more nightcap. Thank you."""
827.26	Science has surfaced
827.26	many, many more indicators.
831.26	We know, for example,
833.26	we know liars will shift their blink rate,
835.284	point their feet towards an exit.
837.26	They will take barrier objects
839.26	and put them between themselves
839.26	and the person that is interviewing them.
842.713	They'll alter their vocal tone,
844.26	often making their vocal tone much lower.
847.26	Now here's the deal.
849.26	These behaviors are just behaviors.
852.26	They're not proof of deception.
854.26	They're red flags.
856.26	We're human beings.
858.26	We make deceptive flailing gestures
858.26	all over the place all day long.
861.56	They don't mean anything
861.56	in and of themselves.
863.775	But when you see clusters
863.775	of them, that's your signal.
866.36	Look, listen, probe,
866.36	ask some hard questions,
869.26	get out of that very comfortable
869.26	mode of knowing,
872.26	walk into curiosity mode,
872.26	ask more questions,
875.26	have a little dignity, treat the person
875.26	you're talking to with rapport.
878.66	Don't try to be like those folks
878.66	"on ""Law &amp; Order"" and those other TV shows"
882.26	that pummel their subjects
882.26	into submission.
884.332	Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
887.379	Now, we've talked a little bit
887.379	about how to talk to someone who's lying
890.76	and how to spot a lie.
892.26	And as I promised, we're now going
892.26	to look at what the truth looks like.
895.76	But I'm going to show you two videos,
897.56	two mothers -- one is lying,
897.56	one is telling the truth.
900.26	And these were surfaced by researcher
900.26	David Matsumoto in California.
904.38	And I think they're an excellent example
904.38	of what the truth looks like.
908.26	This mother, Diane Downs,
910.26	shot her kids at close range,
912.26	drove them to the hospital
912.26	while they bled all over the car,
916.26	claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
918.26	And you'll see when you see the video,
920.26	she can't even pretend
920.26	to be an agonizing mother.
922.618	What you want to look for here
922.618	is an incredible discrepancy
926.26	between horrific events that she describes
926.26	and her very, very cool demeanor.
930.26	And if you look closely, you'll see
930.26	duping delight throughout this video.
933.76	(Video) Diane Downs:
933.76	At night when I close my eyes,
936.26	I can see Christie reaching
936.26	her hand out to me while I'm driving,
939.38	and the blood just kept
939.38	coming out of her mouth.
941.66	And that -- maybe
941.66	it'll fade too with time --
943.827	but I don't think so.
945.26	That bothers me the most.
955.26	PM: Now I'm going to show you a video
957.26	of an actual grieving mother,
957.26	Erin Runnion,
959.332	confronting her daughter's murderer
959.332	and torturer in court.
963.26	Here you're going to see no false emotion,
965.284	just the authentic expression
965.284	of a mother's agony.
968.26	(Video) Erin Runnion:
968.26	I wrote this statement
970.375	on the third anniversary
970.375	of the night you took my baby,
973.06	and you hurt her,
974.36	and you crushed her,
976.26	you terrified her until her heart stopped.
980.26	And she fought, and I know she fought you.
983.26	But I know she looked at you
983.26	with those amazing brown eyes,
987.26	and you still wanted to kill her.
990.26	And I don't understand it,
992.26	and I never will.
995.91	PM: Okay, there's no doubting
995.91	the veracity of those emotions.
999.26	Now the technology
999.26	around what the truth looks like
1002.26	is progressing on, the science of it.
1005.26	We know, for example,
1007.26	that we now have specialized eye trackers
1007.26	and infrared brain scans,
1010.427	MRI's that can decode the signals
1010.427	that our bodies send out
1013.26	when we're trying to be deceptive.
1015.26	And these technologies are going
1015.26	to be marketed to all of us
1018.26	as panaceas for deceit,
1020.26	and they will prove
1020.26	incredibly useful some day.
1023.26	But you've got to ask yourself
1023.26	in the meantime:
1025.523	Who do you want on your side
1025.523	of the meeting,
1027.643	someone who's trained
1027.643	in getting to the truth
1030.26	or some guy who's going to drag
1030.26	a 400-pound electroencephalogram
1033.36	through the door?
1034.66	Liespotters rely on human tools.
1038.26	They know, as someone once said,
1040.26	"""Character's who you are in the dark."""
1042.26	And what's kind of interesting
1042.26	is that today, we have so little darkness.
1046.26	Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
1049.26	It's transparent
1049.26	with blogs and social networks
1053.26	broadcasting the buzz
1053.26	of a whole new generation of people
1055.96	that have made a choice to live
1055.96	their lives in public.
1058.56	It's a much more noisy world.
1062.26	So one challenge we have is to remember,
1066.26	oversharing, that's not honesty.
1069.26	Our manic tweeting and texting
1069.26	can blind us
1073.26	to the fact that the subtleties
1073.26	of human decency -- character integrity --
1076.86	that's still what matters,
1076.86	that's always what's going to matter.
1079.932	So in this much noisier world,
1081.46	it might make sense for us
1083.26	to be just a little bit more explicit
1083.26	about our moral code.
1088.26	When you combine the science
1088.26	of recognizing deception
1090.86	with the art of looking, listening,
1092.56	you exempt yourself
1092.56	from collaborating in a lie.
1095.26	You start up that path
1095.26	of being just a little bit more explicit,
1099.26	because you signal to everyone around you,
1101.284	"you say, ""Hey, my world, our world,"
1101.284	it's going to be an honest one.
1106.26	My world is going to be
1106.26	one where truth is strengthened
1108.904	and falsehood is recognized
1108.904	"and marginalized."""
1111.26	And when you do that,
1113.26	the ground around you starts
1113.26	to shift just a little bit.
1116.26	And that's the truth. Thank you.
1119.26	(Applause)
