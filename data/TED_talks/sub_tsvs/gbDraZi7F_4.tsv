13.232	So, I'm afraid.
15.438	Right now,
16.916	on this stage,
18.461	I feel fear.
20.919	In my life, I ain't met many people
22.646	that will readily admit
22.646	when they are afraid.
25.418	And I think that's because deep down,
27.485	they know how easy it spreads.
30.288	See, fear is like a disease.
32.732	When it moves, it moves like wildfire.
35.732	But what happens when,
37.334	even in the face of that fear,
39.108	you do what you've got to do?
41.114	That's called courage.
43.174	And just like fear,
44.881	courage is contagious.
47.69	See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.
49.963	That's a small city
51.147	across the Mississippi River
51.147	from St. Louis, Missouri.
53.985	I have lived in and around
53.985	St. Louis my entire life.
60.263	When Michael Brown, Jr.,
61.591	an ordinary teenager,
62.867	was gunned down by police in 2014
62.867	in Ferguson, Missouri --
67.441	another suburb, but north of St. Louis --
70.624	I remember thinking,
72.181	he ain't the first,
73.964	and he won't be the last young kid
73.964	to lose his life to law enforcement.
78.308	But see, his death was different.
80.885	When Mike was killed,
82.232	I remember the powers that be
82.232	trying to use fear as a weapon.
87	The police response to a community
87	in mourning was to use force
90.552	to impose fear:
92.564	fear of militarized police,
94.733	imprisonment,
95.986	fines.
97.179	The media even tried
97.179	to make us afraid of each other
99.723	by the way they spun the story.
101.299	And all of these things
101.299	have worked in the past.
103.682	But like I said,
103.682	this time it was different.
107.484	Michael Brown's death and the subsequent
107.484	treatment of the community
110.882	led to a string of protests in and around
110.882	Ferguson and St. Louis.
115.38	When I got out to those protests
115.38	about the fourth or fifth day,
119.169	it was not out of courage;
121.187	it was out of guilt.
123.315	See, I'm black.
125.043	I don't know if y'all noticed that.
126.812	(Laughter)
127.861	But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,
127.861	minutes away from Ferguson,
133.362	and not go see.
134.855	So I got off my ass to go check it out.
137.321	When I got out there,
138.785	I found something surprising.
142.47	I found anger; there was a lot of that.
145.327	But what I found more of was love.
148.565	People with love for themselves.
150.497	Love for their community.
152.161	And it was beautiful --
153.874	until the police showed up.
156.495	Then a new emotion was interjected
156.495	into the conversation:
160.815	fear.
162.447	Now, I'm not going to lie;
164.156	when I saw those armored vehicles,
166.974	and all that gear
168.159	and all those guns
169.549	and all those police
171.334	I was terrified --
172.821	personally.
175.791	And when I looked around that crowd,
177.569	I saw a lot of people that had
177.569	the same thing going on.
180.355	But I also saw people
180.355	with something else inside of them.
184.05	That was courage.
185.667	See, those people yelled,
187.069	and they screamed,
188.335	and they were not about
188.335	to back down from the police.
190.911	They were past that point.
192.583	And then I could feel
192.583	something in me changing,
194.858	so I yelled and I screamed,
197.309	and I noticed that everybody around me
197.309	was doing the same thing.
201.647	And there was nothing like that feeling.
204.843	So I decided I wanted
204.843	to do something more.
207.425	I went home, I thought:
207.425	I'm an artist. I make shit.
210.753	So I started making things
210.753	specific to the protest,
215.912	things that would be weapons
215.912	in a spiritual war,
220.257	things that would give people voice
223.291	and things that would fortify them
223.291	for the road ahead.
226.874	I did a project where I took pictures
226.874	of the hands of protesters
230.311	and put them up and down
230.311	the boarded-up buildings
234.325	and community shops.
236.69	My goal was to raise awareness
236.69	and to raise the morale.
240.334	And I think, for a minute at least,
242.759	it did just that.
245.77	Then I thought, I want to uplift
245.77	the stories of these people
249.334	I was watching being
249.334	courageous in the moment.
252.258	And myself and my friend,
255.95	and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan
257.946	did just that with our documentary,
260.148	"""Whose Streets?"""
263.316	I kind of became a conduit
265.452	for all of this courage
265.452	that was given to me.
268.998	And I think that's part
268.998	of our job as artists.
272.836	I think we should be conveyors
272.836	of courage in the work that we do.
277.154	And I think that we are the wall
277.154	between the normal folks
281.46	and the people that use their power
281.46	to spread fear and hate,
284.94	especially in times like these.
288.257	So I'm going to ask you.
290.082	Y'all the movers and the shakers,
292.37	you know, the thought leaders:
294.448	What are you gonna do
296.312	with the gifts that you've been given
298.359	to break us from the fear
298.359	the binds us every day?
301.58	Because, see, I'm afraid every day.
304.304	I can't remember a time when I wasn't.
307.126	But once I figured out that fear
307.126	was not put in me to cripple me,
311.393	it was there to protect me,
313.624	and once I figured out
313.624	how to use that fear,
316.644	I found my power.
318.926	Thank you.
320.146	(Applause)
