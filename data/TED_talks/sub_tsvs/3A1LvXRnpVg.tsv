15.885	I love my food.
17.635	And I love information.
20.441	My children usually tell me
23.756	that one of those passions is a little more apparent than the other.
27.218	(Laughter)
29.302	But what I want to do in the next eight minutes or so
31.552	is to take you through how those passions developed,
33.76	the point in my life when the two passions merged,
37.12	the journey of learning that took place from that point.
42.085	And one idea I want to leave you with today
44.881	is what would would happen differently in your life
47.487	if you saw information the way you saw food?
52.129	I was born in Calcutta --
54.3	a family where my father and his father before him
58.135	were journalists,
59.862	and they wrote magazines in the English language.
62.885	That was the family business.
65.093	And as a result of that,
66.843	I grew up with books everywhere around the house.
69.802	And I mean books everywhere around the house.
73.247	And that's actually a shop in Calcutta,
75.718	but it's a place where we like our books.
79.22	In fact, I've got 38,000 of them now
82.522	and no Kindle in sight.
85	But growing up as a child with the books around everywhere,
90.415	with people to talk to about those books,
92.937	this wasn't a sort of slightly learned thing.
96.008	By the time I was 18, I had a deep passion for books.
99.518	It wasn't the only passion I had.
102.039	I was a South Indian
104.173	brought up in Bengal.
106.32	And two of the things about Bengal:
108.8	they like their savory dishes
111.312	and they like their sweets.
113.124	So by the time I grew up,
114.895	again, I had a well-established passion for food.
118.55	Now I was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s,
121.706	and there were a number of other passions I was also interested in,
125.166	but these two were the ones that differentiated me.
128.483	(Laughter)
129.843	And then life was fine, dandy.
132.694	Everything was okay,
134.352	until I got to about the age of 26,
138.231	"and I went to a movie called ""Short Circuit."""
141.843	Oh, some of you have seen it.
143.843	And apparently it's being remade right now
147.218	and it's going to be coming out next year.
149.247	It's the story of this experimental robot
152.666	which got electrocuted and found a life.
155.623	"And as it ran, this thing was saying, ""Give me input. Give me input."""
159.76	And I suddenly realized that for a robot
162.264	both information as well as food
165.733	were the same thing.
167.927	Energy came to it in some form or shape,
170.552	data came to it in some form or shape.
172.689	And I began to think,
175.135	I wonder what it would be like
176.885	to start imagining myself
179.329	as if energy and information were the two things I had as input --
183.71	as if food and information were similar in some form or shape.
187.767	I started doing some research then, and this was the 25-year journey,
191.158	and started finding out
192.587	that actually human beings as primates
196.295	have far smaller stomachs
198.91	than should be the size for our body weight
202.144	and far larger brains.
205.079	And as I went to research that even further,
208.373	I got to a point where I discovered something
211.968	called the expensive tissue hypothesis.
215.362	That actually for a given body mass of a primate
219.452	the metabolic rate was static.
222.015	What changed was the balance of the tissues available.
225.773	And two of the most expensive tissues in our human body
229.393	are nervous tissue and digestive tissue.
233.162	And what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis
237.339	that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995.
241.844	It's a lady named Leslie Aiello.
244.802	And the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other.
249.594	If you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large,
253.302	you had to live with a smaller gut.
256.449	That then set me off completely
259.283	to say, Okay, these two are connected.
262.003	So I looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food
266.189	and said, So we were hunter-gathers of information.
269.01	We moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information.
273.385	Does that really explain what we're seeing
275.135	with the intellectual property battles nowadays?
277.885	Because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin
281.218	wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted,
284.885	and those that were in the business of farming information
287.51	wanted to build fences around it,
289.885	create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement.
293.556	So there was always going to be a tension within that.
296.52	And everything I saw in the cultivation
298.577	said there were huge fights amongst the foodies
301.135	between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.
303.362	And this is happening here.
305.677	When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true,
308.558	expect that there were two schools.
310.885	One group of people said you can distill your information,
313.968	you can extract value, separate it and serve it up,
317.343	while another group turned around
319.087	and said no, no you can ferment it.
320.824	You bring it all together and mash it up
323.489	and the value emerges that way.
325.578	The same is again true with information.
328.239	But consumption was where it started getting really enjoyable.
331.958	Because what I began to see then
334.315	was there were so many different ways people would consume this.
337.76	They'd buy it from the shop as raw ingredients.
340.248	Do you cook it? Do you have it served to you?
342.389	Do you go to a restaurant?
344.077	The same is true every time as I started thinking about information.
347.851	The analogies were getting crazy --
350.364	that information had sell-by dates,
353.06	that people had misused information that wasn't dated properly
357.01	and could really make an effect on the stock market,
359.343	on corporate values, etc.
361.746	And by this time I was hooked.
364.142	And this is about 23 years into this process.
367.137	And I began to start thinking of myself
369.427	as we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction,
372.898	docu-dramas, mockumentaries, whatever you call it.
376.385	Are we going to reach the stage
377.845	where information has a percentage for fact associated with it?
382.403	We start labeling information for the fact percentage?
385.84	Are we going to start looking at what happens
388.468	when your information source is turned off, as a famine?
392.047	Which brings me to the final element of this.
394.614	Clay Shirky once stated that there is no such animal as information overload,
397.76	there is only filter failure.
400.927	I put it to you that information,
403.552	if viewed from the point of food,
405.949	is never a production issue; you never speak of food overload.
409.835	Fundamentally it's a consumption issue.
412.031	And we have to start thinking
414.052	about how we create diets within ourselves, exercise within ourselves,
419.433	to have the faculties to be able to deal with information,
421.968	to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly.
425.718	"In fact, when I saw ""Supersize Me,"" I starting thinking of saying,"
429.552	What would happen
431.51	if an individual had 31 days nonstop Fox News?
435.704	(Laughter)
437.068	Would there be time to be able to work with it?
439.97	So you start really understanding
442.933	that you can have diseases, toxins, a need to balance your diet,
449.287	and once you start looking, and from that point on,
452.198	everything I have done in terms of the consumption of information,
455.885	the production of information, the preparation of information,
459.215	I've looked at from the viewpoint of food.
462.748	It has probably not helped my waistline any
465.218	because I like practicing on both sides.
467.706	But I'd like to leave you with just that question:
471.427	If you began to think of all the information that you consume
474.41	the way you think of food,
475.993	what would you do differently?
477.767	Thank you very much for your time.
479.968	(Applause)
