12.88	You are a high-ranking
12.88	military service member
16.28	deployed to Afghanistan.
19.84	You are responsible for the lives
22.4	of hundreds of men and women,
24.56	and your base is under attack.
27.855	Incoming mortar rounds
27.855	are exploding all around you.
32.08	Struggling to see
32.08	through the dust and the smoke,
35.4	you do your best to assist the wounded
38.04	and then crawl to a nearby bunker.
41.309	Conscious but dazed by the blasts,
44.04	you lay on your side and attempt
44.04	to process what has just happened.
49.8	As you regain your vision,
52.16	you see a bloody face
54.44	staring back at you.
57.48	The image is terrifying,
60.36	but you quickly come to understand
62.88	it's not real.
66.24	This vision continues to visit you
66.24	multiple times a day and in your sleep.
71.36	You choose not to tell anyone
71.36	for fear of losing your job
74.72	or being seen as weak.
78.08	You give the vision a name,
80	Bloody Face in Bunker,
82.12	and call it BFIB for short.
85.8	You keep BFIB locked away in your mind,
89.04	secretly haunting you,
90.84	for the next seven years.
95.68	Now close your eyes.
99.16	Can you see BFIB?
103.84	If you can, you're beginning
103.84	to see the face
106.4	of the invisible wounds of war,
108.84	commonly known
108.84	as post-traumatic stress disorder
111.72	and traumatic brain injury.
114.32	While I can't say I have
114.32	post-traumatic stress disorder,
117.04	I've never been a stranger to it.
119.8	When I was a little girl, I would visit
119.8	my grandparents every summer.
124.68	It was my grandfather
126	who introduced me to the effects
126	of combat on the psyche.
130.64	While my grandfather was serving
130.64	as a Marine in the Korean War,
134.36	a bullet pierced his neck
134.36	and rendered him unable to cry out.
139.28	He watched as a corpsman passed him over,
141.919	declaring him a goner,
143.48	and then leaving him to die.
146.96	Years later, after his
146.96	physical wounds had healed
149.6	and he'd returned home,
151.24	he rarely spoke of his
151.24	experiences in waking life.
155.88	But at night I would hear him
155.88	shouting obscenities
158.56	from his room down the hall.
161.08	And during the day I would announce myself
161.08	as I entered the room,
164.68	careful not to startle or agitate him.
168.88	He lived out the remainder of his days
171.44	isolated and tight-lipped,
173.56	never finding a way to express himself,
176.36	and I didn't yet
176.36	have the tools to guide him.
181.56	I wouldn't have a name
181.56	for my grandfather's condition
184.12	until I was in my 20s.
186.88	Seeking a graduate degree in art therapy,
189.96	I naturally gravitated
189.96	towards the study of trauma.
194.48	And while sitting in class learning
194.48	about post-traumatic stress disorder,
197.96	or PTSD for short,
200.32	my mission to help service members
200.32	who suffered like my grandfather
204.04	began to take form.
207.16	We've had various names
207.16	for post-traumatic stress
209.84	throughout the history of war:
212.48	homesickness,
214.4	soldier's heart,
216.6	shell shock,
218.64	thousand-yard stare, for instance.
221.76	And while I was pursuing my degree,
221.76	a new war was raging,
225.44	and thanks to modern body armor
225.44	and military vehicles,
228.68	service members were surviving
228.68	blast injuries they wouldn't have before.
233.8	But the invisible wounds
233.8	were reaching new levels,
236.64	and this pushed military doctors
236.64	and researchers
239.92	to try and truly understand the effects
239.92	that traumatic brain injury, or TBI,
245.24	and PTSD have on the brain.
248.76	Due to advances
248.76	in technology and neuroimaging,
252.16	we now know there's
252.16	an actual shutdown in the Broca's,
255.32	or the speech-language area of the brain,
255.32	after an individual experiences trauma.
261.4	This physiological change,
263.24	or speechless terror as it's often called,
266.36	coupled with mental health stigma,
268.68	the fear of being judged
270.44	or misunderstood,
271.92	possibly even removed
271.92	from their current duties,
274.6	has led to the invisible struggles
274.6	of our servicemen and women.
279.84	Generation after generation of veterans
283.44	have chosen not to talk
283.44	about their experiences,
286.72	and suffer in solitude.
290.96	I had my work cut out for me
290.96	when I got my first job
293.92	as an art therapist at the nation's
293.92	largest military medical center,
297.6	Walter Reed.
299.48	After working for a few years
299.48	on a locked-in patient psychiatric unit,
303.4	I eventually transferred to the National
303.4	Intrepid Center of Excellence, NICoE,
308.32	which leads TBI care
308.32	for active duty service members.
312.76	Now, I believed in art therapy,
314.96	but I was going to have
314.96	to convince service members,
318	big, tough, strong, manly military men,
321.76	and some women too,
323.52	to give art-making as
323.52	a psychotherapeutic intervention a try.
328.68	The results have been
328.68	nothing short of spectacular.
334	Vivid, symbolic artwork
336.4	is being created
336.4	by our servicemen and women,
339.4	and every work of art tells a story.
343.4	We've observed that the process
343.4	of art therapy bypasses
346.16	the speech-language issue with the brain.
349.04	Art-making accesses the same sensory
349.04	areas of the brain that encode trauma.
354.48	Service members can use the art-making
354.48	to work through their experiences
357.96	in a nonthreatening way.
360.28	They can then apply words
360.28	to their physical creations,
363.2	reintegrating the left
363.2	and the right hemispheres of the brain.
368.52	Now, we've seen this can work
368.52	with all forms of art --
372.12	drawing, painting, collage --
375.4	but what seems to have the most impact
378.68	is mask-making.
381.12	Finally, these invisible wounds
381.12	don't just have a name,
385.8	they have a face.
389.28	And when service members
389.28	create these masks,
391.48	it allows them to come to grips,
391.48	literally, with their trauma.
395.68	And it's amazing
395.68	how often that enables them
398	to break through the trauma
398	and start to heal.
402.8	Remember BFIB?
406.32	That was a real experience
406.32	for one of my patients,
409.36	and when he created his mask,
410.84	he was able to let go
410.84	of that haunting image.
414.8	Initially, it was a daunting process
414.8	for the service member,
417.96	but eventually he began
417.96	to think of BFIB as the mask,
420.96	not his internal wound,
422.64	and he would go to leave each session,
424.52	he would hand me the mask,
424.52	"and say, ""Melissa, take care of him."""
428.44	Eventually, we placed BFIB in a box
428.44	to further contain him,
432.76	and when the service member
432.76	went to leave the NICoE,
435.24	he chose to leave BFIB behind.
438.24	A year later, he had only seen BFIB twice,
440.92	and both times BFIB was smiling
442.64	and the service member
442.64	didn't feel anxious.
446	Now, whenever that service member
446	is haunted by some traumatic memory,
449.36	he continues to paint.
452	Every time he paints
452	these disturbing images,
454.64	he sees them less or not at all.
459	Philosophers have told us
459	for thousands of years
462.72	that the power to create
464	is very closely linked
464	to the power to destroy.
467.72	Now science is showing us
467.72	that the part of the brain
470.2	that registers a traumatic wound
472.24	can be the part of the brain
472.24	where healing happens too.
475.8	And art therapy is showing us
475.8	how to make that connection.
480.32	We asked one of our service members
482.24	to describe how mask-making
482.24	impacted his treatment,
485.6	and this is what he had to say.
487.76	(Video) Service Member:
487.76	You sort of just zone out into the mask.
490.84	You zone out into the drawing,
492.32	and for me, it just released the block,
496.92	so I was able to do it.
499.6	And then when I looked at it
499.6	after two days, I was like,
503.24	"""Holy crap, here's the picture,"
503.24	"here's the key, here's the puzzle,"""
506.6	and then from there it just soared.
508.68	I mean, from there
508.68	my treatment just when out of sight,
512.16	because they were like,
512.16	Kurt, explain this, explain this.
514.88	And for the first time in 23 years,
516.72	I could actually talk about stuff
516.72	openly to, like, anybody.
519.64	I could talk to you about it
519.64	right now if I wanted to,
522.76	because it unlocked it.
525.44	It's just amazing.
526.72	And it allowed me to put 23 years of PTSD
532.28	and TBI stuff together in one place
538.28	that has never happened before.
542.04	Sorry.
543.92	Melissa Walker: Over the past five years,
545.92	we've had over 1,000 masks made.
549.76	It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
552.64	Thank you.
553.88	(Applause)
559.44	I wish I could have shared
559.44	this process with my grandfather,
563.8	but I know that he would be thrilled
567.04	that we are finding ways
568.72	to help today's and tomorrow's
568.72	service members heal,
573.4	and finding the resources within them
576.64	that they can call upon
578.36	to heal themselves.
581.68	Thank you.
582.92	(Applause)
