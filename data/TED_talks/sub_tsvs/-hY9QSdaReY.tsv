13.163	Once there was a star.
16.082	Like everything else, she was born;
18.828	grew to be around 30 times
18.828	the mass of our sun
22.633	and lived for a very long time.
25.475	Exactly how long,
26.867	people cannot really tell.
29.162	Just like everything in life,
30.965	she reached the end
30.965	of her regular star days
34.438	when her heart, the core of her life,
37.039	exhausted its fuel.
38.905	But that was no end.
40.236	She transformed into a supernova,
40.236	and in the process
43.786	releasing a tremendous amount of energy,
46.464	outshining the rest of the galaxy
49.196	and emitting, in one second,
51.554	the same amount of energy
51.554	our sun will release in 10 days.
55.651	And she evolved
55.651	into another role in our galaxy.
59.783	Supernova explosions are very extreme.
62.638	But the ones that emit gamma rays
62.638	are even more extreme.
67.417	In the process of becoming a supernova,
69.73	the interior of the star collapses
69.73	under its own weight
73.177	and it starts rotating ever faster,
76.089	like an ice skater when pulling
76.089	their arms in close to their body.
80.592	In that way, it starts rotating very fast
80.592	and it increases, powerfully,
85.074	its magnetic field.
87.011	The matter around the star
87.011	is dragged around,
90.124	and some energy from that rotation
90.124	is transferred to that matter
93.466	and the magnetic field
93.466	is increased even further.
97.477	In that way, our star had extra energy
97.477	to outshine the rest of the galaxy
103.263	in brightness and gamma ray emission.
106.119	My star, the one in my story,
108.632	became what is known as a magnetar.
111.304	And just for your information,
113.009	the magnetic field of a magnetar
113.009	is 1,000 trillion times
116.914	the magnetic field of Earth.
119.953	The most energetic events
119.953	ever measured by astronomers
122.633	carry the name gamma-ray bursts
124.912	because we observe them
124.912	as bursts most or explosions,
128.543	most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.
131.886	Our star, like the one in our story
131.886	that became a magnetar,
136.115	is detected as a gamma-ray burst
138.21	during the most energetic
138.21	portion of the explosion.
142.167	Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts
142.167	are the strongest events
147.492	ever measured by astronomers,
149.605	we cannot see them with our naked eye.
152.266	We depend, we rely on other methods
154.618	in order to study this gamma-ray light.
157.431	We cannot see them with our naked eye.
159.302	We can only see
159.302	an itty bitty, tiny portion
162.396	of the electromagnetic spectrum
162.396	that we call visible light.
166.146	And beyond that, we rely on other methods.
168.442	Yet as astronomers,
168.442	we study a wider range of light
173.726	and we depend on other methods to do that.
176.514	On the screen, it may look like this.
179.812	You're seeing a plot.
181.568	That is a light curve.
183.517	It's a plot of intensity
183.517	of light over time.
187.09	It is a gamma-ray light curve.
190.013	Sighted astronomers
190.013	depend on this kind of plot
193.729	in order to interpret how
193.729	this light intensity changes over time.
198.933	On the left, you will be seeing
198.933	the light intensity without a burst,
204.473	and on the right, you will be seeing
204.473	the light intensity with the burst.
210.381	Early during my career,
210.381	I could also see this kind of plot.
214.562	But then, I lost my sight.
217.314	I completely lost my sight
217.314	because of extended illness,
220.49	and with it, I lost
220.49	the opportunity to see this plot
225.208	and the opportunity to do my physics.
229.672	It was a very strong transition
229.672	for me in many ways.
233.295	And professionally, it left me
233.295	without a way to do my science.
237.564	I longed to access and scrutinize
237.564	this energetic light
242.203	and figure out the astrophysical cause.
244.913	I wanted to experience
244.913	the spacious wonder, the excitement,
248.399	the joy produced by the detection
248.399	of such a titanic celestial event.
253.352	I thought long and hard about it,
256.676	when I suddenly realized
256.676	that all a light curve is,
260.385	is a table of numbers
260.385	converted into a visual plot.
264.861	So along with my collaborators,
266.786	we worked really hard and we translated
266.786	the numbers into sound.
271.765	I achieved access to the data,
273.793	and today I'm able to do physics
273.793	at the level of the best astronomer,
278.83	using sound.
280.005	And what people have been able to do,
282.657	mainly visually,
283.834	for hundreds of years,
285.202	now I do it using sound.
287.892	(Applause)
288.953	Listening to this gamma-ray burst
290.679	that you're seeing on the --
290.679	(Applause continues)
293.023	Thank you.
294.198	Listening to this burst
294.198	that you're seeing on the screen
296.93	brought something to the ear
296.93	beyond the obvious burst.
299.973	Now I'm going to play the burst for you.
301.932	It's not music, it's sound.
305.264	(Digital beeping sounds)
308.539	This is scientific data
308.539	converted into sound,
311.854	and it's mapped in pitch.
313.112	The process is called sonification.
318.958	So listening to this
318.958	brought something to the ear
321.292	besides the obvious burst.
322.665	When I examine the very strong
322.665	low-frequency regions,
327.21	or bass line -- I'm zooming
327.21	into the bass line now.
333.5	We noted resonances characteristic
333.5	of electrically charged gasses
339.043	like the solar wind.
340.669	And I want you to hear what I heard.
343.196	You will hear it as a very fast
343.196	decrease in volume.
347.001	And because you're sighted,
347.001	I'm giving you a red line
349.788	indicating what intensity of light
349.788	is being converted into sound.
355.672	(Digital hum and whistling sound)
358.11	The (Whistles) is frogs at home,
358.11	don't pay attention to that.
361.428	(Laughter)
363.298	(Digital hum and whistling sound)
368.549	I think you heard it, right?
371.503	So what we found
372.804	is that the bursts last long enough
372.804	in order to support wave resonances,
377.742	which are things caused by exchanges
377.742	of energy between particles
381.983	that may have been excited,
383.325	that depend on the volume.
385.151	You may remember that I said
385.151	that the matter around the star
388.265	is dragged around?
389.945	It transmits power with frequency
389.945	and field distribution
393.783	determined by the dimensions.
396.434	You may remember that we were talking
396.434	about a super-massive star
400.408	that became a very strong
400.408	magnetic field magnetar.
404.264	If this is the case, then outflows
404.264	from the exploding star
408.661	may be associated
408.661	with this gamma-ray burst.
411.168	What does that mean?
412.76	That star formation
412.76	may be a very important part
415.751	of these supernova explosions.
418.047	Listening to this very gamma-ray burst
418.047	brought us to the notion
422.458	that the use of sound
422.458	as an adjunctive visual display
425.281	may also support sighted astronomers
427.53	in the search for more
427.53	information in the data.
430.562	Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing
430.562	measurements from other telescopes,
435.904	and my experiments demonstrated
438.131	that when you use sound
438.131	as an adjunctive visual display,
442.369	astronomers can find more information
445.309	in this now more accessible data set.
449.086	This ability to transform data into sound
452.854	gives astronomy a tremendous
452.854	power of transformation.
456.381	And the fact that a field
456.381	that is so visual may be improved
460.346	in order to include anyone with interest
460.346	in understanding what lies in the heavens
465.043	is a spirit-lifter.
467.39	When I lost my sight,
469.303	I noticed that I didn't have access
471.403	to the same amount
471.403	and quality of information
474.053	a sighted astronomer had.
476.22	It was not until we innovated
476.22	with the sonification process
479.724	that I regained the hope
479.724	to be a productive member of the field
483.7	that I had worked so hard to be part of.
487.429	Yet, information access
487.429	is not the only area in astronomy
491.904	where this is important.
494.602	The situation is systemic
497.15	and scientific fields are not keeping up.
500.825	The body is something changeable --
503.501	anyone may develop
503.501	a disability at any point.
506.89	Let's think about, for example,
509.152	scientists that are already
509.152	at the top of their careers.
511.963	What happens to them
511.963	if they develop a disability?
514.827	Will they feel excommunicated as I did?
517.839	Information access
517.839	empowers us to flourish.
521.499	It gives us equal opportunities
521.499	to display our talents
525.123	and choose what we want
525.123	to do with our lives,
528.01	based on interest and not based
528.01	on potential barriers.
532.294	When we give people the opportunity
532.294	to succeed without limits,
536.685	that will lead to personal fulfillment
536.685	and prospering life.
541.267	And I think that the use
541.267	of sound in astronomy
543.724	is helping us to achieve that
543.724	and to contribute to science.
548.119	While other countries told me
548.119	that the study of perception techniques
552.675	in order to study astronomy data
552.675	is not relevant to astronomy
556.276	because there are no blind
556.276	astronomers in the field,
559.5	"South Africa said, ""We want"
559.5	people with disabilities
562.928	"to contribute to the field."""
564.928	Right now, I'm working
566.278	at the South African
566.278	Astronomical Observatory,
569.034	at the Office of Astronomy
569.034	for Development.
572.436	There, we are working on sonification
572.436	techniques and analysis methods
577.201	to impact the students
577.201	of the Athlone School for the Blind.
581.603	These students will be learning
581.603	radio astronomy,
584.113	and they will be learning
584.113	the sonification methods
587.375	in order to study astronomical events
587.375	like huge ejections of energy
591.87	from the sun, known as
591.87	coronal mass ejections.
595.194	What we learn with these students --
596.977	these students have multiple disabilities
596.977	and coping strategies
600.798	that will be accommodated --
602.698	what we learn with these students
602.698	will directly impact
605.561	the way things are being done
605.561	at the professional level.
608.742	I humbly call this development.
610.825	And this is happening right now.
614.35	I think that science is for everyone.
618.275	It belongs to the people,
619.747	and it has to be available to everyone,
622.022	because we are all natural explorers.
624.956	I think that if we limit people
624.956	with disabilities
630.171	from participating in science,
632.024	we'll sever our links with history
632.024	and with society.
635.696	I dream of a level
635.696	scientific playing field,
639.166	where people encourage respect
639.166	and respect each other,
644.178	where people exchange strategies
644.178	and discover together.
647.81	If people with disabilities
647.81	are allowed into the scientific field,
652.131	an explosion, a huge titanic burst
652.131	of knowledge will take place,
656.864	I am sure.
661.251	(Digital beeping sounds)
663.124	That is the titanic burst.
666.42	Thank you.
667.595	Thank you.
668.77	(Applause)
