13.658	Imagine a place where your neighbors
13.658	greet your children by name;
19.628	a place with splendid vistas;
22.955	a place where you can drive
22.955	just 20 minutes
26.09	and put your sailboat on the water.
28.68	It's a seductive place, isn't it?
32.261	I don't live there.
33.881	(Laughter)
36.454	But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip
42.497	for two years, to the fastest-growing
42.497	and whitest counties in America.
50.732	What is a Whitopia?
52.82	I define Whitopia in three ways:
55.999	First, a Whitopia has posted at least
55.999	six percent population growth since 2000.
63.451	Secondly, the majority of that growth
63.451	comes from white migrants.
68.415	And third, the Whitopia
68.415	has an ineffable charm,
72.239	a pleasant look and feel,
74.818	a je Ne sais quoi.
76.35	(Laughter)
79.583	To learn how and why
79.583	Whitopias are ticking,
83.999	I immersed myself for several months
83.999	apiece in three of them:
89.446	first, St. George, Utah;
92.12	second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;
94.581	and third, Forsyth County, Georgia.
98.883	First stop, St. George --
98.883	a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.
104.433	In the 1850s, Brigham Young
104.433	dispatched families to St. George
109.81	to grow cotton because
109.81	of the hot, arid climate.
113.118	And so they called it Utah's Dixie,
113.118	and the name sticks to this day.
120.368	I approached my time in each Whitopia
120.368	like an anthropologist.
125.354	I made detailed spreadsheets of all
125.354	the power brokers in the communities,
129.999	who I needed to meet,
129.999	where I needed to be,
133.457	and I threw myself with gusto
133.457	in these communities.
136.699	I went to zoning board meetings,
138.999	I went to Democratic clubs
138.999	and Republican clubs.
142.786	I went to poker nights.
147.206	In St. George, I rented
147.206	a home at the Entrada,
152.142	one of the town's
152.142	premier gated communities.
155.278	There were no Motel 6's
155.278	or Howard Johnsons for me.
159.62	I lived in Whitopia as a resident,
159.62	and not like a visitor.
164.883	I rented myself this home by phone.
169.409	(Laughter)
171.972	(Applause)
173.361	Golf is the perfect seductive
173.361	symbol of Whitopia.
179.75	When I went on my journey,
181.584	I had barely ever held a golf club.
184.723	By the time I left, I was golfing
184.723	at least three times a week.
189.422	(Laughter)
192.133	Golf helps people bond.
195.093	Some of the best interviews I ever scored
195.093	during my trip were on the golf courses.
201.716	One venture capitalist, for example,
201.716	invited me to golf in his private club
207.199	that had no minority members.
210.933	I also went fishing.
212.432	(Laughter)
214.457	Because I had never fished,
214.457	this fellow had to teach me
217.497	how to cast my line and what bait to use.
222.55	I also played poker every weekend.
225.845	It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.
230.058	My poker mates may have been bluffing
230.058	about the hands that they drew,
234.341	but they weren't bluffing
234.341	about their social beliefs.
237.547	Some of the most raw,
237.547	salty conversations I ever had
241.174	during my journey were at the poker table.
244.951	I'm a gung ho entertainer.
248.14	I love to cook, I hosted
248.14	many dinner parties, and in return,
252.14	people invited me to their dinner parties,
255.312	and to their barbecues,
255.312	and to their pool parties,
257.994	and to their birthday parties.
261.385	But it wasn't all fun.
263.781	Immigration turned out to be
263.781	a big issue in this Whitopia.
268.167	The St. George's Citizens Council
268.167	on Illegal Immigration
271.605	held regular and active protests
271.605	against immigration,
275.723	and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia
275.723	is what a hot debate this would become.
281.648	It was a real-time preview,
281.648	and so it has become.
287.084	Next stop: Almost Heaven,
287.084	a cabin I rented for myself
292.451	in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful
292.451	North Idaho panhandle.
297.048	I rented this place
297.048	for myself, also by phone.
300.095	(Laughter)
302.53	"The book ""A Thousand Places To See"
302.53	"Before You Die"" lists Coeur d'Alene --"
307.374	it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen,
307.374	boatmen and fishermen.
313.031	My growing golf skills
313.031	came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.
316.088	I golfed with retired LAPD cops.
319.714	In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops
325.248	fled Los Angeles
325.248	after the L.A. racial unrest,
331.382	for North Idaho, and they've built
331.382	an expatriated community.
336.809	Given the conservatism of these cops,
339.846	there's no surprise that North Idaho
339.846	has a strong gun culture.
345.212	In fact, it is said, North Idaho
345.212	has more gun dealers than gas stations.
353.677	So what's a resident to do to fit in?
356.837	I hit the gun club.
358.942	When I rented a gun,
358.942	the gentleman behind the counter
362.361	was perfectly pleasant and kind,
364.999	until I showed him
364.999	my New York City driver's license.
368.999	That's when he got nervous.
371.767	I'm not as bad a shot
371.767	as I thought I might have been.
376.448	What I learned from North Idaho
376.448	is the peculiar brand of paranoia
382.928	that can permeate a community
382.928	when so many cops and guns are around.
390.07	In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,
394.801	I kept a notepad.
396.7	And in that notepad I counted
396.7	more Confederate flags than black people.
401.589	In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags
404.876	on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,
409.125	and on cars.
411.78	About a seven-minute drive
411.78	from my hidden lake cabin
415.249	was the compound of Aryan Nations,
418.09	the white supremacist group.
422.384	America's Promise Ministries,
422.384	the religious arm of Aryan Nations,
427.48	happened to have a three-day
427.48	retreat during my visit.
432.913	So I decided to crash it.
434.572	(Laughter)
437.208	I'm the only non-Aryan journalist
437.208	I'm aware of ever to have done so.
442.067	(Laughter)
443.153	Among the many memorable
443.153	episodes of that retreat...
447.79	(Laughter)
449.083	...is when Abe, an Aryan,
449.083	sidled up next to me.
452.999	"He slapped my knee, and he said, ""Hey"
452.999	Rich, I just want you to know one thing.
458.443	We are not white supremacists.
458.443	We are white separatists.
462.967	We don't think we're better than you,
464.865	"we just want to be away from you."""
466.578	(Laughter)
471.016	Indeed, most white people in Whitopia
471.016	are neither white supremacists
478.035	or white separatists;
479.874	in fact, they're not there
479.874	for explicitly racial reasons at all.
484.14	Rather, they emigrate there
487.22	for friendliness, comfort,
487.22	security, safety --
490.952	reasons that they implicitly associate
490.952	to whiteness in itself.
497.064	Next stop was Georgia.
500.224	In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb
500.224	north of Atlanta.
505.027	In Utah, I found poker;
506.846	in Idaho, I found guns;
508.561	in Georgia, I found God.
510.139	(Laughter)
511.402	The way that I immersed myself
511.402	in this Whitopia
514.999	was to become active
514.999	at First Redeemer Church,
518.414	a megachurch that's so huge
518.414	that it has golf carts
521.942	to escort the congregants around
521.942	its many parking lots on campus.
527.758	I was active in the youth ministry.
530.491	And for me, personally,
530.491	I was more comfortable in this Whitopia
535.447	than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,
535.447	or even a suburban Boston.
540.999	That is because [there], in Georgia,
544.113	white people and black people are more
544.113	historically familiar to one another.
549.092	I was less exotic in this Whitopia.
551.912	(Laughter)
554.684	But what does it all mean?
557.042	Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration,
557.042	is a push-pull phenomenon,
562.447	full of alarming pushes
562.447	and alluring pulls,
566.612	and Whitopia operates at the level
566.612	of conscious and unconscious bias.
573.86	It's possible for people to be in Whitopia
573.86	not for racist reasons,
579.287	though it has racist outcomes.
583.704	Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,
587.572	social welfare abuse, minorities,
587.572	density, crowded schools.
593.113	Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit,
598.316	freedom, the allure of privatism --
598.316	privatized places, privatized people,
604.104	privatized things.
607.524	And I learned in Whitopia
607.524	how a country can have racism
613.136	without racists.
615.241	Many of my smug urban liberal friends
618.052	couldn't believe I would go
618.052	on such a venture.
621.447	The reality is that many white Americans
621.447	are affable and kind.
627.643	Interpersonal race relations --
627.643	how we treat each other as human beings --
632.436	are vastly better than in
632.436	my parents' generation.
637.162	Can you imagine me going
637.162	to Whitopia 40 years ago?
641.596	What a journey that would have been.
643.508	(Laughter)
645.29	And yet, some things haven't changed.
647.572	America is as residentially
647.572	and educationally segregated today
654.307	as it was in 1970.
659.523	As Americans, we often find ways
659.523	to cook for each other,
664.178	to dance with each other,
665.822	to host with each other,
667.719	but why can't that translate into how we
667.719	treat each other as communities?
673.235	It's a devastating irony,
675.379	how we have gone forward as individuals,
678.715	and backwards as communities.
683.766	One of the Whitopian outlooks
683.766	that really hit me
688.083	was a proverbial saying:
690.279	"""One black man is"
690.279	a delightful dinner guest;
700.879	One of the big contexts animating
700.879	my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.
708.668	By 2042, white people will no longer be
708.668	the American majority.
715.45	As such, will there be more Whitopias?
720.926	In looking at this,
722.637	the danger of Whitopia is
722.637	that the more segregation we have,
729.368	the less we can look at and confront
729.368	conscious and unconscious bias.
738.304	I ventured on my two-year,
742.689	to learn where, why, and how
742.689	white people are fleeing,
747.8	but I didn't expect to have
747.8	so much fun on my journey.
750.566	(Laughter)
751.597	I didn't expect to learn
751.597	so much about myself.
755.408	I don't expect I'll be living
755.408	in a Whitopia --
758.88	or a Blacktopia, for that matter.
761.792	I do plan to continue golfing
761.792	every chance I get.
765.225	(Laughter)
766.811	And I'll just have to leave the guns
766.811	and megachurches back in Whitopia.
772.714	Thank you.
773.89	(Applause)
