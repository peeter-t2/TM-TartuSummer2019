20.26	♫ My age is three hundred ♫
22.26	♫ and seventy-two ♫
25.26	♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫
30.26	♫ How I used to pick up
32.26	and voraciously chew ♫
35.26	♫ the dear little boys
38.26	that I met ♫
40.26	♫ I've eaten them raw
42.26	in their holiday suits, ♫
45.26	♫ Eaten them
47.26	curried with rice, ♫
51.26	♫ I've eaten them baked
53.26	in their jackets and boots, ♫
56.26	♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫
61.26	♫ But now that my jaws
63.26	are too weak for such fare, ♫
66.26	♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫
72.26	♫ To do such a thing
74.26	when I'm quite well aware ♫
77.26	♫ Little boys do not like
79.26	being chewed. ♫
81.26	♫ Little boys do not like
84.26	being chewed. ♫
86.26	(Music)
132.26	♫ So now I contentedly live upon eels, ♫
136.26	♫ And try to do nothing amiss ♫
142.26	♫ And pass all the time
144.26	I can spare from my meals ♫
147.26	♫ In innocent slumber like this, ♫
153.26	♫ Innocent slumber
157.26	like this. ♫
164.26	(Applause)
176.26	I suppose I owe you an explanation.
180.26	I've been working on a project for the last six years
182.26	adapting children's poetry to music.
184.26	And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,
187.26	who was a stockbroker in New York City
190.26	for 45 years,
192.26	but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.
195.26	And this book was one of the most famous books in America
198.26	for about 35 years.
200.26	"""The Sleepy Giant,"" which is the song that I just sang,"
204.26	is one of his poems.
206.26	Now, we're going to do
208.26	other poems for you,
210.26	and here's a preview of some of the poets.
212.26	This is Rachel Field,
216.26	Robert Graves --
218.26	a very young Robert Graves --
222.26	Christina Rossetti.
225.26	Ghosts, right?
228.26	Have nothing to say to us,
231.26	obsolete,
233.26	gone --
235.26	not so.
238.26	What I really enjoyed about this project
240.26	is reviving these people's words.
242.26	Taking them off the dead, flat pages.
244.26	Bringing them to life,
248.26	bringing them to light.
253.26	So, what we're going to do next
255.26	is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.
257.26	Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
260.26	When she was 10 years old in 1927,
263.26	she published her first book of poems
265.26	"called ""The Janitor's Boy."""
268.26	Here she is.
270.26	And here's her poem.
272.26	(Music)
277.26	♫ Oh, I'm in love
281.26	with the janitor's boy, ♫
285.26	♫ And the janitor's boy
289.26	is in love with me. ♫
294.26	♫ Oh, I'm in love
298.26	with the janitor's boy, ♫
302.26	♫ And the janitor's boy
306.26	is in love with me. ♫
311.26	♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫
315.26	♫ In our geography. ♫
319.26	♫ A desert isle
321.26	with spicy trees ♫
325.26	♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫
328.26	♫ A right nice place,
330.26	just fit for two ♫
333.26	♫ Where we can live always. ♫
338.26	♫ Oh, I'm in love
342.26	with the janitor's boy, ♫
346.26	♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫
350.26	he's busy as can be; ♫
355.26	♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫
358.26	♫ Out of an old settee. ♫
363.26	♫ He'll carry me off,
365.26	I know that he will, ♫
368.26	♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫
372.26	♫ And the only thing
374.26	that occurs to me ♫
376.26	♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫
380.26	♫ And on the day that we sail,
383.26	I will leave a little note ♫
385.26	♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫
389.26	"♫ ""I have flown to an island"
391.26	in the bay ♫
393.26	♫ With my janitor's
395.26	"red haired-boy."" ♫"
398.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
402.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
406.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
410.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
414.26	♫ I'm going to sail away ♫
416.26	♫ Gone to Sheepshead Bay ♫
418.26	♫ With my janitor's red-haired boy. ♫
422.26	♫ On an old settee ♫
424.26	♫ My red-haired boy and me ♫
427.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy. ♫
431.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
435.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
439.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
443.26	♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫
447.26	(Applause)
459.26	The next poem is by E.E. Cummings,
461.26	"""Maggie and Milly and Molly and May."""
468.26	(Music)
478.26	♫ Maggie and Milly,
481.26	Molly and May ♫
488.26	♫ They went down to the beach
492.26	one day to play ♫
499.26	♫ And Maggie discovered
502.26	a shell that sang ♫
509.26	♫ So sweetly she couldn't remember
515.26	her troubles ♫
522.26	♫ Maggie and Milly,
525.26	Molly and May ♫
532.26	♫ Maggie and Milly,
535.26	Molly and May ♫
543.26	♫ Milly befriended
545.26	a stranded star ♫

556.26	whose rays ♫
561.26	♫ Five languid fingers
564.26	were ♫
569.26	(Music)

632.26	♫ Molly was chased
634.26	by a horrible thing ♫
642.26	♫ Which raced
647.26	sideways blowing ♫
654.26	♫ Blowing ♫

670.26	♫ May came home
672.26	with a smooth, round stone ♫
680.26	♫ Small as a world
683.26	and as large as alone ♫
688.26	(Music)
712.26	♫ For whatever we lose

739.26	(Applause)
741.26	Thank you.
743.26	(Applause)
757.26	"The next poem is ""If No One Ever Marries Me."""
760.26	It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
763.26	She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter
766.26	who had made his fame in England.
769.26	He went there after the death
771.26	of his wife of smallpox
773.26	and brought his two young children.
775.26	One was his daughter, Laurence.
779.26	She wrote this poem when she was
783.26	and I look at it as kind of a
785.26	very sweet feminist manifesto
790.26	tinged with a little bit of defiance
793.26	and a little bit of resignation and regret.
799.26	(Music)
819.26	♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫
823.26	♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫
827.26	♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫
829.26	♫ And you know I'm seldom good,
832.26	seldom good -- ♫
840.26	♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫
844.26	♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫
848.26	♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫
851.26	♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫
854.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫
858.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫
862.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫
865.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫
869.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫
877.26	♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫
880.26	♫ And a pony all my own ♫
884.26	♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫
887.26	♫ That I can take to town. ♫
891.26	♫ And when I'm really getting old -- ♫
894.26	♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫
899.26	♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫
902.26	♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫

908.26	♫ If no one marries me ♫

924.26	♫ Marries me ♫
926.26	♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫
931.26	♫ Marries me ♫
933.26	♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫
944.26	Thank you.
946.26	(Applause) Thank you.
952.26	I became very curious about the poets
954.26	after spending six years with them,
957.26	and started to research their lives,
961.26	and then decided to write a book about it.
964.26	And the burning question about Alma-Tadema
967.26	was: Did she marry?
969.26	And the answer was no,
971.26	which I found in the London Times archive.
976.26	She died alone in 1940
979.26	in the company of her books and her dear friends.
984.26	Gerard Manley Hopkins,
986.26	a saintly man.
988.26	He became a Jesuit.
990.26	He converted from his Anglican faith.
993.26	He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,
997.26	the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as --
1001.26	and he became a Jesuit priest.
1004.26	He burned all his poetry at the age of 24
1007.26	and then did not write another poem for at least seven years
1009.26	because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet
1012.26	with the life of a priest.
1015.26	He died typhoid fever
1017.26	at the age of 44, I believe,
1021.26	At the time, he was teaching classics
1023.26	at Trinity College in Dublin.
1029.26	A few years before he died,
1031.26	after he had resumed writing poetry,
1033.26	but in secret,
1035.26	he confessed to a friend in a letter
1037.26	that I found when I was doing my research:
1039.26	"""I've written a verse."
1042.26	It is to explain death to a child,
1045.26	"and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."""
1049.26	And my blood froze when I read that
1051.26	because I had written the plain-song music
1056.26	"And the poem is called, ""Spring and Fall."""
1063.26	♫ Margaret,
1066.26	are you grieving ♫
1069.26	♫ Over Goldengrove
1072.26	unleaving, by and by? ♫
1080.26	♫ Leaves, like the things
1083.26	of man, you ♫
1085.26	♫ With your fresh thoughts care for,
1088.26	can you? ♫
1096.26	♫ But as the heart grows older ♫
1102.26	♫ It will come to such sights
1104.26	much colder ♫
1106.26	♫ By and by,
1108.26	nor spare a sigh ♫
1115.26	♫ Though worlds of
1117.26	wanwood leafmeal lie; ♫
1122.26	♫ And yet you will weep
1124.26	and you'll know why. ♫
1132.26	♫ No matter child, the name: ♫
1135.26	♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫
1140.26	♫ They're all the same. ♫
1147.26	♫ Nor mouth had
1150.26	nor no mind expressed ♫
1154.26	♫ What heart heard of,
1157.26	ghost had guessed: ♫
1164.26	♫ It's the blight
1167.26	man was born for, ♫
1171.26	♫ It is Margaret
1174.26	that you mourn for ♫
