13.27	Will we do whatever it takes
13.27	to tackle climate change?
19.393	I come at this question
19.393	not as a green campaigner,
22.39	in fact, I confess to be rather
22.39	hopeless at recycling.
25.404	I come at it as a professional observer
25.404	of financial policy making
30.693	and someone that wonders
30.693	how history will judge us.
36.353	One day,
37.633	this ring that belonged to my grandfather
41.522	will pass to my son, Charlie.
44.021	And I wonder what his generation
46.853	and perhaps the one that follows
49.183	will make of the two lives
49.183	this ring has worked.
54.995	My grandfather was a coal miner.
58.5	In his time,
60.616	burning fossil fuels for energy
60.616	and for allowing economies to develop
65.609	was accepted.
67.198	We know now that that is not the case
70.601	because of the greenhouse
70.601	gases that coal produces.
75.315	But today,
76.556	I fear it's the industry in which I work
76.556	that will be judged more harshly
80.626	because of its impact on the climate --
83.498	more harshly than
83.498	my grandfather's industry, even.
86.202	I work, of course,
86.202	in the banking industry,
88.912	which will be remembered
88.912	for its crisis in 2008 --
93.831	a crisis that diverted the attention
93.831	and finances of governments
98.746	away from some really, really
98.746	important promises,
104.151	like promises made at the Copenhagen
104.151	Climate Summit in 2009
109.315	to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year
112.171	to help developing countries
112.171	move away from burning fossil fuels
116.709	and transition to using cleaner energy.
120.396	That promise is already in jeopardy.
123.904	And that's a real problem,
125.793	because that transition
125.793	to cleaner energy needs to happen
128.558	sooner rather than later.
131.184	Firstly,
132.364	because greenhouse gases, once released,
134.366	stay in the atmosphere for decades.
137.083	And secondly,
138.295	if a developing economy builds
138.295	its power grid around fossil fuels today,
144.146	it's going to be way more costly
144.146	to change later on.
148.316	So for the climate,
150.486	history may judge
150.486	that the banking crisis happened
154.336	at just the wrong time.
156.92	The story need not be this gloomy, though.
161.669	Three years ago,
163.601	I argued that governments
163.601	could use the tools
166.521	deployed to save the financial system
169.23	to meet other global challenges.
171.918	And these arguments are getting
171.918	stronger, not weaker, with time.
178.334	Let's take a brief reminder
178.334	of what those tools looked like.
183.578	When the financial crisis hit in 2008,
186.589	the central banks of the US and UK
189.19	began buying bonds issued
189.19	by their own governments
192.649	in a policy known
192.649	"as ""quantitative easing."""
195.385	Depending on what happens
195.385	to those bonds when they mature,
199.119	this is money printing by another name.
202.35	And boy, did they print.
204.784	The US alone created four trillion
204.784	dollars' worth of its own currency.
209.376	This was not done in isolation.
211.489	In a remarkable act of cooperation,
214.187	the 188 countries that make up
214.187	the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,
218.784	agreed to issue 250 billion
218.784	dollars' worth of their own currency --
222.977	the Special Drawing Right --
225.073	to boost reserves around the world.
227.712	When the financial crisis moved to Europe,
231.626	the European Central Bank
231.626	President, Mario Draghi,
235.091	"promised ""to do whatever it takes."""
239.516	And they did.
241.696	The Bank of Japan repeated those words --
241.696	that exact same commitment --
246.074	"to do ""whatever it takes"""
246.074	to reflate their economy.
251.484	In both cases,
253.4	"""whatever it takes"" meant"
253.4	trillions of dollars more
257.663	in money-printing policies
257.663	that continue today.
261.334	What this shows
263.146	is that when faced
263.146	with some global challenges,
268.062	policy makers are able to act
268.062	collectively, with urgency,
272.731	and run the risks of unconventional
272.731	policies like money printing.
279.509	So, let's go back
279.509	to that original question:
285.511	Can we print money for climate finance?
289.201	Three years ago,
290.955	the idea of using money in this way
290.955	was something of a taboo.
294.714	Once you break down and dismantle the idea
297.914	that money is a finite resource,
300.58	governments can quickly get overwhelmed
300.58	by demands from their people
305.087	to print more and more
305.087	money for other causes:
308.337	education, health care, welfare --
310.361	even defense.
312.384	And there are some truly terrible
312.384	historical examples of money printing --
317.846	uncontrolled money printing --
320.193	leading to hyperinflation.
322.764	Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;
326.374	Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,
329.471	when the prices of basic goods
329.471	like bread are doubling every day.
334.892	But all of this is moving
334.892	the public debate forward,
339.92	so much so, that money printing
339.92	for the people is now discussed openly
345.272	in the financial media, and even
345.272	in some political manifestos.
350.203	But it's important the debate
350.203	doesn't stop here,
352.766	with printing national currencies.
357.912	Because climate change
357.912	is a shared global problem,
361.875	there are some really compelling reasons
364.969	why we should be printing
364.969	that international currency
368.422	that's issued by the IMF,
370.304	to fund it.
371.944	The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,
375.173	is the IMF's electronic unit of account
378.553	that governments use to transfer
378.553	funds amongst each other.
383.933	Think of it as a peer-to-peer
383.933	payment network,
386.698	like Bitcoin, but for governments.
390.572	And it's truly global.
393.005	Each of the 188 members
393.005	of the IMF hold SDR quotas
398.301	as part of their foreign
398.301	exchange reserves.
401.935	These are national stores of wealth
404.247	that countries keep to protect
404.247	themselves against currency crises.
408.764	And that global nature is why,
411.083	at the height of the financial
411.083	crisis in 2009,
415.41	the IMF issued those extra
419.152	because it served
419.152	as a collective global action
422.747	that safeguarded countries
422.747	large and small in one fell swoop.
429.043	But here --
430.363	here's the intriguing part.
433.083	More than half of those extra SDRs
433.083	that were printed in 2009 --
440.319	went to developed market countries
440.319	who, for the most part,
444.658	have a modest need
444.658	for these foreign exchange reserves,
447.519	because they have flexible exchange rates.
450.427	So those extra reserves
450.427	that were printed in 2009,
454.832	in the end, for developed
454.832	market countries at least,
458.327	weren't really needed.
460.508	And they remain unused today.
463.642	So here's an idea.
465.026	As a first step,
467.046	why don't we start
467.046	spending those unused,
470.136	those extra SDRs
470.136	that were printed in 2009,
473.627	to combat climate change?
475.948	They could, for example,
477.485	be used to buy bonds issued
477.485	by the UN's Green Climate Fund.
482.901	This was a fund created in 2009,
485.821	following that climate
485.821	agreement in Copenhagen.
489.906	And it was designed to channel funds
489.906	towards developing countries
494.286	to meet their climate projects.
496.377	It's been one of the most
496.377	successful funds of its type,
499.26	raising almost 10 billion dollars.
501.588	But if we use those extra
501.588	SDRs that were issued,
505.05	it helps governments get back on track,
508.386	to meet that promise
508.386	of 100 billion dollars a year
511.233	that was derailed by the financial crisis.
515.766	It could also --
517.698	it could also serve as a test case.
522.096	If the inflationary consequences
522.096	of using SDRs in this way are benign,
528.474	it could be used to justify
530.453	the additional, extra issuance
530.453	of SDRs, say, every five years,
535.211	again, with the commitment
537.63	that developed-market countries
537.63	would direct their share
542.084	of the new reserves
543.569	to the Green Climate Fund.
547.076	Printing international money
547.076	in this way has several advantages
550.824	over printing national currencies.
553.5	The first is it's really easy to argue
556.339	that spending money to mitigate
556.339	climate change benefits everyone.
561.366	No one section of society benefits
561.366	from the printing press over another.
565.249	That problem of competing
565.249	claims is mitigated.
569.463	It's also fair to say
570.827	that because it takes so many countries
570.827	to agree to issue these extra SDRs,
575.978	it's highly unlikely that money printing
575.978	would get out of control.
580.998	What you end up with
580.998	is a collective, global action
586.881	aimed -- and it's controlled
586.881	global action --
590.236	aimed at a global good.
593.637	And,
594.869	as we've learned
594.869	with the money-printing schemes,
597.46	whatever concerns we have
597.46	can be allayed by rules.
600.757	So, for example,
602.663	the issuance of these extra SDRs
602.663	every five years could be capped,
607.66	such that this international currency
607.66	is never more than five percent
613.279	of global foreign exchange reserves.
615.781	That's important because it would allay
617.83	well, let's say, the ridiculous
617.83	concerns that the US might have
621.75	that the SDR could ever challenge
621.75	the dollar's dominant role
626.296	in international finance.
628.214	And in fact,
630.021	I think the only thing that the SDR
630.021	would likely steal from the dollar
633.439	under this scheme
634.932	"is its nickname, the ""greenback."""
638.427	Because even with that cap in place,
642.367	the IMF could have
642.367	followed up its issuance --
645.855	its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --
648.927	with a further 200 billion
648.927	dollars of SDRs in 2014.
654.716	So hypothetically,
658.052	that would mean that developed countries
658.052	could have contributed
661.194	up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs
665.739	to the Green Climate Fund.
668.186	That's 30 times what it has today.
671.67	And you know,
672.85	as spectacular as that sounds,
675.58	it's only just beginning to look
675.58	"like ""whatever it takes."""
681.129	And just to think what amazing things
681.129	could be done with that money,
684.471	consider this:
686.618	in 2009,
688.27	Norway promised one billion dollars
688.27	of its reserves to Brazil
693.032	if they followed through
693.032	on their goals on deforestation.
698.593	That program has since delivered
698.593	a 70 percent reduction in deforestation
704.916	in the past decade.
706.926	That's saving 3.2 billion tons
706.926	of carbon dioxide emissions,
711.288	which is the equivalent of taking
711.288	all American cars off the roads
715.843	for three whole years.
719.704	So what could we do
721.03	with 300 other pay-for-performance
721.03	climate projects like that,
726.098	organized on a global scale?
729.937	We could take cars off the roads
729.937	for a generation.
733.384	So,
735	let's not quibble about whether we can
735	afford to fund climate change.
740.877	The real question is:
743.149	Do we care enough about future generations
746.57	to take the very same policy risks
746.57	we took to save the financial system?
752.223	After all,
754.249	we could do it,
756.284	we did do it
757.459	and we are doing it today.
759.808	We must, must, must do
759.808	"""whatever it takes."""
765.426	Thank you.
766.601	(Applause)
