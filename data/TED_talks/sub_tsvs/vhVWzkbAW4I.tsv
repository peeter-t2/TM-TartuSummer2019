12.706	Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood
15.417	are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,
18.968	in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.
22.768	Her apartment was an oasis.
25.843	It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,
27.888	which was really warm milk 
27.888	with just a touch of caffeine.
31.769	She loved life.
34.303	And although she worked in a factory,
36.798	she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.
39.97	And I remember poring over those pictures with her
43.299	and then dancing with her to her favorite music.
47.411	And then, when I was eight and she was 60,
52.033	something changed.
54.086	She no longer worked or traveled.
56.44	She no longer danced.
58.131	There were no more coffee times.
60.884	My mother missed work and took her to doctors
63.068	who couldn't make a diagnosis.
65.454	And my father, who worked at night, 
65.454	would spend every afternoon with her,
70.791	just to make sure she ate.
73.876	Her care became all-consuming for our family.
78.576	And by the time a diagnosis was made,
80.223	she was in a deep spiral.
82.928	Now many of you will recognize her symptoms.
86.489	My grandmother had depression.
89.152	A deep, life-altering depression,
92.472	from which she never recovered.
95.562	And back then, so little 
95.562	was known about depression.
99.253	But even today, 50 years later,
102.658	there's still so much more to learn.
105.932	Today, we know that women 
105.932	are 70 percent more likely
110.84	to experience depression over their lifetimes
113.831	compared with men.
116.112	And even with this high prevalence,
118.952	women are misdiagnosed between 
125.239	Now we know that women are more likely
128.172	to experience the symptoms 
128.172	of fatigue, sleep disturbance,
133.56	pain and anxiety compared with men.
136.105	And these symptoms are often overlooked
138.804	as symptoms of depression.
141.767	And it isn't only depression in which 
141.767	these sex differences occur,
145.55	but they occur across so many diseases.
150.069	So it's my grandmother's struggles
152.064	that have really led me on a lifelong quest.
155.797	And today, I lead a center in which the mission
159.025	is to discover why these sex differences occur
162.804	and to use that knowledge
164.906	to improve the health of women.
167.865	Today, we know that every cell has a sex.
171.998	Now, that's a term coined 
171.998	by the Institute of Medicine.
175.951	And what it means is that 
175.951	men and women are different
179.712	down to the cellular and molecular levels.
184.154	It means that we're different 
184.154	across all of our organs.
189.094	From our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.
194.589	Now, it was only 20 years ago
198.473	that we hardly had any data on women's health
202.3	beyond our reproductive functions.
205.183	But then in 1993,
208.084	the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.
212.696	And what this law did was it mandated
215.299	that women and minorities 
215.299	be included in clinical trials
219.772	that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.
223.823	And in many ways, the law has worked.
226.75	Women are now routinely 
226.75	included in clinical studies,
230.42	and we've learned that there are major differences
232.671	in the ways that women and men
234.764	experience disease.
237.3	But remarkably,
239.465	what we have learned about these 
239.465	differences is often overlooked.
244.559	So, we have to ask ourselves the question:
248.384	Why leave women's health to chance?
252.897	And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.
255.54	The first is that there is so much more to learn
259.237	and we're not making the investment
261.646	in fully understanding the extent 
261.646	of these sex differences.
265.814	And the second is that we aren't 
265.814	taking what we have learned,
270.536	and routinely applying it in clinical care.
274.24	We are just not doing enough.
278.229	So, I'm going to share with you three examples
280.488	of where sex differences have 
280.488	impacted the health of women,
284.194	and where we need to do more.
286.864	Let's start with heart disease.
288.876	It's the number one killer of women 
288.876	in the United States today.
294.078	This is the face of heart disease.
296.974	Linda is a middle-aged woman,
299.255	who had a stent placed in one of the arteries
301.84	going to her heart.
303.94	When she had recurring symptoms 
303.94	she went back to her doctor.
307.191	Her doctor did the gold standard test:
309.829	a cardiac catheterization.
312.116	It showed no blockages.
314.533	Linda's symptoms continued.
316.605	She had to stop working.
319.078	And that's when she found us.
321.83	When Linda came to us, we did 
321.83	another cardiac catheterization
325.978	and this time, we found clues.
329.395	But we needed another test
331.869	to make the diagnosis.
334.463	So we did a test called an intracoronary ultrasound,
339.043	where you use soundwaves to look at the artery
341.348	from the inside out.
344.079	And what we found
346.017	was that Linda's disease didn't look like
348.468	the typical male disease.
351.538	The typical male disease looks like this.
354.734	There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.
358.046	Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,
362.347	looks like this.
364.189	The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely
367.726	along the artery, and it's harder to see.
371.698	So for Linda, and for so many women,
375.104	the gold standard test wasn't gold.
378.796	Now, Linda received the right treatment.
381.783	She went back to her life and, fortunately, today
383.961	she is doing well.
385.713	But Linda was lucky.
387.319	She found us, we found her disease.
389.945	But for too many women, that's not the case.
392.856	We have the tools.
395.171	We have the technology to make the diagnosis.
398.852	But it's all too often that these sex diffferences
402.249	are overlooked.
404.553	So what about treatment?
406.726	A landmark study that was published two years ago
409.436	asked the very important question:
411.858	What are the most effective treatments 
411.858	for heart disease in women?
416.913	The authors looked at papers 
416.913	written over a 10-year period,
420.572	and hundreds had to be thrown out.
423.05	And what they found out was that 
423.05	of those that were tossed out,
431.477	because even though women 
431.477	were included in the studies,
435.841	the analysis didn't differentiate 
435.841	between women and men.
442.197	What a lost opportunity.
445.418	The money had been spent
447.449	and we didn't learn how women fared.
449.596	And these studies could not contribute one iota
452.397	to the very, very important question,
454.814	what are the most effective treatments
457.205	for heart disease in women?
460.1	I want to introduce you to 
460.1	Hortense, my godmother,
465.592	Hung Wei, a relative of a colleague,
469.035	and somebody you may recognize --
471.226	Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.
474.873	All three women have something 
474.873	very important in common.
479.233	All three were diagnosed with lung cancer,
482.808	the number one cancer killer of women
485.737	in the United States today.
488.438	All three were nonsmokers.
492.314	Sadly, Dana and Hung Wei died of their disease.
497.48	Today, what we know is that women who are
497.48	nonsmokers are three times more likely
503.62	to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men
506.357	who are nonsmokers.
508.343	Now interestingly, when women are 
508.343	diagnosed with lung cancer,
512.033	their survival tends to be better than that of men.
515.212	Now, here are some clues.
517.087	Our investigators have found that there are
519.486	certain genes in the lung tumor 
519.486	cells of both women and men.
524.158	And these genes are activated
526.35	mainly by estrogen.
528.44	And when these genes are over-expressed,
531.258	it's associated with improved survival
533.989	only in young women.
536.656	Now this is a very early finding
538.33	and we don't yet know whether it has relevance
541.973	to clinical care.
544.414	But it's findings like this that may provide hope
548.273	and may provide an opportunity to save lives
551.04	of both women and men.
553.587	Now, let me share with you an example
554.968	of when we do consider sex differences,
554.968	it can drive the science.
558.946	Several years ago a new lung cancer drug
561.274	was being evaluated,
562.92	and when the authors looked 
562.92	at whose tumors shrank,
567.292	they found that 82 percent were women.
570.725	This led them to ask the question: Well, why?
573.688	And what they found
575.243	was that the genetic mutations 
575.243	that the drug targeted
578.723	were far more common in women.
581.45	And what this has led to
583.149	is a more personalized approach
585.331	to the treatment of lung cancer 
585.331	that also includes sex.
589.485	This is what we can accomplish
591.58	when we don't leave women's health to chance.
595.406	We know that when you invest in research,
598.614	you get results.
600.14	Take a look at the death rate 
600.14	from breast cancer over time.
604.648	And now take a look at the death rates
606.573	from lung cancer in women over time.
609.905	Now let's look at the dollars 
609.905	invested in breast cancer --
613.515	these are the dollars invested per death --
616.484	and the dollars invested in lung cancer.
620.712	Now, it's clear that our investment in breast cancer
625.633	has produced results.
627.422	They may not be fast enough,
629.755	but it has produced results.
631.981	We can do the same
633.785	for lung cancer and for every other disease.
638.776	So let's go back to depression.
642.102	Depression is the number one cause
644.412	of disability in women in the world today.
649.004	Our investigators have found
651.139	that there are differences in the brains
652.955	of women and men
654.432	in the areas that are connected with mood.
657.551	And when you put men and women
659.624	in a functional MRI scanner --
661.499	that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated --
666.046	so you put them in the scanner 
666.046	and you expose them to stress.
670.089	You can actually see the difference.
673.976	And it's findings like this
676.505	that we believe hold some of the clues
679.486	for why we see these very significant sex differences
683.239	in depression.
685.493	But even though we know
687.051	that these differences occur,
692.571	of the brain research that begins in animals
696.567	is done in either male animals
698.893	or animals in whom the sex is not identified.
703.24	So, I think we have to ask again the question:
706.859	Why leave women's health to chance?
711.661	And this is a question that haunts those of us
714.489	in science and medicine
716.3	who believe that we are on the verge 
716.3	of being able to dramatically improve
722.659	the health of women.
724.335	We know that every cell has a sex.
726.821	We know that these differences 
726.821	are often overlooked.
729.763	And therefore we know that women 
729.763	are not getting the full benefit
734.051	of modern science and medicine today.
737.95	We have the tools
739.601	but we lack the collective will and momentum.
743.483	Women's health is an equal rights issue
746.227	as important as equal pay.
749.781	And it's an issue of the quality
751.965	and the integrity of science and medicine.
755.12	(Applause)
762.583	So imagine the momentum we could achieve
767.128	in advancing the health of women
769.239	if we considered whether these 
769.239	sex differences were present
772.098	at the very beginning of designing research.
775.687	Or if we analyzed our data by sex.
779.566	So, people often ask me:
781.514	What can I do?
783.285	And here's what I suggest:
785.619	First, I suggest that you think about women's health
789.792	in the same way
791.535	that you think and care about other 
791.535	causes that are important to you.
797.58	And second, and equally as important,
800.762	that as a woman,
802.974	you have to ask your doctor
805.615	and the doctors who are caring 
805.615	for those who you love:
810.027	Is this disease or treatment different in women?
814.903	Now, this is a profound question 
814.903	because the answer is likely yes,
818.491	but your doctor may not know 
818.491	the answer, at least not yet.
822.188	But if you ask the question, 
822.188	your doctor will very likely
826.564	go looking for the answer.
828.846	And this is so important,
831.183	not only for ourselves,
833.345	but for all of those whom we love.
835.998	Whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister,
840.482	a friend or a grandmother.
844.179	It was my grandmother's suffering
846.322	that inspired my work
848.255	to improve the health of women.
851.24	That's her legacy.
853.59	Our legacy can be to improve the health of women
858.259	for this generation
860.398	and for generations to come.
863.42	Thank you.
865.569	(Applause)
