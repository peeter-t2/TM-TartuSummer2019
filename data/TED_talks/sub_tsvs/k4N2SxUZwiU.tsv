13.023	As a boy in Lima,
14.69	my grandfather told me a legend
16.825	of the Spanish conquest of Peru.
20.007	Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca,
20.007	had been captured and killed.
23.57	Pizarro and his conquistadors
23.57	had grown rich,
26.577	and tales of their conquest
26.577	and glory had reached Spain
29.787	and was bringing new waves of Spaniards,
29.787	hungry for gold and glory.
36.055	They would go into towns and ask the Inca,
38.977	"""Where's another civilization"
38.977	"we can conquer? Where's more gold?"""
42.776	And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,
46.648	"""Go to the Amazon."
48.767	You'll find all the gold you want there.
51.437	In fact, there is a city called Paititi --
51.437	El Dorado in Spanish --
56.175	"made entirely of gold."""
59.303	The Spanish set off into the jungle,
61.223	but the few that return
61.223	come back with stories,
65.904	stories of powerful shamans,
69.735	of warriors with poisoned arrows,
72.663	of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,
76.465	spiders that ate birds,
76.465	snakes that swallowed men whole
81.241	and a river that boiled.
85.795	All this became a childhood memory.
87.803	And years passed.
88.986	I'm working on my PhD at SMU,
91.485	trying to understand
91.485	Peru's geothermal energy potential,
95.413	when I remember this legend,
97.483	and I began asking that question.
100.316	Could the boiling river exist?
104.14	I asked colleagues from universities,
106.363	the government,
107.544	oil, gas and mining companies,
109.061	and the answer was a unanimous no.
112.459	And this makes sense.
115.07	You see, boiling rivers
115.07	do exist in the world,
117.722	but they're generally
117.722	associated with volcanoes.
120.649	You need a powerful heat source
122.82	to produce such a large
122.82	geothermal manifestation.
126.21	And as you can see from the red dots
126.21	here, which are volcanoes,
131.438	we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,
134.28	nor in most of Peru.
136.122	So it follows: We should not expect
136.122	to see a boiling river.
141.66	Telling this same story
141.66	at a family dinner,
145.772	my aunt tells me,
148.266	"""But no, Andrés, I've been there."
148.266	"I've swum in that river."""
152.898	(Laughter)
156.559	Then my uncle jumps in.
158.33	"""No, Andrés, she's not kidding."
161.084	You see, you can only swim in it
161.084	after a very heavy rain,
165.091	and it's protected by a powerful shaman.
168.361	"Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."""
171.257	(Laughter)
173.086	"""¿Cómo?"" [""Huh?""]"
174.261	You know, despite all
174.261	my scientific skepticism,
176.499	I found myself hiking into the jungle,
176.499	guided by my aunt,
180.955	over 700 kilometers away
180.955	from the nearest volcanic center,
184.876	and well, honestly,
184.876	mentally preparing myself
188.518	to behold the legendary
188.518	"""warm stream of the Amazon."""
194.671	But then ...
196.316	I heard something,
199.255	a low surge
202.347	that got louder and louder
205.792	as we came closer.
208.3	It sounded like ocean waves
208.3	constantly crashing,
212.252	and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor,
212.252	coming up through the trees.
216.961	And then, I saw this.
221.791	I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,
224.284	and the average temperatures in the river
227.585	were 86 degrees C.
231.54	This is not quite
231.54	the 100-degree C boiling
234.831	but definitely close enough.
238.296	The river flowed hot and fast.
242.181	I followed it upriver and was led by,
242.181	actually, the shaman's apprentice
245.853	to the most sacred site on the river.
247.661	And this is what's bizarre --
249.091	It starts off as a cold stream.
251.502	And here, at this site,
253.763	is the home of the Yacumama,
255.954	mother of the waters,
255.954	a giant serpent spirit
259.321	who births hot and cold water.
262.015	And here we find a hot spring,
266.451	mixing with cold stream water
266.451	underneath her protective motherly jaws
271.833	and thus bringing their legends to life.
276.283	The next morning, I woke up and --
278.285	(Laughter)
280.528	I asked for tea.
282.583	I was handed a mug, a tea bag
284.847	and, well, pointed towards the river.
288.075	To my surprise, the water was clean
288.075	and had a pleasant taste,
292.608	which is a little weird
292.608	for geothermal systems.
296.441	What was amazing
298.013	is that the locals had always
298.013	known about this place,
301.021	and that I was by no means
301.021	the first outsider to see it.
305.701	It was just part of their everyday life.
309.115	They drink its water.
311.833	They take in its vapor.
314.412	They cook with it,
316.127	clean with it,
317.661	even make their medicines with it.
321.094	I met the shaman,
322.864	and he seemed like an extension
322.864	of the river and his jungle.
327.848	He asked for my intentions
330.609	and listened carefully.
333.262	Then, to my tremendous relief --
336.397	I was freaking out,
336.397	to be honest with you --
339.968	a smile began to snake across his face,
339.968	and he just laughed.
344.271	(Laughter)
347.796	I had received the shaman's blessing
347.796	to study the river,
352.415	on the condition that after I take
352.415	the water samples
355.843	and analyze them in my lab,
357.383	wherever I was in the world,
360.265	that I pour the waters
360.265	back into the ground
364.055	so that, as the shaman said,
366.126	the waters could find their way back home.
371.272	I've been back every year
371.272	since that first visit in 2011,
374.883	and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,
378.332	demanding and at times dangerous.
382.913	One story was even featured
382.913	in National Geographic Magazine.
386.152	I was trapped on a small rock
386.152	about the size of a sheet of paper
390.263	in sandals and board shorts,
392.327	in between an 80 degree C river
394.757	and a hot spring that, well,
394.757	looked like this, close to boiling.
399.07	And on top of that,
399.07	it was Amazon rain forest.
403.206	Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.
405.736	The temperature differential
405.736	made it all white. It was a whiteout.
410.956	Intense.
414.158	Now, after years of work,
416.62	I'll soon be submitting my geophysical
416.62	and geochemical studies for publication.
423.047	And I'd like to share, today,
423.047	with all of you here, on the TED stage,
427.046	for the first time,
427.046	some of these discoveries.
431.34	Well, first off, it's not a legend.
434.468	Surprise!
435.666	(Laughter)
438.015	When I first started the research,
440.553	the satellite imagery was too
440.553	low-resolution to be meaningful.
443.556	There were just no good maps.
445.754	Thanks to the support
445.754	of the Google Earth team,
448.169	I now have this.
451.251	Not only that, the indigenous name
451.251	of the river, Shanay-timpishka,
457.538	"""boiled with the heat of the sun,"""
461.54	indicating that I'm not the first
461.54	to wonder why the river boils,
466.943	and showing that humanity
466.943	has always sought to explain
470.194	the world around us.
473.526	So why does the river boil?
475.948	(Bubbling sounds)
480.385	It actually took me three years
480.385	to get that footage.
484.879	Fault-fed hot springs.
487.625	As we have hot blood running
487.625	through our veins and arteries,
491.282	so, too, the earth has hot water
491.282	running through its cracks and faults.
497.162	Where these arteries come to the surface,
497.162	these earth arteries,
500.781	we'll get geothermal manifestations:
503.179	fumaroles, hot springs
503.179	and in our case, the boiling river.
508.459	What's truly incredible, though,
508.459	is the scale of this place.
513.221	Next time you cross the road,
513.221	think about this.
516.527	The river flows wider than a two-lane road
519.223	along most of its path.
521.674	It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.
528.223	Truly impressive.
531.077	There are thermal pools
531.077	larger than this TED stage,
534.101	and that waterfall that you see there
536.601	is six meters tall --
539.384	and all with near-boiling water.
544.243	We mapped the temperatures
544.243	along the river,
546.323	and this was by far the most
546.323	demanding part of the fieldwork.
549.866	And the results were just awesome.
553.577	Sorry -- the geoscientist
553.577	in me coming out.
556.754	And it showed this amazing trend.
559.204	You see, the river starts off cold.
561.444	It then heats up, cools back down,
561.444	heats up, cools back down,
564.463	heats up again, and then has
564.463	this beautiful decay curve
567.105	until it smashes into this cold river.
570.539	Now, I understand not all of you
570.539	are geothermal scientists,
573.357	so to put it in more everyday terms:
576.225	Everyone loves coffee.
578.382	Yes? Good.
580.517	Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,
584.224	an extra-hot one, well, 60.
586.896	So, put in coffee shop terms,
589.091	the boiling river plots like this.
592.401	There you have your hot coffee.
594.906	Here you have your extra-hot coffee,
596.654	and you can see
596.654	that there's a bit point there
598.852	where the river is still hotter
598.852	than even the extra-hot coffee.
601.864	And these are average water temperatures.
603.88	We took these in the dry season to ensure
603.88	the purest geothermal temperatures.
608.603	But there's a magic number here
608.603	that's not being shown,
611.247	and that number is 47 degrees C,
614.856	because that's where things start to hurt,
617.402	and I know this from very
617.402	personal experience.
622.186	Above that temperature,
622.186	you don't want to get in that water.
625.036	You need to be careful.
626.722	It can be deadly.
628.704	I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,
631.019	and what's shocking to me,
631.019	is the process is pretty much the same.
635.898	So they fall in and the first thing
635.898	to go are the eyes.
638.603	Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly.
638.603	They turn this milky-white color.
641.994	The stream is carrying them.
643.368	They're trying to swim out,
643.368	but their meat is cooking on the bone
646.455	because it's so hot.
647.645	So they're losing power, losing power,
649.514	until finally they get to a point
649.514	where hot water goes into their mouths
652.928	and they cook from the inside out.
655.44	(Laughter)
660.696	A bit sadistic, aren't we?
662.839	Jeez.
665.362	Leave them marinating for a little longer.
669.468	What's, again, amazing
669.468	are these temperatures.
672.22	They're similar to things that I've seen
672.22	on volcanoes all over the world
675.722	and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.
678.896	But here's the thing:
682.173	the data is showing
682.173	that the boiling river exists
687.196	independent of volcanism.
690.491	It's neither magmatic
690.491	or volcanic in origin,
695.722	and again, over 700 kilometers away
695.722	from the nearest volcanic center.
702.543	How can a boiling river exist like this?
707.79	I've asked geothermal experts
707.79	and volcanologists for years,
710.97	and I'm still unable to find another
710.97	non-volcanic geothermal system
715.811	of this magnitude.
719.121	It's unique.
721.489	It's special on a global scale.
726.708	So, still -- how does it work?
730.46	Where do we get this heat?
733.186	There's still more research to be done
735.303	to better constrain the problem
735.303	and better understand the system,
738.516	but from what the data is telling us now,
740.866	it looks to be the result
740.866	of a large hydrothermal system.
745.151	Basically, it works like this:
746.635	So, the deeper you go
746.635	into the earth, the hotter it gets.
749.967	We refer to this
749.967	as the geothermal gradient.
753.46	The waters could be coming
753.46	from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,
758.412	then seeping down deep into the earth
760.435	and coming out to form the boiling river
763.226	after getting heated up
763.226	from the geothermal gradient,
767.311	all due to this unique geologic setting.
770.587	Now, we found
770.587	that in and around the river --
773.458	this is working with colleagues
774.975	from National Geographic,
774.975	Dr. Spencer Wells,
777.086	and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --
779.82	we genetically sequenced
779.82	the extremophile lifeforms
783.106	living in and around the river,
783.106	and have found new lifeforms,
787.734	unique species living
787.734	in the boiling river.
792.264	But again, despite all of these studies,
792.264	all of these discoveries and the legends,
798.499	a question remains:
801.704	What is the significance
801.704	of the boiling river?
806.601	What is the significance
806.601	of this stationary cloud
811.271	that always hovers
811.271	over this patch of jungle?
815.333	And what is the significance
818.007	of a detail in a childhood legend?
823.547	To the shaman and his community,
823.547	it's a sacred site.
827.414	To me, as a geoscientist,
829.783	it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.
834.074	But to the illegal loggers
834.074	and cattle farmers,
837.796	it's just another resource to exploit.
842.82	And to the Peruvian government,
842.82	it's just another stretch
846.631	of unprotected land ready for development.
854.186	My goal is to ensure
854.186	that whoever controls this land
857.806	understands the boiling river's
857.806	uniqueness and significance.
862.892	Because that's the question,
865.853	one of significance.
868.568	And the thing there is,
872.11	we define significance.
874.998	It's us. We have that power.
877.682	We are the ones who draw that line
880.434	between the sacred and the trivial.
883.736	And in this age,
886.036	where everything seems mapped,
886.036	measured and studied,
891.29	in this age of information,
894.899	I remind you all that discoveries
894.899	are not just made
898.495	in the black void of the unknown
904.153	but in the white noise
904.153	of overwhelming data.
909.862	There remains so much to explore.
913.958	We live in an incredible world.
917.477	So go out.
920.306	Be curious.
923.711	Because we do live in a world
927.539	where shamans still sing
927.539	to the spirits of the jungle,
932.399	where rivers do boil
935.299	and where legends do come to life.
939.018	Thank you very much.
940.223	(Applause)
