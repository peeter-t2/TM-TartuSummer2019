15.26	I just came back from a community
17.26	that holds the secret to human survival.
21.26	It's a place where women run the show,
24.26	have sex to say hello,
26.26	and play rules the day --
28.26	where fun is serious business.
31.26	And no, this isn't Burning Man
33.26	or San Francisco.
35.26	(Laughter)
37.26	Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
40.26	This is the world of wild bonobos
43.26	in the jungles of Congo.
45.26	Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,
48.26	your living closest relative.
51.26	That means we all share a common ancestor,
54.26	an evolutionary grandmother,
56.26	who lived around six million years ago.
60.26	Now, chimpanzees are well-known
62.26	for their aggression.
64.26	(Laughter)
67.26	But unfortunately,
69.26	we have made too much of an emphasis
71.26	of this aspect
73.26	in our narratives of human evolution.
76.26	But bonobos show us
78.26	the other side of the coin.
80.26	While chimpanzees
82.26	are dominated by big, scary guys,
85.26	bonobo society
87.26	is run by empowered females.
91.26	These guys have really worked something out,
94.26	since this leads to a highly tolerant society
97.26	where fatal violence
99.26	has not been observed yet.
102.26	But unfortunately,
104.26	bonobos are the least understood
106.26	of the great apes.
108.26	They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,
111.26	and it has been very difficult to study them.
114.26	The Congo is a paradox --
117.26	a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,
121.26	but also the heart of darkness itself --
124.26	the scene of a violent conflict
127.26	that has raged for decades
129.26	and claimed nearly as many lives
132.26	as the First World War.
136.26	Not surprisingly,
138.26	this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.
142.26	Bushmeat trades and forest loss
145.26	means we couldn't fill a small stadium
148.26	with all the bonobos that are left in the world --
150.26	and we're not even sure of that to be honest.
154.26	Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,
158.26	you can hear hidden laughter
161.26	swaying the trees.
163.26	Who are these cousins?
166.26	"We know them as the ""make love, not war"" apes"
170.26	since they have frequent, promiscuous
172.26	and bisexual sex
174.26	to manage conflict
176.26	and solve social issues.
178.26	Now, I'm not saying this is the solution
180.26	to all of humanity's problems --
184.26	since there's more to bonobo life
186.26	than the Kama Sutra.
188.26	Bonobos, like humans,
190.26	love to play throughout their entire lives.
192.26	Play is not just child's games.
194.26	For us and them,
196.26	play is foundational for bonding relationships
199.26	and fostering tolerance.
201.26	It's where we learn to trust
203.26	and where we learn about the rules of the game.
206.26	Play increases creativity
208.26	and resilience,
211.26	and it's all about the generation of diversity --
214.26	diversity of interactions,
216.26	diversity of behaviors,
218.26	diversity of connections.
221.26	And when you watch bonobo play,
223.26	you're seeing the very evolutionary roots
226.26	of human laughter, dance
228.26	and ritual.
230.26	Play is the glue
232.26	that binds us together.
234.26	Now, I don't know how you play,
237.26	but I want to show you a couple of unique clips
239.26	fresh from the wild.
241.26	First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --
244.26	and I do not mean football.
247.26	So here,
249.26	we have a young female and a male
251.26	engaged in a chase game.
254.26	Have a look what she's doing.
256.26	It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,
258.26	"""she's got him by the balls."""
260.26	(Laughter)
263.26	Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
267.26	Yeah.
269.26	(Laughter)
271.26	So sex play is common
273.26	in both bonobos and humans.
275.26	And this video is really interesting
277.26	because it shows --
279.26	this video's really interesting
281.26	because it shows the inventiveness
283.26	of bringing unusual elements into play --
286.26	such as testicles --
289.26	and also how play both requires trust
292.26	and fosters trust --
295.26	while at the same time being tremendous fun.
297.26	But play's a shapeshifter.
299.26	(Laughter)
302.26	Play's a shapeshifter,
304.26	and it can take many forms,
306.26	some of which are more quiet,
308.26	imaginative, curious --
310.26	maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
313.26	And I want you to see,
315.26	this is Fuku, a young female,
317.26	and she is quietly playing with water.
319.26	I think, like her,
321.26	we sometimes play alone,
323.26	and we explore the boundaries
325.26	of our inner and our outer worlds.
328.26	And it's that playful curiosity
330.26	that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,
334.26	and then the unexpected connections we form
337.26	are the real hotbed for creativity.
341.26	So these are just small tasters
344.26	into the insights that bonobo give us
346.26	to our past and present.
349.26	But they also hold a secret for our future,
352.26	a future where we need to adapt
354.26	to an increasingly challenging world
357.26	through greater creativity
359.26	and greater cooperation.
361.26	The secret is that play is the key
364.26	to these capacities.
366.26	In other words,
368.26	play is our adaptive wildcard.
370.26	In order to adapt successfully
372.26	to a changing world,
374.26	we need to play.
378.26	But will we make the most of our playfulness?
381.26	Play is not frivolous.
383.26	Play's essential.
385.26	For bonobos and humans alike,
388.26	life is not just red in tooth and claw.
391.26	In times when it seems least appropriate to play,
394.26	it might be the times when it is most urgent.
398.26	And so, my fellow primates,
401.26	let us embrace this gift from evolution
404.26	and play together,
406.26	as we rediscover creativity,
409.26	fellowship and wonder.
411.26	Thank you.
413.26	(Applause)
