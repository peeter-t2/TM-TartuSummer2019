12.916	When I was preparing for this talk,
15.17	I went to search for a couple of quotes
17.146	that I can share with you.
18.991	Good news: I found three
21.162	that I particularly liked,
22.994	the first by Samuel Johnson, who said,
26.472	"""When making your choice in life,"
28.712	"do not forget to live,"""
31.468	the second by Aeschylus, who reminded us that
35	"""happiness is a choice that requires effort,"""
39.305	and the third is one by Groucho Marx
42.83	"who said, ""I wouldn't want to choose to belong"
45.92	"to any club that would have me as a member."""
51.252	Now, bad news:
53.318	I didn't know which one of these quotes
55.429	to choose and share with you.
58.178	The sweet anxiety of choice.
61.403	In today's times of post-industrial capitalism,
65.446	choice, together with individual freedom
69.109	and the idea of self-making,
71.97	has been elevated to an ideal.
75.5	Now, together with this, we also have a belief
79.387	in endless progress.
82.155	But the underside of this ideology
84.911	has been an increase of anxiety,
88.443	feelings of guilt,
90.513	feelings of being inadequate,
94.217	feeling that we are failing in our choices.
98.954	Sadly, this ideology of individual choice
102.95	has prevented us from thinking about social changes.
108.4	It appears that this ideology was actually
111.319	very efficient in pacifying us
114.001	as political and social thinkers.
116.797	Instead of making social critiques,
119.113	we are more and more engaging in self-critique,
122.869	sometimes to the point of self-destruction.
127.122	Now, how come that ideology of choice
129.867	is still so powerful,
131.45	even among people who have
134.546	not many things to choose among?
136.655	How come that even people who are poor
140.229	very much still identify with the idea of choice,
144.62	the kind of rational idea of choice
146.689	which we embrace?
149.322	Now, the ideology of choice is very successful
153.34	in opening for us a space to think
157.32	about some imagined future.
160.987	Let me give you an example.
163	My friend Manya,
164.913	when she was a student at university in California,
167.962	was earning money
169.66	by working for a car dealer.
172.72	Now, Manya, when she encountered
174.531	the typical customer, would debate with him
177.389	about his lifestyle,
179.233	how much he wants to spend,
181.956	how many children he has,
183.7	what does he need the car for?
185.973	They would usually come to a good conclusion
188.66	what would be a perfect car.
191.214	Now, before Manya's customer would go home
194.702	and think things through,
197.14	she would say to him,
198.96	"""The car that you are buying now is perfect,"
202.745	but in a few year's time,
204.77	when your kids will be already out of the house,
207.403	when you will have a little bit more money,
210.37	that other car will be ideal.
213.399	"But what you are buying now is great."""
216.936	Now, the majority of Manya's customers
219.293	who came back the next day
220.913	bought that other car,
223.738	the car they did not need,
225.795	the car that cost far too much money.
228.833	Now, Manya became so successful in selling cars
231.769	that soon she moved on to selling airplanes.
234.671	(Laughter)
239.265	And knowing so much about
239.265	the psychology of people
243.35	prepared her well for her current job,
244.924	which is that of a psychoanalyst.
248.755	Now, why were Manya's customers so irrational?
253.278	Manya's success was that she was able
255.775	to open in their heads an image
258.7	of an idealized future,
262.28	an image of themselves
264.19	when they are already more successful, freer,
268.42	and for them, choosing that other car
270.669	was as if they are coming closer to this ideal
273.729	in which it was as if Manya already saw them.
278.578	Now, we rarely make really totally rational choices.
282.981	Choices are influenced by our unconscious,
286.559	by our community.
288.398	We're often choosing
290.328	by guessing, what would other people
292.482	think about our choice?
295.466	Also we are choosing
296.671	by looking at what others are choosing.
299.04	We're also guessing what is
299.04	socially acceptable choice.
303.845	Now, because of this, we actually
306.916	even after we have already chosen,
308.805	like bought a car,
310.56	endlessly read reviews about cars,
313.71	as if we still want to convince ourselves
316.07	that we made the right choice.
318.671	Now, choices are anxiety-provoking.
321.87	They are linked to risks, losses.
324.951	They are highly unpredictable.
327.306	Now, because of this,
329.415	people have now more and more problems
331.918	that they are not choosing anything.
335.376	Not long ago, I was at a wedding reception,
339.207	and I met a young, beautiful woman
341.511	who immediately started telling
341.511	me about her anxiety over choice.
346.137	"She said to me, ""I needed one month"
348.108	"to decide which dress to wear."""
351.154	"Then she said, ""For weeks I was researching"
353.675	which hotel to stay for this one night.
356.936	"And now, I need to choose a sperm donor."""
361.434	(Laughter)
364.201	I looked at this woman in shock.
367.7	"""Sperm donor? What's the rush?"""
370.737	"She said, ""I'm turning 40 at the end of this year,"
374.911	"and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."""
379.736	Now choice, because it's linked to risk,
384.142	is anxiety-provoking,
386.419	and it was already the famous
389.276	Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard
391.869	who pointed out that anxiety
394.583	is linked to the possibility of possibility.
397.848	Now, we think today that we can prevent these risks.
402.281	We have endless market analysis,
405.362	projections of the future earnings.
407.871	Even with market, which is about chance,
410.571	randomness, we think we can predict rationally
414.711	where it's going.
416.434	Now, chance is actually becoming very traumatic.
421.281	Last year, my friend Bernard Harcourt
424.171	at the University of Chicago organized an event,
428.446	a conference on the idea of chance.
431.843	He and I were together on the panel,
433.929	and just before delivering our papers —
436.446	we didn't know each other's papers —
438.796	we decided to take chance seriously.
441.304	So we informed our audience
443.14	that what they will just now hear
445.489	will be a random paper,
447.502	a mixture of the two papers
449.674	which we didn't know what each was writing.
453.545	Now, we delivered the conference in such a way.
457.725	Bernard read his first paragraph,
459.946	I read my first paragraph,
462.07	Bernard read his second paragraph,
464.277	I read my second paragraph,
465.762	in this way towards the end of our papers.
469.384	Now, you will be surprised
471.263	that a majority of our audience
473.445	did not think that what they'd just listened to
476.188	was a completely random paper.
479.473	They couldn't believe that
481.419	speaking from the position of authority
483.939	like two professors we were,
485.817	we would take chance seriously.
488.888	They thought we prepared the papers together
491.475	and were just joking that it's random.
494.953	Now, we live in times with a lot of information,
499.12	big data,
500.711	a lot of knowledge about the insides of our bodies.
503.715	We decoded our genome.
505.458	We know about our brains more than before.
508.569	But surprisingly, people are more and more
511.205	turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge.
515.64	Ignorance and denial are on the rise.
520.633	Now, in regard to the current economic crisis,
523.851	we think that we will just wake up again
526.505	and everything will be the same as before,
528.721	and no political or social changes are needed.
531.984	In regard to ecological crisis,
534.234	we think nothing needs to be done just now,
537.35	or others need to act before us.
540.252	Or even when ecological crisis already happens,
543.548	like a catastrophe in Fukushima,
545.877	often we have people living in the same environment
548.701	with the same amount of information,
550.523	and half of them will be anxious about radiation
554.21	and half of them will ignore it.
557.531	Now, psychoanalysts know very well
560.343	that people surprisingly don't have
562.818	passion for knowledge
564.607	but passion for ignorance.
567.689	Now, what does that mean?
569.174	Let's say when we are facing
570.99	a life-threatening illness,
573.783	a lot of people don't want to know that.
576.989	They'd rather prefer denying the illness,
580.387	which is why it's not so wise to inform them
583.661	if they don't ask.
585.37	Surprisingly, research shows that sometimes
587.8	people who deny their illness
589.644	live longer than those who are rationally choosing
593.56	the best treatment.
595.999	Now, this ignorance, however,
598.12	is not very helpful on the level of the social.
602.849	When we are ignorant about where we are heading,
606.179	a lot of social damage can be caused.
610.364	Now, on top of facing ignorance,
612.445	we are also facing today
614.683	some kind of an obviousness.
617.844	Now, it was French philosopher
619.971	Louis Althusser who pointed out
622.08	that ideology functions in such a way
624.643	that it creates a veil of obviousness.
628.509	Before we do any social critique,
632.244	it is necessary really to lift that veil of obviousness
636.631	and to think through a little bit differently.
639.96	If we go back to this ideology
641.997	of individual, rational choice
644.528	we often embrace,
646.856	it's necessary precisely here
648.836	to lift this obviousness
651.165	and to think a little bit differently.
654.296	Now for me, a question often is
657.26	why we still embrace this idea of a self-made man
661.863	on which capitalism relied from its beginning?
665.395	Why do we think that we are really such masters
667.88	of our lives that we can rationally
670.705	make the best ideal choices,
673.157	that we don't accept losses and risks?
676.386	And for me, it's very shocking to
676.386	see sometimes very poor people,
679.671	for example, not supporting the idea
682.015	of the rich being taxed more.
685.633	Quite often here they still identify
687.681	with a certain kind of a lottery mentality.
690.279	Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it
693.562	in the future, but maybe they think,
694.964	my son might become the next Bill Gates.
698.153	And who would want to tax one's son?
701.37	Or, a question for me is also,
705.2	why would people who have no health insurance
707.58	not embrace universal healthcare?
710.561	Sometimes they don't embrace it,
712.09	again identifying with the idea of choice,
714.914	but they have nothing to choose from.
717.472	Now, Margaret Thatcher famously said
721.922	that there is nothing like a society.
724.554	Society doesn't exist, it is only individuals
728.334	and their families.
730.13	Sadly, this ideology still functions very well,
735.263	which is why people who are poor might feel
737.547	ashamed for their poverty.
739.47	We might endlessly feel guilty that we are
741.732	not making the right choices,
743.846	and that's why we didn't succeed.
746.142	We are anxious that we are not good enough.
749.674	That's why we work very hard,
751.597	long hours at the workplace
753.138	and equally long hours on remaking ourselves.
757.576	Now, when we are anxious over choices,
759.989	sometimes we easily give our power of choice away.
764.421	We identify with the guru
766.217	who tells us what to do,
767.496	self-help therapist,
770.14	or we embrace a totalitarian leader
772.919	who appears to have no doubts about choices,
775.706	who sort of knows.
777.79	Now, often people ask me,
780.566	"""What did you learn by studying choice?"""
782.94	And there is an important message that I did learn.
786.111	When thinking about choices,
788.598	I stopped taking choices too seriously, personally.
793.558	First, I realized a lot of choice I make
796.18	is not rational.
797.639	It's linked to my unconscious,
799.543	my guesses of what others are choosing,
801.737	or what is a socially embraced choice.
805.393	I also embrace the idea
807.69	that we should go beyond
809.33	thinking about individual choices,
811.254	that it's very important to rethink social choices,
814.91	since this ideology of individual
814.91	choice has pacified us.
818.611	It really prevented us to think about social change.
821.749	We spend so much time
821.749	choosing things for ourselves
825.48	and barely reflect on
827.25	communal choices we can make.
829.476	Now, we should not forget that choice
831.176	is always linked to change.
833.86	We can make individual changes,
835.676	but we can make social changes.
837.861	We can choose to have more wolves.
841.627	We can choose to change our environment
844.394	to have more bees.
846.824	We can choose to have different rating agencies.
851.11	We can choose to control corporations
853.573	instead of allowing corporations to control us.
857.437	We have a possibility to make changes.
860.852	Now, I started with a quote from Samuel Johnson,
864.13	who said that when we make choice in life,
866.859	we shouldn't forget to live.
869.446	Finally, you can see
871.673	I did have a choice
873.18	to choose one of the three quotes
874.467	with which I wanted to start my lecture.
878.491	I did have a choice,
880.39	such as nations, as people,
882.698	we have choices too to rethink
884.97	in what kind of society we want to live in the future.
888.282	Thank you.
890.333	(Applause)
