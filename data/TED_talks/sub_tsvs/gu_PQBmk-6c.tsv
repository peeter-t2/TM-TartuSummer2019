26	I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress
30	tell a very well known interviewer on television,
33	"""I'm really getting into the Internet lately."
35	"I just wish it were more organized."""
37	So ...
38	(Laughter)
42	If I controlled the Internet,
45	you could auction your broken heart on eBay.
49	Take the money; go to Amazon;
51	buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random
55	until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.
58	(Laughter)
59	If I were in charge of the Internet,
61	you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.
64	Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,
68	U-turn on silent treatment,
70	all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.
73	You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
76	Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,
79	but I still stretch miles in all directions.
81	If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com
87	would be one big website.
89	That way you could listen to cool music
91	while you pretend to look for a job
93	and you're really just chattin' with your pals.
95	(Laughter)
96	Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.
100	(Laughter)
102	They would not email you back
104	(Laughter) --
105	but you'd get an automated reply.
107	(Laughter)
109	Their name in your inbox
111	(Laughter) --
112	it's all you wanted anyway.
114	"And a message saying, ""Hey, it's me. I miss you."
117	(Laughter)
118	Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.
121	"Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."""
125	If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop
130	of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,
135	"trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, ""I am the emperor of oranges."
138	"I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."""
141	Now follow me, OK?
142	(Laughter)
143	Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.
146	One, two, three.
148	That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
150	That is my grandfather.
152	They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
154	He forms an attachment to
155	kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,
157	who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,
161	who grows up to be me --
164	the guy who usually goes too far.
166	So if I were emperor of the Internet,
169	I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?
172	But at that point, I would probably
174	already have the lowest possible mortgage
178	and the most enlarged possible penis
180	(Laughter) --
181	so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.
183	I wouldn't need it.
185	I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,
187	I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that --
191	pop! -- I'd go wireless.
194	(Laughter)
195	Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.
197	I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus
199	until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized
203	as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,
208	you want to bet just how whack and un-PC
212	your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking
214	hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
216	I guess it's just like life.
218	It is not a question of if you can --
220	it's: do ya?
222	We can interfere with the interface.
224	"We can make ""You've got Hallelujah"" the national anthem of cyberspace"
227	every lucky time we log on.
229	You don't say a prayer.
231	You don't write a psalm.
233	"You don't chant an ""om."""
235	You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of
239	at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
245	Thank you, TED.
246	(Applause)
