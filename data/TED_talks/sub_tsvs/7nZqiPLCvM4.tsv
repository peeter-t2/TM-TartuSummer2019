12.858	Vincent Moon: How can we use computers,
16.677	cameras, microphones to represent the world
21.172	in an alternative way,
23.336	as much as possible?
25.37	How, maybe, is it possible to use the Internet
28.324	to create a new form of cinema?
32.042	And actually, why do we record?
37.035	Well, it is with such simple questions in mind
39.953	that I started to make films 10 years ago,
43.936	first with a friend, Christophe Abric.
47.424	He had a website, La Blogothèque,
49.809	dedicated to independent music.
52.475	We were crazy about music.
54.13	We wanted to represent 
54.13	music in a different way,
56.822	to film the music we love,
56.822	the musicians we admired,
59.41	as much as possible, far 
59.41	from the music industry
62.871	and far from the cliches attached to it.
65.253	We started to publish every week
68.219	sessions on the Internet.
69.969	We are going to see a few extracts now.
77.944	From Grizzly Bear in the shower
81.744	to Sigur Ros playing in a Parisian cafe.
88.57	From Phoenix playing by the Eiffel Tower
93.358	to Tom Jones in his 
93.358	hotel room in New York.
98.241	From Arcade Fire in an elevator
100.707	in the Olympia
102.856	to Beirut going down
102.856	a staircase in Brooklyn.
108.486	From R.E.M. in a car
112.5	to The National around a table at night
114.863	in the south of France.
118.62	From Bon Iver playing with some friends
121.952	in an apartment in Montmartre
124.925	to Yeasayer having a long night,
128.783	and many, many, many more
131.866	unknown or very famous bands.
134.37	We published all those films
135.926	for free on the Internet,
137.882	and we wanted to share
140.898	all those films and represent music
143.068	in a different way.
145.828	We wanted to create 
145.828	another type of intimacy
148.998	using all those new technologies.
150.662	At the time, 10 years ago actually,
153.768	there was no such project on the Internet,
156.018	and I guess that's why the project we 
156.018	were making, the Take Away Shows,
159.663	got quite successful,
160.94	reaching millions of viewers.
164.72	After a while, I got a bit —
167.92	I wanted to go somewhere else.
169.83	I felt the need to travel and
169.83	to discover some other music,
172.8	to explore the world,
174.735	going to other corners,
176.523	and actually it was also
178.564	this idea of nomadic cinema,
178.564	sort of, that I had in mind.
182.535	How could the use of new technologies 
182.535	and the road fit together?
189.583	How could I edit my films in a bus
191.431	crossing the Andes?
193.466	So I went on five-year travels
195.4	around the globe.
197.334	I started at the time in the digital film 
197.334	and music label collection Petites Planètes,
202.31	which was also an homage to
202.31	French filmmaker Chris Marker.
205.526	We're going to see now a few more extracts
208.371	of those new films.
215.356	From the tecno brega diva of
215.356	northern Brazil, Gaby Amarantos
224.904	to a female ensemble in Chechnya.
231.241	From experimental electronic music 
231.241	in Singapore with One Man Nation
238.368	to Brazilian icon Tom Zé singing
238.368	on his rooftop in São Paolo.
246.672	From The Bambir, the great 
246.672	rock band from Armenia
251.846	to some traditional songs
254.303	in a restaurant in Tbilisi, Georgia.
259.731	From White Shoes, a great retro 
259.731	pop band from Jakarta, Indonesia
267.012	to DakhaBrakha, the revolutionary 
267.012	band from Kiev, Ukraine.
274.32	From Tomi Lebrero
276.02	and his bandoneon and his friends
276.02	in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
280.136	to many other places
282.735	and musicians around the world.
285.412	My desire was to make it as a trek.
288.381	To do all those films,
290.147	it would have been impossible
291.778	with a big company behind me,
293.229	with a structure or anything.
294.63	I was traveling alone with a backpack —
297.711	computer, camera, microphones in it.
300.18	Alone, actually, but 
300.18	just with local people,
302.965	meeting my team, which was absolutely not
305.8	professional people, on the spot there,
309.715	going from one place to another
311.976	and to make cinema as a trek.
313.457	I really believed that cinema could be
316.352	this very simple thing:
318.544	I want to make a film and you're going 
318.544	to give me a place to stay for the night.
323.263	I give you a moment of cinema
323.263	and you offer me a capirinha.
328.195	Well, or other drinks,
330.48	depending on where you are.
332.715	In Peru, they drink pisco sour.
336.172	Well, when I arrived in Peru, actually,
341.014	I had no idea about what I would do there.
346.289	And I just had one phone number, actually,
353.569	of one person.
355.064	Three months later,
356.407	after traveling all around the 
356.407	country, I had recorded 33 films,
360.735	only with the help of local people,
363.755	only with the help of people
366.217	that I was asking all the 
366.217	time the same question:
368.469	What is important to record here today?
373.515	By living in such a way,
375.343	by working without any structure,
378.174	I was able to react to the moment
383.369	and to decide, oh, this is 
383.369	important to make now.
386.787	This is important to 
386.787	record that whole person.
389.033	This is important to create this exchange.
393.049	When I went to Chechnya,
396.1	the first person I met
398.31	looked at me and was like,
400.52	"""What are you doing here?"
402.73	Are you a journalist? NGO? Politics?
405.734	What kind of problems 
405.734	"are you going to study?"""
408.872	Well, I was there to research
411.482	on Sufi rituals in Chechnya, actually —
414.44	incredible culture of Sufism in Chechnya,
417.575	which is absolutely unknown 
417.575	outside of the region.
422.849	As soon as people understood
424.903	that I would give them those films —
427.343	I would publish them online for free
427.343	under a Creative Commons license,
429.953	but I would also really 
429.953	give them to the people
431.955	and I would let them do 
431.955	what they want with it.
433.767	I just want to represent 
433.767	them in a beautiful light.
435.69	I just want to portray them in a way that
438.378	their grandchildren are going
438.378	to look at their grandfather,
441.649	and they're going to be like,
443.204	"""Whoa, my grandfather is as "
443.204	"cool as Beyoncé."" (Laughter)"
448.288	It's a really important thing.
450.144	(Applause)
453.643	It's really important,
454.948	because that's the way
456.604	people are going to look differently at 
456.604	their own culture, at their own land.
460.43	They're going to think about it differently.
462.614	It may be a way to maintain 
462.614	a certain diversity.
469.256	Why you will record?
472.549	Hmm. There's a really good quote
474.71	by American thinker Hakim Bey
476.634	"which says, ""Every recording"
480.06	"is a tombstone of a live performance."""
483.966	It's a really good 
483.966	sentence to keep in mind
486.981	nowadays in an era saturated by images.
490.889	What's the point of that?
492.409	Where do we go with it?
495.189	I was researching. I was still 
495.189	keeping this idea in mind:
498.47	What's the point?
501.085	I was researching on music, trying to pull,
503.305	trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.
506.173	Where is this all coming from?
508.367	I am French. I had no idea about
510.718	what I would discover, 
510.718	which is a very simple thing:
513.164	Everything was sacred, at first,
515.949	and music was spiritual healing.
521.472	How could I use my camera,
524.767	my little tool, to get closer
529.255	and maybe not only capture the trance
531.701	but find an equivalent, 
531.701	a cine-trance, maybe,
537.595	something in complete harmony
540.047	with the people?
542.815	That is now my new research I'm doing
547.154	on spirituality, on new 
547.154	spirits around the world.
551.575	Maybe a few more extracts now.
559.913	From the Tana Toraja 
559.913	funeral ritual in Indonesia
569.127	to an Easter ceremony 
569.127	in the north of Ethiopia.
575.629	From jathilan, a popular trance ritual
578.198	on the island of Java,
582.27	to Umbanda in the north of Brazil.
590.58	The Sufi rituals of Chechnya
597.386	to a mass in the holiest 
597.386	church of Armenia.
606.846	Some Sufi songs in Harar,
608.691	the holy city of Ethiopia,
614.102	to an ayahuasca ceremony
616.281	deep in the Amazon of 
616.281	Peru with the Shipibo.
623.996	Then to my new project, 
623.996	the one I'm doing now
626.162	"here in Brazil, named ""Híbridos."""
627.798	I'm doing it with Priscilla Telmon.
629.584	It's research on the new 
629.584	spiritualities all around the country.
634.547	This is my quest, my own little quest 
634.547	of what I call experimental ethnography,
640.505	trying to hybrid all 
640.505	those different genres,
648.773	trying to regain a certain complexity.
653.485	Why do we record?
656	I was still there.
658.681	I really believe cinema teaches us to see.
662.494	The way we show the world
663.9	is going to change the 
663.9	way we see this world,
668.15	and we live in a moment where the mass media
670.29	are doing a terrible, terrible job
672.899	at representing the world:
675.126	violence, extremists,
679.16	only spectacular events,
681.314	only simplifications of everyday life.
683.541	I think we are recording
685.666	to regain a certain complexity.
689.252	To reinvent life today,
694.423	we have to make new forms of images.
698.213	And it's very simple.
700.377	Muito obrigado.
703.06	(Applause)
714.204	Bruno Giussani: Vincent, Vincent, Vincent.
717.263	Merci. We have to prepare for
717.263	the following performance,
720.301	and I have a question for you,
720.301	and the question is this:
722.888	You show up in places like the 
722.888	ones you just have shown us,
726.914	and you are carrying a camera
728.818	and I assume that you are welcome
731.313	but you are not always absolutely welcome.
734	You walk into sacred rituals,
736.634	private moments in a village, a town,
740.471	a group of people.
742.68	How do you break the barrier
744.576	when you show up with a lens?
750	VM: I think you break it with your body,
752.605	more than with your knowledge.
755.243	That's what it taught me to travel,
757.61	to trust the memory of the body
760.433	more than the memory of the brain.
763.083	The respect is stepping forward,
765.395	not stepping backward, and I really think that
768.24	by engaging your body in the
768.24	moment, in the ceremony,
771.19	in the places, people welcome you
773.553	and understand your energy.
775.237	BG: You told me that most of the videos
776.9	you have made are 
776.9	actually one single shot.
779.569	You don't do much editing.
781.177	I mean, you edited the ones for us
782.921	at the beginning of the sessions
782.921	because of the length, etc.
785.486	Otherwise, you just go in and capture
787.313	whatever happens in front of your eyes
789.119	without much planning, and so is that the case?
791.853	It's correct?
793.586	VM: My idea is that I think that
795.594	as long as we don't cut, in a way,
799.614	as long as we let the viewer watch,
802.719	more and more viewers 
802.719	are going to feel closer,
805.688	are going to get closer to the moment,
808.501	to that moment and to that place.
812.337	I really think of that as a matter 
812.337	of respecting the viewer,
815.869	to not cut all the time from one place to another,
819.581	to just let the time go.
821.645	BG: Tell me in a few words 
821.645	about your new project,
823.749	"""Híbridos,"" here in Brazil."
825.284	Just before coming to 
825.284	TEDGlobal, you have actually
827.062	been traveling around 
827.062	the country for that.
829.333	Tell us a couple of things.
831.156	"VM: ""Híbridos"" is — "
831.156	I really believe Brazil,
833.485	far from the cliches, is the greatest
833.485	religious country in the world,
837.658	the greatest country 
837.658	in terms of spirituality
840.504	and in experimentations in spiritualities.
843.541	And it's a big project I'm 
843.541	doing over this year,
846.515	which is researching in very
846.515	different regions of Brazil,
851.315	in very different forms of cults,
853.42	and trying to understand 
853.42	how people live together
855.308	with spirituality nowadays.
856.753	BG: The man who is going to 
856.753	appear onstage momentarily,
860.489	and Vincent's going to introduce him,
862.199	is one of the subjects of 
862.199	one of his past videos.
865.851	When did you do a video with him?
867.718	VM: I guess four years ago,
870.272	four years in my first travel.
872.758	BG: So it was one of 
872.758	your first ones in Brazil.
875.602	VM: It was amongst the 
875.602	first ones in Brazil, yeah.
877.833	I shot the film in Recife,
879.29	in the place where he is from.
881.259	BG: So let's introduce him. 
881.259	Who are we waiting for?
884.269	VM: I'll just make it very short.
885.74	It's a very great honor for 
885.74	me to welcome onstage
888.343	one of the greatest Brazilian 
888.343	musicians of all time.
891.304	Please welcome Naná Vasconcelos.
893.643	BG: Naná Vasconcelos!
895.555	(Applause)
902.563	(Music)
1159.657	Naná Vasconcelos: Let's go to the jungle.
1439.636	(Applause)
