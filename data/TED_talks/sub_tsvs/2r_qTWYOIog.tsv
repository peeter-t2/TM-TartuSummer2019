12.739	Has anyone among you
12.739	ever been exposed to tear gas?
17.318	Tear gas? Anyone?
20.433	I'm sorry to hear that, so you might know
20.433	that it's a very toxic substance,
25.004	but you might not know
25.004	that it's a very simple molecule
28.428	with an unpronouncable name:
30.642	it's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.
35.779	It's decades old, but it's becoming
35.779	very trendy among police forces
41.137	around the planet lately, it seems,
44.016	and according to my experience
44.016	as a non-voluntary breather of it,
48.753	tear gas has two main
48.753	but quite opposite effects.
53.026	One, it can really burn your eyes,
56.168	and two, it can also
56.168	help you to open them.
60.603	Tear gas definitely helped
60.603	to open mine to something
64.192	that I want to share
64.192	with you this afternoon:
67.932	that livestreaming the power
67.932	of independent broadcasts through the web
73.226	can be a game-changer in journalism,
76.407	in activism, and as I see it,
76.407	in the political discourse as well.
82.749	That idea started 
82.749	to dawn on me in early 2011
87.522	when I was covering
87.522	a protest in São Paulo.
91.06	It was the marijuana march,
93.048	a gathering of people asking
93.048	for the legalization of cannabis.
97.01	When that group started to move,
99.475	the riot police came from the back
99.475	with rubber bullets, bombs,
103.785	and then the gas.
106.184	But to make a long story short,
108.202	I had entered that protest
108.202	as the editor-in-chief
112.091	of a well-established printed magazine
112.091	where I'd worked for 11 years,
116.864	and thanks to this unsolicited
116.864	effects of tear gas,
121.776	I left it as a journalist that was now
121.776	committed to new ways
126.709	of sharing the raw experience
126.709	of what it's like to be there, actually.
132.652	So in the following week,
132.652	I was back in the streets,
136.492	but that time, I wasn't a member
136.492	of any media outlet anymore.
140.555	I was there as an independent
140.555	livestreamer, and all I had with me
145.176	was basically borrowed equipment.
147.312	I had a very simple camera
147.312	and a backpack with 3G modems.
153.366	And I had this weblink
153.366	that could be shared through social media,
158.991	could be put in any website,
161.868	and that time,
161.868	the protest went along fine.
164.897	There was no violence.
166.746	There was no action scenes.
168.835	But there was something really exciting,
171.274	because I could see at a distance
171.274	the TV channels covering it,
176.124	and they had these big vans
176.124	and the teams and the cameras,
180.148	and I was basically doing the same thing
182.627	and all I had was a backpack.
185.403	And that was really
185.403	exciting to a journalist,
188.678	but the most interesting part
188.678	was when I got back home, actually,
193.059	because I learned that I had been watched
195.886	by more than 90,000 people,
198.99	and I got hundreds of emails and messages
198.99	of people asking me, basically,
203.895	how did I do it,
205.295	how it was possible to do such a thing.
208.611	And I learned something else,
208.611	that that was actually the first time
211.884	that somebody had ever done
211.884	a livestreaming in a street protest
217.022	in the country.
219.216	And that really shocked me,
221.758	because I was no geek,
221.758	I was no technology guy,
225.536	and all the equipment needed
225.536	was already there,
228.295	was easily available.
230.501	And I realized that
230.501	we had a frontier here,
233.617	a very important one,
235.08	that it was just a matter
235.08	of changing the perspective,
238.237	and the web could be actually used,
240.466	already used, as a colossal
240.466	and uncontrollable
243.908	and highly anarchical TV channel,
243.908	TV network,
247.721	and anyone with very basic skills
247.721	and very basic equipment,
252.905	even someone like me who had this
252.905	little stuttering issue,
258.748	so if it happens, bear with me please,
262.873	even someone like me
262.873	could become a broadcaster.
267.392	And that sounded revolutionary in my mind.
269.584	So for the next couple of years,
271.162	I started to experiment with
271.162	livestreaming in different ways,
275.209	not only in the streets
275.209	but mostly in studios and in homes,
278.815	until the beginning of 2013, last year,
282.123	when I became the cofounder of a group
282.123	called Mídia NINJA.
286.303	NINJA is an acronym
287.752	that stands for Narrativas Independentes 
287.752	Jornalismo e Ação,
291.582	or in English, independent narratives,
291.582	journalism, and action.
295.493	It was a media group
295.493	that had little media plan.
299.415	We didn't have any financial structure.
301.464	We were not planning
301.464	to make money out of this,
304.644	which was wise, because you shouldn't
304.644	try to make money out of journalism now.
310.484	But we had a very solid
310.484	and clear conviction,
313.188	that we knew that the hyperconnected
313.188	environment of social media
318.142	could maybe allow us to consolidate
320.773	a network of experimental journalists
320.773	throughout the country.
326.117	So we launched a Facebook page first,
326.117	and then a manifesto,
331.254	and started to cover the streets
331.254	in a very simple way.
334.992	But then something happened,
334.992	something that wasn't predicted,
339.31	that no one could have anticipated.
341.817	Street protests started
341.817	to erupt in São Paulo.
344.737	They began as very local and specific.
346.917	They were against the bus fare hike
346.917	that had just happened in the city.
352.227	This is a bus.
354.138	"It's written there, ""Theft."""
357.102	But those kind of manifestations
357.102	started to grow,
362.161	and they kept happening.
363.996	So the police violence against them
363.996	started to grow as well.
368.803	But there was another conflict,
370.512	the one I believe that's
370.512	more important here
373.016	to make my point that
373.016	it was a narrative conflict.
376.976	There was this mainstream media
376.976	version of the facts
380.006	that anyone who was on the streets
380.006	could easily challenge
384.292	if they presented their own vision
384.292	of what was actually happening there.
390.561	And it was this clash of visions,
390.561	this clash of narratives,
393.641	that I think turned those protests
396.983	into a long period in the country
396.983	of political reckoning
400.824	where hundreds of thousands of people,
404.332	probably more than a million people
406.15	took to the streets in the whole country.
409.638	But it wasn't about
409.638	the bus fare hike anymore.
412.252	It was about everything.
415.796	The people's demands, their expectations,
418.246	the reasons why they were on the streets
420.396	could be as diverse as they could
420.396	be contradictory in many cases.
425.235	If you could read it,
425.235	you would understand me.
429.343	But it was in this environment
429.343	of political catharsis
433.738	that the country was going through
436.687	that it had to do with politics, indeed,
439.984	but it had to do also
439.984	with a new way of organizing,
444.017	through a new way of communicating.
446.95	It was in that environment
446.95	that Mídia NINJA emerged
449.752	from almost anonymity
449.752	to become a national phenomenon,
454.435	because we did have the right equipment.
457.288	We are not using big cameras.
459.488	We are using basically this.
462.112	We are using smartphones.
464.111	And that, actually, allowed us to become
464.111	invisible in the middle of the protests,
469.019	but it allowed us to do something else:
471.701	to show what it was like
471.701	to be in the protests,
475.525	to present to people at home
475.525	a subjective perspective.
481.279	But there was something
481.279	that is more important,
483.615	I think, than the equipment.
484.971	It was our mindset,
487.699	because we are not behaving
487.699	as a media outlet.
490.87	We are not competing for news.
492.808	We are trying to encourage people,
495.129	to invite people,
495.129	and to actually teach people
497.985	how to do this, how they also
497.985	could become broadcasters.
502.195	And that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA
502.195	from a small group of people,
508.265	and in a matter of weeks,
509.915	we multiplied and we grew
509.915	exponentially throughout the country.
514.492	So in a matter of a week or two,
514.492	as the protests kept happening,
519.169	we were hundreds of young people
521.381	connected in this network
521.381	throughout the country.
524.186	We were covering more than
527.326	That's something that
527.326	no TV channel could ever do.
530.98	That was responsible
530.98	for turning us suddenly, actually,
534.393	into kind of the mainstream
534.393	media of social media.
539.319	So we had a couple of thousands
539.319	of followers on our Facebook page,
543.37	and soon we had a quarter
543.37	of a million followers.
546.606	Our posts and our videos
548.29	were being seen by more than
552.269	It was way more than any newspaper
552.269	or any magazine could ever do.
557.99	And that turned Mídia NINJA
557.99	into something else,
561.234	more than a media outlet,
561.234	than a media project.
564.675	It became almost like a public service
567.434	to the citizen, to the protester,
569.961	to the activist,
571.695	because they had a very simple
571.695	and efficient and peaceful tool
575.123	to confront both police
575.123	and media authority.
581.644	Many of our images started 
581.644	to be used in regular TV channels.
585.643	Our livestreams started to be broadcast
585.643	even in regular televisions
590.474	when things got really rough.
592.433	Some our images were responsible
592.433	to take some people out of jail,
597.73	people who were being arrested unfairly
600.569	under false accusations,
600.569	and we could prove them innocent.
604.338	And that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon
607.579	to be seen as almost
607.579	an enemy of cops, unfortunately,
611.59	and we started to be severely beaten,
611.59	and eventually arrested on the streets.
616.663	It happened in many cases.
618.577	But that was also useful,
618.577	because we were still at the web,
622.909	so that helped to trigger
622.909	an important debate in the country
628.094	on the role of the media itself
630.543	and the state of the freedom
630.543	of the press in the country.
634.142	So Mídia NINJA now evolved
636.093	and finally consolidated itself
636.093	in what we hoped it would become:
642.143	a national network
642.143	of hundreds of young people,
645.427	self-organizing themselves locally
649.304	to cover social, human rights issues,
653.065	and expressing themselves
653.065	not only politically
655.833	but journalistically.
660.665	What I started to do
660.665	in the beginning of this year,
665	as Mídia NINJA is already
665	a self-organizing network,
669.156	I'm dedicating myself to another project.
672.589	It's called Fluxo,
672.589	"which is Portuguese for ""stream."""
675.835	It's a journalism studio
675.835	in São Paulo downtown,
678.642	where I used livestream to experiment
681.969	with what I call post-television formats.
685.474	But I'm also trying to come up with ways
685.474	to finance independent journalism
690.852	through a direct relationship
690.852	with an audience,
693.664	with an active audience,
695.626	because now I really want
695.626	to try to make a living
698.296	out of my tear gas resolution back then.
702.058	But there's something
702.058	more significant here,
704.348	something that I believe is more important
704.348	and more crucial than my personal example.
709.794	I said that livestream could turn the web
709.794	into a colossal TV network,
714.629	but I believe it does something else,
716.666	because after watching people using it,
719.627	not only to cover things but to express,
719.627	to organize themselves politically,
725.651	I believe livestream can turn cyberspace
725.651	into a global political arena
732.419	where everyone might have a voice,
734.803	a proper voice,
736.347	because livestream takes the monopoly
736.347	of the broadcast political discourse,
741.832	of the verbal aspect
741.832	of the political dialogue
744.585	out of the mouths of just politicians
744.585	and political pundits alone,
750.194	and it empowers the citizen
750.194	through this direct and non-mediated power
755.664	of exchanging experiences and dialogue,
758.647	empowers them to question
758.647	and to influence authorities
762.697	in ways in which we are about to see.
766.226	And I believe it does something else
766.226	that might be even more important,
770.78	that the simplicity of the technology
770.78	can merge objectivity and subjectivity
777.47	in a very political way, as I see it,
780.133	because it really helps the audience,
785.302	the citizen, to see the world
785.302	through somebody else's eye,
789.796	so it helps the citizen
789.796	to put him- or herself
793.23	in other people's place.
795.902	And that idea, I think, 
795.902	should be the intention,
799.17	should be the goal of any good journalism,
799.17	any good activism,
803.885	but most of all, any good politics.
806.537	Thank you very much. It was an honor.
809.065	(Applause)
