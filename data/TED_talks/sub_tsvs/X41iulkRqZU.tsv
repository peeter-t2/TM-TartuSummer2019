12.862	My seven-year-old grandson
12.862	sleeps just down the hall from me,
16.364	and he wakes up a lot of mornings
18.054	and he says,
19.616	"""You know, this could be"
19.616	"the best day ever."""
22.385	And other times,
22.385	in the middle of the night,
24.586	he calls out in a tremulous voice,
27.536	"""Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"""
31.018	I think this pretty much says it for me
31.018	and most of the people I know,
35.484	that we're a mixed grill
35.484	of happy anticipation
38.788	and dread.
40.4	So I sat down a few days
40.4	before my 61st birthday,
44.646	and I decided to compile a list
44.646	of everything I know for sure.
49.837	There's so little truth
49.837	in the popular culture,
52.984	and it's good to be sure of a few things.
57.037	For instance, I am no longer 47,
60.665	although this is the age I feel,
63.469	and the age I like to think
63.469	of myself as being.
66.674	My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s
69.371	that he felt like a young man
69.371	with something really wrong with him.
72.978	(Laughter)
76.852	Our true person is outside
76.852	of time and space,
79.716	but looking at the paperwork,
81.25	I can, in fact, see
81.25	that I was born in 1954.
85.173	My inside self is outside
85.173	of time and space.
88.149	It doesn't have an age.
90.218	I'm every age I've ever been,
90.218	and so are you,
93.591	although I can't help
93.591	mentioning as an aside
96.299	that it might have been helpful
96.299	if I hadn't followed
98.954	the skin care rules of the '60s,
101.499	which involved getting
101.499	as much sun as possible
104.917	while slathered in baby oil
107.487	and basking in the glow
107.487	of a tinfoil reflector shield.
111.758	(Laughter)
113.496	It was so liberating, though,
113.496	to face the truth
116.118	that I was no longer
116.118	in the last throes of middle age,
119.49	that I decided to write down
119.49	every single true thing I know.
123.866	People feel really doomed
123.866	and overwhelmed these days,
127.288	and they keep asking me what's true.
130.034	So I hope that my list of things
130.034	I'm almost positive about
136.407	might offer some basic
136.407	operating instructions
139.496	to anyone who is feeling
139.496	really overwhelmed or beleaguered.
143.96	Number one:
145.866	the first and truest thing
145.866	is that all truth is a paradox.
149.551	Life is both a precious,
149.551	unfathomably beautiful gift,
153.89	and it's impossible here,
153.89	on the incarnational side of things.
158.596	It's been a very bad match
160.24	for those of us who were born
160.24	extremely sensitive.
163.53	It's so hard and weird
163.53	that we sometimes wonder
166.418	if we're being punked.
168.822	It's filled simultaneously
168.822	with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,
173.8	desperate poverty,
175.599	floods and babies and acne and Mozart,
179.167	all swirled together.
181.33	I don't think it's an ideal system.
183.924	(Laughter)
187.264	Number two: almost
187.264	everything will work again
190.683	if you unplug it for a few minutes --
193.048	(Laughter)
195.767	(Applause)
199.073	including you.
202.795	Three: there is almost
202.795	nothing outside of you
206.057	that will help in any kind of lasting way,
208.993	unless you're waiting for an organ.
211.778	You can't buy, achieve or date
211.778	serenity and peace of mind.
216.74	This is the most horrible truth,
216.74	and I so resent it.
221.369	But it's an inside job,
223.617	and we can't arrange peace
223.617	or lasting improvement
226.459	for the people we love most in the world.
228.871	They have to find their own ways,
230.975	their own answers.
232.621	You can't run alongside
232.621	your grown children
236.272	with sunscreen and ChapStick
236.272	on their hero's journey.
240.882	You have to release them.
243.023	It's disrespectful not to.
246.908	And if it's someone else's problem,
248.791	you probably don't have
248.791	the answer, anyway.
251.115	(Laughter)
252.331	Our help is usually not very helpful.
255.568	Our help is often toxic.
258.644	And help is the sunny side of control.
262.656	Stop helping so much.
265.154	Don't get your help and goodness
265.154	all over everybody.
268.635	(Laughter)
271.171	(Applause)
272.856	This brings us to number four:
274.853	everyone is screwed up,
274.853	broken, clingy and scared,
278.761	even the people who seem
278.761	to have it most together.
281.76	They are much more like you
281.76	than you would believe,
284.223	so try not to compare your insides
284.223	to other people's outsides.
288.895	It will only make you worse
288.895	than you already are.
291.785	(Laughter)
296.092	Also, you can't save, fix
296.092	or rescue any of them
299.587	or get anyone sober.
301.646	What helped me get clean
301.646	and sober 30 years ago
304.424	was the catastrophe
304.424	of my behavior and thinking.
308.059	So I asked some sober friends for help,
310.089	and I turned to a higher power.
312.047	One acronym for God
312.047	"is the ""gift of desperation,"""
316.13	G-O-D,
317.583	or as a sober friend put it,
319.639	by the end I was deteriorating faster
319.639	than I could lower my standards.
324.63	(Laughter)
330.965	So God might mean, in this case,
333.299	"""me running out of any more good ideas."""
337.352	While fixing and saving
337.352	and trying to rescue is futile,
341.542	radical self-care is quantum,
344.977	and it radiates out from you
344.977	into the atmosphere
348.617	like a little fresh air.
350.286	It's a huge gift to the world.
352.891	When people respond by saying,
352.891	"""Well, isn't she full of herself,"""
357.425	just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa
360.415	and make both of you a nice cup of tea.
364.425	Being full of affection
364.425	for one's goofy, self-centered,
369.132	cranky, annoying self
371.649	is home.
373.202	It's where world peace begins.
376.858	Number five:
378.599	chocolate with 75 percent cacao
378.599	is not actually a food.
383.687	(Laughter)
387.723	Its best use is as a bait in snake traps
391.827	or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.
396.411	It was never meant
396.411	to be considered an edible.
401.685	Number six --
403.074	(Laughter)
406.602	writing.
408.694	Every writer you know writes
408.694	really terrible first drafts,
413.106	but they keep their butt in the chair.
415.283	That's the secret of life.
417.027	That's probably the main difference
417.027	between you and them.
420.251	They just do it.
421.737	They do it by prearrangement
421.737	with themselves.
424.327	They do it as a debt of honor.
427.156	They tell stories that come through them
429.474	one day at a time, little by little.
432.008	When my older brother was in fourth grade,
434.258	he had a term paper on birds
434.258	due the next day,
438.256	and he hadn't started.
440.56	So my dad sat down with him
440.56	with an Audubon book,
444.666	paper, pencils and brads --
447.034	for those of you who have gotten
447.034	a little less young and remember brads --
452.658	and he said to my brother,
455.512	"""Just take it bird by bird, buddy."
458.146	Just read about pelicans
460.485	and then write about pelicans
460.485	in your own voice.
464.365	And then find out about chickadees,
467.544	and tell us about them in your own voice.
470.339	"And then geese."""
472.109	So the two most important things
472.109	about writing are: bird by bird
475.881	and really god-awful first drafts.
479.779	If you don't know where to start,
481.478	remember that every single thing
481.478	that happened to you is yours,
484.731	and you get to tell it.
486.672	If people wanted you to write
486.672	more warmly about them,
489.858	they should've behaved better.
491.602	(Laughter)
494.656	(Applause)
498.965	You're going to feel like hell
498.965	if you wake up someday
501.862	and you never wrote the stuff
503.647	that is tugging on the sleeves
503.647	of your heart:
507.132	your stories, memories,
507.132	visions and songs --
510.552	your truth,
512.229	your version of things --
514.078	in your own voice.
515.587	That's really all you have to offer us,
518.086	and that's also why you were born.
522.308	Seven: publication and temporary
522.308	creative successes
526.517	are something you have to recover from.
529.564	They kill as many people as not.
532.43	They will hurt, damage and change you
534.984	in ways you cannot imagine.
537.527	The most degraded
537.527	and evil people I've ever known
541.067	are male writers who've had
541.067	huge best sellers.
544.913	And yet, returning to number one,
544.913	that all truth is paradox,
549.094	it's also a miracle
549.094	to get your work published,
551.543	to get your stories read and heard.
554.403	Just try to bust yourself
554.403	gently of the fantasy
557.182	that publication will heal you,
559.66	that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy
559.66	holes inside of you.
563.768	It can't.
565.386	It won't.
566.77	But writing can.
568.499	So can singing in a choir
568.499	or a bluegrass band.
572.121	So can painting community
572.121	murals or birding
575.452	or fostering old dogs
575.452	that no one else will.
580.39	Number eight: families.
584.703	Families are hard, hard, hard,
587.823	no matter how cherished
587.823	and astonishing they may also be.
591.273	Again, see number one.
593.423	(Laughter)
594.494	At family gatherings where you suddenly
594.494	feel homicidal or suicidal --
598.806	(Laughter)
599.846	remember that in all cases,
602.201	it's a miracle that any of us,
602.201	specifically, were conceived and born.
608.34	Earth is forgiveness school.
610.291	It begins with forgiving yourself,
612.425	and then you might as well
612.425	start at the dinner table.
616.46	That way, you can do this work
616.46	in comfortable pants.
620.129	(Laughter)
623.099	When William Blake said that we are here
625.07	to learn to endure the beams of love,
628.082	he knew that your family would be
628.082	an intimate part of this,
631.439	even as you want to run screaming
631.439	for your cute little life.
635.631	But I promise you are up to it.
638.214	You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,
641.618	and you will be amazed.
644.984	Nine: food.
648.007	Try to do a little better.
651.317	I think you know what I mean.
653.231	(Laughter)
662.979	Number 10 --
664.154	(Laughter)
666.402	grace.
668.248	Grace is spiritual WD-40,
671.379	or water wings.
672.883	The mystery of grace is that God loves
672.883	Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin
678.874	and me
680.057	exactly as much as He or She
680.057	loves your new grandchild.
684.808	Go figure.
686.049	(Laughter)
687.85	The movement of grace
687.85	is what changes us, heals us
691.211	and heals our world.
693.233	"To summon grace, say, ""Help,"""
693.233	and then buckle up.
697.028	Grace finds you exactly where you are,
699.742	but it doesn't leave you
699.742	where it found you.
702.291	And grace won't look
702.291	like Casper the Friendly Ghost,
705.411	regrettably.
707.04	But the phone will ring
707.04	or the mail will come
709.447	and then against all odds,
710.951	you'll get your sense of humor
710.951	about yourself back.
714.391	Laughter really is carbonated holiness.
718.694	It helps us breathe again and again
721.41	and gives us back to ourselves,
723.567	and this gives us faith
723.567	in life and each other.
728.315	And remember -- grace always bats last.
733.472	Eleven: God just means goodness.
736.605	It's really not all that scary.
739.07	It means the divine or a loving,
739.07	animating intelligence,
743.544	or, as we learned
743.544	"from the great ""Deteriorata,"""
747.293	"""the cosmic muffin."""
749.62	"A good name for God is: ""Not me."""
753.647	Emerson said that
753.647	the happiest person on Earth
756.417	is the one who learns from nature
756.417	the lessons of worship.
760.619	So go outside a lot and look up.
763.769	My pastor said you can trap bees
763.769	on the bottom of mason jars without lids
768.296	because they don't look up,
770.033	so they just walk around bitterly
770.033	bumping into the glass walls.
774.457	Go outside. Look up.
776.849	Secret of life.
779.297	And finally: death.
782.193	Number 12.
784.466	Wow and yikes.
787.195	It's so hard to bear when the few people
787.195	you cannot live without die.
791.444	You'll never get over these losses,
791.444	and no matter what the culture says,
795.105	you're not supposed to.
796.996	We Christians like to think of death
796.996	as a major change of address,
802.163	but in any case, the person
802.163	will live again fully in your heart
806.773	if you don't seal it off.
808.789	Like Leonard Cohen said,
808.789	"""There are cracks in everything,"
811.581	"and that's how the light gets in."""
813.458	And that's how we feel
813.458	our people again fully alive.
819.06	Also, the people will make
819.06	you laugh out loud
823.095	at the most inconvenient times,
826.185	and that's the great good news.
828.283	But their absence will also be a lifelong
828.283	nightmare of homesickness for you.
832.762	Grief and friends, time and tears
832.762	will heal you to some extent.
837.467	Tears will bathe and baptize
837.467	and hydrate and moisturize you
841.742	and the ground on which you walk.
844.095	Do you know the first thing
844.095	that God says to Moses?
847.848	"He says, ""Take off your shoes."""
850.899	Because this is holy ground,
850.899	all evidence to the contrary.
854.963	It's hard to believe,
854.963	but it's the truest thing I know.
858.052	When you're a little bit older,
858.052	like my tiny personal self,
862.218	you realize that death
862.218	is as sacred as birth.
866.605	And don't worry -- get on with your life.
870.225	Almost every single death
870.225	is easy and gentle
874.744	with the very best people surrounding you
877.784	for as long as you need.
879.651	You won't be alone.
882.506	They'll help you cross over
882.506	to whatever awaits us.
886.691	As Ram Dass said,
888.452	"""When all is said and done,"
890.336	we're really just all walking
890.336	"each other home."""
894.844	I think that's it,
896.456	but if I think of anything else,
898.582	I'll let you know.
900.068	Thank you.
901.295	(Applause)
902.898	Thank you.
904.198	(Applause)
906.03	I was very surprised to be asked to come,
908.208	because it is not my realm,
910.915	technology or design or entertainment.
913.266	I mean, my realm is sort of
913.266	faith and writing
916.471	and kind of lurching along together.
919.445	And I was surprised,
921.232	but they said I could give a talk,
921.232	and I said I'd love to.
925.529	(Video) If you don't know where to start,
927.605	remember that every single thing
927.605	that happened to you is yours
930.754	and you get to tell it.
932.156	Anne Lamott: People are very frightened
932.156	and feel really doomed
935.285	in America these days,
936.497	and I just wanted to help people
936.497	get their sense of humor about it
939.662	and to realize how much isn't a problem.
943.284	If you take an action,
947.359	take a really healthy or loving
947.359	or friendly action,
950.946	you'll have loving and friendly feelings.
