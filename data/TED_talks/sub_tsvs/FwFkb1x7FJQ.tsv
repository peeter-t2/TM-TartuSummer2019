25.64	In terms of invention,
26.88	I'd like to tell you the tale
26.88	of one of my favorite projects.
29.762	I think it's one of the most exciting
29.762	that I'm working on,
33.08	but I think it's also the simplest.
35.16	It's a project that has the potential
35.16	to make a huge impact around the world.
39.64	It addresses one of the biggest
39.64	health issues on the planet,
43.08	the number one cause of death
43.08	in children under five.
46.64	Which is ...?
48.68	Water-borne diseases?
48.68	Diarrhea? Malnutrition?
52.2	No.
53.88	It's breathing the smoke
53.88	from indoor cooking fires --
57.52	acute respiratory infections
57.52	caused by this.
61.04	Can you believe that?
62.88	I find this shocking
62.88	and somewhat appalling.
66.16	Can't we make
66.16	cleaner burning cooking fuels?
68.8	Can't we make better stoves?
70.76	How is it that this can lead
70.76	to over two million deaths every year?
74.8	I know Bill Joy was talking to you
74.8	about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,
79.16	so I'm going to talk to you
79.16	about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,
83	which is charcoal.
84.24	(Laughter)
86.24	So this is a picture of rural Haiti.
88.44	Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.
91.76	You'll see scenes like this
91.76	all over the island.
94.88	It leads to all sorts
94.88	of environmental problems
97.68	and problems that affect people
97.68	throughout the nation.
101.96	A couple years ago
101.96	there was severe flooding
104.04	that led to thousands of deaths --
105.684	that's directly attributable to the fact
107.64	that there are no trees on the hills
107.64	to stabilize the soil.
110.64	So the rains come --
111.92	they go down the rivers
111.92	and the flooding happens.
115.44	Now one of the reasons
115.44	why there are so few trees is this:
118.92	people need to cook,
120.32	and they harvest wood
120.32	and they make charcoal in order to do it.
124.44	It's not that people are ignorant
124.44	to the environmental damage.
127.369	They know perfectly well,
127.369	but they have no other choice.
130.013	Fossil fuels are not available,
132.04	and solar energy doesn't cook the way
132.04	that they like their food prepared.
136.96	And so this is what they do.
139.12	You'll find families like this who go out
139.12	into the forest to find a tree,
143.32	cut it down and make charcoal out of it.
147.44	So not surprisingly,
148.68	there's a lot of effort that's been done
148.68	to look at alternative cooking fuels.
154.36	About four years ago, I took
154.36	a team of students down to Haiti
157.44	and we worked with
157.44	Peace Corps volunteers there.
159.88	This is one such volunteer
161.32	and this is a device that he had built
161.32	in the village where he worked.
164.96	And the idea was
164.96	that you could take waste paper;
167.64	you could compress it
168.88	and make briquettes
168.88	that could be used for fuel.
171.56	But this device was very slow.
173.6	So our engineering students
173.6	went to work on it
176.72	and with some very simple changes,
178.84	they were able to triple
178.84	the throughput of this device.
181.92	So you could imagine
181.92	they were very excited about it.
184.48	And they took the briquettes back to MIT
184.48	so that they could test them.
189	And one of the things
189	that they found was they didn't burn.
193.28	So it was a little
193.28	discouraging to the students.
196.08	(Laughter)
197.64	And in fact, if you look closely,
200.04	right here you can see
200.04	"it says, ""US Peace Corps."""
203.64	As it turns out, there actually wasn't
203.64	any waste paper in this village.
207.48	And while it was a good use
207.48	of government paperwork
210.72	for this volunteer to bring it
210.72	back with him to his village,
213.649	it was 800 kilometers away.
215.76	And so we thought perhaps
215.76	there might be a better way
218.68	to come up with
218.68	an alternative cooking fuel.
221.64	What we wanted to do
221.64	is we wanted to make a fuel
223.92	that used something that was
223.92	readily available on the local level.
227.28	You see these all over Haiti as well.
229.08	They're small-scale sugar mills.
230.84	And the waste product from them
232.36	after you extract the juice
232.36	from the sugarcane
234.8	"is called ""bagasse."""
236.36	It has no other use.
237.6	It has no nutritional value,
237.6	so they don't feed it to the animals.
240.92	It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill
240.92	until eventually they burn it.
246.04	What we wanted to do was
246.04	we wanted to find a way
248.36	to harness this waste resource
248.36	and turn it into a fuel
251.36	that would be something
251.36	that people could easily cook with,
254.36	something like charcoal.
256.6	So over the next couple of years,
258.24	students and I worked
258.24	to develop a process.
261.92	So you start with the bagasse,
261.92	and then you take a very simple kiln
265.76	that you can make out of
265.76	a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
268.96	After some time, after setting it on fire,
271.28	you seal it to restrict the oxygen
271.28	that goes into the kiln,
275.28	and then you end up
275.28	with this carbonized material here.
279.08	However, you can't burn this.
280.68	It's too fine and it burns too quickly
280.68	to be useful for cooking.
285.399	So we had to try to find a way
285.399	to form it into useful briquettes.
289.68	And conveniently,
289.68	one of my students was from Ghana,
293.12	and he remembered a dish his mom
293.12	"used to make for him called ""kokonte,"""
296.478	which is a very sticky porridge
296.478	made out of the cassava root.
299.96	And so what we did was we looked,
301.56	and we found that cassava
301.56	is indeed grown in Haiti,
304.68	"under the name of ""manioc."""
306.84	In fact, it's grown all over the world --
308.817	yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,
308.817	it's all the same thing --
311.92	a very starchy root vegetable.
314.04	And you can make a very thick,
314.04	sticky porridge out of it,
317.28	which you can use to bind together
317.28	the charcoal briquettes.
321.44	So we did this. We went down to Haiti.
324.64	These are the graduates
324.64	of the first Ecole de Charbon,
327.32	or Charcoal Institute.
329.04	And these --
330.28	(Laughter)
331.52	That's right. So I'm actually
331.52	an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.
337.52	And these are the briquettes that we made.
341.04	Now I'm going to take you
341.04	to a different continent.
344.32	This is India
345.56	and this is the most commonly used
345.56	cooking fuel in India.
348.8	It's cow dung.
350.2	And more than in Haiti,
350.2	this produces really smoky fires,
354.4	and this is where you see
354.4	the health impacts
356.88	of cooking with cow dung
356.88	and biomass as a fuel.
361.6	Kids and women
361.6	are especially affected by it,
363.84	because they're the ones
363.84	who are around the cooking fires.
367	So we wanted to see
368.24	if we could introduce
368.24	this charcoal-making technology there.
371.76	Well, unfortunately,
371.76	they didn't have sugarcane
374.2	and they didn't have cassava,
375.605	but that didn't stop us.
377.4	What we did was we found what were
377.4	the locally available sources of biomass.
381.24	And there was wheat straw
381.24	and there was rice straw in this area.
384.64	And what we could use as a binder
384.64	was actually small amounts of cow manure,
388.28	which they used ordinarily for their fuel.
391.96	And we did side-by-side tests,
394.16	and here you can see
394.16	the charcoal briquettes
396.76	and here the cow dung.
398	And you can see that it's a lot cleaner
398	burning of a cooking fuel.
401.28	And in fact, it heats the water
401.28	a lot more quickly.
403.88	And so we were very happy, thus far.
406.2	But one of the things that we found
407.92	was when we did side-by-side
407.92	comparisons with wood charcoal,
410.76	it didn't burn as long.
412.4	And the briquettes crumbled a little bit
414.329	and we lost energy as they fell apart
414.329	as they were cooking.
417.52	So we wanted to try to find a way
417.52	to make a stronger briquette
420.76	so that we could compete with
420.76	wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.
425.32	So we went back to MIT,
427.36	we took out the Instron machine
429.6	and we figured out
429.6	what sort of forces you needed
432.32	in order to compress
432.32	a briquette to the level
434.44	that you actually are getting
434.44	improved performance out of it?
437.96	And at the same time that we had
437.96	students in the lab looking at this,
441.28	we also had community partners in Haiti
441.28	working to develop the process,
448.24	to improve it and make it more accessible
448.24	to people in the villages there.
454.16	And after some time,
455.4	we developed a low-cost press
455.4	that allows you to produce charcoal,
460.24	which actually now burns not only --
463.642	actually, it burns longer,
463.642	cleaner than wood charcoal.
467.4	So now we're in a situation
467.4	where we have a product,
469.96	which is actually better than what
469.96	you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,
474.28	which is a very wonderful place to be.
478.96	In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees
478.96	are cut down every year.
483.72	There's a possibility
483.72	of this being implemented
486.24	and saving a good portion of those.
488.56	In addition, the revenue generated
488.56	from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.
495	That's an awful lot
495	for a country like Haiti --
497.56	with a population of eight million
499.44	and an average income
499.44	of less than 400 dollars.
503.68	So this is where we're also moving ahead
503.68	with our charcoal project.
507.56	And one of the things
507.56	that I think is also interesting,
510.24	is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley
510.24	who's been doing risk analysis.
514.56	And he's looked at the problem
514.56	of the health impacts
517.64	of burning wood versus charcoal.
519.76	And he's found that worldwide,
519.76	you could prevent a million deaths
523.88	switching from wood
523.88	to charcoal as a cooking fuel.
526.88	That's remarkable,
528.12	but up until now, there weren't ways
528.12	to do it without cutting down trees.
531.6	But now we have a way
532.84	that's using an agricultural
532.84	waste material to create a cooking fuel.
536.96	One of the really exciting things, though,
539	is something that came out of the trip
539	that I took to Ghana just last month.
542.596	And I think it's the coolest thing,
546.039	and it's even lower tech
546.039	than what you just saw,
548.303	if you can imagine such a thing.
550.36	Here it is.
551.6	So what is this?
553.48	This is corncobs turned into charcoal.
556.08	And the beauty of this is
556.08	that you don't need to form briquettes --
559.247	it comes ready made.
560.6	This is my $100 laptop, right here.
563.48	And actually, like Nick,
563.48	I brought samples.
566.52	(Laughter)
568.76	So we can pass these around.
572.52	They're fully functional,
572.52	field-tested, ready to roll out.
576.628	(Laughter)
580.52	And I think one of the things
582.04	which is also remarkable
582.04	about this technology,
586.28	is that the technology
586.28	transfer is so easy.
589.08	Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,
591.24	where we have to teach people
591.24	how to form it into briquettes
594.08	and you have the extra step
594.08	of cooking the binder,
596.52	this comes pre-briquetted.
598.12	And this is about the most exciting
598.12	thing in my life right now,
601.097	which is perhaps
601.097	a sad commentary on my life.
604.32	(Laughter)
606.6	But once you see it,
606.6	like you guys in the front row --
609.16	All right, yeah, OK.
610.4	So anyway --
611.64	(Laughter)
613.68	Here it is.
614.92	And this is, I think, a perfect example
617.4	of what Robert Wright was talking about
617.4	in those non-zero-sum things.
622.64	So not only do you have health benefits,
625.16	you have environmental benefits.
627.32	But this is one
627.32	of the incredibly rare situations
631.16	where you also have economic benefits.
633.52	People can make their own cooking fuel
633.52	from waste products.
636.6	They can generate income from this.
638.64	They can save the money
638.64	that they were going to spend on charcoal
641.8	and they can produce excess
641.8	and sell it in the market
644.301	to people who aren't making their own.
646.28	It's really rare
646.28	that you don't have trade-offs
648.6	between health and economics,
648.6	or environment and economics.
651.84	So this is a project
651.84	that I just find extremely exciting
655.6	and I'm really looking forward
655.6	to see where it takes us.
663.12	So when we talk about, now,
663.12	the future we will create,
666.64	one of the things
666.64	that I think is necessary
668.68	is to have a very clear vision
668.68	of the world that we live in.
673.16	And now, I don't actually mean
673.16	the world that we live in.
676.92	I mean the world where women
676.92	spend two to three hours everyday
681.04	grinding grain for their families to eat.
684.96	I mean the world
684.96	where advanced building materials
687.36	means cement roofing tiles
687.36	that are made by hand,
690.8	and where, when you work 10 hours a day,
692.96	you're still only earning
697.32	I mean the world
698.56	where women and children spend
705.52	That's as if the entire workforce
705.52	of the state of California
709.28	worked full time for a year
709.28	doing nothing but fetching water.
713.8	It's a place where,
713.8	for example, if this were India,
718.16	in this room, only three of us
718.16	would have a car.
721.36	If this were Afghanistan,
722.6	only one person in this room
722.6	would know how the use the Internet.
726.24	If this were Zambia --
734.4	And more than half of you would be living
734.4	on less than a dollar a day.
739.28	These are the issues that we
739.28	need to come up with solutions for.
744.04	These are the issues that
744.04	we need to be training our engineers,
747.92	our designers, our business people,
747.92	our entrepreneurs to be facing.
752.28	These are the solutions
752.28	that we need to find.
755	I have a few areas that I believe
755	are especially important that we address.
761.2	One of them is creating technologies
763.28	to promote micro-finance
763.28	and micro-enterprise,
766.32	so that people who are living
766.32	below the poverty line
769.2	can find a way to move out --
770.76	and that they're not doing it
772.165	using the same traditional
772.165	basket making, poultry rearing, etc.
775.8	But there are new technologies
775.8	and new products
778.015	that they can make on a small scale.
780.8	The next thing I believe
782.04	is that we need to create
782.04	technologies for poor farmers
786.44	to add value to their own crops.
789.6	And we need to rethink
789.6	our development strategies,
792.28	so that we're not promoting
792.28	educational campaigns
795.56	to get them to stop being farmers,
797.96	but rather to stop being poor farmers.
800.76	And we need to think
800.76	about how we can do that effectively.
804.56	We need to work with the people
804.56	in these communities
807.24	and give them the resources
807.24	and the tools that they need
810.12	to solve their own problems.
811.84	That's the best way to do it.
813.245	We shouldn't be doing it from outside.
815.56	So we need to create this future,
815.56	and we need to start doing it now.
820.24	Thank you.
821.48	(Applause)
826.76	Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.
829.32	Stay here.
831.36	Tell us -- just while we see
831.36	if someone has a question --
834.28	just tell us about one of the other things
834.28	that you've worked on.
837.72	Amy Smith: Some of the other
837.72	things we're working on
840.24	are ways to do low-cost
840.24	water quality testing,
842.441	so that communities can maintain
842.441	their own water systems,
845.2	know when they're working,
845.2	know when they treat them, etc.
847.939	We're also looking at low-cost
847.939	water-treatment systems.
850.6	One of the really exciting things
850.6	is looking at solar water disinfection
854.005	and improving the ability
854.005	to be able to do that.
857.32	CA: What's the bottleneck
857.32	preventing this stuff getting from scale?
861.28	Do you need to find entrepreneurs,
861.28	or venture capitalists,
864.56	or what do you need to take
864.56	what you've got and get it to scale?
869.44	AS: I think it's large numbers
869.44	of people moving it forward.
872.234	It's a difficult thing --
873.457	it's a marketplace
873.457	which is very fragmented
875.488	and a consumer population with no income.
877.72	So you can't use the same models
877.72	that you use in the United States
881	for making things move forward.
882.56	And we're a pretty small staff,
884.6	which is me.
885.84	(Laughter)
887.84	So, you know,
887.84	I do what I can with the students.
890.103	We have 30 students a year
890.103	go out into the field
892.366	and try to implement this
892.366	and move it forward.
894.84	The other thing is you have to do things
894.84	with a long time frame,
898.36	as, you know, you can't expect to get
898.36	something done in a year or two years;
902.32	you have to be looking
902.32	five or 10 years ahead.
904.487	But I think with the vision to do that,
904.487	we can move forward.
