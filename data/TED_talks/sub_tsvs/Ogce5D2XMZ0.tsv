12.25	I'd like to take you back
12.25	about seven years in my life.
16.05	Friday afternoon,
17.17	a few days before Christmas 2009.
20.21	I was the director of operations
22.13	at a consumer products company
22.13	in San Francisco,
25.24	and I was called into a meeting
25.24	that was already in progress.
29.15	That meeting turned out
29.15	to be my exit interview.
32.15	I was fired, along with several others.
36.09	I was 64 years old at the time.
40.02	It wasn't completely unexpected.
42.01	I signed a stack of papers,
44.14	gathered my personal effects,
46.07	and left to join my wife
48.03	who was waiting for me
48.03	at a nearby restaurant,
50.22	completely unaware.
53.05	Fast-forward several hours,
55.22	we both got really silly drunk.
57.23	(Laughter)
60.18	So, 40 plus years of continuous employment
65.06	for a variety of companies,
65.06	large and small,
67.22	was over.
69.02	I had a good a network,
69.02	a good reputation --
72.04	I thought I'd be just fine.
74.18	I was an engineer
74.18	in manufacturing and packaging.
79.02	I had a good background.
81.01	Retirement was, like for so many people,
84.11	simply not an option for me.
86.1	So I turned to consulting
86.1	for the next couple of years
89.06	without any passion whatsoever.
91.24	And then an idea began to take root,
95.13	born from my concern for our environment.
99.17	I wanted to build my own business,
102.01	designing and manufacturing
102.01	biodegradable packaging from waste --
106.13	paper, agricultural, even textile waste --
110.13	replacing the toxic,
110.13	disposable plastic packaging
114.11	to which we've all become addicted.
116.22	This is called clean technology,
118.22	and it felt really meaningful to me.
121.05	A venture that could help to reduce
121.05	the billions of pounds
125.17	of single-use plastic packaging
125.17	dumped each year
129.08	and polluting our land,
129.08	our rivers and our oceans,
132.16	and left for future
132.16	generations to resolve --
135.21	our grandchildren,
137.04	my grandchildren.
139.02	And so now at the age of 66,
142.17	with 40 years of experience,
144.22	I became an entrepreneur
144.22	for the very first time.
147.14	(Cheers)
148.16	(Applause)
151.06	Thank you.
154.1	But there's more.
155.15	(Laughter)
159.2	Lots of issues to deal with:
162.08	manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,
166.12	patents, partnerships, funding --
170.1	these are all typical
170.1	issues for a start-up,
172.23	but hardly typical for me.
175.03	And a word about funding.
177.06	I live and work in San Francisco.
179.22	And if you're looking for funding,
181.15	you are typically going to compete
181.15	with some very young people
185.08	from the high-tech industry,
187.04	and it can be very discouraging
187.04	and intimidating.
191.09	I have shoes older
191.09	than most of these people.
193.21	(Laughter)
199.15	I do.
200.2	(Laughter)
201.23	But five years later,
203.18	I'm thrilled and proud to share with you
206.22	that our revenues have doubled every year,
209.17	we have no debt,
211.02	we have several marquee clients,
213.26	our patent was issued,
215.07	I have a wonderful partner
216.2	who's been with me
216.2	right from the beginning,
218.24	and we've won more than 20 awards
218.24	for the work that we've done.
221.23	But best of all,
223.01	we've made a small dent --
224.29	a very small dent --
226.05	in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.
230.16	(Applause)
235.15	And I am doing the most rewarding
235.15	and meaningful work of my life right now.
242.06	I can tell you there's lots of resources
242.06	available to entrepreneurs of all ages,
247.07	but what I really yearned for
247.07	five years ago
250.14	was to find other first-time entrepreneurs
253.22	who were my age.
254.28	I wanted to connect with them.
257.23	I had no role models, absolutely none.
260.15	That 20-something app developer
260.15	from Silicon Valley
263.29	was not my role model.
265.11	(Laughter)
266.12	I'm sure he was very clever --
267.26	(Laughter)
269.09	I want to do something about that,
270.29	and I want all of us
270.29	to do something about that.
273.07	I want us to start talking more
274.24	about people who don't become
274.24	entrepreneurs until they are seniors.
279.1	Talking about these bold
279.1	men and women who are checking in
282.03	when their peers, in essence,
282.03	are checking out.
285.15	And then connecting all these people
285.15	across industries, across regions,
289.11	across countries --
291.01	building a community.
292.17	You know, the Small Business
292.17	Administration tells us
295.02	that 64 percent of new jobs
295.02	created in the private sector in the USA
300.09	are thanks to small businesses like mine.
303.18	And who's to say
303.18	that we'll stay forever small?
306.17	We have an interesting culture
308.04	that really expects
308.04	when you reach a certain age,
310.14	you're going to be golfing,
310.14	or playing checkers,
312.23	or babysitting the grandkids
312.23	all of the time.
315.26	And I adore my grandchildren --
318.23	(Laughter)
320.16	and I'm also passionate
322.19	about doing something meaningful
322.19	in the global marketplace.
327.09	And I'm going to have lots of company.
329.04	The Census Bureau says that by 2050,
331.17	there will be 84 million seniors
331.17	in this country.
335.18	That's an amazing number.
337.27	That's almost twice as many
337.27	as we have today.
340.14	Can you imagine how many
340.14	first-time entrepreneurs there will be
343.15	among 84 million people?
346.03	And they'll all have
346.03	four decades of experience.
348.22	(Laughter)
350.14	"So when I say, ""Let's start talking more"
350.14	"about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"""
355.27	I mean, let's talk about their ventures,
359.04	just as we do the ventures
359.04	of their much younger counterparts.
363.15	The older entrepreneurs in this country
363.15	have a 70 percent success rate
369.15	starting new ventures.
373.12	We're like the Golden State Warriors
373.12	of entrepreneurs --
376.16	(Laughter)
377.17	(Applause)
380.04	And that number plummets to 28 percent
380.04	for younger entrepreneurs.
385	This is according to a UK-based
385	group called CMI.
389	Aren't the accomplishments
389	of a 70-year-old entrepreneur
391.29	every bit as meaningful,
393.15	every bit as newsworthy,
394.27	as the accomplishments
394.27	of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?
398.01	Of course they are.
399.14	That's why I'd like to make the phrase
399.14	"""70 over 70"" just as --"
404.07	(Laughter)
405.09	just as commonplace
405.09	"as the phrase ""30 under 30."""
409.04	(Applause)
410.06	Thank you.
411.11	(Cheers)
412.29	(Applause)
