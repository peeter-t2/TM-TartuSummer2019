16.093	I'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
19.97	I do experiments to test how different chemicals
22.277	in the brain influence the choices we make.
25.877	I'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:
32.625	a cheese sandwich.
34.863	That's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich
38.523	is the solution to all your tough decisions.
42.145	How do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.
47.202	A few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested
49.502	in how a brain chemical called serotonin
51.795	would influence people's decisions in social situations.
55.065	Specifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect
58.16	the way people react when they're treated unfairly.
61.975	So we did an experiment.
63.513	We manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them
66.659	this really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink
71.282	that works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin
74.914	in the brain.
76.092	This is the amino acid tryptophan.
79.069	So what we found was, when tryptophan was low,
81.43	people were more likely to take revenge
83.882	when they're treated unfairly.
87.43	That's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines
91.253	that came out afterwards.
93.982	"(""A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making"")"
96.477	"(""What a friend we have in cheeses"")"
98.572	"(""Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control"") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?"
101.772	"(""Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy"") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?"
107.167	And I thought the same thing myself when these came out,
109.3	because our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
113.545	We gave people this horrible-tasting drink
115.874	that affected their tryptophan levels.
119.076	But it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found
122.757	in cheese and chocolate.
125.558	And of course when science says cheese and chocolate
127.868	help you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.
131.949	So there you have it:
133.916	the evolution of a headline.
137.423	When this happened, a part of me thought, well,
139.765	what's the big deal?
141.769	So the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,
145.648	it's just a news story.
147.724	And I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.
151.077	But the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,
154.974	and it affects not just the stories you read in the news
158.101	but also the products you see on the shelves.
160.88	When the headlines rolled, what happened was,
163.547	the marketers came calling.
166.373	Would I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement
169.592	of a mood-boosting bottled water?
172.853	Or would I go on television to demonstrate,
174.997	in front of a live audience,
176.022	that comfort foods really do make you feel better?
179.621	I think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,
183.582	I would have been going beyond the science,
185.956	and good scientists are careful not to do this.
189.213	But nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
193.581	Here's one example: Neuro drinks,
196.141	a line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,
199.382	which according to its label helps reduce stress,
202.283	enhances mood, provides focused concentration,
205.709	and promotes a positive outlook.
208.397	I have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)
213.022	I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
216.898	So when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was
220.328	curious about some of the research backing these claims.
223.877	So I went to the company's website looking to find
226.803	some controlled trials of their products.
230.229	But I didn't find any.
231.906	Trial or no trial, these claims are front and center
235.644	on their label right next to a picture of a brain.
239.606	And it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
245.309	A couple of researchers asked a few hundred people
247.771	to read a scientific article.
250.462	For half the people, the article included a brain image,
253.789	and for the other half, it was the same article
255.652	but it didn't have a brain image.
258.356	At the end — you see where this is going —
259.988	people were asked whether they agreed
262.098	with the conclusions of the article.
265.42	So this is how much people agree with the conclusions
267.693	with no image.
269.606	And this is how much they agree with the same article
273.253	that did include a brain image.
276.02	So the take-home message here is,
277.969	do you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
282.876	Now let me pause here and take a moment to say that
284.989	neuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,
288.687	and we're constantly discovering amazing things
291.14	about the brain.
292.413	Like, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT
295.557	figured out how to break habits in rats
298.357	just by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
302.35	Really cool stuff.
303.94	But the promise of neuroscience has led to some really
307.233	high expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
312.469	So what I'm going to do is show you how to spot
315.508	a couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,
319.054	for what's variously been called neuro-bunk,
321.85	neuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.
327.542	So the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans
331.88	to read people's thoughts and emotions.
335.792	Here's a study published by a team of researchers
338.839	as an op-ed in The New York Times.
341.672	"The headline? ""You Love Your iPhone. Literally."""
345.917	It quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
350.367	So how'd they figure this out?
352.536	They put 16 people inside a brain scanner
355.564	and showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
358.846	The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain
362.308	called the insula, a region they say
364.96	is linked to feelings of love and compassion.
368.744	So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,
372.404	this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
376.691	Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,
378.835	and that's that the insula does a lot.
382.351	Sure, it is involved in positive emotions
384.656	like love and compassion,
386.998	but it's also involved in tons of other processes,
389.671	like memory, language, attention,
392.744	even anger, disgust and pain.
396.78	So based on the same logic, I could equally conclude
401.243	you hate your iPhone.
403.696	The point here is, when you see activation in the insula,
406.54	you can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation
409.566	from off this list, and it's a really long list.
414.232	My colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack
416.566	have shown that the insula pops up in almost a third
419.688	of all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
424.424	So chances are really, really good
425.938	that your insula is going off right now,
429.064	but I won't kid myself
430.686	to think this means you love me.
434.363	So speaking of love and the brain,
437.27	there's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,
441.135	who claims that scientists have found the glue
444.62	that holds society together,
447.267	the source of love and prosperity.
451.043	This time it's not a cheese sandwich.
453.232	No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
457.089	You've probably heard of it.
458.956	So, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing
461.848	that when you boost people's oxytocin,
464.793	this increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
468.966	"So he's calling oxytocin ""the moral molecule."""
473.046	Now these studies are scientifically valid,
475.888	and they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
480.024	Other studies have shown that boosting oxytocin
482.737	increases envy. It increases gloating.
487.48	Oxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
490.796	at the expense of other groups.
493.888	And in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.
498.14	So based on these studies, I could say oxytocin
501.96	is an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.
506.711	(Laughter)
510.071	So we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.
514.181	We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
516.959	What about the clinic?
519.63	SPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology
523.045	that uses a radioactive tracer
525.114	to track blood flow in the brain.
528.154	For the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,
531.238	there are clinics in the U.S. that will give you
535.356	one of these SPECT scans and use the image
538.809	to help diagnose your problems.
541.446	These scans, the clinics say, can help
543.975	prevent Alzheimer's disease,
546.877	solve weight and addiction issues,
549.341	overcome marital conflicts,
552.013	and treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses
555.163	ranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
558.742	This sounds great. A lot of people agree.
561.312	Some of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions
563.478	of dollars a year in business.
566.782	There's just one problem.
568.866	The broad consensus in neuroscience
571.543	is that we can't yet diagnose mental illness
574.728	from a single brain scan.
577.511	But these clinics have treated
579.742	tens of thousands of patients to date,
582.182	many of them children,
583.944	and SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,
587.422	so exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.
593.419	I am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,
596.533	about the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness
600.814	and even maybe to make us better and smarter.
605.538	And if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate
608.238	help us make better decisions, count me in.
612.542	But we're not there yet.
615.118	"We haven't found a ""buy"" button inside the brain,"
618.853	we can't tell whether someone is lying or in love
622.551	just by looking at their brain scans,
625.934	and we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
630.198	Maybe someday we will, but until then,
632.402	we have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims
635.245	detract resources and attention away from the real science
638.631	that's playing a much longer game.
642.39	So here's where you come in.
644.828	If someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,
647.999	don't just take them at their word.
650.878	Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.
654.124	Ask for the part of the story that's not being told.
658.022	The answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
663.11	But that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
667.605	Thank you. (Applause)
