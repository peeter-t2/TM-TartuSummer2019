12.92	Twelve years ago, I picked up
12.92	a camera for the first time
17.08	to film the olive harvest
17.08	in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.
21.88	I thought I was there
21.88	to make a single documentary
24.32	and would then move on
24.32	to some other part of the world.
27.2	But something kept bringing me back.
30.32	Now, usually, when international audiences
30.32	hear about that part of the world,
34.32	they often just want
34.32	that conflict to go away.
37.88	The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad,
37.88	and we wish it could just disappear.
42.28	We feel much the same way
42.28	about other conflicts around the world.
46.36	But every time we turn
46.36	our attention to the news,
49.32	it seems like one more country
49.32	has gone up in flames.
53.8	So I've been wondering
55.04	whether we should not start
55.04	looking at conflict in a different way --
59.2	whether instead of simply
59.2	wishing to end conflict,
63.16	we focus instead on how to wage conflict.
67.2	This has been a big question for me,
69.28	one I've pursued together with my team
69.28	at the nonprofit Just Vision.
74.32	After witnessing several different kinds
74.32	of struggles in the Middle East,
78.44	I started noticing some patterns
78.44	on the more successful ones.
82.68	I wondered whether these variables
82.68	held across cases, and if they did,
86.84	what lessons we could glean
86.84	for waging constructive conflict,
91.76	in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.
96.2	There is some science about this.
98.76	In a study of 323
98.76	major political conflicts
102.96	from 1900 to 2006,
105.96	Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth
105.96	found that nonviolent campaigns
111.28	were almost 100 percent more likely
111.28	to lead to success than violent campaigns.
118.08	Nonviolent campaigns are also
118.08	less likely to cause physical harm
122.4	to those waging the campaign,
124.36	as well as their opponents.
126.52	And, critically, they typically lead
126.52	to more peaceful and democratic societies.
133.32	In other words, nonviolent resistance
133.32	is a more effective and constructive way
138.16	of waging conflict.
140.72	But if that's such an easy choice,
140.72	why don't more groups use it?
145.24	Political scientist Victor Asal
145.24	and colleagues
147.92	have looked at several factors
149.72	that shape a political group's
149.72	choice of tactics.
153.2	And it turns out
153.2	that the greatest predictor
157.04	of a movement's decision
157.04	to adopt nonviolence or violence
161.36	is not whether that group
161.36	is more left-wing or right-wing,
165.72	not whether the group is more or less
165.72	influenced by religious beliefs,
170.84	not whether it's up against
170.84	a democracy or a dictatorship,
173.92	and not even the levels of repression
173.92	that that group is facing.
178.64	The greatest predictor of a movement's
178.64	decision to adopt nonviolence
184.12	is its ideology regarding
184.12	the role of women in public life.
189.16	(Applause)
195	When a movement includes in its discourse
198.12	language around gender equality,
199.88	it increases dramatically
199.88	the chances it will adopt nonviolence,
203.24	and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.
206.28	The research squared up
206.28	with my own documentation
209.08	of political organizing
209.08	in Israel and Palestine.
212.44	I've noticed that movements which
212.44	welcome women into leadership positions,
216.88	such as the one I documented
216.88	in a village called Budrus,
220.2	were much more likely
220.2	to achieve their goals.
223.92	This village was under a real threat
223.92	of being wiped off the map
227.96	when Israel started building
227.96	the separation barrier.
231.56	The proposed route would require
233.44	the destruction of this community's
233.44	olive groves, their cemeteries
237.96	and would ultimately
237.96	enclose the village from all sides.
241.88	Through inspired local leadership,
243.56	they launched a nonviolent resistance
243.56	campaign to stop that from happening.
248.4	The odds were massively
248.4	stacked against them.
252.92	But they had a secret weapon:
257.88	a 15-year-old girl
259.68	who courageously jumped
259.68	in front of a bulldozer
262.44	which was about to uproot
262.44	an olive tree, stopping it.
266.64	In that moment, the community
266.64	of Budrus realized what was possible
270.24	if they welcomed and encouraged women
270.24	to participate in public life.
275.56	And so it was that the women of Budrus
275.56	went to the front lines day after day,
279.44	using their creativity and acumen
279.44	to overcome multiple obstacles they faced
283.92	in a 10-month unarmed struggle.
287	And as you can probably
287	tell at this point,
289.024	they win at the end.
291.76	The separation barrier
291.76	was changed completely
294.72	to the internationally
294.72	recognized green line,
297.48	and the women of Budrus
297.48	came to be known across the West Bank
301.24	for their indomitable energy.
304.56	(Applause)
307.32	Thank you.
312.56	I want to pause for a second,
312.56	which you helped me do,
315.28	because I do want to tackle
315.28	two very serious misunderstandings
319.24	that could happen at this point.
321.84	The first one is that I don't believe
325.28	women are inherently or essentially
325.28	more peaceful than men.
331.8	But I do believe that in today's world,
335.2	women experience power differently.
339.28	Having had to navigate
339.28	being in the less powerful position
342.48	in multiple aspects of their lives,
345.24	women are often more adept
347.6	at how to surreptitiously
347.6	pressure for change
350.88	against large, powerful actors.
353.64	"The term ""manipulative,"" often charged"
353.64	against women in a derogatory way,
357.84	reflects a reality in which women
357.84	have often had to find ways
361.84	other than direct confrontation
361.84	to achieve their goals.
366.44	And finding alternatives
366.44	to direct confrontation
370	is at the core of nonviolent resistance.
374.36	Now to the second
374.36	potential misunderstanding.
376.88	I've been talking a lot about
376.88	my experiences in the Middle East,
379.92	and some of you might be thinking now
381.76	that the solution then is for us
381.76	to educate Muslim and Arab societies
385.56	to be more inclusive of their women.
387.96	If we were to do that,
387.96	they would be more successful.
393.2	They do not need this kind of help.
396.88	Women have been part
396.88	of the most influential movements
400.32	coming out of the Middle East,
403.16	but they tend to be invisible
403.16	to the international community.
408.08	Our cameras are largely focused on the men
410.84	who often end up involved
410.84	in the more confrontational scenes
413.92	that we find so irresistible
413.92	in our news cycle.
418.16	And we end up with a narrative
418.16	that not only erases women
421.96	from the struggles in the region
423.92	but often misrepresents
423.92	the struggles themselves.
430.12	In the late 1980s,
430.12	an uprising started in Gaza,
435.28	and quickly spread to the West Bank
435.28	and East Jerusalem.
439.56	It came to be known as the First Intifada,
443.64	and people who have
443.64	any visual memory of it
446	generally conjure up something like this:
449.68	Palestinian men
449.68	throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.
454.8	The news coverage at the time
456.32	made it seem like stones,
456.32	Molotov cocktails and burning tires
461.08	were the only activities
461.08	taking place in the Intifada.
465.96	This period, though, was also marked
465.96	by widespread nonviolent organizing
472.36	in the forms of strikes, sit-ins
472.36	and the creation of parallel institutions.
477.88	During the First Intifada,
479.28	whole sectors of the Palestinian
479.28	civilian population mobilized,
482.64	cutting across generations,
482.64	factions and class lines.
487.2	They did this through networks
487.2	of popular committees,
489.92	and their use of direct action
489.92	and communal self-help projects
493.44	challenged Israel's very ability
495.88	to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.
499.6	According to the Israeli Army itself,
	during the First Intifada were unarmed.
508.84	And here's another thing that is not
508.84	part of our narrative about that time.
513.32	For 18 months in the Intifada,
515.8	women were the ones
515.8	calling the shots behind the scenes:
519.64	Palestinian women from all walks of life
522.16	in charge of mobilizing
522.16	hundreds of thousands of people
525.6	in a concerted effort to withdraw
525.6	consent from the occupation.
530.76	Naela Ayesh, who strived to build
530.76	a self-sufficient Palestinian economy
536.08	by encouraging women in Gaza
536.08	to grow vegetables in their backyards,
541.32	an activity deemed illegal
541.32	by the Israeli authorities at that time;
546.32	Rabeha Diab, who took over
546.32	decision-making authority
549.8	for the entire uprising
551.24	when the men who had been running it
553.04	were deported;
555.44	Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets
555.44	containing the uprising's directives
560.96	in order to spread them
560.96	across the territories
563.76	without getting caught;
566.72	and Zahira Kamal,
568.4	who ensured the longevity of the uprising
571.72	by leading an organization
573.28	that went from 25 women
573.28	to 3,000 in a single year.
580.84	Despite their extraordinary achievements,
583.2	none of these women have made it
583.2	into our narrative of the First Intifada.
589.88	We do this in other parts
589.88	of the globe, too.
592.8	In our history books, for instance,
592.8	and in our collective consciousness,
597.04	men are the public faces and spokespersons
600.12	for the 1960s struggle
600.12	for racial justice in the United States.
605.44	But women were also
605.44	a critical driving force,
608.88	mobilizing, organizing,
608.88	taking to the streets.
612.8	How many of us think of Septima Clark
615.36	when we think of the United States
615.36	Civil Rights era?
620.08	Remarkably few.
622.8	But she played a crucial role
622.8	in every phase of the struggle,
627.24	particularly by emphasizing
627.24	literacy and education.
630.92	She's been omitted, ignored,
633.44	like so many other women
633.44	who played critical roles
637.16	in the United States
637.16	Civil Rights Movement.
641.92	This is not about getting credit.
645.36	It's more profound than that.
648.4	The stories we tell matter deeply
648.4	to how we see ourselves,
652.56	and to how we believe movements are run
655.28	and how movements are won.
657.96	The stories we tell about a movement
657.96	like the First Intifada
660.84	or the United States Civil Rights era
662.8	matter deeply
662.8	and have a critical influence
666.92	in the choices Palestinians,
669.6	Americans
670.92	and people around the world will make
673.04	next time they encounter an injustice
675.36	and develop the courage to confront it.
678.56	If we do not lift up the women who played
678.56	critical roles in these struggles,
682.84	we fail to offer up role models
682.84	to future generations.
688.2	Without role models, it becomes harder
691.28	for women to take up their rightful space
694.32	in public life.
697.32	And as we saw earlier,
699.48	one of the most critical variables
701.32	in determining whether
701.32	a movement will be successful or not
705.52	is a movement's ideology
705.52	regarding the role of women
709.56	in public life.
712.32	This is a question of whether we're moving
714.4	towards more democratic
714.4	and peaceful societies.
719.24	In a world where so much
719.24	change is happening,
721.76	and where change is bound to continue
721.76	at an increasingly faster pace,
726.88	it is not a question
726.88	of whether we will face conflict,
731.68	but rather a question
733.24	of which stories will shape
736.64	how we choose to wage conflict.
740.56	Thank you.
742.04	(Applause)
