13.112	So, my journey began
13.112	in the Bronx, New York,
18.098	in a one-bedroom apartment,
19.89	with my two sisters and immigrant mother.
23.712	I loved our neighborhood.
27.382	It was lively.
28.914	There was all this merengue blasting,
31.383	neighbors socializing on building stoops
33.796	and animated conversations
33.796	over domino playing.
38.327	It was home,
40.852	and it was sweet.
43.368	But it wasn't simple.
45.645	In fact, everyone at school
45.645	knew the block where we lived,
49.283	because it was where people came
49.283	to buy weed and other drugs.
53.95	And with drug-dealing comes conflict,
56.544	so we often went to sleep
56.544	to the sound of gunshots.
61.839	I spent much of my childhood worried,
65.121	worried about our safety.
68.803	And so did our mother.
71.277	She worried that the violence we witnessed
71.277	would overtake our lives;
76.338	that our poverty meant
78.087	that the neighbors with whom
78.087	we lived and shared space
80.786	would harm us.
82.851	Our entire life was in the Bronx,
86.566	but my mother's anxiety
86.566	spurred her into action,
89.586	and soon we were driving
89.586	so fast to Connecticut --
94.38	(Laughter)
95.476	to boarding school campuses,
95.476	with full scholarships in tow.
99.857	Man, don't underestimate
99.857	the power of a mother
105.615	determined to keep her children safe.
109.01	(Cheers)
110.316	(Applause)
115.553	At boarding school,
118.658	for the first time,
121.867	I was able to sleep without worry.
125.391	I could leave my dorm room unlocked,
127.968	walk barefoot in the grass,
130.291	and look up to see
130.291	a night sky full of stars.
136.061	Happy novelties.
139.172	But there were other novelties as well.
142.298	Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong.
146.469	I learned that I didn't speak
146.469	the right way,
149.382	and to demonstrate
149.382	the proper ways of speaking,
153.226	my teachers gave me
153.226	frequent lessons, in public,
157.759	on the appropriate way
157.759	to enunciate certain words.
163.068	A teacher once instructed me
163.068	in the hallway:
167.04	"""Aaaaaas-king."""
171.535	She said this loudly.
174.024	"""Dena, it's not 'axing,'"
174.024	like you're running around with an axe.
179.809	"That's silly."""
182.082	Now at this point, you can imagine
182.082	the snickers of my classmates,
188.258	but she continued:
191.246	"""Think about breaking the word"
191.246	into 'ass' and 'king,'
196.667	and then put the two together
196.667	to say it correctly --
200.72	"'Asking.'"""
203.918	There were some other moments
203.918	that reminded me that I didn't belong.
208.186	Once, I walked into
208.186	a classmate's dorm room,
212.028	and I watched her watch
212.028	her valuables around me.
216.349	Like, why would she do that?
216.349	I thought to myself.
220.385	And then there was the time
222.848	when another classmate
222.848	walked into my dorm room,
226.311	"and yelled, ""Ew!"" as I was applying"
226.311	hair grease to my scalp.
233.072	There is emotional damage done
233.072	when young people can't be themselves,
238.504	when they are forced to edit who they are
238.504	in order to be acceptable.
244.627	It's a kind of violence.
248.94	Ultimately, I'm a quintessential
248.94	success story.
253.992	I attended boarding school
253.992	and college in New England,
257.223	studied abroad in Chile
259.327	and returned to the Bronx
259.327	to be a middle school teacher.
263.027	I received a Truman Scholarship,
265.448	a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.
268.69	And I could list more.
270.598	(Laughter)
272.116	But I won't.
273.336	(Laughter)
275.908	I earned my doctorate
275.908	at Columbia University.
279.792	(Cheers)
280.907	(Applause)
282.737	And then I landed a job at Yale.
285.103	(Applause)
287.363	I am proud of everything
287.363	that I've been able to accomplish
292.036	on my journey thus far.
296.884	I have eternal imposter syndrome.
301.15	Either I've been invited
301.15	because I'm a token,
304.083	which really isn't about me,
306.314	but rather, about a box
306.314	someone needed to check off.
310.388	Or, I am exceptional,
313.673	which means I've had to leave
313.673	the people I love behind.
319.528	It's the price that I and so many others
319.528	pay for learning while black.
327.595	(Applause)
334.689	I police myself all the time.
340.008	Are my pants too tight?
342.768	Should I wear my hair up or in a fro?
346.726	Should I speak up for myself,
349.195	or will the power of my words
349.195	"be reduced to: ""She's angry""?"
356.114	Why did I have to leave the Bronx
358.748	to gain access to a better education?
363.433	And why, in the process
363.433	of getting that better education,
367.918	did I have to endure the trauma
367.918	of erasing what made me, me --
375.449	a black girl from the Bronx,
375.449	raised by an Antiguan mother?
381.861	So when I think about our current
381.861	education reform initiatives,
387.39	I can't help asking:
390.179	What are our students of color
390.179	learning about themselves?
395.83	Three -- three decades of research reveal
399.141	that students of color
399.141	are suspended and expelled
402.431	at a rate three times greater
402.431	than white students,
406.17	and are punished in harsher ways
406.17	for the same infractions.
413.138	They also learn this through the absence
413.138	of their lives and narratives
416.659	in the curricula.
419.432	The Cooperative Children's Book Center
419.432	did a review of nearly 4,000 books
424.848	and found that only three percent
424.848	were about African-Americans.
430.686	And they further learn this
432.073	through the lack of teachers
432.073	that look like them.
437.55	An analysis of data
439.013	from the National Center
439.013	for Education Statistics
442.751	found that 45 percent of our nation's
442.751	pre-K to high school students
447.931	were people of color,
450.3	while only 17 percent of our teachers are.
456.881	Our youth of color pay a profound price
459.742	when their schooling
459.742	sends them the message
461.884	that they must be controlled,
464.479	that they must leave
464.479	their identities at home
466.887	in order to be successful.
471.027	Every child deserves an education
474.338	that guarantees the safety to learn
477.883	in the comfort of one's own skin.
483.484	(Applause)
491.551	It is possible to create emotionally
491.551	and physically safe classrooms
496.818	where students also thrive academically.
500.511	I know, because I did it in my classroom
503.925	when I returned to teach in the Bronx.
507.681	So what did that look like?
511.04	I centered my instruction
513.098	on the lives, histories
513.098	and identities of my students.
518.621	And I did all of this
518.621	because I wanted my students to know
521.637	that everyone around them
521.637	was supporting them
525.348	to be their best self.
529.054	So while I could not control
529.054	the instability of their homes,
534.321	the uncertainty of their next meal,
537.472	or the loud neighbors
537.472	that kept them from sleep,
540.641	I provided them with a loving classroom
544.031	that made them feel proud of who they are,
547.313	that made them know that they mattered.
551.62	You know,
554.522	every time I hear
554.522	"or say the word ""asking,"""
562.977	I am in high school again.
566.135	"I am thinking about ""ass"" and ""king"""
572.117	and putting the two together
572.117	so that I speak in a way
576.206	where someone in power
576.206	will want to listen.
582.115	There is a better way,
584.365	one that doesn't force kids of color
584.365	into a double bind;
588.799	a way for them to preserve their ties
591.185	to their families, homes and communities;
594.944	a way that teaches them
594.944	to trust their instincts
600.555	and to have faith
600.555	in their own creative genius.
607.144	Thank you.
608.351	(Applause)
