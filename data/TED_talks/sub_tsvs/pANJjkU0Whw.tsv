27	Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,
30	only to find out that you're a performance artist.
35	(Laughter)
39	I'm also a software engineer,
42	and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.
44	And I think the main thing that I'm interested in
46	is trying to find a way of
48	making the computer into a personal mode of expression.
51	And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,
56	and in a way those are my bane:
58	I think there's a great homogenizing force
61	that software imposes on people and limits the way they think
67	about what's possible on the computer.
69	Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,
72	you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.
75	But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more
79	than what most people think, and my art has just been about
82	trying to find a personal way of using the computer,
84	and so I end up writing software to do that.
88	Chris has asked me to do a short performance,
90	and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --
93	to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment
95	to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.
791	Thank you.
793	(Applause)
804	We've got about a minute left.
806	I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.
808	I did a performance with two singers
811	who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.
814	And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;
817	we repeated it in England.
819	And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them
822	with a large screen.
823	We used a computer vision tracking system
825	in order to know where they were.
827	And since we know where their heads are,
828	and we have a wireless mic on them
830	that we're processing the sound from,
831	we're able to create visualizations
833	which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.
836	This will take about 30 seconds or so.
841	He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.
883	Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.
886	Thanks very much. There's always lots more.
888	I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,
890	you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,
892	and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.
895	And with that, I think I should give up the stage,
897	so, thank you so much.
