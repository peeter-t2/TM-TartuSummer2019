15.26	My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan
18.26	about two years ago.
20.26	I was in the desert, under the starry skies
23.26	with the Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali.
25.26	And we were in conversation
27.26	about how nothing had changed
29.26	"since the time of the ancient Indian epic ""The Mahabharata."""
32.26	So back in the day, when us Indians wanted to travel
35.26	we'd jump into a chariot and we'd zoom across the sky.
38.26	Now we do the same with airplanes.
41.26	Back then,
43.26	when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,
45.26	when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,
47.26	he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
50.26	Now we do the same
52.26	with drills and machines.
54.26	The conclusion that we came to
56.26	was that magic had been replaced
58.26	by machinery.
60.26	And this made me really sad.
63.26	I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
66.26	I was terrified by this idea
68.26	that I would lose the ability
70.26	to enjoy and appreciate the sunset
72.26	without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
75.26	And it felt like technology
77.26	should enable magic, not kill it.
79.26	When I was a little girl,
81.26	my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.
84.26	And this piece of 50-year-old technology
87.26	became the most magical thing to me.
89.26	It became a gilded gateway
91.26	into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks
94.26	and images in my imagination.
97.26	So I felt like our cellphones
99.26	and our fancy watches and our cameras
101.26	had stopped us from dreaming.
103.26	They stopped us from being inspired.
105.26	And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,
108.26	to see how I could use it to enable magic
110.26	as opposed to kill it.
112.26	I've been illustrating books since I was 16.
114.26	And so when I saw the iPad,
116.26	I saw it as a storytelling device
118.26	that could connect readers all over the world.
121.26	It can know how we're holding it.
124.26	It can know where we are.
126.26	It brings together image and text
128.26	and animation and sound and touch.
131.26	Storytelling is becoming
133.26	more and more multi-sensorial.
135.26	But what are we doing with it?
137.26	So I'm actually just going to go in and launch Khoya,
140.26	an interactive app for the iPad.
144.26	"So it says, ""Place your fingers"
146.26	"upon each light."""
148.26	And so --
151.26	(Music)
175.26	"It says, ""This box belongs to ... """
179.26	And so I type in my name.
181.26	And actually I become a character in the book.
183.26	At various points, a little letter drops down to me --
186.26	and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --
189.26	which is actually addressed to me.
191.26	The child in me is really excited
193.26	by these kinds of possibilities.
195.26	Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
198.26	And I don't mean wizards and dragons,
201.26	I mean the kind of childhood magic,
203.26	those ideas that we all harbored as children.
206.26	This idea of fireflies in a jar, for some reason,
208.26	was always really exciting to me.
210.26	And so over here you need to tilt your iPad,
213.26	take the fireflies out.
215.26	And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book.
221.26	Another idea that really fascinated me as a child
224.26	was that an entire galaxy could be contained
226.26	within a single marble.
228.26	And so over here,
230.26	each book and each world
232.26	becomes a little marble
234.26	that I drag in
236.26	to this magical device within the device.
239.26	And it opens up a map.
244.26	All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,
247.26	but these maps have been static.
249.26	This is a map that grows and glows
252.26	and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
254.26	It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
257.26	So I'm just going to enter in.
261.26	Another thing that's actually really important to me
264.26	is creating content that is Indian
267.26	and yet very contemporary.
269.26	Over here, these are the Apsaras.
271.26	So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,
274.26	but how many people outside of India
277.26	know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?
280.26	These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years
284.26	in an old and musty book.
286.26	And so we're bringing them back
288.26	in a contemporary story for children.
299.26	And a story that actually deals with new issues
302.26	like the environmental crisis.
304.26	(Music)
325.26	Speaking of the environmental crisis,
329.26	I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years
332.26	is that children have been locked inside their rooms,
334.26	glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.
336.26	But now with mobile technology,
338.26	we can actually take our children outside into the natural world
341.26	with their technology.
343.26	One of the interactions in the book
345.26	is that you're sent off on this quest
347.26	where you need to go outside,
349.26	take out your camera on the iPad
351.26	and collect pictures of different natural objects.
353.26	When I was a child, I had multiple collections
355.26	of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
358.26	And somehow kids don't do that anymore.
360.26	So in bringing back this childhood ritual,
362.26	you need to go out
364.26	and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower
366.26	and then tag it.
368.26	In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark
370.26	and then tag that.
372.26	And what happens
374.26	is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs
376.26	that you can then put up online.
378.26	A child in London puts up a picture of a fox
380.26	"and says, ""Oh, I saw a fox today."""
382.26	"A child in India says, ""I saw a monkey today."""
384.26	And it creates this kind of social network
386.26	around a collection of digital photographs
388.26	that you've actually taken.
390.26	In the possibilities of linking together
393.26	magic, the earth and technology,
396.26	there are multiple possibilities.
398.26	In the next book, we plan on having an interaction
400.26	where you take your iPad out with the video on
402.26	and through augmented reality,
404.26	you see this layer of animated pixies
406.26	appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.
410.26	At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.
413.26	And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away
416.26	and read the rest of the book.
418.26	We're moving, we're all moving here,
421.26	to a world where the forces of nature
423.26	come closer together to technology,
425.26	and magic and technology can come closer together.
428.26	We're harnessing energy from the sun.
431.26	We're bringing our children and ourselves
434.26	closer to the natural world
436.26	and that magic and joy
438.26	and childhood love that we had
440.26	through the simple medium of a story.
442.26	Thank you.
444.26	(Applause)
