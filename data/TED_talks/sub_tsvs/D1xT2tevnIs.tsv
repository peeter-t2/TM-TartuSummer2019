13.19	I'm going to start
13.19	by asking you a question:
15.697	Is anyone familiar
15.697	with the blue algae problem?
19.776	Okay, so most of you are.
21.825	I think we can all agree
21.825	it's a serious issue.
24.871	Nobody wants to drink
24.871	blue algae-contaminated water,
28.763	or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.
33.328	Right?
34.703	I hope you won't be disappointed,
36.779	but today,
36.779	I won't be talking about blue algae.
39.985	Instead,
39.985	I'll be talking about the main cause
43.81	at the root of this issue,
46.775	which I will be referring to as
46.775	the phosphorus crisis.
50.17	Why have I chosen to talk to you
50.17	about the phosphorus crisis today?
54.078	For the simple reason
54.078	that nobody else is talking about it.
57.337	And by the end of my presentation,
57.337	I hope that the general public
61.604	will be more aware of this crisis
61.604	and this issue.
66.17	Now, the problem is that if I ask,
69.534	why do we find ourselves
69.534	in this situation with blue algae?
72.588	The answer is
72.588	that it comes from how we farm.
76.262	We use fertilizers in our farming,
76.262	chemical fertilizers.
80.696	Why do we use chemical fertilizers
80.696	in agriculture?
83.103	Basically, to help plants grow
83.103	and to produce a better yield.
88.343	The issue is that this is set to engender
90.787	an environmental problem
90.787	that is without precedent.
95.471	Before going further, let me give you
95.471	a crash course in plant biology.
99.037	So, what does a plant need
99.037	in order to grow?
101.502	A plant, quite simply,
101.502	needs light, it needs CO2,
106.052	but even more importantly,
106.052	it needs nutrients,
109.667	which it draws from the soil.
113.282	Several of these nutrients
113.282	are essential chemical elements:
116.897	phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.
119.943	So, the plant’s roots will extract
119.943	these resources.
124.672	Today I'll be focusing on a major problem
124.672	that is linked to phosphorus.
128.536	Why phosphorus in particular?
130.223	Because it is
130.223	the most problematic chemical element.
133.572	By the end of my presentation,
133.572	you will have seen
136.693	what these problems are,
136.693	and where we are today.
140.839	Phosphorus is a chemical element
143.772	that is essential to life.
143.772	This is a very important point.
147.165	I’d like everyone to understand precisely
147.165	what the phosphorus issue is.
150.816	Phosphorus is a key component
150.816	in several molecules,
154.988	in many of our molecules of life.
157.641	Experts in the field will know
159.634	that cellular communication
159.634	is phosphorus-based --
162.597	phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.
165.221	Cell membranes are phosphorus-based:
165.221	These are called phospholipids.
170.822	The energy in all living things,
170.822	ATP, is phosphorus-based.
175.572	And more importantly still,
175.572	phosphorus is a key component of DNA,
182.455	something everyone is familiar with,
182.455	and which is shown in this image.
187.055	DNA is our genetic heritage.
190.339	It is extremely important, and once again,
190.339	phosphorus is a key player.
195.36	Now, where do we find this phosphorus?
199.308	As humans, where do we find it?
202.869	As I explained earlier,
204.358	plants extract phosphorus
204.358	from the soil, through water.
209.147	So, we humans get it
209.147	from the things we eat:
212.722	plants, vegetables, fruits,
215.397	and also from eggs, meat and milk.
218.912	It’s true that some humans
218.912	eat better than others.
221.969	Some are happier than others.
224.605	And now, looking at this picture,
224.605	which speaks for itself,
229.076	we see modern agriculture,
230.892	which I also refer to
230.892	as intensive agriculture.
234.448	Intensive agriculture is based
234.448	on the use of chemical fertilizers.
238.904	Without them,
238.904	we would not manage to produce enough
241.932	to feed the world's population.
244.96	Speaking of humans, there are currently
244.96	7 billion of us on Earth.
248.738	In less than 40 years,
248.738	there will be 9 billion of us.
251.864	And the question is a simple one:
251.864	Do we have enough phosphorus
255.254	to feed our future generations?
259.134	So, in order to understand these issues,
259.134	where do we find our phosphorus?
263.216	Let me explain.
264.997	But first, let’s just suppose
267.844	that we are using
273.69	Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant.
273.69	Eighty-five percent is lost.
282.278	It goes into the soil,
282.278	ending its journey in the lakes,
285.947	resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus,
285.947	which leads to the blue algae problem.
289.673	So, you’ll see there’s a problem here,
289.673	something that is illogical.
293.411	A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used,
293.411	but only 15 percent goes to the plant.
297.85	You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.
300.274	Yes, it is. What is worse
300.274	is that it is very expensive.
304.401	Nobody wants to throw their money
304.401	out the window,
307.783	but unfortunately
307.783	that's what is happening here.
310.513	Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.
315.049	Modern agriculture
315.049	depends on phosphorus.
320.701	And because in order to get 15 percent of it
320.701	to the plant, all the rest is lost,
325.3	we have to add more and more.
327.221	Now, where will we get
327.221	this phosphorus from?
331.135	Basically, we get it out of mines.
334.989	This is the cover
334.989	of an extraordinary article
337.516	published in Nature in 2009,
339.273	which really launched the discussion
339.273	about the phosphorus crisis.
342.46	Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life,
342.46	which is becoming increasingly scarce,
347.423	yet nobody is talking about it.
349.246	And everyone agrees:
349.246	Politicians and scientists are in agreement
355.11	that we are headed
355.11	for a phosphorus crisis.
357.451	What you are seeing here
357.451	is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,
360.899	and to give you an idea
360.899	of the dimensions of this mine,
364	if you look in the top right-hand corner,
364	the little crane you can see,
367.554	that is a giant crane.
369.369	So that really puts it into perspective.
372.403	So, we get phosphorus from mines.
374.601	And if I make a comparison with oil,
377.809	there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it,
377.809	we talk about global warming,
381.18	yet we never mention
381.18	the phosphorus crisis.
383.204	To come back to the oil problem,
383.204	oil is something we can replace.
387.406	We can use biofuels, or solar power,
391.768	or hydropower,
391.768	but phosphorus is an essential element,
395.532	indispensable to life,
395.532	and we can’t replace it.
401.106	What is the current state
401.106	of the world's phosphorus reserves?
404.769	This graph gives you a rough idea
404.769	of where we are today.
408.88	The black line represents predictions
408.88	for phosphorus reserves.
413.531	In 2030, we’ll reach the peak.
416.155	By the end of this century,
416.155	it will all be gone.
419.661	The dotted line shows where we are today.
423.976	As you can see, they meet in 2030,
423.976	I’ll be retired by then.
428.658	But we are indeed heading
428.658	for a major crisis,
432.227	and I’d like people to become aware
432.227	of this problem.
436.089	Do we have a solution?
438.449	What are we to do?
438.449	We are faced with a paradox.
442.531	Less and less phosphorus
442.531	will be available.
445.118	By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,
448.484	and according to
448.484	the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
455.098	we will need to produce twice as much food
455.098	in 2050 than we do today.
459.841	So, we will have less phosphorus,
459.841	but we'll need to produce more food.
464.141	What should we do?
466.199	It truly is a paradoxical situation.
469.029	Do we have a solution,
469.029	or an alternative
471.777	which will allow us to optimize
471.777	phosphorus use?
474.745	Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.
480.365	The solution I'm offering today is one
480.365	that has existed for a very long time,
487.669	even before plants existed on Earth,
490.407	and it's a microscopic mushroom
490.407	that is very mysterious,
493.885	very simple,
493.885	and yet also extremely complex.
497.933	I've been fascinated by this little mushroom
497.933	for over 16 years now.
502.621	It has led me to further my research
506.466	and to use it as a model
506.466	for my laboratory research.
509.836	This mushroom exists in symbiosis
509.836	with the roots.
513.55	By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional
513.55	and mutually beneficial association
518.937	which is also called mycorrhiza.
524.085	This slide illustrates the elements
524.085	of a mycorrhiza.
527.142	You’re looking at the root of wheat,
529.407	one of the world’s most important plants.
533.501	Normally, a root will find phosphorus
533.501	all by itself.
536.34	It will go in search of phosphorus,
538.372	but only within the one millimeter
538.372	which surrounds it.
542.044	Beyond one millimeter,
542.044	the root is ineffective.
545.119	It cannot go further
545.119	in its search for phosphorus.
547.444	Now, imagine this tiny,
547.444	microscopic mushroom.
550.18	It grows much faster,
552.441	and is much better designed
552.441	to seek out phosphorus.
555.237	It can go beyond
555.237	the root’s one-millimeter scope
558.616	to seek out phosphorus.
560.703	I haven’t invented anything at all;
562.759	it's a biotechnology that has existed
562.759	for 450 million years.
566.257	And over time, this mushroom
566.257	has evolved and adapted to seek out
570.17	even the tiniest trace of phosphorus,
570.17	and to put it to use,
573.663	to make it available to the plant.
576.716	What you’re seeing here,
576.716	in the real world, is a carrot root,
581.289	and the mushroom
581.289	with its very fine filaments.
583.92	Looking closer,
583.92	we can see that this mushroom
586.327	is very gentle in its penetration.
588.414	It will proliferate
588.414	between the root's cells,
592.103	eventually penetrating a cell
595.596	and starting to form
595.596	a typical arbuscular structure,
600.6	which will considerably increase
600.6	the exchange interface
605.477	between the plant and the mushroom.
608.036	And it is through this structure
608.036	that mutual exchanges will occur.
611.481	It’s a win-win trade:
613.117	I give you phosphorus, and you feed me.
615.992	True symbiosis.
620.602	Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant
623.37	into the diagram I used earlier.
626.63	And instead of using a 100 percent dose,
626.63	I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent.
631.707	You’ll see that of this 25 percent,
631.707	most will benefit the plant,
636.681	more than 90 percent.
638.237	A very small amount of phosphorus
638.237	will remain in the soil.
641.817	That's completely natural.
645.577	What's more is that in certain cases,
645.577	we don't even need to add phosphorus.
649.448	If you recall the graphs
649.448	I showed you earlier,
655.081	and the plants are unable to access it.
658.326	Even though it is present in the soil,
658.326	it is in insoluble form.
662.134	The plant is only able to seek out
662.134	soluble forms.
665.144	The mushroom is capable
665.144	of dissolving this insoluble form
668.956	and making it available
668.956	for the plant to use.
672.397	To further support my argument,
672.397	here is a picture that speaks for itself.
675.948	These are trials
675.948	in a field of sorghum.
679.836	On the left side, you see the yield
679.836	produced using conventional agriculture,
684.348	with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.
687.09	On the other side,
687.09	the dose was reduced to 50 percent,
690.303	and just look at the yield.
691.836	With only a half-dose,
691.836	we achieved a better yield.
697.417	This is to show you
697.417	that this method works.
702.247	And in some cases, in Cuba,
702.247	Mexico and India,
706.816	the dose can be reduced to 25 percent,
706.816	and in several other cases,
710.103	there's no need to add
710.103	any phosphorus at all,
712.257	because the mushrooms are so well adapted
714.701	to finding phosphorus
714.701	and drawing it from the soil.
717.897	This is an example of soy production
717.897	in Canada.
723.735	Mycorrhiza was used in one field
723.735	but not in the other.
731.347	And here, where blue indicates a better yield,
731.347	and yellow a weaker yield.
740.763	The black rectangle is the plot
743.586	from which the mycorrhiza was added.
745.969	In other words, as I already said,
745.969	I have invented nothing.
749.337	Mycorrhiza has existed
749.337	for 450 million years,
752.087	and it has even helped
752.087	modern-day plant species to diversify.
756.346	So, this it isn't something
756.346	that is still undergoing lab tests.
760.905	Mycorrhiza exists, it works,
763.321	it's produced at an industrial scale
763.321	and commercialized worldwide.
767.76	The problem is
767.76	that people are not aware of it.
771.07	People like food producers and farmers
771.07	are still not aware of this problem.
775.066	We have a technology that works,
777.694	and one that, if used correctly,
777.694	will alleviate some of the pressure
784.791	we are putting
784.791	on the world's phosphorus reserves.
789.214	In conclusion,
789.214	I am a scientist and a dreamer.
794.368	I'm passionate about this topic.
796.127	So if you were to ask me
796.127	what my retirement dream is,
799.415	which will be at the moment we reach
799.415	that phosphorus peak,
802.241	it would be that we use one label,
802.241	"""Made with mycorrhiza,"""
806.197	and that my children and grandchildren
809.107	buy products bearing that label too.
812.115	Thank you for your attention.
813.815	(Applause)
