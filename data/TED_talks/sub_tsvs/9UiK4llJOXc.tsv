12	I want to talk to you about,
15.561	or share with you, a
15.561	breakthrough new approach
19.122	for managing items of
19.122	inventory inside of a warehouse.
22.464	We're talking about a pick,
22.464	pack and ship setting here.
25.022	So as a hint,
27.845	this solution involves
27.845	hundreds of mobile robots,
31.998	sometimes thousands
31.998	of mobile robots,
34.422	moving around a warehouse.
34.422	And I'll get to the solution.
37.02	But for a moment, just think
38.24	about the last time that
38.24	you ordered something online.
40.766	You were sitting
40.766	on your couch
42.83	and you decided that you
42.83	absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.
46.89	So — click! — you put it
46.89	into your shopping cart.
49.186	And then you decided
49.186	that green pair of pants
51.084	looks pretty good too — click!
52.982	And maybe a blue
52.982	pair of shoes — click!
54.882	So at this point you've
54.882	assembled your order.
56.932	You didn't stop to think 
56.932	for a moment that
58.7	that might not be a great outfit.
60.468	But you hit
60.468	"""submit order."""
62.238	And two days later, this package
62.238	shows up on your doorstep.
66.412	And you open the box and you're
66.412	like, wow, there's my goo.
69.366	Did you ever stop to think about
69.366	how those items of inventory
72.327	actually found their way inside
72.327	that box in the warehouse?
76.54	So I'm here to tell you 
76.54	it's that guy right there.
80.358	So deep in the
80.358	middle of that picture,
83.978	you see a classic
83.978	pick-pack worker
86.493	in a distribution or
86.493	order fulfillments setting.
89.718	Classically these pick workers will 
89.718	spend 60 or 70 percent of their day
93.6	wandering around
93.6	the warehouse.
95.512	They'll often walk
95.512	as much as 5 or 10 miles
98.223	in pursuit of
98.223	those items of inventory.
100.884	Not only is this an
100.884	unproductive way to fill orders,
105.305	it also turns out to be an
105.305	unfulfilling way to fill orders.
109.362	So let me tell you where I
109.362	first bumped into this problem.
112.993	I was out in the Bay area 
112.993	in '99, 2000, the dot com boom.
117.047	I worked for a fabulously
117.047	spectacular flame-out called Webvan.
121.109	(Laughter)
122.93	This company raised hundreds of
122.93	millions of dollars with the notion that
125.66	we will deliver
125.66	grocery orders online.
128.442	And it really came down to the fact
128.442	that we couldn't do it cost effectively.
132.615	Turns out e-commerce was something
132.615	that was very hard and very costly.
136.577	In this particular instance we were trying
136.577	to assemble 30 items of inventory
140.828	into a few totes, onto a van
140.828	to deliver to the home.
144.8	And when you think about it,
144.8	it was costing us 30 dollars.
148.6	Imagine, we had an
151.686	that was costing us one dollar to
151.686	pick and pack into that tote.
155.362	And that's before we actually
155.362	tried to deliver it to the home.
158.57	So long story short,
158.57	during my one year at Webvan,
161.357	what I realized by talking to 
161.357	all the material-handling providers
164.593	was that there was no solution designed
164.593	specifically to solve each base picking.
169.231	Red item, green, blue, getting
169.231	those three things in a box.
173.254	So we said, there's just
173.254	got to be a better way to do this.
176.239	Existing material handling
176.239	was set up to pump
178.766	pallets and cases of
178.766	goo to retail stores.
182.533	Of course Webvan went out of business,
182.533	and about a year and a half later,
186.33	I was still noodling on this problem.
186.33	It was still nagging at me.
189.91	And I started
189.91	thinking about it again.
191.778	And I said, let me just focus briefly
191.778	on what I wanted as a pick worker,
196.905	or my vision for
196.905	how it should work.
199.236	(Laughter)
200.65	I said, let's focus
200.65	on the problem.
202.572	I have an order here and what
202.572	I want to do is I want to put
206.427	red, green and blue
206.427	in this box right here.
208.647	What I need is a system where I put out
208.647	my hand and — poof! —
211.499	the product shows up 
211.499	and I pack it into the order,
214.022	and now we're thinking,
215.715	this would be a very operator-centric
215.715	approach to solving the problem.
219.729	This is what I need. What technology
219.729	is available to solve this problem?
223.956	But as you can see, orders can come
223.956	and go, products can come and go.
227.897	It allows us to focus on making the
227.897	pick worker the center of the problem,
232.58	and providing them the tools to make
232.58	them as productive as possible.
237.204	So how did I
237.204	arrive at this notion?
239.304	Well, actually it came from
239.304	a brainstorming exercise,
242.837	probably a technique
242.837	that many of you use,
245.677	It's this notion of
245.677	testing your ideas.
247.833	Take a blank sheet, of course,
249.563	but then test your ideas
249.563	at the limits — infinity, zero.
253.593	In this particular case, we
253.593	challenged ourselves with the idea:
256.775	What if we had to build a
256.775	distribution center in China,
259.751	where it's a very,
259.751	very low-cost market?
262.365	And say, labor is cheap,
262.365	land is cheap.
265.578	And we said specifically,
267.224	"""What if it was zero dollars"
267.224	an hour for direct labor
270.23	and we could build a million-
270.23	"square-foot distribution center?"""
272.946	So naturally that
272.946	led to ideas that said,
275.021	"""Let's put lots of people"
275.021	"in the warehouse."""
276.829	"And I said, ""Hold on,"
276.829	zero dollars per hour,
279.374	what I would do is 'hire'
	warehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,
286.358	walk into the warehouse and
286.358	pick up one item of inventory
289.477	and then just stand there.
291.21	So you hold Captain Crunch,
291.21	you hold the Mountain Dew,
293.749	you hold the Diet Coke.
295.172	If I need it, I'll call you,
295.172	otherwise just stand there.
297.428	But when I need Diet Coke and I call it,
297.428	you guys talk amongst yourselves.
300.815	Diet Coke walks up to the front —
300.815	"pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."""
304.936	Wow, what if the products
304.936	could walk and talk on their own?
309.588	That's a very interesting,
309.588	very powerful way
311.926	that we could potentially
311.926	organize this warehouse.
314.52	So of course,
314.52	labor isn't free,
316.868	on that practical
316.868	versus awesome spectrum.
320.176	(Laughter)
321.866	So we said mobile shelving —
321.866	We'll put them on mobile shelving.
324.983	We'll use mobile robots and
324.983	we'll move the inventory around.
329.776	And so we got underway on that and
329.776	then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.
334.194	Did any of you see the Beijing
334.194	Olympics, the opening ceremonies?
338.013	I about fell out of my
338.013	couch when I saw this.
341.054	I'm like, that was the idea!
342.527	(Laughter and Applause)
347.026	We'll put thousands of people on
347.026	the warehouse floor, the stadium floor.
350.917	But interestingly enough, this
350.917	actually relates to the idea
354.952	in that these guys were creating some
354.952	incredibly powerful, impressive digital art,
360.364	all without computers,
360.364	I'm told,
362.44	it was all peer-to-peer
362.44	coordination and communication.
364.886	You stand up,
364.886	I'll squat down.
366.462	And they made
366.462	some fabulous art.
368.107	It speaks to the
368.107	power of emergence
370.795	in systems when you let things
370.795	start to talk with each other.
374.763	So that was a little
374.763	bit of the journey.
378.541	So of course, now what became
378.541	the practical reality of this idea?
382.579	Here is a warehouse.
384.385	It's a pick, pack and ship center
384.385	that has about 10,000 different SKUs.
388.161	We'll call them red pens,
388.161	green pens, yellow Post-It Notes.
392.298	We send the little orange robots
392.298	out to pick up the blue shelving pods.
395.677	And we deliver them
395.677	to the side of the building.
397.845	So all the pick workers now
397.845	get to stay on the perimeter.
400.981	And the game here is
400.981	to pick up the shelves,
403.323	take them down the highway and
403.323	deliver them straight to the pick worker.
406.647	This pick worker's life
406.647	is completely different.
408.784	Rather than wandering around
408.784	the warehouse, she gets to stay still
412.201	in a pick station like this
413.789	and every product in the
413.789	building can now come to her.
417.787	So the process
417.787	is very productive.
421.065	Reach in, pick an item,
421.065	scan the bar code, pack it out.
425.26	By the time
425.26	you turn around,
426.909	there's another product there
426.909	ready to be picked and packed.
429.948	So what we've done is take
429.948	out all of the non-value added
432.958	walking, searching,
432.958	wasting, waited time,
435.642	and we've developed a very 
435.642	high-fidelity way to pick these orders,
439.92	where you point at it with
439.92	a laser, scan the UPC barcode,
444.084	and then indicate with a light
444.084	which box it needs to go into.
447.278	So more productive, more
447.278	accurate and, it turns out,
450.764	it's a more interesting office
450.764	environment for these pick workers.
455.07	They actually complete
455.07	the whole order.
457.507	So they do red, green and blue,
457.507	not just a part of the order.
460.034	And they feel a little bit more
460.034	in control of their environment.
463.648	So the side effects
463.648	of this approach
466.846	are what really surprised us.
468.414	We knew it was going 
468.414	to be more productive.
469.992	But we didn't realize just how
469.992	pervasive this way of thinking
474.062	extended to other
474.062	functions in the warehouse.
479.292	But what effectively this approach
479.292	is doing inside of the DC
484.124	is turning it into a massively
484.124	parallel processing engine.
488.588	So this is again a
488.588	cross-fertilization of ideas.
491.211	Here's a warehouse
491.211	and we're thinking about
493.15	parallel processing
493.15	supercomputer architectures.
496.669	The notion here is that you have
	the right side of the screen
501.863	that are now all independent
501.863	autonomous pick workers.
506.111	If the worker in station three decides
506.111	to leave and go to the bathroom,
510.015	it has no impact on the
510.015	productivity of the other nine workers.
513.499	Contrast that, for a moment, with the
513.499	traditional method of using a conveyor.
517.869	When one person
517.869	passes the order to you,
519.928	you put something in
519.928	and pass it downstream.
522.427	Everyone has to be in place
522.427	for that serial process to work.
525.544	This becomes a more robust
525.544	way to think about the warehouse.
528.721	And then underneath the hoods gets
528.721	interesting in that we're tracking
533.265	the popularity
533.265	of the products.
535.003	And we're using dynamic
535.003	and adaptive algorithms
537.827	to tune the floor
537.827	of the warehouse.
542.281	So what you see here potentially
542.281	the week leading up to Valentine's Day.
547.165	All that pink chalky candy has
547.165	moved to the front of the building
551.008	and is now being picked into a
551.008	lot of orders in those pick stations.
554.901	Come in two days after Valentine's Day,
554.901	and that candy, the leftover candy,
559.064	has all drifted to the
559.064	back of the warehouse
561.337	and is occupying the cooler
561.337	zone on the thermal map there.
565.63	One other side effect of this
565.63	approach using the parallel processing
569.113	is these things can
569.113	scale to ginormous.
572.108	(Laughter)
573.635	So whether you're doing
573.635	two pick stations, 20 pick stations,
576.369	or 200 pick stations, the
576.369	path planning algorithms
579.642	and all of the inventory
579.642	algorithms just work.
582.185	In this example you
582.185	see that the inventory
586.541	has now occupied all the
586.541	perimeter of the building
588.867	because that's where
588.867	the pick stations were.
591.213	They sorted it
591.213	out for themselves.
593.231	So I'll conclude with
593.231	just one final video
595.518	that shows how
595.518	this comes to bear
598.502	on the pick worker's actual
598.502	day in the life of.
602.096	So as we mentioned, the process is
602.096	to move inventory along the highway
606.432	and then find your way
606.432	into these pick stations.
609.084	And our software in the background
611.555	understands what's going on 
611.555	in each station,
614.306	we direct the pods
614.306	across the highway
616.917	and we're attempting to
616.917	get into a queuing system
619.631	to present the work
619.631	to the pick worker.
622.515	What's interesting is we can even
622.515	adapt the speed of the pick workers.
625.76	The faster pickers get more pods
625.76	and the slower pickers get few.
629.686	But this pick worker now is
629.686	literally having that experience
632.824	that we described before.
634.677	She puts out her hand.
634.677	The product jumps into it.
637.221	Or she has to reach in and get it.
639.426	She scans it and 
639.426	she puts it in the bucket.
641.871	And all of the rest of the technology
641.871	is kind of behind the scenes.
645.667	So she gets to now focus on the
645.667	picking and packing portion of her job.
649.528	Never has any idle time,
649.528	never has to leave her mat.
652.802	And actually we think
652.802	not only a more productive
656.942	and more accurate
656.942	way to fill orders.
660.212	We think it's a more
660.212	fulfilling way to fill orders.
663.622	The reason we can say
663.622	that, though, is that workers
666.83	in a lot of these
666.83	buildings now compete
668.972	for the privilege of working
668.972	in the Kiva zone that day.
672.154	And sometimes we'll catch
672.154	them on testimonial videos
674.817	saying such things as,
676.934	they have more energy after the
676.934	day to play with their grandchildren,
681.18	"or in one case a guy said, ""the"
681.18	Kiva zone is so stress-free
685.776	that I've actually stopped taking
685.776	"my blood pressure medication."""
688.891	(Laughter)
690.725	That was at a pharmaceutical distributor,
690.725	so they told us not to use that video.
694.724	(Laughter)
698.292	So what I wanted to leave you
698.292	with today is the notion that
701.316	when you let things start
701.316	to think and walk
704.171	and talk on their own, interesting
704.171	processes and productivities can emerge.
709.462	And now I think next time
709.462	you go to your front step
712.403	and pick up that box that
712.403	you just ordered online,
714.914	you break it open and
714.914	the goo is in there,
717.138	you'll have some wonderment
717.138	as to whether a robot
719.891	assisted in the picking
719.891	and packing of that order.
722.484	Thank you.
724.163	(Applause)
