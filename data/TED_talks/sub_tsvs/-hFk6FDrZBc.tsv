12.16	Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,
17.16	I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.
21.16	Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,
24.16	which, as some of you may know,
27.16	is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.
30.16	So that's why I've always been fascinated
34.16	with how technology could actually reshape
37.16	and open up authoritarian societies like ours.
40.16	So, I'm graduating college
42.16	and, feeling very idealistic,
44.16	I decided to join the NGO
46.16	which actually was using new media
48.16	to promote democracy and media reform
50.16	in much of the former Soviet Union.
53.16	However, to my surprise,
55.16	I discovered that dictatorships
57.16	do not crumble so easily.
59.16	In fact, some of them actually
62.16	survived the Internet challenge,
64.16	and some got even more repressive.
67.16	So this is when I ran out of my idealism and
70.16	decided to quit my NGO job
72.16	and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.
77.16	Now, I must tell you that this was never
79.16	a very popular argument,
82.16	and it's probably not very popular yet
84.16	with some of you sitting in this audience.
86.16	It was never popular with many political leaders,
89.16	especially those in the United States
91.16	who somehow thought that new media
93.16	would be able to do what missiles couldn't.
97.16	That is, promote democracy in difficult places
100.16	where everything else has already been tried and failed.
104.16	And I think by 2009,
106.16	this news has finally reached Britain,
109.16	so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.
112.16	However, there is an underlying argument about logistics,
117.16	which has driven so much of this debate. Right?
120.16	So if you look at it close enough,
122.16	you'll actually see that much of this
124.16	is about economics.
127.16	The cybertopians say, much like fax machines
130.16	and Xerox machines did in the '80s,
133.16	blogs and social networks
135.16	have radically transformed the economics of protest,
138.16	so people would inevitably rebel.
141.16	To put it very simply,
143.16	the assumption so far has been
145.16	that if you give people enough connectivity,
148.16	if you give them enough devices,
151.16	democracy will inevitably follow.
153.16	And to tell you the truth,
155.16	I never really bought into this argument,
158.16	in part because I never saw three American presidents
161.16	agree on anything else in the past.
163.16	(Laughter)
167.16	But, you know, even beyond that,
169.16	if you think about the logic underlying it,
171.16	is something I call iPod liberalism,
174.16	where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese
178.16	who happens to have and love his iPod
180.16	will also love liberal democracy.
184.16	And again, I think this is kind of false.
188.16	But I think a much bigger problem with this
190.16	is that this logic --
192.16	that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --
195.16	I mean, it would make a fascinating title
198.16	for Thomas Friedman's new book.
200.16	(Laughter)
201.16	But this is rarely a good sign. Right?
205.16	So, the bigger problem with this logic
209.16	is that it confuses the intended
211.16	versus the actual uses of technology.
215.16	For those of you who think that
217.16	new media of the Internet
219.16	could somehow help us avert genocide,
222.16	should look no further than Rwanda,
224.16	where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations
227.16	which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.
231.16	But even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,
234.16	what you can actually see
236.16	is that certain governments
238.16	have mastered the use of cyberspace
241.16	for propaganda purposes. Right?
243.16	And they are building what I call the Spinternet.
245.16	The combination of spin, on the one hand,
248.16	and the Internet on the other.
250.16	So governments from Russia to China to Iran
253.16	are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers
256.16	in order to leave ideological comments
259.16	and create a lot of ideological blog posts
261.16	to comment on sensitive political issues. Right?
264.16	So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?
268.16	Why are they engaging with cyberspace?
270.16	Well my theory is that
272.16	it's happening because censorship actually
275.16	is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.
278.16	The moment you put something critical in a blog,
282.16	even if you manage to ban it immediately,
285.16	it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.
289.16	So the more you block it,
291.16	the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship
294.16	and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
297.16	So the only way to control this message
301.16	is actually to try to spin it
303.16	and accuse anyone who has written something critical
306.16	of being, for example, a CIA agent.
308.16	And, again, this is happening quite often.
311.16	Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.
315.16	There was a big case in February 2009
319.16	"called ""Elude the Cat."""
321.16	And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.
325.16	So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,
328.16	a Chinese man, died in prison custody.
331.16	And police said that it happened
334.16	because he was playing hide and seek,
336.16	"which is ""elude the cat"" in Chinese slang,"
339.16	with other inmates and hit his head
341.16	against the wall,
343.16	which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.
350.16	So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.
354.16	In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,
358.16	had 35,000 comments
360.16	on this issue within hours.
362.16	But then authorities did something very smart.
365.16	Instead of trying to purge these comments,
368.16	they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.
371.16	"And they basically said, ""Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."""
376.16	So 500 people applied,
379.16	and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,
383.16	and thus inspect it and then blog about it.
387.16	Within days the entire incident was forgotten,
390.16	which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.
393.16	People would keep talking about it for weeks.
396.16	And this actually fits with another interesting theory
400.16	about what's happening in authoritarian states
403.16	and in their cyberspace.
405.16	This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,
408.16	and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics
413.16	and letting them engage with each other online.
415.16	We tend to think
417.16	that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,
420.16	but in many cases it only strengthens them.
423.16	And you may wonder why.
425.16	I'll just give you a very short list of reasons
427.16	why authoritarian deliberation
430.16	may actually help the dictators.
432.16	And first it's quite simple.
434.16	Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.
437.16	They don't really have the data they need
440.16	in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.
443.16	So encouraging people to actually go online
446.16	and share information and data
448.16	on blogs and wikis is great
450.16	because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats
453.16	will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?
457.16	So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis
459.16	produce knowledge has been great.
461.16	Secondly, involving public in any decision making
464.16	is also great
466.16	because it helps you to share the blame
468.16	for the policies which eventually fail.
470.16	"Because they say, ""Well look, we asked you,"
472.16	we consulted you, you voted on it.
474.16	You put it on the front page of your blog.
476.16	"Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."""
479.16	And finally, the purpose of
482.16	any authoritarian deliberation efforts
484.16	is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.
487.16	So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,
491.16	having them participate in decision making,
493.16	it's actually great.
495.16	Because what happens is that then
497.16	you can actually point to this initiative and say,
499.16	"""Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."""
502.16	Just to give you an example,
504.16	one of the Russian regions, for example,
506.16	now involves its citizens
508.16	in planning its strategy up until year 2020.
512.16	Right? So they can go online
514.16	and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.
518.16	I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know
520.16	that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.
523.16	So having people involved in planning for 2020
526.16	is not necessarily going to change anything,
528.16	because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.
532.16	Just to give you an example from Iran,
534.16	we all heard about the Twitter revolution
536.16	that happened there,
538.16	but if you look close enough, you'll actually see
540.16	that many of the networks and blogs
542.16	and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.
545.16	They may have become slower,
547.16	but the activists could still access it
549.16	and actually argue that having access to them
551.16	is actually great for many authoritarian states.
554.16	And it's great simply because
557.16	they can gather open source intelligence.
561.16	In the past it would take you weeks, if not months,
564.16	to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.
567.16	Now you actually know how they connect to each other
569.16	by looking at their Facebook page.
571.16	I mean KGB, and not just KGB,
573.16	used to torture in order to actually get this data.
576.16	Now it's all available online.
578.16	(Laughter)
580.16	But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall
582.16	that cybertopians made
584.16	is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.
587.16	We often hear about cyber activism,
590.16	how people are getting more active because of the Internet.
593.16	Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,
595.16	how people are becoming passive.
597.16	Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet
599.16	is going to be the catalyst of change
601.16	that will push young people into the streets,
603.16	while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses
606.16	which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
609.16	That's not an option being considered too strongly.
613.16	So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,
616.16	there may as well be two digital captives
618.16	who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
621.16	And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it
623.16	because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people
627.16	and it plays a completely different social role for them.
629.16	If you look at some of the surveys
631.16	on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,
634.16	you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,
637.16	for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,
640.16	is three times more than in the United States.
643.16	So it does play a social role,
645.16	however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
648.16	So the way I tend to think of it
650.16	is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,
652.16	a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.
654.16	But the point here is that
656.16	when we get the remote Russian village online,
659.16	what will get people to the Internet
661.16	is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.
663.16	"It's going to be pornography, ""Sex and the City,"""
666.16	or maybe watching funny videos of cats.
669.16	So this is something you have to recognize.
671.16	So what should we do about it?
673.16	Well I say we have to stop thinking
675.16	about the number of iPods per capita
678.16	and start thinking about ways in which
680.16	we can empower intellectuals,
683.16	dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.
686.16	Because even what has been happening up 'til now
689.16	with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,
691.16	there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.
694.16	So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions
697.16	and actually start doing something about it.
699.16	Thank you.
701.16	(Applause)
