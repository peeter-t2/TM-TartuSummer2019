15.26	I am going to speak about corruption,
17.26	but I would like to juxtapose
20.26	two different things.
22.26	One is the large global economy,
27.26	the large globalized economy,
30.26	and the other one is the small, and very limited,
33.26	capacity of our traditional governments
37.26	and their international institutions
39.26	to govern, to shape, this economy.
43.26	Because there is this asymmetry,
48.26	which creates, basically,
51.26	failing governance.
53.26	Failing governance in many areas:
55.26	in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,
59.26	in the area of exploitation of women and children,
62.26	in the area of climate change,
66.26	in all the areas in which we really need
69.26	a capacity to reintroduce
74.26	the primacy of politics
77.26	into the economy,
79.26	which is operating in a worldwide arena.
84.26	And I think corruption,
86.26	and the fight against corruption,
88.26	and the impact of corruption,
90.26	is probably one of the most interesting ways
92.26	to illustrate what I mean
94.26	with this failure of governance.
97.26	Let me talk about my own experience.
101.26	I used to work as the director
104.26	of the World Bank office in Nairobi
107.26	for East Africa.
109.26	At that time, I noticed
111.26	that corruption, that grand corruption,
114.26	that systematic corruption,
116.26	was undermining everything we were trying to do.
120.26	And therefore, I began
122.26	to not only try to protect
125.26	the work of the World Bank,
127.26	our own projects, our own programs
129.26	against corruption,
131.26	"but in general, I thought, ""We need a system"
134.26	to protect the people
136.26	in this part of the world
138.26	"from the ravages of corruption."""
141.26	And as soon as I started this work,
144.26	I received a memorandum from the World Bank,
147.26	from the legal department first,
149.26	"in which they said, ""You are not allowed to do this."
151.26	You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
155.26	This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,
158.26	"so I want you to stop your doings."""
161.26	In the meantime, I was chairing
163.26	donor meetings, for instance,
165.26	in which the various donors,
167.26	and many of them like to be in Nairobi --
170.26	it is true, it is one of the
172.26	unsafest cities of the world,
174.26	but they like to be there because the other cities
176.26	are even less comfortable.
179.26	And in these donor meetings, I noticed
181.26	that many of the worst projects --
183.26	which were put forward
185.26	by our clients, by the governments,
187.26	by promoters,
189.26	many of them representing
191.26	suppliers from the North --
193.26	that the worst projects
195.26	were realized first.
197.26	Let me give you an example:
199.26	a huge power project,
204.26	to be built smack into
206.26	one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,
209.26	areas of western Kenya.
212.26	And we all noticed immediately
214.26	that this project had no economic benefits:
217.26	It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,
221.26	nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
223.26	To the contrary, we knew that this project
226.26	would destroy the environment:
228.26	It would destroy riparian forests,
230.26	which were the basis for
232.26	the survival of nomadic groups,
234.26	the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
238.26	So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,
241.26	this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --
244.26	not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
248.26	for these hundreds of millions of dollars,
250.26	and the siphoning off
253.26	of the scarce resources of the economy
255.26	from much more important activities
258.26	like schools, like hospitals and so on.
260.26	And yet, we all rejected this project,
263.26	none of the donors was willing
265.26	to have their name connected with it,
268.26	and it was the first project to be implemented.
270.26	The good projects, which we as a donor community
273.26	would take under our wings,
275.26	they took years, you know,
277.26	you had too many studies,
279.26	and very often they didn't succeed.
281.26	But these bad projects,
283.26	which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy
285.26	for many generations, for the environment,
288.26	for thousands of families who had to be resettled --
291.26	they were suddenly put together
293.26	by consortia of banks,
296.26	of supplier agencies,
298.26	of insurance agencies --
300.26	like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --
303.26	and they came back very, very quickly,
305.26	driven by an unholy alliance
307.26	between the powerful elites
311.26	in the countries there
313.26	and the suppliers from the North.
315.26	Now, these suppliers
317.26	were our big companies.
319.26	They were the actors of this global market,
322.26	which I mentioned in the beginning.
324.26	They were the Siemenses of this world,
327.26	coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,
329.26	from Canada, from Germany,
331.26	and they were systematically driven
334.26	by systematic, large-scale corruption.
337.26	We are not talking about
341.26	or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
344.26	No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
347.26	on the Swiss bank accounts,
349.26	on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,
351.26	of the president's ministers,
355.26	the high officials in the para-statal sectors.
358.26	This was the reality which I saw,
360.26	and not only one project like that:
362.26	I saw, I would say,
364.26	over the years I worked in Africa,
366.26	I saw hundreds of projects like this.
368.26	And so, I became convinced
371.26	that it is this systematic corruption
374.26	which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,
377.26	which is the main reason
380.26	for the misery, for the poverty,
383.26	for the conflicts, for the violence,
385.26	for the desperation
387.26	in many of these countries.
389.26	That we have today
391.26	more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,
394.26	that we have more than a billion people
397.26	without proper drinking water in the world,
399.26	twice that number,
401.26	more than two billion people
403.26	without sanitation and so on,
405.26	and the consequent illnesses
407.26	of mothers and children,
410.26	still, child mortality of more than
415.26	children dying before they are five years old:
417.26	The cause of this is, to a large extent,
420.26	grand corruption.
422.26	Now, why did the World Bank
425.26	not let me do this work?
428.26	I found out afterwards,
431.26	after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
434.26	The reason was that the members of the World Bank
437.26	thought that foreign bribery was okay,
440.26	including Germany.
442.26	In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
444.26	It was even tax-deductible.
447.26	No wonder that most of the most important
449.26	international operators in Germany,
452.26	but also in France and the UK
454.26	and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.
456.26	Not all of them, but most of them.
459.26	And this is the phenomenon
461.26	which I call failing governance,
464.26	because when I then came to Germany
466.26	and started this little NGO
468.26	here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,
472.26	"we were told, ""You cannot stop"
475.26	our German exporters from bribing,
477.26	because we will lose our contracts.
480.26	We will lose to the French,
482.26	"we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."""
485.26	And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,
488.26	which made it very difficult
490.26	for an individual company,
492.26	an individual exporting country
495.26	"to say, ""We are not going to"
497.26	continue this deadly, disastrous
500.26	"habit of large companies to bribe."""
504.26	So this is what I mean
506.26	with a failing governance structure,
509.26	because even the powerful government,
511.26	which we have in Germany, comparatively,
514.26	was not able to say,
516.26	"""We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."""
519.26	They needed help,
521.26	and the large companies themselves
523.26	have this dilemma.
525.26	Many of them didn't want to bribe.
527.26	Many of the German companies, for instance,
529.26	believe that they are really
531.26	producing a high-quality product
533.26	at a good price, so they are very competitive.
536.26	They are not as good at bribing
539.26	as many of their international competitors are,
541.26	but they were not allowed
543.26	to show their strengths,
545.26	because the world was eaten up
548.26	by grand corruption.
550.26	And this is why I'm telling you this:
554.26	Civil society rose to the occasion.
558.26	We had this small NGO,
560.26	Transparency International.
562.26	They began to think of
564.26	an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,
567.26	and we developed concepts
571.26	of collective action,
573.26	basically trying to bring various competitors
575.26	together around the table,
577.26	explaining to all of them
579.26	how much it would be in their interests
581.26	if they simultaneously would stop bribing,
583.26	and to make a long story short,
586.26	we managed to eventually
588.26	get Germany to sign
590.26	together with the other OECD countries
592.26	and a few other exporters.
594.26	In 1997, a convention,
597.26	under the auspices of the OECD,
599.26	which obliged everybody
601.26	to change their laws
603.26	and criminalize foreign bribery.
605.26	(Applause)
609.26	Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,
611.26	in doing this,
613.26	we had to sit together with the companies.
616.26	We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,
619.26	we had sessions with about
623.26	and we discussed with them
625.26	what to do about international bribery.
627.26	In the first session -- we had three sessions
629.26	over the course of two years.
631.26	And President von Weizs√§cker, by the way,
634.26	chaired one of the sessions, the first one,
636.26	to take the fear away
638.26	from the entrepreneurs,
641.26	who were not used to deal
643.26	with non-governmental organizations.
645.26	And in the first session, they all said,
648.26	"""This is not bribery, what we are doing."" This is customary there."
651.26	This is what these other cultures demand.
654.26	They even applaud it.
656.26	In fact, [unclear]
658.26	still says this today.
660.26	And so there are still a lot of people
662.26	who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
665.26	But in the second session,
667.26	they admitted already that they would never do this,
669.26	what they are doing in these other countries,
672.26	here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.
674.26	Cabinet ministers would admit this.
677.26	And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,
680.26	we had them all sign an open letter
683.26	to the Kohl government, at the time,
685.26	requesting that they
687.26	participate in the OECD convention.
689.26	And this is, in my opinion,
692.26	an example of soft power,
694.26	because we were able to convince them
696.26	that they had to go with us.
698.26	We had a longer-term time perspective.
701.26	We had a broader,
703.26	geographically much wider,
705.26	constituency we were trying to defend.
707.26	And that's why the law has changed.
709.26	That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
712.26	and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.
715.26	In some other countries, the OECD convention
718.26	is not yet properly enforced.
720.26	And, again, civil societies
722.26	breathing down the neck of the establishment.
725.26	In London, for instance,
727.26	where the BAE got away
729.26	with a huge corruption case,
731.26	which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,
737.26	every year for ten years,
739.26	to one particular official of one particular friendly country,
742.26	who then bought for
748.26	This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.
750.26	Why? Because they consider this
752.26	as contrary to the security interest
755.26	of the people of Great Britain.
757.26	Civil society is pushing, civil society
759.26	is trying to get a solution to this problem,
762.26	also in the U.K.,
764.26	and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,
766.26	and so on.
768.26	In Germany, we are pushing
770.26	the ratification of the UN convention,
772.26	which is a subsequent convention.
774.26	We are, Germany, is not ratifying.
776.26	Why? Because it would make it necessary
779.26	to criminalize the corruption
782.26	of deputies.
784.26	In Germany, we have a system where
786.26	you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,
789.26	but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
792.26	This is, under German law, allowed,
795.26	and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,
797.26	and this is why they can't sign
799.26	the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --
802.26	one of they very, very few countries
804.26	which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,
807.26	but not able to ratify the convention,
809.26	which we managed to get on the books
812.26	with about 160 countries all over the world.
815.26	I see my time is ticking.
817.26	Let me just try to
819.26	draw some conclusions from what has happened.
822.26	I believe that what we managed to achieve
826.26	in fighting corruption,
829.26	one can also achieve
831.26	in other areas of failing governance.
833.26	By now, the United Nations
835.26	is totally on our side.
837.26	The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,
841.26	they became, I would say, the strongest
844.26	anti-corruption agency in the world.
846.26	Most of the large companies
848.26	are now totally convinced
850.26	that they have to put in place
852.26	very strong policies
854.26	against bribery and so on.
856.26	And this is possible because civil society
859.26	joined the companies
861.26	and joined the government
863.26	in the analysis of the problem,
865.26	in the development of remedies,
867.26	in the implementation of reforms,
870.26	and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.
873.26	Of course, if civil society organizations
876.26	want to play that role,
878.26	they have to grow into this responsibility.
882.26	Not all civil society organizations are good.
885.26	The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.
888.26	So, we must be aware
890.26	that civil society
892.26	has to shape up itself.
894.26	They have to have a much more
896.26	transparent financial governance.
898.26	They have to have a much more participatory governance
901.26	in many civil society organizations.
904.26	We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
907.26	This is why we have set up the governance school
910.26	and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,
912.26	because we believe most of our educational
915.26	and research institutions in Germany
917.26	and continental Europe in general,
919.26	do not focus enough, yet,
921.26	on empowering civil society
923.26	and training the leadership of civil society.
926.26	But what I'm saying from my very practical experience:
929.26	If civil society does it right
932.26	and joins the other actors --
935.26	in particular, governments,
937.26	governments and their international institutions,
940.26	but also large international actors,
943.26	in particular those which have committed themselves
945.26	to corporate social responsibility --
947.26	then in this magical triangle
950.26	between civil society,
952.26	government and private sector,
954.26	there is a tremendous chance
956.26	for all of us to create a better world.
960.26	Thank you.
962.26	(Applause)
