16.103	I'd like to show you a video of some of the models
18.148	I work with.
19.737	They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.
23.275	Did I mention they're gorgeous?
25.813	And they're scientific models? (Laughs)
28.943	As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,
31.286	and this is a video of some of the beating heart
33.735	that I've engineered in the lab.
35.951	And one day we hope that these tissues
37.833	can serve as replacement parts for the human body.
40.777	But what I'm going to tell you about today
43.057	is how these tissues make awesome models.
47.504	Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
50.231	You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing,
53.209	and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing,
55.712	before the drugs get to market.
57.977	It costs a lot of money, a lot of time,
61.12	and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market,
63.93	it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
67.865	And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
71.952	It all boils down to two issues. One, humans are not rats,
76.136	and two, despite our incredible similarities to one another,
80.224	actually those tiny differences between you and I
82.665	have huge impacts with how we metabolize drugs
85.174	and how those drugs affect us.
87.043	So what if we had better models in the lab
89.875	that could not only mimic us better than rats
93.145	but also reflect our diversity?
97.065	Let's see how we can do it with tissue engineering.
100.992	One of the key technologies that's really important
103.521	is what's called induced pluripotent stem cells.
106.713	They were developed in Japan pretty recently.
109.231	Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
111.678	They're a lot like embryonic stem cells
113.791	except without the controversy.
116.008	We induce cells, okay, say, skin cells,
118.907	by adding a few genes to them, culturing them,
121.414	and then harvesting them.
123.035	So they're skin cells that can be tricked,
125.742	kind of like cellular amnesia, into an embryonic state.
128.526	So without the controversy, that's cool thing number one.
131.238	Cool thing number two, you can grow any type of tissue
133.787	out of them: brain, heart, liver, you get the picture,
136.342	but out of your cells.
138.865	So we can make a model of your heart, your brain
142.43	on a chip.
145.062	Generating tissues of predictable density and behavior
147.918	is the second piece, and will be really key towards
150.75	getting these models to be adopted for drug discovery.
153.422	And this is a schematic of a bioreactor we're developing in our lab
156.534	to help engineer tissues in a more modular, scalable way.
159.982	Going forward, imagine a massively parallel version of this
163.381	with thousands of pieces of human tissue.
165.718	It would be like having a clinical trial on a chip.
169.766	But another thing about these induced pluripotent stem cells
173.561	is that if we take some skin cells, let's say,
176.11	from people with a genetic disease
178.286	and we engineer tissues out of them,
180.542	we can actually use tissue-engineering techniques
182.51	to generate models of those diseases in the lab.
185.911	Here's an example from Kevin Eggan's lab at Harvard.
189.495	He generated neurons
191.785	from these induced pluripotent stem cells
194.5	from patients who have Lou Gehrig's Disease,
197.129	and he differentiated them into neurons, and what's amazing
199.572	is that these neurons also show symptoms of the disease.
202.724	So with disease models like these, we can fight back
204.823	faster than ever before and understand the disease better
207.405	than ever before, and maybe discover drugs even faster.
211.368	This is another example of patient-specific stem cells
214.748	that were engineered from someone with retinitis pigmentosa.
218.757	This is a degeneration of the retina.
220.511	It's a disease that runs in my family, and we really hope
223.268	that cells like these will help us find a cure.
225.492	So some people think that these models sound well and good,
228.3	"but ask, ""Well, are these really as good as the rat?"""
231.741	The rat is an entire organism, after all,
234.729	with interacting networks of organs.
236.435	A drug for the heart can get metabolized in the liver,
240.356	and some of the byproducts may be stored in the fat.
243.196	Don't you miss all that with these tissue-engineered models?
247.723	Well, this is another trend in the field.
249.837	By combining tissue engineering techniques with microfluidics,
252.704	the field is actually evolving towards just that,
254.868	a model of the entire ecosystem of the body,
257.374	complete with multiple organ systems to be able to test
259.774	how a drug you might take for your blood pressure
261.377	might affect your liver or an antidepressant might affect your heart.
264.644	These systems are really hard to build, but we're just starting to be able to get there,
268.716	and so, watch out.
272.02	But that's not even all of it, because once a drug is approved,
274.652	tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments.
278.334	This is an example that you might care about someday,
282.076	and I hope you never do,
284.196	because imagine if you ever get that call
286.716	that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer.
289.924	Wouldn't you rather test to see if those cancer drugs
292.46	you're going to take are going to work on your cancer?
295.22	This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're
297.642	using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells
300.548	and study its progressions and treatments.
303.019	And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models
305.572	like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer
308.66	might spread from one part of the body to the next,
311.38	and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips
313.764	to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
316.749	And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed,
319.171	you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering
321.084	is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening
323.54	at every single step of the path:
326.318	disease models making for better drug formulations,
328.892	massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing,
332.763	reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials,
336.988	and individualized therapies that disrupt
338.68	what we even consider to be a market at all.
342.268	Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback
344.812	between developing a molecule and learning about
347.135	how it acts in the human body.
349.484	Our process for doing this is essentially transforming
351.812	biotechnology and pharmacology into an information technology,
356.673	helping us discover and evaluate drugs faster,
359.652	more cheaply and more effectively.
362.868	It gives new meaning to models against animal testing, doesn't it?
366.948	Thank you. (Applause)
