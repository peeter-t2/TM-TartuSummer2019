12.76	When I was first learning to meditate,
14.64	the instruction was to simply
14.64	pay attention to my breath,
17.72	and when my mind wandered,
17.72	to bring it back.
20.64	Sounded simple enough.
22.68	Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,
25.92	sweating through T-shirts
25.92	in the middle of winter.
29.28	I'd take naps every chance I got
29.28	because it was really hard work.
32.64	Actually, it was exhausting.
35.4	The instruction was simple enough
37.16	but I was missing something
37.16	really important.
40.32	So why is it so hard to pay attention?
43.08	Well, studies show
44.56	that even when we're really
44.56	trying to pay attention to something --
47.76	like maybe this talk --
49.36	at some point,
50.6	about half of us
50.6	will drift off into a daydream,
52.96	or have this urge
52.96	to check our Twitter feed.
56.36	So what's going on here?
59	It turns out that we're fighting one
59	of the most evolutionarily-conserved
62.48	learning processes
62.48	currently known in science,
65.36	one that's conserved
66.6	back to the most basic
66.6	nervous systems known to man.
69.84	This reward-based learning process
71.52	is called positive
71.52	and negative reinforcement,
73.72	and basically goes like this.
76.2	We see some food that looks good,
77.92	"our brain says, ""Calories! ... Survival!"""
80.64	We eat the food, we taste it --
82.16	it tastes good.
83.4	And especially with sugar,
84.96	our bodies send a signal
84.96	to our brain that says,
87.24	"""Remember what you're eating"
87.24	"and where you found it."""
91.28	We lay down this context-dependent memory
94.04	and learn to repeat the process next time.
96.52	See food,
97.76	eat food, feel good,
99.48	repeat.
100.96	Trigger, behavior, reward.
103.6	Simple, right?
105.92	Well, after a while,
105.92	our creative brains say,
108.08	"""You know what?"
109.32	You can use this for more
109.32	than just remembering where food is.
112.96	You know, next time you feel bad,
115.16	why don't you try eating
115.16	"something good so you'll feel better?"""
119.72	We thank our brains for the great idea,
121.76	try this and quickly learn
123.36	that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
123.36	when we're mad or sad,
126.68	we feel better.
128.64	Same process,
130.04	just a different trigger.
131.8	Instead of this hunger signal
131.8	coming from our stomach,
134.92	this emotional signal -- feeling sad --
136.92	triggers that urge to eat.
139.04	Maybe in our teenage years,
141.199	we were a nerd at school,
143.6	and we see those rebel kids
143.6	outside smoking and we think,
146.32	"""Hey, I want to be cool."""
147.6	So we start smoking.
149.8	The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
149.8	and that was no accident.
153.56	See cool,
154.8	smoke to be cool,
156.12	feel good. Repeat.
157.96	Trigger, behavior, reward.
160.64	And each time we do this,
161.92	we learn to repeat the process
163.96	and it becomes a habit.
165.92	So later,
167.24	feeling stressed out triggers
167.24	that urge to smoke a cigarette
170.88	or to eat something sweet.
173.2	Now, with these same brain processes,
176.16	we've gone from learning to survive
178.08	to literally killing ourselves
178.08	with these habits.
180.96	Obesity and smoking
182.24	are among the leading preventable causes
182.24	of morbidity and mortality in the world.
187.48	So back to my breath.
189.72	What if instead of fighting our brains,
192.12	or trying to force ourselves
192.12	to pay attention,
194.68	we instead tapped into this natural,
194.68	reward-based learning process ...
198.72	but added a twist?
200.52	What if instead we just got really curious
202.6	about what was happening
202.6	in our momentary experience?
205.12	I'll give you an example.
206.68	In my lab,
207.92	we studied whether mindfulness training
207.92	could help people quit smoking.
211.28	Now, just like trying to force myself
211.28	to pay attention to my breath,
214.96	they could try to force
214.96	themselves to quit smoking.
218.24	And the majority of them
218.24	had tried this before and failed --
221.2	on average, six times.
223.96	Now, with mindfulness training,
225.48	we dropped the bit about forcing
225.48	and instead focused on being curious.
229.6	In fact, we even told them to smoke.
232.84	"What? Yeah, we said, ""Go ahead and smoke,"
234.84	just be really curious
234.84	"about what it's like when you do."""
238.4	And what did they notice?
240.12	Well here's an example
240.12	from one of our smokers.
242.84	"She said, ""Mindful smoking:"
244.6	smells like stinky cheese
246.24	and tastes like chemicals,
247.88	"YUCK!"""
249.68	Now, she knew, cognitively
249.68	that smoking was bad for her,
253.08	that's why she joined our program.
255.68	What she discovered just by being
255.68	curiously aware when she smoked
260.24	was that smoking tastes like shit.
263.4	(Laughter)
266.36	Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.
270.399	She moved from knowing in her head
270.399	that smoking was bad for her
273.519	to knowing it in her bones,
276	and the spell of smoking was broken.
278.32	She started to become
278.32	disenchanted with her behavior.
282.96	Now, the prefrontal cortex,
285.08	that youngest part of our brain
285.08	from an evolutionary perspective,
288.64	it understands on an intellectual level
288.64	that we shouldn't smoke.
292.72	And it tries its hardest
292.72	to help us change our behavior,
296.56	to help us stop smoking,
297.92	to help us stop eating that second,
297.92	that third, that fourth cookie.
302.96	We call this cognitive control.
304.48	We're using cognition
304.48	to control our behavior.
307.96	Unfortunately,
309.2	this is also the first part of our brain
311.16	that goes offline
311.16	when we get stressed out,
313.2	which isn't that helpful.
314.48	Now, we can all relate to this
314.48	in our own experience.
316.981	We're much more likely to do things
316.981	like yell at our spouse or kids
320.16	when we're stressed out or tired,
321.8	even though we know
321.8	it's not going to be helpful.
324.16	We just can't help ourselves.
327.12	When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,
329.32	we fall back into our old habits,
331.56	which is why this disenchantment
331.56	is so important.
334.44	Seeing what we get from our habits
336.12	helps us understand them
336.12	at a deeper level --
338.32	to know it in our bones
339.6	so we don't have to force
339.6	ourselves to hold back
341.88	or restrain ourselves from behavior.
343.64	We're just less interested
343.64	in doing it in the first place.
346.44	And this is what mindfulness is all about:
349	Seeing really clearly what we get
349	when we get caught up in our behaviors,
353.56	becoming disenchanted on a visceral level
357.16	and from this disenchanted stance,
357.16	naturally letting go.
360.92	This isn't to say that, poof,
360.92	magically we quit smoking.
364.44	But over time, as we learn
364.44	to see more and more clearly
367.08	the results of our actions,
368.44	we let go of old habits and form new ones.
372.12	The paradox here
373.48	is that mindfulness is just
373.48	about being really interested
376.32	in getting close and personal
377.76	with what's actually happening
377.76	in our bodies and minds
380.36	from moment to moment.
382	This willingness
382	to turn toward our experience
384.32	rather than trying to make unpleasant
384.32	cravings go away as quickly as possible.
388.76	And this willingness
388.76	to turn toward our experience
391.36	is supported by curiosity,
393.24	which is naturally rewarding.
395	What does curiosity feel like?
396.76	It feels good.
399.04	And what happens when we get curious?
401.37	We start to notice that cravings
401.37	are simply made up of body sensations --
404.84	oh, there's tightness, there's tension,
407.12	there's restlessness --
408.8	and that these body
408.8	sensations come and go.
411.88	These are bite-size pieces of experiences
414.88	that we can manage from moment to moment
416.92	rather than getting clobbered
416.92	by this huge, scary craving
421.08	that we choke on.
422.48	In other words, when we get curious,
425	we step out of our old,
425	fear-based, reactive habit patterns,
429.76	and we step into being.
432	We become this inner scientist
434.92	where we're eagerly awaiting
434.92	that next data point.
438.16	Now, this might sound
438.16	too simplistic to affect behavior.
442.72	But in one study,
442.72	we found that mindfulness training
445.2	was twice as good as gold standard therapy
445.2	at helping people quit smoking.
449.12	So it actually works.
451.8	And when we studied
451.8	the brains of experienced meditators,
454.64	we found that parts of a neural network
454.64	of self-referential processing
458.48	called the default mode network
460.08	were at play.
461.32	Now, one current hypothesis
461.32	is that a region of this network,
464.28	called the posterior cingulate cortex,
466.52	is activated not necessarily
466.52	by craving itself
469.28	but when we get caught up in it,
469.28	when we get sucked in,
471.92	and it takes us for a ride.
473.64	In contrast, when we let go --
475.76	step out of the process
477.16	just by being curiously aware
477.16	of what's happening --
479.68	this same brain region quiets down.
483.32	Now we're testing app and online-based
483.32	mindfulness training programs
487.44	that target these core mechanisms
490.6	and, ironically, use the same technology
490.6	that's driving us to distraction
495.12	to help us step out
495.12	of our unhealthy habit patterns
497.68	of smoking, of stress eating
497.68	and other addictive behaviors.
501.72	Now, remember that bit
501.72	about context-dependent memory?
504.32	We can deliver these tools
504.32	to peoples' fingertips
507.24	in the contexts that matter most.
509.52	So we can help them
510.76	tap into their inherent capacity
510.76	to be curiously aware
513.76	right when that urge to smoke
513.76	or stress eat or whatever arises.
518.64	So if you don't smoke or stress eat,
520.48	maybe the next time you feel this urge
520.48	to check your email when you're bored,
524.159	or you're trying to distract
524.159	yourself from work,
526.423	or maybe to compulsively respond
526.423	to that text message when you're driving,
531.08	see if you can tap into
531.08	this natural capacity,
534.96	just be curiously aware
536.24	of what's happening in your body
536.24	and mind in that moment.
539.2	It will just be another chance
540.68	to perpetuate one of our endless
540.68	and exhaustive habit loops ...
544.36	or step out of it.
546.08	Instead of see text message,
546.08	compulsively text back,
549	feel a little bit better --
550.76	notice the urge,
552.24	get curious,
553.72	feel the joy of letting go
555.68	and repeat.
557.44	Thank you.
558.68	(Applause)
