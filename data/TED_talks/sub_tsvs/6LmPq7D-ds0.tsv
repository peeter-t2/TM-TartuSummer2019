12.727	Thank you very much. Good evening.
14.382	Some of you may have noticed
14.382	that my last name is Nutt.
18.336	And if you did,
18.336	you are forgiven for wondering
21.163	how a Nutt managed
21.163	to end up in a war zone.
24.103	I actually was offered, right out
24.103	of medical school, and accepted
28.468	a volunteer contract to work
28.468	with UNICEF in war-torn Somalia,
32.329	that was worth one dollar.
34.832	And, you see, I had to be paid this dollar
37.267	in the event that the UN needed
37.267	to issue an evacuation order,
40.426	so that I would be covered.
42.52	I was, after all, heading into one
42.52	of the world's most dangerous places.
47.34	And by now, some of you
47.34	may be asking yourselves,
50.499	and I just want to reassure you,
52.055	that I did get half the money up front.
54.378	(Laughter)
56.717	But you see, this is how,
56.717	with 50 cents in my pocket,
59.593	I ended up in Baidoa, Somalia.
62.615	"Journalists called it the ""city of death."""
65.299	And they called it the city of death
67.147	because 300,000 people
67.147	had lost their lives there --
74.387	mostly as a result
74.387	of war-related famine and disease.
79.487	I was part of a team that was tasked
79.487	with trying to figure out
83.458	how best to respond
83.458	to this humanitarian catastrophe.
86.839	It was right on the heels
86.839	of the Rwandan genocide,
89.578	and aid money to the region was drying up.
92.269	Many aid organizations, unfortunately,
94.335	had been forced to close their doors.
96.935	And so the question that I was asked
96.935	to specifically help answer,
100.669	which is one that aid workers ask
100.669	themselves in war zones the world over,
107.202	is: What the hell do we do now?
110.131	You know, the security environment
110.131	in Somalia at that moment in time --
113.559	and nothing has really changed too much --
115.614	"can best be described as ""Mad Max"""
115.614	"by way of ""A Clockwork Orange."""
121.477	And I remember very distinctly
121.477	a couple of days after my arrival,
126.632	I went up to a feeding clinic.
129.967	There were dozens of women
129.967	who were standing in line,
132.529	and they were clutching
132.529	their infants very close.
136.309	About 20 minutes into
136.309	this conversation I was having
139.078	with this one young woman,
141.126	I leaned forward
143.26	and tried to put my finger
143.26	in the palm of her baby's hand.
148.225	And when I did this,
149.56	I discovered that her baby
149.56	was already in rigor.
154.249	She was stiff,
156.709	and her little, lifeless hand
156.709	was curled into itself.
160.986	She had died hours before
164.759	of malnutrition and dehydration.
168.242	I later learned
168.242	that as her baby was dying,
171.164	this young woman had
171.164	been held for two days
175.51	by some teenage boys who were armed
175.51	with Kalashnikov rifles,
180.27	and they were trying
180.27	to shake her down for more money,
182.824	money she very clearly did not have.
185.807	And this is a scene that I have confronted
189.172	in war zones the world over;
192.435	places where kids, some as young
192.435	as eight -- they are this big --
198.345	and those kids, they have
198.345	never been to school.
201.049	But they have fought and they have killed
201.049	with automatic rifles.
208.589	Is this just the way the world is?
212.451	Some will you tell you
212.451	that war is unavoidably human.
217.234	After all, it is as old
217.234	as existence itself.
221.419	We say never again, and yet it happens
221.419	again and again and again.
229.232	But I will tell you
229.232	that I have seen the absolute worst
235.671	of what we as human beings
235.671	are capable of doing to one another,
240.222	and yet I still believe
240.222	a different outcome is possible.
245.659	Do you want to know why?
247.536	Because over 20 years of doing this work,
249.878	going in and out of war zones
249.878	around the world,
252.613	I have come to understand
254.78	that there are aspects of this problem
256.724	that we, all of us, as people
256.724	occupying this shared space,
261.421	that we can change --
263.628	not through force or coercion or invasion,
267.586	but by simply looking at all
267.586	of the options available to us
271.94	and choosing the ones that favor
271.94	peace at the expense of war,
277.722	instead of war at the expense of peace.
283.158	How so?
284.444	Well, I want you to consider this:
286.207	there are at least 800 million
286.207	small arms and light weapons
291.688	in circulation in the world today.
294.788	The vast majority of civilians,
294.788	like that young baby,
298.301	who are dying in war zones
298.301	around the world,
300.714	are dying at the hands
300.714	of various armed groups
303.713	who rely on a near-infinite supply
303.713	of cheap, easy and efficient weapons
310.063	to rape, threaten, intimidate
310.063	and brutalize those civilians
314.747	at every turn.
316.937	How cheap?
318.112	Well, in some parts of the world,
319.752	you can buy an AK-47
319.752	for as little as 10 dollars.
324.174	In many places in which I have worked,
327.621	it is easier to get access
327.621	to an automatic rifle
332.142	than it is to get access
332.142	to clean drinking water.
337.04	And so now the important part:
339.699	Can anything be done about this?
343.922	To answer that question,
345.826	let's take a look
345.826	at this map of the world.
348.246	And now, let's add in all of the countries
348.246	that are currently at war,
353.266	and the number of people
353.266	who have either died
355.624	or have been displaced
355.624	as a result of that violence.
358.116	It is a staggering number --
359.536	more than 40 million people.
362.764	But you will also notice
362.764	something else about this map.
365.455	You will notice
365.455	that most of those countries
367.599	are in the Global South.
369.453	Now, let's look at the countries
371.767	that are the world's top 20 exporters
371.767	of small arms in the world.
377.559	And what do we notice?
379.331	Well, you see them in green.
380.818	You will notice that those are mostly
380.818	countries in the Global North,
384.732	primarily Western countries.
386.454	What does this tell us?
387.694	This tells us that most of the people
387.694	who are dying in war
391.209	are living in poor countries,
393.136	and yet most of the people
393.136	who are profiting from war
396.609	are living in rich countries --
396.609	people like you and me.
401.804	And then what if we go
401.804	beyond small arms for a second.
404.63	What if we look at all weapons
404.63	in circulation in the world?
407.878	Who does the biggest business?
409.686	Well, roughly 80 percent of those weapons
412.185	come from none other
412.185	than the five permanent members
415.751	of the United Nations Security Council,
417.666	plus Germany.
419.769	It's shocking, isn't it?
421.515	Now, some of you might be saying
421.515	at this moment in time,
424.215	"""Oh yeah, but OK,"
424.215	"hang on a second there ... Nutt."""
427.49	(Laughter)
430.267	Grade school was spectacular for me.
432.104	It was, really, a wonderful experience.
434.072	(Laughter)
437.42	But you might be saying to yourselves,
439.286	You know, all of these weapons
439.286	in war zones -- they're not a cause,
442.658	but an effect of the violence
442.658	that plagues them
445.104	each and every single day.
446.612	You know, places like Iraq
446.612	and Afghanistan,
448.819	where they need these weapons
448.819	to be able to maintain law and order,
452.257	promote peace and security,
452.257	to combat terror groups --
455.902	surely this is a good thing.
458.773	Let's take a look at that assumption
458.773	for just one moment,
461.485	because you see there has been
461.485	a boom in the small-arms trade
465.295	since the start of the War on Terror.
467.103	In fact, it is a business
467.103	that has grown threefold
470.325	over the past 15 years.
472.688	And now let's compare that
472.688	to the number of people
476.269	who have directly died
476.269	in armed conflict around the world
480.119	in that same period.
481.627	What do you notice?
483.096	Well, you notice that, in fact,
483.096	that also goes up
485.477	roughly three- to fourfold.
487.112	They basically go up
487.112	and end at the same point.
491.31	Now, we can have a circular argument here
494.104	about whether this increase
494.104	in fatalities is a response
498.2	to the increase of small arms,
498.2	or the other way around.
502.133	But here's what we should
502.133	really take away from this.
504.653	What we should take away from this
506.337	is that this is a relationship
506.337	worth scrutinizing,
511.447	especially when you consider
511.447	that small arms that were shipped to Iraq
516.337	for use by the Iraqi Army,
518.155	or to Syria for so-called
518.155	moderate opposition fighters,
521.426	that those arms, many of them,
521.426	are now in the hands of ISIS;
526.096	or when you consider that arms
526.096	that were shipped to Libya
528.86	are now actively drifting
528.86	across the Sahel,
531.597	and ending up with groups
531.597	like Boko Haram and al Qaeda
536.364	and other militant groups.
539.95	And therein lies the problem.
542.466	Because, you see,
543.642	small arms anywhere
543.642	are a menace everywhere,
549.831	because their first stop
549.831	is rarely their last.
554.904	Spending on war per person per year
557.344	now amounts to about 249 dollars --
563.838	which is roughly 12 times
563.838	what we spend on foreign aid,
568.801	money that is used to educate
568.801	and vaccinate children
572.262	and combat malnutrition
572.262	in the Global South.
575.814	But we can shift that balance.
579.604	How do we do this?
580.779	Well, it is essentially a problem
580.779	of both supply and demand,
583.645	so we can tackle it from both sides.
585.993	On the supply side,
587.687	we can push our governments
590.885	to adopt international arms
590.885	transparency mechanisms
593.972	like the Arms Trade Treaty,
595.797	which makes it so that rich countries
595.797	have to be more accountable
599.588	for where their arms are going
601.287	and what their arms might be used for.
603.71	Here in the United States,
604.999	the largest arms-exporting country
604.999	in the world by far,
609.64	President Obama has rightly signed
609.64	the Arms Trade Treaty,
613.589	but none of it takes effect,
613.589	it isn't binding,
616.174	until it is approved
616.174	and ratified by the Senate.
620.865	This is where we need
620.865	to make our voices heard.
623.843	You know, the curbing of small arms --
627.581	it's not going to solve
627.581	the problem of war.
630.407	Increased control mechanisms
630.407	won't solve that problem.
633.713	But it's an important step
633.713	in the right direction.
636.984	And it's up to all of us
636.984	who live in those rich countries
639.881	to make change here.
641.994	What about on the demand side?
645.227	You know, there are generations
645.227	around the world
648.004	who are being lost to war.
651.202	It is possible to disrupt
651.202	that cycle of violence
654.217	with investments in education,
654.217	in strengthening the rule of law
658.234	and in economic development,
658.234	especially for women.
660.639	I have personally seen
662.291	just how incredibly powerful
662.291	those kinds of efforts can be
665.356	around the world.
667.458	But here's the thing:
668.858	they take time,
670.29	which means for you as individuals,
670.29	if you want to give,
674.353	please, by all means do it.
676.084	But know that how you give
676.084	is just as important
679.671	as how much you give.
682.147	Regular contributions
682.147	like monthly contributions
684.616	are a far more effective way of giving,
687.928	because they allow
687.928	humanitarian organizations
690.665	to properly plan and be invested
690.665	over the long term,
695.014	and to be present in the lives of families
695.014	who have been affected by war,
700.663	wars that many of us, frankly,
700.663	all too quickly forget.
705.939	When I first got on that plane
705.939	for Somalia as a young doctor,
712.942	I had no idea what it meant
712.942	to live with war.
717.519	But I can tell you that I know
717.519	what it means now.
720.636	And I know what it means
723.529	to lie in bed in the pitch-black night
728.684	and listen to that haunting
728.684	"""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!"""
733.295	of automatic gunfire,
736.002	and wonder with absolute dread
739.298	how many minutes I have left
739.298	until it will be right on top of me.
743.556	I can tell you that it is a terrifying
743.556	and agonizing fear,
748.617	one that millions of people
748.617	around the world are forced to confront
752.998	each and every single day,
755.188	especially children.
757.417	Over the years of doing this work,
760.181	unfortunately, war has killed
760.181	far too many people close to me.
766.277	And on at least a couple of occasions,
769.277	war has very nearly killed me as well.
773.309	But I firmly believe,
778.207	which is why I get up and do
778.207	what I do every single day,
781.786	that we can make different choices here.
785.284	Because you see, war is ours,
788.127	as human beings.
789.73	We buy it, sell it, spread it and wage it.
793.96	We are therefore
793.96	not powerless to solve it.
798.569	On the contrary,
800.264	we are the only ones who can.
803.731	Thank you very much, and I want
803.731	to wish you the greatest success.
806.865	(Applause)
