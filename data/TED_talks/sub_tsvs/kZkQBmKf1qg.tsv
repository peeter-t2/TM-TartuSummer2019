12.996	In June of 1998,
14.807	Tori Murden McClure left Nags Head,
14.807	North Carolina for France.
20.147	That's her boat, the American Pearl.
22.469	It's 23 feet long and just six feet across
24.913	at its widest point.
26.881	The deck was the size of a cargo bed
26.881	of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.
31.873	Tori and her friends built it by hand,
34.357	and it weighed about 1,800 pounds.
37.051	Her plan was to row it alone
39.414	across the Atlantic Ocean --
41.364	no motor, no sail --
43.5	something no woman and no American
43.5	had ever done before.
47.262	This would be her route:
48.841	over 3,600 miles across
48.841	the open North Atlantic Ocean.
53.068	Professionally, Tori worked
53.068	as a project administrator
55.683	for the city of Louisville, Kentucky,
57.478	her hometown,
59.289	but her real passion was exploring.
61.704	This was not her first big expedition.
64.188	Several years earlier, she'd become
64.188	the first woman to ski to the South Pole.
68.554	She was an accomplished rower in college,
70.783	even competed for a spot
70.783	on the 1992 U.S. Olympic team,
74.265	but this, this was different.
78.189	(Video) (Music) Tori Murden McClure:
78.189	Hi. It's Sunday, July 5.
84.83	Sector time 9 a.m.
86.711	So that's Kentucky time now.
89.892	Dawn Landes: Tori made
89.892	these videos as she rowed.
92.237	This is her 21st day at sea.
94.536	At this point, she'd covered
94.536	over 1,000 miles,
97.299	had had no radio contact
97.299	in more than two weeks
99.969	following a storm that disabled
99.969	all her long-range communications systems
103.409	just five days in.
105.123	Most days looked like this.
107.144	At this point, she'd rowed
107.144	over 200,000 strokes,
110.905	fighting the current and the wind.
113.227	Some days, she traveled
113.227	as little as 15 feet.
116.71	Yeah.
118.219	And as frustrating as those days were,
120.866	other days were like this.
123.908	(Video) TMM: And I want to show you
123.908	my little friends.
127.019	DL: She saw fish, dolphins,
131.93	whales, sharks,
134.461	and even some sea turtles.
137.34	After two weeks with no human contact,
139.615	Tori was able to contact
139.615	a local cargo ship
141.937	via VHF radio.
144.863	(Video) TMM: Do you guys
144.863	have a weather report, over?
148.648	Man: Heading up to a low
151.782	ahead of you but it's heading,
154.267	and you're obviously going northeast
156.147	and there's a high behind us.
158.051	That'd be coming
159.909	east-northeast also.
162.416	TMM: Good.
164.019	DL: She's pretty happy to talk
164.019	to another human at this point.
167.925	(Video) TMM: So weather report
167.925	says nothing dramatic
170.367	is going to happen soon.
172.98	DL: What the weather report
172.98	didn't tell her
174.991	was that she was rowing right into
174.991	the path of Hurricane Danielle
178.089	in the worst hurricane season
178.089	on record in the North Atlantic.
184.138	(Video) TMM: Just sprained my ankle.
187.133	There's a very strong wind
187.133	from the east now.
190.848	It's blowing about.
193.286	It's blowing!
196.165	After 12 days of storm
198.859	I get to row for four hours
200.693	without a flagging wind.
202.837	I'm not very happy right now.
204.527	As happy as I was this morning,
206.196	I am unhappy now, so ...
212.2	DL: After nearly three months at sea,
214.195	she'd covered over 3,000 miles.
216.888	She was two thirds of the way there,
218.908	but in the storm, the waves were
218.908	the size of a seven-story building.
222.438	Her boat kept capsizing.
224.614	Some of them were pitchpole capsizes,
224.614	flipping her end over end,
227.818	and rowing became impossible.
230.303	(Video) TMM: It's 6:30 a.m.
233.706	I'm in something big, bad and ugly.
237.06	Two capsizes.
239.66	Last capsize, I took the rib
239.66	off the top of my ceiling with my back.
248.356	I've had about six capsizes now.
251.839	The last one was a pitchpole.
254.346	I have the Argus beacon with me.
257.295	I would set off the distress signal,
259.083	but quite frankly, I don't think they'd
259.083	ever be able to find this little boat.
263.309	It's so far underwater right now,
265.12	the only part that's showing
265.12	pretty much is the cabin.
269.299	It's about 10 a.m.
272.434	I've lost track of the number of capsizes.
275.127	I seem to capsize about
275.127	every 15 minutes.
278.169	I think I may have broken my left arm.
285.204	The waves
286.667	are tearing the boat to shreds.
290.556	I keep praying because
292.042	I'm not sure I'm going
292.042	to make it through this.
295.128	DL: Tori set off her distress beacon
297.447	and was rescued
297.447	by a passing container ship.
300.341	They found her abandoned boat
300.341	two months later adrift near France.
304.325	I read about it in the newspaper.
307.506	In 1998, I was a high school student
307.506	living in Louisville, Kentucky.
311.779	Now, I live in New York City.
311.779	I'm a songwriter.
314.333	And her bravery stuck with me,
314.333	and I'm adapting her story
317.63	"into a musical called ""Row."""
324.99	When Tori returned home,
326.639	she was feeling disheartened,
328.473	she was broke.
329.667	She was having a hard time
329.667	making the transition
331.956	back into civilization.
336.085	In this scene, she sits at home.
338.718	The phone is ringing,
338.718	her friends are calling,
340.965	but she doesn't know how to talk to them.
343.171	She sings this song.
343.171	"It's called ""Dear Heart."""
346.166	(Guitar)
352.331	When I was dreaming,
356.046	I took my body
359.297	to beautiful places
362.617	I'd never been.
365.937	I saw Gibraltar,
369.211	and stars of Kentucky
372.601	burned in the moonlight,
375.875	making me smile.
379.451	And when I awoke here,
382.714	the sky was so cloudy.
386.161	I walked to a party
389.534	where people I know
392.995	try hard to know me
396.222	and ask where I've been,
399.426	but I can't explain
402.514	what I've seen to them.
406.369	Ah, listen, dear heart.
413.242	Just pay attention,
416.359	go right from the start.
420.395	Ah, listen, dear heart.
426.313	You can fall off the map,
429.052	but don't fall apart.
433.532	Ooh ooh ooh,
435.377	ah ah ah ah ah.
440.245	Ah ah,
443.589	ah ah ah.
446.421	When I was out there,
449.63	the ocean would hold me,
453.02	rock me and throw me,
456.364	light as a child.
459.684	But now I'm so heavy,
463.121	nothing consoles me.
466.325	My mind floats like driftwood,
469.761	wayward and wild.
473.035	Ah, listen, dear heart.
479.582	Just pay attention,
482.717	go right from the start.
486.456	Ah, listen, dear heart.
492.748	You can fall off the map,
496.208	but don't fall apart.
500.132	Ooh.
506.912	Eventually, Tori starts to get
506.912	her feet under her.
510.139	She starts hanging out
510.139	with her friends again.
512.6	She meets a guy and falls
512.6	in love for the first time.
516.478	She gets a new job working
516.478	for another Louisville native,
519.543	Muhammad Ali.
521.818	One day, at lunch with her new boss,
524.558	Tori shares the news
524.558	that two other women
526.926	are setting out to row
526.926	across the mid-Atlantic,
529.689	to do something that she
529.689	almost died trying to do.
533.381	His response was classic Ali:
536.502	"""You don't want to go through life"
538.418	as the woman who almost
538.418	"rowed across the ocean."""
542.175	He was right.
544.172	Tori rebuilt the American Pearl,
545.89	and in December of 1999,
547.678	she did it.
549.954	(Applause)
549.954	(Guitar)
556.873	Thank you.
559.404	(Applause)
