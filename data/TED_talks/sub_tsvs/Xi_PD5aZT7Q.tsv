13.342	This is my grandfather.
16.162	And this is my son.
18.506	My grandfather taught me to work with wood
20.734	when I was a little boy,
22.368	and he also taught me the idea that
24.371	if you cut down a tree
24.371	to turn it into something,
27.28	honor that tree's life
27.28	and make it as beautiful
29.559	as you possibly can.
31.709	My little boy reminded me
35.221	that for all the technology
35.221	and all the toys in the world,
38.1	sometimes just a small block of wood,
40.49	if you stack it up tall,
42.321	actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
46.404	These are my buildings.
48.241	I build all around the world
49.961	out of our office
49.961	in Vancouver and New York.
52.793	And we build buildings
52.793	of different sizes and styles
55.554	and different materials,
55.554	depending on where we are.
57.58	But wood is the material
57.58	that I love the most,
59.863	and I'm going to tell you
59.863	the story about wood.
61.818	And part of the reason
61.818	I love it is that every time
63.814	people go into my buildings that are wood,
66.107	I notice they react
66.107	completely differently.
68.853	I've never seen anybody walk
68.853	into one of my buildings
71.401	and hug a steel or a concrete column,
73.754	but I've actually seen
73.754	that happen in a wood building.
76.654	I've actually seen
76.654	how people touch the wood,
79.15	and I think there's a reason for it.
81.235	Just like snowflakes,
81.235	no two pieces of wood
83.741	can ever be the same anywhere on Earth.
86.425	That's a wonderful thing.
88.322	I like to think that wood
90.858	gives Mother Nature
90.858	fingerprints in our buildings.
94.419	It's Mother
94.419	Nature's fingerprints that make
96.505	our buildings connect us to nature
96.505	in the built environment.
101.151	Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest
103.213	that grows to 33 stories tall.
106.29	Down the coast here
106.29	in California, the redwood forest
108.838	grows to 40 stories tall.
111.89	But the buildings
111.89	that we think about in wood
114.532	are only four stories tall
114.532	in most places on Earth.
117.637	Even building codes actually limit
117.637	the ability for us to build
121.358	much taller than four
121.358	stories in many places,
123.741	and that's true here in the United States.
125.765	Now there are exceptions,
127.593	but there needs to be some exceptions,
129.141	and things are going
129.141	to change, I'm hoping.
131.213	And the reason I think that way is that
133.186	today half of us live in cities,
136.31	and that number is going
136.31	to grow to 75 percent.
139.698	Cities and density mean that our buildings
141.783	are going to continue to be big,
144.229	and I think there's a role
144.229	for wood to play in cities.
148.047	And I feel that way
148.047	because three billion people
151.203	in the world today,
151.203	over the next 20 years,
154.049	will need a new home.
155.569	That's 40 percent of the world
155.569	that are going to need
158.117	a new building built for them
158.117	in the next 20 years.
161.202	Now, one in three people
161.202	living in cities today
163.777	actually live in a slum.
165.627	That's one billion people
165.627	in the world live in slums.
168.968	A hundred million people
168.968	in the world are homeless.
173.289	The scale of the challenge for architects
175.88	and for society to deal with in building
178.021	is to find a solution
178.021	to house these people.
182.615	But the challenge is,
182.615	as we move to cities,
186.095	cities are built in these two materials,
189.084	steel and concrete,
189.084	and they're great materials.
192.33	They're the materials of the last century.
194.432	But they're also materials
194.432	with very high energy
197.021	and very high greenhouse gas
197.021	emissions in their process.
201.34	Steel represents about three percent
203.615	of man's greenhouse gas emissions,
205.935	and concrete is over five percent.
208.536	So if you think about that, eight percent
211.15	of our contribution
211.15	to greenhouse gases today
214.567	comes from those two materials alone.
217.735	We don't think about it
217.735	a lot, and unfortunately,
220.151	we actually don't even think
220.151	about buildings, I think,
222.747	as much as we should.
223.947	This is a U.S. statistic
223.947	about the impact of greenhouse gases.
227.567	Almost half of our greenhouse gases
227.567	are related to the building industry,
230.833	and if we look at energy,
230.833	it's the same story.
233.12	You'll notice that transportation's sort
233.12	of second down that list,
236.287	but that's the conversation
236.287	we mostly hear about.
238.977	And although a lot
238.977	of that is about energy,
242.543	it's also so much about carbon.
245.424	The problem I see is that, ultimately,
248.407	the clash of how we solve that problem
250.714	of serving those three billion people
250.714	that need a home,
253.982	and climate change,
253.982	are a head-on collision
257.454	about to happen, or already happening.
260.407	That challenge means that we have
260.407	to start thinking in new ways,
263.118	and I think wood is going
263.118	to be part of that solution,
265.714	and I'm going to tell
265.714	you the story of why.
267.3	As an architect, wood
267.3	is the only material,
269.714	big material, that I can build with
272.13	that's already grown
272.13	by the power of the sun.
275.1	When a tree grows in the forest
275.1	and gives off oxygen
278.878	and soaks up carbon dioxide,
280.975	and it dies and it falls
280.975	to the forest floor,
283.941	it gives that carbon dioxide back
283.941	to the atmosphere or into the ground.
288.246	If it burns in a forest fire,
288.246	it's going to give that carbon
291.216	back to the atmosphere as well.
293.652	But if you take that wood
293.652	and you put it into a building
296.696	or into a piece of furniture
296.696	or into that wooden toy,
300.032	it actually has an amazing capacity
301.723	to store the carbon and provide
301.723	us with a sequestration.
305.878	One cubic meter of wood will store
309.157	one tonne of carbon dioxide.
311.923	Now our two solutions
311.923	to climate are obviously
314.138	to reduce our emissions and find storage.
316.674	Wood is the only major
316.674	material building material
319.032	I can build with that actually
319.032	does both those two things.
322.632	So I believe that we have
325.733	an ethic that the Earth grows our food,
328.285	and we need to move
328.285	to an ethic in this century
330.548	that the Earth should grow our homes.
333.229	Now, how are we going to do that
334.798	when we're urbanizing at this rate
336.088	and we think about wood
336.088	buildings only at four stories?
338.688	We need to reduce the concrete
338.688	and steel and we need
341.189	to grow bigger,
341.189	and what we've been working on
343.404	is 30-story tall buildings made of wood.
347.752	We've been engineering
347.752	them with an engineer
351.35	named Eric Karsh who works with me on it,
353.8	and we've been doing this new work because
356.113	there are new wood products
356.113	out there for us to use,
358.658	and we call them mass timber panels.
360.88	These are panels made with young trees,
363.203	small growth trees, small pieces of wood
366.845	glued together to make
366.845	panels that are enormous:
369.364	eight feet wide, 64 feet long,
369.364	and of various thicknesses.
373.719	The way I describe this
373.719	best, I've found, is to say
376.858	that we're all used
376.858	to two-by-four construction
379.121	when we think about wood.
380.128	That's what people jump
380.128	to as a conclusion.
382.447	Two-by-four construction
382.447	is sort of like the little
384.319	eight-dot bricks of Lego
384.319	that we all played with as kids,
387.058	and you can make all kinds
387.058	of cool things out of Lego
389.995	at that size, and out of two-by-fours.
392.914	But do remember when you were a kid,
393.782	and you kind of sifted
393.782	through the pile in your basement,
396.521	and you found that big
398.655	and you were kind of like,
399.49	"""Cool, this is awesome. I can"
399.49	build something really big,
401.644	"and this is going to be great."""
403.223	That's the change.
404.566	Mass timber panels
404.566	are those 24-dot bricks.
407.512	They're changing the scale
407.512	of what we can do,
409.213	and what we've developed
409.213	is something we call FFTT,
411.886	which is a Creative Commons solution
414.34	to building a very flexible system
419.255	of building with these large
419.255	panels where we tilt up
421.938	six stories at a time if we want to.
425.797	This animation shows you
425.797	how the building goes together
429.413	in a very simple way, but these
429.413	buildings are available
432.969	for architects and engineers
432.969	now to build on
435.222	for different cultures in the world,
436.961	different architectural
436.961	styles and characters.
439.564	In order for us to build safely,
442.366	we've engineered these
442.366	buildings, actually,
444.566	to work in a Vancouver context,
446.286	where we're a high seismic zone,
447.834	even at 30 stories tall.
451.005	Now obviously, every time I bring this up,
452.927	people even, you know, here
452.927	at the conference, say,
454.891	"""Are you serious? Thirty stories?"
454.891	"How's that going to happen?"""
457.868	And there's a lot of really
457.868	good questions that are asked
461.275	and important questions
461.275	that we spent quite a long time
463.082	working on the answers
463.082	to as we put together
465.461	our report and the peer reviewed report.
468.034	I'm just going to focus on a few of them,
469.618	and let's start with fire,
469.618	because I think fire
471.127	is probably the first one that you're
471.127	all thinking about right now.
474.342	Fair enough.
474.945	And the way I describe it is this.
476.638	If I asked you to take
476.638	a match and light it
478.833	and hold up a log and try
478.833	to get that log to go on fire,
482.821	it doesn't happen, right?
482.821	We all know that.
484.62	But to build a fire, you kind
484.62	of start with small pieces
487.393	of wood and you work your way up,
488.989	and eventually you can
488.989	add the log to the fire,
491.636	and when you do add the log
491.636	to the fire, of course,
494.089	it burns, but it burns slowly.
496.621	Well, mass timber panels,
496.621	these new products
498.741	that we're using, are much like the log.
500.988	It's hard to start them
500.988	on fire, and when they do,
503.683	they actually burn
503.683	extraordinarily predictably,
506.3	and we can use fire science
506.3	in order to predict
508.652	and make these buildings
508.652	as safe as concrete
510.772	and as safe as steel.
513.36	The next big issue, deforestation.
516.125	Eighteen percent of our contribution
518.595	to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide
520.68	is the result of deforestation.
522.181	The last thing we want
522.181	to do is cut down trees.
525.623	Or, the last thing we want to do
525.623	is cut down the wrong trees.
529.82	There are models for sustainable forestry
532.761	that allow us to cut trees properly,
534.933	and those are the only trees appropriate
536.862	to use for these kinds of systems.
538.583	Now I actually think that these ideas
540.712	will change the economics
540.712	of deforestation.
544.29	In countries with deforestation issues,
546.391	we need to find a way to provide
548.875	better value for the forest
551.341	and actually encourage
551.341	people to make money
553.725	through very fast growth cycles --
	that make these products
558.574	and allow us to build at this scale.
560.973	We've calculated a 20-story building:
563.174	We'll grow enough wood in North
563.174	America every 13 minutes.
566.461	That's how much it takes.
568.903	The carbon story here
568.903	is a really good one.
571.672	If we built a 20-story building
571.672	out of cement and concrete,
575.274	the process would result
575.274	in the manufacturing
577.747	of that cement and 1,200
577.747	tonnes of carbon dioxide.
581.712	If we did it in wood, in this solution,
584.016	we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes,
585.919	for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes.
588.619	That's the equivalent of about 900 cars
591.296	removed from the road in one year.
594.033	Think back to that three billion people
595.915	that need a new home,
597.154	and maybe this
597.154	is a contributor to reducing.
600.226	We're at the beginning
600.226	of a revolution, I hope,
602.907	in the way we build, because this
602.907	is the first new way
605.503	to build a skyscraper
605.503	in probably 100 years or more.
609.932	But the challenge is changing
609.932	society's perception
612.455	of possibility, and it's a huge challenge.
614.479	The engineering is, truthfully,
614.479	the easy part of this.
617.988	And the way I describe it is this.
620.005	The first skyscraper, technically --
622.165	and the definition of a skyscraper is 10
622.165	stories tall, believe it or not —
624.715	but the first skyscraper
624.715	was this one in Chicago,
627.073	and people were terrified to walk
627.073	underneath this building.
630.028	But only four years after it was built,
631.968	Gustave Eiffel was building
631.968	the Eiffel Tower,
634.594	and as he built the Eiffel Tower,
636.19	he changed the skylines
636.19	of the cities of the world,
640.797	changed and created a competition
643.869	between places like New
643.869	York City and Chicago,
646.084	where developers started building
646.084	bigger and bigger buildings
649.013	and pushing the envelope
649.013	up higher and higher
652.294	with better and better engineering.
654.394	We built this model in New York, actually,
656.428	as a theoretical model on the campus
659.215	of a technical university soon to come,
661.563	and the reason we picked this site
663.414	to just show you what these
663.414	buildings may look like,
666.151	because the exterior can change.
667.938	It's really just the structure
667.938	that we're talking about.
670.671	The reason we picked it is because this
670.671	is a technical university,
673.838	and I believe that wood is the most
675.68	technologically advanced
675.68	material I can build with.
679.32	It just happens to be that Mother
679.32	Nature holds the patent,
682.121	and we don't really feel
682.121	comfortable with it.
684.812	But that's the way it should be,
686.656	nature's fingerprints
686.656	in the built environment.
690.451	I'm looking for this opportunity
692.37	to create an Eiffel Tower
692.37	moment, we call it.
695.56	Buildings are starting
695.56	to go up around the world.
697.6	There's a building in London
697.6	that's nine stories,
699.481	a new building that just
699.481	finished in Australia
701.864	that I believe is 10 or 11.
703.821	We're starting to push the height
703.821	up of these wood buildings,
707.368	and we're hoping, and I'm hoping,
709.173	that my hometown of Vancouver
709.173	actually potentially
712.185	announces the world's tallest
712.185	at around 20 stories
714.855	in the not-so-distant future.
717.538	That Eiffel Tower moment
717.538	will break the ceiling,
720.268	these arbitrary ceilings of height,
721.959	and allow wood buildings
721.959	to join the competition.
724.651	And I believe the race is ultimately on.
726.616	Thank you.
728.066	(Applause)
