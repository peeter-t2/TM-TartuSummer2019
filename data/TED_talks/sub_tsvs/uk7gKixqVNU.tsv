13.592	"[""Rebecca Newberger Goldstein""]"
16.27	"[""Steven Pinker""]"
18.349	"[""The Long Reach of Reason""]"
23.348	Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars.
23.348	Steven Pinker: Okay.
29.857	Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason 
29.857	appears to have fallen on hard times:
33.975	Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth
37.31	and political discourse has become a race
39.776	to the bottom.
42.791	We're living in an era of scientific creationism,
47.345	9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,
51.359	and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.
54.466	People who think too well
56.52	are often accused of elitism,
58.876	and even in the academy,
61.035	there are attacks on logocentrism,
63.684	the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.
68.569	SP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?
71.076	Perhaps reason is overrated.
73.295	Many pundits have argued that a good heart
75.438	and steadfast moral clarity
77.388	are superior to triangulations
77.388	of overeducated policy wonks,
81.626	like the best and brightest and that dragged us
84.291	into the quagmire of Vietnam.
86.153	And wasn't it reason that gave us the means
87.975	to despoil the planet
89.705	and threaten our species with
89.705	weapons of mass destruction?
92.726	In this way of thinking, 
92.726	it's character and conscience,
95.965	not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.
99.091	Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.
102.956	My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led
105.474	by our bodies and our emotions
107.375	and use our puny powers of reason
109.36	merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.
112.72	RNG: How could a reasoned
112.72	argument logically entail
115.917	the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?
119.349	Look, you're trying to persuade
119.349	us of reason's impotence.
123.185	You're not threatening us or bribing us,
125.572	suggesting that we resolve the issue
127.203	with a show of hands or a beauty contest.
130.411	By the very act of trying to
130.411	reason us into your position,
134.348	you're conceding reason's potency.
137.366	Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.
140.372	You show up for that debate
141.77	and you've already lost it.
144.612	SP: But can reason lead us in directions
147.327	that are good or decent or moral?
149.999	After all, you pointed out that reason
152.51	is just a means to an end,
154.284	and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.
156.75	Reason can lay out a road
156.75	map to peace and harmony
159.317	if the reasoner wants peace and harmony,
161.173	but it can also lay out a road
161.173	map to conflict and strife
164	if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.
166.677	Can reason force the reasoner to want
169.003	less cruelty and waste?
171.312	RNG: All on its own, the answer is no,
174.584	but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.
177.345	You need two conditions:
179.699	The first is that reasoners all care
182.258	about their own well-being.
183.968	That's one of the passions that has to be present
186.864	in order for reason to go to work,
189.068	and it's obviously present in all of us.
190.956	We all care passionately
193.486	about our own well-being.
195.75	The second condition is that reasoners
197.583	are members of a community of reasoners
200.068	who can affect one another's well-being,
202.142	can exchange messages,
203.655	and comprehend each other's reasoning.
206.483	And that's certainly true of our gregarious
209.469	and loquatious species,
211.481	well endowed with the instinct for language.
214.337	SP: Well, that sounds good in theory,
216.659	but has it worked that way in practice?
218.673	In particular, can it explain
220.507	a momentous historical development
222.438	that I spoke about five years ago here at TED?
225.305	Namely, we seem to be getting more humane.
227.95	Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive
231.31	as a form of popular entertainment.
233.57	Knights waged constant war on each other
235.449	by trying to kill as many of each
235.449	other's peasants as possible.
238.615	Governments executed people for frivolous reasons,
241.29	like stealing a cabbage
242.7	or criticizing the royal garden.
244.948	The executions were designed to be as prolonged
247.201	and as painful as possible, like crucifixion,
250.139	disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.
252.233	Respectable people kept slaves.
254.299	For all our flaws, we have abandoned
256.272	these barbaric practices.
257.765	RNG: So, do you think it's
257.765	human nature that's changed?
260.533	SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts
263.318	that can erupt in violence,
264.917	like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.
269.287	But we also have instincts that can steer us away,
272.286	like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,
275.778	what Abraham Lincoln called
277.054	the better angels of our nature.
278.643	RNG: So if human nature didn't change,
280.685	what invigorated those better angels?
282.684	SP: Well, among other things,
284.217	our circle of empathy expanded.
286.359	Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain
288.806	only of their family and people in their village.
291.279	But with the expansion of literacy and travel,
294.081	people started to sympathize
296.007	with wider and wider circles,
297.672	the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,
300.553	and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.
303.508	RNG: Can hard-headed scientists
305.714	really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?
308.735	SP: They can and do.
310.416	Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain
312.417	that respond to other people's actions
314.597	the same way they respond to our own.
316.664	Empathy emerges early in life,
318.391	perhaps before the age of one.
320.274	Books on empathy have become bestsellers,
321.917	"like ""The Empathic Civilization"""
323.931	"and ""The Age of Empathy."""
326.111	RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?
328.809	But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument
332.477	for making moral progress.
334.347	For one thing, it's innately biased
336.534	toward blood relations, babies
338.66	and warm, fuzzy animals.
340.494	As far as empathy is concerned,
342.893	ugly outsiders can go to hell.
346.426	And even our best attempts to work up sympathy
349.829	for those who are unconnected with us
351.813	fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature
356.012	that was pointed out by Adam Smith.
358.566	Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire
360.347	of China was suddenly swallowed
360.347	up by an earthquake,
362.962	and let us consider how a 
362.962	man of humanity in Europe
365.552	would react on receiving intelligence
367.254	of this dreadful calamity.
369.317	He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly
371.534	his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.
374.194	He would make many melancholy reflections
376.071	upon the precariousness of human life,
378.261	and when all these humane sentiments
380.275	had been once fairly expressed,
382.118	he would pursue his business or his pleasure
384.37	with the same ease and tranquility
386.519	as if no such accident had happened.
388.611	If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,
391.153	he would not sleep tonight,
392.69	but provided he never saw them,
394.432	he would snore with the most profound security
396.87	over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.
399.779	SP: But if empathy wasn't enough
399.779	to make us more humane,
402.682	what else was there?
404.242	RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be
406.936	one of our most effective better angels: reason.
410.762	Reason has muscle.
413.33	It's reason that provides the push to widen
416.704	that circle of empathy.
418.849	Every one of the humanitarian developments
421.757	that you mentioned originated with thinkers
424.355	who gave reasons for why some practice
427.225	was indefensible.
429.183	They demonstrated that the way people treated
431.822	some particular group of others
433.769	was logically inconsistent
435.555	with the way they insisted
435.555	on being treated themselves.
438.127	SP: Are you saying that reason
439.821	can actually change people's minds?
442.127	Don't people just stick with whatever conviction
444.057	serves their interests
445.538	or conforms to the culture that they grew up in?
448.354	RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:
451.513	Contradictions bother us,
453.591	at least when we're forced to confront them,
455.726	which is just another way of saying
457.544	that we are susceptible to reason.
460.29	And if you look at the history of moral progress,
463.121	you can trace a direct pathway
463.121	from reasoned arguments
466.828	to changes in the way that we actually feel.
470.167	Time and again, a thinker would lay out an argument
473.748	as to why some practice was indefensible,
477.018	irrational, inconsistent with values already held.
482.067	Their essay would go viral,
484.135	get translated into many languages,
486.42	get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,
489.77	and at dinner parties,
491.377	and influence leaders, legislators,
495.43	popular opinion.
496.968	Eventually their conclusions get absorbed
500.221	into the common sense of decency,
502.548	erasing the tracks of the original argument
505.237	that had gotten us there.
507.045	Few of us today feel any need to put forth
509.842	a rigorous philosophical argument
511.95	as to why slavery is wrong
514.209	or public hangings or beating children.
517.767	By now, these things just feel wrong.
520.667	But just those arguments had to be made,
523.504	and they were, in centuries past.
526.253	SP: Are you saying that people needed
528.005	a step-by-step argument to grasp
530.053	why something might be a wee bit wrong
532.112	with burning heretics at the stake?
533.89	RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian
536.807	Sebastian Castellio making the case.
539.729	Sebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,
541.744	and other sects say that they are.
543.384	Who shall be judge?
544.657	If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?
547.095	But then, why does he write so
547.095	many books about manifest truth?
550.114	In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics
552.65	simply as one with whom we disagree.
554.414	And if then we are going to kill heretics,
556.386	the logical outcome will be a war of extermination,
558.627	since each is sure of himself.
560.498	SP: Or with hideous punishments
562.047	like breaking on the wheel?
563.89	RNG: The prohibition in our constitution
566.398	of cruel and unusual punishments
568.43	was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764
572.011	by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.
575.53	Cesare Beccaria: As punishments
575.53	become more cruel,
577.881	the minds of men, which like fluids
579.964	always adjust to the level of the objects
581.923	that surround them, become hardened,
583.802	and after a hundred years of cruel punishments,
586.647	breaking on the wheel causes no more fear
588.839	than imprisonment previously did.
590.983	For a punishment to achieve its objective,
593.03	it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts
595.77	outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,
598.829	and into this calculation ought to be factored
600.937	the certainty of punishment
602.603	and the loss of the good
603.741	that the commission of the crime will produce.
606.376	Everything beyond this is superfluous,
608.168	and therefore tyrannical.
610.119	SP: But surely antiwar movements depended
612.469	on mass demonstrations
613.998	and catchy tunes by folk singers
616.08	and wrenching photographs
616.08	of the human costs of war.
618.987	RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements
622.165	reach back to a long chain of thinkers
624.858	who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize
627.446	our emotions against war,
629.685	such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.
632.812	Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace
634.669	diffuse themselves far and wide,
636.334	and reach great numbers,
638.233	while in war, if anything turns out happily,
640.234	the advantage redounds only to a few,
642.458	and those unworthy of reaping it.
644.469	One man's safety is owing
644.469	to the destruction of another.
647.346	One man's prize is derived
647.346	from the plunder of another.
650.015	The cause of rejoicings made by one side
652.182	is to the other a cause of mourning.
654.53	Whatever is unfortunate in war,
656.071	is severely so indeed,
657.731	and whatever, on the contrary,
659.133	is called good fortune,
660.422	is a savage and a cruel good fortune,
662.341	an ungenerous happiness deriving
662.341	its existence from another's woe.
665.978	SP: But everyone knows that the movement
667.835	to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.
671.053	It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,
673.303	and it only became popular when
673.303	Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel
676.638	"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" became a bestseller."
678.922	RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.
681.839	John Locke bucked the tide of millennia
685.077	that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.
688.502	He argued that it was inconsistent
691.076	with the principles of rational government.
692.998	John Locke: Freedom of men under government
694.643	is to have a standing rule to live by
696.662	common to everyone of that society
698.715	and made by the legislative power erected in it,
701.787	a liberty to follow my own will in all things
703.971	where that rule prescribes not,
705.691	not to be subject to the inconstant,
707.602	uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,
711.009	as freedom of nature is to
711.009	be under no other restraint
713.608	but the law of nature.
715.558	SP: Those words sound familiar.
717.35	Where have I read them before? Ah, yes.
720.076	Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty 
720.076	be not necessary
722.819	in a state, how comes it to be so in a family?
725.431	Or if in a family, why not in a state?
728.411	Since no reason can be alleged for the one
730.279	that will not hold more strongly for the other,
732.387	if all men are born free,
733.82	how is it that all women are born slaves,
736.209	as they must be if being subjected
738.637	to the inconstant, uncertain,
740.675	unknown, arbitrary will of men
743.195	be the perfect condition of slavery?
746.095	RNG: That sort of co-option
748.028	is all in the job description of reason.
750.594	One movement for the expansion of rights
752.769	inspires another because the logic is the same,
756.659	and once that's hammered home,
758.558	it becomes increasingly uncomfortable
761.092	to ignore the inconsistency.
763.286	In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement
766.081	inspired the movements for women's rights,
767.999	children's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.
771.622	But fully two centuries before,
774.044	the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham
776.192	had exposed the indefensibility
778.894	of customary practices such as
781.336	the cruelty to animals.
783.439	Jeremy Bentham: The question
783.439	is not, can they reason,
785.819	nor can they talk, but can they suffer?
789.212	RNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.
792.056	JB: As to any primary mischief,
794.024	it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.
797.281	On the contrary, it produces pleasure.
799.531	The partners are both willing.
801.061	If either of them be unwilling,
802.605	the act is an offense,
803.963	totally different in its nature of effects.
806.172	It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.
808.784	As to the any danger exclusive of pain,
811.028	the danger, if any, much consist
812.74	in the tendency of the example.
814.579	But what is the tendency of this example?
817.713	To dispose others to engage in the same practices.
819.985	But this practice produces not pain of any kind
822.679	to anyone.
824.313	SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century
826.779	for the arguments of these great thinkers
828.638	to trickle down and infiltrate
828.638	the population as a whole.
832.043	It kind of makes you wonder about our own time.
834.522	Are there practices that we engage in
836.491	where the arguments against
836.491	them are there for all to see
839.286	but nonetheless we persist in them?
841.575	RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,
844.567	will they be as appalled by some of our practices
847.782	as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,
851.441	wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?
854.529	SP: I'm sure everyone here
854.529	could think of an example.
857.321	RNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals
859.351	in factory farms.
861.062	SP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders
863.292	and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.
865.994	RNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities
868.719	in the developing world.
870.376	SP: The possession of nuclear weapons.
872.718	RNG: The appeal to religion to justify
875.095	the otherwise unjustifiable,
876.735	such as the ban on contraception.
879.247	SP: What about religious faith in general?
881.035	RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.
883.216	SP: Still, I have become convinced
885.273	that reason is a better angel
886.984	that deserves the greatest credit
888.556	for the moral progress our species has enjoyed
891.21	and that holds out the greatest hope
893.325	for continuing moral progress in the future.
896.141	RNG: And if, our friends,
898.043	you detect a flaw in this argument,
900.723	just remember you'll be depending on reason
904.045	to point it out.
905.416	Thank you.
905.416	SP: Thank you.
908.13	(Applause)
