15.26	When I was seven years old
15.26	and my sister was just five years old,
18.834	we were playing on top of a bunk bed.
21.26	I was two years older
21.26	than my sister at the time --
24.31	I mean, I'm two years
24.31	older than her now --
26.566	but at the time it meant she had to do
26.566	everything that I wanted to do,
29.915	and I wanted to play war.
31.26	So we were up on top of our bunk beds.
33.34	And on one side of the bunk bed,
35.459	I had put out all of my G.I. Joe
35.459	soldiers and weaponry.
38.093	And on the other side were
38.093	all my sister's My Little Ponies
41.005	ready for a cavalry charge.
42.474	There are differing accounts
42.474	of what actually happened that afternoon,
45.791	but since my sister is not
45.791	here with us today,
48.103	let me tell you the true story --
50.023	(Laughter)
51.26	which is my sister's a little
51.26	on the clumsy side.
53.719	Somehow, without any help or push
53.719	from her older brother at all,
56.765	Amy disappeared
56.765	off of the top of the bunk bed
59.259	and landed with this crash on the floor.
61.213	I nervously peered
61.213	over the side of the bed
63.251	to see what had befallen my fallen sister
65.26	and saw that she had landed
65.26	painfully on her hands and knees
68.138	on all fours on the ground.
69.513	I was nervous because
69.513	my parents had charged me
72.013	with making sure that my sister and I
73.899	played as safely
73.899	and as quietly as possible.
76.26	And seeing as how I had
76.26	accidentally broken Amy's arm
79.936	just one week before --
81.26	(Laughter)
85.359	(Laughter ends)
86.384	heroically pushing her out of the way
86.384	of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet,
91.068	(Laughter)
93.126	for which I have yet to be thanked,
93.126	I was trying as hard as I could --
97.233	she didn't even see it coming --
98.853	I was trying hard
98.853	to be on my best behavior.
101.218	And I saw my sister's face,
102.592	this wail of pain
102.592	and suffering and surprise
104.852	threatening to erupt from her mouth
104.852	and wake my parents
107.56	from the long winter's nap
107.56	for which they had settled.
110.18	So I did the only thing
111.36	my frantic seven year-old brain
111.36	could think to do to avert this tragedy.
114.822	And if you have children,
114.822	you've seen this hundreds of times.
117.709	"I said, ""Amy, wait. Don't cry."
117.709	Did you see how you landed?
120.46	No human lands on all fours like that.
123.851	"Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn."""
126.26	(Laughter)
129.653	Now, that was cheating,
130.786	because there was nothing
130.786	she would want more
132.939	than not to be Amy
132.939	the hurt five year-old little sister,
135.604	but Amy the special unicorn.
137.06	Of course, this option
137.06	was open to her brain
139.208	at no point in the past.
140.416	And you could see how my poor,
140.416	manipulated sister faced conflict,
143.537	as her little brain attempted
143.537	to devote resources
145.938	to feeling the pain and suffering
145.938	and surprise she just experienced,
149.261	or contemplating her new-found
149.261	identity as a unicorn.
151.83	And the latter won.
152.96	Instead of crying or ceasing our play,
154.823	instead of waking my parents,
156.26	with all the negative consequences for me,
158.591	a smile spread across her face
160.26	and she scrambled back up
160.26	onto the bunk bed
162.376	with all the grace of a baby unicorn --
164.286	(Laughter)
166.839	with one broken leg.
168.253	What we stumbled across
169.879	at this tender age
169.879	of just five and seven --
171.983	we had no idea at the time --
173.679	was was going be at the vanguard
173.679	of a scientific revolution
176.804	occurring two decades later in the way
176.804	that we look at the human brain.
180.282	We had stumbled across
180.282	something called positive psychology,
183.221	which is the reason I'm here today
184.89	and the reason that I wake up
184.89	every morning.
187.002	When I started talking about this research
189.06	outside of academia,
189.06	with companies and schools,
191.36	the first thing they said to never do
191.36	is to start with a graph.
194.46	The first thing I want to do
194.46	is start with a graph.
196.938	This graph looks boring,
198.26	but it is the reason I get excited
198.26	and wake up every morning.
201.235	And this graph doesn't even mean
201.235	anything; it's fake data.
204.024	What we found is --
205.319	(Laughter)
208.26	If I got this data studying you,
208.26	I would be thrilled,
211.26	because there's a trend there,
213.26	and that means that I can get published,
215.26	which is all that really matters.
217.26	There is one weird red dot
217.26	above the curve,
219.36	there's one weirdo in the room --
221.885	I know who you are, I saw you earlier --
224.934	that's no problem.
226.26	That's no problem, as most of you know,
226.26	because I can just delete that dot.
230.26	I can delete that dot because
230.26	that's clearly a measurement error.
233.388	And we know that's a measurement error
233.388	because it's messing up my data.
236.778	(Laughter)
237.841	So one of the first things we teach people
240.028	in economics, statistics,
240.028	business and psychology courses
242.868	is how, in a statistically valid way,
242.868	do we eliminate the weirdos.
246.057	How do we eliminate the outliers
246.057	so we can find the line of best fit?
249.46	Which is fantastic
249.46	if I'm trying to find out
251.58	how many Advil the average
251.58	person should be taking -- two.
254.36	But if I'm interested in your potential,
257.195	or for happiness or productivity
257.195	or energy or creativity,
260.26	we're creating the cult
260.26	of the average with science.
262.855	If I asked a question like,
264.26	"""How fast can a child learn"
264.26	"how to read in a classroom?"""
266.981	scientists change the answer to
268.49	"""How fast does the average child"
268.49	"learn how to read in that classroom?"""
271.853	and we tailor the class
271.853	towards the average.
274.023	If you fall below the average,
275.57	then psychologists get thrilled,
277.187	because that means you're
277.187	depressed or have a disorder,
280.027	or hopefully both.
281.26	We're hoping for both
281.26	because our business model is,
283.76	if you come into a therapy
283.76	session with one problem,
286.26	we want to make sure you
286.26	leave knowing you have ten,
288.76	so you keep coming back.
289.96	We'll go back into your
289.96	childhood if necessary,
292.199	but eventually we want
292.199	to make you normal again.
294.499	But normal is merely average.
295.96	And positive psychology posits
295.96	that if we study what is merely average,
299.332	we will remain merely average.
301.688	Then instead of deleting
301.688	those positive outliers,
304.006	what I intentionally do is come
304.006	into a population like this one
307.072	and say, why?
308.112	Why are some of you high above the curve
310.06	in terms of intellectual,
310.06	athletic, musical ability,
312.669	creativity, energy levels,
313.96	resiliency in the face
313.96	of challenge, sense of humor?
316.46	Whatever it is, instead of deleting
316.46	you, what I want to do is study you.
320.027	Because maybe we can glean information,
321.96	not just how to move
321.96	people up to the average,
324.138	but move the entire average up
324.138	in our companies and schools worldwide.
327.56	The reason this graph is important to me
329.56	is, on the news, the majority
329.56	of the information is not positive.
332.66	in fact it's negative.
333.76	Most of it's about murder, corruption,
333.76	diseases, natural disasters.
336.96	And very quickly, my brain starts to think
339.06	that's the accurate ratio
339.06	of negative to positive in the world.
342.079	This creates
342.079	"""the medical school syndrome."""
344.307	During the first year of medical training,
346.887	as you read through a list of all
346.887	the symptoms and diseases,
350.299	suddenly you realize you have all of them.
352.554	(Laughter)
353.579	I have a brother in-law named Bobo,
353.579	which is a whole other story.
356.675	Bobo married Amy the unicorn.
358.261	Bobo called me on the phone --
360.017	(Laughter)
362.186	from Yale Medical School,
364.26	"and Bobo said, ""Shawn, I have leprosy."""
366.565	(Laughter)
368.26	Which, even at Yale,
368.26	is extraordinarily rare.
370.871	But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo
373.26	because he had just gotten
373.26	over an entire week of menopause.
376.142	(Laughter)
377.26	We're finding it's not necessarily
377.26	the reality that shapes us,
380.26	but the lens through which your brain
380.26	views the world that shapes your reality.
384.06	And if we can change the lens,
384.06	not only can we change your happiness,
387.361	we can change every single educational
387.361	and business outcome at the same time.
391.033	I applied to Harvard on a dare.
392.56	I didn't expect to get in, and my family
392.56	had no money for college.
395.76	When I got a military scholarship
395.76	two weeks later, they let me go.
398.96	Something that wasn't
398.96	even a possibility became a reality.
401.76	I assumed everyone there
401.76	would see it as a privilege as well,
404.76	that they'd be excited to be there.
406.46	Even in a classroom
406.46	full of people smarter than you,
408.96	I felt you'd be happy just to be
408.96	in that classroom.
411.46	But what I found is,
411.46	while some people experience that,
414.16	when I graduated after my four years
415.96	and then spent the next eight years
415.96	living in the dorms with the students --
419.561	Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy.
421.464	(Laughter)
423.26	I was an officer to counsel students
423.26	through the difficult four years.
426.66	And in my research and my teaching,
428.451	I found that these students,
428.451	no matter how happy they were
431.251	with their original success
431.251	of getting into the school,
433.96	two weeks later their brains were focused,
433.96	not on the privilege of being there,
437.76	nor on their philosophy or physics,
439.46	but on the competition, the workload,
441.26	the hassles, stresses, complaints.
442.96	When I first went in there, I walked
442.96	into the freshmen dining hall,
446.16	which is where my friends from Waco,
446.16	Texas, which is where I grew up --
449.56	I know some of you know this.
451.06	When they'd visit, they'd look around,
452.96	"and say, ""This dining hall looks like"
452.96	"something out of Hogwart's."""
456.16	It does, because that was Hogwart's
456.16	and that's Harvard.
458.76	And when they see this,
459.96	"they say, ""Why do you waste your time"
459.96	studying happiness at Harvard?
463.26	What does a Harvard student
463.26	"possibly have to be unhappy about?"""
466.36	Embedded within that question
467.86	is the key to understanding
467.86	the science of happiness.
470.46	Because what that question assumes
472.16	is that our external world
472.16	is predictive of our happiness levels,
475.256	when in reality, if I know everything
475.256	about your external world,
478.356	I can only predict 10%
478.356	of your long-term happiness.
	is predicted not by the external world,
484.66	but by the way your brain
484.66	processes the world.
486.875	And if we change it,
487.96	if we change our formula
487.96	for happiness and success,
490.413	we can change the way
490.413	that we can then affect reality.
493.259	What we found is that only 25%
493.259	of job successes are predicted by IQ,
499.26	are predicted by your optimism
499.26	levels, your social support
502.26	and your ability to see stress
502.26	as a challenge instead of as a threat.
505.56	I talked to a New England boarding school,
505.56	probably the most prestigious one,
509.26	"and they said, ""We already know that."
511.06	So every year, instead of just teaching
511.06	our students, we have a wellness week.
514.76	And we're so excited. Monday night
514.76	we have the world's leading expert
518.06	will speak about adolescent depression.
519.96	Tuesday night
519.96	it's school violence and bullying.
522.223	Wednesday night is eating disorders.
524.06	Thursday night is illicit drug use.
525.76	And Friday night we're trying to decide
525.76	"between risky sex or happiness."""
529.213	(Laughter)
530.26	"I said, ""That's most people's"
530.26	"Friday nights."""
532.427	(Laughter)
535.26	(Applause)
538.26	Which I'm glad you liked,
538.26	but they did not like that at all.
541.142	Silence on the phone.
542.26	And into the silence, I said,
542.26	"""I'd be happy to speak at your school,"
545.56	but that's not a wellness week,
545.56	that's a sickness week.
548.26	You've outlined all the negative
548.26	things that can happen,
550.96	"but not talked about the positive."""
552.66	The absence of disease is not health.
554.46	Here's how we get to health:
555.86	We need to reverse the formula
555.86	for happiness and success.
558.66	In the last three years,
558.66	I've traveled to 45 countries,
561.36	working with schools and companies
561.36	in the midst of an economic downturn.
564.86	And I found that
564.86	most companies and schools
566.96	follow a formula
566.96	for success, which is this:
569.056	If I work harder, I'll be more successful.
571.156	And if I'm more successful,
571.156	then I'll be happier.
573.56	That undergirds most
573.56	of our parenting and managing styles,
576.36	the way that we motivate our behavior.
578.26	And the problem is it's scientifically
578.26	broken and backwards for two reasons.
581.904	Every time your brain has a success,
583.66	you just changed the goalpost
583.66	of what success looked like.
586.46	You got good grades,
586.46	now you have to get better grades,
589.161	you got into a good school
589.161	and after you get into a better one,
592.156	you got a good job,
592.156	now you have to get a better job,
594.757	you hit your sales target,
594.757	we're going to change it.
597.258	And if happiness is on the opposite side
597.258	of success, your brain never gets there.
601.159	We've pushed happiness
601.159	over the cognitive horizon, as a society.
604.26	And that's because we think
604.26	we have to be successful,
606.808	then we'll be happier.
607.956	But our brains work in the opposite order.
610.055	If you can raise somebody's level
610.055	of positivity in the present,
613.056	then their brain experiences what we now
613.056	call a happiness advantage,
616.32	which is your brain at positive
616.32	performs significantly better
619.258	than at negative, neutral or stressed.
621.15	Your intelligence rises, your creativity
621.15	rises, your energy levels rise.
624.604	In fact, we've found that every single
624.604	business outcome improves.
627.799	Your brain at positive
627.799	is 31% more productive
629.952	than your brain at negative,
629.952	neutral or stressed.
632.286	You're 37% better at sales.
633.686	Doctors are 19 percent
633.686	faster, more accurate
635.806	at coming up with the correct diagnosis
637.76	when positive instead
637.76	of negative, neutral or stressed.
640.46	Which means we can reverse the formula.
642.36	If we can find a way of becoming
642.36	positive in the present,
645.16	then our brains work
645.16	even more successfully
647.232	as we're able to work harder,
647.232	faster and more intelligently.
650.16	We need to be able to reverse this formula
652.26	so we can start to see what our brains
652.26	are actually capable of.
655.26	Because dopamine, which floods
655.26	into your system when you're positive,
658.56	has two functions.
659.648	Not only does it make you happier,
661.649	it turns on all of the learning
661.649	centers in your brain
664.25	allowing you to adapt
664.25	to the world in a different way.
666.851	We've found there are ways
666.851	that you can train your brain
669.552	to be able to become more positive.
671.253	In just a two-minute span of time
671.253	done for 21 days in a row,
674.247	we can actually rewire your brain,
675.948	allowing your brain to actually work
675.948	more optimistically and more successfully.
679.849	We've done these things in research now
681.75	in every company that I've worked with,
683.751	getting them to write down three new
683.751	things that they're grateful for
687.052	for 21 days in a row,
687.052	three new things each day.
689.363	And at the end of that,
690.554	their brain starts to retain a pattern
692.455	of scanning the world not for
692.455	the negative, but for the positive first.
695.956	Journaling about one positive experience
695.956	you've had over the past 24 hours
699.557	allows your brain to relive it.
701.14	Exercise teaches your brain
701.14	that your behavior matters.
703.821	We find that meditation allows your brain
705.822	to get over the cultural ADHD
705.822	that we've been creating
708.423	by trying to do multiple tasks at once
710.324	and allows our brains
710.324	to focus on the task at hand.
712.825	And finally, random acts of kindness
712.825	are conscious acts of kindness.
716.126	We get people,
716.126	when they open up their inbox,
718.294	to write one positive email
719.628	praising or thanking somebody
719.628	in their support network.
722.329	And by doing these activities
723.83	and by training your brain
723.83	just like we train our bodies,
726.531	what we've found is we can reverse
726.531	the formula for happiness and success,
730.032	and in doing so, not only create
730.032	ripples of positivity,
732.759	but a real revolution.
733.86	Thank you very much.
734.96	(Applause)
