12.901	Your company launches
12.901	a search for an open position.
16.848	The applications start rolling in,
19.238	and the qualified candidates
19.238	are identified.
22.613	Now the choosing begins.
25.78	Person A: Ivy League,
25.78	4.0, flawless resume,
31.482	great recommendations.
33.39	All the right stuff.
35.784	Person B: state school,
35.784	fair amount of job hopping,
40.809	and odd jobs like cashier
40.809	and singing waitress.
45.785	But remember -- both are qualified.
49.648	So I ask you:
51.188	who are you going to pick?
53.985	My colleagues and I created
53.985	very official terms
57.575	to describe two distinct
57.575	categories of candidates.
61.731	"We call A ""the Silver Spoon,"""
65.338	the one who clearly had advantages
65.338	and was destined for success.
70.415	"And we call B ""the Scrapper,"""
73.862	the one who had to fight
73.862	against tremendous odds
76.958	to get to the same point.
80.26	You just heard a human resources
80.26	director refer to people
83.764	as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --
85.512	(Laughter)
86.537	which is not exactly politically correct
86.537	and sounds a bit judgmental.
90.94	But before my human resources
90.94	certification gets revoked --
95.364	(Laughter)
96.508	let me explain.
98.73	A resume tells a story.
101.087	And over the years, I've learned
101.087	something about people
104.441	whose experiences read
104.441	like a patchwork quilt,
107.684	that makes me stop and fully consider them
111.184	before tossing their resumes away.
114.698	A series of odd jobs may indicate
117.139	inconsistency, lack of focus,
117.139	unpredictability.
122.089	Or it may signal a committed
122.089	struggle against obstacles.
127.455	At the very least, the Scrapper
127.455	deserves an interview.
132.671	To be clear,
134.186	I don't hold anything
134.186	against the Silver Spoon;
137.463	getting into and graduating
137.463	from an elite university
140.953	takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.
144.397	But if your whole life has been
144.397	engineered toward success,
148.388	how will you handle the tough times?
151.2	One person I hired felt that
151.2	because he attended an elite university,
155.648	there were certain assignments
155.648	that were beneath him,
158.535	like temporarily doing manual labor
158.535	to better understand an operation.
164.505	Eventually, he quit.
167.553	But on the flip side,
170.022	what happens when your whole life
170.022	is destined for failure
174.73	and you actually succeed?
177.832	I want to urge you
177.832	to interview the Scrapper.
182.626	I know a lot about this
182.626	because I am a Scrapper.
187.618	Before I was born,
189.168	my father was diagnosed
189.168	with paranoid schizophrenia,
193.155	and he couldn't hold a job
193.155	in spite of his brilliance.
197.599	"Our lives were one part ""Cuckoo's Nest,"""
200.971	"one part ""Awakenings"""
203.061	"and one part ""A Beautiful Mind."""
205.509	(Laughter)
208.921	I'm the fourth of five children
208.921	raised by a single mother
212.458	in a rough neighborhood
212.458	in Brooklyn, New York.
215.306	We never owned a home,
215.306	a car, a washing machine,
220.086	and for most of my childhood,
220.086	we didn't even have a telephone.
225.035	So I was highly motivated
226.485	to understand the relationship
226.485	between business success and Scrappers,
230.888	because my life could easily
230.888	have turned out very differently.
236.598	As I met successful business people
238.878	and read profiles of high-powered leaders,
242.224	I noticed some commonality.
244.692	Many of them had experienced
244.692	early hardships,
248.642	anywhere from poverty, abandonment,
252.235	death of a parent while young,
254.465	to learning disabilities,
254.465	alcoholism and violence.
258.935	The conventional thinking has been
258.935	that trauma leads to distress,
263.195	and there's been a lot of focus
263.195	on the resulting dysfunction.
266.658	But during studies of dysfunction,
266.658	data revealed an unexpected insight:
272.159	that even the worst circumstances
272.159	can result in growth and transformation.
278.415	A remarkable and counterintuitive
278.415	phenomenon has been discovered,
282.271	which scientists call
282.271	Post Traumatic Growth.
287.494	In one study designed to measure
287.494	the effects of adversity
290.694	on children at risk,
292.676	among a subset of 698 children
297.273	who experienced the most severe
297.273	and extreme conditions,
301.582	fully one-third grew up to lead healthy,
301.582	successful and productive lives.
308.476	In spite of everything and against
308.476	tremendous odds, they succeeded.
313.665	One-third.
315.948	Take this resume.
317.649	This guy's parents
317.649	give him up for adoption.
320.783	He never finishes college.
323.514	He job-hops quite a bit,
325.672	goes on a sojourn to India for a year,
328.801	and to top it off, he has dyslexia.
332.43	Would you hire this guy?
334.918	His name is Steve Jobs.
338.424	In a study of the world's
338.424	most highly successful entrepreneurs,
342.426	it turns out a disproportionate
342.426	number have dyslexia.
346.795	In the US,
	studied had dyslexia.
352.681	What's remarkable --
352.681	among those entrepreneurs
356.729	who experience post traumatic growth,
359.76	they now view their learning disability
363.063	as a desirable difficulty
363.063	which provided them an advantage
367.531	because they became better listeners
367.531	and paid greater attention to detail.
373.183	They don't think they are who they are
373.183	in spite of adversity,
378.294	they know they are who they are
378.294	because of adversity.
383.028	They embrace their trauma and hardships
385.406	as key elements of who they've become,
388.066	and know that without those experiences,
391.367	they might not have developed
391.367	the muscle and grit required
394.797	to become successful.
398.034	One of my colleagues
398.034	had his life completely upended
401.341	as a result of the Chinese
401.341	Cultural Revolution in 1966.
406.568	At age 13, his parents were relocated
406.568	to the countryside,
411.753	the schools were closed
414.078	and he was left alone in Beijing
414.078	to fend for himself until 16,
419.328	when he got a job in a clothing factory.
421.983	But instead of accepting his fate,
424.289	he made a resolution that he would
424.289	continue his formal education.
429.652	Eleven years later, when
429.652	the political landscape changed,
433.367	he heard about a highly selective
433.367	university admissions test.
438.383	He had three months to learn
438.383	the entire curriculum
442.287	of middle and high school.
444.605	So, every day he came home
444.605	from the factory,
448.786	took a nap, studied until 4am,
448.786	went back to work
453.499	and repeated this cycle
453.499	every day for three months.
458.394	He did it, he succeeded.
461.619	His commitment to his education
461.619	was unwavering, and he never lost hope.
467.281	Today, he holds a master's degree,
470.241	and his daughters each have degrees
470.241	from Cornell and Harvard.
475.478	Scrappers are propelled by the belief
478.179	that the only person you have
478.179	full control over is yourself.
483.647	When things don't turn out well,
485.667	"Scrappers ask, ""What can I do differently"
485.667	"to create a better result?"""
491.099	Scrappers have a sense of purpose
493.058	that prevents them
493.058	from giving up on themselves,
496.188	kind of like if you've survived poverty,
496.188	a crazy father and several muggings,
502.244	"you figure, ""Business challenges? --"
505.013	(Laughter)
506.069	Really?
507.481	"Piece of cake. I got this."""
509.681	(Laughter)
510.866	And that reminds me -- humor.
513.418	Scrappers know that humor
513.418	gets you through the tough times,
516.864	and laughter helps you
516.864	change your perspective.
520.151	And finally, there are relationships.
523.412	People who overcome adversity
523.412	don't do it alone.
527.349	Somewhere along the way,
529.19	they find people who
529.19	bring out the best in them
532.65	and who are invested in their success.
536.312	Having someone you can
536.312	count on no matter what
539.6	is essential to overcoming adversity.
542.862	I was lucky.
544.703	In my first job after college,
546.707	I didn't have a car, so I carpooled
546.707	across two bridges
549.861	with a woman who was
549.861	the president's assistant.
553.145	She watched me work
554.821	and encouraged me to focus on my future
557.822	and not dwell on my past.
560.668	Along the way I've met many people
563.661	who've provided me
563.661	brutally honest feedback,
567.336	advice and mentorship.
569.933	These people don't mind
571.794	that I once worked as a singing waitress
571.794	to help pay for college.
576.061	(Laughter)
577.331	I'll leave you with one final,
577.331	valuable insight.
580.915	Companies that are committed
580.915	to diversity and inclusive practices
585.912	tend to support Scrappers
588.04	and outperform their peers.
591.479	According to DiversityInc,
594.127	a study of their top 50
594.127	companies for diversity
597.969	outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 25 percent.
604.203	So back to my original question.
608.34	Who are you going to bet on:
610.449	Silver Spoon or Scrapper?
613.73	I say choose the underestimated contender,
617.539	whose secret weapons
617.539	are passion and purpose.
622.321	Hire the Scrapper.
624.413	(Applause)
