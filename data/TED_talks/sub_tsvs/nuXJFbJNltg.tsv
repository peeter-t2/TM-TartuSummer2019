25	I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.
32	Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.
36	Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner
40	with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,
44	and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.
48	We've got a climate crisis.
50	So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.
55	The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.
60	"She said, ""I agree with everything that's been said."
65	"I'm scared and I'm angry."" And then she turned to me and said,"
70	"""Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it."" Wow."
78	All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.
82	(Laughter)
87	I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,
92	"""There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."""
96	(Laughter)
97	And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate
103	this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,
111	we must act, and we must act decisively.
114	I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.
118	And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,
122	to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.
126	We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,
129	to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.
134	And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you
137	about what we've learned in those journeys.
140	Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.
143	You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,
145	and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity
148	like avian flu or personalized medicine,
151	we just get together the smartest people we know.
154	For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,
158	of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs
163	and business leaders. Fifty or so of them.
165	And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that
169	and four lessons I've learned in the last year.
172	The first lesson is that companies are really powerful,
176	and that matters a lot. This is a story about
179	how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.
182	Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is
187	the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.
193	They committed that they're going to take their existing stores
195	and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,
198	and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.
204	The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating
207	and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.
211	So, look what they did.
213	They painted the roofs of all their stores white.
216	They put smart skylights through their stores
218	so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.
222	And, third, they put the refrigerated goods
224	behind closed doors with LED lighting.
227	I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?
230	These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.
235	Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.
238	They're the largest private employer in America.
241	They're the largest private user of electricity.
243	They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.
247	And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,
254	it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
257	And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.
262	When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,
267	it has a powerful impact on other great institutions.
270	So, let me tell you this:
271	when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,
274	that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.
280	We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.
285	The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,
288	and they matter enormously.
291	I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?
293	Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.
296	That's a third of the U.S. population.
305	And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell
308	another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.
313	Consumers don't really like these light bulbs.
315	The light's kind of funny, they won't dim,
317	takes a while for them to start up.
319	But the pay-off is really enormous.
325	that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,
329	and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.
336	It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.
340	It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic
345	to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.
349	It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles
352	in Fiji and ship it here.
356	(Laughter)
358	It's hard to change consumer behavior
360	because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?
365	Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?
370	I don't know, and I should.
373	Those of us who care about all this would act better
375	if we knew what the real costs were.
378	But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,
381	as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?
386	I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes
390	we can reasonably expect from individuals
393	are going to be clearly not enough.
398	The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.
401	In fact, policy is paramount.
404	I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you
406	about that green tech network I described.
407	At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about
410	what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.
414	And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.
418	You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.
421	Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now
425	is to make it clear in Sacramento, California
429	that we need a market-based system of mandates
432	that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
437	It's necessary and, just as important,
440	it's good for the California economy.
442	So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met
445	with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
450	You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,
453	so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.
459	(Applause)
462	Please. Thank you.
466	I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?
467	Because California was the first state in this country
471	to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.
475	And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,
480	four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions
484	by 174 million tons a year.
489	California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.
494	It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,
497	but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.
502	In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.
506	Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.
510	"You know Tom Friedman says, ""If you don't go, you don't know""?"
513	Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.
517	He's the father of the ethanol revolution.
520	He told us that Brazil's government mandated
523	that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.
527	And they mandated that their new vehicles
530	would be flex-fuel compatible, right?
532	They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.
535	And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.
537	They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --
540	this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --
544	and in three years their new car fleet
546	has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.
551	Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.
554	And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.
559	So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced
566	That's 59 billion dollars since 1975
570	that they didn't ship to the Middle East.
572	It's created a million jobs inside that country,
575	and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.
579	That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.
583	But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.
587	So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.
594	In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have
597	are not going to be enough.
601	The fourth and final lesson we've learned
603	is about the potential of radical innovation.
605	So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem
607	and a breakthrough technology.
609	Every year a million and a half people die of
612	a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.
617	All for want of two dollars' worth of medications
619	that we can buy at the corner drugstore.
621	Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.
625	So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars
629	from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way
635	to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,
639	and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.
641	And in doing so, they'll save a million lives --
644	at least a million lives a year. A million lives.
647	Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.
651	This leverages millions of years of evolution
653	by redesigning bugs to make really useful products.
656	Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,
659	you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory.
664	Now, you may ask,
666	John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?
669	Well, I'll tell you -- a lot.
671	We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology
675	that they're using can be used to make better biofuels.
679	Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.
683	That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
687	and optimize them along the way.
690	So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats
695	that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.
702	I guess that's better living through bugs.
706	Alan Kay is famous for saying
708	the best way to predict the future is to invent it.
710	And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say
713	the second best way is to finance it.
715	And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars
719	in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies
722	for innovation in green technologies.
724	And we're encouraging others to do it as well.
726	We're talking a lot about this.
728	In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies
733	of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
738	But I'm really afraid we need much, much more.
744	For reference, fact one:
745	Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.
748	Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&amp;D?
752	Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy
756	is barely a billion dollars in total.
759	Less than one day of Exxon's revenues.
762	Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy
765	in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs
770	for the next thousand years. And the federal budget
774	calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&amp;D in geothermal energy.
779	It is almost criminal that we are not investing more
782	in energy research in this country.
785	And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.
790	So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.
793	Who would have thought that a mass retailer
795	could make money by going green? Who would have thought that
797	a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?
801	Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle
805	would come from a developing country in South America?
808	And who would have thought that scientists
810	trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?
815	And who would have thought that all that is not enough?
820	Not enough to stabilize the climate.
822	Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.
826	The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --
828	that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,
832	and do it as fast as possible.
833	Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,
836	but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,
840	and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will
842	to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China.
849	To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;
855	the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means
859	we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.
862	That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.
865	And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.
868	When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed
871	about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,
874	"""You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."""
879	"Then he asked, ""Why should China sacrifice our growth"
883	"so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"""
887	Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.
892	We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations
899	make the right outcome, the profitable outcome,
901	and therefore the likely outcome.
903	Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.
905	It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?
909	Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --
913	is bigger than the Internet.
914	It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.
918	Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be
920	the most important transformation for life on the planet since,
924	as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.
928	Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's
933	companies and individuals and policies and innovation
937	is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.
945	Everyone here cares about changing the world
948	and has made a difference in that one way or another.
951	So, our call to action -- my call to you --
955	is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.
962	What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.
968	Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com
972	and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,
977	lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.
982	There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed.
987	And the most important thing you can do, I think,
989	is to use your personal power and your Rolodex
991	to lead your business, your institution, in going green.
995	Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green
997	for its customers and its suppliers and for itself.
1002	Really think outside the box.
1004	Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google
1009	or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?
1014	It could be bigger than Wal-Mart.
1019	I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.
1025	And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,
1029	all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.
1044	Because if we do, I can look forward
1050	to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.
1054	(Applause)
