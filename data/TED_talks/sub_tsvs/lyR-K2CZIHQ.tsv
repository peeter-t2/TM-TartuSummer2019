13.912	On November 5th, 1990,
16.333	a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked
19.132	into a hotel in Manhattan
21.517	and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,
24.482	the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
28.28	Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,
30.94	but while serving time on lesser charges,
34.566	he and other men began planning attacks
37.16	on a dozen New York City landmarks,
39.051	including tunnels, synagogues
41.395	and the United Nations headquarters.
44.281	Thankfully, those plans were foiled
46.004	by an FBI informant.
48.841	Sadly, the 1993 bombing
51.397	of the World Trade Center was not.
54.578	Nosair would eventually be convicted
56.317	for his involvement in the plot.
59.741	El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.
63.988	I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
65.898	in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,
69.622	and a loving American mother
69.622	and grade school teacher,
72.817	who together tried their best
74.068	to create a happy childhood for me.
77.181	It wasn't until I was seven years old
78.723	that our family dynamic started to change.
82.266	My father exposed me to a side of Islam
85.416	that few people, including the majority of Muslims,
88.343	get to see.
91.06	It's been my experience that when people
92.729	take the time to interact with one another,
95.091	it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,
98.149	we all want the same things out of life.
100.601	However, in every religion, in every population,
103.778	you'll find a small percentage of people
106.366	who hold so fervently to their beliefs
109.324	that they feel they must use any means necessary
112.088	to make others live as they do.
115.684	A few months prior to his arrest,
117.545	he sat me down and explained that
119.547	for the past few weekends, he and some friends
122.666	had been going to a shooting range on Long Island
124.78	for target practice.
126.963	He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.
130.653	We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,
132.464	which unbeknownst to our group was being watched
134.979	by the FBI.
138.1	When it was my turn to shoot,
139.081	my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder
141.767	and explained how to aim at the target
143.212	about 30 yards off.
146.353	That day, the last bullet I shot
148.696	hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target
151.715	and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,
154.844	the entire target burst into flames.
158.818	My uncle turned to the other men,
160.719	"and in Arabic said, ""Ibn abuh."""
164.04	Like father, like son.
167.795	They all seemed to get a really
167.795	big laugh out of that comment,
170.402	but it wasn't until a few years later
172.182	that I fully understood what
172.182	they thought was so funny.
175.957	They thought they saw in me the same destruction
178.257	my father was capable of.
181.588	Those men would eventually be convicted
183.967	of placing a van filled with
183.967	1,500 pounds of explosives
187.94	into the sub-level parking lot of the
187.94	World Trade Center's North Tower,
192.089	causing an explosion that killed six people
194.93	and injured over 1,000 others.
198.31	These were the men I looked up to.
200.701	These were the men I called
200.701	ammu, which means uncle.
204.897	By the time I turned 19,
206.668	I had already moved 20 times in my life,
209.937	and that instability during my childhood
211.966	didn't really provide an opportunity
213.44	to make many friends.
215.321	Each time I would begin to feel
215.321	comfortable around someone,
218.474	it was time to pack up and move to the next town.
221.643	Being the perpetual new face in class,
223.822	I was frequently the target of bullies.
226.461	I kept my identity a secret from my classmates
228.771	to avoid being targeted,
230.089	but as it turns out, being the
230.089	quiet, chubby new kid in class
233.485	was more than enough ammunition.
236.002	So for the most part, I spent my time at home
238.199	reading books and watching TV
239.87	or playing video games.
241.639	For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,
244.509	to say the least,
246.759	and growing up in a bigoted household,
248.194	I wasn't prepared for the real world.
250.674	I'd been raised to judge people
252.393	based on arbitrary measurements,
254.46	like a person's race or religion.
258.203	So what opened my eyes?
261.354	One of my first experiences
262.948	that challenged this way of thinking
265.13	was during the 2000 presidential elections.
268.117	Through a college prep program,
270.151	I was able to take part
271.285	in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.
274.655	My particular group's focus was on youth violence,
277.586	and having been the victim
277.586	of bullying for most of my life,
279.937	this was a subject in which
279.937	I felt particularly passionate.
284.009	The members of our group came
284.009	from many different walks of life.
288.322	One day toward the end of the convention,
290.33	I found out that one of the kids I had befriended
293.418	was Jewish.
295.64	Now, it had taken several days
296.961	for this detail to come to light,
298.604	and I realized that there was no natural animosity
302.364	between the two of us.
304.609	I had never had a Jewish friend before,
307.665	and frankly I felt a sense of pride
310.474	in having been able to overcome a barrier
312.459	that for most of my life I had been led to believe
314.743	was insurmountable.
317.184	Another major turning point came when
319.2	I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,
321.722	an amusement park.
324.114	There, I was exposed to people
324.114	from all sorts of faiths and cultures,
327.01	and that experience proved to be fundamental
329.367	to the development of my character.
333.248	Most of my life, I'd been taught
334.508	that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,
338.254	that all gay people were a negative influence.
341.719	As chance would have it, I had the opportunity
343.98	to work with some of the gay performers
345.746	at a show there,
347.126	and soon found that many were the kindest,
349.66	least judgmental people I had ever met.
353.549	Being bullied as a kid
355.792	created a sense of empathy in me
358.08	toward the suffering of others,
359.626	and it comes very unnaturally to me
361.574	to treat people who are kind
363.542	in any other way than how
363.542	I would want to be treated.
367.57	Because of that feeling, I was able
369.505	to contrast the stereotypes I'd been taught as a child
373.892	with real life experience and interaction.
377.255	I don't know what it's like to be gay,
379.597	but I'm well acquainted with being judged
381.26	for something that's beyond my control.
385.236	"Then there was ""The Daily Show."""
388.971	On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me
391.243	to be intellectually honest with
391.243	myself about my own bigotry
394.922	and helped me to realize that a person's race,
397.239	religion or sexual orientation
400.335	had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.
404.978	He was in many ways a father figure to me
408.353	when I was in desperate need of one.
411.694	Inspiration can often come
411.694	from an unexpected place,
415.598	and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more
417.983	to positively influence my worldview
420.323	than my own extremist father
422.17	is not lost on me.
425.553	One day, I had a conversation with my mother
427.713	about how my worldview was starting to change,
429.883	and she said something to me
432.559	that I will hold dear to my heart
434.09	for as long as I live.
437.339	She looked at me with the weary eyes
438.81	of someone who had experienced
440.532	enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,
444.59	"""I'm tired of hating people."""
448.263	In that instant, I realized how much negative energy
451.14	it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.
455.979	Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.
458.88	I changed it when my family decided
460.915	to end our connection with my father
462.58	and start a new life.
464.942	So why would I out myself
467.1	and potentially put myself in danger?
470.5	Well, that's simple.
472.368	I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday
476.13	who is compelled to use violence
478.343	may hear my story and realize
480.704	that there is a better way,
483.201	that although I had been subjected
484.675	to this violent, intolerant ideology,
487.431	that I did not become fanaticized.
489.92	Instead, I choose to use my experience
492.557	to fight back against terrorism,
494.93	against the bigotry.
499.321	I do it for the victims of terrorism
502.109	and their loved ones,
504.291	for the terrible pain and loss
506.124	that terrorism has forced upon their lives.
509.325	For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out
511.693	against these senseless acts
514.225	and condemn my father's actions.
518.219	And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof
520.862	that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,
525.52	and the son does not have to follow
528.433	the ways of his father.
531.515	I am not my father.
534.305	Thank you. (Applause)
537.205	Thank you, everybody. (Applause)
540.864	Thank you all. (Applause)
543.504	Thanks a lot. (Applause)
