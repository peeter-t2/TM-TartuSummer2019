12.653	Hi. So today, I'd like to share
12.653	some works in progress.
15.953	Since we are still realizing these works,
18.17	we are largely working within the realm
19.921	of intuition and mystery, still.
22.026	So I'm going to try and describe
23.789	some of the experiences that we're looking for
25.916	through each of the works.
27.639	So the first work is called the Imperial Monochromes.
30.945	A viewer sort of unsuspectingly walks into the room,
33.94	and catches a glimpse of these panels
36.332	in a messy composition on the wall.
38.507	Within seconds, as if the panels have noticed
41.059	the presence of the viewer,
42.684	they appear to panic and sort of get into
45.728	a strict symmetry.
47.242	(Laughter)
48.985	So this is the sketch of the two states.
51.133	One is total chaos. The other is absolute order.
53.791	And we were interested in seeing how little change
56.142	it takes to move from one state to the other state.
59.798	This also reminded us of two
59.798	very different pictorial traditions.
63.528	One is the altar tablets of the 15th century,
66.081	and the other is about 100 years ago,
68.315	Malevich's abstract compositions.
71.271	So I'm just going to take you to a video.
73.287	To give you a sense of scale,
74.66	the largest panel is about two meters high.
76.875	That's about this much. 
76.875	And the smallest one is an A4.
79.693	So a viewer enters the space,
81.905	and they snap to attention.
84.001	And after a while, if the viewer continues
85.989	to remain in the space,
87.717	the panels will sort of become immune
89.705	to the presence of the viewer
91.418	and become lax and autonomous again,
94.453	until they sort of sense a presence
94.453	in the room or a movement,
97.828	when they will again snap to attention.
100.527	(Laughter)
102.006	So here it appears as if it's the viewer
104.405	that's sort of instigating the sense
104.405	of order among the panels,
107.65	but it could also be the other way around,
109.675	that the panels are so stuck within
112.019	their preconditioned behaviors
114.013	that they sort of thrust the
114.013	viewer with the role of a tyrant.
119.541	So this brings me to a quieter, small work
122.039	called Handheld.
123.608	The viewer sees a piece of paper
125.342	that's mounted on the far end of the wall,
127.812	but when you go closer, you see that it's a blank
130.44	A4, or a letter-sized piece of paper,
132.712	that's held on either side
134.029	by two small hands
135.97	that appear to be carved with a great deal
138.237	of attention and care from a small block of wood.
141.71	The viewer also sees that this entire sculpture
144.706	is sort of moving very slightly,
147.168	as if these two hands are trying
149.029	to hold the paper very still
150.531	for a long period of time,
152.71	and somehow are not managing to.
155.645	So this instability in the movement
157.618	very closely resembles the unsteady nature
161.136	of images seen through a handheld camera.
163.698	So here I'm going to show you two tandem clips.
166.386	One is through a still camera
167.806	and the other is through a handheld camera.
169.884	And you immediately see how the unsteady nature
172.485	of the video suggests the presence
175.544	of an observer and a subjective point of view.
178.031	So we've just removed the camera
179.86	and transferred that movement onto the panel.
182.141	So here's a video.
183.674	You have to imagine the other hand.
183.674	It's not there yet.
186.113	But to us, we're sort of trying to evoke
188.86	a self-effacing gesture, as if there's a little person
192.399	with outstretched arms
193.99	behind this enormous piece of paper.
196.492	That sort of likens it to the amount of strain
199.077	to be at the service of the observer and present
201.381	this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer
204.631	in front of them.
207.394	The next work is Decoy.
209.554	This is a cardboard model, so the object
211.342	is about as tall as I am.
213.246	It has a rounded body, two arms,
215.135	and a very tall, head-like antenna,
217.346	and its sole purpose is to
217.346	attract attention towards itself.
221.243	So when a viewer passes by,
223.029	it sort of tilts from side to side,
225.844	and moves its arms more and more frantically
228.017	as the person gets closer.
231.384	So here is the first test scenario.
233.908	You see the two movements integrated,
235.797	and the object seems to be employing
237.786	its entire being in this expression of desperation.
242.858	But the idea is that once it's
242.858	got the person's attention,
245.522	it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.
249.594	(Laughter)
252.708	So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.
255.74	It appears to be mass-manufactured
257.857	like it came out of a factory
259.559	like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
261.836	Because we are always working
263.339	from a very personal space,
264.747	we like how this consumer aesthetic
267.174	sort of depersonalizes the object
269.246	and gives us a bit of distance
270.977	in its appearance, at least.
272.897	And so to us this is a kind of sinister being
275.237	which is trying to distract you from the things
277.356	that actually need your attention,
278.951	but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
283.725	The next work is an object,
285.897	that's also a kind of sound instrument.
288.321	In the shape of an amphitheater
290.108	that's scaled to the size of an audience
292.048	as perceived from somebody from the stage.
294.114	So from where I'm standing,
295.728	each of you appears to be this big,
297.39	and the audience sort of takes the entire
299.443	field of my vision.
301.456	Seated in this audience are 996 small figures.
305.418	They're mechanically enabled to clap
307.604	of their own free will.
309.374	This means that each of them can decide
311.407	if and when they want to clap,
312.987	how hard, for how long,
314.619	how they want to be influenced by
314.619	those around them or influence others,
318.306	and if they want to contribute to innovation.
322.286	So when the viewer steps in front of the audience,
324.803	there will be a response.
326.487	It could be a few claps or a strong applause,
329.085	and then nothing happens until the viewer
331.269	leaves the stage, and again
331.269	the audience will respond.
334.345	It could be anything from a few feeble claps
336.67	from members in the audience,
338.352	or it could be a very loud ovation.
342.68	So to us, I think we're really looking
344.642	at an audience as its own object
346.939	or its own organism
348.655	that's also got a sort of musical-like quality to it,
352.405	an instrument.
353.785	So the viewer can play it
355.541	by eliciting quite complex and varied,
357.977	nuanced musical or sound patterns,
360.673	but cannot really provoke the audience
362.949	into any particular kind of response.
365.337	So there's a sense of judgment and capriciousness
368.081	and uneasiness involved.
370.322	It also has an alluring and trap-like quality to it.
374.431	So here if you see we're quite excited about
376.551	the image of the head splitting
376.551	to form the two hands.
380.373	So here's a small visual animation,
382.284	as if the two sides of the brain are sort of clashing
386.616	against each other to kind of make sense
388.643	of the duality and the tension.
391.178	And here is a prototype.
393.746	So we can't wait to be engulfed by 996 of them.
398.548	Okay, this is the last work.
398.548	It's called the Framerunners.
401.551	It comes out of the idea of a window.
404.07	This is an actual window in our studio,
406.381	and as you can see, it's made up of three
408.299	different thicknesses of wooden sections.
410.581	So we used the same window vocabulary
412.854	to construct our own frame or grid
415.681	that's suspended in the room and that can
417.623	be viewed from two sides.
419.436	This grid is inhabited by a tribe of small figures.
422.41	They're also made up of three different sizes,
424.975	as if to suggest a kind of perspective
427.401	or landscape on the single plain.
430.112	Each of these figures can also run backward
432.557	and forward in the track
434.122	and hide behind two adjacent tracks.
437.679	So in contrast to this very tight grid,
439.789	we wanted to give these figures a very comical
442.21	and slapstick-like quality,
444.299	as if a puppeteer has taken them
446.138	and physically animated them down the path.
448.879	So we like the idea of these figures
451.159	sort of skipping along
452.695	like they're oblivious and carefree
454.783	and happy-go-lucky and content,
457.331	until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer
460.531	and they will hide behind the fastest wall.
464.799	So to us, this work also presents
464.799	its own contradiction.
468.633	These figures are sort of entrapped
470.457	within this very strong grid,
472.604	which is like a prison, but also a fortress,
475.36	because it allows them to be oblivious
477.294	and naive and carefree and quite oblivious
479.999	of the external world.
482.568	So all these real life qualities that I talk about
485.373	are sort of translated to a very specific
487.655	technical configuration,
489.416	and we were very lucky to collaborate
491.459	with ETH Zurich to develop the first prototype.
494.627	So you see they extracted the motion cogs
496.892	from our animations and created a wiggle
498.982	that integrated the head-bobbing movement
500.936	and the back-and-forth movement.
502.704	So it's really quite small.
504.226	You can see it can fit into the palm of my hand.
506.518	So imagine our excitement when we saw it
508.329	really working in the studio, and here it is.
513.622	(Laughter)
517.259	Thank you.
518.807	(Applause)
