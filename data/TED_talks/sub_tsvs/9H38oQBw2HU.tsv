12.639	So this is a picture of my dad and me,
12.639	at the beach in Far Rockaway,
19.178	or actually Rockaway Park.
20.664	I'm the one with the blond hair.
23.354	My dad's the guy with the cigarette.
25.32	It was the 60's.
26.495	A lot of people smoked back then.
28.157	In the summer of 2009,
28.157	my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.
34.302	Cancer is one of those things
34.302	that actually touches everybody.
38.049	If you're a man in the US,
40.701	you've got about a one in two chance
42.771	of being diagnosed with cancer
42.771	during your lifetime.
45.73	If you're a woman, you've got
45.73	about a one in three chance
48.539	of being diagnosed with cancer.
51.025	Everybody knows somebody
51.025	who's been diagnosed with cancer.
55.355	Now, my dad's doing better today,
56.959	and part of the reason for that is that
56.959	he was able to participate in the trial
62.016	of an experimental new drug
62.016	that happened to be specially formulated
65.273	and very good for his particular
65.273	kind of cancer.
67.55	There are over 200 kinds of cancer.
70.66	And what I want to talk about today
72.944	is how we can help
72.944	more people like my dad,
75.84	because we have to change the way
75.84	we think about raising money
78.818	to fund cancer research.
81.273	So a while after my dad was diagnosed,
83.231	I was having coffee
83.231	with my friend Andrew Lo.
86.407	He's the head of the Laboratory
86.407	for Financial Engineering at MIT,
89.697	where I also have a position,
91.659	and we were talking about cancer.
93.285	And Andrew had been doing
93.285	his own bits of research,
95.703	and one of the things
95.703	that he had been told
97.821	and that he'd learned
97.821	from studying the literature
102.29	was that there's actually
102.29	a big bottleneck.
104.395	It's very difficult to develop new drugs,
106.559	and the reason it's difficult
106.559	to develop new drugs
108.943	is because in the early stages
108.943	of drug development,
111.388	the drugs are very risky,
111.388	and they're very expensive.
113.917	So Andrew asked me
113.917	if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,
116.814	work on some of the math and the analytics
118.948	and see if we could figure out
118.948	something we could do.
122.116	Now I'm not a scientist.
123.609	You know, I don't know
123.609	how to build a drug.
125.681	And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo
125.681	or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --
130.6	none of those guys are scientists either.
133.339	We don't know the first thing
133.339	about how to make a cancer drug.
136.828	But we know a little bit
136.828	about risk mitigation
139.051	and a little bit
139.051	about financial engineering,
141.191	and so we started thinking,
141.191	what could we do?
144.079	I'm going to tell you about some work
145.913	we've been doing
145.913	over the last couple years
148.022	that we think could
148.022	fundamentally change the way
150.317	research for cancer
150.317	and lots of other things gets done.
153.75	We want to let the research
153.75	drive the funding,
156.163	not the other way around.
158.446	So in order to get started,
159.764	let me tell you
159.764	how you get a drug financed.
161.911	Imagine that you're in your lab --
161.911	you're a scientist, you're not like me --
166.336	and you've developed a new compound
168.332	that you think might be therapeutic
168.332	for somebody with cancer.
172.212	Well, what you do is, you test in animals,
172.212	you test in test tubes,
175.892	but there's this notion
175.892	of going from the bench to the bedside,
178.976	and in order to get from the bench,
178.976	the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,
182.652	you've got to get the drug tested.
184.506	And the way the drug gets tested
186.134	is through a series of,
186.134	basically, experiments,
188.379	through these large,
188.379	they're called trials,
190.434	that they do to determine
190.434	whether the drug is safe
192.813	and whether it works and all these things.
194.85	So the FDA has a very specific protocol.
196.954	In the first phase of this testing,
198.669	which is called testing for toxicity,
198.669	it's called Phase I.
202.675	In the first phase,
202.675	you give the drug to healthy people
205.393	and you see if it actually
205.393	makes them sick.
208.578	In other words, are the side
208.578	effects just so severe
210.996	that no matter how much good it does,
212.808	it's not going to be worth it?
214.29	Does it cause heart attacks,
214.29	kill people, liver failure?
217.005	And it turns out,
217.005	that's a pretty high hurdle.
219.182	About a third of all drugs
219.182	drop out at that point.
221.663	In the next phase, you test
221.663	to see if the drug's effective,
224.546	and you give it to people with cancer
226.36	and you see if it makes them better.
228.115	And that's also a higher hurdle.
228.115	People drop out.
230.457	And in the third phase,
230.457	you test it on a very large sample,
233.287	and you're trying to determine
233.287	what the right dose is,
236.419	is it better than what's available today?
236.419	If not, then why build it?
239.891	When you're done with all that,
241.96	what you have is a very small
241.96	percentage of drugs
244.469	that start the process
244.469	actually come out the other side.
247.319	So those blue bottles --
247.319	those blue bottles save lives,
251.057	and they're also worth billions,
251.057	sometimes billions a year.
254.8	So now here's a question:
256.399	if I were to ask you, for example,
259.665	to make a one-time investment of, say,
263.654	to buy one of those bottles,
265.322	so 200 million dollars up front, one time,
265.322	to buy one of those bottles,
268.698	I won't tell you which one it is,
270.338	and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether
270.338	you have one of the blue ones.
274.263	Does that sound like a good
274.263	deal for anybody?
276.418	No. No, right?
277.68	And of course, it's a very,
277.68	very risky trial position,
280.238	and that's why it's very hard
280.238	to get funding,
282.404	but to a first approximation,
282.404	that's actually the proposal.
285.224	You have to fund these things
285.224	from the early stages on.
287.858	It takes a long time.
289.149	So Andrew said to me, he said,
292.59	"""What if we stop thinking"
292.59	about these as drugs?
295.06	What if we start thinking
295.06	"about them as financial assets?"""
297.87	They've got really weird payoff
297.87	structures and all that,
300.538	but let's throw everything we know
300.538	about financial engineering at them.
303.902	Let's see if we can use
303.902	all the tricks of the trade
306.386	to figure out how to make these drugs
306.386	work as financial assets.
310.344	Let's create a giant fund.
312.289	In finance, we know what to do
312.289	with assets that are risky.
315.057	You put them in a portfolio
315.057	and you try to smooth out the returns.
318.193	So we did some math, and it turned out
318.193	you could make this work,
321.26	but in order to make it work,
321.26	you need about 80 to 150 drugs.
324.716	Now the good news is,
324.716	there's plenty of drugs
326.905	that are waiting to be tested.
328.389	We've been told that there's a backlog
328.389	of about 20 years of drugs
332.346	that are waiting to be tested
332.346	but can't be funded.
334.823	In fact, that early stage
334.823	of the funding process,
337.244	that Phase I and preclinical stuff,
339.24	that's actually, in the industry,
339.24	called the Valley of Death
342.133	because it's where drugs go to die.
343.894	It's very hard to for them
343.894	to get through there,
346.172	and of course, if you can't
346.172	get through there,
348.423	you can't get to the later stages.
350.081	So we did this math,
350.081	and we figured out, OK,
352.157	well, you need about 80 to, say, 150,
352.157	or something like that, drugs.
355.767	And then we did a little more
355.767	math, and we said, OK,
358.577	well, that's a fund of about three
358.577	to 15 billion dollars.
361.863	So we kind of created a new problem
361.863	by solving the old one.
365.905	We got rid of the risk,
365.905	but now we need a lot of capital,
368.612	and you can only get that kind
368.612	of capital in the capital markets.
371.747	Venture capitalists
371.747	and philanthropies don't have it.
374.264	But we have to figure out
374.264	how to get people in the capital markets,
377.495	who traditionally don't invest in this,
377.495	to want to invest in this stuff.
381.011	So again, financial engineering
381.011	was helpful here.
383.353	Imagine the megafund starts empty,
385.177	and what it does is it issues
385.177	some debt and some equity,
389.21	and that generates cash flow.
390.964	That cash flow is used, then, to buy
390.964	that big portfolio of drugs that you need,
394.733	and those drugs start working their way
394.733	through that approval process,
398.07	and each time they go through
398.07	a phase of approval,
400.485	they gain value.
401.704	Most of them don't make it,
401.704	but a few of them do,
404.086	and with the ones that gain
404.086	value, you can sell some,
406.616	and when you sell them,
407.878	you have money to pay
407.878	the interest on those bonds,
410.24	but also to fund the next round of trials.
412.315	It's almost self-funding.
413.564	You do that for the course
413.564	of the transaction,
415.868	and when you're done,
415.868	you liquidate the portfolio,
418.321	pay back the bonds, and you can give
418.321	the equity holders a nice return.
421.667	That was the theory,
421.667	and we talked about it,
423.866	we did a bunch of experiments,
425.36	and then we said,
425.36	let's really try to test it.
427.552	We spent the next two years
427.552	doing research.
430.915	We talked to hundreds of experts
430.915	in drug financing and venture capital.
435.721	We talked to people
435.721	who have developed drugs.
437.997	We talked to pharmaceutical companies.
439.856	We actually looked at the data for drugs,
442.71	over 2,000 drugs that had been approved
442.71	or denied or withdrawn,
446.906	and we also ran millions of simulations.
450.23	And all that actually took a lot of time.
452.784	But when we were done, we found something
452.784	that was sort of surprising.
456.101	It was feasible to structure that fund
457.951	such that when you were done
457.951	structuring it,
460.067	you could actually produce low-risk bonds
460.067	that would be attractive to bond holders,
464.03	that would give you yields
464.03	of about five to eight percent,
466.794	and you could produce equity
468.283	that would give equity holders
468.283	about a 12 percent return.
471.002	Now those returns aren't going
471.002	to be attractive to a venture capitalist.
474.408	They want to make those big bets
475.965	and get those billion dollar payoffs.
477.995	But it turns out there are lots of other
477.995	folks that would be interested.
481.457	That's right in the investment sweet spot
481.457	of pension funds and 401(k) plans
485.06	and all this other stuff.
486.687	So we published some articles
486.687	in the academic press,
489.183	in medical journals, in finance journals.
494.022	But it wasn't until we actually
494.022	got the popular press interested in this
497.491	that we began to get some traction.
500.36	We wanted to do more
500.36	than just make people aware of it.
502.98	We wanted people to get involved.
504.584	So we took all of our computer code
504.584	and made that available online
507.721	under an open-source license
507.721	to anybody that wanted it.
510.433	And you guys can download it today
512.152	if you want to run your own experiments
512.152	to see if this would work.
515.303	And that was really effective,
516.812	because people that didn't
516.812	believe our assumptions
519.2	could try their own
519.2	and see how it would work.
521.375	Now there's an obvious problem, which is,
523.385	is there enough money
523.385	in the world to fund this?
525.684	I've told you there's enough drugs,
525.684	but is there enough money?
528.625	There's 100 trillion dollars of capital
530.555	currently invested
530.555	in fixed-income securities.
534.632	That's a hundred thousand billion.
538.32	There's plenty of money.
539.951	(Laughter)
544.088	But we realized it's more than
544.088	just money that's required.
546.855	We had to get people motivated, involved,
548.879	and get them to understand this.
550.775	And we started thinking about all
550.775	the different things that could go wrong.
554.334	What are all the challenges
554.334	that might get in the way?
557.22	And we had a long list.
558.464	We assigned a bunch of people,
558.464	including ourselves,
561.467	different pieces of this problem.
563.91	And we said, could you start
563.91	a work stream on credit risk?
566.745	Could you start a work stream
566.745	on the regulatory aspects?
569.414	Could you start a work stream
569.414	on how you would manage so many projects?
573.471	And we had all these experts get together
573.471	and do these different work streams,
577.167	and then we held a conference.
579.039	The conference was held
579.039	over this past summer.
581.293	It was an invitation-only conference.
583.097	It was sponsored
583.097	by the American Cancer Society
585.371	and done in collaboration
585.371	with the National Cancer Institute.
588.804	We had experts from every field
588.804	we thought would be important,
591.786	including the government, and people
591.786	that run research centers,
594.807	and for two days they heard the reports
597.268	from those five work streams,
597.268	and talked about it.
599.884	It was the first time the people
599.884	who could make this happen
602.746	sat across the table from each other
602.746	and had these conversations.
605.837	Now these conferences,
605.837	it's typical to have a dinner,
609.358	and at that dinner,
609.358	you get to know each other,
612.154	sort of like what we're doing here.
613.919	I happened to look out the window,
615.589	and hand on my heart,
616.909	on the night of this conference --
616.909	it was the summertime --
619.745	and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.
622.013	So I'd like to think it was a good sign.
624.082	Since the conference, we've got people
624.082	working between Paris and San Francisco,
628.307	lots of different folks working on this
630.2	to try to see if we can
630.2	really make it happen.
632.932	We're not looking to start a fund,
632.932	but we want somebody else to do this.
636.359	Because, again, I'm not a scientist.
638.553	I can't build a drug.
640.456	I'm never going to have enough money
640.456	to fund even one of those trials.
644.443	But all of us together, with our 401(k)s,
647.292	with our 529 plans,
647.292	with our pension plans,
649.884	all of us together can actually
649.884	fund hundreds of trials
652.791	and get paid well for doing it
654.399	and save millions of lives like my dad.
657.17	Thank you.
658.345	(Applause)
