27	I'm going to present
27	three projects in rapid fire.
29.405	I don't have much time to do it.
31	And I want to reinforce three ideas
31	with that rapid-fire presentation.
34.358	The first is what I like to call
34.358	a hyper-rational process.
37.358	It's a process that takes rationality
37.358	almost to an absurd level,
41.279	and it transcends all the baggage
43.208	that normally comes
43.208	with what people would call,
45.876	sort of a rational
45.876	conclusion to something.
48	And it concludes in something
48	that you see here,
50.31	that you actually wouldn't expect
50.31	as being the result of rationality.
55.07	The second --
57.79	the second is that this process
57.79	does not have a signature.
62.804	There is no authorship.
64.204	Architects are obsessed with authorship.
66.24	This is something that has
66.24	editing and it has teams,
68.748	but in fact, we no longer
68.748	see within this process,
71.135	the traditional master architect
72.689	creating a sketch
72.689	that his minions carry out.
76.739	And the third is that it challenges --
78.599	and this is, in the length of this,
78.599	very hard to support why,
82	connect all these things --
83.326	but it challenges the high modernist
83.326	notion of flexibility.
86.553	High modernists said we will create
86.553	sort of singular spaces that are generic,
90.217	almost anything can happen within them.
92.13	"I call it sort of ""shotgun flexibility"" --"
94.18	turn your head this way; shoot;
94.18	and you're bound to kill something.
97.365	So, this is the promise of high modernism:
99.464	within a single space, actually,
99.464	any kind of activity can happen.
102.711	But as we're seeing,
105	operational costs are starting
105	to dwarf capital costs
108	in terms of design parameters.
110.063	And so, with this sort of idea,
111.807	what happens is, whatever actually
111.807	is in the building on opening day,
115.089	or whatever seems to be
115.089	the most immediate need,
117.376	starts to dwarf the possibility
117.376	and sort of subsume it,
120.672	of anything else could ever happen.
122.624	And so we're proposing
122.624	a different kind of flexibility,
125.245	something that we call
125.245	"""compartmentalized flexibility."""
129.403	And the idea is that you,
129.403	within that continuum,
131.766	identify a series of points,
131.766	and you design specifically to them.
134.918	They can be pushed
134.918	off-center a little bit,
136.959	but in the end you actually
136.959	still get as much
139.096	of that original spectrum
139.096	as you originally had hoped.
142	With high modernist flexibility,
142	that doesn't really work.
145.463	Now I'm going to talk about --
146.929	I'm going to build up
146.929	the Seattle Central Library
149.262	in this way before your eyes
149.262	in about five or six diagrams,
152.067	and I truly mean this is the design
152.067	process that you'll see.
154.908	With the library staff
154.908	and the library board,
157.236	we settled on two core positions.
159	This is the first one, and this
159	is showing, over the last 900 years,
162.469	the evolution of the book,
162.469	and other technologies.
166.112	This diagram was our sort
166.112	of position piece about the book,
169	and our position was,
169	books are technology --
171.54	that's something people forget --
173.152	but it's a form of technology
173.152	that will have to share its dominance
176.338	with any other form of truly potent
176.338	technology or media.
180.13	The second premise --
181.306	and this was something
181.306	that was very difficult for us
183.821	to convince the librarians of at first --
185.811	is that libraries, since the inception
185.811	of Carnegie Library tradition in America,
189.618	had a second responsibility,
189.618	and that was for social roles.
192.525	Ok, now, this I'll come back
192.525	to later, but something --
195.137	actually, the librarians at first said,
195.137	"""No, this isn't our mandate."
198.368	Our mandate is media,
198.368	"and particularly the book."""
202.463	So what you're seeing now
202.463	is actually the design of the building.
205.557	The upper diagram is what we had seen
208.033	in a whole host of contemporary libraries
208.033	that used high modernist flexibility.
212.598	Sort of, any activity
212.598	could happen anywhere.
215.679	We don't know the future of the library;
215.679	we don't know the future of the book;
219.405	and so, we'll use this approach.
221.008	And what we saw were buildings
221.008	that were very generic, and worse --
224.212	not only were they very generic --
225.934	so, not only does the reading room
225.934	look like the copy room
228.7	look like the magazine area --
230.222	but it meant that whatever issue
230.222	was troubling the library at that moment
233.972	was starting to engulf every other
233.972	activity that was happening in it.
237.511	And in this case,
237.511	what was getting engulfed
239.784	were these social responsibilities
239.784	by the expansion of the book.
242.824	And so we proposed
242.824	what's at the lower diagram.
245.063	Very dumb approach:
245.063	simply compartmentalize.
248.174	Put those things whose evolution
248.174	we could predict --
250.651	and I don't mean that we could say
250.651	what would actually happen in the future,
254.258	but we have some certainty of the spectrum
254.258	of what would happen in the future --
258.168	put those in boxes designed
258.168	specifically for it,
260.442	and put the things that we can't
260.442	predict on the rooftops.
263.16	So that was the core idea.
264.431	Now, we had to convince the library
266.149	that social roles were
266.149	equally important to media,
269.839	in order to get them to accept this.
271.642	What you're seeing here is actually
271.642	their program on the left.
274.666	That's as it was given to us
274.666	in all of its clarity and glory.
278.727	Our first operation was to re-digest it
278.727	back to them, show it to them and say,
283.039	"""You know what? We haven't touched it,"
285	but only one-third of your own program
285	is dedicated to media and books.
288.411	Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --
290.384	that's the white band below,
290.384	the thing you said isn't important --
293.519	"is already dedicated to social functions."""
295.552	So once we had presented
295.552	that back to them,
297.757	they agreed that this sort
297.757	of core concept could work.
300.352	We got the right to go back
300.352	to first principles --
302.73	that's the third diagram.
303.964	We recombined everything.
305.194	And then we started making new decisions.
307.176	What you're seeing on the right
307.176	is the design of the library,
310.073	specifically in terms of square footage.
312.018	On the left of that diagram, here,
312.018	you'll see a series of five platforms --
317	sort of combs, collective programs.
319	And on the right are the more
319	indeterminate spaces;
321.429	things like reading rooms,
322.704	whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years
322.704	we can't predict.
325.413	So that literally was the design
325.413	of the building.
327.746	They signed it, and to their chagrin,
329.905	we came back a week later,
329.905	and we presented them this.
333	And as you can see, it is literally
333	the diagram on the right.
335.921	(Laughter)
336.946	We just sized -- no, really,
336.946	I mean that, literally.
339.4	The things on the left-hand side
339.4	of the diagram,
341.786	those are the boxes.
343	We sized them into five compartments.
343	They're super-efficient.
345.953	We had a very low budget to work with.
347.849	We pushed them around on the site
349.453	to make very literal
349.453	contextual relationships.
351.69	The reading room
351.69	should be able to see the water.
354.027	The main entrance should have
354.027	a public plaza in front of it
356.832	to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.
359.397	So, you see the five platforms,
359.397	those are the boxes.
361.874	within each one, a very discrete
361.874	thing is happening.
364.327	The area in between
364.327	is sort of an urban continuum,
366.698	these things that we can't predict
366.698	their evolution to the same degree.
370.49	To give you some sense
370.49	of the power of this idea,
373	the biggest block
373	is what we call the book spiral.
376	It's literally built
376	in a very inexpensive way --
378.358	it is a parking garage for books.
381	It just so happens to be on the 6th
381	through 10th floors of the building,
384.511	but that is not necessarily
384.511	an expensive approach.
387.81	And it allows us to organize
387.81	the entire Dewey Decimal System
390.66	on one continuous run; no matter how it
390.66	grows or contracts within the building,
394.555	it will always have its clarity
394.555	to end the sort of trail of tears
399	that we've all experienced
399	in public libraries.
401.753	(Laughter)
403	And so this was the final operation,
404.755	which was to take these blocks
404.755	as they were all pushed off kilter,
407.9	and to hold onto them with a skin.
410	That skin serves double duty,
410	again, for economics.
413	One, it is the lateral stability
413	for the entire building;
416	it's a structural element.
417.286	But its dimensions were designed
417.286	not only for structure,
419.937	but also for holding on
419.937	every piece of glass.
422.212	The glass was then --
422.212	I'll use the word impregnated --
425	but it had a layer of metal
425	"that was called ""stretched metal."""
428.436	That metal acts as a microlouver,
430.298	so from the exterior of the building,
430.298	the sun sees it as totally opaque,
433.703	but from the interior,
433.703	it's entirely transparent.
436.401	So now I'm going to take you
436.401	on a tour of the building.
439.871	Let me see if I can find it.
441.269	For anyone who gets
441.269	motion sickness, I apologize.
445.233	So, this is the building.
449.029	And I think what's important is,
449.029	when we first unveiled the building,
452.91	the public saw it as being
452.91	totally about our whim and ego.
457	And it was defended,
457	believe it or not, by the librarians.
459.866	"They said, ""Look,"
459.866	we don't know what it is,
461.914	but we know it's everything
461.914	that we need it to be,
464.303	based on the observations
464.303	"that we've done about the program."""
470.085	This is going into one of the entries.
472.093	So, it's an unusual building
472.093	for a public library, obviously.
479	So now we're going
479	into what we call the living room.
482.625	This is actually a program
482.625	that we invented with the library.
485.521	It was recognizing that public libraries
487.462	are the last vestige of public free space.
490.271	There are plenty of shopping malls
490.271	that allow you to get out of the rain
493.723	in downtown Seattle,
494.903	but there are not so many free places
497.854	that allow you to get out of the rain.
499.699	So this was an unprogrammed area where
499.699	people could pretty much do anything,
503.309	including eat, yell,
503.309	play chess and so forth.
505.442	Now we're moving up into what we call
505.442	the mixing chamber.
509.472	That was the main
509.472	technology area in the building.
512.424	You'll have to tell me
512.424	if I'm going too fast for you.
519.201	And now up.
525.566	This is actually the place
525.566	that we put into the building
528.219	so I could propose
528.219	to my wife, right there.
530.276	(Laughter)
533	She said yes.
534.183	(Laughter)
537.593	I'm running out of time,
537.593	so I'm actually going to stop.
540.198	I can show this to you later.
542	But let's see if I can very quickly
542	get into the book spiral,
545.307	because I think it's,
545.307	as I said, the most --
547.395	this is the main reading room --
547.395	the most unique part of the building.
551.768	You dizzy yet?
554.141	Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.
561.395	So, it's very indiscernible,
563.352	but it's actually
563.352	a continuous stair-stepping.
566.877	It allows you to, on one city block,
568.893	go up one full floor,
568.893	so that it's on a continuum.
576.491	Ok, now I'm going to go back,
576.491	and I'm going to hit a second project.
580	I'm going to go very,
580	very quickly through this.
582.287	Now this is the Dallas Theater.
583.991	It was an unusual client for us,
583.991	because they came to us and they said,
587.363	"""We need you to do a new building."
589.093	We've been working
589.093	in a temporary space for 30 years,
592.543	but because of that temporary space,
594.29	we've become an infamous theater company.
597.177	Theater is really focused in New York,
597.177	Chicago and Seattle,
600.162	with the exception
600.162	"of the Dallas Theater Company."""
603.283	And the very fact that they worked
603.283	in a provisional space
606.003	meant that for Beckett,
606.003	they could blow out a wall;
608.47	"they could do ""Cherry Orchard"" and blow"
608.47	a hole through the floor, and so forth.
612.236	So it was a very daunting task
612.236	for us to do a brand-new building
615.292	that could be a pristine building,
617.37	but keep this kind of experimental nature.
619.413	And the second is,
620.635	they were what we call
620.635	a multi-form theater,
623.537	they do different kinds
623.537	of performances in repertory.
626.167	So they in the morning
626.167	will do something in arena,
629	then they'll do something
629	in proscenium and so forth.
631.517	And so they needed to be able
631.517	to quickly transform
633.89	between different theater organizations,
635.84	and for operational budget reasons,
637.549	this actually no longer
637.549	happens in pretty much
639.736	any multi-form theater
639.736	in the United States,
642	so we needed to figure out
642	a way to overcome that.
644.499	So our thought was to literally
644.499	put the theater on its head:
647.346	to take those things
647.346	that were previously defined
649.68	as front-of-house and back-of-house
651.379	and stack them above house
651.379	and below house,
653.411	and to create what we called
653.411	a theater machine.
655.634	We invest the money
655.634	in the operation of the building.
658.141	It's almost as though the building
658.141	could be placed anywhere,
660.987	wherever you place it,
662.163	the area under it is charged
662.163	for theatrical performances.
664.917	And it allowed us to go back
664.917	to first principles,
667.263	and redefine fly tower, acoustic
667.263	enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.
670.869	And at the push of a button,
672.363	it allows the artistic director
672.363	to move between proscenium, thrust,
676.014	and in fact, arena
676.014	and traverse and flat floor,
679.829	in a very quick transfiguration.
682.248	So in fact, using
682.248	operational budget, we can --
685.694	sorry, capital cost --
685.694	we can actually achieve
687.91	what was no longer achievable
687.91	in operational cost.
690.898	And that means that the artistic director
692.875	now has a palette that he or she
692.875	can choose from,
695.264	between a series of forms
695.264	and a series of processions,
698.786	because that enclosure around the theater
698.786	that is normally trapped
701.934	with front-of-house and back-of-house
701.934	spaces has been liberated.
705	So an artistic director has the ability
705	to have a performance
708.293	that enters in a Wagnerian procession,
710.432	shows the first act in thrust,
712.791	the intermission in a Greek procession,
716	second act in arena, and so forth.
718.254	So I'm going to show you
718.254	what this actually means.
720.629	This is the theater up close.
722.421	Any portion around the theater
722.421	actually can be opened discretely.
727.515	The light enclosure can be lifted
727.515	separate to the acoustic enclosure,
731.437	so you can do Beckett
731.437	with Dallas as the backdrop.
735.146	Portions can be opened,
736.335	so you can now actually have motorcycles
736.335	drive directly into the performance,
740.002	or you can even just have
740.002	an open-air performance,
742.428	or for intermissions.
744.094	The balconies all move to go
744.094	between those configurations,
746.851	but they also disappear.
748.517	The proscenium line can also disappear.
751.129	You can bring enormous objects in,
752.994	so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --
755.009	their first show will be a play
755.009	about Charles Lindbergh,
757.684	and they'll want to bring in
757.684	a real aircraft.
760	And then it also provides them,
760	in the off-season,
762.635	the ability to actually rent out
762.635	their space for entirely different things.
769	This is it from a distance.
773.921	Open up entire portions
773.921	for different kinds of events.
776.933	And at night.
780.092	Again, remove the light enclosure;
780.092	keep the acoustic enclosure.
784.676	This is a monster truck show.
786.578	I'm going to show now the last project.
788.493	This also is an unusual client.
790	They inverted the whole idea
790	of development.
792.497	They came to us and they said --
792.497	unlike normal developers --
795.348	"they said, ""We want to start out"
796.909	by providing a contemporary
796.909	art museum in Louisville.
799.682	"That's our main goal."""
800.91	And so instead of being a developer
800.91	that sees an opportunity to make money,
804.529	they saw an ability to be
804.529	a catalyst in their downtown.
807.574	And the fact that they wanted to support
807.574	the contemporary art museum
811.178	actually built their pro forma,
812.759	so they worked in reverse.
814.431	And that pro forma led us
816	to a mixed-use building
816	that was very large,
819	in order to support
819	their aspirations of the art,
821.328	but it also opened up opportunities
821.328	for the art itself
823.899	to collaborate, interact
823.899	with commercial spaces
826.143	that actually artists more
826.143	and more want to work within.
829.356	And it also charged us
829.356	with thinking about how to have
832.405	something that was both a single building
834.393	and a credible sort of sub-building.
837	So this is Louisville's skyline,
839.567	and I'm going to take
839.567	you through the various constraints
842.271	that led to the project.
843.488	First: the physical constraints.
845.051	We actually had to operate
845.051	on three discrete sites,
847.476	all of them well smaller
847.476	than the size of the building.
850.381	We had to operate next to the new
850.381	Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.
854.088	We had to operate
854.088	within the 100-year floodplain.
856.41	Now, this area floods
856.41	three to four times a year,
858.749	and there's a levee behind our site,
860.51	similar to the ones
860.51	that broke in New Orleans.
863.687	Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,
867.913	a street that cuts through the middle
867.913	of these separate sites.
870.853	So we're starting to build a sort of
870.853	nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.
875.443	Underneath the bathtub
875.443	are the city's main power lines.
879.699	And there is a pedestrian corridor
879.699	that they wanted to add,
882.524	that would link a series
882.524	of cultural buildings,
885.498	and a view corridor --
885.498	because this is the historic district --
888.488	that they didn't want to obstruct
888.488	with a new building.
891.06	(Laughter)
892.124	And now we're going to add
892.124	1.1 million square feet.
895.125	And if we did the traditional thing,
895.125	that 1.1 million square feet --
898.364	these are the different programs --
900.06	the traditional thing would be to identify
900.06	the public elements, place them on sites,
904.048	and now we'd have a really
904.048	terrible situation:
906.247	a public thing in the middle
906.247	of a bathtub that floods.
910	And then we would size
910	all the other elements --
912.621	the different commercial elements:
914.3	hotel, luxury housing,
914.3	offices and so forth --
916.467	and dump it on top.
917.696	And we would create
917.696	something that was unviable.
920.684	In fact -- and you know this -- this
920.684	is called the Time Warner Building.
924.453	(Laughter)
926.151	So our strategy was very simple.
928	Just lift the entire block,
931.135	flip some of the elements over,
932.794	reposition them
932.794	so they have appropriate views
935.628	and relationships to downtown,
937.288	and make circulation connections
937.288	and reroute the road.
940.765	So that's the basic concept,
942.316	and now I'm going to show you
942.316	what it leads to.
945.916	Ok, it seems a very formal,
945.916	willful gesture,
948.495	but something derived entirely
948.495	out of the constraints.
951.067	And again, when we unveiled it,
951.067	there was a sort of nervousness
954.072	that this was about an architect
954.072	making a statement,
956.533	not an architect who was attempting
956.533	to solve a series of problems.
960.149	Now, within that center zone, as I said,
962.467	we have the ability to mix
962.467	a series of things.
964.646	So here, this is sort of an x-ray --
967.393	the towers are totally developer-driven.
969.352	They told us the dimensions,
969.352	the sizes and so forth,
971.826	and we focused on taking
971.826	all the public components --
974.347	the lobbies, the bars --
975.663	everything that different commercial
975.663	elements would have,
979	and combined it in the center,
979	in the sort of subway map,
982	in the transfer zone that would also
982	include the contemporary art museum.
985.742	So it creates a situation like this,
985.742	where you have artists who can operate
989.831	within an art space that also has
989.831	an amazing view on the 22nd floor,
993.733	but it also has proximity that the curator
993.733	can either open or close.
997.214	It allows people
997.214	on exercise bicycles to be seen,
1000.444	or to see the art, and so forth.
1002.143	It also means that if an artist wants
1002.143	to invade something like a swimming pool,
1005.887	they can begin to do their exhibition
1005.887	in a swimming pool,
1008.621	so they're not forced to always
1008.621	work within the confines
1011.282	of a contemporary gallery space.
1012.841	So, how to build this.
1014.032	It's very simple: it's a chair.
1016	So, we begin by building the cores.
1019.456	As we're building the cores, we build
1019.456	the contemporary art museum at grade.
1023.024	That allows us to have
1023.024	incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.
1026.114	This is not a high-budget building.
1027.839	The moment the cores get to mid level,
1029.712	we finish the art museum; we put
1029.712	all the mechanical equipment in it;
1032.931	and then we jack it up into the air.
1034.7	This is how they build
1034.7	really large aircraft hangars,
1037.213	for instance, the ones
1037.213	that they did for the A380.
1039.597	Finish the cores, finish the meat
1041.461	and you get something
1041.461	that looks like this.
1043.498	Now I only have about 30 seconds,
1045.1	so I want to start an animation,
1047.022	and we'll conclude with that.
1048.441	Thank you.
1049.853	(Applause)
1054	Chris asked me to add --
1056	the theater is under construction,
1057.8	and this project will start
1057.8	construction in about a year,
1060.548	and finish in 2010.
