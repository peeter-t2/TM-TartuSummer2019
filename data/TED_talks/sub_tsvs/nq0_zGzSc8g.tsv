12.495	There is an ancient proverb that says
16.053	it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room,
20.115	especially when there is no cat.
22.903	I find this a particularly apt description of science
26.232	and how science works --
28.368	bumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things,
31.688	trying to figure out what shape this might be,
33.99	what that might be,
35.434	there are reports of a cat somewhere around,
37.923	they may not be reliable, they may be,
39.716	and so forth and so on.
41.236	Now I know this is different than the way most people
43.212	think about science.
44.764	Science, we generally are told,
46.318	is a very well-ordered mechanism for
49.068	understanding the world,
50.369	for gaining facts, for gaining data,
52.655	that it's rule-based,
54.208	that scientists use this thing called the scientific method
57.449	and we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now,
60.288	and the scientific method is a set of rules
62.859	for getting hard, cold facts out of the data.
67.051	I'd like to tell you that's not the case.
69.146	So there's the scientific method,
70.978	but what's really going on is this. (Laughter)
73.297	[The Scientific Method vs. Farting Around]
74.255	And it's going on kind of like that.
77.359	[... in the dark] (Laughter)
78.78	So what is the difference, then,
83.321	between the way I believe science is pursued
87.137	and the way it seems to be perceived?
89.998	So this difference first came to me in some ways
92.713	in my dual role at Columbia University,
94.81	where I'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience
98.965	where we try to figure out how the brain works.
101.16	We do this by studying the sense of smell,
103.531	the sense of olfaction, and in the laboratory,
106.062	it's a great pleasure and fascinating work
108.696	and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs
111.567	and think up cool experiments to understand how this
114.178	sense of smell works and how the brain might be working,
116.564	and, well, frankly, it's kind of exhilarating.
119.366	But at the same time, it's my responsibility
122.084	to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain,
125.033	and that's a big subject,
126.108	and it takes quite a while to organize that,
128.499	and it's quite challenging and it's quite interesting,
131.31	but I have to say, it's not so exhilarating.
134.867	So what was the difference?
136.263	Well, the course I was and am teaching
138.332	is called Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience - I. (Laughs)
144.796	It's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts,
149.351	"it uses this giant book called ""Principles of Neural Science"""
153.668	by three famous neuroscientists.
156.002	This book comes in at 1,414 pages,
159.783	it weighs a hefty seven and a half pounds.
162.519	Just to put that in some perspective,
164.446	that's the weight of two normal human brains.
167.901	(Laughter)
171.184	So I began to realize, by the end of this course,
174.451	that the students maybe were getting the idea
176.699	that we must know everything there is to know about the brain.
179.73	That's clearly not true.
181.492	And they must also have this idea, I suppose,
184.19	that what scientists do is collect data and collect facts
187.571	and stick them in these big books.
189.66	And that's not really the case either.
191.067	When I go to a meeting, after the meeting day is over
194.37	and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues,
197.467	we never talk about what we know.
199.668	We talk about what we don't know.
201.834	We talk about what still has to get done,
204.119	what's so critical to get done in the lab.
206.944	Indeed, this was, I think, best said by Marie Curie
209.501	who said that one never notices what has been done
211.92	but only what remains to be done.
213.381	This was in a letter to her brother after obtaining
215.606	her second graduate degree, I should say.
219.324	I have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of Marie Curie,
222.137	because I am convinced that that glow behind her
224.44	is not a photographic effect. (Laughter)
227.178	That's the real thing.
228.978	It is true that her papers are, to this day,
233.358	stored in a basement room in the Bibliothèque Française
236.237	in a concrete room that's lead-lined,
238.434	and if you're a scholar and you want access to these notebooks,
241.086	you have to put on a full radiation hazmat suit,
243.835	so it's pretty scary business.
246.186	Nonetheless, this is what I think we were leaving out
248.982	of our courses
250.608	and leaving out of the interaction that we have
253.134	with the public as scientists, the what-remains-to-be-done.
256.107	This is the stuff that's exhilarating and interesting.
258.741	It is, if you will, the ignorance.
261.651	That's what was missing.
262.63	So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course
265.49	on ignorance,
267.59	something I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.
271.219	So I did start teaching this course on ignorance,
273.097	and it's been quite interesting
274.193	and I'd like to tell you to go to the website.
276.279	You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.
279.915	And it's been really quite an interesting time for me
283.438	to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk
285.279	about what it is they don't know.
286.827	"Now I use this word ""ignorance,"" of course,"
288.812	to be at least in part intentionally provocative,
291.97	because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations
294.36	and I clearly don't mean any of those.
296.365	So I don't mean stupidity, I don't mean a callow indifference
299.87	to fact or reason or data.
302.178	The ignorant are clearly unenlightened, unaware,
305.449	uninformed, and present company today excepted,
308.756	often occupy elected offices, it seems to me.
311.664	That's another story, perhaps.
313.47	I mean a different kind of ignorance.
315.103	I mean a kind of ignorance that's less pejorative,
317.371	a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge,
320.858	something that's just not there to be known
322.723	or isn't known well enough yet or we can't make predictions from,
325.544	the kind of ignorance that's maybe best summed up
327.862	in a statement by James Clerk Maxwell,
329.707	perhaps the greatest physicist between Newton and Einstein,
333.156	"who said, ""Thoroughly conscious ignorance"
335.457	"is the prelude to every real advance in science."""
338.025	I think it's a wonderful idea:
339.413	thoroughly conscious ignorance.
342.56	So that's the kind of ignorance that I want to talk about today,
344.981	but of course the first thing we have to clear up
346.5	is what are we going to do with all those facts?
348.603	So it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate.
352.277	We all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts,
355.087	this accumulation model of science, as many have called it,
359.123	and it seems impregnable, it seems impossible.
361.574	How can you ever know all of this?
362.888	And indeed, the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate.
366.469	In 2006, there were 1.3 million papers published.
370.123	There's about a two-and-a-half-percent yearly growth rate,
372.755	and so last year we saw over one and a half million papers being published.
377.145	Divide that by the number of minutes in a year,
379.375	and you wind up with three new papers per minute.
382.513	So I've been up here a little over 10 minutes,
383.995	I've already lost three papers.
385.771	I have to get out of here actually. I have to go read.
388.611	So what do we do about this? Well, the fact is
392.057	that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect, if you will.
396.566	We just don't worry about it, in a way.
399.23	The facts are important. You have to know a lot of stuff
401.473	to be a scientist. That's true.
403.283	But knowing a lot of stuff doesn't make you a scientist.
406.21	You need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer
408.875	or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter.
412.767	But in science, knowing a lot of stuff is not the point.
416.377	Knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get
419.933	to more ignorance.
421.321	So knowledge is a big subject, but I would say
423.831	ignorance is a bigger one.
426.318	So this leads us to maybe think about, a little bit
428.528	about, some of the models of science that we tend to use,
431.411	and I'd like to disabuse you of some of them.
433.236	So one of them, a popular one, is that scientists
435.549	are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together
438.177	to reveal some grand scheme or another.
440.95	This is clearly not true. For one, with puzzles,
443.508	the manufacturer has guaranteed that there's a solution.
447.007	We don't have any such guarantee.
448.756	Indeed, there are many of us who aren't so sure about the manufacturer.
451.911	(Laughter)
454.974	So I think the puzzle model doesn't work.
456.731	Another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things
460.245	the way you unravel the peels of an onion.
462.441	So peel by peel, you take away the layers of the onion
465.43	to get at some fundamental kernel of truth.
467.749	I don't think that's the way it works either.
469.936	Another one, a kind of popular one, is the iceberg idea,
472.87	that we only see the tip of the iceberg but underneath
475.33	is where most of the iceberg is hidden.
477.515	But all of these models are based on the idea of a large body of facts
481.069	that we can somehow or another get completed.
483.489	We can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is,
486.832	or we could just wait for it to melt, I suppose, these days,
489.437	but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg. Right?
492.664	Or make it manageable. But I don't think that's the case.
495.131	I think what really happens in science
497.53	is a model more like the magic well,
499.36	where no matter how many buckets you take out,
501.197	there's always another bucket of water to be had,
503.309	or my particularly favorite one,
505.436	with the effect and everything, the ripples on a pond.
508.375	So if you think of knowledge being this ever-expanding ripple on a pond,
511.502	the important thing to realize is that our ignorance,
514.884	the circumference of this knowledge, also grows with knowledge.
518.266	So the knowledge generates ignorance.
521.029	This is really well said, I thought, by George Bernard Shaw.
523.944	This is actually part of a toast that he delivered
526.621	to celebrate Einstein at a dinner celebrating Einstein's work,
530.298	in which he claims that science
531.712	just creates more questions than it answers.
531.712	"[""Science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating 10 more.""]"
533.977	I find that kind of glorious, and I think he's precisely right,
537.519	plus it's a kind of job security.
540.045	As it turns out, he kind of cribbed that
542.771	from the philosopher Immanuel Kant
544.623	who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea
547.268	of question propagation, that every answer begets more questions.
551.076	"I love that term, ""question propagation,"""
553.275	this idea of questions propagating out there.
556.014	So I'd say the model we want to take is not
557.901	that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together
561.41	and then we gain knowledge.
563.553	It's rather kind of the other way around, really.
565.932	What do we use this knowledge for?
567.839	What are we using this collection of facts for?
570.367	We're using it to make better ignorance,
573.224	to come up with, if you will, higher-quality ignorance.
576.303	Because, you know, there's low-quality ignorance
578.175	and there's high-quality ignorance. It's not all the same.
580.588	Scientists argue about this all the time.
582.958	Sometimes we call them bull sessions.
584.923	Sometimes we call them grant proposals.
586.841	But nonetheless, it's what the argument is about.
590.349	It's the ignorance. It's the what we don't know.
592.193	It's what makes a good question.
594.883	So how do we think about these questions?
596.513	I'm going to show you a graph that shows up
598.465	quite a bit on happy hour posters in various science departments.
602.332	This graph asks the relationship between what you know
606.553	and how much you know about it.
608.743	So what you know, you can know anywhere from nothing to everything, of course,
612.258	and how much you know about it can be anywhere
613.941	from a little to a lot.
616.364	So let's put a point on the graph. There's an undergraduate.
620.596	Doesn't know much but they have a lot of interest.
622.96	They're interested in almost everything.
624.651	Now you look at a master's student, a little further along in their education,
628.105	and you see they know a bit more,
629.456	but it's been narrowed somewhat.
631.346	And finally you get your Ph.D., where it turns out
634.065	you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing. (Laughter)
639.17	What's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that
642.951	because, of course, when it dips below the zero axis, there,
646.726	it gets into a negative area.
648.988	That's where you find people like me, I'm afraid.
651.903	So the important thing here is that this can all be changed.
655.271	This whole view can be changed
657.075	by just changing the label on the x-axis.
660.236	So instead of how much you know about it,
662.153	"we could say, ""What can you ask about it?"""
665.694	So yes, you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist,
668.561	but the purpose of knowing a lot of stuff
671.19	is not just to know a lot of stuff. That just makes you a geek, right?
673.777	Knowing a lot of stuff, the purpose is
675.915	to be able to ask lots of questions,
677.591	to be able to frame thoughtful, interesting questions,
680.679	because that's where the real work is.
682.404	Let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions.
684.956	I'm a neuroscientist, so how would we come up
687.119	with a question in neuroscience?
688.55	Because it's not always quite so straightforward.
691.219	So, for example, we could say, well what is it that the brain does?
693.778	Well, one thing the brain does, it moves us around.
695.592	We walk around on two legs.
697.597	That seems kind of simple, somehow or another.
699.448	I mean, virtually everybody over 10 months of age
702.173	walks around on two legs, right?
704.345	So that maybe is not that interesting.
705.736	So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.
708.884	How about the visual system?
711.659	There it is, the visual system.
713.286	I mean, we love our visual systems. We do all kinds of cool stuff.
716.534	Indeed, there are over 12,000 neuroscientists
719.925	who work on the visual system,
721.505	from the retina to the visual cortex,
723.586	in an attempt to understand not just the visual system
726.151	but to also understand how general principles
729.175	of how the brain might work.
731.126	But now here's the thing:
732.786	Our technology has actually been pretty good
735.266	at replicating what the visual system does.
737.856	We have TV, we have movies,
740.879	we have animation, we have photography,
743.374	we have pattern recognition, all of these sorts of things.
746.525	They work differently than our visual systems in some cases,
749.171	but nonetheless we've been pretty good at
750.762	making a technology work like our visual system.
754.238	Somehow or another, a hundred years of robotics,
757.174	you never saw a robot walk on two legs,
759.44	because robots don't walk on two legs
761.603	because it's not such an easy thing to do.
763.993	A hundred years of robotics,
765.521	and we can't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other.
768.888	You ask them to go up an inclined plane, and they fall over.
771.46	Turn around, and they fall over. It's a serious problem.
773.464	So what is it that's the most difficult thing for a brain to do?
777.011	What ought we to be studying?
778.634	Perhaps it ought to be walking on two legs, or the motor system.
782.929	I'll give you an example from my own lab,
784.664	my own particularly smelly question,
786.389	since we work on the sense of smell.
788.488	But here's a diagram of five molecules
791.716	and sort of a chemical notation.
793.226	These are just plain old molecules, but if you sniff those molecules
796.222	up these two little holes in the front of your face,
798.692	you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose.
802.566	If there's a real rose there, those molecules will be the ones,
804.724	but even if there's no rose there,
806.284	you'll have the memory of a molecule.
807.875	How do we turn molecules into perceptions?
810.979	What's the process by which that could happen?
812.836	Here's another example: two very simple molecules, again in this kind of chemical notation.
816.796	It might be easier to visualize them this way,
818.873	so the gray circles are carbon atoms, the white ones
821.667	are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms.
824.442	Now these two molecules differ by only one carbon atom
828.74	and two little hydrogen atoms that ride along with it,
831.428	and yet one of them, heptyl acetate,
833.414	has the distinct odor of a pear,
835.725	and hexyl acetate is unmistakably banana.
839.564	So there are two really interesting questions here, it seems to me.
842.121	One is, how can a simple little molecule like that
845.336	create a perception in your brain that's so clear
847.804	as a pear or a banana?
849.546	And secondly, how the hell can we tell the difference
852.667	between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom?
856.982	I mean, that's remarkable to me,
858.628	clearly the best chemical detector on the face of the planet.
861.66	And you don't even think about it, do you?
864.436	So this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us
867.053	back to the ignorance and the idea of questions.
868.799	I like to quote because I think dead people
870.818	shouldn't be excluded from the conversation.
873.361	And I also think it's important to realize that
875.3	the conversation's been going on for a while, by the way.
877.762	So Erwin Schrodinger, a great quantum physicist
880.52	and, I think, philosopher, points out how you have to
883.086	"""abide by ignorance for an indefinite period"" of time."
886.551	And it's this abiding by ignorance
888.538	that I think we have to learn how to do.
890.204	This is a tricky thing. This is not such an easy business.
893.181	I guess it comes down to our education system,
895.14	so I'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education,
897.597	because I think that's where it really has to play out.
899.865	So for one, let's face it,
902.132	in the age of Google and Wikipedia,
905.484	the business model of the university
907.277	and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change.
910.698	We just can't sell facts for a living anymore.
912.599	They're available with a click of the mouse,
914.649	or if you want to, you could probably just ask the wall
917.145	one of these days, wherever they're going to hide the things
918.857	that tell us all this stuff.
920.274	So what do we have to do? We have to give our students
923.157	a taste for the boundaries, for what's outside that circumference,
927.053	for what's outside the facts, what's just beyond the facts.
931.361	How do we do that?
933.518	Well, one of the problems, of course,
935.026	turns out to be testing.
937.135	We currently have an educational system
939.784	which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing.
943.493	So in second grade, all the kids are interested in science,
946.467	the girls and the boys.
947.73	They like to take stuff apart. They have great curiosity.
951.704	They like to investigate things. They go to science museums.
954.203	They like to play around. They're in second grade.
960.407	They're interested.
961.901	But by 11th or 12th grade, fewer than 10 percent
964.835	of them have any interest in science whatsoever,
967.91	let alone a desire to go into science as a career.
970.855	So we have this remarkably efficient system
973.837	for beating any interest in science out of everybody's head.
977.81	Is this what we want?
979.724	I think this comes from what a teacher colleague of mine
982.066	"calls ""the bulimic method of education."""
984.788	You know. You can imagine what it is.
986.161	We just jam a whole bunch of facts down their throats over here
989.109	and then they puke it up on an exam over here
991.463	and everybody goes home with no added intellectual heft whatsoever.
996.042	This can't possibly continue to go on.
998.123	So what do we do? Well the geneticists, I have to say,
1000.457	have an interesting maxim they live by.
1002.44	Geneticists always say, you always get what you screen for.
1007.692	And that's meant as a warning.
1010.553	So we always will get what we screen for,
1012.872	and part of what we screen for is in our testing methods.
1016.327	Well, we hear a lot about testing and evaluation,
1019.57	and we have to think carefully when we're testing
1021.757	whether we're evaluating or whether we're weeding,
1024.844	whether we're weeding people out,
1026.303	whether we're making some cut.
1029.437	Evaluation is one thing. You hear a lot about evaluation
1032.078	in the literature these days, in the educational literature,
1034.988	but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts
1037.946	to an opportunity for trial and error.
1040.1	It amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time
1044.594	with this kind of feedback.
1046.504	That's different than weeding, and usually, I have to tell you,
1049.442	when people talk about evaluation, evaluating students,
1052.168	evaluating teachers, evaluating schools,
1054.955	evaluating programs, that they're really talking about weeding.
1059.116	And that's a bad thing, because then you will get what you select for,
1063.326	which is what we've gotten so far.
1065.284	"So I'd say what we need is a test that says, ""What is x?"""
1068.725	"and the answers are ""I don't know, because no one does,"""
1071.817	"or ""What's the question?"" Even better."
1073.558	"Or, ""You know what, I'll look it up, I'll ask someone,"
1075.964	"I'll phone someone. I'll find out."""
1078.664	Because that's what we want people to do,
1080.214	and that's how you evaluate them.
1081.585	And maybe for the advanced placement classes,
1083.528	"it could be, ""Here's the answer. What's the next question?"""
1087.242	That's the one I like in particular.
1088.753	So let me end with a quote from William Butler Yeats,
1090.93	"who said ""Education is not about filling buckets;"
1094.097	"it is lighting fires."""
1096.25	So I'd say, let's get out the matches.
1100.125	Thank you.
1101.333	(Applause)
1104.56	Thank you. (Applause)
