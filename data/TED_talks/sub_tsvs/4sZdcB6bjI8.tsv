12.571	Raise your hand if you've ever
12.571	been asked the question
15.382	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
18.737	Now if you had to guess,
20.346	how old would you say you were
20.346	when you were first asked this question?
23.787	You can just hold up fingers.
25.999	Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.
30.656	Now, raise your hand if the question
35.356	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
37.402	has ever caused you any anxiety.
39.956	(Laughter)
41.61	Any anxiety at all.
45.342	I'm someone who's never
45.342	been able to answer the question
47.999	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
50.313	See, the problem wasn't
50.313	that I didn't have any interests --
53.773	it's that I had too many.
55.999	In high school, I liked English
55.999	and math and art and I built websites
60.474	and I played guitar in a punk band
60.474	called Frustrated Telephone Operator.
64.834	Maybe you've heard of us.
66.999	(Laughter)
69.323	This continued after high school,
71.252	and at a certain point, I began
71.252	to notice this pattern in myself
75.684	where I would become interested in an area
78.261	and I would dive in, become all-consumed,
81.444	and I'd get to be pretty good
81.444	at whatever it was,
84.999	and then I would hit this point
84.999	where I'd start to get bored.
90.046	And usually I would try
90.046	and persist anyway,
92.846	because I had already devoted
92.846	so much time and energy
95.767	and sometimes money into this field.
98.287	But eventually this sense of boredom,
100.614	this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,
100.614	this isn't challenging anymore --
105.418	it would get to be too much.
107.751	And I would have to let it go.
110.262	But then I would become interested
110.262	in something else,
112.787	something totally unrelated,
112.787	and I would dive into that,
115.999	and become all-consumed,
115.999	"and I'd be like, ""Yes! I found my thing,"""
120.285	and then I would hit this point again
120.285	where I'd start to get bored.
125.352	And eventually, I would let it go.
129.106	But then I would discover
129.106	something new and totally different,
132.198	and I would dive into that.
135.103	This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,
138.866	for two reasons.
140.46	The first was that I wasn't sure
143.316	how I was going to turn
143.316	any of this into a career.
146.353	I thought that I would eventually
146.353	have to pick one thing,
149.175	deny all of my other passions,
151.413	and just resign myself to being bored.
155.595	The other reason it caused me
155.595	so much anxiety
157.938	was a little bit more personal.
160.23	I worried that there
160.23	was something wrong with this,
162.972	and something wrong with me
162.972	for being unable to stick with anything.
167.677	I worried that I was afraid of commitment,
170.088	or that I was scattered,
170.088	or that I was self-sabotaging,
173.573	afraid of my own success.
177.261	If you can relate to my story
177.261	and to these feelings,
180.999	I'd like you to ask yourself a question
183.297	that I wish I had asked myself back then.
186.796	Ask yourself where you learned to assign
186.796	the meaning of wrong or abnormal
192.246	to doing many things.
195.741	I'll tell you where you learned it:
197.504	you learned it from the culture.
202.074	We are first asked the question
202.074	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
205.889	when we're about five years old.
207.481	And the truth is that no one really cares
207.481	what you say when you're that age.
211.198	(Laughter)
212.223	It's considered an innocuous question,
214.622	posed to little kids
214.622	to elicit cute replies,
217.006	"like, ""I want to be an astronaut,"""
217.006	"or ""I want to be a ballerina,"""
220.703	"or ""I want to be a pirate."""
222.61	Insert Halloween costume here.
224.584	(Laughter)
226.119	But this question gets asked of us
226.119	again and again as we get older
230.555	in various forms -- for instance,
230.555	high school students might get asked
234.456	what major they're going
234.456	to pick in college.
237.088	And at some point,
238.994	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
241.046	goes from being
241.046	the cute exercise it once was
244.428	to the thing that keeps us up at night.
247.137	Why?
249.049	See, while this question inspires kids
249.049	to dream about what they could be,
254.518	it does not inspire them to dream
254.518	about all that they could be.
257.954	In fact, it does just the opposite,
260.376	because when someone asks you
260.376	what you want to be,
263.416	you can't reply with 20 different things,
266.236	though well-meaning adults
266.236	will likely chuckle and be like,
269.155	"""Oh, how cute, but you can't be"
269.155	a violin maker and a psychologist.
273.231	"You have to choose."""
276.105	This is Dr. Bob Childs --
277.898	(Laughter)
280.999	and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.
284.835	And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor
284.835	turned illustrator, entrepreneur,
289.148	teacher and creative director.
291.119	But most kids don't hear
291.119	about people like this.
293.849	All they hear
295.999	is that they're going to have to choose.
299.418	But it's more than that.
301.403	The notion of the narrowly focused life
304.419	is highly romanticized in our culture.
307.218	It's this idea of destiny
307.218	or the one true calling,
311.422	the idea that we each have one great thing
314.203	we are meant to do
314.203	during our time on this earth,
316.56	and you need to figure out
316.56	what that thing is
319.467	and devote your life to it.
323.135	But what if you're someone
323.135	who isn't wired this way?
326.999	What if there are a lot of different
326.999	subjects that you're curious about,
330.428	and many different things you want to do?
333.246	Well, there is no room for someone
333.246	like you in this framework.
337.814	And so you might feel alone.
340.412	You might feel like you don't
340.412	have a purpose.
343.017	And you might feel like
343.017	there's something wrong with you.
346.758	There's nothing wrong with you.
348.908	What you are is a multipotentialite.
352.525	(Laughter)
354.999	(Applause)
362.312	A multipotentialite is someone
362.312	with many interests and creative pursuits.
367.852	It's a mouthful to say.
369.822	It might help if you break it up
369.822	into three parts:
372.696	multi, potential, and ite.
376.712	You can also use one of the other terms
376.712	that connote the same idea,
379.956	such as polymath, the Renaissance person.
382.946	Actually, during the Renaissance period,
384.914	it was considered the ideal
384.914	to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.
389.026	"Barbara Sher refers to us as ""scanners."""
392.214	Use whichever term you like,
392.214	or invent your own.
395.461	I have to say I find it sort of fitting
395.461	that as a community,
398.54	we cannot agree on a single identity.
401.026	(Laughter)
405.017	It's easy to see your multipotentiality
407.438	as a limitation or an affliction
407.438	that you need to overcome.
411.375	But what I've learned
411.375	through speaking with people
413.792	and writing about these
413.792	ideas on my website,
416.284	is that there are some tremendous
416.284	strengths to being this way.
421.656	Here are three
423.641	multipotentialite super powers.
427.384	One: idea synthesis.
430.584	That is, combining two or more fields
433.301	and creating something new
433.301	at the intersection.
437.633	Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew
437.633	from their shared interests
440.923	in cartography, data visualization,
440.923	travel, mathematics and design,
446.443	when they founded Meshu.
448.999	Meshu is a company that creates
448.999	custom geographically-inspired jewelry.
455.409	Sha and Rachel came up
455.409	with this unique idea
457.859	not despite, but because of their eclectic
457.859	mix of skills and experiences.
465.077	Innovation happens at the intersections.
468.797	That's where the new ideas come from.
471.519	And multipotentialites,
471.519	with all of their backgrounds,
474.702	are able to access a lot of these
474.702	points of intersection.
479.999	The second multipotentialite superpower
483.095	is rapid learning.
485.404	When multipotentialites
485.404	become interested in something,
488.29	we go hard.
490.369	We observe everything
490.369	we can get our hands on.
493.164	We're also used to being beginners,
494.931	because we've been beginners
494.931	so many times in the past,
498.077	and this means that we're less afraid
498.077	of trying new things
501.38	and stepping out of our comfort zones.
503.786	What's more, many skills
503.786	are transferable across disciplines,
507.839	and we bring everything we've learned
507.839	to every new area we pursue,
511.718	so we're rarely starting from scratch.
514.971	Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler
514.971	and freelance writer.
519.121	As a child concert pianist,
519.121	she honed an incredible ability
522.952	to develop muscle memory.
525.07	Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.
527.834	(Laughter)
529.322	Before becoming a writer,
529.322	Nora was a financial planner.
532.583	She had to learn
532.583	the finer mechanics of sales
534.813	when she was starting her practice,
536.583	and this skill now helps her
536.583	write compelling pitches to editors.
541.727	It is rarely a waste of time
541.727	to pursue something you're drawn to,
545.621	even if you end up quitting.
547.335	You might apply that knowledge
547.335	in a different field entirely,
550.663	in a way that you couldn't
550.663	have anticipated.
554.643	The third multipotentialite superpower
557.438	is adaptability;
559.309	that is, the ability to morph
559.309	into whatever you need to be
562.876	in a given situation.
566.295	Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director,
566.295	sometimes a web designer,
571.21	sometimes a Kickstarter consultant,
571.21	sometimes a teacher,
574.947	and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.
577.362	(Laughter)
579.076	He's valuable because he does good work.
581.568	He's even more valuable
581.568	because he can take on various roles,
584.853	depending on his clients' needs.
587.737	Fast Company magazine
587.737	identified adaptability
590.999	as the single most important skill
590.999	to develop in order to thrive
594.378	in the 21st century.
596.808	The economic world is changing
596.808	so quickly and unpredictably
600.047	that it is the individuals
600.047	and organizations that can pivot
603.842	in order to meet the needs of the market
603.842	that are really going to thrive.
609.615	Idea synthesis, rapid learning
609.615	and adaptability:
613.93	three skills that multipotentialites
613.93	are very adept at,
617.877	and three skills that they might lose
617.877	if pressured to narrow their focus.
625.181	As a society, we have a vested interest
625.181	in encouraging multipotentialites
629.661	to be themselves.
632.073	We have a lot of complex, multidimensional
632.073	problems in the world right now,
636.024	and we need creative,
636.024	out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.
641.81	Now, let's say that you are,
641.81	in your heart, a specialist.
646.498	You came out of the womb knowing
646.498	you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.
651.879	Don't worry -- there's nothing
651.879	wrong with you, either.
654.718	(Laughter)
655.782	In fact, some of the best teams
655.782	are comprised of a specialist
658.849	and multipotentialite paired together.
661.48	The specialist can dive in deep
661.48	and implement ideas,
664.538	while the multipotentialite brings
664.538	a breadth of knowledge to the project.
668.164	It's a beautiful partnership.
671.066	But we should all be designing
671.066	lives and careers
673.559	that are aligned with how we're wired.
676.092	And sadly, multipotentialites
676.092	are largely being encouraged
680.534	simply to be more
680.534	like their specialist peers.
684.621	So with that said,
687.124	if there is one thing
687.124	you take away from this talk,
690.219	I hope that it is this:
693.341	embrace your inner wiring,
693.341	whatever that may be.
697.687	If you're a specialist at heart,
699.879	then by all means, specialize.
701.902	That is where you'll do your best work.
704.624	But to the multipotentialites in the room,
707.628	including those of you
707.628	who may have just realized
709.969	in the last 12 minutes that you are one --
712.009	(Laughter)
713.638	to you I say:
715.814	embrace your many passions.
718.614	Follow your curiosity
718.614	down those rabbit holes.
722.643	Explore your intersections.
726.264	Embracing our inner wiring leads
726.264	to a happier, more authentic life.
732.028	And perhaps more importantly --
734.769	multipotentialites, the world needs us.
739.852	Thank you.
741.037	(Applause)
