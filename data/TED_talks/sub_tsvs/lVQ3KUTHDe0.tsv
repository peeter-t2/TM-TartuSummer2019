13.11	They told me that I'm a traitor
13.11	to my own profession,
17.77	that I should be fired,
19.322	have my medical license taken away,
21.961	that I should go back to my own country.
26.375	My email got hacked.
28.018	In a discussion forum for other doctors,
31.16	someone took credit
31.16	"for ""Twitter-bombing"" my account."
35.521	Now, I didn't know if this
35.521	was a good or bad thing,
38.044	but then came the response:
40.331	"""Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."""
44.569	I never thought that I would do something
46.6	that would provoke this level of anger
46.6	among other doctors.
50.369	Becoming a doctor was my dream.
52.574	I grew up in China,
53.875	and my earliest memories
53.875	are of being rushed to the hospital
57.243	because I had such bad asthma
57.243	that I was there nearly every week.
61.441	I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam,
61.441	who always took care of me.
64.517	She was about the same age as my mother.
66.556	She had this wild, curly hair,
68.626	and she always wore
68.626	these bright yellow flowery dresses.
72.027	She was one of those doctors who,
73.991	if you fell and you broke your arm,
76.11	she would ask you why you weren't laughing
78.427	because it's your humerus. Get it?
82.312	See, you'd groan,
84.054	but she'd always make you feel better
84.054	after having seen her.
87.546	Well, we all have that childhood hero
89.556	that we want to grow up
89.556	to be just like, right?
92.188	Well, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.
95.634	When I was eight,
95.634	my parents and I moved to the U.S.,
99.404	and ours became
99.404	the typical immigrant narrative.
101.668	My parents cleaned hotel rooms
101.668	and washed dishes and pumped gas
106.186	so that I could pursue my dream.
109.213	Well, eventually I learned enough English,
111.495	and my parents were so happy
113.026	the day that I got into medical school
113.026	and took my oath of healing and service.
118.35	But then one day, everything changed.
121.495	My mother called me to tell me
121.495	that she wasn't feeling well,
124.305	she had a cough that wouldn't go away,
124.305	she was short of breath and tired.
127.836	Well, I knew that my mother was someone
127.836	who never complained about anything.
131.467	For her to tell me
131.467	that something was the matter,
134.038	I knew something had to be really wrong.
136.359	And it was:
137.678	We found out that she had
137.678	stage IV breast cancer,
140.835	cancer that by then had spread
140.835	to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.
146.05	My mother was brave,
146.05	though, and she had hope.
148.214	She went through surgery and radiation,
150.195	and was on her third round of chemotherapy
152.574	when she lost her address book.
154.761	She tried to look up her oncologist's
154.761	phone number on the Internet
157.86	and she found it,
157.86	but she found something else too.
160.433	On several websites,
161.938	he was listed as a highly paid
161.938	speaker to a drug company,
165.493	and in fact often spoke on behalf
167.417	of the same chemo regimen
167.417	that he had prescribed her.
170.973	She called me in a panic,
172.57	and I didn't know what to believe.
174.288	Maybe this was the right
174.288	chemo regimen for her,
176.541	but maybe it wasn't.
178.822	It made her scared and it made her doubt.
181.972	When it comes to medicine,
183.682	having that trust is a must,
186.292	and when that trust is gone,
186.292	then all that's left is fear.
191.75	There's another side to this fear.
193.817	As a medical student, I was taking care
193.817	of this 19-year-old
197	who was biking back to his dorm
198.499	when he got struck and hit,
200.638	run over by an SUV.
203.166	He had seven broken ribs,
204.852	shattered hip bones,
206.225	and he was bleeding inside
206.225	his belly and inside his brain.
209.424	Now, imagine being his parents
211.208	who flew in from Seattle,
211.208	2,000 miles away,
213.368	to find their son in a coma.
215.764	I mean, you'd want to find out
215.764	what's going on with him, right?
218.771	They asked to attend our bedside rounds
220.689	where we discussed
220.689	his condition and his plan,
222.891	which I thought was a reasonable request,
224.888	and also would give us
224.888	a chance to show them
226.938	how much we were trying
226.938	and how much we cared.
229.389	The head doctor, though, said no.
232.29	He gave all kinds of reasons.
233.932	Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.
235.814	Maybe they'll stop students
235.814	from asking questions.
239.95	He even said,
241.387	"""What if they see mistakes and sue us?"""
245.595	What I saw behind every excuse
245.595	was deep fear,
248.777	and what I learned
248.777	was that to become a doctor,
251.499	we have to put on our white coats,
253.34	put up a wall, and hide behind it.
257.459	There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.
260.367	Of course, patients are scared
260.367	when they come to the doctor.
263.182	Imagine you wake up
263.182	with this terrible bellyache,
265.556	you go to the hospital,
266.742	you're lying in this strange place,
266.742	you're on this hospital gurney,
269.994	you're wearing this flimsy gown,
271.55	strangers are coming
271.55	to poke and prod at you.
273.709	You don't know what's going to happen.
275.554	You don't even know if you're going to get
275.554	the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.
279.532	But it's not just patients who are scared;
281.793	doctors are scared too.
283.66	We're scared of patients
283.66	finding out who we are
286.526	and what medicine is all about.
288.656	And so what do we do?
290.247	We put on our white coats
290.247	and we hide behind them.
293.253	Of course, the more we hide,
294.962	the more people want to know
294.962	what it is that we're hiding.
297.761	The more fear then spirals
297.761	into mistrust and poor medical care.
301.213	We don't just have a fear of sickness,
303.489	we have a sickness of fear.
307.33	Can we bridge this disconnect
309.316	between what patients need
309.316	and what doctors do?
313.135	Can we overcome the sickness of fear?
315.913	Let me ask you differently:
317.28	If hiding isn't the answer,
317.28	what if we did the opposite?
321.103	What if doctors were to become
321.103	totally transparent with their patients?
326.531	Last fall, I conducted
326.531	a research study to find out
329.272	what it is that people want
329.272	to know about their healthcare.
332.128	I didn't just want to study
332.128	patients in a hospital,
334.514	but everyday people.
335.965	So my two medical students,
335.965	Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,
339.137	literally took their research
339.137	to the streets.
341.532	They went to banks,
341.532	coffee shops, senior centers,
345.271	Chinese restaurants and train stations.
349.191	What did they find?
350.593	Well, when we asked people,
351.962	"""What do you want to know"
351.962	"about your healthcare?"""
354.388	people responded with what they want
354.388	to know about their doctors,
358.086	because people understand health care
359.883	to be the individual interaction
359.883	between them and their doctors.
363.864	"When we asked, ""What do you"
363.864	"want to know about your doctors?"""
366.787	people gave three different answers.
368.515	Some want to know
368.515	that their doctor is competent
371.308	and certified to practice medicine.
373.614	Some want to be sure
373.614	that their doctor is unbiased
376.02	and is making decisions
376.02	based on evidence and science,
379.418	not on who pays them.
381.544	Surprisingly to us,
383.104	many people want to know
383.104	something else about their doctors.
386.618	Jonathan, a 28-year-old law student,
389.25	says he wants to find someone
389.25	who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients
394.026	and specializes in LGBT health.
396.659	Serena, a 32-year-old accountant,
398.401	says that it's important to her
398.401	for her doctor to share her values
401.726	when it comes to reproductive choice
401.726	and women's rights.
405.634	Frank, a 59-year-old
405.634	hardware store owner,
407.815	doesn't even like going to the doctor
410.155	and wants to find someone
410.155	who believes in prevention first,
413.699	but who is comfortable
413.699	with alternative treatments.
416.803	One after another,
416.803	our respondents told us
419.143	that that doctor-patient relationship
419.143	is a deeply intimate one —
422.621	that to show their doctors their bodies
424.587	and tell them their deepest secrets,
426.555	they want to first understand
426.555	their doctor's values.
429.627	Just because doctors
429.627	have to see every patient
432.585	doesn't mean that patients
432.585	have to see every doctor.
435.17	People want to know
435.17	about their doctors first
437.388	so that they can make an informed choice.
440.792	As a result of this, I formed a campaign,
442.968	Who's My Doctor?
444.442	that calls for total
444.442	transparency in medicine.
447.302	Participating doctors voluntarily disclose
449.534	on a public website
450.927	not just information
450.927	about where we went to medical school
453.683	and what specialty we're in,
455.029	but also our conflicts of interest.
456.982	We go beyond
456.982	the Government in the Sunshine Act
459.446	about drug company affiliations,
461.883	and we talk about how we're paid.
464.887	Incentives matter.
466.431	If you go to your doctor
466.431	because of back pain,
468.618	you might want to know he's getting paid
468.618	5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery
472.447	versus 25 dollars to refer you
472.447	to see a physical therapist,
476.241	or if he's getting paid the same thing
476.241	no matter what he recommends.
480.549	Then, we go one step further.
483.247	We add our values
483.247	when it comes to women's health,
485.959	LGBT health, alternative medicine,
488.18	preventive health,
488.18	and end-of-life decisions.
491.191	We pledge to our patients
491.191	that we are here to serve you,
494.711	so you have a right to know who we are.
497.456	We believe that transparency
497.456	can be the cure for fear.
501.555	I thought some doctors would sign on
501.555	and others wouldn't,
504.266	but I had no idea of the huge backlash
504.266	that would ensue.
509.48	Within one week of starting
509.48	Who's My Doctor?
511.719	Medscape's public forum
513.23	and several online doctors' communities
515.26	had thousands of posts about this topic.
519.021	Here are a few.
520.288	From a gastroenterologist in Portland:
522.548	"""I devoted 12 years of my life"
522.548	to being a slave.
525.76	I have loans and mortgages.
527.707	I depend on lunches from
527.707	"drug companies to serve patients."""
531.985	Well, times may be hard for everyone,
534.251	but try telling your patient
535.972	making 35,000 dollars a year
535.972	to serve a family of four
538.986	that you need the free lunch.
542.708	From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:
545.041	"""I find it an invasion of my privacy"
545.041	to disclose where my income comes from.
549.639	My patients don't disclose
549.639	"their incomes to me."""
553.202	But your patients' sources of income
553.202	don't affect your health.
557.737	From a psychiatrist in New York City:
559.932	"""Pretty soon we will have to disclose"
559.932	whether we prefer cats to dogs,
563.351	what model of car we drive,
564.982	"and what toilet paper we use."""
567.434	Well, how you feel
567.434	about Toyotas or Cottonelle
570.168	won't affect your patients' health,
572.204	but your views
572.204	on a woman's right to choose
574.205	and preventive medicine
574.205	and end-of-life decisions just might.
578.501	And my favorite,
578.501	from a Kansas City cardiologist:
581.374	"""More government-mandated stuff?"
584.456	Dr. Wen needs to move
584.456	"back to her own country."""
588.535	Well, two pieces of good news.
590.145	First of all, this is meant to be
590.145	voluntary and not mandatory,
593.76	and second of all, I'm American
593.76	and I'm already here.
597.04	(Laughter) (Applause)
605.512	Within a month, my employers
605.512	were getting calls
608.241	asking for me to be fired.
610.633	I received mail
610.633	at my undisclosed home address
613.806	with threats to contact
613.806	the medical board to sanction me.
617.3	My friends and family urged me
617.3	to quit this campaign.
621.2	After the bomb threat, I was done.
624.823	But then I heard from patients.
626.765	Over social media, a TweetChat,
629.449	which I'd learned what that was by then,
631.377	generated 4.3 million impressions,
634.867	and thousands of people wrote
634.867	to encourage me to continue.
638.772	They wrote with things like,
640.404	"""If doctors are doing something"
640.404	they're that ashamed of,
643.53	"they shouldn't be doing it."""
646.121	"""Elected officials have to disclose"
646.121	campaign contributions.
649.175	Lawyers have to disclose
649.175	conflicts of interests.
651.96	"Why shouldn't doctors?"""
653.782	And finally, many people wrote and said,
656.51	"""Let us patients decide"
658.678	what's important
658.678	"when we're choosing a doctor."""
662.439	In our initial trial,
663.833	over 300 doctors have taken
663.833	the total transparency pledge.
668.289	What a crazy new idea, right?
670.841	But actually, this is not
670.841	that new of a concept at all.
673.822	Remember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,
675.614	with the goofy jokes and the wild hair?
678.413	Well, she was my doctor,
679.953	but she was also our neighbor
681.499	who lived in the building
681.499	across the street.
683.681	I went to the same school as her daughter.
686.007	My parents and I trusted her
688.267	because we knew who she was
688.267	and what she stood for,
690.663	and she had no need to hide from us.
693.551	Just one generation ago,
693.551	this was the norm in the U.S. as well.
697.221	You knew that your family doctor
697.221	was the father of two teenage boys,
700.697	that he quit smoking a few years ago,
702.542	that he says he's a regular churchgoer,
704.533	but you see him twice a year:
704.533	once at Easter
706.85	and once when his mother-in-law
706.85	comes to town.
710.492	You knew what he was about,
711.849	and he had no need to hide from you.
714.837	But the sickness of fear has taken over,
717.168	and patients suffer the consequences.
719.859	I know this firsthand.
722.13	My mother fought
722.13	her cancer for eight years.
725.07	She was a planner,
726.238	and she thought a lot
726.238	about how she wanted to live
728.623	and how she wanted to die.
730.53	Not only did she sign advance directives,
733.101	she wrote a 12-page document
733.101	about how she had suffered enough,
736.951	how it was time for her to go.
739.867	One day, when I was a resident physician,
741.901	I got a call to say that she was
741.901	in the intensive care unit.
745.92	By the time I got there,
745.92	she was about to be intubated
749.36	and put on a breathing machine.
751.905	"""But this is not what she wants,"""
751.905	"I said, ""and we have documents."""
756.145	The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,
758.891	pointed at my then 16-year-old
758.891	sister, and said,
763.043	"""Do you remember when you were that age?"
765.201	How would you have liked to grow up
765.201	"without your mother?"""
769.568	Her oncologist was there too, and said,
772.238	"""This is your mother."
774.177	Can you really face yourself
774.177	for the rest of your life
776.83	"if you don't do everything for her?"""
780.375	I knew my mother so well.
782.435	I understood what
782.435	her directives meant so well,
785.595	but I was a physician.
789.413	That was the single hardest
789.413	decision I ever made,
793.884	to let her die in peace,
796.933	and I carry those words
796.933	of those doctors with me
799.633	every single day.
803.142	We can bridge the disconnect
805.356	between what doctors do
805.356	and what patients need.
810.157	We can get there,
810.157	because we've been there before,
812.838	and we know that transparency
812.838	gets us to that trust.
815.331	Research has shown us
815.331	that openness also helps doctors,
818.096	that having open medical records,
819.702	being willing to talk
819.702	about medical errors,
821.739	will increase patient trust,
823.429	improve health outcomes,
825.15	and reduce malpractice.
827.21	That openness, that trust,
828.749	is only going to be more important
830.423	as we move from the infectious
830.423	to the behavioral model of disease.
834.013	Bacteria may not care so much
834.013	about trust and intimacy,
837.487	but for people to tackle
837.487	the hard lifestyle choices,
841.43	to address issues like smoking cessation,
843.728	blood-pressure management
843.728	and diabetes control,
846.765	well, that requires us to establish trust.
851.003	Here's what other transparent
851.003	doctors have said.
853.873	Brandon Combs, an internist in Denver:
856.79	"""This has brought me"
856.79	closer to my patients.
859.803	The type of relationship I've developed —
862.547	"that's why I entered medicine."""
866.117	Aaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:
868.79	"""I tell my patients"
868.79	that I am totally open with them.
872.286	I don't hide anything from them.
874.36	This is me. Now tell me about you.
877.286	"We're in this together."""
879.518	May Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:
881.92	"""My colleagues are astounded"
881.92	by what I'm doing.
885.998	They ask me how I could be so brave.
888.584	I said, I'm not being brave,
891.552	"it's my job."""
895.024	I leave you today with a final thought.
898.428	Being totally transparent is scary.
901.772	You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,
905.102	but that vulnerability, that humility,
908.74	it can be an extraordinary benefit
908.74	to the practice of medicine.
913.256	When doctors are willing
913.256	to step off our pedestals,
915.664	take off our white coats,
917.14	and show our patients who we are
917.14	and what medicine is all about,
920.521	that's when we begin
920.521	to overcome the sickness of fear.
923.786	That's when we establish trust.
925.715	That's when we change
925.715	the paradigm of medicine
928.175	from one of secrecy and hiding
929.985	to one that is fully open and engaged
932.344	for our patients.
935.027	Thank you.
936.924	(Applause)
