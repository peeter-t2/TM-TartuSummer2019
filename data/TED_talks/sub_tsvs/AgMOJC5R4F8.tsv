13.04	What do augmented reality
15.198	and professional football
16.604	have to do with empathy?
18.798	And what is the air speed velocity
20.983	of an unladen swallow?
23.158	Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer
25.778	one of those questions today,
26.895	so please, try and contain your disappointment.
29.186	When most people think about augmented reality,
31.658	"they think about ""Minority Report"" and Tom Cruise"
34.063	waving his hands in the air,
35.973	but augmented reality is not science fiction.
39.232	Augmented reality is something that will happen
41.507	in our lifetime, and it will happen
43.711	because we have the tools to make it happen,
45.422	and people need to be aware of that,
47.205	because augmented reality will change our lives
49.686	just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
53.469	Now how do we get to augmented reality?
56.07	Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,
58.126	Google Glass.
59.53	I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.
62.15	What you may not be familiar with
63.597	is that Google Glass is a device
66.037	that will allow you to see what I see.
69.679	It will allow you to experience what it is like
71.695	to be a professional athlete on the field.
73.991	Right now, the only way you can be on the field
77.512	is for me to try and describe it to you.
79.288	I have to use words.
80.799	I have to create a framework that you then fill in
83.147	with your imagination.
85.098	With Google Glass, we can put that
89.275	underneath a helmet,
90.885	and we can get a sense of what it's like
93.031	to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,
96.13	your blood pounding in your ears.
98.203	You can get a sense of what it's like
100.11	to have a 250-pound man
102.997	sprinting at you
104.658	trying to decapitate you
106.634	with every ounce of his being.
108.465	And I've been on the receiving end of that,
109.851	and it doesn't feel very good.
111.408	Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like
113.987	to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet
115.914	to give you a taste of that.
117.148	Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage
120.059	because the NFL thinks emergent technology
122.474	is what happens when a submarine surfaces,
124.722	but — (Laughter) — we do what we can.
128.685	So let's pull up some video.
132.16	(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.
139.292	Ugh, getting tackled sucks.
141.429	Hold on, let's get a little closer.
144.387	All right, ready?
145.765	Go!
149.881	Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,
151.459	small taste of what it's like to get tackled
153.726	on the football field
154.848	from the perspective of the tacklee.
156.727	Now, you may have noticed there are
157.98	some people missing there:
159.075	the rest of the team.
160.901	We have some video of that
162.641	courtesy of the University of Washington.
164.145	(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!
168.501	Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!
172.416	Oh!
176.155	CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer
178.076	to what it's like to be on that field,
180.026	but this is nowhere what it's like
181.999	to be on the NFL.
184.437	Fans want that experience.
186.198	Fans want to be on that field.
187.442	They want to be their favorite players,
189.606	and they've already talked to me on YouTube,
192.338	they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,
193.414	"""Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?"
195.362	Can you get this on a running back?
196.554	"We want that experience."""
198.147	Well, once we have that experience with GoPro
200.292	and Google Glass,
201.615	how do we make it more immersive?
203.006	How do we take that next step?
204.201	Well, we take that step
206.12	by going to something called the Oculus Rift,
208.789	which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.
210.896	The Oculus Rift has been described as one of
212.883	the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,
215.79	and that is not empty hype.
217.273	I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype
219.433	with this video.
223.665	(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!
228.524	No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!
233.391	Oh my God! Aaaah!
237.952	CK: So that is the experience of a man
241.237	on a roller coaster
243.251	in fear of his life.
246.03	What do you think that fan's experience
248.702	is going to be when we take the video footage
250.663	of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,
253.775	shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm
255.513	before sprinting in for a touchdown?
257.607	What do you think that fan's experience
259	is going to be when he's Messi
261.156	sprinting down the pitch
262.376	putting the ball in the back of the net,
263.878	or Federer serving in Wimbledon?
266.16	What do you think his experience is going to be
268.492	when he is going down the side of a mountain
270.43	at over 70 miles an hour
272.207	as an Olympic downhill skier?
275.226	I think adult diaper sales may surge.
277.551	(Laughter)
278.46	But this is not yet augmented reality.
281.391	This is only virtual reality, V.R.
283.307	How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?
285.721	We get to augmented reality
287.83	when coaches and managers and owners
290.403	look at this information streaming in
292.557	that people want to see, and they say,
293.943	"""How do we use this to make our teams better?"
296.915	"How do we use this to win games?"""
298.94	Because teams always use technology to win games.
301.402	They like winning. It makes them money.
303.18	So a brief history of technology in the NFL.
306.156	In 1965, the Baltimore Colts
308.167	put a wristband on their quarterback
309.82	to allow him to call plays quicker.
312.114	They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.
313.518	Other teams followed suit.
315.113	More people watched the game
315.113	because it was more exciting.
317.276	It was faster.
318.73	In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios
322.13	into the helmets of the quarterbacks,
324.057	and later the defense.
325.301	More people watched games because it was faster.
327.69	It was more entertaining.
329.356	In 2023, imagine you're a player
332.469	walking back to the huddle,
333.92	and you have your next play displayed
336.26	right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor
339.226	that you already wear right now.
341.468	No more having to worry about forgetting plays.
343.335	No more worrying about having
343.335	to memorize your playbook.
345.996	You just go out and react.
347.923	And coaches really want this,
349.371	because missed assignments lose you games,
351.924	and coaches hate losing games.
353.98	Losing games gets you fired as a coach.
356.237	They don't want that.
358.024	But augmented reality is not just
360.667	an enhanced playbook.
362.331	Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data
365.635	and use it in real time
367.18	to enhance how you play the game.
369.773	What would that be like?
371.83	Well, a very simple setup would be a camera
374.385	on each corner of the stadium looking down,
376.04	giving you a bird's-eye view
377.304	of all the people down there.
378.858	You also have information from helmet sensors
381.432	and accelerometers,
382.54	technology that's being worked on right now.
385.473	You take all that information,
385.473	and you stream it to your players.
388.032	The good teams stream it in a
388.032	way that the players can use.
390.226	The bad ones have information overload.
392.208	That determines good teams from bad.
394.264	And now, your I.T. department
397.01	is just as important as your scouting department,
399.582	and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.
402.167	It's also for jocks. Who knew?
404.598	What would that look like on the field?
406.474	Well, imagine you're the quarterback.
408.583	You take the snap and you drop back.
410.077	You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.
412.124	All of a sudden, a bright flash
414.291	on the left side of your visor lets you know,
415.975	blind side linebacker is blitzing in.
418.246	Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,
419.722	but the augmented reality system lets you know.
421.963	You step up into the pocket.
423.132	Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.
425.258	You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
427.556	The ball comes off track.
429.325	You don't know where it's going to land.
430.783	However, on the receiver's visor,
432.361	he sees a patch of grass light up,
434.494	and he knows to readjust.
436.29	He goes, catches the ball,
437.519	sprints in, touchdown.
439.047	Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him
440.973	every step of the way,
442.314	watching from every perspective.
444.498	Now this is something that will create
447.378	massive excitement in the game.
449.184	It will make tons of people watch,
451.452	because people want this experience.
453.843	Fans want to be on the field.
455.669	They want to be their favorite player.
457.932	Augmented reality will be a part of sports,
460.05	because it's too profitable not to.
462.496	But the question I ask you is,
465.395	is that's all that we're content
465.395	to use augmented reality for?
468.746	Are we going to use it solely for our panem,
471.454	our circenses, our entertainment as normal?
473.902	Because I believe that we can use augmented reality
476.718	for something more.
478.119	I believe we can use augmented reality
480.286	as a way to foster more empathy
482.279	within the human species itself,
484.583	by literally showing someone
486.245	what it looks like
487.684	to walk a mile in another person's shoes.
490.97	We know what this technology is worth
492.712	to sports leagues.
493.93	It's worth revenue, to the tune
493.93	of billions of dollars a year.
497.158	But what is this technology worth
499.208	to a teacher in a classroom
501.08	trying to show a bully
502.516	just how harmful his actions are
504.232	from the perspective of the victim?
506.839	What is this technology worth
508.485	to a gay Ugandan or Russian
510.417	trying to show the world what it's like
512.04	living under persecution?
513.79	What is this technology worth
515.723	to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson
519.297	trying to inspire a generation of children
522.04	to think more about space and science
524.806	instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?
528.511	Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality
531.256	is coming.
533.426	The questions we ask, the choices we make,
537.264	and the challenges we face
538.897	are, as always, up to us.
541.267	Thank you.
543.02	(Applause)
