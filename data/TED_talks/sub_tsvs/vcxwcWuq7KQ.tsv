12.72	Code is the next universal language.
16.68	In the seventies, it was punk music
16.68	that drove the whole generation.
20.88	In the eighties, it was probably money.
23.36	But for my generation of people,
25.72	software is the interface
25.72	to our imagination and our world.
30.56	And that means that we need
32.28	a radically, radically
32.28	more diverse set of people
35.56	to build those products,
37.36	to not see computers as mechanical
37.36	and lonely and boring and magic,
42.32	to see them as things
42.32	that they can tinker
44.32	and turn around and twist,
44.32	and so forth.
47.72	My personal journey into the world
47.72	of programming and technology
51.52	started at the tender age of 14.
54.52	I had this mad teenage crush
54.52	on an older man,
58.64	and the older man in question
58.64	just happened to be
61	the then Vice President
61	of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.
65.44	And I did what every single
65.44	teenage girl would want to do.
68.52	I wanted to somehow
68.52	express all of this love,
70.76	so I built him a website, it's over here.
73.36	And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,
76.319	there was no Facebook,
76.319	there was no Pinterest.
78.6	So I needed to learn to code
80.76	in order to express
80.76	all of this longing and loving.
84.16	And that is how programming
84.16	started for me.
86.52	It started as a means of self-expression.
89.08	Just like when I was smaller,
89.08	I would use crayons and legos.
92.72	And when I was older, I would use
92.72	guitar lessons and theater plays.
97.92	But then, there were other things
97.92	to get excited about,
100.92	like poetry and knitting socks
103.36	and conjugating French irregular verbs
106.68	and coming up with make-believe worlds
108.56	and Bertrand Russell and his philosophy.
111.72	And I started to be one of those people
113.64	who felt that computers
113.64	are boring and technical and lonely.
118.12	Here's what I think today.
119.96	Little girls don't know that they
119.96	are not supposed to like computers.
124.04	Little girls are amazing.
125.32	They are really, really good
125.32	at concentrating on things
129.48	and being exact and they ask
129.48	amazing questions like,
132.76	"""What?"" and ""Why?"""
132.76	"and ""How?"" and ""What if?"""
135.36	And they don't know that they
135.36	are not supposed to like computers.
139.76	It's the parents who do.
141.72	It's us parents who feel
143.039	like computer science
143.039	is this esoteric, weird science discipline
148.16	that only belongs to the mystery makers.
151.84	That it's almost as far removed
151.84	from everyday life
154.6	as, say, nuclear physics.
157.16	And they are partly right about that.
159.64	There's a lot of syntax
159.64	and controls and data structures
163.16	and algorithms and practices,
165.84	protocols and paradigms in programming.
168.44	And we as a community,
168.44	we've made computers smaller and smaller.
172.76	We've built layers and layers
172.76	of abstraction on top of each other
177.32	between the man and the machine
178.84	to the point that we no longer
178.84	have any idea how computers work
182.08	or how to talk to them.
184.28	And we do teach our kids
184.28	how the human body works,
187.08	we teach them how
187.08	the combustion engine functions
190.2	and we even tell them
190.2	that if you want to really be an astronaut
193.24	you can become one.
194.72	But when the kid comes to us and asks,
196.92	"""So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"""
199.68	"Or, ""How does the computer know"
199.68	what happens when I press 'play,'
204.12	"how does it know which video to show?"""
206	"Or, ""Linda, is Internet a place?"""
208.6	We adults, we grow oddly silent.
212.4	"""It's magic,"" some of us say."
214.88	"""It's too complicated,"" the others say."
218.52	Well, it's neither.
220.04	It's not magic and it's not complicated.
222.64	It all just happened
222.64	really, really, really fast.
226.28	Computer scientists built
226.28	these amazing, beautiful machines,
229.2	but they made them
229.2	very, very foreign to us,
231.64	and also the language we speak
231.64	to the computers
233.88	so that we don't know
233.88	how to speak to the computers anymore
236.92	without our fancy user interfaces.
239.44	And that's why no one recognized
241.04	that when I was conjugating
241.04	French irregular verbs,
243.76	I was actually practicing
243.76	my pattern recognition skills.
247.04	And when I was excited about knitting,
249.36	I actually was following
249.36	a sequence of symbolic commands
252.92	that included loops inside of them.
254.68	And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest
257.12	to find an exact language
257.12	between English and mathematics
261.12	found its home inside of a computer.
264.08	I was a programmer, but no one knew it.
267.08	The kids of today, they tap, swipe
267.08	and pinch their way through the world.
271.56	But unless we give them tools
271.56	to build with computers,
274.8	we are raising only consumers
274.8	instead of creators.
278.76	This whole quest
278.76	led me to this little girl.
281.32	Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.
283.72	She is completely fearless,
283.72	imaginative and a little bit bossy.
287.84	And every time
287.84	I would run into a problem
290.32	in trying to teach
290.32	myself programming like,
292.6	"""What is object-oriented design"
292.6	"or what is garbage collection?"","
296.6	I would try to imagine how a six-year-old
296.6	little girl would explain the problem.
301.04	And I wrote a book about her
301.04	and I illustrated it
303.72	and the things
303.72	Ruby taught me go like this.
306.12	Ruby taught me that you're
306.12	not supposed to be afraid
308.6	of the bugs under your bed.
310	And even the biggest of the problems
312.08	are a group of tiny problems
312.08	stuck together.
315.6	And Ruby also introduced
315.6	me to her friends,
318.36	the colorful side of the Internet culture.
321.28	She has friends like the Snow Leopard,
323.16	who is beautiful but doesn't want
323.16	to play with the other kids.
326.12	And she has friends like the green robots
326.12	that are really friendly but super messy.
330.76	And she has friends like Linux the penguin
332.96	who's really ruthlessly efficient,
332.96	but somewhat hard to understand.
336.64	And idealistic foxes, and so on.
339.88	In Ruby's world, you learn
339.88	technology through play.
343.56	And, for instance, computers
343.56	are really good at repeating stuff,
346.8	so the way Ruby would teach
346.8	loops goes like this.
349.72	This is Ruby's favorite dance move,
349.72	"it goes, ""Clap, clap, stomp, stomp"
353.12	"clap, clap and jump."""
354.64	And you learn counter loops
354.64	by repeating that four times.
358.68	And you learn while loops
358.68	by repeating that sequence
361.52	while I'm standing on one leg.
363.32	And you learn until loops
363.32	by repeating that sequence
366.64	until mom gets really mad.
368.72	(Laughter)
369.76	And most of all, you learn
369.76	that there are no ready answers.
374.32	When coming up with the curriculum
374.32	for Ruby's world,
377.08	I needed to really ask the kids
377.08	how they see the world
380.4	and what kind of questions they have
382.44	and I would organize
382.44	play testing sessions.
385.36	I would start by showing the kids
385.36	these four pictures.
388.48	I would show them a picture of a car,
390.84	a grocery store, a dog and a toilet.
393.28	"And I would ask, ""Which one of these"
393.28	"do you think is a computer?"""
397.48	And the kids would be
397.48	very conservative and go,
400.24	"""None of these is a computer."
402.04	I know what a computer is:
403.72	it's that glowing box
405.08	in front of which mom or dad
405.08	"spends way too much time."""
408.72	But then we would talk
410.24	and we would discover
410.24	that actually, a car is a computer,
413.08	it has a navigation system inside of it.
415.48	And a dog -- a dog
415.48	might not be a computer,
418.28	but it has a collar
419.52	and the collar might have
419.52	a computer inside of it.
422.16	And grocery stores, they have
422.16	so many different kinds of computers,
425.64	like the cashier system
425.64	and the burglar alarms.
429.08	And kids, you know what?
430.44	In Japan, toilets are computers
433	and there's even hackers who hack them.
434.92	(Laughter)
436.72	And we go further
437.96	and I give them these little stickers
437.96	with an on/off button on them.
441.2	And I tell the kids,
441.2	"""Today you have this magic ability"
444.84	to make anything in this room
444.84	"into a computer."""
448.48	And again, the kids go,
449.84	"""Sounds really hard,"
449.84	"I don't know the right answer for this."""
452.76	"But I tell them, ""Don't worry,"
454.36	your parents don't know
454.36	the right answer, either.
456.96	They've just started
456.96	to hear about this thing
459.2	called The Internet of Things.
461.44	But you kids,
461.44	you are going to be the ones
463.44	who are really going to live up in a world
463.44	"where everything is a computer."""
467.84	And then I had this little girl
467.84	who came to me
470.08	and took a bicycle lamp
471.4	"and she said, ""This bicycle lamp,"
471.4	if it were a computer,
475.64	"it would change colors."""
477.68	"And I said, ""That's a really good idea,"
477.68	"what else could it do?"""
480.72	And she thinks and she thinks,
482.48	"and she goes, ""If this bicycle lamp"
482.48	were a computer,
486.52	we could go on a biking trip
486.52	with my father
489.28	and we would sleep in a tent
490.92	and this biking lamp
490.92	"could also be a movie projector."""
495.64	And that's the moment I'm looking for,
498.4	the moment when the kid realizes
500	that the world
500	is definitely not ready yet,
502.4	that a really awesome way
502.4	of making the world more ready
505.4	is by building technology
507.64	and that each one of us
507.64	can be a part of that change.
511.2	Final story, we also built a computer.
514.28	And we got to know the bossy CPU
514.28	and the helpful RAM and ROM
519.04	that help it remember things.
520.48	And after we've assembled
520.48	our computer together,
523.44	we also design an application for it.
526.12	And my favorite story is this little boy,
528.159	he's six years old
529.44	and his favorite thing in the world
529.44	is to be an astronaut.
533.12	And the boy, he has
533.12	these huge headphones on
535.4	and he's completely immersed
535.4	in his tiny paper computer
538.68	because you see, he's built his own
540.72	intergalactic planetary
540.72	navigation application.
545.04	And his father, the lone astronaut
545.04	in the Martian orbit,
548.2	is on the other side of the room
550.08	and the boy's important mission
551.72	is to bring the father
551.72	safely back to earth.
555.76	And these kids are going to have
555.76	a profoundly different view of the world
559.24	and the way we build it with technology.
562.84	Finally, the more approachable,
562.84	the more inclusive,
566.72	and the more diverse
566.72	we make the world of technology,
570.12	the more colorful and better
570.12	the world will look like.
574.12	So, imagine with me, for a moment,
576.72	a world where the stories we tell
579.32	about how things get made
579.32	don't only include
582.36	the twentysomething-year-old
582.36	Silicon Valley boys,
584.8	but also Kenyan schoolgirls
584.8	and Norwegian librarians.
590	Imagine a world where
590	the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,
594.24	who live in a permanent
594.24	reality of 1s and 0s,
597.48	they grow up to be very optimistic
597.48	and brave about technology.
602.12	They embrace the powers
602.12	and the opportunities
605.52	and the limitations of the world.
607.68	A world of technology
607.68	that is wonderful, whimsical
611.84	and a tiny bit weird.
615.12	When I was a girl,
616.64	I wanted to be a storyteller.
618.68	I loved make-believe worlds
620.28	and my favorite thing to do
621.92	was to wake up in the mornings
621.92	in Moominvalley.
626	In the afternoons,
626	I would roam around the Tatooines.
629.32	And in the evenings,
629.32	I would go to sleep in Narnia.
633.4	And programming turned out
633.4	to be the perfect profession for me.
637.72	I still create worlds.
639.68	Instead of stories, I do them with code.
643.64	Programming gives me this amazing power
646.72	to build my whole little universe
649.12	with its own rules
649.12	and paradigms and practices.
654.12	Create something out of nothing
654.12	with the pure power of logic.
658.92	Thank you.
660.16	(Applause)
