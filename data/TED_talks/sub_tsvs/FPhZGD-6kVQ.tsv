12.56	Half of the human workforce
12.56	is expected to be replaced
16.16	by software and robots
16.16	in the next 20 years.
19.48	And many corporate leaders welcome
19.48	that as a chance to increase profits.
24.6	Machines are more efficient;
26.84	humans are complicated
26.84	and difficult to manage.
31.72	Well, I want our organizations
31.72	to remain human.
37.2	In fact, I want them to become beautiful.
41.12	Because as machines take our jobs
41.12	and do them more efficiently,
44.759	soon the only work left for us humans
44.759	will be the kind of work
49	that must be done beautifully
49	rather than efficiently.
53.76	To maintain our humanity
53.76	in the this second Machine Age,
56.96	we may have no other choice
56.96	than to create beauty.
62.24	Beauty is an elusive concept.
64.48	For the writer Stendhal
64.48	it was the promise of happiness.
68.52	For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.
70.88	(Laughter)
72.32	So bear with me
73.92	as I am proposing four admittedly
73.92	very subjective principles
78.32	that you can use to build
78.32	a beautiful organization.
81.96	First: do the unnecessary.
84.52	[Do the Unnecessary]
85.76	A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,
87.32	the CEO and founder
87.32	of the yogurt company Chobani,
90.48	made headlines when he decided to grant
90.48	stock to all of his 2,000 employees.
95.6	Some called it a PR stunt,
97.56	others -- a genuine act of giving back.
99.8	But there is something else
99.8	that was remarkable about it.
103	It came completely out of the blue.
105.08	There had been no market
105.08	or stakeholder pressure,
107.72	and employees were so surprised
109.72	that they burst into tears
109.72	when they heard the news.
113.6	Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful
113.6	because they catch us off guard.
117.48	They create something out of nothing
120	because they're completely unnecessary.
124.04	I once worked at a company
126.12	that was the result of a merger
127.72	of a large IT outsourcing firm
127.72	and a small design firm.
131.4	We were merging 9,000 software engineers
133.4	with 1,000 creative types.
135.8	And to unify these
135.8	immensely different cultures,
138.56	we were going to launch
138.56	a third, new brand.
141.639	And the new brand color
141.639	was going to be orange.
145.16	And as we were going
145.16	through the budget for the rollouts,
148.6	we decided last minute
150.68	to cut the purchase
150.68	of 10,000 orange balloons,
154.36	which we had meant
154.36	to distribute to all staff worldwide.
157.8	They just seemed
157.8	unnecessary and cute in the end.
161.92	I didn't know back then
163.84	that our decision
163.84	marked the beginning of the end --
166.4	that these two organizations
166.4	would never become one.
169.92	And sure enough,
169.92	the merger eventually failed.
172.64	Now, was it because
172.64	there weren't any orange balloons?
175.48	No, of course not.
177.88	But the kill-the-orange-balloons
177.88	mentality permeated everything else.
183.12	You might not always realize it,
183.12	but when you cut the unnecessary,
186.92	you cut everything.
189.28	Leading with beauty means
189.28	rising above what is merely necessary.
194.76	So do not kill your orange balloons.
199.04	The second principle:
200.72	create intimacy.
202.08	[Create Intimacy]
203.48	Studies show that
203.48	how we feel about our workplace
206.32	very much depends on the relationships
206.32	with our coworkers.
209.68	And what are relationships
209.68	other than a string of microinteractions?
213.12	There are hundreds of these
213.12	every day in our organizations
216.36	that have the potential to distinguish
216.36	a good life from a beautiful one.
221.48	The marriage researcher John Gottman says
223.48	that the secret of a healthy relationship
226.12	is not the great gesture
226.12	or the lofty promise,
229.2	it's small moments of attachment.
232.2	In other words, intimacy.
235.12	In our networked organizations,
236.68	we tout the strength of weak ties
239.32	but we underestimate
239.32	the strength of strong ones.
242.2	We forget the words of the writer
242.2	Richard Bach who once said,
245.12	"""Intimacy --"
246.36	not connectedness --
247.6	"intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."""
250.92	So how do we design
250.92	for organizational intimacy?
255.48	The humanitarian organization CARE
257.36	wanted to launch
257.36	a campaign on gender equality
259.76	in villages in northern India.
262.12	But it realized quickly
263.4	that it had to have this conversation
263.4	first with its own staff.
266.96	So it invited all 36 team members
266.96	and their partners
272.04	to one of the Khajuraho Temples,
273.8	known for their famous erotic sculptures.
277.52	And there they openly discussed
277.52	their personal relationships --
281.12	their own experiences of gender equality
284.52	with the coworkers and the partners.
287.04	It was eye-opening for the participants.
289.36	Not only did it allow them
289.36	to relate to the communities they serve,
293.4	it also broke down invisible barriers
295.96	and created a lasting bond
295.96	amongst themselves.
298.2	Not a single team member
298.2	quit in the next four years.
303.2	So this is how you create intimacy.
305.72	No masks ...
307.92	or lots of masks.
309.56	(Laughter)
310.8	When Danone, the food company,
312.28	wanted to translate its new company
312.28	manifesto into product initiatives,
316.52	it gathered the management team
318.72	and 100 employees
318.72	from across different departments,
322.36	seniority levels and regions
324	for a three-day strategy retreat.
326.8	And it asked everybody
326.8	to wear costumes for the entire meeting:
330.28	wigs, crazy hats, feather boas,
333.4	huge glasses and so on.
335.56	And they left with concrete outcomes
337.84	and full of enthusiasm.
340.04	And when I asked the woman
340.04	who had designed this experience
343.04	why it worked,
344.28	"she simply said, ""Never underestimate"
344.28	"the power of a ridiculous wig."""
348.12	(Laughter)
349.32	(Applause)
352.88	Because wigs erase hierarchy,
356.08	and hierarchy kills intimacy --
357.96	both ways,
359.2	for the CEO and the intern.
361.44	Wigs allow us to use
361.44	the disguise of the false
365.6	to show something true about ourselves.
369.12	And that's not easy
369.12	in our everyday work lives,
371.36	because the relationship
371.36	with our organizations
373.72	is often like that of a married couple
373.72	that has grown apart,
378.24	suffered betrayals and disappointments,
381.28	and is now desperate to be beautiful
381.28	for one another once again.
385.88	And for either of us the first step
385.88	towards beauty involves a huge risk.
390.52	The risk to be ugly.
391.76	[Be Ugly]
393.12	So many organizations these days
393.12	are keen on designing beautiful workplaces
397.4	that look like anything but work:
399.04	vacation resorts, coffee shops,
399.04	playgrounds or college campuses --
403.08	(Laughter)
404.32	Based on the promises
404.32	of positive psychology,
406.52	we speak of play and gamification,
409.92	and one start-up even says
409.92	that when someone gets fired,
413.48	they have graduated.
414.8	(Laughter)
416.8	That kind of beautiful language
416.8	"only goes ""skin deep,"
420.32	"but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"""
424.24	as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.
426.48	To be authentic is to be ugly.
430.8	It doesn't mean that you can't have fun
430.8	or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,
435.24	but it does mean that you speak
435.24	the actual ugly truth.
439.76	Like this manufacturer
441.04	that wanted to transform
441.04	one of its struggling business units.
444.8	It identified, named and pinned
444.8	on large boards all the issues --
448.24	and there were hundreds of them --
449.92	that had become obstacles
449.92	to better performance.
452.24	They put them on boards,
452.24	moved them all into one room,
454.84	"which they called ""the ugly room."""
457.12	The ugly became visible
457.12	for everyone to see --
459.52	it was celebrated.
461.36	And the ugly room served as a mix
461.36	of mirror exhibition and operating room --
465.24	a biopsy on the living flesh
465.24	to cut out all the bureaucracy.
470.64	The ugliest part of our body is our brain.
474.64	Literally and neurologically.
477.2	Our brain renders ugly
477.2	what is unfamiliar ...
481.44	modern art, atonal music,
483.44	jazz, maybe --
484.68	VR goggles for that matter --
486.4	strange objects, sounds and people.
490.32	But we've all been ugly once.
492.52	We were a weird-looking baby,
494.88	a new kid on the block, a foreigner.
497.96	And we will be ugly again
497.96	when we don't belong.
503.32	The Center for Political Beauty,
505.24	an activist collective in Berlin,
506.88	recently staged an extreme
506.88	artistic intervention.
510.2	With the permission of relatives,
512.12	it exhumed the corpses of refugees
512.12	who had drowned at Europe's borders,
516.28	transported them all the way to Berlin,
518.2	and then reburied them
518.2	at the heart of the German capital.
522.4	The idea was to allow them
522.4	to reach their desired destination,
526.12	if only after their death.
528.96	Such acts of beautification
528.96	may not be pretty,
532	but they are much needed.
533.28	Because things tend to get ugly
533.28	when there's only one meaning, one truth,
536.76	only answers and no questions.
538.88	Beautiful organizations
538.88	keep asking questions.
542.48	They remain incomplete,
545.275	which is the fourth
545.275	and the last of the principles.
547.68	[Remain Incomplete]
549.24	Recently I was in Paris,
551.4	and a friend of mine
551.4	took me to Nuit Debout,
554.4	"which stands for ""up all night,"""
555.96	the self-organized protest movement
557.92	that had formed in response
557.92	to the proposed labor laws in France.
562.68	Every night, hundreds gathered
562.68	at the Place de la RÃ©publique.
565.92	Every night they set up
565.92	a small, temporary village
568.52	to deliberate their own vision
568.52	of the French Republic.
572.12	And at the core of this adhocracy
574.8	was a general assembly
574.8	where anybody could speak
577.08	using a specially designed sign language.
580.92	Like Occupy Wall Street
580.92	and other protest movements,
584.2	Nuit Debout was born
584.2	in the face of crisis.
587.12	It was messy --
588.6	full of controversies and contradictions.
591.92	But whether you agreed
591.92	with the movement's goals or not,
594.72	every gathering was
594.72	a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.
599.64	And how fitting that Paris --
601.68	the city of ideals, the city of beauty --
604.48	was it's stage.
605.72	It reminds us that like great cities,
607.56	the most beautiful organizations
607.56	are ideas worth fighting for --
611.76	even and especially
611.76	when their outcome is uncertain.
615.48	They are movements;
616.8	they are always imperfect,
616.8	never fully organized,
619.16	so they avoid ever becoming banal.
621.88	They have something
621.88	but we don't know what it is.
624.24	They remain mysterious;
624.24	we can't take our eyes off them.
627.2	We find them beautiful.
631.24	So to do the unnecessary,
633.12	to create intimacy,
634.8	to be ugly,
636.32	to remain incomplete --
638.56	these are not only the qualities
638.56	of beautiful organizations,
641.56	these are inherently
641.56	human characteristics.
644.6	And these are also the qualities
644.6	of what we call home.
649.52	And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,
651.96	the least we can do is to ensure
654.28	that we still feel at home
654.28	in our organizations,
658.32	and that we use our organizations
658.32	to create that feeling for others.
662.6	Beauty can save the world
662.6	when we embrace these principles
665.72	and design for them.
668.16	In the face of artificial intelligence
668.16	and machine learning,
671.4	we need a new radical humanism.
673.76	We must acquire and promote
673.76	a new aesthetic and sentimental education.
679.32	Because if we don't,
681.36	we might end up feeling like aliens
683.84	in organizations and societies
683.84	that are full of smart machines
687.88	that have no appreciation whatsoever
690.72	for the unnecessary,
692.36	the intimate,
693.64	the incomplete
695.36	and definitely not for the ugly.
697.76	Thank you.
699	(Applause)
