15.963	This is how war starts.
18.775	One day you're living your ordinary life,
22.041	you're planning to go to a party,
24.557	you're taking your children to school,
26.941	you're making a dentist appointment.
29.654	The next thing, the telephones go out,
33.28	the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,
37.217	there's roadblocks.
39.533	Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.
44.01	It stops.
46.215	I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,
48.773	a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,
51.751	because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.
56.128	She was walking to work one day in April, 1992,
60.222	in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.
63.37	She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.
66.894	Great person.
68.728	And suddenly she sees a tank
72.035	ambling down the main road of Sarajevo
75.241	knocking everything out of its path.
78.793	She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.
82.824	And she runs as any of us would have done
85.569	and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,
89.586	in her high heels and her miniskirt.
92.185	And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,
96.404	but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers
99.1	and people all over the place and chaos
101.46	"and she thinks, ""I feel like Alice in Wonderland"
106.087	going down the rabbit hole,
108.422	down, down, down into chaos,
111.49	"and my life will never be the same again."""
116.891	A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people
120.678	pushing with her infant son in her arms
125.628	to give him to a stranger on a bus,
128.164	which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo
131.188	to take children out so they could be safe.
134.353	And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,
138.463	"crowds and crowds of people, ""Take my child! Take my child!"""
141.889	and passing her son to someone through a window.
147.942	And she didn't see him for years.
150.81	The siege went on for three and a half years,
154.529	and it was a siege without water,
156.818	without power, without electricity, without heat, without food,
162.107	in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
167.462	I had the honor of being one of those reporters
171.264	that lived through that siege,
173.683	and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there
176.721	because it's taught me everything,
178.911	not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.
183.04	I learned about compassion.
185.395	I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.
189.206	I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.
193.577	Most of all, I learned about love.
196.488	Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,
201.767	I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,
204.903	share food, raise their children,
207.547	drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road
210.799	even though you yourself were endangering your life,
213.656	helping people get into taxis who were injured
216.907	to try to take them to hospitals.
219.528	I learned so much about myself.
222.747	Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,
225.772	"""You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."""
230.97	I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,
234.506	so many that I lost count,
237.135	but there was nothing like Sarajevo.
240.218	Last April, I went back to a very strange --
244.173	what I called a deranged high school reunion.
247.947	What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,
252.29	the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,
254.762	"and I don't like the word ""anniversary,"" because it sounds like a party,"
259.202	and this was not a party.
260.605	It was a very somber gathering of the reporters
264.593	that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,
267.984	and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.
272.453	And the thing that struck me the most,
274.872	that broke my heart,
276.613	was walking down the main street of Sarajevo,
278.783	where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,
282.858	and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,
289.555	empty,
291.181	and every single one of them symbolized
293.45	a person who had died during the siege,
297.167	just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,
301.454	and it stretched from one end of the city
304.041	to a large part of it,
306.315	and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs
309.818	for the children.
312.674	I now cover Syria,
315.801	and I started reporting it because I believed that
318.991	it needs to be done.
321.247	I believe a story there has to be told.
324.252	I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.
328.222	And when I first arrived in Damascus,
330.451	I saw this strange moment where people
332.853	didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,
336.413	and it was exactly the same in Bosnia
338.348	and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.
341.162	People don't want to believe it's coming,
343.705	so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.
347.172	They don't get their money out.
348.842	They stay because you want to stay in your home.
352.737	And then war and chaos descend.
356.776	Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.
360.579	In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.
366.733	Between April and August, 1994,
371.582	one million people were slaughtered.
375.783	Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out
381.01	with the sheer number,
383.082	I want you just for a second to think of a million people.
386.713	And to give you some example, I remember
389.25	standing and looking down a road as far as I could see,
394.331	at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height
400.42	of the dead.
402.144	And that was just a small percentage of the dead.
405.479	And there were mothers holding their children
407.448	who had been caught in their last death throes.
410.789	So we learn a lot from war,
414.119	and I mention Rwanda
416.471	because it is one place, like South Africa,
420.589	where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.
424.571	Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,
428.039	which is fantastic,
430.491	and there's also within the national constitution now,
434.517	you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
437.69	You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,
441.559	which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.
446.105	And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,
449.212	or I find it beautiful.
450.695	There was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,
455.612	and a group of women who were adopting them,
458.326	and they lined up and one was just given to the next.
462.26	There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,
465.426	you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,
468.341	you might have killed my father.
470.187	They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,
475.493	and I find this remarkable.
479.077	So when people ask me how I continue to cover war,
481.919	and why I continue to do it,
484.131	this is why.
485.6	When I go back to Syria, next week in fact,
488.991	what I see is incredibly heroic people,
492.952	some of them fighting for democracy,
495.225	for things we take for granted every single day.
499.242	And that's pretty much why I do it.
502.48	In 2004, I had a little baby boy,
506.948	and I call him my miracle child,
510.143	because after seeing so much death
513.189	and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,
517.366	this ray of hope was born.
521.225	"And I called him Luca, which means ""The bringer of light,"""
525.422	because he does bring light to my life.
530.345	But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,
533.796	my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad
538.468	where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime
541.8	and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,
544.679	and I remember getting on the plane in tears,
547.773	crying to be separated from my son,
550.759	and while I was there,
552.992	a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine
555.727	"said to me, ""What are you doing here?"
558.201	"Why aren't you home with Luca?"""
560.042	"And I said, ""Well, I have to see."" It was 2004"
563.827	which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,
568.214	"""I have to see, I have to see what is happening here."
571.454	"I have to report it."""
572.319	"And he said, ""Go home,"
575.883	because if you miss his first tooth,
579.169	if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.
582.167	"But there will always be another war."""
586.03	And there, sadly, will always be wars.
590.371	And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,
594.225	as a reporter, as a writer,
595.991	what I do can stop them. I can't.
600.829	I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.
603.376	He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.
606.353	I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.
610.349	I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,
612.632	and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt
615.458	to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.
618.729	All I am is a witness.
622.564	My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.
627.618	A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light
630.851	in the darkest corners of the world.
633.613	And that's what I try to do.
636.26	I'm not always successful,
639.296	and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,
641.837	because you feel like you're writing into a void,
644.043	or you feel like no one cares.
646.372	Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?
648.621	Who cares about the Congo,
650.634	the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
652.908	all of these strings of places that
655.023	I will remember for the rest of my life?
658.996	But my m√©tier is to bear witness
662.249	and that is the crux, the heart of the matter,
665.431	for us reporters who do this.
667.972	And all I can really do is hope,
671.563	not to policymakers or politicians,
674.171	because as much as I'd like to have faith
676.568	that they read my words and do something,
679.033	I don't delude myself.
682.193	But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said
686.41	or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,
689.963	if you can remember the story of Sarajevo,
692.645	or the story of Rwanda,
696.136	then I've done my job.
698.709	Thank you very much.
700.747	(Applause)
