12.812	So I started working
14.449	with refugees because I wanted
16.333	to make a difference,
18.673	and making a difference starts
20.08	with telling their stories.
22.436	So when I meet refugees,
23.926	I always ask them questions.
26.726	Who bombed your house?
29.044	Who killed your son?
31.697	Did the rest of your family make it out alive?
35.741	How are you coping
37.727	in your life in exile?
40.258	But there's one question that always seems to me
43.261	to be most revealing, and that is:
45.725	What did you take?
47.907	What was that most important thing
50.157	that you had to take with you
52.229	when the bombs were exploding in your town,
55.635	and the armed gangs were approaching your house?
60.06	A Syrian refugee boy I know
62.665	told me that he didn't hesitate
65.355	when his life was in imminent danger.
69.145	He took his high school diploma,
72.126	and later he told me why.
74.055	"He said, ""I took my high school diploma"
77.263	"because my life depended on it."""
80.469	And he would risk his life to get that diploma.
83.698	On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.
87.38	His classroom sometimes shook
89.895	with the sound of bombs and shelling,
93.129	and his mother told me,
95.936	"""Every day, I would say to him every morning,"
99.005	"'Honey, please don't go to school.'"""
101.931	And when he insisted, she said,
105.39	"""I would hug him as if it were for the last time."""
109.362	But he said to his mother,
111.392	"""We're all afraid,"
113.237	but our determination to graduate
116.128	"is stronger than our fear."""
119.462	But one day, the family got terrible news.
122.798	Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin
125.532	were murdered in their homes for refusing
128.221	to leave their house.
129.215	Their throats were slit.
132.08	It was time to flee.
134.711	They left that day, right away, in their car,
137.725	Hany hidden in the back because they were facing
139.586	checkpoints of menacing soldiers.
143.496	And they would cross the border into Lebanon,
147.208	where they would find peace.
149.904	But they would begin a life of grueling hardship
153.586	and monotony.
156.59	They had no choice but to build a shack
159.289	on the side of a muddy field,
160.622	and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,
162.94	who plays outside.
164.678	And that day, they joined
167.1	the biggest population of refugees in the world,
172.304	in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.
175.33	It only has four million citizens,
177.981	and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.
181.551	There's not a town, a city or a village
185.645	that is not host to Syrian refugees.
190.392	This is generosity and humanity
193.587	that is remarkable.
197.961	Think about it this way, proportionately.
200.955	It would be as if
202.711	the entire population of Germany,
207.567	would flee to the United States in just three years.
212.957	Half of the entire population of Syria
216.118	is now uprooted,
218.548	most of them inside the country.
220.303	Six and a half million people
222.598	have fled for their lives.
225.32	Over and well over three million people
228.21	have crossed the borders
229.932	and have found sanctuary
229.932	in the neighboring countries,
233.475	and only a small proportion, as you see,
236.4	have moved on to Europe.
240.534	What I find most worrying
243.205	is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.
247.131	I took this picture of this little girl.
249.369	It was just two hours after she had arrived
252.294	after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.
256.636	And most troubling of all
260.061	is that only 20 percent of 
260.061	Syrian refugee children
263.802	are in school in Lebanon.
267.277	And yet, Syrian refugee children,
270.21	all refugee children tell us
272.508	education is the most important thing in their lives.
277.574	Why? Because it allows them to think of their future
281.755	rather than the nightmare of their past.
285.15	It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.
290.784	I'm reminded of a recent visit I took
292.813	to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,
296.39	and I met this girl,
298.202	"and I thought, ""She's beautiful,"""
299.979	and I went up to her and asked her,
301.686	"""Can I take your picture?"""
303.634	And she said yes,
305.333	but she refused to smile.
308.37	I think she couldn't,
311.419	because I think she must realize that she represents
314.925	a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,
319.369	a generation isolated and frustrated.
323.95	And yet, look at what they fled:
327.496	utter destruction,
329.335	buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.
334.914	Hany's home was also destroyed.
337.593	This will need to be rebuilt
340.806	by architects, by engineers, by electricians.
345.637	Communities will need teachers and lawyers
349.284	and politicians interested in reconciliation
353.525	and not revenge.
356.169	Shouldn't this be rebuilt
357.924	by the people with the largest stake,
361.015	the societies in exile, the refugees?
366.88	Refugees have a lot of time
369.634	to prepare for their return.
371.88	You might imagine that being a refugee
374.595	is just a temporary state.
377.103	Well far from it.
380.044	With wars going on and on,
383.56	the average time a refugee will spend in exile
387.362	is 17 years.
390.827	Hany was into his second year in limbo
394.415	when I went to visit him recently,
396.789	and we conducted our entire conversation in English,
400.546	which he confessed to me he learned
402.435	from reading all of Dan Brown's novels
406.089	and from listening to American rap.
410.444	We also spent some nice moments of laughter
413.189	and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.
417.823	But I'll never forget what he told me
419.444	when we ended our conversation that day.
422.868	He said to me,
425.281	"""If I am not a student, I am nothing."""
430.81	Hany is one of 50 million people
434.527	uprooted in this world today.
438.105	Never since World War II
440.884	have so many people been forcibly displaced.
446.151	So while we're making sweeping progress
448.78	in human health,
450.881	in technology, in education and design,
455.875	we are doing dangerously little
459.238	to help the victims
462.546	and we are doing far too little
465.245	to stop and prevent
467.281	the wars that are driving them from their homes.
470.69	And there are more and more victims.
475.133	Every day, on average,
478.267	by the end of this day,
484.297	from their homes —
491.271	They flee across borders like this one.
495.02	We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,
498.715	and this is a typical day.
505.588	Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,
510.492	risking their lives in this case
512.292	just to reach safety in Europe.
514.923	This Syrian young man
516.638	survived one of these boats that capsized —
519.424	most of the people drowned —
521.047	and he told us,
523.262	"""Syrians are just looking for a quiet place"
527.421	where nobody hurts you,
530.29	where nobody humiliates you,
532.832	"and where nobody kills you."""
535.543	Well, I think that should be the minimum.
538.761	How about a place of healing,
541.888	of learning,
543.766	and even opportunity?
548.832	Americans and Europeans
550.856	have the impression that proportionally
554.107	huge numbers of refugees are coming
556.48	to their country,
558.5	but the reality is
560.642	that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,
564.287	are living in the developing world,
566.967	in countries struggling with their own insecurity,
571.52	with their own issues of helping their own populations
575.539	and poverty.
577.662	So wealthy countries in the world should recognize
580.935	the humanity and the generosity of the countries
584.636	that are hosting so many refugees.
588.754	And all countries should make sure that no one
592.386	fleeing war and persecution
594.939	arrives at a closed border.
598.652	(Applause)
601.282	Thank you.
606.2	But there is something more that we can do
608.505	than just simply helping refugees survive.
612.915	We can help them thrive.
616.446	We should think of refugee camps and communities
619.506	as more than just temporary population centers
623.713	where people languish
625.873	waiting for the war to end.
628.782	Rather, as centers of excellence,
632.511	where refugees can triumph over their trauma
636.459	and train for the day that they can go home
639.643	as agents of positive change
642.724	and social transformation.
647.122	It makes so much sense,
649.508	but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia
653.817	that has been raging on for 22 years.
657.741	And imagine living in this camp.
660.25	I visited this camp.
661.823	It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,
663.7	and it was so remote
666.244	that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.
668.685	It was dusty and it was terribly hot.
672.131	And we went to visit a school
674.425	and started talking to the children,
676.342	and then I saw this girl across the room
678.936	who looked to me to be the same age
680.785	as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.
684.066	And I asked her the questions
685.61	that grown-ups ask kids,
687.789	"like, ""What is your favorite subject?"""
689.712	"and, ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
692.367	And this is when her face turned blank,
695.664	and she said to me,
697.714	"""I have no future."
700.185	"My schooling days are over."""
703.162	And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,
704.81	so I turned to my colleague
707.119	and she confirmed to me
709.217	there is no funding for secondary education
711.91	in this camp.
714.18	And how I wished at that moment
715.649	that I could say to her,
717.967	"""We will build you a school."""
720.372	And I also thought, what a waste.
724.546	She should be and she is
727.594	the future of Somalia.
731.925	A boy named Jacob Atem
735.131	had a different chance, but not before he experienced
738.326	terribly tragedy.
740.418	He watched — this is in Sudan —
742.882	as his village — he was only seven years old —
745.176	burned to the ground, and he learned
747.558	that his mother and his father
749.397	and his entire family
751.386	were killed that day.
753.25	Only his cousin survived, and the two of them
755.04	walked for seven months —
757.32	this is boys like him —
759.17	chased and pursued by wild
759.17	animals and armed gangs,
762.378	and they finally made it to refugee camps
764.738	where they found safety,
766.271	and he would spend the next seven years
768.394	in Kenya in a refugee camp.
771.581	But his life changed
774.109	when he got the chance to be resettled
776.212	to the United States,
778.417	and he found love in a foster family
781.113	and he was able to go to school,
783.701	and he wanted me to share with you
785.995	this proud moment
787.563	when he graduated from university.
789.868	(Applause)
795.829	I spoke to him on Skype the other day,
798.243	and he was in his new university in Florida
803.237	pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,
806.236	and he proudly told me how he was able to raise
809.306	enough funds from the American public
811.99	to establish a health clinic back in his village
816.575	back home.
819.655	So I want to take you back to Hany.
822.939	When I told him I was going to have the chance
825.16	to speak to you here on the TED stage,
827.877	he allowed me to read you a poem
830.172	that he sent in an email to me.
833.532	He wrote:
837.27	"""I miss myself,"
839.83	my friends,
842.335	times of reading novels or writing poems,
846.59	birds and tea in the morning.
851.515	My room, my books, myself,
856.464	and everything that was making me smile.
862.122	Oh, oh, I had so many dreams
866.25	"that were about to be realized."""
871.323	So here is my point:
873.551	Not investing in refugees
875.597	is a huge missed opportunity.
881.241	Leave them abandoned,
883.092	and they risk exploitation and abuse,
888.439	and leave them unskilled and uneducated,
891.712	and delay by years the return
894.265	to peace and prosperity in their countries.
900.115	I believe how we treat the uprooted
903.399	will shape the future of our world.
907.972	The victims of war can hold the keys
910.926	to lasting peace,
913.447	and it's the refugees
915.256	who can stop the cycle of violence.
918.923	Hany is at a tipping point.
921.944	We would love to help him go to university
924.209	and to become an engineer,
927.269	but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:
931.116	tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,
935.163	food rations and a bit of medicine.
939.519	University is a luxury.
942.916	But leave him to languish in this muddy field,
947.253	and he will become a member
949.214	of a lost generation.
952.636	Hany's story is a tragedy,
957.34	but it doesn't have to end that way.
961.073	Thank you.
963.45	(Applause)
