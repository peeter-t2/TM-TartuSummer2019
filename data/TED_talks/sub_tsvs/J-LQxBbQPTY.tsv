15.93	Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures
20.596	create their identity in some kind of narrative form.
24.746	From mother to daughter, preacher to congregant,
27.487	teacher to pupil, storyteller to audience.
30.551	Whether in cave paintings
32.341	or the latest uses of the Internet,
34.971	human beings have always told their histories and truths
38.802	through parable and fable.
41.259	We are inveterate storytellers.
44.736	But where, in our increasingly secular and fragmented world,
49.119	do we offer communality of experience,
53.217	unmediated by our own furious consumerism?
57.567	And what narrative, what history,
61.067	what identity, what moral code
63.748	are we imparting to our young?
67.1	Cinema is arguably
69.982	the 20th century's most influential art form.
72.567	Its artists told stories
74.617	across national boundaries,
75.899	in as many languages, genres and philosophies
78.767	as one can imagine.
80.017	Indeed, it is hard to find a subject
82.649	that film has yet to tackle.
84.666	During the last decade
86.317	we've seen a vast integration of global media,
88.733	now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster.
92.117	We are increasingly offered a diet
94.533	in which sensation, not story, is king.
98.017	What was common to us all 40 years ago --
100.45	the telling of stories between generations --
103.249	is now rarified.
105.334	As a filmmaker, it worried me.
107.582	As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
111.449	What future could the young build
113.866	with so little grasp
115.233	of where they've come from
117.017	and so few narratives of what's possible?
120.075	The irony is palpable;
121.723	technical access has never been greater,
125.224	cultural access never weaker.
128.291	And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB,
132.624	an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools
136.659	followed by discussions.
138.741	If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film,
142.474	maybe we could build a narrative
144.542	that would deliver meaning
146.09	to the fragmented and restless world of the young.
149.173	Given the access to technology,
150.776	even a school in a tiny rural hamlet
154.507	could project a DVD onto a white board.
158.208	In the first nine months
160.042	we ran 25 clubs across the U.K.,
162.39	with kids in age groups between five and 18
165.458	watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes.
168.49	The films were curated and contextualized.
171.374	But the choice was theirs,
173.125	and our audience quickly grew
174.941	to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide.
179.174	The outcome, immediate.
181.973	It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind.
187.559	In groups as large as 150 and as small as three,
190.891	these young people discovered new places,
193.607	new thoughts, new perspectives.
195.524	By the time the pilot had finished,
197.658	we had the names of a thousand schools
200.491	that wished to join.
204.31	The film that changed my life
205.931	"is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, ""Miracle in Milan."""
210.898	It's a remarkable comment
212.651	on slums, poverty and aspiration.
215.981	I had seen the film on the occasion of my father's 50th birthday.
220.215	Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema,
224.177	find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
227.154	But for my father,
228.826	the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great
234.612	that he chose to celebrate his half-century
237.243	with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends,
241.108	"""In order,"" he said,"
242.46	"""to pass the baton of concern and hope"
245.927	"on to the next generation."""
248.41	"In the last shot of ""Miracle in Milan,"""
251.177	slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
255.127	Sixty years after the film was made
257.659	and 30 years after I first saw it,
259.86	I see young faces tilt up in awe,
262.41	their incredulity matching mine.
264.678	And the speed with which they associate it
267.176	"with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or the favelas in Rio"
270.8	speaks to the enduring nature.
273.748	In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government,
276.865	"we screened ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."""
278.781	Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
285.2	Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
289.341	It shows how to do right,
290.9	how to be heroically awkward.
292.634	It is also an expression of faith
295.384	in the political machine as a force of honor.
298.909	"Shortly after ""Mr. Smith"" became a FILMCLUB classic,"
302.392	there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords.
307.058	And it was with great delight
308.342	that we found young people up and down the country
310.993	explaining with authority
312.826	what filibustering was
314.842	and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle.
320.359	After all, Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels.
324.493	"In choosing ""Hotel Rwanda,"""
327.56	they explored genocide of the most brutal kind.
330.843	It provoked tears as well as incisive questions
334.376	about unarmed peace-keeping forces
336.176	and the double-dealing of a Western society
338.859	that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind.
342.793	"And when ""Schindler's List"" demanded that they never forget,"
346.859	one child, full of the pain of consciousness, remarked,
350.976	"""We already forgot,"
352.245	"otherwise how did 'Hotel Rwanda' happen?"""
356.259	As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer.
360.026	"""Pickpocket"" started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement."
364.659	"""To Sir, with Love"" ignited its teen audience."
368.526	They celebrated a change in attitude
371.175	towards non-white Britons,
372.875	but railed against our restless school system
376.295	that does not value collective identity,
379.343	unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier's careful tutelage.
385.41	By now, these thoughtful, opinionated, curious young people
389.525	thought nothing of tackling films of all forms --
392.36	black and white, subtitled,
393.675	documentary, non-narrative, fantasy --
396.409	and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews
399.108	that competed to favor one film over another
402.592	in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose.
406.416	Six thousand reviews each school week
409.582	vying for the honor of being review of the week.
414.1	From 25 clubs, we became hundreds, then thousands,
418.16	until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids
421.242	in 7,000 clubs right across the country.
424.658	And although the numbers were, and continue to be, extraordinary,
427.542	what became more extraordinary
429.825	was how the experience of critical and curious questioning
433.375	translated into life.
435.893	Some of our kids started talking with their parents,
438.76	others with their teachers,
440.526	or with their friends.
441.509	And those without friends
443.209	started making them.
445.41	The films provided communality across all manner of divide.
450.726	And the stories they held provided a shared experience.
453.843	"""Persepolis"" brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother,"
458.26	"and ""Jaws"" became the way in which one young boy"
462.061	was able to articulate the fear he'd experienced
465.626	in flight from violence
467.176	that killed first his father then his mother,
470.16	the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey.
475.042	Who was right, who wrong?
477.001	What would they do under the same conditions?
479.117	Was the tale told well?
480.666	Was there a hidden message?
482.267	How has the world changed? How could it be different?
485	A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children
489.884	who the world didn't think were interested.
491.634	And they themselves had not known they cared.
495.105	And as they wrote and debated,
497.017	rather than seeing the films as artifacts,
499.983	they began to see themselves.
505.049	I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller.
508.214	In a moment she can invoke images
510.368	of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers.
514.333	Quite recently she told me
515.899	that in 1948, two of her sisters and my father
519.298	traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents.
521.946	When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions,
526.412	it was these teenagers that fed the crew.
530.146	I was past 40 when my father died.
532.296	He never mentioned that journey.
534.848	My mother's mother left Europe in a hurry
538.533	without her husband, but with her three-year-old daughter
541.93	and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt.
545.761	After two years in hiding,
547.045	my grandfather appeared in London.
549.879	He was never right again.
552.179	And his story was hushed as he assimilated.
556.88	My story started in England
560.818	with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents.
565.081	"I had ""Anne Frank,"" ""The Great Escape,"""
567.232	"""Shoah,"" ""Triumph of the Will."""
569.746	It was Leni Riefenstahl
571.801	in her elegant Nazi propaganda
574.584	who gave context to what the family had to endure.
578.492	These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud,
584.142	and they became more useful to me
586.492	than the whispers of survivors
589.209	and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo
592.144	on a maiden aunt's wrist.
594.992	Purists may feel that fiction dissipates
597.775	the quest of real human understanding,
600.776	that film is too crude
602.275	to tell a complex and detailed history,
604.709	or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth.
608.959	But within the reels lie purpose and meaning.
612.093	"As one 12-year-old said after watching ""Wizard of Oz,"""
615.36	"""Every person should watch this,"
617.659	because unless you do
619.509	"you may not know that you too have a heart."""
624.176	We honor reading, why not honor watching with the same passion?
628.575	"Consider ""Citizen Kane"" as valuable as Jane Austen."
631.869	"Agree that ""Boyz n the Hood,"" like Tennyson,"
635.068	offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding
639.086	that work together.
640.835	Each a piece of memorable art,
642.369	each a brick in the wall of who we are.
645.818	And it's okay if we remember Tom Hanks
648.685	better than astronaut Jim Lovell
650.735	or have Ben Kingsley's face superimposed onto that of Gandhi's.
655.299	And though not real, Eve Harrington, Howard Beale, Mildred Pierce
658.855	are an opportunity to discover
661.552	what it is to be human,
663.968	and no less helpful to understanding our life and times
668.002	as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England.
673.752	We guessed that film,
675.32	whose stories are a meeting place
677.319	of drama, music, literature and human experience,
679.548	would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB.
684.053	What we could not have foreseen
685.585	was the measurable improvements
687.218	in behavior, confidence and academic achievement.
690.936	Once-reluctant students now race to school, talk to their teachers,
695.218	fight, not on the playground,
696.703	but to choose next week's film --
698.836	young people who have found self-definition, ambition
702.422	and an appetite for education and social engagement
706.669	from the stories they have witnessed.
709.635	Our members defy the binary description
713.018	of how we so often describe our young.
715.836	They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
720.819	They are, like other young people,
722.586	negotiating a world with infinite choice,
726.053	but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
730.753	We appeared surprised at the behaviors
733.387	of those who define themselves
735.385	by the size of the tick on their shoes,
737.586	yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
741.835	If we want different values
743.652	we have to tell a different story,
747.119	a story that understands that an individual narrative
751.121	is an essential component of a person's identity,
754.984	that a collective narrative
756.753	is an essential component of a cultural identity,
760.734	and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself
764.468	as part of a group.
765.869	Because when these people get home
768.925	"after a screening of ""Rear Window"""
771.444	and raise their gaze to the building next door,
774.193	they have the tools to wonder who, apart from them,
777.858	is out there
779.425	and what is their story.
781.958	Thank you.
783.609	(Applause)
