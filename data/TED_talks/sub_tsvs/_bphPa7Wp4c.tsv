12.557	In the space that used
12.557	to house one transistor,
16.259	we can now fit one billion.
19.636	That made it so that a computer
19.636	the size of an entire room
23.557	now fits in your pocket.
26.17	You might say the future is small.
29.611	As an engineer,
30.842	I'm inspired by this miniaturization
30.842	revolution in computers.
34.851	As a physician,
36.223	I wonder whether we could use it
36.223	to reduce the number of lives lost
41.97	due to one of the fastest-growing
41.97	diseases on Earth:
46.101	cancer.
47.543	Now when I say that,
48.822	what most people hear me say
48.822	is that we're working on curing cancer.
52.624	And we are.
53.911	But it turns out
55.086	that there's an incredible
55.086	opportunity to save lives
57.911	through the early detection
57.911	and prevention of cancer.
61.785	Worldwide, over two-thirds of deaths
61.785	due to cancer are fully preventable
67.188	using methods that we already
67.188	have in hand today.
70.406	Things like vaccination, timely screening
73.329	and of course, stopping smoking.
76.316	But even with the best tools
76.316	and technologies that we have today,
79.933	some tumors can't be detected
82.02	until 10 years after
82.02	they've started growing,
85.714	when they are 50 million
85.714	cancer cells strong.
90.178	What if we had better technologies
91.881	to detect some of these more
91.881	deadly cancers sooner,
95.011	when they could be removed,
96.337	when they were just getting started?
98.562	Let me tell you about how
98.562	miniaturization might get us there.
103.14	This is a microscope in a typical lab
105.452	that a pathologist would use
105.452	for looking at a tissue specimen,
109.032	like a biopsy or a pap smear.
111.927	This $7,000 microscope
114.019	would be used by somebody
114.019	with years of specialized training
117.299	to spot cancer cells.
120.126	This is an image from a colleague
120.126	of mine at Rice University,
123.196	Rebecca Richards-Kortum.
124.798	What she and her team have done
124.798	is miniaturize that whole microscope
128.649	into this $10 part,
130.648	and it fits on the end
130.648	of an optical fiber.
133.923	Now what that means is instead
133.923	of taking a sample from a patient
137.581	and sending it to the microscope,
139.254	you can bring the microscope
139.254	to the patient.
142.26	And then, instead of requiring
142.26	a specialist to look at the images,
146.643	you can train the computer to score
146.643	normal versus cancerous cells.
152.084	Now this is important,
153.278	because what they found
153.278	working in rural communities,
156.339	is that even when they have
156.339	a mobile screening van
159.602	that can go out into the community
159.602	and perform exams
162.459	and collect samples
163.888	and send them to the central
163.888	hospital for analysis,
167.128	that days later,
168.496	women get a call
168.496	with an abnormal test result
171.187	and they're asked to come in.
172.828	Fully half of them don't turn up
172.828	because they can't afford the trip.
177.721	With the integrated microscope
177.721	and computer analysis,
181.169	Rebecca and her colleagues
181.169	have been able to create a van
184.021	that has both a diagnostic setup
184.021	and a treatment setup.
187.831	And what that means
187.831	is that they can do a diagnosis
190.569	and perform therapy on the spot,
193.28	so no one is lost to follow up.
195.831	That's just one example of how
195.831	miniaturization can save lives.
200.148	Now as engineers,
201.325	we think of this
201.325	as straight-up miniaturization.
204.094	You took a big thing
204.094	and you made it little.
206.555	But what I told you before about computers
208.83	was that they transformed our lives
211.1	when they became small enough
211.1	for us to take them everywhere.
215.785	So what is the transformational
215.785	equivalent like that in medicine?
220.5	Well, what if you had a detector
223.66	that was so small that it could
223.66	circulate in your body,
227.946	find the tumor all by itself
230.383	and send a signal to the outside world?
233.079	It sounds a little bit
233.079	like science fiction.
235.18	But actually, nanotechnology
235.18	allows us to do just that.
239.415	Nanotechnology allows us to shrink
239.415	the parts that make up the detector
244.32	from the width of a human hair,
246.181	which is 100 microns,
247.865	to a thousand times smaller,
250.444	which is 100 nanometers.
252.37	And that has profound implications.
255.583	It turns out that materials
255.583	actually change their properties
259.25	at the nanoscale.
261.279	You take a common material like gold,
263.801	and you grind it into dust,
263.801	into gold nanoparticles,
267.146	and it changes from looking
267.146	gold to looking red.
271.082	If you take a more exotic material
271.082	like cadmium selenide --
274.919	forms a big, black crystal --
277.117	if you make nanocrystals
277.117	out of this material
279.742	and you put it in a liquid,
281.339	and you shine light on it,
283.187	they glow.
284.377	And they glow blue, green,
284.377	yellow, orange, red,
290.032	depending only on their size.
292.887	It's wild! Can you imagine an object
292.887	like that in the macro world?
296.914	It would be like all the denim jeans
296.914	in your closet are all made of cotton,
303.509	but they are different colors
303.509	depending only on their size.
308.212	(Laughter)
310.982	So as a physician,
312.53	what's just as interesting to me
314.778	is that it's not just
314.778	the color of materials
317.102	that changes at the nanoscale;
319.057	the way they travel
319.057	in your body also changes.
323.137	And this is the kind of observation
323.137	that we're going to use
325.96	to make a better cancer detector.
328.158	So let me show you what I mean.
330.686	This is a blood vessel in the body.
332.907	Surrounding the blood vessel is a tumor.
335.683	We're going to inject nanoparticles
335.683	into the blood vessel
338.748	and watch how they travel
338.748	from the bloodstream into the tumor.
343.464	Now it turns out that the blood vessels
343.464	of many tumors are leaky,
347.84	and so nanoparticles can leak out
347.84	from the bloodstream into the tumor.
352.628	Whether they leak out
352.628	depends on their size.
356.129	So in this image,
357.303	the smaller, hundred-nanometer,
357.303	blue nanoparticles are leaking out,
361.698	and the larger, 500-nanometer,
361.698	red nanoparticles
365.118	are stuck in the bloodstream.
366.919	So that means as an engineer,
369.046	depending on how big
369.046	or small I make a material,
373.062	I can change where it goes in your body.
377.249	In my lab, we recently made
377.249	a cancer nanodetector
381.915	that is so small that it could travel
381.915	into the body and look for tumors.
387.477	We designed it to listen
387.477	for tumor invasion:
391.593	the orchestra of chemical signals
391.593	that tumors need to make to spread.
396.932	For a tumor to break out
396.932	of the tissue that it's born in,
399.858	it has to make chemicals called enzymes
402.598	to chew through
402.598	the scaffolding of tissues.
405.763	We designed these nanoparticles
405.763	to be activated by these enzymes.
411.034	One enzyme can activate a thousand
411.034	of these chemical reactions in an hour.
417.462	Now in engineering, we call
417.462	that one-to-a-thousand ratio
421.044	a form of amplification,
422.633	and it makes something ultrasensitive.
424.829	So we've made an ultrasensitive
424.829	cancer detector.
429.22	OK, but how do I get this activated
429.22	signal to the outside world,
434.144	where I can act on it?
435.906	For this, we're going to use
435.906	one more piece of nanoscale biology,
439.482	and that has to do with the kidney.
441.659	The kidney is a filter.
443.996	Its job is to filter out the blood
443.996	and put waste into the urine.
449.197	It turns out that what the kidney filters
451.883	is also dependent on size.
454.901	So in this image, what you can see
456.865	is that everything smaller
456.865	than five nanometers
459.898	is going from the blood,
459.898	through the kidney, into the urine,
464.027	and everything else
464.027	that's bigger is retained.
467.176	OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer
467.176	cancer detector,
472.147	I inject it in the bloodstream,
474.643	it can leak into the tumor
474.643	where it's activated by tumor enzymes
480.097	to release a small signal
482.477	that is small enough to be
482.477	filtered out of the kidney
485.723	and put into the urine,
487.925	I have a signal in the outside world
487.925	that I can detect.
492.588	OK, but there's one more problem.
494.664	This is a tiny little signal,
496.434	so how do I detect it?
498.73	Well, the signal is just a molecule.
500.989	They're molecules
500.989	that we designed as engineers.
503.68	They're completely synthetic,
503.68	and we can design them
506.882	so they are compatible
506.882	with our tool of choice.
510.145	If we want to use a really
510.145	sensitive, fancy instrument
513.611	called a mass spectrometer,
515.599	then we make a molecule
515.599	with a unique mass.
518.671	Or maybe we want make something
518.671	that's more inexpensive and portable.
522.394	Then we make molecules
522.394	that we can trap on paper,
526.201	like a pregnancy test.
527.929	In fact, there's a whole
527.929	world of paper tests
530.579	that are becoming available
530.579	in a field called paper diagnostics.
535.711	Alright, where are we going with this?
538.724	What I'm going to tell you next,
540.317	as a lifelong researcher,
542.167	represents a dream of mine.
544.396	I can't say that's it's a promise;
546.513	it's a dream.
548.029	But I think we all have to have dreams
548.029	to keep us pushing forward,
551.64	even -- and maybe especially --
551.64	cancer researchers.
555.601	I'm going to tell you what I hope
555.601	will happen with my technology,
559.124	that my team and I will put
559.124	our hearts and souls
563.239	into making a reality.
565.289	OK, here goes.
567.011	I dream that one day,
570.39	instead of going into
570.39	an expensive screening facility
573.669	to get a colonoscopy,
575.198	or a mammogram,
576.545	or a pap smear,
578.585	that you could get a shot,
580.328	wait an hour,
582.012	and do a urine test on a paper strip.
585.653	I imagine that this could even happen
588.484	without the need for steady electricity,
591.171	or a medical professional in the room.
593.799	Maybe they could be far away
595.32	and connected only by the image
595.32	on a smartphone.
598.854	Now I know this sounds like a dream,
600.613	but in the lab we already
600.613	have this working in mice,
603.756	where it works better
603.756	than existing methods
605.859	for the detection of lung,
605.859	colon and ovarian cancer.
610.603	And I hope that what this means
612.861	is that one day we can
612.861	detect tumors in patients
618.061	sooner than 10 years
618.061	after they've started growing,
621.378	in all walks of life,
623.387	all around the globe,
625.26	and that this would lead
625.26	to earlier treatments,
628.019	and that we could save more lives
628.019	than we can today,
631.641	with early detection.
633.686	Thank you.
634.892	(Applause)
