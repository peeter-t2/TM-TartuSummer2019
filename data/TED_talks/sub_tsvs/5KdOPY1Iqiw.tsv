26	I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?
30	And you should be really afraid,
32	but not for the reasons why you think you should be.
35	You should be really afraid that --
37	if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.
43	Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and
47	thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,
51	you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.
54	And this is what this adventure's really about.
56	This is crystallized DNA.
60	Every life form on this planet -- every insect, every bacteria, every plant,
63	every animal, every human, every politician -- (Laughter)
68	is coded in that stuff.
70	And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.
74	And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.
77	And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.
81	It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.
84	If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,
86	or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,
89	it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant
92	and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.
95	And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.
100	(Laughter)
104	It turns out that what this stuff is --
106	and Richard Dawkins has written about this --
108	is, this is really a river out of Eden.
110	So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells
114	is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.
117	And we could start dating things,
118	and we could start changing medicine and archeology.
122	It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,
125	white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.
128	White Europeans were subject to the plague.
134	And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,
137	but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.
141	And that mutation was passed on to their kids
143	because they're the ones that survived,
145	so there was a great deal of population pressure.
147	In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,
149	you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.
152	We can date it to 700 years ago.
155	That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,
159	and not as fast across Europe.
163	And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,
166	for sickle cell, for cancers.
170	And in the measure that we map ourselves,
172	this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.
174	And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,
178	and I want you to toast these two people.
181	Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,
185	and that is almost as important a date
188	as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,
191	but anyway, we'll get to that.
193	I thought we'd talk about the new zoo.
195	So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,
199	but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty
202	because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.
207	If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,
210	it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.
213	And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,
216	which is part of the reason
217	why this whole species-mapping project is so important.
222	Because we're just beginning to learn
224	where we came from and what we are.
226	And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.
230	And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,
232	except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,
235	which is what makes you you,
237	as far as gene code inside each of your cells,
240	and this little amoeba which, you know,
243	sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,
246	turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
252	So, this little thingamajig has a genome
255	that's 200 times the size of yours.
258	And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,
262	it may not turn out to be chips.
265	It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.
269	And, again, we're learning from life and how life works.
273	This funky little thing: people didn't used to think
277	that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors
280	because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.
283	And then finally somebody picked up a microscope
286	and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
289	And sitting next to that water in the cores
291	was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,
294	having its chromosomes blown apart every day,
296	six, seven times, restitching them,
299	living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.
302	And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse
305	and how important and how interesting this journey into life is,
307	and how many different life forms there are,
310	and how there can be different life forms living in
313	very different places, maybe even outside of this planet.
317	Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,
319	that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.
323	This little thingamajig: we didn't know this thingamajig existed.
327	We should have known that this existed
329	because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.
332	So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.
335	It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.
338	And what you're looking at with this namibiensis
340	is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.
342	So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.
346	Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.
350	We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.
354	This is a really odd one. This is Ferroplasma.
358	The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,
362	lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,
366	and excretes sulfuric acid.
370	So, when you think of odd life forms,
372	when you think of what it takes to live,
376	it turns out this is a very efficient life form,
378	"and they call it an archaea. Archaea means ""the ancient ones."""
382	And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up
386	when this planet was covered
388	by things like sulfuric acid in batteries,
389	and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.
394	So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins
398	that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.
402	Your fear should be that you are not,
405	that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.
408	I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.
414	Whether the humans survive or don't survive,
417	these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.
420	And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA
424	that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure
427	that we've ever been on.
430	And you can do strange things with this stuff. This is a baby gaur.
434	Conservation group gets together,
436	tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.
441	They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is
444	they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,
450	take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,
455	reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.
459	When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.
464	We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,
470	and the Australians -- bless their hearts --
473	are playing with these things.
474	Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.
478	These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.
482	But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code
485	and how to reprogram species,
487	we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
492	And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,
495	then we can put a full string of DNA together.
498	And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,
503	we may give birth to an animal
505	that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.
508	And then you can start going back further,
510	and you can start thinking about dodos,
513	and you can think about other species.
515	And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out
518	what the primordial ancestor is.
520	Because each of us contains our entire gene code
523	of where we've been for the past billion years,
526	because we've evolved from that stuff,
528	you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,
530	and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,
533	maybe we'll give birth to something
535	that is very close to the first primordial ooze.
537	And it's all coming out of things that look like this.
539	These are companies that didn't exist five years ago.
541	Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.
545	Some are public. Some are private.
547	It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.
551	Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.
553	We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.
557	That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.
562	And it will be really boring. It will read like this.
565	(Laughter)
567	The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.
569	And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.
572	Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,
574	you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.
578	That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.
580	But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,
582	and this apple works the same way.
584	This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
586	Because this thing codes ones and zeros,
588	and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,
590	absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day
593	it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?
597	(Laughter)
600	And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,
604	it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,
607	AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.
610	Next line of code: make a stem.
612	Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,
615	that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.
618	In the measure that you have the code
620	and the measure that you read it --
623	and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;
625	the first human was read two years ago;
627	the first insect was read two years ago.
629	The first thing that we ever read was in 1995:
632	a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.
635	In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,
638	you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms
640	so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,
642	or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,
645	which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester
648	that feels like silk in corn.
651	This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.
658	This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.
662	And what you can do now is,
664	you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,
667	and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,
670	and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,
673	and then you can tie it to the literature.
675	And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,
678	and get on the Internet, and access
680	the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.
684	And you can do some pretty strange things
686	because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,
689	if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,
692	he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.
698	Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.
701	(Laughter)
703	The reason why he's reprogramming that animal to have more wings
706	is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,
709	and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.
713	Not so in human beings:
716	you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.
719	But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,
724	each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research
728	and if we don't stop genomic research,
730	to express different body functions.
734	And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,
737	and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,
739	one of the things we're going to be able to do
742	is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,
746	and one of the things we're going to learn how to do
748	is how to reprogram cells like stem cells
751	in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.
758	And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --
761	on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,
765	in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.
770	How's this stuff work? If each of you differs
775	from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,
778	which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,
780	very small differences in expression and punctuation
783	can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.
788	(Laughter)
790	Right?
791	That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,
795	and they look at that sentence, and they read this.
803	Okay?
804	Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.
808	This is the way it should be seen.
812	(Laughter)
820	That's what your genes are doing.
821	That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.
826	Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...
829	I won't go there.
832	You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.
836	You can look at this, right?
840	And they look at the world a little differently.
842	They look at the same world and they say...
844	(Laughter)
850	That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,
854	mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.
857	Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.
861	You can make very small changes in gene code
863	and get really different outcomes,
867	even with the same string of letters.
871	That's what your genes are doing every day.
874	That's why sometimes a person's genes
876	don't have to change a lot to get cancer.
882	These little chippies, these things are the size of a credit card.
887	They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.
890	That brings up questions of privacy and insurability
893	and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,
896	because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,
900	it turns out that three diseases with
902	completely similar clinical syndromes
906	are completely different diseases.
908	Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.
911	In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,
913	and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.
915	And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,
920	then you take Gleevec and you're cured.
923	If it is not expressing in your body,
925	if you don't have one of those types --
927	a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.
930	It won't do anything for you.
932	Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.
935	Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.
938	Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.
942	Changes the way medicine works.
944	The greatest repository of knowledge when most of us went to college
947	was this thing, and it turns out that
949	this is not so important any more.
951	The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,
955	contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company
959	every month on a compound basis.
962	Let me say that again: A single genomics company
965	generates more data in a month, on a compound basis,
968	than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.
972	This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.
976	So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months
981	and the power doubles, right?
983	Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed
987	with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,
990	Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.
995	This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.
999	This is going to push computers to have to grow faster
1003	than they've been growing, because so far,
1005	there haven't been applications that have been required
1008	that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.
1011	And here's an interesting map.
1013	This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.
1017	One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,
1020	who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.
1024	Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits
1027	moving inside from the United States to the United States;
1030	about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;
1034	about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication
1037	between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.
1041	It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;
1046	they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.
1049	So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.
1052	That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.
1058	In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.
1060	You can break this out by states.
1062	And you can watch states rise and fall depending on
1064	their ability to speak a language of life,
1066	and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,
1068	and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,
1070	and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.
1074	And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.
1077	And if you want to get more specific,
1079	it's actually specific zip codes.
1081	(Laughter)
1083	So, you want to know where life is happening?
1086	Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.
1092	And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,
1097	and it's called Torrey Pines Road.
1099	That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;
1102	it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;
1104	and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country
1107	in about three or four carefully picked 747s.
1111	Same thing in Massachusetts. Looks more spread out but --
1115	oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.
1119	What's the net effect of this?
1121	In an agricultural society, the difference between
1123	the richest and the poorest,
1125	the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?
1129	Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids
1131	and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,
1134	you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,
1136	than your neighbor.
1138	In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.
1142	It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing
1146	in English and French and German,
1148	but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.
1151	And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.
1155	So, if there is something you should fear,
1157	it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.
1160	Because it really matters who speaks life.
1163	That's why nations rise and fall.
1166	And it turns out that if you went back to the 1870s,
1169	the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.
1172	And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,
1175	and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --
1179	beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.
1183	And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation
1186	on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth
1189	per person per year than America.
1192	Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.
1196	Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.
1202	Here's differential productivity rates.
1206	Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.
1209	So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,
1216	It's got nothing to do with inflation.
1218	It's got nothing to do with privatization.
1220	You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,
1224	stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country
1227	because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.
1230	Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.
1233	Well, watch what happens to India.
1235	India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy
1238	just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.
1243	Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth
1247	because they didn't get this change,
1250	because they kept treating their people like serfs
1252	instead of like shareholders of a common project.
1256	They didn't keep the people who were educated.
1259	They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.
1262	Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say
1266	that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.
1269	Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.
1272	(Laughter)
1276	Here's what's happening in the world.
1278	It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,
1281	when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.
1283	It turns out there's now about 192.
1286	Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --
1291	and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.
1296	In the 1990s, these are sovereign states
1299	that did not exist before 1990.
1301	And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
1306	We're generating about 3.12 states per year.
1309	People are taking control of their own states,
1312	sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
1315	And the really interesting thing is,
1317	you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,
1319	and you don't need a lot to do it.
1321	(Music)
1323	And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk
1326	about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,
1329	and how code works.
1331	Moderator: Two minutes.
1332	(Laughter)
1334	Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year
1338	because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.
1341	But thank you very much.
