13.12	I'd like you to imagine the world anew.
17.84	I'd like to show you some maps,
20.039	which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,
22.8	of the planet in a way
24.52	that most of you will never
24.52	have seen the planet depicted before.
30.48	Here's an image
30.48	that you're very familiar with.
34.48	I'm old enough that I was actually born
34.48	before we saw this image.
38.56	Apparently some of my first words
38.56	"were ""moona, moona,"""
41.16	but I think that's my mom
41.16	having a particular fantasy
44.28	about what her baby boy could see
46.56	on the flickering
46.56	black and white TV screen.
51.68	It's only been a few centuries
53.32	since we've actually, most of us,
53.32	thought of our planet as spherical.
58.16	When we first saw
58.16	these images in the 1960s,
61.24	the world was changing
61.24	at an incredible rate.
66.32	In my own little discipline
66.32	of human geography,
70.6	a cartographer called Waldo Tobler
73.36	was drawing new maps of the planet,
75.92	and these maps have now spread,
77.44	and I'm going to show you one of them now.
80.2	This map is a map of the world,
83.72	but it's a map which looks to you
86.16	a little bit strange.
88.2	It's a map in which we stretched places,
92.04	so that those areas which contain
92.04	many people are drawn larger,
96.76	and those areas,
96.76	like the Sahara and the Himalayas,
99.72	in which there are few people,
99.72	have been shrunk away.
102.76	Everybody on the planet
102.76	is given an equal amount of space.
107.12	The cities are shown shining bright.
110.68	The lines are showing you
110.68	submarine cables and trade routes.
114.28	And there's one particular line
114.28	that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian
117.96	through past Singapore,
119.68	through the Suez Canal,
121.44	through the Mediterranean
121.44	and round to Rotterdam.
123.8	And it's showing you the route
125.32	of what was the world's
125.32	largest ship just a year ago,
129.28	a ship which was taking
129.28	so many containers of goods
135.32	that when they were unloaded,
137.2	if the lorries had all gone in convoy,
137.2	they would have been 100 kilometers long.
142.68	This is how our world is now connected.
145.44	This is the quantity of stuff
145.44	we are now moving around the world,
151.44	just on one ship, on one voyage,
154.2	in five weeks.
158.32	We've lived in cities
158.32	for a very long time,
161.64	but most of us didn't live in cities.
163.88	This is Çatalhöyük,
163.88	one of the world's first cities.
167.04	At its peak 9,000 years ago,
171.16	people had to walk over the roofs
171.16	of others' houses to get to their home.
178.08	If you look carefully
178.08	at the map of the city,
181.4	you'll see it has no streets,
184.28	because streets are something we invented.
187.76	The world changes.
190	It changes by trial and error.
193.4	We work out slowly and gradually
196.32	how to live in better ways.
199.48	And the world has changed
199.48	incredibly quickly most recently.
205.6	It's only within the last six,
205.6	seven, or eight generations
209.56	that we have actually realized
209.56	that we are a species.
213.84	It's only within the last few decades
217.24	that a map like this could be drawn.
222.24	Again, the underlying map
222.24	is the map of world population,
227.56	but over it, you're seeing arrows
227.56	showing how we spread out of Africa
233.24	with dates showing you
233.24	where we think we arrived
237.04	at particular times.
239.68	I have to redraw this map
239.68	every few months,
243.56	because somebody makes a discovery
243.56	that a particular date was wrong.
248.56	We are learning about ourselves
248.56	at an incredible speed.
255.6	And we're changing.
258.64	A lot of change is gradual.
260.92	It's accretion.
262.44	We don't notice the change
265.32	because we only have short lives,
270.56	This graph is showing you
272.6	the annual rate of population
272.6	growth in the world.
276.12	It was very low until around about 1850,
280.08	and then the rate of population growth
282.72	began to rise
284.84	so that around the time I was born,
286.88	when we first saw those images
286.88	from the moon of our planet,
292.64	our global population
292.64	was growing at two percent a year.
297.44	If it had carried on growing
297.44	at two percent a year
302.6	for just another couple of centuries,
306.56	the entire planet would be covered
308.84	with a seething mass of human bodies
311.92	all touching each other.
315	And people were scared.
316.84	They were scared of population growth
318.68	and what they called
318.68	"""the population bomb"" in 1968."
322.04	But then, if you look
322.04	at the end of the graph,
325.24	the growth began to slow.
328.72	The decade --
330.12	the '70s, the '80s,
330.12	the '90s, the noughties,
333.6	and in this decade, even faster --
336.6	our population growth is slowing.
338.24	Our planet is stabilizing.
339.52	We are heading towards nine,
342.56	by the end of the century.
344.4	Within that change, you can see tumult.
347.76	You can see the Second World War.
349.6	You can see the pandemic
349.6	in 1918 from influenza.
353.8	You can see the great Chinese famine.
356.4	These are the events
356.4	we tend to concentrate on.
358.72	We tend to concentrate
358.72	on the terrible events in the news.
362.68	We don't tend to concentrate
362.68	on the gradual change
366.36	and the good news stories.
369.48	We worry about people.
371.2	We worry about how many people there are.
373.48	We worry about how you can
373.48	get away from people.
377.2	But this is the map of the world
377.2	changed again to make area large,
381.76	the further away
381.76	people are from each area.
386.16	So if you want to know
386.16	where to go to get away from everybody,
390.12	here's the best places to go.
392.72	And every year, these areas get bigger,
395.56	because every year,
395.56	we are coming off the land globally.
398.84	We are moving into the cities.
400.32	We are packing in more densely.
402.52	There are wolves again in Europe,
404.16	and the wolves are moving west
404.16	across the continent.
409.2	Our world is changing.
412.92	You have worries.
415.68	This is a map showing
415.68	where the water falls on our planet.
420.6	We now know that.
422.32	And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,
426.12	where three continents meet,
426.12	Africa, Asia, and Europe,
428.72	and you can see there are
428.72	a large number of people living there
431.72	in areas with very little water.
433.32	And you can see areas in which
433.32	there is a great deal of rainfall as well.
437.04	And we can get a bit more sophisticated.
440.44	Instead of making
440.44	the map be shaped by people,
443.84	we can shape the map by water,
446.08	and then we can change it every month
447.96	to show the amount of water
449.64	falling on every small part of the globe.
453.92	And you see the monsoons
453.92	moving around the planet,
457.24	and the planet almost appears
457.24	to have a heartbeat.
461.72	And all of this only became possible
466.92	within my lifetime
468.72	to see this is where we are living.
472.64	We have enough water.
475.76	This is a map of where
475.76	we grow our food in the world.
481.28	This is the areas that we will rely on
481.28	most for rice and maize and corn.
487.76	People worry that there won't
487.76	be enough food, but we know,
490.64	if we just ate less meat
490.64	and fed less of the crops to animals,
495.44	there is enough food for everybody
497.88	as long as we think of ourselves
497.88	as one group of people.
504.12	And we also know
507.28	about what we do
509.36	so terribly badly nowadays.
513.48	You will have seen this map
513.48	of the world before.
519.48	This is the map
521.44	produced by taking satellite images,
524.84	if you remember those satellites
524.84	around the planet
527.64	in the very first slide I showed,
531.24	and producing an image
531.24	of what the Earth looks like at night.
535.72	When you normally see that map,
537.64	on a normal map, the kind of map
537.64	that most of you will be used to,
542.16	you think you are seeing
542.16	a map of where people live.
546.12	Where the lights are shining up
546.12	is where people live.
549.32	But here, on this image of the world,
553.72	remember we've stretched the map again.
557.32	Everywhere has the same density
557.32	of people on this map.
562.48	If an area doesn't have people,
564.68	we've shrunk it away
566.6	to make it disappear.
568.16	So we're showing everybody
570.32	with equal prominence.
573.32	Now, the lights no longer show you
573.32	where people are,
576.64	because people are everywhere.
579.12	Now the lights on the map,
581.08	the lights in London,
581.08	the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,
584.08	the lights on the Eastern Seaboard
584.08	of the United States,
587.04	the lights show you where people live
590	who are so profligate with energy
593.16	that they can afford
595.68	to spend money
597.24	powering lights to shine up into the sky,
600.72	so satellites can draw an image like this.
604.84	And the areas that are dark on the map
607.72	are either areas where people
607.72	do not have access to that much energy,
612.4	or areas where people do,
614.52	but they have learned to stop
614.52	shining the light up into the sky.
619.96	And if I could show you this map
619.96	animated over time,
623.52	you would see that Tokyo
623.52	has actually become darker,
627.12	because ever since the tsunami in Japan,
630.88	Japan has had to rely
630.88	on a quarter less electricity
633.32	because it turned
633.32	the nuclear power stations off.
637.24	And the world didn't end.
639.4	You just shone less light
641.6	up into the sky.
645.32	There are a huge number
648.32	of good news stories in the world.
651.88	Infant mortality is falling
655.32	and has been falling
655.32	at an incredible rate.
659.92	A few years ago,
662.24	the number of babies dying
662.24	in their first year of life in the world
666.2	fell by five percent in just one year.
671.6	More children are going to school
674.12	and learning to read and write
676.76	and getting connected to the Internet
679.6	and going on to go to university
682.64	than ever before at an incredible rate,
686.56	and the highest number of young people
686.56	going to university in the world
692.04	are women, not men.
695.16	I can give you good news story
695.16	after good news story
699.08	about what is getting
699.08	better in the planet,
701.72	but we tend to concentrate
705.88	on the bad news that is immediate.
708.64	Rebecca Solnit, I think,
708.64	put it brilliantly,
713.16	"when she explained: ""The accretion"
713.16	of incremental, imperceptible changes
718.52	which can constitute progress
718.52	and which render our era
721.36	"dramatically different from the past"" --"
724.2	the past was much more stable --
727.64	"""a contrast obscured by the undramatic"
727.64	nature of gradual transformation,
732.64	"punctuated by occasional tumult."""
736.32	Occasionally, terrible things happen.
739.44	You are shown those terrible things
742.2	on the news every night of the week.
745.88	You are not told about
745.88	the population slowing down.
749.88	You are not told about the world
749.88	becoming more connected.
752.92	You are not told about the incredible
752.92	improvements in understanding.
756.6	You are not told about
756.6	how we are learning to begin
759.76	to waste less and consume less.
762.24	This is my last map.
764.36	On this map, we have taken the seas
766.76	and the oceans out.
769.48	Now you are just looking
771.52	at about 7.4 billion people
775.4	with the map drawn
775.4	in proportion to those people.
779.24	You're looking at over a billion in China,
781.32	and you can see the largest
781.32	city in the world in China,
784.16	but you do not know its name.
787.08	You can see that India
788.96	is in the center of this world.
791.64	You can see that Europe is on the edge.
794.96	And we in Exeter today
798.04	are on the far edge of the planet.
801	We are on a tiny scrap of rock
804	off Europe
805.72	which contains less than one percent
808.36	of the world's adults,
810.4	and less than half a percent
812.96	of the world's children.
815.64	We are living in a stabilizing world,
815.64	an urbanizing world,
820.28	an aging world,
822.28	a connecting world.
824.44	There are many, many things
824.44	to be frightened about,
828.72	but there is no need for us
828.72	to fear each other as much as we do,
833.96	and we need to see
833.96	that we are now living in a new world.
838.96	Thank you very much.
840.2	(Applause)
