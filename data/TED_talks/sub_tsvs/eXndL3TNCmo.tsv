25	There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world
27	and at IDEO this past year,
29	and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
35	I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984
39	but I've been to a lot of them since that time.
41	I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time
45	when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;
48	it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.
51	And so thinking back, I was thinking
54	those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --
60	certainly technological objects.
62	And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you
67	who are in the audience were my clients.
69	We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth
73	and we'd put it on the conference table,
75	"and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would ""ooh"" and ""ah."""
79	That was a really good time.
81	And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.
85	And if you were here last year,
89	I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,
94	which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.
98	And I took a lot of pictures last year;
100	very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.
103	This year -- maybe you could show the slides --
108	this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with
111	and helped Handspring design it.
113	Also, though we designed it a few years ago --
116	it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --
118	this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.
120	Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.
123	Lots of lives are being saved by those.
125	And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product
131	that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.
135	So, we really will continue to focus on products.
138	But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,
142	and that's that people like us --
144	I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,
147	but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of
153	climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --
156	and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,
160	human-centeredness in an approach to design.
165	That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.
170	And I think you're starting to see that,
172	and it's making our job even more enjoyable.
175	Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --
181	you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.
185	Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.
189	But firms like ours are having to move to a point where
192	we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,
196	showing how they'll be used.
198	And so in order to do that we've been forming
202	internal video-production groups
205	in order to make these kind of experience prototypes
208	that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.
212	And it's a much better way to see.
214	It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,
217	as opposed to them being empty.
219	So I thought that I would show you a few videos
223	to show off this new, broader definition
230	of design in products and services and environments.
234	I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute
237	or a minute-and-a-half apiece --
239	but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our
242	work over the last year, and how it responds in video.
247	So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas
250	and OMA to help us conceive the technology
254	that's in their retail store in New York.
257	He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --
259	a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.
264	And that meant actually designing custom technology
268	as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.
273	So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:
275	there's RF tags on the user, on the cards,
278	there's the staff devices that are all around the store.
281	You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,
284	the staff person can scan them in
286	and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.
289	You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.
295	And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --
299	can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,
302	and in the dressing room there are scanners
304	so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.
309	We can put that up on a touch screen
312	and you can play with that, and get more information
314	about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.
319	It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here
323	of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.
327	The last time I went to see this store,
329	there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,
332	"""Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"""
335	But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.
340	So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.
348	And then one of my favorite features of the technology
351	is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.
353	There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --
357	but there's a three second delay.
359	So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.
363	(Applause)
386	About a year and a half ago we were asked to design
390	an installation in the museum --
392	this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,
395	and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.
399	And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,
403	designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.
406	I don't know if anybody's seen this --
407	it's pretty spectacular in the room.
409	Anyway, it's based on the London subway system.
411	And so you can see that
414	the goal is to bring some of the feedback
416	that the people who had gone to the museum were giving,
419	and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.
422	So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,
426	the little trains go around with what you're thinking about.
431	And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.
436	Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --
440	mostly teenagers coming out of there --
442	there's this big open space that has these tables in it
446	that have interactive games which are quite fun,
448	also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.
450	And the topics include things that the museum is about:
456	male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby
459	or what a driverless car might be like.
463	There's lots of room, so people can come up
465	and understand what it is before they get involved.
469	And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.
471	They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,
475	after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits
478	and go off into the atmosphere.
484	The next video is not done by us.
486	This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.
490	Scott Adams ran into us
492	and asked us if we wouldn't help to design
494	the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,
496	which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.
500	He's always been interested in technology in the future.
503	(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be
505	the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.
508	So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together
510	with some of the smartest design guys in the world
512	and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?
515	Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space
518	spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,
523	the team built their own little cubicles
525	to fully experience the problems.
528	Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.
531	Narrator: They took pictures.
532	Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over
535	and you're sort of held captive there for a minute.
537	SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.
541	We'll see what happens.
543	Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens
547	for the computer and for family photos.
550	In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive
554	and actually give Dilbert a group hug.
557	(Laughter)
559	Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)
565	David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting
568	that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.
572	So you feel that in your cubicle.
576	And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase
578	that wilts when you leave in disappointment,
581	and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.
585	(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)
587	DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,
592	or something to be aggressive with to release tension.
596	(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)
599	DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap
602	that stretches across your cubicle.
604	(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)
610	DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate
615	the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.
619	The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,
622	as well as wastewater.
624	So this building actually celebrates the water
627	as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed
630	so that it can be filtered for the final time.
635	The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.
639	In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's
642	kind of wild and crazy and everybody's
644	learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.
647	But it was intended to be quite quiet.
650	And then you would wander around and gather information,
654	in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process
658	and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water
661	once it comes through the plant.
672	And then, if you saw,
674	the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information
677	on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual
680	recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.
690	You can see: there's the plant.
701	These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
705	And we're announcing a new product here tonight,
707	which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
710	It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,
715	started by Nigel Jagger in London.
718	And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,
724	or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people
729	actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water
734	and actually seeing what's there,
736	and enjoying what scuba divers do.
738	This product, it has two cameras.
740	You throw it over the side of your boat
743	and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.
750	For us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface
756	so that the interface doesn't get in your way.
758	You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --
761	of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.
764	And the other one was to design the object
766	and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
771	And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about
773	seven or eight years, this project --
775	and [we're] just ready to start building them.
781	(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.
785	It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,
788	and is equipped with powerful lights.
791	It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
796	The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)
800	DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement
803	and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.
805	(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.
808	Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.
812	You watch the video with superimposed graphics
814	that indicate your depth and compass heading.
818	The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine
820	to help you completely lose yourself underwater.)
844	(Applause)
850	DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,
853	which is a project that I'm very excited about.
856	ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,
859	who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.
862	He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright
865	and he had a very interesting insight, which is that
867	"he said, ""There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;"
871	"there must be entrepreneurs everywhere."""
873	And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there
876	they could find enough money to put something together.
879	So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya
883	with Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.
888	And to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --
891	he's started 19,000 companies.
895	He's made 30,000 new jobs.
898	And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --
903	the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.
909	This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.
912	So we're in the process of helping them design
915	deep-well, low-cost manual pumps
918	in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land
922	to be able to grow crops in the off-season.
924	What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season
926	but they can't grow them in the off-season.
929	And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --
933	she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college
937	and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.
939	So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and
942	very straightforward things that we're designing --
945	my students are doing this as class projects
947	and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --
950	it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.
954	We also were thinking about the experience of Richard,
959	and so --
960	(Laughter)
961	-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day
966	and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.
970	(Laughter)
973	Can you read it?
975	(Laughter)
976	Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.
979	You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,
983	and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.
986	(Laughter)
987	(Applause)
995	So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,
999	and from all the different presenters.
1002	And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,
1006	it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,
1011	that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,
1014	and I think this is great.
1016	Designers are more trusted and more integrated
1018	into the business strategy of companies,
1020	and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design
1026	has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.
