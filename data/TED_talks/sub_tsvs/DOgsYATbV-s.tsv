12.618	When I was born,
14.056	there was really only one book
15.736	about how to raise your children,
17.622	and it was written by Dr. Spock.
20.789	(Laughter)
22.725	Thank you for indulging me.
23.956	I have always wanted to do that.
27.562	No, it was Benjamin Spock,
29.665	"and his book was called ""The Common"
29.665	"Sense Book of Baby And Child Care."""
33.515	It sold almost 50 million copies 
33.515	by the time he died.
39.162	Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old,
42.807	walk into Barnes and Noble,
44.484	and see this.
47.165	And it is amazing
49.124	the variety that one finds 
49.124	on those shelves.
52.828	There are guides to raising 
52.828	an eco-friendly kid,
57.25	a gluten-free kid,
59.445	a disease-proof kid,
61.81	which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.
65.763	There are guides to raising a bilingual kid
68.3	even if you only speak one language at home.
71.151	There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid
74.767	and a science-minded kid
77.529	and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.
80.639	Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse
83.849	a nuclear bomb,
85.199	there is pretty much a guide to everything.
91.705	All of these books are well-intentioned.
94.319	I am sure that many of them are great.
98.829	But taken together, I am sorry,
102.93	I do not see help
105.281	when I look at that shelf.
109.13	I see anxiety.
111.404	I see a giant candy-colored monument
114.131	to our collective panic,
117.074	and it makes me want to know,
119.655	why is it that raising our children
122.038	is associated with so much anguish
123.82	and so much confusion?
126.078	Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens
128.792	about the one thing human beings
131.768	have been doing successfully for millennia,
133.632	long before parenting message boards
136.468	and peer-reviewed studies came along?
139.345	Why is it that so many mothers and fathers
141.998	experience parenthood as a kind of crisis?
148.22	Crisis might seem like a strong word,
150.566	but there is data suggesting it probably isn't.
153.544	There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name,
156.3	"""Parenthood as Crisis,"" published in 1957,"
160.386	and in the 50-plus years since,
162.924	there has been plenty of scholarship
165.01	documenting a pretty clear pattern
167.417	of parental anguish.
169.472	Parents experience more stress than non-parents.
172.778	Their marital satisfaction is lower.
175.694	There have been a number of studies
177.211	looking at how parents feel
178.5	when they are spending time with their kids,
180.917	and the answer often is, not so great.
184.817	Last year, I spoke with a researcher
186.855	named Matthew Killingsworth
188.151	who is doing a very, very imaginative project
191.611	that tracks people's happiness,
193.509	and here is what he told me he found:
197.478	"""Interacting with your friends"
199.092	is better than interacting with your spouse,
202.004	which is better than interacting with other relatives,
205.36	which is better than interacting with acquaintances,
208.585	which is better than interacting with parents,
211.53	which is better than interacting with children.
215.306	"Who are on par with strangers."""
217.306	(Laughter)
221.812	But here's the thing.
224.179	I have been looking at what underlies these data
227.257	for three years,
229.168	and children are not the problem.
232.394	Something about parenting right now at this moment
237.381	is the problem.
239.421	Specifically, I don't think we know
241.91	what parenting is supposed to be.
244.426	Parent, as a verb,
246.606	only entered common usage in 1970.
250.868	Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.
254.19	The roles of our children have changed.
257.031	We are all now furiously improvising
259.373	our way through a situation
261.279	for which there is no script,
264.872	and if you're an amazing jazz musician,
266.913	then improv is great,
269.1	but for the rest of us,
271.505	it can kind of feel like a crisis.
275.321	So how did we get here?
277.901	How is it that we are all now navigating
280.017	a child-rearing universe
281.569	without any norms to guide us?
284.397	Well, for starters, there has been
286.557	a major historical change.
288.396	Until fairly recently,
290.589	kids worked, on our farms primarily,
294.301	but also in factories, mills, mines.
297.169	Kids were considered economic assets.
300.085	Sometime during the Progressive Era,
302.181	we put an end to this arrangement.
303.809	We recognized kids had rights,
306.08	we banned child labor,
307.6	we focused on education instead,
310.37	and school became a child's new work.
313.546	And thank God it did.
315.252	But that only made a parent's role
317.649	more confusing in a way.
319.42	The old arrangement might not have been
320.972	particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.
324.09	We provided food, clothing, shelter,
326.446	and moral instruction to our kids,
328.57	and they in return provided income.
334.21	Once kids stopped working,
336.178	the economics of parenting changed.
339.482	Kids became, in the words of one
342.054	brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist,
345.496	"""economically worthless but emotionally priceless."""
350.258	Rather than them working for us,
352.649	we began to work for them,
354.552	because within only a matter of decades
356.412	it became clear:
357.82	if we wanted our kids to succeed,
360.19	school was not enough.
363.183	Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work,
367.98	but that's work for us too,
369.737	because we are the ones
369.737	driving them to soccer practice.
372.92	Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work,
375.783	but that's also work for us,
377.351	because we have to check it.
379.462	About three years ago, a Texas woman
381.787	told something to me
382.841	that totally broke my heart.
386.12	She said, almost casually,
390.16	"""Homework is the new dinner."""
394.594	The middle class now pours all of its time
397.194	and energy and resources into its kids,
400.636	even though the middle class
401.989	has less and less of those things to give.
405.602	Mothers now spend more time with their children
408.886	than they did in 1965,
411.269	when most women were not even in the workforce.
416.663	It would probably be easier for parents
418.775	to do their new roles
420.166	if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.
423.731	This is yet another thing that
423.731	makes modern parenting
426.175	so very confounding.
428.245	We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any,
431.933	is of use to our kids.
433.69	The world is changing so rapidly,
435.123	it's impossible to say.
437.326	This was true even when I was young.
439.401	When I was a kid, high school specifically,
442.425	I was told that I would be at sea
444.409	in the new global economy
446.194	if I did not know Japanese.
450.7	And with all due respect to the Japanese,
453.202	it didn't turn out that way.
455.643	Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent
457.931	that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin,
460.635	and maybe they're onto something,
463.245	but we cannot know for sure.
465.98	So, absent being able to anticipate the future,
468.609	what we all do, as good parents,
471.234	is try and prepare our kids
473.161	for every possible kind of future,
476.209	hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.
480.266	We teach our kids chess,
482.194	thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.
484.829	We sign them up for team sports,
487.274	thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills,
490.561	you know, for when they go
490.561	to Harvard Business School.
493.081	We try and teach them to be financially savvy
496.31	and science-minded and eco-friendly
499.767	and gluten-free,
502.733	though now is probably a good time to tell you
504.705	that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.
510.245	I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.
515.035	And you know what? I'm doing okay.
517.212	I pay my taxes.
519.625	I hold down a steady job.
522.842	I was even invited to speak at TED.
527.17	But the presumption now is that
528.552	what was good enough for me,
528.552	or for my folks for that matter,
531.95	isn't good enough anymore.
533.761	So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf,
537.425	because we feel like if we aren't trying everything,
540.737	it's as if we're doing nothing
542.867	and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.
548.204	So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles
550.812	as mothers and fathers.
552.334	Now add to this problem something else:
554.78	we are also navigating new roles
556.708	as husbands and wives
558.312	because most women today are in the workforce.
561.96	This is another reason, I think,
563.49	that parenthood feels like a crisis.
565.812	We have no rules, no scripts, no norms
568.462	for what to do when a child comes along
571.002	now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.
574.193	The writer Michael Lewis once put this
576.598	very, very well.
577.835	He said that the surest way
580.347	for a couple to start fighting
582.142	is for them to go out to dinner with another couple
585.17	whose division of labor
586.355	is ever so slightly different from theirs,
589.965	because the conversation in
589.965	the car on the way home
593.641	goes something like this:
596.775	"""So, did you catch that Dave is the one"
601.408	"who walks them to school every morning?"""
605.309	(Laughter)
609.742	Without scripts telling us who does what
612.257	in this brave new world, couples fight,
615.306	and both mothers and fathers each have
618.545	their legitimate gripes.
620.475	Mothers are much more likely
622.33	to be multi-tasking when they are at home,
624.408	and fathers, when they are at home,
626.619	are much more likely to be mono-tasking.
629.578	Find a guy at home, and odds are
632.146	he is doing just one thing at a time.
635.907	In fact, UCLA recently did a study
638.811	looking at the most common configuration
641.344	of family members in middle-class homes.
644.39	Guess what it was?
646.123	Dad in a room by himself.
648.77	According to the American Time Use Survey,
651.21	mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers,
654.435	which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day,
658.034	but I still think that something she wrote
660.3	is highly relevant:
663.172	"""I have not been alone in the"
663.172	"bathroom since October."""
666.89	(Laughter)
671.224	But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty.
676.054	They spend more time with their kids
677.83	than their fathers ever spent with them.
681.164	They work more paid hours, on average,
683.144	than their wives,
684.837	and they genuinely want to be good,
686.671	involved dads.
688.25	Today, it is fathers, not mothers,
691.618	who report the most work-life conflict.
695.729	Either way, by the way,
697.961	if you think it's hard for traditional families
700.296	to sort out these new roles,
701.92	just imagine what it's like now
703.756	for non-traditional families:
705.651	families with two dads, families with two moms,
708.246	single-parent households.
709.951	They are truly improvising as they go.
714.344	Now, in a more progressive country,
718.135	and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché
720.865	and invoking, yes, Sweden,
723.919	parents could rely on the state
726.84	for support.
729.489	There are countries that acknowledge
731.368	the anxieties and the changing roles
732.801	of mothers and fathers.
735.165	Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them,
738.429	so in case you were wondering what the U.S.
740.394	has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia,
745.697	it's this:
748.728	We too have no paid maternity leave policy.
752.455	We are one of eight known countries that does not.
759.702	In this age of intense confusion,
763.273	there is just one goal upon which
766.675	all parents can agree,
768.507	and that is whether they are
769.971	tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones,
774.537	our kids' happiness is paramount.
778.678	That is what it means
780.56	to raise kids in an age
783.01	when they are economically worthless
785.235	but emotionally priceless.
787.48	We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.
790.88	The one mantra no parent ever questions is,
794.713	"""All I want is for my children to be happy."""
800.444	And don't get me wrong:
802.157	I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.
807.037	But it is a very elusive one.
810.743	Happiness and self-confidence,
814.683	teaching children that is not like teaching them
816.664	how to plow a field.
818.18	It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.
820.881	There's no curriculum for it.
823.438	Happiness and self-confidence can
823.438	be the byproducts of other things,
827.035	but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.
830.09	A child's happiness
831.756	is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.
835.521	And happiness is an even more unfair burden
838.359	to place on a kid.
841.199	And I have to tell you,
843.222	I think it leads to some very strange excesses.
847.104	We are now so anxious
849.506	to protect our kids from the world's ugliness
852.824	"that we now shield them from ""Sesame Street."""
857.576	I wish I could say I was kidding about this,
859.712	but if you go out and you buy
862.384	"the first few episodes of ""Sesame Street"" on DVD,"
865.323	as I did out of nostalgia,
868.404	you will find a warning at the beginning
871.517	saying that the content is not suitable
874.147	for children.
875.915	(Laughter)
878.025	Can I just repeat that?
879.23	"The content of the original ""Sesame Street"""
881.861	is not suitable for children.
885.203	When asked about this by The New York Times,
888.845	a producer for the show gave
888.845	a variety of explanations.
892.15	One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe
894.909	in one skit and then swallowed it.
896.67	Bad modeling. I don't know.
898.105	But the thing that stuck with me
901.087	is she said that she didn't know
903.542	whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today
907.881	because he was too depressive.
912.779	I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.
915.187	(Laughter)
916.706	You are looking at a woman
918.559	who has a periodic table of the Muppets
921.603	hanging from her cubicle wall.
925.395	The offending muppet, right there.
930.239	That's my son the day he was born.
935.025	I was high as a kite on morphine.
937.217	I had had an unexpected C-section.
941.08	But even in my opiate haze,
944.596	I managed to have one very clear thought
947.529	the first time I held him.
950.481	I whispered it into his ear.
952.385	"I said, ""I will try so hard not to hurt you."""
961.269	It was the Hippocratic Oath,
962.589	and I didn't even know I was saying it.
966.467	But it occurs to me now
968.791	that the Hippocratic Oath
970.87	is a much more realistic aim than happiness.
975.202	In fact, as any parent will tell you,
978.802	it's awfully hard.
981.57	All of us have said or done hurtful things
986.424	that we wish to God we could take back.
992.398	I think in another era
995.246	we did not expect quite so much from ourselves,
999.238	and it is important that we all remember that
1002.92	the next time we are staring with our hearts racing
1006.754	at those bookshelves.
1012.254	I'm not really sure how to create new norms
1015.508	for this world,
1017.186	but I do think that
1020.27	in our desperate quest to create happy kids,
1023.588	we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.
1026.615	It strikes me as a better goal,
1028.333	and, dare I say, a more virtuous one,
1030.549	to focus on making productive kids
1033.268	and moral kids,
1034.608	and to simply hope that happiness will come to them
1036.924	by virtue of the good that they do
1039.67	and their accomplishments
1041.898	and the love that they feel from us.
1044.796	That, anyway, is one response to having no script.
1050.429	Absent having new scripts,
1053.762	we just follow the oldest ones in the book --
1057.447	decency, a work ethic, love —
1063.046	and let happiness and self-esteem
1063.046	take care of themselves.
1067.37	I think if we all did that,
1069.414	the kids would still be all right,
1072.955	and so would their parents,
1075.601	possibly in both cases even better.
1079.569	Thank you.
1081.448	(Applause)
