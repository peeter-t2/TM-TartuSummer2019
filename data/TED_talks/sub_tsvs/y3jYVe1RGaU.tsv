16.534	What is going to be the future of learning?
21.95	I do have a plan,
24.23	but in order for me to tell you what that plan is,
27.31	I need to tell you a little story,
30.28	which kind of sets the stage.
33.126	I tried to look at
34.913	where did the kind of learning we do in schools,
38.32	where did it come from?
40.59	And you can look far back into the past,
43.022	but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is,
46.835	it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
50.537	It came from about 300 years ago,
54.485	and it came from the last
56.702	"and the biggest of the empires on this planet. [""The British Empire""]"
59.67	Imagine trying to run the show,
62.015	trying to run the entire planet,
64.423	without computers, without telephones,
68.247	with data handwritten on pieces of paper,
72.379	and traveling by ships.
75.929	But the Victorians actually did it.
78.083	What they did was amazing.
81.251	They created a global computer
84.563	made up of people.
87.619	It's still with us today.
89.412	It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
95.391	In order to have that machine running,
98.718	you need lots and lots of people.
101.919	They made another machine to produce those people:
106.278	the school.
109.174	The schools would produce the people
111.951	who would then become parts of the
115.8	bureaucratic administrative machine.
119.185	They must be identical to each other.
123.575	They must know three things:
125.732	They must have good handwriting, because the data is handwritten;
128.772	they must be able to read;
130.927	and they must be able to do multiplication,
133.206	division, addition and subtraction in their head.
136.869	They must be so identical that you could pick one up from New Zealand
140.396	and ship them to Canada
142.731	and he would be instantly functional.
146.812	The Victorians were great engineers.
149.681	They engineered a system that was so robust
153.17	that it's still with us today,
155.625	continuously producing identical people
159.601	for a machine that no longer exists.
164.417	The empire is gone,
167.345	so what are we doing with that design
170.249	that produces these identical people,
172.618	and what are we going to do next
175.521	if we ever are going to do anything else with it?
179.441	"[""Schools as we know them are obsolete""]"
181.131	So that's a pretty strong comment there.
183.023	I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.
186.817	I'm not saying they're broken.
188.551	It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
191.548	It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
195.199	It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
201.425	What are the kind of jobs that we have today?
203.832	Well, the clerks are the computers.
205.966	They're there in thousands in every office.
208.497	And you have people who guide those computers
211.702	to do their clerical jobs.
214.179	Those people don't need to be able to write beautifully by hand.
217.443	They don't need to be able to multiply numbers in their heads.
220.475	They do need to be able to read.
222.747	In fact, they need to be able to read discerningly.
226.897	Well, that's today, but we don't even know
230.004	what the jobs of the future are going to look like.
232.563	We know that people will work from wherever they want,
235.207	whenever they want, in whatever way they want.
238.405	How is present-day schooling going to prepare them
242.593	for that world?
245.136	Well, I bumped into this whole thing completely by accident.
250.184	I used to teach people how to write computer programs
252.816	in New Delhi, 14 years ago.
255.28	And right next to where I used to work, there was a slum.
259.037	And I used to think, how on Earth are those kids
261.624	ever going to learn to write computer programs?
264.144	Or should they not?
267.224	At the same time, we also had lots of parents,
269.841	rich people, who had computers,
272.272	"and who used to tell me, ""You know, my son,"
275.403	I think he's gifted,
277.592	because he does wonderful things with computers.
280.466	"And my daughter -- oh, surely she is extra-intelligent."""
284.442	And so on. So I suddenly figured that,
286.55	how come all the rich people are having
288.346	these extraordinarily gifted children?
290.487	(Laughter)
292.402	What did the poor do wrong?
295.226	I made a hole in the boundary wall
298.229	of the slum next to my office,
300.261	and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen
303.005	if I gave a computer to children who never would have one,
305.989	didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.
309.325	The children came running in.
310.277	"It was three feet off the ground, and they said, ""What is this?"""
312.447	"And I said, ""Yeah, it's, I don't know."""
315.431	(Laughter)
317.647	"They said, ""Why have you put it there?"""
320.203	"I said, ""Just like that."""
321.418	"And they said, ""Can we touch it?""I said, ""If you wish to."""
324.427	And I went away.
326.804	About eight hours later,
328.548	we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse.
331.503	"So I said, ""Well that's impossible, because --"
334	"How is it possible? They don't know anything."""
337.541	"My colleagues said, ""No, it's a simple solution."
340.405	One of your students must have been passing by,
343.228	"showed them how to use the mouse."""
345.323	"So I said, ""Yeah, that's possible."""
346.846	So I repeated the experiment. I went 300 miles out of Delhi
349.905	into a really remote village
351.896	where the chances of a passing software development engineer
355.688	was very little. (Laughter)
360.104	I repeated the experiment there.
362.767	There was no place to stay, so I stuck my computer in,
365.054	I went away, came back after a couple of months,
367.254	found kids playing games on it.
368.949	When they saw me, they said,
369.9	"""We want a faster processor and a better mouse."""
372.382	(Laughter)
376.676	"So I said, ""How on Earth do you know all this?"""
380.085	And they said something very interesting to me.
382.54	In an irritated voice, they said,
384.205	"""You've given us a machine that works only in English,"
386.758	"so we had to teach ourselves English in order to use it."" (Laughter)"
392.843	That's the first time, as a teacher,
394.82	"that I had heard the word ""teach ourselves"" said so casually."
399.911	Here's a short glimpse from those years.
403.513	That's the first day at the Hole in the Wall.
406.16	On your right is an eight-year-old.
408.398	To his left is his student. She's six.
414.118	And he's teaching her how to browse.
417.715	Then onto other parts of the country,
421.001	I repeated this over and over again,
423.284	getting exactly the same results that we were.
426.729	"[""Hole in the wall film - 1999""]"
430.656	An eight-year-old telling his elder sister what to do.
439.72	And finally a girl explaining in Marathi what it is,
445.277	"and said, ""There's a processor inside."""
449.526	So I started publishing.
452.019	I published everywhere. I wrote down and measured everything,
454.574	and I said, in nine months, a group of children
456.776	left alone with a computer in any language
459.474	will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the West.
463.989	I'd seen it happen over and over and over again.
468.749	But I was curious to know, what else would they do
471.481	if they could do this much?
473.721	I started experimenting with other subjects,
476.249	among them, for example, pronunciation.
479.217	There's one community of children in southern India
481.665	whose English pronunciation is really bad,
484.433	and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs.
487.953	I gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer,
492.031	"and I said, ""Keep talking into it until it types what you say."""
495.305	(Laughter)
499.937	They did that, and watch a little bit of this.
505.121	Computer: Nice to meet you.Child: Nice to meet you.
510.633	Sugata Mitra: The reason I ended with the face
512.904	of this young lady over there is because I suspect many of you know her.
516.721	She has now joined a call center in Hyderabad
520.217	and may have tortured you about your credit card bills
524.939	in a very clear English accent.
529.712	So then people said, well, how far will it go?
534.089	Where does it stop?
535.659	I decided I would destroy my own argument
539.022	by creating an absurd proposition.
541.526	I made a hypothesis, a ridiculous hypothesis.
545.414	Tamil is a south Indian language, and I said,
547.218	can Tamil-speaking children in a south Indian village
549.863	learn the biotechnology of DNA replication in English
553.368	from a streetside computer?
555.615	And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.
557.8	I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months,
560.854	I'll go back, they'll get another zero.
563.158	I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
567.514	I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.
571.577	I put in Hole in the Wall computers there,
574.254	downloaded all kinds of stuff from the Internet about DNA replication,
577.941	most of which I didn't understand.
581.246	"The children came rushing, said, ""What's all this?"""
584.223	"So I said, ""It's very topical, very important. But it's all in English."""
589.231	"So they said, ""How can we understand such big English words"
592.585	"and diagrams and chemistry?"""
594.663	So by now, I had developed a new pedagogical method,
597.487	"so I applied that. I said, ""I haven't the foggiest idea."""
600.371	(Laughter)
603.566	"""And anyway, I am going away."""
606.516	(Laughter)
610.884	So I left them for a couple of months.
614.473	They'd got a zero. I gave them a test.
617.108	I came back after two months
618.032	"and the children trooped in and said, ""We've understood nothing."""
621.692	"So I said, ""Well, what did I expect?"""
623.767	"So I said, ""Okay, but how long did it take you"
627.852	"before you decided that you can't understand anything?"""
630.613	"So they said, ""We haven't given up."
632.561	"We look at it every single day."""
634.537	"So I said, ""What? You don't understand these screens"
637.002	"and you keep staring at it for two months? What for?"""
639.706	So a little girl who you see just now,
642.219	she raised her hand, and she says to me in broken Tamil and English,
644.951	"she said, ""Well, apart from the fact that"
647.148	improper replication of the DNA molecule causes disease,
650.299	"we haven't understood anything else."""
652.82	(Laughter) (Applause)
658.532	So I tested them.
662.652	I got an educational impossibility, zero to 30 percent
665.924	in two months in the tropical heat
668.228	with a computer under the tree in a language they didn't know
671.668	doing something that's a decade ahead of their time.
674.74	Absurd. But I had to follow the Victorian norm.
680.117	Thirty percent is a fail.
683.517	How do I get them to pass? I have to get them 20 more marks.
686.453	I couldn't find a teacher. What I did find was a friend that they had,
691.29	a 22-year-old girl who was an accountant
693.676	and she played with them all the time.
696.124	"So I asked this girl, ""Can you help them?"""
698.245	"So she says, ""Absolutely not."
700.516	I didn't have science in school. I have no idea
703.593	"what they're doing under that tree all day long. I can't help you."""
708.122	"I said, ""I'll tell you what. Use the method of the grandmother."""
712.653	"So she says, ""What's that?"""
713.983	"I said, ""Stand behind them."
715.37	Whenever they do anything, you just say,
716.992	'Well, wow, I mean, how did you do that?
719.789	What's the next page? Gosh, when I was your age, I could have never done that.'
722.885	"You know what grannies do."""
725.807	So she did that for two more months.
727.981	The scores jumped to 50 percent.
730.895	Kallikuppam had caught up
732.549	with my control school in New Delhi,
734.427	a rich private school with a trained biotechnology teacher.
738.563	When I saw that graph I knew there is a way to level the playing field.
743.4	Here's Kallikuppam.
745.496	(Children speaking) Neurons ... communication.
753.691	I got the camera angle wrong. That one is just amateur stuff,
757.382	but what she was saying, as you could make out,
759.878	was about neurons, with her hands were like that,
762.285	and she was saying neurons communicate.
765.841	At 12.
769.185	So what are jobs going to be like?
772.395	Well, we know what they're like today.
774.686	What's learning going to be like? We know what it's like today,
777.024	children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand
780.077	and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand.
783.85	What will it be tomorrow?
787.809	Could it be that we don't need to go to school at all?
792.709	Could it be that, at the point in time when you need to know something,
796.249	you can find out in two minutes?
799.569	Could it be -- a devastating question,
803.674	a question that was framed for me by Nicholas Negroponte --
806.466	could it be that we are heading towards or maybe in
809.505	a future where knowing is obsolete?
812.865	But that's terrible. We are homo sapiens.
815.398	Knowing, that's what distinguishes us from the apes.
819.315	But look at it this way.
821.092	It took nature 100 million years
823.638	to make the ape stand up
825.774	and become Homo sapiens.
827.958	It took us only 10,000 to make knowing obsolete.
831.654	What an achievement that is.
833.836	But we have to integrate that into our own future.
837.863	Encouragement seems to be the key.
840.822	If you look at Kuppam,
842.032	if you look at all of the experiments that I did,
844.846	"it was simply saying, ""Wow,"" saluting learning."
851.981	There is evidence from neuroscience.
854.375	The reptilian part of our brain, which sits in the center of our brain,
857.577	when it's threatened, it shuts down everything else,
861.313	it shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the parts which learn,
864.991	it shuts all of that down.
867.735	Punishment and examinations are seen as threats.
871.883	We take our children, we make them shut their brains down,
875.508	"and then we say, ""Perform."""
878.204	Why did they create a system like that?
881.685	Because it was needed.
883.331	There was an age in the Age of Empires
885.916	when you needed those people who can survive under threat.
890.186	When you're standing in a trench all alone,
892.453	if you could have survived, you're okay, you've passed.
896.484	If you didn't, you failed.
899.457	But the Age of Empires is gone.
902.113	What happens to creativity in our age?
905.751	We need to shift that balance back
908.766	from threat to pleasure.
912.175	I came back to England looking for British grandmothers.
916.127	I put out notices in papers saying,
919.144	if you are a British grandmother, if you have broadband and a web camera,
922.564	can you give me one hour of your time per week for free?
925.791	I got 200 in the first two weeks.
927.903	I know more British grandmothers than anyone in the universe. (Laughter)
932.811	They're called the Granny Cloud.
936.626	The Granny Cloud sits on the Internet.
938.356	If there's a child in trouble, we beam a Gran.
942.73	She goes on over Skype and she sorts things out.
946.299	I've seen them do it from a village called Diggles
949.918	in northwestern England,
951.963	deep inside a village in Tamil Nadu, India,
955.267	6,000 miles away.
957.507	She does it with only one age-old gesture.
961.083	"""Shhh."""
962.798	Okay?
965.523	Watch this.
967.059	Grandmother: You can't catch me. You say it.
971.315	You can't catch me.
975.083	Children: You can't catch me.
978.051	Grandmother: I'm the Gingerbread Man.Children: I'm the Gingerbread Man.
983.633	Grandmother: Well done! Very good.
988.223	SM: So what's happening here?
990.681	I think what we need to look at is
992.525	we need to look at learning
994.906	as the product of educational self-organization.
999.494	If you allow the educational process to self-organize,
1002.339	then learning emerges.
1004.83	It's not about making learning happen.
1007.223	It's about letting it happen.
1009.439	The teacher sets the process in motion
1012.712	and then she stands back in awe
1015.431	and watches as learning happens.
1017.799	I think that's what all this is pointing at.
1020.752	But how will we know? How will we come to know?
1023.504	Well, I intend to build
1025.179	these Self-Organized Learning Environments.
1028.48	They are basically broadband, collaboration
1032.165	and encouragement put together.
1034.558	I've tried this in many, many schools.
1036.264	It's been tried all over the world, and teachers
1038.799	"sort of stand back and say, ""It just happens by itself?"""
1042.425	"And I said, ""Yeah, it happens by itself.""""How did you know that?"""
1045.542	"I said, ""You won't believe the children who told me"
1049.035	"and where they're from."""
1051.963	Here's a SOLE in action.
1054.707	(Children talking)
1060.816	This one is in England.
1067.105	He maintains law and order,
1070.871	because remember, there's no teacher around.
1081.356	Girl: The total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons -- SM: Australia
1085.259	Girl: -- giving it a net positive or negative electrical charge.
1091.994	The net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons
1095.578	in the ion minus the number of electrons.
1098.871	SM: A decade ahead of her time.
1101.92	So SOLEs, I think we need a curriculum of big questions.
1105.523	You already heard about that. You know what that means.
1107.729	There was a time when Stone Age men and women
1111.13	used to sit and look up at the sky and say,
1113.234	"""What are those twinkling lights?"""
1115.713	They built the first curriculum, but we've lost sight of those wondrous questions.
1120.507	We've brought it down to the tangent of an angle.
1124.637	But that's not sexy enough.
1128.345	The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say,
1131.306	"""If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth,"
1134.459	"how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"""
1137.857	"And if he says, ""Well, what? how?"""
1140.417	"you say, ""There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle,"""
1143.402	and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
1146.273	So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
1150.731	I've tried incredible, incredible questions --
1156.32	"""When did the world begin? How will it end?"" —"
1160.608	to nine-year-olds.
1162.553	This one is about what happens to the air we breathe.
1165.529	This is done by children without the help of any teacher.
1170.487	The teacher only raises the question,
1172.871	and then stands back and admires the answer.
1176.535	So what's my wish?
1180.271	My wish is
1182.487	that we design the future of learning.
1186.801	We don't want to be spare parts
1188.767	for a great human computer, do we?
1191.159	So we need to design a future for learning.
1194.815	And I've got to -- hang on,
1196.451	I've got to get this wording exactly right,
1199.151	because, you know, it's very important.
1201.795	My wish is to help design a future of learning
1204.111	by supporting children all over the world
1206.345	to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
1209.391	Help me build this school.
1211.623	It will be called the School in the Cloud.
1214.959	It will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures
1220.032	driven by the big questions which their mediators put in.
1223.889	The way I want to do this
1226.16	is to build a facility where I can study this.
1230.52	It's a facility which is practically unmanned.
1233.32	There's only one granny
1235.087	who manages health and safety.
1237.528	The rest of it's from the cloud.
1238.961	The lights are turned on and off by the cloud,
1240.876	etc., etc., everything's done from the cloud.
1242.904	But I want you for another purpose.
1246.129	You can do Self-Organized Learning Environments
1248.888	at home, in the school, outside of school, in clubs.
1253.904	It's very easy to do. There's a great document
1256.032	produced by TED which tells you how to do it.
1257.92	If you would please, please do it
1261.296	across all five continents
1263.661	and send me the data,
1265.872	then I'll put it all together, move it into the School of Clouds,
1269.376	and create the future of learning.
1272.64	That's my wish.
1274.432	And just one last thing.
1275.855	I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas.
1278.448	At 12,000 feet, where the air is thin,
1281.751	I once built two Hole in the Wall computers,
1284.736	and the children flocked there.
1286.191	And there was this little girl who was following me around.
1289.088	"And I said to her, ""You know, I want to give a computer to everybody, every child."
1293.804	"I don't know, what should I do?"""
1296.205	And I was trying to take a picture of her quietly.
1300.236	She suddenly raised her hand like this, and said to me,
1304.292	"""Get on with it."""
1306.181	(Laughter) (Applause)
1318.045	I think it was good advice.
1319.906	I'll follow her advice. I'll stop talking.
1321.974	Thank you. Thank you very much.
1325.964	(Applause)
1329.715	Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
1338.039	Thank you very much. Wow. (Applause)
