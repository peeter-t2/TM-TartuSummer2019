12.587	Humanity takes center stage at TED,
15.65	but I would like to add 
15.65	a voice for the animals,
19.313	whose bodies and minds 
19.313	and spirits shaped us.
25.112	Some years ago, it was my good fortune
28.358	to meet a tribal elder on an island
30.306	not far from Vancouver.
32.86	His name is Jimmy Smith,
35.238	and he shared a story with me
37.487	that is told among his people,
39.84	who call themselves the Kwikwasut'inuxw.
43.035	Once upon a time, he told me,
45.73	all animals on Earth were one.
48.587	Even though they look different on the outside,
51.511	inside, they're all the same,
54.751	and from time to time they would gather
57.406	at a sacred cave deep inside the forest
60.156	to celebrate their unity.
62.648	When they arrived,
64.392	they would all take off their skins.
66.92	Raven shed his feathers, bear his fur,
70.444	and salmon her scales,
72.907	and then, they would dance.
75.829	But one day, a human made it to the cave
79.13	and laughed at what he saw
80.714	because he did not understand.
83.838	Embarrassed, the animals fled,
86.707	and that was the last time
88.934	they revealed themselves this way.
92.556	The ancient understanding that underneath
95.24	their separate identities, all animals are one,
98.143	has been a powerful inspiration to me.
101.881	I like to get past the fur, the feathers
104.944	and the scales.
106.573	I want to get under the skin.
108.801	No matter whether I'm facing a giant elephant
111.601	or a tiny tree frog,
113.749	my goal is to connect us with them, eye to eye.
120.641	You may wonder, do I ever photograph people?
123.78	Sure. People are always present in my photos,
127.615	no matter whether they appear
129.742	to portray tortoises
132.561	or cougars
134.374	or lions.
136.253	You just have to learn how 
136.253	to look past their disguise.
140.751	As a photographer,
142.485	I try to reach beyond the differences
145.3	in our genetic makeup
147.264	to appreciate all we have in common
150.861	with every other living thing.
154.239	When I use my camera,
156.568	I drop my skin
158.491	like the animals at that cave
161.191	so I can show who they really are.
165.128	As animals blessed
167.378	with the power of rational thought,
170.752	we can marvel at the intricacies of life.
175.285	As citizens of a planet in trouble,
178.121	it is our moral responsibility
180.685	to deal with the dramatic loss in diversity of life.
186.24	But as humans with hearts,
188.107	we can all rejoice in the unity of life,
192.04	and perhaps we can change
194.88	what once happened in that sacred cave.
198.76	Let's find a way to join the dance.
203.992	Thank you.
206.775	(Applause)
