12.58	This is a picture of a sunset on Mars
15.42	taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.
19.78	Mars is a very cold planet,
21.66	flooded with high levels of UV radiation
23.94	and extremely dry.
25.86	In fact, Mars is considered
25.86	to be too dry for life as we know it.
30.78	I'm an astrobiologist.
32.02	I try to understand
32.02	the origin of life on Earth
34.94	and the possibilities of finding life
37.18	elsewhere in the universe.
39.22	People sometimes ask me,
40.5	how can you be an astrobiologist
42.7	if you don't have your own spaceship?
45.46	Well, what I do is that I study life
47.7	in those environments on Earth
49.7	that most closely resemble
49.7	other interesting places in the universe.
53.94	All life on Earth requires water,
56.42	so in my case I focus
56.42	on the intimate relationship
58.98	between water and life
60.5	in order to understand
62.1	if we could find life
62.1	in a planet as dry as Mars.
66.26	But since I do not have
66.26	the 2.5 billion dollars
69.82	to send my own robot to Mars,
72.06	I study the most Martian place on Earth,
75.02	the Atacama Desert.
76.58	Located in northern Chile,
78.26	it is the oldest
78.26	and driest desert on Earth.
81.9	To give you an idea of how dry it is,
83.9	consider here in Vancouver it rains
83.9	over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.
89.7	In the Atacama, there are places
89.7	with no reported rains
93.34	in the last 400 years.
96.7	How do I know this?
98.42	Well, because I was born
98.42	and raised in the Atacama --
101.94	(Laughter)
103.58	So I had a unique advantage
105.62	when I started studying this desert.
108.7	So let me tell you guys
108.7	a few fantastic examples
112.26	he has found
113.94	on how life has adapted
113.94	to live with almost no water at all.
118.46	One of my first findings
118.46	was in the entrance of a cave
121.06	facing the Pacific Ocean.
122.82	In this place, we reported
122.82	a new type of microalgae
126.54	that grew only on top of the spiderwebs
126.54	that covered the cave entrance.
131.06	Have you ever seen a spiderweb
131.06	early in the morning?
135.02	It's covered with dew,
136.62	so this microalgae learned
136.62	that in order to carry photosynthesis
139.9	in the coast of the driest
139.9	desert on Earth,
142.94	they could use the spiderwebs.
144.46	So here they may access
144.46	the water from the fogs
146.9	that regularly cover
146.9	these areas in the morning.
150.46	In another cave, we found
150.46	a different type of microalgae.
153.94	This one is able to use ocean mist
153.94	as a source of water,
158.18	and strikingly lives
158.18	in the very bottom of a cave,
161.34	so it has adapted to live
161.34	with less than 0.1 percent
164.58	of the amount of light
164.58	that regular plants need.
168.82	These type of findings
168.82	suggest to me that on Mars,
171.86	we may find even
171.86	photosynthetic life inside caves.
174.74	And by the way, that's me.
176.14	(Laughter)
178.98	Now, for almost 15 years
178.98	this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,
184.74	was thought to be
184.74	the driest place of this desert,
187.78	but I knew that it was not.
189.54	How? You already know the answer.
191.94	Because I was born
191.94	and raised in this desert.
194.18	So I remembered that I
194.18	usually see fogs in Yungay,
198.86	so after setting sensors
198.86	in a number of places,
201.1	where I remember
201.1	never seeing fogs or clouds,
204.18	I reported four other sites
204.18	much drier than Yungay,
208.22	with this one, Mar√≠a Elena South,
210.86	being the truly driest place on Earth,
214.34	as dry as Mars,
216.34	and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride
218.7	from the small mining town
218.7	where I was born.
221.82	Now, in this search, we were trying
221.82	to actually find the dry limit
225.26	for life on Earth,
226.5	a place so dry that nothing
226.5	was able to survive in it.
230.38	But even here, well hidden underground,
232.98	we found a number
232.98	of different microorganisms,
235.42	which suggested to me
235.42	that similarly dry places, like Mars,
238.9	may be in inhabited.
241.18	We even have some preliminary evidences
243.5	that these microorganisms
243.5	may still be active
246.06	in the desiccated state,
248.02	like walking mummies all around us,
251.86	and that they may be using
251.86	UV radiation as a source of energy.
256.7	If confirmed, this would have
256.7	a huge impact on our definition of life,
261.3	on how we look for life
261.3	elsewhere in the universe.
264.58	Due to its clear skies, by 2020,
	telescopes on Earth
270.3	will be located in the Atacama,
272.54	and while everyone else
272.54	will be looking among the stars
275.46	"to answer the question, ""Are we alone?"""
278.62	I will be looking down to the ground
280.54	searching for this same answer
283.14	in my own backyard.
284.78	Thank you.
286.02	(Applause)
