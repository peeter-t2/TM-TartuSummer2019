15.855	Radical openness is still a distant future
18.975	in the field of school education.
21.271	We have such a hard time figuring out
23.16	that learning is not a place but an activity.
27.381	But I want to tell you the story of PISA,
30.852	OECD's test to measure the knowledge and skills
33.23	of 15-year-olds around the world,
34.859	and it's really a story of how international comparisons
39.381	have globalized the field of education that we usually treat
42.656	as an affair of domestic policy.
45.591	Look at how the world looked in the 1960s,
48.015	in terms of the proportion of people
49.846	who had completed high school.
52.586	You can see the United States ahead of everyone else,
56.406	and much of the economic success of the United States
59.119	draws on its long-standing advantage
61.863	as the first mover in education.
64.735	But in the 1970s, some countries caught up.
67.958	In the 1980s, the global expansion
70.647	of the talent pool continued.
73.243	And the world didn't stop in the 1990s.
76.943	So in the '60s, the U.S. was first.
78.967	In the '90s, it was 13th,
81.903	and not because standards had fallen,
84.304	but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere.
88.059	Korea shows you what's possible in education.
91.589	Two generations ago, Korea had the standard of living
94.534	of Afghanistan today,
96.965	and was one of the lowest education performers.
101.106	Today, every young Korean finishes high school.
106.658	So this tells us that, in a global economy,
109.634	it is no longer national improvement that's the benchmark for success,
114.215	but the best performing education systems internationally.
119.396	The trouble is that
121.839	measuring how much time people spend in school
123.709	or what degree they have got is not always
125.733	a good way of seeing what they can actually do.
130.757	Look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets,
134.43	while employers say they cannot find the people
136.624	with the skills they need.
140.423	And that tells you that better degrees don't automatically translate
144.087	into better skills and better jobs and better lives.
148.457	So with PISA, we try to change this
151.066	by measuring the knowledge and skills
152.937	of people directly.
156.373	And we took a very special angle to this.
158.271	We were less interested in whether students can simply
160.753	reproduce what they have learned in school,
163.854	but we wanted to test whether they can extrapolate
166.57	from what they know
168.483	and apply their knowledge in novel situations.
172.362	Now, some people have criticized us for this.
175.194	They say, you know, such a way of measuring outcomes
177.141	is terribly unfair to people, because we test students
179.953	with problems they haven't seen before.
182.926	But if you take that logic, you know,
184.967	you should consider life unfair, because
187.895	the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember
191.084	what we learned in school,
192.204	but whether we are prepared for change,
195.525	whether we are prepared for jobs that haven't been created,
197.946	to use technologies that haven't been invented,
200.292	to solve problems we just can't anticipate today.
205.209	And once hotly contested,
207.394	our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard.
210.831	In our latest assessment in 2009,
213.073	we measured 74 school systems
216.485	that together cover 87 percent of the economy.
220.072	This chart shows you the performance of countries.
223.746	In red, sort of below OECD average.
226.633	Yellow is so-so, and in green are the countries doing really well.
230.009	You can see Shanghai, Korea, Singapore in Asia;
234.363	Finland in Europe;
236.053	Canada in North America doing really well.
240.419	You can also see that there is a gap of almost
242.86	three and a half school years between
248.305	and the gap grows to seven school years
251.01	when you include the countries with really poor performance.
254.633	There's a world of difference in the way in which
257.104	young people are prepared for today's economy.
262.306	But I want to introduce a second important dimension
265.852	into this picture.
268.073	Educators like to talk about equity.
272.448	With PISA, we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity,
276.158	in terms of ensuring that people
278.385	from different social backgrounds have equal chances.
281.825	And we see that in some countries, the impact
283.56	of social background on learning outcomes
285.439	is very, very strong.
286.577	Opportunities are unequally distributed.
289.495	A lot of potential of young children is wasted.
293.11	We see in other countries that it matters much less
296.178	into which social context you're born.
299.671	We all want to be there, in the upper right quadrant,
302.066	where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed.
306.562	Nobody, and no country, can afford to be there,
309.233	where performance is poor
310.614	and there are large social disparities.
313.959	And then we can debate, you know, is it better
316.114	to be there, where performance is strong
317.913	at the price of large disparities?
320.873	Or do we want to focus on equity and accept mediocrity?
326.492	But actually, if you look at how countries come out on this picture,
329.474	you see there are a lot of countries that actually
332.217	are combining excellence with equity.
336.985	In fact, one of the most important lessons from this comparison
339.593	is that you don't have to compromise equity
342.699	to achieve excellence.
345.546	These countries have moved on from providing excellence
347.985	for just some to providing excellence for all,
351.254	a very important lesson.
353.226	And that also challenges the paradigms of many school systems
358.202	that believe they are mainly there to sort people.
362.505	And ever since those results came out, policymakers,
365.017	educators, researchers from around the world
366.994	have tried to figure out
368.355	what's behind the success of those systems.
371.785	But let's step back for a moment
373.609	and focus on the countries that actually started PISA,
376.623	and I'm giving them a colored bubble now.
379.169	And I'm making the size of the bubble
382.661	proportional
384.203	to the amount of money that countries spent on students.
387.998	If money would tell you everything
389.55	about the quality of learning outcomes,
391.629	you would find all the large bubbles at the top, no?
394.96	But that's not what you see.
397.505	Spending per student only explains about,
399.81	well, less than 20 percent
402.106	of the performance variation among countries,
405.624	and Luxembourg, for example, the most expensive system,
407.914	doesn't do particularly well.
410.378	What you see is that two countries with similar spending
412.754	achieve very different results.
414.674	You also see -- and I think that's one of the most encouraging findings --
418.923	that we no longer live in a world that is neatly divided
422.512	between rich and well-educated countries,
425.202	and poor and badly-educated ones,
427.522	a very, very important lesson.
431.117	Let's look at this in greater detail.
433.699	The red dot shows you
435.505	spending per student relative to a country's wealth.
439.962	One way you can spend money is by paying teachers well,
442.769	and you can see Korea investing a lot
445.274	in attracting the best people into the teaching profession.
448.298	And Korea also invests into long school days,
450.224	which drives up costs further.
452.98	Last but not least, Koreans want their teachers
455.12	not only to teach but also to develop.
457.4	They invest in professional development and collaboration
459.735	and many other things.
461.815	All that costs money.
463.456	How can Korea afford all of this?
466.126	The answer is, students in Korea learn in large classes.
469.866	This is the blue bar which is driving costs down.
474.334	You go to the next country on the list, Luxembourg,
477.229	and you can see the red dot is exactly where it is for Korea,
480.332	so Luxembourg spends the same per student as Korea does.
483.865	But, you know, parents and teachers and policymakers
486.759	in Luxembourg all like small classes.
489.206	You know, it's very pleasant to walk into a small class.
491.974	So they have invested all their money into there,
493.878	and the blue bar, class size, is driving costs up.
497.224	But even Luxembourg can spend its money only once,
501.385	and the price for this is that
503.59	teachers are not paid particularly well.
505.694	Students don't have long hours of learning.
508.373	And basically, teachers have little time to do anything else than teaching.
511.615	So you can see two countries spent their money very differently,
515.296	and actually how they spent their money
517.616	matters a lot more than how much they invest in education.
523.619	Let's go back to the year 2000.
526.173	Remember, that was the year before the iPod was invented.
530.168	This is how the world looked then
532.292	in terms of PISA performance.
536.553	The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
539.368	We spent a lot less on education,
540.999	about 35 percent less on education.
543.071	So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive,
546.816	has it become so much better?
550.169	And the bitter truth really is that, you know,
553.168	not in many countries.
555.613	But there are some countries which have seen
557.696	impressive improvements.
560.644	Germany, my own country, in the year 2000,
564.44	featured in the lower quadrant,
566.328	below average performance, large social disparities.
569.493	And remember, Germany, we used to be one of those countries
571.496	that comes out very well when you just count people who have degrees.
575.224	Very disappointing results.
576.985	People were stunned by the results.
579.722	And for the very first time, the public debate in Germany
583.513	was dominated for months by education,
587.219	not tax, not other kinds of issues, but education
589.953	was the center of the public debate.
592.504	And then policymakers began to respond to this.
595.723	The federal government dramatically raised its investment in education.
599.953	A lot was done to increase the life chances of students
603.582	with an immigrant background or from social disadvantage.
606.544	And what's really interesting is that this wasn't just about
611.052	optimizing existing policies,
614.811	but data transformed some of the beliefs and paradigms
618.224	underlying German education.
620.011	For example, traditionally, the education of the very young children
623.897	was seen as the business of families, and you would have cases
626.515	where women were seen as neglecting their family responsibilities
629.547	when they sent their children to kindergarten.
632.635	PISA has transformed that debate,
635.283	and pushed early childhood education right at the center
638.056	of public policy in Germany.
640.448	Or traditionally, the German education divides children
644.149	at the age of 10, very young children,
646.897	between those deemed to pursue careers of knowledge workers
651.086	and those who would end up working for the knowledge workers,
654.436	and that mainly along socioeconomic lines,
656.912	and that paradigm is being challenged now too.
661.08	A lot of change.
663.564	And the good news is, nine years later,
666.518	you can see improvements in quality and equity.
669.617	People have taken up the challenge, done something about it.
671.893	Or take Korea, at the other end of the spectrum.
674.021	In the year 2000, Korea did already very well,
676.566	but the Koreans were concerned that only a small share
679.891	of their students achieved the really high levels of excellence.
684.25	They took up the challenge,
686.064	and Korea was able to double the proportion of students
689.598	achieving excellence in one decade in the field of reading.
694	Well, if you only focus on your brightest students,
696.553	you know what happens is disparities grow,
698.472	and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction,
702.272	but still, an impressive improvement.
704.983	A major overhaul of Poland's education
707.569	helped to dramatically reduce between variability among schools,
711.202	turn around many of the lowest-performing schools,
713.896	and raise performance by over half a school year.
718.73	And you can see other countries as well.
720.521	Portugal was able to consolidate its fragmented school system,
723.464	raise quality and improve equity,
726.456	and so did Hungary.
728.332	So what you can actually see, there's been a lot of change.
731.763	And even those people who complain and say that
734.696	the relative standing of countries
736.385	on something like PISA is just an artifact of culture,
739.807	of economic factors, of social issues,
742.849	of homogeneity of societies, and so on,
745.911	these people must now concede that education improvement is possible.
750.753	You know, Poland hasn't changed its culture.
753.793	It didn't change its economy. It didn't change
756.297	the compositions of its population.
758.389	It didn't fire its teachers. It changed its education policies
761.243	and practice. Very impressive.
763.883	And all that raises, of course, the question: What can we learn
766.848	from those countries in the green quadrant
768.952	who have achieved high levels of equity,
771.227	high levels of performance, and raised outcomes?
774.959	And, of course, the question is, can what works in one context
778.873	provide a model elsewhere?
781.589	Of course, you can't copy and paste education systems wholesale,
784.919	but these comparisons have identified a range of factors
788.846	that high-performing systems share.
792.167	Everybody agrees that education is important.
794.727	Everybody says that.
796.714	But the test of truth is, how do you weigh that priority
799.969	against other priorities?
802.265	How do countries pay their teachers
804.278	relative to other highly skilled workers?
807.383	Would you want your child to become a teacher
809.868	rather than a lawyer?
811.98	How do the media talk about schools and teachers?
813.982	Those are the critical questions, and what we have learned
816.487	from PISA is that, in high-performing education systems,
820.581	the leaders have convinced their citizens to make choices
824.131	that value education, their future,
826.509	more than consumption today.
829.181	And you know what's interesting? You won't believe it,
831.227	but there are countries in which the most attractive place
834.213	to be is not the shopping center but the school.
837.133	Those things really exist.
839.4	But placing a high value on education
841.373	is just part of the picture.
844.224	The other part is the belief that all children
847.253	are capable of success.
850.688	You have some countries where students
852.449	are segregated early in their ages.
854.688	You know, students are divided up,
856.734	reflecting the belief that only some children
859.069	can achieve world-class standards.
862.621	But usually that is linked to very strong social disparities.
866.676	If you go to Japan in Asia, or Finland in Europe,
870.06	parents and teachers in those countries
872.166	expect every student to succeed,
876.077	and you can see that actually mirrored in student behavior.
879.569	When we asked students what counts
882.285	for success in mathematics,
885.021	students in North America would typically tell us,
887.413	you know, it's all about talent.
888.959	If I'm not born as a genius in math, I'd better study something else.
893.585	Nine out of 10 Japanese students say
896.311	that it depends on my own investment, on my own effort,
900.557	and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them.
905.292	In the past, different students were taught in similar ways.
910.101	High performers on PISA embrace diversity
913.433	with differentiated pedagogical practices.
917.181	They realize that
919.157	ordinary students have extraordinary talents,
922.301	and they personalize learning opportunities.
925.661	High-performing systems also share
927.697	clear and ambitious standards across the entire spectrum.
931.303	Every student knows what matters.
933.505	Every student knows what's required to be successful.
937.592	And nowhere does the quality of an education system
940.457	exceed the quality of its teachers.
942.9	High-performing systems are very careful
945.968	in how they recruit and select their teachers
948.102	and how they train them.
949.823	They watch how they improve the performances of teachers
952.653	in difficulties who are struggling,
954.973	and how they structure teacher pay.
957.882	They provide an environment also in which teachers work together
961.578	to frame good practice.
965.135	And they provide intelligent pathways for teachers to grow
969.296	in their careers.
971.411	In bureaucratic school systems,
973.035	teachers are often left alone in classrooms
975.028	with a lot of prescription on what they should be teaching.
978.195	High-performing systems are very clear what good performance is.
981.405	They set very ambitious standards, but then they enable
984.179	their teachers to figure out,
985.956	what do I need to teach to my students today?
990.071	The past was about delivered wisdom in education.
994.617	Now the challenge is to enable user-generated wisdom.
999.859	High performers have moved on from professional
1003.499	or from administrative forms of accountability and control --
1007.163	sort of, how do you check whether people do what they're supposed to do in education --
1010.4	to professional forms of work organization.
1014.066	They enable their teachers to make innovations in pedagogy.
1017.938	They provide them with the kind of development they need
1020.428	to develop stronger pedagogical practices.
1024.49	The goal of the past was standardization and compliance.
1030.148	High-performing systems have made teachers
1032.882	and school principals inventive.
1036.168	In the past, the policy focus was on outcomes,
1038.867	on provision.
1041.049	The high-performing systems have helped teachers
1043.852	and school principals to look outwards to the next teacher,
1046.293	the next school around their lives.
1048.986	And the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems
1051.152	is that they achieve high performance across the entire system.
1054.299	You've seen Finland doing so well on PISA,
1056.496	but what makes Finland so impressive
1058.186	is that only five percent of the performance variation
1062.163	amongst students lies between schools.
1064.619	Every school succeeds.
1066.935	This is where success is systemic.
1069.666	And how do they do that?
1071.37	They invest resources where they can make the most difference.
1074.062	They attract the strongest principals into the toughest schools,
1079.17	and the most talented teachers
1081.378	into the most challenging classroom.
1083.321	Last but not least, those countries align policies
1086.45	across all areas of public policy.
1088.67	They make them coherent over sustained periods of time,
1091.803	and they ensure that what they do is consistently implemented.
1096.506	Now, knowing what successful systems are doing
1098.81	doesn't yet tell us how to improve.
1101.601	That's also clear, and that's where some of the limits
1104.059	of international comparisons of PISA are.
1107.534	That's where other forms of research need to kick in,
1110.237	and that's also why PISA doesn't venture into
1112.695	telling countries what they should be doing.
1114.455	But its strength lies in telling them
1116.278	what everybody else has been doing.
1119.033	And the example of PISA shows that data
1121.229	can be more powerful than administrative control of financial subsidy
1124.547	through which we usually run education systems.
1128.488	You know, some people argue that
1131.526	changing educational administration
1133.714	is like moving graveyards.
1136.155	You just can't rely on the people out there to help you with this. (Laughter)
1141.042	But PISA has shown what's possible in education.
1145.909	It has helped countries to see that improvement is possible.
1149.714	It has taken away excuses from those who are complacent.
1153.922	And it has helped countries to set meaningful targets
1157.355	in terms of measurable goals achieved by the world's leaders.
1160.453	If we can help every child, every teacher, every school,
1165.003	every principal, every parent see what improvement is possible,
1168.658	that only the sky is the limit to education improvement,
1171.394	we have laid the foundations
1173.29	for better policies and better lives.
1175.473	Thank you.
1178.006	(Applause)
