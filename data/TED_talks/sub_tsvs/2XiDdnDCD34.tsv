12	Ten years ago exactly,
14	I was in Afghanistan.
16	I was covering the war in Afghanistan,
20	and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,
23	the amount of suffering and destruction
26	that emerged out of a war like that.
29	Then, two years later,
31	I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.
33	I was placed at the center of that war
36	because I was covering the war
38	from the northern part of Iraq.
41	And the war ended
43	with a regime change,
45	like the one in Afghanistan.
47	And that regime
49	that we got rid of
51	was actually a dictatorship,
54	an authoritarian regime,
56	that for decades
59	created a great sense of paralysis
63	within the nation, within the people themselves.
66	However,
68	the change that came through foreign intervention
70	created even worse circumstances for the people
73	and deepened the sense
75	of paralysis and inferiority
77	in that part of the world.
79	For decades,
81	we have lived under authoritarian regimes --
84	in the Arab world, in the Middle East.
87	These regimes
89	created something within us during this period.
92	I'm 43 years old right now.
94	For the last 40 years,
96	I have seen almost the same faces
98	for kings and presidents ruling us --
102	old, aged, authoritarian,
106	corrupt situations --
108	regimes that we have seen around us.
111	And for a moment I was wondering,
114	are we going to live in order to see
116	real change happening on the ground,
119	a change that does not come through foreign intervention,
122	through the misery of occupation,
125	through nations invading our land
128	and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?
132	The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,
135	but when they saw
137	their land occupied by foreign forces
140	they felt very sad,
142	they felt that their dignity had suffered.
145	And this is why they revolted.
147	This is why they did not accept.
150	And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,
153	"""Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?"
156	Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?
159	Would you like to see destruction?
161	"Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"""
164	And the people thought for themselves,
166	"""Maybe we should live with"
168	this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,
171	"instead of having the second scenario."""
175	That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.
178	For 10 years,
180	unfortunately we have found ourselves
182	reporting images of destruction,
185	images of killing,
187	of sectarian conflicts,
189	images of violence,
191	emerging from a magnificent piece of land,
194	a region that one day was the source
196	of civilizations and art and culture
199	for thousands of years.
202	Now I am here to tell you
205	that the future
207	that we were dreaming for
209	has eventually arrived.
213	A new generation,
215	well-educated,
217	connected,
219	inspired by universal values
223	and a global understanding,
226	has created a new reality for us.
230	We have found a new way
233	to express our feelings
236	and to express our dreams:
239	these young people
241	who have restored self-confidence
243	in our nations in that part of the world,
246	who have given us
248	new meaning for freedom
251	and empowered us to go down to the streets.
254	Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.
256	Just step out of your house,
258	raise your voice
260	"and say, ""We would like to see the end of the regime."""
264	This is what happened in Tunisia.
266	Over a few days,
268	the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars
271	in the security agencies,
273	billions of dollars
275	in maintaining, trying to maintain,
277	its prisons,
279	collapsed, disappeared,
281	because of the voices of the public.
284	People who were inspired to go down to the streets
286	and to raise their voices,
288	they tried to kill.
290	The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.
293	They found something called Facebook.
296	They found something called Twitter.
298	They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.
300	And they said,
302	"""These kids are misled."""
305	Therefore, they asked their parents
307	to go down to the streets
309	and collect them, bring them back home.
311	This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.
313	"""Bring these kids home"
315	"because they are misled."""
317	But yes,
319	these youth
321	who have been inspired
323	by universal values,
325	who are idealistic enough
327	to imagine a magnificent future
329	and, at the same time, realistic enough
332	to balance this kind of imagination
335	and the process leading to it --
338	not using violence,
340	not trying to create chaos --
342	these young people,
344	they did not go home.
346	Parents actually went to the streets
348	and they supported them.
350	And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.
353	We in Al Jazeera
355	were banned from Tunisia for years,
358	and the government did not allow
360	any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.
362	But we found that these people in the street,
365	all of them are our reporters,
367	feeding our newsroom
369	with pictures, with videos
371	and with news.
373	And suddenly that newsroom in Doha
376	became a center
378	that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --
381	people who are connected and people who have ambition
384	and who have liberated themselves
386	from the feeling of inferiority.
388	And then we took that decision:
391	We are unrolling the news.
393	We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.
396	We are going to spread the message.
398	Yes, some of these young people
400	are connected to the Internet,
402	but the connectivity in the Arab world
404	is very little, is very small,
406	because of many problems that we are suffering from.
409	But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people
412	and we amplified [it].
414	We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --
417	and internationally, globally,
419	through our English channel.
421	And then people started to feel
424	that there's something new happening.
427	And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali
430	decided to leave.
432	And then Egypt started,
434	and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.
436	And now Libya as you see it.
438	And then you have Yemen.
440	And you have many other countries trying to see
442	and to rediscover that feeling
445	"of, ""How do we imagine a future"
447	"which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"""
450	I want to tell you something,
453	that the Internet and connectivity
457	has created [a] new mindset.
460	But this mindset
462	has continued to be faithful
464	to the soil and to the land
466	that it emerged from.
469	And while this was the major difference
472	between many initiatives before
475	to create change,
477	before we thought, and governments told us --
479	and even sometimes it was true --
482	that change was imposed on us,
485	and people rejected that,
487	because they thought that it is alien to their culture.
490	Always, we believed
493	that change will spring from within,
496	that change should be a reconciliation
500	with culture, cultural diversity,
503	with our faith in our tradition
505	and in our history,
507	but at the same time,
509	open to universal values, connected with the world,
512	tolerant to the outside.
514	And this is the moment
516	that is happening right now in the Arab world.
518	This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment
521	that we see all of these meanings meet together
523	and then create the beginning
525	of this magnificent era
527	that will emerge from the region.
531	How did the elite deal with that --
533	the so-called political elite?
536	In front of Facebook,
539	they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.
542	In front of Al Jazeera,
544	they started creating tribalism.
548	And then when they failed,
550	they started speaking about conspiracies
553	that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington
556	in order to divide the Arab world.
559	They started telling the West,
561	"""Be aware of Al-Qaeda."
563	Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.
565	These are Islamists
567	trying to create new Imaras.
569	Be aware of these people
571	who [are] coming to you
574	"in order to ruin your great civilization."""
577	Fortunately,
580	people right now cannot be deceived.
582	Because this corrupt elite
585	in that region
587	has lost even the power of deception.
591	They could not, and they cannot, imagine
593	how they could really deal with this reality.
596	They have lost.
598	They have been detached
600	from their people, from the masses,
603	and now we are seeing them collapsing
606	one after the other.
609	Al Jazeera is not
612	a tool of revolution.
614	We do not create revolutions.
616	However,
618	when something of that magnitude happens,
621	we are at the center of the coverage.
624	We were banned from Egypt,
626	and our correspondents,
628	some of them were arrested.
631	But most of our camera people
634	and our journalists,
636	they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --
639	to report what happened in Tahrir Square.
642	For 18 days,
644	our cameras were broadcasting, live,
647	the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.
650	I remember one night
652	when someone phoned me on my cellphone --
654	ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.
656	"He told me, ""We appeal to you"
658	not to switch off the cameras.
660	If you switch off the cameras tonight,
662	there will be a genocide.
664	You are protecting us
666	"by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."""
669	I felt the responsibility
671	to phone our correspondents there
673	and to phone our newsroom
675	"and to tell them, ""Make your best"
677	not to switch off the cameras at night,
679	because the guys there really feel confident
682	when someone is reporting their story --
684	"and they feel protected as well."""
687	So we have a chance
690	to create a new future
692	in that part of the world.
694	We have a chance
697	to go and to think of the future
700	as something which is open to the world.
703	Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,
706	of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.
708	Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --
711	from thinking about that part of the world
713	based on oil interest,
716	or based on interests
719	of the illusion of stability and security.
722	The stability and security
725	of authoritarian regimes
728	cannot create
730	but terrorism and violence and destruction.
732	Let us accept the choice of the people.
735	Let us not pick and choose
737	who we would like to rule their future.
740	The future should be ruled
742	by people themselves,
744	even sometimes if they are voices
746	that might now scare us.
748	But the values of democracy
751	and the freedom of choice
753	that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time
756	is the best opportunity for the world,
758	for the West and the East,
760	to see stability and to see security
763	and to see friendship and to see tolerance
766	emerging from the Arab world,
768	rather than the images of violence and terrorism.
771	Let us support these people.
773	Let us stand for them.
775	And let us give up
777	our narrow selfishness
780	in order to embrace change,
782	and in order to celebrate with the people of that region
785	a great future
787	and hope and tolerance.
790	The future has arrived,
792	and the future is now.
794	I thank you very much.
796	(Applause)
809	Thank you very much.
811	(Applause)
816	Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.
818	Thank you for coming here.
820	How would you characterize the historical significance
822	of what's happened?
824	Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade
827	or something more?
829	Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.
832	We have covered many wars.
834	We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,
836	a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,
839	because we were centered at the middle of it.
841	But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.
845	It is not something that you only cover
848	because you have to cover a great incident.
851	You are witnessing change in history.
854	You are witnessing the birth of a new era.
857	And this is what the story's all about.
859	CA: There are a lot of people in the West
861	who are still skeptical,
863	or think this may just be an intermediate stage
866	before much more alarming chaos.
869	You really believe
871	that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,
874	that a government could emerge
876	that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?
879	WK: And people actually,
881	after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,
884	the youth who have organized themselves
886	in certain groups and councils,
889	they are guarding the transformation
892	and they are trying to put it on a track
894	in order to satisfy
896	the values of democracy,
898	but at the same time
900	also to make it reasonable
902	and to make it rational,
904	not to go out of order.
907	In my opinion, these people are much more wiser
910	than, not only the political elite,
912	even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders
915	including political parties.
917	At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world
920	are much more wiser
922	and capable of creating the change
924	than the old --
926	including the political and cultural
928	and ideological
930	old regimes.
932	(Applause)
935	CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.
938	What should people here at TED,
941	here in the West,
943	do if they want to connect or make a difference
946	and they believe in what's happening here?
948	WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --
950	that people care,
952	people care about this great transformation.
955	Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,
957	the head of Aljazeera.net,
960	he told me that a 2,500 percent increase
965	of accessing our website
967	from various parts of the world.
969	Fifty percent of it is coming from America.
971	Because we discovered that people care,
973	and people would like to know --
975	they are receiving the stream through our Internet.
978	Unfortunately in the United States,
980	we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time
983	for Al Jazeera English.
985	But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate
988	through connecting ourselves
990	with those people in the street
992	and expressing our support to them
995	and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,
999	of supporting the weak and the oppressed
1002	to create a much better future for all of us.
1005	CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,
1008	TEDxCairo,
1010	are meeting as we speak.
1012	They've had some speakers there.
1014	I believe they've heard your talk.
1016	Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.
1018	Thank you so much.
1020	(Applause)
