12.76	I'd like to try something new.
15.2	Those of you who are able,
16.76	please stand up.
20.48	OK, so I'm going to name some names.
24.08	When you hear a name
24.08	that you don't recognize,
26.48	you can't tell me anything about them,
28.36	I'd like you to take a seat
30.16	and stay seated.
32.24	The last person standing,
32.24	we're going to see what they know. OK?
35.88	(Laughter)
37.48	All right.
39.16	Eric Garner.
42.48	Mike Brown.
47.16	Tamir Rice.
51.76	Freddie Gray.
56.24	So those of you who are still standing,
58.16	I'd like you to turn around
58.16	and take a look.
60.28	I'd say half to most of the people
60.28	are still standing.
64.92	So let's continue.
67.64	Michelle Cusseaux.
75.72	Tanisha Anderson.
82.4	Aura Rosser.
87.56	Meagan Hockaday.
90.76	So if we look around again,
92.24	there are about four people
92.24	still standing,
95.28	and actually I'm not going
95.28	to put you on the spot.
98	I just say that to encourage transparency,
98	so you can be seated.
101.6	(Laughter)
104.56	So those of you who recognized
104.56	the first group of names know
107.8	that these were African-Americans
107.8	who have been killed by the police
111.72	over the last two and a half years.
115.16	What you may not know
116.44	is that the other list
116.44	is also African-Americans
121.88	who have been killed
121.88	within the last two years.
127.68	Only one thing distinguishes
127.68	the names that you know
131.68	from the names that you don't know:
134.32	gender.
136.72	So let me first let you know
136.72	that there's nothing at all distinct
142.56	about this audience
144.36	that explains the pattern of recognition
144.36	that we've just seen.
148.2	I've done this exercise
148.2	dozens of times around the country.
152.72	I've done it to women's
152.72	rights organizations.
155.32	I've done it with civil rights groups.
157.48	I've done it with professors.
157.48	I've done it with students.
160.48	I've done it with psychologists.
160.48	I've done it with sociologists.
164.76	I've done it even with
164.76	progressive members of Congress.
168.28	And everywhere, the awareness
168.28	of the level of police violence
172.6	that black women experience
174.52	is exceedingly low.
177.6	Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
177.6	that this would be the case.
181.2	I mean, there are two issues
181.2	involved here.
183.24	There's police violence
183.24	against African-Americans,
186.36	and there's violence against women,
188.44	two issues that have been
188.44	talked about a lot lately.
192.12	But when we think about
192.12	who is implicated by these problems,
198.12	when we think about
198.12	who is victimized by these problems,
201.64	the names of these black women
201.64	never come to mind.
205.68	Now, communications experts tell us
208.44	that when facts do not fit
208.44	with the available frames,
212.92	people have a difficult time
212.92	incorporating new facts
216.68	into their way of thinking
216.68	about a problem.
221.04	These women's names
221.04	have slipped through our consciousness
224.36	because there are no frames
224.36	for us to see them,
227.8	no frames for us to remember them,
230.12	no frames for us to hold them.
233.48	As a consequence,
235.72	reporters don't lead with them,
238.32	policymakers don't think about them,
241.4	and politicians aren't encouraged
241.4	or demanded that they speak to them.
247.8	Now, you might ask,
249.44	why does a frame matter?
251.04	I mean, after all,
252.88	an issue that affects black people
252.88	and an issue that affects women,
258.2	wouldn't that necessarily include
258.2	black people who are women
262.28	and women who are black people?
265.52	Well, the simple answer is that this is
265.52	a trickle-down approach to social justice,
270.8	and many times it just doesn't work.
274.28	Without frames that allow us to see
276.8	how social problems impact
276.8	all the members of a targeted group,
281.56	many will fall through the cracks
281.56	of our movements,
284.8	left to suffer in virtual isolation.
289.36	But it doesn't have to be this way.
294.08	Many years ago, I began to use
294.08	"the term ""intersectionality"""
299.24	to deal with the fact
299.24	that many of our social justice problems
303.36	like racism and sexism
305.28	are often overlapping,
308	creating multiple levels
308	of social injustice.
313.24	Now, the experience
313.24	that gave rise to intersectionality
318.44	was my chance encounter
318.44	with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.
324.24	Emma DeGraffenreid
324.24	was an African-American woman,
328.08	a working wife and a mother.
330.8	I actually read about Emma's story
330.8	from the pages of a legal opinion
336.24	written by a judge
336.24	who had dismissed Emma's claim
340.4	of race and gender discrimination
342.52	against a local car manufacturing plant.
347.44	Emma, like so many African-American women,
351.2	sought better employment
351.2	for her family and for others.
355	She wanted to create a better life
355	for her children and for her family.
359.44	But she applied for a job,
361.68	and she was not hired,
363.4	and she believed that she was not hired
363.4	because she was a black woman.
367.8	Now, the judge in question
367.8	dismissed Emma's suit,
372.44	and the argument
372.44	for dismissing the suit was
375.04	that the employer
375.04	did hire African-Americans
379.4	and the employer hired women.
383.36	The real problem, though, that the judge
383.36	was not willing to acknowledge
387.44	was what Emma was actually trying to say,
390.64	that the African-Americans
390.64	that were hired,
393.56	usually for industrial jobs,
393.56	maintenance jobs, were all men.
399.32	And the women that were hired,
401.24	usually for secretarial
401.24	or front-office work,
404.88	were all white.
406.84	Only if the court was able to see
406.84	how these policies came together
411.48	would he be able to see
411.48	the double discrimination
415.16	that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.
418.96	But the court refused to allow Emma
418.96	to put two causes of action together
424.48	to tell her story
425.88	because he believed that,
425.88	by allowing her to do that,
429.84	she would be able
429.84	to have preferential treatment.
433.8	She would have an advantage
433.8	by having two swings at the bat,
439.04	when African-American men and white women
439.04	only had one swing at the bat.
444.36	But of course, neither
444.36	African-American men or white women
449.48	needed to combine a race
449.48	and gender discrimination claim
454.08	to tell the story of the discrimination
454.08	they were experiencing.
459.28	Why wasn't the real unfairness
462.52	law's refusal to protect
462.52	African-American women
466.68	simply because their experiences
466.68	weren't exactly the same
470.8	as white women and African-American men?
475.28	Rather than broadening the frame
475.28	to include African-American women,
480.56	the court simply tossed their case
480.56	completely out of court.
486.08	Now, as a student
486.08	of antidiscrimination law,
490.08	as a feminist,
491.56	as an antiracist,
493.96	I was struck by this case.
497.2	It felt to me like injustice squared.
501.88	So first of all,
504	black women weren't allowed
504	to work at the plant.
507.52	Second of all, the court
507.52	doubled down on this exclusion
511.64	by making it legally inconsequential.
515.48	And to boot, there was
515.48	no name for this problem.
519.6	And we all know that,
519.6	where there's no name for a problem,
523.12	you can't see a problem,
524.4	and when you can't see a problem,
524.4	you pretty much can't solve it.
530.159	Many years later, I had come to recognize
532.799	that the problem that Emma was facing
532.799	was a framing problem.
539.16	The frame that the court was using
541.12	to see gender discrimination
541.12	or to see race discrimination
546.12	was partial, and it was distorting.
550	For me, the challenge that I faced was
552.8	trying to figure out whether
552.8	there was an alternative narrative,
557.64	a prism that would allow us
557.64	to see Emma's dilemma,
562.36	a prism that would allow us
562.36	to rescue her from the cracks in the law,
568.32	that would allow judges to see her story.
573	So it occurred to me,
574.92	maybe a simple analogy to an intersection
579.96	might allow judges
579.96	to better see Emma's dilemma.
584.84	So if we think about this intersection,
584.84	the roads to the intersection would be
589.72	the way that the workforce
589.72	was structured by race and by gender.
596.48	And then the traffic in those roads
596.48	would be the hiring policies
600.88	and the other practices
600.88	that ran through those roads.
605.44	Now, because Emma
605.44	was both black and female,
610.4	she was positioned precisely
610.4	where those roads overlapped,
615.76	experiencing the simultaneous impact
620	of the company's gender and race traffic.
625.4	The law -- the law is
625.4	like that ambulance that shows up
631.2	and is ready to treat Emma
631.2	only if it can be shown
634.64	that she was harmed
634.64	on the race road or on the gender road
639.28	but not where those roads intersected.
643.92	So what do you call
643.92	being impacted by multiple forces
649.2	and then abandoned to fend for yourself?
653.72	Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.
658.12	I would go on to learn
658.12	that African-American women,
662.8	like other women of color,
664.76	like other socially marginalized people
664.76	all over the world,
668.84	were facing all kinds
668.84	of dilemmas and challenges
672.84	as a consequence of intersectionality,
675.96	intersections of race and gender,
679.56	of heterosexism, transphobia,
679.56	xenophobia, ableism,
684.8	all of these social dynamics come together
689.4	and create challenges
689.4	that are sometimes quite unique.
695.04	But in the same way
696.88	that intersectionality
699.2	raised our awareness to the way
699.2	that black women live their lives,
705.28	it also exposes the tragic circumstances
709.44	under which African-American women die.
714.24	Police violence against black women
718.12	is very real.
720.08	The level of violence
720.08	that black women face
722.6	is such that it's not surprising
725.64	that some of them do not survive
725.64	their encounters with police.
731.2	Black girls as young as seven,
734.68	great grandmothers as old as 95
739.52	have been killed by the police.
741.96	They've been killed in their living rooms,
744.76	in their bedrooms.
746.8	They've been killed in their cars.
749.8	They've been killed on the street.
751.76	They've been killed
751.76	in front of their parents
754.64	and they've been killed
754.64	in front of their children.
758.12	They have been shot to death.
761.08	They have been stomped to death.
763.96	They have been suffocated to death.
766.56	They have been manhandled to death.
769.52	They have been tasered to death.
773.16	They've been killed
773.16	when they've called for help.
777.56	They've been killed when they were alone,
780.68	and they've been killed
780.68	when they were with others.
784.88	They've been killed shopping while black,
788.52	driving while black,
791.4	having a mental disability while black,
795.12	having a domestic disturbance while black.
799.2	They've even been killed
799.2	being homeless while black.
804.2	They've been killed
804.2	talking on the cell phone,
806.84	laughing with friends,
809.24	sitting in a car reported as stolen
812.32	and making a U-turn
812.32	in front of the White House
815.96	with an infant strapped
815.96	in the backseat of the car.
820.04	Why don't we know these stories?
824.64	Why is it that their lost lives
828.44	don't generate the same amount
828.44	of media attention and communal outcry
833.2	as the lost lives
833.2	of their fallen brothers?
837.8	It's time for a change.
843.04	So what can we do?
846.8	In 2014, the African-American
846.8	Policy Forum began to demand
852.2	"that we ""say her name"""
856.36	at rallies, at protests,
859.96	at conferences, at meetings,
862.64	anywhere and everywhere
865.28	that state violence against black bodies
865.28	is being discussed.
870.8	But saying her name is not enough.
873.48	We have to be willing to do more.
876.08	We have to be willing to bear witness,
879.32	to bear witness
879.32	to the often painful realities
882.96	that we would just rather not confront,
885.72	the everyday violence and humiliation
885.72	that many black women have had to face,
892.2	black women across color,
894.6	age, gender expression,
897.04	sexuality and ability.
901.04	So we have the opportunity right now --
905.24	bearing in mind that some of the images
905.24	that I'm about to share with you
909.28	may be triggering for some --
912	to collectively bear witness
912	to some of this violence.
918.12	We're going to hear the voice
918.12	of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.
923.16	And as we sit with these women,
926.76	some who have experienced violence
926.76	and some who have not survived them,
933.28	we have an opportunity
934.92	to reverse what happened
934.92	at the beginning of this talk,
938.68	when we could not stand for these women
941.4	because we did not know their names.
945.64	So at the end of this clip,
945.64	there's going to be a roll call.
950.56	Several black women's names will come up.
954.8	I'd like those of you who are able
954.8	to join us in saying these names
959.76	as loud as you can,
962.16	randomly, disorderly.
964.92	Let's create a cacophony of sound
968.6	to represent our intention
971.48	to hold these women up,
974.32	to sit with them,
975.96	to bear witness to them,
978.64	to bring them into the light.
988.16	(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,
995.36	say her name.
1002.64	Say,
1010.08	say her name.
1014.28	(Audience) Shelly!
1016.6	(Audience) Kayla!
1017.84	AD: Oh,
1025.68	say her name.
1031.88	(Audience shouting names)
1034.44	Say, say,
1041.76	say her name.
1049.16	Say her name.
1054.68	For all the names
1057.56	I'll never know,
1064.68	say her name.
1067.8	KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,
1067.8	Janisha Fonville,
1070.6	Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,
1072.96	Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,
1075.84	Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.
1080.88	AD: Say her name.
1091.04	KC: So I said at the beginning,
1093.92	if we can't see a problem,
1097.8	we can't fix a problem.
1100.56	Together, we've come together
1100.56	to bear witness
1104	to these women's lost lives.
1107.16	But the time now is to move
1109.64	from mourning and grief
1112.16	to action and transformation.
1116.12	This is something that we can do.
1119.44	It's up to us.
1122.84	Thank you for joining us.
1124.76	Thank you.
1126	(Applause)
