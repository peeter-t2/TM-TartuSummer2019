16.267	In my previous life, I was an artist.
19.754	I still paint. I love art.
22.227	I love the joy that color can give to our lives
27.826	and to our communities,
30.474	and I try to bring something of the artist in me
35.753	in my politics,
37.874	and I see
41.802	part of my job today, the reason for being here,
46.986	not just to campaign for my party,
51.913	but for politics, and the role it can play
56.618	for the better in our lives.
60.434	For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
66.306	We faced many challenges.
68.998	Art was part of the answer,
71.482	and my name, in the very beginning,
74.1	was linked with two things:
76.515	demolition of illegal constructions
80.608	in order to get public space back,
84.688	and use of colors in order to revive the hope
88.366	that had been lost in my city.
91.685	But this use of colors was not just an artistic act.
97.546	Rather, it was a form of political action
101.662	in a context when the city budget I had available
106.764	after being elected amounted to zero comma something.
113.471	When we painted the first building,
116.462	by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray
121.014	of a facade,
123.278	something unimaginable happened.
127.502	There was a traffic jam
129.572	and a crowd of people gathered
132.577	as if it were the location of some spectacular accident,
137.495	or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star.
142.214	The French E.U. official in charge of the funding
147.016	rushed to block the painting.
150.11	He screeched that he would block the financing.
154.856	"""But why?"" I asked him."
158.486	"""Because the colors you have ordered"
161.278	"do not meet European standards,"" he replied."
165.99	"""Well,"" I told him,"
168.919	"""the surroundings do not meet European standards,"
172.107	even though this is not what we want,
177.402	but we will choose the colors ourselves,
180.573	because this is exactly what we want.
184.243	And if you do not let us continue with our work,
188.126	I will hold a press conference here,
190.8	right now, right in this road,
194.076	and we will tell people that you look to me
197.326	"just like the censors of the socialist realism era."""
203.2	Then he was kind of troubled,
205.855	and asked me for a compromise.
208.447	But I told him no, I'm sorry,
210.767	compromise in colors is gray,
215.269	and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime.
220.357	(Applause)
221.574	So it's time for change.
226.693	The rehabilitation of public spaces
228.863	revived the feeling of belonging
231.597	to a city that people lost.
236.466	The pride of people about their own place of living,
242.906	and there were feelings that had been buried
246.325	deep for years under the fury of the illegal,
250.98	barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space.
256.454	And when colors came out everywhere,
259.498	a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people.
263.986	"Big noise raised up: ""What is this? What is happening?"
266.933	"What are colors doing to us?"""
268.894	And we made a poll,
269.949	the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
272.351	"We asked people, ""Do you want this action,"
279.608	"and to have buildings painted like that?"""
284.098	And then the second question was,
286.469	"""Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"""
289.473	To the first question,
295.063	Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
297.423	But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it,
301.095	they wanted it to continue. (Laughter)
304.174	So we noticed change.
307.301	People started to drop less litter in the streets, for example,
311.696	started to pay taxes,
314.326	started to feel something they had forgotten,
318.775	and beauty was acting as a guardsman
323.839	where municipal police, or the state itself, were missing.
330.381	One day I remember walking along a street
334.082	that had just been colored,
336.678	and where we were in the process of planting trees,
340.457	when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife
343.702	putting a glass facade to their shop.
347.669	They had thrown the old shutter
349.966	in the garbage collection place.
352.958	"""Why did you throw away the shutters?"" I asked him."
356.518	"""Well, because the street is safer now,"" they answered."
361.75	"""Safer? Why? They have posted more policemen here?"""
367.318	"""Come on, man! What policemen?"
370.142	You can see it for yourself. There are colors,
373.234	streetlights, new pavement with no potholes,
379.054	"trees. So it's beautiful; it's safe."""
383.846	And indeed, it was beauty that was giving people
387.79	this feeling of being protected.
392.217	And this was not a misplaced feeling.
395.719	Crime did fall.
400.476	The freedom that was won in 1990
403.822	brought about a state of anarchy in the city,
407.959	while the barbarism of the '90s
410.87	brought about a loss of hope for the city.
414.352	The paint on the walls did not feed children,
418.622	nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant,
422.686	but it gave hope and light,
426.127	and helped to make people see
428.567	there could be a different way of doing things,
431.67	a different spirit, a different feel to our lives,
435.581	and that if we brought the same energy and hope
441.8	to our politics, we could build a better life
446.088	for each other and for our country.
451.283	We removed 123,000 tons of concrete
458.133	only from the riverbanks.
460.74	We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings
465.89	all over the city,
468.872	up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
473.341	We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
479.87	We established a green tax,
482.953	and then everybody accepted it
486.983	and all businessmen paid it regularly.
491.977	By means of open competitions,
494.364	we managed to recruit in our administration
497.357	many young people,
499.352	and we thus managed to build
501.214	a de-politicized public institution
504.485	where men and women were equally represented.
509.005	International organizations
511.547	have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years,
514.925	not all of it well spent.
518.157	When I told the World Bank directors
521.285	that I wanted them to finance a project to build
526.198	a model reception hall for citizens
529.093	precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption,
533.253	they did not understand me.
535.503	But people were waiting in long queues
538.781	under sun and under rain
541.704	in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer
545.929	from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks.
553.367	They were paying in order to skip the queue,
557.551	the long queue.
559.907	The reply to their requests was met
563.87	by a voice coming from this dark hole,
568.571	and, on the other hand,
572.813	a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents
578.255	while searching through old documents for the bribe.
584.063	We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks,
588.37	every week, but we could not change this corrupt practice.
594.009	"""I'm convinced,"" I told a German official"
597.783	with the World Bank,
600.559	"""that it would be impossible for them to be bribed"
604.401	if they worked in Germany,
606.855	in a German administration,
608.806	just as I am convinced that if you put German officials
613.212	from the German administration in those holes,
616.435	"they would be bribed just the same."""
620.583	(Applause)
627.287	It's not about genes.
629.119	It's not about some being with a high conscience
634.853	and some others having not a conscience.
637.295	It's about system, it's about organization.
640.067	It's also about environment and respect.
643.327	We removed the kiosks.
646.21	We built the bright new reception hall
649.906	that made people, Tirana citizens,
653.477	think they had traveled abroad when they entered
657.163	to make their requests.
659.587	We created an online system of control
663.031	and so speeded up all the processes.
666.947	We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
671.603	The corruption in the state administration
675.807	of countries like Albania --
678.507	it's not up to me to say also like Greece --
682.683	can be fought only by modernization.
688.063	Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself
692.815	is the answer, and not reinventing people
696.334	based on a ready-made formula
698.982	that the developed world often tries in vain to impose
703.238	to people like us.
705.344	(Applause)
708.051	Things have come to this point
710.035	because politicians in general,
712.527	but especially in our countries, let's face it,
715.423	think people are stupid.
717.886	They take it for granted that, come what may,
721.43	people have to follow them,
723.642	while politics, more and more, fails to offer answers
727.736	for their public concerns
731.759	or the exigencies of the common people.
736.43	Politics has come to resemble
739.232	a cynical team game played by politicians,
742.718	while the public has been pushed aside
746.647	as if sitting on the seats of a stadium
750.534	in which passion for politics
752.384	is gradually making room for blindness and desperation.
757.993	Seen from those stairs, all politicians today
762.887	seem the same,
764.85	and politics has come to resemble
769.487	a sport that inspires more aggressiveness
774.088	and pessimism than social cohesion
777.4	and the desire for civic protaganism.
781.673	Barack Obama won
783.699	— (Applause) —
789.976	because he mobilized people as never before
793.539	through the use of social networks.
796.072	He did not know each and every one of them,
799.185	but with an admirable ingenuity,
803.055	he managed to transform them into activists
806.435	by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands
810.564	the arguments and the instruments that each would need
814.158	to campaign in his name by making his own campaign.
818.951	I tweet. I love it.
821.006	I love it because it lets me get the message out,
826.375	but it also lets people get their messages to me.
830.642	This is politics, not from top down,
833.634	but from the bottom up, and sideways,
836.858	and allowing everybody's voice to be heard
839.85	is exactly what we need.
841.81	Politics is not just about leaders.
843.864	It's not just about politicians and laws.
846.625	It is about how people think,
848.593	how they view the world around them,
850.928	how they use their time and their energy.
853.454	When people say all politicians are the same,
855.97	ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush,
859.25	if François Hollande is the same as Sarkozy.
862.825	They are not. They are human beings with different views
867.529	and different visions for the world.
870.111	When people say nothing can change,
873.009	just stop and think what the world was like
881.705	Our world is defined by the pace of change.
884.821	We can all change the world.
887.625	I gave you a very small example
890.501	of how one thing, the use of color,
894.002	can make change happen.
896.513	I want to make more change
897.876	as Prime Minister of my country,
900.664	but every single one of you can make change happen
904.986	if you want to.
906.579	President Roosevelt, he said,
909.704	"""Believe you can, and you are halfway there."""
913.377	Efharisto and kalinihta.
916.444	(Applause)
