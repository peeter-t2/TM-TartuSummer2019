12.965	I was born and raised in North Korea.
16.468	Although my family constantly struggled against poverty,
21.268	I was always loved and cared for first,
24.796	because I was the only son
26.947	and the youngest of two in the family.
30.117	But then the great famine began in 1994.
33.724	I was four years old.
36.183	My sister and I would go searching for firewood
39.98	starting at 5 in the morning
41.956	and come back after midnight.
44.762	I would wander the streets searching for food,
48.65	and I remember seeing a small child
50.823	tied to a mother's back eating chips,
53.645	and wanting to steal them from him.
56.869	Hunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.
61.702	For a hungry child, politics and freedom
64.905	are not even thought of.
67.657	On my ninth birthday, my parents
70.345	couldn't give me any food to eat.
73.774	But even as a child, I could feel the heaviness
77.718	in their hearts.
80.753	Over a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,
85.968	and in 2003, when I was 13 years old,
89.664	my father became one of them.
92.577	I saw my father wither away and die.
96.465	In the same year, my mother disappeared one day,
100.597	and then my sister told me
102.402	that she was going to China to earn money,
105.003	but that she would return with money and food soon.
109.198	Since we had never been separated,
112.149	and I thought we would be together forever,
115.119	I didn't even give her a hug when she left.
118.992	It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.
123.205	But again, I didn't know
124.916	it was going to be a long goodbye.
128.404	I have not seen my mom or my sister since then.
133.341	Suddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.
137.56	My daily life became very hard,
140.649	but very simple.
142.701	My goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.
146.724	But that is no way to survive.
149.631	I started to realize, begging would not be the solution.
154.349	So I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.
159.675	Sometimes, I found small jobs
162.64	in exchange for food.
164.97	Once, I even spent two months in the winter
168.116	working in a coal mine,
175.634	for up to 16 hours a day.
179.067	I was not uncommon.
181.431	Many other orphans survived this way, or worse.
188.992	When I could not fall asleep from bitter cold
193.128	or hunger pains,
194.595	I hoped that, the next morning,
197.443	my sister would come back to wake me up
200.006	with my favorite food.
202.276	That hope kept me alive.
205.426	I don't mean big, grand hope.
208.224	I mean the kind of hope that made me believe
211.346	that the next trash can had bread,
213.809	even though it usually didn't.
216.942	But if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,
220.385	and then I would die.
222.478	Hope kept me alive.
226.416	Every day, I told myself,
229.176	no matter how hard things got,
231.904	still I must live.
235.806	After three years of waiting for my sister's return,
239.936	I decided to go to China to look for her myself.
244.288	I realized
247.148	I couldn't survive much longer this way.
250.798	I knew the journey would be risky,
253.603	but I would be risking my life either way.
256.5	I could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,
260.686	or at least I could try for a better life
264.144	by escaping to China.
267.38	I had learned that many people tried to cross
270.61	the border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.
275.397	North Korean border guards often shoot and kill people
279.355	trying to cross the border without permission.
282.728	Chinese soldiers will catch
285.379	and send back North Koreans,
287.233	where they face severe punishment.
291.573	I decided to cross during the day,
294.654	first because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,
300.087	second because I knew I was already taking a risk,
304.736	and since not many people tried to cross during the day,
308.151	I thought I might be able to cross
309.841	without being seen by anyone.
313.266	I made it to China on February 15, 2006.
317.174	I was 16 years old.
319.402	I thought things in China would be easier,
322.322	since there was more food.
325.595	I thought more people would help me.
328.651	But it was harder than living in North Korea,
332.664	because I was not free.
334.359	I was always worried about being caught
337.104	and sent back.
339.899	By a miracle, some months later,
343.17	I met someone who was running
344.613	an underground shelter for North Koreans,
347.955	and was allowed to live there
350.563	and eat regular meals for the first time in many years.
355.915	Later that year, an activist helped me escape China
360.396	and go to the United States as a refugee.
364.617	I went to America without knowing a word of English,
367.917	yet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.
372.296	Even in North Korea, I was an F student.
376.495	(Laughter)
377.879	And I barely finished elementary school.
381.586	And I remember I fought in school more than once a day.
384.89	Textbooks and the library were not my playground.
388.828	My father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,
392.573	but it didn't work.
395.124	At one point, my father gave up on me.
398.267	"He said, ""You're not my son anymore."""
402.236	I was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.
406.988	But nevertheless, my level of motivation
409.649	still didn't change before he died.
414.356	So in America, it was kind of ridiculous
417.161	that they said I should go to high school.
420.188	I didn't even go to middle school.
422.612	I decided to go, just because they told me to,
425.996	without trying much.
428.404	But one day, I came home and my foster mother
431.817	had made chicken wings for dinner.
435.026	And during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,
438.28	but I realized there were not enough for everyone,
441.476	so I decided against it.
444.973	When I looked down at my plate,
447.298	I saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.
452.434	I was so happy.
454.752	I looked at him sitting next to me.
457.015	He just looked back at me very warmly,
460.331	but said no words.
463.003	Suddenly I remembered my biological father.
467.847	My foster father's small act of love
470.82	reminded me of my father,
473.041	who would love to share his food with me
476.041	when he was hungry, even if he was starving.
480.678	I felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,
485.01	yet my father died of starvation.
488.477	My only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,
492.68	and that night I also thought of what else I could do
496.171	to honor him.
498.387	And my answer was to promise to myself
501.121	that I would study hard and get the best education
504.551	in America to honor his sacrifice.
508.115	I took school seriously,
510.651	and for the first time ever in my life,
513.451	I received an academic award for excellence,
517.348	and made dean's list from the first semester in high school.
522.962	(Applause)
530.594	That chicken wing changed my life.
533.324	(Laughter)
537.381	Hope is personal. Hope is something
540.973	that no one can give to you.
543.482	You have to choose to believe in hope.
546.402	You have to make it yourself.
549.569	In North Korea, I made it myself.
552.809	Hope brought me to America.
555.522	But in America, I didn't know what to do,
558.522	because I had this overwhelming freedom.
563.554	My foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,
567.605	and he motivated me and gave me a purpose
571.131	to live in America.
575.058	I did not come here by myself.
578.178	I had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.
583.132	Many people helped me along the way to get here.
587.286	North Koreans are fighting hard to survive.
591.274	They have to force themselves to survive,
594.063	have hope to survive,
596.818	but they cannot make it without help.
601.579	This is my message to you.
603.925	Have hope for yourself,
606.634	but also help each other.
609.746	Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.
616.328	My foster father didn't intend to change my life.
620.114	In the same way, you may also change someone's life
624.486	with even the smallest act of love.
629.006	A piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,
634.124	and having the hope will bring you bread
637.225	to keep you alive.
639.51	But I confidently believe that
642.727	your act of love and caring
646.185	can also save another Joseph's life
649.589	and change thousands of other Josephs
655.031	who are still having hope to survive.
659.033	Thank you.
660.34	(Applause)
696.561	Adrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing
699.386	that very personal and special story with us.
702.568	I know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,
705.793	it was almost exactly a decade,
708.253	and in the off chance that she may be able to see this,
710.67	we wanted to give you an opportunity
712.497	to send her a message.
714.725	Joseph Kim: In Korean?
715.861	AH: You can do English, then Korean as well.
718.469	(Laughter)
722.377	JK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean
724.718	because I don't think I can make it
727.459	without tearing up.
731.115	Nuna, it has been already 10 years
735.836	that I havenâ€™t seen you.
742.357	I just wanted to say
745.749	that I miss you, and I love you,
749.933	and please come back to me and stay alive.
754.276	And I -- oh, gosh.
759.162	I still haven't given up my hope to see you.
765.591	I will live my life happily
770.253	and study hard
773.572	until I see you,
775.649	and I promise I will not cry again.
780.228	(Laughter)
781.785	Yes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,
784.373	and if you can't find me,
786.644	I will also look for you,
789.716	and I hope to see you one day.
792.452	And can I also make a small message to my mom?
795.788	AH: Sure, please.
797.439	JK: I haven't spent much time with you,
800.228	but I know that you still love me,
802.14	and you probably still pray for me
805.084	and think about me.
808.204	I just wanted to say thank you
810.356	for letting me be in this world.
813.89	Thank you.
815.359	(Applause)
