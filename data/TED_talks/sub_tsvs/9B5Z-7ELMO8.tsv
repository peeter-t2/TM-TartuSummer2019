12.687	So, raise your hand
12.687	if you've seen somebody in your city
16.383	standing on a corner,
16.383	holding a sign like this.
22.229	I think we all have.
23.502	If you're being honest,
24.691	at least one time,
24.691	have you wondered if they mean it?
28.578	If we offered them a job,
28.578	would they really take it?
31.509	And what would that job mean
31.509	to them in their lives?
35.063	Well, this is a story
35.063	about what happened in my city
37.888	when we decided to find out,
40.532	when we decided to think differently
40.532	about panhandling,
43.943	and lift people up
43.943	through the dignity of work.
47.954	"We call it, ""There's a Better Way."""
50.204	We call it There's a Better Way
51.721	because I believe there's a better way
51.721	to get the money you need
54.783	than panhandling on the corner.
57.08	I believe there's a better way
57.08	to help your brothers and sisters in need
61.002	than handing a few dollars
61.002	out the car window.
64.294	We know there's dignity in work.
66.93	We also know that people are much more
66.93	likely to invest in themselves
70.35	if they believe that their community
70.35	is willing to invest in them first.
75.304	And because we're all wired
75.304	to be kind and compassionate,
78.631	it always feels good to hand
78.631	a couple of dollars to someone
82.16	that is in need.
84.627	But if you talk to panhandlers,
84.627	many of them will tell you
88.078	that your few dollars don't necessarily
88.078	go towards feeding the body,
93.292	they go towards feeding an addiction.
96.304	There's a better way.
98.409	My name is Richard Berry,
99.705	and I have one of the best
99.705	jobs in the world.
102.096	I get to be the mayor
102.096	of a great American city,
104.554	Albuquerque, New Mexico.
107.766	I was at lunch on July 17, 2015,
107.766	in my great American city,
113.993	and on my way back to city hall,
116.241	I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.
118.896	As you can see, he's holding a sign,
120.876	and his sign says he wants a job.
123.493	But if you look closer at the picture,
125.359	you'll see he's standing
125.359	underneath a blue sign,
127.622	and that sign says, if you need help,
127.622	if you need food or shelter
131.758	or you'd like to donate,
133.039	please call 311,
133.039	our community service number.
137.293	So why is this guy standing
137.293	underneath my sign with his sign?
142.889	Well, we wondered
142.889	if anybody would call that 311 sign,
145.478	and as it turns out, they did --
148.813	I put those up in about 30 intersections.
150.901	And we did connect them
150.901	with food and shelter and services.
154.299	But yet he's still standing under my sign
156.385	with a sign that says he wants a job.
159.908	It's simple: he wants a job.
163.135	So I decided to do
163.135	something rare in government.
166.139	I decided to make the solution simpler
166.139	rather than more complicated.
170.446	I went back to my office,
170.446	I gathered my staff around
172.995	"and I said, ""We're going"
172.995	to take this man at his word,
175.63	and others like him.
176.839	The man says he wants a job,
176.839	we're going to give him a job,
179.64	and we're going to make our city
179.64	"an even better place in the meantime."""
183.919	You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.
186.152	We're a mile high,
187.447	the Sandia Mountains on the east,
189.577	the Rio Grande runs through
189.577	the center of the city;
192.141	we're the home of the Albuquerque
192.141	International Balloon Fiesta.
195.229	On a day like today,
196.417	you could literally ski this morning
196.417	and golf this afternoon.
199.851	But there's always something to do --
201.766	always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.
204.625	If you're going to have an initiative
204.625	like this in your city,
207.585	you have to ask yourself two questions.
209.504	First one is: Is there anything
209.504	left to do in your city?
212.198	And if the answer is no,
213.404	would you please give me
213.404	your mayor's phone number,
215.836	because I need some advice.
217.183	(Laughter)
218.214	But the second question
218.214	you have to ask is this:
220.505	Are your solutions to panhandling working?
224.506	If you're like Albuquerque,
225.816	and you're taking the punitive
225.816	approach like we used to,
228.486	handing out tickets to panhandlers
228.486	or those who give them money,
231.644	I'm going to suggest
231.644	that your solutions aren't working,
234.342	and I know you're not getting
234.342	to the root of your problem in your city.
238.605	So if you have something to do
241.005	and you need people
241.005	that need something to do,
243.63	there's a better way.
244.864	And the good news is,
244.864	it's not that complicated.
247.68	This a 2006 Dodge van.
250.494	It was in my motor pool
250.494	not doing anything.
253.17	We put some new tires on it,
253.17	wrapped it with a logo.
256.136	This van now goes out to street corners
256.136	where our panhandlers are --
259.955	we go to them.
261.676	We stop the van, we get out,
263.146	we ask them if they
263.146	would like a day's work
265.202	rather than panhandling for the day.
268.161	And if you wondered
268.161	if they really mean it --
271.755	it takes us about an hour
271.755	to fill this van up in the morning,
274.736	because almost everybody we ask
274.736	takes a job for the day.
279.193	But you need more than just a van.
281.407	You need a super-fantastic
281.407	human being to drive that van.
285.096	And my super-fantastic human being,
285.096	his name is Will.
287.79	This is him in the yellow vest.
289.585	Will works at our local nonprofit partner.
292.143	He works with the homeless every day.
293.99	The panhandlers trust him,
296.516	he believes in them,
298.523	he hustles.
300.105	"I like to say, ""Where"
300.105	"there's a Will, there's a way."""
303.146	So if you're going to do
303.146	the Better Way campaign in your city,
306.164	you need to find yourself a Will,
309.16	because he's really one of the keys
309.16	to making this successful
312.841	in the city of Albuquerque.
314.465	You also need a great nonprofit partner.
316.676	Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.
319.223	They've been in our community
319.223	for over 30 years.
321.756	They provide counseling, food, shelter,
324.293	and if they don't provide it,
325.72	they know somebody in our city that does.
328.37	But they do something much more
328.37	for me as the mayor.
330.837	They provide agility.
332.496	You see, it takes me two weeks,
334.733	maybe two months sometimes,
336.527	to onboard an employee
336.527	with the city of Albuquerque.
339.844	So you could imagine --
341.623	my old Dodge van,
342.816	my super-fantastic human being, Will,
345.15	a great local nonprofit partner --
347.069	they drive to the corner,
347.069	there's a panhandler,
349.327	"they say, ""Would you like"
349.327	"to work for the day?"""
351.605	"The panhandler says, ""Yes,"""
352.925	"and Will says, ""Great! I'll be back"
352.925	"in six weeks to pick you up."""
356.097	(Laughter)
357.144	It wouldn't work.
358.319	It's really important that we have
358.319	that agility in our program.
362.582	And they do the paperwork,
364.28	they do the insurance,
365.828	they do all of the other forms
365.828	that I can't do quickly.
369.61	We pay our panhandlers
369.61	nine dollars an hour.
372.165	We feed them once at the jobsite.
374.07	At the end of the day,
375.247	our old Dodge van takes them
375.247	right back to St. Martin's,
377.923	and they get connected
377.923	with counseling services.
381.603	So far,
382.809	with the pilot program
382.809	and a couple days a week,
385.315	and a fantastic human being
385.315	and a Dodge van,
388.002	we've cleaned up 400 city blocks
388.002	in the city of Albuquerque.
391.422	We've picked up over 117,000 pounds
391.422	of trash, weeds and litter.
395.929	I don't know if you've ever
395.929	weighed a tumbleweed,
398.276	but they don't weigh much,
399.581	so you can imagine the volume
399.581	of material that we've picked up.
403.409	My city has 6,000 employees,
407.161	and none better
407.161	than my solid waste department.
410.209	We send our trucks out
410.209	at the end of the day,
412.381	they help the panhandlers
412.381	put into the truck
414.637	the material they've picked up
414.637	during the day,
416.904	and we take it to the landfill.
418.431	I'm lucky that I have city employees
420.219	that are willing to work side by side
420.219	with our panhandlers.
423.184	They're lifting up our city
423.184	while lifting up their lives.
426.194	And like anything else --
426.194	listen, it takes resources.
429.284	But the good news is it doesn't take much.
433.001	We started with an old van,
434.864	a super-fantastic human being,
436.626	a great local nonprofit
437.944	and $50,000.
440.468	But we also had to have community trust.
442.658	And fortunately, we had built
442.658	that up in years prior to Better Way.
446.778	We have a program called
446.778	"""Albuquerque Heading Home,"""
449.312	a Housing First model where we house
449.312	the chronically homeless,
452.38	and when I told my community
452.38	we wanted to do that differently,
455.489	I said there's a smart way
455.489	to do the right thing.
458.616	We have now housed 650 chronically
458.616	homeless, medically vulnerable --
462.729	frankly, most likely to die
462.729	on the streets in our city.
466.177	We commissioned our university,
466.177	they studied it.
468.57	We could tell the taxpayers,
468.57	we can save you 31.6 percent
472.248	over the cost of leaving someone
472.248	to struggle for survival on the streets.
476.25	We've now saved over five million dollars
476.25	while housing 650 people.
480.272	So we had that community trust,
482.263	but we had to have a little bit more
482.263	of an honest conversation also
485.502	as a community,
487.013	because we had to get people to understand
489.063	that when they hand
489.063	those five dollars out the window,
491.63	they might actually be minimizing
491.63	their opportunity
494.05	to help the person in need,
494.05	and here's why:
496.13	that five dollars might go
496.13	to buying some fast food today --
499.967	a lot of times it goes to buying
499.967	drugs and alcohol.
502.992	That same five dollars,
504.167	if you gave it to one of our shelters,
506.449	could feed seven people today.
508.234	And if you gave it to one of our local
508.234	food banks or food pantries,
512.54	we could actually feed
517.711	"People ask,""Well, Albuquerque"
517.711	is 600,000 people -- million, metro --
522.583	this wouldn't work in our city,
522.583	"we're too big, we're too small."""
525.698	I disagree; if you have
525.698	one panhandler on one city block,
528.417	you can do this.
529.597	If you live in a city
529.597	of eight-and-half million people,
532.239	you can do this.
533.418	It doesn't matter what you do.
534.919	It's not the work that you do,
534.919	it's the dignity of the work.
537.805	You could do anything.
538.987	So I think any city could do this.
541.111	And people say to me,
542.334	"""Mayor, that's just a little too simple."
545.197	"It can't work that way."""
547.305	But I tell you what, friends:
548.878	when you go to a street corner
550.345	and you engage with a panhandler
550.345	with dignity and respect,
553.297	maybe for the first time in years,
553.297	maybe in their life,
556.021	and you tell them that you believe in them
558.1	and that this is their city
558.1	as much as it's your city,
560.796	and that you actually need their help
560.796	to make our place better,
565.587	and you understand that this
565.587	isn't the answer to all their problems,
568.929	but at least it's a start,
570.871	an amazing thing happens.
573.073	When they get out on the jobsite
573.073	and they start working together,
576.443	you start seeing amazing things happen.
578.364	They see teamwork; they see
578.364	the fact that they can make a difference.
581.691	And at the end of the day,
582.956	when they get back to St. Martin's
582.956	in that old Dodge van,
585.676	they're much more likely to sign up
585.676	for whatever services they need --
589.028	substance abuse, mental health
589.028	counseling, you name it.
591.771	So far with our pilot program,
594.215	we've offered
594.215	about 1,700 days of day work.
597.108	We've connected 216 people
597.108	to permanent employment opportunities.
601.687	Twenty people actually qualified
601.687	for our Housing First model,
605.382	Heading Home,
606.584	and they've been housed.
607.767	And over 150 people have been connected
609.95	to mental health substance abuse services
612.792	through There's a Better Way.
614.512	This is me just two weeks ago,
618.758	at St. Martin's,
619.95	doing our point-in-time survey
621.426	that we do every two years.
623.369	I'm interviewing a gentleman
623.369	who's homeless, like we do,
626.806	getting his information,
626.806	figuring out where he's from,
629.574	how he got there,
631.326	what we can do to help him.
632.953	And you notice he's holding the same sign
632.953	that the guy was holding in 2015,
636.948	same sign I walked out with here today.
639.987	So you have to ask yourself:
639.987	Is it really making a difference?
642.983	Absolutely it's making a difference.
645.016	Albuquerque is now
645.016	one of the national leaders
647.698	in combating some of the most stubborn
647.698	and persistent social issues
650.948	that we have.
652.123	Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,
654.026	the Better Way program,
655.241	Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered
655.241	homelessness in our city
658.205	by 80 percent last year.
661.223	Since I took over as mayor,
662.561	we've been able to reduce the chronic
662.561	homeless population in our city
665.849	by 40 percent.
667.95	And by HUD's definition,
669.289	we've gotten to functional zero,
671.006	which means we've literally ended
671.006	veteran homelessness
673.678	in the city of Albuquerque,
675.042	by being intentional.
676.496	(Applause)
682.777	So I'm happy to report
682.777	that other cities are hearing about this,
686.012	other mayors are calling us --
687.58	Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --
690.327	and are now starting to implement programs
692.887	where they bring the dignity
692.887	of work to the equation.
695.986	And I can't wait to learn from them.
697.865	I can't wait to see
697.865	what their experiment looks like,
700.566	what their pilot project looks like,
702.625	so we can start taking
702.625	a collective approach nationally
705.222	through the dignity of work.
706.622	And I want to commend them --
708.027	the mayors, their communities,
708.027	their nonprofits --
710.462	for the work that they're doing.
712.674	So who's next?
715.313	Are you and your city ready to step up?
718.59	Are you ready to think differently
718.59	about these persistent social issues?
722.78	Are you ready to lift people up
722.78	in your community
725.12	through the dignity of work,
727.073	and make your city
727.073	profoundly better in many ways?
731.031	Well, if you are, my friends,
731.031	I promise you there is a better way.
734.353	Thank you.
735.535	(Applause)
