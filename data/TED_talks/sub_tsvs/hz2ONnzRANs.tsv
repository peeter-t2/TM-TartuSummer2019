12.58	I'm Chetan Bhatt
13.86	and when I give my name,
13.86	"I'm often asked, ""Where are you from?"""
17.9	And I normally say London.
21.14	(Laughter)
22.66	But of course, I know
22.66	what they're really asking,
25.18	so I say something like,
27.22	"""Well, my grandparents and my mum"
27.22	were born in India,
30.82	my dad and I were born in Kenya,
33.5	and I was brought up in London.
35.42	And then they've got me mapped.
36.94	"""Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian."
36.94	"I've worked with one of those."""
39.78	(Laughter)
41.02	And from my name they probably
41.02	assume that I'm a Hindu.
44.42	And this sort of fixes me for them.
48.26	But what about the Christians
50.3	and the Muslims and the atheists
53.62	that I grew up with?
55.14	Or the socialists and the liberals,
57.66	even the occasional Tory?
60.26	(Laughter)
61.3	Indeed, all kinds of women and men --
63.14	vegetable sellers, factory workers,
63.14	cooks, car mechanics --
66.1	living in my working class area,
68.62	in some profoundly important way,
71.18	they are also a part of me
72.9	and are here with me.
75.5	Maybe that's why I find it hard
75.5	to respond to questions about identity
80.02	and about origin.
81.46	And it's not just a sort of
81.46	teenage refusal to be labeled.
85.74	It's about our own most identities,
88.54	the ones that we put our hands up to,
90.86	the ones that we cheer for,
92.5	the ones that we fight for,
94.22	the ones that we love or hate.
97.06	And it's about how we apprehend ourselves
100.18	as well as others.
101.86	And it's about identities
101.86	we just assume that we have
104.54	without thinking too much about them.
108.22	But our responses
108.22	to questions of identity and origin
111.98	have substantial
111.98	social and political importance.
117.46	We see the wars, the rages of identity
117.46	going on all around us.
121.34	We see violent religious,
121.34	national and ethnic disputes.
125.82	And often the conflict is based
125.82	on old stories of identity
131.42	and belonging
132.98	and origins.
134.5	And these identities are based on myths,
137.22	typically about ancient,
137.22	primordial origins.
140.94	And these could be about Adam and Eve
143.38	or about the supremacy
143.38	of a caste or gender
146.34	or about the vitality of a supposed race
149.26	or about the past glories
149.26	of an empire or civilization
152.7	or about a piece of land
154.42	that some imagined deity has gifted.
158.62	Now, people say
160.06	that origin stories and identity myths
160.06	make us feel secure.
164.18	What's wrong with that?
165.5	They give us a sense of belonging.
167.18	Identity is your cultural clothing,
168.92	and it can make you feel
168.92	warm and fuzzy inside.
172.46	But does it really?
174.18	Do we really need
174.18	identity myths to feel safe?
177.18	Because I see religious,
177.18	national, ethnic disputes
181.22	as adding to human misery.
185.14	Can I dare you
186.98	to refuse every origin myth
190.94	that claims you?
192.98	What if we reject
192.98	every single primordial origin myth
196.9	and develop a deeper sense of personhood,
200.34	one responsible to humanity as a whole
202.78	rather than to a particular tribe,
205.26	a radically different idea of humanity
207.62	that exposes how origin myths mystify,
212.62	disguise global power,
214.98	rapacious exploitation,
216.86	poverty, the worldwide oppression
216.86	of women and girls,
220.82	and of course massive,
220.82	accelerating inequalities?
226.46	Now, origin myths
226.46	are closely linked to tradition,
228.86	and the word tradition
228.86	points to something old
231.34	and permanent, almost natural,
233.3	and people assume tradition
233.3	is just history,
236.06	simply the past
236.06	condensed into a nice story.
239.9	But let's not confuse
239.9	tradition with history.
242.78	The two are often in severe conflict.
247.18	Origin stories are usually recently
247.18	created fictions of ancient belonging,
250.82	and they're absurd
252.1	given the complexity of humanity
253.78	and our vastly interconnected,
253.78	even if very unequal world.
258.26	And today we see claims to tradition
261.86	that claim to be ancient
263.38	changing rapidly in front of our eyes.
268.82	I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley
270.899	with Asian, English, Caribbean,
270.899	Irish families living in our street,
275.94	and the neo-Nazi National Front
275.94	was massive then
279.06	with regular marches and attacks on us
281.58	and a permanent threat
282.82	and often a frequent reality
282.82	of violence against us
286.58	on the streets, in our homes,
289.9	typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.
292.18	And I remember during a general election
292.18	a leaflet came through our letter box
296.54	with a picture of the National Front
296.54	candidate for our area.
301.06	And the picture
302.7	was of our next-door neighbor.
305.02	He threatened to shoot me once
305.02	when I played in the garden as a kid,
308.94	and many weekends, shaven-headed
308.94	National Front activists
311.66	arrived at his house
313.1	and emerged with scores of placards
315.34	screaming that they wanted us
315.34	to go back home.
321.02	But today he's one of my mum's best mates.
325.74	He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,
329.54	and at some point in his
329.54	political journey out of fascism
333.26	he embraced a broader idea of humanity.
337.94	There was a Hindu family
337.94	that we got to know well --
340.42	and you have to understand
340.42	that life in our street
342.82	was a little bit like the setting
342.82	for an Asian soap opera.
345.58	Everyone knew everyone else's business,
347.5	even if they didn't want it
347.5	to be known by anyone at all.
350.22	You really had no choice in this matter.
352.18	But in this family,
352.18	there was a quiet little boy
356.82	who went to the same school as I did,
358.66	and after I left school,
358.66	I didn't hear much more about him,
361.5	except that he'd gone off to India.
366.58	Now around 2000,
368.42	I remember seeing this short book.
372.06	The book was unusual
373.3	because it was written
373.3	by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,
377.06	and in it the author calls
377.06	for attacks in Britain.
380.14	This is in 1999,
382.1	so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq
382.1	was still in the future,
386.26	and he helped scout
386.26	New York bombing targets.
389.1	He taught others how to make a dirty bomb
389.1	to use on the London Underground,
393.94	and he plotted a massive bombing campaign
393.94	in London's shopping areas.
397.98	He's a very high-risk security
397.98	prisoner in the UK
401.1	and one of the most important Al Qaeda
401.1	figures to be arrested in Britain.
407.3	The author of that book
409.18	was the very same quiet little boy
412.66	who went to my school.
414.98	So a Hindu boy from Britain
417.14	became an Al Qaeda fighter
418.9	and a most-wanted international terrorist,
420.98	and he rejected what people would call
420.98	his Hindu or Indian or British identity,
426.1	and he became someone else.
427.98	He refused to be who he was.
429.86	He recreated himself,
432.18	and this kind of journey is very common
434.5	for young men and women
435.98	who become involved
435.98	in Al Qaeda or Islamic State
439.1	or other transnational armed groups.
442.42	Al Qaeda's media spokesman
442.42	is a white American
446.3	from a Jewish and Catholic
446.3	mixed background,
449.78	and neither he nor the boy from my school
452.58	were from Muslim backgrounds.
454.3	There's no point in asking them
454.3	where are they from.
457.06	A more important question is
457.06	where they're going.
460.62	And I would also put it to you
462.1	that exactly the same journey
462.1	occurs for those young men and women
465.26	who were brought up
465.26	in Muslim family backgrounds.
468.22	Most of those who join Al Qaeda
471.06	and other Salafi jihadi groups
471.06	from Europe, Asia, North America,
476.06	even in many cases the Middle East
477.98	are those who have comprehensively
477.98	rejected their backgrounds
481.94	to become, in essence, new people.
486.1	They spend an enormous amount of time
486.1	attacking their parents' backgrounds
489.98	as profane, impure, blasphemous,
493.02	the wrong type of Islam,
495.34	and their vision instead
496.86	is a fantastical view
496.86	of cosmic apocalypse.
501.46	It's a born again vision.
502.82	Discard your past,
502.82	your society, your family and friends
506.26	since they're all impure.
509.66	Instead, become someone else,
513.06	your true self,
515.3	your authentic self.
518.82	Now, this isn't
518.82	about a return to the past.
522.9	It's about using a forgery of the past
526.14	to envision an appalling future
526.14	which begins today at year zero.
530.66	This is why over 80 percent of the victims
530.66	of Al Qaeda and Islamic State
534.18	are people from Muslim backgrounds.
535.9	The first act by Salafi jihadi groups
535.9	when they take over an area
540.26	is to destroy existing Muslim institutions
543.38	including mosques,
543.38	shrines, preachers, practices.
548.3	Their main purpose is to control
548.3	and punish people internally,
551.74	to dictate the spaces that women may go,
554.46	their clothing, family relations,
556.62	beliefs, even the minute detail
556.62	of how one prays.
560.94	And you get the impression in the news
563.06	that they are after us in the West,
566.34	but they are actually mainly after
566.34	people from other Muslim backgrounds.
572.26	In their view, no other Muslim
572.26	can ever be pure enough,
577.18	so ordinary beliefs and practices
577.18	that have existed for centuries
580.3	are attacked as impure
582.3	by teenagers from Birmingham or London
585.5	who know nothing
588.14	about the histories
588.14	that they so joyously obliterate.
594.62	Now here, their claim to tradition
594.62	is at war with history,
599.5	but they're nevertheless
599.5	very certain about their purity
602.58	and about the impurity of others.
606.34	Purity,
608.46	certainty,
610.1	the return to authentic tradition,
611.86	the quest for these
611.86	can lead to lethal visions
615.18	of perfect societies and perfected people.
619.22	This is what the main Hindu
619.22	fundamentalist organization in India
623.5	looks like today at its mass rally.
626.58	Maybe it reminds you
626.58	of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,
629.9	and the movement's roots
629.9	are indeed in fascism.
632.14	It was a member of the same
632.14	Hindu fundamentalist movement
635.9	who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.
639.98	Hindu fundamentalists today
639.98	view this murderer as a national hero,
645.02	and they want to put up
645.02	statues of him throughout India.
648.86	They've been involved for decades
650.5	in large-scale mass violence
650.5	against minorities.
653.06	They ban books, art, films.
655.7	They attack romantic couples
655.7	on Valentine's Day,
657.98	Christians on Christmas Day.
660.06	They don't like others talking critically
662.98	about what they see
662.98	as their ancient culture
665.62	or using its images
667.14	or caricaturing it
668.78	or drawing cartoons about it.
672.5	But the people making
672.5	the strongest possible claims
676.02	about ancient, timeless Hindu religion
678.94	are dressed in brown shorts
678.94	and white shirts
681.58	while claiming, oddly,
684.26	to be the original Aryan race,
687.14	just like the violent Salafi jihadis
689.58	who make their claims
689.58	about their primordial religion
692.58	while dressed in black military uniforms
695.06	and wearing balaclavas.
697.78	These people are manufacturing
697.78	pure, pristine identities of conviction
702.18	and of certainty.
703.42	Fundamentalists see religion and culture
703.42	as their sole property, a property.
708.82	But religions and cultures are processes.
711.42	They're not things. They're impermanent.
711.42	They're messy. They're impure.
714.82	Look at any religion
714.82	and you'll see disputes and arguments
717.58	going all the way down.
721.46	Any criticism of religion in any form
725.18	has to therefore be
727.14	part of the expansive sense of humanity
729.74	we should aspire to.
732.22	I respect your right
732.22	to have and to express your religion
736.7	or your culture or your opinion,
739.34	but I don't necessarily
739.34	have to respect the content.
742.22	I might like some of it.
743.5	I might like how an old church
743.5	looks, for example,
746.34	but this isn't the same thing.
748.78	Similarly, I have a human right
751.42	to say something
751.42	that you may find offensive,
753.58	but you do not have a human right
753.58	not to be offended.
756.9	In a genuine democracy,
756.9	we're constantly offended
759.86	since people express
759.86	different views all the time.
762.66	They also change their views,
765.18	so their views are impermanent.
766.74	You cannot fix someone's political views
770.06	based on their religious
770.06	or national or cultural background.
774.66	Now, these points about religious purity
777.5	also apply to nationalism and to racism.
782.98	I'm always puzzled
785.5	to have pride in your national
785.5	or ethnic identity,
791.74	pride in the accident of birth
791.74	from a warm and cozy womb,
796.38	belief in your superiority
796.38	because of the accident of birth.
801.1	These people have very firm ideas
803.38	about what belongs and what doesn't belong
805.404	inside the cozy national cultures
805.404	that they imagine.
809.1	And I'm going to caricature a bit here,
809.1	but only a little bit.
812.94	I want you to imagine
812.94	the supporter of some Little Englander
816.22	or British nationalist political party,
818.14	and he's sitting at home
819.54	and he's screaming about foreigners
822.42	invading his country
824.26	while watching Fox News,
826.22	an American cable channel
828.42	owned by an Australian
829.9	on his South Korean television set
832.06	which was bought
832.06	by his Spanish credit card
835.66	which is paid off monthly
835.66	by his high-street British bank
838.94	which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.
842.18	He supports a British football team
842.18	owned by a Russian.
846.26	His favorite brand of fish and chips
848.02	is owned by a Swedish
848.02	venture capitalist firm.
850.7	The church he sometimes goes to
852.22	has its creed decided
852.22	in meetings in Ghana.
857.1	His Union Jack underpants
860.14	were made in India.
861.38	(Laughter)
863.66	And --
864.9	(Applause)
870.86	Thank you.
872.1	And they're laundered regularly
876.06	by a very nice Polish lady.
878.86	(Laughter)
881.06	There is no pure ethnicity,
881.06	national culture,
883.86	and the ethical choices we have today
885.98	are far wider than being forced to choose
889.98	between racist right
889.98	and religious right visions,
893.46	dismal visions of culture.
896.78	Now, culture isn't just
896.78	about language, food, clothing and music,
900.54	but gender relations, ancient monuments,
902.86	a heritage of sacred texts.
906.7	But culture can also be
906.7	what has been decided to be culture
910.74	by those who have a political stake
913.54	in pounding culture
913.54	into the shape of a prison.
918.02	Big political identity claims
918.02	are elite bids for power.
921.1	They're not answers to social
921.1	or economic or political injustices.
925.22	They often obscure them.
927.38	And what about the large number
927.38	of people across the globe
930.14	who can't point
930.14	to a monument from their past,
932.34	who don't possess a sacred written text,
934.7	who can't hark back
936.78	to the past glories
936.78	of a civilization or empire?
940.5	Are these people less a part of humanity?
946.38	What about you,
947.98	now, listening to this?
949.26	What about you and your identity,
950.94	because you stitch your experiences
950.94	and your thoughts into a continuous person
956.34	moving forward in time.
958.46	And this is what you are when you say,
960.34	"""I,"" ""am,"" or ""me."""
963.42	But this also includes
963.42	all of your hopes and dreams,
966.58	all of the you's that could have been,
969.1	and it includes all the other people
971.46	and the things that are
971.46	in the biography of who you are.
974.74	They, the others,
976.78	are also a part of you,
978.58	moving forward with you.
981.9	Your authentic self,
981.9	if such a thing exists,
985.34	is a complex, messy and uncertain self,
988.5	and that is a very good thing.
993.9	Why not value those
993.9	impurities and uncertainties?
996.3	Maybe clinging to pure identities
996.3	is a sign of immaturity,
1000.14	and ethnic, nationalist
1000.14	and religious traditions are bad for you.
1003.26	Why not be skeptical
1003.26	about every primordial origin claim
1006.14	made on your behalf?
1007.62	Why not reject the identity myths
1007.62	that call on you to belong,
1013.74	that politicians and community leaders,
1016.38	so-called community leaders,
1018.22	place on you?
1019.5	If we don't need origin stories
1019.5	and fixed identities,
1022.18	we can challenge ourselves
1022.18	to think creatively
1025.5	about each other and our future.
1028.1	And here culture
1028.1	always takes care of itself.
1031.06	I'm not worried about culture.
1032.54	Cultures are creative, dynamic processes,
1035.98	not imposed laws and boundaries.
1039.78	This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad
1039.78	ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,
1043.46	a very senior Muslim judge and thinker
1043.46	in Cordoba in the 12th century,
1047.419	and his writings were considered
1047.419	deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.
1051.58	Long after he died,
1052.98	followers of his work
1052.98	were ruthlessly hunted down,
1055.38	banished and killed over several centuries
1058.139	by the most powerful religious institution
1058.139	of the medieval period.
1063.7	That institution was
1063.7	the Roman Catholic Church.
1068.58	Why?
1070.1	Because ibn Rushd said
1070.1	that something true in religion
1072.86	may conflict with something
1074.22	that your reason
1074.22	finds to be true on earth,
1078.22	but the latter is still true.
1081.46	There are two distinct worlds of truth,
1083.38	one based on our reason and evidence,
1083.38	and one that is divine,
1086.3	and the state, political power, social law
1086.3	are in the realm of reason.
1091.22	Religious life is a different realm.
1093.18	They should be kept separated.
1094.94	Social and political life
1094.94	should be governed by our reason,
1098.54	not by religion.
1100.02	And you can see why the church
1100.02	was upset by his writings,
1102.74	as indeed were some Muslims
1102.74	during his lifetime,
1105.26	because he gives us
1105.26	a strong statement of secularism
1109.86	of a kind which is normal in Europe today.
1112.66	Now, history plays many tricks on us.
1114.5	It undermines our fixed truths
1116.22	and what we believe
1116.22	to be our culture and their culture.
1119.06	Ibn Rushd, someone
1119.06	who happens to be a Muslim,
1121.54	is considered one of the key influences
1123.5	in the introduction and spread
1123.5	of secularism in Europe.
1127.82	So against religious, nationalist
1127.82	and racial purists of all kinds,
1132.06	can you make his story a part of your own,
1136.3	not because he happened to be a Muslim,
1138.22	not because he happened to be an Arab,
1140.22	but because he was a human being
1142.74	with some very good ideas
1144.62	that shook his world
1146.74	and ours.
1148.62	Thank you.
1149.86	(Applause)
