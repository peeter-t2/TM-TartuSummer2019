12.502	Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D.
17.787	where we are looking to find
19.93	alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society.
24.47	That's what we're after.
26.278	And we do this because we actually believe
28.458	that silicon technology today is mostly about
31.732	a culture of excess.
33.484	It's about the fastest and the most efficient
35.657	and the most dazzling gadget you can have,
38.087	while about two-thirds of the world
40.985	can hardly reach the most basic of this technology
44.669	to even address fundamental needs in life,
48.252	including health care, education
50.42	and all these kinds of very fundamental issues.
54.499	So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote,
57.744	a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai.
61.767	So this man, his name is Sathi Shri.
63.954	He is an outstanding person,
66.06	because he's a small entrepreneur.
68.202	He runs a little shop
69.944	in one of the back streets of Mumbai.
71.947	He has this little 10-square-meter store,
74.995	where so much is being done.
77.145	It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes
79.05	when I once just happened to bump into him.
81.533	Basically, what he does is, he has all these services
83.658	for micro-payments and booking tickets
86.411	and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for,
89.744	but he does it for people offline
91.933	and connects to the digital world.
93.93	More importantly, he makes his money
95.435	by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know,
98.028	for the prepaid subscriptions.
100.303	But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook
103.544	with a few of his employees
106.117	where they can fix almost anything.
108.701	Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it.
111.959	And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there,
115.077	"and he was like, ""Yeah, do you want an upgrade?"""
117.246	"""Yes."" (Laughter)"
119.564	I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided
121.504	to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter)
126.137	But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering
131.352	and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space.
136.304	They have figured out everything that's required
138.895	to dismantle, take things apart,
140.921	rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware,
143.88	do whatever you want to with the phone,
145.847	and they can fix anything so quickly.
148.416	You can hand over a phone this morning
150.416	and you can go pick it up after lunch,
152.336	and it was quite incredible.
154.256	But then we were wondering whether this is
155.827	a local phenomenon, or is truly global?
158.369	And, over time, we started understanding
160.619	and systematically researching
162.338	what this tinkering ecosystem is about,
164.454	because that is something that's happening
166.059	not just in one street corner in Mumbai.
168.091	It's actually happening in all parts of the country.
171.205	It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,
173.466	in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.
175.513	Even here in Doha I found this little nook
178.708	where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,
181.595	and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.
184.796	You've got to try it on your own to believe it.
186.909	But what fuels this?
188.463	It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts
191.971	and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,
195.277	and then redistributed to basically service this industry,
199.043	and you can even buy salvaged parts.
201.214	Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy
203.37	brand new things. You have condemned computers
205.833	that are stripped apart,
207.14	and you can buy salvaged components
208.71	and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.
212.531	But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?
216.012	That's the real question, because this is something
217.932	that's been there, part of every society
220.157	that's deprived of enough resources.
222.523	But there's an interesting paradigm.
224.42	There's the traditional crafts,
225.912	and then there's the technology crafts.
227.915	We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.
230.123	They're not something that's been established.
232.195	It's not something that's institutionalized.
234.862	It's not taught in universities.
236.633	It's taught [by] word of mouth,
238.356	and it's an informal education system around this.
240.265	"So we said, ""What can we get out of this?"
243.067	"You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?"""
245.801	The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,
248.146	which is fantastic because it means that your product
250.486	or your service doesn't have to go through
252.531	a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.
255.139	It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,
258.218	so it means that you can do a lot more with it.
260.25	And then, the most important thing is,
262.564	it gives us large math for low cost.
264.94	So it means that you can actually embed
267.269	pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds
270.794	of extendable ideas into really simple devices.
274.452	So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.
279.26	It's basically what was the system or the paradigm
282.206	before the industrial revolution is now re-happening
284.67	in a whole new way in small digital shops
287.678	across the planet in most developing countries.
290.759	So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,
294.893	"and we said, ""What can we do with this?"
296.571	"Can we make a little product or a service out of it?"""
299.099	So one of the first things we did is this thing called
301.519	a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.
303.915	Basically one of the contexts that we studied was
306.666	schools in very remote parts of India.
310.153	So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,
313.412	which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker
316.114	who teaches this amazing little social setting.
318.591	It's an informal school,
320.128	but it's really about holistic education.
322.287	The only thing that they don't have
323.525	is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook
325.919	sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.
328.746	"So we said, ""What can we do to empower this teacher"
332.25	"to do more?"" How to access the digital world?"
335.062	Instead of being the sole guardian of information,
337.624	be a facilitator to all this information.
340.028	"So we said, ""What are the steps required to empower the teacher?"""
343.412	How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,
346.067	and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform
348.599	"that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?"""
351.591	So we walked around.
353.934	We went and scavenged the nearby markets,
356.224	"and we tried to understand, ""What can we pick up that will make this happen?"""
360.245	So the thing that we got
362.772	was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector
365.979	that comes for about 60 dollars.
368.316	We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,
370.772	and a bunch of small speakers.
372.562	So essentially, the mobile phone gives us
374.86	a connected multimedia platform.
376.784	It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files
380.269	of different formats and play them.
382.62	The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,
385.646	and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,
388.637	and the lunch box is a nice little package
390.853	in which you can put everything inside,
392.9	and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of
394.463	amplify the sound large enough.
395.881	Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.
399.42	They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,
402.013	and you really have to get above that.
403.673	And we took it back to this little tinkering setup
406.394	of a mobile phone repair shop,
408.484	and then the magic happens.
409.912	We dismantle the whole thing,
411.293	we reassemble it in a new configuration,
413.65	and we do this hardware mashup,
415.828	systematically training the guy how to do this.
418.437	Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.
421.892	(Applause)
428.718	And we systematically field tested,
431.736	because in the field testing we learned some
434.104	important lessons, and we went through many iterations.
436.621	One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.
439.316	Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.
443.294	Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough
445.846	darkness in the classroom to do these things.
448.974	We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,
451.816	and the next version we came up with was a box
454.394	that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,
456.774	but most importantly connect to a car battery,
459.573	because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power
462.567	in places where there's not enough electricity
464.774	or erratic electricity.
466.734	And the other key thing that we did was
468.703	make this box run off a USB key, because we realized
471.165	that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,
474.519	at least, in theory, it was much more efficient
477.094	to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.
480.984	It might take a few days to get there,
482.824	but at least it gets there in high definition
485.198	and in a reliable quality.
487.413	So we made this box, and we tested it again
489.695	and again and again, and we're going through
491.23	multiple iterations to do these things.
492.779	But it's not limited to just education.
495.748	This kind of a technique or metrology
497.614	can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,
499.626	and I'm going to tell you one more little story.
501.534	It's about this little device called a medi-meter.
503.989	It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.
507.356	In India, there is a context of these amazing people,
510.683	the health care workers called ASHA workers.
512.962	They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system
515.379	who live in the local community and are trained
517.763	with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,
520.331	and the main purpose is basically to inform people
524.093	to basically, how to lead a better life, but also
527.626	to divert or sort of make recommendations
530.854	of what kind of health care should they approach?
533.528	They are basically referral services, essentially.
536.24	But the problem with that is that we realized
538.548	after a bunch of research that they are amazing
542.738	at referring people to the nearest clinic
545.218	or the public health care system, but what happens at the
548.091	public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines
552.169	and too many people who overload the system
554.979	simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities
557.545	for the population that's being referred.
559.747	So everything from a common cold
561.866	to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same
564.526	level of attention, and there's no priorities.
567.57	"So we said, ""Come on, there's got to be a better way"
569.641	"of doing this for sure."""
571.442	"So we said, ""What can we do with the ASHA worker"
574.019	that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,
577.95	but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral
580.465	system that allows load balancing of the network,
583.946	and directs patients to different sources of health care
587.885	"based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?"""
591.765	So the real key question was,
593.746	how do we empower this woman?
595.414	How do we empower her with simple tools
597.341	that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature
600.292	so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?
604.072	And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,
606.1	because the amount of waiting time and the amount of
611.018	distances that people need to travel, often sometimes
612.938	seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,
615.611	to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental
621.074	in the sense that it really dissuades people
623.528	from getting access to health care.
625.537	So if there was something that she could do,
627.572	that would be amazing.
628.681	So what we did was that we converted this device
631.742	into a medical device.
633.559	I want to demo this actually,
634.835	because it's a very simple process.
637.508	Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)
639.917	Come along. (Applause)
646.119	So, what we're going to do is that
649.044	we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,
652.016	including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen
654.871	that's there in your blood.
656.744	So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.
660.035	Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?
661.809	Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.
663.475	VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.
667.483	(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.
671.833	So ... (Laughter)
673.845	So I take it into the start position, and then
678.236	I press the read button. (Beeps)
681.848	So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps)
687.329	And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.
690.107	Let's see what happens here.
693.382	(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
695.465	BG: Great. Good news. (Applause)
699.301	VV: So ... (Applause)
701.646	So the thing about this is that
704.863	if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,
708.968	we would have to rush you to a hospital.
710.814	Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange
714.934	or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,
717.763	sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.
720.807	So that was a very simple three-step screening process
723.158	that could basically change the equation
725.273	of how public health care works in so many different ways.
728.013	BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.
729.91	(Applause)
734.303	So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,
737.743	because that's the more interesting part.
740.033	So essentially, the three things that are required
742.727	to make this conversion from this guy to this guy
747.255	is a cheap remote control for a television
751.384	that you can almost find in every home today,
754.295	some parts from a computer mouse, basically,
758.009	something that you can scavenge for very low cost,
761.872	and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.
764.783	Basically this is a micro-controller with a few
767.184	extra components that can be shipped for very little cost
769.979	across the world, and that's what is all required
772.972	with a little bit of local tinkering talent
775.363	to convert the device into something else.
778.15	So we are right now doing some systematic field tests
781.546	to basically ascertain whether something like this actually
784.596	makes sense to the ASHA worker.
786.163	We are going through some reference tests to compare it
789.707	against professional equipment to see if there's a degree
793.165	of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact
795.487	in people's lives. But most importantly,
798.095	what we are trying to do right now
799.89	is we are trying to scale this up, because there
802.144	are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground
804.831	who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can
807.568	give at least a fraction of them the access to these things,
811.128	it just changes the way the economics of public health care
814.086	works, and it changes the way systems actually function,
817.097	not just on a systematic planning level,
821.363	but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level.
824.548	So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way.
827.349	Thank you. (Applause)
830.507	(Applause)
