12.856	I want to introduce you
12.856	to an amazing woman.
15.69	Her name is Davinia.
18.444	Davinia was born in Jamaica,
18.444	emigrated to the US at the age of 18,
22.873	and now lives just outside
22.873	of Washington, DC.
26.262	She's not a high-powered
26.262	political staffer,
29.088	nor a lobbyist.
30.676	She'd probably tell you
30.676	she's quite unremarkable,
33.629	but she's having
33.629	the most remarkable impact.
36.471	What's incredible about Davinia
38.015	is that she's willing to spend
38.015	time every single week
40.902	focused on people who are not her:
43.331	people not her in her neighborhood,
43.331	her state, nor even in her country --
47.734	people she'd likely never meet.
49.991	Davinia's impact started a few years ago
51.955	when she reached out
51.955	to all of her friends on Facebook,
54.723	and asked them to donate their pennies
56.93	so she could fund girls' education.
59.397	She wasn't expecting a huge response,
61.828	but 700,000 pennies later,
64.635	she's now sent over 120 girls to school.
67.975	When we spoke last week,
69.186	she told me she's become
69.186	a little infamous at the local bank
72.248	every time she rocks up
72.248	with a shopping cart full of pennies.
77.042	Now -- Davinia is not alone.
80.161	Far from it.
81.717	She's part of a growing movement.
84.027	And there's a name
84.027	for people like Davinia:
86.663	global citizens.
88.935	A global citizen is someone
88.935	who self-identifies first and foremost
93.43	not as a member of a state,
93.43	a tribe or a nation,
97.256	but as a member of the human race,
99.467	and someone who is prepared
99.467	to act on that belief,
104.331	to tackle our world's greatest challenges.
107.25	Our work is focused on finding,
109.727	supporting and activating global citizens.
112.634	They exist in every country
114.556	and among every demographic.
117.008	I want to make the case to you today
118.794	that the world's future depends
118.794	on global citizens.
121.896	I'm convinced that if we had
121.896	more global citizens active in our world,
126.222	then every single one
126.222	of the major challenges we face --
128.981	from poverty, climate change,
128.981	gender inequality --
132.603	these issues become solvable.
134.811	They are ultimately global issues,
137.431	and they can ultimately only be solved
139.336	by global citizens demanding
139.336	global solutions from their leaders.
144.731	Now, some people's immediate
144.731	reaction to this idea
147.256	is that it's either a bit utopian
147.256	or even threatening.
151.561	So I'd like to share with you
151.561	a little of my story today,
154.64	how I ended up here,
156.375	how it connects with Davinia
158.187	and, hopefully, with you.
160.256	Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,
162.096	I was one of those seriously
162.096	irritating little kids
165.459	"that never, ever stopped asking, ""Why?"""
167.807	You might have been one yourself.
169.426	I used to ask my mum
169.426	the most annoying questions.
172.822	I'd ask her questions like,
172.822	"""Mum, why I can't I dress up"
175.645	"and play with puppets all day?"""
177.596	"""Why do you want fries with that?"""
179.936	"""What is a shrimp,"
181.15	and why do we have to keep
181.15	"throwing them on the barbie?"""
183.846	(Laughter)
184.871	"""And mum -- this haircut."
186.703	"Why?"""
187.9	(Laughter)
190.126	The worst haircut, I think.
193.364	Still terrible.
194.539	"As a ""why"" kid, I thought"
194.539	I could change the world,
197.365	and it was impossible
197.365	to convince me otherwise.
199.989	And when I was 12
199.989	and in my first year of high school,
202.6	I started raising money
202.6	for communities in the developing world.
205.861	We were a really
205.861	enthusiastic group of kids,
208.08	and we raised more money
208.08	than any other school in Australia.
211.365	And so I was awarded the chance
211.365	to go to the Philippines to learn more.
214.977	It was 1998.
216.915	We were taken into a slum
216.915	in the outskirts of Manila.
220.626	It was there I became friends
220.626	with Sonny Boy,
224.38	who lived on what was literally
224.38	a pile of steaming garbage.
228.617	"""Smoky Mountain"" was what they called it."
230.65	But don't let the romance
230.65	of that name fool you,
232.959	because it was nothing more
232.959	than a rancid landfill
235.344	that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours
235.344	rummaging through every single day
239.709	to find something, anything of value.
243.304	That night with Sonny Boy and his family
243.304	changed my life forever,
246.604	because when it came time to go to sleep,
248.651	we simply laid down on this concrete
248.651	slab the size of half my bedroom
252.422	with myself, Sonny Boy,
252.422	and the rest of his family,
255.352	seven of us in this long line,
256.987	with the smell of rubbish all around us
259.405	and cockroaches crawling all around.
261.952	And I didn't sleep a wink,
263.255	but I lay awake thinking to myself,
264.988	"""Why should anyone have to live like this"
267.494	when I have so much?
269.29	Why should Sonny Boy's ability
269.29	to live out his dreams
272.06	be determined by where he's born,
274.13	or what Warren Buffett called
274.13	"'the ovarian lottery?'"""
277.197	I just didn't get it,
278.978	and I needed to understand why.
281.656	Now, I only later came to understand
284.026	that the poverty I'd seen
284.026	in the Philippines
286.478	was the result of decisions made
286.478	or not made, man-made,
290.811	by a succession of colonial powers
290.811	and corrupt governments
294.24	who had anything but the interests
294.24	of Sonny Boy at heart.
297.429	Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,
297.429	but they may as well have.
301.253	And if we're to try to help
301.253	kids like Sonny Boy,
303.878	it wouldn't work just to try
303.878	to send him a few dollars
306.594	or to try to clean up
306.594	the garbage dump on which he lived,
309.706	because the core
309.706	of the problem lay elsewhere.
312.214	And as I worked on community
312.214	development projects over the coming years
315.897	trying to help build schools,
317.763	train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,
320.828	I came to see that community development
323.289	should be driven
323.289	by communities themselves,
325.869	and that although charity is necessary,
325.869	it's not sufficient.
329.646	We need to confront these challenges
331.531	on a global scale and in a systemic way.
334.221	And the best thing I could do
335.69	is try to mobilize a large group
335.69	of citizens back home
339.221	to insist that our leaders engage
339.221	in that systemic change.
343.315	That's why, a few years later,
345.339	I joined with a group of college friends
347.632	in bringing the Make Poverty History
347.632	campaign to Australia.
351.447	We had this dream of staging
351.447	this small concert
354.849	around the time of the G20
354.849	with local Aussie artists,
358.746	and it suddenly exploded one day
360.422	when we got a phone call from Bono,
360.422	the Edge and Pearl Jam,
364.048	who all agreed to headline our concert.
367.341	I got a little bit excited
367.341	that day, as you can see.
369.966	(Laughter)
371.928	But to our amazement,
373.231	the Australian government
373.231	heard our collective voices,
376.347	and they agreed to double investment
376.347	into global health and development --
380.065	an additional 6.2 billion dollars.
383.28	It felt like --
384.479	(Applause)
388.962	It felt like this incredible validation.
391.579	By rallying citizens together,
391.579	we helped persuade our government
394.969	to do the unthinkable,
396.479	and act to fix a problem
396.479	miles outside of our borders.
400.965	But here's the thing:
403.156	it didn't last.
404.999	See, there was a change in government,
406.919	and six years later, all that new money
409.631	disappeared.
411.542	What did we learn?
413.703	We learned that one-off spikes
413.703	are not enough.
417.225	We needed a sustainable movement,
419.709	not one that is susceptible
419.709	to the fluctuating moods of a politician
423.717	or the hint of an economic downturn.
426.018	And it needed to happen everywhere;
428.144	otherwise, every individual government
428.144	would have this built-in excuse mechanism
432.073	that they couldn't possibly carry
432.073	the burden of global action alone.
437.405	And so this is what we embarked upon.
440.103	And as we embarked upon
440.103	this challenge, we asked ourselves,
443.104	how do we gain enough pressure
443.104	and build a broad enough army
446.625	to win these fights for the long term?
449.419	We could only think of one way.
452.034	We needed to somehow turn
452.034	that short-term excitement
454.769	of people involved with
454.769	the Make Poverty History campaign
457.69	into long-term passion.
459.822	It had to be part of their identity.
462.319	So in 2012, we cofounded an organization
462.319	that had exactly that as its goal.
467.836	And there was only one name for it:
470.359	Global Citizen.
472.241	But this is not about
472.241	any one organization.
475.295	This is about citizens taking action.
478.041	And research data tells us
479.826	that of the total population
479.826	who even care about global issues,
484.081	only 18 percent have done
484.081	anything about it.
488.237	It's not that people don't want to act.
490.595	It's often that they don't
490.595	know how to take action,
493.05	or that they believe that their actions
493.05	will have no effect.
496.175	So we had to somehow recruit
496.175	and activate millions of citizens
499.724	in dozens of countries
501.409	to put pressure on their leaders
501.409	to behave altruistically.
504.732	And as we did so, we discovered
504.732	something really thrilling,
508.261	that when you make
508.261	global citizenship your mission,
511.237	you suddenly find yourself
511.237	with some extraordinary allies.
514.743	See, extreme poverty isn't the only issue
514.743	that's fundamentally global.
518.632	So, too, is climate change,
520.52	human rights, gender equality,
523.12	even conflict.
524.73	We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder
527.346	with people who are passionate about
527.346	targeting all these interrelated issues.
531.316	But how did we actually
531.316	go about recruiting
533.377	and engaging those global citizens?
535.327	Well, we used the universal language:
539.034	music.
540.287	We launched the Global Citizen Festival
542.574	in the heart of New York City
542.574	in Central Park,
545.448	and we persuaded some of the world's
545.448	biggest artists to participate.
549.24	We made sure that
549.24	these festivals coincided
551.58	with the UN General Assembly meeting,
553.745	so that leaders who need
553.745	to hear our voices
556.223	couldn't possible ignore them.
558.828	But there was a twist:
560.884	you couldn't buy a ticket.
562.563	You had to earn it.
564.22	You had to take action
564.22	on behalf of a global cause,
567.221	and only once you'd done that
567.221	could you earn enough points to qualify.
571.2	Activism is the currency.
574.079	I had no interest in citizenship
574.079	purely as some sort of feel-good thing.
578.503	For me, citizenship means you have to act,
578.503	and that's what we required.
582.804	And amazingly, it worked.
584.789	Last year, more than 155,000 citizens
584.789	in the New York area alone
589.52	earned enough points to qualify.
591.447	Globally, we've now signed up citizens
591.447	in over 150 countries around the world.
595.835	And last year, we signed up
595.835	more than 100,000 new members
599.271	each and every week of the whole year.
601.708	See, we don't need to create
601.708	global citizens from nothing.
605.835	We're already everywhere.
607.788	We just need to be organized
609.991	and motivated to start acting.
612.229	And this is where I believe
612.229	we can learn a lot from Davinia,
615.348	who started taking action
615.348	as a global citizen back in 2012.
619.925	Here's what she did.
621.587	It wasn't rocket science.
623.537	She started writing letters,
625.837	emailing politicians' offices.
628.147	She volunteered her time
628.147	in her local community.
631.166	That's when she got active on social media
633.802	and started to collect pennies --
636.056	a lot of pennies.
638.264	Now, maybe that doesn't sound
638.264	like a lot to you.
642.252	How will that achieve anything?
644.502	Well, it achieved a lot
644.502	because she wasn't alone.
648.22	Her actions, alongside 142,000
648.22	other global citizens',
652.674	led the US government
652.674	to double their investment
655.339	into Global Partnership for Education.
657.194	And here's Dr. Raj Shah,
658.757	the head of USAID,
658.757	making that announcement.
661.283	See, when thousands of global citizens
661.283	find inspiration from each other,
665.146	it's amazing to see
665.146	their collective power.
667.849	Global citizens like Davinia
667.849	helped persuade the World Bank
671.285	to boost their investment
671.285	into water and sanitation.
673.984	Here's the Bank's president Jim Kim
673.984	announcing 15 billion dollars onstage
678.048	at Global Citizen,
679.334	and Prime Minister Modi of India
679.334	affirmed his commitment
682.864	to put a toilet in every household
682.864	and school across India by 2019.
688.494	Global citizens encouraged
688.494	by the late-night host Stephen Colbert
692.734	launched a Twitter invasion on Norway.
695.71	Erna Solberg, the country's
695.71	Prime Minister, got the message,
698.941	committing to double investment
698.941	into girls' education.
702.44	Global citizens together with Rotarians
702.44	called on the Canadian, UK,
706.259	and Australian governments
707.684	to boost their investment
707.684	into polio eradication.
710.57	They got together and committed
716.309	But despite all of this momentum,
719.277	we face some huge challenges.
722.008	See, you might be thinking to yourself,
723.912	how can we possibly persuade world leaders
726.26	to sustain a focus on global issues?
729.474	Indeed, the powerful American
729.474	politician Tip O'Neill once said,
734.581	"""All politics is local."""
737.762	That's what always
737.762	got politicians elected:
740.559	to seek, gain and hold onto power
743.605	through the pursuit of local
743.605	or at very best national interests.
748.185	I experienced this for the first time
748.185	when I was 21 years old.
753.113	I took a meeting
754.519	with a then-Australian Foreign Minister
754.519	who shall remain nameless --
759.655	[Alexander Downer]
760.97	(Laughter)
763.515	And behind closed doors,
764.761	I shared with him my passion
764.761	to end extreme poverty.
767.261	"I said, ""Minister -- Australia"
767.261	has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
771.204	to help achieve the Millennium
771.204	Development Goals.
773.917	"We can do this."""
775.806	And he paused,
777.268	looked down on me
777.268	with cold, dismissive eyes,
780.465	"and he said, ""Hugh,"
781.957	"no one gives a funk about foreign aid."""
784.615	"Except he didn't use the word ""funk."""
787.528	He went on.
788.713	He said we need to look after
788.713	our own backyard first.
791.872	This is, I believe,
793.059	outdated, even dangerous thinking.
796.059	Or as my late grandfather would say,
797.956	complete BS.
799.958	Parochialism offers this false dichotomy
802.971	because it pits the poor in one country
802.971	against the poor in another.
806.501	It pretends we can isolate ourselves
806.501	and our nations from one another.
810.699	The whole world is our backyard,
812.79	and we ignore it at our peril.
814.695	See, look what happened
814.695	when we ignored Rwanda,
816.917	when we ignore Syria,
818.409	when we ignore climate change.
820.336	"Political leaders ought to give a ""funk"""
822.543	because the impact of climate change
822.543	and extreme poverty
825.23	comes right to our shore.
827.11	Now, global citizens --
827.11	they understand this.
829.744	We live in a time that favors
829.744	the global citizen,
833.018	in an age where every
833.018	single voice can be heard.
835.954	See, do you remember
837.146	when the Millennium Development Goals
837.146	were signed back in the year 2000?
840.636	The most we could do in those days
840.636	was fire off a letter
843.565	and wait for the next election.
845.737	There was no social media.
847.998	Today, billions of citizens
847.998	have more tools,
851.237	more access to information,
853.079	more capacity to influence
853.079	than ever before.
856.151	Both the problems and the tools
856.151	to solve them are right before us.
860.377	The world has changed,
862.467	and those of us who look
862.467	beyond our borders
864.888	are on the right side of history.
868.063	So where are we?
869.898	So we run this amazing festival,
872.289	we've scored some big policy wins,
874.628	and citizens are signing up
874.628	all over the world.
877.817	But have we achieved our mission?
880.651	No.
882.285	We have such a long way to go.
884.946	But this is the opportunity that I see.
888.414	The concept of global citizenship,
891.716	self-evident in its logic but until now
891.716	impractical in many ways,
897.436	has coincided with this particular moment
897.436	in which we are privileged to live.
902.044	We, as global citizens,
903.22	now have a unique opportunity
903.22	to accelerate large-scale positive change
907.831	around the world.
909.554	So in the months and years ahead,
911.737	global citizens will hold
911.737	world leaders accountable
914.805	to ensure that the new Global Goals
914.805	for Sustainable Development
917.875	are tracked and implemented.
920.048	Global citizens will partner

996.663	who reject the naysayers,
998.938	and embrace the amazing possibilities
998.938	of the world we share.
