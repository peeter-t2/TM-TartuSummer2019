16.42	Two weeks ago,
17.82	I was sitting at the kitchen table
17.82	with my wife Katya,
23.22	and we were talking about
23.22	what I was going to talk about today.
28.3	We have an 11-year-old son;
28.3	his name is Lincoln.
30.98	He was sitting at the same table,
30.98	doing his math homework.
35.5	And during a pause
35.5	in my conversation with Katya,
39.1	I looked over at Lincoln
40.86	and I was suddenly thunderstruck
44.9	by a recollection of a client of mine.
48.34	My client was a guy named Will.
51.14	He was from North Texas.
54.18	He never knew his father very well,
55.94	because his father left his mom
55.94	while she was pregnant with him.
61.78	And so, he was destined
61.78	to be raised by a single mom,
65.98	which might have been all right
67.481	except that this particular single mom
67.481	was a paranoid schizophrenic,
73.1	and when Will was five years old,
76.06	she tried to kill him
76.06	with a butcher knife.
79.54	She was taken away by authorities
79.54	and placed in a psychiatric hospital,
84.62	and so for the next several years
84.62	Will lived with his older brother,
87.9	until he committed suicide
87.9	by shooting himself through the heart.
92.34	And after that Will bounced around
92.34	from one family member to another,
97.18	until, by the time he was nine years old,
97.18	he was essentially living on his own.
102.22	That morning that I was sitting
102.22	with Katya and Lincoln,
104.86	I looked at my son, and I realized
104.86	that when my client, Will, was his age,
112.74	he'd been living by himself for two years.
116.9	Will eventually joined a gang
119.26	and committed a number
119.26	of very serious crimes,
123.66	including, most seriously of all,
127.02	a horrible, tragic murder.
130.7	And Will was ultimately executed
130.7	as punishment for that crime.
137.86	But I don't want to talk today
137.86	about the morality of capital punishment.
143.739	I certainly think that my client
143.739	shouldn't have been executed,
147.62	but what I would like to do today instead
150.54	is talk about the death penalty
150.54	in a way I've never done before,
155.62	in a way that is
155.62	entirely noncontroversial.
160.86	I think that's possible,
162.54	because there is a corner
162.54	of the death penalty debate --
166.78	maybe the most important corner --
169.1	where everybody agrees,
171.86	where the most ardent
171.86	death penalty supporters
176.14	and the most vociferous abolitionists
176.14	are on exactly the same page.
182.78	That's the corner I want to explore.
186.5	Before I do that, though,
186.5	I want to spend a couple of minutes
189.42	telling you how
189.42	a death penalty case unfolds,
193.02	and then I want to tell you two lessons
195.22	that I have learned over the last 20 years
195.22	as a death penalty lawyer
200.3	from watching well more
200.3	than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
205.94	You can think of a death penalty case
205.94	as a story that has four chapters.
211.22	The first chapter of every case
211.22	is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
216.3	It begins with the murder
216.3	of an innocent human being,
220.22	and it's followed by a trial
221.98	where the murderer
221.98	is convicted and sent to death row,
224.98	and that death sentence is ultimately
224.98	upheld by the state appellate court.
229.9	The second chapter consists
229.9	of a complicated legal proceeding
232.82	known as a state habeas corpus appeal.
236.46	The third chapter is an even
236.46	more complicated legal proceeding
239.42	known as a federal
239.42	habeas corpus proceeding.
241.94	And the fourth chapter is one
241.94	where a variety of things can happen.
245.78	The lawyers might file
245.78	a clemency petition,
248.3	they might initiate
248.3	even more complex litigation,
250.82	or they might not do anything at all.
253.3	But that fourth chapter
253.3	always ends with an execution.
258.22	When I started representing
258.22	death row inmates more than 20 years ago,
262.38	people on death row
262.38	did not have a right to a lawyer
265.06	in either the second
265.06	or the fourth chapter of this story.
268.74	They were on their own.
270.38	In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s
272.82	that they acquired a right to a lawyer
272.82	during the third chapter of the story.
277.7	So what all of these death row inmates
277.7	had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers
283.26	to handle their legal proceedings.
285.62	The problem is that there were
285.62	way more guys on death row
289.02	than there were lawyers
290.3	who had both the interest
290.3	and the expertise to work on these cases.
294.06	And so inevitably,
295.744	lawyers drifted to cases
295.744	that were already in chapter four --
299.7	that makes sense, of course.
301.1	Those are the cases that are most urgent;
303.1	those are the guys
303.1	who are closest to being executed.
305.608	Some of these lawyers were successful;
307.449	they managed to get
307.449	new trials for their clients.
309.78	Others of them managed
309.78	to extend the lives of their clients,
312.66	sometimes by years, sometimes by months.
315.58	But the one thing that didn't happen
318.02	was that there was never
318.02	a serious and sustained decline
321.98	in the number of annual
321.98	executions in Texas.
324.78	In fact, as you can see from this graph,
326.74	from the time that the Texas
326.74	execution apparatus got efficient
330.14	in the mid- to late 1990s,
332.22	there have only been a couple of years
334.054	where the number of annual
334.054	executions dipped below 20.
338.18	In a typical year in Texas,
340.22	we're averaging about two people a month.
344.14	In some years in Texas,
344.14	we've executed close to 40 people,
348.34	and this number has never significantly
348.34	declined over the last 15 years.
353.38	And yet, at the same time
353.38	that we continue to execute
356.78	about the same number
356.78	of people every year,
359.06	the number of people who we're
359.06	sentencing to death on an annual basis
362.94	has dropped rather steeply.
365.22	So we have this paradox,
367.18	which is that the number
367.18	of annual executions has remained high
371.42	but the number of new
371.42	death sentences has gone down.
375.46	Why is that?
376.86	It can't be attributed
376.86	to a decline in the murder rate,
379.74	because the murder
379.74	rate has not declined nearly so steeply
383.34	as the red line
383.34	on that graph has gone down.
386.34	What has happened instead
388.7	is that juries have started to sentence
388.7	more and more people to prison
393.02	for the rest of their lives
393.02	without the possibility of parole,
396.34	rather than sending them
396.34	to the execution chamber.
400.14	Why has that happened?
401.82	It hasn't happened
401.82	because of a dissolution
404.98	of popular support for the death penalty.
407.18	Death penalty opponents
407.18	take great solace in the fact
410.06	that death penalty support in Texas
410.06	is at an all-time low.
414.54	Do you know what all-time low
414.54	in Texas means?
416.7	It means that it's in the low 60 percent.
418.94	Now, that's really good
418.94	compared to the mid-1980s,
421.74	when it was in excess of 80 percent,
424.42	but we can't explain
424.42	the decline in death sentences
427.34	and the affinity for life
427.34	without the possibility of parole
430.58	by an erosion of support
430.58	for the death penalty,
432.98	because people still support
432.98	the death penalty.
435.22	What's happened to cause this phenomenon?
438.58	What's happened is that lawyers
438.58	who represent death row inmates
443.26	have shifted their focus
443.26	to earlier and earlier chapters
446.86	of the death penalty story.
448.82	So 25 years ago,
448.82	they focused on chapter four.
452.18	And they went from
452.18	chapter four 25 years ago
454.54	to chapter three in the late 1980s.
457.54	And they went from chapter three
457.54	in the late 1980s
460.06	to chapter two in the mid-1990s.
462.5	And beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,
464.58	they began to focus
464.58	on chapter one of the story.
467.58	Now, you might think
467.58	that this decline in death sentences
470.5	and the increase
470.5	in the number of life sentences
472.78	is a good thing or a bad thing.
474.3	I don't want to have a conversation
474.3	about that today.
476.82	All that I want to tell you
476.82	is that the reason that this has happened
480.1	is because death penalty lawyers
480.1	have understood
483.1	that the earlier you intervene in a case,
485.887	the greater the likelihood that
485.887	you're going to save your client's life.
489.78	That's the first thing I've learned.
491.7	Here's the second thing I learned:
493.82	My client Will was
493.82	not the exception to the rule;
498.42	he was the rule.
501.46	I sometimes say, if you tell me
501.46	the name of a death row inmate --
505.06	doesn't matter what state he's in,
506.74	doesn't matter
506.74	if I've ever met him before --
508.9	I'll write his biography for you.
511.3	And eight out of 10 times,
513.7	the details of that biography
513.7	will be more or less accurate.
518.34	And the reason for that is that 80 percent
518.34	of the people on death row
522.02	are people who came from the same sort
522.02	of dysfunctional family that Will did.
526.26	Eighty percent of the people on death row
528.46	are people who had exposure
528.46	to the juvenile justice system.
533.299	That's the second lesson
533.299	that I've learned.
536.58	Now we're right on the cusp of that corner
540.54	where everybody's going to agree.
543.5	People in this room might disagree
545.3	about whether Will
545.3	should have been executed,
547.98	but I think everybody would agree
550.34	that the best possible
550.34	version of his story
553.98	would be a story
553.98	where no murder ever occurs.
559.74	How do we do that?
561.78	When our son Lincoln was working
561.78	on that math problem two weeks ago,
566.54	it was a big, gnarly problem.
568.86	And he was learning how,
568.86	when you have a big old gnarly problem,
572.34	sometimes the solution
572.34	is to slice it into smaller problems.
576.3	That's what we do for most problems --
578.18	in math, in physics,
578.18	even in social policy --
580.34	we slice them into smaller,
580.34	more manageable problems.
583.66	But every once in a while,
583.66	as Dwight Eisenhower said,
587.42	the way you solve a problem
587.42	is to make it bigger.
592.82	The way we solve this problem
595.22	is to make the issue
595.22	of the death penalty bigger.
599.06	We have to say, all right.
601.42	We have these four chapters
601.42	of a death penalty story,
606.18	but what happens before that story begins?
610.78	How can we intervene
610.78	in the life of a murderer
614.66	before he's a murderer?
617.5	What options do we have
617.5	to nudge that person off of the path
623.26	that is going to lead
623.26	to a result that everybody --
626.66	death penalty supporters
626.66	and death penalty opponents --
629.46	still think is a bad result:
632.62	the murder of an innocent human being?
637.5	You know, sometimes people say
637.5	that something isn't rocket science.
643.1	And by that, what they mean
643.1	is rocket science is really complicated
646.42	and this problem that we're
646.42	talking about now is really simple.
649.94	Well that's rocket science;
651.38	that's the mathematical expression
651.38	for the thrust created by a rocket.
657.3	What we're talking about today
657.3	is just as complicated.
661.74	What we're talking about today
661.74	is also rocket science.
667.06	My client Will and 80 percent
667.06	of the people on death row
672.06	had five chapters in their lives
675.06	that came before the four chapters
675.06	of the death penalty story.
679.3	I think of these five chapters
679.3	as points of intervention,
682.98	places in their lives
684.66	when our society
684.66	could've intervened in their lives
688.26	and nudged them off of the path
688.26	that they were on
691.26	that created a consequence that we all --
693.9	death penalty supporters
693.9	or death penalty opponents --
696.82	say was a bad result.
699.1	Now, during each of these five chapters:
701.78	when his mother was pregnant with him;
703.74	in his early childhood years;
705.82	when he was in elementary school;
707.42	when he was in middle school
707.42	and then high school;
709.786	and when he was
709.786	in the juvenile justice system --
712.102	during each of those five chapters,
713.801	there were a wide variety of things
713.801	that society could have done.
716.88	In fact, if we just imagine
718.5	that there are five
718.5	different modes of intervention,
721.22	the way that society could intervene
721.22	in each of those five chapters,
725.46	and we could mix and match them
725.46	any way we want,
727.74	there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 --
727.74	possible strategies
731.78	that we could embrace
733.1	in order to nudge kids like Will
733.1	off of the path that they're on.
738.42	So I'm not standing here today
738.42	with the solution.
742.34	But the fact that we
742.34	still have a lot to learn,
746.78	that doesn't mean
746.78	that we don't know a lot already.
750.3	We know from experience in other states
753.1	that there are a wide variety
753.1	of modes of intervention
756.9	that we could be using in Texas,
758.54	and in every other state
758.54	that isn't using them,
761.34	in order to prevent a consequence
761.34	that we all agree is bad.
765.66	I'll just mention a few.
768.22	I won't talk today
768.22	about reforming the legal system.
772.22	That's probably a topic
773.5	that is best reserved
773.5	for a room full of lawyers and judges.
776.98	Instead, let me talk
776.98	about a couple of modes of intervention
780.98	that we can all help accomplish,
783.1	because they are modes of intervention
783.1	that will come about
785.886	when legislators and policymakers,
785.886	when taxpayers and citizens,
789.98	agree that that's
789.98	what we ought to be doing
792.06	and that's how we ought
792.06	to be spending our money.
794.42	We could be providing early childhood care
797.46	for economically disadvantaged
797.46	and otherwise troubled kids,
802.5	and we could be doing it for free.
805.02	And we could be nudging kids like Will
805.02	off of the path that we're on.
809.22	There are other states
809.22	that do that, but we don't.
812.86	We could be providing special schools,
815.46	at both the high school level
815.46	and the middle school level,
818.26	but even in K-5,
820.42	that target economically
820.42	and otherwise disadvantaged kids,
823.42	and particularly kids who have had
823.42	exposure to the juvenile justice system.
827.9	There are a handful
827.9	of states that do that;
830.06	Texas doesn't.
832.18	There's one other thing we can be doing --
832.18	well, there are a bunch of other things --
836.22	there's one other thing
836.22	that I'm going to mention,
838.58	and this is going to be the only
838.58	controversial thing that I say today.
841.89	We could be intervening
841.89	much more aggressively
845.26	into dangerously dysfunctional homes,
848.46	and getting kids out of them
850.42	before their moms pick up butcher knives
850.42	and threaten to kill them.
855.86	If we're going to do that,
855.86	we need a place to put them.
859.82	Even if we do all of those things,
861.5	some kids are going
861.5	to fall through the cracks
863.7	and they're going to end up
863.7	in that last chapter
865.98	before the murder story begins,
867.54	they're going to end up
867.54	in the juvenile justice system.
870.18	And even if that happens,
870.18	it's not yet too late.
873.86	There's still time to nudge them,
876.66	if we think about nudging them
876.66	rather than just punishing them.
880.66	There are two professors
880.66	in the Northeast --
882.78	one at Yale and one at Maryland --
884.46	they set up a school
884.46	that is attached to a juvenile prison.
889.14	And the kids are in prison,
889.14	but they go to school
891.5	from eight in the morning
891.5	until four in the afternoon.
894.1	Now, it was logistically difficult.
895.82	They had to recruit teachers
895.82	who wanted to teach inside a prison,
899.1	they had to establish strict separation
900.982	between the people who work at the school
900.982	and the prison authorities,
904.26	and most dauntingly of all,
905.62	they needed to invent a new curriculum
905.62	because you know what?
908.54	People don't come into and out of prison
908.54	on a semester basis.
911.63	(Laughter)
913.42	But they did all those things.
916.5	Now, what do all of these things
916.5	have in common?
919.26	What all of these things have in common
919.26	is that they cost money.
925.58	Some of the people in the room
925.58	might be old enough
927.98	to remember the guy
927.98	on the old oil filter commercial.
932.42	"He used to say, ""Well, you can pay me now"
932.42	"or you can pay me later."""
939.3	What we're doing
939.3	in the death penalty system
943.86	is we're paying later.
947.14	But the thing is
947.14	that for every 15,000 dollars
951.06	that we spend intervening
953.26	in the lives of economically
953.26	and otherwise disadvantaged kids
957.02	in those earlier chapters,
958.34	we save 80,000 dollars
958.34	in crime-related costs down the road.
963.06	Even if you don't agree that
963.06	there's a moral imperative that we do it,
969.62	it just makes economic sense.
973.46	I want to tell you about the last
973.46	conversation that I had with Will.
977.58	It was the day that
977.58	he was going to be executed,
982.94	and we were just talking.
985.38	There was nothing left to do in his case.
988.54	And we were talking about his life.
991.02	And he was talking first about his dad,
991.02	who he hardly knew, who had died,
995.62	and then about his mom,
995.62	who he did know, who was still alive.
1001.14	And I said to him,
1003.86	"""I know the story."
1005.86	I've read the records.
1007.78	"I know that she tried to kill you."""
1010.18	"I said, ""But I've always wondered"
1011.82	whether you really
1011.82	"actually remember that."""
1014.82	"I said, ""I don't remember anything"
1014.82	from when I was five years old.
1018.86	Maybe you just remember
1018.86	"somebody telling you."""
1021.66	And he looked at me and he leaned forward,
1024.06	"and he said, ""Professor,"" --"
1025.46	he'd known me for 12 years,
1025.46	he still called me Professor.
1028.18	"He said, ""Professor,"
1028.18	I don't mean any disrespect by this,
1031.22	but when your mama
1031.22	picks up a butcher knife
1033.7	that looks bigger than you are,
1036.1	and chases you through the house
1036.1	screaming she's going to kill you,
1039.9	and you have to lock yourself
1039.9	in the bathroom
1042.22	and lean against the door
1043.5	and holler for help
1043.5	"until the police get there,"""
1047.26	he looked at me and he said,
1049.22	"""that's something you don't forget."""
1052.74	I hope there's one thing
1052.74	you all won't forget:
1055.46	In between the time
1055.46	you arrived here this morning
1057.82	and the time we break for lunch,
1059.42	there are going to be
1059.42	four homicides in the United States.
1062.9	We're going to devote
1062.9	enormous social resources
1066.1	to punishing the people
1066.1	who commit those crimes,
1068.38	and that's appropriate
1069.62	because we should punish
1069.62	people who do bad things.
1072.02	But three of those crimes are preventable.
1075.14	If we make the picture bigger
1078.42	and devote our attention
1078.42	to the earlier chapters,
1082.62	then we're never going
1082.62	to write the first sentence
1086.1	that begins the death penalty story.
1088.94	Thank you.
1090.18	(Applause)
