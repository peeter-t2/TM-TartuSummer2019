13.349	This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.
19.124	This might be the most
19.124	important sneaker in history.
23.111	First released in 1988,
24.938	this is the shoe that started
24.938	Nike marketing as we know it.
29.046	This is the shoe that propelled
29.046	the entire Air Jordan lineage,
32.864	and perhaps saved Nike.
34.907	The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
34.907	did for sneakers
37.844	what the iPhone did for phones.
40.11	It's been re-released four times.
42.637	Every celebrity's been seen wearing it.
44.805	There's a site about what to wear
44.805	with the Black Cement.
47.484	It's been right under
47.484	your nose for decades
50.148	and you never looked down.
52.577	And right about now,
54.367	most of you are probably
54.367	"thinking, ""Sneakers?"""
58.097	(Laughter)
60.076	Yes.
61.262	Yes, sneakers.
63.805	Some extraordinary things about sneakers
67.412	and data
69.025	and Nike
70.524	and how they're all related, possibly,
70.524	to the future of all online commerce.
75.259	In 2011,
76.443	the last time the Jordan 3
76.443	Black Cement was released,
79.446	at a retail of 160 dollars,
81.803	it sold out globally in minutes.
84.286	And that's because people were camped
84.286	outside of sneaker stores
87.303	for days before it went on sale.
89.399	And just minutes after that,
90.867	thousands of those pairs were on eBay
90.867	for two and three times retail.
94.923	In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay
94.923	right now, four years later.
100.107	But here's the thing:
101.729	this happens every single Saturday.
105.56	Every week there's another
105.56	release or two or three,
108.131	and every shoe has a story
110.409	as rich and compelling
110.409	as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.
114.069	This is Nike building
114.069	the marketplace for sneakerheads --
118.249	people who collect sneakers --
122.049	and my daughter.
123.321	(Laughter)
125.27	"That's an ""I love Dad"" T-shirt."
128.244	For the brands, sneakerheads
128.244	are a very important demographic.
131.437	These are the tastemakers;
131.437	these are the Apple fanboys.
135.383	Because who else is going to buy
136.946	a pair of $8,000
136.946	Back to the Future sneakers?
140.603	(Laughter)
142.465	Yeah, 8,000 dollars.
145.364	And while that's obviously the anomaly,
147.739	the resell sneaker market
147.739	is definitely not.
150.941	Thirty years in the making,
152.789	what started as an underground culture
154.749	of a few people who like sneakers
154.749	just a bit too much --
157.754	(Laughter)
160.524	Now we have sneaker addictions.
162.758	In a market where in the past 12 months,
164.71	there have been over
164.71	nine million pairs of shoes
166.988	resold in the United States alone,
169.405	at a value of 1.2 billion dollars.
173.669	And that's a conservative estimate --
175.732	I should know, I am a sneakerhead.
178.959	This is my collection.
180.981	In the pantheon of great collections,
180.981	mine doesn't even register.
185.392	I have about 250 pairs,
185.392	but trust me, I am small-time.
188.462	People have thousands.
190.759	I'm a very typical
194.139	I grew up playing basketball
194.139	when Michael Jordan played,
196.796	I always wanted Air Jordans,
198.16	my mother would never buy me Air Jordans,
200.153	as soon as I got some money
200.153	I bought Air Jordans --
202.57	literally, we all have
202.57	the exact same story.
204.667	But here's where mine diverged.
207.166	After starting three companies,
207.166	I took a job as a strategy consultant,
211.285	when I very quickly realized that
211.285	I didn't know the first thing about data.
215.95	But I learned, because I had to,
218.762	and I liked it.
220.08	So I thought, I wonder if I could
220.08	get ahold of some sneaker data,
223.516	just to play with for my own amusement.
225.949	The goal was to develop a price guide,
227.846	a real data-driven view of the market.
230.373	And four years later, we're analyzing
230.373	over 25 million transactions,
234.726	providing real-time analytics
234.726	on thousands of sneakers.
238.331	Now sneakerheads check prices
238.331	while camping out for releases.
242.54	Others have used the data
242.54	to validate insurance claims.
246.781	And the top investment banks in the world
248.786	now use resell data to analyze
248.786	the retail footwear industry.
253.416	And here's the best part:
255.03	sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.
258.583	(Laughter)
260.617	Sneakerheads can track the value
260.617	of their collection over time,
263.614	compare it to others,
264.789	and have access to the same
264.789	analytics you might
267.043	for your online brokerage account.
268.987	So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection
268.987	and identifies which 352 are his.
273.915	He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars --
276.828	frankly, a modest collection.
278.853	At the asset level,
278.853	he can see gain-loss by shoe.
282.486	Here he's made over
286.183	I have one of those.
287.538	(Laughter)
290.655	So an unregulated
290.655	1.2 billion dollar industry
294.126	that thrives as much on the street
294.126	as it does online,
296.719	and has spawned fundamental
296.719	financial services for sneakers?
301.113	At some point I asked myself
301.113	what's really going on in the market,
304.273	and two comparisons started to emerge.
306.612	Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?
310.387	(Laughter)
311.612	In fact, one guy emailed to say
313.504	he thought his 15-year-old son
313.504	was selling drugs
317.792	and later found out
317.792	he was selling sneakers.
320.853	(Laughter)
322.757	And now they use the data
322.757	to do it together.
325.711	And that's because sneakers
325.711	are an investment opportunity
328.433	where none other exists.
329.616	And I don't just mean the kid
329.616	selling sneakers instead of drugs.
332.677	How about all kids?
334.391	You have to be 18
334.391	to play the stock market.
337.967	I sold chewing gum in sixth grade,
340.331	Blow Pops in ninth grade
341.933	and collected baseball cards
341.933	through high school.
344.378	The cards are long dead,
346.199	and the candy market's
346.199	usually quite local.
349.122	For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal
349.122	and accessible investment opportunity --
354.873	a democratized stock market,
358.664	but also unregulated.
360.759	Which is why the story
360.759	you're probably most familiar with
363.565	is people killing each other for sneakers.
366.606	And while that definitely
366.606	happens and is tragic,
370.405	it's not nearly the epidemic
370.405	some media would have you believe.
374.274	In fact, it's a very small piece
374.274	of a much bigger and better story.
378.483	So sneakers have clear similarities
380.203	to both the stock exchange
380.203	and the illegal drug trade,
383.331	but perhaps the most fundamental
383.331	is the existence of a central actor.
387.752	Someone is making the rules.
390.988	In the case of sneakers,
390.988	that someone is Nike.
395.91	Let me walk you through some numbers.
398.186	The resell market,
398.186	we know, is $1.2 billion.
401.446	Nike, including Jordan brand,
403.768	accounts for 96 percent of all shoes
403.768	sold on the secondary market.
408.308	Just complete domination.
409.924	Sneakerheads love Jordans.
412.536	And profit on the secondary market
412.536	is about a third.
415.571	That means that sneakerheads
415.571	made 380 million dollars
420.665	selling Nikes last year.
423.03	Let's jump to retail for a second.
425.071	Skechers, earlier this year,
426.515	became the number two
426.515	footwear brand in the country,
429.329	surpassing Adidas --
429.329	this was a big deal.
432.187	And in the 12 months ending in June,
434.985	Skechers's net income
434.985	was 209 million dollars.
439.853	That means that Nike's customers
443.211	make almost twice as much profit
443.211	as their closest competitor.
447.758	That --
449.581	(Laughter)
453.029	How is that even possible?
456.249	The sneaker market
456.249	is just supply and demand,
458.854	but Nike's gotten very good at using
458.854	supply -- limited sneakers --
463.6	and the distribution of those sneakers
463.6	to their own benefit.
467.437	So it's really just supply.
469.473	Sneakerheads joke that as long
469.473	as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.
473.262	Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars
473.262	do so because they're very rare.
477.095	It's no different than any other
477.095	collectible market,
479.885	only this isn't a market at all.
483.508	It's a false construct created by Nike --
485.977	ingeniously created by Nike, in the most
485.977	positive sense -- to sell more shoes.
490.613	And in the process,
491.788	it provided tens of thousands of people
491.788	with life-long passions,
495.18	myself included.
497.488	If Nike wanted to kill the resell market,
497.488	they could do so tomorrow,
500.727	all they have to do is release more shoes.
502.783	But we certainly don't want them to,
502.783	nor is it in their best interest.
507.345	That's because unlike Apple, who will sell
507.345	an iPhone to anyone who wants one,
511.606	Nike doesn't make their money
511.606	by just selling $200 sneakers.
515.448	They sell millions of shoes to millions
515.448	of people for 60 dollars.
519.146	And sneakerheads are the ones
519.146	who drive the marketing
521.709	and the hype and the PR
521.709	and the brand cachet,
524.263	and enable Nike to sell millions
524.263	of $60 sneakers.
529.501	It's marketing.
530.906	It's marketing the likes of which
530.906	has never been seen before --
534.042	this isn't in any textbook.
535.486	For 15 years Nike has propped up
535.486	an artificial commodities market,
539.05	with a Facebook-level hyped IPO
539.05	every single weekend.
543.537	Drive by any Footlocker at 8am
543.537	on a Saturday morning,
546.234	and there will be a line down the street
546.234	and around the block,
549.209	and sometimes those kids
549.209	have been waiting there all week.
552.437	You know those crazy iPhone lines
552.437	you see on the news every other year?
556.232	Nike lines happen 104 times more often.
561.075	So Nike sets the rules.
562.627	And they do so by controlling
562.627	supply and distribution.
566.014	But once a pair leaves
566.014	the retail channel, it's the Wild West.
570.5	There are very few -- if any --
570.5	legal, unregulated markets of this size.
576.48	So Nike is definitely
576.48	not the stock exchange.
579.827	In fact, there is no central exchange.
582.634	By last count, there were 48 different
582.634	online markets that I know of.
588.61	Some are eBay clones,
588.61	some are mobile markets,
591.502	and then you have consignment shops
591.502	and brick-and-mortar stores,
594.548	and sneaker conventions,
594.548	and reseller sites,
596.636	and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter --
599.065	literally, anywhere sneakerheads
599.065	come into contact with each other,
602.621	shoes will be bought and sold.
605.504	But that means no efficiencies,
605.504	no transparency,
610.539	sometimes not even authenticity.
613.584	Can you imagine if that's
613.584	how stocks were bought?
617.125	What if the way to buy
617.125	a share of Apple stock
619.433	was to search over 100 places
619.433	online and off,
622.312	including every time
622.312	you walk down the street
624.559	just hoping to pass someone
624.559	wearing some Apple stock?
627.221	Never knowing who had the best price,
629.112	or even if the stock
629.112	you were looking at was real.
631.703	That would surely make you say:
633.544	[WTF?]
635.622	Of course that's not how we buy stock.
638.904	But what if that's not how
638.904	we need to buy sneakers either?
642.923	What if the inverse is true,
644.329	and what if we could buy sneakers
645.939	exactly the same way as we buy stock?
647.756	And what if it wasn't just sneakers,
647.756	but any similar product,
650.669	like watches and handbags
650.669	and women's shoes,
652.796	and any collectible, any seasonal item
652.796	and any markdown item?
656.168	What if there was
656.168	a stock market for commerce?
660.046	A stock market of things.
664.167	And not only could you buy in a much more
664.167	educated and efficient manner,
668.514	but you could engage in all
668.514	the sophisticated financial transactions
671.778	you can with the stock market.
673.385	Shorts and options and futures
675.012	and well, maybe you see
675.012	where this is going.
678.146	Maybe you want to invest
678.146	in a stock market of things.
682.997	Because if you had invested in a pair
682.997	of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,
689.293	you could either be wearing them onstage,
691.714	(Laughter)
693.657	or have earned 162 percent
693.657	on your money --
697.67	double the S&amp;P and 20 percent
697.67	more than Apple.
701.039	(Laughter)
703.203	And that's why
703.203	we're talking about sneakers.
706.228	Thank you.
707.403	(Applause)
