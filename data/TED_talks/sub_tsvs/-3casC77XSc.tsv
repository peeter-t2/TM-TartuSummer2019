25	♫ Like the heather ♫
28	♫ on the hillside ♫
32	♫ as they drove us ♫
35	♫ from the Highlands ♫
39	♫ Like the ice flow ♫
43	♫ from the Arctic ♫
46	♫ where we landed ♫
50	♫ in Newfoundland ♫
55	♫ There's a color ♫
60	♫ to my sorrow ♫
63	♫ There's a name for ♫
67	♫ all this sadness ♫
70	♫ Like the ocean ♫
74	♫ in between us ♫
77	♫ I am blue ♫
85	♫ Blue is a river ♫
89	♫ Blue remembered ♫
93	♫ Blue water ♫
98	♫ running clear ♫
101	♫ Blue like a planet ♫
105	♫ to a spaceman ♫
108	♫ Blue river ♫
112	♫ of my tears ♫
116	(Fiddle and synthesizer)
149	♫ So I came here ♫
152	♫ to the city ♫
156	♫ where the dream burns ♫
160	♫ like a furnace ♫
164	♫ And I dazzled ♫
168	♫ in these dark streets ♫
171	♫ like a diamond ♫
176	♫ in a coalface ♫
180	♫ Then the cold wind ♫
184	♫ from the islands ♫
187	♫ blew a storm cloud ♫
191	♫ across the new moon ♫
196	♫ Like the gun smoke ♫
200	♫ above the houses ♫
203	♫ in my home ♫
210	♫ Blue is a river ♫
214	♫ Blue remembered ♫
219	♫ Blue water ♫
223	♫ running clear ♫
226	♫ Blue like a planet ♫
230	♫ to a spaceman ♫
234	♫ Blue river ♫
239	♫ of my tears ♫
242	♫ Blue river ♫
247	♫ of my tears ♫
250	(Fiddle and synthesizer)
311	(Applause)
