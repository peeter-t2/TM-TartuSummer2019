22.26	Today, I'm going to take you
24.26	around the world in 18 minutes.
26.26	My base of operations is in the U.S.,
29.26	but let's start at the other end of the map,
31.26	in Kyoto, Japan,
33.26	where I was living with a Japanese family
36.26	while I was doing part of my dissertational research
41.26	I knew even then that I would encounter
43.26	cultural differences and misunderstandings,
45.26	but they popped up when I least expected it.
48.26	On my first day,
50.26	I went to a restaurant,
52.26	and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.
54.26	After a pause, the waiter said,
56.26	"""One does not put sugar in green tea."""
60.26	"""I know,"" I said. ""I'm aware of this custom."
62.26	"But I really like my tea sweet."""
65.26	In response, he gave me an even more courteous version
68.26	of the same explanation.
70.26	"""One does not put sugar"
72.26	"in green tea."""
75.26	"""I understand,"" I said,"
77.26	"""that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,"
79.26	but I'd like to put some sugar
81.26	"in my green tea."""
83.26	(Laughter)
85.26	Surprised by my insistence,
87.26	the waiter took up the issue with the manager.
89.26	Pretty soon,
91.26	a lengthy discussion ensued,
93.26	and finally the manager came over to me and said,
96.26	"""I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."""
99.26	(Laughter)
101.26	Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,
104.26	I ordered a cup of coffee,
106.26	which the waiter brought over promptly.
108.26	Resting on the saucer
110.26	were two packets of sugar.
113.26	My failure to procure myself
116.26	a cup of sweet, green tea
118.26	was not due to a simple misunderstanding.
121.26	This was due to a fundamental difference
123.26	in our ideas about choice.
126.26	From my American perspective,
128.26	when a paying customer makes a reasonable request
130.26	based on her preferences,
132.26	she has every right to have that request met.
135.26	The American way, to quote Burger King,
137.26	"is to ""have it your way,"""
139.26	because, as Starbucks says,
141.26	"""happiness is in your choices."""
143.26	(Laughter)
145.26	But from the Japanese perspective,
148.26	it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --
151.26	(Laughter)
153.26	in this case, the ignorant gaijin --
155.26	from making the wrong choice.
158.26	Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea
160.26	was inappropriate according to cultural standards,
163.26	and they were doing their best to help me save face.
166.26	Americans tend to believe
168.26	that they've reached some sort of pinnacle
170.26	in the way they practice choice.
172.26	They think that choice, as seen through the American lens
175.26	best fulfills an innate and universal
177.26	desire for choice in all humans.
180.26	Unfortunately,
182.26	these beliefs are based on assumptions
184.26	that don't always hold true
186.26	in many countries, in many cultures.
189.26	At times they don't even hold true
191.26	at America's own borders.
193.26	I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions
195.26	and the problems associated with them.
198.26	As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking
200.26	about some of your own assumptions
202.26	and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
205.26	First assumption:
207.26	if a choice affects you,
209.26	then you should be the one to make it.
211.26	This is the only way to ensure
213.26	that your preferences and interests
215.26	will be most fully accounted for.
218.26	It is essential for success.
221.26	In America, the primary locus of choice
224.26	is the individual.
226.26	People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,
229.26	regardless of what other people want or recommend.
232.26	"It's called ""being true to yourself."""
235.26	But do all individuals benefit
237.26	from taking such an approach to choice?
240.26	Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies
242.26	in which we sought the answer to this very question.
245.26	In one study,
247.26	which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,
250.26	we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children
253.26	into the laboratory,
255.26	and we divided them up into three groups.
257.26	The first group came in,
259.26	and they were greeted by Miss Smith,
261.26	who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
264.26	The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,
267.26	and they even got to choose which marker
269.26	they would write their answers with.
271.26	When the second group of children came in,
273.26	they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,
276.26	but this time Miss Smith told them
278.26	which anagrams to do
280.26	and which markers to write their answers with.
283.26	Now when the third group came in,
286.26	they were told that their anagrams and their markers
289.26	had been chosen by their mothers.
291.26	(Laughter)
293.26	In reality,
295.26	the kids who were told what to do,
297.26	whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,
299.26	were actually given the very same activity,
301.26	which their counterparts in the first group
303.26	had freely chosen.
305.26	With this procedure, we were able to ensure
307.26	that the kids across the three groups
309.26	all did the same activity,
311.26	making it easier for us to compare performance.
314.26	Such small differences in the way we administered the activity
317.26	yielded striking differences
319.26	in how well they performed.
321.26	Anglo-Americans,
323.26	they did two and a half times more anagrams
326.26	when they got to choose them,
328.26	as compared to when it was
330.26	chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.
333.26	It didn't matter who did the choosing,
336.26	if the task was dictated by another,
338.26	their performance suffered.
340.26	In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed
343.26	when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
346.26	(Laughter)
348.26	One girl named Mary said,
350.26	"""You asked my mother?"""
353.26	(Laughter)
355.26	In contrast,
357.26	Asian-American children
359.26	performed best when they believed
361.26	their mothers had made the choice,
364.26	second best when they chose for themselves,
367.26	and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.
370.26	A girl named Natsumi
372.26	even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room
374.26	and tugged on her skirt and asked,
376.26	"""Could you please tell my mommy"
378.26	"I did it just like she said?"""
382.26	The first-generation children were strongly influenced
385.26	by their immigrant parents'
387.26	approach to choice.
389.26	For them, choice was not just a way
391.26	of defining and asserting
393.26	their individuality,
395.26	but a way to create community and harmony
397.26	by deferring to the choices
399.26	of people whom they trusted and respected.
402.26	If they had a concept of being true to one's self,
405.26	then that self, most likely,
407.26	[was] composed, not of an individual,
409.26	but of a collective.
411.26	Success was just as much about pleasing key figures
414.26	as it was about satisfying
416.26	one's own preferences.
418.26	Or, you could say that
420.26	the individual's preferences were shaped
422.26	by the preferences of specific others.
426.26	The assumption then that we do best
428.26	when the individual self chooses
430.26	only holds
432.26	when that self
434.26	is clearly divided from others.
437.26	When, in contrast,
439.26	two or more individuals
441.26	see their choices and their outcomes
443.26	as intimately connected,
445.26	then they may amplify one another's success
448.26	by turning choosing
450.26	into a collective act.
452.26	To insist that they choose independently
455.26	might actually compromise
457.26	both their performance
459.26	and their relationships.
461.26	Yet that is exactly what
463.26	the American paradigm demands.
465.26	It leaves little room for interdependence
468.26	or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
471.26	It requires that everyone treat choice
474.26	as a private and self-defining act.
478.26	People that have grown up in such a paradigm
480.26	might find it motivating,
482.26	but it is a mistake to assume
484.26	that everyone thrives under the pressure
486.26	of choosing alone.
489.26	The second assumption which informs the American view of choice
492.26	goes something like this.
494.26	The more choices you have,
496.26	the more likely you are
498.26	to make the best choice.
500.26	So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,
503.26	and Amazon, with 27 million books
506.26	and Match.com with -- what is it? --
512.26	You will surely find the perfect match.
515.26	Let's test this assumption
517.26	by heading over to Eastern Europe.
519.26	Here, I interviewed people
521.26	who were residents of formerly communist countries,
524.26	who had all faced the challenge
526.26	of transitioning to a more
528.26	democratic and capitalistic society.
531.26	One of the most interesting revelations
533.26	came not from an answer to a question,
535.26	but from a simple gesture of hospitality.
538.26	When the participants arrived for their interview,
541.26	I offered them a set of drinks:
543.26	Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --
545.26	seven, to be exact.
547.26	During the very first session,
549.26	which was run in Russia,
551.26	one of the participants made a comment
553.26	that really caught me off guard.
556.26	"""Oh, but it doesn't matter."
558.26	"It's all just soda. That's just one choice."""
561.26	(Murmuring)
563.26	I was so struck by this comment that from then on,
565.26	I started to offer all the participants
567.26	those seven sodas,
569.26	"and I asked them, ""How many choices are these?"""
572.26	Again and again,
574.26	they perceived these seven different sodas,
577.26	not as seven choices, but as one choice:
580.26	soda or no soda.
582.26	When I put out juice and water
584.26	in addition to these seven sodas,
586.26	now they perceived it as only three choices --
588.26	juice, water and soda.
591.26	Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,
594.26	not just to a particular flavor of soda,
597.26	but to a particular brand.
599.26	You know, research shows repeatedly
602.26	that we can't actually tell the difference
604.26	between Coke and Pepsi.
606.26	Of course, you and I know
608.26	that Coke is the better choice.
610.26	(Laughter)
616.26	For modern Americans who are exposed
618.26	to more options and more ads associated with options
621.26	than anyone else in the world,
623.26	choice is just as much about who they are
625.26	as it is about what the product is.
628.26	Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,
631.26	and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters
634.26	and so every choice matters.
636.26	But for Eastern Europeans,
639.26	the sudden availability of all these
641.26	consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.
644.26	They were flooded with choice
646.26	before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.
650.26	"When asked, ""What words and images"
652.26	"do you associate with choice?"""
654.26	Grzegorz from Warsaw said,
657.26	"""Ah, for me it is fear."
659.26	There are some dilemmas you see.
661.26	"I am used to no choice."""
663.26	Bohdan from Kiev said,
665.26	in response to how he felt about
667.26	the new consumer marketplace,
669.26	"""It is too much."
671.26	"We do not need everything that is there."""
673.26	A sociologist from
675.26	the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,
678.26	"""The older generation jumped from nothing"
681.26	to choice all around them.
683.26	They were never given a chance to learn
685.26	"how to react."""
687.26	And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,
690.26	"""I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum."
693.26	I don't mean to say that I want no choice,
696.26	"but many of these choices are quite artificial."""
700.26	In reality, many choices are between things
703.26	that are not that much different.
707.26	The value of choice
709.26	depends on our ability
711.26	to perceive differences
713.26	between the options.
715.26	Americans train their whole lives
717.26	"to play ""spot the difference."""
720.26	They practice this from such an early age
722.26	that they've come to believe that everyone
724.26	must be born with this ability.
726.26	In fact, though all humans share
728.26	a basic need and desire for choice,
731.26	we don't all see choice in the same places
734.26	or to the same extent.
736.26	When someone can't see how one choice
738.26	is unlike another,
740.26	or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,
743.26	the process of choosing can be
745.26	confusing and frustrating.
748.26	Instead of making better choices,
750.26	we become overwhelmed by choice,
752.26	sometimes even afraid of it.
755.26	Choice no longer offers opportunities,
757.26	but imposes constraints.
759.26	It's not a marker of liberation,
761.26	but of suffocation
763.26	by meaningless minutiae.
765.26	In other words,
767.26	choice can develop into the very opposite
769.26	of everything it represents
771.26	in America
773.26	when it is thrust upon those
775.26	who are insufficiently prepared for it.
778.26	But it is not only other people
780.26	in other places
782.26	that are feeling the pressure
784.26	of ever-increasing choice.
786.26	Americans themselves are discovering
788.26	that unlimited choice
790.26	seems more attractive in theory
792.26	than in practice.
794.26	We all have physical, mental
797.26	and emotional (Laughter) limitations
799.26	that make it impossible for us
801.26	to process every single choice we encounter,
804.26	even in the grocery store,
806.26	let alone over the course of our entire lives.
809.26	A number of my studies have shown
812.26	that when you give people 10 or more options
814.26	when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,
817.26	whether it be health care, investment,
819.26	other critical areas.
821.26	Yet still, many of us believe
823.26	that we should make all our own choices
826.26	and seek out even more of them.
829.26	This brings me to the third,
832.26	and perhaps most problematic, assumption:
835.26	"""You must never"
837.26	"say no to choice."""
840.26	To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
842.26	and then hop across the pond to France.
845.26	Right outside Chicago,
848.26	a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,
850.26	were about to have their first baby.
853.26	They'd already picked out a name for her,
855.26	Barbara, after her grandmother.
858.26	One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,
861.26	she started to experience contractions
863.26	and was rushed to the emergency room.
866.26	The baby was delivered through a C-section,
869.26	but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,
871.26	a loss of oxygen to the brain.
874.26	Unable to breathe on her own,
876.26	she was put on a ventilator.
878.26	Two days later,
880.26	the doctors gave the Mitchells
882.26	a choice:
884.26	They could either remove Barbara
886.26	off the life support,
888.26	in which case she would die within a matter of hours,
891.26	or they could keep her on life support,
894.26	in which case she might still die
896.26	within a matter of days.
898.26	If she survived, she would remain
900.26	in a permanent vegetative state,
903.26	never able to walk, talk
906.26	or interact with others.
909.26	What do they do?
911.26	What do any parent do?
917.26	In a study I conducted
919.26	with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,
921.26	American and French parents
923.26	were interviewed.
925.26	They had all suffered
927.26	the same tragedy.
929.26	In all cases, the life support was removed,
932.26	and the infants had died.
934.26	But there was a big difference.
936.26	In France, the doctors decided whether and when
939.26	the life support would be removed,
942.26	while in the United States,
944.26	the final decision rested with the parents.
948.26	We wondered:
950.26	does this have an effect on how the parents
952.26	cope with the loss of their loved one?
955.26	We found that it did.
958.26	Even up to a year later,
960.26	American parents
962.26	were more likely to express negative emotions,
964.26	as compared to their French counterparts.
967.26	French parents were more likely to say things like,
970.26	"""Noah was here for so little time,"
973.26	but he taught us so much.
975.26	"He gave us a new perspective on life."""
979.26	American parents were more likely to say things like,
982.26	"""What if? What if?"""
985.26	Another parent complained,
987.26	"""I feel as if they purposefully tortured me."
990.26	"How did they get me to do that?"""
993.26	And another parent said,
995.26	"""I feel as if I've played a role"
997.26	"in an execution."""
1000.26	But when the American parents were asked
1002.26	if they would rather have had
1004.26	the doctors make the decision,
1007.26	"they all said, ""No."""
1009.26	They could not imagine
1011.26	turning that choice over to another,
1013.26	even though having made that choice
1016.26	made them feel trapped,
1018.26	guilty, angry.
1020.26	In a number of cases
1022.26	they were even clinically depressed.
1025.26	These parents could not contemplate
1027.26	giving up the choice,
1029.26	because to do so would have gone contrary
1031.26	to everything they had been taught
1034.26	and everything they had come to believe
1036.26	about the power
1038.26	and purpose of choice.
1041.26	"In her essay, ""The White Album,"""
1044.26	Joan Didion writes,
1047.26	"""We tell ourselves stories"
1049.26	in order to live.
1051.26	We interpret what we see,
1053.26	select the most workable
1055.26	of the multiple choices.
1057.26	We live entirely by the imposition
1059.26	of a narrative line
1061.26	upon disparate images,
1063.26	by the idea with which we have learned to freeze
1066.26	the shifting phantasmagoria,
1068.26	"which is our actual experience."""
1073.26	The story Americans tell,
1075.26	the story upon which
1077.26	the American dream depends,
1079.26	is the story of limitless choice.
1082.26	This narrative
1084.26	promises so much:
1086.26	freedom, happiness,
1088.26	success.
1090.26	It lays the world at your feet and says,
1093.26	"""You can have anything, everything."""
1097.26	It's a great story,
1099.26	and it's understandable why they would be reluctant
1101.26	to revise it.
1104.26	But when you take a close look,
1106.26	you start to see the holes,
1108.26	and you start to see that the story
1110.26	can be told in many other ways.
1113.26	Americans have so often tried to
1115.26	disseminate their ideas of choice,
1118.26	believing that they will be, or ought to be,
1121.26	welcomed with open hearts and minds.
1124.26	But the history books and the daily news tell us
1127.26	it doesn't always work out that way.
1130.26	The phantasmagoria,
1132.26	the actual experience that we try to understand
1134.26	and organize through narrative,
1137.26	varies from place to place.
1140.26	No single narrative serves the needs
1142.26	of everyone everywhere.
1146.26	Moreover, Americans themselves
1149.26	could benefit from incorporating
1152.26	new perspectives into their own narrative,
1155.26	which has been driving their choices
1157.26	for so long.
1160.26	Robert Frost once said that,
1163.26	"""It is poetry that is lost in translation."""
1167.26	This suggests that
1169.26	whatever is beautiful and moving,
1171.26	whatever gives us a new way to see,
1174.26	cannot be communicated to those
1176.26	who speak a different language.
1179.26	But Joseph Brodsky said that,
1181.26	"""It is poetry"
1183.26	"that is gained in translation,"""
1185.26	suggesting that translation
1187.26	can be a creative,
1189.26	transformative act.
1192.26	When it comes to choice,
1194.26	we have far more to gain than to lose
1197.26	by engaging in the many
1200.26	translations of the narratives.
1203.26	Instead of replacing
1205.26	one story with another,
1207.26	we can learn from and revel in
1209.26	the many versions that exist
1212.26	and the many that have yet to be written.
1215.26	No matter where we're from
1218.26	and what your narrative is,
1220.26	we all have a responsibility
1222.26	to open ourselves up to a wider array
1224.26	of what choice can do,
1227.26	and what it can represent.
1230.26	And this does not lead to
1232.26	a paralyzing moral relativism.
1235.26	Rather, it teaches us when
1237.26	and how to act.
1239.26	It brings us that much closer
1241.26	to realizing the full potential of choice,
1244.26	to inspiring the hope
1246.26	and achieving the freedom
1248.26	that choice promises
1250.26	but doesn't always deliver.
1252.26	If we learn to speak to one another,
1255.26	albeit through translation,
1258.26	then we can begin to see choice
1260.26	in all its strangeness,
1262.26	complexity
1265.26	and compelling beauty.
1267.26	Thank you.
1269.26	(Applause)
1280.26	Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
1283.26	Sheena, there is a detail about your biography
1286.26	that we have not written in the program book.
1288.26	But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
1291.26	And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:
1294.26	How does that influence your study of choosing
1297.26	because that's an activity
1299.26	that for most people is associated with visual inputs
1302.26	like aesthetics and color and so on?
1306.26	Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that
1308.26	because one of the things that's interesting about being blind
1311.26	is you actually get a different vantage point
1313.26	when you observe the way
1315.26	sighted people make choices.
1317.26	And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there
1319.26	that are very visual these days.
1321.26	Yeah, I -- as you would expect --
1323.26	get pretty frustrated by choices
1325.26	like what nail polish to put on
1327.26	because I have to rely on what other people suggest.
1329.26	And I can't decide.
1331.26	And so one time I was in a beauty salon,
1333.26	and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.
1336.26	"And one was called ""Ballet Slippers."""
1338.26	"And the other one was called ""Adorable."""
1341.26	(Laughter)
1343.26	And so I asked these two ladies,
1345.26	"and the one lady told me, ""Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"""
1347.26	"""Well, what does it look like?"""
1349.26	"""Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."""
1351.26	"""Okay, great."""
1353.26	"The other lady tells me to wear ""Adorable."""
1355.26	"""What does it look like?"""
1357.26	"""It's a glamorous shade of pink."""
1361.26	"And so I asked them, ""Well, how do I tell them apart?"
1363.26	"What's different about them?"""
1365.26	"And they said, ""Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."""
1367.26	Okay, we got that.
1369.26	And the only thing they had consensus on:
1371.26	well, if I could see them, I would
1373.26	clearly be able to tell them apart.
1375.26	(Laughter)
1377.26	And what I wondered was whether they were being affected
1380.26	by the name or the content of the color,
1382.26	so I decided to do a little experiment.
1385.26	So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,
1388.26	and I stripped the labels off.
1390.26	And I brought women into the laboratory,
1392.26	"and I asked them, ""Which one would you pick?"""
1397.26	of putting the same color nail polish
1399.26	in both those bottles.
1401.26	(Laughter)
1403.26	(Applause)
1407.26	At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.
1410.26	Now, of the women that could tell them apart,
1413.26	"when the labels were off, they picked ""Adorable,"""
1416.26	and when the labels were on,
1418.26	"they picked ""Ballet Slippers."""
1421.26	So as far as I can tell,
1423.26	a rose by any other name
1425.26	probably does look different
1427.26	and maybe even smells different.
1430.26	BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.
1433.26	(Applause)
