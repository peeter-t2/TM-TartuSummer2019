25	We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just
26	for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions
29	that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try
32	to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking
34	about with happiness is, what gives happiness --
37	or happiness, which I equate with joy in my
41	particular area, and I think there's something very
43	fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And
47	it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we
51	go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's
55	something about these things where our
57	expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
61	way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected
64	twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and
67	you find a joyful experience. You look at those
70	sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what
73	you'd expect. And there's something joyful about
75	it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all
78	these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try
81	and do in my lecture is go a little bit further
84	and see if I can violate your expectations in a
87	pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that
90	are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try
92	to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,
95	so I can make the audience here happy.
97	So I'm going to show you some ways that we can
100	violate your expectations. First of all, I want to
103	show you the particular illusion here. I want you
106	first of all when it pops up on the screen to
109	notice that the two holes are perpendicular to
111	each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These
115	are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now
126	I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
129	the film here so you can get a very interesting
131	experience. I want you to see how this illusion is
134	constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see
137	that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates
140	back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
146	Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very
149	bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it
152	from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's
155	true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does
160	that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do
164	it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop
167	it from happening. No. It's difficult.
174	And we can violate your expectations in a whole
177	variety of ways about representation, about shape,
180	about color and so forth and it's very primal. And
183	it's an interesting question to ponder, why these
186	things -- we find these things joyful. Why would
190	we find them joyful? So, here's something that
193	Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of
195	little things like this.
199	Again, this is not an optical trick. This is what
202	you would see. In other words, it's not a camera
222	cut. It's a perceptual trick.
235	OK. We can violate your expectations about
237	shape.
256	We can violate your expectations on representation
260	-- what an image represents. What do you see here?
265	How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand
272	if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised
276	their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,
278	go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the
282	best example of priming by experience that I know.
286	If you are a child under the age of 10 who
290	haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this
293	image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults
297	"here are saying, ""What dolphins? What dolphins?"""
299	But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --
302	in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to
305	ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll
307	see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,
310	if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also
313	tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on
316	experience.
320	Now, something like this can be used because this
323	is after all talk about design, too. This was
325	done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got
328	away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at
331	this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of
336	provocative positions. But they got it passed, and
339	actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do
343	these things.
344	Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did
352	when the Florida ballot was going around. You
356	know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for
358	Bush; count 'em again ...
363	You can violate your expectations about
366	experience. Here is an outside water fountain that
373	I created with some friends of mine, but you can
375	stop the water in drops and -- actually make all
378	the drops levitate. This is something we're
384	building for, you know, amusement parks and that
386	kind of stuff.
387	Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?
391	Do you see the middle section moving down and the
394	outer sections moving up? It's completely static.
398	It's a static image. How many people see this
400	illusion? It's completely static.
406	Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we
409	look at an image we see, you know, color, depth,
413	texture. And you can look at this whole scene and
416	analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than
419	the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is
421	actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
426	And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people
428	got irritated when they tried to talk to the
430	woman and she wouldn't respond.
435	Now, you can make design mistakes. Like this
439	building in New York. So that when you see it from
445	this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,
448	and when you walk around to the other side it
450	looks like the balconies go down. So there are
455	cases where you have mistakes in design that
457	incorporate illusions.
458	Or, you take this particular un-retouched
461	photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot
469	"of emails from people who say, ""Is there any"
471	"perceptual difference between males and females?"""
476	"And I really say, ""No."" I mean, women can navigate"
478	through the world just as well as males can -- and
481	why wouldn't they? However, this is the one
483	illusion that women can consistently do better
486	than males: in matching which head because they
489	rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.
495	Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show
497	design in illusions. I believe that the first
500	example of illusions being used purposely was by
505	da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So
511	that when you saw from one little angle was like
514	this. And this little technique got popular in the
520	hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
523	see it from one little point of view like this.
528	But these are early incorporations of illusions
531	brought to -- sort of high point with Hans
533	"Holbein's ""Ambassadors."" And Hans Holbein worked"
536	for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you
540	could walk down from the stair and you can see
542	this hidden skull.
546	All right, now I'm going to show you some
549	designers who work with illusions to give that
551	element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott
554	Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions
558	for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one
563	here on TED and happiness.
581	OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is
584	going to be a delightful talk and he has some of
587	his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we
594	-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur
597	Ganson.
609	Well, there's analog and digital. Thought that
617	was appropriate here.
623	And figure goes to ground.
638	And for the musicians.
659	"And of course, since happiness -- we want ""joy to the"
661	"world."""
671	Now, another great designer -- he's very well
673	known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just
678	builds some fantastic things. This is simply
680	amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view
687	it from one particular angle, you see its
696	reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.
714	Pianist transforms to violinist.
727	This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,
733	knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded
736	together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn
749	something in the sort of thing that I do, which
752	is there are people out there with a lot of time
754	on their hands.
759	Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images, like
765	creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --
767	un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging
769	them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after
773	"all, Einstein said, ""God does not play dice with"
776	"the universe."" Bert Herzog out of un-retouched"
781	keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John
786	Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil
790	cabinets.
792	Now, I'm going to skip ahead since I'm sort of running
794	[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've
797	created, some new type of illusions. I've done
802	something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So
806	you see these kids the same size here, running
810	down the hall. The two table tops of the same size.
813	They're looking out two directions at once. You
817	have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And
824	that's something for you to think about, all
826	right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within
828	smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which
832	is impossible. You can see the two kids are
837	looking out simultaneously out of two different
839	directions at once. Now can you believe these two
846	table tops are the same size and shape? They are.
850	So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,
856	those two figures are identical in size and shape.
862	And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort
866	of rendered fashion, how much stronger the
869	illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought
871	you a little joy and happiness, and if you're
873	interested in seeing more cool effects, see me
876	outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.
