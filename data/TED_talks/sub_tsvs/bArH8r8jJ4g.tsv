12.914	I suspect that
14.323	every aid worker in Africa
16.08	comes to a time in her career
17.673	when she wants to take all 
17.673	the money for her project —
20.989	maybe it's a school or a training program —
24.091	pack it in a suitcase,
25.98	get on a plane flying over the
25.98	poorest villages in the country,
29.964	and start throwing that money out the window.
33.148	Because to a veteran aid worker,
35.464	the idea of putting cold, hard cash
38.171	into the hands of the poorest people on Earth
41.21	doesn't sound crazy,
42.865	it sounds really satisfying.
46.941	I had that moment right about the 10-year mark,
49.843	and luckily, that's also when I learned
52.31	that this idea actually exists,
55.974	and it might be just what the aid system needs.
59.817	Economists call it an unconditional cash transfer,
62.52	and it's exactly that: It's cash given
64.68	with no strings attached.
66.952	Governments in developing countries
68.516	have been doing this for decades,
70.192	and it's only now, with more evidence
72.724	and new technology that it's possible
75.915	to make this a model for delivering aid.
80.234	It's a pretty simple idea, right?
83.148	Well, why did I spend a decade doing other stuff
87.254	for the poor?
89.392	Honestly, I believed that I could do more good
92.935	with money for the poor
94.881	than the poor could do for themselves.
97.491	I held two assumptions:
98.524	One, that poor people are poor in part
101.113	because they're uneducated and
103.115	don't make good choices;
105.275	two is that we then need people like me
107.986	to figure out what they need and get it to them.
111.724	It turns out, the evidence says otherwise.
115.946	In recent years, researchers have been studying
118.795	what happens when we give poor people cash.
122.2	Dozens of studies show across the board
124.871	that people use cash transfers
127.627	to improve their own lives.
129.795	Pregnant women in Uruguay buy better food
132.643	and give birth to healthier babies.
134.877	Sri Lankan men invest in their businesses.
137.971	Researchers who studied our work in Kenya
140.669	found that people invested in a range of assets,
143.586	from livestock to equipment 
143.586	to home improvements,
147.936	and they saw increases in income
150.058	from business and farming
152.441	one year after the cash was sent.
156.131	None of these studies found that people
158.695	spend more on drinking or smoking
161.104	or that people work less.
163.609	In fact, they work more.
167.717	Now, these are all material needs.
170.98	In Vietnam, elderly recipients used
174.151	their cash transfers to pay for coffins.
178.662	As someone who wonders if Maslow got it wrong,
182.673	I find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs
187.4	deeply humbling.
189.667	I don't know if I would have chosen to give food
191.88	or equipment or coffins,
195.491	which begs the question:
197.781	How good are we at allocating resources
200.777	on behalf of the poor?
202.622	Are we worth the cost?
205.517	Again, we can look at empirical evidence
207.46	on what happens when we give people stuff
210.25	of our choosing.
212.926	One very telling study looked at a program in India
215.795	that gives livestock to the so-called ultra-poor,
219.102	and they found that 30 percent of recipients
223.023	had turned around and sold the
223.023	livestock they had been given
227.176	for cash.
230.529	The real irony is,
232.087	for every 100 dollars worth of assets
234.668	this program gave someone,
236.82	they spent another 99 dollars to do it.
241.506	What if, instead, we use technology to put cash,
245.152	whether from aid agencies or from any one of us
249.739	directly into a poor person's hands.
253.509	Today, three in four Kenyans use mobile money,
256.379	which is basically a bank account that can run
259.202	on any cell phone.
260.7	A sender can pay a 1.6 percent fee
264.166	and with the click of a button
266.204	send money directly to a recipient's account
269.155	with no intermediaries.
271.885	Like the technologies that are disrupting industries
274.748	in our own lives,
276.547	payments technology in poor countries
279.11	could disrupt aid.
282.217	It's spreading so quickly that it's possible
284.529	to imagine reaching billions
287.061	of the world's poor this way.
289.86	That's what we've started to do at GiveDirectly.
292.481	We're the first organization
294.146	dedicated to providing cash transfers to the poor.
297.319	We've sent cash to 35,000 
297.319	people across rural Kenya
301.987	and Uganda
303.154	in one-time payments of 1,000 dollars
306.332	per family.
308.917	So far, we've looked for the poorest people
311.177	in the poorest villages, and in this part of the world,
314.48	they're the ones living in homes
315.924	made of mud and thatch,
317.102	not cement and iron.
319.562	So let's say that's your family.
321.784	We show up at your door with an Android phone.
324.236	We'll get your name, take your photo
326.563	and a photo of your hut
327.979	and grab the GPS coordinates.
330.454	That night, we send all the data to the cloud,
332.554	and each piece gets checked
334.834	by an independent team
336.712	using, for one example, satellite images.
340.103	Then, we'll come back,
342.099	we'll sell you a basic cell phone
344.49	if you don't have one already,
346.757	and a few weeks later,
349.078	we send money to it.
351.369	Something that five years ago
352.93	would have seemed impossible
354.458	we can now do efficiently
357.343	and free of corruption.
359.481	The more cash we give to the poor,
361.797	and the more evidence we have that it works,
365.453	the more we have to reconsider
367.861	everything else we give.
370.35	Today, the logic behind aid is too often,
373.938	well, we do at least some good.
377.05	When we're complacent
378.466	with that as our bar,
380.836	when we tell ourselves that giving aid
383.428	is better than no aid at all,
386.342	we tend to invest inefficiently,
388.614	in our own ideas that strike us as innovative,
392.596	on writing reports,
394.75	on plane tickets and SUVs.
398.596	What if the logic was,
400.92	will we do better than cash given directly?
406.191	Organizations would have to prove
407.701	that they're doing more good for the poor
409.93	than the poor can do for themselves.
412.686	Of course, giving cash won't create public goods
415.634	like eradicating disease or 
415.634	building strong institutions,
420.952	but it could set a higher bar
423.178	for how we help individual families
426.14	improve their lives.
429.166	I believe in aid.
430.729	I believe most aid is better than just
433.828	throwing money out of a plane.
435.74	I am also absolutely certain
438.288	that a lot of aid today
440.521	isn't better than giving directly to the poor.
444.046	I hope that one day, it will be.
447.922	Thank you.
449.978	(Applause)
