12.88	"""We're declaring war against cancer,"
14.76	"and we will win this war by 2015."""
18.44	This is what the US Congress
18.44	and the National Cancer Institute declared
22.2	just a few years ago, in 2003.
25.56	Now, I don't know about you,
25.56	but I don't buy that.
28.68	I don't think we quite won this war yet,
30.76	and I don't think
30.76	anyone here will question that.
33.8	Now, I will argue that a primary reason
36.32	why we're not winning
36.32	this war against cancer
38.48	is because we're fighting blindly.
40.8	I'm going to start by sharing with you
40.8	a story about a good friend of mine.
44.4	His name is Ehud,
45.64	and a few years ago,
45.64	Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.
48.8	And not just any type of brain cancer:
50.68	he was diagnosed with one
50.68	of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.
53.88	In fact, it was so deadly
55.12	that the doctors told him
55.12	that they only have 12 months,
57.8	and during those 12 months,
57.8	they have to find a treatment.
61.24	They have to find a cure,
62.72	and if they cannot
62.72	find a cure, he will die.
65.8	Now, the good news, they said,
67.28	is that there are tons
67.28	of different treatments to choose from,
70.24	but the bad news is
71.48	that in order for them to tell
71.48	if a treatment is even working or not,
75.04	well, that takes them
75.04	about three months or so.
77.56	So they cannot try that many things.
79.96	Well, Ehud is now going
79.96	into his first treatment,
83.08	and during that first treatment,
83.08	just a few days into that treatment,
86.36	I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,
86.36	"""Adam, I think this is working."
89.72	I think we really lucked out here.
89.72	"Something is happening."""
92.56	"And I ask him, ""Really?"
92.56	"How do you know that, Ehud?"""
95.04	"And he says, ""Well,"
95.04	I feel so terrible inside.
97.28	Something's gotta be working up there.
99.16	"It just has to."""
100.4	Well, unfortunately, three months later,
100.4	we got the news, it didn't work.
105.52	And so Ehud goes
105.52	into his second treatment.
107.6	And again, the same story.
108.88	"""It feels so bad, something's"
108.88	"gotta be working there."""
111.64	And then three months later,
111.64	again we get bad news.
114.6	Ehud is going into his third treatment,
114.6	and then his fourth treatment.
118.56	And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.
121.8	Now, when someone really close to you
121.8	is going through such a huge struggle,
126.4	you get really swamped with emotions.
128.24	A lot of things
128.24	are going through your head.
130.36	For me, it was mostly outrage.
131.84	I was just outraged that, how come
131.84	this is the best that we can offer?
136.56	And I started looking
136.56	more and more into this.
138.88	As it turns out, this is not just
138.88	the best that doctors could offer Ehud.
142.36	It's not just the best doctors could offer
142.36	patients with brain cancer generally.
146.2	We're actually not doing that well
146.2	all across the board with cancer.
150.24	I picked up one of those statistics,
152.12	and I'm sure some of you
152.12	have seen those statistics before.
154.92	This is going to show you here
154.92	how many patients actually died of cancer,
158.4	in this case females in the United States,
160.44	ever since the 1930s.
161.76	You'll notice that there aren't
161.76	that many things that have changed.
164.96	It's still a huge issue.
166.28	You'll see a few changes, though.
168.04	You'll see lung cancer,
168.04	for example, on the rise.
170.6	Thank you, cigarettes.
172.36	And you'll also see that,
172.36	for example, stomach cancer
174.88	once used to be one
174.88	of the biggest killers of all cancers,
178.24	is essentially eliminated.
180.48	Now, why is that?
180.48	Anyone knows, by the way?
182.56	Why is it that humanity is no longer
182.56	struck by stomach cancer?
185.92	What was the huge, huge
185.92	medical technology breakthrough
190.8	that came to our world
190.8	that saved humanity from stomach cancer?
195.24	Was it maybe a new drug,
195.24	or a better diagnostic?
199.08	You guys are right, yeah.
200.4	It's the invention of the refrigerator,
203.04	and the fact that we're
203.04	no longer eating spoiled meats.
205.68	So the best thing
205.68	that happened to us so far
208	in the medical arena in cancer research
209.96	is the fact that
209.96	the refrigerator was invented.
212.175	(Laughter)
213.4	And so -- yeah, I know.
214.68	We're not doing so well here.
216.12	I don't want to miniaturize the progress
218.48	and everything that's been done
218.48	in cancer research.
221.88	Look, there is like 50-plus years
221.88	of good cancer research
225.32	that discovered major, major things
225.32	that taught us about cancer.
228.76	But all that said,
230.52	we have a lot of heavy lifting
230.52	to still do ahead of us.
234.92	Again, I will argue that the primary
234.92	reason why this is the case,
238.04	why we have not done that remarkably well,
240.064	is really we're fighting blindly here.
241.92	And this is where
241.92	medical imaging comes in.
244.16	This is where my own work comes in.
246.4	And so to give you a sense
246.4	of the best medical imaging
249.16	that's offered today
249.16	to brain cancer patients,
251.68	or actually generally
251.68	to all cancer patients,
253.88	take a look at this PET scan right here.
255.84	Let's see. There we go.
257.64	So this is a PET/CT scan,
259.36	and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan
261.84	is the CT scan will show you
261.84	where the bones are,
265.08	and the PET scan will show you
265.08	where tumors are.
267.96	Now, what you can see here
270.2	is essentially a sugar molecule
272.64	that was added a small little tag
274.48	that is signaling to us
274.48	outside of the body,
276.6	"""Hey, I'm here."""
277.92	And those sugar molecules are injected
277.92	into these patients by the billions,
281.76	and they're going all over the body
283.48	looking for cells
283.48	that are hungry for sugar.
286.32	You'll see that the heart,
286.32	for example, lights up there.
289	That's because the heart
289	needs a lot of sugar.
291.24	You'll also see that the bladder
291.24	lights up there.
293.6	That's because the bladder
293.6	is the thing that's clearing
296.24	the sugar away from our body.
298.096	And then you'll see a few other hot spots,
300.12	and these are in fact the tumors.
301.76	Now, this is a really
301.76	a wonderful technology.
303.92	For the first time it allowed us
303.92	to look into someone's body
307.08	without picking up
307.08	each and every one of the cells
309.48	and putting them under the microscope,
311.36	but in a noninvasive way
311.36	allowing us to look into someone's body
314.4	"and ask, ""Hey,"
314.4	has the cancer metastasized?
316.56	"Where is it?"""
317.8	And the PET scans here
317.8	are showing you very clearly
320.32	where are these hot spots,
320.32	where is the tumor.
323.48	So as miraculous as this might seem,
326.8	unfortunately, well, it's not that great.
330.32	You see, those
330.32	small little hot spots there.
333.24	Can anyone guess how many cancer cells
333.24	are in any one of these tumors?
338.6	So it's about 100 million cancer cells,
340.96	and let me make sure
340.96	that this number sunk in.
343.68	In each and every one
343.68	of these small little blips
346.04	that you're seeing on the image,
347.64	there needs to be
347.64	at least 100 million cancer cells
351.76	in order for it to be detected.
353.32	Now, if that seemed to you
353.32	like a very large number,
355.8	it is a very large number.
358.64	This is in fact
358.64	an incredibly large number,
360.72	because what we really need
360.72	in order to pick up something early enough
364.08	to do something about it,
364.08	to do something meaningful about it,
367.04	well, we need to pick up tumors
367.04	that are a thousand cells in size,
370.2	and ideally just
370.2	a handful of cells in size.
372.36	So we're clearly
372.36	pretty far away from this.
374.4	So we're going to play
374.4	a little experiment here.
376.68	I'm going to ask each of you
376.68	to now play and imagine
379.16	that you are brain surgeons.
381	And you guys are now at an operating room,
385.04	and there's a patient in front of you,
387.08	and your task is to make sure
387.08	that the tumor is out.
391.4	So you're looking down at the patient,
394.8	the skin and the skull
394.8	have already been removed,
397.16	so you're looking at the brain.
398.72	And all you know about this patient
400.44	is that there's a tumor
400.44	about the size of a golf ball or so
403.28	in the right frontal lobe
403.28	of this person's brain.
406.08	And that's more or less it.
407.44	So you're looking down, and unfortunately
407.44	everything looks the same,
410.68	because brain cancer tissue
410.68	and healthy brain tissue
413.8	really just look the same.
415.4	And so you're going in with your thumb,
417.32	and you start to press
417.32	a little bit on the brain,
419.68	because tumors tend to be
419.68	a little harder, stiffer,
422.12	and so you go in and go
422.12	a little bit like this and say,
424.76	"""It seems like the tumor is right there."""
426.76	Then you take out your knife
426.76	and start cutting the tumor
429.44	piece by piece by piece.
430.72	And as you're taking the tumor out,
432.44	then you're getting
432.44	to a stage where you think,
434.68	"""Alright, I'm done."
434.68	"I took out everything."""
436.84	And at this stage, if that's --
438.4	so far everything sounded,
438.4	like, pretty crazy --
441.12	you're now about to face the most
441.12	challenging decision of your life here.
444.84	Because now you need to decide,
446.4	should I stop here
446.4	and let this patient go,
449.12	risking that there might be
449.12	some leftover cancer cells behind
452.08	that I just couldn't see,
453.96	or should I take away some extra margins,
456.64	typically about an inch or so
456.64	around the tumor
459.52	just to be sure that I removed everything?
463.4	So this is not a simple decision to make,
467.84	and unfortunately this is the decision
469.8	that brain cancer surgeons
469.8	have to take every single day
473.16	as they're seeing their patients.
475.32	And so I remember talking
475.32	to a few friends of mine in the lab,
478.28	"and we say, ""Boy,"
478.28	"there's got to be a better way."""
480.68	But not just like you tell a friend
480.68	that there's got to be a better way.
484.12	There's just got to be a better way here.
486.097	This is just incredible.
487.64	And so we looked back.
489.32	Remember those PET scans I told you about,
489.32	the sugar and so on.
492.32	We said, hey, how about
492.32	instead of using sugar molecules,
495.08	let's maybe take tiny, tiny
495.08	little particles made of gold,
498.24	and let's program them with some
498.24	interesting chemistry around them.
501.92	Let's program them
501.92	to look for cancer cells.
504.36	And then we will inject
504.36	these gold particles
506.48	into these patients by the billions again,
508.76	and we'll have them go all over the body,
510.76	and just like secret agents, if you will,
512.76	go and walk by
512.76	every single cell in our body
515.6	and knock on the door of that cell,
517.32	"and ask, ""Are you a cancer cell"
517.32	or are you a healthy cell?
520.08	If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.
522.12	If you're a cancer cell,
522.12	we're sticking in and shining out
524.88	and telling us,
524.88	"""Hey, look at me, I'm here."""
527	And they'll do it
527	through some interesting cameras
529.4	that we developed in the lab.
530.84	And once we see that,
530.84	maybe we can guide brain cancer surgeons
533.799	towards taking only the tumor
533.799	and leaving the healthy brain alone.
537.72	And so we've tested that,
537.72	and boy, this works well.
540.8	So I'm going to show you an example now.
542.8	What you're looking at here
544.6	is an image of a mouse's brain,
548.56	and we've implanted
548.56	into this mouse's brain
551.72	a small little tumor.
553	And so this tumor is now
553	growing in this mouse's brain,
555.64	and then we've taken a doctor
555.64	and asked the doctor
558.32	to please operate on the mouse
558.32	as if that was a patient,
561.16	and take out piece by piece
561.16	out of the tumor.
563.6	And while he's doing that,
565.4	we're going to take images
565.4	to see where the gold particles are.
568.4	And so we're going to first start
570.04	by injecting these gold particles
570.04	into this mouse,
572.48	and we're going to see
572.48	right here at the very left there
575.4	that image at the bottom
576.68	is the image that shows
576.68	where the gold particles are.
579.2	The nice thing
579.2	is that these gold particles
581.28	actually made it all the way to the tumor,
583.32	and then they shine out and tell us,
583.32	"""Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."""
587	So now we can see the tumor,
588.4	but we're not showing this
588.4	to the doctor yet.
590.56	We're asking the doctor,
590.56	now please start cutting away the tumor,
593.64	and you'll see here the doctor
593.64	just took the first quadrant of the tumor
597.08	and you see that first quadrant
597.08	is now missing.
599.32	The doctor then took
599.32	the second quadrant, the third,
601.8	and now it appears to be everything.
603.56	And so at this stage,
603.56	the doctor came back to us and said,
606.32	"""Alright, I'm done."
606.32	What do you want me to do?
608.6	Should I keep things as they are
610.2	or do you want me to take
610.2	"some extra margins around?"""
612.72	"And then we said, ""Well, hang on."""
614.4	We told the doctor,
614.4	"""You've missed those two spots,"
616.84	so rather than taking huge margins around,
618.864	only take out those tiny little areas.
620.72	Take them out,
620.72	"and then let's take a look."""
622.76	And so the doctor took them away,
622.76	and lo and behold,
625.64	the cancer is now completely gone.
627.68	Now, the important thing
629.08	is that it's not just
629.08	that the cancer is completely gone
631.724	from this person's brain,
633.08	or from this mouse's brain.
635.16	The most important thing
636.44	is that we did not have to take
636.44	huge amounts of healthy brain
639.36	in the process.
640.6	And so now we can actually imagine a world
642.8	where doctors and surgeons,
642.8	as they take away a tumor,
646.72	they actually know what to take out,
648.17	and they no longer
648.17	have to guess with their thumb.
651.52	Now, here's why it's extremely important
651.52	to take those tiny little leftover tumors.
655.48	Those leftover tumors,
655.48	even if it's just a handful of cells,
658.36	they will grow to recur the tumor,
661.44	for the tumor to come back.
663.12	In fact, the reason why 80 to 90 percent
665.08	of those brain cancer surgeries
665.08	ultimately fail
667.32	is because of those small little
667.32	extra margins that were left positive,
671.12	those small little leftover tumors
671.12	that were left there.
675.44	So this is clearly very nice,
677.64	but what I really want to share with you
677.64	is where I think we're heading from here.
681.96	And so in my lab at Stanford,
683.64	my students and I are asking,
683.64	what should we be working on now?
689.6	And I think where
689.6	medical imaging is heading to
692.48	is the ability to look into the human body
694.84	and actually see each and every one
694.84	of these cells separately.
699	The ability like this would allow us
700.76	to actually pick up tumors
700.76	way, way earlier in the process,
703.68	way before it's 100 million cells inside,
703.68	so we can actually do something about it.
708.2	An ability to see each and every one
708.2	of the cells might also allow us
711.64	to ask insightful questions.
713.04	So in the lab,
713.04	we are now getting to a point
715.16	where we can actually start asking
715.16	these cancer cells real questions,
718.44	like, for example, are you responding
718.44	to the treatment we are giving you or not?
722.24	So if you're not responding, we'll know
722.24	to stop the treatment right away,
725.72	days into the treatment, not three months.
728.48	And so also for patients like Ehud
730.68	that are going through these
730.68	nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,
735.12	for them not to suffer
736.4	through those horrendous
736.4	side effects of the drugs
739.32	when the drugs are
739.32	in fact not even helping them.
742	So to be frank here,
744.96	we're pretty far away
744.96	from winning the war against cancer,
748.44	just to be realistic.
749.72	But at least I am hopeful
751.64	that we should be able to fight this war
751.64	with better medical imaging techniques
755.8	in the way that is not blind.
757.68	Thank you.
758.92	(Applause)
