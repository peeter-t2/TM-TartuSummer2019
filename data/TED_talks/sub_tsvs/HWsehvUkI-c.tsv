15.927	So, well, I do applied math,
18.03	and this is a peculiar problem
19.554	for anyone who does applied math, is that
21.727	we are like management consultants.
23.66	No one knows what the hell we do.
25.606	So I am going to give you some -- attempt today
27.88	to try and explain to you what I do.
30.173	So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.
33.494	We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers
37.176	you will see later on.
38.324	Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
41.014	and a high level of skill,
43.928	and probably a level of initial suitability
46.459	that may well have a genetic component to it.
48.306	Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease
51.699	gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,
53.786	as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was
56.109	a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.
59.076	So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
62.13	However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide
65.074	who have the disease, and they have to live with
68.522	incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity
71.09	and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,
72.947	so what we need are objective tools
75.33	to detect the disease before it's too late.
78.387	We need to be able to measure progression objectively,
80.941	and ultimately, the only way we're going to know
84.114	when we actually have a cure is when we have
86.306	an objective measure that can answer that for sure.
89.704	But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease
92.554	and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,
94.907	so there's no simple blood test that you can do,
97.136	and the best that we have is like
98.938	this 20-minute neurologist test.
101.179	You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,
103.637	and that means that, outside the clinical trials,
106.394	it's just never done. It's never done.
109.122	But what if patients could do this test at home?
112.199	Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,
114.297	and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
118.551	No expensive staff time required.
120.471	Takes about $300, by the way,
121.889	in the neurologist's clinic to do it.
123.882	So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way
126.563	in which we can try to achieve this,
128.077	because, you see, in one sense, at least,
129.885	we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.
133.141	So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.
136.896	Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,
140.125	and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,
143.589	because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs
145.803	when we make sounds, and we all actually
148.098	have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
150.394	And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
153.107	I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
155.692	From the sound, we can actually track
158.074	the vocal fold position as it vibrates,
160.355	and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,
162.898	so too are the vocal organs.
165.679	So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of
167.559	irregular vocal fold tremor.
169.257	We see all the same symptoms.
170.425	We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.
173.355	The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy
175.459	after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
177.692	So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,
180.539	in some cases, but with any digital microphone,
183.755	and using precision voice analysis software
186.3	in combination with the latest in machine learning,
188.709	which is very advanced by now,
190.287	we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies
193.173	on a continuum between health and disease
196.054	using voice signals alone.
198.65	So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against
200.964	expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.
203.114	The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.
207.096	You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
210.1	And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,
212.402	voice-based tests are non-expert.
215.729	That means they can be self-administered.
217.721	They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
220.301	They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.
222.595	When something becomes ultra-low cost,
225.035	it becomes massively scalable.
227.331	So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
231.006	We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.
233.432	No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.
235.744	We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
238.064	We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,
242.169	and we can make population-scale screening
244.284	feasible for the first time.
245.88	We have the opportunity to start to search
248.082	for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.
251.623	So, taking the first steps towards this today,
254.381	we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.
256.507	With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming
258.739	to record a very large number of voices worldwide
260.667	to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.
263.807	We have local numbers accessible to three quarters
265.507	of a billion people on the planet.
267.117	Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,
270.194	and leave recordings, a few cents each,
272.333	and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit
274.523	six percent of our target just in eight hours.
278.066	Thank you. (Applause)
281.817	(Applause)
288.137	Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,
291.712	let's say, 10,000 people,
294.488	you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
297.342	What are you going to get out of those samples?
299.027	Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,
300.857	during the call you have to indicate whether or not
302.514	you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.
303.781	ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
306.288	But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected
309.005	from all different circumstances, and it's getting it
312.413	in different circumstances that matter because then
314.318	we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,
317.702	and looking for the actual markers of the disease.
319.863	TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
322.36	ML: It's much better than that.
323.554	Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,
325.274	because he's done some fantastic work,
327.144	and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,
330.914	which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.
334.304	TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.
335.88	So what that means is that people will be able to â€”
338.081	ML: (Laughs)
339.933	TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones
341.839	and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,
344.911	record their voice, and then their doctor can check up
347.781	on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.
350.462	ML: Absolutely.
351.432	TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.
353.175	ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)
