17.144	"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called"
19.248	to a little town
19.248	in Colorado, called Craig.
22.042	It's only a couple dozen square miles.
23.883	It's in the Rockies.
25.145	And the job in question was sheep rancher.
27.713	My role on the show, for those of you
27.713	who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.
31.52	I'm an apprentice,
32.73	and I work with the people
32.73	who do the jobs in question.
35.478	And my responsibilities
35.478	are to simply try and keep up,
38.478	and give an honest account
38.478	of what it's like to be these people
41.7	for one day in their life.
43.16	The job in question: herding sheep.
45.758	Great.
46.935	We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,
50.27	and I realize the next day
52.41	that castration is going to be
52.41	an absolute part of this work.
56.524	Normally, I never do any research at all.
59.16	But this is a touchy subject,
59.16	and I work for the Discovery Channel,
62.671	and we want to portray accurately
62.671	whatever it is we do.
67.302	And we certainly want to do it
67.302	with a lot of respect for the animals.
72.16	So I call the Humane Society and I say,
74.248	"""Look, I'm going to be castrating"
74.248	"some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"""
77.686	"And they're like, ""Yeah,"
77.686	"it's pretty straightforward."""
80.247	They use a band, basically, a rubber band,
80.247	like this, only a little smaller.
86.312	This one was actually
86.312	around the playing cards
88.533	I got yesterday --
89.74	(Laughter)
91.286	But it had a certain familiarity to it.
93.201	"And I said, ""Well, what exactly"
93.201	"is the process?"""
96.407	"And they said, ""The band"
96.407	is applied to the tail, tightly.
99.276	And then another band is applied
99.276	to the scrotum, tightly.
103.66	Blood flow is slowly retarded;
105.16	a week later the parts
105.16	in question fall off.
107.28	"""Great -- got it."""
108.456	OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.
111.063	They confirm it.
112.254	I also call PETA just for fun,
113.744	and they don't like it,
113.744	but they confirm it.
115.914	OK, that's basically how you do it.
117.625	So the next day I go out.
119.037	And I'm given a horse
119.037	and we go get the lambs
121.406	and we take them to a pen that we built,
123.466	and we go about the business
123.466	of animal husbandry.
127.16	Melanie is the wife of Albert.
128.629	Albert is the shepherd in question.
130.35	Melanie picks up the lamb,
130.35	one hand on both legs on the right,
134.457	likewise on the left.
135.894	Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
138.097	Alright. Great.
139.295	Albert goes in, I follow Albert,
139.295	the crew is around.
141.966	I always watch the process done
141.966	the first time before I try it.
145.465	Being an apprentice,
145.465	you know, you do that.
147.776	Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out,
147.776	you know, this black rubber band,
151.378	but what comes out instead is a knife.
154.572	"And I'm like, ""Hmm, that's not"
154.572	"rubber at all,"" you know?"
157.237	(Laughter)
158.45	And he kind of flicked it open
158.45	in a way that caught the sun
161.268	that was just coming
161.268	over the Rockies, it was very --
163.83	(Laughter)
165.37	It was ... it was impressive.
168.149	In the space of about two seconds,
169.99	Albert had the knife
169.99	between the cartilage of the tail,
173.795	right next to the butt of the lamb,
176.466	and very quickly, the tail was gone
176.466	and in the bucket that I was holding.
180.026	A second later, with a big thumb
180.026	and a well-calloused forefinger,
183.619	he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
186.546	And he pulled it toward him, like so,
188.395	and he took the knife
188.395	and he put it on the tip.
190.633	"""Now, you think you know"
190.633	what's coming, Michael,
193.267	"You don't, OK?"""
194.553	(Laughter)
195.597	He snips it, throws the tip
195.597	over his shoulder,
198.506	and then grabs the scrotum
198.506	and pushes it upward,
200.846	and then his head dips down,
200.846	obscuring my view.
204.769	But what I hear is a slurping sound,
207	and a noise that sounds like Velcro
207	being yanked off a sticky wall,
210.937	and I am not even kidding.
213.884	Can we roll the video?
215.061	No, I'm kidding, we don't --
216.427	(Laughter)
218.447	I thought it best to talk in pictures.
221.426	I do something now I've never, ever done
221.426	"on a ""Dirty Jobs"" shoot, ever."
225.455	"I say, ""Time out. Stop."""
227.777	You guys know the show, we use take one;
227.777	we don't do take two.
230.729	There's no writing, there's no scripting,
230.729	there's no nonsense.
233.671	We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --
235.848	we shoot what we get!
237.27	"I said, ""Stop. This is nuts."""
239.415	I mean --
240.593	(Laughter)
241.902	"""This is crazy."
243.75	"We can't do this."""
245.403	"And Albert's like, ""What?"""
246.675	"And I'm like, ""I don't know"
246.675	what just happened,
248.896	but there are testicles in this bucket,
250.852	"and that's not how we do it."""
252.292	"He said ""Well, that's how we do it."""
254.074	"I said, ""Why would you do it this way?"""
256.041	And before I even let him explain,
257.732	"I said, ""I want to do it the right way,"
257.732	"with the rubber bands."""
260.737	"And he says, ""Like the Humane Society?"""
262.655	"I said, ""Yes, like the Humane Society."
264.517	Let's do something that doesn't make
264.517	the lamb squeal and bleed.
268.126	We're on in five continents, dude!
269.776	We're on twice a day
269.776	"on the Discovery -- we can't do this."""
272.584	"He says, ""OK."""
273.787	He goes to his box and pulls out
273.787	a bag of these little rubber bands.
277.064	Melanie picks up another lamb,
277.064	puts it on the post,
279.596	band goes on the tail,
279.596	band goes on the scrotum.
282.338	Lamb goes on the ground,
282.338	lamb takes two steps, falls down,
286.134	gets up, shakes a little,
288.633	takes another couple steps, falls down.
291.024	I'm like, this is not a good sign
291.024	for this lamb, at all.
295.007	Gets up, walks to the corner.
296.704	It's quivering, and it lies
296.704	down and it's in obvious distress.
300.317	And I'm looking at the lamb
300.317	"and I say, ""Albert, how long?"
304.16	"When does he get up?"""
305.909	"He's like, ""A day?"""
307.747	"I said, ""A day! How long does"
307.747	"it take them to fall off?"""
310.409	"""A week."""
311.608	Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done
311.608	his little procedure on
316.99	is, you know, he's just prancing
316.99	around, bleeding stopped.
321.084	He's, you know, nibbling
321.084	on some grass, frolicking.
324.372	And I was just so blown away
324.372	at how completely wrong I was,
329.386	in that second.
331.025	And I was reminded how utterly wrong
331.025	I am, so much of the time.
335.144	(Laughter)
336.264	And I was especially reminded
338.08	of what a ridiculously
338.08	short straw I had that day,
341.376	because now I had to do
341.376	what Albert had just done,
343.867	and there are like 100
343.867	of these lambs in the pen.
347.263	And suddenly, this whole thing's starting
347.263	to feel like a German porno,
350.737	and I'm like --
352.076	(Laughter)
354.653	Melanie picks up the lamb,
354.653	puts it on the post, opens it up.
358.234	Albert hands me the knife.
359.525	I go in, tail comes off.
361.248	I go in, I grab the scrotum,
361.248	tip comes off.
364.378	"Albert instructs, ""Push it way up there."""
366.748	I do.
367.923	"""Push it further."""
369.098	I do.
370.273	The testicles emerge. They look
370.273	like thumbs, coming right at you.
373.572	"And he says, ""Bite 'em."
375.215	"Just bite 'em off."""
377.219	(Laughter)
378.369	And I heard him, I heard all the words --
380.482	(Laughter)
385.094	Like, how did I get here?
386.737	How did -- I mean --
388.643	how did I get here?
390.643	It's just -- it's one of those moments
390.643	where the brain goes off on its own,
396.012	and suddenly, I'm standing
396.012	there in the Rockies,
399.16	and all I can think of is the Aristotelian
399.16	definition of a tragedy.
403.57	You know, Aristotle says
403.57	a tragedy is that moment
407.695	when the hero comes face to face
407.695	with his true identity.
411.275	(Laughter)
412.644	"And I'm like, ""What is this"
412.644	jacked-up metaphor?
414.95	"I don't like what I'm thinking right now."""
417.022	And I can't get this thought
417.022	out of my head,
419.139	and I can't get that vision
419.139	out of my sight,
421.271	so I did what I had to do.
423.624	I went in and I took them.
425.649	I took them like this,
427.034	and I yanked my head back.
429.852	And I'm standing there
429.852	with two testicles on my chin.
433.673	(Laughter)
435.618	And now I can't get --
435.618	I can't shake the metaphor.
438.794	"I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle,"
438.794	and I'm thinking --
442.46	out of nowhere, two terms come crashing
442.46	into my head, that I hadn't heard
445.959	since my classics professor in college
445.959	drilled them there.
449.099	"And they are ""anagnorisis"""
449.099	"and ""peripeteia."""
451.792	Anagnorisis and peripeteia.
454.143	Anagnorisis is the Greek
454.143	word for discovery.
458.48	Literally, the transition from ignorance
458.48	to knowledge is anagnorisis.
464.53	It's what our network does;
464.53	"it's what ""Dirty Jobs"" is."
467.896	And I'm up to my neck
467.896	in anagnorises every single day.
471.958	Great.
473.137	The other word, peripeteia,
475.299	that's the moment
475.299	in the great tragedies --
480.637	Euripides and Sophocles.
482.899	That's the moment where Oedipus has
482.899	his moment, where he suddenly realizes
488.428	that hot chick he's been sleeping with
488.428	and having babies with
491.347	is his mother.
492.77	That's peripety, or peripeteia.
495.789	And this metaphor in my head --
497.972	I've got anagnorisis
497.972	and peripeteia on my chin --
500.737	(Laughter)
503.026	I've got to tell you,
503.026	it's such a great device, though.
505.654	When you start to look for peripeteia,
508.251	you find it everywhere.
509.812	I mean, Bruce Willis
509.812	"in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right?"
512.749	Spends the whole movie trying to help
512.749	the little kid who sees dead people,
516.329	"and then -- boom! -- ""Oh, I'm dead."""
518.078	Peripeteia. You know?
519.262	It's crushing when the audience
519.262	sees it the right way.
522.756	"Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know?"
525.281	"""Oh, I'm living in a computer program."
527.28	"That's weird."""
528.867	These discoveries
528.867	that lead to sudden realizations.
532.443	And I've been having them,
532.443	over 200 dirty jobs,
535.144	I have them all the time, but that one --
537.3	that one drilled something home
537.3	in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.
542.145	And, as I stood there,
544.236	looking at the happy lamb
544.236	that I had just defiled --
549.867	but it looked OK;
551.68	looking at that poor other little thing
551.68	that I'd done it the right way on,
555.981	and I just was struck by --
557.659	if I'm wrong about that,
561.913	and if I'm wrong so often,
561.913	in a literal way,
564.304	what other peripatetic misconceptions
564.304	might I be able to comment upon?
569.615	Because, look --
569.615	I'm not a social anthropologist,
572.116	but I have a friend who is.
573.456	And I talk to him.
575.16	(Laughter)
576.711	"And he says, ""Hey Mike, look."
578.237	I don't know if your brain is interested
578.237	in this sort of thing or not,
582.245	but do you realize
582.245	you've shot in every state?
584.539	You've worked in mining,
584.539	you've worked in fishing,
587.835	you've worked in steel,
587.835	you've worked in every major industry.
591.527	You've had your back
591.527	shoulder to shoulder with these guys
594.606	that our politicians are desperate
594.606	"to relate to every four years, right?"""
598.236	I can still see Hillary
598.236	doing the shots of rye,
600.876	dribbling down her chin,
600.876	with the steel workers.
603.2	I mean, these are the people
603.2	that I work with every single day.
606.799	"""And if you have something to say"
606.799	about their thoughts, collectively,
610.831	it might be time to think about it.
612.769	"Because, dude, you know, four years."""
616.36	So, that's in my head,
616.36	testicles are on my chin,
620.611	thoughts are bouncing around.
622.52	And, after that shoot,
622.52	"""Dirty Jobs"" really didn't change,"
627.913	in terms of what the show is,
627.913	but it changed for me, personally.
631.391	And now, when I talk about the show,
633.294	I no longer just tell the story
633.294	you heard and 190 like it.
639.666	I do, but I also start to talk
639.666	about some of the other things
642.899	I got wrong;
644.098	some of the other notions of work
646.148	that I've just been assuming
646.148	are sacrosanct,
650.054	and they're not.
651.229	People with dirty jobs
651.229	are happier than you think.
654.16	As a group, they're
654.16	the happiest people I know.
657.195	And I don't want to start whistling
657.195	"""Look for the Union Label,"""
660.201	and all that happy-worker crap.
661.709	I'm just telling you
661.709	that these are balanced people
664.13	who do unthinkable work.
665.309	Roadkill picker-uppers whistle
665.309	while they work, I swear to God --
668.434	I did it with them.
669.612	They've got this amazing
669.612	sort of symmetry to their life.
673.841	And I see it over and over and over again.
676.494	So I started to wonder what would happen
678.608	if we challenged
678.608	some of these sacred cows?
681.675	Follow your passion --
683.387	we've been talking about it
683.387	here for the last 36 hours.
687.035	Follow your passion -- what could
687.035	possibly be wrong with that?
690.001	It's probably the worst advice I ever got.
692.028	(Laughter)
693.126	Follow your dreams and go broke, right?
695.028	I mean, that's all I heard growing up.
696.874	I didn't know what to do with my life,
698.724	but I was told if you follow your passion,
698.724	it's going to work out.
701.889	I can give you 30 examples right now.
703.714	Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas
705.811	who collects the uneaten scraps
705.811	of food from the casinos
708.493	and feeds them to his swine.
710.204	Why?
711.379	Because there's so much protein
711.379	in the stuff we don't eat,
714.177	his pigs grow at twice the normal speed,
714.177	and he's one rich pig farmer.
717.518	He's good for the environment,
718.979	he spends his days
718.979	doing this incredible service,
721.307	and he smells like hell,
721.307	but God bless him.
723.339	He's making a great living.
724.661	"You ask him, ""Did you follow"
724.661	"your passion here?"""
726.954	and he'd laugh at you.
728.133	The guy's worth -- he just got offered
728.133	like 60 million dollars for his farm
732.402	and turned it down, outside of Vegas.
734.632	He didn't follow his passion.
736.077	He stepped back and he watched
736.077	where everybody was going,
739.047	and he went the other way.
741.36	And I hear that story over and over.
743.3	Matt Freund, a dairy farmer
743.3	in New Canaan, Connecticut,
746.896	who woke up one day and realized
748.646	the crap from his cows
748.646	was worth more than their milk,
751.383	if he could use it to make
751.383	these biodegradable flowerpots.
755.289	Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?
758.589	Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.
761.646	So I started to look at passion,
763.877	I started to look
763.877	at efficiency vs. effectiveness.
767.999	As Tim talked about earlier,
767.999	that's a huge distinction.
771.192	I started to look at teamwork
771.192	and determination.
773.695	And basically, all those platitudes
773.695	"they call ""successories"""
776.715	that hang with that schmaltzy art
776.715	in boardrooms around the world right now,
780.666	that stuff -- it's suddenly
780.666	all been turned on its head.
785.578	Safety. Safety first is ...
789.239	Going back to OSHA and PETA
789.239	and the Humane Society:
793.185	What if OSHA got it wrong?
795.485	I mean -- this is heresy,
795.485	what I'm about to say --
797.856	but what if it's really safety third?
800.683	Right?
801.877	(Laughter)
803.327	No, I mean, really.
805.564	What I mean to say is:
807.396	I value my safety on these crazy jobs
809.884	as much as the people
809.884	that I'm working with,
812.47	but the ones who really get it done --
814.77	they're not out there
814.77	talking about safety first.
818.114	They know that other things come first --
820.16	the business of doing
820.16	the work comes first,
822.232	the business of getting it done.
824.079	And I'll never forget,
824.079	up in the Bering Sea,
826.864	I was on a crab boat
826.864	"with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys --"
829.622	which I also work on in the first season.
831.938	We were about 100 miles
831.938	off the coast of Russia:
	coming over the wheelhouse, right?
839.059	Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,
841.16	and I was back with a guy,
841.16	lashing the pots down.
844.082	So I'm 40 feet off the deck,
846.262	which is like looking down
846.262	at the top of your shoe, you know,
849.184	and it's doing this in the ocean.
850.815	Unspeakably dangerous.
851.995	I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse
853.953	and I say, with some level of incredulity,
857.298	"""Captain -- OSHA?"""
859.135	"And he says, ""OSHA? Ocean."""
861.716	And he points out there.
863.16	(Laughter)
866.515	But in that moment, what he said next
866.515	can't be repeated in the Lower 48.
871.49	It can't be repeated on any factory floor
871.49	or any construction site.
875.115	"But he looked at me and said, ""Son,"" --"
877.024	he's my age, by the way,
877.024	"he calls me ""son,"" I love that --"
879.795	"he says, ""Son, I'm the captain"
879.795	of a crab boat.
881.994	My responsibility
881.994	is not to get you home alive.
884.587	My responsibility
884.587	"is to get you home rich."""
886.957	(Laughter)
888.445	You want to get home alive,
888.445	"that's on you."""
890.675	And for the rest
890.675	of that day -- safety first.
893.327	I mean, I was like --
894.994	So, the idea that we create
894.994	this sense of complacency
901.328	when all we do is talk
901.328	about somebody else's responsibility
905.851	as though it's our own, and vice versa.
907.808	Anyhow, a whole lot of things.
909.454	I could talk at length
909.454	about the many little distinctions we made
912.905	and the endless list of ways
912.905	that I got it wrong.
915.785	But what it all comes down to is this:
918.144	I've formed a theory,
919.363	and I'm going to share it now
919.363	in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.
922.802	It goes like this:
925.013	we've declared war on work,
925.013	as a society -- all of us.
930.001	It's a civil war.
931.933	It's a cold war, really.
933.85	We didn't set out to do it
936.16	and we didn't twist our mustache
936.16	in some Machiavellian way,
939.805	but we've done it.
941.051	And we've waged this war
941.051	on at least four fronts,
944.774	certainly in Hollywood.
946.281	The way we portray working people on TV --
948.915	it's laughable.
950.16	If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds
951.958	and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.
954.073	You see him all the time.
955.348	That's what plumbers look like, right?
957.853	We turn them into heroes,
957.853	or we turn them into punch lines.
961.065	That's what TV does.
962.271	"We try hard on ""Dirty Jobs"""
962.271	not to do that,
964.636	which is why I do the work
964.636	and I don't cheat.
968.382	But, we've waged this war
968.382	on Madison Avenue.
971.271	So many of the commercials that come out
971.271	there in the way of a message --
975.684	what's really being said?
977.161	"""Your life would be better"
977.161	if you could work a little less,
979.967	didn't have to work so hard,
979.967	got home a little earlier,
982.824	could retire a little faster,
982.824	"punch out a little sooner."""
985.537	It's all in there,
985.537	over and over, again and again.
988.185	Washington?
989.36	I can't even begin to talk
989.36	about the deals and policies in place
992.415	that affect the bottom-line reality
992.415	of the available jobs,
995.948	because I don't really know; I just know
995.948	that that's a front in this war.
999.535	And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.
1001.654	I mean -- how many people have
1001.654	an iPhone on them right now?
1004.744	How many people have their BlackBerry?
1006.611	We're plugged in; we're connected.
1008.425	I would never suggest for a second
1010.712	that something bad
1010.712	has come out of the tech revolution.
1013.707	Good grief, not to this crowd.
1015.326	(Laughter)
1017.481	But I would suggest
1018.788	that innovation without imitation
1018.788	is a complete waste of time.
1024.132	And nobody celebrates imitation
1026.629	"the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys"
1026.629	know it has to be done.
1030.395	Your iPhone without those people
1030.395	making the same interface,
1033.831	the same circuitry,
1033.831	the same board, over and over --
1036.315	all of that -- that's what makes
1036.315	it equally as possible
1039.847	as the genius that goes inside of it.
1043.057	So, we've got this new toolbox. You know?
1045.914	Our tools today don't look
1045.914	like shovels and picks.
1049.524	They look like the stuff
1049.524	we walk around with.
1052.631	And so the collective
1052.631	effect of all of that
1057.874	has been this marginalization
1057.874	of lots and lots of jobs.
1063.307	And I realized, probably
1063.307	too late in this game --
1066.334	I hope not, because I don't know
1066.334	if I can do 200 more of these things --
1069.812	but we're going to do as many as we can.
1071.751	And to me, the most
1071.751	important thing to know
1073.836	and to really come face to face with,
1075.692	is that fact that I got it wrong
1075.692	about a lot of things,
1078.489	not just the testicles on my chin.
1080.573	I got a lot wrong.
1083.913	So, we're thinking --
1083.913	"by ""we,"" I mean me --"
1087.936	(Laughter)
1089.85	that the thing to do is to talk
1089.85	about a PR campaign for work --
1095.013	manual labor, skilled labor.
1097.314	Somebody needs to be out there,
1097.314	talking about the forgotten benefits.
1102.627	I'm talking about grandfather stuff,
1104.412	the stuff a lot us probably grew up with
1106.383	but we've kind of --
1106.383	you know, kind of lost a little.
1111.529	Barack wants to create
1111.529	two and a half million jobs.
1114.542	The infrastructure is a huge deal.
1116.222	This war on work that I suppose exists,
1116.222	has casualties like any other war.
1120.302	The infrastructure is the first one,
1122.16	declining trade school enrollments
1122.16	are the second one.
1125.147	Every single year, fewer electricians,
1125.147	fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,
1130.012	fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters,
1130.012	fewer steam fitters.
1134.869	The infrastructure jobs that everybody
1134.869	is talking about creating
1138.564	are those guys -- the ones
1138.564	that have been in decline, over and over.
1142.264	Meanwhile, we've got
1142.264	two trillion dollars, at a minimum,
1145.294	according to the American Society
1145.294	of Civil Engineers,
1147.867	that we need to expend
1147.867	to even make a dent in the infrastructure,
1151.026	which is currently rated at a D minus.
1153.296	So, if I were running
1153.296	for anything -- and I'm not --
1157.845	I would simply say
1157.845	that the jobs we hope to make
1160.478	and the jobs we hope to create
1162.556	aren't going to stick unless
1162.556	they're jobs that people want.
1166.091	And I know the point of this conference
1168.71	is to celebrate things
1168.71	that are near and dear to us,
1171.641	but I also know that clean
1171.641	and dirty aren't opposites.
1174.669	They're two sides of the same coin,
1174.669	just like innovation and imitation,
1178.314	like risk and responsibility,
1178.314	like peripeteia and anagnorisis,
1183.423	like that poor little lamb,
1183.423	who I hope isn't quivering anymore,
1187.078	and like my time that's gone.
1188.594	It's been great talking to you.
1190.624	And get back to work, will you?
1192.16	(Applause)
