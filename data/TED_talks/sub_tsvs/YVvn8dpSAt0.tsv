12.16	We're going to go on a dive
12.16	to the deep sea,
15.16	and anyone that's had
15.16	that lovely opportunity
19.16	knows that for about
19.16	two and half hours on the way down,
21.865	it's a perfectly positively
21.865	pitch-black world.
24.584	And we used to see the most mysterious
24.584	animals out the window
27.6	that you couldn't describe:
28.987	these blinking lights -- a world
28.987	of bioluminescence, like fireflies.
32.61	Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the Ocean
32.61	Research and Conservation Association --
36.767	was able to come up with a camera
38.55	that could capture some
38.55	of these incredible animals,
41.06	and that's what you're seeing
41.06	here on the screen.
43.46	That's all bioluminescence.
43.46	Like I said: just like fireflies.
46.377	There's a flying turkey under a tree.
48.656	(Laughter)
49.69	I'm a geologist by training.
52.862	But I love that.
55.16	And you see, some of the bioluminescence
55.16	they use to avoid being eaten,
58.613	some they use to attract prey,
60.16	but all of it,
60.16	from an artistic point of view,
62.935	is just positively amazing.
64.36	And a lot of what goes on inside --
66.16	There's a fish with glowing eyes,
66.16	pulsating eyes.
68.518	Some of the colors
68.518	are designed to hypnotize,
71.16	these lovely patterns.
73.241	And then this last one,
75.16	one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.
78.16	Just absolutely amazing,
78.16	every single dive.
81.16	That's the unknown world,
81.16	and today we've only explored
84.247	about 3 percent
84.247	of what's out there in the ocean.
86.997	Already we've found
86.997	the world's highest mountains,
89.627	the world's deepest valleys,
91.16	underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --
93.261	a lot of that we shared
93.261	with you from the stage.
95.571	And in a place
95.571	where we thought no life at all,
98.26	we find more life, we think,
98.26	and diversity and density
100.86	than the tropical rainforest,
102.367	which tells us that we don't know
102.367	much about this planet at all.
105.416	There's still 97 percent,
106.769	and either that 97 percent is empty
106.769	or just full of surprises.
109.894	But I want to jump up to shallow water now
111.969	and look at some creatures
111.969	that are positively amazing.
114.679	Cephalopods -- head-foots.
117.461	As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.
119.536	(Laughter)
120.637	This is an octopus.
121.86	This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon
121.86	at the Marine Biological Lab,
125.061	and it's just fascinating
125.061	how cephalopods can,
127.26	with their incredible eyes,
127.26	sense their surroundings,
129.838	look at light, look at patterns.
131.638	Here's an octopus moving across the reef,
134.16	finds a spot to settle down, curls up
134.16	and then disappears into the background.
138.425	Tough thing to do.
141.052	In the next bit, we're going
141.052	to see a couple squid.
143.46	Now males, when they fight,
145.157	if they're really aggressive,
145.157	they turn white.
147.358	And these two males are fighting.
148.96	They do it by bouncing
148.96	their butts together,
151.057	which is an interesting concept.
152.701	Now, here's a male on the left
152.701	and a female on the right,
155.46	and the male has managed
155.46	to split his coloration
158.16	so the female only always sees
158.16	the kinder, gentler squid in him.
161.237	(Laughter)
165.16	Let's take a look at it again.
165.16	Watch the coloration:
168.16	white on the right, brown on the left.
171.16	He takes a step back,
173.895	he's keeping off the other
173.895	males by splitting his body,
176.633	and comes up on the other side --
178.36	Bingo!
179.448	Now, I'm told that's not not just
179.448	a squid phenomenon with males,
182.525	but I don't know.
183.799	(Laughter)
185.16	Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.
187.082	This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.
188.97	And there he is,
188.97	his droopy little eyes up here.
193.069	But they can do
193.069	pretty amazing things, too.
195.422	Here we're going to see
195.422	one backing into a crevice,
198.16	and watch his tentacles --
200.16	he just pulls them in,
200.16	makes them look just like algae.
203.16	Disappears right into the background.
206.505	Positively amazing.
207.851	Here's two males fighting.
209.275	Once again, they're smart enough,
209.275	these cephalopods;
211.76	they know not to hurt each other.
213.36	But look at the patterns
213.36	that they can do with their skin.
216.26	That's an amazing thing.
219.679	Here's an octopus.
220.98	Sometimes they don't want
220.98	to be seen when they move,
223.436	because predators can see them.
224.97	This guy can make himself
224.97	look like a rock,
227.07	and, looking at his environment,
229.27	can actually slide across the bottom,
231.289	using the waves and the shadows
231.289	so he can't be seen.
234.29	His motion blends
234.29	right into the background --
238.16	the moving rock trick.
240.958	So, we're learning
240.958	lots new from the shallow water.
243.46	Still exploring the deep,
243.46	but learning lots from the shallow water.
246.661	There's a good reason why:
247.948	the shallow water's full of predators
247.948	-- here's a barracuda --
250.884	and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,
252.96	you need to really understand
252.96	how to use your surroundings to hide.
256.16	In the next scene, you're going to see
256.16	a nice coral bottom.
258.961	And you see that an octopus
258.961	would stand out
261.025	very easily there if you couldn't
261.025	use your camouflage,
263.632	use your skin to change color and texture.
265.757	Here's some algae in the foreground --
268.16	and an octopus.
270.935	Ain't that amazing?
274.007	Now, Roger spooked him,
274.007	so he took off in a cloud of ink,
278.16	and when he lands, the octopus says,
278.16	"""Oh, I've been seen."
281.16	The best thing to do is to get
281.16	"as big as I can get."""
283.661	That big brown makes his eyespot very big.
286.16	So, he's bluffing.
286.16	Let's do it backwards.
288.161	I thought he was joking
288.161	when he first showed it to me.
290.761	I thought it was all graphics.
290.761	So here it is in reverse.
293.446	Watch the skin color;
293.446	watch the skin texture.
295.66	Just an amazing animal,
295.66	it can change color and texture
298.36	to match the surroundings.
299.718	Watch him blend right into this algae.
302.16	One, two, three.
304.16	(Applause)
308.925	And now he's gone, and so am I.
308.925	Thank you very much.
312.925	(Applause)
