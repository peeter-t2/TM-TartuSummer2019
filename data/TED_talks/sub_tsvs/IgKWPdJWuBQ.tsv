15.614	Chris Anderson: Elon, what kind of crazy dream
18.746	would persuade you to think of trying
20.902	to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car?
24.26	Elon Musk: Well, it goes back to when I was in university.
27.662	I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely
29.814	to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity?
32.886	I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport
36.378	and sustainable energy production.
38.737	That sort of overall sustainable energy problem
40.782	is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century,
43.281	independent of environmental concerns.
45.486	In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment,
48.403	given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons,
51.483	we need to find some sustainable means of operating.
55.538	CA: Most of American electricity comes from
59.548	burning fossil fuels.
61.21	How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?
65.825	EM: Right. There's two elements to that answer.
68.784	One is that, even if you take the same source fuel
71.744	and produce power at the power plant
73.733	and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off.
76.627	So if you take, say, natural gas,
78.606	which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel,
81.214	if you burn that in a modern
84.212	General Electric natural gas turbine,
86.407	you'll get about 60 percent efficiency.
88.245	If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car,
90.956	you get about 20 percent efficiency.
92.856	And the reason is, in the stationary power plant,
94.436	you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more,
96.804	is voluminous,
98.519	and you can take the waste heat
99.973	and run a steam turbine and generate
101.342	a secondary power source.
103.126	So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything,
106.912	even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off
110.316	charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.
112.788	CA: That scale delivers efficiency.
114.899	EM: Yes, it does.
116.638	And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means
119.656	of power generation anyway, electricity generation.
122.059	So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation,
125.128	then it makes sense for us to have electric cars
128.593	as the mode of transport.
131.168	CA: So we've got some video here
132.603	of the Tesla being assembled,
135.094	which, if we could play that first video --
137.808	So what is innovative about this process in this vehicle?
142.752	EM: Sure. So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport,
146.328	and I should say that I think, actually,
148.398	all modes of transport will become fully electric
150.856	with the ironic exception of rockets.
155.923	There's just no way around Newton's third law.
158.68	The question is how do you accelerate
162.132	the advent of electric transport?
163.712	And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with
166.16	a really energy efficient car,
168.487	so that means making it incredibly light,
170.344	and so what you're seeing here
171.37	is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car
174.116	made in North America.
175.702	In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques
178.39	to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.
182.007	And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient
184.167	of any car of its size.
185.535	So as a result, the energy usage is very low,
189.2	and it has the most advanced battery pack,
191.416	and that's what gives it the range that's competitive,
194	so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.
196.939	CA: I mean, those battery packs are incredibly heavy,
200.528	but you think the math can still work out intelligently --
203.799	by combining light body, heavy battery,
205.935	you can still gain spectacular efficiency.
208.208	EM: Exactly. The rest of the car has to be very light
210.04	to offset the mass of the pack,
211.801	and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range.
214.83	And in fact, customers of the Model S
218.555	are sort of competing with each other
219.634	to try to get the highest possible range.
222.653	I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge.
226.183	CA: Bruno Bowden, who's here, did that,
229.271	broke the world record.EM: Congratulations.
231.861	CA: That was the good news. The bad news was that
233.473	to do it, he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed
236.287	and got pulled over by the cops. (Laughter)
240.199	EM: I mean, you can certainly drive --
244.089	if you drive it 65 miles an hour,
246.727	under normal conditions,
250.575	CA: Let's show that second video
251.713	showing the Tesla in action on ice.
254.559	Not at all a dig at The New York Times, this, by the way.
257.227	What is the most surprising thing about the experience
259.642	of driving the car?
261.15	EM: In creating an electric car,
262.628	the responsiveness of the car is really incredible.
265.026	So we wanted really to have people feel as though
267.713	they've almost got to mind meld with the car,
269.816	so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one,
272.99	and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens,
277.036	like the car has ESP.
278.87	You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness.
281.366	You can't do that with a gasoline car.
283.493	I think that's really a profound difference,
285.475	and people only experience that when they have a test drive.
288.262	CA: I mean, this is a beautiful but expensive car.
292.556	Is there a road map where this becomes
296.131	a mass-market vehicle?
297.71	EM: Yeah. The goal of Tesla has always been
300.27	to have a sort of three-step process,
302.542	where version one was an expensive car at low volume,
306.308	version two is medium priced and medium volume,
309.373	and then version three would be low price, high volume.
311.662	So we're at step two at this point.
313.345	So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster.
316.295	Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars.
319.294	And our third generation car, which should hopefully
321.398	be out in about three or four years
323.127	will be a $30,000 car.
325.782	But whenever you've got really new technology,
328.264	it generally takes about three major versions
330.358	in order to make it a compelling mass-market product.
333.578	And so I think we're making progress in that direction,
336.302	and I feel confident that we'll get there.
338.574	CA: I mean, right now, if you've got a short commute,
340.483	you can drive, you can get back, you can charge it at home.
344.231	There isn't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast.
348.478	Do you see that coming, really, truly,
351.318	or just on a few key routes?
353.571	EM: There actually are far more charging stations
356.446	than people realize,
358.671	and at Tesla we developed something
361.03	called a Supercharging technology,
363.238	and we're offering that if you buy a Model S
366.55	for free, forever.
368.015	And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize.
370.67	We actually have California and Nevada covered,
373.5	and we've got the Eastern seaboard
375.774	from Boston to D.C. covered.
378.026	By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive
379.408	from L.A. to New York
381.551	just using the Supercharger network,
383.153	which charges at five times the rate of anything else.
387.37	And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop,
391.796	to stop time, of about six or seven.
394.795	So if you drive for three hours,
397.025	you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes,
398.663	because that's normally what people will stop for.
401.16	So if you start a trip at 9 a.m.,
403.28	by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat,
405.818	hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going.
407.557	CA: So your proposition to consumers is, for the full charge, it could take an hour.
410.914	So it's common -- don't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes.
414.89	Wait for an hour, but the good news is,
416.857	you're helping save the planet,
418.296	and by the way, the electricity is free. You don't pay anything.
420.989	EM: Actually, what we're expecting is for people
422.853	to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour.
426.378	It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles
434.106	and then stop for half an hour
436.204	and then keep going.
437.569	That's the natural cadence of a trip.
440.851	CA: All right. So this is only one string to your energy bow.
445.232	You've been working on this solar company SolarCity.
447.874	What's unusual about that?
450.386	EM: Well, as I mentioned earlier,
452.746	we have to have sustainable electricity production
456.386	as well as consumption,
458.034	so I'm quite confident that the primary means
461.856	of power generation will be solar.
464.337	I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is.
466.672	We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun,
469.906	and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy
472.798	for purposes of human civilization.
475.674	What most people know but don't realize they know
477.68	is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already.
481.034	If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball
484.274	at three degrees Kelvin,
486.436	and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation.
490.234	The whole ecosystem is solar-powered.
492.89	CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have,
495.241	effectively, thousands of years of sun power
497.505	compressed into a small space,
499.57	so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar,
502.549	and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas,
505.638	fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?
509.082	EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar
512.391	will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.
516.307	(Applause)CA: How?
518.694	EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.
522.267	CA: But you're not selling solar panels to consumers.
525.301	What are you doing?
526.452	EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system
529.7	or you can lease a solar system.
531.242	Most people choose to lease.
533.232	And the thing about solar power is that
535.298	it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs,
538.049	so once it's installed, it's just there.
541.274	It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.
545.775	So therefore, the key thing to do is to get the cost
548.713	of that initial installation low,
550.688	and then get the cost of the financing low,
553.323	because that interest -- those are the two factors that drive the cost of solar.
556.947	And we've made huge progress in that direction,
560.363	and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas.
563.931	CA: So your current proposition to consumers is,
566.708	don't pay so much up front.
568.924	EM: Zero.CA: Pay zero up front.
571.604	We will install panels on your roof.
574.243	You will then pay, how long is a typical lease?
577.844	EM: Typical leases are 20 years,
581.088	but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward.
585.751	It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases.
589.901	Pretty good deal.
591.781	CA: So that seems like a win for the consumer.
593.694	No risk, you'll pay less than you're paying now.
596.149	For you, the dream here then is that --
598.544	I mean, who owns the electricity from those panels for the longer term?
603.319	I mean, how do you, the company, benefit?
606.501	EM: Well, essentially,
610.043	SolarCity raises a chunk of capital
615.93	from say, a company or a bank.
619.6	Google is one of our big partners here.
621.813	And they have an expected return on that capital.
624.237	With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof
628.623	and then charges the homeowner or business owner
632.069	a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill.
635.779	CA: But you yourself get a long-term commercial benefit from that power.
639.292	You're kind of building a new type of distributed utility.
643.056	EM: Exactly. What it amounts to
644.731	is a giant distributed utility.
648.072	I think it's a good thing, because utilities
650.955	have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice.
653.792	So effectively it's the first time
655.887	there's been competition for this monopoly,
659.152	because the utilities have been the only ones
662.152	that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof.
664.799	So I think it's actually very empowering
666.69	for homeowners and businesses.
669.327	CA: And you really picture a future
670.685	where a majority of power in America,
674.604	within a decade or two, or within your lifetime, it goes solar?
679.306	EM: I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power,
685.104	and most likely a majority,
687.216	and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years.
692.476	I made that bet with someone —CA: Definition of plurality is?
695.944	EM: More from solar than any other source.
697.69	CA: Ah. Who did you make the bet with?
701.448	EM: With a friend who will remain nameless.
704.848	CA: Just between us. (Laughter)
709.168	EM: I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago,
711.96	so in roughly 18 years,
713.763	I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source.
717.32	CA: All right, so let's go back to another bet that you made
719.089	with yourself, I guess, a kind of crazy bet.
721.305	You'd made some money from the sale of PayPal.
726.082	You decided to build a space company.
728.518	Why on Earth would someone do that?
730.591	(Laughter)
732.771	EM: I got that question a lot, that's true.
735.584	"People would say, ""Did you hear the joke about the guy"
737.843	"who made a small fortune in the space industry?"""
740.744	"Obviously, ""He started with a large one,"" is the punchline."
744.992	And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out
747.538	the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one.
749.825	"And they'd look at me, like, ""Is he serious?"""
752.866	CA: And strangely, you were. So what happened?
757.928	EM: It was a close call. Things almost didn't work out.
761.11	We came very close to failure,
762.86	but we managed to get through that point in 2008.
765.994	The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology,
772.144	and in particular to try to crack a problem
774.098	that I think is vital
775.682	for humanity to become a space-faring civilization,
777.709	which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.
782.593	CA: Would humanity become a space-faring civilization?
785.684	So that was a dream of yours, in a way, from a young age?
789.698	You've dreamed of Mars and beyond?
793.077	EM: I did build rockets when I was a kid,
795.213	but I didn't think I'd be involved in this.
796.609	It was really more from the standpoint of
798.594	what are the things that need to happen in order for
802.464	the future to be an exciting and inspiring one?
805.284	And I really think there's a fundamental difference,
809.373	if you sort of look into the future,
810.769	between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization,
814.226	that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets,
817.341	and I think that's really exciting,
819.553	compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth
822.724	until some eventual extinction event.
825.012	CA: So you've somehow slashed the cost of building
826.764	a rocket by 75 percent, depending on how you calculate it.
830.108	How on Earth have you done that?
832.387	NASA has been doing this for years. How have you done this?
835.498	EM: Well, we've made significant advances
837.899	in the technology of the airframe, the engines,
840.662	the electronics and the launch operation.
843.883	There's a long list of innovations
846.604	that we've come up with there
848.772	that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk, but --
854.447	CA: Not least because you could still get copied, right?
857.86	You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.
860.475	EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's
862.715	more dangerous to patent than not to patent.
865.463	EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments,
868.159	the enforceability of patents is questionable.(Laughter) (Applause)
872.628	CA: That's really, really interesting.
876.047	But the big innovation is still ahead,
878.676	and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.
881.415	EM: Right, so the big innovation—
883.104	CA: In fact, let's roll that video and you can talk us through it, what's happening here.
887.341	EM: Absolutely. So the thing about rockets is that
891.415	they're all expendable.
892.957	All rockets that fly today are fully expendable.
895.219	The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket,
897.353	but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time,
900.279	and the parts that were reusable
902.375	took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight.
907.431	So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight.
911.017	Obviously that doesn't work very well for —
913.199	CA: What just happened there? We just saw something land?
916.419	EM: That's right. So it's important that the rocket stages
920.75	be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site
924.115	and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours.
927.132	CA: Wow. Reusable rockets.EM: Yes. (Applause)
931.815	And so what a lot of people don't realize is,
935.023	the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small.
937.621	It's much like on a jet.
939.325	So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent
942.841	of the cost of the rocket.
944.743	So it's possible to achieve, let's say,
946.895	roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight
949.735	if you can effectively reuse the rocket.
952.815	That's why it's so important.
954.255	Every mode of transport that we use,
956.477	whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses,
959.407	is reusable, but not rockets.
961.743	So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization.
965.031	CA: You asked me the question earlier
966.498	of how popular traveling on cruises would be
970.293	if you had to burn your ships afterward.EM: Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic.
976.428	CA: Definitely more expensive.
978.623	So that's potentially absolutely disruptive technology,
982.594	and, I guess, paves the way for your dream to actually take,
986.767	at some point, to take humanity to Mars at scale.
990.564	You'd like to see a colony on Mars.
992.861	EM: Yeah, exactly. SpaceX, or some combination
996.398	of companies and governments, needs to make progress
999.431	in the direction of making life multi-planetary,
1002.39	of establishing a base on another planet,
1006.022	on Mars -- being the only realistic option --
1008.367	and then building that base up
1009.749	until we're a true multi-planet species.
1012.698	"CA: So progress on this ""let's make it reusable,"""
1015.671	how is that going? That was just a simulation video we saw.
1019.49	How's it going?
1020.595	EM: We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently
1023.759	with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project,
1026.343	where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight,
1030.519	the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky.
1033.268	And we've had some good tests.
1036.304	CA: Can we see that?EM: Yeah.
1038.365	So that's just to give a sense of scale.
1040.008	We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash
1041.448	and bolted the mannequin to the rocket. (Laughter)
1045.303	CA: All right, let's see that video then,
1047.255	because this is actually amazing when you think about it.
1049.286	You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then --
1054.993	EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size
1056.911	of a 12-story building.
1059.537	(Rocket launch)
1070.358	So now it's hovering at about 40 meters,
1074.331	and it's constantly adjusting
1076.207	the angle, the pitch 
1076.207	and yaw of the main engine,
1079.168	and maintaining roll 
1079.168	with cold gas thrusters.
1089.306	CA: How cool is that? (Applause)
1095.619	Elon, how have you done this?
1100.293	These projects are so -- Paypal, SolarCity,
1105.607	Tesla, SpaceX, they're so spectacularly different,
1108.285	they're such ambitious projects at scale.
1110.87	How on Earth has one person
1113.334	been able to innovate in this way?
1115.809	What is it about you?
1117.646	EM: I don't know, actually.
1123.042	I don't have a good answer for you.
1125.282	I work a lot. I mean, a lot.
1128.917	CA: Well, I have a theory.EM: Okay. All right.
1131.23	CA: My theory is that you
1134.794	have an ability to think at a system level of design
1138.95	that pulls together design, technology and business,
1142.593	so if TED was TBD, design, technology and business,
1146.069	into one package,
1148.566	synthesize it in a way that very few people can and --
1150.925	and this is the critical thing -- feel so damn confident
1155.019	in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks.
1159.635	You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.
1164.514	I mean, almost no one can do that.
1166.611	Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?
1169.883	Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?
1173.307	It is truly amazing what you've done.
1175.046	EM: Well, thanks. Thank you.
1177.055	Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking.
1181.865	It is physics. You know, the sort of first principles reasoning.
1184.489	Generally I think there are -- what I mean by that is,
1189.243	boil things down to their fundamental truths
1192.618	and reason up from there,
1194.009	as opposed to reasoning by analogy.
1196.595	Through most of our life, we get through life
1198.809	by reasoning by analogy,
1199.897	which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations.
1203.435	And you have to do that.
1204.915	Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day.
1209.489	But when you want to do something new,
1211.633	you have to apply the physics approach.
1215.365	Physics is really figuring out how to discover
1217.613	new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics.
1220.258	It's really counterintuitive.
1222.161	So I think that's an important thing to do,
1224.682	and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback,
1229.24	and solicit it, particularly from friends.
1231.361	This may sound like simple advice,
1234.827	but hardly anyone does that,
1237.249	and it's incredibly helpful.
1239.601	CA: Boys and girls watching, study physics.
1242.963	Learn from this man.
1244.247	Elon Musk, I wish we had all day, but thank you so much for coming to TED.
1247.737	EM: Thank you. CA: That was awesome. That was really, really cool.
1251.147	Look at that. (Applause)
1253.408	Just take a bow. That was fantastic.
1258.235	Thank you so much.
