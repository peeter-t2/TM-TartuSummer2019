18.33	Four years ago, on the TED stage,
21.33	I announced a company I was working with at the time
23.728	called Odeo.
25.637	And because of that announcement,
27.314	we got a big article in The New York Times,
29.376	which led to more press, which led to more attention,
32.653	and me deciding to become CEO of that company --
35.33	whereas I was just an adviser --
37.33	and raising a round of venture capital
39.683	and ramping up hiring.
41.33	One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,
45.176	and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,
49.114	Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years
53.776	that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.
57.33	We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,
59.576	so we kind of put two and two together,
61.422	and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo.
66.375	Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project
68.853	at a startup, where focus is so critical,
71.206	but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project
73.545	to my previous company,
74.868	thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,
77.33	and it ended up taking over not only the company,
79.93	but my life for the next five or six years.
82.33	So I learned to follow hunches
84.667	even though you can't necessarily justify them
86.53	or know where they're going to go.
87.959	And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time.
91.33	So, for those of you unfamiliar,
93.33	Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.
96.791	You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,
100.006	and people who are interested in you get those updates.
103.33	If they're really interested,
104.776	they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.
107.914	So, for instance, I may Twitter right now
110.33	that I'm giving a talk at TED.
112.405	And in my case, when I hit send,
115.114	up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.
119.38	Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter
122.752	lets people share moments of their lives
125.191	whenever they want,
126.406	be they momentous occasions
128.714	or mundane ones.
132.252	It is by sharing these moments as they're happening
135.082	that lets people feel more connected and in touch,
138.856	despite distance, and in real time.
141.036	This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,
144.008	and what got us excited.
146.367	What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses
149.852	that would evolve from this very simple system.
152.933	One of the things we realized
154.93	was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
158.212	When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,
161.509	in October of 2007,
163.42	people turned to Twitter to report what was happening
165.625	and to find information from neighbors
167.659	about what was happening around them.
169.431	But it wasn't just individuals.
170.736	The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,
174.319	and put a Twitter feed on the front page,
176.336	and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross
178.424	used it to dispense news and updates as well.
181.52	At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering
184.583	and thousands of people around the world are following along
187.246	because they want to know what it feels like to be here
189.228	and what's happening.
190.804	Among the other interesting things that have cropped up
193.884	are many things from businesses,
195.933	from marketing and communications and predictable things,
198.575	to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck
201.812	that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,
204.068	causing a line to form around the block.
209.084	Politicians have recently begun Twittering.
212.13	In fact, there are 47 members of Congress
214.22	who currently have Twitter accounts.
215.971	And they're tweeting, in some cases,
218.401	from behind closed-door sessions with the President.
220.875	In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
223.473	The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,
226.996	although his tweets have dropped off as of late,
230.883	while Senator McCain's have picked up.
235.674	As have this guy's.
238.858	Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:
242.723	you send one message and it goes out to everybody,
244.755	and you receive the messages you're interested in.
246.811	One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter
251.131	was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person
254.812	or a specific message.
257.118	"So, this syntax, the ""@username"" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here"
260.287	to reply to one of his fans,
261.991	was completely invented by users,
263.831	and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular
266.864	and then we made it easier.
268.831	This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
271.662	Another is via the API.
273.431	We built an application-programming interface,
275.335	which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
279.652	We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software
282.335	that can send Twitter updates --
283.687	interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --
288.175	as well as things like
290.567	a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks
292.967	or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
296.07	Probably the most important third-party development
298.695	came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
301.455	Summize built a Twitter search engine.
303.726	And they tapped into the fact
305.536	that, if you have millions of people around the world
307.743	talking about what they're doing and what's around them,
310.151	you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event
314.978	while it's going on.
316.623	This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
318.963	For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
323.143	This is another way that our mind was shifted,
326.432	and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
328.792	We liked this so much we actually bought the company
331.209	and are folding it into the main product.
333.64	This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,
337.024	but it introduces new use cases as well.
339.464	One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago
342.176	when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
344.723	Some users figured out
346.463	that they would Twitter when they found gas --
349.476	where it was, and how much it cost --
351.752	"and then appended the keyword ""#atlgas"""
354.266	which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
357.944	And this trend of people using this communication network
360.273	to help each other out
361.649	goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.
365.492	It's happened more and more lately,
368.659	whether it's raising money for homeless people
371.145	or to dig wells in Africa
372.881	or for a family in crisis.
375.145	People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter
377.969	in a matter of days on several occasions.
382.421	It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,
387.498	more good things happen.
390.066	I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.
394.298	I've learned to follow the hunch,
396.362	but never assume where it will go.
399.506	Thanks.
401.69	(Applause)
407.575	Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
409.346	So, look, if we could have this screen live.
411.684	This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do
414.052	after they've been to an event.
415.714	It's totally intimidating.
418.69	So, this would be the Twitter search screen.
421.81	So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.
425.545	"For example: ""Evan Williams."""
430.945	"""Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED."""
435.253	"""Currently listening to Evan Williams."" ""Currently listening to Evan Williams."" ""Evan Williams --"""
438.33	Oh.
439.144	"""Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED."
441.052	"Worst talk ever!"" (Laughter)"
444.19	Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
445.744	CA: Just kidding.
448.114	But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,
450.868	there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.
453.221	So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:
455.822	the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,
458.082	the fact that it came out of TED.
459.467	I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way.
462.421	You have build something very fascinating,
464.698	and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.
467.021	So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.
468.729	CA: That was very interesting.
