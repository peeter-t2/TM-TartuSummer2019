15.838	Well, I was introduced as
18.756	the former Governor of Michigan,
20.788	but actually I'm a scientist.
23.804	All right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,
26.796	but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy
30.592	that is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,
33.748	I was experimenting with policy
36.59	about what would achieve the greatest good
39.284	for the greatest number.
41.393	But there were three problems, three enigmas
45.671	that I could not solve,
48.205	and I want to share with you those problems,
51.683	but most importantly,
53.689	I think I figured out a proposal for a solution.
57.445	The first problem
59.314	that not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,
61.305	how do you create good jobs in America
64.624	in a global economy?
66.372	So let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.
69.864	I was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,
74.374	I got a call from one of my staff members, who said,
76.906	"""Gov, we have a big problem."
79.274	We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,
82.894	population 8,000,
85.156	and they are about to lose their major employer,
87.951	"which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."""
92.77	"And I said, ""Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"""
95.449	"And he said, ""3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."""
100.379	So it is a one-company town.
103.16	And Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.
108.088	"So I said, ""Forget that. I'm the new Governor."
110.976	We can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville
113.264	with my whole cabinet and we will just
115.232	"make Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."""
118.137	So I brought my whole cabinet,
120.568	and we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville --
124.28	the mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college --
127.51	and we basically emptied our pockets
131.105	and put all of our chips on the table,
134.398	incentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,
138.526	and as we made our pile of chips,
140.177	we slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.
145.284	And in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,
149.392	or that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,
153.608	we'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,
156.401	said they would offer unprecedented concessions,
160.24	sacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.
164.293	So the management of Electrolux took our pile,
167.171	our list of incentives, and they went outside the room
169.984	for 17 minutes,
172.504	and they came back in and they said,
174.735	"""Wow, this is the most generous"
177.676	any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.
182.165	But there's nothing you can do
185.56	to compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour
189.849	"in Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."""
193.107	And they did. And when they did, it was like
196.112	a nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.
199.368	In fact, they did implode the factory.
201.683	That's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.
205.661	And on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,
209.685	the employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,
212.325	had a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.
217.99	It was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,
220.973	and I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor
225.462	that I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,
229.359	and I wanted to grieve with them,
231.882	and as I went into the room-- there's thousands of people there.
235.202	It was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches
238.945	on roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,
243.105	or a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)
246.842	And this guy comes up to me,
250.069	and he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,
253.809	and he had his two daughters with him,
256.427	"and he said, ""Gov, these are my two daughters."""
260.034	"He said, ""I'm 48 years old,"
263.082	and I have worked at this factory for 30 years.
267.64	I went from high school to factory.
270.296	"My father worked at this factory,"" he said."
272.904	"""My grandfather worked at this factory."
275.753	"All I know is how to make refrigerators."""
280.776	And he looked at his daughters,
282.129	and he puts his hand on his chest,
284.617	"and he says, ""So, Gov, tell me,"
287.167	who is ever going to hire me?
292.495	"Who is ever going to hire me?"""
295.928	And that was asked not just by that guy
299.45	but by everyone in the pavilion,
302.128	and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories
307.968	that closed in the first decade of this century.
312.28	Enigma number one: How do you create jobs
315.174	in America in a global economy?
317.607	Number two, very quickly:
319.907	How do you solve global climate change
322.639	when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country
326.976	and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
331.904	In fact, there was a poll that was done recently
335.066	and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings
339.343	to a number of other unpleasant things,
341.773	and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating
345.293	is worse than cockroaches,
348.175	lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)
355.167	But wait, the good news is it's at least better
359.446	than meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)
364.302	We got a problem, folks.
368.127	So it got me thinking, what is it?
369.765	What in the laboratory that I see out there,
373.527	the laboratories of democracy, what has happened?
375.677	What policy prescriptions have happened
378.376	that actually cause changes to occur
380.168	and that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?
383.735	So if I asked you, for example,
385.013	what was the Obama Administration policy
387.493	that caused massive changes across the country,
390.607	what would you say?
391.895	You might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.
395.69	As we know, only half the states have opted in.
398.231	We might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.
401.74	The thing that caused massive policy changes to occur
406.091	was Race to the Top for education.
408.511	Why? The government put a $4.5 billion pot
411.753	and said to the governors across the country, compete for it.
415.199	Forty-eight governors competed,
418.375	convincing 48 state legislatures to essentially
421.674	raise standards for high schoolers
423.96	so that they all take a college prep curriculum.
426.271	Forty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.
431.657	So I thought, well, why can't we do something like that
434.26	and create a clean energy jobs race to the top?
438.306	Because after all, if you look at the context,
440.657	1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years
444.635	from the private sector globally,
446.577	and every dollar represents a job,
448.949	and where are those jobs going?
450.544	Well, they're going to places that have policy, like China.
452.968	In fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,
454.99	and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,
457.698	and I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations
460.701	and standing next to one of the Chinese officials,
463.064	and we were watching, and he says,
464.726	"""So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"""
469.36	"And I said, ""Oh my God -- Congress, gridlock, who knows?"""
472.928	And this is what he did, he goes, he says,
476.942	"""Take your time."""
479.679	Because they see our passivity as their opportunity.
484.317	So what if we decided to create
487.25	a challenge to the governors of the country,
489.949	and the price to entry into this competition
492.755	used the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress
496.403	for the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,
499.093	which sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than
501.476	one tenth of one percent of federal spending.
503.965	It's a rounding error on the federal side.
505.989	But price to entry into that competition would be,
509.907	you could just, say, use the President's goal.
513.212	He wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard
516.285	of 80 percent by 2030,
518.56	in other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent
520.539	of your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.
524.189	Why not ask all of the states to do that instead?
526.89	And imagine what might happen,
528.881	because every region has something to offer.
530.869	You might take states like Iowa and Ohio --
533.851	two very important political states, by the way --
535.868	those two governors, and they would say,
537.756	we're going to lead the nation in producing
540.471	the wind turbines and the wind energy.
543.073	You might say the solar states, the sun belt,
546.244	we're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,
549.944	"and maybe Jerry Brown says, ""Well, I'm going to create"
552.114	an industry cluster in California
554.291	to be able to produce the solar panels
556.13	so that we're not buying them from China
557.779	"but we're buying them from the U.S."""
559.642	In fact, every region of the country could do this.
563.072	You see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.
567.178	In fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states
571.182	in the West, they could do geothermal,
573.357	or you could look at Texas and say,
575.669	we could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.
579.037	In the middle eastern states which have access to forests
583.144	and to agricultural waste, they might say,
585.468	we're going to lead the nation in biofuels.
588.069	In the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation
590.585	in energy efficiency solutions.
593.449	Along the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation
596.418	in offshore wind.
598.237	You might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation
600.82	in producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.
604.714	Every region has something to offer,
608.121	and if you created a competition,
610.443	it respects the states and it respects federalism.
614.561	It's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,
618.115	who didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,
620.785	you might even get them to opt in. Why?
623.186	Because Republican and Democratic governors
625.737	love to cut ribbons.
627.391	We want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.
631.705	And it fosters innovation at the state level
634.325	in these laboratories of democracy.
636.786	Now, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately
641.092	"might say, ""Okay, great idea, but really?"
643.849	Congress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?
646.481	"They can't agree to anything."""
648.754	So you could wait and go through Congress,
652.049	although you should be very impatient.
654.625	Or, you renegades, we could go around Congress.
662.529	Go around Congress.
664.087	What if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?
670.715	What if several of the high-net worth companies
675.675	and individuals who are here at TED decided
680.065	that they would create, band together, just a couple of them,
683.593	and create a national competition to the governors
687.153	to have a race to the top
689.409	and see how the governors respond?
692.078	What if it all started here at TED?
696.966	What if you were here
699.625	when we figured out how to crack the code
704.973	to create good paying jobs in America -- (Applause) --
710.419	and get national energy policy
714.14	and we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?
720.118	Because, dear TEDsters,
723.569	if you are impatient like I am,
726.331	you know that our economic competitors,
729.889	our other nations, are in the game
733.329	and are eating us for lunch.
735.681	And we can get in the game or not.
740.227	We can be at the table or we can be on the table.
744.546	And I don't know about you,
746.967	but I prefer to dine.
749.674	Thank you all so much. (Applause)
