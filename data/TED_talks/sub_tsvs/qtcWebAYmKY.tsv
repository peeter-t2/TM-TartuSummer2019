16.685	I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother
22.251	who died in her exile:
24.651	"""Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him."
29.516	But don't you ever turn
32.723	"into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary."""
38.846	Almost two years have passed
41	since the Libyan Revolution broke out,
43.816	inspired by the waves of mass mobilization
48.566	in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions.
53.366	I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya
58.466	to call for a day of rage
60.666	and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi.
67.15	And there it was, a great revolution.
71.183	Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront
74.883	calling for the fall of the regime,
78.067	raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice.
83.283	They have shown an exemplary bravery
86.323	in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi.
90.39	They have shown a great sense of solidarity
93.905	from the far east to the far west to the south.
97.389	Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war
103.305	and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead,
108.773	we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant.
114.156	(Applause)
120.405	However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden,
124.839	a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions.
132.174	For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime
136.475	destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society.
144.924	Aware of the devastation and the challenges,
148.624	I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society,
155.407	calling for an inclusive and just transition
158.899	to democracy and national reconciliation.
161.966	Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi
165.783	during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi --
168.682	almost 300 in Tripoli.
171.583	After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya,
177.533	and with unique enthusiasm,
179.75	I started organizing workshops
182.232	on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills.
187.064	With an amazing group of women,
189.599	I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace,
193.381	a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life,
198.249	to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women
202.85	and to lobby for our right
205	for equal participation in building democracy and peace.
210.117	I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections,
215.833	an environment which was increasingly polarized,
219.817	an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion.
229.285	I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace
233.367	to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law,
237.501	a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background,
241.966	the right to vote and run,
245.05	and most importantly to stipulate on political parties
249.201	the alternation of male and female candidates
253.916	vertically and horizontally in their lists,
257.3	creating the zipper list.
260.133	Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful.
266.478	Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress
272.25	in the first elections ever in 52 years.
276.515	(Applause)
283.266	However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections,
289.734	and of the revolution as a whole,
293.466	was fading out --
295.05	for every day we were waking up to the news of violence.
299.516	One day we wake up to the news
301.75	of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs.
305.222	On another day we wake up to the news
307.017	of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate.
311.518	On another day we wake up to the news
313.6	of the assassination of army officers.
317.117	And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias
322.684	and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners
327.534	and their disrespect of the rule of law.
331.466	Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset,
335.002	became more polarized
336.963	and has driven away from the ideals and the principles --
340.641	freedom, dignity, social justice --
343.707	that we first held.
345.407	Intolerance, exclusion and revenge
349.517	became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution.
354.549	I am here today not at all to inspire you
359.199	with our success story of the zipper list and the elections.
363.383	I'm rather here today to confess
365.584	that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision.
372.366	We did not prioritize right.
375.189	For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya.
382.583	Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates
387.883	bring peace and national reconciliation?
390.916	No, it didn't.
393.333	What is it, then?
395.283	Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated
401.466	with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
408.767	Maybe what was missing was not the women only,
413.286	but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
420.49	Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building
424.863	more than it needed the elections,
426.663	which only reinforced polarization and division.
430.648	Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine
436.913	more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
442.93	We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage.
449.627	We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
455.227	We need to develop a feminine discourse
458.861	that not only honors but also implements
462.994	mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition,
471.358	inclusion instead of exclusion.
474.577	These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya
477.684	needs desperately in order to achieve peace.
481.159	For peace has an alchemy,
483.343	and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation
490.426	between the feminine and masculine perspectives.
493.926	That's the real zipper.
495.977	And we need to establish that existentially
499.026	before we do so sociopolitically.
501.477	According to a Quranic verse
504.376	"""Salam"" -- peace -- ""is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."""
510.877	"In turn, the word ""raheem,"" which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,"
516.612	"has the same root in Arabic as the word ""rahem"" -- womb --"
521.313	symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity
527.147	from which the male and the female,
529.263	from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
534.796	And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,
543.807	the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
551.573	"Thus we are told that ""My mercy encompasses all things."""
556.94	"Thus we are told that ""My mercy takes precedence over my anger."""
562.94	May we all be granted a grace of mercy.
567.523	(Applause)
571.343	Thank you.
573.447	(Applause)
