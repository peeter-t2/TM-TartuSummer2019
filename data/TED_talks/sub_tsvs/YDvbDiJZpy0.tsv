12.76	How many of you have used
12.76	an electronic spreadsheet,
15.76	like Microsoft Excel?
18.24	Very good.
19.52	Now, how many of you have run a business
19.52	with a spreadsheet by hand,
24.12	like my dad did for his small
24.12	printing business in Philadelphia?
28.16	A lot less.
29.92	Well, that's the way it was done
29.92	for hundreds of years.
33.48	In early 1978,
33.48	I started working on an idea
36.52	that eventually became VisiCalc.
39.48	And the next year it shipped
41.16	running on something new
41.16	called an Apple II personal computer.
45.24	You could tell that things
45.24	had really changed when, six years later,
49.32	the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial
51.52	that assumed you knew what VisiCalc was
51.52	and maybe even were using it.
55.76	Steve Jobs back in 1990
59.16	"said that ""spreadsheets"
59.16	"propelled the industry forward."""
62.88	"""VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple"
62.88	"more than any other single event."""
67.44	On a more personal note,
69.6	"Steve said, ""If VisiCalc had been written"
69.6	for some other computer,
72.76	you'd be interviewing
72.76	"somebody else right now."""
75.36	So, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting
75.36	personal computers on business desks.
81.76	How did it come about?
83.68	What was it? What did I go through
83.68	to make it be what it was?
87.92	Well, I first learned to program
87.92	back in 1966, when I was 15 --
93.28	just a couple months
93.28	after this photo was taken.
96.2	Few high schoolers had access
96.2	to computers in those days.
99.56	But through luck
99.56	and an awful lot of perseverance,
103.08	I was able to get
103.08	computer time around the city.
106.2	After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock,
106.2	I went off to MIT to go to college,
111.52	where to make money,
111.52	I worked on the Multics Project.
115.32	Multics was a trailblazing
115.32	interactive time-sharing system.
120.36	Have you heard of the Linux
120.36	and Unix operating systems?
123.56	They came from Multics.
125.32	I worked on the Multics versions
127.64	of what are known
127.64	as interpreted computer languages,
131.48	that are used by people
131.48	in noncomputer fields
133.96	to do their calculations
133.96	while seated at a computer terminal.
137.56	After I graduated from MIT,
139.84	I went to work for
139.84	Digital Equipment Corporation.
143.32	At DEC, I worked on software
146.52	for the new area
146.52	of computerized typesetting.
149.8	I helped newspapers
149.8	replace their reporters' typewriters
154.16	with computer terminals.
155.88	I'd write software
157.12	and then I'd go out in the field
157.12	to places like the Kansas City Star,
160.84	where I would train users
160.84	and get feedback.
163.28	This was real-world experience
165.16	that is quite different
165.16	than what I saw in the lab at MIT.
169.88	After that, I was project leader
172.52	of the software for DEC's first
172.52	word processor, again a new field.
177.72	Like with typesetting, the important thing
177.72	was crafting a user interface
183.24	that was both natural and efficient
183.24	for noncomputer people to use.
188.36	After I was at DEC, I went
188.36	to work for a small company
192.36	that made microprocessor-based electronic
192.36	cash registers for the fast-food industry.
199.36	But I had always wanted to start
199.36	a company with my friend Bob Frankston
203.08	that I met on the Multics project at MIT.
205.48	So I decided to go back to school to learn
205.48	as much as I could about business.
209.2	And in the fall of 1977,
212	I entered the MBA program
212	at Harvard Business School.
215.84	I was one of the few
215.84	percentage of students
218.36	who had a background
218.36	in computer programming.
222.08	There's a picture of me from the yearbook
222.08	sitting in the front row.
225.28	(Laughter)
226.32	Now, at Harvard,
226.32	we learned by the case method.
228.96	We'd do about three cases a day.
230.92	Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages
230.92	describing particular business situations.
237.6	They often have exhibits,
237.6	and exhibits often have words and numbers
242.2	laid out in ways that make sense
242.2	for the particular situation.
245.84	They're usually all somewhat different.
247.8	Here's my homework.
249.04	Again, numbers, words,
249.04	laid out in ways that made sense.
252.24	Lots of calculations --
252.24	we got really close to our calculators.
256.72	In fact, here's my calculator.
260.2	For Halloween, I went
260.2	dressed up as a calculator.
263	(Laughter)
265.785	At the beginning of each class,
265.785	the professor would call on somebody
269	to present the case.
271.079	What they would do is
271.079	they would explain what was going on
273.88	and then dictate information
273.88	that the professor would transcribe
277.64	onto the many motorized blackboards
277.64	in the front of the class,
280.569	and then we'd have a discussion.
282.12	One of the really frustrating things
282.12	is when you've done all your homework,
286.6	you come in the next day
286.6	only to find out that you made an error
289.64	and all of the other numbers
289.64	you did were wrong.
292.2	And you couldn't participate as well.
294	And we were marked by class participation.
297.32	So, sitting there with 87 other people
297.32	in the class, I got to daydream a lot.
303.28	Most programmers in those days
303.28	worked on mainframes,
307.16	building things like inventory systems,
307.16	payroll systems and bill-paying systems.
313.52	But I had worked
313.52	on interactive word processing
316.04	and on-demand personal computation.
318.16	Instead of thinking
318.16	about paper printouts and punch cards,
322.88	I imagined a magic blackboard
325.68	that if you erased one number
325.68	and wrote a new thing in,
329.08	all of the other numbers
329.08	would automatically change,
331.96	like word processing with numbers.
334.6	I imagined that my calculator
334.6	had mouse hardware on the bottom of it
339.24	and a head-up display,
339.24	like in a fighter plane.
342.72	And I could type some numbers in,
342.72	and circle it, and press the sum button.
346.88	And right in the middle of a negotiation
346.88	I'd be able to get the answer.
350.64	Now I just had to take my fantasy
350.64	and turn it into reality.
354.64	My father taught me about prototyping.
357.56	He showed me mock-ups
359.2	that he'd make to figure out
359.2	the placement on the page
362.56	for the things for brochures
362.56	that he was printing.
365.12	And he'd use it
365.12	to get feedback from customers
368.08	and OKs before he sent the job
368.08	off to the presses.
372.44	The act of making a simple, working
372.44	version of what you're trying to build
377.56	forces you to uncover key problems.
380.72	And it lets you find solutions
380.72	to those problems much less expensively.
385.72	So I decided to build a prototype.
388.76	I went to a video terminal connected to
388.76	Harvard's time-sharing system
393.36	and got to work.
394.88	One of the first problems
394.88	that I ran into was:
398.16	How do you represent values in formulas?
401.28	Let me show you what I mean.
404	I thought that you would point somewhere,
406.2	type in some words,
406.2	then type in some somewhere else,
409.32	put in some numbers and some more numbers,
409.32	point where you want the answer.
413.24	And then point to the first, press minus,
413.24	point to the second,
416.48	and get the result.
418.36	The problem was:
418.36	What should I put in the formula?
421.8	It had to be something
421.8	the computer knew what to put in.
424.444	And if you looked at the formula,
426.16	you needed to know
426.16	where on the screen it referred to.
429.84	The first thing I thought was
429.84	the programmer way of doing it.
432.76	The first time you pointed to somewhere,
434.689	the computer would ask you
434.689	to type in a unique name.
438.76	It became pretty clear pretty fast that
438.76	that was going to be too tedious.
442.56	The computer had to automatically
442.56	make up the name and put it inside.
446.6	So I thought, why not make it be
446.6	the order in which you create them?
451.48	I tried that. Value 1, value 2.
454	Pretty quickly I saw
454	that if you had more than a few values
456.786	you'd never remember
456.786	on the screen where things were.
459.32	Then I said, why not instead of
459.32	allowing you to put values anywhere,
464.64	I'll restrict you to a grid?
466.72	Then when you pointed to a cell,
468.96	the computer could put
468.96	the row and column in as a name.
472.64	And, if I did it like a map and put ABC
472.64	across the top and numbers along the side,
478.84	if you saw B7 in a formula,
481.76	you'd know exactly
481.76	where it was on the screen.
484.64	And if you had to type the formula
484.64	in yourself, you'd know what to do.
489.44	Restricting you to a grid
489.44	helped solve my problem.
493.2	It also opened up new capabilities,
493.2	like the ability to have ranges of cells.
499.36	But it wasn't too restrictive --
500.96	you could still put any value,
500.96	any formula, in any cell.
506.12	And that's the way we do it to this day,
506.12	almost 40 years later.
511.109	My friend Bob and I decided that we were
511.109	going to build this product together.
514.8	I did more work figuring out exactly
514.8	how the program was supposed to behave.
519.24	I wrote a reference card
519.24	to act as documentation.
522.52	It also helped me ensure
522.52	that the user interface I was defining
527.32	could be explained concisely
527.32	and clearly to regular people.
531.52	Bob worked in the attic of the apartment
531.52	he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.
536.96	This is the inside of the attic.
540.24	Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System
543.04	to write computer code
543.04	on a terminal like this.
546.4	And then he would download test versions
546.4	to a borrowed Apple II
549.92	over a phone line
549.92	using an acoustic coupler,
553.2	and then we would test.
554.92	For one of these tests I prepared
554.92	for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.
560.72	Print wasn't working yet,
560.72	so I had to copy everything down.
564.48	Save wasn't working,
564.48	so every time it crashed,
566.92	I had to type in all of the formulas
566.92	again, over and over again.
570.24	The next day in class, I raised my hand;
570.24	I got called on, and I presented the case.
574.24	I did five-year projections.
574.24	I did all sorts of different scenarios.
577.84	I aced the case.
577.84	VisiCalc was already useful.
582.16	"The professor said, ""How did you do it?"""
585.469	Well, I didn't want to tell him
585.469	about our secret program.
588.16	(Laughter)
590.2	"So I said, ""I took this and added this"
592.08	and multiplied by this
592.08	"and subtracted that."""
594.2	"He said, ""Well,"
594.2	"why didn't you use a ratio?"""
596.32	"I said, ""Hah! A ratio --"
596.32	"that wouldn't have been as exact!"""
599.36	What I didn't say was,
599.36	"""Divide isn't working yet."""
601.96	(Laughter)
605.08	Eventually, though,
605.08	we did finish enough of VisiCalc
608.96	to be able to show it to the public.
611.44	My dad printed up a sample reference card
613.44	that we could use as marketing material.
616.28	In June of 1979, our publisher
616.28	announced VisiCalc to the world,
622.08	in a small booth at the giant National
622.08	Computer Conference in New York City.
626.8	The New York Times had
626.8	a humorous article about the conference.
631.48	"""The machines perform"
631.48	what seem religious rites ...
633.96	Even as the believers gather,
635.365	the painters in the Coliseum sign room
635.365	are adding to the pantheon,
638.485	carefully lettering 'VISICALC'
638.485	in giant black on yellow.
641.68	"All hail VISICALC!"""
643.52	(Gasp) New York Times:
643.52	"""All hail VISICALC."""
647.12	(Laughter)
648.64	That was the last mention
648.64	of the electronic spreadsheet
652.92	in the popular business press
652.92	for about two years.
656.84	Most people didn't get it yet.
659	But some did.
660.92	In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.
665.88	It came in packaging
665.88	that looked like this.
668.72	And it looked like this
668.72	running on the Apple II.
672	And the rest, as they say, is history.
674.36	Now, there's an awful lot
674.36	more to this story,
676.48	but that'll have to wait for another day.
678.56	One thing, though, Harvard remembers.
681.4	Here's that classroom.
683.24	They put up a plaque
683.24	to commemorate what happened there.
687.64	(Applause)
696.4	But it also serves as a reminder
699.36	that you, too, should take
699.36	your unique backgrounds, skills and needs
704.88	and build prototypes to discover
704.88	and work out the key problems,
710.16	and through that, change the world.
713.04	Thank you.
714.28	(Applause)
