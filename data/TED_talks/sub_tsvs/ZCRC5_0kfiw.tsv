12.458	I think it's safe to say
14.276	that all humans will be intimate with death
18.26	at least once in their lives.
21.1	But what if that intimacy began
23.117	long before you faced your own transition
25.406	from life into death?
28.2	What would life be like
30.129	if the dead literally lived alongside you?
33.725	In my husband's homeland
35.651	in the highlands of Sulawesi island
38.331	in eastern Indonesia,
40.358	there is a community of people that experience death
42.827	not as a singular event
45.448	but as a gradual social process.
49.2	In Tana Toraja,
50.997	the most important social moments in people's lives,
54.035	the focal points of social and cultural interaction
57.381	are not weddings or births or even family dinners,
62.096	but funerals.
64.59	So these funerals are characterized
66.919	by elaborate rituals
68.83	that tie people in a system of reciprocal debt
72.345	based on the amount of animals --
74.482	pigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo --
79.476	that are sacrificed and distributed
82.159	in the name of the deceased.
84.926	So this cultural complex surrounding death,
88.663	the ritual enactment of the end of life,
92.291	has made death the most visible
94.871	and remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.
99.7	Lasting anywhere from a few days
102.128	to a few weeks,
103.968	funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair,
107.11	where commemorating someone who's died
110.152	is not so much a private sadness
112.743	but more of a publicly shared transition.
117.811	And it's a transition that's just as much
120.212	about the identity of the living
122.414	as it is about remembrance of the dead.
126.227	So every year, thousands of visitors
128.721	come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,
131.285	this culture of death,
133.349	and for many people these grandiose ceremonies
136.935	and the length of the ceremonies
139.693	are somehow incommensurable
142.437	with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
147.36	So even as we share death as a universal experience,
153.274	it's not experienced the same way the world over.
157.416	And as an anthropologist,
159.684	I see these differences in experience
162.146	being rooted in the cultural and social world
166.895	through which we define the phenomena around us.
172.071	So where we see an unquestionable reality,
176.956	death as an irrefutable biological condition,
181.879	Torajans see the expired corporeal form
185.184	as part of a larger social genesis.
188.996	So again, the physical cessation of life
193.792	is not the same as death.
196.741	In fact, a member of society is only truly dead
200.324	when the extended family can agree upon
203.758	and marshal the resources necessary
206.102	to hold a funeral ceremony
207.888	that is considered appropriate in terms of resources
211.54	for the status of the deceased.
214.235	And this ceremony has to take place
216.507	in front of the eyes of the whole community
218.669	with everyone's participation.
221.276	So after a person's physical death,
224.146	their body is placed in a special room
226.885	in the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.
229.941	And the tongkonan is symbolic
232.089	not only of the family's identity
236.191	but also of the human life cycle from birth to death.
239.888	So essentially, the shape of the building
241.787	that you're born into is the shape
243.831	of the structure which carries you
245.725	to your ancestral resting place.
249.421	Until the funeral ceremony,
251.701	which can be held years after a person's physical death,
256.648	"the deceased is referred to as ""to makala,"" a sick person,"
262.363	"or ""to mama,"" a person who is asleep,"
266.706	and they continue to be a member of the household.
270.489	They are symbolically fed and cared for,
273.848	and the family at this time
275.73	will begin a number of ritual injunctions,
278.643	which communicates to the wider community around them
281.605	that one of their members is undergoing the transition
284.427	from this life into the afterlife
287.462	known as Puya.
289.722	So I know what some of you must be thinking right now.
292.444	Is she really saying that these people live
295.22	with the bodies of their dead relatives?
298.288	And that's exactly what I'm saying.
301.36	But instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction
304.84	we have to this idea of proximity to bodies,
308.378	proximity to death,
310.512	or how this notion just does not fit
313.032	into our very biological or medical
316.284	sort of definition of death,
319.088	I like to think about what the Torajan way
322.175	of viewing death encompasses of the human experience
326.931	that the medical definition leaves out.
331.964	I think that Torajans socially recognize
335.705	and culturally express
338.835	what many of us feel to be true
341.297	despite the widespread acceptance
343.721	of the biomedical definition of death,
348.468	and that is that our relationships with other humans,
352.363	their impact on our social reality,
355.869	doesn't cease with the termination
358.345	of the physical processes of the body,
362.326	that there's a period of transition
364.969	as the relationship between the living and the dead
369.19	is transformed but not ended.
374.043	So Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship
378.881	by lavishing love and attention
380.723	on the most visible symbol of that relationship,
383.993	the human body.
385.77	So my husband has fond memories
388.594	of talking to and playing with
391.14	and generally being around his deceased grandfather,
394.601	and for him there is nothing unnatural about this.
397.876	This is a natural part of the process
400.805	as the family comes to terms with the transition
404.274	in their relationship to the deceased,
406.966	and this is the transition from relating to the deceased
409.455	as a person who's living
411.725	to relating to the deceased
413.627	as a person who's an ancestor.
415.453	And here you can see these wooden effigies
417.638	of the ancestors,
418.841	so these are people who have already been buried,
420.432	already had a funeral ceremony.
421.898	These are called tau tau.
424.808	So the funeral ceremony itself
427.328	embodies this relational perspective on death.
431.224	It ritualizes the impact of death on families
435.607	and communities.
437.83	And it's also a moment of self-awareness.
440.998	It's a moment when people think about who they are,
444.127	their place in society,
447.632	and their role in the life cycle
449.935	in accordance with Torajan cosmology.
454.128	There's a saying in Toraja
455.782	that all people will become grandparents,
458.916	and what this means is that after death,
461.297	we all become part of the ancestral line
464.146	that anchors us between the past and the present
467.954	and will define who our loved ones are into the future.
472.943	So essentially, we all become grandparents
475.732	to the generations of human children
478.146	that come after us.
481.16	And this metaphor of membership
483.389	in the greater human family
485.519	is the way that children also describe
487.364	the money that they invest
488.942	in these sacrificial buffaloes
490.913	that are thought to carry people's soul
492.955	from here to the afterlife,
495.125	and children will explain
496.711	that they will invest the money in this
499.29	because they want to repay their parents
501.717	the debt for all of the years their parents spent
504.962	investing and caring for them.
507.476	But the sacrifice of buffalo
510.186	and the ritual display of wealth
512.873	also exhibits the status of the deceased,
515.928	and, by extension, the deceased's family.
519.22	So at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed
523.348	but also transformed
525.661	in a ritual drama that highlights
528.301	the most salient feature about death in this place:
532.079	its impact on life and the relationships of the living.
537.345	So all of this focus on death
540.16	doesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire
542.796	to the ideal of a long life.
545.472	They engage in many practices
547.541	thought to confer good health
549.669	and survival to an advanced age.
552.533	But they don't put much stock
554.7	in efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness
559.699	or in old age.
562.354	It's said in Toraja that everybody has
564.217	sort of a predetermined amount of life.
566.954	It's called the sunga'.
568.932	And like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool
572	to its natural end.
574.94	So by having death as a part
577.488	of the cultural and social fabric of life,
581.657	people's everyday decisions about their health
584.63	and healthcare are affected.
587.931	The patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,
591.058	Nenet Katcha,
593.13	is now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.
598.783	And there are increasing signs
600.885	that he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.
605.528	And his death will be greatly mourned.
610.459	But I know that my husband's family
612.675	looks forward to the moment
614.893	when they can ritually display
618.55	what his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,
623.283	when they can ritually recount
625.021	his life's narrative,
627.036	weaving his story
628.8	into the history of their community.
632.822	His story is their story.
636.654	His funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.
642.426	And it's a story that has no discernible beginning,
646.211	no foreseeable end.
648.832	It's a story that goes on
650.768	long after his body no longer does.
655.42	People ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed
659.94	by participating in a culture
662.66	where the physical manifestations of death
665.331	greet us at every turn.
667.11	But I see something profoundly transformative
670.34	in experiencing death as a social process
673.755	and not just a biological one.
677.011	In reality, the relationship between the living and the dead
681.075	has its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,
684.365	where decisions about how long to stretch
686.908	the thread of life are made based on our emotional
690.181	and social ties with the people around us,
692.806	not just on medicine's ability to prolong life.
697.925	We, like the Torajans,
700.65	base our decisions about life
703.445	on the meanings and the definitions
707.093	that we ascribe to death.
709.357	So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience
712.9	should run out and adopt the traditions
715.132	of the Torajans.
716.754	It might be a little bit difficult
718.346	to put into play in the United States.
721.68	But I want to ask what we can gain
723.561	from seeing physical death not only as a biological process
728	but as part of the greater human story.
732.492	What would it be like to look on
735.023	the expired human form with love
738.472	because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?
742.196	If we could expand our definition of death
745.083	to encompass life,
747.494	we could experience death as part of life
751.408	and perhaps face death
753.67	with something other than fear.
758.133	Perhaps one of the answers to the challenges
761.076	that are facing the U.S. healthcare system,
763.929	particularly in the end-of-life care,
766.355	is as simple as a shift in perspective,
769.385	and the shift in perspective in this case
771.402	would be to look at the social life of every death.
777.03	It might help us recognize that the way we limit
780.515	our conversation about death
782.191	to something that's medical or biological
785.226	is reflective of a larger culture that we all share
789.049	of avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.
794.699	If we could entertain and value
799.139	other kinds of knowledge about life,
802.262	including other definitions of death,
805.936	it has the potential to change the discussions
808.138	that we have about the end of life.
811.885	It could change the way that we die,
815.978	but more importantly,
817.99	it could transform the way that we live.
825.101	(Applause)
