13.461	So if I told you that
13.461	this was the face of pure joy,
19.177	would you call me crazy?
22.678	I wouldn't blame you,
23.918	because every time I look at this
23.918	Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.
28.92	I want to tell you
28.92	a little bit about this photograph.
31.919	I was swimming around
31.919	in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,
35.485	just inside the Arctic Circle,
37.19	and the water was hovering
37.19	right at freezing.
40.348	The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,
44.179	and I could literally feel the blood
44.179	trying to leave my hands,
47.615	feet and face, and rush
47.615	to protect my vital organs.
52.375	It was the coldest I've ever been.
55.069	But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes,
55.069	and cheeks flushed red,
59.921	I have found that this place right here
59.921	is somewhere I can find great joy.
66.562	Now, when it comes to pain,
66.562	psychologist Brock Bastian
69.627	probably said it best when he wrote,
71.972	"""Pain is a kind of shortcut"
71.972	to mindfulness.
74.549	It makes us suddenly aware
74.549	of everything in the environment.
78.218	It brutally draws us in
80.192	to a virtual sensory awareness
80.192	"of the world much like meditation."""
85.047	If shivering is a form of meditation,
85.047	then I would consider myself a monk.
88.537	(Laughter)
89.387	Now, before we get into the why
92.266	would anyone ever want to surf
92.266	in freezing cold water?
95.981	I would love to give you
95.981	a little perspective
98.558	on what a day in my life can look like.
101.832	(Music)
148.017	(Video) Man: I mean, I know
148.017	we were hoping for good waves,
151.544	but I don't think anybody thought
151.544	that was going to happen.
154.424	I can't stop shaking.
156.095	I am so cold.
160.344	(Music)
163.432	(Applause)
168.135	Chris Burkard: So,
168.135	surf photographer, right?
171.804	I don't even know
171.804	if it's a real job title, to be honest.
174.708	My parents definitely didn't think so
176.844	when I told them at 19 I was quitting
176.844	my job to pursue this dream career:
181.718	blue skies, warm tropical beaches,
181.718	and a tan that lasts all year long.
186.294	I mean, to me, this was it.
186.294	Life could not get any better.
190.125	Sweating it out, shooting surfers
190.125	in these exotic tourist destinations.
194.769	But there was just this one problem.
196.51	You see, the more time I spent traveling
196.51	to these exotic locations,
200.109	the less gratifying it seemed to be.
203.104	I set out seeking adventure,
203.104	and what I was finding was only routine.
207.679	It was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining,
207.679	and a constant cellular connection
212.439	that to me were all the trappings
212.439	of places heavily touristed
215.411	in and out of the water,
217.709	and it didn't take long
217.709	for me to start feeling suffocated.
223.106	I began craving wild, open spaces,
227.223	and so I set out to find the places
227.223	others had written off
230.665	as too cold, too remote,
230.665	and too dangerous to surf,
234.543	and that challenge intrigued me.
237.353	I began this sort of personal crusade
237.353	against the mundane,
241.485	because if there's
241.485	one thing I've realized,
244.109	it's that any career,
245.961	even one as seemingly glamorous
245.961	as surf photography,
249.722	has the danger of becoming monotonous.
252.648	So in my search to break up
252.648	this monotony, I realized something:
255.702	There's only about a third
255.702	of the Earth's oceans that are warm,
258.656	and it's really just that thin band
258.656	around the equator.
261.587	So if I was going to find perfect waves,
264.095	it was probably going
264.095	to happen somewhere cold,
266.672	where the seas are notoriously rough,
268.553	and that's exactly where I began to look.
271.246	And it was my first trip to Iceland
273.777	that I felt like I found
273.777	exactly what I was looking for.
276.846	I was blown away
276.846	by the natural beauty of the landscape,
280.023	but most importantly, I couldn't believe
280.023	we were finding perfect waves
284.219	in such a remote and rugged
284.219	part of the world.
287.639	At one point, we got to the beach
289.915	only to find massive chunks of ice
289.915	had piled on the shoreline.
293.018	They created this barrier
293.018	between us and the surf,
295.371	and we had to weave 
295.371	through this thing like a maze
297.761	just to get out into the lineup.
299.348	and once we got there,
300.473	we were pushing aside these ice chunks
300.473	trying to get into waves.
303.511	It was an incredible experience,
303.511	one I'll never forget,
307.468	because amidst those harsh conditions,
310.254	I felt like I stumbled onto
310.254	one of the last quiet places,
314.976	somewhere that I found a clarity
314.976	and a connection with the world
317.991	I knew I would never find
317.991	on a crowded beach.
322.073	I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)
325.231	Cold water was constantly on my mind,
328.087	and from that point on,
329.399	my career focused on these types of harsh
329.399	and unforgiving environments,
332.729	and it took me to places like Russia,
332.729	Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,
336.605	the Faroe Islands,
336.605	and a lot of places in between.
339.534	And one of my favorite things
339.534	about these places
342.552	was simply the challenge and
342.552	the creativity it took just to get there:
346.453	hours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth
348.659	trying to pinpoint any remote stretch
348.659	of beach or reef we could actually get to.
353.418	And once we got there,
353.418	the vehicles were just as creative:
356.848	snowmobiles, six-wheel
356.848	Soviet troop carriers,
359.757	and a couple of super-sketchy
359.757	helicopter flights.
363.054	(Laughter)
365.26	Helicopters really scare me, by the way.
368.51	There was this one particularly
368.51	bumpy boat ride
371.042	up the coast of Vancouver Island
371.042	to this kind of remote surf spot,
374.158	where we ended up watching
374.158	helplessly from the water
376.777	as bears ravaged our camp site.
379.168	They walked off with our food
379.168	and bits of our tent,
382.188	clearly letting us know that we
382.188	were at the bottom of the food chain
385.4	and that this was their spot, not ours.
387.527	But to me, that trip
389.454	was a testament to the wildness
389.454	I traded for those touristy beaches.
396.066	Now, it wasn't until I traveled
396.066	to Norway -- (Laughter) --
400.123	that I really learned
400.123	to appreciate the cold.
404.294	So this is the place
406.206	where some of the largest,
406.206	the most violent storms in the world
409.573	send huge waves smashing
409.573	into the coastline.
412.627	We were in this tiny, remote fjord,
412.627	just inside the Arctic Circle.
416.605	It had a greater population
416.605	of sheep than people,
419.151	so help if we needed it
419.151	was nowhere to be found.
422.936	I was in the water 
422.936	taking pictures of surfers,
425.151	and it started to snow.
428.241	And then the temperature began to drop.
432.458	And I told myself, there's not a chance
432.458	you're getting out of the water.
435.843	You traveled all this way, and this is
435.843	exactly what you've been waiting for:
439.437	freezing cold conditions
439.437	with perfect waves.
441.519	And although I couldn't even feel
441.519	my finger to push the trigger,
444.537	I knew I wasn't getting out.
446.049	So I just did whatever I could.
446.049	I shook it off, whatever.
448.842	But that was the point that I felt
450.525	this wind gush through
450.525	the valley and hit me,
452.644	and what started as this light snowfall
452.644	quickly became a full-on blizzard,
458.058	and I started to lose
458.058	perception of where I was.
462.932	I didn't know if I was drifting
462.932	out to sea or towards shore,
466.095	and all I could really make out
466.095	was the faint sound of seagulls
470.047	and crashing waves.
472.81	Now, I knew this place had a reputation
472.81	for sinking ships and grounding planes,
477.646	and while I was out there floating,
477.646	I started to get a little bit nervous.
482.609	Actually, I was totally freaking out --
484.977	(Laughter) -- and I was
484.977	borderline hypothermic,
488.414	and my friends eventually
488.414	had to help me out of the water.
491.595	And I don't know if it was
491.595	delirium setting in or what,
494.752	but they told me later
496.912	I had a smile on my face the entire time.
502.415	Now, it was this trip
504.528	and probably that exact experience
504.528	where I really began to feel
508.312	like every photograph was precious,
512.272	because all of a sudden in that moment,
512.272	it was something I was forced to earn.
517.352	And I realized, all this shivering
517.352	had actually taught me something:
522.257	In life, there are no shortcuts to joy.
527.12	Anything that is worth pursuing
527.12	is going to require us to suffer
530.893	just a little bit,
532.855	and that tiny bit of suffering
532.855	that I did for my photography,
536.547	it added a value to my work
536.547	that was so much more meaningful to me
539.844	than just trying to fill
539.844	the pages of magazines.
543.9	See, I gave a piece of myself
543.9	in these places,
550.208	and what I walked away with
552.755	was a sense of fulfillment
552.755	I had always been searching for.
558.326	So I look back at this photograph.
561.298	It's easy to see frozen fingers
561.298	and cold wetsuits
566.018	and even the struggle
566.018	that it took just to get there,
569.082	but most of all,
569.082	what I see is just joy.
573.935	Thank you so much.
575.996	(Applause)
