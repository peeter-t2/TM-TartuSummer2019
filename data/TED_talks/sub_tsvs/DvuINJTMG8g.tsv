12.96	(Music)
88.2	I went down
90.8	to St. James Infirmary
96.8	To see my baby there
102.2	She was lying on a long wooden table
109.76	So cold, so still, so fair
117.32	I went up to see the doctor
125.04	"""She's very low,"" he said"
130.64	I went back to see my baby
138.32	Good God
140.32	she's lying there dead
187.64	I went down to old Joe's bar room
194.04	On the corner of the square
200.72	They were serving drinks as per usual
206.04	And the usual crowd was there
211.8	To my left stood Old Joe McKennedy
217.44	His eyes were bloodshot red
222.24	He turned to the crowd around him
227.72	And these are the words he said
233.6	"""Let her go, let her go, God bless her"
239.48	Wherever she may be
243.68	She can search
243.68	this whole wide world all over
248.92	But she'll never find another man like me
254.56	She can search
254.56	this whole wide world all over
259.44	And she'll never find
264.16	another man
272	like me
286.28	When I die, please God, bury me
291.68	In my ten-dollar Stetson hat
297.52	Put a twenty-dollar gold piece
297.52	on my watch chain
302.72	So my friends know I died standing pat
308.88	Get six gamblers to carry my coffin
314.4	And six choir girls to sing me a song
320.36	Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
325.72	To raise hell as I go along
453.08	Now that's the end of my story
462.6	Let's have another round of booze
469.16	And if anyone should ask you
476.16	Just tell them I got
481.12	the St. James Infirmary
495.96	blues
510.04	(Applause)
