25	If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce
32	goes best with diseases of the small intestine.
35	(Laughter)
37	So, sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.
41	No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854
46	in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story --
50	in brief -- of this outbreak,
53	which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,
57	and particularly the kind of city that we live in today.
59	This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,
63	in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.
67	But I think the most important one is that
70	London was this city of 2.5 million people,
73	and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.
78	But it was also the largest city that had ever been built.
80	And so the Victorians were trying to live through
83	and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:
87	"this scale of living that we, you know, now call ""metropolitan living."""
92	And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.
98	They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis
102	with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.
105	So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,
110	had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.
116	And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there
119	and hope that it would somehow go away,
121	and of course it never really would go away.
124	And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point
127	where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.
131	It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,
135	but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.
138	Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,
142	that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic
145	until literally their milk ran out and they died,
147	and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.
153	So, you would just walk around London at this point
156	and just be overwhelmed with this stench.
159	And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system
164	became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,
168	that was creating these diseases
170	that would wipe through the city every three or four years.
173	And cholera was really the great killer of this period.
175	It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years
180	another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London
184	and throughout the U.K.
186	And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.
190	We had to get rid of the smell.
192	And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,
195	founding public-health interventions in the system of the city,
199	"one of which was called the ""Nuisances Act,"""
201	which they got everybody as far as they could
203	to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
208	Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,
212	and -- oh right, we drink from the river.
216	So what ended up happening, actually,
218	is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera
220	because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.
224	It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.
227	It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.
230	And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century
234	effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively
238	than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.
241	So this was the state of London in 1854,
245	and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,
251	and in the midst of all this scientific confusion
254	about what was actually killing people,
257	it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,
263	who was a local doctor in Soho in London,
266	who had been arguing for about four or five years
268	that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,
271	and had basically convinced nobody of this.
274	The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.
278	And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,
282	but nothing had really stuck.
284	And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me
286	is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,
291	how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.
296	And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
300	And then on one day, August 28th of 1854,
305	a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,
309	we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,
313	came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.
316	You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map
319	that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.
324	It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,
326	this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,
330	that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,
333	bordered on an extremely popular water pump,
337	local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,
341	that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.
345	And so this little girl inadvertently ended up
348	contaminating the water in this popular pump,
350	and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England
356	erupted about two or three days later.
358	Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,
362	and much more would have died if people hadn't fled
364	after the initial outbreak kicked in.
367	So it was this incredibly terrifying event.
369	You had these scenes of entire families dying
372	over the course of 48 hours of cholera,
374	alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.
379	Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.
382	Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,
386	and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast
389	because he thought an outbreak that concentrated
392	could actually potentially end up convincing people that,
396	in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.
402	He suspected an outbreak that concentrated
404	would probably involve a single point source.
408	One single thing that everybody was going to
410	because it didn't have the traditional slower path
413	of infections that you might expect.
416	And so he went right in there and started interviewing people.
419	He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,
423	who's kind of the other protagonist of the book --
425	this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,
428	who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;
431	he knew everybody in the neighborhood.
433	And he managed to track down, Whitehead did,
435	many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,
438	or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
440	And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
445	He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
448	People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
451	And he thought about representing that
453	as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,
456	people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,
458	but eventually he hit upon the idea
460	that what he needed was something that you could see.
462	Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view
464	of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
467	And so he created this map,
470	which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods
474	as black bars at each address.
477	And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it
480	and you can see that one of the residences down the way
482	had about 15 people dead.
484	And the map is actually a little bit bigger.
486	As you get further and further away from the pump,
488	the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.
491	And so you can see this something poisonous
494	emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.
498	And so, with the help of this map,
500	and with the help of more evangelizing
502	that he did over the next few years
504	and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,
506	the authorities slowly started to come around.
508	It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,
511	but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,
516	the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,
520	in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem.
524	And they had already started building the sewers in London,
526	and they immediately went to this outbreak
528	and they told everybody to start boiling their water.
530	And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
535	So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,
538	it's a very dark story and it's a story
540	that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.
544	It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,
547	which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems
550	if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,
554	if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,
556	if we listen to the locals who understand
558	what's going on in these kinds of situations.
561	And what it ended up doing is making the idea
564	of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.
568	When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying
571	in the space of seven days,
573	there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,
576	that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.
580	But because of what Snow did, because of this map,
582	because of the whole series of reforms
584	that happened in the wake of this map,
586	we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,
590	cities like this one are in fact sustainable things.
592	We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself
595	quite the way that, you know, Rome did,
597	and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.
600	And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.
603	It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,
608	the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.
