16.069	Well, the subject of difficult negotiation
18.458	reminds me of one of my favorite stories
18.458	from the Middle East,
22.26	of a man who left
22.26	to his three sons, 17 camels.
26.038	To the first son, he left half the camels;
28.26	to the second son,
28.26	he left a third of the camels;
30.674	and to the youngest son,
30.674	he left a ninth of the camels.
33.293	The three sons got into a negotiation --
37.131	It doesn't divide by three.
38.893	It doesn't divide by nine.
40.456	Brotherly tempers started to get strained.
42.726	Finally, in desperation,
44.029	they went and they consulted
44.029	a wise old woman.
47.714	The wise old woman thought
47.714	about their problem for a long time,
50.713	and finally she came back and said,
50.713	"""Well, I don't know if I can help you,"
54.241	but at least, if you want,
54.241	"you can have my camel."""
56.642	So then, they had 18 camels.
58.134	The first son took his half --
58.134	half of 18 is nine.
61.016	The second son took his third --
61.016	a third of 18 is six.
63.734	The youngest son took his ninth --
63.734	a ninth of 18 is two.
67.63	You get 17.
69.843	They had one camel left over.
71.677	They gave it back to the wise old woman.
73.629	(Laughter)
75.26	Now, if you think
75.26	about that story for a moment,
77.523	I think it resembles a lot
77.523	of the difficult negotiations
81.118	we get involved in.
82.356	They start off like 17 camels,
82.356	no way to resolve it.
84.856	Somehow, what we need to do
86.316	is step back from those situations,
86.316	like that wise old woman,
90.021	look at the situation through fresh eyes
92.077	and come up with an 18th camel.
95.133	Finding that 18th camel
95.133	in the world's conflicts
97.923	has been my life passion.
100.105	I basically see humanity
100.105	a bit like those three brothers.
103.26	We're all one family.
105.405	We know that scientifically,
107.378	thanks to the communications revolution,
109.348	all the tribes on the planet --
109.348	all 15,000 tribes --
112.94	are in touch with each other.
115.543	And it's a big family reunion.
117.96	And yet, like many family reunions,
119.666	it's not all peace and light.
121.913	There's a lot of conflict,
123.838	and the question is:
123.838	How do we deal with our differences?
127.26	How do we deal with
127.26	our deepest differences,
129.38	given the human propensity for conflict
132.113	and the human genius at devising
132.113	weapons of enormous destruction?
136.664	That's the question.
138.437	As I've spent the last better part
138.437	of three decades, almost four,
143.26	traveling the world,
145.339	trying to work, getting
145.339	involved in conflicts
148.732	ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East
152.136	to Chechnya to Venezuela --
153.884	some of the most difficult conflicts
153.884	on the face of the planet --
156.981	I've been asking myself that question.
159.096	And I think I've found, in some ways,
159.096	what is the secret to peace.
162.516	It's actually surprisingly simple.
165.26	It's not easy, but it's simple.
168.46	It's not even new.
169.715	It may be one of our most
169.715	ancient human heritages.
173.113	The secret to peace is us.
175.922	It's us who act as a surrounding
175.922	community around any conflict,
181.088	who can play a constructive role.
183.26	Let me give you just a story, an example.
187.204	About 20 years ago,
188.38	I was in South Africa,
188.38	working with the parties in that conflict,
191.645	and I had an extra month,
192.932	so I spent some time living
192.932	with several groups of San Bushmen.
197.522	I was curious about them, about the way
197.522	in which they resolve conflict.
201.49	Because, after all, within living memory,
201.49	they were hunters and gatherers,
205.26	living pretty much
205.26	like our ancestors lived
207.64	for maybe 99 percent of the human story.
210.473	And all the men have these poison arrows
210.473	that they use for hunting --
213.86	absolutely fatal.
215.402	So how do they deal
215.402	with their differences?
217.72	Well, what I learned is, whenever
217.72	tempers rise in those communities,
222.333	someone goes and hides
222.333	the poison arrows out in the bush,
225.928	and then everyone sits around
225.928	in a circle like this,
229.587	and they sit and they talk and they talk.
232.563	It may take two days,
232.563	three days, four days,
234.898	but they don't rest
234.898	until they find a resolution
238.26	or better yet -- a reconciliation.
240.26	And if tempers are still too high,
242.317	then they send someone
242.317	off to visit some relatives,
244.88	as a cooling-off period.
246.658	Well, that system is, I think,
246.658	probably the system
249.667	that kept us alive to this point,
251.427	given our human tendencies.
254.101	"That system, I call ""the third side."""
257.316	Because if you think about it,
257.316	normally when we think of conflict,
260.459	when we describe it,
261.634	there's always two sides --
263.031	it's Arabs versus Israelis,
263.031	labor versus management,
265.761	husband versus wife,
265.761	Republicans versus Democrats.
268.936	But what we don't often see
270.745	is that there's always a third side,
273.135	and the third side of the conflict is us,
273.135	it's the surrounding community,
276.831	it's the friends, the allies,
278.26	the family members, the neighbors.
280.092	And we can play
280.092	an incredibly constructive role.
283.48	Perhaps the most fundamental way
283.48	in which the third side can help
288.319	is to remind the parties
288.319	of what's really at stake.
291.596	For the sake of the kids,
291.596	for the sake of the family,
294.124	for the sake of the community,
294.124	for the sake of the future,
296.918	let's stop fighting for a moment
296.918	and start talking.
300.066	Because, the thing is,
301.565	when we're involved in conflict,
303.162	it's very easy to lose perspective.
305.745	It's very easy to react.
307.808	Human beings -- we're reaction machines.
310.705	And as the saying goes,
312.102	when angry, you will make the best speech
314.649	you will ever regret.
316.158	(Laughter)
317.84	And so the third side reminds us of that.
320.86	The third side helps us go to the balcony,
322.909	which is a metaphor
322.909	for a place of perspective,
325.639	where we can keep our eyes on the prize.
328.069	Let me tell you a little story
328.069	from my own negotiating experience.
331.673	Some years ago, I was involved
331.673	as a facilitator in some very tough talks
336.768	between the leaders of Russia
336.768	and the leaders of Chechnya.
340.689	There was a war going on, as you know.
343.055	And we met in the Hague,
343.055	in the Peace Palace,
346.26	in the same room where the Yugoslav
346.26	war-crimes tribunal was taking place.
351.391	And the talks got off
351.391	to a rather rocky start
354.287	when the vice president of Chechnya
354.287	began by pointing at the Russians
357.719	"and said, ""You should stay"
357.719	right here in your seats,
360.26	because you're going
360.26	"to be on trial for war crimes."""
363.095	And then he turned to me and said,
364.929	"""You're an American."
366.135	Look at what you Americans
366.135	"are doing in Puerto Rico."""
369.385	"And my mind started racing, ""Puerto Rico?"
369.385	"What do I know about Puerto Rico?"""
373.032	I started reacting.
374.208	(Laughter)
375.233	But then, I tried to remember
375.233	to go to the balcony.
378.093	And then when he paused
379.315	and everyone looked at me for a response,
381.42	from a balcony perspective,
381.42	I was able to thank him for his remarks
384.822	"and say, ""I appreciate"
384.822	your criticism of my country
387.623	and I take it as a sign
387.623	that we're among friends
390.094	"and can speak candidly to one another."""
392.009	(Laughter)
393.034	"""And what we're here to do is not"
393.034	to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.
396.439	We're here to see
396.439	if we can figure out a way
398.644	to stop the suffering
398.644	"and the bloodshed in Chechnya."""
402.111	The conversation got back on track.
404.45	That's the role of the third side,
406.133	to help the parties go to the balcony.
409.082	Now let me take you, for a moment,
411.333	to what's widely regarded as the world's
411.333	most difficult conflict,
414.422	or the most impossible conflict,
414.422	the Middle East.
416.987	Question is: where's the third side there?
420.26	How could we possibly go to the balcony?
422.765	Now, I don't pretend to have an answer
422.765	to the Middle East conflict,
426.766	but I think I've got a first step --
426.766	literally, a first step --
430.75	something that any one of us
430.75	could do as third-siders.
433.761	Let me just ask you one question first.
435.992	How many of you in the last years
440.009	have ever found yourself
440.009	worrying about the Middle East
443.068	and wondering what anyone could do?
444.844	Just out of curiosity, how many of you?
446.985	OK, so the great majority of us.
449.977	And here, it's so far away.
451.605	Why do we pay so much attention
451.605	to this conflict?
454.545	Is it the number of deaths?
456.26	There are a hundred times more people
456.26	who die in a conflict in Africa
459.681	than in the Middle East.
460.856	No, it's because of the story,
462.967	because we feel personally
462.967	involved in that story.
466.699	Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,
466.699	religious or non-religious,
470.552	we feel we have a personal stake in it.
472.449	Stories matter;
473.624	as an anthropologist, I know that.
475.406	Stories are what we use
475.406	to transmit knowledge.
479.048	They give meaning to our lives.
480.593	That's what we tell here
480.593	at TED, we tell stories.
483.314	Stories are the key.
484.492	And so my question is --
487.73	yes, let's try and resolve the politics
487.73	there in the Middle East,
491.93	but let's also take a look at the story.
494.478	Let's try to get at the root
494.478	of what it's all about.
496.946	Let's see if we can apply
496.946	the third side to it.
499.19	What would that mean?
499.19	What is the story there?
502.018	Now, as anthropologists, we know
502.018	that every culture has an origin story.
506.756	What's the origin story
506.756	of the Middle East?
508.881	In a phrase, it's:
510.26	Four thousand years ago,
511.875	a man and his family walked
511.875	across the Middle East,
515.889	and the world has never
515.889	been the same since.
519.071	That man, of course, was Abraham.
522.569	And what he stood for was unity,
522.569	the unity of the family;
526.26	he's the father of us all.
528.26	But it's not just what he stood for,
528.26	it's what his message was.
531.273	His basic message was unity too,
533.26	the interconnectedness of it all,
533.26	the unity of it all.
536.494	And his basic value was respect,
539.828	was kindness toward strangers.
541.72	That's what he's known for,
541.72	his hospitality.
545.308	So in that sense,
546.959	he's the symbolic third side
546.959	of the Middle East.
550.943	He's the one who reminds us
550.943	that we're all part of a greater whole.
555.707	Now, think about that for a moment.
559.674	Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.
562.551	What is terrorism?
564.408	Terrorism is basically
564.408	taking an innocent stranger
567.691	and treating them as an enemy
567.691	whom you kill in order to create fear.
572.863	What's the opposite of terrorism?
575.236	It's taking an innocent stranger
576.98	and treating them as a friend
576.98	whom you welcome into your home,
581.391	in order to sow and create understanding
584.107	or respect, or love.
586.853	So what if, then, you took
586.853	the story of Abraham,
591.537	which is a third-side story,
593.194	what if that could be --
595.26	because Abraham stands for hospitality --
598.605	what if that could be
598.605	an antidote to terrorism?
601.843	What if that could be a vaccine
601.843	against religious intolerance?
605.689	How would you bring that story to life?
608.26	Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.
611.046	That's powerful, but people need
611.046	to experience the story.
614.464	They need to be able to live the story.
616.442	How would you do that?
617.742	And that was my thinking
617.742	of how would you do that.
620.26	And that's what comes
620.26	to the first step here.
622.427	Because the simple way to do that is:
625.174	you go for a walk.
626.983	You go for a walk
626.983	in the footsteps of Abraham.
630.422	You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.
633.374	Because walking has a real power.
636.67	You know, as an anthropologist,
636.67	walking is what made us human.
639.751	It's funny -- when you walk,
639.751	you walk side-by-side,
643.97	in the same common direction.
646.612	Now if I were to come to you face-to-face
648.697	and come this close to you,
650.967	you would feel threatened.
654.977	But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,
657.056	even touching shoulders,
658.961	it's no problem.
660.668	Who fights while they walk?
662.26	That's why in negotiations,
662.26	often, when things get tough,
665.26	people go for walks in the woods.
667.679	So the idea came to me
667.679	of, what about inspiring a path,
673.125	a route -- think the Silk Route,
673.125	think the Appalachian Trail --
676.787	that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?
681.037	"People said, ""That's crazy. You can't."
682.886	You can't retrace the footsteps
682.886	of Abraham -- it's too insecure,
685.922	you've got to cross all these borders,
687.804	it goes across 10 different countries
687.804	in the Middle East,
690.51	"because it unites them all."""
692.35	And so we studied the idea at Harvard.
694.21	We did our due diligence.
695.464	And then a few years ago,
696.687	a group of us, about 25 of us
696.687	from 10 different countries,
699.441	decided to see if we could retrace
699.441	the footsteps of Abraham,
702.645	going from his initial birthplace
702.645	in the city of Urfa
705.169	in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.
707.848	And we then took a bus and took some walks
710.832	and went to Harran, where, in the Bible,
710.832	he sets off on his journey.
715.013	Then we crossed the border
715.013	into Syria, went to Aleppo,
717.59	which, turns out, is named after Abraham.
719.962	We went to Damascus,
721.26	which has a long history
721.26	associated with Abraham.
724.028	We then came to Northern Jordan,
726.814	to Jerusalem -- which is all
726.814	about Abraham -- to Bethlehem,
731.864	and finally, to the place
731.864	where he's buried, in Hebron.
735.259	So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.
737.566	We showed it could be done.
738.891	It was an amazing journey.
740.594	Let me ask you a question.
742.26	How many of you have had the experience
742.26	of being in a strange neighborhood
746.647	or strange land,
748.887	and a total stranger, perfect stranger,
752.076	comes up to you
752.076	and shows you some kindness --
754.822	maybe invites you into their home,
754.822	gives you a drink,
757.345	gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?
759.148	How many of you have ever
759.148	had that experience?
761.342	That's the essence of the Abraham Path.
764.157	That's what you discover as you go
764.157	into these villages in the Middle East
767.698	where you expect hostility,
769.057	and you get the most amazing hospitality,
771.628	all associated with Abraham:
773.061	"""In the name of Father Ibrahim,"
773.061	"let me offer you some food."""
776.845	So what we discovered
778.052	is that Abraham is not just a figure
778.052	out of a book for those people;
781.284	he's alive, he's a living presence.
784.464	And to make a long story short,
786.615	in the last couple of years now,
788.701	thousands of people have begun to walk
788.701	parts of the path of Abraham
793.561	in the Middle East,
794.918	enjoying the hospitality
794.918	of the people there.
797.997	They've begun to walk
797.997	in Israel and Palestine,
801.26	in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.
804.004	It's an amazing experience.
805.337	Men, women, young people, old people --
807.646	more women than men,
807.646	actually, interestingly.
810.501	For those who can't walk,
812.46	who are unable to get there right now,
814.999	people started to organize walks
814.999	in cities, in their own communities.
818.643	In Cincinnati, for instance,
818.643	they organized a walk
821.041	from a church to a mosque to a synagogue
821.041	and all had an Abrahamic meal together.
824.907	It was Abraham Path Day.
826.393	In São Paulo, Brazil,
826.393	it's become an annual event
828.823	for thousands of people to run
828.823	in a virtual Abraham Path Run,
832.675	uniting the different communities.
834.47	The media love it; they really adore it.
837.474	They lavish attention on it
837.474	because it's visual
840.952	and it spreads the idea,
842.64	this idea of Abrahamic hospitality,
842.64	of kindness towards strangers.
847.046	And just a couple weeks ago,
847.046	there was an NPR story on it.
851.849	Last month,
853.041	there was a piece
853.041	in the Manchester Guardian about it,
858.982	two whole pages.
861.609	And they quoted a villager
864.853	"who said, ""This walk connects"
864.853	"us to the world."""
867.964	"He said, ""It was like a light"
867.964	that went on in our lives --
870.805	"it brought us hope."""
872.696	And so that's what it's about.
874.802	But it's not just about psychology;
876.632	it's about economics.
878.132	Because as people walk, they spend money.
881.26	And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,
884.26	is a woman who lives on the path
884.26	in Northern Jordan.
887.434	She's desperately poor.
889.26	She's partially blind,
889.26	her husband can't work,
892.929	she's got seven kids.
895.373	But what she can do is cook.
897.931	And so she's begun to cook
897.931	for some groups of walkers
900.496	who come through the village
900.496	and have a meal in her home.
904.124	They sit on the floor --
904.124	she doesn't even have a tablecloth.
907.448	She makes the most delicious food,
909.26	that's fresh from the herbs
909.26	in the surrounding countryside.
912.406	And so more and more walkers have come,
914.557	and lately she's begun to earn an income
914.557	to support her family.
918.475	And so she told our team there, she said,
921.376	"""You have made me visible"
924.566	in a village where people
924.566	"were once ashamed to look at me."""
929.015	That's the potential of the Abraham Path.
931.26	There are literally hundreds
931.26	of those kinds of communities
934.046	across the Middle East, across the path.
937.456	The potential is basically
937.456	to change the game.
940.719	And to change the game, you have to change
940.719	the frame, the way we see things --
944.449	to change the frame
944.449	from hostility to hospitality,
949.791	from terrorism to tourism.
952.26	And in that sense, the Abraham Path
955.021	is a game-changer.
957.147	Let me just show you one thing.
958.949	I have a little acorn here
960.583	that I picked up while I was walking
960.583	on the path earlier this year.
964.626	Now, the acorn is associated
964.626	with the oak tree, of course --
967.497	grows into an oak tree,
967.497	which is associated with Abraham.
970.599	The path right now is like an acorn;
972.566	it's still in its early phase.
974.653	What would the oak tree look like?
976.597	When I think back to my childhood,
978.26	a good part of which I spent,
978.26	after being born here in Chicago,
981.237	I spent in Europe.
983.071	If you had been in the ruins of, say,
983.071	London in 1945, or Berlin,
989.801	and you had said,
991.024	"""Sixty years from now,"
992.731	this is going to be the most peaceful,
992.731	"prosperous part of the planet,"""
996.08	people would have thought
996.08	you were certifiably insane.
999.418	But they did it, thanks
999.418	to a common identity, Europe,
1003.26	and a common economy.
1005.26	So my question is,
1005.26	if it can be done in Europe,
1008.593	why not in the Middle East?
1010.26	Why not, thanks to a common identity,
1010.26	which is the story of Abraham,
1014.971	and thanks to a common economy that
1014.971	would be based, in good part, on tourism?
1020.45	So let me conclude, then,
1022.681	by saying that in the last 35 years,
1026.054	as I've worked
1026.054	in some of the most dangerous,
1028.495	difficult and intractable conflicts
1028.495	around the planet,
1031.446	I have yet to see one conflict
1031.446	that I felt could not be transformed.
1037.598	It's not easy, of course.
1039.963	But it's possible.
1041.726	It was done in South Africa.
1043.69	It was done in Northern Ireland.
1045.599	It could be done anywhere.
1047.14	It simply depends on us.
1049.79	It depends on us taking the third side.
1053.182	So let me invite you to consider
1053.182	taking the third side,
1056.818	even as a very small step.
1058.508	We're about to take a break in a moment.
1060.754	Just go up to someone
1062.755	who's from a different culture,
1062.755	a different country,
1065.422	a different ethnicity --
1065.422	some difference --
1067.801	and engage them in a conversation.
1069.462	Listen to them.
1070.72	That's a third-side act.
1072.26	That's walking Abraham's Path.
1074.568	After a TED Talk,
1076.117	why not a TED Walk?
1077.59	(Laughter)
1079.035	So let me just leave you
1079.035	with three things.
1083.222	One is, the secret to peace
1083.222	is the third side.
1088.646	The third side is us.
1091.09	Each of us, with a single step,
1094.685	can take the world, can bring the world
1097.429	a step closer to peace.
1100.578	There's an old African proverb that goes:
1102.658	"""When spiderwebs unite,"
1104.848	"they can halt even the lion."""
1107.93	If we're able to unite
1107.93	our third-side webs of peace,
1112.229	we can even halt the lion of war.
1115.261	Thank you very much.
1116.436	(Applause)
