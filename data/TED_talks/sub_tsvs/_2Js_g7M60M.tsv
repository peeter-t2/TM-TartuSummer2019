25	Let me show you some images
26	of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.
29	So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.
39	This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park
44	in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.
48	This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela
52	in Rio de Janeiro.
54	And this is Sultanbelyi,
56	which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.
63	They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,
65	the new urban world.
67	Now, why do I say that?
69	To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,
72	his name is Julius.
74	And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.
79	So, I had been there almost three months,
82	and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas
86	and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed
89	and at certain points we were walking around,
92	he grabbed my hand for support,
94	which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.
97	They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.
102	And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,
108	and he's one of many.
112	So, close to 200,000 people a day
116	migrate from the rural to the urban areas.
120	That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians
123	who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,
126	but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,
129	and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,
133	close to 70 million people a year.
137	And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.
141	So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,
144	between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.
148	And here are the statistics.
151	Today -- a billion squatters,
153	one in six people on the planet.
158	one in four people on the planet.
160	And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,
163	better than one in three people on earth.
167	So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.
176	And I was thinking this morning of the good life,
182	and before I show you the rest of my presentation,
184	I'm going to violate TED rules here,
186	and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.
192	Because I think it says something about reversing our perception
197	of what we think the good life is.
204	"So -- ""The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad."
209	It was a 10 by 10 cell.
212	Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.
216	Armstrong and his friends had no water --
219	they bought it from a nearby tap owner --
221	no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --
226	and no sewers or sanitation.
228	They did have electricity,
230	but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,
233	and could only power one feeble bulb.
236	This was Southland, a small shanty community
239	on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.
241	But it could've been anywhere in the city,
244	because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.
247	1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts
251	with no services, no toilets, no rights.
254	"""Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:"
258	they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,
261	a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,
264	and they could not afford to be late with the money.
267	'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen
269	and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.
273	'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,
278	who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction
281	that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.
285	They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person
288	who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.
294	Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;
297	the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;
300	and we perspired as we ate.
302	"""After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,"
305	put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.
309	Outside a mound of garbage formed the border
312	between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.
315	It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.
320	And it was set in a wider watery ooze.
324	As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.
328	They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.
330	They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck
334	sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.
338	I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.
342	Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,
346	squatted, and defecated.
348	The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
352	When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,
357	a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.
361	But it stood in jarring contrast
363	to something Armstrong had said as we were eating --
366	that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.
369	"""For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions."
374	Instead, the human spirit radiated out
377	from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something
380	no legal neighborhood could: freedom.
383	'This place is very addictive,' he had said.
386	'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.
389	Nobody is controlling what you do.
392	Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'
396	He meant back beyond that mountain of trash,
398	back in the legal city, of legal buildings,
401	with legal leases and legal rights.
404	'Once you have stayed here,' he said,
407	"'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"""
411	So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.
416	This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,
421	little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.
426	This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.
429	This is home improvement:
431	putting plastic tarps on your roof.
435	This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?
439	We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,
445	and plaster over the brick, some color,
448	and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.
453	He's got a fence; he scavenged a door;
455	he's got new tile on the roof.
458	And then you get Rocinha
460	and you can see that it's getting even better.
464	The buildings here are multi-story.
466	They develop -- you can see on the far right
469	one where it seems to just stack on top of each other,
472	room, after room, after room.
474	And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,
478	and they sell their loggia or roof rights,
481	and someone else builds on top of their building,
482	and then that person sells the roof rights,
484	and someone else builds on top of their building.
486	All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.
490	And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built
494	to a higher level of design.
495	The crud in the front is mattress stuffing,
498	and you see that all over Turkey.
500	People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.
504	But the green building, on behind,
506	you can see that the top floor is not occupied,
508	so people are building with the possibility of expansion.
511	And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.
514	And then you finally get squatter homes like this,
516	which is built on the suburban model.
518	Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.
521	That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
523	They're quite vital places, these communities.
525	This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,
529	and there's a bus route that runs through it,
531	lots of people out on the street.
533	These communities in these cities are actually more vital
536	than the illegal communities.
538	They have more things going on in them.
541	"This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a ""beco"" --"
544	these are how you get around the community.
546	It's on very steep ground.
548	They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,
551	and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.
555	So, that's just a rock in the hillside.
557	And these becos are normally very crowded,
561	and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,
564	all sorts of things.
566	Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.
568	Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.
571	This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,
576	so close to the train tracks that the merchants
578	sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.
581	This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,
584	lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.
588	Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.
591	This is a shopping street in Kibera,
593	and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,
598	two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.
603	It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.
608	This here, on the right-hand side,
611	is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --
614	it's a hotel.
616	And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.
622	So, that's a restaurant.
624	People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.
626	"People tap in and they have thieves who are called ""grillos"" or ""crickets,"""
633	and they steal the electrical power
635	and wire the neighborhood.
637	People burn trash to get rid of the garbage,
640	and they dig their own sewer channels.
644	Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.
647	And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.
651	And when they have more money they cement their streets,
654	and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.
658	This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,
664	and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:
667	they steal electricity; they install a pump
669	and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.
673	So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,
679	to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?
684	I say there are two things.
686	One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.
688	That does not necessarily mean property rights,
690	and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,
694	because property rights create a lot of complications.
696	They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt
700	and have to pay back the debt,
702	and sometimes have to sell their property
704	in order to pay back the debt.
706	There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights
708	sometimes don't work in these cases,
710	but they do need security of tenure.
712	And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.
716	That can mean community organizing from below,
720	but it can also mean possibilities from above.
723	And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.
728	Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.
730	"One is that -- it's called ""gecekondu"" in Turkish,"
733	"which means ""built overnight,"" and if you build your house overnight"
737	in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,
741	if they don't catch you during the night.
744	And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people
748	in the community, you can petition the government
750	to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.
754	And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.
757	You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,
759	provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
763	So, these are the civic leaders of the future.
767	The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.
768	She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.
774	That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family
776	on the tent along the same highway median.
778	They're very outspoken. They're very active.
780	They can be community leaders.
783	"This woman is Nine, which means ""grandma"" in Turkish."
786	And there were three old ladies who lived in --
788	that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,
793	and they are the backbone of the community there.
796	This is Richard Muthama Peter,
798	and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.
801	He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,
804	and the people in the neighborhood,
806	and is a great resource in the community.
808	And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,
812	the fruit merchant with his two kids here,
814	and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.
819	The future of these communities is in the people
821	and in our ability to work with those people.
825	So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,
829	from what Armstrong said, and from all these people,
831	is that these are neighborhoods.
833	The issue is not urban poverty.
835	The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.
838	The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --
841	this is a legitimate form of urban development --
844	and that cities have to engage these residents,
847	because they are building the cities of the future.
850	Thank you very much.
