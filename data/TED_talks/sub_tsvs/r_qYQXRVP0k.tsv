12.498	So I'd like you to come back with me
15.157	just for a few minutes
17.058	to a dark night in China,
19.927	the night I met my husband.
22.648	It was a city so long ago that it was still called
26.091	Peking.
28.204	So I went to a party.
30.825	I sat down next to a stout, middle-aged man
34.208	with owl glasses and a bow tie,
37.722	and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar,
40.615	there in China specifically to study
44.179	Sino-Soviet relations.
46.27	What a gift it was to the eager,
48.67	young foreign correspondent that I was then.
51.428	I'd pump him for information,
53.436	I'm mentally scribbling notes
55.093	for the stories I plan to write.
57.402	I talk to him for hours.
59.887	Only months later,
63.398	I discover who he really was.
65.772	He was the China representative
68.545	for the American Soybean Association.
72.774	"""I don't understand. Soybeans?"
76.044	"You told me you were a Fulbright scholar."""
78.799	"""Well, how long would you have talked to me"
80.687	"if I told you we're in soybeans?"""
82.729	(Laughter)
85.21	"I said, ""You jerk."""
88.502	Only jerk wasn't the word I used.
92.255	"I said, ""You could've gotten me fired."""
96.402	"And he said, ""Let's get married."""
99.939	(Laughter)
101.226	"""Travel the world and have lots of kids."""
104.122	So we did.
106.22	(Laughter)
108.265	(Applause)
113.507	And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley
117.247	turned out to be.
118.694	He was a Chinese scholar
120.337	who later, in his 60s,
122.203	got a Ph.D. in Chinese history.
124.755	He spoke six languages,
127.243	he played 15 musical instruments,
129.731	he was a licensed pilot,
131.507	he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator,
134.678	he was an expert in swine nutrition,
137.512	dairy cattle, Dixieland jazz, film noir,
141.293	and we did travel the country, and the world,
145.477	and we did have a lot of kids.
147.706	We followed my job, and it seemed like
149.448	there was nothing that we couldn't do.
153.015	So when we found the cancer,
156.797	it doesn't seem strange to us at all
159.362	that without saying a word to each other,
161.995	we believed that,
164.421	if we were smart enough
166.68	and strong enough and brave enough,
171.011	and we worked hard enough,
173.484	we could keep him from dying ever.
178.762	And for years, it seemed like we were succeeding.
182.261	The surgeon emerged from the surgery.
185.14	What'd he say? He said what surgeons always say:
187.417	"""We got it all."""
189.419	Then there was a setback when the pathologists
192.462	looked at the kidney cancer closely.
194.835	It turned out to be a rare,
196.464	exceedingly aggressive type,
198.273	with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal
201.355	in several weeks at most.
203.746	And yet, he did not die.
207.456	Mysteriously, he lived on.
210.966	He coached Little League for our son.
213.05	He built a playhouse for our daughter.
215.602	And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet
218.676	looking for specialists.
220.35	I'm looking for a cure.
222.911	So a year goes by
224.988	before the cancer, as cancers do,
228.194	reappears,
230.194	and with it comes another death sentence,
232.27	this time nine months.
234.463	So we try another treatment, aggressive, nasty.
238.477	It makes him so sick, he has to quit it,
240.297	yet still he lives on.
243.314	Then another year goes by.
245.21	Two years go by.
246.76	More specialists.
248.249	We take the kids to Italy.
250.169	We take the kids to Australia.
252.638	And then more years pass,
255.35	and the cancer begins to grow.
257.74	This time, there's new treatments on the horizon.
260.275	They're exotic. They're experimental.
262.211	They're going to attack the cancer in new ways.
265.419	So he enters a clinical trial, and it works.
269.745	The cancer begins to shrink,
271.674	and for the third time,
273.951	we've dodged death.
277.31	So now I ask you,
280.607	how do I feel
282.996	when the time finally comes
285.51	and there's another dark night,
288.016	sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.?
290.517	This time it's on the intensive care ward
293.491	when a twentysomething resident
295.329	that I've never met before
297.532	tells me that Terence is dying,
300.125	perhaps tonight.
302.324	So what do I say when he says,
305.117	"""What do you want me to do?"""
307.931	There's another drug out there.
309.943	It's newer. It's more powerful.
311.631	He started it just two weeks ago.
314.2	Perhaps there's still hope ahead.
317.309	So what do I say?
319.264	"I say, ""Keep him alive if you can."""
322.62	And Terence died six days later.
326.135	So we fought, we struggled, we triumphed.
330.183	It was an exhilarating fight,
331.979	and I'd repeat the fight today
333.696	without a moment's hesitation.
336.345	We fought together, we lived together.
339.296	It turned what could have been
341.4	seven of the grimmest years of our life
344.134	into seven of the most glorious.
347.745	It was also an expensive fight.
350.52	It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices
352.481	that everyone here agrees
354.115	pump up the cost of end-of-life care,
356.52	and of healthcare for all of us.
358.806	And for me, for us,
361.888	we pushed the fight right over the edge,
363.97	and I never got the chance to say to him
367.195	what I say to him now almost every day:
370.615	"""Hey, buddy, it was a hell of a ride."""
373.692	We never got the chance to say goodbye.
376.18	We never thought it was the end.
378.459	We always had hope.
383.638	So what do we make of all of this?
387.502	Being a journalist, after Terence died,
391.08	"I wrote a book, ""The Cost Of Hope."""
394.369	I wrote it because I wanted to know
396.519	why I did what I did,
398.205	why he did what he did,
400.006	why everyone around us did what they did.
402.561	And what did I discover?
404.197	Well, one of the things I discovered is that
405.771	experts think that one answer to
408.848	what I did at the end was a piece of paper,
411.598	the advance directive,
413.756	to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices.
418.096	Yet I had that piece of paper.
422.21	We both did.
424.263	And they were readily available.
425.953	I had them right at hand.
427.892	Both of them said the same thing:
430.251	Do nothing if there is no further hope.
434.752	I knew Terence's wishes
436.972	as clearly and as surely as I knew my own.
440.786	Yet we never got to no further hope.
445.99	Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands,
448.747	we just kept redefining hope.
452.003	I believed I could keep him from dying,
457.295	and I'd be embarrassed to say that if I hadn't seen
460.109	so many people and have talked to so many people
462.32	who have felt exactly the same way.
464.994	Right up until days before his death,
468.928	I felt strongly
472.254	and powerfully, and, you might say, irrationally,
476.297	that I could keep him from dying ever.
481.544	Now, what do the experts call this?
484.779	They say it's denial.
487.126	It's a strong word, isn't it?
489.317	Yet I will tell you that denial
491.714	isn't even close to a strong enough word
496.828	to describe what those of us
499.474	facing the death of our loved ones go through.
503.112	And I hear the medical professionals say,
505.453	"""Well, we'd like to do such-and-such,"
507.536	but the family's in denial.
509.987	The family won't listen to reason.
512.163	They're in denial.
514.185	How can they insist on this treatment at the end?
516.537	"It's so clear, yet they're in denial."""
519.841	Now, I think this maybe isn't
521.848	a very useful way of thinking.
524.852	It's not just families either.
527.13	The medical professionals too,
529.255	you out there, you're in denial too.
532.615	You want to help. You want to fix.
535.468	You want to do.
537.294	You've succeeded in everything you've done,
540.102	and having a patient die,
542.144	well, that must feel like failure.
545.723	I saw it firsthand.
547.567	Just days before Terence died,
550.269	his oncologist said,
552.287	"""Tell Terence that better days are just ahead."""
555.535	Days before he died.
557.917	Yet Ira Byock,
559.35	the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth
561.698	"said, ""You know, the best doctor in the world"
564.629	"has never succeeded in making anyone immortal."""
569.237	"So what the experts call ""denial,"" I call ""hope,"""
575.743	and I'd like to borrow a phrase
578.077	from my friends in software design.
581.298	You just redefine denial and hope,
584.86	and it becomes a feature of being human.
588.088	It's not a bug.
589.949	It's a feature.
592.275	(Laughter)
595.369	So we need to think more constructively
599.063	about this very common, very profound
603.375	and very powerful human emotion.
607.331	It's part of the human condition,
609.955	and yet our system and our thinking
612.132	isn't built to accommodate it.
615.301	So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night,
618.356	and I believed it.
620.261	Maybe I wanted to believe it.
623.375	And during Terence's illness, I, we,
628.704	we wanted to believe the story
630.426	of our fight together too.
633.021	Giving up the fight -- for that's how it felt,
636.757	it felt like giving up --
638.696	meant giving up not only his life
641.413	but also our story,
645.12	our story of us as fighters,
647.33	the story of us as invincible,
650.26	and for the doctors, the story of themselves
652.468	as healers.
655.026	So what do we need?
657.71	Maybe we don't need a new piece of paper.
660.649	Maybe we need a new story,
663.596	not a story about giving up the fight
667.605	or of hopelessness,
669.876	but rather a story of victory and triumph,
673.287	of a valiant battle and, eventually,
678.13	a graceful retreat,
680.45	a story that acknowledges
683.457	that not even the greatest general defeats every foe,
687.22	that no doctor has ever succeeded
689.841	in making anyone immortal,
692.231	and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried,
698.297	has ever stopped even the bravest,
702.982	wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband
707.031	from dying when it was his time to go.
711.224	People did mention hospice,
713.537	but I wouldn't listen.
716.908	Hospice was for people who were dying,
720.833	and Terence wasn't dying.
723.606	As a result, he spent just four days in hospice,
726.516	which I'm sure, as you all know,
728.333	is a pretty typical outcome,
730.423	and we never said goodbye
731.935	because we were unprepared for the end.
734.99	We have a noble path to curing the disease,
738.737	patients and doctors alike,
741.067	but there doesn't seem to be
743.19	a noble path to dying.
745.79	Dying is seen as failing,
748.848	and we had a heroic narrative
751.5	for fighting together,
753.593	but we didn't have a heroic narrative for letting go.
758.623	So maybe we need a narrative
762.741	for acknowledging the end, and for saying goodbye,
766.217	and maybe our new story will be
768.779	about a hero's fight, and a hero's goodbye.
773.385	Terence loved poetry,
775.852	and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy
779.079	is one of my favorite poets.
781.508	So I'll give you a couple lines from him.
784.392	This is a poem about Mark Antony.
786.608	You know Mark Antony, the conquering hero,
789.301	Cleopatra's guy?
791.166	Actually, one of Cleopatra's guys.
793.703	And he's been a pretty good general.
796.128	He's won all the fights,
797.188	he's eluded all the people that are out to get him,
799.643	and yet this time, finally,
801.431	he's come to the city of Alexandria
803.18	and realized he's lost.
804.862	The people are leaving. They're playing instruments.
806.578	They're singing.
807.901	And suddenly he knows he's been defeated.
810.501	And he suddenly knows
812.68	he's been deserted by the gods,
815.205	and it's time to let go.
817.145	And the poet tells him what to do.
819.112	He tells him how to say a noble goodbye,
822.378	a goodbye that's fit for a hero.
826.225	"""As if long-prepared,"
828.974	as if courageous,
831.653	as it becomes you
834.25	who were worthy of such a city,
836.422	approach the window with a firm step,
838.825	and with emotion,
841.36	but not with the entreaties
843.559	or the complaints of a coward,
846.32	as a last enjoyment,
848.291	listen to the sounds,
850.415	the exquisite instruments of the musical troops,
853.749	and bid her farewell,
856.03	"the Alexandria you are losing."""
860.445	That's a goodbye for a man who was larger than life,
864.135	a goodbye for a man
866.153	for whom anything,
868.127	well, almost anything,
871.235	was possible,
873.125	a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive.
876.265	And isn't that what we're missing?
878.458	How can we learn that people's decisions
880.517	about their loved ones
882.027	are often based strongly, powerfully,
885.956	many times irrationally,
888.808	on the slimmest of hopes?
891.152	The overwhelming presence of hope
894.174	isn't denial.
895.597	It's part of our DNA as humans,
898.417	and maybe it's time our healthcare system --
900.735	doctors, patients, insurance companies, us,
905.219	started accounting for the power of that hope.
909.193	Hope isn't a bug.
911.493	It's a feature.
913.862	Thank you.
916.357	(Applause)
