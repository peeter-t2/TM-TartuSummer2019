25	What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,
28	is simply repeat many of the points
31	that the three people before me have already made,
34	but do them --
36	"this is called ""creative collaboration;"""
38	"it's actually called ""borrowing"" --"
41	but do it through a particular perspective,
43	and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers
46	in this emerging world of
48	collaborative creativity
50	that Jimmy and others have talked about.
53	Let me just ask you, to start with,
55	this simple question:
57	who invented the mountain bike?
59	Because traditional economic theory would say,
62	well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation
65	that had a big R&amp;D lab
67	where they were thinking up new projects,
69	and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
72	Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius
75	working in his garage, who,
77	working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up
79	with a bike out of thin air.
81	It didn't come from there. The mountain bike
83	came from users, came from young users,
87	particularly a group in Northern California,
89	who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,
92	which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,
95	or your big brother, and they're very glamorous.
97	But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,
100	which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.
103	So, they got the frames from these big bikes,
105	put them together with the gears from the racing bikes,
108	got the brakes from motorcycles,
112	and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.
114	And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,
117	"mountain bikes were known as ""clunkers."""
119	And they were just made in a community of bikers,
122	mainly in Northern California.
124	And then one of these companies that was importing parts
127	for the clunkers decided to set up in business,
129	start selling them to other people,
131	and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,
134	and it probably was, I don't know,
138	before the big bike companies
140	realized there was a market.
142	Thirty years later,
144	mountain bike sales
146	and mountain bike equipment
148	account for 65 percent of bike sales in America.
150	That's 58 billion dollars.
153	This is a category entirely created by consumers
156	that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market
159	because they couldn't see the need,
161	the opportunity;
163	they didn't have the incentive to innovate.
166	The one thing I think I disagree with
168	about Yochai's presentation
170	is when he said the Internet causes
172	this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.
175	It's when the Internet combines
178	with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --
181	who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;
184	they've got the tools; they want to --
186	that you get this kind of explosion
188	of creative collaboration.
191	And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things
194	that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,
197	or a better way to put it:
199	how do we organize ourselves without organizations?
202	That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,
206	to achieve large and complex tasks,
208	like innovating new software programs.
211	So this is a huge challenge
214	to the way we think creativity comes about.
218	The traditional view, still enshrined
220	in much of the way that we think about creativity
223	-- in organizations, in government --
225	is that creativity is about special people:
228	wear baseball caps the wrong way round,
230	come to conferences like this, in special places,
233	elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water,
238	maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,
241	you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.
245	Special people, special places, think up special ideas,
248	then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas
250	down to the waiting consumers, who are passive.
254	"They can say ""yes"" or ""no"" to the invention."
256	That's the idea of creativity.
258	What's the policy recommendation out of that
260	if you're in government, or you're running a large company?
264	More special people, more special places.
267	Build creative clusters in cities;
269	create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.
272	Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.
275	Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
278	I think it's always been wrong,
280	because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,
283	and it's probably been largely interactive.
286	But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong
289	is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.
292	The ideas are coming back from the consumers,
294	and they're often ahead of the producers.
297	Why is that?
299	Well, one issue
302	is that radical innovation,
304	when you've got ideas that
306	affect a large number of technologies or people,
310	have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.
312	The payoffs to innovation are greatest
314	where the uncertainty is highest.
317	And when you get a radical innovation,
319	it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.
322	The whole history of telephony
324	is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.
328	The very first landline telephones,
330	the inventors thought
332	that they would be used for people to listen in
334	to live performances
336	from West End theaters.
338	When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,
341	they had no idea what it was for;
343	it was only when that technology got into the hands
345	of teenage users
347	that they invented the use.
349	So the more radical the innovation,
352	the more the uncertainty,
354	the more you need innovation in use
356	to work out what a technology is for.
359	All of our patents, our entire approach
362	to patents and invention, is based on the idea
365	that the inventor knows what the invention is for;
368	we can say what it's for.
370	More and more, the inventors of things
372	will not be able to say that in advance.
374	It will be worked out in use,
376	in collaboration with users.
379	We like to think that invention is
381	a sort of moment of creation:
384	there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.
387	The truth is that most creativity
390	is cumulative and collaborative;
392	like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.
397	The second reason why users are more and more important
400	is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.
404	If you want to find the big new ideas,
407	it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,
410	in big organizations.
413	And just look inside large organizations
415	and you'll see why that is so.
417	So, you're in a big corporation.
421	You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.
424	Do you go into your board and say,
426	"""Look, I've got a fantastic idea"
428	for an embryonic product
430	in a marginal market,
432	with consumers we've never dealt with before,
435	"and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"""
438	No, what you do, is you go in and you say,
441	"""I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation"
444	to an existing product we sell through existing channels
447	to existing users, and I can guarantee
449	"you get this much return out of it over the next three years."""
453	Big corporations have an in-built tendency
455	to reinforce past success.
457	They've got so much sunk in it
459	that it's very difficult for them to spot
462	emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,
465	are the breeding grounds for passionate users.
468	Best example:
470	who in the music industry,
475	"""Yes, let's invent a musical form"
478	which is all about dispossessed black men
481	in ghettos expressing their frustration
483	with the world through a form of music
485	that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
488	"That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."""
491	(Laughter).
492	So what happens? Rap music is created by the users.
495	They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;
498	they distribute it themselves.
501	rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture --
504	would never have come from the big companies.
506	Had to start -- this is the third point --
509	with these pro-ams.
511	This is the phrase that I've used in
513	some stuff which I've done
515	with a think tank in London called Demos,
517	where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --
520	i.e., they do it for the love of it --
523	but they want to do it to very high standards.
525	And across a whole range of fields --
527	from software, astronomy,
531	natural sciences,
533	vast areas of leisure and culture
535	like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --
538	you find people who want to do things because they love it,
542	but they want to do these things to very high standards.
545	They work at their leisure, if you like.
547	They take their leisure very seriously:
549	they acquire skills; they invest time;
552	they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:
555	cameras, design technology,
558	leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.
561	Largely through globalization,
563	a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
566	More knowledgeable consumers, more educated,
569	more able to connect with one another,
571	more able to do things together.
573	Consumption, in that sense, is an expression
575	of their productive potential.
577	Why, we found, people were interested in this,
581	is that at work they don't feel very expressed.
584	They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,
587	so they pick up these kinds of activities.
590	This has huge organizational implications
592	for very large areas of life.
594	Take astronomy as an example,
597	which Yochai has already mentioned.
600	Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,
602	only big professional astronomers
605	with very big telescopes could see far into space.
609	And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,
612	and when I was a kid, it was amazing,
614	because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
620	Now, six
623	amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,
625	with Dobsonian digital telescopes --
627	which are pretty much open source --
630	with some light sensors
632	developed over the last 10 years, the Internet --
634	they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.
638	So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion
641	of new productive resources.
643	The users can be producers.
646	What does this mean, then, for our
648	organizational landscape?
650	Well, just imagine a world,
652	for the moment, divided into two camps.
656	Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:
659	special people, special places;
661	patent it, push it down the pipeline
663	to largely waiting, passive consumers.
666	Over here, let's imagine we've got
668	Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.
672	This is open; this is closed.
674	This is new; this is traditional.
676	Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,
679	is what Yochai has said already --
681	is there is a great big struggle
683	between those two organizational forms.
685	These people over there will do everything they can
688	to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,
691	because they're threatened by them.
693	And so the debates about
696	copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth --
700	these are all about trying to stifle, in my view,
703	these kinds of organizations.
705	What we're seeing is a complete corruption
708	of the idea of patents and copyright.
710	Meant to be a way to incentivize invention,
714	meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,
717	they are increasingly being used by large companies
720	to create thickets of patents
722	to prevent innovation taking place.
724	Let me just give you two examples.
727	The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist
730	"and saying, ""I've got a fantastic idea."
732	I've invented this brilliant new program
735	"that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."""
739	Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture
743	competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.
746	That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --
749	will only come --
751	from an open-source kind of project.
753	So, there is a huge competitive argument
755	about sustaining the capacity
757	for open-source and consumer-driven innovation,
760	because it's one of the greatest
762	competitive levers against monopoly.
765	There'll be huge professional arguments as well.
768	Because the professionals, over here
770	in these closed organizations --
772	they might be academics; they might be programmers;
774	they might be doctors; they might be journalists --
777	my former profession --
779	"say, ""No, no -- you can't trust these people over here."""
783	When I started in journalism --
785	Financial Times, 20 years ago --
789	it was very, very exciting
791	to see someone reading the newspaper.
793	And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube
795	to see if they were reading your article.
798	Usually they were reading the share prices,
800	and the bit of the paper with your article on
802	was on the floor, or something like that,
804	"and you know, ""For heaven's sake, what are they doing!"
806	"They're not reading my brilliant article!"""
809	And we allowed users, readers,
812	two places where they could contribute to the paper:
814	the letters page, where they could write a letter in,
817	and we would condescend to them, cut it in half,
819	and print it three days later.
821	Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --
823	had been to school with him, slept with his wife --
825	they could write an article for the op-ed page.
828	Those were the two places.
830	Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.
834	That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.
837	But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think
839	that the bloggers want to be journalists;
841	they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.
843	They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.
846	They want to be part of that flow of information.
850	What's happening there is that the whole domain
852	of creativity is expanding.
854	So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.
857	But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement
860	from the open to the closed.
863	What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,
866	and these, I think, are two challenges
868	for the open movement.
870	The first is:
872	can we really survive on volunteers?
875	If this is so critical,
877	do we not need it funded, organized, supported
880	in much more structured ways?
882	I think the idea of creating the Red Cross
884	for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,
887	but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?
891	What kind of changes do we need in public policy
893	and funding to make that possible?
895	What's the role of the BBC,
897	for instance, in that world?
899	What should be the role of public policy?
901	And finally, what I think you will see
904	is the intelligent, closed organizations
907	moving increasingly in the open direction.
910	So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,
913	but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places
916	that people will occupy.
918	New organizational models coming about,
921	mixing closed and open in tricky ways.
924	It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --
928	there'll be all sorts of things in between.
930	And those organizational models, it turns out,
932	are incredibly powerful,
934	and the people who can understand them
936	will be very, very successful.
938	Let me just give you one final example
941	of what that means.
943	I was in Shanghai,
945	in an office block
947	built on what was a rice paddy five years ago --
950	one of the 2,500 skyscrapers
953	they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.
956	And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.
959	Timothy Chan set up an Internet business
961	in 2000.
963	Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money,
966	decided to go into computer games.
968	He runs a company called Shanda,
971	which is the largest computer games company in China.
975	Nine thousand servers all over China,
978	has 250 million subscribers.
982	At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.
987	How many people does he employ
989	to service that population?
994	Well, how can he service
999	Because basically, he doesn't service them.
1001	He gives them a platform;
1003	he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools
1006	and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;
1009	he orchestrates the action.
1011	But actually, a lot of the content
1013	is created by the users themselves.
1016	And it creates a kind of stickiness
1018	between the community and the company
1020	which is really, really powerful.
1022	The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,
1025	you create a character
1027	that you develop in the course of the game.
1029	If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,
1032	or there's some other problem,
1034	you lose your character.
1036	You've got two options.
1038	One option: you can create a new character,
1041	right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.
1044	That costs about 100 dollars.
1046	Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,
1049	queue up outside Shanda's offices --
1052	cost probably 600, 700 dollars --
1056	and reclaim your character, get your history back.
1059	Every morning, there are 600 people queuing
1061	outside their offices
1063	to reclaim these characters. (Laughter)
1065	So this is about companies built on communities,
1068	that provide communities with tools,
1071	resources, platforms in which they can share.
1073	He's not open source,
1075	but it's very, very powerful.
1077	So here is one of the challenges, I think,
1080	for people like me, who
1082	do a lot of work with government.
1085	If you're a games company,
1088	and you've got a million players in your game,
1091	you only need one percent of them
1094	to be co-developers, contributing ideas,
1096	and you've got a development workforce
1098	of 10,000 people.
1101	Imagine you could take all the children
1104	in education in Britain, and one percent of them
1107	were co-developers of education.
1109	What would that do to the resources available
1111	to the education system?
1113	Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS
1116	to, in some sense, be co-producers of health.
1119	The reason why --
1121	despite all the efforts to cut it down,
1124	to constrain it, to hold it back --
1126	why these open models will still start emerging
1129	with tremendous force,
1131	is that they multiply our productive resources.
1133	And one of the reasons they do that
1135	is that they turn users into producers,
1137	consumers into designers.
1139	Thank you very much.
