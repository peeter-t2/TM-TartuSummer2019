12.631	Why do people deliberately
12.631	destroy cultural heritage?
18.209	By doing so,
19.545	do they believe
19.545	they're erasing our history?
23.163	Our cultural memory?
26.39	It's true that we are losing
26.39	cultural heritage to erosion
31.091	and natural disasters,
32.924	but this is something
32.924	that is simply difficult to avoid.
36.696	I'm here to show you today
36.696	how we can use pictures --
40.826	your pictures --
42.708	to reclaim the history that is being lost
45.852	using innovative technology
48.099	and the effort of volunteers.
52.002	In the early 20th century,
54.047	archaeologists discovered
54.047	hundreds of statues and artifacts
58.059	at the ancient city of Hatra,
59.817	in northern Iraq.
61.796	Statues like this one
61.796	were found in fragments,
65.601	some of them missing their heads or arms,
68.762	yet the clothing that they are wearing
71.299	and their pose
72.769	can still tell us their story.
76.059	For example,
77.233	we believe that by wearing
77.233	a knee-length tunic
80.991	and open bare feet,
82.515	this was representative of a priest.
85.782	However, with a closer look
85.782	at this particular piece,
89.627	we can see that this tunic being worn
89.627	was elaborately decorated,
94.073	which has led many researchers to believe
96.919	this was actually a statue of a king
96.919	performing his religious functions.
102.946	When the Mosul Cultural Museum
102.946	opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,
109.041	this statue, as well as others,
111.312	were placed there to preserve them
111.312	for future generations.
116.085	Following the US-led invasion
116.085	of Iraq in 2003,
120.048	a few statues and artifacts
120.048	were relocated to Baghdad,
123.937	but this statue remained.
127.266	Then in February of last year,
127.266	a video was released,
131.05	and it instantly went viral.
133.895	Maybe some of you remember seeing it.
136.19	Here's a short clip.
137.747	(Video) (Singing in Arabic)
163.393	(Singing ends)
165.927	Not a very pleasant sight, right?
169.499	Did you notice anything
169.499	familiar in the video?
173.372	There it is.
174.899	There is that very statue,
177.595	as it was toppled over,
179.362	breaking into pieces.
181.796	When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video,
184.681	we were shocked.
186.879	Since we are archaeologists
186.879	using innovative technology
190.331	for digital preservation,
192.145	an idea sprung to mind.
194.322	Maybe we can crowdsource the images
194.322	that were taken of these artifacts
199.159	before they were destroyed,
200.998	to create digital reconstructions.
203.585	If we can do that,
204.759	maybe we can put them
204.759	into a virtual museum
206.874	to tell that story.
211.85	And so two weeks after we saw this video,
215.378	we started the project
215.378	called Project Mosul.
220.148	Remember the pictures of the statue
220.148	I showed you before?
223.291	This is actually the crowdsourced
223.291	reconstruction of it
227.692	before it was destroyed.
230.596	Now, many of you may be wondering,
232.743	how exactly does this work?
234.786	Well, the key to this technology
234.786	is called photogrammetry,
238.185	and it was invented here, in Germany.
241.71	It is the technology that allows us
241.71	to use two-dimensional images
245.14	taken of the same object
245.14	from different angles
248.113	to create a 3D model.
251.089	I know you may be thinking
251.089	this sounds like magic -- but it's not.
255.312	Let me show you how it works.
256.867	Here are two crowdsourced images
256.867	of the same statue.
260.748	What the computer can do
262.167	is it can detect similar features
262.167	between the photographs --
266.406	similar features of the object.
269.389	Then, by using multiple photos,
272.389	in this case, it can begin
272.389	to reconstruct the object in 3D.
276.635	In this case,
277.809	you have the position of the cameras
277.809	when each image was taken,
281.265	shown in blue.
284.102	Now, this is a partial
284.102	reconstruction, I admit,
287.54	but why would I say partial?
289.437	Well, simply because the statue
289.437	was positioned against a wall.
294.691	We don't have photographs
294.691	taken of it from the back.
298.159	If I wanted to complete a full
298.159	digital reconstruction of this statue,
303.135	I would need a proper camera,
304.868	tripods, proper lighting,
306.637	but we simply can't do that
306.637	with crowdsourced images.
309.969	Think about it:
311.143	How many of you, when you visit a museum,
313.4	take photographs
313.4	of all parts of the statue,
315.665	even the back side of it?
318.226	Well, maybe if some of you find
318.226	Michelangelo's David interesting,
321.847	I guess --
323.022	(Laughter)
324.988	But the thing is,
326.501	if we can find more images of this object,
329.665	we can improve the 3D model.
332.953	When we started the project,
335.151	we started it with
335.151	the Mosul Museum in mind.
337.324	We figured we may get a few images,
339.015	some people interested,
340.285	make one or two virtual reconstructions,
342.788	but we had no idea that we had sparked
342.788	something that would grow so quickly.
348.096	Before we knew it,
349.673	we realized it was obvious:
351.728	we could apply this same idea
351.728	to lost heritage anywhere.
356.379	And so, we decided to change
356.379	the name of the project to Rekrei.
361.827	Then, in the summer of last year,
364.371	"""The Economist"" magazine's media lab"
364.371	reached out to us.
368.493	They asked us,
369.691	"""Hey, would you like us"
369.691	to build a virtual museum
372.482	to put the reconstructions back inside,
374.371	"to tell the story?"""
376.018	Can you imagine us saying no?
377.812	Of course not.
379.137	We said yes!
380.312	We were so excited.
381.493	This was exactly
381.493	the initial dream of that project.
385.482	And so now,
386.693	any of you can experience
386.693	RecoVR Mosul on your phone,
390.331	using Google Cardboard
391.648	or a tablet or even YouTube 360.
394.864	Here is a screenshot
394.864	from the virtual museum.
398.344	And there it is ...
400.131	the partial reconstruction of the statue,
402.653	as well as the Lion of Mosul,
405.544	the first reconstruction
405.544	completed by our project.
409.359	Although the video doesn't explicitly show
409.359	the Lion of Mosul being destroyed,
414.173	we have many other examples
414.173	of large artifacts being destroyed
418.33	that were simply too large
418.33	to have been stolen.
421.992	For example,
423.379	the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.
426.477	This is a digital
426.477	reconstruction from before,
429.36	and this is actually
429.36	during the destruction.
433.226	Or the Lion of Al-LƒÅt, in Palmyra, Syria:
436.87	before ...
438.721	and after.
441.366	Although virtual reconstructions
441.366	are primarily the main focus
444.66	of our project,
445.866	some people have been asking the question:
448.354	Can we print them in 3D?
452.375	We believe 3D printing
452.375	doesn't offer a straightforward solution
456.656	to lost heritage.
458.158	Once an object is destroyed,
460.131	it's gone.
461.872	But 3D printing does offer
461.872	an addition to tell that story.
467.559	For example, I can show you here ...
473.48	There is the statue from Hatra
476.418	and the Lion of Mosul.
478.262	(Applause)
485.69	Thank you.
486.864	Now, if you look closely,
488.392	you'll notice that there are some parts
488.392	that have been printed in color,
492.923	and some parts that are in white or gray.
496.535	This part was added
496.535	simply to hold the statues up.
500.654	This works the same way
500.654	if you visit a museum,
503.105	and a statue is found in fragments;
505.41	it's put together
505.41	for the people to see it.
507.704	This makes sense, right?
510.341	However, we're much more interested
512.118	in what virtual reality
512.118	has to offer for lost heritage.
516.24	Here is an example
516.24	of one of the tower tombs
518.765	that was destroyed in Palmyra.
520.664	Using Sketchfab's online viewer,
522.642	we can show that we have reconstructed
522.642	three parts of the exterior of the tomb,
528.321	but we also have photos of the inside,
530.25	so we're beginning to create
530.25	a reconstruction of the wall
532.943	and the ceiling.
534.601	Archaeologists worked there
534.601	for many, many years,
537.532	so we also have architectural
537.532	drawing plans of this lost heritage.
544.159	Unfortunately, we are not only losing
544.159	cultural heritage to areas of conflict
550.565	and at war --
551.74	we're also losing it to natural disasters.
554.698	This is a 3D model
554.698	of Durbar Square in Kathmandu,
558.592	before the earthquake
558.592	that occurred last April ...
562.117	and this is after.
564.383	You may be thinking,
566.005	you didn't create these 3D models
566.005	with only tourist photographs,
569.698	and that's true.
571.113	But what this represents
572.613	is the ability for large, public
572.613	organizations and private industry
576.383	to come together
576.383	for initiatives like ours.
581.579	And so one of the major challenges
581.579	of our project, really,
584.691	is to find photographs that were taken
584.691	before something happens, right?
589.44	Well, the internet is basically a database
589.44	with millions of images, right?
595.488	Exactly.
596.863	So we have begun to develop a tool
600.322	that allows us to extract images
600.322	from websites like Flickr,
604.268	based on their geotags,
605.79	to complete reconstructions.
608.216	Because we're not only losing cultural
608.216	heritage to natural disasters and in war,
615.003	but we're also losing it
615.003	to something else.
619.597	Any idea, just looking
619.597	at these two pictures?
623.469	Maybe it's a little difficult to remember,
626.133	but only a few weeks ago,
628.577	this was the example of human
628.577	destruction by human stupidity.
633.769	Because a tourist in Lisbon
633.769	wanted to climb onto this statue
639.102	and take a selfie with it --
640.491	(Laughter)
641.516	and pulled it down with him.
643.416	So we're already finding photographs
645.429	to complete a digital
645.429	reconstruction of this.
648.794	We need to remember
650.104	that the destruction of cultural heritage
650.104	isn't a recent phenomenon.
655.484	In the 16th century,
656.826	European priests and explorers burned
656.826	thousands of Maya books in the Americas,
663.328	of which we only have a handful left.
667.264	Fast-forward to 2001,
669.019	when the Taliban blew up
669.019	the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.
673.574	You see,
675.333	cultural heritage
675.333	is about our shared global history.
680.64	It helps us connect
680.64	with our ancestors and their stories,
684.405	but we're losing pieces of it
684.405	every day to natural disasters
688.7	and in areas of conflict.
691.934	Of course, the loss of human life
691.934	is the most heartbreaking loss ...
697.562	but cultural heritage offers us a way
697.562	to preserve the memory of the people
703.422	for future generations.
706.149	We need your help to reclaim
706.149	the history that is being lost.
711.172	Will you join us?
713.219	(Applause)
