13.995	Every weekend for as long
13.995	as I can remember,
17.746	my father would get up on a Saturday,
20.597	put on a worn sweatshirt
23.163	and he'd scrape away
24.342	at the squeaky old wheel
24.342	of a house that we lived in.
27.681	I wouldn't even call it restoration;
29.493	it was a ritual, catharsis.
31.906	He would spend all year
31.906	scraping paint with this old heat gun
35.29	and a spackle knife,
36.558	and then he would repaint
36.558	where he scraped,
38.659	only to begin again the following year.
41.052	Scraping and re-scraping,
41.052	painting and repainting:
44.688	the work of an old house
44.688	is never meant to be done.
49.589	The day my father turned 52,
49.589	I got a phone call.
52.945	My mother was on the line
54.391	to tell me that doctors had found
54.391	a lump in his stomach --
58.153	terminal cancer, she told me,
60.196	and he had been given
60.196	only three weeks to live.
64.269	I immediately moved home
64.269	to Poughkeepsie, New York,
67.814	to sit with my father on death watch,
70.246	not knowing what the next days
70.246	would bring us.
73.529	To keep myself distracted,
74.92	I rolled up my sleeves,
76.698	and I went about finishing
76.698	what he could now no longer complete --
80.627	the restoration of our old home.
83.666	When that looming three-week deadline came
86.731	and then went,
87.913	he was still alive.
89.904	And at three months,
91.41	he joined me.
92.901	We gutted and repainted the interior.
95.6	At six months, the old windows
95.6	were refinished,
98.918	and at 18 months,
100.237	the rotted porch was finally replaced.
103.575	And there was my father,
105.427	standing with me outside,
105.427	admiring a day's work,
108.704	hair on his head, fully in remission,
111.727	when he turned to me and he said,
113.985	"""You know, Michael,"
115.166	"this house saved my life."""
118.967	So the following year, I decided
118.967	to go to architecture school.
124.167	(Laughter)
125.929	But there, I learned
125.929	something different about buildings.
129.073	Recognition seemed to come
130.728	to those who prioritized
130.728	novel and sculptural forms,
134.303	like ribbons, or ...
137.514	pickles?
138.697	(Laughter)
142.866	And I think this
142.866	is supposed to be a snail.
146.53	Something about this bothered me.
148.971	Why was it that the best architects,
148.971	the greatest architecture --
152.938	all beautiful and visionary
152.938	and innovative --
156.078	is also so rare,
158.273	and seems to serve so very few?
161.715	And more to the point:
163.236	With all of this creative talent,
163.236	what more could we do?
168.556	Just as I was about to start
168.556	my final exams,
170.889	I decided to take a break
170.889	from an all-nighter
174.018	and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,
177.514	a leading health activist
177.514	for the global poor.
180.534	I was surprised to hear a doctor
180.534	talking about architecture.
184.34	Buildings are making
184.34	people sicker, he said,
186.846	and for the poorest in the world,
188.663	this is causing epidemic-level problems.
191.918	In this hospital in South Africa,
193.577	patients that came in
193.577	with, say, a broken leg,
195.785	to wait in this unventilated hallway,
198.405	walked out with a multidrug-resistant
198.405	strand of tuberculosis.
203.294	Simple designs for infection control
203.294	had not been thought about,
206.942	and people had died because of it.
210.014	"""Where are the architects?"" Paul said."
213.692	If hospitals are making people sicker,
215.717	where are the architects and designers
217.645	to help us build and design
217.645	hospitals that allow us to heal?
224.486	That following summer,
226.15	I was in the back of a Land Rover
226.15	with a few classmates,
228.976	bumping over the mountainous
228.976	hillside of Rwanda.
232.964	For the next year, I'd be living in Butaro
232.964	in this old guesthouse,
236.957	which was a jail after the genocide.
240.967	I was there to design and build
240.967	a new type of hospital
244.912	with Dr. Farmer and his team.
247.965	If hallways are making patients sicker,
250.123	what if we could design a hospital
250.123	that flips the hallways on the outside,
253.901	and makes people walk in the exterior?
256.243	If mechanical systems rarely work,
258.636	what if we could design a hospital
258.636	that could breathe
261.243	through natural ventilation,
263.143	and meanwhile reduce
263.143	its environmental footprint?
266.309	And what about the patients' experience?
268.889	Evidence shows
268.889	that a simple view of nature
271.229	can radically improve health outcomes,
273.752	So why couldn't we design a hospital
275.838	where every patient
275.838	had a window with a view?
278.575	Simple, site-specific designs
278.575	can make a hospital that heals.
284.764	Designing it is one thing;
286.571	getting it built, we learned,
286.571	is quite another.
289.619	We worked with Bruce Nizeye,
292.327	a brilliant engineer,
293.864	and he thought about
293.864	construction differently
296.012	than I had been taught in school.
298.458	When we had to excavate
298.458	this enormous hilltop
300.806	and a bulldozer was expensive
300.806	and hard to get to site,
303.765	Bruce suggested doing it by hand,
306.309	"using a method in Rwanda called ""Ubudehe,"""
310.007	"which means ""community works"
310.007	"for the community."""
313.082	Hundreds of people came
313.082	with shovels and hoes,
317.008	and we excavated that hill
318.819	in half the time and half
318.819	the cost of that bulldozer.
323.328	Instead of importing furniture,
323.328	Bruce started a guild,
326.292	and he brought in
326.292	master carpenters to train others
328.723	in how to make furniture by hand.
330.501	And on this job site,
336.326	Bruce insisted that we bring on
336.326	labor from all backgrounds,
339.955	and that half of them be women.
342.302	Bruce was using
342.302	the process of building to heal,
344.971	not just for those who were sick,
346.98	but for the entire community as a whole.
351.086	We call this the locally fabricated
351.086	"way of building, or ""lo-fab,"""
355.965	and it has four pillars:
358.984	hire locally,
360.182	source regionally,
362.111	train where you can
363.555	and most importantly,
365.143	think about every design decision
365.143	as an opportunity
368.729	to invest in the dignity
368.729	of the places where you serve.
373.219	Think of it like the local food movement,
376.073	but for architecture.
377.741	And we're convinced
377.741	that this way of building
379.968	can be replicated across the world,
381.93	and change the way we talk about
381.93	and evaluate architecture.
387.405	Using the lo-fab way of building,
389.231	even aesthetic decisions
389.231	can be designed to impact people's lives.
393.762	In Butaro, we chose to use
393.762	a local volcanic stone
396.488	found in abundance within the area,
398.54	but often considered
398.54	a nuisance by farmers,
400.601	and piled on the side of the road.
402.671	We worked with these masons
402.671	to cut these stones
405.179	and form them into the walls
405.179	of the hospital.
408.394	And when they began on this corner
410.615	and wrapped around the entire hospital,
414.283	they were so good at putting
414.283	these stones together,
416.829	they asked us if they could take down
416.829	the original wall and rebuild it.
420.465	And you see what is possible.
423.467	It's beautiful.
425.794	And the beauty, to me,
427.697	comes from the fact that I know
427.697	that hands cut these stones,
431.435	and they formed them into this thick wall,
434.444	made only in this place
434.444	with rocks from this soil.
440.107	When you go outside today
440.107	and you look at your built world,
444.973	ask not only:
446.178	"""What is the environmental footprint?"" --"
446.178	an important question --
449.428	but what if we also asked,
450.726	"""What is the human handprint"
450.726	"of those who made it?"""
455.427	We started a new practice
455.427	based around these questions,
459.095	and we tested it around the world.
462.467	Like in Haiti,
463.642	where we asked if a new hospital
463.642	could help end the epidemic of cholera.
468.755	In this 100-bed hospital,
470.418	we designed a simple strategy
472.117	to clean contaminated medical waste
472.117	before it enters the water table,
476.601	and our partners at Les Centres GHESKIO
478.633	are already saving lives because of it.
481.187	Or Malawi:
482.406	we asked if a birthing center
482.406	could radically reduce
485.659	maternal and infant mortality.
487.892	Malawi has one of the highest rates
487.892	of maternal and infant death
491.169	in the world.
492.41	Using a simple strategy
492.41	to be replicated nationally,
495.757	we designed a birthing center
498.001	that would attract women
498.001	and their attendants
500.333	to come to the hospital earlier
500.333	and therefore have safer births.
504.569	Or in the Congo, where we asked
506.267	if an educational center
506.267	could also be used
508.539	to protect endangered wildlife.
510.745	Poaching for ivory and bushmeat
512.354	is leading to global epidemic,
512.354	disease transfer and war.
515.925	In one of the hardest-to-reach
515.925	places in the world,
519.171	we used the mud and the dirt
519.171	and the wood around us
522.121	to construct a center
523.809	that would show us ways to protect
523.809	and conserve our rich biodiversity.
529.526	Even here in the US,
531.155	we were asked to rethink
532.442	the largest university for the deaf
532.442	and hard of hearing in the world.
536.844	The deaf community, through sign language,
539.124	shows us the power
539.124	of visual communication.
541.558	We designed a campus
541.558	that would awaken the ways
543.834	in which we as humans all communicate,
545.907	both verbally and nonverbally.
549.729	And even in Poughkeepsie, my hometown,
552.986	we thought about old
552.986	industrial infrastructure.
556.196	We wondered:
557.497	Could we use arts and culture
557.497	and design to revitalize this city
562.084	and other Rust Belt cities
562.084	across our nation,
564.73	and turn them into centers
564.73	for innovation and growth?
568.121	In each of these projects,
568.121	we asked a simple question:
572.045	What more can architecture do?
574.681	And by asking that question,
576.63	we were forced to consider
576.63	how we could create jobs,
580.396	how we could source regionally
582.831	and how we could invest
582.831	in the dignity of the communities
586.081	in which we serve.
587.959	I have learned
589.943	that architecture can be
589.943	a transformative engine for change.
597.117	About a year ago, I read an article
600.567	about a tireless and intrepid
600.567	civil rights leader
605.328	named Bryan Stevenson.
608.423	(Applause)
614.249	And Bryan had a bold architectural vision.
617.983	He and his team had been documenting
620.596	the over 4,000 lynchings
620.596	of African-Americans
624.264	that have happened in the American South.
626.889	And they had a plan to mark every county
626.889	where these lynchings occurred,
631.723	and build a national memorial
631.723	to the victims of lynching
635.136	in Montgomery, Alabama.
637.879	Countries like Germany and South Africa
641.88	and, of course, Rwanda,
643.073	have found it necessary to build memorials
646.169	to reflect on the atrocities
646.169	of their past,
649.032	in order to heal their national psyche.
652.044	We have yet to do this
652.044	in the United States.
656.679	So I sent a cold email
656.679	to info@equaljusticeintiative.org:
663.338	"""Dear Bryan,"" it said,"
666.102	"""I think your building project"
667.762	is maybe the most important
667.762	project we could do in America
670.741	and could change the way
670.741	we think about racial injustice.
674.64	By any chance,
676.648	"do you know who will design it?"""
678.593	(Laughter)
680.784	Surprisingly, shockingly,
683.547	Bryan got right back to me,
684.885	and invited me down to meet
684.885	with his team and talk to them.
688.763	Needless to say,
688.763	I canceled all my meetings
690.839	and I jumped on a plane
690.839	to Montgomery, Alabama.
693.203	When I got there,
694.797	Bryan and his team picked me up,
694.797	and we walked around the city.
698.305	And they took the time to point out
700.656	the many markers that have
700.656	been placed all over the city
703.701	to the history of the Confederacy,
706.169	and the very few that mark
706.169	the history of slavery.
710.42	And then he walked me to a hill.
712.828	It overlooked the whole city.
714.934	He pointed out the river
714.934	and the train tracks
717.188	where the largest domestic
717.188	slave-trading port in America
719.907	had once prospered.
721.115	And then to the Capitol rotunda,
722.757	where George Wallace
722.757	had stood on its steps
724.853	"and proclaimed, ""Segregation forever."""
728.205	And then to the very hill below us.
730.08	"He said, ""Here we will build"
730.08	a new memorial
733.421	that will change the identity
733.421	"of this city and of this nation."""
738.855	Our two teams have worked
738.855	together over the last year
742.333	to design this memorial.
747.184	The memorial will take us on a journey
750.836	through a classical,
750.836	almost familiar building type,
753.934	like the Parthenon
753.934	or the colonnade at the Vatican.
758.994	But as we enter,
760.345	the ground drops below us
760.345	and our perception shifts,
764.33	where we realize that these columns
764.33	evoke the lynchings,
768.448	which happened in the public square.
771.005	And as we continue,
772.345	we begin to understand the vast number
775.464	of those who have yet to be put to rest.
778.481	Their names will be engraved
778.481	on the markers that hang above us.
784.202	And just outside will be a field
784.202	of identical columns.
788.973	But these are temporary columns,
788.973	waiting in purgatory,
792.796	to be placed in the very counties
792.796	where these lynchings occurred.
798.124	Over the next few years,
800.52	this site will bear witness,
803.06	as each of these markers is claimed
805.322	and visibly placed in those counties.
808.258	Our nation will begin to heal
808.258	from over a century of silence.
815.799	When we think about
815.799	how it should be built,
817.876	we were reminded of Ubudehe,
820.7	the building process
820.7	we learned about in Rwanda.
823.562	We wondered if we could fill
823.562	those very columns
826.13	with the soil from the sites
826.13	of where these killings occurred.
831.218	Brian and his team have begun
831.218	collecting that soil
834.94	and preserving it in individual jars
837.748	with family members, community
837.748	leaders and descendants.
841.89	The act of collecting soil itself
846.148	has lead to a type of spiritual healing.
849.545	It's an act of restorative justice.
852.844	As one EJI team member noted
855.422	in the collection of the soil
855.422	from where Will McBride was lynched,
860.231	"""If Will McBride left one drop of sweat,"
863.388	one drop of blood,
865.173	one hair follicle --
866.964	I pray that I dug it up,
868.609	and that his whole body
868.609	"would be at peace."""
874.683	We plan to break ground
874.683	on this memorial later this year,
877.968	and it will be a place to finally speak
877.968	of the unspeakable acts
882.437	that have scarred this nation.
886.38	(Applause)
897.245	When my father told me
897.245	that day that this house --
900.706	our house --
901.885	had saved his life,
903.97	what I didn't know
905.306	was that he was referring
905.306	to a much deeper relationship
908.582	between architecture and ourselves.
911.649	Buildings are not simply
911.649	expressive sculptures.
915.019	They make visible our personal
915.019	and our collective aspirations
919.141	as a society.
921.177	Great architecture can give us hope.
925.162	Great architecture can heal.
928.478	Thank you very much.
929.719	(Applause)
