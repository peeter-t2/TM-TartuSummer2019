12.574	Africa is booming.
14.361	Per capita incomes since the year 2000
16.866	have doubled,
18.466	and this boom is impacting on everyone.
21.841	Life expectancy has increased by one year
24.667	every three years for the last decade.
27.417	That means if an African child is born today,
30.902	rather than three days ago,
32.69	they will get an extra day of life
34.577	at the end of their lifespan.
36.6	It's that quick.
38.391	And HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:
46.753	in sub-Saharan Africa.
49.217	The battle against malaria is being won,
52.279	with deaths from malaria down 27 percent,
55.079	according to the latest World Bank data.
56.841	And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.
59.938	This shouldn't surprise us,
62.11	because actually, everybody grows.
64.859	If you go back to Imperial Rome
66.835	in the Year 1 A.D.,
69.04	there was admittedly about 1,800 years
71.338	where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.
73.585	But then the people that the Romans
75.577	would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,
79.392	were actually part of the Industrial Revolution,
81.512	and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,
84.2	and you saw that get quicker and quicker,
87.24	and it's been impacting everyone.
90	It doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore
92.615	or the tundra of northern Finland.
94.865	Everybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when
97.786	the inevitable happens.
100.12	Among the reasons I think it's happening right now
102.741	is the quality of the leadership across Africa.
106.223	I think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,
109.541	the greatest politician in the world was African,
113.237	but I'm meeting brilliant people
115.848	across the continent the entire time,
117.712	and they're doing the reforms
119.28	which have transformed the economic situation
121.792	for their countries.
123.573	And the West is engaging with that.
125.675	The West has given debt forgiveness programs
127.994	which have halved sub-Saharan debt
130.497	from about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.
134.215	At the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120
136.904	and we're all feeling slightly miserable
138.992	as a result.
140.325	Politics gets weaker when debt is high.
143.44	When public sector debt is low,
145.403	governments don't have to choose
146.875	between investing in education and health
149.357	and paying interest on that debt you owe.
151.632	And it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.
154.854	The private sector as well.
156.711	Again, in the West, we have private sector debt
159.872	of 200 percent of GDP in Spain,
162.127	the U.K., and the U.S.
164.418	That's an awful lot of debt.
166.493	Africa, many African countries,
169.084	are sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.
172.57	If there's any continent that can do what China has done --
176.122	China's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart --
179.539	if anyone can do what China has done
181.687	in the last 30 years,
183.816	it'll be Africa in the next 30.
186.41	So they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.
189.132	Does anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.
191.716	Foreign direct investment
193.53	has poured into Africa in the last 15 years.
197.208	Back in the '70s,
199.26	no one touched the continent with a barge pole.
202.257	And this investment is actually Western-led.
204.528	We hear a lot about China,
206.369	and they do lend a lot of money,
208.689	but 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years
211.264	has come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.
214.33	Ten percent's come from India.
216.936	And they're investing in energy.
219.166	Africa produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.
222.416	It's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.
225.72	And they're investing in telecoms,
227.791	shopping malls.
229.796	And this very encouraging story, I think,
233.038	is partly demographic-led.
234.913	And it's not just about African demographics.
238.25	I'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds
241.225	in various parts of the world,
243.507	and the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.
246.898	Ten years ago, say you're Foxconn
249.353	setting up an iPhone factory, by chance.
252.068	You might choose China,
253.688	which is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,
255.89	where there's 200 million young people,
257.834	and every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.
262.679	Which means you're going to have new guys
264.983	"knocking on the door saying, ""Give us a job,"""
267.345	"and, ""I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."""
270.58	Now, that's completely changed now.
273.168	This decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent
276.312	fall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.
280.423	So where do you set up your new factory?
283.624	You look at South Asia, and people are.
285.411	They're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,
287.466	and they're also looking at Africa.
289.857	And they're looking at Africa
291.648	because that yellow line is showing you
294.162	that the number of young Africans
295.822	is going to continue to get bigger
297.413	decade after decade after decade out to 2050.
302.832	Now, there's a problem with lots of young people
305.696	coming into any market,
307.646	particularly when they're young men.
309.19	A bit dangerous, sometimes.
311.516	I think one of the crucial factors
313.474	is how educated is that demographic?
316.895	If you look at the red line here,
318.827	what you're going to see is that in 1975,
320.503	just nine percent of kids
322.592	were in secondary school education
324.992	in sub-Saharan Africa.
327.65	Would you set up a factory
329.417	in sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?
331.307	Nobody else did.
332.627	They chose instead Turkey and Mexico
335.28	to set up the textiles factories,
337.776	because their education levels
339.234	were 25 to 30 percent.
342.135	Today, sub-Sahara is at the levels
345.596	that Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.
349.332	They will get the textiles jobs
352.511	that will take people out of rural poverty
355.191	and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.
359.855	So what's Africa looking like today?
362.914	This is how I look at Africa.
364.575	It's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.
366.399	Each little box is about a billion dollars,
368.31	and you see that I pay an awful lot of attention
370.027	to Nigeria sitting there in the middle.
372.319	South Africa is playing a role.
374.484	But when I'm thinking about the future,
376.563	I'm actually most interested
379.114	in Central, Western and Southern Africa.
381.879	If I look at Africa by population,
384.441	East Africa stands out
385.81	as so much potential.
387.794	And I'm showing you something else with these maps.
390.826	I'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.
393.568	Fragile democracies is the beige color.
396.821	Strong democracies are the orange color.
399.464	And what you'll see here is that most Africans
402.194	are now living in democracies.
406.013	Why does that matter?
408.189	Because what people want
410.623	is what politicians try,
412.758	they don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.
415.849	And what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.
418.496	In Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,
421.372	the battle between the two candidates
423.602	was over education.
426.875	One guy offered free secondary school education
428.868	to all, not just 30 percent.
431.216	The other guy had to say,
432.535	I'm going to build 50 new schools.
434.662	He won by a margin.
437.521	So democracy is encouraging governments
440.571	to invest in education.
442.171	Education is helping growth and investment,
444.256	and that's giving budget revenues,
445.668	which is giving governments more money,
447.507	which is helping growth through education.
450.713	It's a positive, virtuous circle.
453.248	But I get asked this question,
455.809	and this particular question makes me quite sad:
458.895	"It's, ""But what about corruption?"
461.426	"How can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"""
465.53	And what makes me sad about it
467.171	is that this graph here is showing you
469.196	that the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.
473.161	When you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.
477.707	And the countries on the right hand side,
479.82	you'll see the per capita GDP,
481.543	basically every country
483.368	with a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,
486.863	has got a corruption score
489.083	of roughly, what's that, about three?
492.118	Three out of 10. That's not good.
494.401	Every poor country is corrupt.
496.765	Every rich country is relatively uncorrupt.
500.891	How do you get from poverty and corruption
504.894	to wealth and less corruption?
507.163	You see the middle class grow.
509.355	And the way to do that is to invest,
512.842	not to say I'm not investing in that continent
516.222	because there's too much corruption.
518.499	Now, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.
521.176	I've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe --
524.115	not in Africa, actually.
526.227	But what I'm saying here is that
527.925	we can make a difference
529.715	and we can do that by investing.
532.621	Now I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.
536.128	Economists aren't great at forecasting.
538.995	Because the question really is, what happens next?
541.107	And if you go back to the year 2000,
543.631	what you'll find is The Economist
545.394	"had a very famous cover, ""The Hopeless Continent,"""
548.562	and what they'd done is they'd looked at growth
550.744	in Africa over the previous 10 years -- two percent --
554.874	and they said,
556.978	what's going to happen in the next 10 years?
559.511	They assumed two percent,
561.89	and that made it a pretty hopeless story,
563.783	because population growth was two and a half.
566.933	People got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.
569.713	Now 2012, The Economist has a new cover,
573.151	and what does that new cover show?
574.997	That new cover shows, well, Africa rising,
577.98	because the growth over the last 10 years
579.707	has been about five and a half percent.
582.327	I would like to see if you can all now become economists,
585.853	because if growth for the last 10 years
588.368	has been five and a half percent,
590.488	what do you think the IMF is forecasting
592.191	for the next five years of growth in Africa?
595.211	Very good. I think you're secretly saying
597.986	to your head, probably five and a half percent.
600.168	You're all economists, and I think,
602.11	like most economists, wrong.
604.592	No offense.
606.688	What I like to do is try and find the countries
609.569	that are doing exactly what Africa has already done,
613.73	and it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing
617.128	to whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.
620.175	India is one of those examples.
622.829	This is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.
626.948	Ignore the scale on the bottom for a second.
629.862	Actually, for the first 20 years,
632.232	the '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.
635.275	It grew at two percent
637.336	when population growth was about two and a half.
640.416	If that's familiar, that's exactly what happened
642.596	in sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.
644.891	And then something happened in 1980.
646.665	Boom! India began to explode.
648.888	"It wasn't a ""Hindu rate of growth,"""
651.172	"""democracies can't grow."" Actually India could."
654.228	And if I lay sub-Saharan growth
657.034	on top of the Indian growth story,
659.302	it's remarkably similar.
661.918	Twenty years of not much growth
664.205	and a trend line which is actually telling you
665.759	that sub-Saharan African growth is
667.749	slightly better than India.
670.31	And if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,
673.745	I'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,
676.569	I'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,
680.675	I can draw out some forecasts
682.852	for the next 30 to 40 years
685.172	which I think are better
687.242	than the ones where you're looking backwards.
690.094	And that tells me this:
692.441	that Africa is going to go
694.223	from a $2 trillion economy today
697.26	to a $29 trillion economy by 2050.
701.532	Now that's bigger than Europe and America
703.54	put together in today's money.
706.998	Life expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.
710.918	The population's going to double
712.656	from one billion to two billion,
714.109	so household incomes are going to go up sevenfold
717.459	in the next 35 years.
720.323	And when I present this in Africa --
723.44	Nairobi, Lagos, Accra -- I get one question.
727.244	"""Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"""
732.112	And you know what?
733.955	Actually, I think they've got a point.
736.344	Am I really saying that there can be nothing learned,
738.816	yes from the positives in Asia and India,
742.1	but also the negatives?
743.478	Perhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.
746.04	Surely, the technologies that we're talking about here
749.435	this last week,
751.044	surely some of these can perhaps
752.988	help Africa grow even faster?
755.716	And I think here we can play a role.
758.151	Because technology does let you help.
760.994	You can go and download
763.133	some of the great African literature
765.168	from the Internet now.
766.967	No, not right now, just 30 seconds.
769.44	You can go and buy some of the great tunes.
771.63	My iPod's full of them.
773.361	Buy African products.
775.051	Go on holiday and see for yourself
777.016	the change that's happening.
778.565	Invest.
779.97	Perhaps hire people, give them the skills
782.096	that they can take back to Africa,
784.365	and their companies will grow an awful lot faster
786.63	than most of ours here in the West.
789.28	And then you and I can help make sure
793.581	that for Africa, the 21st century is their century.
797.71	Thank you very much.
799.52	(Applause)
