12.825	Have you heard the news?
14.488	We're in a clean energy revolution.
17.462	And where I live in Berkeley, California,
19.476	it seems like every day I see a new roof
19.476	with new solar panels going up,
23.784	electric car in the driveway.
25.812	Germany sometimes gets
25.812	half its power from solar,
29.051	and India is now committed
29.051	to building 10 times more solar
33.568	than we have in California,
34.92	by the year 2022.
36.896	Even nuclear seems to be
36.896	making a comeback.
39.874	Bill Gates is in China
39.874	working with engineers,
42.943	there's 40 different companies
42.943	that are working together
45.764	to try to race to build the first
45.764	reactor that runs on waste,
49.113	that can't melt down
50.374	and is cheaper than coal.
52.492	And so you might start to ask:
55.43	Is this whole global warming problem
57.251	going to be a lot easier to solve
57.251	than anybody imagined?
60.504	That was the question we wanted to know,
62.479	so my colleagues and I decided
62.479	to take a deep dive into the data.
65.745	We were a little skeptical of some parts
67.796	of the clean energy revolution story,
69.827	but what we found really surprised us.
72.611	The first thing is that clean
72.611	energy has been increasing.
76.545	This is electricity from clean energy
76.545	sources over the last 20 years.
81.023	But when you look at
81.023	the percentage of global electricity
84.765	from clean energy sources,
86.128	it's actually been in decline
86.128	from 36 percent to 31 percent.
90.718	And if you care about climate change,
92.924	you've got to go in the opposite direction
95.094	to 100 percent of our electricity
95.094	from clean energy sources,
98.668	as quickly as possible.
100.29	Now, you might wonder,
101.471	"""Come on, how much could five percentage"
101.471	"points of global electricity be?"""
105.364	Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.
107.155	It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants
110.322	the size of Diablo Canyon,
110.322	California's last nuclear plant,
113.957	or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,
117.65	which is one of the biggest
117.65	solar farms in the world,
120.203	and certainly our biggest in California.
123.587	A big part of this is simply
123.587	that fossil fuels are increasing
126.855	faster than clean energy.
128.132	And that's understandable.
129.395	There's just a lot of poor countries
131.134	that are still using wood
131.134	and dung and charcoal
133.611	as their main source of energy,
135.22	and they need modern fuels.
136.695	But there's something else going on,
138.668	which is that one of those clean energy
138.668	sources in particular
142.747	has actually been on the decline
142.747	in absolute terms,
146.179	not just relatively.
147.704	And that's nuclear.
148.942	You can see its generation
148.942	has declined seven percent
152.615	over the last 10 years.
154.476	Now, solar and wind have been
154.476	making huge strides,
157.108	so you hear a lot of talk
157.108	about how it doesn't really matter,
160.04	because solar and wind
160.04	is going to make up the difference.
162.802	But the data says something different.
164.682	When you combine all the electricity
164.682	from solar and wind,
167.751	you see it actually barely makes up
167.751	half of the decline from nuclear.
173.758	Let's take a closer look
173.758	in the United States.
176.1	Over the last couple of years --
176.1	really 2013, 2014 --
179.915	we prematurely retired
179.915	four nuclear power plants.
183.408	They were almost entirely
183.408	replaced with fossil fuels,
186.231	and so the consequence
186.231	was that we wiped out
189.761	almost as much clean energy
189.761	electricity that we get from solar.
194.711	And it's not unique to us.
198.113	People think of California
198.113	as a clean energy and climate leader,
201.208	but when we looked at the data,
203.24	what we found is that, in fact,
204.765	California reduced emissions more slowly
204.765	than the national average,
207.992	between 2000 and 2015.
210.359	What about Germany?
211.618	They're doing a lot of clean energy.
213.675	But when you look at the data,
215.43	German emissions have actually
215.43	been going up since 2009,
218.732	and there's really not anybody
218.732	who's going to tell you
221.331	that they're going to meet
221.331	their climate commitments in 2020.
225.137	The reason isn't hard to understand.
226.913	Solar and wind provide power
226.913	about 10 to 20 percent of the time,
230.24	which means that when
230.24	the sun's not shining,
232.312	the wind's not blowing,
233.688	you still need power for your hospitals,
235.863	your homes, your cities, your factories.
238.617	And while batteries have made
238.617	some really cool improvements lately,
242.545	the truth is, they're just never
242.545	going to be as efficient
245.277	as the electrical grid.
246.5	Every time you put electricity
246.5	into a battery and take it out,
249.651	you lose about 20 to 40
249.651	percent of the power.
253.47	That's why when, in California,
256.087	we try to deal with all the solar
256.087	we've brought online --
258.825	we now get about 10 percent
258.825	of electricity from solar --
261.613	when the sun goes down,
261.613	and people come home from work
264.279	and turn on their air conditioners
264.279	and their TV sets,
266.793	and every other appliance in the house,
268.715	we need a lot of natural gas backup.
271.2	So what we've been doing
272.389	is stuffing a lot of natural gas
272.389	into the side of a mountain.
275.616	And that worked pretty well for a while,
277.889	but then late last year,
277.889	it sprung a leak.
280.904	This is Aliso Canyon.
282.768	So much methane gas was released,
285.806	it was the equivalent of putting
285.806	half a million cars on the road.
289.016	It basically blew through all
289.016	of our climate commitments for the year.
293.681	Well, what about India?
295.029	Sometimes you have to go places
295.029	to really get the right data,
298.304	so we traveled to India a few months ago.
300.309	We met with all the top officials --
300.309	solar, nuclear, the rest --
303.464	and what they told us is,
305.029	"""We're actually having"
305.029	more serious problems
307.107	than both Germany and California.
308.806	We don't have backup;
308.806	we don't have all the natural gas.
312.363	And that's just the start of it.
314.919	Say we want to get
314.919	to 100 gigawatts by 2022.
317.832	But last year we did just five,
319.808	"and the year before that, we did five."""
321.87	So, let's just take
321.87	a closer look at nuclear.
324.77	The United Nations Intergovernmental
324.77	Panel on Climate Change
328.017	has looked at the carbon content
328.017	of all these different fuels,
331.012	and nuclear comes out really low --
331.012	it's actually lower even than solar.
334.969	And nuclear obviously
334.969	provides a lot of power --
341.465	During a year, a single plant can provide
341.465	power 92 percent of the time.
345.423	What's interesting is that
345.423	when you look at countries
348.019	that have deployed different
348.019	kinds of clean energies,
350.585	there's only a few that have done so
352.509	at a pace consistent with dealing
352.509	with the climate crisis.
355.388	So nuclear seems like
355.388	a pretty good option,
357.463	but there's this big problem with it,
359.525	which all of you, I'm sure, are aware of,
361.579	which is that people really don't like it.
364.431	There was a study, a survey done
364.431	of people around the world,
367.646	not just in the United States or Europe,
370.173	about a year and a half ago.
371.728	And what they found
373.086	is that nuclear is actually one
373.086	of the least popular forms of energy.
376.902	Even oil is more popular than nuclear.
379.356	And while nuclear kind of
379.356	edges out coal, the thing is,
382.546	people don't really fear coal
382.546	in the same way they fear nuclear,
386.387	which really operates on our unconscious.
388.828	So what is it that we fear?
390.487	There's really three things.
392.061	There's the safety
392.061	of the plants themselves --
394.325	the fears that they're going
394.325	to melt down and cause damage;
397.154	there's the waste from them;
398.523	and there's the association with weapons.
401.562	And I think, understandably,
403.022	engineers look at those concerns
403.022	and look for technological fixes.
407.088	That's why Bill Gates is in China
407.088	developing advanced reactors.
410.095	That's why 40 different entrepreneurs
410.095	are working on this problem.
413.243	And I, myself, have been
413.243	very excited about it.
415.498	We did a report:
415.498	"""How to Make Nuclear Cheap."""
417.664	In particular, the thorium reactor
417.664	shows a lot of promise.
420.586	So when the climate
420.586	scientist, James Hansen,
422.714	asked if I wanted to go to China with him
425.007	and look at the Chinese
425.007	advanced nuclear program,
427.415	I jumped at the chance.
428.689	We were there with MIT
428.689	and UC Berkeley engineers.
431.904	And I had in my mind
433.604	that the Chinese would be able
433.604	to do with nuclear
435.94	what they did with so many other things --
438.011	start to crank out small nuclear
438.011	reactors on assembly lines,
441.964	ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks
441.964	and send them around the world.
446.376	I would get one at home in Berkeley.
449.12	But what I found was somewhat different.
451.105	The presentations were all
451.105	very exciting and very promising;
454.033	they have multiple reactors
454.033	that they're working on.
456.543	The time came for the thorium reactor,
456.543	and a bunch of us were excited.
459.872	They went through the whole presentation,
459.872	they got to the timeline,
463.295	and they said,
464.576	"""We're going to have"
464.576	a thorium molten salt reactor
468.118	ready for sale to the world
470.307	"by 2040."""
472.85	"And I was like, ""What?"""
474.487	(Laughter)
475.526	I looked at my colleagues and I was like,
477.558	"""Excuse me --"
479.05	can you guys speed that up a little bit?
481.404	Because we're in a little bit
481.404	of a climate crisis right now.
484.502	And your cities are really
484.502	"polluted, by the way."""
487.252	And they responded back, they were like,
489.594	"""I'm not sure what you've heard"
489.594	about our thorium program,
492.398	but we don't have a third of our budget,
494.337	and your department of energy
494.337	hasn't been particularly forthcoming
497.473	with all that data you guys
497.473	"have on testing reactors."""
501.382	"And I said, ""Well, I've got an idea."
503.764	You know how you've got 10 years
503.764	where you're demonstrating that reactor?
507.384	Let's just skip that part,
508.98	and let's just go right
508.98	to commercializing it.
511.354	"That will save money and time."""
513.379	And the engineer just
513.379	looked at me and said,
515.995	"""Let me ask you a question:"
517.645	Would you buy a car that had never
517.645	"been demonstrated before?"""
521.913	So what about the other reactors?
523.534	There's a reactor that's coming online
523.534	now, they're starting to sell it.
527.01	It's a high-temperature gas reactor.
528.82	It can't melt down.
530.845	But it's really big and bulky,
530.845	that's part of the safety,
533.604	and nobody thinks
533.604	it's going to ever get cheaper
535.916	than the reactors that we have.
537.88	The ones that use waste as fuel
537.88	are really cool ideas, but the truth is,
541.98	we don't actually know how to do that yet.
544.052	There's some risk that you'll
544.052	actually make more waste,
546.671	and most people think
546.671	that if you're including
549.489	that waste part of the process,
551.595	it's just going to make the whole
551.595	machine a lot more expensive,
554.586	it's just adding another complicated step.
557.765	The truth is,
559.695	there's real questions about how much
559.695	of that we're going to do.
562.869	I mean, we went to India and asked
562.869	about the nuclear program.
565.779	The government said
565.779	before the Paris climate talks
568.201	that they were going to do something
568.201	like 30 new nuclear plants.
571.281	But when we got there
571.281	and interviewed people
573.376	and even looked at the internal documents,
575.481	they're now saying
575.481	they're going to do about five.
577.957	And in most of the world,
577.957	especially the rich world,
580.527	they're not talking
580.527	about building new reactors.
582.837	We're actually talking
582.837	about taking reactors down
585.149	before their lifetimes are over.
586.839	Germany's actually pressuring
586.839	its neighbors to do that.
589.651	I mentioned the United States --
591.482	we could lose half of our reactors
591.482	over the next 15 years,
595.849	which would wipe out 40 percent
595.849	of the emissions reductions
598.69	we're supposed to get
598.69	under the Clean Power Plan.
601.058	Of course, in Japan, they took
601.058	all their nuclear plants offline,
604.149	replaced them with coal,
604.149	natural gas, oil burning,
606.526	and they're only expected to bring
606.526	online about a third to two-thirds.
610.112	So when we went through the numbers,
612.681	and just added that up --
614.028	how much nuclear do we see
614.028	China and India bringing online
617.173	over the next 15 years,
619.159	how much do we see at risk
619.159	of being taken offline --
622.739	this was the most startling finding.
625.052	What we found is that
625.052	the world is actually at risk
628.567	of losing four times more clean energy
628.567	than we lost over the last 10 years.
634.055	In other words: we're not
634.055	in a clean energy revolution;
637.429	we're in a clean energy crisis.
640.992	So it's understandable that engineers
640.992	would look for a technical fix
645.188	to the fears that people have of nuclear.
647.166	But when you consider
647.166	that these are big challenges to do,
649.966	that they're going to take
649.966	a long time to solve,
652.275	there's this other issue, which is:
654.045	Are those technical fixes
654.045	really going to solve people's fears?
657.828	Let's take safety.
659.41	You know, despite what people think,
661.919	it's hard to figure out how
661.919	to make nuclear power much safer.
665.076	I mean, every medical
665.076	journal that looks at it --
667.418	this is the most recent study
667.418	"from the British journal, ""Lancet,"""
670.55	one of the most respected
670.55	journals in the world --
673.027	nuclear is the safest way
673.027	to make reliable power.
675.57	Everybody's scared of the accidents.
677.375	So you go look at the accident data --
679.693	Fukushima, Chernobyl --
681.212	the World Health Organization
681.212	finds the same thing:
683.939	the vast majority of harm
683.939	is caused by people panicking,
687.938	and they're panicking
687.938	because they're afraid.
690.282	In other words,
691.531	the harm that's caused
691.531	isn't actually caused by the machines
695.088	or the radiation.
696.493	It's caused by our fears.
698.573	And what about the waste?
700.042	Everyone worries about the waste.
701.658	Well, the interesting
701.658	thing about the waste
703.865	is how little of it there is.
705.308	This is just from one plant.
706.709	If you take all the nuclear waste
706.709	we've ever made in the United States,
710.11	put it on a football field, stacked it up,
712.333	it would only reach 20 feet high.
714.58	And people say it's poisoning
714.58	people or doing something --
717.878	it's not, it's just sitting
717.878	there, it's just being monitored.
720.801	There's not very much of it.
722.212	By contrast, the waste that we don't
722.212	control from energy production --
726.059	"we call it ""pollution,"" and it kills"
726.059	seven million people a year,
729.207	and it's threatening very serious
729.207	levels of global warming.
732.06	And the truth is that even if we get
732.06	good at using that waste as fuel,
736.036	there's always going to be
736.036	some fuel left over.
738.335	That means there's always going to be
738.335	people that think it's a big problem
742.23	for reasons that maybe don't have
742.23	as much to do with the actual waste
745.558	as we think.
746.851	Well, what about the weapons?
749.052	Maybe the most surprising thing
749.052	is that we can't find any examples
752.369	of countries that have nuclear power
754.346	"and then, ""Oh!"" decide to go get a weapon."
756.798	In fact, it works the opposite.
758.524	What we find is the only way we know
760.714	how to get rid large numbers
760.714	of nuclear weapons
763.19	is by using the plutonium in the warheads
766.014	as fuel in our nuclear power plants.
768.49	And so, if you are wanting to get
768.49	the world rid of nuclear weapons,
772.428	then we're going to need
772.428	a lot more nuclear power.
775.955	(Applause)
781.515	As I was leaving China,
782.905	the engineer that brought Bill Gates there
782.905	kind of pulled me aside,
786.118	"and he said, ""You know, Michael,"
786.118	I appreciate your interest
788.923	in all the different nuclear
788.923	supply technologies,
791.654	but there's this more basic issue,
794.6	which is that there's just not
794.6	enough global demand.
797.163	I mean, we can crank out
797.163	these machines on assembly lines,
800.112	we do know how to make things cheap,
801.88	but there's just not enough
801.88	"people that want them."""
804.302	And so, let's do solar and wind
804.302	and efficiency and conservation.
809.268	Let's accelerate the advanced
809.268	nuclear programs.
811.576	I think we should triple the amount
811.576	of money we're spending on it.
815.054	But I just think the most important thing,
817.467	if we're going to overcome
817.467	the climate crisis,
819.647	is to keep in mind that the cause
819.647	of the clean energy crisis
824.922	isn't from within our machines,
827.205	it's from within ourselves.
829.557	Thank you very much.
