25	It is a thrill to be here at a conference
29	"that's devoted to ""Inspired by Nature"" -- you can imagine."
34	And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.
38	Did you notice this section is foreplay?
40	Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,
43	which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived
46	until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.
50	I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,
53	which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,
57	and my partner and I have a rowing shell.
59	And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.
65	And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,
70	the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.
75	They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast
79	that they literally lift up out of the water,
82	and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.
86	And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
91	And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.
95	And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,
102	and started to run along the water next to us,
106	in a courtship dance -- for miles.
111	It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.
115	Now that is foreplay.
117	(Laughter)
120	I came this close to changing species at that moment.
129	Obviously, life can teach us something
133	in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.
137	But what I'd like to talk about today
140	is what life might teach us in technology and in design.
144	What's happened since the book came out --
146	the book was mainly about research in biomimicry --
149	and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers --
153	people who make our world -- have started to call and say,
156	we want a biologist to sit at the design table
160	to help us, in real time, become inspired.
163	Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out
167	into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge
169	and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.
174	So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took
178	with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.
182	And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.
185	What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.
190	We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,
195	well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.
199	That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:
203	using an organism to do your wastewater treatment
208	"is an old, old technology called ""domestication."""
211	This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.
218	And so they still weren't getting it.
221	So we went for a walk on the beach and I said,
223	well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,
228	sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.
231	And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
237	And they said, you know what happens is, mineral --
239	just like at your house -- mineral builds up.
241	And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,
245	or we have to dig them up.
247	So if we had some way to stop this scaling --
250	and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,
255	what is scaling? What's inside your pipes?
257	And they said, calcium carbonate.
260	And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.
263	And they didn't know that.
266	They didn't know that what a seashell is,
268	it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater
272	crystallize in place to create a shell.
275	So the same sort of a process, without the proteins,
279	is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.
282	This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.
288	You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know
291	that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it
294	and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization
298	that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly --
303	then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?
308	Why don't they just keep on going?
310	And I said, well, in the same way
314	that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization --
318	and then they all sort of leaned in --
322	they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
325	It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.
327	And, in fact, there is a product called TPA
331	that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein --
336	and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.
340	That changed everything. From then on,
344	you could not get these engineers back in the boat.
348	The first day they would take a hike,
351	and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.
354	We're done. You know, I've seen that island.
358	After this,
360	they were crawling all over. They would snorkel
363	for as long as we would let them snorkel.
368	What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms
372	out there that had already solved the problems
376	that they had spent their careers trying to solve.
379	Learning about the natural world is one thing;
384	learning from the natural world -- that's the switch.
386	That's the profound switch.
389	What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;
393	they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.
397	3.8 billion years of field-testing.
404	I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.
408	The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.
416	And the context is the Earth --
418	the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.
423	So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
427	It's not slavishly mimicking --
429	although Al is trying to get the hairdo going --
432	it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,
436	the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.
441	Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what
445	I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field
448	is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,
452	on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,
456	like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation
459	and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,
464	genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.
467	That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me
472	is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines
477	are really not very high tech in my estimation
480	in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens
485	in the water in Silicon Valley.
488	So the hardware
491	is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.
496	So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?
501	The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.
505	How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?
512	More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?
516	And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
519	What's the syllabus?
521	Three questions, for me, are key.
525	How does life make things?
527	This is the opposite; this is how we make things.
530	It's called heat, beat and treat --
532	that's what material scientists call it.
534	And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over
539	and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;
544	you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.
547	Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things?
551	How does life make the most of things?
554	That's a geranium pollen.
557	And its shape is what gives it the function of being able
562	to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.
566	Life adds information to matter.
571	In other words: structure.
573	It gives it information. By adding information to matter,
578	it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.
584	And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?
589	Because life doesn't really deal in things;
594	there are no things in the natural world divorced
598	from their systems.
601	Really quick syllabus.
603	As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,
609	there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.
613	And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses
616	and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.
620	The two groups are not talking to each other.
622	At all.
625	What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,
629	to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?
634	I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.
637	One that's exciting to me is self-assembly.
640	Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.
644	Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.
648	On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl
652	forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral
656	and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.
659	It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
662	But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,
666	it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.
671	This is Sandia National Labs.
673	A guy named Jeff Brinker
678	has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.
682	Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
686	by simply dipping something into a liquid,
690	lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation
693	force the molecules in the liquid together,
697	so that they jigsaw together
699	in the same way as this crystallization works.
703	Imagine making all of our hard materials that way.
706	Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,
713	onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.
717	Here's an interesting one for the IT world:
721	bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.
726	And so silicon, which we make right now --
728	it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips --
734	this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.
738	This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.
742	This is from Ernst Haeckel's work.
745	Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process,
750	and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that
754	sort of structure coming out at room temperature.
758	Imagine being able to make perfect lenses.
761	On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses
766	that the people at Lucent Technologies have found
769	have no distortion whatsoever.
771	It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.
774	And there's many of them, all over its entire body.
777	What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.
780	A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,
784	is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create
788	these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.
792	That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
795	Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics
798	that work better than ours, actually, to move light,
801	but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.
807	Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.
811	A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,
814	you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.
818	We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains
821	of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way --
827	he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2
830	and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics
834	out of CO2 -- how plant-like.
836	Solar transformations: the most exciting one.
839	There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device
843	inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,
847	lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen
850	that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve
855	hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up --
859	basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell
864	and in a reversible fuel cell.
866	In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;
869	life does it with a very, very common iron.
873	And a team has now just been able to mimic
877	that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.
882	That's very exciting for fuel cells --
884	to be able to do that without platinum.
887	Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale
892	have tubercles on them. And those little bumps
895	actually increase efficiency in, for instance,
900	the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent.
905	Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings,
907	if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
912	Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.
916	Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers;
919	it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able
922	to self-assemble products with the last few layers
925	playing with light to create color.
929	Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface,
934	so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.
939	See that up-close picture?
941	That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.
944	And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
947	There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics --
952	when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps
956	in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
961	Water is going to be our big, grand challenge:
967	quenching thirst.
969	Here are two organisms that pull water.
972	The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
976	The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air,
979	does not drink fresh water.
982	Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta,
989	before it gets into a building, are key technologies.
993	Separation technologies are going to be extremely important.
997	What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?
1001	What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams,
1007	small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do;
1011	they chelate metals out of water.
1013	There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3
1016	that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters
1022	to mine waste streams.
1025	Green chemistry is chemistry in water.
1029	We do chemistry in organic solvents.
1031	This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider
1035	and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?
1038	Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.
1046	It's not easy, because life uses
1051	only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.
1055	And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.
1059	To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset
1064	of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell,
1070	is the task of green chemistry.
1072	Timed degradation: packaging that is good
1076	until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.
1080	That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here,
1083	and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years,
1087	they begin to dissolve.
1089	Healing: this is a good one.
1092	That little guy over there is a tardigrade.
1095	There is a problem with vaccines around the world
1101	not getting to patients. And the reason is
1104	that the refrigeration somehow gets broken;
1108	"what's called the ""cold chain"" gets broken."
1110	A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade --
1113	which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months
1119	and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.
1122	And he found a way to dry out vaccines --
1125	encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules
1129	as the tardigrade has within its cells --
1132	meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.
1137	They can be put in a glove compartment, OK.
1141	Learning from organisms. This is a session about water --
1146	learning about organisms that can do without water,
1149	in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.
1156	I'm not going to get to 12.
1159	But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing,
1163	besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms
1168	have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do
1173	while taking care of the place
1176	that's going to take care of their offspring.
1181	When they're involved in foreplay,
1184	they're thinking about something very, very important --
1187	and that's having their genetic material
1191	remain, 10,000 generations from now.
1196	And that means finding a way to do what they do
1198	without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.
1202	That's the biggest design challenge.
1205	Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses
1211	willing to gift us with their best ideas.
1214	Good luck having a conversation with them.
1217	Thank you.
1218	(Applause)
1232	Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly.
1236	Janine Benyus: Oh really?
1237	CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version
1240	of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous,
1243	and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down
1245	without seeing 10, 11 and 12.
1247	JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.
1251	OK, so that's the healing one.
1254	Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.
1257	This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer,
1261	and yet they don't collide with one another.
1264	And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.
1269	(Laughter)
1271	Right. There's a person at Newcastle
1275	who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.
1278	And she's actually figuring out how to make
1281	a collision-avoidance circuitry
1283	based on this very large neuron in the locust.
1287	This is a huge and important one, number 11.
1289	And that's the growing fertility.
1291	That means, you know, net fertility farming.
1295	We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too.
1299	Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet
1304	to create more and more opportunities for life.
1307	And really, that's what other organisms do as well.
1309	In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do:
1312	they create more and more opportunities for life.
1315	Our farming has done the opposite.
1318	So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil,
1322	ranching based on how a native ungulate herd
1326	actually increases the health of the range,
1328	even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh
1333	not only cleans the water,
1335	but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.
1339	This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple
1343	because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.
1348	That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out
1353	how to enhance or sweeten their places,
1357	are not around to tell us about it.
1360	That's the twelfth one.
1363	Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick --
1367	life creates conditions conducive to life.
1371	It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water;
1375	it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
1378	And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay
1384	and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.
1390	We have to find a way to meet our needs,
1393	while making of this place an Eden.
1399	CA: Janine, thank you so much.
1400	(Applause)
