25	A fact
27	came out of MIT,
30	couple of years ago. Ken Hale,
32	who's a linguist,
34	said that of the 6,000 languages
37	spoken on Earth right now,
39	3,000 aren't spoken by the children.
42	So that in one generation,
45	we're going to halve our cultural diversity.
49	He went on to say
51	that every two weeks,
53	an elder goes to the grave
55	carrying the last spoken word
57	of that culture.
59	So an entire philosophy,
64	a body of knowledge about the natural world
66	that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,
70	goes away.
72	And this happens every two weeks.
76	So for the last 20 years,
78	since my dental experience,
81	I have been traveling the world
84	and coming back
86	with stories about some of these people.
88	What I'd like to do right now
90	is share some of those stories with you.
93	This is Tamdin.
95	She is a 69-year-old nun.
99	She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years
102	for putting up a little tiny placard
104	protesting the occupation of her country.
108	And when I met her, she had just
111	taken a walk over the Himalayas
113	from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,
116	into Nepal, across to India --
120	to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.
123	The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.
125	So I took this picture three days
127	after she arrived,
129	and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,
131	with her toes sticking out.
133	And she crossed in March,
135	and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.
140	This is Paldin.
142	Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.
144	And he spent 33 years in prison.
148	His whole monastery was thrown into prison
151	at the time of the uprising,
154	when the Dalai Lama had to leave
157	Tibet.
159	And
161	he was beaten, starved,
164	tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.
166	And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.
170	And it really impressed me --
172	I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --
175	that he went through that experience, and ended up
177	with the demeanor that he had.
180	So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,
183	and I'd spent about five weeks there,
186	and I was hearing these similar stories
188	of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet
191	into Dharamsala.
193	And it just so happened, on the fifth week,
196	there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.
200	And
202	I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,
205	many of which I had just interviewed,
207	and heard their stories,
209	and I watched their faces,
212	and they gave us a little FM radio,
214	and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.
217	And what he said was:
219	treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,
223	because it's your enemies
225	that build your tolerance and patience
228	on the road to your enlightenment.
232	That hit me so hard,
236	telling these people that had been through this experience.
240	So, two months later, I went into
243	Tibet, and I started
245	interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.
248	I interview and do portraits.
251	And this is a little girl.
253	I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.
256	And I'd snuck in --
258	because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --
263	it's the quickest way you can get arrested.
266	So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,
269	and I would hand them out.
271	And when I gave them to the people,
274	they'd either hold them to their heart,
276	or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.
279	And this is --
281	well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --
283	that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.
288	So
289	I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.
293	This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.
295	And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,
298	way in the western part of the country.
301	This is at 17,000 feet.
303	And they had just come down from the high pastures,
306	at 18,000 feet.
308	Same thing: gave her a picture,
310	she held it up to her forehead.
312	And I usually hand out Polaroids
315	when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,
317	and checking my lights,
319	and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.
324	This is Tenzin Gyatso;
326	he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,
330	out in a peasant's house,
333	way out in the middle of nowhere.
335	At the age of four, he was installed
337	as the 14th Dalai Lama.
340	As a teenager, he faced
342	the invasion of his country,
344	and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.
347	Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot
349	to kill him,
351	they dressed him up like a beggar
353	and snuck him out of the country on horseback,
356	and took the same trip that Tamdin did.
359	And he's never been back to his country since.
363	And
365	if you think about this man,
369	still sticking
371	to this non-violent response
375	to a severe political and human rights issue.
379	And the young people,
381	young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.
384	You know, violence as a political tool
386	is all the rage right now.
388	And
391	he still is holding this line.
393	So this is our icon
395	to non-violence in our world --
398	one of our living icons.
401	This is another leader of his people.
403	This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
406	And Moi is 35 years old.
409	And
411	this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --
413	oil was discovered in 1972.
416	And in this period of time -- since that time --
419	as much oil, or twice as much oil
422	as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,
425	was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,
428	and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.
432	And Moi
434	belongs to the Huaorani tribe,
436	and they're known as
438	"very fierce, they're known as ""auca."""
440	And they've managed to keep out
443	the seismologists and the oil workers
445	with spears and blowguns.
448	And we spent --
450	I was with a team --
453	two weeks with these guys out in the jungle
456	watching them hunt.
458	This was on a monkey hunt,
460	hunting with curare-tipped darts.
463	And the knowledge that these people have
466	about the natural environment is incredible.
468	They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.
472	And I couldn't even see the monkeys
474	that they were
476	getting with these darts.
480	This is Yadira,
482	and Yadira is
484	five years old. She's in a
487	tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.
490	And her tribe has had to move
492	three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.
496	And we never hear about that. And the latest
499	infraction against these people is,
502	as part of Plan Colombia,
504	we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --
507	we're defoliating thousands of acres
510	of the Ecuadorian Amazon
512	in our war on drugs.
514	And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.
518	This is Mengatoue.
520	He's the shaman of the Huaorani,
522	and
525	he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;
528	I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired
530	of spearing these oil workers.
532	I wish they would just go away.
537	And I was -- I usually travel alone
540	when I do my work, but I did this --
543	I hosted a program for Discovery,
545	and when I went down with the team,
548	I was quite concerned about
551	going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,
554	deep into the Huaorani tribe.
556	And
558	as it turned out, these guys really
560	taught me a thing or two about blending in
563	with the locals.
565	(Laughter)
568	One of the things I did
571	just before 9/11 --
574	August of 2001 --
576	I took my son, Dax,
578	who was 16 at the time,
581	and I took him to Pakistan.
583	Because at first I wanted --
585	you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,
587	but I wanted him to see
589	people that live on a dollar a day or less.
592	I wanted him to get an experience
594	in the Islamic world
596	and I also wanted him to --
599	I was going there to work with a group,
601	do a story on a group called the Kalash,
603	that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,
605	that live -- very small area --
609	surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000
612	of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.
616	So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,
619	drumming and dancing.
621	And he brought a soccer ball,
623	and we had soccer every night in this little village.
626	And then we went up
628	and met their shaman.
630	By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman
632	of his tribe as well.
634	And this is John Doolikahn,
636	who's the shaman of the Kalash.
639	And he's up in the mountains,
641	right on the border with Afghanistan.
643	In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,
646	the area where
649	Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.
652	And we watched
655	and stayed with
657	John Doolikahn.
659	And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,
662	which is
664	an interesting phenomenon.
666	But around the world,
668	they go into trance in different ways,
670	and in Pakistan,
672	the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves
675	and they sacrifice an animal,
678	pour the blood of the animal on the leaves
680	and then inhale the smoke.
682	And they're all praying
685	to the mountain gods
688	as they go into trance.
692	You know,
694	getting kids used to different realities,
698	I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --
702	having a curriculum where they study different religions,
705	just to make a mental flexibility,
707	give them a mental flexibility
709	in different belief systems --
711	I think this is so necessary in our world today
714	as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.
718	And all the security issues they cause us.
722	So, one thing we did five years ago:
725	we started a program that links kids
728	in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.
730	So we first hooked up
733	a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.
738	We now have 15 sites.
741	We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;
744	Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --
746	Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim
749	and one-third animist, the community is --
752	Ollantaytambo, Peru,
754	and Arctic Village, Alaska.
756	This is Daniel; he's one of our students
758	in Arctic Village, Alaska.
760	He lives in this log cabin --
762	no running water, no heat other than --
765	no windows
767	and high-speed Internet connection.
769	And this is --
771	I see this rolling out all over --
773	this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,
776	where they first saw their first computers;
778	now they have computers in their classrooms.
781	And the way we've done this --
783	we teach digital storytelling to these kids.
786	And we have them tell stories about issues in their community
789	in their community that they care about.
791	And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story
793	about a river that they cleaned up.
795	And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,
798	and we bring people who want to learn
801	digital workflow and storytelling,
805	and have them
807	work with the kids.
809	And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,
813	and this has worked the best.
815	So our dream is to bring teenagers together,
817	so they'll have a community service experience
820	as well as a cross-cultural experience,
823	as they teach kids in these areas
825	and help them build their communication infrastructure.
828	This is teaching Photoshop
831	in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.
835	We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.
838	This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies
840	that these kids have made,
842	and they're quite incredible.
844	The one I want to show you --
846	after we get them to make the movies,
849	we have a night where we show the movies to the community.
852	And this is in Takaungu --
854	we've got a generator and a digital projector,
856	and we're projecting it up against a barn,
858	and showing one of the movies that they made.
861	And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see
864	the incredible work these kids do.
867	The other thing:
870	I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.
872	That was one of the big motivating factors.
875	But the other motivating factor is
877	the insular nature of our country.
880	National Geographic just did a Roper Study
883	of 18 to 26 year olds
886	in our country
888	and in nine other industrialized countries.
891	It was a two million dollar study.
893	United States came in second to last
896	in geographic knowledge.
900	Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;
909	And this is a study
911	that was just done a couple of years ago.
915	So what I'd like to show you now,
918	in the couple of minutes I have left,
920	is a film that a student made in Guatemala.
922	We just had a workshop in Guatemala.
925	A week before we got to the workshop,
928	a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,
932	last October, came in and buried
936	And this kid lived in the village --
938	he wasn't there at the time --
940	and this is the little movie he put together about that.
944	And he hadn't seen a computer before
946	we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --
950	yeah, we can play it.
975	This is an old Mayan funeral chant
978	that he got from his grandfather.
1118	Thank you very much.
1120	(Applause)
