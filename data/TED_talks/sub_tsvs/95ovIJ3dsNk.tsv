12.653	In the mid-'90s,
14.265	the CDC and Kaiser Permanente
16.872	discovered an exposure
16.872	that dramatically increased the risk
20.992	for seven out of 10 of the leading
20.992	causes of death in the United States.
26.953	In high doses, it affects
26.953	brain development,
30.344	the immune system, hormonal systems,
34.011	and even the way our DNA
34.011	is read and transcribed.
38.684	Folks who are exposed in very high doses
42.205	have triple the lifetime risk
42.205	of heart disease and lung cancer
46.292	and a 20-year difference
46.292	in life expectancy.
51.911	And yet, doctors today are not trained
51.911	in routine screening or treatment.
58.203	Now, the exposure I'm talking about is
58.203	not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.
63.558	It's childhood trauma.
66.968	Okay. What kind of trauma
66.968	am I talking about here?
69.686	I'm not talking about failing a test
69.686	or losing a basketball game.
73.995	I am talking about threats
73.995	that are so severe or pervasive
78.736	that they literally get under our skin
78.736	and change our physiology:
83.333	things like abuse or neglect,
85.725	or growing up with a parent 
85.725	who struggles with mental illness
89.495	or substance dependence.
91.887	Now, for a long time,
93.444	I viewed these things in the way 
93.444	I was trained to view them,
96.441	either as a social problem --
96.441	refer to social services --
100.533	or as a mental health problem --
100.533	refer to mental health services.
106.088	And then something happened
106.088	to make me rethink my entire approach.
111.776	When I finished my residency,
113.648	I wanted to go someplace
113.648	where I felt really needed,
117.372	someplace where I could make a difference.
120.53	So I came to work for
120.53	California Pacific Medical Center,
123.646	one of the best private hospitals
123.646	in Northern California,
127.472	and together, we opened a clinic
127.472	in Bayview-Hunters Point,
132	one of the poorest, most underserved
132	neighborhoods in San Francisco.
136.263	Now, prior to that point,
138.118	there had been only
138.118	one pediatrician in all of Bayview
140.98	to serve more than 10,000 children,
144.423	so we hung a shingle, and we were able
144.423	to provide top-quality care
149.072	regardless of ability to pay.
151.057	It was so cool. We targeted
151.057	the typical health disparities:
155.219	access to care, immunization rates,
155.219	asthma hospitalization rates,
160.026	and we hit all of our numbers.
162.183	We felt very proud of ourselves.
165.446	But then I started noticing
165.446	a disturbing trend.
168.627	A lot of kids were being
168.627	referred to me for ADHD,
172.517	or Attention Deficit
172.517	Hyperactivity Disorder,
175.514	but when I actually did
175.514	a thorough history and physical,
180.396	what I found was that
180.396	for most of my patients,
183.595	I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.
187.264	Most of the kids I was seeing
187.264	had experienced such severe trauma
192.834	that it felt like something else
192.834	was going on.
196.224	Somehow I was missing something important.
201.516	Now, before I did my residency,
201.516	I did a master's degree in public health,
205.317	and one of the things that they teach you
205.317	in public health school
208.41	is that if you're a doctor
210.295	and you see 100 kids
210.295	that all drink from the same well,
214.079	and 98 of them develop diarrhea,
217.477	you can go ahead
217.477	and write that prescription
219.763	for dose after dose
219.763	after dose of antibiotics,
224.092	or you can walk over and say,
224.092	"""What the hell is in this well?"""
229.915	So I began reading everything that
229.915	I could get my hands on
233.708	about how exposure to adversity
236.262	affects the developing brains
236.262	and bodies of children.
239.741	And then one day,
239.741	my colleague walked into my office,
243.646	"and he said, ""Dr. Burke,"
243.646	"have you seen this?"""
248.9	In his hand was a copy
248.9	of a research study
252.902	called the Adverse Childhood
252.902	Experiences Study.
256.569	That day changed my clinical practice
256.569	and ultimately my career.
264.465	The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study
266.573	is something that everybody
266.573	needs to know about.
269.805	It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser
269.805	and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC,
275.136	and together, they asked 17,500 adults
275.136	about their history of exposure
283.334	"to what they called ""adverse "
283.334	"childhood experiences,"" or ACEs."
288.911	Those include physical, emotional,
288.911	or sexual abuse;
292.838	physical or emotional neglect;
296.764	parental mental illness,
296.764	substance dependence, incarceration;
299.858	parental separation or divorce;
302.637	or domestic violence.
305.172	For every yes, you would get
305.172	a point on your ACE score.
309.608	And then what they did
311.116	was they correlated these ACE scores
311.116	against health outcomes.
316.836	What they found was striking.
319.673	Two things:
320.968	Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.
325.23	Sixty-seven percent of the population
325.23	had at least one ACE,
332.034	and 12.6 percent, one in eight,
332.034	had four or more ACEs.
338.692	The second thing that they found
340.971	was that there was
340.971	a dose-response relationship
344.433	between ACEs and health outcomes:
349.033	the higher your ACE score,
349.033	the worse your health outcomes.
352.952	For a person with an ACE score
352.952	of four or more,
356.203	their relative risk of chronic
356.203	obstructive pulmonary disease
359.895	was two and a half times that
359.895	of someone with an ACE score of zero.
365.096	For hepatitis, it was also
365.096	two and a half times.
368.37	For depression, it was
368.37	four and a half times.
371.69	For suicidality, it was 12 times.
375.123	A person with an ACE score
375.123	of seven or more
378.288	had triple the lifetime risk
378.288	of lung cancer
382.858	and three and a half times the risk
382.858	of ischemic heart disease,
386.829	the number one killer
386.829	in the United States of America.
391.124	Well, of course this makes sense.
393.887	Some people looked at this data
393.887	"and they said, ""Come on."
398.554	You have a rough childhood,
398.554	you're more likely to drink and smoke
403.376	and do all these things
403.376	that are going to ruin your health.
406.191	This isn't science.
406.191	"This is just bad behavior."""
410.486	It turns out this is exactly
410.486	where the science comes in.
415.725	We now understand
415.725	better than we ever have before
420.379	how exposure to early adversity
423.631	affects the developing brains
423.631	and bodies of children.
426.719	It affects areas like
426.719	the nucleus accumbens,
429.505	the pleasure and reward
429.505	center of the brain
432.036	that is implicated
432.036	in substance dependence.
434.682	It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,
437.404	which is necessary for impulse control
437.404	and executive function,
441.461	a critical area for learning.
443.528	And on MRI scans,
445.216	we see measurable differences
445.216	in the amygdala,
449.204	the brain's fear response center.
452.246	So there are real neurologic reasons
455.766	why folks exposed
455.766	to high doses of adversity
459.296	are more likely to engage
459.296	in high-risk behavior,
462.593	and that's important to know.
464.497	But it turns out that even if you don't
464.497	engage in any high-risk behavior,
470.116	you're still more likely
470.116	to develop heart disease or cancer.
476.101	The reason for this has to do with
476.101	the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,
482.027	the brain's and body's
482.027	stress response system
485.696	that governs our fight-or-flight response.
489.476	How does it work?
491.431	Well, imagine you're walking
491.431	in the forest and you see a bear.
495.169	Immediately, your hypothalamus
495.169	sends a signal to your pituitary,
499.326	which sends a signal 
499.326	to your adrenal gland that says,
501.927	"""Release stress hormones!"
501.927	"Adrenaline! Cortisol!"""
505.478	And so your heart starts to pound,
508.099	Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,
510.234	and you are ready to either
510.234	fight that bear or run from the bear.
516.482	And that is wonderful
518.798	if you're in a forest
518.798	and there's a bear.
522.289	(Laughter)
524.843	But the problem is what happens
524.843	when the bear comes home every night,
530.256	and this system is activated
530.256	over and over and over again,
535.904	and it goes from being
535.904	adaptive, or life-saving,
540.408	to maladaptive, or health-damaging.
544.533	Children are especially sensitive
544.533	to this repeated stress activation,
550.036	because their brains and bodies
550.036	are just developing.
554	High doses of adversity not only affect
554	brain structure and function,
560.075	they affect the developing immune system,
563.301	developing hormonal systems,
566.144	and even the way our DNA
566.144	is read and transcribed.
572.413	So for me, this information
572.413	threw my old training out the window,
576.871	because when we understand
576.871	the mechanism of a disease,
580.818	when we know not only
580.818	which pathways are disrupted, but how,
585.555	then as doctors, it is our job
585.555	to use this science
590.216	for prevention and treatment.
592.845	That's what we do.
594.728	So in San Francisco, we created
594.728	the Center for Youth Wellness
598.791	to prevent, screen and heal the impacts
598.791	of ACEs and toxic stress.
604.224	We started simply with routine screening
604.224	of every one of our kids
608.807	at their regular physical,
610.334	because I know that if my patient 
610.334	has an ACE score of 4,
615.038	she's two and a half times as likely
615.038	to develop hepatitis or COPD,
619.595	she's four and half times as likely
619.595	to become depressed,
622.497	and she's 12 times as likely
622.497	to attempt to take her own life
626.56	as my patient with zero ACEs.
628.86	I know that when she's in my exam room.
632.249	For our patients who do screen positive,
635.013	we have a multidisciplinary treatment team
635.013	that works to reduce the dose of adversity
640.235	and treat symptoms using best practices,
640.235	including home visits, care coordination,
646.118	mental health care, nutrition,
650.032	holistic interventions, and yes,
650.032	medication when necessary.
654.747	But we also educate parents
654.747	about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress
659.436	the same way you would for covering
659.436	electrical outlets, or lead poisoning,
664.946	and we tailor the care
664.946	of our asthmatics and our diabetics
668.886	in a way that recognizes that they may
668.886	need more aggressive treatment,
673.344	given the changes to their hormonal
673.344	and immune systems.
677.771	So the other thing that happens
677.771	when you understand this science
681.863	is that you want to shout it
681.863	from the rooftops,
684.861	because this isn't just an issue
684.861	for kids in Bayview.
689.191	I figured the minute
689.191	that everybody else heard about this,
692.825	it would be routine screening,
692.825	multi-disciplinary treatment teams,
696.308	and it would be a race to the most
696.308	effective clinical treatment protocols.
701.105	Yeah. That did not happen.
705.225	And that was a huge learning for me.
708.08	What I had thought of as simply
708.08	best clinical practice
712.887	I now understand to be a movement.
717.125	In the words of Dr. Robert Block,
719.475	the former President
719.475	of the American Academy of Pediatrics,
723.176	"""Adverse childhood experiences"
726.128	are the single greatest
726.128	unaddressed public health threat
731.138	"facing our nation today."""
733.387	And for a lot of people,
733.387	that's a terrifying prospect.
738.033	The scope and scale of the problem
738.033	seems so large that it feels overwhelming
743.838	to think about how we might approach it.
746.462	But for me, that's actually
746.462	where the hopes lies,
750.869	because when we have the right framework,
753.533	when we recognize this to be
753.533	a public health crisis,
758.79	then we can begin to use the right 
758.79	tool kit to come up with solutions.
763.794	From tobacco to lead poisoning 
763.794	to HIV/AIDS,
767.522	the United States actually has
767.522	quite a strong track record
772.535	with addressing public health problems,
775.439	but replicating those successes
775.439	with ACEs and toxic stress
780.942	is going to take determination
780.942	and commitment,
785.539	and when I look at what
785.539	our nation's response has been so far,
789.511	I wonder,
791.355	why haven't we taken this more seriously?
795.154	You know, at first I thought
795.154	that we marginalized the issue
798.976	because it doesn't apply to us.
800.9	That's an issue for those kids
800.9	in those neighborhoods.
804.198	Which is weird, because the data
804.198	doesn't bear that out.
808.387	The original ACEs study
808.387	was done in a population
812.52	that was 70 percent Caucasian,
818.465	But then, the more I talked to folks,
821.947	I'm beginning to think that maybe
821.947	I had it completely backwards.
827.334	If I were to ask
827.334	how many people in this room
833.278	grew up with a family member
833.278	who suffered from mental illness,
837.587	I bet a few hands would go up.
840.053	And then if I were to ask how many folks
840.053	had a parent who maybe drank too much,
845.754	or who really believed that
845.754	if you spare the rod, you spoil the child,
851.077	I bet a few more hands would go up.
854.195	Even in this room, this is an issue
854.195	that touches many of us,
859.276	and I am beginning to believe
859.276	that we marginalize the issue
862.665	because it does apply to us.
865.261	Maybe it's easier to see
865.261	in other zip codes
868.121	because we don't want to look at it.
871.024	We'd rather be sick.
874.112	Fortunately, scientific advances
874.112	and, frankly, economic realities
880.44	make that option less viable every day.
885.524	The science is clear:
887.991	Early adversity dramatically affects
887.991	health across a lifetime.
893.87	Today, we are beginning to understand
893.87	how to interrupt the progression
898.632	from early adversity
898.632	to disease and early death,
902.933	and 30 years from now,
905.458	the child who has a high ACE score
907.966	and whose behavioral symptoms
907.966	go unrecognized,
911.071	whose asthma management
911.071	is not connected,
913.771	and who goes on to develop
913.771	high blood pressure
916.975	and early heart disease or cancer
919.819	will be just as anomalous
919.819	as a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS.
924.963	People will look at that situation
924.963	"and say, ""What the heck happened there?"""
930.468	This is treatable.
932.755	This is beatable.
935.527	The single most important thing
935.527	that we need today
939.69	is the courage to look
939.69	this problem in the face
943.017	and say, this is real
943.017	and this is all of us.
948.089	I believe that we are the movement.
952.826	Thank you.
954.204	(Applause)
