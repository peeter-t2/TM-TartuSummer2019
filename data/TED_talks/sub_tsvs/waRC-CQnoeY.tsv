12.76	So earlier this year,
14.4	I was informed that I would be
14.4	doing a TED Talk.
18.24	So I was excited, then I panicked,
20.24	then I was excited, then I panicked,
22.28	and in between the excitement
22.28	and the panicking,
24.84	I started to do my research,
27.16	and my research primarily consisted
27.16	of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.
31.64	(Laughter)
32.88	And interspersed with that,
34.56	I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
37.28	How many of you know who that is?
38.92	(Cheers)
41.72	So I was Googling her
41.72	because I always Google her
44.08	because I'm just a fan,
45.36	but also because she always has
45.36	important and interesting things to say.
49	And the combination of those searches
52.48	kept leading me to her talk
55.12	on the dangers of a single story,
58.32	on what happens
58.32	when we have a solitary lens
61.72	through which to understand
61.72	certain groups of people,
64.24	and it is the perfect talk.
67.72	It's the talk that I would have given
67.72	if I had been famous first.
72.08	(Laughter)
74.28	You know, and you know,
74.28	like, she's African and I'm African,
77.68	and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,
79.64	and she's a storyteller
79.64	and I'm a storyteller,
81.84	so I really felt like it's my talk.
83.68	(Laughter)
86.44	So I decided that I was going
86.44	to learn how to code,
89.76	and then I was going to hack the internet
91.8	and I would take down all the copies
91.8	of that talk that existed,
95.56	and then I would memorize it,
97	and then I would come here
97	and deliver it as if it was my own speech.
100.28	So that plan was going really well,
100.28	except the coding part,
103.48	and then one morning a few months ago,
107.4	I woke up
109	to the news that the wife
109	of a certain presidential candidate
114.48	had given a speech that --
117.48	(Laughter)
119.44	(Applause)
124.96	that sounded eerily like a speech
124.96	given by one of my other faves,
129.6	Michelle Obama.
130.84	(Cheers)
132.96	And so I decided that I should
132.96	probably write my own TED Talk,
137	and so that is what I am here to do.
139.52	I'm here to talk about
139.52	my own observations about storytelling.
144.64	I want to talk to you
144.64	about the power of stories, of course,
148.64	but I also want to talk
148.64	about their limitations,
151.6	particularly for those of us
151.6	who are interested in social justice.
156.28	So since Adichie gave that talk
156.28	seven years ago,
159.2	there has been a boom in storytelling.
161.48	Stories are everywhere,
164.24	and if there was a danger
164.24	in the telling of one tired old tale,
168.2	then I think there has got to be
168.2	lots to celebrate about the flourishing
172.56	of so many stories and so many voices.
175.36	Stories are the antidote to bias.
178.96	In fact, today, if you are middle class
178.96	and connected via the internet,
184.04	you can download stories
184.04	at the touch of a button
187.2	or the swipe of a screen.
188.6	You can listen to a podcast
190.44	about what it's like
190.44	to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.
194.36	You can hear an indigenous
194.36	man in Australia
196.88	talk about the trials and triumphs
196.88	of raising his children in dignity
201	and in pride.
202.36	Stories make us fall in love.
204.36	They heal rifts and they bridge divides.
207.56	Stories can even make it easier for us
209.44	to talk about the deaths
209.44	of people in our societies
212.12	who don't matter,
212.12	because they make us care.
214.6	Right?
216.8	I'm not so sure,
218.08	and I actually work for a place
218.08	called the Centre for Stories.
221.84	And my job is to help to tell stories
226.28	that challenge mainstream narratives
226.28	about what it means to be black
229.84	or a Muslim or a refugee
229.84	or any of those other categories
232.92	that we talk about all the time.
235.96	But I come to this work
237.2	after a long history
237.2	as a social justice activist,
240.72	and so I'm really interested in the ways
242.88	that people talk
242.88	about nonfiction storytelling
245.6	as though it's about
245.6	more than entertainment,
247.96	as though it's about being
247.96	a catalyst for social action.
251.56	It's not uncommon to hear people say
254.24	that stories make
254.24	the world a better place.
258.96	Increasingly, though, I worry
258.96	that even the most poignant stories,
262.2	particularly the stories about people
262.2	who no one seems to care about,
266.16	can often get in the way
266.16	of action towards social justice.
269.6	Now, this is not because
269.6	storytellers mean any harm.
273.44	Quite the contrary.
274.72	Storytellers are often do-gooders
274.72	like me and, I suspect, yourselves.
279.6	And the audiences of storytellers
282.68	are often deeply compassionate
282.68	and empathetic people.
286.36	Still, good intentions
286.36	can have unintended consequences,
291.2	and so I want to propose that stories
291.2	are not as magical as they seem.
295.68	So three -- because
295.68	it's always got to be three --
298.6	three reasons why I think
300.84	that stories don't necessarily
300.84	make the world a better place.
306.32	Firstly, stories can create
306.32	an illusion of solidarity.
310.4	There is nothing
310.4	like that feel-good factor you get
312.96	from listening to a fantastic story
315.12	where you feel like you
315.12	climbed that mountain, right,
318.52	or that you befriended
318.52	that death row inmate.
321.84	But you didn't.
323.28	You haven't done anything.
325.12	Listening is an important
326.92	but insufficient step
326.92	towards social action.
331.12	Secondly, I think often we are drawn
334	towards characters and protagonists
336.96	who are likable and human.
340.44	And this makes sense, of course, right?
342.36	Because if you like someone,
342.36	then you care about them.
345.44	But the inverse is also true.
347.4	If you don't like someone,
349.2	then you don't care about them.
351.16	And if you don't care about them,
353.04	you don't have to see yourself
353.04	as having a moral obligation
356.96	to think about the circumstances
356.96	that shaped their lives.
361	I learned this lesson
361	when I was 14 years old.
364.32	I learned that actually,
364.32	you don't have to like someone
367.12	to recognize their wisdom,
368.52	and you certainly
368.52	don't have to like someone
370.64	to take a stand by their side.
372.8	So my bike was stolen
375.52	while I was riding it --
377	(Laughter)
378.16	which is possible if you're
378.16	riding slowly enough, which I was.
381.76	(Laughter)
383.28	So one minute
383.28	I'm cutting across this field
386.28	in the Nairobi neighborhood
386.28	where I grew up,
388.6	and it's like a very bumpy path,
391.08	and so when you're riding a bike,
392.92	you don't want to be like, you know --
395.2	(Laughter)
398.16	And so I'm going like this,
398.16	slowly pedaling,
402.8	and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.
405.4	I'm on the ground, and I look up,
407.6	and there's this kid peddling away
407.6	in the getaway vehicle,
410.4	which is my bike,
411.92	and he's about 11 or 12 years old,
411.92	and I'm on the floor,
415.2	and I'm crying because I saved
415.2	a lot of money for that bike,
418.08	and I'm crying and I stand up
418.08	and I start screaming.
420.68	Instinct steps in,
420.68	"and I start screaming, ""Mwizi, mwizi!"""
424.96	"which means ""thief"" in Swahili."
427.56	And out of the woodworks,
427.56	all of these people come out
432.6	and they start to give chase.
434.04	This is Africa, so mob justice in action.
436.32	Right?
437.8	And I round the corner,
437.8	and they've captured him,
440.6	they've caught him.
442.08	The suspect has been apprehended,
444.16	and they make him give me my bike back,
447.76	and they also make him apologize.
449.4	Again, you know,
449.4	typical African justice, right?
453	And so they make him say sorry.
454.52	And so we stand there facing each other,
456.88	and he looks at me, and he says sorry,
459.84	but he looks at me
459.84	with this unbridled fury.
463.36	He is very, very angry.
467.44	And it is the first time that I have been
467.44	confronted with someone
470.52	who doesn't like me
470.52	simply because of what I represent.
473.16	He looks at me
473.16	with this look as if to say,
475.24	"""You, with your shiny skin"
475.24	"and your bike, you're angry at me?"""
481.24	So it was a hard lesson
481.24	that he didn't like me,
484.52	but you know what, he was right.
486.6	I was a middle-class kid
486.6	living in a poor country.
490.12	I had a bike, and he barely had food.
493.76	Sometimes, it's the messages
493.76	that we don't want to hear,
496.72	the ones that make us
496.72	want to crawl out of ourselves,
499.24	that we need to hear the most.
501.84	For every lovable storyteller
501.84	who steals your heart,
505.04	there are hundreds more
505.04	whose voices are slurred and ragged,
509.44	who don't get to stand up on a stage
509.44	dressed in fine clothes like this.
514.64	There are a million
514.64	angry-boy-on-a-bike stories
518.96	and we can't afford to ignore them
520.64	simply because we don't like
520.64	their protagonists
523.8	or because that's not the kid
523.8	that we would bring home with us
526.76	from the orphanage.
528.6	The third reason that I think
530.48	that stories don't necessarily
530.48	make the world a better place
534.12	is that too often we are so invested
534.12	in the personal narrative
537.6	that we forget
537.6	to look at the bigger picture.
540.88	And so we applaud someone
542.8	when they tell us
542.8	about their feelings of shame,
545.48	but we don't necessarily
545.48	link that to oppression.
549.08	We nod understandingly
549.08	when someone says they felt small,
552.76	but we don't link that to discrimination.
555.6	The most important stories,
555.6	especially for social justice,
558.44	are those that do both,
560.28	that are both personal and allow us
560.28	to explore and understand the political.
565.92	But it's not just
565.92	about the stories we like
567.96	versus the stories we choose to ignore.
569.88	Increasingly, we are living in a society
569.88	where there are larger forces at play,
573.84	where stories are actually for many people
573.84	beginning to replace the news.
578.64	Yeah?
579.88	We live in a time where we are witnessing
579.88	the decline of facts,
583.28	when emotions rule
585.52	and analysis, it's kind of boring, right?
588.64	Where we value what we feel
588.64	more than what we actually know.
594.04	A recent report by the Pew Center
594.04	on trends in America
598.36	indicates that only 10 percent
598.36	of young adults under the age of 30
604.16	"""place a lot of trust in the media."""
607.56	Now, this is significant.
609.84	It means that storytellers
609.84	are gaining trust
612.48	at precisely the same moment
613.88	that many in the media
613.88	are losing the confidence in the public.
618.04	This is not a good thing,
620.64	because while stories are important
622.44	and they help us
622.44	to have insights in many ways,
624.68	we need the media.
626.56	From my years
626.56	as a social justice activist,
629.08	I know very well that we need
629.08	credible facts from media institutions
635.2	combined with the powerful voices
635.2	of storytellers.
639.24	That's what pushes the needle forward
639.24	in terms of social justice.
643.84	In the final analysis, of course,
648.48	it is justice
650.32	that makes the world a better place,
652.08	not stories. Right?
655.08	And so if it is justice that we are after,
658.16	then I think we mustn't focus
658.16	on the media or on storytellers.
661.6	We must focus on audiences,
664.32	on anyone who has ever turned on a radio
667.44	or listened to a podcast,
669.28	and that means all of us.
671.4	So a few concluding thoughts
673.56	on what audiences can do
673.56	to make the world a better place.
678	So firstly, the world
678	would be a better place, I think,
681.96	if audiences were more curious
681.96	and more skeptical
685.56	and asked more questions
685.56	about the social context
688.2	that created those stories
688.2	that they love so much.
692.2	Secondly, the world
692.2	would be a better place
694.48	if audiences recognized
694.48	that storytelling is intellectual work.
699.64	And I think it would
699.64	be important for audiences
702.6	to demand more buttons
702.6	on their favorite websites,
707.96	buttons for example that say,
710.68	"""If you liked this story,"
712.32	click here to support a cause
712.32	"your storyteller believes in."""
716.4	"Or ""click here to contribute"
716.4	"to your storyteller's next big idea."""
722.48	Often, we are committed to the platforms,
725.08	but not necessarily
725.08	to the storytellers themselves.
727.56	And then lastly, I think that audiences
727.56	can make the world a better place
732.68	by switching off their phones,
735.56	by stepping away from their screens
737.6	and stepping out into the real world
737.6	beyond what feels safe.
742.84	Alice Walker has said,
744.88	"""Look closely at the present"
744.88	you are constructing.
748.68	It should look like the future
748.68	"you are dreaming."""
752.64	Storytellers can help us to dream,
754.88	but it's up to all of us
754.88	to have a plan for justice.
759.48	Thank you.
760.72	(Applause)
