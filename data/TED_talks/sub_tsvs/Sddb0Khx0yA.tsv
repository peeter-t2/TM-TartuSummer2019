15.26	The electricity powering the lights in this theater
18.26	was generated just moments ago.
21.26	Because the way things stand today,
24.26	electricity demand must be in constant balance
27.26	with electricity supply.
30.26	If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,
33.26	some tens of megawatts of wind power
36.26	stopped pouring into the grid,
39.26	the difference would have to be made up
41.26	from other generators immediately.
45.26	But coal plants, nuclear plants
48.26	can't respond fast enough.
50.26	A giant battery could.
52.26	With a giant battery,
54.26	we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency
57.26	that prevents wind and solar
59.26	from contributing to the grid
61.26	in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.
65.26	You see, the battery
67.26	is the key enabling device here.
70.26	With it, we could draw electricity from the sun
73.26	even when the sun doesn't shine.
75.26	And that changes everything.
78.26	Because then renewables
80.26	such as wind and solar
82.26	come out from the wings,
84.26	here to center stage.
86.26	Today I want to tell you about such a device.
89.26	It's called the liquid metal battery.
91.26	It's a new form of energy storage
93.26	that I invented at MIT
96.26	along with a team of my students
98.26	and post-docs.
100.26	Now the theme of this year's TED Conference is Full Spectrum.
103.26	The OED defines spectrum
106.26	"as ""The entire range of wavelengths"
109.26	of electromagnetic radiation,
111.26	from the longest radio waves to the shortest gamma rays
114.26	of which the range of visible light
117.26	"is only a small part."""
119.26	So I'm not here today only to tell you
121.26	how my team at MIT has drawn out of nature
124.26	a solution to one of the world's great problems.
127.26	I want to go full spectrum and tell you how,
130.26	in the process of developing
132.26	this new technology,
134.26	we've uncovered some surprising heterodoxies
137.26	that can serve as lessons for innovation,
140.26	ideas worth spreading.
143.26	And you know,
145.26	if we're going to get this country out of its current energy situation,
149.26	we can't just conserve our way out;
152.26	we can't just drill our way out;
155.26	we can't bomb our way out.
157.26	We're going to do it the old-fashioned American way,
159.26	we're going to invent our way out,
161.26	working together.
163.26	(Applause)
166.26	Now let's get started.
168.26	The battery was invented about 200 years ago
171.26	by a professor, Alessandro Volta,
173.26	at the University of Padua in Italy.
176.26	His invention gave birth to a new field of science,
178.26	electrochemistry,
180.26	and new technologies
182.26	such as electroplating.
184.26	Perhaps overlooked,
186.26	Volta's invention of the battery
188.26	for the first time also
190.26	demonstrated the utility of a professor.
192.26	(Laughter)
194.26	Until Volta, nobody could imagine
196.26	a professor could be of any use.
199.26	Here's the first battery --
202.26	a stack of coins, zinc and silver,
205.26	separated by cardboard soaked in brine.
207.26	This is the starting point
209.26	for designing a battery --
211.26	two electrodes,
213.26	in this case metals of different composition,
215.26	and an electrolyte,
217.26	in this case salt dissolved in water.
219.26	The science is that simple.
221.26	Admittedly, I've left out a few details.
225.26	Now I've taught you
227.26	that battery science is straightforward
229.26	and the need for grid-level storage
231.26	is compelling,
233.26	but the fact is
235.26	that today there is simply no battery technology
238.26	capable of meeting
240.26	the demanding performance requirements of the grid --
244.26	namely uncommonly high power,
246.26	long service lifetime
248.26	and super-low cost.
250.26	We need to think about the problem differently.
253.26	We need to think big,
255.26	we need to think cheap.
257.26	So let's abandon the paradigm
259.26	of let's search for the coolest chemistry
262.26	and then hopefully we'll chase down the cost curve
264.26	by just making lots and lots of product.
267.26	Instead, let's invent
269.26	to the price point of the electricity market.
272.26	So that means
274.26	that certain parts of the periodic table
276.26	are axiomatically off-limits.
278.26	This battery needs to be made
280.26	out of earth-abundant elements.
282.26	I say, if you want to make something dirt cheap,
285.26	make it out of dirt --
287.26	(Laughter)
289.26	preferably dirt
291.26	that's locally sourced.
294.26	And we need to be able to build this thing
297.26	using simple manufacturing techniques and factories
300.26	that don't cost us a fortune.
304.26	So about six years ago,
306.26	I started thinking about this problem.
308.26	And in order to adopt a fresh perspective,
311.26	I sought inspiration from beyond the field of electricity storage.
315.26	In fact, I looked to a technology
318.26	that neither stores nor generates electricity,
321.26	but instead consumes electricity,
323.26	huge amounts of it.
325.26	I'm talking about the production of aluminum.
329.26	The process was invented in 1886
331.26	by a couple of 22-year-olds --
333.26	Hall in the United States and Heroult in France.
336.26	And just a few short years following their discovery,
339.26	aluminum changed
341.26	from a precious metal costing as much as silver
344.26	to a common structural material.
347.26	You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
350.26	It's about 50 feet wide
352.26	and recedes about half a mile --
354.26	row after row of cells
357.26	that, inside, resemble Volta's battery,
360.26	with three important differences.
362.26	Volta's battery works at room temperature.
365.26	It's fitted with solid electrodes
368.26	and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.
371.26	The Hall-Heroult cell
373.26	operates at high temperature,
375.26	a temperature high enough
377.26	that the aluminum metal product is liquid.
379.26	The electrolyte
381.26	is not a solution of salt and water,
383.26	but rather salt that's melted.
385.26	It's this combination of liquid metal,
387.26	molten salt and high temperature
390.26	that allows us to send high current through this thing.
394.26	Today, we can produce virgin metal from ore
397.26	at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound.
400.26	That's the economic miracle
402.26	of modern electrometallurgy.
404.26	It is this that caught and held my attention
407.26	to the point that I became obsessed with inventing a battery
411.26	that could capture this gigantic economy of scale.
415.26	And I did.
417.26	I made the battery all liquid --
420.26	liquid metals for both electrodes
422.26	and a molten salt for the electrolyte.
424.26	I'll show you how.
444.26	So I put low-density
447.26	liquid metal at the top,
451.26	put a high-density liquid metal at the bottom,
457.26	and molten salt in between.
463.26	So now,
465.26	how to choose the metals?
468.26	For me, the design exercise
470.26	always begins here
472.26	with the periodic table,
474.26	enunciated by another professor,
476.26	Dimitri Mendeleyev.
478.26	Everything we know
480.26	is made of some combination
482.26	of what you see depicted here.
485.26	And that includes our own bodies.
487.26	I recall the very moment one day
490.26	when I was searching for a pair of metals
493.26	that would meet the constraints
495.26	of earth abundance,
497.26	different, opposite density
500.26	and high mutual reactivity.
502.26	I felt the thrill of realization
504.26	when I knew I'd come upon the answer.
509.26	Magnesium for the top layer.
512.26	And antimony
514.26	for the bottom layer.
517.26	You know, I've got to tell you,
519.26	one of the greatest benefits of being a professor:
522.26	colored chalk.
524.26	(Laughter)
527.26	So to produce current,
530.26	magnesium loses two electrons
532.26	to become magnesium ion,
535.26	which then migrates across the electrolyte,
537.26	accepts two electrons from the antimony,
540.26	and then mixes with it to form an alloy.
543.26	The electrons go to work
545.26	in the real world out here,
548.26	powering our devices.
554.26	Now to charge the battery,
557.26	we connect a source of electricity.
560.26	It could be something like a wind farm.
564.26	And then we reverse the current.
568.26	And this forces magnesium to de-alloy
573.26	and return to the upper electrode,
576.26	restoring the initial constitution of the battery.
581.26	And the current passing between the electrodes
584.26	generates enough heat to keep it at temperature.
587.26	It's pretty cool,
590.26	at least in theory.
592.26	But does it really work?
594.26	So what to do next?
596.26	We go to the laboratory.
598.26	Now do I hire seasoned professionals?
602.26	No, I hire a student
605.26	and mentor him,
607.26	teach him how to think about the problem,
610.26	to see it from my perspective
612.26	and then turn him loose.
614.26	This is that student, David Bradwell,
616.26	who, in this image,
618.26	appears to be wondering if this thing will ever work.
621.26	What I didn't tell David at the time
623.26	was I myself wasn't convinced it would work.
626.26	But David's young and he's smart
628.26	and he wants a Ph.D.,
630.26	and he proceeds to build --
632.26	(Laughter)
634.26	He proceeds to build
636.26	the first ever liquid metal battery
638.26	of this chemistry.
640.26	And based on David's initial promising results,
643.26	which were paid
645.26	with seed funds at MIT,
648.26	I was able to attract major research funding
651.26	from the private sector
653.26	and the federal government.
655.26	And that allowed me to expand my group to 20 people,
658.26	a mix of graduate students, post-docs
660.26	and even some undergraduates.
662.26	And I was able to attract really, really good people,
665.26	people who share my passion
667.26	for science and service to society,
669.26	not science and service for career building.
673.26	And if you ask these people
675.26	why they work on liquid metal battery,
677.26	their answer would hearken back
679.26	to President Kennedy's remarks
681.26	at Rice University in 1962
684.26	when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here --
686.26	"""We choose to work on grid-level storage,"
688.26	not because it is easy,
690.26	"but because it is hard."""
692.26	(Applause)
699.26	So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.
702.26	We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
705.26	I called it the shotglass.
707.26	We've operated over 400 of these,
710.26	perfecting their performance with a plurality of chemistries --
713.26	not just magnesium and antimony.
715.26	Along the way we scaled up to the 20 watt-hour cell.
718.26	I call it the hockey puck.
720.26	And we got the same remarkable results.
722.26	And then it was onto the saucer.
724.26	That's 200 watt-hours.
726.26	The technology was proving itself
728.26	to be robust and scalable.
731.26	But the pace wasn't fast enough for us.
733.26	So a year and a half ago,
735.26	David and I,
737.26	along with another research staff-member,
739.26	formed a company
741.26	to accelerate the rate of progress
743.26	and the race to manufacture product.
745.26	So today at LMBC,
747.26	we're building cells 16 inches in diameter
749.26	with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour --
751.26	1,000 times the capacity
754.26	of that initial shotglass cell.
756.26	We call that the pizza.
758.26	And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
761.26	It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
763.26	We call that the bistro table,
765.26	but it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.
767.26	And one variant of the technology
769.26	has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules,
773.26	aggregating the modules into a giant battery
776.26	that fits in a 40-foot shipping container
778.26	for placement in the field.
780.26	And this has a nameplate capacity of two megawatt-hours --
783.26	two million watt-hours.
785.26	That's enough energy
787.26	to meet the daily electrical needs
789.26	of 200 American households.
791.26	So here you have it, grid-level storage:
794.26	silent, emissions-free,
797.26	no moving parts,
799.26	remotely controlled,
801.26	designed to the market price point
804.26	without subsidy.
807.26	So what have we learned from all this?
809.26	(Applause)
815.26	So what have we learned from all this?
817.26	Let me share with you
819.26	some of the surprises, the heterodoxies.
822.26	They lie beyond the visible.
824.26	Temperature:
826.26	Conventional wisdom says set it low,
828.26	at or near room temperature,
830.26	and then install a control system to keep it there.
833.26	Avoid thermal runaway.
835.26	Liquid metal battery is designed to operate at elevated temperature
838.26	with minimum regulation.
841.26	Our battery can handle the very high temperature rises
844.26	that come from current surges.
848.26	Scaling: Conventional wisdom says
851.26	reduce cost by producing many.
853.26	Liquid metal battery is designed to reduce cost
856.26	by producing fewer, but they'll be larger.
859.26	And finally, human resources:
861.26	Conventional wisdom says
863.26	hire battery experts,
865.26	seasoned professionals,
867.26	who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.
870.26	To develop liquid metal battery,
872.26	I hired students and post-docs and mentored them.
875.26	In a battery,
877.26	I strive to maximize electrical potential;
880.26	when mentoring,
882.26	I strive to maximize human potential.
884.26	So you see,
886.26	the liquid metal battery story
888.26	is more than an account
890.26	of inventing technology,
892.26	it's a blueprint
894.26	for inventing inventors, full-spectrum.
897.26	(Applause)
