12.988	These dragons from deep time
12.988	are incredible creatures.
17.701	They're bizzarre,
19.146	they're beautiful,
20.856	and there's very little
20.856	we know about them.
23.841	These thoughts were going
23.841	through my head
26.131	when I looked at the pages of
26.131	my first dinosaur book.
30.574	I was about five years old at the time,
33.078	and I decided there and then
35.031	that I would become a paleontologist.
37.876	Paleontology allowed me 
37.876	to combine my love for animals
41.213	with my desire to travel to 
41.213	far-flung corners of the world.
45.941	And now, a few years later,
45.941	I've led several expeditions
48.964	to the ultimate far-flung corner 
48.964	on this planet, the Sahara.
54.146	I've worked in the Sahara because
54.146	I've been on a quest
58.195	to uncover new remains of
58.195	a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur
63.3	called Spinosaurus.
66.451	A few bones of this animal
66.451	have been found
69.804	in the deserts of Egypt
71.184	and were described about 100 years ago
71.184	by a German paleontologist.
76.537	Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones
76.537	were destroyed in World War II.
81.485	So all we're left with are just
81.485	a few drawings and notes.
85.789	From these drawings,
87.05	we know that this creature, which lived 
87.05	about 100 million years ago,
90.461	was very big,
92.012	it had tall spines on its back,
92.012	forming a magnificent sail,
95.425	and it had long, slender jaws, 
95.425	a bit like a crocodile,
101.542	with conical teeth,
103.76	that may have been used 
103.76	to catch slippery prey, like fish.
108.647	But that was pretty much 
108.647	all we knew
110.704	about this animal for the next 100 years.
118.563	My fieldwork took me to the border region
118.563	between Morocco and Algeria,
123.365	a place called the Kem Kem.
125.938	It's a difficult place to work in.
128.251	You have to deal with sandstorms
128.251	and snakes and scorpions,
131.94	and it's very difficult to find
131.94	good fossils there.
135.084	But our hard work paid off.
137.9	We discovered many incredible specimens.
140.115	There's the largest dinosaur bone
141.867	that had ever been found
141.867	in this part of the Sahara.
145.475	We found remains of giant
145.475	predatory dinosaurs,
148.969	medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,
151.632	and seven or eight different kinds
151.632	of crocodile-like hunters.
157.231	These fossils were deposited
157.231	in a river system.
160.233	The river system was also home 
160.233	to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,
164.403	a monster sawfish,
167.863	and the skies over the river system
167.863	were filled with pterosaurs,
171.563	flying reptiles.
173.591	It was a pretty dangerous place,
175.21	not the kind of place where you'd want
175.21	to travel to if you had a time machine.
180.159	So we're finding all these 
180.159	incredible fossils of animals
183.079	that lived alongside Spinosaurus,
185.769	but Spinosaurus itself proved
185.769	to be very elusive.
188.538	We were just finding bits and pieces
190.285	and I was hoping that we'd find
190.285	a partial skeleton at some point.
195.64	Finally, very recently,
197.357	we were able to track down a dig site
200.467	where a local fossil hunter found
200.467	several bones of Spinosaurus.
205.431	We returned to the site,
205.431	we collected more bones.
208.291	And so after 100 years we finally
208.291	had another partial skeleton
212.364	of this bizarre creature.
214.525	And we were able to reconstruct it.
216.196	We now know that 
216.196	Spinosaurus had a head
218.09	a little bit like a crocodile,
219.886	very different from other 
219.886	predatory dinosaurs,
222.081	very different from the T. rex.
224.818	But the really interesting information
224.818	came from the rest of the skeleton.
229.671	We had long spines,
231.004	the spines forming the big sail.
233.632	We had leg bones, we had skull bones,
235.877	we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --
239.325	again, very unusual, no other
239.325	dinosaur has feet like this --
242.14	and we think they may have been
242.14	used to walk on soft sediment,
245.251	or maybe for paddling in the water.
247.943	We also looked at the fine
247.943	microstructure of the bone,
251.381	the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,
253.377	and it turns out that they're
253.377	very dense and compact.
256.136	Again, this is something we see in animals
256.136	that spend a lot of time in the water,
259.994	it's useful for buoyancy 
259.994	control in the water.
263.186	We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
263.186	and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.
268.559	And when we looked 
268.559	at the digital skeleton,
270.77	we realized that yes, this was
270.77	a dinosaur unlike any other.
275.206	It's bigger than a T. rex,
276.805	"and yes, the head has ""fish-eating"""
276.805	written all over it,
279.53	but really the entire skeleton has
279.53	"""water-loving"" written all over it --"
283.629	dense bone, paddle-like feet,
283.629	and the hind limbs are reduced in size,
288.464	and again, this is something
288.464	we see in animals
290.672	that spend a substantial amount 
290.672	of time in the water.
294.711	So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --
298.104	I'm looking at muscle attachments
298.104	and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --
302.268	we realize that we're dealing
302.268	with a river monster,
306.148	a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,
308.477	the ruler of this ancient river of giants,
311.253	feeding on the many aquatic animals
311.253	I showed you earlier on.
314.503	So that's really what makes this
314.503	an incredible discovery.
317.369	It's a dinosaur like no other.
318.874	"And some people told me, ""Wow,"
318.874	this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
322.441	There are not many things left
322.441	"to discover in the world."""
326.803	Well, I think nothing could be 
326.803	further from the truth.
329.975	I think the Sahara's 
329.975	still full of treasures,
332.246	and when people tell me there are
332.246	no places left to explore,
335.431	I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter,
335.431	Roy Chapman Andrews,
339.468	"and he said, ""Always, there has been"
339.468	an adventure just around the corner --
345.084	"and the world is still full of corners."""
347.896	That was true many decades ago
349.815	when Roy Chapman Andrews
349.815	wrote these lines.
351.857	And it is still true today.
353.839	Thank you.
354.727	(Applause)
