13.587	Two hundred years of modern science.
17.678	We have to admit
18.853	that our performance is not great.
20.995	The machines we build continue
20.995	to suffer from mechanical failures.
25.109	The houses we build
25.109	do not survive severe earthquakes.
29.322	But we shouldn't be so critical
29.322	of our scientists for a simple reason:
33.817	they didn't have much time.
36.08	Two hundred years is not a lot of time,
38.424	while nature had three billion years
41.671	to perfect some of the most
41.671	amazing materials,
45.297	that we wish we had in our possession.
48.262	Remember, these materials
48.262	carry a quality assurance
52.926	of three billion years.
55.694	Take, for example, sequoia trees.
57.549	They carry hundreds of tons
57.549	for hundreds of years
62.243	in cold weather, in warm climates,
65.185	UV light.
66.552	Yet, if you look at the structure
66.552	by high-resolution electron microscopy,
71.149	and you ask yourself, what is it made of,
74.196	surprisingly, it's made of sugar.
76.992	Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.
79.825	It's actually a nanofiber
79.825	called nanocrystalline cellulose.
83.76	And this nanocrystalline cellulose
83.76	is so strong, on a weight basis,
89.749	it's about 10 times stronger than steel.
93.092	Yet it's made of sugar.
95.541	So scientists all over the world
95.541	believe that nanocellulose
99.386	is going to be one of the most important
99.386	materials for the entire industry.
104.328	But here's the problem:
105.796	say you want to buy
105.796	a half a ton of nanocellulose
108.821	to build a boat or an airplane.
110.852	Well, you can Google, you can eBay,
110.852	you can even Alibaba.
115.551	You won't find it.
117.189	Of course, you're going to find
117.189	thousands of scientific papers --
120.819	great papers, where scientists
120.819	are going to say this is a great material,
125.66	there are lots of things
125.66	we can do with it.
127.788	But no commercial source.
130.286	So we at the Hebrew University,
130.286	together with our partners in Sweden,
134.998	decided to focus on the development
134.998	of an industrial-scale process
140.673	to produce this nanocellulose.
143.093	And, of course,
143.093	we didn't want to cut trees.
146.251	So we were looking for another source
148.974	of raw material,
150.35	and we found one -- in fact,
150.35	the sludge of the paper industry.
155.617	The reason: there is a lot of it.
158.159	Europe alone produces 11 million tons
161.993	of that material annually.
164.447	It's the equivalent of a mountain
164.447	three kilometers high,
169.078	sitting on a soccer field.
171.039	And we produce this mountain every year.
173.693	So for everybody,
173.693	it's an environmental problem,
177.194	and for us, it's a gold mine.
180.923	So now, we are actually producing,
180.923	on an industrial scale in Israel,
185.109	nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.
187.684	We can do a lot of things
187.684	with the material.
189.858	For example,
191.257	we have shown that by adding
191.257	only a small percent of nanocellulose
195.677	into cotton fibers, the same
195.677	as my shirt is made of,
199.595	it increases its strength dramatically.
202.611	So this can be used
202.611	for making amazing things,
207.834	like super-fabrics for industrial
207.834	and medical applications.
213.019	But this is not the only thing.
214.937	For example, self-standing,
214.937	self-supporting structures,
218.815	like the shelters that you can see now,
221.435	actually are now showcasing
221.435	in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.
228.702	Nature actually didn't stop its wonders
232.683	in the plant kingdom.
235.144	Think about insects.
236.515	Cat fleas, for example,
238.11	have the ability to jump
238.11	about a hundred times their height.
242.863	That's amazing.
244.343	It's the equivalent of a person
246.963	standing in the middle
246.963	of Liberty Island in New York,
251.033	and in a single jump,
252.612	going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.
256.776	I'm sure everybody would like to do that.
259.236	So the question is:
260.559	How do cat fleas do it?
262.941	It turns out, they make
262.941	this wonderful material,
266.235	which is called resilin.
268.467	In simple words, resilin,
268.467	which is a protein,
272.104	is the most elastic rubber on Earth.
277.565	You can stretch it,
279.757	you can squish it,
281.408	and it doesn't lose almost any energy
281.408	to the environment.
285.699	When you release it -- snap!
287.556	It brings back all the energy.
290.201	So I'm sure everybody
290.201	would like to have that material.
293.116	But here's the problem:
295.529	to catch cat fleas is difficult.
297.442	(Laughter)
299.408	Why? Because they are jumpy.
301.269	(Laughter)
303.466	But now, it's actually
303.466	enough to catch one.
308.653	Now we can extract its DNA
310.773	and read how cat fleas make the resilin,
313.905	and clone it into a less-jumpy
313.905	organism like a plant.
319.669	So that's exactly what we did.
321.378	Now we have the ability
321.378	to produce lots of resilin.
325.348	Well, my team decided to do something
325.348	really cool at the university.
329.749	They decided to combine
331.102	the strongest material
331.102	produced by the plant kingdom
334.348	with the most elastic material
334.348	produced by the insect kingdom --
338.902	nanocellulose with resilin.
341.42	And the result is amazing.
343.691	This material, in fact, is tough,
343.691	elastic and transparent.
350.181	So there are lots of things
350.181	that can be done with this material.
353.446	For example, next-generation sport shoes,
355.62	so we can jump higher, run faster.
358.8	And even touch screens
358.8	for computers and smartphones,
363.409	that won't break.
364.807	Well, the problem is,
364.807	we continue to implant
368.815	synthetic implants in our body,
370.927	which we glue and screw into our body.
374.514	And I'm going to say
374.514	that this is not a good idea.
376.885	Why? Because they fail.
379.103	This synthetic material fails,
380.583	just like this plastic fork,
383.465	that is not strong enough
383.465	for its performance.
386.483	But sometimes they are too strong,
388.173	and therefore their mechanical
388.173	properties do not really fit
391.268	their surrounding tissues.
393.671	But in fact, the reason
393.671	is much more fundamental.
396.81	The reason is that in nature,
399.533	there is no one there
401.436	that actually takes my head
401.436	and screws it onto my neck,
405.727	or takes my skin
405.727	and glues it onto my body.
409.413	In nature, everything is self-assembled.
412.6	So every living cell,
414.494	whether coming from a plant,
414.494	insect or human being,
419.152	has a DNA that encodes
419.152	for nanobio building blocks.
423.259	Many times they are proteins.
425.318	Other times, they are enzymes
425.318	that make other materials,
428.973	like polysaccharides, fatty acids.
431.783	And the common feature
431.783	about all these materials
435.189	is that they need no one.
437.66	They recognize each other
437.66	and self-assemble
440.63	into structures -- scaffolds
440.63	on which cells are proliferating
445.553	to give tissues.
447.017	They develop into organs,
447.017	and together bring life.
452.115	So we at the Hebrew University,
452.115	about 10 years ago, decided to focus
457.08	on probably the most important
457.08	biomaterial for humans,
462.998	which is collagen.
465.142	Why collagen?
466.356	Because collagen accounts for
466.356	about 25 percent of our dry weight.
470.094	We have nothing more than collagen,
470.094	other than water, in our body.
474.611	So I always like to say,
476.608	anyone who is in the replacement
476.608	parts of human beings
479.727	would like to have collagen.
481.749	Admittedly, before we started our project,
484.711	there were already more
484.711	than 1,000 medical implants
488.378	made of collagen.
489.804	You know, simple things like
489.804	dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,
493.684	augment lips,
495.087	and other, more sophisticated
495.087	medical implants, like heart valves.
499.906	So where is the problem?
502.076	Well, the problem is the source.
504.33	The source of all that collagen
506.679	is actually coming from dead bodies:
509.645	dead pigs, dead cows
512.548	and even human cadavers.
514.342	So safety is a big issue.
517.701	But it's not the only one.
519.709	Also, the quality.
521.756	Now here, I have a personal interest.
524.415	This is my father, Zvi,
524.415	in our winery in Israel.
527.792	A heart valve, very similar
527.792	to the one that I showed you before,
531.668	seven years ago,
531.668	was implanted in his body.
535.941	Now, the scientific literature says
535.941	that these heart valves start to fail
544.446	No wonder:
546.295	they are made from old, used tissues,
550.426	just like this wall made of bricks
550.426	that is falling apart.
554.778	Yeah, of course, I can take
554.778	those bricks and build a new wall.
558.749	But it's not going to be the same.
560.67	So the US Food and Drug Administration
565.14	made a notice already in 2007,
567.838	asking the companies to start to look
567.838	for better alternatives.
572.291	So that's exactly what we did.
574.892	We decided to clone all the five
574.892	human genes responsible
579.558	for making type I collagen in humans
583.506	into a transgenic tobacco plant.
587.462	So now, the plant has the ability
587.462	to make human collagen brand new,
593.248	untouched.
594.428	This is amazing.
596.409	Actually, it's happening now.
598.899	Today in Israel, we grow it
598.899	in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses
604.039	all over the country.
605.689	The farmers receive
605.689	small plantlets of tobacco.
608.541	It looks exactly like regular tobacco,
610.896	except that they have five human genes.
613.459	They're responsible for making
613.459	type I collagen.
616.691	We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,
620.628	we harvest the leaves,
622.54	and then the leaves are transported
622.54	by cooling trucks to the factory.
626.809	There, the process of extracting
626.809	the collagen starts.
630.555	Now, if you ever made a pesto --
630.555	essentially, the same thing.
634.066	(Laughter)
636.198	You crush the leaves, you get
636.198	the juice that contains the collagen.
640.411	We concentrate the protein,
642.329	transfer the protein to clean rooms
642.329	for the final purification,
645.62	and the end result is a collagen
645.62	identical to what we have in our body --
651.956	untouched, brand new
654.201	and from which we make
654.201	different medical implants:
657.656	bone void fillers, for example,
660.135	for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.
665.068	And more recently, even,
666.657	we've been able to launch
666.657	into the market here in Europe
671.79	a flowable gel that is used
671.79	for diabetic foot ulcers,
675.651	that is now approved
675.651	for use in the clinic.
678.823	This is not science fiction.
680.716	This is happening now.
682.391	We are using plants
682.391	to make medical implants
686.961	for replacement parts for human beings.
689.66	In fact, more recently,
689.66	we've been able to make collagen fibers
694.095	which are six times stronger
694.095	than the Achilles tendon.
697.796	That's amazing.
699.141	Together with our partners from Ireland,
702.047	we thought about the next thing:
704.112	adding resilin to those fibers.
707.311	By doing that,
708.632	we've been able to make a superfiber
711.454	which is about 380 percent tougher,
714.775	and 300 percent more elastic.
718.133	So oddly enough, in the future,
720.615	when a patient is transplanted
720.615	with artificial tendons or ligaments
725.599	made from these fibers,
727.809	we'll have better performance
727.809	after the surgery
730.956	than we had before the injury.
733.642	So what's for the future?
735.391	In the future, we believe
735.391	we'll be able to make
738.416	many nanobio building blocks
738.416	that nature provided for us --
742.017	collagen, nanocellulose,
742.017	resilin and many more.
746.23	And that will enable us to make
746.23	better machines perform better,
750.097	even the heart.
751.651	Now, this heart
751.651	is not going to be the same
754.121	as we can get from a donor.
756.977	It will be better.
758.834	It actually will perform better
760.89	and will last longer.
762.945	My friend Zion Suliman once told me
765.414	a smart sentence.
768.301	"He said, ""If you want a new idea,"
771.362	"you should open an old book."""
773.431	And I'm going to say
773.431	that the book was written.
777.815	It was written over three billion years
779.98	of evolution.
781.566	And the text is the DNA of life.
785.923	All we have to do
787.816	is read this text,
790.156	embrace nature's gift to us
792.737	and start our progress from here.
795.252	Thank you.
796.437	(Applause)
