13.707	People back home call me a heckler,
16.596	a troublemaker, an irritant,
19.313	a rebel, an activist,
21.983	the voice of the people.
23.84	But that wasn't always me.
26.65	Growing up, I had a nickname.
28.182	They used to call me Softy,
30.502	meaning the soft, harmless boy.
33.755	Like every other human being,
33.755	I avoided trouble.
36.495	In my childhood, they taught me silence.
38.538	Don't argue, do as you're told.
40.34	In Sunday school, they taught me
40.34	don't confront, don't argue,
44.272	even if you're right,
44.272	turn the other cheek.
47.585	This was reinforced
47.585	by the political climate of the time.
52.182	(Laughter)
55.783	Kenya is a country
55.783	where you are guilty
57.592	until proven rich.
60.239	(Laughter)
62.984	Kenya's poor are five times more likely
65.726	to be shot dead by the police
65.726	who are meant to protect them
68.65	than by criminals.
70.298	This was reinforced
70.298	by the political climate of the day.
72.945	We had a president,
72.945	Moi, who was a dictator.
75.894	He ruled the country with an iron fist,
78.1	and anyone who dared
78.1	question his authority
80.538	was arrested, tortured,
80.538	jailed or even killed.
85.507	That meant that people were taught
85.507	to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.
89.431	Being a coward was not an insult.
91.474	Being a coward was a compliment.
93.401	We used to be told that a coward
93.401	goes home to his mother.
96.559	What that meant: that if you stayed
96.559	out of trouble you're going to stay alive.
100.32	I used to question this advice,
102.26	and eight years ago
102.26	we had an election in Kenya,
105.082	and the results were violently disputed.
107.565	What followed that election
107.565	was terrible violence, rape,
112.302	and the killing of over 1,000 people.
116.239	My work was to document the violence.
119.36	As a photographer,
119.36	I took thousands of images,
122.216	and after two months,
124.283	the two politicians came together,
124.283	had a cup of tea,
129.158	signed a peace agreement,
129.158	and the country moved on.
132.595	I was a very disturbed man
132.595	because I saw the violence firsthand.
136.124	I saw the killings.
136.124	I saw the displacement.
139.73	I met women who had been raped,
139.73	and it disturbed me,
142.811	but the country never spoke about it.
144.855	We pretended. We all became smart cowards.
147.339	We decided to stay out of trouble
147.339	and not talk about it.
150.938	Ten months later, I quit my job.
150.938	I said I could not stand it anymore.
154.235	After quitting my job,
154.235	I decided to organize my friends
156.83	to speak about
156.83	the violence in the country,
158.85	to speak about the state of the nation,
160.714	and June 1, 2009 was the day
160.714	that we were meant to go to the stadium
164.83	and try and get the president's attention.
166.889	It's a national holiday,
168.329	it's broadcast across the country,
169.978	and I showed up at the stadium.
173.386	My friends did not show up.
176.38	I found myself alone,
179.753	and I didn't know what to do.
182.28	I was scared,
183.695	but I knew very well
183.695	that that particular day,
185.865	I had to make a decision.
187.086	Was I able to live as a coward,
187.086	like everyone else,
189.509	or was I going to make a stand?
191.107	And when the president stood up to speak,
193.313	I found myself on my feet
193.313	shouting at the president,
197.92	telling him to remember
197.92	the post-election violence victims,
201.114	to stop the corruption.
203.39	And suddenly, out of nowhere,
205.595	the police pounced on me
205.595	like hungry lions.
208.707	They held my mouth
210.564	and dragged me out of the stadium,
212.491	where they thoroughly beat me up
212.491	and locked me up in jail.
217.112	I spent that night in
217.112	a cold cement floor in the jail,
223.87	and that got me thinking.
226.518	What was making me feel this way?
228.389	My friends and family thought
228.389	I was crazy because of what I did,
231.554	and the images that I took
231.554	were disturbing my life.
236.568	The images that I took
236.568	were just a number to many Kenyans.
239.518	Most Kenyans did not see the violence.
241.465	It was a story to them.
243.16	And so I decided to actually
243.16	start a street exhibition
245.947	to show the images of the violence
245.947	across the country
248.733	and get people talking about it.
250.707	We traveled the country
250.707	and showed the images,
253.516	and this was a journey that has started me
253.516	to the activist path,
256.999	where I decided to become silent no more,
259.716	to talk about those things.
261.914	We traveled, and our general site
261.914	from our street exhibit
265.564	became for political graffiti
265.564	about the situation in the country,
270.362	talking about corruption, bad leadership.
273.12	We have even done symbolic burials.
276.9	We have delivered live pigs
276.9	to Kenya's parliament
280.882	as a symbol of our politicians' greed.
282.81	It has been done in Uganda
282.81	and other countries,
285.041	and what is most powerful is that
285.041	the images have been picked by the media
288.55	and amplified across the country,
288.55	across the continent.
291.586	Where I used to stand up alone
291.586	seven years ago,
294.233	now I belong to a community
294.233	of many people who stand up with me.
297.259	I am no longer alone when I stand up
297.259	to speak about these things.
302.177	I belong to a group of young people
302.177	who are passionate about the country,
306.35	who want to bring about change,
308.2	and they're no longer afraid,
308.2	and they're no longer smart cowards.
313.744	So that was my story.
318.242	That day in the stadium,
320.84	I stood up as a smart coward.
323.327	By that one action, I said goodbye
323.327	to the 24 years living as a coward.
328.574	There are two most powerful
328.574	days in your life:
331.616	the day you're born,
331.616	and the day you discover why.
336.771	That day standing up in that stadium
336.771	shouting at the President,
340.015	I discovered why I was truly born,
343.295	that I would no longer be silent
343.295	in the face of injustice.
347.776	Do you know why you were born?
351.7	Thank you.
353.535	(Applause)
360.524	Tom Rielly: It's an amazing story.
363.031	I just want to ask you
363.031	a couple quick questions.
365.587	So PAWA254:
367.907	you've created a studio, a place
367.907	where young people can go
372.22	and harness the power of digital media
374.176	to do some of this action.
376.687	What's happening now with PAWA?
378.564	Boniface Mwangi: So we have 
378.564	this community of filmmakers,
381.347	graffiti artists, musicians,
381.347	and when there's an issue in the country,
384.71	we come together, we brainstorm,
384.71	and take up on that issue.
387.511	So our most powerful tool is art,
389.567	because we live in a very busy world
389.567	where people are so busy in their life,
393.398	and they don't have time to read.
395.465	So we package our activism
395.465	and we package our message in art.
399.598	So from the music, the graffiti, 
399.598	the art, that's what we do.
405.557	Can I say one more thing?
407.585	TR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)
409.466	BM: In spite of being arrested,
409.466	beaten up, threatened,
412.101	the moment I discovered my voice,
413.814	that I could actually stand up
413.814	for what I really believed in,
416.71	I'm no longer afraid.
417.748	I used to be called softy,
417.748	but I'm no longer softy,
420.49	because I discovered who I really am,
420.49	as in, that's what I want to do,
423.891	and there's such beauty in doing that.
426.927	There's nothing as powerful as that,
426.927	knowing that I'm meant to do this,
430.316	because you don't get scared,
430.316	you just continue living your life.
433.463	Thank you.
435.649	(Applause)
