13.424	It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
17.325	I was working at the ACLU
17.325	as the organization's science advisor.
21.388	I really, really loved my job,
24.019	but I was having one of those days
25.679	where I was feeling
25.679	just a little bit discouraged.
29.265	So I wandered down the hallway
29.265	to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.
34.367	Chris had been at the ACLU
34.367	for more than 30 years,
38.045	so he had deep institutional
38.045	knowledge and insights.
41.64	I explained to Chris
41.64	that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
45.512	I had been investigating
45.512	a number of issues
47.718	at the intersection of science
47.718	and civil liberties -- super interesting.
53.043	But I wanted the ACLU to engage
53.043	these issues in a much bigger way,
56.977	in a way that could really
56.977	make a difference.
61.603	So Chris cut right
61.603	to the chase, and he says,
63.727	"""Well, of all the issues you've been"
63.727	"looking at, what are the top five?"""
67.524	"""Well, there's genetic discrimination,"
70.204	and reproductive technologies,
72.653	and biobanking, and ...
74.818	oh, there's this really cool issue,
76.684	functional MRI and using it
76.684	for lie detection, and ...
79.357	"oh, and of course, there's gene patents."""
81.502	"""Gene patents?"""
83.967	"""Yes, you know, patents on human genes."""
86.073	"""No!"
87.603	You're telling me that the US government
90.088	has been issuing patents
90.088	on part of the human body?
93.543	"That can't be right."""
95.861	I went back to my office
95.861	and sent Chris three articles.
99.954	And 20 minutes later,
99.954	he came bursting in my office.
103.305	"""Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"""
107.33	(Laughter)
109.713	Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,
112.111	but he knew almost nothing
112.111	about patent law
115.044	and certainly nothing about genetics.
117.504	I knew something about genetics,
117.504	but I wasn't even a lawyer,
120.406	let alone a patent lawyer.
122.091	So clearly we had a lot to learn
122.091	before we could file a lawsuit.
126.036	First, we needed to understand
126.036	exactly what was patented
128.918	when someone patented a gene.
131.679	Gene patents typically contain
131.679	dozens of claims,
135.525	but the most controversial of these
135.525	"are to so-called ""isolated DNA"" --"
140.699	namely, a piece of DNA
140.699	that has been removed from a cell.
146.073	Gene patent proponents say,
147.396	"""See? We didn't patent"
147.396	the gene in your body,
150.594	"we patented an isolated gene."""
153.148	And that's true,
154.373	but the problem is that any use
154.373	of the gene requires that it be isolated.
162.51	And the patents weren't just
162.51	to a particular gene that they isolated,
166.939	but on every possible
166.939	version of that gene.
170.183	So what does that mean?
171.981	That means that you can't give
171.981	your gene to your doctor
175.067	and ask him or her to look at it,
177.387	say, to see if it has any mutations,
179.511	without permission of the patent holder.
182.363	It also means that the patent holder
182.363	has the right to stop anyone
186.58	from using that gene
186.58	in research or clinical testing.
190.871	Allowing patent holders,
192.593	often private companies,
193.901	to lock up stretches of the human genome
193.901	was harming patients.
198.958	Consider Abigail,
200.134	a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,
202.551	a serious heart condition that,
202.551	if left untreated,
205.999	can result in sudden death.
208.911	The company that obtained a patent on two
208.911	genes associated with this condition
212.857	developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.
215.363	But then they went bankrupt
215.363	and they never offered it.
219.06	So another lab tried to offer the test,
221.012	but the company that held the patents
221.012	threatened to sue the lab
224.024	for patent infringement.
225.23	So as a result,
226.413	for 2 years, no test was available.
230.291	During that time,
231.465	Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.
235.776	Gene patents clearly were a problem
235.776	and were harming patients.
239.467	But was there a way
239.467	we could challenge them?
242.266	Turns out that the Supreme Court
244.022	has made clear
244.022	through a long line of cases,
247.16	that certain things
247.16	are not patent eligible.
250.925	You can't patent products of nature --
254.148	the air, the water, minerals,
254.148	elements of the periodic table.
259.17	And you can't patent laws of nature --
262.193	the law of gravity, E = mc2.
264.909	These things are just too fundamental
264.909	and must remain free to all
269.739	and reserved exclusively to none.
272.348	It seemed to us that DNA,
274.519	the most fundamental structure of life,
277.059	that codes for the production
277.059	of all of our proteins,
279.739	is both a product of nature
279.739	and a law of nature,
282.989	regardless of whether it's in our bodies
285.715	or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.
288.523	As we delved into this issue,
290.002	we traveled all over the country
290.002	to speak with many different experts --
294.588	scientists, medical professionals,
294.588	lawyers, patent lawyers.
298.753	Most of them agreed that we were right
298.753	as a matter of policy,
302.687	and, at least in theory,
302.687	as a matter of law.
306.313	All of them thought
307.492	our chances of winning
307.492	a gene-patent challenge
310.086	were about zero.
313.628	Why is that?
315.015	Well, the patent office
315.015	had been issuing these patents
318.126	for more than 20 years.
320.686	There were literally thousands
320.686	of patents on human genes.
324.843	The patent bar was deeply
324.843	entrenched in the status quo,
328.581	the biotech industry had grown up
328.581	around this practice,
332.228	and legislation to ban gene patents
332.228	had been introduced
335.371	year after year in Congress,
336.793	and had gone absolutely nowhere.
339.401	So the bottom line:
341.027	courts just weren't going to be willing
341.027	to overturn these patents.
344.916	Now, neither Chris nor I were the type
344.916	to shy away from a challenge,
349.535	"and hearing, ""Being right"
349.535	"just isn't enough,"""
352.703	seemed all the more reason
352.703	to take on this fight.
356.311	So we set out to build our case.
359.494	Now, patent cases tend to be:
359.494	Company A sues Company B
363.008	over some really narrow,
363.008	obscure technical issue.
366.822	We weren't really interested
366.822	in that kind of case,
369.211	and we thought this case
369.211	was much bigger than that.
371.624	This was about scientific freedom,
371.624	medical progress,
374.136	the rights of patients.
375.619	So we decided we were going
375.619	to develop a case
378.746	that was not like
378.746	your typical patent case --
381.645	more like a civil rights case.
384.756	We set out to identify
384.756	a gene-patent holder
387.622	that was vigorously enforcing its patents
390.431	and then to organize a broad coalition
390.431	of plaintiffs and experts
393.749	that could tell the court
395.663	about all the ways that these patents
395.663	were harming patients and innovation.
401.404	We found the prime candidate
401.404	to sue in Myriad Genetics,
404.55	a company that's based
404.55	in Salt Lake City, Utah.
408.718	Myriad held patents on two genes,
410.992	the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
415.15	Women with certain mutations
415.15	along these genes
417.908	are considered to be
417.908	at a significantly increased risk
420.558	of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
423.834	Myriad had used its patents to maintain
425.738	a complete monopoly on BRCA testing
425.738	in the United States.
430.544	It had forced multiple labs
430.544	that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
434.756	It charged a lot of money for its test --
436.939	over 3,000 dollars.
439.089	It had stopped sharing its clinical data
441.448	with the international
441.448	scientific community.
444.522	And perhaps worst of all,
446.449	for a period of several years,
448.909	Myriad refused to update its test
448.909	to include additional mutations
452.646	that had been identified
452.646	by a team of researchers in France.
456.974	It has been estimated
456.974	that during that period,
459.506	for several years,
460.903	as many as 12 percent of women
460.903	undergoing testing
464.679	received the wrong answer --
468.377	a negative test result
468.377	that should have been positive.
473.485	This is Kathleen Maxian.
476.172	Kathleen's sister Eileen
476.172	developed breast cancer at age 40
479.453	and she was tested by Myriad.
482.032	The test was negative.
483.782	The family was relieved.
485.332	That meant that Eileen's cancer
485.332	most likely didn't run in the family,
489.144	and that other members of her family
489.144	didn't need to be tested.
492.843	But two years later,
494.097	Kathleen was diagnosed
494.097	with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
498.927	It turned out that Kathleen's sister
498.927	was among the 12 percent
502.823	who received a false-negative test result.
506.347	Had Eileen received the proper result,
509.46	Kathleen would have then been tested,
511.857	and her ovarian cancer
511.857	could have been prevented.
516.818	Once we settled on Myriad,
518.106	we then had to form a coalition
518.106	of plaintiffs and experts
522.015	that could illuminate these problems.
524.127	We ended up with 20
524.127	highly committed plaintiffs:
527.325	genetic counselors,
528.887	geneticists who had received
528.887	cease and desist letters,
532.905	advocacy organizations,
535.532	four major scientific organizations
535.532	that collectively represented
538.621	more than 150,000 scientists
538.621	and medical professionals,
542.755	and individual women who either
542.755	couldn't afford Myriad's test,
546.076	or who wanted to obtain
546.076	a second opinion but could not,
549.104	as a result of the patents.
552.315	One of the major challenges
552.315	we had in preparing the case
555.779	was figuring out how best
555.779	to communicate the science.
559.079	So in order to argue that what Myriad did
559.079	was not an invention,
562.934	and that isolated BRCA genes
562.934	were products of nature,
567.124	we had to explain a couple
567.124	of basic concepts, like:
569.861	What's a gene? What's DNA?
572.029	How is DNA isolated,
572.029	and why isn't that an invention?
577.168	We spent hours and hours
577.168	with our plaintiffs and experts,
581.054	trying to come up with ways
581.054	of explaining these concepts
584.014	simply yet accurately.
586.306	And we ended up relying heavily
586.306	on the use of metaphors,
589.662	like gold.
591.789	So isolating DNA --
594.097	it's like extracting gold from a mountain
597.105	or taking it out of a stream bed.
599.145	You might be able to patent
599.145	the process for mining the gold,
602.843	but you can't patent the gold itself.
605.929	It might've taken a lot
605.929	of hard work and effort
608.696	to dig the gold out of the mountain;
611.127	you still can't patent it,
611.127	it's still gold.
613.432	And the gold, once it's extracted,
615.212	can clearly be used
615.212	for all sorts of things
617.324	that it couldn't be used
617.324	for when it was in the mountain;
620.084	you can make jewelry
620.084	out of it for example --
622.29	still can't patent the gold,
622.29	it's still gold.
625.364	So now it's 2009,
625.364	and we're ready to file our case.
630.286	We filed in federal court
630.286	in the Southern District of New York,
634.355	and the case was randomly assigned
634.355	to Judge Robert Sweet.
638.599	In March 2010, Judge Sweet
638.599	issued his opinion --
644.834	and a complete victory for our side.
647.964	In reading the opinion,
649.419	we could not get over how eloquently
649.419	he described the science in the case.
654.504	I mean, our brief --
654.504	it was pretty good,
657.299	but not this good.
659.778	How did he develop such a deep
659.778	understanding of this issue
663.179	in such a short time?
664.363	We just could not comprehend
664.363	how this had happened.
667.995	So it turned out,
669.283	Judge Sweet's clerk
669.283	working for him at the time,
672.617	was not just a lawyer --
674.121	he was a scientist.
675.859	He was not just a scientist --
677.481	he had a PhD in molecular biology.
680.651	(Laughter)
682.426	What an incredible stroke of luck!
686.058	Myriad then appealed
687.382	to the US Court of Appeals
687.382	for the Federal Circuit.
690.496	And here things got really interesting.
693.465	First, in a pivotal moment of this case,
697.187	the US government switched sides.
700.739	So in the district court the government
700.739	submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
704.512	But now in direct opposition
704.512	to its own patent office,
709.664	the US government files a brief
709.664	that states that is has
712.396	reconsidered this issue
712.396	in light of the district court's opinion,
716.108	and has concluded that isolated DNA
716.108	is not patent eligible.
719.818	This was a really big deal,
721.653	totally unexpected.
724.773	The Court of Appeals
724.773	for the Federal Circuit
726.877	hears all patent cases,
728.584	and it has a reputation for being
728.584	very, very pro-patent.
732.305	So even with this remarkable development,
734.755	we expected to lose.
736.458	And we did.
738.389	Sort of.
740.357	Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.
743.743	But the two judges who ruled against us,
746.263	did so for completely different reasons.
749.275	The first one, Judge Lourie,
751.125	made up his own novel,
751.125	biological theory --
754.164	totally wrong.
755.356	(Laughter)
756.391	He decided Myriad had created
756.391	a new chemical --
758.633	made absolutely no sense.
760.522	Myriad didn't even argue this,
760.522	so it came out of the blue.
763.632	The other, Judge Moore,
765.633	said she basically agreed with us
765.633	that isolated DNA is a product of nature.
769.987	"But she's like, ""I don't want"
769.987	"to shake up the biotech industry."""
774.248	The third, Judge Bryson,
777.233	agreed with us.
779.75	So now we sought review
779.75	by the Supreme Court.
782.305	And when you petition the Supreme Court,
785.032	you have to present a question
785.032	that you want the Court to answer.
788.534	Usually these questions take the form
788.534	of a super-long paragraph,
792.285	like a whole page long
792.285	with lots and lots of clauses,
795.332	"""wherein this"" and ""therefore that."""
798.294	We submitted perhaps
798.294	the shortest question presented ever.
803.312	Four words:
806.22	Are human genes patentable?
808.922	Now when Chris first asked me
808.922	what I thought of these words,
811.77	"I said, ""Well, I don't know."
813.168	I think you have to say,
813.168	"'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"""
816.968	"""Nope."
818.487	I want the justices to have
818.487	the very same reaction that I had
823.132	when you brought this issue
823.132	"to me seven years ago."""
826.896	Well, I certainly couldn't
826.896	argue with that.
829.981	The Supreme Court only hears
829.981	about one percent
832.888	of the cases that it receives,
834.578	and it agreed to hear ours.
837.772	The day of the oral argument arrives,
837.772	and it was really, really exciting --
841.923	long line of people outside,
843.382	people had been standing in line
843.382	since 2:30 in the morning
846.17	to try to get into the courthouse.
847.928	Two breast cancer organizations,
849.923	Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,
851.615	had organized a demonstration
851.615	on the courthouse steps.
855.232	Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,
858.776	moments before he was to walk in and argue
861.814	the most important case of his career.
864.765	I was clearly more nervous than he was.
868.096	But any remaining panic subsided
868.096	as I walked into the courtroom
872.88	and looked around
872.88	at a sea of friendly faces:
876.059	our individual women clients
877.848	who had shared their
877.848	deeply personal stories,
881.21	the geneticists who had taken huge chunks
881.21	of time out of their busy careers
884.86	to dedicate themselves to this fight
887.122	and representatives from a diverse array
889.725	of medical, patient advocacy,
891.636	environmental and religious organizations,
893.736	who had submitted friend of the court
893.736	briefs in the case.
898.609	Also in the room were three leaders
898.609	of the Human Genome Project,
901.658	including the co-discoverer
901.658	of DNA himself,
904.354	James Watson,
905.668	who had submitted a brief to the court,
907.838	where he referred
907.838	"to gene patenting as ""lunacy."""
911.373	(Laughter)
913.245	The diversity of the communities
913.245	represented in this room
916.906	and the contributions each had made
916.906	to make this day a reality
920.371	spoke volumes to what was at stake.
923.386	The argument itself was riveting.
926.205	Chris argued brilliantly.
927.892	But for me,
929.161	the most thrilling aspect was watching
929.161	the Supreme Court justices grapple
932.949	with isolated DNA,
934.542	through a series of colorful analogies
934.542	and feisty exchanges,
937.792	very much the same way
937.792	as our legal team had done
941.156	for the past seven years.
943.666	Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA
946.346	to extracting a medicinal plant
946.346	from the Amazon.
950.516	Justice Roberts distinguished it
950.516	from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
955.995	And in one of my absolutely
955.995	favorite moments,
958.501	Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA
958.501	"to be ""just nature sitting there."""
963.794	(Laughter)
965.318	We felt pretty confident
965.318	leaving the courtroom that day,
968.217	but I could never have
968.217	anticipated the outcome:
972.574	nine to zero.
975.025	"""A naturally occurring DNA segment"
975.025	is a product of nature,
978.771	and not patent-eligible merely because
978.771	it has been isolated.
982.394	And furthermore,
983.765	"Myriad did not create anything."""
988.16	Within 24 hours of the decision,
990.18	five labs had announced
991.596	that they would begin to offer testing
991.596	for the BRCA genes.
995.149	Some of them promised to offer the tests
995.149	at a lower price than Myriad's.
999.142	Some promised to provide
999.142	a more comprehensive test
1002.086	than the one Myriad was offering.
1004.49	But of course the decision
1004.49	goes far beyond Myriad.
1007.352	It ends a 25-year practice
1007.352	of allowing patents on human genes
1011.772	in the United States.
1013.383	It clears a significant barrier
1013.383	to biomedical discovery and innovation.
1018.484	And it helps to ensure that patients
1018.484	like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen
1023.409	have access to the tests that they need.
1026.991	A few weeks after the court
1026.991	issued its decision,
1030.23	I received a small package in the mail.
1033.246	It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,
1034.877	a professor at Duke University
1037.17	and one the very first people
1037.17	Chris and I went to visit
1040.418	when we started to consider
1040.418	whether to bring this case.
1044.033	I opened it up to find
1044.033	a small stuffed animal.
1048.344	(Laughter)
1053.568	We took a big risk in taking this case.
1056.722	Part of what gave us the courage
1056.722	to take that risk
1059.256	was knowing that we were doing
1059.256	the right thing.
1062.079	The process took nearly eight years
1062.079	from the start to finish,
1065.833	with many twists and turns along the way.
1068.578	A little luck certainly helped,
1070.888	but it was the communities
1070.888	that we bridged,
1073.724	the alliances that we created,
1075.839	that made pigs fly.
1077.802	Thank you.
1078.982	(Applause)
