12.39	I coined my own definition
12.39	of success in 1934,
16.786	when I was teaching at a high school
16.786	in South Bend, Indiana,
19.747	being a little bit disappointed,
19.747	and [disillusioned] perhaps,
24.531	by the way parents of the youngsters
24.531	in my English classes
28.602	expected their youngsters
28.602	to get an A or a B.
32.475	They thought a C was all right
32.475	for the neighbors' children,
35.396	because they were all average.
37.387	But they weren't satisfied
37.387	when their own --
39.546	it would make the teacher feel that they
39.546	had failed, or the youngster had failed.
43.538	And that's not right.
44.745	The good Lord in his infinite
44.745	wisdom didn't create us all equal
47.762	as far as intelligence is concerned,
49.523	any more than we're equal
49.523	for size, appearance.
52.022	Not everybody could earn an A or a B,
52.022	and I didn't like that way of judging,
55.731	and I did know how
55.731	the alumni of various schools
59.864	back in the '30s judged
59.864	coaches and athletic teams.
63.523	If you won them all, you were considered
63.523	to be reasonably successful --
68.573	not completely.
69.751	Because I found out --
71.148	we had a number of years at UCLA
71.148	where we didn't lose a game.
74.535	But it seemed that we didn't win
74.535	each individual game
77.058	by the margin that some
77.058	of our alumni had predicted --
81.048	(Laughter)
84.16	And quite frequently I really felt
84.16	that they had backed up their predictions
87.756	in a more materialistic manner.
90.335	(Laughter)
91.517	But that was true back
91.517	in the 30s, so I understood that.
94.763	But I didn't like it,
94.763	I didn't agree with it.
96.947	I wanted to come up with something
96.947	I hoped could make me a better teacher,
100.51	and give the youngsters
100.51	under my supervision,
102.654	be it in athletics
102.654	or the English classroom,
104.796	something to which to aspire,
106.286	other than just a higher
106.286	mark in the classroom,
109.853	or more points in some athletic contest.
112.507	I thought about that for quite a spell,
114.894	and I wanted to come
114.894	up with my own definition.
117.139	I thought that might help.
118.708	And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,
121.16	as the accumulation
121.16	of material possessions
123.232	or the attainment of a position of power
123.232	or prestige, or something of that sort,
127.613	worthy accomplishments perhaps,
129.549	but in my opinion, not necessarily
129.549	indicative of success.
133.059	So I wanted to come up
133.059	with something of my own.
135.47	And I recalled --
137.357	I was raised on a small farm
137.357	in Southern Indiana,
139.708	and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers
141.717	that you should never try to be
141.717	better than someone else.
145.04	I'm sure at the time he did
145.04	that, I didn't -- it didn't --
148.509	well, somewhere, I guess
148.509	in the hidden recesses of the mind,
151.683	it popped out years later.
153.16	Never try to be better than someone else,
155.16	always learn from others.
156.637	Never cease trying to be
156.637	the best you can be --
159.034	that's under your control.
160.675	If you get too engrossed
160.675	and involved and concerned
163.16	in regard to the things
163.16	over which you have no control,
165.804	it will adversely affect the things
165.804	over which you have control.
169.543	Then I ran across
169.543	this simple verse that said,
172.044	"""At God's footstool to confess,"
174.061	a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.
176.408	'I failed!' he cried.
178.066	The Master said, 'Thou didst
178.066	"thy best, that is success.'"""
182.16	From those things, and one other perhaps,
184.16	I coined my own definition
184.16	of success, which is:
186.937	Peace of mind attained only
186.937	through self-satisfaction
190.247	in knowing you made the effort to do
190.247	the best of which you're capable.
194.01	I believe that's true.
195.318	If you make the effort to do
195.318	the best of which you're capable,
198.269	trying to improve the situation
198.269	that exists for you,
200.926	I think that's success,
202.103	and I don't think others can judge that;
204.112	it's like character and reputation --
205.911	your reputation
205.911	is what you're perceived to be;
208.786	your character is what you really are.
210.668	And I think that character
210.668	is much more important
213.866	than what you are perceived to be.
215.66	You'd hope they'd both be good,
217.438	but they won't necessarily be the same.
220.159	Well, that was my idea that I was going
220.159	to try to get across to the youngsters.
224.16	I ran across other things.
225.636	I love to teach, and it was
225.636	mentioned by the previous speaker
230.77	that I enjoy poetry,
230.77	and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.
233.945	There are some things
233.945	that helped me, I think,
236.16	be better than I would have been.
237.96	I know I'm not what I ought
237.96	to be, what I should be,
240.554	but I think I'm better
240.554	than I would have been
242.711	if I hadn't run across certain things.
244.645	One was just a little verse that said,
248.495	"""No written word, no spoken plea"
252.571	can teach our youth what they should be;
255.16	nor all the books on all the shelves --
257.566	"it's what the teachers are themselves."""
259.818	That made an impression
259.818	on me in the 1930s.
263.635	And I tried to use that
263.635	more or less in my teaching,
267.934	whether it be in sports, or whether
267.934	it be in the English classroom.
272.53	I love poetry and always had
272.53	an interest in that somehow.
278.358	Maybe it's because Dad
278.358	used to read to us at night,
282.16	by coal oil lamp --
283.342	we didn't have electricity
283.342	in our farm home.
287.035	And Dad would read poetry to us.
287.035	So I always liked it.
289.622	And about the same time
289.622	I ran across this one verse,
292.16	I ran across another one.
293.851	Someone asked a lady teacher
293.851	why she taught,
297.691	and after some time, she said
297.691	she wanted to think about that.
300.755	Then she came up and said,
302.659	"""They ask me why I teach, and I reply,"
305.572	'Where could I find
305.572	such splendid company?'
308.096	There sits a statesman,
308.096	strong, unbiased, wise;
311.16	another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.
313.882	A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,
313.882	steady hand may mend a bone,
317.16	or stem the life-blood's flow.
320.16	And there a builder; upward rise
320.16	the arch of a church he builds,
323.232	wherein that minister
323.232	may speak the word of God,
325.692	and lead a stumbling soul
325.692	to touch the Christ.
328.16	And all about, a gathering of teachers,
330.159	farmers, merchants, laborers --
332.501	those who work and vote and build
334.177	and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.
336.572	And I may say, I may not see the church,
339.914	or hear the word, or eat
339.914	the food their hands may grow,
342.756	but yet again I may;
344.017	And later I may say,
345.192	I knew him once, and he was weak,
345.192	or strong, or bold or proud or gay.
349.271	I knew him once, but then he was a boy.
351.64	They ask me why I teach and I reply,
353.934	'Where could I find such
353.934	"splendid company?'"""
356.608	And I believe the teaching profession --
358.56	it's true, you have so many youngsters,
360.646	and I've got to think
360.646	of my youngsters at UCLA --
367.895	many, many teachers and other professions.
371.16	And that gives you
371.16	a great deal of pleasure,
374.982	to see them go on.
376.61	I always tried to make the youngsters feel
376.61	that they're there to get an education,
380.698	number one; basketball was second,
380.698	because it was paying their way,
383.926	and they do need a little time
383.926	for social activities,
386.457	but you let social activities take
386.457	a little precedence over the other two,
390.068	and you're not going
390.068	to have any very long.
392.421	So that was the idea
392.421	that I tried to get across
397.16	to the youngsters under my supervision.
399.611	I had three rules, pretty much,
401.441	that I stuck with
401.441	practically all the time.
403.786	I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,
403.786	and I decided they were very important.
407.738	"One was ""Never be late."""
411.662	Later on I said certain things --
415.931	the players, if we were leaving
415.931	for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.
420.16	There was a time when I made them
420.16	wear jackets and shirts and ties.
426.16	Then I saw our chancellor coming
426.16	to school in denims and turtlenecks,
431.969	and thought, it's not right for me to keep
431.969	this other [rule] so I let them just --
435.96	they had to be neat and clean.
437.564	I had one of my greatest players
437.564	that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.
442.217	He came to catch the bus; we were
442.217	leaving for somewhere to play.
445.934	And he wasn't clean and neat,
445.934	so I wouldn't let him go.
449.288	He couldn't get on the bus,
450.696	he had to go home and get cleaned up
452.63	to get to the airport.
454.781	So I was a stickler for that.
454.781	I believed in that.
457.16	I believe in time; very important.
459.068	I believe you should be on time,
459.068	but I felt at practice, for example --
462.74	we start on time, we close on time.
464.78	The youngsters didn't have to feel
464.78	that we were going to keep them over.
468.201	When I speak at coaching clinics,
468.201	I often tell young coaches --
471.217	and at coaching clinics, more or less,
473.381	they'll be the younger coaches
473.381	getting in the profession.
476.389	Most of them are young, you know,
476.389	and probably newly-married.
479.897	And I tell them,
479.897	"""Don't run practices late,"
482.936	because you'll go home in a bad mood,
484.989	and that's not good, for a young
484.989	married man to go home in a bad mood.
488.361	When you get older, it doesn't
488.361	"make any difference, but --"""
491.352	(Laughter)
495.16	So I did believe: on time.
496.451	I believe starting on time,
496.451	and I believe closing on time.
499.6	And another one I had was,
499.6	not one word of profanity.
502.16	One word of profanity,
502.16	and you are out of here for the day.
507.16	If I see it in a game, you're going
507.16	to come out and sit on the bench.
510.47	And the third one was,
510.47	never criticize a teammate.
513.16	I didn't want that. I used to tell
513.16	them I was paid to do that.
516.16	That's my job. I'm paid to do it.
516.16	Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.
520.16	Not like the coaches today,
520.16	for gracious sakes, no.
523.16	It's a little different
523.16	than it was in my day.
526.572	Those were three things that I stuck
526.572	with pretty closely all the time.
531.277	And those actually came from my dad.
533.919	That's what he tried to teach
533.919	me and my brothers at one time.
538.84	I came up with a pyramid eventually,
541.738	that I don't have the time to go on that.
544.468	But that helped me, I think,
544.468	become a better teacher.
547.722	It's something like this:
549.667	And I had blocks in the pyramid,
551.889	and the cornerstones being
551.889	industriousness and enthusiasm,
555.16	working hard and enjoying
555.16	what you're doing,
557.28	coming up to the apex,
559.16	according to my definition of success.
562.16	And right at the top, faith and patience.
564.517	And I say to you,
564.517	in whatever you're doing,
566.946	you must be patient.
568.13	You have to have patience to --
568.13	we want things to happen.
571.904	We talk about our youth
571.904	being impatient a lot, and they are.
575.999	They want to change everything.
575.999	They think all change is progress.
579.165	And we get a little older --
579.165	we sort of let things go.
581.76	And we forget there is
581.76	no progress without change.
584.395	So you must have patience,
585.809	and I believe that we must have faith.
587.819	I believe that we must
587.819	believe, truly believe.
590.478	Not just give it word service,
592.462	believe that things
592.462	will work out as they should,
595.16	providing we do what we should.
597.498	I think our tendency is to hope things
597.498	will turn out the way we want them to
602.191	much of the time,
603.478	but we don't do the things
603.478	that are necessary
606.841	to make those things become reality.
610.16	I worked on this for some 14 years,
612.16	and I think it helped me
612.16	become a better teacher.
615.16	But it all revolved around that
615.16	original definition of success.
619.338	You know, a number of years ago,
621.407	there was a Major League Baseball
621.407	umpire by the name of George Moriarty.
625.16	He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.
628.771	I'd never seen that before, but he did.
630.706	Big league baseball players --
632.547	they're very perceptive
632.547	about those things,
634.642	and they noticed he had
634.642	only one 'i' in his name.
637.16	You'd be surprised how many also told him
640.808	that that was one more
640.808	than he had in his head
643.16	at various times.
644.341	(Laughter)
646.113	But he wrote something
646.113	where I think he did
648.183	what I tried to do in this pyramid.
649.923	"He called it ""The Road"
649.923	"Ahead, or the Road Behind."""
652.35	"He said, ""Sometimes I think the Fates"
652.35	must grin as we denounce them and insist
656.16	the only reason we can't win,
656.16	is the Fates themselves have missed.
660.373	Yet there lives on the ancient claim:
662.16	we win or lose within ourselves.
663.913	The shining trophies on our shelves
663.913	can never win tomorrow's game.
667.16	You and I know deeper down, there's
667.16	always a chance to win the crown.
670.47	But when we fail to give our best,
672.16	we simply haven't met the test,
672.16	of giving all and saving none
675.263	until the game is really won;
677.01	of showing what is meant by grit;
679.428	of playing through when others quit;
681.532	of playing through, not letting up.
683.26	It's bearing down that wins the cup.
685.023	Of dreaming there's a goal ahead;
685.023	of hoping when our dreams are dead;
688.404	of praying when our hopes have fled;
688.404	yet losing, not afraid to fall,
692.16	if, bravely, we have given all.
693.995	For who can ask more of a man
693.995	than giving all within his span.
697.874	Giving all, it seems to me,
697.874	is not so far from victory.
702.16	And so the Fates are seldom wrong,
702.16	no matter how they twist and wind.
705.47	It's you and I who make our fates --
708.16	we open up or close the gates
708.16	"on the road ahead or the road behind."""
712.16	Reminds me of another set of threes
712.16	that my dad tried to get across to us:
715.709	Don't whine. Don't complain.
715.709	Don't make excuses.
718.826	Just get out there,
720.088	and whatever you're doing,
720.088	do it to the best of your ability.
722.992	And no one can do more than that.
725.16	I tried to get across, too, that --
728.065	my opponents will tell you --
728.065	you never heard me mention winning.
731.169	Never mention winning.
732.722	My idea is that you can lose
732.722	when you outscore somebody in a game,
738.324	and you can win when you're outscored.
740.514	I've felt that way on certain
740.514	occasions, at various times.
744.16	And I just wanted them to be able
744.16	to hold their head up after a game.
749.47	I used to say that when a game is over,
752.16	and you see somebody
752.16	that didn't know the outcome,
754.565	I hope they couldn't tell by your actions
757.621	whether you outscored an opponent
757.621	or the opponent outscored you.
763.16	That's what really matters:
764.731	if you make an effort
764.731	to do the best you can regularly,
768.515	the results will be
768.515	about what they should be.
771.226	Not necessarily what you'd want them to be
771.226	but they'll be about what they should;
775.13	only you will know
775.13	whether you can do that.
777.16	And that's what I wanted
777.16	from them more than anything else.
780.832	And as time went by,
780.832	and I learned more about other things,
783.634	I think it worked a little better,
785.515	as far as the results.
787.182	But I wanted the score of a game
787.182	to be the byproduct of these other things,
792.16	and not the end itself.
794.16	I believe it was one great
794.16	philosopher who said --
800.16	no, no -- Cervantes.
802.122	"Cervantes said, ""The journey"
802.122	"is better than the end."""
807.398	And I like that.
809.231	I think that it is --
809.231	it's getting there.
811.486	Sometimes when you get there,
811.486	there's almost a let down.
814.201	But it's the getting there that's the fun.
816.249	As a basketball coach at UCLA,
816.249	I liked our practices to be the journey,
821.027	and the game would be
821.027	the end, the end result.
824.341	I liked to go up and sit in the stands
824.341	and watch the players play,
827.523	and see whether I'd done
827.523	a decent job during the week.
832.16	There again, it's getting the players
832.16	to get that self-satisfaction,
835.767	in knowing that they'd made the effort
835.767	to do the best of which they are capable.
844.667	Sometimes I'm asked who was
844.667	the best player I had, or the best teams.
849.517	I can never answer that.
852.16	As far as the individuals are concerned --
855.16	I was asked one time about that,
858.16	and they said,
859.352	"""Suppose that you, in some way,"
859.352	could make the perfect player.
864.191	"What would you want?"""
865.375	"And I said, ""Well, I'd want"
865.375	one that knew why he was at UCLA:
868.375	to get an education,
868.375	he was a good student,
871.16	really knew why he was there
871.16	in the first place.
873.684	But I'd want one that could play, too.
875.574	I'd want one to realize that defense
875.574	usually wins championships,
879.763	and who would work hard on defense.
881.858	But I'd want one
881.858	who would play offense, too.
884.16	I'd want him to be unselfish,
886.461	and look for the pass first
886.461	and not shoot all the time.
889.628	And I'd want one
889.628	that could pass and would pass.
892.764	(Laughter)
893.985	I've had some that could and wouldn't,
895.929	and I've had some that would and could.
898.055	(Laughter)
899.714	So, yeah, I'd want that.
901.16	And I wanted them to be able
901.16	to shoot from the outside.
904.961	I wanted them to be good inside too.
907.342	(Laughter)
909.16	I'd want them to be able
909.16	to rebound well at both ends, too.
913.16	Why not just take someone like
913.16	Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.
917.16	He had the qualifications.
919.056	Not the only one, but he was one
919.056	that I used in that particular category,
923.787	because I think he made the effort
923.787	to become the best.
926.795	There was a couple.
927.985	I mention in my book,
927.985	"""They Call Me Coach,"""
930.955	two players that gave
930.955	me great satisfaction,
933.28	that came as close as I think anyone
933.28	I ever had to reach their full potential:
937.026	one was Conrad Burke,
937.026	and one was Doug McIntosh.
939.445	When I saw them as freshmen,
939.445	on our freshmen team --
942.963	freshmen couldn't play
942.963	varsity when I taught.
945.837	"I thought, ""Oh gracious, if these"
945.837	"two players, either one of them"" --"
949.161	they were different years, but I thought
949.161	about each one at the time he was there --
953.137	"""Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,"
955.16	our varsity must be pretty miserable,
955.16	"if he's good enough to make it."""
958.94	And you know, one of them was
958.94	a starting player for a season and a half.
964.895	The other one, his next year, played 32
964.895	minutes in a national championship game,
970.16	Did a tremendous job for us.
971.889	The next year, he was a starting player
971.889	on the national championship team,
975.788	and here I thought he'd never
975.788	play a minute, when he was --
978.994	so those are the things
978.994	that give you great joy,
983.695	and great satisfaction to see.
985.16	Neither one of those youngsters
985.16	could shoot very well.
988.16	But they had outstanding
988.16	shooting percentages,
990.375	because they didn't force it.
992.636	And neither one could jump very well,
995.342	but they kept good position,
995.342	and so they did well rebounding.
998.786	They remembered that every shot that's
998.786	taken, they assumed would be missed.
1002.494	I've had too many stand around
1002.494	and wait to see if it's missed,
1005.452	then they go and it's too late,
1005.452	somebody else is in there ahead of them.
1010.113	They weren't very quick,
1010.113	but they played good position,
1012.751	kept in good balance.
1014.16	And so they played
1014.16	pretty good defense for us.
1016.715	So they had qualities that --
1016.715	they came close to --
1019.892	as close to reaching
1019.892	possibly their full potential
1023.333	as any players I ever had.
1025.626	So I consider them to be as successful
1025.626	as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,
1032.127	or many of the others that we had;
1033.88	there were some outstanding players.
1038.777	Have I rambled enough?
1040.866	I was told that when he makes
1040.866	his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.
1045.017	(Laughter)
1046.311	(Applause)
