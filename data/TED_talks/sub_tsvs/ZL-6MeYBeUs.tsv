12.574	I recently read about
12.574	what the young generation of workers want
16.954	in Harvard Business Review.
18.829	One thing that stuck out to me
18.829	was: don't just talk about impact,
23.865	but make an impact.
26.542	I'm a little bit older than you,
29.352	maybe much older than you,
31.252	but this is exactly the same goal
31.252	that I had when I was in college.
37.301	I wanted to make my own impact
37.301	for those who live under injustice;
42.018	it's the reason that I became
42.018	a documentary journalist,
45.423	the reason I became
47.788	a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.
51.875	It was March 17, 2009.
55.226	It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,
58.266	but it was the day
58.266	that turned my life upside down.
63.346	My team and I were making a documentary
63.346	about North Korean refugees
67.971	living below human life in China.
72.901	We were at the border.
75.771	It was our last day of filming.
79.417	There was no wire fence
82.068	or bars
83.362	or sign to show that it is the border,
85.682	but this is a place that a lot
85.682	of North Korean defectors use
89.457	as an escape route.
92.554	It was still winter,
94.513	and the river was frozen.
97.559	When we were in the middle
97.559	of the frozen river,
101.205	we were filming about
101.205	the condition of the cold weather
104.141	and the environment
105.363	that North Koreans had to deal with
108.113	when they seek their freedom.
110.979	And suddenly, one
110.979	of my team members shouted,
114.138	"""Soldiers!"""
115.752	So I looked back,
117.478	and there were two small soldiers
117.478	in green uniforms with rifles,
123.15	chasing after us.
125.108	We all ran as fast as we could.
128.593	I prayed that, please
128.593	don't let them shoot my head.
132.242	And I was thinking that,
134.068	if my feet are on Chinese soil,
136.826	I'll be safe.
138.203	And I made it to Chinese soil.
141.244	Then I saw my colleague
141.244	Laura Ling fall on her knees.
146.251	I didn't know what to do
146.251	at that short moment,
148.891	but I knew that I could not
148.891	leave her alone there
151.542	when she said,
151.542	"""Euna, I can't feel my legs."""
155.68	In a flash, we were surrounded
155.68	by these two Korean soldiers.
160.507	They were not much bigger than us,
162.874	but they were determined
162.874	to take us to their army base.
167.599	I begged and yelled for any kind of help,
170.824	hoping that someone
170.824	would show up from China.
175.197	Here I was, being stubborn
177.784	towards a trained soldier with a gun.
180.32	I looked at his eyes.
184.445	He was just a boy.
186.854	At that moment,
186.854	he raised his rifle to hit me,
190.393	but I saw that he was hesitating.
192.559	His eyes were shaking,
194.358	and his rifle was still up in the air.
198.037	So I shouted at him,
200.323	"""OK, OK, I'll walk with you."""
203.235	And I got up.
206.089	When we arrived at their army base,
209.815	my head was spinning
209.815	with these worst-case scenarios,
213.735	and my colleague's
213.735	statement wasn't helping.
216.724	"She said, ""We are the enemy."""
219.771	She was right: we were the enemy.
223.671	And I was supposed to be frightened, too.
226.554	But I kept having these odd experiences.
229.554	This time, an officer brought me his coat
233.521	to keep me warm,
234.956	because I lost my coat on the frozen river
238.971	while battling with one of these soldiers.
242.757	I will tell you what I mean
242.757	by these odd experiences.
247.135	I grew up in South Korea.
249.551	To us, North Korea was always the enemy,
253.363	even before I was born.
255.364	South and North have been
255.364	under armistice for 63 years,
260.861	since the end of the Korean War.
263.772	And growing up in the South
263.772	in the '80s and '90s,
267.522	we were taught propaganda
267.522	about North Korea.
273.232	And we heard so many graphic stories,
275.673	such as, a little young boy
275.673	being brutally killed
279.412	by North Korean spies
279.412	just because he said,
282.912	"""I don't like communists."""
285.447	Or, I watched this cartoon series
289.297	about a young South Korean boy
289.297	defeating these fat, big, red pig,
294.076	which represented the North Koreans'
294.076	first leader at the time.
299.974	And the effect of hearing
299.974	these horrible stories over and over
304.53	instilled one word in a young mind:
308.255	"""enemy."""
310.139	And I think at some point,
310.139	I dehumanized them,
314.23	and the people of North Korea
314.23	became equated
319.243	with the North Korean government.
323.221	Now, back to my detention.
325.788	It was the second day
327.965	of being in a cell.
330.015	I had not slept
330.015	since I was out at the border.
334.208	This young guard came to my cell
337.554	and offered me this small boiled egg
341.094	"and said, ""This will give you"
341.094	"strength to keep going."""
346.131	Do you know what it is like,
349.116	receiving a small kindness
349.116	in the enemy's hand?
353.832	Whenever they were kind to me,
353.832	I thought the worst case
356.903	was waiting for me after the kindness.
361.077	One officer noticed my nervousness.
364.537	"He said, ""Did you think"
364.537	"we were all these red pigs?"""
369.08	referring to the cartoon
369.08	that I just showed you.
375.047	Every day was like a psychological battle.
378.481	The interrogator had me sit at a table
381.596	six days a week
383.12	and had me writing down
383.12	about my journey, my work,
387.234	over and over until I wrote down
387.234	the confession that they wanted to hear.
393.088	After about three months of detention,
396.299	the North Korean court sentenced me
401.185	to 12 years in a labor camp.
404.637	So I was just sitting in my room
404.637	to be transferred.
408.366	At that time, I really had
408.366	nothing else to do,
410.628	so I paid attention
410.628	to these two female guards
413.536	and listened to what
413.536	they were talking about.
416.729	Guard A was older,
418.836	and she studied English.
421.317	She seemed like she came
421.317	from an affluent family.
425.308	She often showed up
425.308	with these colorful dresses,
427.76	and then loved to show off.
430.06	And Guard B was the younger one,
433.405	and she was a really good singer.
436.083	She loved to sing Celine Dion's
436.083	"""My Heart Will Go On"" --"
441.015	sometimes too much.
442.505	She knew just how
442.505	to torture me without knowing.
446.361	(Laughter)
448.029	And this girl spent a lot of time
448.029	in the morning to put on makeup,
454.722	like you can see in any young girl's life.
459.574	And they loved to watch
459.574	this Chinese drama,
463.185	a better quality production.
465.596	I remember Guard B said,
468.992	"""I can no longer watch our TV shows"
468.992	"after watching this."""
473.857	She got scolded
475.699	for degrading her own country's
475.699	produced TV shows.
480.723	Guard B had more
480.723	of a free mind than Guard A,
483.944	and she often got scolded by Guard A
483.944	whenever she expressed herself.
490.141	One day, they invited
490.141	all these female colleagues --
493.557	I don't know where they came from --
495.482	to where I was held,
498.048	and they invited me
499.64	to their guard room
501.438	and asked
503.047	if one-night stands
503.047	really happen in the US.
506.65	(Laughter)
509.86	This is the country where
509.86	young couples are not even allowed
514.939	to hold hands in public.
516.643	I had no idea where they
516.643	had gotten this information,
519.595	but they were shy and giggly
519.595	even before I said anything.
523.948	I think we all forgot
523.948	that I was their prisoner,
528.668	and it was like going back
528.668	to my high school classroom again.
532.98	And I learned that these girls also
532.98	grew up watching a similar cartoon,
538.884	but just propaganda towards
538.884	South Korea and the US.
543.944	I started to understand where
543.944	these people's anger was coming from.
549.427	If these girls grew up
549.427	learning that we are enemies,
553.242	it was just natural
553.242	that they would hate us
556.487	just as I feared them.
559.855	But at that moment, we were all just girls
563.729	who shared the same interests,
566.778	beyond our ideologies that separated us.
571.626	I shared these stories with my boss
571.626	at Current TV at the time
576.32	after I came home.
577.754	His first reaction was,
580.256	"""Euna, have you heard"
580.256	"of Stockholm Syndrome?"""
584.704	Yes, and I clearly remember
589.01	the feeling of fear
590.657	and being threatened,
593.557	and tension rising up
593.557	between me and the interrogator
597.386	when we talked about politics.
599.379	There definitely was a wall
599.379	that we couldn't climb over.
604.168	But we were able to see
604.168	each other as human beings
608.24	when we talked about family,
610.665	everyday life,
612.266	the importance of the future
612.266	for our children.
618.506	It was about a month before I came home.
621.31	I got really sick.
623.452	Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye,
627.567	because she was leaving
627.567	the detention center.
632.868	She made sure that no one watched us,
635.839	no one heard us,
637.447	and quietly said,
639.026	"""I hope you get better"
640.88	"and go back to your family soon."""
645.132	It is these people --
647.747	the officer who brought me his coat,
651.225	the guard who offered me a boiled egg,
654.868	these female guards who asked me
654.868	about dating life in the US --
659.622	they are the ones
659.622	that I remember of North Korea:
664.219	humans just like us.
667.51	North Koreans and I were not
667.51	ambassadors of our countries,
673.033	but I believe that we were representing
676.642	the human race.
679.924	Now I'm back home and back to my life.
684.456	The memory of these people
684.456	has blurred as time has passed.
689.62	And I'm in this place
691.08	where I read and hear
691.08	about North Korea provoking the US.
695.892	I realized how easy it is
698.951	to see them as an enemy again.
702.921	But I have to keep reminding myself
702.921	that when I was over there,
709.475	I was able to see humanity
712.413	over hatred
713.589	in my enemy's eyes.
716.529	Thank you.
718.02	(Applause)
