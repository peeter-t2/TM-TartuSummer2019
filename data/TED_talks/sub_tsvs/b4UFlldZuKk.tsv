12.806	I would like to share with you today
14.306	a project that has changed how I approach
16.46	and practice architecture:
18.371	the Fez River Rehabilitation Project.
21.299	My hometown of Fez, Morocco,
23.64	boasts one of the largest walled
23.64	medieval cities in the world,
27.307	called the medina, nestled in a river valley.
30.046	The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
33.634	Since the 1950s, as the
33.634	population of the medina grew,
37.61	basic urban infrastructure
39.53	such as green open spaces and sewage
42.46	quickly changed and got highly stressed.
47.11	One of the biggest casualties of the situation
50.065	was the Fez River, which bisects
50.065	the medina in its middle
54.028	and has been considered for many centuries
57	as the city's very soul.
59.572	In fact, one can witness the presence
61.99	of the river's extensive water network
65.17	all throughout the city,
66.451	in places such as private and public fountains.
70.072	Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,
73.921	it has been covered little by little
76.357	by concrete slabs since 1952.
79.431	This process of erasure was coupled
82.859	with the destruction of many houses
84.895	along the river banks
86.387	to be able to make machineries
88.376	enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.
93.04	Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking
96.335	or trash yards.
98.291	Actually, the state of the river
100.26	before entering the medina is pretty healthy.
103.535	Then pollution takes its toll,
105.83	mainly due to untreated sewage
108.249	and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.
111.9	At some point, I couldn't bear
113.95	the desecration of the river,
115.605	such an important part of my city,
118.335	and I decided to take action,
119.986	especially after I heard that the city
122.321	received a grant to divert sewage water
125.415	and to treat it.
127.035	With clean water, suddenly
128.992	the uncovering of the river became possible,
131.467	and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,
134.347	my partner Takako Tajima and I
136.563	were commissioned by the city to
136.563	work with a team of engineers
140.194	to uncover the river.
142.302	However, we were sneaky,
144.257	and we proposed more:
145.574	to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,
150.25	and then to connect these pathways
152.21	back to the city fabric,
153.853	and finally to convert the urban voids
156.406	along the riverbanks into public spaces
159.837	that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.
162.187	I will show you briefly now
163.954	two of these public spaces.
166.991	The first one is the Rcif Plaza,
169.771	which sits actually right on top of the river,
172.853	which you can see here in dotted lines.
175.89	This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub
179.557	that actually compromised the urban integrity
181.481	of the medina, that has the largest
183.849	pedestrian network in the world.
186.448	And right beyond the historic
186.448	bridge that you can see here,
189.553	right next to the plaza,
191.364	you can see that the river looked like
193.524	a river of trash.
195.785	Instead, what we proposed is to make
198.017	the plaza entirely pedestrian,
200.375	to cover it with recycled leather canopies,
203.278	and to connect it to the banks of the river.
207.03	The second site of intervention
208.914	is also an urban void along the river banks,
211.92	and it used to be an illegal parking,
214.267	and we proposed to transform it
215.722	into the first playground in the medina.
218.797	The playground is constructed using recycled tires
222.525	and also is coupled with a constructed wetland
225.36	that not only cleans the water of the river
227.79	but also retains it when floods occur.
231.381	As the project progressed and
231.381	received several design awards,
234.412	new stakeholders intervened
236.68	and changed the project goals and design.
240.458	The only way for us to be able to bring
243.24	the main goals of the project ahead
246.532	was for us to do something very unusual
248.962	that usually architects don't do.
250.874	It was for us to take our design ego
254.126	and our sense of authorship
255.602	and put it in the backseat
257.736	and to focus mainly on being activists
260.245	and on trying to coalesce
262.15	all of the agendas of stakeholders
264.441	and focus on the main goals of the project:
267.264	that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,
269.796	and provide public spaces for all.
271.79	We were actually very lucky,
273.282	and many of those goals happened
275.825	or are in the process of happening.
277.418	Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.
279.478	This is how it looked like about six years ago.
282.169	This is how it looks like today.
284.251	It's still under construction,
285.983	but actually it is heavily used
287.48	by the local population.
289.123	And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like
291.946	when the project is completed.
293.831	This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.
297.829	Then after many years of work,
299.651	the river with clean water, uncovered.
302.385	And finally, you can see here the river
304.41	when the project will be completed.
306.851	So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation
309.292	will keep on changing and adapting
311.71	to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,
313.938	but we strongly believe that by reimagining
316.998	the role and the agency of the architect,
319.439	we have set up the core idea
319.439	of the project into motion;
323.398	that is, to transform the river from sewage
325.907	to public space for all,
327.561	thereby making sure that the city of Fez
330.733	will remain a living city for its inhabitants
332.96	rather than a mummified heritage.
335.12	Thank you very much.
336.856	(Applause)
