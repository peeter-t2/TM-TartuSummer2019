13.37	Imagine you're in a bar, or a club,
19.12	and you start talking, and after a while,
19.12	the question comes up,
22.13	"""So, what do you do for work?"""
24.015	And since you think
24.015	your job is interesting,
26.95	"you say, ""I'm a mathematician."""
26.95	(Laughter)
31.69	And inevitably, during that conversation
34.08	one of these two phrases come up:
37.75	"A) ""I was terrible at math,"
37.75	but it wasn't my fault.
41.195	It's because the teacher
41.195	"was awful."" (Laughter)"
44.613	"Or B) ""But what is math really for?"""
47.582	(Laughter)
48.61	I'll now address Case B.
50.955	(Laughter)
52.51	When someone asks you what math is for,
52.51	they're not asking you
57.354	about applications
57.354	of mathematical science.
60.203	They're asking you,
61.554	why did I have to study that bullshit
61.554	I never used in my life again? (Laughter)
65.485	That's what they're actually asking.
67.924	So when mathematicians are asked
67.924	what math is for,
72.124	they tend to fall into two groups:
	will assume an attacking position,
80.609	and 44.77 percent of mathematicians
80.609	will take a defensive position.
85.559	There's a strange 0.8 percent,
85.559	among which I include myself.
89.068	Who are the ones that attack?
91.155	The attacking ones are mathematicians
91.155	who would tell you
93.902	this question makes no sense,
95.849	because mathematics
95.849	have a meaning all their own --
98.597	a beautiful edifice with its own logic --
101.144	and that there's no point
103.011	in constantly searching
103.011	for all possible applications.
105.558	What's the use of poetry?
105.558	What's the use of love?
107.847	What's the use of life itself? 
107.847	What kind of question is that?
110.908	(Laughter)
112.529	Hardy, for instance, was a model
112.529	of this type of attack.
116.296	And those who stand in defense tell you,
118.242	"""Even if you don't realize it, friend,"
118.242	"math is behind everything."""
123.082	(Laughter)
124.34	Those guys,
126.218	they always bring up
126.218	bridges and computers.
130.246	"""If you don't know math,"
130.246	"your bridge will collapse."""
132.841	(Laughter)
134.286	It's true, computers are all about math.
137.523	And now these guys
137.523	have also started saying
140.013	that behind information security
140.013	and credit cards are prime numbers.
145.71	These are the answers your math teacher
145.71	would give you if you asked him.
149.379	He's one of the defensive ones.
151.544	Okay, but who's right then?
153.384	Those who say that math
153.384	doesn't need to have a purpose,
155.99	or those who say that math
155.99	is behind everything we do?
158.849	Actually, both are right.
160.52	But remember I told you
162.183	I belong to that strange 0.8 percent
162.183	claiming something else?
165.726	So, go ahead, ask me what math is for.
168.929	Audience: What is math for?
171.858	Eduardo Sáenz de Cabezón: Okay,
179.6	and the 0.8 percent --
180.827	I'm not sure what those guys are doing.
183.675	Well, to my dear 76.31 percent --
187.175	it's true that math doesn't need
187.175	to serve a purpose,
191.815	it's true that it's
191.815	a beautiful structure, a logical one,
194.685	probably one
194.685	of the greatest collective efforts
197.537	ever achieved in human history.
199.633	But it's also true that there,
201.732	where scientists and technicians
201.732	are looking for mathematical theories
206.331	that allow them to advance,
208.641	they're within the structure of math,
208.641	which permeates everything.
212.438	It's true that we have to go
212.438	somewhat deeper,
215.585	to see what's behind science.
217.308	Science operates on intuition, creativity.
221.348	Math controls intuition
221.348	and tames creativity.
225.747	Almost everyone
225.747	who hasn't heard this before
227.937	is surprised when they hear
227.937	that if you take
230.647	a 0.1 millimeter thick sheet of paper,
230.647	the size we normally use,
235.187	and, if it were big enough,
235.187	fold it 50 times,
238.505	its thickness would extend almost
238.505	the distance from the Earth to the sun.
244.6	Your intuition tells you it's impossible.
247.201	Do the math and you'll see it's right.
249.622	That's what math is for.
252.135	It's true that science, all types
252.135	of science, only makes sense
255.917	because it makes us better understand
255.917	this beautiful world we live in.
259.288	And in doing that,
260.669	it helps us avoid the pitfalls
260.669	of this painful world we live in.
264.179	There are sciences that help us
264.179	in this way quite directly.
267.657	Oncological science, for example.
269.413	And there are others we look at from afar,
269.413	with envy sometimes,
272.904	but knowing that we are
272.904	what supports them.
275.464	All the basic sciences
275.464	support them,
278.213	including math.
280.649	All that makes science, science
280.649	is the rigor of math.
284.366	And that rigor factors in
284.366	because its results are eternal.
289.242	You probably said or were told
289.242	at some point
291.757	that diamonds are forever, right?
296.178	That depends on
296.178	your definition of forever!
298.392	A theorem -- that really is forever.
300.883	(Laughter)
302.134	The Pythagorean theorem is still true
305.486	even though Pythagoras is dead,
305.486	I assure you it's true. (Laughter)
308.601	Even if the world collapsed
309.946	the Pythagorean theorem
309.946	would still be true.
312.391	Wherever any two triangle sides
312.391	and a good hypotenuse get together
316.452	(Laughter)
317.673	the Pythagorean theorem goes all out.
317.673	It works like crazy.
320.534	(Applause)
327.535	Well, we mathematicians devote ourselves
327.535	to come up with theorems.
331.407	Eternal truths.
333.143	But it isn't always easy to know
333.143	the difference between
335.909	an eternal truth, or theorem,
335.909	and a mere conjecture.
338.815	You need proof.
341.829	For example,
343.596	let's say I have a big,
343.596	enormous, infinite field.
348.423	I want to cover it with equal pieces,
348.423	without leaving any gaps.
352.132	I could use squares, right?
354.256	I could use triangles.
354.256	Not circles, those leave little gaps.
358.777	Which is the best shape to use?
361.134	One that covers the same surface,
361.134	but has a smaller border.
365.687	In the year 300, Pappus of Alexandria
365.687	said the best is to use hexagons,
370.396	just like bees do.
372.243	But he didn't prove it.
373.99	"The guy said, ""Hexagons, great!"
373.99	"Let's go with hexagons!"""
376.688	He didn't prove it,
376.688	it remained a conjecture.
379.656	"""Hexagons!"""
381.334	And the world, as you know,
381.334	split into Pappists and anti-Pappists,
384.964	until 1700 years later
390.253	when in 1999, Thomas Hales proved
395.707	that Pappus and the bees were right --
395.707	the best shape to use was the hexagon.
400.641	And that became a theorem,
400.641	the honeycomb theorem,
403.123	that will be true forever and ever,
405.183	for longer than any diamond
405.183	you may have. (Laughter)
408.229	But what happens if we go
408.229	to three dimensions?
411.033	If I want to fill the space
411.033	with equal pieces,
415.464	without leaving any gaps,
416.805	I can use cubes, right?
418.638	Not spheres, those leave little gaps.
418.638	(Laughter)
421.994	What is the best shape to use?
424.957	Lord Kelvin, of the famous
424.957	Kelvin degrees and all,
429.607	said that the best was to use
429.607	a truncated octahedron
436.791	which, as you all know --
439.507	(Laughter) --
441.035	is this thing here!
442.814	(Applause)
447.778	Come on.
450.025	Who doesn't have a truncated
450.025	octahedron at home? (Laughter)
452.862	Even a plastic one.
454.089	"""Honey, get the truncated octahedron,"
454.089	"we're having guests."""
456.846	Everybody has one!
456.846	(Laughter)
458.24	But Kelvin didn't prove it.
460.614	It remained a conjecture --
460.614	Kelvin's conjecture.
464.655	The world, as you know, then split into
464.655	Kelvinists and anti-Kelvinists
470.177	(Laughter)
471.599	until a hundred or so years later,
478.203	someone found a better structure.
482.917	Weaire and Phelan
482.917	found this little thing over here --
488.026	(Laughter) --
489.665	this structure to which they gave
489.665	the very clever name
493.209	"""the Weaire-€“Phelan structure."""
495.375	(Laughter)
497.911	It looks like a strange object,
497.911	but it isn't so strange,
500.568	it also exists in nature.
502.239	It's very interesting that this structure,
504.844	because of its geometric properties,
507.037	was used to build the Aquatics Center
507.037	for the Beijing Olympic Games.
512.969	There, Michael Phelps
512.969	won eight gold medals,
515.714	and became the best swimmer of all time.
518.875	Well, until someone better
518.875	comes along, right?
522.616	As may happen
522.616	with the Weaire-€“Phelan structure.
525.015	It's the best
525.015	until something better shows up.
527.633	But be careful, because this one
527.633	really stands a chance
532.225	that in a hundred or so years,
532.225	or even if it's in 1700 years,
537.205	that someone proves
537.205	it's the best possible shape for the job.
542.978	It will then become a theorem,
542.978	a truth, forever and ever.
547.348	For longer than any diamond.
550.837	So, if you want to tell someone
555.777	that you will love them forever
558.823	you can give them a diamond.
560.89	But if you want to tell them
560.89	that you'll love them forever and ever,
564.421	give them a theorem!
566.172	(Laughter)
567.263	But hang on a minute!
570.783	You'll have to prove it,
572.183	so your love doesn't remain
574.466	a conjecture.
576.299	(Applause)
