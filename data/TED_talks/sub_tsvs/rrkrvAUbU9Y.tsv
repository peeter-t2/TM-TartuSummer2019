13.302	I need to make a confession
13.302	at the outset here.
15.842	A little over 20 years ago,
15.842	I did something that I regret,
21.671	something that I'm not
21.671	particularly proud of.
25.041	Something that, in many ways,
25.041	I wish no one would ever know,
28.44	but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.
31.723	(Laughter)
34	In the late 1980s,
36.048	in a moment of youthful indiscretion,
39.467	I went to law school.
40.992	(Laughter)
45.666	In America, law is a professional degree:
48.127	after your university degree,
48.127	you go on to law school.
50.856	When I got to law school,
53.133	I didn't do very well.
55.743	To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.
57.688	I, in fact, graduated in the part
57.688	of my law school class
60.719	that made the top 90% possible.
64.16	(Laughter)
68.16	Thank you.
70.985	I never practiced law a day in my life;
74.564	I pretty much wasn't allowed to.
76.572	(Laughter)
79.31	But today, against my better judgment,
82.815	against the advice of my own wife,
85.16	I want to try to dust off
85.16	some of those legal skills --
89.16	what's left of those legal skills.
91.543	I don't want to tell you a story.
94.16	I want to make a case.
96.548	I want to make a hard-headed,
98.938	evidence-based,
100.16	dare I say lawyerly case,
103.358	for rethinking how we run our businesses.
107.953	So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
109.962	take a look at this.
111.429	This is called the candle problem.
113.76	Some of you might know it.
115.458	It's created in 1945
117.16	by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.
119.16	He created this experiment
121.16	that is used in many other experiments
121.16	in behavioral science.
124.315	And here's how it works.
124.315	Suppose I'm the experimenter.
127.16	I bring you into a room.
128.804	I give you a candle,
128.804	some thumbtacks and some matches.
133.052	And I say to you,
134.147	"""Your job is to attach"
134.147	the candle to the wall
137.16	"so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."""
140.31	Now what would you do?
141.869	Many people begin trying
141.869	to thumbtack the candle to the wall.
145.488	Doesn't work.
146.85	I saw somebody
146.85	kind of make the motion over here --
151.604	some people have a great idea
151.604	where they light the match,
154.732	melt the side of the candle,
154.732	try to adhere it to the wall.
157.685	It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.
160.827	And eventually, after five or ten minutes,
163.16	most people figure out the solution,
165.16	which you can see here.
166.929	The key is to overcome
166.929	what's called functional fixedness.
170.743	You look at that box and you see it
170.743	only as a receptacle for the tacks.
174.731	But it can also have this other function,
176.761	as a platform for the candle.
179.047	The candle problem.
180.16	I want to tell you about an experiment
180.16	using the candle problem,
184.155	done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,
186.638	who is now at Princeton University, US,
188.783	This shows the power of incentives.
192.16	He gathered his participants and said:
194.16	"""I'm going to time you, how quickly"
194.16	"you can solve this problem."""
198.009	To one group he said,
199.509	"""I'm going to time you to establish norms,"
202.16	averages for how long it typically takes
202.16	"someone to solve this sort of problem."""
206.725	To the second group he offered rewards.
209.16	"He said, ""If you're in the top 25%"
209.16	of the fastest times,
213.907	you get five dollars.
215.874	If you're the fastest of everyone
215.874	we're testing here today,
219.651	"you get 20 dollars."""
221.16	Now this is several years ago,
221.16	adjusted for inflation,
224.067	it's a decent sum of money
224.067	for a few minutes of work.
226.636	It's a nice motivator.
228.16	Question:
229.327	How much faster did this group
229.327	solve the problem?
233.537	Answer:
234.807	It took them, on average,
234.807	three and a half minutes longer.
240.473	3.5 min longer.
241.712	This makes no sense, right?
243.558	I mean, I'm an American.
243.558	I believe in free markets.
246.685	That's not how it's supposed
246.685	to work, right?
249.16	(Laughter)
250.368	If you want people to perform better,
250.368	you reward them. Right?
254.307	Bonuses, commissions,
254.307	their own reality show.
257.16	Incentivize them.
260.022	That's how business works.
261.429	But that's not happening here.
263.466	You've got an incentive designed
265.16	to sharpen thinking
265.16	and accelerate creativity,
268.98	and it does just the opposite.
271.16	It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
274.16	What's interesting about this experiment
276.115	is that it's not an aberration.
277.709	This has been replicated
277.709	over and over again
280.818	for nearly 40 years.
283.86	These contingent motivators --
286.16	if you do this, then you get that --
288.558	work in some circumstances.
290.16	But for a lot of tasks,
290.16	they actually either don't work
293.996	or, often, they do harm.
296.848	This is one of the most robust findings
296.848	in social science,
302.945	and also one of the most ignored.
305.318	I spent the last couple of years
306.932	looking at the science
306.932	of human motivation,
309.027	particularly the dynamics
309.027	of extrinsic motivators
311.413	and intrinsic motivators.
313.16	And I'm telling you, it's not even close.
315.596	If you look at the science,
315.596	there is a mismatch
317.958	between what science knows
319.835	and what business does.
321.27	What's alarming here
321.27	is that our business operating system --
324.54	think of the set of assumptions
324.54	and protocols beneath our businesses,
327.872	how we motivate people,
327.872	how we apply our human resources--
332.63	it's built entirely
332.63	around these extrinsic motivators,
335.884	around carrots and sticks.
337.479	That's actually fine for many kinds
337.479	of 20th century tasks.
341.692	But for 21st century tasks,
343.827	that mechanistic,
343.827	reward-and-punishment approach
347.382	doesn't work,
349.074	often doesn't work,
350.58	and often does harm.
351.775	Let me show you.
352.982	Glucksberg did another similar experiment,
356.083	he presented the problem
356.083	in a slightly different way,
358.72	like this up here.
360.662	Attach the candle to the wall
360.662	so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.
363.963	Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.
366.463	You: we're incentivizing.
368.929	What happened this time?
371.36	This time, the incentivized group
371.36	kicked the other group's butt.
377.588	Why?
379.414	Because when the tacks are out of the box,
381.945	it's pretty easy isn't it?
385.421	(Laughter)
387.895	If-then rewards work really well
387.895	for those sorts of tasks,
392.897	where there is a simple set of rules
394.637	and a clear destination to go to.
397.16	Rewards, by their very nature,
399.16	narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;
401.16	that's why they work in so many cases.
403.519	So, for tasks like this,
405.622	a narrow focus, where you just see
405.622	the goal right there,
408.999	zoom straight ahead to it,
410.403	they work really well.
412.056	But for the real candle problem,
414.8	you don't want to be looking like this.
416.816	The solution is on the periphery.
416.816	You want to be looking around.
419.97	That reward actually narrows our focus
422.621	and restricts our possibility.
424.16	Let me tell you why this is so important.
427.336	In western Europe,
430.463	in many parts of Asia,
431.572	in North America, in Australia,
434.371	white-collar workers are doing
434.371	less of this kind of work,
437.961	and more of this kind of work.
442.025	That routine, rule-based,
442.025	left-brain work --
445.02	certain kinds of accounting,
445.02	financial analysis,
447.76	computer programming --
449.479	has become fairly easy to outsource,
451.698	fairly easy to automate.
453.753	Software can do it faster.
455.953	Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.
458.302	So what really matters
461.294	are the more right-brained
461.294	creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.
465.946	Think about your own work.
468.351	Think about your own work.
471.033	Are the problems that you face,
472.639	or even the problems
472.639	we've been talking about here,
475.16	do they have a clear set of rules,
478.072	and a single solution?
479.683	No. The rules are mystifying.
482.16	The solution, if it exists at all,
484.43	is surprising and not obvious.
487.16	Everybody in this room
489.938	is dealing with their own version
489.938	of the candle problem.
494.16	And for candle problems of any kind,
497.321	in any field,
499.015	those if-then rewards,
502.032	the things around which we've built
502.032	so many of our businesses,
506.298	don't work!
508.155	It makes me crazy.
510.635	And here's the thing.
512.595	This is not a feeling.
515.856	Okay? I'm a lawyer;
515.856	I don't believe in feelings.
518.974	This is not a philosophy.
522.641	I'm an American;
522.641	I don't believe in philosophy.
524.927	(Laughter)
527.525	This is a fact --
530.517	or, as we say in my hometown
530.517	of Washington, D.C.,
532.985	a true fact.
534.599	(Laughter)
537.067	(Applause)
540.885	Let me give you an example.
542.551	Let me marshal the evidence here.
544.16	I'm not telling a story,
544.16	I'm making a case.
546.297	Ladies and gentlemen
546.297	of the jury, some evidence:
548.592	Dan Ariely, one of the great
548.592	economists of our time,
551.991	he and three colleagues
551.991	did a study of some MIT students.
555.486	They gave these MIT
555.486	students a bunch of games,
558.16	games that involved creativity,
560.16	and motor skills, and concentration.
562.462	And the offered them, for performance,
564.567	three levels of rewards:
566.605	small reward, medium reward,
566.605	large reward.
570.875	If you do really well
570.875	you get the large reward, on down.
575.036	What happened?
576.394	As long as the task
576.394	involved only mechanical skill
579.16	bonuses worked as they would be expected:
581.16	the higher the pay,
581.16	the better the performance.
584.881	Okay?
586.056	But once the task called
586.056	for even rudimentary cognitive skill,
591.16	a larger reward led to poorer performance.
597.256	Then they said,
598.43	"""Let's see if there's any"
598.43	cultural bias here.
600.589	"Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."""
602.566	Standard of living is lower.
604.16	In Madurai, a reward that is modest
604.16	in North American standards,
607.661	is more meaningful there.
609.859	Same deal. A bunch of games,
609.859	three levels of rewards.
613.285	What happens?
615.301	People offered the medium level of rewards
618.325	did no better than people
618.325	offered the small rewards.
620.929	But this time,
620.929	people offered the highest rewards,
625.432	they did the worst of all.
628.977	In eight of the nine tasks we examined
628.977	across three experiments,
632.374	higher incentives led
632.374	to worse performance.
637.634	Is this some kind of touchy-feely
637.634	socialist conspiracy going on here?
643.634	No, these are economists from MIT,
646.434	from Carnegie Mellon,
646.434	from the University of Chicago.
649.16	Do you know who sponsored this research?
651.805	The Federal Reserve Bank
651.805	of the United States.
655.949	That's the American experience.
657.793	Let's go across the pond
657.793	to the London School of Economics,
660.592	LSE, London School of Economics,
663.16	alma mater of eleven
663.16	Nobel Laureates in economics.
666.628	Training ground for great
666.628	economic thinkers
669.16	like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,
672.16	and Mick Jagger.
673.471	(Laughter)
674.794	Last month,
676.588	just last month,
678.111	economists at LSE looked at 51 studies
681.16	of pay-for-performance plans,
681.16	inside of companies.
684.16	Here's what they said:
685.635	"""We find that financial incentives"
687.455	can result in a negative impact
687.455	"on overall performance."""
692.936	There is a mismatch
692.936	between what science knows
696.659	and what business does.
698.16	And what worries me,
698.16	as we stand here in the rubble
701.461	of the economic collapse,
703.16	is that too many organizations
703.16	are making their decisions,
707.16	their policies about talent and people,
709.556	based on assumptions that are outdated,
713.707	unexamined,
714.921	and rooted more in folklore
714.921	than in science.
718.564	And if we really want to get
718.564	out of this economic mess,
721.16	if we really want high performance
723.277	on those definitional tasks
723.277	of the 21st century,
725.748	the solution is not to do
725.748	more of the wrong things,
731.712	to entice people with a sweeter carrot,
734.059	or threaten them with a sharper stick.
736.482	We need a whole new approach.
738.16	The good news is that the scientists
740.16	who've been studying motivation
740.16	have given us this new approach.
743.372	It's built much more
743.372	around intrinsic motivation.
746.491	Around the desire to do things
746.491	because they matter,
748.97	because we like it, they're interesting,
748.97	or part of something important.
752.557	And to my mind, that new operating
752.557	system for our businesses
756.16	revolves around three elements:
757.885	autonomy, mastery and purpose.
761.16	Autonomy: the urge
761.16	to direct our own lives.
764.16	Mastery: the desire to get better
764.16	and better at something that matters.
768.429	Purpose: the yearning to do what we do
771.16	in the service of something
771.16	larger than ourselves.
774.377	These are the building blocks
774.377	of an entirely new operating system
777.695	for our businesses.
779.16	I want to talk today only about autonomy.
783.16	In the 20th century, we came up
783.16	with this idea of management.
786.16	Management did not emanate from nature.
788.478	Management is not a tree,
788.478	it's a television set.
792.16	Somebody invented it.
794.408	It doesn't mean
794.408	it's going to work forever.
796.432	Management is great.
798.463	Traditional notions
798.463	of management are great
800.541	if you want compliance.
802.16	But if you want engagement,
802.16	self-direction works better.
805.367	Some examples of some kind
805.367	of radical notions of self-direction.
809.431	You don't see a lot of it,
812.391	but you see the first stirrings
812.391	of something really interesting going on,
815.891	what it means is paying people adequately
815.891	and fairly, absolutely --
819.558	getting the issue of money off the table,
821.867	and then giving people lots of autonomy.
823.866	Some examples.
825.16	How many of you have heard
825.16	of the company Atlassian?
829.628	It looks like less than half.
831.16	(Laughter)
832.589	Atlassian is an Australian
832.589	software company.
837.16	And they do something incredibly cool.
839.155	A few times a year
839.155	they tell their engineers,
841.923	"""Go for the next 24 hours"
841.923	and work on anything you want,
845.953	as long as it's not part
845.953	of your regular job.
848.087	"Work on anything you want."""
849.501	Engineers use this time to come up
849.501	with a cool patch for code,
853.288	come up with an elegant hack.
854.754	Then they present all of the stuff
854.754	that they've developed
857.744	to their teammates,
857.744	to the rest of the company,
860.488	in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting
860.488	at the end of the day.
864.464	Being Australians, everybody has a beer.
866.683	They call them FedEx Days.
869.612	Why?
871.675	Because you have to deliver
871.675	something overnight.
874.977	It's pretty; not bad.
876.568	It's a huge trademark violation,
876.568	but it's pretty clever.
879.26	(Laughter)
880.621	That one day of intense autonomy
882.323	has produced a whole array
882.323	of software fixes
884.399	that might never have existed.
886.16	It's worked so well that Atlassian
886.16	has taken it to the next level
889.252	with 20% time --
890.334	done, famously, at Google --
892.526	where engineers can spend
894.612	working on anything they want.
896.581	They have autonomy over their time,
898.272	their task, their team, their technique.
900.509	Radical amounts of autonomy.
902.487	And at Google, as many of you know,
906.437	about half of the new products
906.437	in a typical year
908.794	are birthed during that 20% time:
911.294	things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.
914.16	Let me give you an even more
914.16	radical example of it:
917.104	something called the Results Only
917.104	Work Environment (the ROWE),
921.001	created by two American consultants,
923.091	in place at a dozen companies
923.091	around North America.
925.794	In a ROWE people don't have schedules.
929.728	They show up when they want.
931.399	They don't have to be in the office
931.399	at a certain time, or any time.
935.477	They just have to get their work done.
937.446	How they do it, when they do it,
937.446	where they do it, is totally up to them.
942.644	Meetings in these kinds
942.644	of environments are optional.
947.039	What happens?
948.524	Almost across the board,
950.259	productivity goes up,
950.259	worker engagement goes up,
953.493	worker satisfaction goes up,
953.493	turnover goes down.
957.16	Autonomy, mastery and purpose,
959.16	the building blocks
959.16	of a new way of doing things.
961.796	Some of you might look at this and say,
964.16	"""Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."""
967.518	"And I say, ""Nope."
970.525	"I have proof."""
972.638	The mid-1990s, Microsoft started
972.638	an encyclopedia called Encarta.
976.16	They had deployed
976.16	all the right incentives,
979.501	They paid professionals
979.501	to write and edit thousands of articles.
983.374	Well-compensated managers
983.374	oversaw the whole thing
985.987	to make sure it came in
985.987	on budget and on time.
990.16	A few years later,
990.16	another encyclopedia got started.
992.688	Different model, right?
995.506	Do it for fun.
997.19	No one gets paid a cent,
997.19	or a euro or a yen.
1001.256	Do it because you like to do it.
1003.204	Just 10 years ago,
1005.16	if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,
1007.433	"""Hey, I've got these two different"
1007.433	models for creating an encyclopedia.
1011.032	"If they went head to head, who would win?"""
	have found a single sober economist
1017.567	anywhere on planet Earth
1019.811	who would have predicted
1019.811	the Wikipedia model.
1022.707	This is the titanic battle
1022.707	between these two approaches.
1025.43	This is the Ali-Frazier
1025.43	of motivation, right?
1028.522	This is the Thrilla in Manila.
1030.385	Intrinsic motivators
1030.385	versus extrinsic motivators.
1033.578	Autonomy, mastery and purpose,
1035.16	versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?
1037.741	Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery
1037.741	and purpose, in a knockout.
1041.295	Let me wrap up.
1044.683	There is a mismatch between
1044.683	what science knows and what business does.
1048.01	Here is what science knows.
1049.621	One: Those 20th century rewards,
1051.328	those motivators we think
1051.328	are a natural part of business,
1054.332	do work, but only in a surprisingly
1054.332	narrow band of circumstances.
1058.057	Two: Those if-then rewards
1058.057	often destroy creativity.
1062.874	Three: The secret to high performance
1062.874	isn't rewards and punishments,
1066.698	but that unseen intrinsic drive--
1068.332	the drive to do things for their own sake.
1071.16	The drive to do things cause they matter.
1073.16	And here's the best part.
1075.16	We already know this.
1076.404	The science confirms
1076.404	what we know in our hearts.
1078.978	So, if we repair this mismatch
1078.978	between science and business,
1083.832	if we bring our motivation,
1083.832	notions of motivation
1086.789	into the 21st century,
1088.54	if we get past this lazy,
1088.54	dangerous, ideology
1092.578	of carrots and sticks,
1094.634	we can strengthen our businesses,
1097.387	we can solve a lot
1097.387	of those candle problems,
1099.993	and maybe, maybe --
1104.16	we can change the world.
1105.937	I rest my case.
1107.266	(Applause)
