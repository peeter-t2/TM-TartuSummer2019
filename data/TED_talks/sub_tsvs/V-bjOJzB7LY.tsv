15.76	Now, I want to start with a question:
17.553	When was the last time
17.553	"you were called ""childish""?"
20.99	For kids like me,
22.26	being called childish
22.26	can be a frequent occurrence.
25.64	Every time we make irrational demands,
28.26	exhibit irresponsible behavior,
30.26	or display any other signs
30.26	of being normal American citizens,
34.26	we are called childish.
37.017	Which really bothers me.
38.26	After all, take a look at these events:
40.26	Imperialism and colonization,
43.26	world wars, George W. Bush.
46.26	Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
49.26	Now, what have kids done?
52.26	Well, Anne Frank touched millions
54.26	with her powerful account
54.26	of the Holocaust.
57.26	Ruby Bridges helped to end
57.26	segregation in the United States.
60.26	And, most recently,
62.26	Charlie Simpson helped to raise
66.977	on his little bike.
68.826	So as you can see evidenced
68.826	by such examples,
71.26	age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
74.26	"The traits the word ""childish"" addresses"
74.26	are seen so often in adults,
78.118	that we should abolish
78.118	this age-discriminatory word,
80.886	when it comes to criticizing behavior
80.886	associated with irresponsibility
84.656	and irrational thinking.
86.06	(Applause)
91.987	Thank you.
93.391	Then again, who's to say
93.391	that certain types of irrational thinking
97.854	aren't exactly what the world needs?
100.26	Maybe you've had grand plans before,
102.592	but stopped yourself, thinking,
104.577	"""That's impossible,"""
104.577	"or ""That costs too much,"""
106.901	"or ""That won't benefit me."""
108.782	For better or worse, we kids
108.782	aren't hampered as much
111.339	when it comes to thinking
111.339	about reasons why not to do things.
114.91	Kids can be full of inspiring
114.91	aspirations and hopeful thinking,
118.782	like my wish that no one went hungry,
120.766	or that everything were free,
120.766	a kind of utopia.
123.989	How many of you still dream like that,
123.989	and believe in the possibilities?
128.704	Sometimes a knowledge of history
128.704	and the past failures of Utopian ideals
133.116	can be a burden,
134.299	because you know
134.299	that if everything were free,
136.475	then the food stocks would become
136.475	depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.
140.768	On the other hand, we kids
140.768	still dream about perfection.
144.649	And that's a good thing, because
144.649	in order to make anything a reality,
148.139	you have to dream about it first.
151.185	In many ways, our audacity to imagine
153.26	helps push the boundaries of possibility.
156.529	For instance, the Museum
156.529	of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,
159.704	my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!
161.625	(Applause)
164.26	has a program called Kids Design Glass,
166.482	and kids draw their own
166.482	ideas for glass art.
168.633	The resident artist said
168.633	they got some of their best ideas
171.475	from the program, because kids
171.475	don't think about the limitations
174.522	of how hard it can be to blow
174.522	glass into certain shapes,
177.181	they just think of good ideas.
178.798	Now, when you think of glass, you
178.798	might think of colorful Chihuly designs,
183.26	or maybe Italian vases,
185.441	but kids challenge glass artists
185.441	to go beyond that,
188.26	into the realm of brokenhearted snakes
190.979	and bacon boys,
190.979	who you can see has meat vision.
194.233	(Laughter)
195.852	Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't
195.852	have to be insider's knowledge.
200.891	Kids already do a lot
200.891	of learning from adults,
204.105	and we have a lot to share.
205.907	I think that adults should
205.907	start learning from kids.
209.213	Now, I do most of my speaking
210.641	in front of an education crowd --
210.641	teachers and students,
213.307	and I like this analogy:
214.491	It shouldn't be a teacher
214.491	at the head of the class,
217.006	"telling students, ""Do this, do that."""
218.823	The students should teach their teachers.
222.051	Learning between grown-ups
222.051	and kids should be reciprocal.
225.735	The reality, unfortunately,
225.735	is a little different,
228.26	and it has a lot to do
228.26	with trust, or a lack of it.
231.26	Now, if you don't trust someone,
231.26	you place restrictions on them, right?
234.656	If I doubt my older sister's ability
234.656	to pay back the 10 percent interest
238.602	I established on her last loan,
240.259	I'm going to withhold her ability
240.259	to get more money from me,
243.26	until she pays it back.
244.658	(Laughter)
245.849	True story, by the way.
247.772	Now, adults seem to have
250.26	a prevalently restrictive
250.26	attitude towards kids,
253.96	"from every ""Don't do that, don't do this"""
253.96	in the school handbook,
257.26	to restrictions on school Internet use.
260.028	As history points out,
260.028	regimes become oppressive
263.085	when they're fearful
263.085	about keeping control.
265.332	And although adults
265.332	may not be quite at the level
267.69	of totalitarian regimes,
269.26	kids have no or very little say
269.26	in making the rules,
272.26	when really, the attitude
272.26	should be reciprocal,
274.499	meaning that the adult
274.499	population should learn
277.22	and take into account the wishes
277.22	of the younger population.
280.26	Now, what's even worse than restriction,
282.26	is that adults often
282.26	underestimate kids' abilities.
285.856	We love challenges, but when
285.856	expectations are low,
289.038	trust me, we will sink to them.
291.49	My own parents had anything
291.49	but low expectations
294.808	for me and my sister.
296.744	Okay, so they didn't tell us to become
296.744	doctors or lawyers or anything like that,
301.887	but my dad did read to us about Aristotle
301.887	and pioneer germ-fighters,
307.509	when lots of other kids were hearing
309.26	"""The Wheels on the Bus"
309.26	"Go Round and Round."""
311.332	Well, we heard that one too, but
311.332	"""Pioneer Germ Fighters"" totally rules."
315.224	(Laughter)
316.261	I loved to write from the age
316.261	of four, and when I was six,
319.259	my mom bought me my own laptop
319.259	equipped with Microsoft Word.
323.26	Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.
325.694	I wrote over 300 short stories
325.694	on that little laptop,
329.26	and I wanted to get published.
332.26	Instead of just scoffing at this heresy
332.26	that a kid wanted to get published,
336.26	or saying wait until you're older,
338.26	my parents were really supportive.
340.823	Many publishers were not
340.823	quite so encouraging.
344.26	One large children's
344.26	publisher ironically said
347.26	that they didn't work with children.
349.521	Children's publisher not
349.521	working with children?
352.774	I don't know, you're kind
352.774	of alienating a large client there.
355.957	(Laughter)
357.663	One publisher, Action Publishing, was
357.663	willing to take that leap and trust me,
363.515	and to listen to what I had to say.
365.229	They published my first book,
365.229	"""Flying Fingers,"" you see it here."
368.802	And from there on, it's gone
368.802	to speaking at hundreds of schools,
372.26	keynoting to thousands of educators,
374.307	and finally, today, speaking to you.
376.854	I appreciate your attention today,
378.814	because to show that you
378.814	truly care, you listen.
382.879	But there's a problem
382.879	with this rosy picture
385.26	of kids being so much better than adults.
388.26	Kids grow up and become
388.26	adults just like you.
391.593	(Laughter)
393.26	Or just like you? Really?
395.648	The goal is not to turn kids
395.648	into your kind of adult,
399.14	but rather, better adults
399.14	than you have been,
401.26	which may be a little challenging,
401.26	considering your guys' credentials.
404.6	(Laughter)
405.782	But the way progress happens,
407.26	is because new generations and new eras
410.26	grow and develop and become
410.26	better than the previous ones.
413.26	It's the reason we're not
413.26	in the Dark Ages anymore.
416.807	No matter your position or place in life,
419.26	it is imperative to create
419.26	opportunities for children,
422.26	so that we can grow up to blow you away.
425.26	(Laughter)
428.17	Adults and fellow TEDsters,
430.26	you need to listen and learn from kids,
432.26	and trust us and expect more from us.
436.18	You must lend an ear today,
438.513	because we are the leaders
438.513	of tomorrow, which means
441.235	we're going to take care of you
441.235	when you're old and senile.
444.061	No, just kidding.
445.378	(Laughter)
446.402	No, really, we are going
446.402	to be the next generation,
449.121	the ones who will bring
449.121	this world forward.
451.43	And in case you don't think
451.43	that this really has meaning for you,
454.605	remember that cloning is possible,
456.26	and that involves going
456.26	through childhood again,
458.57	in which case you'll want to be
458.57	heard, just like my generation.
462.26	Now, the world needs opportunities
462.26	for new leaders and new ideas.
468.26	Kids need opportunities
468.26	to lead and succeed.
471.556	Are you ready to make the match?
473.77	Because the world's problems
473.77	shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.
478.405	Thank you.
480.26	(Applause)
483.26	Thank you. Thank you.
