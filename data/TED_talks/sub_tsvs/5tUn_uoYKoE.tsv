16.656	A few weeks ago, I had a chance
16.656	to go to Saudi Arabia.
20.744	And the first thing
20.744	I wanted to do as a Muslim
23.377	was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,
25.802	the holiest shrine of Islam.
27.595	And I did that;
27.595	I put on my ritualistic dress,
30.299	I went to the holy mosque,
31.831	I did my prayers,
33.534	I observed all the rituals.
36.26	And meanwhile,
36.26	besides all the spirituality,
39.661	there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba
41.982	that was pretty interesting for me:
43.704	there was no separation of sexes.
45.949	In other words, men and women
45.949	were worshiping all together.
50.085	They were together while doing tawƒÅf,
50.085	the circular walk around the Kaaba.
54.887	They were together while praying.
56.504	And if you wonder
56.504	why this is interesting at all,
60.086	you have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,
62.691	because this a country which is strictly
62.691	divided between the sexes.
67.848	In other words:
69.038	as men, you are simply not supposed to be
69.038	in the same physical space
72.805	with women.
73.993	And I noticed this in a very funny way.
75.903	I left the Kaaba to eat something
75.903	in downtown Mecca.
79.668	I headed to the nearest
79.668	Burger King restaurant.
82.13	And I went there -- I noticed
82.13	that there was a male section,
85.91	which is carefully separated
85.91	from the female section.
88.732	I had to pay, order and eat
88.732	in the male section.
91.946	"""It's funny,"" I said to myself,"
93.764	"""You can mingle with the opposite sex"
93.764	at the holy Kaaba,
96.592	"but not at the Burger King?"""
98.26	(Laughter)
99.314	Quite, quite ironic.
101.04	Ironic, and it's also,
101.04	I think, quite telling,
103.331	because the Kaaba
103.331	and the rituals around it
106.935	are relics from the earliest
106.935	phase of Islam,
109.848	that of prophet Muhammad.
111.678	And if there was a big emphasis
111.678	at the time to separate men from women,
115.553	the rituals around the Kaaba
115.553	could have been designed accordingly.
118.695	But apparently, that was not
118.695	an issue at the time.
121.087	So the rituals came that way.
122.512	This is also, I think,
122.512	confirmed by the fact
125.064	that the seclusion of women
125.064	in creating a divided society
128.741	is something that you also
128.741	do not find in the Koran --
132.261	the very core of Islam,
132.261	the divine core of Islam --
135.347	that all Muslims, equally myself, believe.
139.054	And I think it's not an accident
140.749	that you don't find this idea
140.749	in the very origin of Islam,
144.639	because many scholars who study
144.639	the history of Islamic thought --
148.332	Muslim scholars or Westerners --
150.276	think that, actually, the practice
150.276	of dividing men and women physically
154.674	came as a later development in Islam,
157.833	as Muslims adopted
157.833	some preexisting cultures
160.888	and traditions of the Middle East.
162.598	Seclusion of women was actually
162.598	a Byzantine and Persian practice,
167.338	and Muslims adopted it
167.338	and made it a part of their religion.
171.101	Actually, this is just one example
171.101	of a much larger phenomenon.
175.695	What we call today Islamic law,
175.695	and especially Islamic culture --
179.344	and there are many Islamic
179.344	cultures, actually;
181.555	the one in Saudi Arabia is much different
183.566	from where I come
183.566	from in Istanbul or Turkey.
185.835	But still, if you're going to speak
185.835	about a Muslim culture,
189.132	this has a core: the divine message
189.132	which began the religion.
193.499	But then many traditions, perceptions,
193.499	practices were added on top of it.
198.562	And these were traditions
198.562	of the Middle East medieval traditions.
202.609	There are two important
202.609	messages, or two lessons,
206.226	to take from that reality.
208.892	First of all, Muslims --
210.438	pious, conservative, believing Muslims
210.438	who want to be loyal to their religion --
214.344	should not cling onto everything
214.344	in their culture,
216.798	thinking that that's divinely mandated.
219.03	Maybe some things are bad traditions
219.03	and they need to be changed.
222.26	On the other hand, the Westerners
222.26	who look at Islamic culture
226.335	and see some troubling aspects
228.525	should not readily conclude
228.525	that this is what Islam ordains.
231.739	Maybe it's a Middle Eastern culture
231.739	that became confused with Islam.
236.205	There is a practice
236.205	called female circumcision.
239.315	It's something terrible, horrible.
241.381	It is basically an operation
241.381	to deprive women of sexual pleasure.
246.072	And Westerners --
247.916	Europeans or Americans --
247.916	who didn't know about this before,
251.26	[saw] this practice
253.26	within some of the Muslim communities
253.26	who migrated from North Africa.
257.576	And they've thought,
258.775	"""Oh, what a horrible religion that is,"
258.775	"which ordains something like that."""
263.579	But when you look at female circumcision,
265.654	you see that it has
265.654	nothing to do with Islam;
267.845	it's just a North African practice
267.845	which predates Islam.
270.551	It was there for thousands of years.
272.388	And, quite tellingly,
272.388	some Muslims do practice it --
276.026	the Muslims in North Africa,
276.026	not in other places.
278.495	But also the non-Muslim
278.495	communities of North Africa --
282.165	the animists, some Christians
282.165	and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa --
286.19	are known to practice female circumcision.
288.97	So what might look like a problem
288.97	within Islamic faith
293.63	might turn out to be a tradition
293.63	that Muslims have subscribed to.
297.735	The same thing can be said
297.735	for honor killings,
299.981	which is a recurrent theme
299.981	in the Western media --
302.553	and which is, of course,
302.553	a horrible tradition.
305.26	And we see, truly, in some Muslim
305.26	communities, that tradition.
309.074	But in the non-Muslim communities
309.074	of the Middle East,
312.008	such as some Christian communities,
312.008	Eastern communities,
314.682	you see the same practice.
315.991	We had a tragic case of an honor killing
318.65	within Turkey's Armenian community
318.65	just a few months ago.
321.821	Now, these are things
321.821	about general culture,
323.968	but I'm also very much
323.968	interested in political culture
326.842	and whether liberty
326.842	and democracy is appreciated,
329.683	or whether there's an authoritarian
329.683	political culture
332.479	in which the state is supposed
332.479	to impose things on the citizens.
336.183	And it is no secret
337.915	that many Islamic movements
337.915	in the Middle East
340.466	tend to be authoritarian,
341.767	and some of the so-called
341.767	"""Islamic regimes,"""
344.722	such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst
344.722	case, the Taliban in Afghanistan,
349.643	they are pretty authoritarian --
349.643	no doubt about that.
352.267	For example, in Saudi Arabia,
353.717	there is a phenomenon
353.717	called the religious police.
356.26	And the religious police imposes
356.26	the supposed Islamic way of life
360.26	on every citizen, by force --
362.393	like, women are forced
362.393	to cover their heads --
365.401	wear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.
369.119	Now that is pretty authoritarian,
370.747	and that's something
370.747	I'm very much critical of.
373.879	But when I realized that the non-Muslim,
377.489	or the non-Islamic-minded
377.489	actors in the same geography
381.132	sometimes behaved similarly,
382.857	I realized that the problem maybe lies
384.883	in the political culture
384.883	of the whole region, not just Islam.
387.789	Let me give you an example:
387.789	in Turkey, where I come from,
390.53	which is a very hyper-secular republic,
392.937	until very recently, we used to have
392.937	"what I call ""secularism police,"""
398.197	which would guard the universities
398.197	against veiled students.
402.979	In other words, they would force students
402.979	to uncover their heads.
407.512	And I think forcing people
407.512	to uncover their head
409.864	is as tyrannical as forcing
409.864	them to cover it.
413.003	It should be the citizen's decision.
414.747	But when I saw that, I said,
416.43	"""Maybe the problem is just"
416.43	an authoritarian culture in the region,
420.26	and some Muslims
420.26	have been influenced by that.
423.136	But the secular-minded people
423.136	can be influenced by that.
425.815	Maybe it's a problem
425.815	of the political culture,
428.023	and we have to think about
428.023	"how to change that political culture."""
431.916	Now, these are some of the questions
431.916	I had in mind a few years ago
435.763	when I sat down to write a book.
437.967	"I said, ""Well, I will do research"
440.144	about how Islam actually
440.144	came to be what it is today,
445.153	and what roads were taken
445.153	"and what roads could have been taken."""
449.127	"The name of the book is ""Islam Without"
449.127	"Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."""
453.26	And as the subtitle suggests,
455.743	I looked at Islamic tradition
455.743	and the history of Islamic thought
458.792	from the perspective
458.792	of individual liberty,
460.894	and I tried to find what are the strengths
460.894	with regard to individual liberty.
464.884	And there are strengths
464.884	in Islamic tradition.
467.01	Islam, actually,
467.01	as a monotheistic religion,
469.347	which defined man
469.347	as a responsible agent by itself,
473.463	created the idea of the individual
473.463	in the Middle East,
476.1	and saved it from the communitarianism,
476.1	the collectivism of the tribe.
480.479	You can derive many ideas from that.
482.339	But besides that, I also saw
482.339	problems within Islamic tradition.
485.865	But one thing was curious:
487.396	most of those problems turn out to be
487.396	problems that emerged later,
490.827	not from the very divine core
490.827	of Islam, the Koran,
493.92	but from, again,
493.92	traditions and mentalities,
497.109	or the interpretations of the Koran
497.109	that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.
501.484	The Koran, for example,
501.484	doesn't condone stoning.
504.034	There is no punishment for apostasy.
506.398	There is no punishment
506.398	for personal sins like drinking.
510.027	These things which make Islamic law,
513.41	the troubling aspects of Islamic law,
516.238	were developed into later
516.238	interpretations of Islam.
519.358	Which means that Muslims can, today,
521.469	look at those things and say,
523.239	"""Well, the core of our religion"
523.239	is here to stay with us.
527.566	It's our faith,
527.566	and we will be loyal to it.
529.66	But we can change how it was interpreted,
531.66	because it was interpreted
531.66	according to the time
533.948	and milieu in the Middle Ages.
535.406	Now we're living in a different world,
537.287	with different values
537.287	"and political systems."""
539.511	That interpretation
539.511	is quite possible and feasible.
542.458	Now, if I were the only person
542.458	thinking that way,
545.989	we would be in trouble.
548.326	But that's not the case at all.
550.887	Actually, from the 19th century on,
553.818	there's a whole revisionist, reformist --
553.818	whatever you call it -- tradition,
559.8	a trend in Islamic thinking.
562.253	These were intellectuals or statesmen
565.1	of the 19th century,
565.1	and later, 20th century,
567.66	which looked at Europe, basically,
569.458	and saw that Europe
569.458	has many things to admire,
571.875	like science and technology.
573.388	But not just that;
573.388	also democracy, parliament,
576.228	the idea of representation,
577.856	the idea of equal citizenship.
579.66	These Muslim thinkers, intellectuals
579.66	and statesmen of the 19th century,
584.541	looked at Europe,
584.541	saw these things, and said,
586.711	"""Why don't we have these things?"""
588.324	And they looked back at Islamic tradition,
590.365	and saw that there are
590.365	problematic aspects,
592.801	but they're not the core of the religion,
592.801	so maybe they can be re-understood,
596.574	and the Koran can be reread
596.574	in the modern world.
599.652	That trend is generally called
599.652	Islamic modernism,
604.541	and it was advanced
604.541	by intellectuals and statesmen,
607.542	not just as an intellectual idea, though,
609.66	but also as a political program.
611.397	And that's why, actually,
611.397	in the 19th century,
613.608	the Ottoman Empire, which then
613.608	covered the whole Middle East,
617.224	made very important reforms --
619.464	reforms like giving Christians and Jews
619.464	an equal citizenship status,
624.074	accepting a constitution,
625.66	accepting a representative parliament,
627.536	advancing the idea of freedom of religion.
630.66	That's why the Ottoman Empire,
630.66	in its last decades,
633.66	turned into a proto-democracy,
633.66	a constitutional monarchy,
637.585	and freedom was a very important
637.585	political value at the time.
640.861	Similarly, in the Arab world,
642.661	there was what the great Arab
642.661	historian Albert Hourani defines
646.294	as the Liberal Age.
647.469	"He has a book, ""Arabic Thought"
647.469	"in the Liberal Age,"""
650.036	and the Liberal Age, he defines
650.036	as 19th century and early 20th century.
655.01	Quite notably, this was the dominant trend
655.01	in the early 20th century
659.66	among Islamic thinkers
659.66	and statesmen and theologians.
663.493	But there is a very curious pattern
663.493	in the rest of the 20th century,
667.365	because we see a sharp decline
667.365	in this Islamic modernist line.
671.66	And in place of that,
673.331	what happens is that Islamism grows
673.331	as an ideology which is authoritarian,
679.774	which is quite strident,
681.66	which is quite anti-Western,
684.131	and which wants to shape society
684.131	based on a utopian vision.
687.787	So Islamism is the problematic idea
690.842	that really created a lot of problems
690.842	in the 20th-century Islamic world.
695.572	And even the very extreme
695.572	forms of Islamism
698.965	led to terrorism in the name of Islam --
702.113	which is actually a practice
702.113	that I think is against Islam,
704.977	but some, obviously, extremists,
704.977	did not think that way.
707.987	But there is a curious question:
709.66	If Islamic modernism was so popular
709.66	in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
714.66	why did Islamism become so popular
714.66	in the rest of the 20th century?
719.241	And this is a question, I think,
719.241	which needs to be discussed carefully.
722.66	In my book, I went
722.66	into that question as well.
724.895	And actually, you don't need to be
724.895	a rocket scientist to understand that.
728.49	Just look at the political
728.49	history of the 20th century,
731.168	and you see things have changed a lot.
733.113	The contexts have changed.
734.488	In the 19th century,
735.869	when Muslims were looking
735.869	at Europe as an example,
738.707	they were independent;
738.707	they were more self-confident.
741.437	In the early 20th century,
741.437	with the fall of the Ottoman Empire,
744.462	the whole Middle East was colonized.
747.278	And when you have colonialization,
747.278	what do you have?
749.787	You have anti-colonialization.
751.66	So Europe is not just
751.66	an example now to emulate;
754.66	it's an enemy to fight and to resist.
757.818	So there's a very sharp decline
757.818	in liberal ideas in the Muslim world,
762.169	and what you see is more of a defensive,
762.169	rigid, reactionary strain,
767.464	which led to Arab socialism,
767.464	Arab nationalism
769.685	and ultimately to the Islamist ideology.
772.66	And when the colonial period ended,
775.452	what you had in place of that
775.452	was generally secular dictators,
780.129	which say they're a country,
781.774	but did not bring
781.774	democracy to the country,
783.851	and established their own dictatorship.
785.753	And I think the West,
785.753	at least some powers in the West,
789.24	particularly the United States,
790.792	made the mistake of supporting
790.792	those secular dictators,
793.479	thinking that they were more
793.479	helpful for their interests.
796.763	But the fact that those dictators
796.763	suppressed democracy in their country
800.571	and suppressed Islamic
800.571	groups in their country
802.787	actually made the Islamists
802.787	much more strident.
805.284	So in the 20th century,
806.66	you had this vicious cycle
806.66	in the Arab world,
808.839	where you have a dictatorship
808.839	suppressing its own people,
811.866	including the Islamic pious,
813.66	and they're reacting in reactionary ways.
816.938	There was one country, though,
818.66	which was able to escape or stay away
818.66	from that vicious cycle.
823.781	And that's the country
823.781	where I come from, Turkey.
826.913	Turkey has never been colonized,
829.175	so it remained as an independent nation
829.175	after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.
832.883	That's one thing to remember;
834.323	it did not share
834.323	the same anti-colonial hype
837.209	that you can find in some other
837.209	countries in the region.
839.903	Secondly, and most importantly,
841.464	Turkey became a democracy
843.047	earlier than any of the countries
843.047	we are talking about.
845.66	In 1950, Turkey had the first
845.66	free and fair elections,
848.256	which ended the more
848.256	autocratic secular regime,
850.894	which was in the beginning of Turkey.
852.744	And the pious Muslims in Turkey
854.73	saw that they could change
854.73	the political system by voting.
858.823	And they realized that democracy
858.823	is something compatible with Islam,
862.357	compatible with their values,
863.81	and they've been supportive of democracy.
865.811	That's an experience
867.66	that not every other Muslim nation
867.66	in the Middle East had,
870.468	until very recently.
871.66	Secondly, in the past two decades,
873.927	thanks to globalization,
873.927	thanks to the market economy,
876.66	thanks to the rise of a middle class,
878.982	we in Turkey see what I define
878.982	as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.
884.326	Now, there's the more urban
884.326	middle-class pious Muslims
888.198	who, again, look at their tradition
890.354	and see that there are
890.354	some problems in the tradition,
893.264	and understand that they need to be
893.264	changed and questioned and reformed.
896.722	And they look at Europe,
896.722	and see an example, again, to follow.
900.223	They see an example, at least,
900.223	to take some inspiration from.
903.16	That's why the EU process,
903.16	Turkey's effort to join the EU,
907.093	has been supported inside Turkey
907.093	by the Islamic pious,
910.775	while some secular nationalists
910.775	were against it.
913.793	Well, that process
913.793	has been a little bit blurred
916.123	by the fact that not all
916.123	Europeans are that welcoming,
918.731	but that's another discussion.
920.329	But the pro-EU sentiment
920.329	in Turkey in the past decade
923.816	has become almost an Islamic cause
923.816	and supported by the Islamic liberals
927.836	and the secular liberals
927.836	as well, of course.
930.414	And thanks to that,
931.71	Turkey has been able
931.71	to reasonably create a success story
934.977	in which Islam and the most pious
934.977	understandings of Islam
939.826	have become part of the democratic game,
941.837	and even contributes to the democratic
941.837	and economic advance of the country.
946.565	And this has been
946.565	an inspiring example right now
950.257	for some of the Islamic movements
952.319	or some of the countries
952.319	in the Arab world.
954.493	You must have all seen the Arab Spring,
956.66	which began in Tunis and in Egypt.
959.426	Arab masses just revolted
959.426	against their dictators.
963.863	They were asking for democracy;
963.863	they were asking for freedom.
967.282	And they did not turn out to be
967.282	the Islamist boogeyman
969.922	that the dictators were always using
969.922	to justify their regime.
975.089	"They said, ""We want freedom;"
975.089	we want democracy.
977.535	We are Muslim believers,
979.226	but we want to be living
979.226	"as free people in free societies."""
983.513	Of course, this is a long road.
985.896	Democracy is not an overnight
985.896	achievement; it's a process.
989.199	But this is a promising era
989.199	in the Muslim world.
993.189	And I believe that the Islamic modernism
993.189	which began in the 19th century,
996.83	but which had a setback
996.83	in the 20th century
999.064	because of the political
999.064	troubles of the Muslim world,
1001.647	is having a rebirth.
1003.225	And I think the takeaway message
1003.225	from that would be that Islam,
1007.911	despite some of the skeptics in the West,
1010.467	has the potential in itself
1012.367	to create its own way to democracy,
1012.367	create its own way to liberalism,
1015.97	create its own way to freedom.
1017.53	They just should be allowed
1017.53	to work for that.
1020.092	Thanks so much.
1021.28	(Applause)
