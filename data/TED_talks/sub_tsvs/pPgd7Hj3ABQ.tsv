12.682	I want to tell you
12.682	about the future of money.
16.467	Let's start with a story
16.467	about this culture
19.088	that lived in Micronesia
19.088	in the early 1900s, called the Yap.
23.3	Now, I want to tell you about the Yap
25.107	because their form of money
25.107	is really interesting.
27.997	They use these limestone discs
27.997	called Rai stones.
31.659	Now, the Yap don't actually
31.659	move these Rai stones around
35.41	or exchange them the way
35.41	we do with our coins,
38.231	because Rai stones can get
38.231	to be pretty massive.
41.72	The largest is about four tons
41.72	and 12 feet across.
46.072	So the Yap just keep track
46.072	of who owns part of what stone.
52.051	There's a story about these sailors
54.162	that were transporting a stone
54.162	across the ocean
56.842	when they ran into some trouble
56.842	and the stone actually fell in.
61.574	The sailors got back to the main island
63.92	and they told everyone what had happened.
66.201	And everyone decided that, actually, yes,
68.974	the sailors had the stone
68.974	and -- why not? -- it still counted.
73.372	Even though it was
73.372	at the bottom of the ocean,
75.59	it was still part of the Yap economy.
78.573	You might think that this
78.573	was just a small culture
81.766	a hundred years ago.
83.158	But things like this happen
83.158	in the Western world as well,
86.33	and the Yap actually still use
86.33	a form of these stones.
90.36	In 1932, the Bank of France
90.36	asked the United States
94.812	to convert their holdings
94.812	from dollars into gold.
98.749	But it was too inconvenient
98.749	to think about actually shipping
102.118	all of that gold over to Europe.
104.071	So instead, someone went to where
104.071	that gold was being stored
107.928	and they just labeled it
107.928	as belonging to France now.
112.006	And everyone agreed
112.006	that France owned the gold.
115.843	It's just like those Rai stones.
118.517	The point I want to make
118.517	with these two examples
120.862	is that there's nothing
120.862	inherently valuable
124.274	about a dollar or a stone or a coin.
128.09	The only reason these things
128.09	have any value
130.806	is because we've all decided they should.
133.398	And because we've decided that,
135.251	they do.
137.223	Money is about the exchanges
137.223	and the transactions
141.387	that we have with each other.
144.042	Money isn't anything objective.
146.874	It's about a collective story
146.874	that we tell each other about value.
152.101	A collective fiction.
154.17	And that's a really powerful concept.
158.059	In the past two decades,
159.55	we've begun to use digital money.
161.843	So I get paid via direct deposit,
164.54	I pay my rent via bank transfer,
167.047	I pay my taxes online.
169.015	And every month,
170.191	a small amount of money
170.191	is deducted from my paycheck
172.98	and invested in mutual funds
172.98	in my retirement account.
177.12	All of these interactions
178.653	are literally just changing
178.653	1's and 0's on computers.
182.735	There's not even anything physical,
182.735	like a stone or a coin.
188.32	Digital money makes it
188.32	so that I can pay someone around the world
191.627	in seconds.
193.901	Now when this works,
195.516	it's because there are large institutions
195.516	underwriting every 1 or 0
200.385	that changes on a computer.
202.338	And when it doesn't,
203.527	it's often the fault
203.527	of those large institutions.
205.949	Or at least, it's up to them
205.949	to fix the problem.
208.916	And a lot of times, they don't.
210.862	There's a lot of friction in the system.
213.938	How long did it take
213.938	the US credit card companies
216.837	to implement chip and pin?
218.908	Half my credit cards
218.908	still don't work in Europe.
222.739	That's friction.
224.58	Transferring money across borders
224.58	and across currencies
228.496	is really expensive:
230.807	friction.
232.292	An entrepreneur in India
232.292	can set up an online business in minutes,
237.239	but it's hard for her
237.239	to get loans and to get paid:
241.512	friction.
243.701	Our access to digital money
243.701	and our ability to freely transact
248.569	is being held captive
248.569	by these gatekeepers.
251.536	And there's a lot of impediments
251.536	in the system slowing things down.
256.498	That's because digital money
256.498	isn't really mine,
260.064	it's entries in databases
260.064	that belong to my bank,
263.662	my credit card company
263.662	or my investment firm.
266.839	And these companies
266.839	"have the right to say ""no."""
270.856	If I'm a PayPal merchant
272.672	and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,
277.167	that's it.
278.347	My account gets frozen,
278.347	and I can't get paid.
284.789	These institutions are standing
284.789	in the way of innovation.
289.946	How many of you use
289.946	Facebook photos, Google Photos,
294.37	Instagram?
295.977	My photos are everywhere.
298.347	They are on my phone,
298.347	they're on my laptop,
300.856	they're on my old phone,
300.856	they're in Dropbox.
303.396	They're on all these different
303.396	websites and services.
306.252	And most of these services
306.252	don't work together.
310.816	They don't inter-operate.
313.538	And as a result,
315.055	my photo library is a mess.
318.469	The same thing happens
320.235	when institutions control
320.235	the money supply.
323.962	A lot of these services
323.962	don't inter-operate,
326.721	and as a result, this blocks
326.721	what we can do with payment.
330.185	And it makes transaction costs go up.
333.723	So far, we've been through
333.723	two phases of money.
337.952	In an analog world, we had
337.952	to deal with these physical objects,
341.94	and money moved at a certain speed --
341.94	the speed of humans.
346.896	In a digital world, money can reach
346.896	much farther and is much faster,
351.789	but we're at the mercy
351.789	of these gatekeeper institutions.
355.222	Money only moves at the speed of banks.
360.008	We're about to enter a new phase of money.
363.158	The future of money is programmable.
367.034	When we combine software and currency,
370.485	money becomes more
370.485	than just a static unit of value,
374.286	and we don't have to rely
374.286	on institutions for security.
378.176	In a programmable world,
379.729	we remove humans
379.729	and institutions from the loop.
384.61	And when this happens,
385.993	we won't even feel like
385.993	we're transacting anymore.
389.683	Money will be directed by software,
391.981	and it will just safely and securely flow.
396.828	Cryptocurrencies are the first step
396.828	of this evolution.
400.787	Cryptocurrencies are digital money
402.466	that isn't run by any government or bank.
405.358	It's money designed to work
405.358	in a world without intermediaries.
410.153	Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous
410.153	cryptocurrency,
413.21	but there are hundreds of them.
414.931	There's Ethereum, Litecoin,
414.931	Stellar, Dogecoin,
418.432	and those are just a few
418.432	of the more popular ones.
421.408	And these things are real money.
424.507	The sushi restaurant down my street
426.386	takes Bitcoin.
427.966	I have an app on my phone
427.966	that I can use to buy sashimi.
433.009	But it's not just for small transactions.
435.453	In March, there was a transaction
435.453	that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.
440.719	That's the equivalent
440.719	of 40 million US dollars.
445.445	Cryptocurrencies are based on
445.445	a special field of mathematics
449	called cryptography.
451.023	Cryptography is the study
451.023	of how to secure communication,
454.818	and it's about two
454.818	really important things:
457.541	masking information so it can
457.541	be hidden in plain sight,
461.143	and verifying a piece
461.143	of information's source.
465.154	Cryptography underpins
465.154	so many of the systems around us.
469.387	And it's so powerful that at times
471.937	the US government has actually
471.937	classified it as a weapon.
476.591	During World War II,
476.591	breaking cryptosystems like Enigma
481.092	was critical to decoding
481.092	enemy transmissions
484.42	and turning the tide of the war.
487.118	Today, anyone with a modern
487.118	web browser is running
490.436	a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.
493.03	It's what we use to secure
493.03	our interactions on the Internet.
497.015	It's what makes it safe for us
497.015	to type our passwords in
500.2	and to send financial
500.2	information to websites.
503.322	So what the banks used to give us --
506.173	trustworthy digital money transfer --
508.417	we can now get with a clever
508.417	application of cryptography.
513.202	And this means that we don't
513.202	have to rely on the banks anymore
516.133	to secure our transactions.
518.248	We can do it ourselves.
520.857	Bitcoin is based on the very same
520.857	idea that the Yap used,
525.62	this collective global
525.62	knowledge of transfers.
529.852	In Bitcoin, I spend
529.852	by transferring Bitcoin,
533.488	and I get paid when someone
533.488	transfers Bitcoin to me.
538.313	Imagine that we had this magic paper.
541.711	So the way that this paper works
541.711	is I can give you a sheet of it
545.323	and if you write something on it,
547.077	it will magically appear
547.077	on my piece as well.
550.721	Let's say we just give everyone this paper
553.591	and everyone writes down
553.591	the transfers that they're doing
557.443	in the Bitcoin system.
559.688	All of these transfers get copied
559.688	around to everyone else's pieces of paper.
563.658	And I can look at mine
565.7	and I'll have a list of all
565.7	of the transfers that are happening
569.249	in the entire Bitcoin economy.
571.779	This is actually what's happening
571.779	with the Bitcoin blockchain,
575.365	which is a list of all
575.365	of the transactions in Bitcoin.
579.185	Except, it's not done through paper.
582.023	It's done through computer code,
583.743	running on thousands
583.743	of networked computers
586.43	around the world.
589.235	All of these computers
589.235	are collectively confirming
593.003	who owns what Bitcoin.
594.911	So the Bitcoin blockchain
594.911	is core to how Bitcoin works.
598.348	But where do bitcoins actually come from?
601.93	Well, the code is designed
601.93	to create new Bitcoin
605.814	according to a schedule.
607.68	And the way that it works
607.68	is that to get those Bitcoin,
611.12	I have to solve a puzzle --
611.12	a random cryptographic puzzle.
617.069	Imagine that we had 15 dice,
619.504	and we were throwing these dice
619.504	over and over again.
622.603	Whenever the dice come up all sixes,
625.059	we say that we win.
627.095	This is very close to what these computers
627.095	are all actually doing.
630.995	They're trying over and over again
630.995	to land on the right number.
634.686	And when they do,
636.067	we say that they've solved the puzzle.
639.559	The computer that solves the puzzle
642.023	publishes its solution
642.023	to the rest of the network
644.965	and collects its reward: new bitcoins.
648.75	And in the act of solving this puzzle,
651.008	these computers are actually
651.008	helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain
655.108	and add to the list of transactions.
657.866	There are actually people
657.866	all over the world running this software,
663.507	and we call them Bitcoin miners.
666.438	Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.
669.626	You can go download the software right now
672.441	and run it in your computer
672.441	and try to collect some bitcoins.
676.4	I can't say that I would recommend it,
678.268	because right now, the puzzle is so hard
678.268	and the network is so powerful,
683.393	that if I tried to mine
683.393	Bitcoin on my laptop,
686.346	I probably wouldn't see any
686.346	for about two million years.
690.396	The miners, professional miners,
690.396	use this special hardware
694.667	that's designed to solve
694.667	the puzzle really fast.
697.976	Now, the Bitcoin network
697.976	and all of this special hardware,
701.842	there are estimates
701.842	that the amount of energy it uses
704.901	is equivalent to that of a small country.
708.252	So, the first set of cryptocurrencies
710.776	are a little bit slow
710.776	and a little bit cumbersome.
714.331	But the next generation is going
714.331	to be so much better and so much faster.
718.744	Cryptocurrencies are the first step
721.173	to a world with a global
721.173	programmable money.
725.634	And in a world with programmable money,
728.431	I can pay anyone else securely
731.982	without having to sign up
731.982	or ask permission,
735.579	or do a conversion or worry
735.579	about my money getting stuck.
740.428	And I can send money around the world.
743.482	This is a really amazing thing.
746.231	It's the idea of permission-less innovation.
751.447	The Internet caused
751.447	an explosion of innovation,
755.195	because it was built upon
755.195	an open architecture.
759.286	And just like the Internet
759.286	changed the way we communicate,
763.104	programmable money is going
763.104	to change the way we pay,
766.404	allocate and decide on value.
769.716	So what kind of world
769.716	does programmable money create?
772.238	Imagine a world where I can
772.238	rent out my healthcare data
776.478	to a pharmaceutical company.
779.063	They can run large-scale data analysis
781.592	and provide me with a cryptographic proof
783.988	that shows they're only using my data
783.988	in a way that we agreed.
788.138	And they can pay me
788.138	for what they find out.
791.529	Instead of signing up
791.529	for streaming services
794.262	and getting a cable bill,
795.855	what if my television analyzed
795.855	my watching habits
798.885	and recommended well-priced content
798.885	that fit within my budget
802.581	that I would enjoy?
804.604	Imagine an Internet without ads,
807.494	because instead of paying
807.494	with our attention when we view content,
811.525	we just pay.
813.831	Interestingly, things like micro-payments
816.166	are actually going to change
816.166	the way security works in our world,
819.345	because once we're better able
819.345	to allocate value,
822.064	people will use their money
822.064	and their energies
825.112	for more constructive things.
827.727	If it cost a fraction of a cent
827.727	to send an email,
830.34	would we still have spam?
832.674	We're not at this world yet,
834.901	but it's coming.
836.382	Right now, it's like we're in a world
836.382	that is seeing the first automobile.
841.579	The first cryptocurrency,
841.579	like the first car,
845.533	is slow and hard to understand
845.533	and hard to use.
850.095	Digital money,
850.095	like the horse and carriage,
852.665	works pretty well,
854.219	and the whole world economy
854.219	is built on it.
858.386	If you were the first person on your block
860.484	to get a car with an internal
860.484	combustion engine,
863.279	your neighbors would probably
863.279	think you were crazy:
866.321	"""Why would you want"
866.321	this large, clunky machine
868.818	that breaks down all the time,
868.818	that lights on fire,
871.747	"and is still slower than a horse?"""
874.928	But we all know how that story turns out.
878.431	We're entering a new era
878.431	of programmable money.
882.025	And it's very exciting,
882.025	but it's also a little bit scary.
886.691	Cryptocurrencies can be used
886.691	for illegal transactions,
890.229	just like cash is used for crime
890.229	in the world today.
894.497	When all of our transactions are online,
896.999	what does that mean for surveillance --
896.999	who can see what we do?
902.115	Who's advantaged
902.115	in this new world and who isn't?
905.226	Will I have to start to pay for things
905.226	that I didn't have to pay for before?
909.372	Will we all become slaves
909.372	to algorithms and utility functions?
915.114	All new technology comes with trade-offs.
918.012	The Internet brought us
918.012	a lot of ways to waste time.
922.375	But it also greatly
922.375	increased productivity.
925.731	Mobile phones are annoying
927.261	because they make me feel
927.261	like I have to stay connected to work
930.269	all the time.
931.448	But they also help me stay connected
931.448	to friends and family.
935.274	The new sharing economy
935.274	is going to eliminate some jobs.
940.165	But it's also going to create
940.165	new, flexible forms of employment.
944.601	With programmable money,
946.551	we decouple the need
946.551	for large, trusted institutions
951.527	from the architecture of the network.
954.57	And this pushes innovation in money
954.57	out to the edges, where it belongs.
960.96	Programmable money democratizes money.
964.461	And because of this,
964.461	things are going to change and unfold
967.243	in ways that we can't even predict.
970.488	Thank you.
971.674	(Applause)
