12.16	This is the first of two
12.16	rather extraordinary photographs
15.461	I'm going to show you today.
16.835	It was taken 18 years ago.
18.437	I was 19 years old at the time.
19.962	I had just returned
21.137	from one of the deepest dives
21.137	I'd ever made at that time --
23.947	a little over 200 feet.
25.129	And I had caught this little fish.
27.098	It turns out that particular one
27.098	was the first of its kind
29.892	ever taken alive.
31.07	I'm not just an ichthyologist,
31.07	I'm a bona fide fish nerd.
33.768	And to a fish nerd,
33.768	this is some pretty exciting stuff.
36.489	More exciting was the fact
36.489	that the person who took this photo
39.434	is a guy named Jack Randall,
40.794	the greatest living
40.794	ichthyologist on earth --
43.601	the Grand Poobah
43.601	of fish nerds, if you will.
46.165	And so, it was really exciting
46.165	to me to have this moment in time.
51.091	It set the course for the rest of my life.
53.215	But really, the most significant,
53.215	most profound thing about this picture
56.686	is it was taken two days
56.686	before I was completely paralyzed
59.449	from the neck down.
60.635	I made a really stupid kind of mistake
63.008	that most 19-year-old males do
63.008	when they think they're immortal,
66.072	and I got a bad case of the bends
66.072	and was paralyzed,
68.667	and had to be flown back for treatment.
72.316	I learned two really
72.316	important things that day.
74.79	The first thing I learned -- well,
74.79	I'm mortal. That's a really big one.
78.204	And the second thing I learned
78.204	was that I knew, with profound certainty,
81.677	that this is exactly what I was going
81.677	to do for the rest of my life.
84.941	I had to focus all my energies
86.593	towards going to find
86.593	new species of things
89.736	down on deep coral reefs.
91.508	When you think of a coral reef,
91.508	this is what most people think of:
94.649	these big, hard, elaborate corals,
96.443	lots of bright, colorful
96.443	fishes and things.
98.486	But this is really
98.486	just the tip of the iceberg.
100.716	If you look at this diagram
100.716	of a coral reef,
102.831	we know a lot about that part
102.831	up near the top.
105.005	The reason we know so much about it
107.36	is scuba divers can very easily
107.36	go down there and access it.
110.224	There is a problem with scuba, though,
112.36	in that it imposes some limitations
112.36	on how deep you can go.
115.152	It turns out that depth is about 200 feet.
117.191	I'll get into why that is
117.191	in just a minute,
119.532	but the point is, scuba divers
119.532	generally stay less than 100 feet deep,
123.082	and very rarely go much below this,
123.082	at least, not with any kind of sanity.
126.63	So to go deeper, most biologists
126.63	have turned to submersibles.
130.186	Now, submersibles are great,
130.186	wonderful things,
132.36	but if you're going to spend 30,000
132.36	dollars a day to use one of these things
136.039	and it's capable of going 2,000 feet,
137.857	you're not going to go farting around
137.857	up here in a couple of hundred feet,
141.36	you're going to go way down deep.
143.158	So the bottom line is, almost
143.158	all research using submersibles
146.051	has taken place well below 500 feet.
147.815	Now, it's pretty obvious at this point
149.661	there's a zone here in the middle.
151.313	That's the zone
152.608	that centers around my own
152.608	personal pursuit of happiness.
155.338	I want to find out what's in this zone;
155.338	we know almost nothing about it.
158.76	Scuba divers can't get there,
158.76	submarines go right on past it.
161.761	It took me a year to learn to walk again
161.761	after my diving accident in Palau.
165.332	During that year,
166.507	I spent a lot of time learning
166.507	about the physics and physiology of diving
169.97	and how to overcome these limitations.
171.807	I'm just going to show you a basic idea.
173.753	We're all breathing air right now.
175.408	Air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,
179.447	It's in our lungs.
180.621	And there's a phenomenon
180.621	called Henry's law,
182.709	that says gases will dissolve into a fluid
184.739	in proportion to the partial pressures
184.739	you're exposing them to.
187.737	So, basically the gas
187.737	dissolves into our body.
189.92	The oxygen is bound by metabolism,
189.92	we use it for energy.
192.572	The nitrogen sort of floats around
192.572	in our blood and tissues.
195.417	That's fine, it's how we're designed.
197.36	The problem happens
197.36	when you go underwater.
199.395	The deeper you go underwater,
199.395	the higher the pressure is.
202.222	If you were to go down
202.222	to a depth of about 130 feet,
204.787	which is the recommended
204.787	limit for most scuba divers,
207.336	you'd get this pressure effect.
208.858	The effect of that pressure is you have
208.858	an increased density of gas molecules
212.565	in every breath you take.
213.805	Over time, those gas molecules
213.805	dissolve into your blood and tissues
217.668	and start to fill you up.
219.105	Now, if you were to go
219.105	down to, say, 300 feet,
221.772	you don't have five times as many
221.772	gas molecules in your lungs,
224.734	you've got 10 times as many
224.734	gas molecules in your lungs.
227.386	And, sure enough, they dissolve
227.386	into your blood and tissues as well.
230.691	And if you were to go down to where
230.691	there's 15 times as much --
233.796	the deeper you go, the more
233.796	exacerbating the problem becomes.
236.829	The limitation of diving with air
236.829	is all those dots in your body,
241.342	all the nitrogen and all the oxygen.
243.135	There are three basic
243.135	limitations of scuba diving.
245.859	The first limitation is the oxygen --
247.718	oxygen toxicity.
249.069	Now, we all know the song:
249.069	"""Love is like oxygen."
251.347	You get too much, you get too high.
251.347	"Not enough, and you're gonna die."""
254.666	Well, in the context of diving,
254.666	you get too much, you die also.
257.678	You die because oxygen
257.678	toxicity can cause a seizure.
260.702	It makes you convulse underwater --
260.702	not a good thing to happen underwater.
264.274	It happens because there's too much
264.274	concentration of oxygen in your body.
267.805	The nitrogen has two problems.
269.471	One of them is what Jacques Cousteau
269.471	"called ""rapture of the deep."""
273.868	It's nitrogen narcosis.
275.234	It makes you loopy; the deeper
275.234	you go, the loopier you get.
278.045	You don't want to drive drunk,
278.045	you don't want to dive drunk.
280.938	So that's a real big problem.
282.36	And of course, the third problem
283.927	is the one I found out
283.927	the hard way in Palau,
286.094	which is the bends.
287.276	One thing I forgot to mention
288.691	is that to obviate the problem
288.691	of nitrogen narcosis --
291.248	all of those blue dots in our body --
293.058	you remove the nitrogen
293.058	and replace it with helium.
295.482	Helium's a gas; there're a lot
295.482	of reasons why helium's good,
298.339	it's a tiny molecule, it's inert,
298.339	it doesn't give you narcosis.
301.35	So that's the basic concept we use.
303.076	But the theory's relatively easy.
304.679	The tricky part is the implementation.
306.536	So this is how I began about 15 years ago.
308.669	I'll admit, it wasn't exactly
308.669	the smartest of starts,
311.399	but you've got to start somewhere.
313.089	(Laughter)
314.121	At the time, I wasn't the only one
314.121	who didn't know what I was doing.
317.343	Almost nobody did.
318.526	This rig was actually used
318.526	for a dive of 300 feet.
320.89	But over time we got better at it,
322.549	and we came up with this really
322.549	sophisticated-looking rig
325.265	with four scuba tanks, five regulators
325.265	and all the right gas mixtures,
328.596	all that good stuff.
329.771	It was fine and dandy, it allowed us
329.771	to go down and find new species.
333.072	This picture was taken at 300 feet,
333.072	catching new species of fish.
336.148	The problem was
336.148	it didn't allow us much time.
338.275	For all its bulk and size, it only gave us
338.275	about 15 minutes at most
341.501	down at those sorts of depths.
343.037	We needed more time.
343.037	There had to be a better way.
345.398	And indeed, there is a better way.
347.096	In 1994, I was fortunate
347.096	enough to get access
349.28	to these prototype
349.28	closed-circuit rebreathers.
352.687	Closed-circuit rebreather:
352.687	what makes it different from scuba,
355.728	and why is it better?
356.913	Well, there are three main
356.913	advantages to a rebreather.
359.788	One, they're quiet,
359.788	they don't make any noise.
361.972	Two, they allow you to stay
361.972	underwater longer.
364.161	Three, they allow you to go deeper.
366.058	How is it that they do that?
367.439	In order to really understand
367.439	how they do that,
369.67	you have to look underneath the hood
369.67	and see what's going on.
372.583	There are three basic systems
372.583	to a closed-circuit rebreather.
375.478	The most fundamental
375.478	is called the breathing loop.
378.09	It's a breathing loop
378.09	because you breathe off of it;
380.556	it's a closed loop, and you breathe
380.556	the same gas around and around.
383.737	There's a mouthpiece
383.737	that you put in your mouth,
386.105	and there's a counter lung,
386.105	or in this case, two counter lungs.
389.154	The counter lungs aren't high tech,
389.154	they're simply flexible bags.
392.242	They allow you to mechanically
392.242	breathe, mechanically ventilate.
395.243	When you exhale, it goes
395.243	in the exhale counter lung;
397.718	when you inhale, it comes
397.718	from the inhale counter lung.
400.327	It's just pure mechanics, allowing you
400.327	to cycle air through this breathing loop.
404.136	The other component on a breathing loop
404.136	is the carbon-dioxide-absorbent canister.
408.364	Now, as we breathe,
408.364	we produce carbon dioxide,
411.26	and that carbon dioxide needs
411.26	to be scrubbed out of the system.
414.285	There's a chemical filter in there
415.957	that pulls the carbon dioxide
415.957	out of the breathing gas,
418.562	so that when it comes back to us,
418.562	it's safe to breathe again.
421.974	That's the breathing loop in a nutshell.
424.216	The second main component
424.216	of a closed-circuit rebreather
427.184	is the gas system.
428.55	The primary purpose of the gas system
428.55	is to provide oxygen,
432.024	to replenish the oxygen
432.024	that your body consumes.
434.664	So the main tank, the main critical thing,
436.779	is this oxygen gas
436.779	supply cylinder we have here.
439.644	But if we only had
439.644	an oxygen gas supply cylinder,
442.025	we wouldn't be able to go very deep,
443.765	because we'd run into
443.765	oxygen toxicity very quickly.
446.214	So we need another gas,
446.214	something to dilute the oxygen with.
449.36	And that, fittingly enough,
449.36	is called the diluent gas supply.
452.646	In our applications, we generally
452.646	put air inside this diluent gas supply,
457.106	because it's a very cheap
457.106	and easy source of nitrogen.
459.83	So that's where we get our nitrogen from.
461.831	But if we want to go deeper,
461.831	of course, we need another gas supply,
465.324	and helium is what
465.324	we really need to go deep.
467.459	Usually we'll have
467.459	a slightly larger cylinder,
469.631	mounted exterior
469.631	on the rebreather, like this.
471.822	That's what we use to inject,
471.822	as we start to do our deep dives.
474.869	We also have a second oxygen cylinder,
474.869	solely as a backup;
478.059	if there's a problem
478.059	with our first oxygen supply,
480.422	we can continue to breathe.
481.755	The way you manage all these different
481.755	gases and different gas supplies
485.24	is this really high-tech, sophisticated
485.24	gas block up on the front here,
488.655	where it's easy to reach.
489.887	It's got the valves and knobs
489.887	and things you need
492.203	to inject the right gases
492.203	at the right time.
494.286	Normally, you don't have to do that,
496.029	because all of it's done automatically
497.866	with the electronics,
497.866	the third system of a rebreather.
500.518	The most critical part of a rebreather
500.518	are the oxygen sensors.
503.467	You need three, so if one goes bad,
503.467	you know which one it is.
506.357	You need voting logic.
507.535	You also have three microprocessors.
509.464	Any one of those computers
509.464	can run the entire system,
511.968	so if you have to lose two of them,
513.67	there's back-up power supplies.
515.186	And there are multiple displays,
515.186	to get the information to the diver.
518.483	This is the high-tech gadgetry
518.483	that allows us to do what we do
521.999	on these deep dives.
523.257	I can talk about it all day --
523.257	just ask my wife --
525.688	but I want to move on
525.688	to something much more interesting.
528.391	I'm going to take you on a deep dive,
530.181	and show you what it's like to do one.
532.016	We start up on the boat,
533.191	For all this high-tech,
533.191	expensive equipment,
535.32	this is still the best way
535.32	to get in the water,
537.553	just flop over the side of the boat.
539.316	Now, as I showed you
539.316	in the earlier diagram,
541.567	these reefs that we dive on
541.567	start out near the surface
544.956	and they go almost vertically,
544.956	completely straight down.
547.628	So we drop in the water
547.628	and go over the edge of this cliff,
550.533	and then we start dropping,
550.533	dropping, dropping.
552.771	People ask if it takes
552.771	a long time to get there.
555.105	No; it only takes a couple minutes
555.105	to get down to three or four hundred feet,
558.822	which is what we're aiming for.
560.338	It's like skydiving in slow motion.
560.338	It's really very interesting.
563.428	"You ever see ""The Abyss,"""
564.74	where Ed Harris is sinking down
564.74	along the side of the wall?
567.55	That's what it feels like. Amazing.
569.297	And down there, you find that the water
569.297	is very clear, extremely clear,
572.718	because there's hardly any plankton.
574.465	When you turn on your light
574.465	and look around the caves,
577.026	you're confronted with a tremendous
577.026	amount of diversity,
579.683	much more than anyone used to believe.
581.52	Now, not all of it is new species --
583.278	that fish you see with the white stripe,
583.278	that's a known species.
587.003	But if you look carefully
587.003	into the cracks and crevices,
590.353	you'll see little things
590.353	scurrying all over the place.
593.457	There's a just unbelievable diversity.
595.944	It's not just fish, either.
597.294	These are crinoids, sponges, black corals.
597.294	There're some more fishes.
600.796	Those fishes that you see now
600.796	are new species.
603.082	They're still new species,
604.456	because I had a video camera
604.456	instead of my net,
606.702	so they're still waiting down there
606.702	for someone to go find them.
609.769	But this is what it looks like.
611.313	And this kind of habitat just goes
611.313	on and on and on for miles.
614.471	This is Papua, New Guinea.
616.429	Now little fishes and invertebrates
616.429	aren't the only things we see down there.
620.988	We also see sharks,
622.286	much more regularly
622.286	than I would have expected to.
624.691	We're not quite sure why.
625.916	What I want you to do now
625.916	is imagine yourself 400 feet underwater,
629.049	with all this high-tech gear on your back,
631.081	you're in a remote reef
631.081	off Papua, New Guinea,
633.253	thousands of miles from the nearest
633.253	recompression chamber,
636.038	and you're completely
636.038	surrounded by sharks.
638.473	(Video) Diver 1: (In squeaky voice)
638.473	Look at those ...
640.982	Diver 2: Uh, oh ...
642.169	Uh, oh!
643.344	Audience: (Laughter)
644.582	(Video) Diver 1: I think we have
644.582	their attention ...
647.131	Richard Pyle: When you start
647.131	talking like Donald Duck,
649.685	there's no situation in the world
649.685	that can seem tense.
652.282	(Laughter)
654.24	So we're down there --
654.24	this is at 400 feet.
657.178	That's looking straight up, by the way,
657.178	to give a sense of how far the surface is.
661.076	And if you're a biologist
661.076	and know about sharks,
663.348	and you want to assess,
663.348	how much jeopardy am I really in here,
666.622	there's one question that sort of jumps
666.622	to the forefront of your mind immediately,
672.534	which is --
673.714	(Video) Diver 1: What kind of sharks?
676.19	Diver 2: Silvertip sharks.
677.976	Diver 1: Oh.
679.166	RP: There are actually
679.166	three species of sharks here.
681.687	The silvertips are the ones
681.687	with the white edges on the fins,
684.599	and there're also gray reef sharks
684.599	and hammerheads off in the distance.
688.107	And yes, it's a little nerve-racking.
691.964	(Video) Diver 2: Hoo!
694.686	That little guy is frisky!
696.545	Audience: (Laughter)
699.842	Now, you've seen video like this on TV
699.842	a lot, and it's very intimidating.
704.341	I think it gives the wrong
704.341	impression about sharks;
706.758	they're actually not
706.758	very dangerous animals.
708.868	That's why we weren't worried much
708.868	and were joking around.
711.626	More people are killed
711.626	by pigs, by lightning strikes,
714.327	more people are killed
714.327	at soccer games in England.
716.686	There's a lot of other ways you can die.
718.757	And I'm not making that stuff up.
720.555	Coconuts! You can get killed by a coconut
720.555	more likely than killed by a shark.
724.281	So sharks aren't quite as dangerous
724.281	as most people make them out to be.
728.282	Now, I don't know if any of you get
728.282	US News and World Report --
731.361	I got the recent issue.
732.583	There's a cover story
732.583	about the great explorers of our time.
735.424	The last article is entitled,
735.424	"""No New Frontiers."""
739.148	It questions whether or not there
739.148	really are any new frontiers out there,
742.617	whether there are any true, hardcore
742.617	discoveries that can still be made.
746.045	My favorite line from the article:
747.694	[... 'discovery' can mean finding a guppy
747.694	"with an extra spine in its dorsal fin.""]"
751.587	I have to laugh; they don't call us
751.587	fish nerds for nothing.
754.378	We actually do get excited about finding
754.378	a new dorsal spine in a guppy.
757.742	But it's much more than that.
759.163	I want to show you a few of the guppies
759.163	we've found over the years.
762.763	This one -- you can see how ugly it is.
764.913	(Laughter)
765.962	Even if you ignore
765.962	the scientific value of this thing,
769.035	look at the monetary value of this thing.
771.036	A couple of these were sold
771.036	through the aquarium trade to Japan,
774.113	where they sold for 15,000 dollars apiece.
776.25	That's half a million dollars a pound.
779.485	Here's another new angelfish
779.485	we discovered.
781.532	This one we first discovered back
781.532	in the air days -- the bad old air days,
785.042	when we were doing
785.042	these kind of dives with air.
787.455	We were at 360 feet.
788.637	I remember coming up from one
788.637	of these deep dives and I had this fog,
791.919	and the narcosis takes a little while
791.919	to fade away, sort of like sobering up.
796.18	I had this vague recollection of seeing
796.18	this yellow fish with a black spot,
799.91	"and thought, ""Damn,"
799.91	I should have caught one --
802.281	"I think that's a new species."""
803.747	Eventually, I looked in my bucket.
805.398	Sure enough, I had caught one,
805.398	I just completely forgot.
808.403	So this one, we decided to give
808.403	the name Centropyge narcosis to.
812.281	That's its official scientific name,
814.268	in reference to its deep-dwelling habits.
816.254	This is another neat one.
817.471	When we first found it,
818.654	we weren't even sure
818.654	what family it belonged to,
820.937	so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,
822.874	since it looked like something
822.874	from one of those books.
825.476	Now, this one's pretty cool.
826.85	If you go to Papua, New Guinea
826.85	and go down 300 feet,
829.316	you'll see these big mounds.
830.696	This may be hard to see,
830.696	but they're a couple meters in diameter.
833.967	If you look closely, you'll see
833.967	there's a little white and gray fish
837.328	that hangs out near them.
838.559	It turns out this little white fish
838.559	builds these giant mounds,
841.594	one pebble at a time.
843.142	It's extraordinary
843.142	to find something like this.
845.36	It's not just new species,
845.36	it's new behaviors, new ecology,
848.155	all kind of new things.
849.33	What I'm going to show you now, quickly,
851.279	is a sampling of the new species
851.279	we've discovered.
853.7	What's extraordinary is not just
853.7	the number of species we're finding --
857.081	though as you can see,
857.081	that's pretty amazing;
859.251	this is only half of what we've found --
861.188	what's extraordinary
861.188	is how quickly we find them.
864.108	We're up to seven new species per hour
864.108	of time we spend at that depth.
867.467	If you go to an Amazon jungle and fog
867.467	a tree, you may get a lot of bugs,
871.811	but for fishes,
871.811	there's nowhere in the world
873.932	you can get seven new species
873.932	per hour of time.
876.813	Now, we've done some
876.813	back-of-the-envelope calculations,
879.424	and we're predicting there are probably
879.424	about 2,000 to 2,500 new species
882.872	in the Indo-Pacific alone.
884.245	There are only five
884.245	to six thousand known species,
886.923	so a very large percentage
886.923	of what is out there isn't really known.
890.519	We thought we had a handle on all the reef
890.519	fish diversity -- evidently not.
894.123	I'm going to just close
894.123	on a very somber note.
896.369	At the beginning, I said I'd show you
896.369	two extraordinary photographs.
900.353	This is the second extraordinary
900.353	photograph I'm going to show you.
903.536	This one was taken at the exact moment
903.536	I was down there filming those sharks.
907.748	This was taken exactly
911.236	The reason this photograph
911.236	is extraordinary
913.36	is because it captures a moment
914.902	in the very last minute
914.902	of a person's life.
917.36	Less than 60 seconds after this picture
917.36	was taken, this guy was dead.
921.778	When we recovered his body,
921.778	we figured out what had gone wrong.
924.965	He had made a very simple mistake;
926.629	he turned the wrong valve
926.629	when he filled his cylinder.
929.185	he had 80 percent oxygen in his tank
929.185	when he should have had 40.
932.214	He had an oxygen toxicity
932.214	seizure and he drowned.
934.894	The reason I show this --
934.894	not to put a downer on everything --
937.842	but I just want to use it to key off
937.842	my philosophy of life in general,
941.755	which is that we all have two goals.
943.517	The first goal we share with every other
943.517	living thing on this planet,
946.785	which is to survive.
947.969	I call it perpetuation: the survival
947.969	of the species and survival of ourselves,
951.873	And those are both
951.873	about perpetuating the genome.
954.363	The second goal, for those of us
954.363	who have mastered the first goal --
957.631	call it spiritual fulfillment,
957.631	call it financial success,
962.034	you can call it any number
962.034	of different things.
964.385	I call it seeking joy,
964.385	this pursuit of happiness.
967.094	So, I guess my theme on this
967.094	is this guy lived his life to the fullest,
970.757	he absolutely did.
971.951	You have to balance those two goals.
973.761	If you live your whole life in fear --
975.652	I mean, life is a sexually transmitted
975.652	disease with 100 percent mortality.
980.225	So you can't live your life in fear.
982.409	(Laughter)
984.653	I thought that was an old one!
986.921	(Applause)
987.996	But at the same time, you don't want
987.996	to get so focused on rule number two,
992.161	goal number two,
993.637	that you neglect goal number one.
995.36	Because once you're dead, you really can't
995.36	enjoy anything after that.
998.629	So I wish you all the best of luck
998.629	in maintaining that balance
1001.629	in your future endeavors.
1002.845	Thanks.
