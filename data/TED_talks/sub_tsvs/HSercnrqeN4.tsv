12.24	Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking
12.24	about female friendship a lot,
15.8	and by the way, these two women,
18.08	I'm very honored to say,
19.48	have been my friends
19.48	for a very long time, too.
22.44	Jane Fonda: Yes we have.
23.68	PM: And one of the things
23.68	that I read about female friendship
27.2	is something that Cervantes said.
28.84	"He said, ""You can tell"
28.84	"a lot about someone,"""
32.24	in this case a woman,
33.48	"""by the company that she keeps."""
35.92	So let's start with --
37.16	(Laughter)
40.32	JF: We're in big trouble.
41.96	Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,
43.96	I'm extremely dry.
45.2	(Laughter)
53	JF: You're taking up our time.
55.64	We have a very limited --
56.96	LT: Just being with her
56.96	sucks the life out of me.
59.32	(Laughter)
62.12	JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.
63.88	Anyway -- sorry.
65.12	PM: So tell me, what do you
65.12	look for in a friend?
69.52	LT: I look for someone
69.52	who has a sense of fun,
72.12	who's audacious,
75.12	who's forthcoming, who has politics,
78.6	who has even a small scrap
78.6	of passion for the planet,
83.48	someone who's decent,
83.48	has a sense of justice
86.12	and who thinks I'm worthwhile.
88.24	(Laughter)
90.24	(Applause)
94.76	JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,
96.8	I don't even know what I would do
96.8	without my women friends.
99.64	"I mean it's, ""I have my friends,"
99.64	"therefore I am."""
102.68	LT: (Laughter)
103.92	JF: No, it's true.
105.16	I exist because I have
105.16	my women friends. They --
108.32	You're one of them.
109.56	I don't know about you. But anyway --
111.346	(Laughter)
112.52	You know, they make me stronger,
112.52	they make me smarter,
115.12	they make me braver.
116.72	They tap me on the shoulder when I might
116.72	be in need of course-correcting.
121.52	And most of them are
121.52	a good deal younger than me, too.
124.24	You know? I mean, it's nice --
124.24	LT: Thank you.
126.92	(Laughter)
129.4	JF: No, I do, I include you in that,
129.4	because listen, you know --
132.48	it's nice to have somebody still around
132.48	to play with and learn from
135.68	when you're getting toward the end.
137.6	I'm approaching --
137.6	I'll be there sooner than you.
139.92	LT: No, I'm glad to have you
139.92	parallel aging alongside me.
142.639	(Laughter)
144.72	JF: I'm showing you the way.
146.24	(Laughter)
147.48	LT: Well, you are and you have.
149.4	PM: Well, as we grow older,
150.76	and as we go through
150.76	different kinds of life's journeys,
153.64	what do you do to keep
153.64	your friendships vital and alive?
158.12	LT: Well you have to use a lot of --
159.88	JF: She doesn't invite me over much,
159.88	I'll tell you that.
162.56	LT: I have to use a lot of social media --
164.6	You be quiet now. And so --
166.12	(Laughter)
168.44	LT: And I look through my emails,
168.44	I look through my texts
171.48	to find my friends,
172.72	so I can answer them
172.72	as quickly as possible,
174.84	because I know they need my counsel.
177.28	(Laughter)
180.08	They need my support,
181.36	because most of my friends
181.36	are writers, or activists, or actors,
184.48	and you're all three ...
185.8	and a long string
185.8	of other descriptive phrases,
189.44	and I want to get to you
189.44	as soon as possible,
193.76	I want you to know that I'm there for you.
195.84	JF: Do you do emojis?
197.16	LT: Oh ...
197.16	JF: No?
199.08	LT: That's embarrassing.
199.08	JF: I'm really into emojis.
201.56	LT: No, I spell out my --
203	I spell out my words of happiness
203	and congratulations,
207.8	and sadness.
209.48	JF: You spell it right out --
210.92	LT: I spell it, every letter.
212.325	(Laughter)
213.92	JF: Such a purist.
215.12	You know, as I've gotten older,
217.08	I've understood more
217.08	the importance of friendships,
220.32	and so, I really make an effort
222.2	to reach out and make play dates --
222.2	not let too much time go by.
226.84	I read a lot
228.08	so, as Lily knows all too well,
230.04	my books that I like,
230.04	I send to my friends.
232.12	LT: When we knew we would be here today
234.08	you sent me a lot of books
234.08	about women, female friendships,
236.92	and I was so surprised
236.92	to see how many books,
240.48	how much research
240.48	has been done recently --
242.84	JF: And were you grateful?
242.84	LT: I was grateful.
245.36	(Laughter)
250.4	PM: And --
251.64	LT: Wait, no, it's really important
251.64	because this is another example
254.84	of how women are overlooked,
254.84	put aside, marginalized.
258.24	There's been very little
258.24	research done on us,
261.04	even though we volunteered lots of times.
263.04	JF: That's for sure.
264.32	(Laughter)
266.96	LT: This is really exciting,
266.96	and you all will be interested in this.
270.2	The Harvard Medical School study has shown
272.92	that women who have
272.92	close female friendships
277.16	are less likely to develop impairments --
280.8	physical impairments as they age,
282.96	and they are likely to be seen
282.96	to be living much more vital, exciting --
288.48	JF: And longer --
289.72	LT: Joyful lives.
290.96	JF: We live five years longer than men.
292.88	LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.
294.96	(Laughter)
298.72	LT: But the most important
298.72	part is they found --
301	the results were so exciting
301	and so conclusive --
304.88	the researchers found
306.8	that not having close female friends
306.8	is detrimental to your health,
312.56	as much as smoking or being overweight.
315.56	JF: And there's something else, too --
317.44	LT: I've said my part, so ...
318.88	(Laughter)
319.92	JF: OK, well, listen to my part,
319.92	because there's an additional thing.
323.6	Because they only --
323.6	for years, decades --
325.8	they only researched men when they
325.8	were trying to understand stress,
330.08	only very recently have they researched
330.08	what happens to women when we're stressed,
334.6	and it turns out
334.6	that when we're stressed -- women,
338.96	our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.
342.2	Which is a feel-good, calming,
342.2	stress-reducing hormone.
345.72	Which is also increased
345.72	when we're with our women friends.
350.8	And I do think that's one reason
350.8	why we live longer.
354.2	And I feel so bad for men
354.2	because they don't have that.
356.84	Testosterone in men
356.84	diminishes the effects of oxytocin.
361.08	LT: Well, when you and I
361.08	"and Dolly made ""9 to 5"" ..."
364.32	JF: Oh --
365.56	LT: We laughed, we did,
365.56	we laughed so much,
367.64	we found we had so much in common
367.64	and we're so different.
370.36	Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,
372.099	I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,
374.2	[Dolly's] a Southern kid
374.2	from a poor town in Tennessee,
378.92	and we found we were so in sync as women,
382.36	and we must have --
383.6	we laughed -- we must have added
383.6	at least a decade onto our lifespans.
389.76	JF: I think -- we sure
389.76	crossed our legs a lot.
392.56	(Laughter)
394.56	If you know what I mean.
397.2	LT: I think we all know what you mean.
399.4	(Laughter)
401.44	PM: You're adding decades
401.44	to our lives right now.
404.16	So among the books that Jane
404.16	sent us both to read on female friendship
409.12	was one by a woman we admire greatly,
409.12	Sister Joan Chittister,
413	who said about female friendship
415.12	that women friends
415.12	are not just a social act,
419.4	they're a spiritual act.
421.32	Do you think of your friends as spiritual?
423.56	Do they add something
423.56	spiritual to your lives?
426	LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.
430.04	Because -- especially people
430.04	you've known a long time,
433.12	people you've spent time with --
434.72	I can see the spiritual
434.72	essence inside them,
437.8	the tenderness, the vulnerability.
442.44	There's actually kind of a love,
442.44	an element of love in the relationship.
446.64	I just see deeply into your soul.
450.32	PM: Do you think that, Jane --
451.8	LT: But I have special powers.
454.12	JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.
456.04	There's business friends,
456.04	and party friends,
458.6	I've got a lot of those.
460.04	(Laughter)
462.04	But the oxytocin-producing
462.04	friendships have ...
467.32	They feel spiritual
467.32	because it's a heart opening, right?
471.84	You know, we go deep. And --
474.84	I find that I shed tears a lot
474.84	with my intimate friends.
481.04	Not because I'm sad but because
481.04	I'm so touched and inspired by them.
486.36	LT: And you know one of you
486.36	is going to go soon.
489.12	(Laughter)
494.52	PM: Well, two of us are sitting here,
494.52	Lily, which one are you talking about?
499	(Laughter)
500.4	And I always think, when women
500.4	talk about their friendships,
503.24	that men always look a little mystified.
506.52	What are the differences, in your opinion,
509.08	between men friendships
509.08	and women friendships?
512.08	JF: There's a lot of difference,
514.08	and I think we have to have
514.08	a lot of empathy for men --
517.04	(Laughter)
518.76	that they don't have what we have.
523.04	Which I think may be why they die sooner.
525.6	(Laughter)
527.159	I have a lot of compassion for men,
529.88	because women, no kidding, we --
533.52	women's relationships, our friendships
533.52	are full disclosure, we go deep.
539.16	They're revelatory.
541.76	We risk vulnerability --
541.76	this is something men don't do.
546.12	I mean how many times
546.12	"have I asked you, ""Am I doing OK?"""
549.68	"""Did I really screw up there?"""
551.96	PM: You're doing great.
553.36	(Laughter)
554.48	JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that
557.64	of our women friends,
558.88	and men don't.
560.92	You know, people describe women's
560.92	relationships as face-to-face,
564.84	whereas men's friendships
564.84	are more side-by-side.
567.88	LT: I mean most of the time
567.88	men don't want to reveal their emotions,
571.64	they want to bury deeper feelings.
573.36	I mean, that's the general,
573.36	conventional thought.
576.4	They would rather go off in their man cave
576.4	and watch a game or hit golf balls,
580.96	or talk about sports,
580.96	or hunting, or cars or have sex.
585.6	I mean, it's just the kind of --
585.6	it's a more manly behavior.
588.88	JF: You meant --
588.88	LT: They talk about sex.
591.2	I meant they might have sex
592.92	if they could get somebody
592.92	in their man cave to --
595.32	(Laughter)
598.36	JF: You know something, though,
598.36	that I find very interesting --
601.6	and again, psychologists didn't know this
601.6	until relatively recently --
606.2	is that men are born every bit
606.2	as relational as women are.
609.96	If you look at films
609.96	of newborn baby boys and girls,
613.6	you'll see the baby boys
613.6	just like the girls,
615.72	gazing into their mother's eyes,
618.08	you know, needing that relational
618.08	exchange of energy.
622.28	When the mother looks away,
622.28	they could see the dismay on the child,
627.6	even the boy would cry.
628.88	They need relationship.
630.76	So the question is why,
630.76	as they grow older, does that change?
634.76	And the answer is patriarchal culture,
637.12	which says to boys and young men
640.12	that to be needing of relationship,
640.12	to be emotional with someone is girly.
645.4	That a real man doesn't ask
645.4	directions or express a need,
651.08	they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.
653.4	They don't ask for help.
655	There's a quote that I really like,
656.72	"""Men fear that becoming 'we'"
656.72	"will erase his 'I'."""
661.48	You know, his sense of self.
663.2	Whereas women's sense of self
663.2	has always been kind of porous.
667.72	"But our ""we"" is our saving grace,"
671.56	it's what makes us strong.
674.04	It's not that we're better than men,
675.8	we just don't have
675.8	our masculinity to prove.
678.44	LT: And, well --
679.68	JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.
681.36	So we can express our humanity --
681.36	LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.
684.76	JF: I know you know who she is,
684.76	but I think it's a --
687.261	(Laughter)
689.32	No, but it's a great quote, I think.
691.2	We're not better than men, we just
691.2	don't have our masculinity to prove.
695.48	And that's really important.
696.88	LT: But men are
696.88	so inculcated in the culture
699.48	to be comfortable in the patriarchy.
702.64	And we've got to make
702.64	something different happen.
705.6	JF: Women's friendships
705.6	are like a renewable source of power.
709.8	LT: Well, that's what's exciting
709.8	about this subject.
712.28	It's because our friendships --
713.84	female friendships
713.84	are just a hop to our sisterhood,
718.48	and sisterhood can be
718.48	a very powerful force,
721.92	to give the world --
723.36	to make it what it should be --
725.2	the things that humans desperately need.
728.84	PM: It is why we're talking about it,
730.68	because women's friendships are,
732.4	as you said, Jane,
733.64	a renewable source of power.
735	So how do we use that power?
737.76	JF: Well, women are the fastest growing
737.76	demographic in the world,
741.16	especially older women.
742.4	And if we harness our power,
742.4	we can change the world.
746.48	And guess what? We need to.
748.04	(Applause)
750.2	And we need to do it soon.
751.52	And one of the things
751.52	that we need to do --
754.04	and we can do it as women --
755.6	for one thing, we kind of set
755.6	the consumer standards.
758.72	We need to consume less.
761.16	We in the Western world
761.16	need to consume less
764.16	and when we buy things, we need to
764.16	buy things that are made locally,
767.4	when we buy food, we need to buy food
767.4	that's grown locally.
770.52	We are the ones
770.52	that need to get off the grid.
773.76	We need to make ourselves
773.76	independent from fossil fuels.
779.52	And the fossil fuel companies --
781.52	the Exxons and the Shell Oils
781.52	and those bad guys --
784.68	cause they are --
785.92	are going to tell us that we can't do it
785.92	without going back to the Stone Age.
789.8	You know, that the alternatives
789.8	just aren't quite there yet,
792.68	and that's not true.
794.04	There are countries in the world right now
796.12	that are living mostly on renewable
796.12	energy and doing just fine.
799.48	And they tell us that if we do
799.48	wean ourselves from fossil fuel
803.64	that we're going to be
803.64	back in the Stone Age,
805.8	and in fact, if we begin
805.8	to use renewable energy,
810	and not drill in the Arctic,
810	and not drill --
812.19	LT: Oh, boy.
813.38	JF: And not drill
813.38	in the Alberta tar sands --
815.52	Right.
816.76	That we will be --
818.04	there will be more democracy
818.04	and more jobs and more well-being,
821.44	and it's women that are
821.44	going to lead the way.
823.68	LT: Maybe we have the momentum
823.68	to start a third-wave feminist movement
828.08	with our sisterhood around the world,
830.68	with women we don't see,
830.68	women we may never meet,
833.88	but we join together that way,
836.4	because --
837.64	Aristotle said --
839.92	most people --
841.16	people would die without male friendships.
844.08	"And the operative word here was ""male."""
847.36	Because they thought that friendships
847.36	should be between equals
850.32	and women were not considered equal --
852.56	JF: They didn't think
852.56	we had souls even, the Greeks.
855.04	LT: No, exactly. That shows you
855.04	just how limited Aristotle was.
858.92	(Laughter)
861.52	And wait, no, here's the best part.
863.44	It's like, you know,
863.44	men do need women now.
867.08	The planet needs women.
869.24	The US Constitution needs women.
871.72	We are not even in the Constitution.
874.52	JF: You're talking about
874.52	the Equal Rights Amendment.
877	LT: Right.
878.182	Justice Ginsberg said something like --
883.92	every constitution that's been written
883.92	since the end of World War II
887.52	included a provision that made women
887.52	citizens of equal stature,
892.52	but ours does not.
894.24	So that would be a good place to start.
896.16	Very, very mild --
898.24	JF: Right.
899.48	(Applause)
902.2	And gender equality, it's like a tide,
904.88	it would lift all boats, not just women.
906.84	PM: Needing new role models
906.84	on how to do that.
909.4	How to be friends,
910.84	how to think about our power
910.84	in different ways,
913.76	as consumers,
915	as citizens of the world,
916.68	and this is what makes Jane and Lily
919.12	a role model of how
919.12	women can be friends --
921.88	for a very long time,
923.52	and even if they occasionally disagree.
925.96	Thank you.
928.36	Thank you both.
929.6	(Applause)
930.84	JF: Thanks.
935.56	LT: Thank you.
936.8	JF: Thank you.
938.053	(Applause)
