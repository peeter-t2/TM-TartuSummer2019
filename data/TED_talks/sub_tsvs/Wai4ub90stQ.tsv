13.228	So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,
17.518	former arts advocate,
19.59	trained in architecture and art history,
23.383	and I want to talk to you today not about design
26.517	but about America
28.953	and how America can be more economically resilient,
33.158	how America can be healthier,
35.483	and how America can be
37.136	more environmentally sustainable.
39.754	And I realize this is a global forum,
42.172	but I think I need to talk about America
44.241	because there is a history,
45.824	in some places, not all,
47.511	of American ideas being appropriated,
49.961	being emulated, for better or for worse,
52.493	around the world.
53.834	And the worst idea we've ever had
55.985	is suburban sprawl.
58.352	It's being emulated in many places as we speak.
61.723	By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization
64.386	of the landscape and the creation of the landscape
66.79	around the requirement of automobile use,
71.126	and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom
73.769	has become a gas-belching,
77.52	time-wasting and life-threatening
80.12	prosthetic device
81.553	that many of us need just to,
83.189	most Americans, in fact, need,
84.777	just to live their daily lives.
87.097	And there's an alternative.
88.681	You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.
90.269	Well, in America, that living in cities,
92.21	for many of them, they're living in cities still
93.868	where they're dependent on that automobile.
96.134	And what I work for, and to do,
99.113	is to make our cities more walkable.
101.799	But I can't give design arguments for that
104.322	that will have as much impact
106.011	as the arguments that I've learned
107.927	from the economists, the epidemiologists
111.444	and the environmentalists.
113.16	So these are the three arguments that I'm going
114.421	to give you quickly today.
117.532	When I was growing up in the '70s,
119.016	the typical American spent one tenth of their income,
122.651	American family, on transportation.
125.89	Since then, we've doubled the number of roads
128.475	in America, and we now spend one fifth
131.252	of our income on transportation.
133.913	Working families, which are defined as
135.974	earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars
137.898	a year in America
139.857	are spending more now on transportation
142.361	than on housing, slightly more,
144.599	"because of this phenomenon called ""drive till you qualify,"""
147.832	finding homes further and further and further
150.25	from the city centers and from their jobs,
153.177	so that they're locked in this, two, three hours,
155.702	four hours a day of commuting.
157.899	And these are the neighborhoods, for example,
159.373	in the Central Valley of California
161.795	that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst
164.902	and when the price of gas went up;
167.124	they were decimated.
169.392	And in fact, these are many
170.658	of the half-vacant communities that you see today.
173.261	Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,
176.442	it goes underwater, and you have to pay
178.515	twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.
182.38	So we know what it's done to our society
185.1	and all the extra work we have to do
187.431	to support our cars.
189.2	What happens when a city decides
190.932	it's going to set other priorities?
193.206	And probably the best example we have here
195.178	in America is Portland, Oregon.
197.589	Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s
200.928	that began to distinguish it
202.626	from almost every other American city.
205.162	While most other cities were growing
207.28	an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,
210.415	they instituted an urban growth boundary.
213.09	While most cities were reaming out their roads,
215.26	removing parallel parking and trees
217.505	in order to flow more traffic,
219.706	they instituted a skinny streets program.
223.439	And while most cities were investing in more roads
227.353	and more highways, they actually invested
230.262	in bicycling and in walking.
232.739	And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,
236.804	which seems like a lot of money,
238.237	but it was spent over about 30 years,
240.753	so two million dollars a year -- not that much --
243.122	and half the price of the one cloverleaf
245.447	that they decided to rebuild in that city.
248.266	These changes and others like them changed
250.235	the way that Portlanders live,
252.197	and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,
254.358	the amount that each person drives,
255.917	actually peaked in 1996,
258.23	has been dropping ever since,
260.331	and they now drive 20 percent less
262.395	than the rest of the country.
263.828	The typical Portland citizen drives
266.584	four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day
270.552	than they did before.
272.874	The economist Joe Cortright did the math
274.861	and he found out that those four miles
276.379	plus those 11 minutes
277.811	adds up to fully three and a half percent
279.733	of all income earned in the region.
282.263	So if they're not spending that money on driving --
284.139	and by the way, 85 percent of the money
285.752	we spend on driving leaves the local economy --
288.346	if they're not spending that money on driving,
290.221	what are they spending it on?
291.992	Well, Portland is reputed to have
293.669	the most roof racks per capita,
296.591	the most independent bookstores per capita,
299.431	the most strip clubs per capita.
302.675	These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations
305.311	of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders
306.95	spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds
310.148	than the rest of America.
312.174	Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol
314.489	than most other states,
315.829	which may be a good thing or a bad thing,
317.394	but it makes you glad they're driving less.
319.393	(Laughter)
321.766	But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,
325.102	and home investment is about as local
327.66	an investment as you can get.
329.783	But there's a whole other Portland story,
331.194	which isn't part of this calculus,
332.739	which is that young, educated people
335.626	have been moving to Portland in droves,
338.078	so that between the last two censuses,
340.596	they had a 50-percent increase
342.878	in college-educated millennials,
344.742	which is five times what you saw anywhere else
346.926	in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.
350.202	So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents
354.515	by being more walkable and more bikeable,
357.095	but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city
359.93	that people want to be in these days.
362.748	So the best economic strategy
364.141	you can have as a city
365.544	is not the old way of trying to attract corporations
369.258	and trying to have a biotech cluster
371.59	or a medical cluster,
373.684	or an aerospace cluster,
375.093	but to become a place where people want to be.
378.193	And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,
384.512	where they want to live,
385.791	then they move there, then they look for a job,
387.807	they will come to your city.
390.752	The health argument is a scary one,
393.613	and you've probably heard part of this argument before.
396.107	Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,
399.074	back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.
402.184	Now one out of three Americans is obese,
405.783	and a second third of the population is overweight.
409.65	Twenty-five percent of young men
411.529	and 40 percent of young women are too heavy
413.45	to enlist in our own military forces.
417.101	According to the Center for Disease Control,
419.479	fully one third of all children born after 2000
423.276	will get diabetes.
424.976	We have the first generation of children in America
426.949	who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.
430.819	I believe that this American healthcare crisis
433.03	that we've all heard about
434.468	is an urban design crisis,
437.084	and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.
439.896	Because we've talked a long time about diet,
442.461	and we know that diet impacts weight,
445.215	and weight of course impacts health.
447.527	But we've only started talking about inactivity,
450.298	and how inactivity born of our landscape,
453.49	inactivity that comes from the fact that we live
455.82	in a place where there is no longer any such thing
457.689	as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.
461.285	And we finally have the studies,
462.859	"one in Britain called ""Gluttony versus sloth"""
465.545	that tracked weight against diet
468.246	and tracked weight against inactivity,
470.151	and found a much higher, stronger correlation
472.854	between the latter two.
474.902	Dr. James Levine at, in this case,
476.919	the aptly-named Mayo Clinic
479.112	put his test subjects in electronic underwear,
483.651	held their diet steady,
485.644	and then started pumping the calories in.
487.648	Some people gained weight,
489.145	some people didn't gain weight.
490.522	Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,
493.988	they were shocked to learn that the only difference
495.692	between the subjects that they could figure out
497.574	was the amount they were moving,
499.458	and that in fact those who gained weight
501.098	were sitting, on average, two hours more per day
504.85	than those who didn't.
506.166	So we have these studies that tie
508.109	weight to inactivity, but even more,
510.423	we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.
512.938	Do you live in a more walkable city
514.571	or do you live in a less walkable city,
516.007	or where in your city do you live?
517.931	In San Diego, they used Walk Score --
520.596	Walk Score rates every address in America
522.953	and soon the world
524.592	in terms of how walkable it is --
526.981	they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods
529.864	and less walkable neighborhoods.
531.557	Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,
534.359	you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.
536.63	If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,
538.953	you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.
541.16	So we have study after study now
542.998	that's tying where you live
545.053	to your health, particularly as in America,
547.44	the biggest health crisis we have is this one
549.57	that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.
554.294	And I learned a new word last week.
556.017	"They call these neighborhoods ""obesageneric."""
559.647	I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.
562.878	Now that's one thing, of course.
564.645	Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic
567.12	in this country.
568.247	You probably haven't thought that much about it.
569.905	Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,
572.626	three times what it was in the '90s,
575.531	and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.
578.422	American pollution does not come
580.434	from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,
582.742	and the amount that people are driving in your city,
584.999	your urban VMT, is a good prediction
587.447	of the asthma problems in your city.
589.949	And then finally, in terms of driving,
592.164	there's the issue of the single-largest killer
595.07	of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers
597.712	of all people, is car crashes.
599.806	And we take car crashes for granted.
601.308	We figure it's a natural risk
603.143	of being on the road.
604.725	But in fact, here in America, 12 people
607.898	out of every 100,000
609.254	die every year from car crashes.
611.352	We're pretty safe here.
612.821	Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.
615.207	It's Japan, it's four per 100,000.
617.045	Do you know where it's three per 100,000?
619.614	New York City.
621.339	San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.
623.995	Oh, so cities make us safer
626.055	because we're driving less?
628.224	Tulsa: 14 per 100,000.
630.643	Orlando: 20 per 100,000.
633.884	It's not whether you're in the city or not,
635.601	it's how is your city designed?
637.287	Was it designed around cars or around people?
641.119	Because if your city is designed around cars,
642.889	it's really good at smashing them into each other.
647.748	That's part of a much larger health argument.
651.483	Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,
653.752	because the environmentalists turned on a dime
655.993	about 10 years ago.
657.512	The environmental movement in America
658.988	has historically been an anti-city movement
662.016	from Jefferson on.
663.527	"""Cities are pestilential to the health,"
665.882	to the liberties, to the morals of man.
667.873	If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,
669.983	as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt
671.899	as they are in Europe
673.314	"and take to eating one another as they do there."""
675.976	He apparently had a sense of humor.
678.707	And then the American environmental movement
680.76	has been a classically Arcadian movement.
682.87	To become more environmental, we move into the country,
684.983	we commune with nature, we build suburbs.
687.651	But, of course, we've seen what that does.
691.674	The carbon mapping of America,
693.88	where is the CO2 being emitted,
695.767	for many years only
697.696	hammered this argument in more strongly.
700.223	If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,
703.064	any carbon map of the U.S.,
704.579	it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,
707.722	hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,
710.178	dark, peaceful in the countryside.
713.746	Until some economists said, you know,
715.685	is that the right way to measure CO2?
718.131	There are only so many people in this country at any given time,
720.117	and we can choose to live where perhaps
722.204	we would have a lighter impact.
723.843	And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,
726.636	and when they did that, the maps just flipped,
729.24	coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,
732.259	and red hot in these exurban
734.935	"""drive till you qualify"" neighborhoods."
737.707	So a fundamental shift, and now you have
739.66	environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser
742.424	saying we are a destructive species.
744.991	If you love nature, the best thing you can do
747.157	is stay the heck away from it,
749.425	move to a city, and the denser the better,
751.979	and the denser cities like Manhattan
754.483	are the cities that perform the best.
756.819	So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline
760.968	at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,
765.284	consuming half of the electricity of Dallas.
768.758	But of course, we can do better.
770.76	Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.
773.872	European cities consume half as much again.
777.966	So obviously, we can do better,
780.162	and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.
783.531	My final argument in this topic is that
785.977	I think we're trying to be green the wrong way,
789.631	and I'm one of many people who believes that
791.807	this focus on gadgets,
794.879	on accessorizing --
797.57	What can I add to my house,
799.589	what can I add to what I've already got
801.701	to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --
804.164	has kind of dominated the discussion.
806.105	So I'm not immune to this.
807.959	My wife and I built a new house
809.494	on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,
812.493	and we did our best to clear the shelves
814.595	of the sustainability store.
816.65	We've got the solar photovoltaic system,
818.885	solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,
821.334	bamboo floors.
823.242	A log burning in my German high-tech stove
826.614	apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon
829.303	to the atmosphere than were it left alone
830.984	to decompose in the forest.
833.096	Yet all of these innovations --
835.876	That's what they said in the brochure.
837.763	(Laughter)
838.991	All of these innovations together
841.131	contribute a fraction of what we contribute
844.215	by living in a walkable neighborhood
846.12	three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.
849.891	We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,
852.09	and you should do the same thing,
853.44	but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers
855.82	saves as much energy in a year
857.452	as moving to a walkable city does in a week.
860.386	And we don't want to have this argument.
861.735	Politicians and marketers are afraid
863.943	"of marketing green as a ""lifestyle choice."""
867.676	You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,
870.593	that they have to change their lifestyle.
872.454	But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life
875.618	and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,
878.135	something that would be better than what we have right now?
881.466	Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,
883.977	it's called the Mercer Survey.
885.966	You may have heard of it.
887.166	They rank hundreds of nations worldwide
890.348	according to 10 criteria that they believe add up
892.761	to quality of life: health, economics, education,
897.86	housing, you name it.
901.162	There's six more. Short talk.
903.55	(Laughter)
905.339	And it's very interesting to see that
907.986	the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,
910.275	number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects
914.037	of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.
917.976	The driving cities in the Sun Belt,
919.698	the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,
922.867	these cities are not appearing on the list.
926.019	But who's doing even better?
927.837	The Canadian cities like Vancouver,
930.173	where again, they're burning half the fuel.
932.497	And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,
935.308	like Dusseldorf or Vienna,
937.24	where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.
939.67	And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.
942.525	Is being more sustainble
944.413	what gives you a higher quality of life?
946.841	I would argue the same thing
949.478	that makes you more sustainble
951.459	is what gives you a higher quality of life,
953.509	and that's living in a walkable neighborhood.
956.5	So sustainability, which includes our wealth
960.979	and our health
962.753	may not be a direct function of our sustainability.
967.205	But particularly here in America,
969.662	we are polluting so much
972.103	because we're throwing away our time
974.779	and our money and our lives on the highway,
977.353	then these two problems would seem to share
979.577	the same solution, which is to make our cities
982.211	more walkable.
983.554	Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done,
986.201	it has been done,
987.629	and it's being done now in more than a few cities,
990.193	around the globe and in our country.
992.729	I take some solace from Winston Churchill,
995.791	who put it this way:
997.161	"""The Americans can be counted on"
998.939	to do the right thing
1000.214	"once they have exhausted the alternatives."" (Laughter)"
1002.963	Thank you.
1004.959	(Applause)
