12.663	Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you
15.066	three multiple choice questions.
16.391	Use this device. Use this device to answer.
20.122	The first question is, how did the number
22.677	of deaths per year
24.798	from natural disaster,
26.09	how did that change during the last century?
28.691	Did it more than double,
30.07	did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,
32.852	or did it decrease to less than half?
35.226	Please answer A, B or C.
37.63	I see lots of answers. This is much
37.63	faster than I do it at universities.
41.73	They are so slow. They keep
41.73	thinking, thinking, thinking.
44.887	Oh, very, very good.
46.909	And we go to the next question.
48.772	So how long did women 30 years old
51.431	in the world go to school:
53.527	seven years, five years or three years?
55.561	A, B or C? Please answer.
62.064	And we go to the next question.
64.102	In the last 20 years, how did the percentage
68.023	of people in the world
69.85	who live in extreme poverty change?
72.067	Extreme poverty — not having 
72.067	enough food for the day.
74.628	Did it almost double,
76.689	did it remain more or less the same,
78.238	or did it halve?
79.751	A, B or C?
83.771	Now, answers.
86.927	You see,
88.021	deaths from natural disasters in the world,
89.746	you can see it from this graph here,
91.668	from 1900 to 2000.
94.448	In 1900, there was about half a million people
97.703	who died every year from natural disasters:
99.79	floods, earthquakes, volcanic 
99.79	eruption, whatever, droughts.
104.887	And then, how did that change?
107.607	Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.
111.093	This is how they answered.
112.952	The Swedish public answered like this:
114.881	Fifty percent thought it had doubled,
120.656	This is the best data from the disaster researchers,
123.308	and it goes up and down,
126.274	and it goes to the Second World War,
128.826	and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling
132.226	and it's down to much less than half.
134.072	The world has been much, much more capable
136.68	as the decades go by
138.294	to protect people from this, you know.
140.685	So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.
143.551	So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.
146.042	(Laughter) (Applause)
159.458	The chimps don't watch the evening news,
163.257	so the chimps,
164.715	they choose by random, so the
164.715	Swedes answer worse than random.
168.147	Now how did you do?
171.086	That's you.
174.048	You were beaten by the chimps.
176.273	(Laughter)
178.063	But it was close.
181.038	You were three times better than the Swedes,
185.059	but that's not enough.
186.302	You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.
188.884	You must have higher ambitions in the world.
192.415	Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.
195.823	Here, you can see men went eight years.
197.839	How long did women go to school?
199.62	Well, we asked the Swedes like this,
202.369	and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?
204.586	The right answer is probably the one
206.948	the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?
209.683	(Laughter)
211.186	Let's see, let's see. Here we come.
213.624	Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.
218.025	This is the U.S. public.
221.438	And this is you. Here you come.
225.313	Ooh.
229.325	Well, congratulations, you're
229.325	twice as good as the Swedes,
231.154	but you don't need me —
233.574	So how come? I think it's like this,
238.388	that everyone is aware that there are countries
241.11	and there are areas
242.214	where girls have great difficulties.
244.352	They are stopped when they go to school,
246.26	and it's disgusting.
248.325	But in the majority of the world,
250.222	where most people in the world live,
251.909	most countries, girls today go to school
254.891	as long as boys, more or less.
257.43	That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,
259.489	not at all.
261.573	They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,
266.114	but schooling is there in the world today.
268.346	Now, we miss the majority.
272.441	When you answer, you answer
272.441	according to the worst places,
275.764	and there you are right, but you miss the majority.
278.62	What about poverty?
280.096	Well, it's very clear that poverty here
282.999	was almost halved,
284.774	and in U.S., when we asked the public,
286.453	only five percent got it right.
290.437	And you?
293.306	Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.
297.164	(Laughter) (Applause)
299.525	That little, just a few of you!
305.142	There must be preconceived ideas, you know.
308.821	And many in the rich countries,
310.615	they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.
314.275	Of course they think so,
315.928	because they don't even know what has happened.
318.892	The first thing to think about the future
321.242	is to know about the present.
323.263	These questions were a few of the first ones
326.315	in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project
329.7	in Gapminder Foundation that we run,
332.72	and it was started, this project, last year
335.516	by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)
339.922	He's cofounder and director,
341.504	and he wanted, Ola told me
343.048	we have to be more systematic
345.608	when we fight devastating ignorance.
347.481	So already the pilots reveal this,
349.699	that so many in the public score worse than random,
352.909	so we have to think about preconceived ideas,
354.992	and one of the main preconceived ideas
357.02	is about world income distribution.
358.889	Look here. This is how it was in 1975.
362.72	It's the number of people on each income,
365.939	from one dollar a day —
368.83	(Applause)
371.281	See, there was one hump here,
373.356	around one dollar a day,
375.254	and then there was one hump here
376.71	somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.
378.725	The world was two groups.
380.471	It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,
384.081	the poor ones and the rich ones,
386.093	and there were fewer in between.
387.657	But look how this has changed:
389.826	As I go forward, what has changed,
391.652	the world population has grown,
393.308	and the humps start to merge.
396.076	The lower humps merged with the upper hump,
398.846	and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world
401.973	with one hump only.
404.228	The percent in poverty has decreased.
406.152	Still it's appalling
407.729	that so many remain in extreme poverty.
410.93	We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,
413.953	but that can be ended now.
417.002	The challenge we have now
419.305	is to get away from that,
419.305	understand where the majority is,
422.113	and that is very clearly shown in this question.
425.357	We asked, what is the percentage of the world's
427.59	one-year-old children who have got those
429.244	basic vaccines against measles and other things
431.854	that we have had for many years:
435.369	Now, this is what the U.S.
435.369	public and the Swedish answered.
439.442	Look at the Swedish result:
440.318	you know what the right answer is.
442.38	(Laughter)
446.053	Who the heck is a professor of
446.053	global health in that country?
449.556	Well, it's me. It's me.
451.228	(Laughter)
453.19	It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.
455.672	(Applause)
458.77	However, Ola's approach
462.484	to really measure what we know made headlines,
465.642	and CNN published these results on their web
468.705	and they had the questions there, millions answered,
470.852	and I think there were about 2,000 comments,
474.334	and this was one of the comments.
476.647	"""I bet no member of the media"
476.647	"passed the test,"" he said."
480.191	"So Ola told me, ""Take these devices."
482.83	You are invited to media conferences.
484.535	"Give it to them and measure what the media know."""
486.812	And ladies and gentlemen,
488.736	for the first time, the informal results
491.413	from a conference with U.S. media.
495.338	And then, lately, from the European Union media.
500.224	(Laughter)
501.492	You see, the problem is not that people
503.697	don't read and listen to the media.
505.645	The problem is that the
505.645	media doesn't know themselves.
509.864	What shall we do about this, Ola?
511.445	Do we have any ideas?
512.943	(Applause)
524.037	Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,
527.746	I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.
531.561	Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you
534.194	by showing why it was not your fault, actually.
538.753	Then, I will equip you with some tricks
540.775	for beating the chimps in the future.
542.865	That's basically what I will do.
545.079	But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,
547.282	and it all starts in this place.
549.889	It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.
553.579	It's a neighborhood where I grew up,
557.376	and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.
560.977	Actually, it has exactly the same problem
562.963	which existed in all the neighborhoods
565.572	where you grew up as well.
566.92	It was not representative. Okay?
569.582	It gave me a very biased view
572.025	of how life is on this planet.
574.373	So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.
577.365	We have a personal bias.
578.637	We have all different experiences
580.75	from communities and people we meet,
582.39	and on top of this, we start school,
585.377	and we add the next problem.
587.298	Well, I like schools,
588.442	but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,
593.529	because they learned something
593.529	when they went to school,
596.13	and now they describe this world to the students
598.683	without any bad intentions,
600.889	and those books, of course, that are printed
603.118	are outdated in a world that changes.
606.049	And there is really no practice
607.296	to keep the teaching material up to date.
610.545	So that's what we are focusing on.
612.529	So we have these outdated facts
614.098	added on top of our personal bias.
617.032	What happens next is news, okay?
619.508	An excellent journalist knows how to pick
622.025	the story that will make headlines,
624.431	and people will read it because it's sensational.
627.03	Unusual events are more interesting, no?
630.995	And they are exaggerated,
632.71	and especially things we're afraid of.
636.139	A shark attack on a Swedish person
638.567	will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.
642.282	So these three skewed sources of information
646.001	were really hard to get away from.
649.276	They kind of bombard us
650.907	and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,
654.713	and on top of it we put the very thing
657.45	that makes us humans, our human intuition.
662.716	It was good in evolution.
664.892	It helped us generalize
666.15	and jump to conclusions very, very fast.
668.408	It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,
672.376	and we seek causality where there is none,
675.66	and we then get an illusion of confidence
680.597	where we believe that we are the best car drivers,
683.603	above the average.
685.343	Everybody answered that question,
686.705	"""Yeah, I drive cars better."""
687.974	Okay, this was good evolutionarily,
690.271	but now when it comes to the worldview,
692.104	it is the exact reason why it's upside down.
694.966	The trends that are increasing are instead falling,
697.889	and the other way around,
699.471	and in this case, the chimps
699.471	use our intuition against us,
703.471	and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.
706.911	It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?
709.394	So how do we solve such problems?
711.766	First, we need to measure it,
713.441	and then we need to cure it.
714.843	So by measuring it we can understand
717.375	what is the pattern of ignorance.
719.699	We started the pilot last year,
721.235	and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter
723.704	a lot of ignorance across the whole world,
727.285	and the idea is really to
730.898	scale it up to all domains
732.875	or dimensions of global development,
735.423	such as climate, endangered species, human rights,
739.505	gender equality, energy, finance.
742.715	All different sectors have facts,
745.448	and there are organizations trying to spread
747.044	awareness about these facts.
748.97	So I've started actually contacting some of them,
752.674	like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,
756.015	and asking them, what are your favorite facts
758.613	which you think the public doesn't know?
760.506	Okay, I gather those facts.
762.084	Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.
765.619	And then we poll the public
766.918	and see where they score worst.
768.855	So we get a shorter list
770.201	with the terrible results,
771.257	like some few examples from Hans,
773.806	and we have no problem finding these kinds
775.723	of terrible results.
776.938	Okay, this little shortlist, what
776.938	are we going to do with it?
779.783	Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,
783.909	a global knowledge certificate,
785.771	which you can use, if you're a large organization,
788.674	a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,
792.429	to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.
796.057	Basically meaning, we don't hire people
799.02	who score like chimpanzees.
801.29	Of course you shouldn't.
803.65	So maybe 10 years from now,
805.921	if this project succeeds,
807.913	you will be sitting in an interview
810.161	having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.
814.367	So now we come to the practical tricks.
817.73	How are you going to succeed?
819.634	There is, of course, one way,
823.213	which is to sit down late nights
824.95	and learn all the facts by heart
827.105	by reading all these reports.
828.873	That will never happen, actually.
830.885	Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.
833.594	People don't have that time.
834.967	People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.
838.35	We need to turn our intuition into strength again.
841.124	We need to be able to generalize.
842.568	So now I'm going to show you some tricks
844.673	where the misconceptions are turned around
847.223	into rules of thumb.
850.431	Let's start with the first misconception.
852.445	This is very widespread.
854.082	Everything is getting worse.
855.948	You heard it. You thought it yourself.
859.218	The other way to think is, most things improve.
862.247	So you're sitting with a question in front of you
864.383	"and you're unsure. You should guess ""improve."""
867.616	Okay? Don't go for the worse.
870.6	That will help you score better on our tests.
872.963	(Applause)
874.179	That was the first one.
878.405	There are rich and poor
880.164	and the gap is increasing.
881.63	It's a terrible inequality.
883.285	Yeah, it's an unequal world,
885.486	but when you look at the data, it's one hump.
887.811	Okay? If you feel unsure,
889.665	"go for ""the most people are in the middle."""
892.418	That's going to help you get the answer right.
894.401	Now, the next preconceived idea is
898.108	first countries and people need to be very, very rich
901.733	to get the social development
904.059	like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.
907.51	No, no, no. That's wrong.
909.196	Look: that huge hump in the middle
911.316	already have girls in school.
913.759	So if you are unsure, go for the
916.087	"""the majority already have this,"""
917.482	like electricity and girls in
917.482	school, these kinds of things.
920.525	They're only rules of thumb,
922.741	so of course they don't apply to everything,
925.131	but this is how you can generalize.
926.788	Let's look at the last one.
928.753	If something, yes, this is a good one,
932.054	sharks are dangerous.
934.227	No — well, yes, but they are not so important
938.626	in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.
941.602	I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.
944.133	So as soon as I see a question
944.133	about things I'm afraid of,
946.977	which might be earthquakes, other religions,
949.91	maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,
952.948	anything that makes me feel,
954.107	assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.
956.608	That's a rule of thumb.
958.445	Of course there are dangerous 
958.445	things that are also great.
960.604	Sharks kill very, very few.
960.604	That's how you should think.
964.189	With these four rules of thumb,
967.927	you could probably answer better than the chimps,
971.287	because the chimps cannot do this.
973.241	They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.
975.844	And hopefully we can turn your world around
979.856	and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?
982.691	(Applause)
991.16	That's a systematic approach.
993.248	Now the question, is this important?
995.812	Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,
998.538	extreme poverty and how to fight it,
1001.785	and how to bring girls in school.
1003.83	When we realize that actually it's
1003.83	succeeding, we can understand it.
1008.17	But is it important for everyone else
1009.982	who cares about the rich end of this scale?
1012.436	I would say yes, extremely important,
1014.48	for the same reason.
1015.989	If you have a fact-based worldview of today,
1019.054	you might have a chance to understand
1020.672	what's coming next in the future.
1022.426	We're going back to these two humps in 1975.
1024.864	That's when I was born,
1026.214	and I selected the West.
1029.233	That's the current EU countries and North America.
1033.416	Let's now see how the rest and the West compares
1036.799	in terms of how rich you are.
1038.88	These are the people who can afford
1041.131	to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.
1044.709	In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived
1048.017	outside EU and North America.
1050.984	But this has changed, okay?
1053.313	So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.
1058.056	Today it's 50/50.
1059.444	The Western domination is over, as of today.
1063.125	That's nice. So what's going to happen next?
1065.324	Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?
1068.567	I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF,
1068.567	International Monetary Fund, website.
1074.598	They have a forecast for the next 
1074.598	five years of GDP per capita.
1078.761	So I can use that to go five years into the future,
1081.778	assuming the income inequality 
1081.778	of each country is the same.
1085.113	I did that, but I went even further.
1087.04	I used those five years for the next 20 years
1090.218	with the same speed, just as an
