25	I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,
28	from when I was 12 years old.
30	My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater --
33	at least I thought it was beautiful.
35	And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,
38	and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of
41	right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
43	And I wore it whenever I could,
44	thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
47	Until one day in ninth grade,
49	when I was standing with a number of the football players.
52	And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,
56	who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,
60	said in a booming voice that
61	we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,
65	but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
67	(Laughter)
68	And I was so humiliated and mortified
71	that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her
75	for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
76	We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away
79	somewhat ceremoniously,
81	my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater
84	nor see it ever again.
85	Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.
89	I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,
96	when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old --
100	running toward me, wearing my sweater.
103	And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
105	But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course
109	scaring the living bejesus out of him --
111	grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name
114	written on the collar of this sweater.
116	I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve
121	as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness
125	that we all have on this Earth.
127	We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction
131	does to people we think we will never see and never know.
135	I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story
138	of what aid is and can be.
140	That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,
144	and moved its way into the larger industry,
147	which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.
151	Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
155	And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,
157	it destroyed the local retailing industry.
159	Not to say that it shouldn't have,
161	but that we have to get better at answering the questions
164	that need to be considered when we think about consequences
167	and responses.
169	So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,
174	where I was doing two things.
175	I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
178	"We were called the ""Bad News Bears,"" and our notion was"
180	we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,
183	which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
187	And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,
190	and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
192	But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,
195	and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,
198	which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,
201	which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --
204	but then it was quite new, especially in an economy
207	that was moving from barter into trade.
210	We got a lot of things right.
212	We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
215	The women made their own decisions at the end of the day
218	as to how they would use this access to credit
220	to build their little businesses, earn more income
223	so they could take care of their families better.
226	What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,
230	with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife
237	and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into
242	this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,
248	that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
251	The genocide happened in 1994,
253	seven years after these women all worked together
255	to build this dream.
257	And the good news was that the institution,
259	the banking institution, lasted.
261	In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
265	The bakery was completely wiped out,
267	but the lessons for me were that accountability counts --
272	got to build things with people on the ground,
274	using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,
277	the incentives matter.
279	Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
283	So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything
287	that was happening in the world,
289	that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,
291	on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,
293	and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --
296	that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono
300	and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;
304	the world is talking about Africa
306	in ways I have never seen in my life.
308	It's thrilling.
309	And at the same time, what keeps me up at night
312	is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --
322	as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
326	And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,
330	celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two
334	that is all about execution, all about the how-to.
337	And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,
340	it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,
344	is to build viable systems on the ground
347	that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,
351	in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
354	If we do that, we really can make poverty history.
357	And it was that -- that whole philosophy --
360	that encouraged me to start my current endeavor
364	"called ""Acumen Fund,"""
366	which is trying to build some mini-blueprints
368	for how we might do that in water, health and housing
371	in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
374	And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,
379	so you can see what it is that we're doing.
381	But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --
384	I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
386	Because we too often talk about them as these
390	strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,
393	when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
398	On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
403	"That's who we talk about when we think about ""the poor."""
405	If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,
408	and yet most of these people go invisible.
411	Where we typically work, there's people making between
413	one and three dollars a day.
415	Who are these people?
417	They are farmers and factory workers.
420	They work in government offices. They're drivers.
422	They are domestics.
425	They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,
428	like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times
432	what their middleclass counterparts pay --
434	certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
438	The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,
442	if you give them that opportunity.
444	So, two examples.
446	One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,
449	most of whom make less than two dollars a day.
451	Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
455	You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
458	This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
462	What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,
465	and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,
468	which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
473	But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,
476	so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
481	A couple of principles:
483	build small.
485	Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
487	This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit
492	when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to
495	with a corrugated iron roof.
498	After one harvest, they had increased their income enough
502	to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
505	A couple of years later, I meet them.
507	They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,
510	and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid
515	to build their house.
516	And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
519	Something I truly believe.
521	You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,
524	and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
527	huge kudos for bringing to the world
530	this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.
534	Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
540	It's estimated that Africa loses
542	about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
544	Five dollars can save a life.
546	We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --
549	why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
553	"The question, though, is not ""Why can't we?"""
556	The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
561	A lot of hurdles.
562	One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
565	Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.
570	Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
573	We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan
577	to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa
579	so that they could transfer technology from Japan
584	and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
586	Here are just some pictures of the factory.
588	Today, three years later, the company has employed
591	another thousand women.
594	It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
599	It's the largest company in Tanzania.
601	The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,
604	three million by the end of the year.
606	We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
609	So the production side is working.
611	On the distribution side, though,
612	as a world, we have a lot of work to do.
614	Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,
618	and then given primarily to people around Africa.
622	We're looking at building
624	on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
627	Their women.
629	And so I want you to meet Jacqueline,
631	my namesake, 21 years old.
633	If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,
635	I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
637	She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money
641	to put a down payment on her house.
643	She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,
647	and told me she is not marrying nor having children
650	until these things are completed.
653	And so, when I told her about our idea --
655	that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,
658	and find a way for the women themselves to go out
661	and sell these nets to others --
663	she quickly started calculating what she herself could make
666	and signed up.
668	We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,
673	and quickly did a prototyping on this,
675	and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
678	She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts
682	together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,
684	despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,
687	and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
690	Not coming in with our own notions,
692	because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
694	First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
697	These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
700	Children can sleep through the night;
702	the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
704	And we've started making curtains,
706	and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --
710	that you care about your children.
711	Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
716	A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell
719	goods and services to the poor.
723	I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity
728	to make poverty history.
730	To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,
733	that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,
737	people all over the developing world
739	who fit in this category, to do it themselves.
742	Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
745	It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,
748	that they want to make their own decisions;
750	they want to solve their own problems;
752	and that by engaging with them,
754	not only do we create much more dignity for them,
757	but for us as well.
759	And so I urge all of you to think next time
762	as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity
766	that we all have -- to make poverty history --
769	by really becoming part of the process
771	and moving away from an us-and-them world,
773	and realizing that it's about all of us,
775	and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.
778	Thank you.
779	(Applause)
