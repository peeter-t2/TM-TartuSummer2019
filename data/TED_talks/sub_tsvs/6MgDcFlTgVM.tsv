12.746	Well, I'm an ocean chemist.
14.223	I look at the chemistry
14.223	of the ocean today.
16.366	I look at the chemistry
16.366	of the ocean in the past.
19.39	The way I look back in the past
21.478	is by using the fossilized remains
21.478	of deepwater corals.
24.653	You can see an image of one
24.653	of these corals behind me.
27.319	It was collected from close to Antarctica,
27.319	thousands of meters below the sea,
31.769	so, very different
31.769	than the kinds of corals
33.881	you may have been lucky enough to see
33.881	if you've had a tropical holiday.
37.692	So I'm hoping that this talk will give you
39.772	a four-dimensional view of the ocean.
41.589	Two dimensions, such as this
41.589	beautiful two-dimensional image
45.486	of the sea surface temperature.
47.104	This was taken using satellite,
47.104	so it's got tremendous spatial resolution.
51.898	The overall features are extremely
51.898	easy to understand.
54.788	The equatorial regions are warm
54.788	because there's more sunlight.
58.476	The polar regions are cold
58.476	because there's less sunlight.
61.186	And that allows big icecaps
61.186	to build up on Antarctica
64.131	and up in the Northern Hemisphere.
66.299	If you plunge deep into the sea,
66.299	or even put your toes in the sea,
69.741	you know it gets colder as you go down,
71.708	and that's mostly because the deep waters
71.708	that fill the abyss of the ocean
75.711	come from the cold polar regions
75.711	where the waters are dense.
79.845	If we travel back in time
82.975	the earth looked very much different.
84.859	And I've just given you a cartoon version
84.859	of one of the major differences
88.35	you would have seen
88.35	if you went back that long.
90.629	The icecaps were much bigger.
92.335	They covered lots of the continent,
92.335	and they extended out over the ocean.
95.986	Sea level was 120 meters lower.
98.503	Carbon dioxide [levels] were very
98.503	much lower than they are today.
102.071	So the earth was probably about three
102.071	to five degrees colder overall,
105.739	and much, much colder
105.739	in the polar regions.
109.908	What I'm trying to understand,
111.386	and what other colleagues of mine
111.386	are trying to understand,
114.212	is how we moved from that
114.212	cold climate condition
116.695	to the warm climate condition
116.695	that we enjoy today.
119.615	We know from ice core research
121.698	that the transition from these
121.698	cold conditions to warm conditions
124.802	wasn't smooth, as you might predict
124.802	from the slow increase in solar radiation.
130.153	And we know this from ice cores,
130.153	because if you drill down into ice,
133.408	you find annual bands of ice,
133.408	and you can see this in the iceberg.
136.703	You can see those blue-white layers.
138.718	Gases are trapped in the ice cores,
138.718	so we can measure CO2 --
142.368	that's why we know CO2
142.368	was lower in the past --
144.757	and the chemistry of the ice
144.757	also tells us about temperature
147.774	in the polar regions.
149.273	And if you move in time
149.273	from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,
152.976	you see that temperature increased.
154.809	It didn't increase smoothly.
156.458	Sometimes it increased very rapidly,
158.26	then there was a plateau,
159.528	then it increased rapidly.
160.817	It was different in the two polar regions,
162.865	and CO2 also increased in jumps.
166.808	So we're pretty sure the ocean
166.808	has a lot to do with this.
169.878	The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon,
172.268	about 60 times more
172.268	than is in the atmosphere.
174.846	It also acts to transport heat
174.846	across the equator,
178.072	and the ocean is full of nutrients
178.072	and it controls primary productivity.
182.142	So if we want to find out
182.142	what's going on down in the deep sea,
185.15	we really need to get down there,
186.767	see what's there
187.957	and start to explore.
189.385	This is some spectacular footage
189.385	coming from a seamount
192.416	about a kilometer deep
192.416	in international waters
194.629	in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land.
197.633	You're amongst the first people
197.633	to see this bit of the seafloor,
200.706	along with my research team.
203.34	You're probably seeing new species.
205.108	We don't know.
206.284	You'd have to collect the samples
206.284	and do some very intense taxonomy.
209.968	You can see beautiful bubblegum corals.
211.885	There are brittle stars
211.885	growing on these corals.
214.163	Those are things that look
214.163	like tentacles coming out of corals.
217.243	There are corals made of different forms
217.243	of calcium carbonate
220.139	growing off the basalt of this
220.139	massive undersea mountain,
223.539	and the dark sort of stuff,
223.539	those are fossilized corals,
226.927	and we're going to talk
226.927	a little more about those
229.262	as we travel back in time.
231.03	To do that, we need
231.03	to charter a research boat.
233.539	This is the James Cook,
233.539	an ocean-class research vessel
236.603	moored up in Tenerife.
237.897	Looks beautiful, right?
239.554	Great, if you're not a great mariner.
241.702	Sometimes it looks
241.702	a little more like this.
244.23	This is us trying to make sure
244.23	that we don't lose precious samples.
247.453	Everyone's scurrying around,
247.453	and I get terribly seasick,
250.294	so it's not always a lot of fun,
250.294	but overall it is.
253.312	So we've got to become
253.312	a really good mapper to do this.
255.922	You don't see that kind of spectacular
255.922	coral abundance everywhere.
259.685	It is global and it is deep,
262.749	but we need to really find
262.749	the right places.
265.087	We just saw a global map,
265.087	and overlaid was our cruise passage
268.277	from last year.
269.99	This was a seven-week cruise,
271.41	and this is us, having made our own maps
273.458	of about 75,000 square kilometers
273.458	of the seafloor in seven weeks,
277.553	but that's only a tiny fraction
277.553	of the seafloor.
280.099	We're traveling from west to east,
281.892	over part of the ocean that would
281.892	look featureless on a big-scale map,
285.416	but actually some of these mountains
285.416	are as big as Everest.
288.697	So with the maps that we make on board,
290.65	we get about 100-meter resolution,
292.666	enough to pick out areas
292.666	to deploy our equipment,
295.579	but not enough to see very much.
297.517	To do that, we need to fly
297.517	remotely-operated vehicles
300.263	about five meters off the seafloor.
302.501	And if we do that, we can get maps
302.501	that are one-meter resolution
305.74	down thousands of meters.
307.858	Here is a remotely-operated vehicle,
309.699	a research-grade vehicle.
312.034	You can see an array
312.034	of big lights on the top.
314.54	There are high-definition cameras,
314.54	manipulator arms,
317.619	and lots of little boxes and things
317.619	to put your samples.
321.087	Here we are on our first dive
321.087	of this particular cruise,
324.829	plunging down into the ocean.
326.559	We go pretty fast to make sure
326.559	the remotely operated vehicles
329.456	are not affected by any other ships.
331.203	And we go down,
332.425	and these are the kinds of things you see.
334.623	These are deep sea sponges, meter scale.
338.817	This is a swimming holothurian --
338.817	it's a small sea slug, basically.
343.089	This is slowed down.
344.3	Most of the footage I'm showing
344.3	you is speeded up,
346.713	because all of this takes a lot of time.
349.474	This is a beautiful holothurian as well.
352.897	And this animal you're going to see
352.897	coming up was a big surprise.
355.993	I've never seen anything like this
355.993	and it took us all a bit surprised.
359.429	This was after about 15 hours of work
359.429	and we were all a bit trigger-happy,
363.041	and suddenly this giant
363.041	sea monster started rolling past.
365.802	It's called a pyrosome
365.802	or colonial tunicate, if you like.
368.932	This wasn't what we were looking for.
370.743	We were looking for corals,
370.743	deep sea corals.
374.194	You're going to see a picture
374.194	of one in a moment.
376.516	It's small, about five centimeters high.
379.175	It's made of calcium carbonate,
379.175	so you can see its tentacles there,
382.517	moving in the ocean currents.
385.18	An organism like this probably lives
385.18	for about a hundred years.
388.315	And as it grows, it takes in
388.315	chemicals from the ocean.
391.879	And the chemicals,
391.879	or the amount of chemicals,
394.109	depends on the temperature;
394.109	it depends on the pH,
396.807	it depends on the nutrients.
398.377	And if we can understand how
398.377	these chemicals get into the skeleton,
401.635	we can then go back,
401.635	collect fossil specimens,
404.157	and reconstruct what the ocean
404.157	used to look like in the past.
407.325	And here you can see us collecting
407.325	that coral with a vacuum system,
410.785	and we put it into a sampling container.
413.41	We can do this very
413.41	carefully, I should add.
415.493	Some of these organisms live even longer.
417.902	This is a black coral called Leiopathes,
417.902	an image taken by my colleague,
421.328	Brendan Roark, about 500
421.328	meters below Hawaii.
424.614	Four thousand years is a long time.
426.962	If you take a branch from one
426.962	of these corals and polish it up,
430.121	this is about 100 microns across.
432.763	And Brendan took some analyses
432.763	across this coral --
435.278	you can see the marks --
437.108	and he's been able to show
437.108	that these are actual annual bands,
440.091	so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean,
442.028	corals can record seasonal changes,
444.82	which is pretty spectacular.
446.576	But 4,000 years is not enough to get
446.576	us back to our last glacial maximum.
450.398	So what do we do?
451.58	We go in for these fossil specimens.
454.18	This is what makes me really unpopular
454.18	with my research team.
457.135	So going along,
458.309	there's giant sharks everywhere,
459.951	there are pyrosomes,
459.951	there are swimming holothurians,
462.473	there's giant sponges,
463.768	but I make everyone go down
463.768	to these dead fossil areas
466.387	and spend ages kind of shoveling
466.387	around on the seafloor.
469.967	And we pick up all these corals,
469.967	bring them back, we sort them out.
473.356	But each one of these is a different age,
475.675	and if we can find out how old they are
477.6	and then we can measure
477.6	those chemical signals,
480.136	this helps us to find out
481.582	what's been going on
481.582	in the ocean in the past.
484.558	So on the left-hand image here,
486.286	I've taken a slice through a coral,
486.286	polished it very carefully
489.342	and taken an optical image.
491.336	On the right-hand side,
492.512	we've taken that same piece of coral,
492.512	put it in a nuclear reactor,
495.636	induced fission,
496.812	and every time there's some decay,
498.467	you can see that marked out in the coral,
500.473	so we can see the uranium distribution.
502.386	Why are we doing this?
503.561	Uranium is a very poorly regarded element,
505.872	but I love it.
507.055	The decay helps us find out
507.055	about the rates and dates
510.291	of what's going on in the ocean.
511.854	And if you remember from the beginning,
513.776	that's what we want to get at
513.776	when we're thinking about climate.
516.813	So we use a laser to analyze uranium
518.588	and one of its daughter products,
518.588	thorium, in these corals,
521.397	and that tells us exactly
521.397	how old the fossils are.
524.742	This beautiful animation
524.742	of the Southern Ocean
526.958	I'm just going to use illustrate
526.958	how we're using these corals
530.117	to get at some of the ancient
530.117	ocean feedbacks.
534.212	You can see the density
534.212	of the surface water
536.662	in this animation by Ryan Abernathey.
539.481	It's just one year of data,
541.542	but you can see how dynamic
541.542	the Southern Ocean is.
544.5	The intense mixing,
544.5	particularly the Drake Passage,
547.931	which is shown by the box,
550.392	is really one of the strongest
550.392	currents in the world
553.028	coming through here,
553.028	flowing from west to east.
555.259	It's very turbulently mixed,
556.632	because it's moving over those
556.632	great big undersea mountains,
559.528	and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange
559.528	with the atmosphere in and out.
564.033	And essentially, the oceans are breathing
564.033	through the Southern Ocean.
568.865	We've collected corals from back and forth
568.865	across this Antarctic passage,
574.353	and we've found quite a surprising thing
574.353	from my uranium dating:
577.404	the corals migrated from south to north
579.931	during this transition from the glacial
579.931	to the interglacial.
583.084	We don't really know why,
584.315	but we think it's something
584.315	to do with the food source
586.888	and maybe the oxygen in the water.
589.718	So here we are.
590.897	I'm going to illustrate what I think
590.897	we've found about climate
593.969	from those corals in the Southern Ocean.
595.953	We went up and down sea mountains.
595.953	We collected little fossil corals.
599.252	This is my illustration of that.
600.802	We think back in the glacial,
602.231	from the analysis
602.231	we've made in the corals,
604.278	that the deep part of the Southern Ocean
604.278	was very rich in carbon,
607.388	and there was a low-density
607.388	layer sitting on top.
610.101	That stops carbon dioxide
610.101	coming out of the ocean.
613.752	We then found corals
613.752	that are of an intermediate age,
616.368	and they show us that the ocean mixed
616.368	partway through that climate transition.
620.972	That allows carbon to come
620.972	out of the deep ocean.
624.154	And then if we analyze corals
624.154	closer to the modern day,
627.277	or indeed if we go down there today anyway
629.555	and measure the chemistry of the corals,
631.785	we see that we move to a position
631.785	where carbon can exchange in and out.
635.803	So this is the way
635.803	we can use fossil corals
637.901	to help us learn about the environment.
641.827	So I want to leave you
641.827	with this last slide.
643.985	It's just a still taken out of that first
643.985	piece of footage that I showed you.
647.932	This is a spectacular coral garden.
650.068	We didn't even expect
650.068	to find things this beautiful.
652.65	It's thousands of meters deep.
654.558	There are new species.
656.416	It's just a beautiful place.
658.339	There are fossils in amongst,
659.744	and now I've trained you
659.744	to appreciate the fossil corals
662.459	that are down there.
663.698	So next time you're lucky enough
663.698	to fly over the ocean
666.588	or sail over the ocean,
668.021	just think -- there are massive
668.021	sea mountains down there
670.712	that nobody's ever seen before,
672.603	and there are beautiful corals.
674.244	Thank you.
675.419	(Applause)
