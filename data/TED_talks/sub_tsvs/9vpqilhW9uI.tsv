12.791	We are going to take a quick voyage
15.19	over the cognitive history of the 20th century,
18.697	because during that century,
20.486	our minds have altered dramatically.
23.4	As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900
26.724	have altered because the roads are better
28.798	and because of technology.
31.153	And our minds have altered, too.
33.122	We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world
37.066	and analyzed that world primarily in terms
40.465	of how much it would benefit them
42.698	to people who confront a very complex world,
47.29	and it's a world where we've had to develop
49.499	new mental habits, new habits of mind.
52.994	And these include things like
54.991	clothing that concrete world with classification,
59.005	introducing abstractions that we try to make
61.927	logically consistent,
64.123	and also taking the hypothetical seriously,
66.953	that is, wondering about what might have been
69.203	rather than what is.
71.595	Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention
75.147	through massive I.Q. gains over time,
78.907	and these have been truly massive.
81.276	That is, we don't just get a few more questions right
85.687	on I.Q. tests.
87.16	We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests
90.619	than each succeeding generation
92.867	back to the time that they were invented.
95.777	Indeed, if you score the people a century ago
99.075	against modern norms,
100.623	they would have an average I.Q. of 70.
103.994	If you score us against their norms,
106.719	we would have an average I.Q. of 130.
110.318	Now this has raised all sorts of questions.
113.675	Were our immediate ancestors
115.58	on the verge of mental retardation?
118.815	Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.
122.89	Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?
125.922	Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.
130.158	Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative
133.278	that's much more illuminating than either of those,
137.331	and to put this into perspective,
139.953	let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth
142.858	and found a ruined civilization.
145.693	And this Martian was an archaeologist,
148.1	and they found scores, target scores,
150.987	that people had used for shooting.
153.91	And first they looked at 1865,
156.413	and they found that in a minute,
158.484	people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.
162.193	And then they found, in 1898,
164.51	that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.
168.294	And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.
173.521	And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.
177.376	They would say, look, these tests were designed
179.973	to find out how much people were steady of hand,
183.571	how keen their eyesight was,
186.346	whether they had control of their weapon.
188.684	How could these performances have escalated
191.705	to this enormous degree?
193.887	Well we now know, of course, the answer.
196.162	If that Martian looked at battlefields,
198.974	they would find that people had only muskets
201.798	at the time of the Civil War
203.862	and that they had repeating rifles
205.669	at the time of the Spanish-American War,
208.854	and then they had machine guns
210.59	by the time of World War I.
213.405	And, in other words, it was the equipment
215.956	that was in the hands of the average soldier
218.123	that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye
221.186	or steadiness of hand.
223.359	Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery
226.679	that we have picked up over those hundred years,
230.172	and I think again that another thinker will help us here,
234.235	and that's Luria.
236.37	Luria looked at people
238.514	just before they entered the scientific age,
242.167	and he found that these people
244.164	were resistant to classifying the concrete world.
247.821	They wanted to break it up
248.875	into little bits that they could use.
251.465	He found that they were resistant
253.755	to deducing the hypothetical,
257.256	to speculating about what might be,
259.933	and he found finally that they didn't deal well
262.57	with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.
266.967	Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.
270.107	He talked to the head man of a person
272.473	in rural Russia.
274.305	They'd only had, as people had in 1900,
276.779	about four years of schooling.
278.96	And he asked that particular person,
281.32	what do crows and fish have in common?
284.79	"And the fellow said, ""Absolutely nothing."
287.857	You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.
290.85	A crow can peck at a fish.
293.176	"A fish can't do anything to a crow."""
296.027	"And Luria said, ""But aren't they both animals?"""
299.253	"And he said, ""Of course not."
300.663	One's a fish.
302.65	"The other is a bird."""
304.422	And he was interested, effectively,
306.444	in what he could do with those concrete objects.
310.112	And then Luria went to another person,
312.99	and he said to them,
315.173	"""There are no camels in Germany."
317.869	Hamburg is a city in Germany.
320.28	"Are there camels in Hamburg?"""
322.823	And the fellow said,
323.714	"""Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."""
327.933	"And Luria said, ""But what do my words imply?"""
331.827	"And he said, ""Well, maybe it's a small village,"
334.104	"and there's no room for camels."""
336.673	In other words, he was unwilling to treat this
338.936	as anything but a concrete problem,
341.733	and he was used to camels being in villages,
344.291	and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,
348.224	to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.
353.131	A third interview was conducted
355.944	with someone about the North Pole.
358.928	"And Luria said, ""At the North Pole, there is always snow."
363.033	Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.
366.988	"What color are the bears at the North Pole?"""
370.267	"And the response was, ""Such a thing"
372.669	is to be settled by testimony.
374.979	If a wise person came from the North Pole
377.803	and told me the bears were white,
379.654	I might believe him,
381.133	"but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."""
385.338	Now you see again, this person has rejected
388.322	going beyond the concrete world
390.517	and analyzing it through everyday experience,
393.69	and it was important to that person
395.556	what color bears were --
397.118	that is, they had to hunt bears.
399.399	They weren't willing to engage in this.
401.808	One of them said to Luria,
403.645	"""How can we solve things that aren't real problems?"
407.145	None of these problems are real.
409.036	"How can we address them?"""
411.679	Now, these three categories --
415.224	classification,
416.715	using logic on abstractions,
418.856	taking the hypothetical seriously --
421.625	how much difference do they make in the real world
424.063	beyond the testing room?
425.956	And let me give you a few illustrations.
428.926	First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.
432.315	That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education
435.712	to 12 years of formal education,
438.489	and 52 percent of Americans
440.39	have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.
444.21	Now, not only do we have much more education,
448.242	and much of that education is scientific,
450.935	and you can't do science without classifying the world.
454.945	You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.
458.804	You can't do science without making it logically consistent.
462.978	And even down in grade school, things have changed.
466.788	In 1910, they looked at the examinations
469.722	that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,
473.542	and they found that they were all
475.148	for socially valued concrete information.
478.583	They were things like,
479.914	what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states
482.801	that existed at that time?
485.175	When they looked at the exams
486.753	that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,
489.9	they were all about abstractions.
492.286	They were things like,
493.879	why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
499.013	And you were supposed to think, well,
500.577	the state legislature was rural-controlled,
503.791	and they hated the big city,
505.889	so rather than putting the capital in a big city,
508.482	they put it in a county seat.
509.92	They put it in Albany rather than New York.
512.656	They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.
515.712	And so forth.
517.647	So the tenor of education has changed.
520.078	We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,
524.112	to use abstractions, and to link them logically.
527.69	What about employment?
530.071	Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans
533.971	practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.
537.513	Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.
541.568	Today, 35 percent of Americans
544.431	practice cognitively demanding professions,
547.75	not only to the professions proper like lawyer
550.376	or doctor or scientist or lecturer,
552.925	but many, many sub-professions
554.743	having to do with being a technician,
556.684	a computer programmer.
558.709	A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.
563.033	And we can only meet the terms of employment
565.963	in the modern world by being cognitively
568.46	far more flexible.
570.721	And it's not just that we have many more people
573.944	in cognitively demanding professions.
576.934	The professions have been upgraded.
579.337	Compare the doctor in 1900,
581.448	who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,
584.497	with the modern general practitioner or specialist,
587.305	with years of scientific training.
589.984	Compare the banker in 1900,
592.253	who really just needed a good accountant
594.666	and to know who was trustworthy in the local community
597.842	for paying back their mortgage.
600.133	Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees
603.362	may have been morally remiss,
605.128	but they were cognitively very agile.
608.267	They went far beyond that 1900 banker.
612.878	They had to look at computer projections
615.045	for the housing market.
617.045	They had to get complicated CDO-squared
620.95	in order to bundle debt together
623.4	and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.
627.159	They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies
630.259	to give it a AAA,
631.37	though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.
635.604	And they also, of course, had to get people
637.633	to accept these so-called assets
640.32	and pay money for them
641.82	even though they were highly vulnerable.
644.407	Or take a farmer today.
645.997	I take the farm manager of today as very different
649.277	from the farmer of 1900.
651.768	So it hasn't just been the spread
653.606	of cognitively demanding professions.
656.797	It's also been the upgrading of tasks
659.177	like lawyer and doctor and what have you
661.744	that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.
665.521	But I've talked about education and employment.
668.68	Some of the habits of mind that we have developed
672.019	over the 20th century
673.626	have paid off in unexpected areas.
676.221	I'm primarily a moral philosopher.
678.492	I merely have a holiday in psychology,
682.18	and what interests me in general is moral debate.
686.588	Now over the last century,
689.319	in developed nations like America,
691.669	moral debate has escalated
693.65	because we take the hypothetical seriously,
696.989	and we also take universals seriously
700.204	and look for logical connections.
703	When I came home in 1955 from university
706.735	at the time of Martin Luther King,
709.042	a lot of people came home at that time
711.364	and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.
715.114	My father was born in 1885,
718.342	and he was mildly racially biased.
720.905	As an Irishman, he hated the English so much
723.008	he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.
725.329	(Laughter)
728.6	But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.
733.108	And when we said to our parents and grandparents,
735.956	"""How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"""
740.449	they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.
744.07	Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --
746.572	(Laughter) --
748.974	that turned black?
750.204	In other words, they were fixed in the concrete
753.72	mores and attitudes they had inherited.
757.233	They would not take the hypothetical seriously,
760.244	and without the hypothetical,
761.728	it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.
765.747	You have to say, imagine you were
768.382	in Iran, and imagine that your relatives
773.967	all suffered from collateral damage
776.667	even though they had done no wrong.
778.613	How would you feel about that?
780.674	And if someone of the older generation says,
783.394	well, our government takes care of us,
785.324	and it's up to their government to take care of them,
788.267	they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.
792.335	Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,
795.702	and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.
798.912	Well, he's treating his mores
801.272	as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,
805.172	and they're unmovable in any way by logic.
807.817	They're just inherited mores.
810.393	Today we would say something like,
812.594	well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.
816.171	Would you deserve to be killed?
817.844	And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.
820.739	That's not one of the principles I've got.
824.761	Well you, today, universalize your principles.
827.602	You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.
831.159	If you have a principle such as,
833.432	people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,
837.078	then to exclude black people
839.174	you've got to make exceptions, don't you?
841.672	You have to say, well, blackness of skin,
844.66	you couldn't suffer just for that.
847.283	It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.
850.546	And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,
853.713	and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted
856.629	when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.
860.423	And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,
863.848	because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.
868.402	You're treating them as universals,
870.339	to be rendered consistent by logic.
873.118	Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?
876.248	That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.
880.258	If you look at the I.Q. test,
882.143	you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.
886.128	The similarities subtest of the Wechsler
888.731	is about classification,
891	and we have made enormous gains
893.08	on that classification subtest.
896.19	There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery
899.471	that are about using logic on abstractions.
902.567	Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,
906.041	and it's all about analogies.
908.579	And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.
912.435	That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.
916.78	What are dogs like?
918.356	They would say wolves.
920.448	But by 1960, people could attack Raven's
923.992	on a much more sophisticated level.
926.642	If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,
931.149	what follows two circles?
933.385	They could say a semicircle.
935.672	Just as a triangle is half of a square,
937.85	a semicircle is half of a circle.
940.568	By 2010, college graduates, if you said
944.161	two circles followed by a semicircle,
947.396	two sixteens followed by what,
950.186	they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.
953.922	That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world
956.788	that they could even ignore
959.081	the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.
963.604	Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.
966.768	We haven't made progress on all fronts.
969.64	One of the ways in which we would like to deal
972.404	with the sophistication of the modern world
974.602	is through politics,
976.638	and sadly you can have humane moral principles,
979.973	you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,
984.393	and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,
987.323	you can't do politics.
989.75	We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,
992.77	that they read less history and less literature
995.645	and less material about foreign lands,
998.255	and they're essentially ahistorical.
999.95	They live in the bubble of the present.
1002.067	They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.
1004.923	They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.
1009.106	Think how different America would be
1011.727	if every American knew that this is the fifth time
1015.323	Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,
1019.417	and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened
1022.781	on those four previous occasions.
1025.106	(Laughter)
1026.056	And that is, they had barely left,
1028.004	and there wasn't a trace in the sand.
1030.336	Or imagine how different things would be
1033.544	if most Americans knew that we had been lied
1036.3	into four of our last six wars.
1039.225	You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,
1042.159	the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel
1044.417	but was loaded with munitions,
1047.05	the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,
1051.128	and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda
1054.696	and had nothing to do with it,
1056.605	and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people
1060.408	that they were brothers in arms,
1061.952	when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.
1065.831	But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.
1069.3	The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves
1073.818	in ordinary people that we have now realized,
1077.471	and the aristocracy was convinced
1079.535	that the average person couldn't make it,
1081.714	that they could never share their mindset
1084.68	or their cognitive abilities.
1087.286	Lord Curzon once said
1089	he saw people bathing in the North Sea,
1091.264	"and he said, ""Why did no one tell me"
1092.927	"what white bodies the lower orders have?"""
1095.903	As if they were a reptile.
1098.254	Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]
1101.304	"[Kipling] said, ""The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady"
1105.014	"are sisters underneath the skin."""
1108.223	(Applause)
