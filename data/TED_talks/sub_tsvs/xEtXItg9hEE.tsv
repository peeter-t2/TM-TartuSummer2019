16.025	So let me start by taking you back,
19.627	back into the mists of your memory
21.863	to perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,
25.376	but certainly the most anticipated year
28.012	in all human history:
29.99	the year 2000. Remember that?
32.928	Y2K, the dotcom bubble,
36.481	stressing about whose party you're going to go to
38.878	as the clock strikes midnight,
41.1	before the champagne goes flat,
43.142	and then there's that inchoate yearning
46.461	that was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,
49.7	that the year 2000, should mean more,
52.216	more than just a two and some zeroes.
55.435	Well, amazingly, for once, our world leaders
59.193	actually lived up to that millennium moment
61.815	and back in 2000 agreed to some
63.964	pretty extraordinary stuff:
66.371	visionary, measurable, long-term targets
69.817	called the Millennium Development Goals.
72.55	Now, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals
74.795	under your pillow, or by the bedside table,
77.577	but just in case you don't,
79.663	and your memory needs some jogging,
81.493	the deal agreed then goes like this:
84.115	developing countries promised to at least halve
86.69	extreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,
90.088	alongside some other targets, by 2015,
92.868	and developed nations promised to help them
95.723	get that done by dropping debts,
98.121	increasing smart aid, and trade reform.
100.842	Well, we're approaching 2015,
103.091	so we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?
105.89	But we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?
109.652	Some people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide
112.891	what we want to do on these goals going forward.
116.124	What does the world want to do together?
118.303	We've got to decide a process by which we decide.
120.826	Well, I definitely think these goals are worth building on
123.724	and seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
127.525	Incredible partnerships between the private sector,
130.642	political leaders, philanthropists
132.846	and amazing grassroots activists
134.875	across the developing world,
136.604	but also 250,000 people marched in the streets
141.138	of Edinburgh outside this very building
143.574	for Make Poverty History.
144.918	All together, they achieved these results:
147.609	increased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,
150.701	life-saving anti-AIDS drugs;
152.874	nearly halved deaths from malaria;
155.562	vaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.
160.324	And combined, this is going to result
162.627	in two million fewer children dying every year,
165.71	last year, than in the year 2000.
167.755	That's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,
170.69	ten times you lot not dead every day,
174.234	because of all of these partnerships.
176.216	So I think this is amazing living proof of progress
179.319	that more people should know about,
181.276	but the challenge of communicating this kind of good news
183.683	is probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.
186.723	Anyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,
189.241	thank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
192.452	But there's still a lot of unfinished business.
195.069	Still, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,
199.671	treatable diseases,
201.742	and 178 million kids are malnourished
204.475	to the point of stunting, a horrible term
205.905	which means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.
209.683	So there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.
212.171	But then, a lot of people think there are things
215.219	that should have been in the original package
217.132	that weren't agreed back then that should now be included,
219.404	like sustainable development targets,
221.934	natural resource governance targets,
224.196	access to opportunity, to knowledge,
226.391	equity, fighting corruption.
228.381	All of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.
231.037	But the key thing here is,
233.005	what do you think should be in the new goals?
235.12	What do you want?
237.032	Are you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality
239.476	or education?
241.353	Should those be in the new package of goals?
243.739	And quite frankly, that's a good question,
245.753	but there's going to be some tough tradeoffs
247.699	and choices here, so you want to hope
249.655	that the process by which the world decides
251.592	these new goals is going to be legitimate, right?
254.831	Well, as we gather here in Edinburgh,
256.857	technocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,
259.839	with the best intentions, are busying themselves
262.302	designing a new package of goals,
264.701	and currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old
268.021	late-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.
271.754	But, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,
275.556	along with ubiquitous reality TV formats
278.298	have spread all around the world.
280.415	So what we'd like to propose is that we use them
283.199	to involve people from all around the world
286.221	in an historic first: the world's first truly global
289.99	poll and consultation, where everyone everywhere
293.58	has an equal voice for the very first time.
296.928	I mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity
300.463	not to do this, given that we can?
303.111	There's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,
308.01	tens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,
311.956	and, I'd argue, the security and future
314.303	of you and your family is also at stake.
316.766	So, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps
320.355	in this crowdsourcing campaign:
322.71	collecting, connecting and committing.
325.587	So first of all, we've got to ground this campaign
327.759	in core polling data.
329.883	Let's go into every country that will let us in,
331.997	ask 1,001 people what they want
334.585	the new goals to be, making special efforts
336.645	to reach the poorest, those without access
338.884	to modern technology, and let's make sure that their views
341.933	are at the center of the goals going forward.
344.217	Then, we've got to commission a baseline survey
348.312	to make sure we can monitor and progress the goals
350.552	going forward. The original goals didn't really have
352.578	good baseline survey data,
354.452	and we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure
358.844	we can really monitor the progress.
360.916	And then we've got to connect with the big crowd.
363.621	Now here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition
366.738	of social media giants and upstarts,
369.708	telecoms companies, reality TV show formats,
373.657	gaming companies, telecoms, all of them together
377.155	"in kind of their ""We Are The World"" moment."
380.596	Could they come together and help
382.903	the Millennium Development Goals get rebranded
385.684	into the Millennial Generation's Goals?
388.708	And if just five percent of the five billion plus
391.521	who are currently connected made a comment,
394.768	and that comment turned into a commitment,
397.09	we could crowdsource a force of 300 million people
400.226	around the world to help see these goals through.
403.644	If we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,
407.146	based upon our experience of campaigning
408.875	and getting world leaders to commit,
410.516	I think world leaders will commit
411.957	to most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
414.364	But the question really is, through this process
416.987	will we all have become committed?
419.675	And if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor
422.576	and provide feedback, make sure these promises
424.84	are really delivering results?
426.823	Well, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,
430.024	mostly piloted within Africa, actually.
432.736	There's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes
434.975	and crowdsources information about where projects are,
437.427	are they delivering results.
439.014	Often, they're not in the right place.
440.79	"And Ushahidi, which means ""witness"" in Swahili,"
444.244	which geocodes and crowdsources information
446.642	in complex emergencies to help target responses.
450.555	This is some of the most exciting stuff
453.964	in development and democracy,
455.823	where citizens on the edge of a network
457.922	are helping to force open the process
459.863	to make sure that the big global aid promises
462.574	and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people
466.028	at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.
470.184	This openness, this forcing openness, is key,
473.696	and if it wasn't entirely transparent already,
476.632	I should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.
481.276	Long-term trends suggest that this century
483.683	is going to be a tough place to live,
485.939	with population increases, consumption patterns increasing,
489.836	and conflict over scarce natural resources.
493.27	And look at the state of global politics today.
496.914	Look at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,
500.015	or the Mexican G20, also last week.
502.369	Both, if we're honest, a bust.
505.28	Our world leaders, our global politics,
507.443	currently can't get it done.
510.132	They need our help. They need the cavalry,
513.505	and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
515.738	It's got to come from us, and I see this process
518.973	of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion
521.924	what the world wants to work on together
524.318	as one vital means by which we can crowdsource
527.685	the force to really build that constituency
531.013	that's going to reinvigorate global governance
533.444	in the 21st century.
535.435	I started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.
540.564	Many people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago
544.063	we had called Make Poverty History.
546.206	It was a naive thought in many people's minds,
549.496	and it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan
552.265	that worked for the moment. But look.
555.495	The empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25
559.64	is trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.
562.784	It's getting near zero.
565.111	Now sure, progress in China and India
567.351	and poverty reduction there was key to that,
569.573	but recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
572.706	It will get harder as we get towards zero,
575.54	as the poor will be increasingly located
577.678	in post-conflict, fragile states,
579.968	or maybe in middle income states
581.944	where they don't really care about the marginalized.
584.598	But I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning
588.545	and creative and technological innovation combined
591.707	working together more and more as one,
594.126	I think we can get this and other goals done.
597.749	Thank you. (Applause)
600.435	(Applause)
605.76	Chris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.
607.92	If there was an incident today where a hundred kids
611.696	died in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids
615.221	were kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,
618.112	I mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
621.366	You just put up, just as one of your numbers there,
623.986	that 5,000 -- is that the number?
627.068	Jamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.
629.06	CA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.
630.731	I mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything
634.044	that is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
637.396	This must drive you crazy.
639.23	JD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country
642.069	about aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not
644.584	the whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.
646.902	But, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,
651.456	I mean, they'd be going crazy for it.
653.925	I wish the 250,000 people who really did march
657.556	outside this very building knew these results.
660.81	Right now they don't, and it would be great to find a way
663.689	to better communicate it, because we have not.
665.941	Creatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.
669.223	If those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice
672.431	and amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact
674.94	we'd get better policy.
676.941	The Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.
679.462	Rio, if anyone cares about the environment,
682.003	need not have been a bust, okay?
684.345	But these conferences are going on,
686.215	and I know people get skeptical and cynical
687.912	about the big global summits and the promises
689.688	and their never being kept, but actually,
691.435	the bits that are, are making a difference,
693.818	and what the politicians need
695.267	is more permission from the public.
697.508	CA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.
699.597	by which this might happen.
701.557	I mean, if the people here who've had experience
703.444	using open platforms, you're interested to talk with them
706.604	this week and try to take this forward.
708.23	JD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,
710.2	if this conference led in some way
712.812	to advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,
715.821	and if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,
718.178	so thank you. JD: I'd love your help.
719.619	CA: Thank you, thank you.
721.567	(Applause)
