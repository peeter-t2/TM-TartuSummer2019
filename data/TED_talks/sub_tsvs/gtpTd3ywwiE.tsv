13.067	I made a film that was impossible to make,
15.952	but I didn't know it was impossible,
19.603	and that's how I was able to do it.
22.395	"""Mars et Avril"" is a science fiction film."
24.855	It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.
29.053	No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before
31.255	because it's expensive, it's set in the future,
34.937	and it's got tons of visual effects,
36.597	and it's shot on green screen.
39.028	Yet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make
41.179	ever since I was a kid, really,
43.164	back when I was reading some comic books
45.273	and dreaming about what the future might be.
48.869	When American producers see my film,
51.505	they think that I had a big budget to do it,
54.789	like 23 million.
57.908	But in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.
60.894	"I did ""Mars et Avril"" for only 2.3 million."
63.443	So you might wonder, what's the deal here?
64.539	How did I do this?
67.092	Well, it's two things. First, it's time.
70.329	When you don't have money, you must take time,
73.11	"and it took me seven years to do ""Mars et Avril."""
77.002	The second aspect is love.
80.332	I got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.
83.87	And it seems like every department had nothing,
86.04	so they had to rely on our creativity
89.068	and turn every problem into an opportunity.
91.642	And that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,
93.668	how constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.
97.808	But let me go back in time a bit.
101.216	In my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,
104.373	but they weren't your usual graphic novels.
106.407	They were books telling a science fiction story
108.9	through images and text,
111.605	and most of the actors who are now starring
115.188	in the movie adaptation, they were already involved
117.246	in these books portraying characters
120.84	into a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.
126.387	And one of these actors is the great stage director
130.09	and actor Robert Lepage.
131.534	And I just love this guy.
133.055	I've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.
136.5	His career I admire a lot.
139.303	And I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,
142.236	and he was kind enough to lend his image
146.396	to the character of Eugène Spaak,
148.059	who is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation
152.681	in between time, space, love, music and women.
158.151	And he was a perfect fit for the part,
161.706	and Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.
164.89	He was the one who believed in me
167.226	and encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books
170.803	into a film, and to write, direct,
173.758	and produce the film myself.
175.81	And Robert is actually the very first example
179.62	of how constraints can boost creativity.
183.504	Because this guy is the busiest man on the planet.
186.171	I mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,
189.294	and he's really hard to get,
193.134	and I wanted him to be in the movie,
196.017	to reprise his role in the movie.
197.922	But the thing is, had I waited
200.918	for him until 2042, my film wouldn't be
203.47	a futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?
207.266	But that's kind of a big problem.
208.95	How do you get somebody who is too busy
212.243	to star in a movie?
214.369	Well, I said as a joke in a production meeting --
218.271	and this is a true story, by the way —
220.016	"I said, ""Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?"
222.928	Because, you know, he is everywhere
225.091	and nowhere on the planet at the same time,
226.957	and he's an illuminated being in my mind,
229.528	and he's in between reality and virtual reality,
233.782	so it would make perfect sense
235.756	"to turn this guy into a hologram."""
238.006	Everybody around the table laughed,
240.326	but the joke was kind of a good solution,
242.862	so that's what we ended up doing.
245.318	Here's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.
249.021	He was dressed in green and he was like
251.463	in a green aquarium.
253.207	Each camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,
255.985	so that in post-production we could use
258.598	pretty much any angle we needed,
260.49	and we shot only his head.
262.902	Six months later there was a guy on set,
265.408	a mime portraying the body,
267.238	the vehicle for the head.
269.678	And he was wearing a green hood
272.929	so that we could erase the green hood in postproduction
276.111	and replace it with Robert Lepage's head.
278.398	So he became like a renaissance man,
280.406	and here's what it looks like in the movie.
282.456	(Music)
294.776	(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing
296.944	didn't account for the technical challenges.
299.138	I welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.
303.081	I tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,
307.364	but I might have hit a heartstring.
311.296	It still sounds too low.]
313.678	Jacques Languirand: [That's normal.
314.609	The instrument always ends up resembling its model.]
317.771	(Music)
338.266	Martin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments
341.684	that you see in this excerpt,
343.828	they're my second example of how
346.335	constraints can boost creativity,
348.727	because I desperately needed these objects in my movie.
351.947	They are objects of desire.
353.648	They are imaginary musical instruments.
356.043	And they carry a nice story with them.
358.123	Actually, I knew what these things would look like
362.777	in my mind for many, many years.
364.607	But my problem was, I didn't have the money
368.82	to pay for them. I couldn't afford them.
371.601	So that's kind of a big problem too.
374.032	How do you get something that you can't afford?
377.633	And, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.
381.593	"I said, ""What if I have somebody else pay for them?"""
385.756	(Laughter)
388.617	But who on Earth would be interested
392.345	by seven not-yet-built musical instruments
395.561	inspired by women's bodies?
397.261	And I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,
400.175	because who better to understand the kind of
403.533	crazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?
406.212	So I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,
409.386	and I presented my crazy idea to him
412.154	with sketches like this and visual references,
415.388	and something pretty amazing happened.
418.115	Guy was interested by this idea
420.466	not because I was asking for his money,
423.771	but because I came to him with a good idea
427.197	in which everybody was happy.
428.919	It was kind of a perfect triangle
431.028	in which the art buyer was happy
434.515	because he got the instruments at a cheaper price,
437.455	because they weren't even made.
439.328	He took a leap of faith.
440.937	And the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,
444.794	he was happy too because he had a dream project
447.623	to work on for a year.
449.104	And obviously I was happy because I got the instruments
452.918	in my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.
457.726	So here they are.
459.444	And my last example of how constraints
462.918	can boost creativity
464.427	comes from the green,
468.037	because this is a weird color, a crazy color,
471.88	and you need to replace the green screens eventually
474.942	and you must figure that out sooner rather than later.
477.763	And I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind
481.936	as to what the world would be,
483.952	but then again I turned to my childhood imagination
489.03	and went to the work of Belgian comic book master
492.593	François Schuiten in Belgium.
495.241	And this guy is another guy I admire a lot,
498.561	and I wanted him to be involved in the movie
501.033	as a production designer.
503.281	But people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,
505.618	the guy is too busy and he will say no.
508.305	Well, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,
512.159	I might as well call the real guy and ask him,
514.158	and I sent him my books,
516.834	and he answered that he was interested
518.857	in working on the film with me
520.678	because he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.
524.862	In other words, there was space for him to dream with me.
528.756	So here I was with one of my childhood heroes,
531.59	drawing every single frame that's in the film
534.535	to turn that into Montreal in the future.
537.749	And it was an amazing collaboration
539.873	to work with this great artist whom I admire.
542.526	But then, you know, eventually you have to turn
546.214	all these drawings into reality.
548.238	So, again, my solution was to aim
551.367	for the best possible artist that I could think of.
554.474	And there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois
557.875	called Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.
561.857	This guy had been lead compositor on such films
565.339	"as ""Avatar"" and ""Star Trek"" and ""Transformers,"""
568.286	and other unknown projects like this,
570.519	and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,
573.433	and I had to convince him,
574.976	and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,
578.407	he accepted to work on mine.
580.463	Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.
584.25	So if you don't have money to offer to people,
587.664	you must strike their imagination with something
590.879	as nice as you can think of.
593.391	So this is what happened on this movie,
595.767	and that's how it got made,
597.108	and we went to this very nice postproduction company
600.239	in Montreal called Vision Globale,
602.311	and they lent their 60 artists to work full time
606.948	for six months to do this crazy film.
609.894	So I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas
614.683	in your mind, and that people tell you
616.356	that it's impossible to make,
617.843	well, that's an even better reason to want to do it,
620.438	because people have a tendency
622.538	to see the problems rather than the final result,
625.869	whereas if you start to deal with problems
628.651	as being your allies rather than your opponents,
631.453	life will start to dance with you
633.964	in the most amazing way.
635.52	I have experienced it.
637.208	And you might end up doing some crazy projects,
640.267	and who knows, you might even end up
643.206	going to Mars.
645.47	Thank you.
647.171	(Applause)
