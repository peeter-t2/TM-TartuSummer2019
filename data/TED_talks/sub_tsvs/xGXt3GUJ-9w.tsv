26	So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
29	And this is a pretty well-educated audience,
31	so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.
34	You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa
36	are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,
40	and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.
44	If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,
47	is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa
49	that has had success in combating the epidemic.
52	Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --
56	the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s
60	from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
64	If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago
67	the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,
71	and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda
74	and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
80	So today I'm going to talk about some things
82	that you might not know about the epidemic,
84	and I'm actually also going to challenge
86	some of these things that you think that you do know.
88	To do that I'm going to talk about my research
91	as an economist on the epidemic.
93	And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
95	I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
98	But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists
102	to think about a problem that's more traditionally
104	part of public health and epidemiology.
106	And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.
110	Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline
113	to think about problems of another.
115	So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
118	And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
121	But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
125	It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
128	I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,
131	which is really the most important,
133	but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude
135	that we actually cannot develop effective policy
137	unless we really understand how the epidemic works.
140	And the first thing that I want to talk about,
142	the first thing I think we need to understand is:
144	how do people respond to the epidemic?
146	So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
150	So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,
152	there's a really significant cost of sex.
154	If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,
158	if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --
162	your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
166	That is a huge effect.
168	And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
171	And in fact among gay men in the US
173	we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
175	So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,
179	"""Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"""
182	Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
188	It's a huge change in a very short period of time.
190	We didn't see anything like that in Africa.
192	So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here
195	the share of single men having pre-marital sex,
197	or married men having extra-marital sex,
199	and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,
202	and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
205	People are learning more things about it.
207	We see almost no change in sexual behavior.
209	These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.
213	This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,
217	and that to understand this you need to think about health
220	the way than an economist does -- as an investment.
223	So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about
226	whether to add some new functionality to your program,
229	it's important to think about how much it costs.
231	It's also important to think about what the benefit is.
233	And one part of that benefit is how much longer
235	you think this program is going to be active.
237	If version 10 is coming out next week,
239	there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
242	But your health decisions are the same.
244	Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,
246	every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,
249	that's a costly investment in your health.
251	But how much you want to invest is going to depend
253	on how much longer you expect to live in the future,
255	even if you don't make those investments.
257	AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
260	People really like to have sex.
263	But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
269	But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:
276	I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,
280	that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
283	But we really need to test that.
285	And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:
288	do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
292	And the way that I'm going to do that is,
294	I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
297	So malaria is a disease that kills you.
300	It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
303	And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria
306	are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
310	So one way to test to see whether we can explain
312	some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy
315	is to look and see is there more behavior change
318	in areas where there's less malaria.
320	So that's what this figure shows you.
322	This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --
326	what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
330	If you look at the blue line,
332	the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,
335	actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot
338	as HIV prevalence goes up.
340	Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --
342	it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --
345	actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
350	This is not just through malaria.
352	Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality
355	change their behavior less in response to HIV
358	than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
361	There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
366	So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.
369	It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
372	But it also tells us something about policy.
374	Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,
377	it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,
380	in combating poor indoor air quality,
382	in improving maternal mortality rates.
384	Because if you improve those things,
386	then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
390	But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
394	Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,
398	may not be enough, at least not alone.
400	If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,
402	even if they know everything about the disease,
404	they still may not change their behavior.
406	So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.
409	People aren't changing their behavior enough
411	to decrease the growth in the epidemic.
414	So we're going to need to think about policy
416	and what kind of policies might be effective.
418	And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.
421	The reason that we know that the ABC campaign
423	was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
426	In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
428	We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
431	It's not the only place we had any interventions.
433	Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places
437	and see what happened to their prevalence?
440	Unfortunately, there's almost no good data
442	on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
447	"So if I asked you, ""Why don't you go and find me"
449	"the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"""
452	You get on Google, you Google, and you find,
455	actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991
458	are STD patients and pregnant women,
460	which is not a terribly representative group of people.
462	Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,
465	you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,
468	because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
471	But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,
473	some years it's only pregnant women.
475	We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
477	We have no consistent testing.
479	Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.
484	In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,
487	there's been testing in random samples of the population.
490	But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
493	So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,
496	but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
499	So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.
503	And I started thinking about how else might we figure out
507	what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
509	And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,
513	and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
517	To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact
519	that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
521	It kills people in the prime of their lives.
523	Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --
526	this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
530	Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,
532	Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
534	And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
537	That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
540	But in this middle region, between 20 and 45,
543	the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
547	But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,
551	we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
554	But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,
558	we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
563	So it turns out, if you use this technique,
565	actually your estimates of prevalence are very close
567	to what we get from testing random samples in the population,
570	but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
575	So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,
578	and prevalence based on the mortality data
580	for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
584	You can see, almost without exception,
586	the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
590	UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,
594	and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
598	And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
601	So this is another way to see this.
603	You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,
605	we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000
607	rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
611	I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute
613	about how we can use this kind of information to learn something
616	that's going to help us think about the world.
618	But this also tells us that one of these facts
620	that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
623	If you think that 25 million people are infected,
625	if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,
628	maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
630	It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
634	But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
638	What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data
640	to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
644	And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.
647	When I started working on these projects,
649	I was not thinking at all about economics,
651	but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
654	So I am going to talk about exports and prices.
657	And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,
660	in particular export volume, and HIV infections.
664	So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar
668	with the fact that development, that openness to trade,
670	is really good for developing countries.
672	It's good for improving people's lives.
675	But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost
677	when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
680	On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett
682	that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,
684	and I wouldn't be at all worried about that
687	if we never had any contact with Asia.
690	And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.
694	The epidemic was introduced to the US
696	by actually one male steward on an airline flight,
700	who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
702	And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
705	In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time
709	that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
713	Areas with a lot of economic activity --
715	with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --
718	those areas have higher prevalence than others.
720	But that actually doesn't mean at all
722	that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
726	By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,
730	we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --
734	fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case
736	that these things are positively related.
738	More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
742	So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,
746	it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
751	So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.
754	From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,
758	for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act
761	or other policies that encourage trade,
763	we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
768	And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
774	Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,
777	if we know there's this externality --
779	this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --
781	we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
784	But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.
787	Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,
790	in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,
793	it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,
797	that improving exports and improving development --
799	it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead
801	to a decline in HIV prevalence.
804	So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times
806	the special case of Uganda, and the fact that
808	it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
812	It's been widely heralded.
814	It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
820	But now I want to actually also question that.
824	Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence
827	in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
831	But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
837	There was a big decline in coffee prices.
839	Coffee is Uganda's major export.
841	Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up
846	really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
850	So you can see that both of these series --
853	the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --
856	you can see they're both increasing.
858	Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
860	And then actually they track each other
862	a little bit on the increase later in the decade.
864	So if you combine the intuition in this figure
866	with some of the data that I talked about before,
869	it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent
873	of the decline in prevalence in Uganda
875	actually would have happened even without any education campaign.
879	But that's enormously important for policy.
881	We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
883	And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,
886	then there are all sorts of other things
888	maybe we should be spending our money on instead.
890	Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
894	Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
896	There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
898	And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
902	I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,
907	and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit
909	some of the things that you did know.
911	And I hope that I've convinced you maybe
913	that it's important to understand things about the epidemic
915	in order to think about policy.
918	But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.
920	And when I leave here, I'm going to go back
922	and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
925	And the thing that's most exciting about that
927	is every time I think about research, there are more questions.
930	There are more things that I think that I want to do.
932	And what's really, really great about being here
934	is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have
936	are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
939	And I can't wait to hear about what they are.
941	So thank you very much.
