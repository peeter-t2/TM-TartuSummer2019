12.668	At every stage of our lives
14.618	we make decisions that will profoundly influence
18.186	the lives of the people we're going to become,
20.072	and then when we become those people,
21.692	we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made.
24.11	So young people pay good money
26.624	to get tattoos removed that teenagers
29.328	paid good money to get.
30.698	Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people
33.206	who young adults rushed to marry.
35.823	Older adults work hard to lose
38.46	what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain.
41.16	On and on and on.
42.276	The question is, as a psychologist,
42.276	that fascinates me is,
45.308	why do we make decisions
47.06	that our future selves so often regret?
50.756	Now, I think one of the reasons --
52.608	I'll try to convince you today â€”
54.06	is that we have a fundamental misconception
56.62	about the power of time.
59.452	Every one of you knows that the rate of change
61.932	slows over the human lifespan,
63.854	that your children seem to change by the minute
66.712	but your parents seem to change by the year.
69.466	But what is the name of this magical point in life
72.886	where change suddenly goes
74.922	from a gallop to a crawl?
76.704	Is it teenage years? Is it middle age?
79.44	Is it old age? The answer, it turns out,
82.11	for most people, is now,
84.64	wherever now happens to be.
87.591	What I want to convince you today
89.593	is that all of us are walking around with an illusion,
92.612	an illusion that history, our personal history,
95.83	has just come to an end,
97.444	that we have just recently become
99.051	the people that we were always meant to be
102.206	and will be for the rest of our lives.
104.652	Let me give you some data to back up that claim.
106.756	So here's a study of change in people's
109.91	personal values over time.
111.942	Here's three values.
113.141	Everybody here holds all of them,
114.656	but you probably know that as you grow,
116.814	as you age, the balance of these values shifts.
120.173	So how does it do so?
122.082	Well, we asked thousands of people.
124.09	We asked half of them to predict for us
125.877	how much their values would
125.877	change in the next 10 years,
128.887	and the others to tell us
130.263	how much their values had
130.263	changed in the last 10 years.
133.513	And this enabled us to do a really
133.513	interesting kind of analysis,
136.98	because it allowed us to compare the predictions
139.191	of people, say, 18 years old,
141.185	to the reports of people who were 28,
143.297	and to do that kind of analysis
143.297	throughout the lifespan.
145.917	Here's what we found.
147.248	First of all, you are right,
148.541	change does slow down as we age,
151.389	but second, you're wrong,
153.281	because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.
156.679	At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set,
160.542	people vastly underestimated how much change
164.252	they would experience over the next 10 years.
167.171	"We call this the ""end of history"" illusion."
170.105	To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect,
172.488	you can connect these two lines,
173.71	and what you see here is that 18-year-olds
176.474	anticipate changing only as much
178.943	as 50-year-olds actually do.
181.928	Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things.
185.482	For example, personality.
187.3	Many of you know that psychologists now claim
189.966	that there are five fundamental
189.966	dimensions of personality:
193.26	neuroticism, openness to experience,
195.527	agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness.
199.375	Again, we asked people how much they expected
201.622	to change over the next 10 years,
203.198	and also how much they had
203.198	changed over the last 10 years,
206.559	and what we found,
207.475	well, you're going to get used to
207.475	seeing this diagram over and over,
210.03	because once again the rate of change
212.069	does slow as we age,
213.679	but at every age, people underestimate
217.567	how much their personalities will change
219.9	in the next decade.
221.684	And it isn't just ephemeral things
224.005	like values and personality.
225.859	You can ask people about their likes and dislikes,
228.874	their basic preferences.
230.328	For example, name your best friend,
233.13	your favorite kind of vacation,
234.546	what's your favorite hobby,
236.312	what's your favorite kind of music.
238.123	People can name these things.
239.56	We ask half of them to tell us,
241.92	"""Do you think that that will"
241.92	"change over the next 10 years?"""
245.313	and half of them to tell us,
246.467	"""Did that change over the last 10 years?"""
249.158	And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now,
251.741	and here it is again:
253.583	people predict that the friend they have now
256.663	is the friend they'll have in 10 years,
258.211	the vacation they most enjoy now is the one
260.316	they'll enjoy in 10 years,
261.648	and yet, people who are 10 years older all say,
264.39	"""Eh, you know, that's really changed."""
267.319	Does any of this matter?
268.475	Is this just a form of mis-prediction
268.475	that doesn't have consequences?
271.635	No, it matters quite a bit, and
271.635	I'll give you an example of why.
274.557	It bedevils our decision-making in important ways.
278.022	Bring to mind right now for yourself
279.727	your favorite musician today
282	and your favorite musician 10 years ago.
284.368	I put mine up on the screen to help you along.
286.927	Now we asked people
288.53	to predict for us, to tell us
290.767	how much money they would pay right now
293.654	to see their current favorite musician
295.99	perform in concert 10 years from now,
298.507	and on average, people said they would pay
303.271	And yet, when we asked them
303.271	how much they would pay
306.198	to see the person who was their favorite
310.558	they say only 80 dollars.
312.4	Now, in a perfectly rational world,
314.238	these should be the same number,
316.352	but we overpay for the opportunity
318.863	to indulge our current preferences
320.966	because we overestimate their stability.
324.286	Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure,
326.734	but it probably has to do
328.28	with the ease of remembering
330.459	versus the difficulty of imagining.
332.98	Most of us can remember
332.98	who we were 10 years ago,
335.449	but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be,
338.188	and then we mistakenly think
338.188	that because it's hard to imagine,
341.193	it's not likely to happen.
343.267	"Sorry, when people say ""I can't imagine that,"""
346.522	they're usually talking about
346.522	their own lack of imagination,
349.47	and not about the unlikelihood
350.962	of the event that they're describing.
353.952	The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
357.519	It transforms our preferences.
359.162	It reshapes our values.
361.28	It alters our personalities.
362.623	We seem to appreciate this fact,
365.19	but only in retrospect.
366.751	Only when we look backwards do we realize
369.246	how much change happens in a decade.
372.518	It's as if, for most of us,
374.197	the present is a magic time.
376.366	It's a watershed on the timeline.
378.383	It's the moment at which we finally
380.727	become ourselves.
383.23	Human beings are works in progress
385.923	that mistakenly think they're finished.
388.846	The person you are right now
390.636	is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary
394.338	as all the people you've ever been.
396.997	The one constant in our life is change.
400.545	Thank you.
402.641	(Applause)
