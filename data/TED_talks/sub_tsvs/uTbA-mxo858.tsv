14.366	(Nature sounds)
19.82	When I first began
19.82	recording wild soundscapes
24.467	I had no idea that ants,
26.889	insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses
30.368	created a sound signature.
32.496	But they do.
33.939	And so does every wild
33.939	habitat on the planet,
37.352	like the Amazon rainforest
37.352	you're hearing behind me.
40.587	In fact, temperate
40.587	and tropical rainforests
44.161	each produce a vibrant animal orchestra,
47.341	that instantaneous
47.341	and organized expression
50.569	of insects, reptiles,
50.569	amphibians, birds and mammals.
55.377	And every soundscape
55.377	that springs from a wild habitat
58.304	generates its own unique signature,
61.896	one that contains incredible
61.896	amounts of information,
64.813	and it's some of that information
64.813	I want to share with you today.
69.172	The soundscape is made
69.172	up of three basic sources.
72.378	The first is the geophony,
74.917	or the nonbiological sounds that occur
77.283	in any given habitat,
79.26	like wind in the trees, water in a stream,
81.852	waves at the ocean shore,
81.852	movement of the Earth.
85.446	The second of these is the biophony.
88.724	The biophony is all of the sound
91.846	that's generated by organisms
91.846	in a given habitat
94.964	at one time and in one place.
98.584	And the third is all of the sound
98.584	that we humans generate
103.118	that's called anthrophony.
104.936	Some of it is controlled,
104.936	like music or theater,
108.297	but most of it is chaotic and incoherent,
112.214	which some of us refer to as noise.
115.919	There was a time when
115.919	I considered wild soundscapes
118.619	to be a worthless artifact.
120.351	They were just there,
120.351	but they had no significance.
124.433	Well, I was wrong. What
124.433	I learned from these encounters
127.806	was that careful listening gives
127.806	us incredibly valuable tools
132.582	by which to evaluate
132.582	the health of a habitat
135.166	across the entire spectrum of life.
138.978	When I began recording in the late '60s,
142.19	the typical methods
142.19	of recording were limited
145.466	to the fragmented capture
145.466	of individual species
149.934	like birds mostly, in the beginning,
153.03	but later animals
153.03	like mammals and amphibians.
158.731	To me, this was a little like trying
158.731	to understand
162.243	the magnificence
162.243	of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
165.308	by abstracting the sound
165.308	of a single violin player
168.217	out of the context of the orchestra
170.787	and hearing just that one part.
173.89	Fortunately, more and more institutions
176.907	are implementing the more holistic models
178.975	that I and a few of my colleagues
178.975	have introduced
181.338	to the field of soundscape ecology.
185.211	When I began recording
185.211	over four decades ago,
190.279	I could record for 10 hours
192.688	and capture one hour of usable material,
194.923	good enough for an album
194.923	or a film soundtrack
197.98	or a museum installation.
200.699	Now, because of global warming,
203.652	resource extraction,
205.07	and human noise, among many other factors,
208.139	it can take up to 1,000 hours or more
210.815	to capture the same thing.
213.648	Fully 50 percent of my archive
216.703	comes from habitats so radically altered
219.899	that they're either altogether silent
222.799	or can no longer be heard
222.799	in any of their original form.
227.52	The usual methods of evaluating a habitat
229.806	have been done by visually
229.806	counting the numbers of species
233.132	and the numbers of individuals
233.132	within each species in a given area.
237.337	However, by comparing
237.337	data that ties together
240.889	both density and diversity
240.889	from what we hear,
243.689	I'm able to arrive at much
243.689	more precise fitness outcomes.
249.062	And I want to show you some examples
251.102	that typify the possibilities unlocked
253.892	by diving into this universe.
256.914	This is Lincoln Meadow.
258.306	Lincoln
258.306	Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive
260.521	east of San Francisco
260.521	in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
263.414	at about 2,000 meters altitude,
265.511	and I've been recording
265.511	there for many years.
268.32	In 1988, a logging company
268.32	convinced local residents
272.24	that there would be absolutely
272.24	no environmental impact
275.402	from a new method they were trying
277.046	"called ""selective logging,"""
278.766	taking out a tree here and there
280.321	rather than clear-cutting a whole area.
283.604	With permission granted to record
285.364	both before and after the operation,
287.327	I set up my gear and captured
287.327	a large number of dawn choruses
291.945	to very strict protocol
291.945	and calibrated recordings,
295.478	because I wanted a really good baseline.
297.672	This is an example of a spectrogram.
299.857	A spectrogram is a graphic
299.857	illustration of sound
302.288	with time from left
302.288	to right across the page --
307.968	and frequency from the bottom
307.968	of the page to the top,
310.823	lowest to highest.
312.042	And you can see
312.042	that the signature of a stream
315.176	is represented here in the bottom
315.176	third or half of the page,
319.981	while birds that were once in that meadow
323.424	are represented in the signature
323.424	across the top.
326.481	There were a lot of them.
327.636	And here's Lincoln Meadow
327.636	before selective logging.
330.8	(Nature sounds)
345.593	Well, a year later I returned,
347.471	and using the same protocols
349.228	and recording under the same conditions,
351.943	I recorded a number of examples
354.171	of the same dawn choruses,
356.271	and now this is what we've got.
358.414	This is after selective logging.
359.694	You can see that the stream
359.694	is still represented
362.004	in the bottom third of the page,
363.674	but notice what's missing
363.674	in the top two thirds.
368.177	(Nature sounds)
373.69	Coming up is the sound of a woodpecker.
383.177	Well, I've returned
383.177	to Lincoln Meadow 15 times
385.767	in the last 25 years,
387.251	and I can tell you that the biophony,
390.937	the density and diversity
390.937	of that biophony,
393.842	has not yet returned
393.842	to anything like it was
396.394	before the operation.
398.592	But here's a picture
398.592	of Lincoln Meadow taken after,
401.69	and you can see
401.69	that from the perspective of the camera
404.928	or the human eye,
406.039	hardly a stick or a tree
406.039	appears to be out of place,
408.814	which would confirm the logging
408.814	company's contention
411.754	that there's nothing
411.754	of environmental impact.
414.383	However, our ears tell us
414.383	a very different story.
420.8	Young students are always asking me
422.627	what these animals are saying,
424.08	and really I've got no idea.
428.911	But I can tell you that they do
428.911	express themselves.
434.18	Whether or not we understand
434.18	it is a different story.
437.258	I was walking along the shore in Alaska,
439.586	and I came across this tide pool
441.93	filled with a colony of sea anemones,
444.962	these wonderful eating machines,
447.038	relatives of coral and jellyfish.
449.889	And curious to see
449.889	if any of them made any noise,
452.247	I dropped a hydrophone,
453.418	an underwater microphone
453.418	covered in rubber,
456.41	down the mouth part,
457.598	and immediately the critter began
459.359	to absorb the microphone into its belly,
461.568	and the tentacles were
461.568	searching out of the surface
464.262	for something of nutritional value.
466.673	The static-like sounds that are very low,
469.178	that you're going to hear right now.
471.182	(Static sounds)
475.584	Yeah, but watch. When it
475.584	didn't find anything to eat --
478.451	(Honking sound)
479.84	(Laughter)
482.5	I think that's an expression
482.5	that can be understood
484.997	in any language.
486.414	(Laughter)
491.28	At the end of its breeding cycle,
492.88	the Great Basin Spadefoot toad
495.036	digs itself down about a meter under
497.111	the hard-panned desert
497.111	soil of the American West,
500.261	where it can stay for many seasons
502.14	until conditions are just
502.14	right for it to emerge again.
505.64	And when there's enough moisture
505.64	in the soil
507.76	in the spring, frogs will dig
507.76	themselves to the surface
510.555	and gather around these
510.555	large, vernal pools
514.626	in great numbers.
516.663	And they vocalize in a chorus
520.069	that's absolutely in sync
520.069	with one another.
523.277	And they do that for two reasons.
524.873	The first is competitive,
524.873	because they're looking for mates,
528.302	and the second is cooperative,
529.755	because if they're
529.755	all vocalizing in sync together,
532.236	it makes it really difficult
532.236	for predators like coyotes,
536.395	foxes and owls to single
536.395	out any individual for a meal.
540.614	This is a spectrogram
540.614	of what the frog chorusing looks like
543.886	when it's in a very healthy pattern.
546.147	(Frogs croaking)
556.163	Mono Lake is just to the east
556.163	of Yosemite National Park
560.128	in California,
561.957	and it's a favorite
561.957	habitat of these toads,
564.812	and it's also favored by U.S.
564.812	Navy jet pilots,
567.699	who train in their fighters
567.699	flying them at speeds
570.745	exceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour
573.203	and altitudes only a couple hundred meters
575.984	above ground level of the Mono Basin,
578.563	very fast, very low, and so loud
582.237	that the anthrophony, the human noise,
585.103	even though it's six and a half kilometers
587.127	from the frog pond you
587.127	just heard a second ago,
589.927	it masked the sound
589.927	of the chorusing toads.
593.493	You can see in this spectrogram
593.493	that all of the energy
596.759	that was once in the first
596.759	spectrogram is gone
599.506	from the top end of the spectrogram,
601.253	and that there's breaks
601.253	in the chorusing at two and a half,
604.087	four and a half,
604.087	and six and a half seconds,
606.279	and then the sound
606.279	of the jet, the signature,
609.378	is in yellow at the very
609.378	bottom of the page.
611.937	(Frogs croaking)
621.582	Now at the end of that flyby,
623.976	it took the frogs fully 45 minutes
627.465	to regain their chorusing synchronicity,
629.869	during which time, and under a full moon,
632.814	we watched as two coyotes
632.814	and a great horned owl
635.595	came in to pick
635.595	off a few of their numbers.
638.718	The good news is that, with a little bit
638.718	of habitat restoration
642.244	and fewer flights, the frog populations,
644.949	once diminishing
644.949	during the 1980s and early '90s,
648.672	have pretty much returned to normal.
652.205	I want to end with a story
652.205	told by a beaver.
655.144	It's a very sad story,
656.618	but it really illustrates how animals
660.496	can sometimes show emotion,
662.478	a very controversial subject
662.478	among some older biologists.
667.13	A colleague of mine was recording
667.13	in the American Midwest
670.363	around this pond that had been formed
672.905	maybe 16,000 years ago at the end
672.905	of the last ice age.
676.804	It was also formed in part by a beaver dam
678.957	at one end that held
678.957	that whole ecosystem together
681.875	in a very delicate balance.
684.627	And one afternoon, while he was recording,
688.402	there suddenly appeared
688.402	from out of nowhere
692.226	a couple of game wardens,
694.674	who for no apparent reason,
696.269	walked over to the beaver dam,
697.848	dropped a stick of dynamite
697.848	down it, blowing it up,
701.13	killing the female and her young babies.
705.16	Horrified, my colleagues remained behind
707.992	to gather his thoughts
710.033	and to record whatever he could
710.033	the rest of the afternoon,
713.517	and that evening, he captured
713.517	a remarkable event:
718.41	the lone surviving male beaver
718.41	swimming in slow circles
722.599	crying out inconsolably for its
722.599	lost mate and offspring.
728.332	This is probably the saddest sound
731.241	I've ever heard coming from any organism,
734.159	human or other.
738.517	(Beaver crying)
754.18	Yeah. Well.
755.995	There are many facets to soundscapes,
758.577	among them the ways in which animals
758.577	taught us to dance and sing,
761.793	which I'll save for another time.
764.418	But you have heard how biophonies
767.436	help clarify our understanding
767.436	of the natural world.
771.279	You've heard the impact
771.279	of resource extraction,
773.743	human noise and habitat destruction.
776.807	And where environmental
776.807	sciences have typically
779.07	tried to understand
779.07	the world from what we see,
782.127	a much fuller understanding
782.127	can be got from what we hear.
786.595	Biophonies and geophonies
786.595	are the signature voices
790.452	of the natural world,
792.443	and as we hear them,
793.796	we're endowed with a sense of place,
796.468	the true story of the world we live in.
799.885	In a matter of seconds,
801.804	a soundscape reveals much more information
804.519	from many perspectives,
806.067	from quantifiable data
806.067	to cultural inspiration.
810.689	Visual capture implicitly frames
813.59	a limited frontal perspective
813.59	of a given spatial context,
817.586	while soundscapes widen that scope
819.959	to a full 360 degrees,
819.959	completely enveloping us.
825.144	And while a picture may
825.144	be worth 1,000 words,
828.916	a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.
833.289	And our ears tell us
835.413	that the whisper
835.413	of every leaf and creature
839.008	speaks to the natural
839.008	sources of our lives,
842.082	which indeed may hold the secrets
842.082	of love for all things,
847.144	especially our own humanity,
849.102	and the last word goes
849.102	to a jaguar from the Amazon.
855.387	(Growling)
869.135	Thank you for listening.
871.335	(Applause)
