16.315	It's an amazing thing
17.49	that we're here to talk
17.49	about the year of patients rising.
22.266	You heard stories earlier today
24.01	about patients who are taking
24.01	control of their cases,
27.062	patients who are saying,
28.241	"""You know what, I know what the odds are,"
30.239	but I'm going to look
30.239	for more information.
32.413	I'm going to define
32.413	"what the terms of my success are."""
36.197	I'm going to be sharing with you
36.197	how, four years ago, I almost died --
40.01	found out I was, in fact,
40.01	already almost dead --
42.917	and what I then found out
45.179	about what's called
45.179	the e-Patient movement.
47.405	I'll explain what that term means.
49.078	I had been blogging
49.078	"under the name ""Patient Dave,"""
51.87	and when I discovered this,
53.268	I just renamed myself e-Patient Dave.
55.939	"Regarding the word ""patient"":"
57.666	When I first started a few years ago
57.666	getting involved in health care
61.626	and attending meetings
61.626	as just a casual observer,
64.01	I noticed that people
64.01	would talk about patients
66.273	as if it was somebody
66.273	who's not in the room here --
68.872	somebody out there.
70.29	Some of our talks today,
70.29	we still act like that.
72.827	But I'm here to tell you:
74.763	"""patient"" is not a third-person word."
78.145	All right?
79.332	You yourself will find
79.332	yourself in a hospital bed --
82.576	or your mother, your child --
84.255	there are heads nodding, people who say,
86.197	"""Yes, I know exactly what you mean."""
87.962	So when you hear what I'm going
87.962	to talk about here today,
91.01	first of all, I want to say that I am here
94.064	on behalf of all the patients
94.064	that I have ever met,
96.668	all the ones I haven't met.
98.395	This is about letting patients
98.395	play a more active role
102.192	in helping health care,
102.192	in fixing health care.
105.193	One of the senior doctors at my hospital,
107.216	Charlie Safran,
107.216	and his colleague, Warner Slack,
109.814	have been saying for decades
111.356	that the most underutilized
111.356	resource in all of health care
115.14	is the patient.
116.859	They have been saying that
116.859	since the 1970s.
119.549	Now, I'm going to step back in history.
121.529	This is from July, 1969.
123.439	I was a freshman in college,
125.125	and this was when we first
125.125	landed on the Moon.
128.113	And it was the first time
129.568	we had ever seen from another surface --
132.355	that's the place
132.355	where you and I are right now,
134.623	where we live.
135.805	The world was changing.
137.376	It was about to change
137.376	in ways that nobody could foresee.
140.377	A few weeks later, Woodstock happened.
144.645	Three days of fun and music.
146.749	Here, just for historical authenticity,
148.873	is a picture of me in that year.
150.696	(Laughter)
153.946	Yeah, the wavy hair, the blue eyes --
155.947	it was really something.
157.61	That fall of 1969,
159.611	the Whole Earth Catalog came out.
161.522	It was a hippie journal
161.522	of self-sufficiency.
165.01	We think of hippies
165.01	of being just hedonists,
168.065	but there's a very strong component --
168.065	I was in that movement --
171.29	a very strong component
171.29	of being responsible for yourself.
174.658	This book's title's subtitle
174.658	"is ""Access to Tools."""
178.579	It talked about how to build
178.579	your own house,
180.899	how to grow your own food,
180.899	all kinds of things.
183.328	In the 1980s,
184.756	this young doctor, Tom Ferguson,
186.914	was the medical editor
186.914	of the Whole Earth Catalog.
189.565	He saw that the great majority
189.565	of what we do in medicine and health care
194.36	is taking care of ourselves.
196.271	In fact, he said it was 70 to 80 percent
198.646	of how we actually
198.646	take care of our bodies.
200.939	Well, he also saw that when health care
200.939	turns to medical care
205.641	because of a more serious disease,
207.575	the key thing that holds us back
207.575	is access to information.
210.923	And when the Web came along,
210.923	that changed everything,
214.213	because not only
214.213	could we find information,
216.83	we could find other people like ourselves
219.57	who could gather,
219.57	who could bring us information.
222.185	"And he coined this term ""e-Patients"" --"
224.724	equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled.
227.079	Obviously, at this stage of life
228.804	he was in a somewhat more dignified
228.804	form than he was back then.
232.795	Now, I was an engaged patient
232.795	long before I ever heard of the term.
236.773	In 2006, I went to my doctor
236.773	for a regular physical,
239.773	"and I had said, ""I have a sore shoulder."""
242.096	Well, I got an X-ray,
243.693	and the next morning --
245.365	you may have noticed, those of you
245.365	who have been through a medical crisis
248.914	will understand this.
250.138	This morning, some of the speakers
250.138	named the date when they found out
254.624	about their condition.
255.919	For me, it was 9am
258.356	on January 3, 2007.
261.084	I was at the office; my desk was clean.
263.603	I had the blue partition
263.603	carpet on the walls.
267.347	The phone rang and it was my doctor.
270.167	"He said, ""Dave, I pulled"
270.167	up the X-ray image
273.01	"on the screen on the computer at home."""
275.124	"He said, ""Your shoulder"
275.124	is going to be fine,
277.215	"but Dave, there's something in your lung."""
279.324	And if you look in that red oval,
281.256	that shadow was not supposed to be there.
285.01	To make a long story short,
287.01	"I said, ""So you need me"
287.01	"to get back in there?"""
289.189	"He said, ""Yeah, we're going to need"
289.189	"to do a CT scan of your chest."""
292.464	In parting, I said,
292.464	"""Is there anything I should do?"""
295.129	He said -- think about this one,
297.01	this is the advice your doctor gives you:
299.01	"""Just go home and have a glass"
299.01	"of wine with your wife."""
304.283	I went in for the CAT scan.
307.478	It turns out there were
307.478	five of these things in both my lungs.
310.729	So at that point we knew
310.729	that it was cancer.
312.915	We knew it wasn't lung cancer.
314.978	That meant it was metastasized
314.978	from somewhere.
318.388	The question was, where from?
320.494	So I went in for an ultrasound.
323.144	I got to do what many women have --
325.661	"the jelly on the belly and the, ""Bzzzz!"""
329.01	My wife came with me.
331.195	She's a veterinarian,
332.824	so she's seen lots of ultrasounds.
334.645	I mean, she knows I'm not a dog.
336.253	(Laughter)
337.921	This is an MRI image.
340.922	This is much sharper
340.922	than an ultrasound would be.
343.368	What we saw in that kidney
346.142	was that big blob there.
347.677	There were actually two of these:
347.677	one was growing out the front
350.741	and had already erupted
350.741	and latched onto the bowel.
353.188	One was growing out the back
353.188	and it attached to the psoas muscle,
356.431	which is a big muscle in the back
356.431	that I'd never heard of,
359.24	but all of a sudden I cared about it.
361.097	(Laughter)
362.12	I went home.
363.307	Now, I've been Googling --
364.605	I've been online since 1989,
364.605	on CompuServe.
367.019	I went home, and I know
367.019	you can't read the details here;
369.673	that's not important.
370.863	My point is, I went to a respected
370.863	medical website, WebMD,
375.091	because I know how to filter out junk.
377.373	I also found my wife online.
379.898	Before I met her,
381.604	I went through some suboptimal
381.604	search results.
384.104	(Laughter)
385.676	So I looked for quality information.
388.854	There's so much about trust --
390.61	what sources of information can we trust?
393.137	Where does my body end
393.137	and an invader start?
397.925	A cancer, a tumor, is something
397.925	you grow out of your own tissue.
401.087	How does that happen?
402.676	Where does medical ability end and start?
406.719	Well, so what I read on WebMD:
409.175	"""The prognosis is poor"
409.175	for progressing renal cell cancer.
414.185	"Almost all patients are incurable."""
417.567	I've been online long enough to know
417.567	if I don't like the first results I get,
421.306	I go look for more.
422.483	And what I found on other websites was,
425.169	even by the third page of Google results:
427.557	"""Outlook is bleak."""
429.612	"""Prognosis is grim."""
432.199	"And I'm thinking, ""What the heck?"""
434.319	I didn't feel sick at all.
436.075	I mean, I'd been getting
436.075	tired in the evening,
438.289	but I was 56 years old, you know?
440.329	I was slowly losing weight,
442.01	but for me, that was what
442.01	the doctor told me to do.
446.258	It was really something.
447.954	And this is the diagram
447.954	of stage 4 kidney cancer
451.158	from the drug I eventually got.
452.939	Totally by coincidence,
452.939	there's that thing in my lung.
456.009	In the left femur, the left thigh bone,
456.009	there's another one.
459.01	I had one. My leg eventually snapped.
461.399	I fainted and landed on it, and it broke.
464.345	There's one in the skull,
465.617	and then for good measure,
465.617	I had these other tumors,
468.104	including, by the time
468.104	my treatment started,
470.199	one was growing out of my tongue.
471.812	I had kidney cancer
471.812	growing out of my tongue.
473.98	And what I read
475.163	was that my median survival was 24 weeks.
478.424	This was bad.
479.903	I was facing the grave.
482.303	"I thought, ""What's my mother's face"
482.303	going to look like
484.901	"on the day of my funeral?"""
486.605	I had to sit down with my daughter
486.605	"and say, ""Here's the situation."""
492.114	Her boyfriend was with her.
493.552	"I said, ""I don't want you guys"
493.552	to get married prematurely,
496.377	just so you can do it
496.377	"while Dad's still alive."""
500.339	It's really serious.
501.932	If you wonder why patients
501.932	are motivated and want to help,
505.536	think about this.
506.718	Well, my doctor prescribed
506.718	a patient community, ACOR.org,
510.772	a network of cancer patients,
510.772	of all amazing things.
514.01	Very quickly they told me,
516.01	"""Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease."
518.01	Get yourself to a specialist center.
520.011	There is no cure, but there's something
520.011	that sometimes works --
523.034	it usually doesn't --
524.614	called high-dosage interleukin.
526.452	Most hospitals don't offer it,
528.484	so they won't even tell you it exists.
530.683	Don't let them give you
530.683	anything else first.
532.826	And by the way, here are four doctors
532.826	in your part of the United States
536.223	"who offer it, and their phone numbers."""
538.198	How amazing is that?
540.66	(Applause)
543.498	Here's the thing:
544.718	Here we are, four years later --
546.33	you can't find a website
546.33	that gives patients that information.
549.93	Government-approved,
549.93	American Cancer Society,
552.487	but patients know
552.487	what patients want to know.
556.094	It's the power of patient networks.
558.889	This amazing substance --
558.889	again, I mentioned:
562.142	Where does my body end?
563.52	My oncologist and I talk a lot these days
565.938	because I try to keep my talks
565.938	technically accurate.
568.463	"And he said, ""You know, the immune"
568.463	system is good at detecting invaders,
573.537	bacteria coming from outside,
575.878	but when it's your own tissue
575.878	that you've grown,
578.376	"it's a whole different thing."""
579.919	And I went through
579.919	a mental exercise, actually,
582.899	because I started a patient support
582.899	community of my own on a website,
587.741	and one of my friends --
587.741	one of my relatives, actually -- said,
590.799	"""Look, Dave, who grew this thing?"
594.154	Are you going to set yourself up
594.154	"as mentally attacking yourself?"""
598.201	So we went into it.
599.829	The story of how all that
599.829	happened is in the book.
602.57	Anyway, this is the way
602.57	the numbers unfolded.
605.018	Me being me, I put the numbers
605.018	from my hospital's website,
608.173	for my tumor sizes,
609.356	into a spreadsheet.
610.531	Don't worry about the numbers.
612.01	You see, that's the immune system.
613.786	Amazing thing, those two yellow lines
615.787	are where I got the two doses
615.787	of interleukin two months apart.
620.01	And look at how the tumor sizes
620.01	plummeted in between.
623.164	Just incredible.
624.647	Who knows what we'll be able to do
624.647	when we learn to make more use of it?
628.101	The punch line is that a year
628.101	and a half later,
630.441	I was there when this magnificent
630.441	young woman, my daughter,
634.765	got married.
635.952	And when she came down those steps,
638.351	and it was just her and me
638.351	for that moment,
640.605	I was so glad that she didn't have
640.605	to say to her mother,
643.851	"""I wish Dad could have been here."""
645.931	And this is what we're doing
645.931	when we make health care better.
649.835	Now, I want to talk briefly
649.835	about a couple of other patients
652.762	who are doing everything
652.762	in their power to improve health care.
655.795	This is Regina Holliday,
657.458	a painter in Washington DC,
657.458	whose husband died of kidney cancer
661.681	a year after my disease.
663.205	She's painting, here, a mural
665.01	of his horrible
665.01	final weeks in the hospital.
668.01	One of the things that she discovered
670.481	was that her husband's medical record
670.481	in this paper folder
674.789	was just disorganized.
676.339	"And she thought, ""You know,"
676.339	if I have a nutrition facts label
679.628	on the side of a cereal box,
681.375	why can't there be something that simple
683.354	telling every new nurse who comes on duty,
685.922	every new doctor,
687.171	"the basics about my husband's condition?"""
689.305	So she painted this medical facts mural
689.305	with a nutrition label,
694.605	something like that,
695.786	in a diagram of him.
697.01	She then, last year, painted this diagram.
700.01	She studied health care like me.
701.918	She came to realize
701.918	there were a lot of people
704.378	who'd written patient-advocate books
706.412	that you just don't hear
706.412	about at medical conferences.
709.279	Patients are such
709.279	an underutilized resource.
712.939	Well, as it said in my introduction,
714.688	I've gotten somewhat known for saying
716.494	that patients should have
716.494	access to their data.
718.725	I actually said at one conference
718.725	a couple of years ago,
721.425	"""Give me my damn data,"
722.612	because you people
722.612	"can't be trusted to keep it clean."""
725.239	"And here, she has our ""damned"" data --"
728.01	it's a pun --
729.328	which is starting to break out,
729.328	starting to break through --
732.28	the water symbolizes our data.
734.4	And in fact,
735.575	I want to do a little something
735.575	improvisational for you.
738.303	There's a guy on Twitter that I know,
738.303	a health IT guy outside Boston,
742.196	and he wrote the e-Patient rap.
744.752	And it goes like this.
746.474	(Laughter)
748.116	(Beatboxing)
752.2	(Rapping) Gimme my damn data
754.249	I wanna be an e-Patient just like Dave
756.741	Gimme my damn data,
756.741	'cause it's my life to save
759.301	(Normal voice) Now, I'm not going
759.301	to go any further --
761.903	(Applause) (Cheering)
776.265	Well, thank you. That shot the timing.
778.694	(Laughter)
780.359	Think about the possibility.
781.854	Why is it that iPhones and iPads
781.854	advance far faster
786.264	than the health tools
786.264	that are available to you
788.528	to help take care of your family?
790.78	Here's a website, VisibleBody.com,
790.78	that I stumbled across.
794.924	"And I thought, ""You know,"
794.924	"I wonder what my psoas muscle is?"""
797.882	So you can click on things and remove it.
799.883	"And I saw, ""Aha! That's the kidney"
799.883	"and the psoas muscle."""
802.884	I was rotating it in 3D
802.884	"and saying, ""I understand now."""
806.869	And then I realized
806.869	it reminded me of Google Earth,
809.828	where you can fly to any address.
812.605	"And I thought, ""Why not take this"
812.605	and connect it to my digital scan data
817.957	"and have Google Earth for my body?"""
820.866	What did Google come out with this year?
823.01	Now there's Google Body browser.
825.618	But you see, it's still generic.
827.619	It's not my data.
829.523	But if we can get that data
829.523	out from behind the dam
832.621	so software innovators can pounce on it
835.622	the way software innovators like to do,
837.922	who knows what we'll be able
837.922	to come up with.
840.132	One final story.
841.307	This is Kelly Young, a rheumatoid
841.307	arthritis patient from Florida.
846.258	This is a live story,
846.258	unfolding just in the last few weeks.
849.801	RA patients, as they call themselves --
849.801	"her blog is ""RA Warrior"" --"
855.369	have a big problem,
856.75	because 40 percent of them
856.75	have no visible symptoms.
860.01	And that makes it really hard
860.01	to tell how the disease is going,
863.092	and some doctors think,
863.092	"""Yeah right, you're really in pain."""
866.273	Well, she found,
866.273	through her online research,
869.01	a nuclear bone scan
869.01	that's usually used for cancer,
872.422	but it can also reveal inflammation.
875.235	And she saw that
875.235	if there is no inflammation,
879.169	then the scan is a uniform gray.
881.653	So she took it.
882.872	And the radiologist's report
882.872	"said, ""No cancer found."""
887.177	Well, that's not what
887.177	he was supposed to do with it.
889.68	So she wanted to have it read again,
892.125	and her doctor fired her.
894.01	She pulled up the CD.
895.917	"He said, ""If you don't want to follow"
895.917	"my instructions, go away."""
900.219	So she pulled up the CD
900.219	of the scan images,
903.01	and look at all those hot spots.
905.01	And she's now actively engaged on her blog
908.01	in looking for assistance
908.01	in getting better care.
911.32	See, that is an empowered
911.32	patient -- no medical training.
914.136	We are, you are,
916.131	the most underused
916.131	resource in health care.
918.85	What she was able to do
920.39	was because she had access
920.39	to the raw data.
923.156	How big a deal was this?
924.552	Well at TED2009,
926.322	Tim Berners-Lee himself,
926.322	inventor of the Web,
929.62	gave a talk where he said
929.62	the next big thing
932.621	is not to have your browser find
932.621	other people's articles about the data,
937.32	but the raw data.
938.526	And he got them chanting
938.526	by the end of the talk,
941.32	"""Raw data now! Raw data now!"""
945.011	And I ask you,
946.549	three words, please,
946.549	to improve health care:
949.827	Let patients help!
951.828	Let patients help!
953.566	Let patients help!
955.445	Let patients help!
957.387	Thank you.
958.675	(Applause)
975.422	For all the patients around the world
975.422	watching this on the Webcast,
980.832	God bless you, everyone.
980.832	Let patients help.
983.177	Host: And bless yourself.
983.177	Thank you very much.
