12.891	Have you ever been asked
12.891	by your Chinese friend,
15.713	"""What is your zodiac sign?"""
17.947	Don't think they are making small talk.
20.456	"If you say, ""I'm a Monkey,"""
22.407	they immediately know
23.79	you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.
27.21	(Laughter)
28.24	Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way
28.24	of asking your age.
32.616	By revealing your zodiac sign,
32.616	you are also being evaluated.
36.529	Judgments are being made
36.529	about your fortune or misfortune,
40.593	your personality, career prospects
42.995	and how you will do in a given year.
45.322	If you share you and your
45.322	partner's animal signs,
48.242	they will paint a picture in their mind
48.242	about your private life.
52.725	Maybe you don't believe
52.725	in the Chinese zodiac.
55.372	As a quarter of the world population
55.372	is influenced by it,
59.227	you'd be wise to do something about that.
62.406	So what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?
65.991	Most Westerners think
65.991	of Greco-Roman zodiac,
69.211	the signs divided into 12 months.
71.973	The Chinese zodiac is different.
73.948	It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,
77.15	starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,
79.75	and has no association
79.75	with constellations.
83.663	For example, if you were born
83.663	in 1975, you are a Rabbit.
89.273	Can you see your zodiac sign there?
92.139	Our Chinese ancestors constructed
92.139	a very complicated theoretical framework
97.448	based on yin and yang, the five elements
97.448	and the 12 zodiac animals.
102.486	Over thousands of years,
104.305	this popular culture has affected
104.305	people's major decisions,
108.801	such as naming, marriage, giving birth
108.801	and attitude towards each other.
114.409	And some of the implications
114.409	are quite amazing.
118.248	The Chinese believe certain animals
118.248	get on better than the others.
123.147	So parents choose specific years
123.147	to give birth to babies,
127.865	because they believe the team effort
127.865	by the right combination of animals
132.811	can give prosperity to families.
135.667	We even refer to the zodiac
135.667	when entering into romantic relations.
140.63	I'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance
140.63	with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.
147.425	Chinese people believe some animals
147.425	are natural enemies.
151.536	As a Pig, I need
151.536	to be careful with a Snake.
155.102	Raise your hand if you are a Snake.
157.726	Let's have a chat later.
159.283	(Laughter)
160.702	We believe some animals
160.702	are luckier than the others,
163.969	such as the Dragon.
165.688	Unlike the Western tradition,
167.57	the Chinese Dragon is a symbol
167.57	for power, strength and wealth.
172.178	It's everyone's dream
172.178	to have a Dragon baby.
175.359	Jack Ma's parents
175.359	must have been very proud.
178.499	And they are not the only ones.
180.085	In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,
183.006	the birthrate in China,
183.006	Hong Kong and Taiwan
185.329	increased by five percent.
187.596	That means another
187.596	one million more babies.
192.497	With a traditional
192.497	preference to baby boys,
195.434	the boy-girl ratio that year
195.434	was 120 to 100.
200.431	When those Dragon boys grow up,
202.219	they will face much more severe
202.219	competition in love and job markets.
207.669	According to the BBC and the Chinese
207.669	government's press release,
211.607	January 2015 saw a peak
211.607	of Cesarean sections.
216.835	Why?
218.726	That was the last month
218.726	for the Year of the Horse.
222.161	It's not because they like horses so much,
224.787	it's because they try to avoid
224.787	having unlucky Goat babies.
228.28	(Laughter)
229.382	If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.
232.185	Those are Goat babies.
233.939	They don't look like losers to me.
236.073	(Laughter)
237.262	Tiger is another undesirable animal,
240.048	due to its volatile temperament.
242.337	Many Chinese regions
242.337	saw a sharp decline of birthrate
246.214	during those years.
248.122	Perhaps one should consider
248.122	zodiac in reverse,
251.816	as those Tiger and Goat babies
251.816	will face much less competition.
256.044	Maybe they are the lucky ones.
260.055	I went through the Forbes
260.055	top 300 richest people in the world,
264.539	and it's interesting to see
266.596	the most undesirable two animals,
266.596	the Goat and Tiger,
270.198	are at the top of the chart,
272.544	even higher than the Dragon.
274.351	So maybe we should consider,
276.495	maybe it's much better
276.495	to have less competition.
280.384	One last but interesting point:
282.429	many Chinese people make
282.429	their investment decisions
285.286	based on the zodiac sign index.
288.611	Although the belief and tradition
288.611	of the zodiac sign
292.3	has been over thousands of years,
295.051	the trend of using it
295.051	in making major decisions
298.369	did not really happen
298.369	until the past few decades.
301.934	Our ancestors were very busy
301.934	surviving poverty, drought,
306.354	famine, riot, disease and civil war.
310.028	And finally, Chinese people
310.028	have the time, wealth and technology
315.814	to create an ideal life
315.814	they've always wanted.
319.604	The collective decision
319.604	made by 1.3 billion people
323.275	has caused the fluctuation in economics
323.275	and demand on everything,
327.85	from health care and education
327.85	to property and consumer goods.
333.092	As China plays such an important role
333.092	in the global economy and geopolitics,
338.09	the decisions made based on the zodiac
338.09	and other Chinese traditions
342.223	end up impacting everyone
342.223	around the world.
347.203	Are there any Monkeys here?
353.22	Monkeys are clever, curious,
353.22	creative and mischievous.
358.953	Thank you.
360.135	(Applause)
