13.111	Today, I am going to talk about anger.
21.128	When I was 11,
23.13	seeing some of my friends 
23.13	leaving the school
26.462	because their parents 
26.462	could not afford textbooks
30.684	made me angry.
35.316	When I was 27,
38.068	hearing the plight
38.068	of a desperate slave father
43.28	whose daughter was 
43.28	about to be sold to a brothel
48.302	made me angry.
52.423	At the age of 50,
54.763	lying on the street,
54.763	in a pool of blood,
59.586	along with my own son,
62.532	made me angry.
67.299	Dear friends, for centuries
67.299	we were taught anger is bad.
73.274	Our parents, teachers, priests --
75.486	everyone taught us how to control 
75.486	and suppress our anger.
84.241	But I ask why?
87.596	Why can't we convert our anger
87.596	for the larger good of society?
92.513	Why can't we use our anger
94.109	to challenge and change
94.109	the evils of the world?
101.705	That I tried to do.
106.036	Friends,
109.367	most of the brightest ideas
109.367	came to my mind out of anger.
115.814	Like when I was 35 and sat 
115.814	in a locked-up, tiny prison.
126.564	The whole night, I was angry.
129.957	But it has given birth to a new idea.
133.017	But I will come to that later on.
136.176	Let me begin with the story
136.176	of how I got a name for myself.
145.481	I had been a big admirer 
145.481	of Mahatma Gandhi since my childhood.
151.032	Gandhi fought and lead 
151.032	India's freedom movement.
157.261	But more importantly,
159.299	he taught us how to treat 
159.299	the most vulnerable sections,
166.034	the most deprived people, 
166.034	with dignity and respect.
171.595	And so, when India was celebrating
176.562	Mahatma Gandhi's 
176.562	birth centenary in 1969 --
179.829	at that time I was 15 --
182.117	an idea came to my mind.
185.774	Why can't we celebrate it differently?
189.244	I knew, as perhaps
189.244	many of you might know,
194.672	that in India, a large number of people
194.672	are born in the lowest segment of caste.
204.185	And they are treated as untouchables.
207.324	These are the people --
208.656	forget about allowing them 
208.656	to go to the temples,
213.066	they cannot even go into the houses 
213.066	and shops of high-caste people.
220.25	So I was very impressed with 
220.25	the leaders of my town
225.564	who were speaking very highly against
225.564	the caste system and untouchability
230.102	and talking of Gandhian ideals.
233.774	So inspired by that, I thought,
233.774	let us set an example
236.944	by inviting these people to eat food
236.944	cooked and served
243.389	by the untouchable community.
246.619	I went to some low-caste,
246.619	so-called untouchable, people,
253.421	tried to convince them,
253.421	but it was unthinkable for them.
257.807	"They told me, ""No, no. It's not possible."
257.807	"It never happened."""
263.07	"I said, ""Look at these leaders,"
264.784	they are so great, 
264.784	they are against untouchability.
267.221	They will come. If nobody comes, 
267.221	"we can set an example."""
272.891	These people thought that I was too naive.
280.161	Finally, they were convinced.
282.651	My friends and I took our bicycles
282.651	and invited political leaders.
289.982	And I was so thrilled, rather, empowered
293.126	to see that each one of them 
293.126	agreed to come.
299.192	"I thought, ""Great idea."
299.192	We can set an example.
302.083	"We can bring about change in the society."""
307.451	The day has come.
309.724	All these untouchables,
309.724	three women and two men,
315.467	they agreed to come.
319.436	I could recall that they had used 
319.436	the best of their clothes.
326.475	They brought new utensils.
330	They had taken baths 
330	hundreds of times
332.339	because it was unthinkable
332.339	for them to do.
335.3	It was the moment of change.
339.254	They gathered. Food was cooked.
342.402	It was 7 o'clock.
345	By 8 o'clock, we kept on waiting,
347.876	because it's not very uncommon 
347.876	that the leaders become late,
352.857	for an hour or so.
355.239	So after 8 o'clock, we took our bicycles
355.239	and went to these leaders' homes,
361.922	just to remind them.
366.248	One of the leader's wives told me,
370.945	"""Sorry, he is having some headache,"
370.945	"perhaps he cannot come."""
375.96	I went to another leader
378.037	and his wife told me, 
378.037	"""Okay, you go, he will definitely join."""
383.357	So I thought that the dinner
383.357	will take place,
387.469	though not at that large a scale.
393.352	I went back to the venue, which was
393.352	a newly built Mahatma Gandhi Park.
400.559	It was 10 o'clock.
403.483	None of the leaders showed up.
408.132	That made me angry.
412.275	I was standing, leaning against
412.275	Mahatma Gandhi's statue.
421.839	I was emotionally drained,
421.839	rather exhausted.
428.89	Then I sat down where 
428.89	the food was lying.
437.695	I kept my emotions on hold.
439.785	But then, when I took the first bite,
444.279	I broke down in tears.
447.21	And suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
452.149	And it was the healing, motherly touch 
452.149	of an untouchable woman.
458.047	And she told me,
458.047	"""Kailash, why are you crying?"
463.598	You have done your bit.
466.011	You have eaten the food
466.011	cooked by untouchables,
469.136	"which has never happened in our memory."""
473.207	"She said, ""You won today."""
477.789	And my friends, she was right.
484.059	I came back home, a little after midnight,
487.789	shocked to see that several 
487.789	high-caste elderly people
492.363	were sitting in my courtyard.
494.517	I saw my mother and 
494.517	elderly women were crying
497.613	and they were pleading 
497.613	to these elderly people
502.071	because they had threatened 
502.071	to outcaste my whole family.
506.345	And you know, outcasting the family
506.345	is the biggest social punishment
511.477	one can think of.
515.981	Somehow they agreed to punish only me,
515.981	and the punishment was purification.
520.821	That means I had to go 600 miles
520.821	away from my hometown
525.336	to the River Ganges to take a holy dip.
529.267	And after that, I should organize a feast
529.267	for priests, 101 priests,
533.691	wash their feet and drink that water.
538.529	It was total nonsense,
541.528	and I refused to accept that punishment.
545.267	How did they punish me?
547.397	I was barred from entering into my own 
547.397	kitchen and my own dining room,
553.194	my utensils were separated.
556.246	But the night when I was angry,
556.246	they wanted to outcaste me.
562.6	But I decided to outcaste 
562.6	the entire caste system.
567.503	(Applause)
572.988	And that was possible because
572.988	the beginning would have been
578.003	to change the family name, or surname,
580.119	because in India, most of
580.119	the family names are caste names.
583.784	So I decided to drop my name.
586.306	And then, later on, I gave 
586.306	a new name to myself: Satyarthi,
592.81	"that means, ""seeker of truth."""
597.216	(Applause)
601.248	And that was the beginning 
601.248	of my transformative anger.
606.095	Friends, maybe one of you can tell me,
608.704	what was I doing before becoming
608.704	a children's rights activist?
614.41	Does anybody know?
616.898	No.
618.169	I was an engineer, an electrical engineer.
624.558	And then I learned how the energy
629.662	of burning fire, coal,
634.146	the nuclear blast inside the chambers,
638.25	raging river currents,
641.442	fierce winds,
645.066	could be converted into the light 
645.066	and lives of millions.
650.963	I also learned how the most
650.963	uncontrollable form of energy
655.495	could be harnessed for good 
655.495	and making society better.
664.925	So I'll come back to the story
664.925	of when I was caught in the prison:
671.692	I was very happy freeing 
671.692	a dozen children from slavery,
675.919	handing them over to their parents.
678.89	I cannot explain my joy 
678.89	when I free a child.
683.238	I was so happy.
685.458	But when I was waiting for my train
685.458	to come back to my hometown, Delhi,
691.021	I saw that dozens of children 
691.021	were arriving;
694.264	they were being trafficked by someone.
697.562	I stopped them, those people.
700.415	I complained to the police.
702.517	So the policemen, instead of helping me,
707.071	they threw me in this small, 
707.071	tiny shell, like an animal.
713.573	And that was the night of anger
715.121	when one of the brightest 
715.121	and biggest ideas was born.
719.632	I thought that if I keep on freeing 10 
719.632	children, and 50 more will join,
725.1	that's not done.
726.56	And I believed in the power of consumers,
729.368	and let me tell you that this
729.368	was the first time
732.852	when a campaign was launched by me
732.852	or anywhere in the world,
737.968	to educate and sensitize the consumers
742.041	to create a demand
742.041	for child-labor-free rugs.
747.691	In Europe and America, 
747.691	we have been successful.
751.083	And it has resulted 
751.083	in a fall in child labor
755.768	in South Asian countries by 80 percent.
759.024	(Applause)
764.736	Not only that, but this first-ever 
764.736	consumer's power, or consumer's campaign
771.397	has grown in other countries
771.397	and other industries,
775.505	maybe chocolate, maybe apparel, 
775.505	maybe shoes -- it has gone beyond.
783.271	My anger at the age of 11,
784.823	when I realized how important
784.823	education is for every child,
790.176	I got an idea to collect used books
790.176	and help the poorest children.
797.821	I created a book bank at the age of 11.
802.57	But I did not stop.
803.813	Later on, I cofounded
806.046	the world's single largest civil society
806.046	campaign for education
810.58	that is the Global Campaign for Education.
814.221	That has helped in changing 
814.221	the whole thinking towards education
818.866	from the charity mode
818.866	to the human rights mode,
821.257	and that has concretely helped 
821.257	the reduction of out-of-school children
826.026	by half in the last 15 years.
829.614	(Applause)
835.753	My anger at the age of 27,
838.867	to free that girl who was about
838.867	to be sold to a brothel,
844.235	has given me an idea
849.018	to go for a new strategy
849.018	of raid and rescue,
853.271	freeing children from slavery.
856.758	And I am so lucky and proud to say
856.758	that it is not one or 10 or 20,
862.614	but my colleagues and I have been able
862.614	to physically liberate 83,000 child slaves
868.962	and hand them over
868.962	back to their families and mothers.
872.093	(Applause)
877.692	I knew that we needed global policies.
879.979	We organized the worldwide marches
879.979	against child labor
883.011	and that has also resulted in 
883.011	a new international convention
889.073	to protect the children
889.073	who are in the worst forms.
894.262	And the concrete result was that
894.262	the number of child laborers globally
898.351	has gone down by one third 
898.351	in the last 15 years.
903.891	(Applause)
908.311	So, in each case,
911.721	it began from anger,
915.51	turned into an idea,
918.159	and action.
921.565	So anger, what next?
924.441	Idea, and --
926.92	Audience: Action
928.278	Kailash Satyarthi: Anger, idea, action.
928.278	Which I tried to do.
934.254	Anger is a power, anger is an energy,
936.751	and the law of nature is that energy
939.552	can never be created and never 
939.552	be vanished, can never be destroyed.
944.795	So why can't the energy of anger
944.795	be translated and harnessed
951.685	to create a better and beautiful world,
951.685	a more just and equitable world?
956.861	Anger is within each one of you,
959.341	and I will share a secret
959.341	for a few seconds:
965.241	that if we are confined in 
965.241	the narrow shells of egos,
972.795	and the circles of selfishness,
977.225	then the anger will turn out to be
977.225	hatred, violence, revenge, destruction.
985.539	But if we are able to break the circles,
988.595	then the same anger could turn 
988.595	into a great power.
994.481	We can break the circles 
994.481	by using our inherent compassion
998.828	and connect with the world through 
998.828	compassion to make this world better.
1002.678	That same anger could be
1002.678	transformed into it.
1006.351	So dear friends, sisters and brothers,
1006.351	again, as a Nobel Laureate,
1011.956	I am urging you to become angry.
1015.841	I am urging you to become angry.
1020.003	And the angriest among us
1024.299	is the one who can transform his anger 
1024.299	into idea and action.
1032.44	Thank you so much.
1034.275	(Applause)
1047.115	Chris Anderson: For many years, 
1047.115	you've been an inspiration to others.
1050.924	Who or what inspires you and why?
1054.629	KS: Good question.
1056.341	Chris, let me tell you, 
1056.341	and that is the truth,
1060.335	each time when I free a child,
1064.849	the child who has lost all his hope
1064.849	that he will ever come back to his mother,
1069.028	the first smile of freedom,
1073.335	and the mother who has lost all hope
1075.89	that the son or daughter 
1075.89	can ever come back and sit in her lap,
1082.501	they become so emotional
1084.656	and the first tear of joy 
1084.656	rolls down on her cheek,
1089.809	I see the glimpse of God in it --
1089.809	this is my biggest inspiration.
1093.154	And I am so lucky that not once,
1093.154	as I said before, but thousands of times,
1098.032	I have been able to witness my God
1098.032	in the faces of those children
1101.628	and they are my biggest inspirations.
1103.64	Thank you.
1105.652	(Applause)
