13.52	Hannah is excited to be going to college.
16.96	She couldn't wait
16.96	to get out of her parents' house,
19.76	to prove to them that she's an adult,
21.8	and to prove to her new friends
21.8	that she belongs.
25.36	She heads to a campus party
26.96	where she sees a guy
26.96	that she has a crush on.
29.52	Let's call him Mike.
32.44	The next day, Hannah wakes up
32.44	with a pounding headache.
37.28	She can only remember
37.28	the night in flashes.
40.48	But what she does remember is
42.2	throwing up in the hall
42.2	outside Mike's room
46.44	and staring at the wall silently
46.44	while he was inside her,
49.56	wanting it to stop,
51.52	then shakily stumbling home.
54.856	She doesn't feel good about what happened,
56.88	"but she thinks, ""Maybe this is just"
56.88	"what sex in college is?"""
61.84	One in five women and one in 13 men
61.84	will be sexually assaulted
66.08	at some point during their college career
66.08	in the United States.
71.52	Less than 10 percent will ever report
71.52	their assault to their school
75.96	or to the police.
77.48	And those who do, on average,
77.48	wait 11 months to make the report.
84.04	Hannah initially just feels like dealing
84.04	with what happened on her own.
87.76	But when she sees Mike
87.76	taking girls home from parties,
90.36	she's worried about them.
92.6	After graduation, Hannah learns
94.88	that she was one of five women
94.88	who Mike did the exact same thing to.
100.84	And this is not an unlikely scenario
103.28	because 90 percent of sexual assaults
106.36	are committed by repeat offenders.
109.16	But with such low reporting rates,
110.84	it's fairly unlikely that even
110.84	repeat perpetrators will be reported,
114.68	much less anything happen if they are.
117.24	In fact, only six percent
117.24	of assaults reported to the police
122.4	end with the assailant
122.4	spending a single day in prison.
125.68	Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance
125.68	that they'll get away with it.
131.4	This means there's practically
131.4	no deterrent to assault
134.84	in the United States.
138.16	Now, I'm an infectious disease
138.16	epidemiologist by training.
141.52	I'm interested in systems and networks
144.64	and where we can concentrate
144.64	our resources to do the most good.
149.2	So this, to me, is a tragic
149.2	but a solvable problem.
155.28	So when the issue of campus assault
155.28	started hitting the news a few years ago,
159.44	it felt like a unique opportunity
159.44	to make a change.
162.84	And so we did.
164.56	We started by talking
164.56	to college survivors.
167.36	And what they wish they'd had
167.36	in college is pretty simple;
170.88	they wanted a website,
172.44	one they could use
172.44	at the time and place
174.6	that felt safest to them
176.8	with clearly written information
176.8	about their reporting options,
180.8	with the ability to electronically
180.8	report their assault,
183.96	rather than having the first step
185.6	to go in and talk to someone
185.6	who may or may not believe them.
189.08	With the option to create
189.08	a secure, timestamped document
192.4	of what happened to them,
193.92	preserving evidence
193.92	even if they don't want to report yet.
197.56	And lastly, and perhaps most critically,
200.56	with the ability to report their assault
202.6	only if someone else
202.6	reported the same assailant.
206.92	You see, knowing that you weren't
206.92	the only one changes everything.
210.08	It changes the way
210.08	you frame your own experience,
212.44	it changes the way
212.44	you think about your perpetrator,
214.92	it means that if you do come forward,
216.76	you'll have someone else's back
216.76	and they'll have yours.
220.84	We created a website
220.84	that actually does this
223.36	and we launched it [...] in August,
226.4	on two college campuses.
228.6	And we included a unique matching system
231.52	where if Mike's first victim
231.52	had come forward,
234.48	saved her record,
234.48	entered into the matching system
237.28	and named Mike,
238.56	and Mike's second victim
238.56	had done the same thing
240.96	a few months later,
242.64	they would have matched
244	and the verified contact information
244	of both survivors
247.52	would have been sent
247.52	to the authorities at the same time
250.28	for investigation and follow up.
253.6	If a system like this had existed
253.6	for Hannah and her peers,
257.32	it's more likely
257.32	that they would have reported,
259.88	that they would have been believed,
261.68	and that Mike would have been
261.68	kicked off campus,
263.96	gone to jail, or at least
263.96	gotten the help that he needed.
267.92	And if we were able to stop
267.92	repeat offenders like Mike
271.44	after just their second assault
271.44	following a match,
275.08	survivors like Hannah
275.08	would never even be assaulted
277.72	in the first place.
279.76	We could prevent
283.88	just by stopping
283.88	repeat perpetrators earlier on.
288.08	And because we're creating
288.08	a real deterrent to assault,
290.8	for perhaps the first time,
292.96	maybe the Mikes of the world
292.96	would never even try to assault anyone.
298.64	The type of system I'm describing,
300.64	the type of system that survivors want
303.04	is a type of information escrow,
305.6	meaning an entity that holds on
305.6	to information for you
308.84	and only releases it to a third party
311.32	when certain pre-agreed upon
311.32	conditions are met,
313.92	such as a match.
315.6	The application that we built
315.6	is for college campuses.
319.36	But the same type of system
319.36	could be used in the military
322.44	or even the workplace.
325.72	We don't have to live in a world
328.28	where 99 percent of rapists
328.28	get away with it.
332.12	We can create one
333.56	where those who do wrong
333.56	are held accountable,
336.52	where survivors get the support
336.52	and justice they deserve,
339.96	where the authorities
339.96	get the information they need,
342.88	and where there's a real deterrent
344.8	to violating the rights
344.8	of another human being.
349.12	Thank you.
350.36	(Applause)
