12.302	I wanted to just start
12.302	by asking everyone a question:
15.137	How many of you are completely comfortable
17.207	with calling yourselves a leader?
20.294	I've asked that question
20.294	all across the country,
22.582	and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,
24.583	there's a huge portion of the audience
24.583	that won't put up their hand.
28.14	And I've come to realize
28.14	that we have made leadership
30.66	into something bigger than us;
30.66	something beyond us.
33.094	We've made it about changing the world.
34.991	"We've taken this title of ""leader"""
36.65	and treat it as something
36.65	that one day we're going to deserve.
39.602	But to give it to ourselves right now
41.413	means a level of arrogance or cockiness
41.413	that we're not comfortable with.
44.872	And I worry sometimes
44.872	that we spend so much time
47.419	celebrating amazing things
47.419	that hardly anybody can do,
50.276	that we've convinced ourselves those
50.276	are the only things worth celebrating.
53.85	We start to devalue the things
53.85	we can do every day,
56.281	We take moments
56.281	where we truly are a leader
58.461	and we don't let ourselves take credit
58.461	for it, or feel good about it.
61.992	I've been lucky enough
61.992	over the last 10 years
64.117	to work with amazing people
64.117	who've helped me redefine leadership
67.172	in a way that I think has made me happier.
69.22	With my short time today,
70.458	I want to share with you the one story
70.458	that is probably most responsible
74.153	for that redefinition.
75.34	I went to a little school
77.333	called Mount Allison University
77.333	in Sackville, New Brunswick.
80.171	And on my last day there,
80.171	a girl came up to me and said,
82.854	"""I remember the first time I met you."""
85.02	And she told me a story
85.02	that had happened four years earlier.
88.17	"She said, ""On the day"
88.17	before I started university,
90.529	I was in the hotel room
90.529	with my mom and dad,
92.617	and I was so scared
92.617	and so convinced that I couldn't do this,
95.511	that I wasn't ready for university,
95.511	that I just burst into tears.
98.595	My mom and dad were amazing.
99.96	"They were like, ""We know you're scared,"
99.96	but let's just go tomorrow,
103.146	go to the first day, and if at any point
103.146	you feel as if you can't do this,
106.655	that's fine; tell us,
106.655	and we'll take you home.
108.838	"We love you no matter what.'"""
110.259	"She says, ""So I went the next day."
111.91	I was in line for registration,
113.418	and I looked around and just knew
113.418	I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.
116.746	I knew I had to quit.
117.921	I made that decision
117.921	and as soon as I made it,
120.096	an incredible feeling
120.096	of peace came over me.
122.192	I turned to my mom and dad
122.192	to tell them we needed to go home,
125.294	and at that moment, you came
125.294	out of the student union building
128.231	wearing the stupidest hat
128.231	"I've ever seen in my life."""
130.746	(Laughter)
131.771	"""It was awesome."
133.046	And you had a big sign
133.046	"promoting Shinerama,"" --"
135.275	which is Students Fighting
135.275	Cystic Fibrosis,
137.328	a charity I've worked with for years --
139.217	"""And you had a bucketful of lollipops."
141.061	You were handing the lollipops out
141.061	to people in line,
143.588	and talking about Shinerama.
144.955	All of the sudden, you got to me,
144.955	and you just stopped.
148.121	"And you stared. It was creepy."""
150.286	(Laughter)
151.761	This girl knows what I'm talking about.
153.716	(Laughter)
154.742	"""Then you looked at the guy next to me,"
154.742	smiled, reached into your bucket,
158.398	pulled out a lollipop,
158.398	held it out to him and said,
160.878	'You need to give a lollipop
160.878	"to the beautiful woman next to you.'"""
164.044	"She said, ""I've never seen anyone"
164.044	get more embarrassed faster in my life.
168.008	He turned beet red,
168.008	he wouldn't even look at me.
170.282	He just kind of held
170.282	"the lollipop out like this."""
172.651	(Laughter)
173.976	"""I felt so bad for this dude"
173.976	that I took the lollipop.
176.573	As soon as I did, you got
176.573	this incredibly severe look on your face,
179.788	looked at my mom and dad
179.788	and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!
183.096	First day away from home,
184.518	and already she's taking candy
184.518	"from a stranger?'"""
187.049	(Laughter)
189.216	"She said, ""Everybody lost it."
190.641	Twenty feet in every direction,
190.641	everyone started to howl.
193.348	I know this is cheesy, and I don't know
193.348	why I'm telling you this,
196.487	but in that moment when everyone
196.487	was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.
199.933	I knew I was where I was supposed
199.933	to be; I knew I was home.
202.789	And I haven't spoken to you
202.789	once in the four years since that day.
206.146	But I heard that you were leaving,
206.146	and I had to come and tell you
209.252	you've been an incredibly
209.252	important person in my life.
211.853	"I'm going to miss you. Good luck."""
213.676	And she walks away, and I'm flattened.
215.75	She gets six feet away,
215.75	turns around, smiles and goes,
218.355	"""You should probably know this, too:"
220.122	I'm still dating that guy,
220.122	"four years later."""
222.329	(Laughter)
223.498	A year and a half
223.498	after I moved to Toronto,
226.004	I got an invitation to their wedding.
227.905	(Laughter)
228.936	Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.
231.96	I have no recollection of that moment.
233.869	I've searched my memory banks,
235.339	because that is funny and I should
235.339	remember doing it and I don't.
238.534	That was such an eye-opening,
238.534	transformative moment for me,
241.341	to think that maybe the biggest impact
241.341	I'd ever had on anyone's life,
244.658	a moment that had a woman walk up
244.658	to a stranger four years later and say,
248.171	"""You've been an important"
248.171	"person in my life,"""
250.351	was a moment that I didn't even remember.
252.401	How many of you guys
252.401	have a lollipop moment,
254.484	a moment where someone
254.484	said or did something
256.578	that you feel fundamentally
256.578	made your life better?
259.09	All right. How many of you have told
259.09	that person they did it?
262.493	See, why not?
263.668	We celebrate birthdays,
264.843	where all you have to do
264.843	is not die for 365 days --
267.538	(Laughter)
268.719	Yet we let people
268.719	who have made our lives better
271.032	walk around without knowing it.
272.54	Every single one of you
272.54	has been the catalyst
275.079	for a lollipop moment.
276.254	You've made someone's life better
276.254	by something you said or did.
279.295	If you think you haven't,
280.514	think of all the hands
280.514	that didn't go up when I asked.
283.07	You're just one of the people
283.07	who hasn't been told.
285.483	It's scary to think of ourselves
285.483	as that powerful,
287.843	frightening to think we can matter
287.843	that much to other people.
290.755	As long as we make leadership
290.755	something bigger than us,
293.446	as long as we keep leadership beyond us
295.386	and make it about changing the world,
297.182	we give ourselves an excuse
297.182	not to expect it every day,
299.793	from ourselves and from each other.
301.726	"Marianne Williamson said, ""Our greatest"
301.726	fear is not that we are inadequate.
305.333	[It] is that we are powerful
305.333	beyond measure.
307.424	It is our light and not our darkness
307.424	"that frightens us."""
310.101	My call to action today
310.101	is that we need to get over our fear
313.317	of how extraordinarily powerful
313.317	we can be in each other's lives.
316.343	We need to get over it
316.343	so we can move beyond it,
318.621	and our little brothers and sisters
318.621	and one day our kids --
321.415	or our kids right now --
321.415	can watch and start to value
323.922	the impact we can have
323.922	on each other's lives,
326.096	more than money and power
326.096	and titles and influence.
328.706	We need to redefine leadership
328.706	as being about lollipop moments --
331.872	how many of them we create,
331.872	how many we acknowledge,
334.426	how many of them we pay forward
334.426	and how many we say thank you for.
337.637	Because we've made leadership
337.637	about changing the world,
340.281	and there is no world.
341.465	There's only six billion
341.465	understandings of it.
343.648	And if you change
343.648	one person's understanding of it,
346.087	understanding of what they're capable of,
348.14	understanding of how much
348.14	people care about them,
350.473	understanding of how powerful
350.473	an agent for change
353.099	they can be in this world,
354.497	you've changed the whole thing.
356.016	And if we can understand
356.016	leadership like that,
358.563	I think if we can redefine
358.563	leadership like that,
361.098	I think we can change everything.
362.971	And it's a simple idea,
362.971	but I don't think it's a small one.
365.765	I want to thank you so much
365.765	for letting me share it with you today.
