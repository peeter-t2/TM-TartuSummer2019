26	When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.
29	You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
32	who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
35	and, of course, with technology it never is.
37	So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
41	I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
43	with such an incredible last half a dozen years,
47	that it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.
50	A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things
54	and what we're supposed to expect about the future
56	depends on how we bucket things
58	and how we categorize them.
59	And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
63	that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
67	It's easy to think of this analogy as very different
70	from some of the other things you might pick.
72	For one thing, both were very real.
74	In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
78	worth of gold out of California. It was very real.
80	The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to
84	communicate with each other. It's a big deal.
87	Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
91	You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.
94	I don't have to remind you of all the hype
97	that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com.
100	"But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. ""Gold. Gold. Gold."""
103	Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
107	Some have 5,000. Many have more.
110	A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
114	People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
117	"""The Eldorado of the United States of America:"
120	"the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."""
126	And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
130	So many people left what they were doing.
133	And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.
136	People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,
140	"they thought, ""Ah, this isn't real."""
142	But they keep hearing about people getting rich,
145	and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.
148	"By about 1852, they're thinking, ""Am I the stupidest person on Earth"
153	"by not rushing to California?"" And they start to decide they are."
157	These are community affairs, by the way.
159	Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
162	of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
165	and they would form companies.
167	These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,
170	if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,
173	no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.
177	This guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,
180	he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.
183	They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,
186	and then take another ship north.
188	This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.
193	This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.
197	These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,
199	a surgeon in the other.
200	Same thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.
204	(Laughter)
205	In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
208	The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
215	because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
217	to go search for gold.
219	So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.
223	They turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.
226	You had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.
231	And you saw some of the excesses
233	that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
237	The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.
241	Half of them deserted to go look for gold.
245	And they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half
248	because they were afraid they wouldn't come back.
250	(Laughter)
252	And one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:
255	"""The struggle between right and six dollars a month"
259	"and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."""
267	They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.
271	This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.
275	They loaded up their mules and their horses.
279	And they didn't plan right.
283	And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,
286	and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.
290	In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died
294	before they could get where they were going.
296	"It got renamed the ""Dead Horse Trail."""
298	And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:
302	"""Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,"
305	sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,
307	with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,
311	sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes
314	and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,
317	often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,
321	a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
324	turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
327	The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere
329	account for the myriads of ravens along the road.
332	The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,
334	the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,
337	"cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."""
342	And you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,
347	we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.
352	I'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.
355	This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.
359	(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.
363	Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?
366	Announcer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.
371	Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?
375	Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.
383	OurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.
386	Jeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.
390	(Laughter)
393	But they spent three and a half million dollars
395	in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,
398	even though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.
404	Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,
408	and I think rather severely.
410	And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.
414	"Here's this guy: ""There are many men in Dawson"
417	at the present time who feel keenly disappointed.
419	They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,
424	spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform
427	and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch
430	have reached the coveted goal only to discover
432	"the fact that there is nothing here for them."""
436	And that was, of course, the very common story.
439	Because when you take out that last piece of gold --
441	and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --
446	the entire American river region, within two years --
449	every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies
453	who used more sophisticated mining technologies
455	started to take gold out of there.
458	So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
464	and that analogy is the electric industry.
469	And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
473	With the electric industry you actually have to --
476	one of them is that they're both sort of thin,
478	horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
481	It's not a specific thing.
485	But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
490	You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
494	It's an incredible means of coordinating,
496	in a very fine-grained way, information flows.
498	There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
501	And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
506	is sort of the golden age of appliances.
509	The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.
514	So the light bulb is what wired the world.
516	And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
520	They were really thinking about --
522	they weren't putting electricity into the home;
524	they were putting lighting into the home.
527	And, but it really -- it got the electricity. It took a long time.
531	This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out.
535	All the streets had to be torn up.
538	This is work going on down in lower Manhattan
542	where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
546	And they're tearing up all the streets.
548	The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
551	which became General Electric,
553	paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
559	But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.
566	Because, remember, the Web got to stand
568	on top of all this heavy infrastructure
570	that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
573	So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --
576	I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
580	when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
582	How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
585	when people weren't really investing in the Web?
588	Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.
592	So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,
595	and then home appliances started coming into being.
598	And this was huge. The first one was the electric fan --
601	this was the 1890 electric fan.
604	And the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted --
608	it depends how you want to measure it --
610	but it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.
613	It starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.
619	The electric iron, also very big.
622	By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.
626	(Laughter)
627	There's asbestos under that handle there.
632	This is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,
635	from the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds
640	and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.
645	So it wasn't a big seller.
647	This was truly, truly an early-adopter product --
651	(Laughter)
652	the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.
654	But three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.
659	Now, not all these things were highly successful.
663	(Laughter)
665	This is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.
668	People, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.
675	These never really caught on either:
677	the electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.
681	This came in, like, six different colors.
683	(Laughter)
685	I don't know why. But I thought, you know,
688	sometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;
692	maybe it's time to give this one another shot.
695	So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.
699	We'd need the right partner. And I thought that really --
703	(Laughter)
705	I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.
709	Now, the toaster was huge
711	because they used to make toast on open fires,
714	and it took a lot of time and attention.
716	I want to point out one thing. This is -- you guys know what this is.
722	They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.
725	So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.
728	They wired them for lighting. So your -- your appliances would plug in.
732	They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.
735	And you'd plug it in there.
737	In fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,
740	you've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.
744	All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb
748	if you wanted to plug in an appliance.
750	The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
755	Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.
758	Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
761	On the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.
763	And there's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning.
765	And it would clean your clothes.
767	This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,
770	put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.
774	And this was a big deal.
776	You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
780	And you'd run a long cord into the house
783	where you could screw it into your light socket.
786	(Laughter)
787	And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,
790	because they hadn't invented the off switch.
794	That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances --
797	because it didn't make any sense.
799	I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
802	So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
805	That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
807	And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,
811	so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.
814	And there are --
816	when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions
819	of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.
824	And they couldn't yank the cord out
826	because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.
830	(Laughter)
831	And there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.
836	And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors
840	to be plugging things into a light socket like this.
843	But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,
847	I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.
850	This is a total kludge, if you ask me.
853	First of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket --
856	(Laughter)
857	and so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.
859	(Laughter)
861	This is supposed -- don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.
865	This is what it looks like under my desk.
867	I took this picture just two days ago.
870	So we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.
873	(Laughter)
875	It's a total, total mess.
877	And, you know, we think it's getting better,
880	but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?
884	(Laughter)
885	I challenge you to try. It's very hard.
887	I know Ph.D.s in Computer Science --
890	this process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)
894	And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.
900	Try to get DSL installed in your house.
903	The engineers who do it everyday can't do it.
905	They have to -- typically, they come three times.
908	And one friend of mine was telling me a story:
910	not only did they get there and have to wait,
913	but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,
916	for the third time, they had to call somebody.
918	And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone
921	because then they had to wait on hold for an hour
923	to talk to somebody to give them an access code
925	after they got there.
927	So we're not -- we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.
931	By the way, DSL is a kludge.
933	I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed
935	for the purpose it's being put to --
937	you know it's the whole thing --
939	we're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.
943	Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,
947	then you'd be pretty depressed right now
949	because the last nugget of gold would be gone.
952	But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.
955	Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.
960	And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are --
964	this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge --
968	and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --
972	but there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff --
975	we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.
979	That's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,
982	but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.
985	We're in 1908.
987	And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:
991	"""All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."""
1001	My mom hates this picture.
1003	(Laughter)
1007	She -- but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,
1010	very beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,
1014	then you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.
1017	And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us
1020	than there is behind us.
1022	And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.
1027	This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.
1031	"It says: ""Use your electricity for more than light."""
1034	And I think that's where we are.
1036	We're very, very early. Thank you very much.
