13.063	It was April 8, 2003.
17.856	I was in Baghdad,
17.856	covering the war in Iraq.
22.405	That day, Americans tanks
22.405	started arriving in Baghdad.
28.039	We were just a few journalists
28.039	in the Palestine Hotel,
35.435	and, as happens in war,
37.882	the fighting began to approach
37.882	outside our windows.
42.327	Baghdad was covered
42.327	in black smoke and oil.
46.955	It smelled awful.
48.137	We couldn't see a thing,
48.137	but we knew what was happening.
50.852	Of course, I was supposed
50.852	to be writing an article,
53.366	but that's how it always goes --
54.926	you're supposed to be writing
54.926	and something big happens.
57.588	So I was in my room on the 16th floor,
60.339	writing and looking out the window
60.339	every now and then
63.245	to see what was happening.
65.053	Suddenly, there was a huge explosion.
67.547	During the previous three weeks,
69.507	there had been shelling
69.507	with half-ton missiles,
73.65	but this time, the shock --
76.728	I felt it inside of me,
79.249	"and I thought, ""It's very close."
81.274	"It's very, very close."""
83.296	So I went down to see what was happening.
85.7	I went down to the 15th floor
89.671	to take a look.
91.043	And I saw people, journalists,
91.043	screaming in the hallways.
94.67	I walked into a room
96.925	and realized that it had
96.925	been hit by a missile.
102.169	Someone had been wounded.
105.304	There was a man near the window,
107.396	a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk,
112.245	lying face-down.
118.796	Having worked in a hospital before,
118.796	I wanted to help out.
122.996	So I turned him over.
124.521	And when I turned him over,
128.334	I noticed that he was open
128.334	from sternum to pubis,
131.509	but I couldn't see anything,
131.509	nothing at all.
134.467	All I saw was a white, pearly,
134.467	shiny spot that blinded me,
141.245	and I didn't understand what was going on.
143.879	Once the spot disappeared
143.879	and I could see his wound,
146.555	which was very serious,
148.156	my buddies and I put a sheet
148.156	underneath him,
150.275	and we carried him onto an elevator
150.275	that stopped at each of the 15 floors.
154.616	We put him in a car
154.616	that took him to the hospital.
156.984	He died on the way to the hospital.
158.77	The Spanish cameraman Jos√© Couso,
158.77	who was on the 14th floor and also hit --
163.784	because the shell had exploded
163.784	between the two floors --
167.118	died on the operating table.
169.078	As soon as the car left, I went back.
171.499	There was that article
171.499	I was supposed to write --
173.856	which I had to write.
176.117	And so --
177.87	I returned to the hotel lobby
177.87	with my arms covered in blood,
184.792	when one of the hotel gofers stopped me
187.356	and asked me to pay the tax
187.356	I hadn't paid for 10 days.
191.227	I told him to get lost.
193.059	And I said to myself:
193.059	"""Clear your head, put it all aside."
199.097	If you want to write,
199.097	"you need to put it all aside."""
201.57	And that's what I did.
202.809	I went upstairs, wrote
202.809	my article and sent it off.
207.077	Later, aside from the feeling
207.077	of having lost my colleagues,
211.895	something else was bothering me.
214.442	I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot,
220.735	and I couldn't understand what it meant.
223.731	And then, the war was over.
228.572	"Later, I thought: ""That's not possible."
228.572	"I can't just not know what happened."""
234.692	Because it wasn't the first time,
234.692	and it didn't only happen to me.
238.177	I have seen things like that
238.177	happen to others
242.106	in my 20 to 35 years of reporting.
244.798	I have seen things
244.798	that had an effect on me too.
248.108	For example, there was this man
248.108	I knew in Lebanon,
251.177	a 25-year-old veteran
251.177	who had been fighting for five years --
254.107	a real veteran -- who we would
254.107	follow everywhere.
256.474	He would crawl in the dark
256.474	with confidence --
260.731	he was a great soldier, a true soldier --
263.167	so we would follow him,
263.167	knowing that we would be safe with him.
266.548	And one day, as I was told --
268.88	and I've seen him again since --
270.5	he was back in the camp, playing cards,
272.865	when someone came in next door,
276.158	and discharged their weapon.
278.318	As the gun went off,
279.85	that blast, that one shot,
279.85	made him duck quickly under the table,
286.204	like a child.
287.442	He was shaking, panicking.
289.357	And since then, he has never
289.357	been able to get up and fight.
294.189	He ended up working as a croupier
296.905	in a Beirut casino
296.905	where I later found him,
299.051	because he couldn't sleep,
299.051	so it was quite a suitable job.
302.378	So I thought to myself,
304.957	"""What is this thing that can kill you"
308.035	without leaving
308.035	any visible scars?
312.974	How does that happen?
316.04	"What is this unknown thing?"""
319.206	It was too common to be coincidental.
323.597	So I started to investigate --
325.279	that's all I know how to do.
327.297	I started to investigate
329.164	by looking through books,
332.836	reaching out to psychiatrists,
335.202	going to museums, libraries, etc.
338.224	Finally, I discovered
338.224	that some people knew about this --
342.95	often military psychiatrists --
344.904	and that what we were dealing with
344.904	was called trauma.
349.817	Americans call it PTSD
349.817	or traumatic neurosis.
354.667	It was something
358.262	that existed,
360.206	but that we never spoke about.
364.206	So, this trauma --
366.452	what is it?
367.633	Well, it's an encounter with death.
371.126	I don't know if you've ever had
371.126	an experience with death --
373.952	I'm not talking about dead bodies,
375.859	or someone's grandfather
375.859	lying in a hospital bed,
379.484	or someone who got hit by a car.
384.134	I'm talking about facing
384.134	the void of death.
389.688	And that is something
389.688	no one is supposed to see.
395.885	People used to say,
397.751	"""Neither the sun, nor death"
397.751	"can be looked at with a steady eye."""
401.75	A human being should not
401.75	have to face the void of death.
406.008	But when that happens,
409.801	it can remain invisible for a while --
413.573	days, weeks, months, sometimes years.
416.365	And then, at some point,
419.587	it explodes,
420.897	because it's something
420.897	that has entered your brain --
424.665	a sort of window between an image
424.665	and your mind --
429.34	that has penetrated your brain,
431.689	staying there and taking up
431.689	all the space inside.
437.541	And there are people --
437.541	men, women,
440.858	who suddenly no longer sleep.
444.376	And they experience
444.376	horrible anxiety attacks --
446.745	panic attacks, not just minor fears.
449.799	They suddenly don't want to sleep,
452.129	because when they do, they have
452.129	the same nightmare every night.
456.687	They see the same image every night.
458.631	What type of image?
460.282	For example, a soldier
460.282	who enters a building
463.109	and comes face to face
463.109	with another soldier aiming at him.
465.967	He looks at the gun,
465.967	straight down the barrel.
468.554	And this barrel suddenly
468.554	becomes enormous, deformed.
472.162	It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything.
474.94	And he says --
478.376	"later he will say, ""I saw death."
480.742	"I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead."""
483.267	And from then on, he knows he is dead.
487.148	It is not a perception --
487.148	he is convinced that he is dead.
492.057	In reality, someone came in,
492.057	the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever,
495.613	and he didn't actually get shot --
497.284	but to him, he died in that moment.
499.016	Or it can be the smell
499.016	of a mass grave --
501.147	I saw a lot of that in Rwanda.
503.51	It can be the voice of a friend calling,
507.113	and they're being slaughtered
507.113	and there's nothing you can do.
510.897	You hear that voice,
512.127	and you wake up every night --
512.127	for weeks, months --
517.657	in a trance-like state,
517.657	anxious and terrified,
520.438	like a child.
521.817	I have seen men cry --
524.652	just like children --
526.442	from seeing the same image.
528.162	So having that image
528.162	of horror in your brain,
534.659	seeing the void of death --
536.521	that analogue of horror
536.521	which is hiding something --
540.25	will completely take over.
541.528	You cannot do anything, anything at all.
543.859	You cannot work anymore,
545.177	you cannot love anymore.
546.484	You go home and don't recognize anyone.
548.435	You don't even recognize yourself.
553.181	You hide and don't leave the house,
553.181	you lock yourself in, you become ill.
556.729	I know people who placed small cans
556.729	outside their house with coins inside,
561.167	in case someone tried to get in.
563.057	All of a sudden, you feel
563.057	like you want to die or kill
565.953	or hide or run away.
567.525	You want to be loved,
567.525	but you hate everyone.
569.7	It's a feeling that seizes you entirely
574.644	day in and day out,
576.399	and you suffer tremendously.
581.351	And no one understands.
582.852	"They say, ""There's nothing wrong with you."
582.852	You seem fine, you have no injuries.
586.644	"You went to war, came back; you're fine."""
590.231	These people suffer tremendously.
592.137	Some commit suicide.
594.035	After all, suicide is like updating
594.035	your daily planner --
596.773	I'm already dead,
596.773	I might as well commit suicide.
599.108	Plus, there is no more pain.
601.067	Some commit suicide,
601.067	others end up under the bridge, drinking.
605.121	Everyone remembers
605.121	that grandfather or uncle or neighbor
609.517	who used to drink, never said a word,
611.511	always in a bad mood, beat his wife
613.304	and who would end up either sinking
613.304	into alcoholism or dying.
617.457	And why do we not talk about this?
620.261	We don't talk about it because it's taboo.
624.157	It's not like we don't have the words
624.157	to express the void of death.
627.948	But others don't want hear it.
629.74	The first time I returned
629.74	from an assignment,
631.878	"They said, ""Oh! He's back."""
633.428	There was a fancy dinner --
633.428	white tablecloth, candles, guests.
636.548	"""Tell us everything!"""
637.764	Which I did.
640.075	After 20 minutes, people
640.075	were giving me dirty looks,
642.583	the hostess had her nose in the ashtray.
644.612	It was horrible and I realized
644.612	I ruined the whole evening.
647.607	So I don't talk about it anymore.
649.54	We're just not ready to listen.
651.105	"People say outright: ""Please, stop."""
652.857	Is that a rare occurrence?
654.978	No, it's extremely common.
657.404	One third of the soldiers
657.404	who died in Iraq --
659.581	"well, not ""died,"" let me re-phrase that --"
662.127	one third of the US soldiers
662.127	who went to Iraq
665.291	suffer from PTSD.
666.953	In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers
666.953	from the First World War
672.898	that were being treated
672.898	in British psychiatric hospitals.
677.066	In Vietnam, 54,000 people died --
679.524	Americans.
680.891	In 1987, the US government
680.891	identified 102,000 --
685.088	twice as many --
	from committing suicide.
688.974	Twice as many deaths by suicide
688.974	than by combat in Vietnam.
691.814	So you see, this relates to everything,
694.996	not just modern warfare,
694.996	but also ancient wars --
697.359	you can read about it,
697.359	the evidence is there.
700.382	So why do we not talk about it?
702.651	Why have we not talked about it?
705.12	The problem is that
705.12	if you don't talk about it,
710.642	you're heading for disaster.
713.528	The only way to heal --
716.367	and the good news here
716.367	is that this is treatable --
720.829	think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc. --
722.924	it's indeed treatable.
724.233	The only way to heal from this trauma,
728.817	from this encounter with death
728.817	that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you
733.897	is to find a way to express it.
738.54	People used to say,
740.303	"""Language is the only thing"
740.303	"that holds all of us together."""
743.894	Without language, we're nothing.
746.259	It's the thing that makes us human.
748.9	In the face of such a horrible image --
750.901	a wordless image of oblivion
750.901	that obsesses us --
756.451	the only way to cope with it
760.109	is to put human words to it.
762.234	Because these people
762.234	feel excluded from humanity.
764.684	No one wants to see them anymore
764.684	and they don't want to see anyone.
767.914	They feel dirty, defiled, ashamed.
770.359	"Someone said, ""Doctor,"
770.359	I don't use the subway anymore
773.627	because I'm afraid people
773.627	"will see the horror in my eyes."""
776.865	Another guy thought he had
776.865	a terrible skin disease
779.755	and spent six months with dermatologists,
779.755	going from doctor to doctor.
783.616	And then one day, they sent him
783.616	to a psychiatrist.
786.179	During his second session,
786.179	he told the psychiatrist
788.608	he had a terrible skin disease
788.608	from head to toe.
790.962	The psychiatrist asked,
790.962	"""Why are you in this state?"""
793.905	"And the man said, ""Well, because"
793.905	"I'm dead, so I must be rotting away."""
797.255	So you see this is something
797.255	that has a profound effect on people.
801.692	In order to heal,
801.692	we need to talk about it.
804.125	The horror needs to be put into words --
808.093	human words, so we can organize it
808.093	and talk about it again.
812.3	We have to look death in the face.
817.061	And if we can do that,
817.061	if we can talk about these things,
822.18	then step by step,
822.18	by working it out verbally,
825.629	we can reclaim our place in humanity.
829.549	And it is important.
830.837	Silence kills us.
833.789	So what does this mean?
835.235	It means that after a trauma,
837.275	without question, we lose
837.275	"our ""unbearable lightness of being,"""
840.934	that sense of immortality
840.934	that keeps us here --
843.712	meaning, if we're here, we almost feel
843.712	like we're immortal, which we're not,
847.648	but if we didn't believe that,
847.648	"we'd say, ""What's the point of it all?"""
851.015	But trauma survivors have lost
851.015	that feeling of immortality.
853.829	They've lost their lightness.
855.248	But they have found something else.
857.011	So this means that if we manage
857.011	to look death in the face,
861.546	and actually confront it,
861.546	rather than keep quiet and hide,
866.472	like some of the men or women I know did,
868.975	such as Michael from Rwanda,
868.975	Carole from Iraq, Philippe from the Congo
875.653	and other people I know,
876.903	like Sorj Chalandon, now a great writer,
879.025	who gave up field assignments
879.025	after a trauma.
881.34	Five friends of mine committed suicide,
883.582	they're the ones
883.582	who did not survive the trauma.
886.182	So if we can look death in the face,
891.752	if we, mortal humans, human mortals,
894.554	understand that we are human
894.554	and mortal, mortal and human,
897.419	if we can confront death
897.419	and identify it once again
903.69	as the most mysterious place
903.69	of all mysterious places,
907.57	since no one has ever seen it --
910.15	if we can give it back this meaning,
912.837	yes, we may die,
917.686	survive
920.011	and come back to life,
921.462	but we'll come back stronger than before.
924.579	Much stronger.
925.913	Thank you.
927.091	(Applause)
