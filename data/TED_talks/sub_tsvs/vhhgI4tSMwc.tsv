12.939	When I was in my 20s,
14.484	I saw my very first psychotherapy client.
18.484	I was a Ph.D. student
18.484	in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
22.435	She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
26.284	Now Alex walked into her first session
26.284	wearing jeans and a big slouchy top,
30.953	and she dropped
30.953	onto the couch in my office
33.064	and kicked off her flats
34.757	and told me she was there
34.757	to talk about guy problems.
38.813	Now when I heard this, I was so relieved.
43.091	My classmate got an arsonist
43.091	for her first client.
46.116	(Laughter)
47.986	And I got a twentysomething
47.986	who wanted to talk about boys.
52.494	This I thought I could handle.
55.328	But I didn't handle it.
57.536	With the funny stories
57.536	that Alex would bring to session,
60.227	it was easy for me just to nod my head
62.226	while we kicked the can down the road.
64.416	"""Thirty's the new 20,"" Alex would say,"
66.696	and as far as I could tell, she was right.
69.726	Work happened later,
69.726	marriage happened later,
71.976	kids happened later,
71.976	even death happened later.
75.847	Twentysomethings like Alex and I
75.847	had nothing but time.
80.794	But before long, my supervisor pushed me
80.794	to push Alex about her love life.
86.414	I pushed back.
88.186	"I said, ""Sure, she's dating down,"
90.701	she's sleeping with a knucklehead,
93.036	but it's not like she's going
93.036	"to marry the guy."""
96.542	And then my supervisor said,
98.275	"""Not yet, but she might marry"
98.275	the next one.
102.644	Besides, the best time
102.644	to work on Alex's marriage
106.507	"is before she has one."""
110.359	That's what psychologists
110.359	"call an ""Aha!"" moment."
113.274	That was the moment I realized,
116.81	Yes, people settle down later
116.81	than they used to,
119.199	but that didn't make Alex's 20s
119.199	a developmental downtime.
123.598	That made Alex's 20s
123.598	a developmental sweet spot,
127.11	and we were sitting there, blowing it.
130.507	That was when I realized
130.507	that this sort of benign neglect
134.192	was a real problem,
134.192	and it had real consequences,
138.189	not just for Alex and her love life
140.603	but for the careers
140.603	and the families and the futures
143.754	of twentysomethings everywhere.
147.635	There are 50 million twentysomethings
147.635	in the United States right now.
151.923	We're talking about 15 percent
151.923	of the population,
155.73	or 100 percent if you consider
158.022	that no one's getting through adulthood
158.022	without going through their 20s first.
162.589	(Laughter)
163.712	Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
165.782	I really want to see
165.782	some twentysomethings here.
168.092	Oh, yay! You are all awesome.
169.621	If you work with twentysomethings,
169.621	you love a twentysomething,
173.566	you're losing sleep
173.566	over twentysomethings, I want to see —
176.434	Okay. Awesome,
176.434	twentysomethings really matter.
181.002	So, I specialize in twentysomethings
181.002	because I believe
184.613	that every single one of those
188.511	deserves to know what psychologists,
191.74	sociologists, neurologists
191.74	and fertility specialists
195.46	already know:
197.278	that claiming your 20s
197.278	is one of the simplest,
200.468	yet most transformative, things you can do
203.247	for work, for love, for your happiness,
205.942	maybe even for the world.
208.618	This is not my opinion.
210.477	These are the facts.
213.262	We know that 80 percent
213.262	of life's most defining moments
216.44	take place by age 35.
219.813	That means that eight out of 10
222.039	of the decisions and experiences
222.039	"and ""Aha!"" moments"
225.358	that make your life what it is
227.502	will have happened by your mid-30s.
230.872	People who are over 40, don't panic.
232.729	This crowd is going to be fine, I think.
235.799	We know that the first
238.164	has an exponential impact
238.164	on how much money you're going to earn.
242.796	We know that more than half of Americans
244.932	are married or are living with or dating
244.932	their future partner by 30.
249.999	We know that the brain caps off
251.746	its second and last
251.746	growth spurt in your 20s
254.77	as it rewires itself for adulthood,
257.64	which means that whatever it is you want
257.64	to change about yourself,
261.717	now is the time to change it.
264.536	We know that personality
264.536	changes more during your 20s
267.782	than at any other time in life,
270.488	and we know that female fertility
270.488	peaks at age 28,
274.354	and things get tricky after age 35.
278.01	So your 20s are the time
278.01	to educate yourself
280.862	about your body and your options.
284.749	So when we think about child development,
286.726	we all know that the first
286.726	five years are a critical period
290.691	for language and attachment in the brain.
294.292	It's a time when your ordinary,
294.292	day-to-day life
297.227	has an inordinate impact
297.227	on who you will become.
302.056	But what we hear less about
302.056	is that there's such a thing
304.795	as adult development,
305.976	and our 20s are that critical period
305.976	of adult development.
311.731	But this isn't what
311.731	twentysomethings are hearing.
314.829	Newspapers talk about the changing
314.829	timetable of adulthood.
319.131	Researchers call the 20s
319.131	an extended adolescence.
322.923	Journalists coin silly nicknames
322.923	for twentysomethings
325.573	"like ""twixters"" and ""kidults."""
328.605	(Laughing) It's true!
330.805	As a culture, we have trivialized
333.274	what is actually
333.274	the defining decade of adulthood.
339.613	Leonard Bernstein said
339.613	that to achieve great things,
342.115	you need a plan and not quite enough time.
346.07	(Laughing) Isn't that true?
348.327	So what do you think happens
349.933	when you pat a twentysomething
349.933	on the head and you say,
352.577	"""You have 10 extra years"
352.577	"to start your life""?"
356.013	Nothing happens.
358.07	You have robbed that person
358.07	of his urgency and ambition,
361.679	and absolutely nothing happens.
364.657	And then every day, smart,
364.657	interesting twentysomethings
368.269	like you or like your sons and daughters
371.527	come into my office
371.527	and say things like this:
376.448	"""I know my boyfriend's no good for me,"
378.29	but this relationship doesn't count.
378.29	"I'm just killing time."""
382.854	"Or they say, ""Everybody says"
382.854	as long as I get started
385.759	on a career by the time
385.759	"I'm 30, I'll be fine."""
389.438	But then it starts to sound like this:
392.697	"""My 20s are almost over,"
392.697	and I have nothing to show for myself.
396.578	I had a better résumé the day
396.578	"after I graduated from college."""
401.424	And then it starts to sound like this:
404.89	"""Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs."
406.976	Everybody was running around
406.976	and having fun,
409.845	but then sometime around 30
409.845	it was like the music turned off
412.725	and everybody started sitting down.
415.235	I didn't want to be
415.235	the only one left standing up,
417.608	so sometimes I think I married my husband
419.649	because he was the closest
419.649	"chair to me at 30."""
423.381	Where are the twentysomethings here?
425.198	Do not do that.
427.565	(Laughter)
429.418	Okay, now that sounds a little flip,
429.418	but make no mistake,
432.542	the stakes are very high.
435.121	When a lot has been pushed to your 30s,
437.185	there is enormous thirtysomething pressure
439.512	to jump-start a career,
439.512	pick a city, partner up,
443.282	and have two or three kids
443.282	in a much shorter period of time.
447.658	Many of these things are incompatible,
449.89	and as research is just starting to show,
452.463	simply harder and more stressful to do
452.463	all at once in our 30s.
458.828	The post-millennial midlife crisis
458.828	isn't buying a red sports car.
463.608	It's realizing you can't have
463.608	that career you now want.
468.482	It's realizing you can't have
468.482	that child you now want,
471.673	or you can't give your child a sibling.
475.339	Too many thirtysomethings
475.339	and fortysomethings
477.618	look at themselves, and at me,
477.618	sitting across the room,
481.644	and say about their 20s,
483.738	"""What was I doing? What was I thinking?"""
489.333	I want to change what twentysomethings
489.333	are doing and thinking.
493.131	Here's a story about how that can go.
495.35	It's a story about a woman named Emma.
499.61	At 25, Emma came to my office
501.898	because she was, in her words,
501.898	having an identity crisis.
507.192	She said she thought she might
507.192	like to work in art or entertainment,
510.606	but she hadn't decided yet,
512.191	so she'd spent the last few years
512.191	waiting tables instead.
517.118	Because it was cheaper,
517.118	she lived with a boyfriend
519.499	who displayed his temper
519.499	more than his ambition.
523.537	And as hard as her 20s were,
525.304	her early life had been even harder.
528.346	She often cried in our sessions,
530.236	but then would collect herself by saying,
532.461	"""You can't pick your family,"
532.461	"but you can pick your friends."""
537.145	Well one day, Emma comes in
537.145	and she hangs her head in her lap,
540.414	and she sobbed for most of the hour.
544.431	She'd just bought a new address book,
546.281	and she'd spent the morning
546.281	filling in her many contacts,
549.981	but then she'd been left
549.981	staring at that empty blank
552.615	that comes after the words
554.329	"""In case of emergency, please call ..."""
558.808	She was nearly hysterical
558.808	when she looked at me and said,
561.564	"""Who's going to be there for me"
561.564	if I get in a car wreck?
564.864	Who's going to take care of me
564.864	"if I have cancer?"""
569.118	Now in that moment,
569.118	it took everything I had
571.647	"not to say, ""I will."""
574.46	But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist
574.46	who really, really cared.
578.372	Emma needed a better life,
578.372	and I knew this was her chance.
583.761	I had learned too much
583.761	since I first worked with Alex
586.657	to just sit there
586.657	while Emma's defining decade
590.267	went parading by.
593.46	So over the next weeks and months,
595.127	I told Emma three things
597.674	that every twentysomething,
597.674	male or female,
600.833	deserves to hear.
603.984	First, I told Emma to forget
603.984	about having an identity crisis
608.006	and get some identity capital.
611.273	"By ""get identity capital,"""
612.947	I mean do something
612.947	that adds value to who you are.
617.305	Do something that's an investment
619.104	in who you might want to be next.
622.555	I didn't know the future of Emma's career,
624.93	and no one knows the future of work,
627.191	but I do know this:
628.884	Identity capital begets identity capital.
632.632	So now is the time
632.632	for that cross-country job,
635.414	that internship, that startup
635.414	you want to try.
638.924	I'm not discounting
638.924	twentysomething exploration here,
642.377	but I am discounting exploration
642.377	that's not supposed to count,
647.351	which, by the way, is not exploration.
649.986	That's procrastination.
652.66	I told Emma to explore
652.66	work and make it count.
658.676	Second, I told Emma
658.676	that the urban tribe is overrated.
663.915	Best friends are great
663.915	for giving rides to the airport,
666.89	but twentysomethings who huddle together
666.89	with like-minded peers
670.668	limit who they know,
672.173	what they know, how they think,
674.571	how they speak, and where they work.
678.181	That new piece of capital,
678.181	that new person to date
680.773	almost always comes
680.773	from outside the inner circle.
684.476	New things come
684.476	from what are called our weak ties,
687.998	our friends of friends of friends.
690.866	So yes, half of twentysomethings
690.866	are un- or under-employed.
695.731	But half aren't,
697.071	and weak ties are how
697.071	you get yourself into that group.
700.831	Half of new jobs are never posted,
703.424	so reaching out to your neighbor's boss
703.424	is how you get that unposted job.
708.462	It's not cheating. It's the science
708.462	of how information spreads.
713.433	Last but not least, Emma believed
715.449	that you can't pick your family,
715.449	but you can pick your friends.
719.338	Now this was true for her growing up,
721.208	but as a twentysomething,
721.208	soon Emma would pick her family
724.496	when she partnered with someone
724.496	and created a family of her own.
729.335	I told Emma the time
729.335	to start picking your family is now.
734.404	Now you may be thinking that 30
734.404	is actually a better time to settle down
738.57	than 20, or even 25,
741.721	and I agree with you.
743.674	But grabbing whoever you're living
743.674	with or sleeping with
746.627	when everyone on Facebook
746.627	starts walking down the aisle
749.738	is not progress.
752.994	The best time to work on your marriage
752.994	is before you have one,
756.508	and that means being
756.508	as intentional with love
759.315	as you are with work.
761.825	Picking your family
761.825	is about consciously choosing
764.376	who and what you want
766.65	rather than just making it work
766.65	or killing time
770.226	with whoever happens to be choosing you.
773.963	So what happened to Emma?
776.035	Well, we went through that address book,
778.249	and she found an old roommate's cousin
780.166	who worked at an art museum
780.166	in another state.
783.671	That weak tie helped her get a job there.
786.37	That job offer gave her the reason
786.37	to leave that live-in boyfriend.
791.216	Now, five years later, she's a special
791.216	events planner for museums.
795.022	She's married to a man
795.022	she mindfully chose.
798.399	She loves her new career,
798.399	she loves her new family,
801.475	and she sent me a card that said,
803.622	"""Now the emergency contact blanks"
805.634	"don't seem big enough."""
809.407	Now Emma's story made that sound easy,
811.702	but that's what I love about working
811.702	with twentysomethings.
814.536	They are so easy to help.
816.923	Twentysomethings are like airplanes
816.923	just leaving LAX,
820.573	bound for somewhere west.
823.479	Right after takeoff,
823.479	a slight change in course
826.237	is the difference between landing
826.237	in Alaska or Fiji.
831.678	Likewise, at 21 or 25 or even 29,
836.895	one good conversation, one good break,
839.697	one good TED Talk,
839.697	can have an enormous effect
843.004	across years and even generations to come.
847.762	So here's an idea worth spreading
849.612	to every twentysomething you know.
852.407	It's as simple as what I learned
852.407	to say to Alex.
855.062	It's what I now have the privilege
857.303	of saying to twentysomethings
857.303	like Emma every single day:
862.456	Thirty is not the new 20,
862.456	so claim your adulthood,
866.142	get some identity capital,
866.142	use your weak ties,
869.739	pick your family.
872.106	Don't be defined by what you didn't know
874.533	or didn't do.
876.102	You're deciding your life right now.
879.308	Thank you.
880.342	(Applause)
