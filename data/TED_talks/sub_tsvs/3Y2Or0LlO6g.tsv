16.379	You may have heard
16.379	about the Koran's idea of paradise
19.832	being 72 virgins,
22.135	and I promise I will come back
22.135	to those virgins.
25.112	But in fact, here in the Northwest,
25.112	we're living very close
28.09	to the real Koranic idea of paradise,
30.717	"defined 36 times as ""gardens"
30.717	"watered by running streams."""
37.16	Since I live on a houseboat
37.16	on the running stream of Lake Union,
41.421	this makes perfect sense to me.
43.667	But the thing is, how come
43.667	it's news to most people?
47.967	I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims
50.16	who've begun reading
50.16	the Koran, but given up,
52.851	"disconcerted by its ""otherness."""
56.172	The historian Thomas Carlyle
56.172	considered Muhammad
58.924	one of the world's greatest heroes,
60.924	yet even he called the Koran
63.36	"""as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;"
63.36	"a wearisome, confused jumble."""
68.75	(Laughter)
71.05	Part of the problem,
71.05	I think, is that we imagine
74.08	that the Koran can be read
74.08	as we usually read a book --
77.76	as though we can curl up
77.76	with it on a rainy afternoon
80.76	with a bowl of popcorn within reach,
82.76	as though God --
84.304	and the Koran is entirely in the voice
84.304	of God speaking to Muhammad --
88.07	were just another author
88.07	on the best-seller list.
92.935	Yet, the fact that so few people
92.935	do actually read the Koran
97.012	is precisely why it's so easy to quote --
97.012	that is, to misquote.
102.298	(Laughter)
103.346	Phrases and snippets taken out of context
105.76	"in what I call the ""highlighter version,"""
107.86	which is the one favored
107.86	by both Muslim fundamentalists
110.971	and anti-Muslim Islamophobes.
114.256	So this past spring,
116.106	as I was gearing up to begin writing
116.106	a biography of Muhammad,
120.192	I realized I needed to read
120.192	the Koran properly --
124.45	as properly as I could, that is.
127.236	My Arabic is reduced by now
127.236	to wielding a dictionary,
130.37	so I took four well-known translations
132.76	and decided to read them
132.76	side by side, verse by verse,
136.949	along with a transliteration
136.949	and the original seventh-century Arabic.
144.072	Now, I did have an advantage.
147.743	My last book was about the story
147.743	behind the Shi'a-Sunni split,
152.435	and for that, I'd worked closely
152.435	with the earliest Islamic histories,
155.872	so I knew the events
155.872	to which the Koran constantly refers,
159.658	its frame of reference.
161.659	I knew enough, that is, to know
161.659	that I'd be a tourist in the Koran --
166.76	an informed one,
168.76	an experienced one, even,
170.259	but still an outsider,
172.632	an agnostic Jew reading
172.632	someone else's holy book.
176.478	(Laughter)
178.577	So I read slowly.
180.171	(Laughter)
184.68	I'd set aside three weeks
184.68	for this project,
187.191	and that, I think,
187.191	"is what is meant by ""hubris"" --"
190.085	(Laughter)
194.395	because it turned out to be three months.
196.595	(Laughter)
198.506	I did resist the temptation
198.506	to skip to the back,
201.028	where the shorter and more
201.028	clearly mystical chapters are.
204.219	But every time I thought I was beginning
204.219	to get a handle on the Koran --
207.76	"that feeling of ""I get it now"" --"
210.066	it would slip away overnight,
212.153	and I'd come back in the morning,
213.831	wondering if I wasn't lost
213.831	in a strange land.
217.298	And yet, the terrain was very familiar.
220.577	The Koran declares that it comes
220.577	to renew the message
223.464	of the Torah and the Gospels.
224.921	So one-third of it reprises
224.921	the stories of Biblical figures
228.433	like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.
234.001	God himself was utterly familiar
236.669	from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,
239.76	jealously insisting on no other gods.
243.898	The presence of camels, mountains,
243.898	desert wells and springs
248.986	took me back to the year I spent
248.986	wandering the Sinai Desert.
253.186	And then there was the language,
253.186	the rhythmic cadence of it,
256.76	reminding me of evenings spent
256.76	listening to Bedouin elders
260.005	recite hours-long narrative poems
263.006	entirely from memory.
266.087	And I began to grasp why it's said
270.814	that the Koran is really
270.814	the Koran only in Arabic.
275.799	Take the Fatihah,
275.799	the seven-verse opening chapter
279.711	that is the Lord's Prayer
279.711	and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.
284.26	It's just 29 words in Arabic,
287.321	but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.
291.186	And yet the more you add,
291.186	the more seems to go missing.
296.127	The Arabic has an incantatory,
296.127	almost hypnotic quality
300.76	that begs to be heard rather than read,
304.042	felt more than analyzed.
306.505	It wants to be chanted out loud,
308.588	to sound its music in the ear
308.588	and on the tongue.
312.015	So the Koran in English
312.015	is a kind of shadow of itself,
316.76	or as Arthur Arberry called his version,
319.615	"""an interpretation."""
322.76	But all is not lost in translation.
326.06	As the Koran promises,
326.06	patience is rewarded,
328.76	and there are many surprises --
330.333	a degree of environmental
330.333	awareness, for instance,
333.513	and of humans as mere stewards
333.513	of God's creation,
337.106	unmatched in the Bible.
339.609	And where the Bible is addressed
339.609	exclusively to men,
342.51	using the second-
342.51	and third-person masculine,
345.16	the Koran includes women --
347.76	talking, for instance,
349.208	of believing men and believing women,
351.656	honorable men and honorable women.
356.244	Or take the infamous verse
356.244	about killing the unbelievers.
361.111	Yes, it does say that,
362.76	but in a very specific context:
365.51	the anticipated conquest
365.51	of the sanctuary city of Mecca,
369.871	where fighting was usually forbidden.
372.419	And the permission comes
372.419	hedged about with qualifiers.
375.966	"Not ""You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,"""
378.76	but you can, you are allowed to,
381.023	but only after a grace period is over,
385.418	and only if there's no other
385.418	pact in place,
388.3	and only if they try to stop
388.3	you getting to the Kaaba,
391.76	and only if they attack you first.
394.5	And even then -- God is merciful;
398.129	forgiveness is supreme --
400.182	and so, essentially,
402.924	better if you don't.
404.401	(Laughter)
407.867	This was perhaps the biggest surprise --
410.654	how flexible the Koran is,
412.76	at least in minds that are not
412.76	fundamentally inflexible.
417.656	"""Some of these verses"
417.656	"are definite in meaning,"" it says,"
421.327	"""and others are ambiguous."""
424.141	The perverse at heart
424.141	will seek out the ambiguities,
427.967	trying to create discord
427.967	by pinning down meanings of their own.
432.62	Only God knows the true meaning.
436.291	"The phrase ""God is subtle"""
436.291	appears again and again,
440.277	and indeed, the whole
440.277	of the Koran is far more subtle
442.903	than most of us have been led to believe.
445.431	As in, for instance, that little matter
445.431	of virgins and paradise.
451.704	Old-fashioned orientalism
451.704	comes into play here.
455.851	"The word used four times is ""houris,"""
460.453	rendered as dark-eyed maidens
460.453	with swelling breasts,
464.934	or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.
469.199	Yet all there is in the original Arabic
469.199	is that one word: houris.
474.505	Not a swelling breast
474.505	or high bosom in sight.
477.033	(Laughter)
479.561	Now this may be a way of saying
479.561	"""pure beings,"" like in angels,"
484.142	or it may be like
484.142	"the Greek ""kouros"" or ""kore,"""
487.179	an eternal youth.
488.545	But the truth is, nobody really knows.
491.305	And that's the point.
493.466	Because the Koran is quite clear
495.906	when it says that you'll be
495.906	"""a new creation in paradise,"""
500.76	"and that you will be ""recreated"
500.76	"in a form unknown to you,"""
505.913	which seems to me
505.913	a far more appealing prospect
508.472	than a virgin.
510.075	(Laughter)
518.252	And that number 72 never appears.
521.587	There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
525.277	That idea only came
525.277	into being 300 years later,
528.546	and most Islamic scholars
528.546	see it as the equivalent
531.547	of people with wings sitting on clouds
531.547	and strumming harps.
536.593	Paradise is quite the opposite.
540.111	It's not virginity;
541.898	it's fecundity;
543.993	it's plenty.
546.107	It's gardens watered by running streams.
551.52	Thank you.
552.696	(Applause)
