12.16	Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?
14.184	Brain magic to me indicates
14.184	that area of magic
16.375	dealing with psychological
16.375	and mind-reading effects.
19.667	So unlike traditional magic,
19.667	it uses the power of words,
22.547	linguistic deception,
22.547	non-verbal communication
25.167	and various other techniques
25.167	to create the illusion of a sixth sense.
30.136	I'm going to show you all how easy it is
32.136	to manipulate the human mind
32.136	once you know how.
34.486	I want everybody downstairs also
34.486	to join in with me and everybody.
37.615	I want everybody to put out your hands
37.615	like this for me, first of all.
40.932	OK, clap them together, once.
42.558	OK, reverse your hands.
44.16	Now, follow my actions exactly.
46.16	Now about half the audience has
46.16	their left hand up. Why is that?
49.232	OK, swap them around,
49.232	put your right hand up.
51.883	Cross your hands over,
51.883	so your right hand goes over,
54.48	interlace your fingers like this,
56.481	then make sure your right thumb
56.481	is outside your left thumb --
59.371	that's very important.
60.544	Yours is the other way around,
60.544	so swap it around.
62.854	Excellent, OK. Extend
62.854	your fingers like this for me.
65.891	All right. Tap them together once.
68.384	OK, now, if you did not allow me
68.384	to deceive your minds,
71.926	you would all be able to do this.
75.9	(Laughter)
79.376	(Laughter ends)
80.979	Now you can see how easy it is
82.51	for me to manipulate the human mind,
82.51	once you know how.
85.16	(Laughter)
87.867	Now, I remember when I was about 15,
90.129	(Laughter)
91.723	I read a copy of Life magazine,
93.666	which detailed a story
93.666	about a 75-year-old blind Russian woman
98.6	who could sense printed letters --
100.276	there's still people trying to do it --
102.172	(Laughter)
103.323	-- who could sense printed letters
103.323	and even sense colors, just by touch.
106.728	And she was completely blind.
108.16	She could also read
108.16	the serial numbers on bills
110.423	when they were placed,
110.423	face down, on a hard surface.
112.924	Now, I was fascinated,
112.924	but at the same time, skeptical.
116.16	How could somebody read
116.16	using their fingertips?
119.302	You know, if you actually think about it,
119.302	if somebody is totally blind --
123.16	a guy yesterday did a demonstration
123.16	in one of the rooms,
125.826	where people had to close their eyes
125.826	and they could just hear things.
129.118	And it's just a really weird thing
129.118	to try and figure out.
132.056	How could somebody read
132.056	using their fingertips?
134.329	Now earlier on, as part of a TV show
134.329	that I have coming up on MTV,
138.068	I attempted to give
138.068	a similar demonstration
140.16	of what is now known as second sight.
143.048	So, let's take a look.
144.16	(Video) Man: There we go.
146.16	I'm going to guide you into the car.
148.16	Kathryn Thomas: (Laughter)
149.66	Man: You're OK, keep on going.
151.16	KT: How are you?
152.258	Keith Barry: Kathryn, it's Keith here.
154.131	I'm going to take you
154.131	to a secret location, OK?
157.16	Kathryn, there was no way
157.16	you could see through that blindfold.
160.148	KT: OK, but don't say my name like that.
160.148	KB: But you're OK?
162.96	KT: Yes.
164.06	KB: No way to see through it?
164.06	KT: No.
166.16	KB: I'll take it off.
167.459	Do you want to take the rest off?
169.16	Take it off, you're OK.
169.16	We'll stop for a second.
171.46	KT: I'm so afraid
171.46	of what I'm going to see.
173.532	KB: You're fine, take it off.
173.532	You're OK. You're safe.
176.232	Have you ever heard of second sight?
178.16	KT: No.
179.22	KB: Second sight is whereby
179.22	a mind-control expert
181.616	can see through somebody else's eyes.
184.16	And I'm going to try that right now.
191.16	KT: God.
199.136	KB: Are you ready?
201.695	Where is it? There's no way --
204.16	KT: (Beep)
209.382	KT: Oh, my God!
210.934	KB: Don't say anything,
212.16	I'm trying to see through your eyes.
212.16	I can't see.
214.756	KT: There's a wall, there's a wall.
216.447	KB: Look at the road, look at the road.
218.447	KT: OK, OK, OK. Oh, my God!
220.16	KB: Now, anything coming at all?
220.16	KT: No.
222.16	KB: Sure there's not?
223.223	KT: No, no, I'm just still
223.223	looking at the road.
225.46	I'm looking at the road, all the time.
227.359	I'm not taking my eyes off the road.
229.16	(Beep)
234.16	(Beep)
239.153	(Beep)
241.136	KT: Oh, my God!
242.16	KB: Where are we? Where are we?
244.185	We're going uphill, are we going uphill?
247.16	KT: Look at the road -- (Beep)
249.16	Still got that goddamn blindfold on.
251.16	KB: What?
252.263	KT: How are you doing this?
253.929	KB: Just don't break my concentration.
259.16	We're OK, though?
259.16	KT: Yes.
267.16	That's so weird.
269.16	We're nearly there. Oh, my God!
274.71	Oh, my God!
278.215	KB: And I've stopped.
280.826	KT: That is weird.
287.16	You're like a freak-ass of nature.
290.161	That was the most scary thing
290.161	I've ever done in my life!
293.16	(Applause)
294.232	KB: Thank you.
296.16	By the way, two days ago,
296.16	we were going to film this
299.16	down there, at the race course,
299.16	and we got a guy into a car,
302.16	and we got a camera man in the back,
304.16	but halfway through the drive,
305.721	he told me he had,
305.721	I think it was a nine-millimeter,
308.191	stuck to his leg.
309.384	So, I stopped pretty quick,
309.384	and that was it.
311.494	So, do you believe it's possible
311.494	to see through somebody else's eyes?
314.787	That's the question.
315.89	Now, most people here
315.89	would automatically say no.
318.419	OK, but I want you to realize some facts.
320.587	I couldn't see through the blindfold.
322.832	The car was not gimmicked
322.832	or tricked in any way.
325.666	The girl, I'd never met before, all right.
328.628	So, I want you to just think
328.628	about it for a moment.
331.132	A lot of people try to come up
332.81	with a logical solution
332.81	to what just happened, all right.
335.501	But because your brains are not
335.501	trained in the art of deception,
338.903	the solutions you come up with
340.368	will, 99 percent of the time,
340.368	be way off the mark.
343.502	This is because magic
343.502	is all about directing attention.
346.16	If, for instance, I didn't want
346.16	you to look at my right hand,
349.101	then I don't look at it.
350.36	But if I wanted you
350.36	to look at my right hand,
353.155	then I look at it, too.
354.401	You see, it's very simple,
354.401	once you know how,
356.544	but very complicated in other ways.
358.271	I'm going to give you
358.271	some demonstrations right now.
360.812	I need two people to help me out
360.812	real quick. Can you come up?
363.694	And let's see, down at the end, here,
363.694	can you also come up, real quick?
367.754	Do you mind? Yes, at the end.
369.16	OK, give them a round of applause
369.16	as they come up.
371.565	You might want to use the stairs, there.
373.565	(Applause)
376.161	It's very important
376.161	for everybody here to realize
378.486	I haven't set anything up with you.
380.26	You don't know what will happen, right?
382.158	Would you mind just standing
382.158	over here for a moment?
384.659	Your name is?
384.659	Nicole: Nicole.
386.077	KB: Nicole, and?
387.108	(Telephone ringing)
388.141	KB: Actually, here's the thing,
388.141	answer it, answer it, answer it.
392.097	(Laughter)
393.16	Is it a girl?
393.16	Man: They've already gone.
395.16	KB: OK, swap over positions.
396.534	Can you stand over here?
396.534	This will make it easier.
399.16	Pity, I would have told them
399.16	it was the ace of spades.
401.76	OK, a little bit closer.
402.929	(Laughter)
404.105	OK, a little bit closer, come over --
404.105	they look really nervous up here.
407.699	Do you believe in witchcraft?
409.16	Nicole: No.
410.26	KB: Voodoo?
410.26	Nicole: No.
411.563	KB: Things that go bump in the night?
411.563	Nicole: No.
413.952	KB: Besides, who's next, no, OK.
415.56	I want you to just stand
415.56	exactly like this for me,
417.976	pull up your sleeves, if you don't mind.
419.97	OK, now, I want you to be aware
421.511	of all the different
421.511	sensations around you,
423.56	because we'll try a voodoo experiment.
425.46	I want you to be aware of the sensations,
425.46	but don't say anything until I ask you,
429.46	and don't open your eyes until I ask you.
431.76	From this point onwards, close your eyes,
433.747	do not say anything, do not open them,
435.592	be aware of the sensations.
445.16	Yes or no, did you feel anything?
447.16	Nicole: Yes.
448.185	KB: You did feel that? What did you feel?
450.222	Nicole: A touch on my back.
451.898	KB: How many times did you feel it?
455.412	Nicole: Twice.
456.484	KB: Twice. OK, extend your left arm
456.484	out in front of you.
459.174	Extend your left arm, OK.
461.71	OK, keep it there.
463.16	Be aware of the sensations, don't say
463.16	anything, don't open your eyes, OK.
475.136	Did you feel anything, there?
476.541	Nicole: Yes.
476.541	KB: What did you feel?
478.191	Nicole: Three --
479.247	KB: Like a tickling sensation?
479.247	Nicole: Yes.
481.294	KB: Can you show us where?
483.16	OK, excellent. Open your eyes.
485.16	I never touched you.
486.207	I just touched his back,
486.207	and I just touched his arm.
489.765	A voodoo experiment.
492.294	(Laughter)
495.16	Yeah, I walk around nightclubs
495.16	all night like this.
497.613	(Laughter)
500.099	You just take a seat
500.099	over here for a second.
502.177	I'm going to use you again, in a moment.
504.16	Can you take a seat
504.16	right over here, if you don't mind.
506.756	Sit right here.
506.756	Man: OK.
508.629	KB: OK, take a seat. Excellent, OK.
511.16	Now, what I want you to do
511.16	is look directly at me, OK,
514.16	just take a deep breath
514.16	in through your nose,
516.327	letting it out through
516.327	your mouth, and relax.
518.901	Allow your eyes to close,
518.901	on five, four, three, two, one.
522.643	Close your eyes right now.
524.16	OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,
526.16	I'm merely placing you in a heightened
526.16	state of synchronicity,
529.137	so our minds are along the same lines.
531.16	And as you sink and drift and float
531.16	into this relaxed state of mind,
535.16	I'm going to take your left hand,
535.16	and just place it up here.
538.16	I want you to hold it there
538.16	just for a moment,
540.355	and I only want you to allow your hand
542.23	to sink and drift and float
542.23	back to the tabletop
544.633	at the same rate and speed
546.16	as you drift and float into this
546.16	relaxed state of awareness,
549.379	and allow it to go all the way
549.379	down to the tabletop.
552.442	That's it, all the way down,
552.442	all the way down.
555.585	and further, and further.
558.212	Excellent.
559.505	I want you to allow your hand
559.505	to stick firmly to the tabletop.
562.434	OK, now, allow it to stay there.
564.765	OK, now, in a moment,
564.765	you'll feel a certain pressure, OK,
567.766	and I want you
567.766	to be aware of the pressure.
574.436	Just be aware of the pressure.
577.74	And I only want you to allow your hand
579.621	to float slowly back up from the tabletop
579.621	as you feel the pressure release,
583.169	but only when you feel
583.169	the pressure release.
585.999	Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.
588.16	Man: Yes.
595.3	KB: Hold it right there.
596.546	And only when you feel
596.546	the pressure go back,
598.665	allow your hand to drift
598.665	back to the tabletop,
600.925	but only when you feel the pressure.
606.711	(Laughter)
608.815	OK, that was wonderfully done.
608.815	Let's try it again.
621.813	Excellent. Now that you've got the idea,
621.813	let's try something even more interesting.
625.743	Allow it to stick firmly
625.743	to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.
628.767	Can you stand up?
628.767	Just stand, stage forward.
631.807	I want you to point directly
631.807	at his forehead.
634.29	OK.
635.512	Imagine a connection between you and him.
638.567	Only when you want
638.567	the pressure to be released,
640.808	make an upward gesture, like this,
642.474	but only when you want it to be released.
644.491	You can wait as long as you want,
646.164	but only when you want
646.164	the pressure released.
655.317	OK, let's try it again.
656.864	OK, now, imagine the connection, OK.
659.16	Point directly at his forehead.
661.16	Only when you want the pressure
661.16	released, we'll try it again.
667.16	OK, it worked that time, excellent.
669.16	And hold it there, both of you.
671.16	Only when you want the pressure
671.16	to go back, make a downward gesture.
674.423	You can wait as long as you want.
678.477	You did it pretty quickly,
678.477	but it went down, OK.
681.993	Now, I want you to be aware
681.993	that in a moment,
684.16	when I snap my fingers,
684.16	your eyes will open, again.
686.592	It's OK to remember to forget,
686.592	or forget to remember what happened.
689.811	"Most people ask you, ""What"
689.811	"the hell just happened up here?"""
692.605	But it's OK that even though
692.605	you're not hypnotized,
695.012	you will forget everything that happened.
697.268	On five, four, three, two, one --
697.268	open your eyes, wide awake.
700.16	Give them a round of applause,
700.16	as they go back to their seats.
703.488	(Applause)
705.025	OK, you can go back.
706.416	(Applause)
710.375	I once saw a film called
710.375	"""The Gods Are Crazy."""
712.684	Has anybody here seen that film? Yeah.
715.16	Remember when they threw
715.16	the Coke out of the airplane,
717.792	and it landed on the ground,
717.792	and it didn't break?
720.144	Now, see, that's because
720.144	Coke bottles are solid.
723.006	It's nearly impossible
723.006	to break a Coke bottle.
726.317	Do you want to try it?
729.429	Good job. She's not taking any chances.
731.859	(Laughter)
733.16	You see, psychokinesis
733.16	is the paranormal influence
735.565	of the mind on physical
735.565	events and processes.
738.542	For some magicians or mentalists,
740.16	sometimes the spoon will bend
740.16	or melt, sometimes it will not.
744.16	Sometimes the object will slide
744.16	across the table, sometimes it will not.
747.668	It depends on how much
747.668	energy you have that day,
749.964	so on and so forth.
751.052	We're going to try an experiment
751.052	in psychokinesis, right now.
753.934	Come right over here, next to me.
753.934	Excellent.
756.087	Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
757.896	Make sure it is solid, there's only
757.896	one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
761.492	And you can whack it against the table,
761.492	if you want; be careful.
764.517	Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.
766.541	I want you to pinch right here
766.541	with two fingers and your thumb.
769.915	Excellent.
769.915	Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.
772.493	I want you to examine the shard of glass.
774.47	Careful, it's sharp.
774.47	Just hold on to it for a moment.
777.069	Now, hold it out here.
778.261	I want you to imagine, right now,
778.261	a broken relationship from many years ago.
782.707	I want you to imagine
782.707	all the negative energy
785.812	from that broken
785.812	relationship, from that guy,
787.988	being imparted into the broken
787.988	piece of glass,
790.516	which will represent him, OK.
792.16	But I want you to take this
792.16	very seriously.
794.232	Stare at the glass,
794.232	ignore everybody right here.
796.542	In a moment, you'll feel
796.542	a certain sensation, OK,
799.689	and when you feel that sensation,
801.529	I want you to drop the piece
801.529	of glass into the bottle.
804.16	Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.
809.081	(Laughter)
810.16	I'm trying to be good here.
811.597	OK, and when you feel the sensation --
813.431	it might take a while --
813.431	drop it into the glass.
827.969	OK, drop it in.
829.501	Now, imagine all that negative
829.501	energy in there.
832.16	Imagine his name
832.16	and imagine him inside the glass.
834.817	And I want you to release
834.817	that negative energy
837.085	by shaking it from side to side.
839.726	(Burst)
840.751	(Laughter)
843.16	That was a lot of negative energy,
843.16	built up in there.
845.716	(Laughter)
847.802	(Applause)
851.16	I also want you to look at me
851.16	and think of his name.
854.185	OK, think of how many letters
854.185	in the title of his name.
858.184	There's five letters in the title.
859.89	You didn't react to that,
859.89	so it's four letters.
862.161	Think of one of the letters in the title.
864.16	There's a K in his name, there is a K.
866.16	I knew that because my name
866.16	starts with a K also,
868.56	but his name doesn't start
868.56	with a K, it starts with an M.
871.421	Tell Mike I said hello,
871.421	the next time you see him.
873.867	Was that his name?
873.867	Nicole: Mm-hmm.
875.56	KB: OK, give her a round of applause.
877.361	(Applause)
882.993	Thank you.
884.16	(Applause)
889.329	(Applause ends)
890.652	I've got one more thing
890.652	to share with you right now.
893.16	Actually, Chris, I was going
893.16	to pick you for this,
895.565	but instead of picking you,
895.565	can you hop up here
897.828	and pick a victim
897.828	for this next experiment?
900.16	And it should be a male victim,
900.16	that's the only thing.
902.756	Chris Anderson: Oh, OK.
904.16	KB: I was going to use you,
905.57	but I decided I might want
905.57	to come back another year.
908.16	(Laughter)
909.199	CA: Well, to reward him
909.199	"for saying ""eureka,"""
911.335	and for selecting Michael Mercil to come
911.335	and talk to us -- Steve Jurvetson.
914.927	KB: OK, Steve, come on up here.
916.697	(Applause)
917.793	CA: You knew!
918.858	KB: OK, Steve, I want you to take
918.858	a seat, right behind here. Excellent.
924.849	Now, Steve -- oh, you
924.849	can check underneath.
928.96	Go ahead, I've no fancy
928.96	assistants underneath there.
931.547	They insist that because I was a magician,
934.086	put a nice, black tablecloth on.
935.65	There you are, OK.
937.087	(Laughter)
938.16	I've got four wooden plinths here, Steve.
940.16	One, two, three and four.
943.16	Now, they're all the exact
943.16	same except this one
945.423	obviously has a stainless steel
945.423	spike sticking out of it.
948.162	I want you to examine it,
948.162	and make sure it's solid.
953.255	Happy?
954.286	Steve Jurvetson: Mmm, yes.
956.264	KB: OK. Now, Steve, I'm going
956.264	to stand in front of the table,
959.795	When I stand in front of the table,
961.591	I want you to put the cups on the plinths,
963.73	in any order you want,
963.73	and then mix them all up,
965.993	so nobody has any idea where
965.993	the spike is, all right?
968.788	SJ: No one in the audience?
970.16	KB: Yes, and just to help you out,
972.16	I'll block them from view,
972.16	so nobody can see what you're doing.
975.17	I'll also look away. So, go
975.17	ahead and mix them up, now.
977.766	OK, and tell me when you're done.
982.093	(Laughter)
984.87	(Laughter)
988.732	KB: You done?
988.732	SJ: Almost.
990.756	KB: Almost, oh. OK, you're making
990.756	sure that's well hidden.
994.693	Oh, we've got one here,
994.693	we've got one here.
999.16	(Applause)
1002.16	So, all right, we'll leave them like that.
1004.184	(Laughter)
1006.16	I'm going to have the last laugh, though.
1008.185	(Laughter)
1010.16	Now, Steve, you know where the spike is,
1010.16	but nobody else, does? Correct?
1015.16	But I don't want you to know either,
1015.16	so swivel around on your chair.
1019.375	They'll keep an eye on me
1019.375	to make sure I don't do anything funny.
1022.447	No, stay around, OK.
1031.036	Now, Steve, look back.
1032.742	Now you don't know where the spike is,
1032.742	and I don't know where it is either.
1036.536	Now, is there any way to see
1036.536	through this blindfold?
1039.682	SJ: Put this on?
1040.738	KB: No, just, is there any way
1040.738	to see through it? No?
1043.509	SJ: No, I can't see through it.
1043.509	KB: Excellent.
1046.16	Now, I'm going to put on the blindfold.
1048.048	Don't stack them up, OK.
1048.048	Give them an extra mix up.
1050.505	Don't move the cups, I don't want
1050.505	anybody to see where the spike is,
1053.81	but give the plinths an extra mix up,
1053.81	and then line them up.
1056.91	I'll put the blindfold on.
1056.91	Give them an extra mix up.
1059.78	No messing around this time.
1059.78	OK, go ahead, mix them up.
1062.377	My hand is at risk here.
1067.136	(Laughter)
1068.16	Tell me when you're done.
1068.16	SJ: Done.
1070.16	KB: OK, where are you?
1070.16	Put out your hand. Your right hand.
1073.16	Tell me when I'm over a cup.
1075.16	SJ: You're over a cup.
1075.16	KB: I'm over a cup, right now?
1077.661	SJ: Mm-hmm.
1078.745	KB: Now, Steve, do you think
1078.745	it's here? Yes or no?
1081.16	SJ: Oh!
1082.469	(Laughter)
1084.16	KB: I told you I'd have the last laugh.
1086.16	(Laughter)
1091.055	SJ: I don't think it's there.
1091.055	KB: No? Good decision.
1094.554	(Laughter)
1097.16	(Applause)
1102.721	(Applause ends)
1104.16	Now, if I go this way,
1104.16	is there another cup over here?
1106.756	SJ: Can we do the left hand?
1108.16	KB: Oh, no, no, no. He asked me could
1108.16	he do the left hand. Absolutely not.
1112.16	(Laughter)
1113.86	KB: If I go this way,
1113.86	is there another cup?
1116.338	SJ: Yes.
1116.338	KB: Tell me when to stop.
1118.176	SJ: OK.
1118.176	KB: There?
1119.318	SJ: Yes, there's one.
1120.382	KB: OK. Do you think it's here, yes or no?
1120.382	This is your decision, not mine.
1123.993	(Laughter)
1127.818	SJ: I'm going to say no.
1127.818	KB: Good decision.
1130.16	(Laughter)
1132.16	OK, give me both hands.
1134.16	Now, put them on both cups.
1137.976	Do you think the spike
1137.976	is under your left or your right hand?
1141.666	SJ: Neither.
1143.16	KB: Neither, oh, OK.
1145.16	But if you were to guess.
1146.742	(Laughter)
1149.136	SJ: Under my right hand.
1149.136	KB: Under your right hand?
1151.56	Now, remember, you made
1151.56	all the decisions all along.
1154.061	Psychologists, figure this out.
1155.72	(SJ gasps)
1156.835	Have a look.
1158.16	SJ: Oh!
1159.185	(Applause)
1162.504	KB: Thank you.
1168.898	(Applause ends)
1171.16	If anybody wants to see
1171.16	some sleight of hand later on,
1173.756	I'll be outside.
1175.16	Thank you.
1176.278	(Applause)
1177.977	Thank you.
1179.978	Thank you.
1181.16	(Applause)
