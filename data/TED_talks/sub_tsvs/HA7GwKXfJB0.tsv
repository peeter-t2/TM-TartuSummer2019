17.26	We live in in a remarkable time,
20.26	the age of genomics.
23.26	Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
26.26	Your sequence and mine are slightly different.
29.26	That's why we look different.
31.26	I've got brown eyes;
33.26	you might have blue or gray.
36.26	But it's not just skin-deep.
38.26	The headlines tell us
40.26	that genes can give us scary diseases,
43.26	maybe even shape our personality,
46.26	or give us mental disorders.
49.26	Our genes seem to have
52.26	awesome power over our destinies.
56.26	And yet, I would like to think
59.26	that I am more than my genes.
64.26	What do you guys think?
66.26	Are you more than your genes?
69.26	(Audience: Yes.) Yes?
73.26	I think some people agree with me.
75.26	I think we should make a statement.
77.26	I think we should say it all together.
80.26	"All right: ""I'm more than my genes"" -- all together."
83.26	Everybody: I am more than my genes.
87.26	(Cheering)
90.26	Sebastian Seung: What am I?
92.26	(Laughter)
95.26	I am my connectome.
100.26	Now, since you guys are really great,
102.26	maybe you can humor me and say this all together too.
104.26	(Laughter)
106.26	Right. All together now.
108.26	Everybody: I am my connectome.
113.26	SS: That sounded great.
115.26	You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is,
117.26	and you're willing to play along with me.
119.26	I could just go home now.
122.26	Well, so far only one connectome is known,
125.26	that of this tiny worm.
128.26	Its modest nervous system
130.26	consists of just 300 neurons.
132.26	And in the 1970s and '80s,
134.26	a team of scientists
136.26	mapped all 7,000 connections
138.26	between the neurons.
141.26	In this diagram, every node is a neuron,
143.26	and every line is a connection.
145.26	This is the connectome
147.26	of the worm C. elegans.
151.26	Your connectome is far more complex than this
154.26	because your brain
156.26	contains 100 billion neurons
158.26	and 10,000 times as many connections.
161.26	There's a diagram like this for your brain,
163.26	but there's no way it would fit on this slide.
167.26	Your connectome contains one million times more connections
170.26	than your genome has letters.
173.26	That's a lot of information.
175.26	What's in that information?
179.26	We don't know for sure, but there are theories.
182.26	Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated
185.26	that maybe your memories --
187.26	the information that makes you, you --
189.26	maybe your memories are stored
191.26	in the connections between your brain's neurons.
195.26	And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity --
197.26	maybe your personality and your intellect --
200.26	maybe they're also encoded
202.26	in the connections between your neurons.
206.26	And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:
209.26	I am my connectome.
212.26	I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;
215.26	I just want you to remember it.
217.26	And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,
219.26	because we have never had technologies
221.26	powerful enough to test it.
224.26	Finding that worm connectome
227.26	took over a dozen years of tedious labor.
230.26	And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,
233.26	we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,
236.26	that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
239.26	And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,
242.26	which are currently under development
244.26	in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.
248.26	Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.
251.26	You can recognize them instantly
253.26	by their fantastic shapes.
256.26	They extend long and delicate branches,
259.26	and in short, they look like trees.
262.26	But this is just a single neuron.
265.26	In order to find connectomes,
267.26	we have to see all the neurons at the same time.
270.26	So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,
272.26	who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman
274.26	at Harvard University.
276.26	Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices
278.26	of a mouse brain.
280.26	And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times
284.26	to obtain the resolution,
286.26	so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.
290.26	Except, you still may not really recognize them,
293.26	and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.
296.26	If we take many images of many slices of the brain
298.26	and stack them up,
300.26	we get a three-dimensional image.
302.26	And still, you may not see the branches.
304.26	So we start at the top,
306.26	and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,
309.26	and we do that for the next slice
311.26	and for the next slice.
313.26	And we keep on doing that,
315.26	slice after slice.
318.26	If we continue through the entire stack,
320.26	we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape
323.26	of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.
326.26	And we can do that for another neuron in green.
328.26	And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron
330.26	at two locations,
332.26	and these are what are called synapses.
334.26	Let's zoom in on one synapse,
336.26	and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
339.26	You should see small circles --
341.26	these are called vesicles.
344.26	They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
347.26	And so when the green neuron wants to communicate,
349.26	it wants to send a message to the red neuron,
351.26	it spits out neurotransmitter.
354.26	At the synapse, the two neurons
356.26	are said to be connected
358.26	like two friends talking on the telephone.
362.26	So you see how to find a synapse.
364.26	How can we find an entire connectome?
367.26	Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images
370.26	and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.
373.26	We color every neuron in, in a different color,
376.26	and then we look through all of the images,
378.26	find the synapses
380.26	and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
383.26	If we can do that throughout all the images,
386.26	we could find a connectome.
389.26	Now, at this point,
391.26	you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
393.26	And so I think we're ready to tackle
395.26	one of the most important questions in neuroscience:
399.26	how are the brains of men and women different?
402.26	(Laughter)
404.26	According to this self-help book,
406.26	guys brains are like waffles;
408.26	they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.
411.26	Girls' brains are like spaghetti;
414.26	everything in their life is connected to everything else.
417.26	(Laughter)
419.26	You guys are laughing,
421.26	but you know, this book changed my life.
423.26	(Laughter)
427.26	But seriously, what's wrong with this?
430.26	You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement?
440.26	It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,
443.26	everyone's brains are like spaghetti.
446.26	Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
450.26	Just as one strand of spaghetti
452.26	contacts many other strands on your plate,
455.26	one neuron touches many other neurons
457.26	through their entangled branches.
459.26	One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,
462.26	because there can be synapses
464.26	at these points of contact.
469.26	By now, you might have sort of lost perspective
472.26	on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.
475.26	And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.
478.26	I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.
483.26	So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.
486.26	And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches
489.26	are contained inside this cube.
492.26	And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
497.26	And that's just a mouse brain --
501.26	it's a lot smaller than a human brain.
505.26	So when show my friends this,
507.26	sometimes they've told me,
509.26	"""You know, Sebastian, you should just give up."
512.26	"Neuroscience is hopeless."""
514.26	Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye,
516.26	you don't really see how complex it is,
518.26	but when you use a microscope,
520.26	finally the hidden complexity is revealed.
525.26	In the 17th century,
527.26	the mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal,
529.26	wrote of his dread of the infinite,
532.26	his feeling of insignificance
534.26	at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.
539.26	And, as a scientist,
541.26	I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings --
544.26	too much information, professor.
546.26	(Laughter)
548.26	But may I?
550.26	(Laughter)
552.26	(Applause)
554.26	I feel curiosity,
556.26	and I feel wonder,
558.26	but at times I have also felt despair.
562.26	Why did I choose to study
564.26	this organ that is so awesome in its complexity
567.26	that it might well be infinite?
569.26	It's absurd.
571.26	How could we even dare to think
573.26	that we might ever understand this?
578.26	And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
581.26	And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
585.26	Someday,
587.26	a fleet of microscopes will capture
589.26	every neuron and every synapse
591.26	in a vast database of images.
594.26	And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers
597.26	will analyze the images without human assistance
600.26	to summarize them in a connectome.
604.26	I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,
608.26	because finding an entire human connectome
610.26	is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.
613.26	It will take the work of generations to succeed.
617.26	At the present time, my collaborators and I,
620.26	what we're aiming for is much more modest --
622.26	just to find partial connectomes
624.26	of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
627.26	But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis
630.26	that I am my connectome.
635.26	For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,
638.26	that it's actually worth taking seriously.
642.26	As you grow during childhood
644.26	and age during adulthood,
647.26	your personal identity changes slowly.
650.26	Likewise, every connectome
652.26	changes over time.
655.26	What kinds of changes happen?
657.26	Well, neurons, like trees,
659.26	can grow new branches,
661.26	and they can lose old ones.
664.26	Synapses can be created,
667.26	and they can be eliminated.
670.26	And synapses can grow larger,
672.26	and they can grow smaller.
675.26	Second question:
677.26	what causes these changes?
680.26	Well, it's true.
682.26	To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.
685.26	But that's not the whole story,
687.26	because there are signals, electrical signals,
689.26	that travel along the branches of neurons
691.26	and chemical signals
693.26	that jump across from branch to branch.
695.26	These signals are called neural activity.
698.26	And there's a lot of evidence
700.26	that neural activity
703.26	is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,
706.26	our mental experiences.
708.26	And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity
711.26	can cause your connections to change.
714.26	And if you put those two facts together,
717.26	it means that your experiences
719.26	can change your connectome.
722.26	And that's why every connectome is unique,
724.26	even those of genetically identical twins.
728.26	The connectome is where nature meets nurture.
732.26	And it might true
734.26	that just the mere act of thinking
736.26	can change your connectome --
738.26	an idea that you may find empowering.
744.26	What's in this picture?
748.26	A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
752.26	What else is in this picture?
757.26	Do not forget that groove in the Earth
759.26	called the stream bed.
762.26	Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
765.26	And with the stream,
767.26	I would like to propose a metaphor
769.26	for the relationship between neural activity
771.26	and connectivity.
774.26	Neural activity is constantly changing.
777.26	It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
780.26	The connections
782.26	of the brain's neural network
784.26	determines the pathways
786.26	along which neural activity flows.
788.26	And so the connectome is like bed of the stream;
793.26	but the metaphor is richer than that,
796.26	because it's true that the stream bed
799.26	guides the flow of the water,
801.26	but over long timescales,
803.26	the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.
806.26	And as I told you just now,
808.26	neural activity can change the connectome.
813.26	And if you'll allow me to ascend
815.26	to metaphorical heights,
818.26	I will remind you that neural activity
821.26	is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think --
823.26	of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
826.26	And so we might even speak of
828.26	the stream of consciousness.
830.26	Neural activity is its water,
833.26	and the connectome is its bed.
837.26	So let's return from the heights of metaphor
839.26	and return to science.
841.26	Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes
843.26	actually work.
845.26	How will we go about testing the hypothesis
847.26	"""I am my connectome?"""
850.26	Well, I propose a direct test.
853.26	Let us attempt
855.26	to read out memories from connectomes.
858.26	Consider the memory
860.26	of long temporal sequences of movements,
863.26	like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
866.26	According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,
869.26	such memories are stored
871.26	as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
875.26	Because, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,
878.26	through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,
881.26	and so on down the line,
883.26	like a chain of falling dominoes.
885.26	And this sequence of neural activation
887.26	is hypothesized to be the neural basis
890.26	of those sequence of movements.
892.26	So one way of trying to test the theory
894.26	is to look for such chains
896.26	inside connectomes.
898.26	But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
901.26	They're going to be scrambled up.
903.26	So we'll have to use our computers
905.26	to try to unscramble the chain.
908.26	And if we can do that,
910.26	the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling
913.26	will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity
916.26	that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.
919.26	And if that were successful,
921.26	that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
928.26	(Laughter)
930.26	What a mess --
933.26	have you ever tried to wire up a system
935.26	as complex as this?
937.26	I hope not.
939.26	But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.
945.26	The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.
947.26	Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?
954.26	I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
956.26	(Laughter)
959.26	I estimate, millions of miles,
962.26	all packed in your skull.
965.26	And if you appreciate that number,
967.26	you can easily see
969.26	there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.
971.26	And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,
974.26	"""Anorexic brains are wired differently,"""
976.26	"or ""Autistic brains are wired differently."""
978.26	These are plausible claims,
980.26	but in truth,
982.26	we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough
984.26	to tell if these are really true.
986.26	And so the technologies for seeing connectomes
989.26	will allow us to finally
991.26	read mis-wiring of the brain,
993.26	to see mental disorders in connectomes.
1000.26	Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis
1003.26	is to consider its most extreme implication.
1006.26	Philosophers know this game very well.
1010.26	If you believe that I am my connectome,
1013.26	I think you must also accept the idea
1016.26	that death is the destruction
1018.26	of your connectome.
1022.26	I mention this because there are prophets today
1025.26	who claim that technology
1028.26	will fundamentally alter the human condition
1031.26	and perhaps even transform the human species.
1034.26	One of their most cherished dreams
1037.26	is to cheat death
1039.26	by that practice known as cryonics.
1041.26	If you pay 100,000 dollars,
1043.26	you can arrange to have your body frozen after death
1046.26	and stored in liquid nitrogen
1048.26	in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse,
1050.26	awaiting a future civilization
1052.26	that is advanced to resurrect you.
1056.26	Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality,
1058.26	calling them fools?
1060.26	Or will they someday chuckle
1062.26	over our graves?
1065.26	I don't know --
1067.26	I prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.
1070.26	I propose that we attempt to find a connectome
1072.26	of a frozen brain.
1074.26	We know that damage to the brain
1076.26	occurs after death and during freezing.
1078.26	The question is: has that damage erased the connectome?
1081.26	If it has, there is no way that any future civilization
1084.26	will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.
1087.26	Resurrection might succeed for the body,
1089.26	but not for the mind.
1091.26	On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,
1094.26	we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.
1100.26	I've described a quest
1102.26	that begins in the world of the very small,
1105.26	and propels us to the world of the far future.
1108.26	Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history.
1112.26	As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors
1114.26	on the African savanna,
1116.26	what distinguished us was our larger brains.
1120.26	We have used our brains to fashion
1122.26	ever more amazing technologies.
1125.26	Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful
1128.26	that we will use them to know ourselves
1131.26	by deconstructing and reconstructing
1134.26	our own brains.
1137.26	I believe that this voyage of self-discovery
1140.26	is not just for scientists,
1143.26	but for all of us.
1145.26	And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.
1148.26	Thank you.
1150.26	(Applause)
