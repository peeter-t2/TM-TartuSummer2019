12.54	People have been using media
12.54	to talk about sex for a long time.
17.42	Love letters, phone sex, racy Polaroids.
21.3	There's even a story of a girl who eloped
21.3	with a man that she met over the telegraph
27.38	in 1886.
30.38	Today we have sexting,
30.38	and I am a sexting expert.
35.5	Not an expert sexter.
38.62	Though, I do know what this means --
38.62	I think you do too.
42.82	[it's a penis]
44.22	(Laughter)
48.18	I have been studying sexting since
48.18	the media attention to it began in 2008.
54.54	I wrote a book on the moral
54.54	panic about sexting.
57.54	And here's what I found:
59.18	most people are worrying
59.18	about the wrong thing.
62.42	They're trying to just prevent
62.42	sexting from happening entirely.
66.62	But let me ask you this:
68.18	As long as it's completely consensual,
68.18	what's the problem with sexting?
73.06	People are into all sorts of things
73.06	that you may not be into,
77.1	like blue cheese or cilantro.
79.42	(Laughter)
82.42	Sexting is certainly risky,
82.42	like anything that's fun,
86.58	but as long as you're not sending an image
86.58	to someone who doesn't want to receive it,
93.3	there's no harm.
95.1	What I do think is a serious problem
97.74	is when people share
97.74	private images of others
101.02	without their permission.
103.18	And instead of worrying about sexting,
105.54	what I think we need to do
105.54	is think a lot more about digital privacy.
110.7	The key is consent.
113.5	Right now most people
113.5	are thinking about sexting
116.82	without really thinking
116.82	about consent at all.
120.22	Did you know that we currently
120.22	criminalize teen sexting?
125.22	It can be a crime because
125.22	it counts as child pornography,
128.7	if there's an image of someone under 18,
131.58	and it doesn't even matter
132.94	if they took that image of themselves
132.94	and shared it willingly.
137.62	So we end up with this
137.62	bizarre legal situation
140.62	where two 17-year-olds
140.62	can legally have sex in most US states
145.18	but they can't photograph it.
148.38	Some states have also tried
148.38	passing sexting misdemeanor laws
152.66	but these laws repeat the same problem
155.7	because they still
155.7	make consensual sexting illegal.
160.34	It doesn't make sense
161.62	to try to ban all sexting
161.62	to try to address privacy violations.
166.38	This is kind of like saying,
167.9	let's solve the problem of date rape
167.9	by just making dating completely illegal.
174.94	Most teens don't get arrested for sexting,
174.94	but can you guess who does?
180.34	It's often teens who are disliked
180.34	by their partner's parents.
185.34	And this can be because of class bias,
185.34	racism or homophobia.
190.78	Most prosecutors are,
190.78	of course, smart enough
193.58	not to use child pornography charges
193.58	against teenagers, but some do.
199.54	According to researchers
199.54	at the University of New Hampshire
203.22	seven percent of all child pornography
203.22	possession arrests are teens,
208.9	sexting consensually with other teens.
213.3	Child pornography is a serious crime,
215.86	but it's just not
215.86	the same thing as teen sexting.
220.86	Parents and educators
220.86	are also responding to sexting
224.3	without really thinking
224.3	too much about consent.
227.46	Their message to teens is often:
227.46	just don't do it.
232.02	And I totally get it --
232.02	there are serious legal risks
235.54	and of course, that potential
235.54	for privacy violations.
239.22	And when you were a teen,
240.5	I'm sure you did exactly
240.5	as you were told, right?
245.26	You're probably thinking,
245.26	my kid would never sext.
248.74	And that's true, your little angel
248.74	may not be sexting
252.22	because only 33 percent
255.38	of 16- and 17-year-olds are sexting.
259.02	But, sorry, by the time they're older,
259.02	odds are they will be sexting.
263.66	Every study I've seen puts the rate
263.66	above 50 percent for 18- to 24-year-olds.
270.54	And most of the time, nothing goes wrong.
273.62	People ask me all the time things like,
273.62	isn't sexting just so dangerous, though?
279.02	It's like you wouldn't
279.02	leave your wallet on a park bench
282.62	and you expect it's going to get stolen
282.62	if you do that, right?
286.7	Here's how I think about it:
288.18	sexting is like leaving your wallet
288.18	at your boyfriend's house.
292.14	If you come back the next day
293.94	and all the money is just gone,
296.86	you really need to dump that guy.
299.51	(Laughter)
303.18	So instead of criminalizing sexting
305.54	to try to prevent
305.54	these privacy violations,
308.18	instead we need to make consent central
311.5	to how we think about the circulation
311.5	of our private information.
316.3	Every new media technology
316.3	raises privacy concerns.
320.58	In fact, in the US the very first
320.58	major debates about privacy
325.22	were in response to technologies
325.22	that were relatively new at the time.
329.74	In the late 1800s,
329.74	people were worried about cameras,
333.66	which were just suddenly
333.66	more portable than ever before,
337.14	and newspaper gossip columns.
339.66	They were worried that the camera
339.66	would capture information about them,
343.5	take it out of context
343.5	and widely disseminate it.
347.06	Does this sound familiar?
348.7	It's exactly what we're worrying about
348.7	now with social media and drone cameras,
353.58	and, of course, sexting.
355.74	And these fears about technology,
357.98	they make sense
359.22	because technologies
359.22	can amplify and bring out
362.66	our worst qualities and behaviors.
365.98	But there are solutions.
368.38	And we've been here before
368.38	with a dangerous new technology.
372.54	In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T car.
376.34	Traffic fatality rates were rising.
378.94	It was a serious problem --
378.94	it looks so safe, right?
383.9	Our first response
383.9	was to try to change drivers' behavior,
387.9	so we developed speed limits
387.9	and enforced them through fines.
392.06	But over the following decades,
393.94	we started to realize the technology
393.94	of the car itself is not just neutral.
399.46	We could design the car to make it safer.
402.7	So in the 1920s, we got
402.7	shatter-resistant windshields.
406.18	In the 1950s, seat belts.
408.7	And in the 1990s, airbags.
412.26	All three of these areas:
414.66	laws, individuals and industry
414.66	came together over time
419.46	to help solve the problem
419.46	that a new technology causes.
423.26	And we can do the same thing
423.26	with digital privacy.
426.98	Of course, it comes back to consent.
430.18	Here's the idea.
431.42	Before anyone can distribute
431.42	your private information,
435.26	they should have to get your permission.
438.06	This idea of affirmative consent
438.06	comes from anti-rape activists
442.9	who tell us that we need consent
442.9	for every sexual act.
446.7	And we have really high standards
446.7	for consent in a lot of other areas.
451.3	Think about having surgery.
453.18	Your doctor has to make sure
454.82	that you are meaningfully and knowingly
454.82	consenting to that medical procedure.
459.34	This is not the type of consent
459.34	like with an iTunes Terms of Service
463.06	where you just scroll to the bottom
463.06	and you're like, agree, agree, whatever.
466.74	(Laughter)
468.98	If we think more about consent,
468.98	we can have better privacy laws.
474.26	Right now, we just don't have
474.26	that many protections.
477.7	If your ex-husband or your ex-wife
477.7	is a terrible person,
481.3	they can take your nude photos
481.3	and upload them to a porn site.
485.54	It can be really hard
485.54	to get those images taken down.
488.78	And in a lot of states,
490.02	you're actually better off
490.02	if you took the images of yourself
493.86	because then you can
493.86	file a copyright claim.
497.14	(Laughter)
499.22	Right now, if someone
499.22	violates your privacy,
502.22	whether that's an individual
502.22	or a company or the NSA,
507.1	you can try filing a lawsuit,
509.86	though you may not be successful
512.02	because many courts assume
512.02	that digital privacy is just impossible.
516.82	So they're not willing
516.82	to punish anyone for violating it.
521.02	I still hear people
521.02	asking me all the time,
523.94	isn't a digital image somehow blurring
523.94	the line between public and private
529.26	because it's digital, right?
531.42	No! No!
532.78	Everything digital
532.78	is not just automatically public.
536.14	That doesn't make any sense.
538.06	As NYU legal scholar
538.06	Helen Nissenbaum tells us,
541.58	we have laws and policies and norms
544.22	that protect all kinds
544.22	of information that's private,
547.38	and it doesn't make a difference
547.38	if it's digital or not.
550.82	All of your health records are digitized
553.5	but your doctor can't
553.5	just share them with anyone.
556.66	All of your financial information
556.66	is held in digital databases,
561.14	but your credit card company can't
561.14	just post your purchase history online.
566.9	Better laws could help address
566.9	privacy violations after they happen,
572.38	but one of the easiest things
572.38	we can all do is make personal changes
576.78	to help protect each other's privacy.
580.18	We're always told that privacy
582.1	is our own, sole,
582.1	individual responsibility.
585.18	We're told, constantly monitor
585.18	and update your privacy settings.
589.46	We're told, never share anything
589.46	you wouldn't want the entire world to see.
595.22	This doesn't make sense.
596.46	Digital media are social environments
599.46	and we share things
599.46	with people we trust all day, every day.
604.58	As Princeton researcher
604.58	Janet Vertesi argues,
607.58	our data and our privacy,
607.58	they're not just personal,
611.62	they're actually interpersonal.
614.22	And so one thing you can do
614.22	that's really easy
617.5	is just start asking for permission before
617.5	you share anyone else's information.
622.62	If you want to post a photo
622.62	of someone online, ask for permission.
627.18	If you want to forward an email thread,
629.66	ask for permission.
631.06	And if you want to share
631.06	someone's nude selfie,
633.86	obviously, ask for permission.
637.38	These individual changes can really
637.38	help us protect each other's privacy,
641.86	but we need technology companies
641.86	on board as well.
646.18	These companies have very little
646.18	incentive to help protect our privacy
650.7	because their business models
650.7	depend on us sharing everything
654.02	with as many people as possible.
656.9	Right now, if I send you an image,
658.86	you can forward that
658.86	to anyone that you want.
661.98	But what if I got to decide
661.98	if that image was forwardable or not?
666.26	This would tell you, you don't
666.26	have my permission to send this image out.
670.34	We do this kind of thing all the time
670.34	to protect copyright.
674.5	If you buy an e-book, you can't just
674.5	send it out to as many people as you want.
679.3	So why not try this with mobile phones?
682.78	What you can do is we can demand
682.78	that tech companies add these protections
687.58	to our devices and our platforms
687.58	as the default.
691.34	After all, you can choose
691.34	the color of your car,
694.78	but the airbags are always standard.
699.9	If we don't think more
699.9	about digital privacy and consent,
703.74	there can be serious consequences.
707.18	There was a teenager from Ohio --
709.46	let's call her Jennifer,
709.46	for the sake of her privacy.
712.94	She shared nude photos of herself
712.94	with her high school boyfriend,
716.54	thinking she could trust him.
719.54	Unfortunately, he betrayed her
721.5	and sent her photos
721.5	around the entire school.
724.5	Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated,
728.62	but instead of being compassionate,
728.62	her classmates harassed her.
732.78	They called her a slut and a whore
734.66	and they made her life miserable.
737.18	Jennifer started missing school
737.18	and her grades dropped.
741.34	Ultimately, Jennifer decided
741.34	to end her own life.
746.54	Jennifer did nothing wrong.
749.26	All she did was share a nude photo
751.54	with someone she thought
751.54	that she could trust.
754.38	And yet our laws tell her
757.02	that she committed a horrible crime
757.02	equivalent to child pornography.
761.74	Our gender norms tell her
763.26	that by producing
763.26	this nude image of herself,
766.5	she somehow did the most
766.5	horrible, shameful thing.
770.22	And when we assume that privacy
770.22	is impossible in digital media,
774.46	we completely write off and excuse
774.46	her boyfriend's bad, bad behavior.
781.02	People are still saying all the time
781.02	to victims of privacy violations,
786.78	"""What were you thinking?"
788.06	"You should have never sent that image."""
791.46	If you're trying to figure out
791.46	what to say instead, try this.
795.98	Imagine you've run into your friend
795.98	who broke their leg skiing.
800.06	They took a risk to do something fun,
800.06	and it didn't end well.
804.66	But you're probably
804.66	not going to be the jerk who says,
807.22	"""Well, I guess you shouldn't"
807.22	"have gone skiing then."""
811.9	If we think more about consent,
814.06	we can see that victims
814.06	of privacy violations
817.34	deserve our compassion,
819.1	not criminalization, shaming,
819.1	harassment or punishment.
824.26	We can support victims,
824.26	and we can prevent some privacy violations
828.78	by making these legal,
828.78	individual and technological changes.
833.66	Because the problem is not sexting,
833.66	the issue is digital privacy.
839.5	And one solution is consent.
842.5	So the next time a victim
842.5	of a privacy violation comes up to you,
847.1	instead of blaming them,
847.1	let's do this instead:
849.86	let's shift our ideas
849.86	about digital privacy,
853.3	and let's respond with compassion.
856.5	Thank you.
857.74	(Applause)
