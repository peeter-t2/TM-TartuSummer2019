12.715	For over a decade as a doctor,
14.464	I've cared for homeless veterans,
17.13	for working-class families.
19.185	I've cared for people who 
19.185	live and work in conditions
23.406	that can be hard, if not harsh,
25.855	and that work has led me to believe
27.608	that we need a fundamentally different way
29.553	of looking at healthcare.
31.787	We simply need a healthcare system
33.193	that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms
35.294	that bring people into clinics,
36.973	but instead actually is able to look
39.85	and improve health where it begins.
42.445	And where health begins
43.932	is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,
46.692	but where we live
48.102	and where we work,
50.321	where we eat, sleep, learn and play,
53.473	where we spend the majority of our lives.
56.9	So what does this different 
56.9	approach to healthcare look like,
59.568	an approach that can improve health where it begins?
62.794	To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.
66.601	Veronica was the 17th patient
68.32	out of my 26-patient day
70.227	at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.
73.174	She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.
75.693	This headache had been going on
76.856	for a number of years, and this particular episode
78.809	was very, very troubling.
81.26	In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us
83.974	for the first time, she went to an 
83.974	emergency room in Los Angeles.
87.13	The emergency room doctors said,
89.597	"""We've run some tests, Veronica."
91.555	The results are normal, so
91.555	here's some pain medication,
94.267	and follow up with a primary care doctor,
96.786	but if the pain persists or if it worsens,
98.529	"then come on back."""
100.258	Veronica followed those standard instructions
103.35	and she went back.
105.1	She went back not just once, but twice more.
108.333	In the three weeks before Veronica met us,
110.791	she went to the emergency room three times.
112.94	She went back and forth,
114.807	in and out of hospitals and clinics,
116.506	just like she had done in years past,
118.272	trying to seek relief but still coming up short.
121.712	Veronica came to our clinic,
123.84	and despite all these encounters
123.84	with healthcare professionals,
126.472	Veronica was still sick.
129.304	When she came to our clinic, though, 
129.304	we tried a different approach.
132.925	Our approach started with our medical assistant,
135.562	someone who had a GED-level training
137.609	but knew the community.
138.959	Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.
141.08	"She asked, ""What's your chief complaint?"""
143.532	"""Headache."""
145.821	"""Let's get your vital signs"" —"
147.115	measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,
149.624	but let's also ask something equally as vital
151.637	to Veronica and a lot of patients like her
153.707	in South Los Angeles.
155.514	"""Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?"
158.155	Specifically, about your housing conditions?
159.908	Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?
162.361	"Do you have roaches in your home?"""
164.518	Turns out, Veronica said yes
164.518	to three of those things:
166.925	roaches, water leaks, mold.
169.232	I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,
172.347	and I turned the handle on the door
173.674	and I entered the room.
175.666	You should understand that Veronica,
177.116	like a lot of patients that I have
177.116	the privilege of caring for,
179.569	is a dignified person, a formidable presence,
182.292	a personality that's larger than life,
184.125	but here she was
185.925	doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.
188.76	Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.
192.944	She lifted her head up,
194.293	and I saw her face, said hello,
197.4	and then I immediately noticed something
198.659	across the bridge of her nose,
200.331	a crease in her skin.
202.416	In medicine, we call that crease the allergic salute.
205.735	It's usually seen among children
205.735	who have chronic allergies.
208.547	It comes from chronically rubbing
208.547	one's nose up and down,
211.303	trying to get rid of those allergy symptoms,
213.609	and yet, here was Veronica, a grown woman,
215.646	with the same telltale sign of allergies.
218.435	A few minutes later, in asking
218.435	Veronica some questions,
221.38	and examining her and listening to her,
223.329	"I said, ""Veronica, I think I know what you have."
226.134	I think you have chronic allergies,
228.188	and I think you have migraine
228.188	headaches and some sinus congestion,
230.451	and I think all of those are 
230.451	"related to where you live."""
233.989	She looked a little bit relieved,
235.733	because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,
237.708	"but I said, ""Veronica, now let's"
237.708	talk about your treatment.
239.945	We're going to order some
239.945	medications for your symptoms,
243.387	but I also want to refer you to
243.387	"a specialist, if that's okay."""
246.92	Now, specialists are a little hard to find
249.226	in South Central Los Angeles,
251.028	"so she gave me this look, like, ""Really?"""
253.714	"And I said, ""Veronica, actually,"
253.714	the specialist I'm talking about
256.391	is someone I call a community health worker,
258.677	someone who, if it's okay with you,
260.318	can come to your home
261.1	and try to understand what's going on
262.83	with those water leaks and that mold,
264.188	trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,
268.226	and if required, that specialist might refer you
270.318	to another specialist that we
270.318	call a public interest lawyer,
272.81	because it might be that your landlord
274.503	"isn't making the fixes he's required to make."""
277.776	Veronica came back in a few months later.
279.903	She agreed to all of those treatment plans.
282.715	She told us that her symptoms
282.715	had improved by 90 percent.
285.761	She was spending more time at work
287.627	and with her family and less time
289.513	shuttling back and forth between
289.513	the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.
294.123	Veronica had improved remarkably.
296.335	Her sons, one of whom had asthma,
298.329	were no longer as sick as they used to be.
300.104	She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,
302.491	Veronica's home was better too.
306.166	What was it about this different approach we tried
308.01	that led to better care,
311.604	fewer visits to the E.R., better health?
315.163	Well, quite simply, it started with that question:
317.26	"""Veronica, where do you live?"""
320.251	But more importantly, it was that we put in place
322.627	a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions
325.197	to Veronica and hundreds more like her
327.498	about the conditions that mattered
329.357	in her community, about where health,
331.195	and unfortunately sometimes illness, do begin
334.147	in places like South L.A.
335.9	In that community, substandard housing
338.129	and food insecurity are the major conditions
339.67	that we as a clinic had to be aware of,
341.492	but in other communities it could be
343.22	transportation barriers, obesity,
345.3	access to parks, gun violence.
348.685	The important thing is, we put in place a system
350.919	that worked,
352.283	and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.
354.554	It's a term many of you are familiar with.
356.227	It comes from a parable that's very common
358.344	in the public health community.
360.663	This is a parable of three friends.
363.273	Imagine that you're one of these three friends
365.44	who come to a river.
367.02	It's a beautiful scene, but it's
367.02	shattered by the cries of a child,
370.38	and actually several children,
370.38	in need of rescue in the water.
373.357	So you do hopefully what everybody would do.
375.25	You jump right in along with your friends.
377.041	The first friend says, I'm going to rescue those
378.83	who are about to drown,
380.163	those at most risk of falling over the waterfall.
382.199	The second friends says,
382.199	I'm going to build a raft.
384.134	I'm going to make sure that fewer people
385.934	need to end up at the waterfall's edge.
387.419	Let's usher more people to safety
388.721	by building this raft,
389.883	coordinating those branches together.
391.739	Over time, they're successful, but not really,
394.11	as much as they want to be.
395.012	More people slip through, and they finally look up
397.273	and they see that their third friend
398.543	is nowhere to be seen.
399.96	They finally spot her.
401.391	She's in the water. She's swimming away from them
403.427	upstream, rescuing children as she goes,
405.8	"and they shout to her, ""Where are you going?"
407.105	"There are children here to save."""
408.646	And she says back,
410.143	"""I'm going to find out"
411.372	"who or what is throwing these children in the water."""
415.43	In healthcare, we have that first friend —
418.329	we have the specialist,
419.404	we have the trauma surgeon, the ICU nurse,
421.95	the E.R. doctors.
422.974	We have those people that are vital rescuers,
425.515	people you want to be there
425.515	when you're in dire straits.
428.92	We also know that we have the second friend —
431.179	we have that raft-builder.
432.874	That's the primary care clinician,
434.585	people on the care team who are there
436.743	to manage your chronic conditions,
438.333	your diabetes, your hypertension,
439.874	there to give you your annual checkups,
441.28	there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,
443.485	but also there to make sure that you have
445.15	a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.
448.626	But while that's also vital and very necessary,
450.393	what we're missing is that third friend.
452.237	We don't have enough of that upstreamist.
454.352	The upstreamists are the health care professionals
456.013	who know that health does begin
458.3	where we live and work and play,
460.291	but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize
462.823	the resources to create the system
465.11	in their clinics and in their hospitals
466.918	that really does start to approach that,
470.304	to connect people to the resources they need
472.306	outside the four walls of the clinic.
474.98	Now you might ask, and it's 
474.98	a very obvious question
476.648	that a lot of colleagues in medicine ask:
479.303	"""Doctors and nurses thinking"
479.303	about transportation and housing?
482.449	Shouldn't we just provide pills and procedures
484.759	"and just make sure we focus on the task at hand?"""
486.491	Certainly, rescuing people at the water's edge
489.337	is important enough work.
492.454	Who has the time?
493.725	I would argue, though, that if we
493.725	were to use science as our guide,
496.616	that we would find an upstream
496.616	approach is absolutely necessary.
499.349	Scientists now know that
501.104	the living and working conditions that we all
503.354	are part of
504.99	have more than twice the impact on our health
507.38	than does our genetic code,
509.507	and living and working conditions,
510.84	the structures of our environments,
512.226	the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,
515.695	and the impact those have on our behaviors,
517.877	all together, those have more than five times
520.19	the impact on our health
521.155	than do all the pills and procedures
523.164	administered by doctors and hospitals combined.
525.213	All together, living and working conditions
528.384	account for 60 percent of preventable death.
532.48	Let me give you an example of what this feels like.
534.06	Let's say there was a company, a tech startup
536.663	"that came to you and said, ""We have a great product."
538.564	It's going to lower your risk
538.564	"of death from heart disease."""
541.388	Now, you might be likely to invest
543.289	if that product was a drug or a device,
546.473	but what if that product was a park?
549.211	A study in the U.K.,
550.767	a landmark study that reviewed the records
552.851	of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,
556.192	looked at several variables,
558.02	controlled for a lot of factors, and found that
560.587	when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,
564.67	one's exposure to green
564.67	space was a powerful influence.
567.701	The closer you were to green space,
569.58	to parks and trees,
570.922	the lower your chance of heart disease,
572.417	and that stayed true for rich and for poor.
575.224	That study illustrates what my friends in public health
577.544	often say these days:
579.042	that one's zip code matters more
581.11	than your genetic code.
582.786	We're also learning that zip code
584.235	is actually shaping our genetic code.
586.67	The science of epigenetics looks
586.67	at those molecular mechanisms,
589.887	those intricate ways in which
589.887	our DNA is literally shaped,
592.92	genes turned on and off
594.488	based on the exposures to the environment,
596.682	to where we live and to where we work.
599.426	So it's clear that these factors,
601.283	these upstream issues, do matter.
603.366	They matter to our health,
605.069	and therefore our healthcare professionals
605.069	should do something about it.
607.562	And yet, Veronica asked me
609.33	perhaps the most compelling question
610.289	I've been asked in a long time.
611.697	In that follow-up visit, she said,
613.835	"""Why did none of my doctors"
615.987	ask about my home before?
618.865	In those visits to the emergency room,
621.069	I had two CAT scans,
622.87	I had a needle placed in the lower part of my back
624.827	to collect spinal fluid,
626.357	I had nearly a dozen blood tests.
627.831	I went back and forth, I saw
627.831	all sorts of people in healthcare,
630.485	"and no one asked about my home."""
634.77	The honest answer is that in healthcare,
636.508	we often treat symptoms without addressing
638.203	the conditions that make you sick in the first place.
641.323	And there are many reasons for that, but the big three
643.167	are first, we don't pay for that.
647.767	In healthcare, we often pay 
647.767	for volume and not value.
651.152	We pay doctors and hospitals usually
652.94	for the number of services they provide,
654.92	but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.
658.219	That leads to a second phenomenon that I call
660.53	"the ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach"
661.91	to upstream issues in healthcare.
664.484	We don't ask about where you
664.484	live and where you work,
666.228	because if there's a problem there,
667.453	we don't know what to tell you.
670.349	It's not that doctors don't know
670.349	these are important issues.
673.169	In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,
675.04	over 1,000 physicians,
678.743	they know that their patients' upstream problems
680.441	are as important as their health issues,
682.328	as their medical problems,
684.02	and yet despite that widespread awareness
686.381	of the importance of upstream issues,
688.315	only one in five doctors said they had
690.588	any sense of confidence to address those issues,
693.453	to improve health where it begins.
695.301	There's this gap between knowing
696.843	that patients' lives, the context
696.843	of where they live and work,
699.272	matters, and the ability to do something about it
702.08	in the systems in which we work.
703.857	This is a huge problem right now,
706.191	because it leads them to this next question, which is,
708.339	whose responsibility is it?
709.926	And that brings me to that third point,
711.635	that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.
714.909	Part of the reason that we have this conundrum
716.495	is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists
720.25	in the healthcare system.
722.295	There are not nearly enough of that third friend,
724.195	that person who is going to find out
725.959	who or what is throwing those kids in the water.
728.816	Now, there are many upstreamists,
730.521	and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,
732.962	in Los Angeles and in other parts of the country
735.589	and around the world,
737.357	and it's important to note that upstreamists
739.785	sometimes are doctors, but they need not be.
742.322	They can be nurses, other clinicians,
744.515	care managers, social workers.
746.523	It's not so important what specific degree
748.475	upstreamists have at the end of their name.
750.274	What's more important is that they all seem
752.03	to share the same ability to implement a process
756.455	that transforms their assistance,
758.244	transforms the way they practice medicine.
760.59	That process is a quite simple process.
762.176	It's one, two and three.
764.549	First, they sit down and they say,
766.2	let's identify the clinical problem
768.224	among a certain set of patients.
769.567	Let's say, for instance,
771.31	let's try to help children
773.244	who are bouncing in and out of the hospital
775.048	with asthma.
777.13	After identifying the problem, they 
777.13	then move on to that second step,
779.641	and they say, let's identify the root cause.
782.38	Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,
786.171	usually says, well, let's look at your genes,
787.886	let's look at how you're behaving.
790.344	Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.
792.424	Eat healthier.
793.44	It's a pretty simplistic
794.835	approach to root cause analyses.
796.241	It turns out, it doesn't really work
797.906	when we just limit ourselves that worldview.
800.37	The root cause analysis that an upstreamist brings
802.471	to the table is to say, let's look at the living
804.408	and the working conditions in your life.
807.76	Perhaps, for children with asthma,
809.842	it's what's happening in their home,
811.45	or perhaps they live close to a
811.45	freeway with major air pollution
814.386	that triggers their asthma.
816.21	And perhaps that's what we should
816.21	mobilize our resources to address,
818.83	because that third element,
818.83	that third part of the process,
821.203	is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.
823.734	They mobilize the resources to create a solution,
825.973	both within the clinical system,
827.694	and then by bringing in people from public health,
830.03	from other sectors, lawyers,
831.372	whoever is willing to play ball,
833.319	let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,
835.402	to take those patients who
835.402	actually have clinical problems
838.212	and address their root causes together
840.395	by linking them to the resources you need.
842.937	It's clear to me that there are so many stories
844.714	of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.
847.2	The problem is that there's just not
847.2	nearly enough of them out there.
849.86	By some estimates, we need one upstreamist
852.443	for every 20 to 30 clinicians
852.443	in the healthcare system.
855.389	In the U.S., for instance, that would mean
856.644	that we need 25,000 upstreamists
858.74	by the year 2020.
862.207	But we only have a few thousand upstreamists
862.207	out there right now, by all accounts,
866.317	and that's why, a few years ago, my colleagues and I
868.87	said, you know what, we need to train
870.787	and make more upstreamists.
872.76	So we decided to start an organization
874.466	called Health Begins,
876.684	and Health Begins simply does that:
878.43	We train upstreamists.
879.39	And there are a lot of measures
879.39	that we use for our success,
881.328	but the main thing that we're interested in
882.689	is making sure that we're changing
884.601	the sense of confidence,
886.14	"that ""don't ask, don't tell"" metric among clinicians."
888.045	We're trying to make sure that clinicians,
890.344	and therefore their systems that they work in
892.284	have the ability, the confidence
894.579	to address the problems in the living
897.254	and working conditions in our lives.
900.261	We're seeing nearly a tripling
902.24	of that confidence in our work.
903.821	It's remarkable,
905.124	but I'll tell you the most compelling part
907.038	of what it means to be working
908.607	with upstreamists to gather them together.
913.09	What is most compelling is that every day,
915.413	every week, I hear stories just like Veronica's.
919.184	There are stories out there of Veronica
921.662	and many more like her,
923.581	people who are coming to the healthcare system
925.462	and getting a glimpse of what it feels like
926.84	to be part of something that works,
929.4	a health care system that stops
929.4	bouncing you back and forth
931.873	but actually improves your health,
933.694	listens to you who you are,
934.821	addresses the context of your life,
937.124	whether you're rich or poor or middle class.
941.489	These stories are compelling because
943.144	not only do they tell us that we're this close
945.124	to getting the healthcare system that we want,
947.71	but that there's something
947.71	that we can all do to get there.
950.459	Doctors and nurses can get better at asking
952.321	about the context of patients' lives,
954.165	not simply because it's better bedside manner,
956.676	but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.
959.758	Healthcare systems and payers
962.1	can start to bring in public health agencies
964.89	and departments and say,
966.305	let's look at our data together.
967.843	Let's see if we can discover some patterns
967.843	in our data about our patients' lives
971.369	and see if we can identify an upstream cause,
973.84	and then, as importantly, can we align the resources
976.401	to be able to address them?
978.737	Medical schools, nursing schools,
980.131	all sorts of health professional education programs
982.427	can help by training the
982.427	next generation of upstreamists.
986.183	We can also make sure that these schools
987.938	certify a backbone of the upstream approach,
991.166	and that's the community health worker.
993.361	We need many more of them
993.361	in the healthcare system
994.88	if we're truly going to have it be effective,
997.233	to move from a sickcare system
998.74	to a healthcare system.
1000.238	But finally, and perhaps most importantly,
1002.286	what do we do? What do we do as patients?
1004.845	We can start by simply going to our doctors
1007.11	and our nurses, to our clinics,
1008.819	"and asking, ""Is there something in where I live"
1011.151	"and where I work that I should be aware of?"""
1013.494	Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,
1016.342	and more importantly, if there are barriers
1018.3	that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you
1020.281	and I'm saying I think have a problem with
1022.4	my apartment or at my workplace
1024.503	or I don't have access to transportation,
1026.699	or there's a park that's way too far,
1028.33	so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice
1030.19	to go and jog,
1032.276	if those problems exist,
1034.157	then doctor, are you willing to listen?
1037.453	And what can we do together
1038.866	to improve my health where it begins?
1041.436	If we're all able to do this work,
1043.88	doctors and healthcare systems,
1045.419	payers, and all of us together,
1047.499	we'll realize something about health.
1049.693	Health is not just a personal
1049.693	responsibility or phenomenon.
1053.115	Health is a common good.
1056.617	It comes from our personal investment in knowing
1058.535	that our lives matter,
1060.816	the context of where we live and where we work,
1062.944	eat, and sleep, matter,
1064.68	and that what we do for ourselves,
1066.304	we also should do for those
1068.424	whose living and working conditions
1070.44	again, can be hard, if not harsh.
1073.058	We can all invest in making sure that we improve
1075.544	the allocation of resources upstream,
1077.794	but at the same time work together
1079.977	and show that we can move healthcare
1082.71	upstream.
1084.747	We can improve health where it begins.
1087.82	Thank you.
1089.847	(Applause)
