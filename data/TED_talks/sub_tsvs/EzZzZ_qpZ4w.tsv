15.451	I live in South Central.
18.924	This is South Central:
21.067	liquor stores,
23.937	fast food,
26.312	vacant lots.
28.656	So the city planners, they get together and they figure
30.338	they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,
33.584	so they change it to South Los Angeles,
36.752	like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.
40.634	This is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)
44.344	Liquor stores,
46.512	fast food,
48.824	vacant lots.
51.465	Just like 26.5 million other Americans,
54.936	I live in a food desert,
57.496	South Central Los Angeles,
59.56	home of the drive-thru and the drive-by.
63.761	Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.
69.2	People are dying from curable diseases
71.701	in South Central Los Angeles.
74.536	For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood
77.137	is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,
80.404	which is probably eight, 10 miles away.
84.004	I got tired of seeing this happening.
87.464	And I was wondering, how would you feel
89.572	if you had no access to healthy food,
92.86	if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects
95.74	that the present food system has on your neighborhood?
99.4	I see wheelchairs bought and sold
102.068	like used cars.
104.137	I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.
108.161	And I figured, this has to stop.
111.556	So I figured that the problem is the solution.
117.382	Food is the problem and food is the solution.
121.106	Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip
124.036	to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.
128.244	So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.
132.796	It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.
135.188	It's 150 feet by 10 feet.
138.572	Thing is, it's owned by the city.
141.02	But you have to maintain it.
143.596	"So I'm like, ""Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,"
148.108	"since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."""
151.951	And this is how I decided to maintain it.
154.852	So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together
157.838	and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,
160.19	you know, the whole nine, vegetables.
162.3	What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,
165.271	where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,
170.11	from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,
172.439	and everything we do is free.
174.271	And the garden, it was beautiful.
177.373	And then somebody complained.
179.823	The city came down on me,
182.199	and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,
186.511	which this citation was turning into a warrant.
189.139	"And I'm like, ""Come on, really?"
191.671	A warrant for planting food on a piece of land
194.415	"that you could care less about?"" (Laughter)"
197.827	"And I was like, ""Cool. Bring it."""
200.167	Because this time it wasn't coming up.
203.362	So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it
208.374	and talked to the councilman,
211.491	and one of the Green Grounds members,
213.087	they put up a petition on Change.org,
215.905	and with 900 signatures, we were a success.
218.758	We had a victory on our hands.
220.834	My councilman even called in and said how they endorse
224.331	and love what we're doing.
226.977	I mean, come on, why wouldn't they?
229.501	L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.
234.346	They own 26 square miles of vacant lots.
239.704	That's 20 Central Parks.
242.726	That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
250.045	Why in the hell would they not okay this?
254.998	Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
259.113	When one dollar's worth of green beans
261.822	will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.
265.38	It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.
269.057	Growing your own food is like printing your own money.
272.198	(Applause)
279.198	See, I have a legacy in South Central.
282.07	I grew up there. I raised my sons there.
286.799	And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality
291.062	that was manufactured for me by some other people,
293.926	and I'm manufacturing my own reality.
296.534	See, I'm an artist.
299.046	Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
303.15	Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,
307.726	me, I beautify lawns, parkways.
311.158	I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,
315.068	and the plants and the trees,
317.263	that's my embellishment for that cloth.
320.945	You'd be surprised what the soil could do
326.986	if you let it be your canvas.
328.521	You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is
332.041	and how it affects people.
335.049	So what happened?
337.721	I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,
342.792	a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.
345.818	To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
350.699	We are the soil.
355.239	You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.
360.782	Gardening is the most therapeutic
365.016	and defiant act you can do,
367.96	especially in the inner city.
370.452	Plus you get strawberries.
373.196	(Laughter)
376.654	I remember this time,
379.032	there was this mother and a daughter came,
381.341	it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,
384.808	and I came out and they looked so ashamed.
388.272	So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,
391.96	and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
394.696	This is on the street for a reason.
396.707	It made me feel ashamed to see people
400.198	that were this close to me that were hungry,
402.781	and this only reinforced why I do this,
405.92	"and people asked me, ""Fin, aren't you afraid"
408.889	"people are going to steal your food?"""
410.376	"And I'm like, ""Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it."
412.577	That's why it's on the street.
415.17	That's the whole idea.
417.88	I want them to take it, but at the same time,
419.675	"I want them to take back their health."""
423.678	There's another time when I put
426.221	a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
431.664	These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.
434.615	It was cool, and they just shared the stories
437.24	about how this affected them and how
440.096	they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,
442.888	and it was just cool to see how this changed them,
446.314	if it was only for that one moment.
452.019	So Green Grounds has gone on to plant
454.882	maybe 20 gardens.
456.633	We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins
460.898	and participate, and it's all volunteers.
463.663	If kids grow kale, kids eat kale.
467.29	(Laughter)
468.554	If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)
473.53	But when none of this is presented to them,
476.864	if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,
480.49	they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.
485.034	I see young people
486.939	and they want to work,
490.05	but they're in this thing where they're caught up --
492.171	I see kids of color and they're just on this track
495.778	that's designed for them,
498.713	that leads them to nowhere.
500.746	So with gardening, I see an opportunity
503.421	where we can train these kids
505.567	to take over their communities,
508.564	to have a sustainable life.
512.408	And when we do this, who knows?
514.527	We might produce the next George Washington Carver.
517.751	but if we don't change the composition of the soil,
520.036	we will never do this.
521.645	Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.
524.587	I want to plant a whole block of gardens
528.587	where people can share in the food in the same block.
531.975	I want to take shipping containers
534.236	and turn them into healthy cafes.
536.932	Now don't get me wrong.
539.324	I'm not talking about no free shit,
541.602	because free is not sustainable.
544.955	The funny thing about sustainability,
546.86	you have to sustain it.
548.617	(Laughter) (Applause)
552.774	What I'm talking about is putting people to work,
555.012	and getting kids off the street, and letting them know
558.115	the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,
563.067	opening farmer's markets.
565.405	So what I want to do here,
567.498	we gotta make this sexy.
570.204	So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,
574.444	gangstas, gangsta gardeners.
576.163	We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.
580.499	If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.
582.352	Get gangsta with your shovel, okay?
586.772	And let that be your weapon of choice.
589.956	(Applause)
596.9	So basically, if you want to meet with me,
602.523	you know, if you want to meet,
605.656	don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs
609.453	and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit --
613.259	where you talk about doing some shit.
616.487	If you want to meet with me, come to the garden
619.641	with your shovel so we can plant some shit.
622.921	Peace. Thank you.
626.105	(Applause)
630.249	Thank you. (Applause)
