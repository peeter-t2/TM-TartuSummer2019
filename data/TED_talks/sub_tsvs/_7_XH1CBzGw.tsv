12.946	What is so special about the human brain?
15.34	Why is it that we study other animals
17.552	instead of them studying us?
19.673	What does a human brain have or do
21.471	that no other brain does?
23.204	When I became interested
23.204	in these questions about 10 years ago,
26.052	scientists thought they knew
26.052	what different brains were made of.
28.994	Though it was based on very little evidence,
30.723	many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,
32.91	including the human brain,
34.635	were made in the same way,
35.935	with a number of neurons that was always
37.437	proportional to the size of the brain.
39.668	This means that two brains of the same size,
41.744	like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,
45.292	should have similar numbers of neurons.
47.844	Now, if neurons are the functional
49.64	information processing units of the brain,
52.543	then the owners of these two brains
54.135	should have similar cognitive abilities.
56.864	And yet, one is a chimp,
59.213	and the other is a cow.
61.85	Now maybe cows have a really rich
64.212	internal mental life and are so smart
66.465	that they choose not to let us realize it,
70.268	but we eat them.
71.713	I think most people will agree
73.412	that chimps are capable of much more complex,
75.413	elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.
78.469	So this is a first indication that the
80.401	"""all brains are made the same way"" scenario"
82.434	is not quite right.
84.105	But let's play along.
85.451	If all brains were made the same way
87.229	and you were to compare animals
87.229	with brains of different sizes,
90.141	larger brains should always have more neurons
92.323	than smaller brains,
92.323	and the larger the brain,
94.646	the more cognitively able its owner should be.
97.668	So the largest brain around should also be
99.804	the most cognitively able.
102.093	And here comes the bad news:
103.674	Our brain, not the largest one around.
106.431	It seems quite vexing.
107.986	Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,
110.721	but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,
114.038	and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,
116.623	which is why scientists used to resort to saying
121.361	that our brain must be special
123.518	to explain our cognitive abilities.
126.38	It must be really extraordinary,
129.326	an exception to the rule.
131.303	Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,
134.529	and it could be better, for example,
136.404	in that it seems larger than it should be,
138.515	with a much larger cerebral cortex
138.515	than we should have
141.213	for the size of our bodies.
142.752	So that would give us extra cortex
144.404	to do more interesting things
144.404	than just operating the body.
147.364	That's because the size of the brain
149.043	usually follows the size of the body.
151.376	So the main reason for saying that
153.693	our brain is larger than it should be
155.78	actually comes from comparing ourselves
157.552	to great apes.
159.238	Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,
161.832	so their brains should also be larger than ours,
164.253	but instead it's the other way around.
166.198	Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.
169.133	The human brain also seems special
171.253	in the amount of energy that it uses.
173.5	Although it weighs only two percent of the body,
176.249	it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy
179.692	that your body requires to run per day.
182.155	That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,
185.508	just to keep your brain working.
187.913	So the human brain is larger than it should be,
190.841	it uses much more energy than it should,
192.867	so it's special.
194.325	And this is where the story started to bother me.
196.896	In biology, we look for rules
198.567	that apply to all animals and to life in general,
201.413	so why should the rules of evolution
203.263	apply to everybody else but not to us?
206.905	Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption
209.102	that all brains are made in the same way.
210.973	Maybe two brains of a similar size
212.572	can actually be made of
212.572	very different numbers of neurons.
215.163	Maybe a very large brain
216.77	does not necessarily have more neurons
218.61	than a more modest-sized brain.
220.831	Maybe the human brain 
220.831	actually has the most neurons
223.84	of any brain, regardless of its size,
226.413	especially in the cerebral cortex.
228.507	So this to me became
230.059	the important question to answer:
231.788	how many neurons does the human brain have,
234.188	and how does that compare to other animals?
236.71	Now, you may have heard or read somewhere
239.133	that we have 100 billion neurons,
241.244	so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues
243.33	if they knew where this number came from.
245.169	But nobody did.
246.627	I've been digging through the literature
248.08	for the original reference for that number,
250.138	and I could never find it.
251.921	It seems that nobody had actually ever counted
254.66	the number of neurons in the human brain,
256.194	or in any other brain for that matter.
258.693	So I came up with my own way
258.693	to count cells in the brain,
262.228	and it essentially consists of
264.336	dissolving that brain into soup.
267.581	It works like this:
269.618	You take a brain, or parts of that brain,
272.745	and you dissolve it in detergent,
274.489	which destroys the cell membranes
275.998	but keeps the cell nuclei intact,
278.434	so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei
281.574	that looks like this,
283.355	like a clear soup.
284.628	This soup contains all the nuclei
286.519	that once were a mouse brain.
288.573	Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,
291.603	you can agitate it and make those nuclei
294.501	be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,
296.472	so that now by looking under the microscope
298.453	at just four or five samples
298.453	of this homogeneous solution,
302.536	you can count nuclei, and therefore tell
305.072	how many cells that brain had.
306.751	It's simple, it's straightforward,
308.376	and it's really fast.
309.81	So we've used that method to count neurons
311.807	in dozens of different species so far,
314.118	and it turns out that all brains
315.807	are not made the same way.
318.389	Take rodents and primates, for instance:
320.576	In larger rodent brains, the average size
322.86	of the neuron increases,
324.546	so the brain inflates very rapidly
327.145	and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
330.31	But primate brains gain neurons
332.013	without the average neuron becoming any larger,
334.472	which is a very economical way
335.997	to add neurons to your brain.
337.65	The result is that a primate brain
339.414	will always have more neurons than
339.414	a rodent brain of the same size,
342.581	and the larger the brain,
344.064	the larger this difference will be.
346.278	Well, what about our brain then?
348.381	We found that we have, on average,
354.849	and if you consider that the cerebral cortex
356.93	is the seat of functions like
360.024	awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,
363.161	and that 16 billion is the most neurons
366.145	that any cortex has,
368.766	I think this is the simplest explanation
370.484	for our remarkable cognitive abilities.
373.626	But just as important is what
373.626	the 86 billion neurons mean.
376.847	Because we found that the relationship
378.376	between the size of the brain
378.376	and its number of neurons
380.728	could be described mathematically,
382.355	we could calculate what a human brain
384.573	would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.
387.247	So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons
390.821	would weigh 36 kilos.
393.942	That's not possible.
395.575	A brain that huge would be crushed
397.481	by its own weight,
398.665	and this impossible brain would go
400.252	in the body of 89 tons.
404.023	I don't think it looks like us.
406.157	So this brings us to a very important
406.157	conclusion already,
408.71	which is that we are not rodents.
411.357	The human brain is not a large rat brain.
414.625	Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,
417.253	but that's not a fair comparison to make,
419.473	given that we know that we are not rodents.
421.562	We are primates,
422.952	so the correct comparison is to other primates.
425.726	And there, if you do the math,
426.953	you find that a generic primate
429.739	with 86 billion neurons
431.669	would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,
434.672	which seems just right,
436.561	in a body of some 66 kilos,
438.533	which in my case is exactly right,
441.178	which brings us to a very unsurprising
443.798	but still incredibly important conclusion:
446.767	I am a primate.
448.108	And all of you are primates.
450.806	And so was Darwin.
452.706	I love to think that Darwin
452.706	would have really appreciated this.
455.646	His brain, like ours,
457.613	was made in the image of other primate brains.
461.124	So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,
463.426	but it is not special in its number of neurons.
466.207	It is just a large primate brain.
468.062	I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought
471.106	that should remind us of our place in nature.
474.169	Why does it cost so much energy, then?
476.813	Well, other people have figured out
478.26	how much energy the human brain
479.763	and that of other species costs,
481.17	and now that we knew how many neurons
482.822	each brain was made of, we could do the math.
485.164	And it turns out that both human
487.03	and other brains cost about the same,
489.853	an average of six calories 
489.853	per billion neurons per day.
493.274	So the total energetic cost of a brain
495.413	is a simple, linear function
497.447	of its number of neurons,
499.156	and it turns out that the human brain
501.339	costs just as much energy as you would expect.
505.18	So the reason why the human brain
507.271	costs so much energy is simply because
508.943	it has a huge number of neurons,
510.926	and because we are primates
512.411	with many more neurons for a given body size
514.91	than any other animal,
516.432	the relative cost of our brain is large,
519.972	but just because we're primates,
519.972	not because we're special.
522.973	Last question, then:
524.163	how did we come by this
524.163	remarkable number of neurons,
527.278	and in particular, if great apes
529.178	are larger than we are,
530.733	why don't they have a larger brain 
530.733	than we do, with more neurons?
534.498	When we realized how much expensive it is
536.588	to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,
538.921	maybe there's a simple reason.
540.924	They just can't afford the energy
542.607	for both a large body 
542.607	and a large number of neurons.
545.557	So we did the math.
546.986	We calculated on the one hand
548.586	how much energy a primate gets per day
550.527	from eating raw foods,
551.877	and on the other hand, how much energy
553.914	a body of a certain size costs
555.678	and how much energy a brain of a
555.678	certain number of neurons costs,
559.065	and we looked for the combinations
560.554	of body size and number of brain neurons
562.965	that a primate could afford
564.235	if it ate a certain number of hours per day.
566.783	And what we found is that
568.599	because neurons are so expensive,
570.311	there is a tradeoff between
570.311	body size and number of neurons.
573.681	So a primate that eats eight hours per day
576.632	can afford at most 53 billion neurons,
579.656	but then its body cannot be any bigger
581.383	than 25 kilos.
583.337	To weigh any more than that,
585.038	it has to give up neurons.
586.807	So it's either a large body
589.46	or a large number of neurons.
590.955	When you eat like a primate,
592.32	you can't afford both.
594.556	One way out of this metabolic limitation
596.52	would be to spend even more hours per day eating,
599.921	but that gets dangerous,
601.284	and past a certain point, it's just not possible.
604.003	Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,
605.54	afford about 30 billion neurons
607.463	by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,
610.429	and that seems to be about as much as they can do.
613.545	Nine hours of feeding per day
615.336	seems to be the practical limit for a primate.
618.607	What about us?
620.398	With our 86 billion neurons
621.998	and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,
625.033	we should have to spend over nine hours
628.594	per day every single day feeding,
632.169	which is just not feasible.
634.208	If we ate like a primate,
636.042	we should not be here.
638.295	How did we get here, then?
640.422	Well, if our brain costs just as much energy
643.157	as it should, and if we can't spend
644.88	every waking hour of the day feeding,
648.554	then the only alternative, really,
650.465	is to somehow get more energy
652.423	out of the same foods.
654.376	And remarkably, that matches exactly
658.176	what our ancestors are believed to have invented
661.213	one and a half million years ago,
663.052	when they invented cooking.
665.834	To cook is to use fire
667.804	to pre-digest foods outside of your body.
671.604	Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew
674.21	and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,
676.773	so that allows them to be completely digested
678.925	and absorbed in your gut,
680.361	which makes them yield much more
680.361	energy in much less time.
684.016	So cooking frees time for us to do
686.505	much more interesting things with our day
688.567	and with our neurons
690.047	than just thinking about food,
691.952	looking for food, and gobbling down food
693.656	all day long.
694.881	So because of cooking, what once was
697.38	a major liability, this large,
699.733	dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,
702.766	could now become a major asset,
704.802	now that we could both afford 
704.802	the energy for a lot of neurons
708.056	and the time to do interesting things with them.
710.559	So I think this explains why the human brain
712.533	grew to become so large so fast in evolution,
715.773	all of the while remaining just a primate brain.
719.67	With this large brain now affordable by cooking,
722.444	we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,
725.357	agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,
727.963	electricity, refrigerators,
729.588	all of those things that nowadays
731.195	allow us to get all the energy we need
733.237	for the whole day in a single sitting
736.019	at your favorite fast food joint.
738.973	So what once was a solution
741.41	now became the problem,
743.109	and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.
748.626	So what is the human advantage?
751.182	What is it that we have
752.685	that no other animal has?
755.22	My answer is that we have the largest number
757.568	of neurons in the cerebral cortex,
759.04	and I think that's the simplest explanation
760.884	for our remarkable cognitive abilities.
762.897	And what is it that we do that no other animal does,
766.124	and which I believe was fundamental
768.093	to allow us to reach that large,
771.176	largest number of neurons in the cortex?
773.398	In two words, we cook.
775.613	No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.
779.179	And I think that's how we got to become human.
782.049	Studying the human brain changed 
782.049	the way I think about food.
784.509	I now look at my kitchen,
786.154	and I bow to it,
787.624	and I thank my ancestors for coming up
789.329	with the invention that probably made us humans.
791.229	Thank you very much.
793.361	(Applause)
