12.739	Where do you come from?
14.607	It's such a simple question,
16.678	but these days, of course,
16.678	simple questions
18.861	bring ever more complicated answers.
21.907	People are always asking
21.907	me where I come from,
24.859	and they're expecting me to say India,
28.039	and they're absolutely right
28.039	insofar as 100 percent
31.14	of my blood and ancestry
31.14	does come from India.
34.706	Except, I've never lived
34.706	one day of my life there.
38.771	I can't speak even one word
41.179	of its more than 22,000 dialects.
44.179	So I don't think I've really
44.179	earned the right
46.389	to call myself an Indian.
48.835	"And if ""Where do you come from?"""
50.383	"means ""Where were you born"
50.383	"and raised and educated?"""
53.45	then I'm entirely
53.45	of that funny little country
55.876	known as England,
57.247	except I left England
57.247	as soon as I completed
59.658	my undergraduate education,
61.571	and all the time I was growing up,
63.288	I was the only kid in all my classes
66.084	who didn't begin to look
66.084	like the classic English heroes
69.213	represented in our textbooks.
71.891	"And if ""Where do you come from?"""
73.193	"means ""Where do you pay your taxes?"
74.884	Where do you see your doctor
74.884	"and your dentist?"""
77.432	then I'm very much of the United States,
79.795	and I have been for 48 years now,
82.363	since I was a really small child.
84.451	Except, for many of those years,
86.159	I've had to carry around this
86.159	funny little pink card
88.66	with green lines running through my face
90.589	identifying me as a permanent alien.
93.202	I do actually feel more alien
93.202	the longer I live there.
97.464	(Laughter)
99.651	"And if ""Where do you come from?"""
101.238	"means ""Which place goes deepest inside you"
104.004	and where do you try
104.004	"to spend most of your time?"""
107.184	then I'm Japanese,
108.357	because I've been living as much as I can
110.61	for the last 25 years in Japan.
113.995	Except, all of those years
113.995	I've been there on a tourist visa,
117.048	and I'm fairly sure not many Japanese
119.19	would want to consider me one of them.
122.081	And I say all this just to stress
125.332	how very old-fashioned and straightforward
128.052	my background is,
129.051	because when I go to Hong
129.051	Kong or Sydney or Vancouver,
133.099	most of the kids I meet
134.995	are much more international
134.995	and multi-cultured than I am.
138.794	And they have one home
138.794	associated with their parents,
141.459	but another associated
141.459	with their partners,
144.615	a third connected maybe with the place
144.615	where they happen to be,
148.004	a fourth connected with the place
148.004	they dream of being,
150.918	and many more besides.
153.262	And their whole life will be
153.262	spent taking pieces
156.548	of many different places
156.548	and putting them together
160.035	into a stained glass whole.
162.877	Home for them is really
162.877	a work in progress.
165.318	It's like a project
165.318	on which they're constantly adding
167.914	upgrades and improvements and corrections.
171.048	And for more and more of us,
172.943	home has really less to do
172.943	with a piece of soil
177.398	than, you could say, with a piece of soul.
180.149	If somebody suddenly asks
180.149	"me, ""Where's your home?"""
182.554	I think about my sweetheart
182.554	or my closest friends
185.469	or the songs that travel with me
185.469	wherever I happen to be.
189.736	And I'd always felt this way,
191.593	but it really came home to me, as it were,
194.336	some years ago when
194.336	I was climbing up the stairs
197.054	in my parents' house in California,
199.756	and I looked through the living
199.756	room windows
202.582	and I saw that we were
202.582	encircled by 70-foot flames,
207.76	one of those wildfires
207.76	that regularly tear through
210.246	the hills of California
210.246	and many other such places.
214.077	And three hours later,
214.077	that fire had reduced
217.102	my home and every last thing in it
219.846	except for me to ash.
222.864	And when I woke up the next morning,
225.574	I was sleeping on a friend's floor,
227.265	the only thing I had
227.265	in the world was a toothbrush
229.693	I had just bought
229.693	from an all-night supermarket.
232.26	Of course, if anybody asked me then,
234.166	"""Where is your home?"""
235.525	I literally couldn't point
235.525	to any physical construction.
239.517	My home would have to be whatever
239.517	I carried around inside me.
244.249	And in so many ways, I think
244.249	this is a terrific liberation.
248.241	Because when my grandparents were born,
250.435	they pretty much had their sense of home,
252.962	their sense of community,
252.962	even their sense of enmity,
256.454	assigned to them at birth,
258.379	and didn't have much chance
258.379	of stepping outside of that.
261.357	And nowadays, at least some of us
261.357	can choose our sense of home,
265.064	create our sense of community,
267.222	fashion our sense of self, and in so doing
270.803	maybe step a little beyond
272.94	some of the black and white divisions
274.726	of our grandparents' age.
276.558	No coincidence that the president
278.442	of the strongest nation
278.442	on Earth is half-Kenyan,
281.173	partly raised in Indonesia,
282.78	has a Chinese-Canadian brother-in-law.
286.379	The number of people living
286.379	in countries not their own
289.843	now comes to 220 million,
294.63	and that's an almost unimaginable number,
297.244	but it means that if you took
297.244	the whole population of Canada
300.994	and the whole population of Australia
302.91	and then the whole population
302.91	of Australia again
305.22	and the whole population of Canada again
307.862	and doubled that number,
309.545	you would still have
309.545	fewer people than belong
311.712	to this great floating tribe.
313.919	And the number of us who live outside
315.705	the old nation-state categories
315.705	is increasing so quickly,
319.789	by 64 million just in the last 12 years,
323.419	that soon there will be more
323.419	of us than there are Americans.
326.899	Already, we represent
326.899	the fifth-largest nation on Earth.
331.573	And in fact, in Canada's largest
331.573	city, Toronto,
334.429	the average resident today
334.429	is what used to be called
338.119	a foreigner, somebody born
338.119	in a very different country.
342.211	And I've always felt that the beauty
342.211	of being surrounded by the foreign
346	is that it slaps you awake.
347.597	You can't take anything for granted.
350.401	Travel, for me, is a little bit
350.401	like being in love,
353.135	because suddenly all your senses
353.135	"are at the setting marked ""on."""
357.192	Suddenly you're alert to the secret
357.192	patterns of the world.
361.193	The real voyage of discovery,
361.193	as Marcel Proust famously said,
365.509	consists not in seeing new sights,
368.507	but in looking with new eyes.
370.877	And of course, once you have new eyes,
372.843	even the old sights, even your home
375.28	become something different.
377.957	Many of the people living
377.957	in countries not their own
380.775	are refugees who never
380.775	wanted to leave home
383.858	and ache to go back home.
386.574	But for the fortunate among us,
388.221	I think the age of movement brings
388.221	exhilarating new possibilities.
392.502	Certainly when I'm traveling,
393.567	especially to the major
393.567	cities of the world,
395.881	the typical person I meet today
398.006	will be, let's say, a half-Korean,
398.006	half-German young woman
402.551	living in Paris.
404.254	And as soon as she meets a half-Thai,
407.312	half-Canadian young guy from Edinburgh,
410.526	she recognizes him as kin.
413.003	She realizes that she probably
413.003	has much more in common with him
417.342	than with anybody entirely
417.342	of Korea or entirely of Germany.
420.935	So they become friends. They fall in love.
423.693	They move to New York City.
425.971	(Laughter)
428.134	Or Edinburgh.
429.52	And the little girl
429.52	who arises out of their union
432.794	will of course be not Korean or German
434.925	or French or Thai or Scotch or Canadian
437.468	or even American, but a wonderful
439.573	and constantly evolving
439.573	mix of all those places.
443.707	And potentially, everything about the way
446.472	that young woman dreams about the world,
449.221	writes about the world,
449.221	thinks about the world,
452.267	could be something different,
454.237	because it comes out of this
454.237	almost unprecedented
457.432	blend of cultures.
459.405	Where you come from now
459.405	is much less important
462.489	than where you're going.
464.137	More and more of us
464.137	are rooted in the future
466.533	or the present tense
466.533	as much as in the past.
469.829	And home, we know, is not just the place
472.392	where you happen to be born.
474.502	It's the place where you become yourself.
478.975	And yet,
481.397	there is one great problem with movement,
484.062	and that is that it's really
484.062	hard to get your bearings
487.273	when you're in midair.
488.891	Some years ago, I noticed
488.891	that I had accumulated
492.177	one million miles
492.177	on United Airlines alone.
495.699	You all know that crazy system,
497.749	six days in hell, you get
497.749	the seventh day free.
501.477	(Laughter)
504.983	And I began to think that really,
507.259	movement was only as good
507.259	as the sense of stillness
510.538	that you could bring to it
510.538	to put it into perspective.
514.385	And eight months
514.385	after my house burned down,
517.239	I ran into a friend who taught
517.239	at a local high school,
519.961	"and he said, ""I've got"
519.961	"the perfect place for you."""
523.493	"""Really?"" I said. I'm"
523.493	always a bit skeptical
525.501	when people say things like that.
526.979	"""No, honestly,"" he went on,"
528.349	"""it's only three hours away by car,"
530.195	and it's not very expensive,
531.809	and it's probably not like anywhere
531.809	"you've stayed before."""
535.389	"""Hmm."" I was beginning to get"
535.389	"slightly intrigued. ""What is it?"""
539.588	"""Well —"" Here my friend hemmed and hawed —"
542.367	"""Well, actually"
542.367	"it's a Catholic hermitage."""
545.949	This was the wrong answer.
547.915	I had spent 15 years in Anglican schools,
550.462	so I had had enough hymnals
550.462	and crosses to last me a lifetime.
555.06	Several lifetimes, actually.
557.331	But my friend assured me
557.331	that he wasn't Catholic,
559.889	nor were most of his students,
561.342	but he took his classes
561.342	there every spring.
564.123	And as he had it,
564.123	even the most restless, distractible,
568.886	testosterone-addled
572.92	only had to spend three days in silence
576.156	and something in him cooled
576.156	down and cleared out.
580.41	He found himself.
582.719	"And I thought, ""Anything"
582.719	that works for a 15-year-old boy
585.458	"ought to work for me."""
586.797	So I got in my car,
586.797	and I drove three hours north
590.407	along the coast,
591.883	and the roads grew emptier and narrower,
594.443	and then I turned
594.443	onto an even narrower path,
597.207	barely paved, that snaked for two miles
600.847	up to the top of a mountain.
603.37	And when I got out of my car,
606.209	the air was pulsing.
608.579	The whole place was absolutely silent,
610.439	but the silence wasn't
610.439	an absence of noise.
613.899	It was really a presence of a kind
613.899	of energy or quickening.
617.94	And at my feet was the great,
617.94	still blue plate
621.451	of the Pacific Ocean.
623.705	All around me were 800
623.705	acres of wild dry brush.
628.139	And I went down to the room
628.139	in which I was to be sleeping.
630.925	Small but eminently comfortable,
632.65	it had a bed and a rocking chair
634.859	and a long desk and even longer
634.859	picture windows
638.033	looking out on a small,
638.033	private, walled garden,
642.322	and then 1,200 feet of golden pampas grass
645.522	running down to the sea.
648.514	And I sat down, and I began to write,
651.683	and write, and write,
653.187	even though I'd gone there
653.187	really to get away from my desk.
656.8	And by the time I got up,
656.8	four hours had passed.
661.294	Night had fallen,
663.423	and I went out under this great
663.423	overturned saltshaker of stars,
668.179	and I could see the tail lights of cars
670.431	disappearing around the headlands
674.644	And it really seemed
674.644	like my concerns of the previous day
678.352	vanishing.
680.302	And the next day, when I woke up
682.114	in the absence of telephones
682.114	and TVs and laptops,
685.582	the days seemed to stretch
685.582	for a thousand hours.
689.735	It was really all the freedom
689.735	I know when I'm traveling,
693.434	but it also profoundly
693.434	felt like coming home.
698.048	And I'm not a religious person,
699.664	so I didn't go to the services.
701.165	I didn't consult the monks for guidance.
703.734	I just took walks along the monastery road
706.514	and sent postcards to loved ones.
708.863	I looked at the clouds,
710.697	and I did what is hardest
710.697	of all for me to do usually,
715.022	which is nothing at all.
717.516	And I started to go back to this place,
719.824	and I noticed that I was doing
719.824	my most important work there
723.392	invisibly just by sitting still,
726.923	and certainly coming
726.923	to my most critical decisions
730.048	the way I never could when I was racing
732.33	from the last email
732.33	to the next appointment.
734.903	And I began to think that something in me
737.532	had really been crying out for stillness,
739.521	but of course I couldn't hear it
741.069	because I was running around so much.
742.855	I was like some crazy guy
742.855	who puts on a blindfold
745.508	and then complains
745.508	that he can't see a thing.
748.739	And I thought back
748.739	to that wonderful phrase
751.28	I had learned as a boy from Seneca,
753.652	"in which he says, ""That man is poor"
757.31	not who has little but who hankers
757.31	"after more."""
762.683	And, of course, I'm not suggesting
764.775	that anybody here go into a monastery.
766.609	That's not the point.
768.201	But I do think
768.201	it's only by stopping movement
771.919	that you can see where to go.
774.215	And it's only by stepping
774.215	out of your life and the world
777.82	that you can see what you
777.82	most deeply care about
781.389	and find a home.
783.795	And I've noticed so many people now
785.838	take conscious measures
785.838	to sit quietly for 30 minutes
788.926	every morning just collecting themselves
791.459	in one corner of the room
791.459	without their devices,
794.019	or go running every evening,
796.092	or leave their cell phones behind
798.048	when they go to have a long
798.048	conversation with a friend.
801.965	Movement is a fantastic privilege,
805.134	and it allows us to do so
805.134	much that our grandparents
808.491	could never have dreamed of doing.
810.612	But movement, ultimately,
812.517	only has a meaning if you
812.517	have a home to go back to.
817.058	And home, in the end, is of course
819.849	not just the place where you sleep.
822.717	It's the place where you stand.
825.356	Thank you.
826.813	(Applause)
