16.273	I want to talk about my investigations
18.835	into what technology means in our lives --
23.403	not just our immediate life,
23.403	but in the cosmic sense,
26.635	in the kind of long history of the world
29.801	and our place in the world.
32.404	What is this stuff?
34.302	What is the significance?
35.786	And so, I want to kind of
35.786	go through my little story
39.718	of what I found out.
40.988	One of the first things
40.988	I started to investigate
43.299	was the history of the name of technology.
46.134	In the United States,
46.134	there is a State of the Union address
49.112	given by every president since 1790.
52.031	And each one of those is kind of
52.031	summing up the most important things
57.093	for the United States at that time.
58.823	"If you search for the word ""technology,"""
58.823	it was not used until 1952.
64.133	So, technology was sort of absent
64.133	from everybody's thinking until 1952,
68.255	which happened to be the year of my birth.
70.33	And obviously, technology
70.33	had existed before then,
73.347	but we weren't aware of it.
74.776	And so it was sort of an awakening
74.776	of this force in our life.
79.398	I actually did research to find out
79.398	"the first use of the word ""technology."""
83.635	It was in 1829,
85.635	and it was invented by a guy
85.635	who was starting a curriculum --
88.635	a course, bringing together all the kinds
88.635	of arts and crafts, and industry --
93.285	"and he called it ""Technology."""
95.27	And that's the very first use of the word.
97.777	So what is this stuff
99.967	that we're all consumed by
99.967	and bothered by?
105.278	"Alan Kay calls it, ""Technology"
105.278	is anything that was invented
108.224	"after you were born."""
109.477	(Laughter)
110.509	Which is sort of the idea we normally
110.509	have about what technology is:
114.968	it's all that new stuff.
116.635	It's not roads, or penicillin,
118.862	or factory tires; it's the new stuff.
122.649	My friend Danny Hillis
122.649	says kind of a similar one,
125.196	"he says, ""Technology is anything"
125.196	"that doesn't work yet."""
127.899	(Laughter)
128.938	Which is, again,
128.938	a sense that it's all new.
131.002	But we know that it's just not new.
132.734	It actually goes way back,
134.044	and what I want to suggest is,
134.044	it goes a long way back.
138.169	So, another way to think
138.169	about technology, what it means,
140.961	is to imagine a world without technology.
143.009	If we were to eliminate every single bit
143.009	of technology in the world today --
146.694	and I mean everything,
146.694	from blades to scrapers to cloth --
151.635	we, as a species,
151.635	would not live very long.
154.394	We would die by the billions,
154.394	and very quickly:
157.395	the wolves would get us,
157.395	we would be defenseless,
160.724	we would be unable to grow
160.724	enough food or find enough food.
163.941	Even the hunter-gatherers
163.941	used some elementary tools.
167.401	So, they had minimal technology,
169.757	but they had some technology.
171.463	And if we study
171.463	those hunter-gatherer tribes
174.62	and the Neanderthal,
174.62	which are very similar to early man,
178.296	we find out a very curious thing
178.296	about this world without technology,
181.607	and this is a kind of a curve
181.607	of their average age.
184.46	There are no Neanderthal fossils
184.46	that are older than 40 years old
188.939	that we've ever found,
190.574	and the average age of most of these
190.574	hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.
194.828	There are very few young infants,
194.828	because they die -- high mortality rate --
199.753	and there's very few old people.
201.325	So the profile is sort of for your average
201.325	San Francisco neighborhood:
204.929	a lot of young people.
206.358	And if you go there, you say,
206.358	"""Hey, everybody's really healthy."""
209.446	Well, that's because they're all young.
211.374	Same thing with the hunter-gatherer
211.374	tribes and early man:
214.129	you didn't live beyond the age of 30.
215.948	So it was a world without grandparents.
217.949	And grandparents are very important,
220.006	because they are the transmitter
220.006	of cultural evolution and information.
223.669	Imagine a world where basically
223.669	everybody was 20 to 30 years old.
226.829	How much learning can you do?
228.497	You can't do very much
228.497	learning in your own life,
230.856	it's so short,
232.178	and there's nobody to pass on
232.178	what you do learn.
234.556	So that's one aspect.
237.527	It was a very short life.
238.867	But at the same time, anthropologists know
241.683	that most hunter-gatherer
241.683	tribes of the world,
244.287	with that very little technology,
245.973	actually did not spend a very long time
245.973	gathering the food they needed:
249.483	three to six hours a day.
251.09	Some anthropologists call that
251.09	the original affluent society,
255.135	because they had
255.135	bankers' hours, basically.
257.525	So it was possible to get enough food.
260.183	But when the scarcity came,
262.708	when the highs and lows
262.708	and the droughts came,
265.015	then people went into starvation.
267.572	And that's why they didn't live very long.
269.644	So what technology brought,
272.083	through the very simple tools
272.083	like these stone tools here --
276.683	even something as small as this --
278.52	the early bands of humans were actually
278.52	able to eliminate to extinction
283.949	about 250 megafauna animals
283.949	in North America
289.065	when they first arrived 10,000 years ago.
291.278	So, long before the industrial age,
293.943	we've been affecting
293.943	the planet on a global scale
296.635	with just a small amount of technology.
298.79	The other thing that the early man
298.79	invented was fire.
302.11	And fire was used to clear out, and again,
304.259	affected the ecology of grass
304.259	and whole continents,
307.931	and was used in cooking.
310.353	It enabled us to actually
310.353	eat all kinds of things.
312.832	It was, in a certain sense,
312.832	in a McLuhan sense,
315.11	an external stomach,
317.242	in the sense that it was cooking food
317.242	that we could not eat otherwise.
320.761	And if we didn't have fire,
320.761	we actually could not live.
323.529	Our bodies have adapted
323.529	to these new diets.
326.695	Our bodies have changed
326.695	in the last 10,000 years.
329.514	So, with that little bit of technology,
332.594	humans went from a small band
332.594	of 10,000 or so --
334.894	the same number
334.894	as Neanderthals everywhere --
337.067	and we suddenly exploded.
338.329	With the invention of language
338.329	around 50,000 years ago,
340.954	the number of humans exploded,
342.471	and very quickly became
342.471	the dominant species on the planet.
345.619	And they migrated
345.619	into the rest of the world
348.085	at two kilometers per year
349.549	until, within several tens
349.549	of thousands of years,
352.55	we occupied every single
352.55	watershed on the planet
354.849	and became the most dominant species,
356.691	with a very small amount of technology.
359.078	And even at that time,
359.078	with the introduction of agriculture,
362.182	8,000, 10,000 years ago,
363.916	we started to see climate change.
365.635	So climate change is not a new thing;
365.635	what's new is just the degree of it.
369.243	Even during the agricultural age,
369.243	there was climate change.
372.342	So already, small amounts of technology
372.342	were transforming the world.
376.102	And what this means, and where I'm going,
378.787	is that technology has become
378.787	the most powerful force in the world.
382.635	All the things we see today
382.635	that are changing our lives,
385.586	we can always trace back
386.797	to the introduction
386.797	of some new technology.
388.886	So it's a force,
390.215	that is the most powerful force
390.215	that has been unleashed on this planet,
394.31	and in such a degree,
396.143	that I think it's become who we are.
402.388	In fact, our humanity and everything
402.388	that we think about ourselves,
405.667	is something we've invented.
407.159	So we've invented ourselves.
408.59	Of all the animals
408.59	that we've domesticated,
410.732	the most important animal has been us.
414.093	So humanity is our greatest invention,
417.635	but of course, we're not done yet.
419.635	We're still inventing,
420.821	and this is what technology
420.821	is allowing us to do;
423.183	it's continually to reinvent ourselves.
425.243	It's a very, very strong force.
427.69	I call this entire thing --
427.69	us humans as our technology,
430.849	everything that we've made,
430.849	gadgets in our lives --
433.635	we call that the technium.
434.922	That's this world.
436.106	My working definition of technology is:
438.035	anything useful that a human mind makes.
440.432	It's not just hammers
440.432	and gadgets, like laptops.
443.114	But it's also law.
444.559	And, of course, cities are ways
444.559	to make things more useful to us.
449.726	While this is something
449.726	that comes from our mind,
452.215	it also has its roots
452.215	deeply into the cosmos.
456.532	It goes back.
457.719	The origins and roots of technology
457.719	go back to the Big Bang,
460.606	in this way, in that they are part
460.606	of this self-organizing thread
465.118	that starts at the Big Bang
465.118	and goes through galaxies and stars,
469.697	into life, into us.
471.279	And the three major phases
471.279	of the early universe
473.931	was energy, when the dominant
473.931	force was energy;
476.177	then the dominant force,
476.177	as it cooled, became matter;
479.241	and then, with the invention
479.241	of life four billion years ago,
482.635	the dominant force in our neighborhood
482.635	became information.
485.445	That's what life is:
486.653	an information process
486.653	that was restructuring
488.837	and making new order.
490.083	So, energy and matter,
490.083	Einstein showed were equivalent,
493.724	and now new sciences of quantum computing
493.724	show that entropy and information
499.368	and matter and energy
500.842	are all interrelated.
502.03	So it's one long continuum.
504.464	You put energy
504.464	into the right kind of system,
507.683	and out comes wasted heat, entropy,
510.781	and extropy, which is order.
513.635	It's the increased order.
514.989	Where does this order come from?
516.566	Its roots go way back.
517.861	We actually don't know.
519.218	But we do know
520.454	that the self-organization trend
520.454	throughout the universe is long,
524.773	and it began with things like galaxies;
527.02	they maintained their order
527.02	for billions of years.
529.538	Stars are basically
529.538	nuclear fission machines
533.412	that self-organize and self-sustain
533.412	themselves for billions of years:
536.735	order against the extropy of the world.
538.89	And flowers and plants
538.89	are the same thing, extended,
543.824	and technology is basically
543.824	an extension of life.
549.483	One trend that we notice
549.483	in all those things
552.485	is that the amount of energy
552.485	per gram per second
555.081	that flows through this
556.388	is actually increasing.
557.703	The amount of energy is increasing
557.703	through this little sequence.
562.306	And the amount of energy per gram
562.306	per second that flows through life
566.307	is actually greater than a star --
568.308	because of the star's long lifespan,
571.635	the energy density in life
571.635	is actually higher than a star.
574.848	And the energy density
574.848	that we see in the greatest amount
577.731	anywhere in the universe
578.961	is actually in a PC chip.
580.318	There is more energy flowing
580.318	through, per gram per second,
583.492	than anything that we have
583.492	any other experience with.
586.634	And so, what I would suggest
588.287	is that if you want to see
588.287	where technology is going,
591.252	we continue that trajectory,
592.908	"and we say, ""Well, it's going"
592.908	to become more energy-dense,
595.785	"that's where it's going."""
597.026	And so what I've done is,
597.026	I've taken the same kinds of things
600.018	and looked at other aspects
600.018	of evolutionary life and say,
603.308	"""What are the general trends"
603.308	"in evolutionary life?"""
605.938	And there are things moving
605.938	towards greater complexity,
608.684	moving towards greater diversity,
608.684	moving towards greater specialization,
612.635	sentience, ubiquity,
612.635	and most important, evolvability.
616.901	Those very same things
616.901	are also present in technology.
620.448	That's where technology is going.
622.321	In fact, technology
622.321	is accelerating all the aspects of life.
627.635	And we can see that happening;
629.157	just as there's diversity in life,
629.157	there's more diversity in things we make.
633.332	Things in life start off
633.332	being general cells,
635.506	and they become specialized:
636.911	you have tissue cells,
636.911	muscle, brain cells.
639.072	The same thing happens
639.072	with, say, a hammer,
641.126	which is general at first
641.126	and becomes more specific.
643.635	So I would like to say
643.635	that while there are six kingdoms of life,
646.755	we can think of technology
646.755	basically as a seventh kingdom of life.
650.36	It's a branching off from the human form.
652.715	But technology has its own agenda,
652.715	like anything, like life itself.
656.635	For instance, right now,
656.635	three-quarters of the energy that we use
659.801	is actually used to feed
659.801	the technium itself.
661.957	In transportation, it's not to move us;
663.873	it's to move the stuff we make or buy.
665.766	"I use the word ""want."" Technology wants."
667.767	This is a robot that wants to plug
667.767	itself in to get more power.
670.793	Your cat wants more food.
673.396	A bacterium, which has
673.396	no consciousness at all,
675.983	wants to move towards light.
677.635	It has an urge,
677.635	and technology has an urge.
680.347	At the same time,
680.347	it wants to give us things,
682.515	and what it gives us
682.515	is basically progress.
685.093	You can take all kinds of curves,
685.093	and they're all pointing up.
688.189	There's really no dispute about progress,
690.635	if we discount the cost of that.
693.635	And that's the thing
693.635	that bothers most people,
695.85	is that progress is really real,
695.85	but we wonder and question:
699.738	What are the environmental costs of it?
701.635	I did a survey of the number
701.635	of species of artifacts in my house,
705.486	and there's 6,000.
706.668	Other people have come up with 10,000.
708.761	When King Henry of England died,
711.225	he had 18,000 things in his house,
713.303	but that was the entire
713.303	wealth of England, so ...
716.804	(Laughter)
718.038	And with that entire wealth of England,
720.568	King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,
723.518	he could not buy refrigeration,
725.092	he could not buy
725.092	a trip of a thousand miles,
727.249	whereas this rickshaw wallah in India
727.249	could save up and buy antibiotics
731.737	and he could buy refrigeration.
733.504	He could buy things that King Henry,
733.504	in all his wealth, could never buy.
736.999	That's what progress is about.
738.69	So, technology is selfish;
738.69	technology is generous.
741.635	That conflict, that tension,
741.635	will be with us forever:
744.855	sometimes it wants to do
744.855	what it wants to do,
747.077	and sometimes it's going
747.077	to do things for us.
749.221	We have confusion
749.221	about what we should think
751.312	about a new technology.
752.635	Right now the default position
752.635	when a new technology comes along,
756.489	is people talk about
756.489	the precautionary principle,
758.838	which is very common in Europe,
760.748	"which says, basically, ""Don't do anything."
762.819	When you meet a new technology, stop,
765.457	until it can be proven
765.457	"that it does no harm."""
768.01	I think that really leads nowhere.
770.279	But a better way is
770.279	what I call the proactionary principle,
773.304	which is, you engage with technology.
775.734	You try it out.
777.136	You obviously do what the precautionary
777.136	principle suggests,
781.376	you try to anticipate it,
782.645	but after anticipating it,
784.096	you constantly asses it,
785.635	not just once, but eternally.
787.222	And when it diverts from what you want,
790.423	we prioritize risk,
790.423	we evaluate not just the new stuff,
793.608	but the old stuff.
794.791	We fix it; but most importantly,
796.685	we relocate it.
797.866	And what I mean by that is,
799.714	we find a new job for it.
801.446	Nuclear energy, fission,
801.446	is a really bad idea for bombs.
805.48	But it may be a pretty good idea
805.48	relocated into sustainable nuclear energy
810.899	for electricity, instead of burning coal.
813.241	When we have a bad idea,
814.98	the response to a bad idea
816.568	is not no ideas,
816.568	it's not to stop thinking.
819.912	The response to a bad idea --
822.089	like, say, a tungsten lightbulb --
824.241	is a better idea.
826.973	So, better ideas
826.973	is really always the response
830.477	to technology we don't like;
831.866	it's basically better technology.
834.459	And actually, in a certain sense,
834.459	technology is a kind of a method
838.303	for generating better ideas,
839.882	if you can think about it that way.
841.635	So, maybe spraying DDT
841.635	on crops is a really bad idea.
844.754	But DDT sprayed on local homes --
847.635	there's nothing better
847.635	to eliminate malaria,
850.635	besides insect DDT-impregnated
850.635	mosquito nets.
854.397	But that's a really good idea;
854.397	that's a good job for technology.
857.752	So our job as humans
857.752	is to parent our mind children,
861.635	to find them good friends,
863.103	to find them a good job.
864.519	And so, every technology
864.519	is sort of a creative force
867.351	looking for the right job.
869.395	That's actually my son, right here.
871.51	(Laughter)
872.857	There are no bad technologies,
875.373	just as there are no bad children.
877.093	We don't say children are neutral;
877.093	children are positive.
879.999	We just have to find them the right place.
882.35	And so, what technology gives us
882.35	over the long term --
886.328	over this sort of extended evolution
886.328	from the beginning of time,
889.993	through the invention
889.993	of the plants and animals,
893.635	and the evolution of life,
893.635	the evolution of brains --
896.635	what that is constantly giving us
896.635	is increasing differences:
900.57	It's increasing diversity,
900.57	it's increasing options,
903.049	it's increasing choices, opportunities,
903.049	possibilities and freedoms.
907.051	That's what we get
907.051	from technology all the time.
909.999	That's why people leave villages
909.999	and go into cities --
912.839	because they are always gravitating
912.839	towards increased choices
916.512	and possibilities.
917.773	And we are aware of the price;
920.426	we pay a price for that,
920.426	but we're aware of it,
922.689	and generally, we will pay the price
922.689	for increased freedoms,
925.668	choices and opportunities.
927.565	Even technology wants clean water.
930.297	Is technology diametrically
930.297	opposed to nature?
934.502	Because technology
934.502	is an extension of life,
937.384	it's in parallel and aligned
937.384	with the same things
940.251	that life wants.
942.134	So that I think technology loves biology,
944.333	if we allow it to.
946.491	Great movement
946.491	starting billions of years ago
950.635	is moving through us
950.635	and it continues to go,
952.963	and our choice, so to speak,
952.963	in technology,
956.4	is really to align ourselves
956.4	with this force
958.495	much greater than ourselves.
959.903	So, technology is more
959.903	than just the stuff in your pocket;
962.735	it's more than just gadgets,
964.15	it's more than just things
964.15	that people invent.
966.639	It's actually part of a very long
966.639	story -- a great story --
970.05	that began billions of years ago.
971.707	It's moving through us,
971.707	this self-organization,
974.038	and we're extending and accelerating it,
976.039	and we can be part of it by aligning
976.039	the technology that we make with it.
979.827	And I really appreciate
979.827	your attention today.
982.689	Thank you.
983.872	(Applause)
