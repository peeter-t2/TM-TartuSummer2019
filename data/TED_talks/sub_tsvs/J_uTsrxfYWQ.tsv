16.26	In the last 50 years,
18.26	we've been building the suburbs
20.26	with a lot of unintended consequences.
22.26	And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences
25.26	and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects
28.26	that I think give us tremendous reasons
31.26	to be really optimistic
33.26	that the big design and development project of the next 50 years
36.26	is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
39.26	So whether it's redeveloping dying malls
42.26	or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores
45.26	or reconstructing wetlands
47.26	out of parking lots,
49.26	I think the fact is
51.26	the growing number
53.26	of empty and under-performing,
55.26	especially retail, sites
57.26	throughout suburbia
59.26	gives us actually a tremendous opportunity
62.26	to take our least-sustainable
64.26	landscapes right now
66.26	and convert them into
68.26	more sustainable places.
70.26	And in the process, what that allows us to do
73.26	is to redirect a lot more of our growth
75.26	back into existing communities
77.26	that could use a boost,
79.26	and have the infrastructure in place,
81.26	instead of continuing
83.26	to tear down trees
85.26	and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
87.26	So why is this important?
90.26	I think there are any number of reasons,
93.26	and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
96.26	Just from the perspective of climate change,
99.26	the average urban dweller in the U.S.
101.26	has about one-third the carbon footprint
104.26	of the average suburban dweller,
107.26	mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,
110.26	and living in detached buildings,
113.26	you have that much more exterior surface
115.26	to leak energy out of.
118.26	So strictly from
120.26	a climate change perspective,
123.26	the cities are already
125.26	relatively green.
127.26	The big opportunity
129.26	to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
131.26	is actually in urbanizing
133.26	the suburbs.
135.26	All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,
138.26	we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
141.26	It's increased our dependence
143.26	on foreign oil
145.26	despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
147.26	We're just driving so much more;
149.26	we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
151.26	Public health is another reason
153.26	to consider retrofitting.
155.26	Researchers at the CDC and other places
158.26	have increasingly been linking
160.26	suburban development patterns
162.26	with sedentary lifestyles.
164.26	And those have been linked then
166.26	with the rather alarming,
168.26	growing rates of obesity,
170.26	shown in these maps here,
173.26	and that obesity has also been triggering
175.26	great increases in heart disease
177.26	and diabetes
179.26	to the point where a child born today
181.26	has a one-in-three chance
183.26	of developing diabetes.
185.26	And that rate has been escalating at the same rate
188.26	as children not walking
190.26	to school anymore,
192.26	again, because of our development patterns.
194.26	And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.
198.26	I mean, how affordable is it
201.26	to continue to live in suburbia
204.26	with rising gas prices?
206.26	Suburban expansion to cheap land,
209.26	for the last 50 years --
211.26	you know the cheap land out on the edge --
213.26	has helped generations of families
215.26	enjoy the American dream.
217.26	But increasingly,
219.26	the savings promised
221.26	by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --
223.26	which is basically our model --
225.26	those savings are wiped out
227.26	when you consider the transportation costs.
230.26	For instance, here in Atlanta,
232.26	about half of households
234.26	make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,
237.26	and they are spending 29 percent of their income
240.26	on housing
242.26	and 32 percent
244.26	on transportation.
246.26	I mean, that's 2005 figures.
248.26	That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
251.26	You know, none of us
253.26	really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
256.26	and they're not going down
258.26	any time soon.
260.26	Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy
263.26	or you hate its soulless commercial strips,
265.26	there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
268.26	But is it practical?
270.26	I think it is.
272.26	June Williamson and I have been researching this topic
274.26	for over a decade,
276.26	and we've found over 80
278.26	varied projects.
281.26	But that they're really all market driven,
283.26	and what's driving the market in particular --
286.26	number one -- is major demographic shifts.
289.26	We all tend to think of suburbia
292.26	as this very family-focused place,
295.26	but that's really not the case anymore.
298.26	Since 2000,
300.26	already two-thirds of households in suburbia
303.26	did not have kids in them.
306.26	We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
309.26	The reasons for this have a lot to with
312.26	the dominance of the two big
314.26	demographic groups right now:
316.26	the Baby Boomers retiring --
319.26	and then there's a gap,
321.26	Generation X, which is a small generation.
323.26	They're still having kids --
325.26	but Generation Y hasn't even started
328.26	hitting child-rearing age.
330.26	They're the other big generation.
333.26	So as a result of that,
335.26	demographers predict
337.26	that through 2025,
342.26	will not have kids in them.
345.26	And the market research, consumer research,
348.26	asking the Boomers and Gen Y
350.26	what it is they would like,
352.26	what they would like to live in,
354.26	tells us there is going to be a huge demand --
357.26	and we're already seeing it --
360.26	for more urban lifestyles
363.26	within suburbia.
366.26	That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,
369.26	and Gen Y would like to live
371.26	an urban lifestyle,
373.26	but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
376.26	The other big dynamic of change
379.26	is the sheer performance of
381.26	underperforming asphalt.
383.26	Now I keep thinking this would be a great name
385.26	for an indie rock band,
387.26	but developers generally use it
390.26	to refer to underused parking lots --
393.26	and suburbia is full of them.
396.26	When the postwar suburbs were first built
399.26	out on the cheap land
401.26	away from downtown,
403.26	it made sense to just build
405.26	surface parking lots.
407.26	But those sites have now been leapfrogged
409.26	and leapfrogged again,
411.26	as we've just continued to sprawl,
413.26	and they now have
416.26	a relatively central location.
418.26	It no longer just makes sense.
421.26	That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
424.26	It now makes sense to go back in,
426.26	build a deck and build up
429.26	on those sites.
431.26	So what do you do
433.26	with a dead mall,
435.26	dead office park?
437.26	It turns out, all sorts of things.
440.26	In a slow economy like ours,
442.26	re-inhabitation is
444.26	one of the more popular strategies.
446.26	So this happens to be
448.26	a dead mall in St. Louis
450.26	that's been re-inhabited as art-space.
453.26	It's now home to artist studios,
455.26	theater groups, dance troupes.
457.26	It's not pulling in as much tax revenue
459.26	as it once was,
461.26	but it's serving its community.
463.26	It's keeping the lights on.
465.26	It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
468.26	Other malls have been re-inhabited
470.26	as nursing homes,
472.26	as universities,
474.26	and as all variety of office space.
476.26	We also found a lot of examples
478.26	of dead big-box stores
480.26	that have been converted into
482.26	all sorts of community-serving uses as well --
485.26	lots of schools, lots of churches
488.26	and lots of libraries like this one.
490.26	This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,
493.26	that is now a public library.
497.26	In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,
500.26	they tore up some of the parking spaces,
502.26	put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,
505.26	put in a lot more sidewalks
508.26	to connect to the neighborhoods.
510.26	And they've made this,
512.26	what was just a store along a commercial strip,
515.26	into a community gathering space.
518.26	This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center
521.26	in Phoenix, Arizona.
523.26	Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,
526.26	a gourmet grocery,
528.26	and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
531.26	Never underestimate the power of food
534.26	to turn a place around
536.26	and make it a destination.
538.26	It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
541.26	The real estate ads in the neighborhood
544.26	all very proudly proclaim,
546.26	"""Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"""
549.26	because it provided its neighborhood
552.26	with what sociologists like to call
554.26	"""a third place."""
556.26	If home is the first place
558.26	and work is the second place,
560.26	the third place is where you go to hang out
562.26	and build community.
564.26	And especially as suburbia is becoming
566.26	less centered on the family,
568.26	the family households,
570.26	there's a real hunger
572.26	for more third places.
575.26	So the most dramatic retrofits
578.26	are really those in the next category,
580.26	the next strategy: redevelopment.
582.26	Now, during the boom, there were several
584.26	really dramatic redevelopment projects
586.26	where the original building
588.26	was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt
591.26	at significantly greater density,
593.26	a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
596.26	But some of them have been much more incremental.
598.26	This is Mashpee Commons,
600.26	the oldest retrofit that we've found.
602.26	And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,
605.26	built urbanism
607.26	on top of its parking lots.
609.26	So the black and white photo shows
611.26	the simple 60's strip shopping center.
613.26	And then the maps above that
615.26	show its gradual transformation
617.26	into a compact,
619.26	mixed-use New England village,
622.26	and it has plans now that have been approved
625.26	for it to connect
628.26	to new residential neighborhoods
630.26	across the arterials
632.26	and over to the other side.
634.26	So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
636.26	Sometimes, it's all at once.
639.26	This is another infill project on the parking lots,
642.26	this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
645.26	When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs
648.26	and opened a station nearby to this site,
651.26	the owners decided
653.26	to build a new parking deck
656.26	and then insert on top of their surface lots
659.26	a new Main Street, several apartments
662.26	and condo buildings,
664.26	while keeping the existing office buildings.
666.26	Here is the site in 1940:
669.26	It was just a little farm
671.26	in the village of Hyattsville.
673.26	By 1980, it had been subdivided
675.26	into a big mall on one side
677.26	and the office park on the other
679.26	and then some buffer sites for a library
681.26	and a church to the far right.
683.26	Today, the transit,
685.26	the Main Street and the new housing
687.26	have all been built.
689.26	Eventually, I expect that the streets
691.26	will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
694.26	Plans have already been announced
696.26	for a lot of those garden apartments
698.26	above the mall to be redeveloped.
701.26	Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
704.26	So here's what it looks like.
706.26	You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings
708.26	in between the office buildings
710.26	and the public space and the new Main Street.
713.26	This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
715.26	I think they really built an attractive place here
718.26	and have just employed all-green construction.
721.26	There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs
724.26	as well as wind turbines.
726.26	This was a very large mall
728.26	on a hundred-acre superblock.
730.26	It's now 22
732.26	walkable urban blocks
734.26	with public streets,
736.26	two public parks, eight bus lines
738.26	and a range of housing types,
740.26	and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado
743.26	the downtown
745.26	that this particular suburb never had.
748.26	Here was the mall in its heyday.
750.26	They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
753.26	So here's the site in 1975
756.26	with the mall.
758.26	By 1995, the mall has died.
760.26	The department store has been kept --
762.26	and we found this was true in many cases.
764.26	The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
766.26	They're easy to be re-adapted.
768.26	But the one story stuff ...
770.26	that's really history.
773.26	So here it is at projected build-out.
776.26	This project, I think, has great connectivity
778.26	to the existing neighborhoods.
780.26	It's providing 1,500 households with the option
782.26	of a more urban lifestyle.
784.26	It's about two-thirds built out right now.
787.26	Here's what the new Main Street looks like.
789.26	It's very successful,
791.26	and it's helped to prompt --
793.26	eight of the 13
795.26	regional malls in Denver
797.26	have now, or have announced plans to
799.26	be, retrofitted.
801.26	But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting
804.26	is not occurring --
806.26	just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
809.26	No, it's pockets of walkability
812.26	on the sites of
814.26	under-performing properties.
816.26	And so it's giving people more choices,
819.26	but it's not taking away choices.
822.26	But it's also not really enough
824.26	to just create pockets of walkability.
827.26	You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
830.26	We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
833.26	So this is one that has been
835.26	retrofitted in California.
837.26	They took the commercial strip
839.26	shown on the black-and-white images below,
841.26	and they built a boulevard
843.26	that has become the Main Street for their town.
846.26	And it's transformed from being
848.26	an ugly, unsafe,
850.26	undesirable address,
852.26	to becoming a beautiful,
855.26	attractive, dignified sort of good address.
858.26	I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;
860.26	they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
863.26	I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there
866.26	without tearing down another tree.
869.26	So there's a lot of great things,
871.26	but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
874.26	But densification
876.26	is not going to work everywhere.
878.26	Sometimes re-greening
880.26	is really the better answer.
883.26	There's a lot to learn from successful
885.26	landbanking programs
887.26	in cities like Flint, Michigan.
889.26	There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --
891.26	sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
894.26	But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects
897.26	is the opportunity to restore
899.26	the local ecology,
901.26	as in this example outside of Minneapolis.
903.26	When the shopping center died,
905.26	the city restored the site's
907.26	original wetlands,
909.26	creating lakefront property,
911.26	which then attracted private investment,
914.26	the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood
917.26	in over 40 years.
919.26	So they've managed to both restore the local ecology
922.26	and the local economy at the same time.
925.26	This is another re-greening example.
927.26	It also makes sense in very strong markets.
929.26	This one in Seattle
931.26	is on the site of a mall parking lot
933.26	adjacent to a new transit stop.
935.26	And the wavy line
937.26	is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
940.26	The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
943.26	But daylighting our creeks
945.26	really improves their water quality
947.26	and contributions to habitat.
949.26	So I've shown you some of
951.26	the first generation of retrofits.
953.26	What's next?
955.26	I think we have three challenges for the future.
958.26	The first is to plan retrofitting
961.26	much more systemically
963.26	at the metropolitan scale.
965.26	We need to be able to target
967.26	which areas really should be re-greened.
969.26	Where should we be redeveloping?
971.26	And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
974.26	These slides just show two images
976.26	from a larger project
978.26	that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
980.26	I led a team that was asked to imagine
982.26	Atlanta 100 years from now.
985.26	And we chose to try to reverse sprawl
988.26	through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.
991.26	One, in a hundred years,
993.26	transit on all major
995.26	rail and road corridors.
997.26	Two, in a hundred years,
999.26	thousand foot buffers
1001.26	on all stream corridors.
1003.26	It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
1006.26	In a hundred years,
1008.26	subdivisions that simply end up too close to water
1010.26	or too far from transit won't be viable.
1013.26	And so we've created the eco-acre
1016.26	transfer-to-transfer development rights
1018.26	to the transit corridors
1020.26	and allow the re-greening
1022.26	of those former subdivisions
1024.26	for food and energy production.
1028.26	So the second challenge
1031.26	is to improve the architectural design quality
1034.26	of the retrofits.
1036.26	And I close with this image
1038.26	of democracy in action:
1041.26	This is a protest that's happening
1043.26	on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland
1046.26	on an Astroturf town green.
1050.26	Now, retrofits are often accused
1052.26	of being examples of faux downtowns
1055.26	and instant urbanism,
1058.26	and not without reason; you don't get much more phony
1060.26	than an Astroturf town green.
1063.26	I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
1066.26	They are new but trying to look old.
1069.26	They have urban streetscapes,
1071.26	but suburban parking ratios.
1073.26	Their populations are
1075.26	more diverse than typical suburbia,
1078.26	but they're less diverse than cities.
1080.26	And they are
1082.26	public places,
1084.26	but that are managed by private companies.
1087.26	And just the surface appearance
1090.26	are often -- like the Astroturf here --
1093.26	they make me wince.
1096.26	So, you know, I mean I'm glad that
1098.26	the urbanism is doing its job.
1100.26	The fact that a protest is happening
1103.26	really does mean
1105.26	that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,
1108.26	compromised as it may be,
1110.26	is still a really great thing.
1112.26	But we've got to get the architecture better.
1114.26	The final challenge is for all of you.
1117.26	I want you to join the protest
1119.26	and start demanding
1121.26	more sustainable suburban places --
1123.26	more sustainable places, period.
1126.26	But culturally,
1128.26	we tend to think that downtowns
1130.26	should be dynamic, and we expect that.
1132.26	But we seem to have an expectation
1134.26	that the suburbs should forever remain frozen
1136.26	in whatever adolescent form
1138.26	they were first given birth to.
1140.26	It's time to let them grow up,
1143.26	so I want you
1145.26	to all support the zoning changes,
1147.26	the road diets, the infrastructure improvements
1150.26	and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
1153.26	Thank you.
