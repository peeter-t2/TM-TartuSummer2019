12.78	I was 14 years old
14.86	inside of a bowling alley,
16.46	burglarizing an arcade game,
19.02	and upon exiting the building
20.82	a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
23.58	I ran down the street,
23.58	and I jumped on top of a fence.
26.58	And when I got to the top,
28.22	the weight of 3,000 quarters
28.22	in my book bag
30.42	pulled me back down to the ground.
32.7	So when I came to, the security guard
32.7	was standing on top of me,
35.78	"and he said, ""Next time you little punks"
35.78	"steal something you can carry."""
39.22	(Laughter)
41.26	I was taken to juvenile hall
43.42	and when I was released
43.42	into the custody of my mother,
46.9	the first words my uncle said was,
46.9	"""How'd you get caught?"""
49.9	"I said, ""Man, the book bag was too heavy."""
52.1	"He said, ""Man, you weren't supposed"
52.1	"to take all the quarters."""
55.06	"I said, ""Man, they were small."
55.06	"What am I supposed to do?"""
57.9	And 10 minutes later, he took me
57.9	to burglarize another arcade game.
62.82	We needed gas money to get home.
65.1	That was my life.
67.26	I grew up in Oakland, California,
69.14	with my mother and members
69.14	of my immediate family
71.5	addicted to crack cocaine.
73.38	My environment consisted
73.38	of living with family, friends,
78.78	and homeless shelters.
80.86	Oftentimes, dinner was served
80.86	in breadlines and soup kitchens.
85.26	The big homey told me this:
87.14	money rules the world
89.14	and everything in it.
90.38	And in these streets, money is king.
93.14	And if you follow the money,
94.78	it'll lead you to the bad guy
94.78	or the good guy.
97.9	Soon after, I committed my first crime,
100.46	and it was the first time
100.46	that I was told that I had potential
103.46	and felt like somebody believed in me.
106.06	Nobody ever told me
106.06	that I could be a lawyer,
108.22	doctor or engineer.
109.9	I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
109.9	I couldn't read, write or spell.
113.34	I was illiterate.
114.58	So I always thought
114.58	crime was my way to go.
119.3	And then one day
121.02	I was talking to somebody
122.3	and he was telling me
122.3	about this robbery that we could do.
126.58	And we did it.
128.9	The reality was that I was growing up
130.74	in the strongest
130.74	financial nation in the world,
132.98	the United States of America,
134.86	while I watched my mother
134.86	stand in line at a blood bank
140.5	to sell her blood for 40 dollars
140.5	just to try to feed her kids.
145.14	She still has the needle marks
145.14	on her arms to day to show for that.
149.3	So I never cared about my community.
151.06	They didn't care about my life.
152.58	Everybody there was doing what they
152.58	were doing to take what they wanted,
156.02	the drug dealers,
156.02	the robbers, the blood bank.
158.22	Everybody was taking blood money.
159.86	So I got mine by any means necessary.
161.78	I got mine.
163.38	Financial literacy
163.38	really did rule the world,
166.5	and I was a child slave to it
168.5	following the bad guy.
172.1	At 17 years old, I was arrested
172.1	for robbery and murder
175.3	and I soon learned that finances in prison
175.3	rule more than they did on the streets,
179.3	so I wanted in.
181.42	One day, I rushed to grab
181.42	the sports page of the newspaper
184.5	so my cellie could read it to me,
186.34	and I accidentally
186.34	picked up the business section.
188.78	And this old man said,
188.78	"""Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"""
192.06	"And I said, ""What's that?"""
193.34	"He said, ""That's the place"
193.34	"where white folks keep all their money."""
196.54	(Laughter)
197.78	And it was the first time
197.78	that I saw a glimpse of hope,
201.66	a future.
203.18	He gave me this brief description
203.18	of what stocks were,
206.62	but it was just a glimpse.
210.18	I mean, how was I supposed to do it?
211.98	I couldn't read, write or spell.
214.42	The skills that I had developed
214.42	to hide my illiteracy
217.06	no longer worked in this environment.
219.06	I was trapped in a cage,
219.06	prey among predators,
222.18	fighting for freedom I never had.
224.1	I was lost, tired,
226.3	and I was out of options.
228.82	So at 20 years old,
230.62	I did the hardest thing
230.62	I'd ever done in my life.
233.98	I picked up a book,
237.22	and it was the most agonizing
237.22	time of my life,
241.14	trying to learn how to read,
242.98	the ostracizing from my family,
245.62	the homeys.
248.1	It was rough, man.
249.58	It was a struggle.
250.98	But little did I know
252.7	I was receiving the greatest gifts
252.7	I had ever dreamed of:
256.14	self-worth,
258.14	knowledge, discipline.
260.82	I was so excited to be reading that I read
260.82	everything I could get my hands on:
264.54	candy wrappers, clothing logos,
264.54	street signs, everything.
267.899	I was just reading stuff!
269.14	(Applause)
270.18	Just reading stuff.
273.18	I was so excited to know how to read
273.18	and know how to spell.
276.54	The homey came up, said,
276.54	"""Man, what you eating?"""
278.82	"I said, ""C-A-N-D-Y, candy."""
280.58	(Laughter)
282.86	"He said, ""Let me get some."""
282.86	"I said, ""N-O. No."""
285.38	(Laughter)
286.62	It was awesome.
288.06	I mean, I can actually now
288.06	for the first time in my life read.
291.26	The feeling that I got
291.26	from it was amazing.
295.06	And then at 22, feeling myself,
298.62	feeling confident,
300.38	I remembered what the OG told me.
303.58	So I picked up the business section
303.58	of the newspaper.
307.34	I wanted to find these rich white folks.
309.3	(Laughter)
312.34	So I looked for that glimpse.
315.3	As I furthered my career
316.94	in teaching others how to
316.94	financially manage money and invest,
320.82	I soon learned that I had to take
320.82	responsibility for my own actions.
324.18	True, I grew up
324.18	in a very complex environment,
327.22	but I chose to commit crimes,
329.18	and I had to own up to that.
330.98	I had to take responsibility
330.98	for that, and I did.
333.62	I was building a curriculum
333.62	that could teach incarcerated men
336.54	how to manage money
336.54	through prison employments.
340.54	Properly managing our lifestyle
340.54	would provide transferrable tools
343.74	that we can use to manage money
343.74	when we reenter society,
347.1	like the majority of people did
347.1	who didn't commit crimes.
350.38	Then I discovered
352.5	that according to MarketWatch,
354.58	over 60 percent of the American population
357.14	has under 1,000 dollars in savings.
360.02	Sports Illustrated said that
360.02	over 60 percent of NBA players
363.26	and NFL players go broke.
	derive from financial issues.
368.9	What the hell?
370.14	(Laughter)
372.3	You mean to tell me
372.3	that people worked their whole lives,
375.02	buying cars, clothes,
375.02	homes and material stuff
377.62	but were living check to check?
379.86	How in the world were members of society
379.86	going to help incarcerated individuals
384.22	back into society
385.46	if they couldn't manage they own stuff?
387.98	We screwed.
389.26	(Laughter)
391.02	I needed a better plan.
394.34	This is not going to work out too well.
396.86	So ...
399.7	I thought.
403.62	I now had an obligation
403.62	to meet those on the path
408.18	and help,
409.42	and it was crazy because
409.42	I now cared about my community.
412.7	Wow, imagine that.
412.7	I cared about my community.
416.46	Financial illiteracy is a disease
418.78	that has crippled minorities
418.78	and the lower class in our society
421.82	for generations and generations,
423.98	and we should be furious about that.
426.5	Ask yourselves this:
428.1	How can 50 percent
428.1	of the American population
431.38	be financially illiterate in a nation
431.38	driven by financial prosperity?
436.82	Our access to justice, our social status,
439.7	living conditions, transportation and food
442.74	are all dependent on money
442.74	that most people can't manage.
445.82	It's crazy!
447.42	It's an epidemic
448.82	and a bigger danger to public safety
448.82	than any other issue.
453.54	According to the California
453.54	Department of Corrections,
456.22	over 70 percent of those incarcerated
458.58	have committed or have been charged
458.58	with money-related crimes:
462.22	robberies, burglaries,
462.22	fraud, larceny, extortion --
467.54	and the list goes on.
469.74	Check this out:
470.98	a typical incarcerated person
473.94	would enter the California prison system
476.46	with no financial education,
478.66	earn 30 cents an hour,
480.66	over 800 dollars a year,
482.9	with no real expenses and save no money.
486.58	Upon his parole, he will be given
490.94	"""Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble."
490.94	"Don't come back to prison."""
494.62	With no meaningful preparation
494.62	or long-term financial plan,
497.94	what does he do ... ?
500.42	At 60?
502.94	Get a good job,
504.3	or go back to the very criminal behavior
504.3	that led him to prison in the first place?
509.22	You taxpayers, you choose.
511.02	Well, his education
511.02	already chose for him, probably.
514.94	So how do we cure this disease?
518.06	I cofounded a program
519.82	that we call Financial Empowerment
519.82	Emotional Literacy.
524.42	We call it FEEL,
525.9	and it teaches how do you separate
525.9	your emotional decisions
529.1	from your financial decisions,
531.1	and the four timeless rules
531.1	to personal finance:
534.54	the proper way to save,
537.38	control your cost of living,
540.14	borrow money effectively
541.94	and diversify your finances
541.94	by allowing your money to work for you
545.74	instead of you working for it.
547.58	Incarcerated people need these life skills
547.58	before we reenter society.
553.3	You can't have full rehabilitation
553.3	without these life skills.
557.22	This idea that only professionals
557.22	can invest and manage money
561.06	is absolutely ridiculous,
563.34	and whoever told you that is lying.
565.031	(Applause)
570.02	A professional is a person
572.46	who knows his craft better than most,
574.98	and nobody knows how much money
574.98	you need, have or want better than you,
579.94	which means you are the professional.
582.7	Financial literacy is not a skill,
582.7	ladies and gentlemen.
586.94	It's a lifestyle.
589.38	Financial stability is a byproduct
589.38	of a proper lifestyle.
593.9	A financially sound incarcerated person
593.9	can become a taxpaying citizen,
598.5	and a financially sound
598.5	taxpaying citizen can remain one.
602.02	This allows us to create a bridge
602.02	between those people who we influence:
606.38	family, friends and those young people
609.14	who still believe
609.14	that crime and money are related.
613.54	So let's lose the fear and anxiety
616.46	of all the big financial words
617.94	and all that other nonsense
617.94	that you've been out there hearing.
621.54	And let's get to the heart
621.54	of what's been crippling our society
625.42	from taking care of your responsibility
625.42	to be better life managers.
630.82	And let's provide a simple
630.82	and easy to use curriculum
634.18	that gets to the heart, the heart
636.46	of what financial empowerment
636.46	and emotional literacy really is.
640.42	Now, if you're sitting out here
640.42	in the audience and you said,
643.34	"""Oh yeah, well, that ain't me"
643.34	"and I don't buy it,"""
645.78	then come take my class --
647.1	(Laughter)
648.82	so I can show you how much money
648.82	it costs you every time you get emotional.
653.78	(Applause)
659.42	Thank you very much. Thank you.
660.98	(Applause)
