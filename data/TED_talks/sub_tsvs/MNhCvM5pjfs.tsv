17.047	I was sitting with my girls,
20.04	and Joy said,
21.553	"""Dang, I wish he'd get off my back."
25.531	"My daddy, he calls me all the time."""
29.387	"""Lucky for you he calls at all,"" said Jasmine."
32.653	"""I haven't heard from my dad in years."""
36.313	At this moment, I knew the girls needed a way
40.545	to connect with their fathers.
43.122	At Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,
46.885	we have these types of conversations all the time
50.422	as a way to help girls of African descent
53.614	prepare for their passage into womanhood.
57.196	These girls just needed
60.737	a way to invite their fathers into their lives
64.578	on their own terms.
67.275	So I asked the girls,
68.728	"""How can we help other girls"
71.864	"develop healthy relationships with their fathers?"""
76.154	"""Let's have a dance,"" one girl shouted,"
80.657	and all the girls quickly backed her up.
84.99	They started dreaming about the decorations,
87.896	invitations, the dresses they were going to wear,
91.31	and what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)
95.456	It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,
100.027	but even if I could have slowed down those girls,
104.097	I wouldn't have,
105.437	because one thing that I have learned
107.518	from over a decade of working with girls
110.596	is that they already know what they need.
114.116	The wisdom lives inside of them.
118.793	As long as they have infrastructure,
121.441	mentorship and resources,
123.857	they can build what they need,
127.275	not only to survive, but to thrive.
132.709	So we had a dance,
136.933	and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.
141.473	They were dressed to the nines.
144.448	They acted sweet.
146.691	(Laughter)
150.377	They acted silly.
152.227	They really enjoyed each other's company.
155.448	It was a huge success.
158.289	And the girls decided to make it an annual event.
163.5	So as the seasons changed,
166.092	and it was time to plan the dance again,
168.812	one girl named Brianna spoke up,
171.919	and she said,
174.109	"""My dad can't come to the dance,"
176.855	"and this whole thing is making me sad."""
181.092	"""Why not?"" the girls asked."
184.1	"""Because he's in jail,"" she bravely admitted."
188.78	"""Well, can he just get out for a day?"" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)"
193.714	"""And come in shackles?"
196.892	"That's worse than not having him here at all."""
201.237	At this moment, I saw an opportunity
205.655	for the girls to rise to the occasion
208.581	and to become their own heroes.
211.345	"So I asked, ""What do you think we should do about this?"
216.018	"We want every girl to experience the dance, right?"""
221.268	So the girls thought for a moment,
222.931	and one girl suggested,
225.24	"""Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"""
229.546	Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that,
233.362	"and said, ""Are you crazy?"
236.156	Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls,
239.164	"dressed up — "" (Laughter)"
241.628	""" — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"""
247.215	Because that's what they called them.
250.563	"I said, ""Girls, well, well,"
254.721	"you never know unless you ask."""
258.724	So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,
263.164	signed collectively by each girl,
266.983	and I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.
272.389	He contacted me immediately and said,
277.322	whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,
283.276	his doors are always open.
286.448	Because one thing he did know,
288.773	that when fathers are connected to their children,
292.1	it is less likely that they will return.
297.063	So,
304.998	The girls were dressed in their Sunday best,
308.647	and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits
313.676	for shirts and ties.
318.18	They hugged.
320.551	They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.
325.302	They laughed together.
329.027	It was beautiful.
333.435	The fathers and daughters even experienced
337.676	an opportunity to have a physical connection,
341.751	something that a lot of them didn't even have
344.48	for a while.
345.712	Fathers were in a space where they were able to
350.123	make their daughters play,
352.836	and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.
359.085	Even the guards cried.
362.762	But after the dance,
365.482	we all realized that Dad still would be in jail.
371.042	So we needed to create something
374.135	that they could take with them.
375.893	So we brought in Flip cams,
378.508	and we had them look at the Flip cams
381.249	and just interview each other --
382.977	their messages, their thoughts.
386.691	This was going to be used as a touchstone
389.874	so when they started to miss each other
392.29	and feel disconnected,
394.59	they could reconnect through this image.
397.954	I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes
403.336	with that camera and said,
404.656	"""Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"""
411.366	Because our daddies are our mirrors
415.454	that we reflect back on
417.876	when we decide about what type of man we deserve,
422.646	and how they see us for the rest of our lives.
426.237	I know that very well,
429.782	because I was one of the lucky girls.
432.183	I have had
438.058	my father in my life always.
444.065	He's even here today.
445.945	(Applause)
454.982	And that is why it is extremely special
458.96	for me to make sure that these girls
462.204	are connected to their fathers,
464.734	especially those who are separated
467.643	because of barbed wires and metal doors.
472.529	We have just created a form
475.622	for girls who have heavy questions on their heart
479.005	to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions
483.497	and given the fathers the freedom to answer.
488.264	Because we know that the fathers
491.609	are even leaving with this one thought:
494.857	What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?
500.226	Because a father is locked in
503.643	does not mean he should be locked out
506.693	of his daughter's life.
509.244	(Applause)
