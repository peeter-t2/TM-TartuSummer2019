30	Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here
33	said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,
37	but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
41	And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
45	There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
48	(Laughter)
51	What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories
57	and talk about a different Africa.
60	Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa
64	that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,
69	the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,
75	and the Africa of disasters.
78	While it is true that those things are going on,
82	there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
86	And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
90	This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
94	This is the Africa of opportunity.
96	This is the Africa where people want to take charge of
99	their own futures and their own destinies.
101	And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships
104	to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
108	And I want to start by telling you
110	a story about that change in Africa.
113	On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,
118	a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,
122	was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
129	He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars
134	that went into some dormant accounts
137	that belonged to him and his family.
141	This arrest occurred because there was cooperation
143	between the London Metropolitan Police
146	and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --
149	led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
156	Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
159	Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman
163	and ran from London back to Nigeria where,
166	according to our constitution, those in office
170	as governors, president -- as in many countries --
172	have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:
177	people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible
181	for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
188	Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.
191	This is a story about the fact that people in Africa
196	are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
202	This is a story about the fact that people want their resources
207	managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places
212	where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
215	And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --
219	corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people
223	and the governments are trying hard to fight this
226	in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
230	Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.
233	There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
237	And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
241	So when you hear about corruption,
243	don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --
246	that you can't operate in any African country
249	because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
252	There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing
258	and is being won. In others, like mine,
262	where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,
265	the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
269	But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.
274	The results are showing:
276	independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations
280	show that in many instances the trend is downwards
284	in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
287	A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed
291	a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
295	And let me say just one more thing
297	before I leave this area of governance.
299	That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
302	All the time when they talk about it
304	you immediately think about Africa.
306	That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:
310	if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --
318	if the other people who had taken money, estimated at
326	sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,
329	what is that? Is that not corruption?
333	In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
338	So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think
341	about what is happening on the other side of the globe --
344	where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
348	I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,
351	on asset recovery, trying to do what we can
354	to get the monies that have been taken abroad --
357	developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.
360	Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,
363	it may be far more for some of these countries
366	than all the aid that is being put together.
369	(Applause)
376	The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.
380	Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired
384	of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
389	We are grateful, but we know that
393	we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
398	And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization
402	that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
406	We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
410	We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,
413	become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
419	And this is what we started to do
421	in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
424	In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
427	I want to tell you that.
428	(Laughter)
429	One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,
433	and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --
439	but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
443	(Laughter)
444	What we started to do was to realize
446	that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
449	And with the support of a leader
451	who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,
454	we put forward a comprehensive reform program,
456	which we developed ourselves.
458	Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,
461	where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
465	No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
467	We put together a program that would, one: get the state
471	out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
475	The state should not be in the business
477	of producing goods and services
478	because it's inefficient and incompetent.
481	So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
485	(Applause)
490	We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
494	Can you believe that prior to this reform --
497	which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington
501	to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --
505	we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop
509	4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
514	(Laughter)
516	Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
519	You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
521	You had to do everything to get your phone.
523	When President Obasanjo supported and launched
526	the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
531	we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
539	Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,
544	after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year
549	in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
555	(Laughter)
558	The smartest one, first to come in,
562	was the MTN company of South Africa.
564	And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,
568	they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
579	with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
584	So the market is there.
586	When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
590	Nigerians themselves began to develop
593	some wireless telecommunications companies,
595	and three or four others have come in.
597	But there's a huge market out there,
600	and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
605	So privatization is one of the things we've done.
608	The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.
615	Because nobody's going to help you and support you
618	if you're not managing your own finances well.
621	And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation
625	of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
630	So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule
635	that de-linked our budget from the oil price.
637	Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,
641	because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector
646	in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
649	We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget
653	at a price slightly lower than the oil price
656	and save whatever was above that price.
661	We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
664	But what it immediately did was that the volatility
667	that had been present in terms of our economic development --
670	where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
674	When they crashed, we crashed.
676	And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
681	That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,
691	when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
696	By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And
699	as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves
703	due to proper management of our finances.
708	And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
711	Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time
714	is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people
718	have a predictability of prices in the economy.
725	We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
731	And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade
737	to about 6.5 percent now.
741	So all the changes and reforms we were able to make
744	have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
747	And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil
751	and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities
753	in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --
758	what was remarkable is that much of this growth came
761	not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
764	Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
767	As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,
771	and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that
776	once you get the macro-economy straightened out,
778	the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
783	We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.
786	We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals
790	that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized
793	that without the proper legislation to make that possible,
796	that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code
799	that is comparable with some of the best in the world.
803	We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
805	There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --
809	no shopping malls as you know them here.
815	This was an investment opportunity for someone
818	that excited the imagination of people.
821	And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall
824	are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
828	So, huge things in construction, real estate,
831	mortgage markets. Financial services:
834	we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
838	We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring
842	that they increase their capital -- share capital.
847	And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
852	The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening
856	of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
860	Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
864	Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
868	And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
871	We are doing the same with the insurance sector.
873	So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
876	In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
882	And that's what many people know East Africa for:
886	the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
889	But managing the tourism market in a way
891	that can really benefit the people is very important.
895	So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you
898	that there's a new wave on the continent.
901	A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,
906	more than two-thirds of African countries have had
908	multi-party democratic elections.
911	Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,
914	but the trend is very clear.
916	I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,
920	the average rate of growth on the continent has moved
923	from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
927	This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
932	So it's clear that things are changing.
936	Conflicts are down on the continent;
939	from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,
941	we are down to three or four conflicts --
943	one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
946	And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where
949	if something is going on in one part of the continent,
951	it looks like the entire continent is affected.
954	But you should know that this continent is not --
957	is a continent of many countries, not one country.
963	And if we are down to three or four conflicts,
965	it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest
968	in stable, growing, exciting economies
975	where there's plenty of opportunity.
979	And I want to just make one point about this investment.
984	The best way to help Africans today
987	is to help them to stand on their own feet.
990	And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
995	There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that
999	and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
1004	But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed
1008	and make sure that their children go to school,
1010	that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
1013	If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
1017	whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,
1022	isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
1027	And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in
1030	on the continent are the women.
1033	(Applause)
1040	I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.
1045	Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
1047	"It says, ""Africa: Open for Business."""
1051	And this is a video that has actually won an award
1054	as the best documentary of the year.
1056	Understand that the woman who made it
1058	is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
1064	But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who
1069	against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
1074	One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,
1077	making children's clothes --
1079	which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
1084	Mixing African materials, such as we have,
1088	with materials from elsewhere.
1089	So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,
1094	with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,
1100	has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
1104	(Laughter)
1106	For 10,000 pieces.
1109	So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
1113	And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.
1118	I could go on giving examples:
1120	Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business
1124	and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning
1129	and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
1134	However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,
1139	because nobody believes outside of our countries
1142	that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
1147	Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
1150	But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,
1153	will miss it forever.
1155	So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.
1162	Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,
1168	who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them
1171	into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure
1174	that their fellow men and women are employed,
1177	and that the children in those households get educated
1179	because their parents are earning adequate income.
1183	So I invite you to explore the opportunities.
1188	When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,
1192	because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be
1196	for you to get involved in something that will do good
1201	for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
1206	Thank you very much.
1207	(Applause)
