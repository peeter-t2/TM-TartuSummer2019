15.26	I'm going to talk to you
17.26	about power in this 21st century.
19.26	And basically, what I'd like to tell you
22.26	is that power is changing,
25.26	and there are two types of changes
27.26	I want to discuss.
29.26	One is power transition,
32.26	which is change of power amongst states.
35.26	And there the simple version of the message
38.26	is it's moving from West to East.
41.26	The other is power diffusion,
44.26	the way power is moving
46.26	from all states West or East
48.26	to non-state actors.
51.26	Those two things
53.26	are the huge shifts of power
55.26	in our century.
57.26	And I want to tell you about them each separately
60.26	and then how they interact
62.26	and why, in the end, there may be some good news.
66.26	When we talk about power transition,
69.26	we often talk about the rise of Asia.
73.26	It really should be called
75.26	the recovery or return of Asia.
77.26	If we looked at the world
79.26	in 1800,
81.26	you'd find that more than half of the world's people
84.26	lived in Asia
86.26	and they made more than half the world's product.
89.26	Now fast forward to 1900:
92.26	half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,
95.26	but they're now making
97.26	only a fifth of the world's product.
99.26	What happened? The Industrial Revolution,
102.26	which meant that all of a sudden,
104.26	Europe and America
106.26	became the dominant center of the world.
109.26	What we're going to see in the 21st century
112.26	is Asia gradually returning
115.26	to being more than half of the world's population
118.26	and more than half of the world's product.
122.26	That's important and it's an important shift.
125.26	But let me tell you a little bit about
127.26	the other shift that I'm talking about,
129.26	which is power diffusion.
131.26	To understand power diffusion
134.26	put this in your mind:
136.26	computing and communications costs
139.26	have fallen a thousandfold
142.26	between 1970
144.26	and the beginning of this century.
146.26	Now that's a big abstract number.
148.26	But to make it more real,
150.26	if the price of an automobile
152.26	had fallen as rapidly
154.26	as the price of computing power,
156.26	you could buy a car today
158.26	for five dollars.
160.26	Now when the price of any technology
162.26	declines that dramatically,
165.26	the barriers to entry go down.
168.26	Anybody can play in the game.
170.26	So in 1970,
172.26	if you wanted to communicate
174.26	from Oxford to Johannesburg
176.26	to New Delhi
178.26	to Brasilia
180.26	and anywhere simultaneously,
183.26	you could do it.
185.26	The technology was there.
187.26	But to be able to do it,
189.26	you had to be very rich --
191.26	a government, a multinational corporation,
194.26	maybe the Catholic Church --
197.26	but you had to be pretty wealthy.
199.26	Now, anybody has that capacity,
202.26	which previously was restricted by price
205.26	just to a few actors.
208.26	If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --
211.26	the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --
214.26	and if you have Skype, it's free.
217.26	So capabilities
219.26	that were once restricted
221.26	are now available to everyone.
223.26	And what that means
225.26	is not that the age of the State is over.
229.26	The State still matters.
231.26	But the stage is crowded.
233.26	The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.
236.26	Some of that's good:
238.26	Oxfam,
240.26	a great non-governmental actor.
242.26	Some of it's bad:
244.26	Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.
247.26	But think of what it does
249.26	to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.
252.26	We think in terms of war
254.26	and interstate war.
256.26	And you can think back to 1941
259.26	when the government of Japan
261.26	attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.
264.26	It's worth noticing
266.26	that a non-state actor
268.26	attacking the United States in 2001
271.26	killed more Americans
273.26	than the government of Japan did in 1941.
276.26	You might think of that
278.26	as the privatization of war.
280.26	So we're seeing a great change
283.26	in terms of diffusion of power.
286.26	Now the problem is
289.26	that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.
292.26	So let me step back
294.26	and ask: what's power?
296.26	Power is simple the ability
298.26	to affect others
300.26	to get the outcomes you want,
302.26	and you can do it in three ways.
304.26	You can do it with threats
306.26	"of coercion, ""sticks,"""
308.26	you can do it with payments,
310.26	"""carrots,"""
312.26	or you can do it by getting others
314.26	to want what you want.
316.26	And that ability to get others to want what you want,
319.26	to get the outcomes you want
321.26	without coercion or payment,
323.26	is what I call soft power.
326.26	And that soft power has been much neglected
329.26	and much misunderstood,
331.26	and yet it's tremendously important.
334.26	Indeed, if you can learn
337.26	to use more soft power,
339.26	you can save a lot
341.26	on carrots and sticks.
343.26	Traditionally, the way people thought about power
346.26	was primarily in terms of military power.
350.26	For example, the great Oxford historian
352.26	who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,
355.26	defined a great power
358.26	as a country able to prevail in war.
362.26	But we need a new narrative
364.26	if we're to understand power in the 21st century.
366.26	It's not just prevailing at war,
368.26	though war still persists.
371.26	It's not whose army wins;
373.26	it's also whose story wins.
376.26	And we have to think much more in terms of narratives
379.26	and whose narrative is going to be effective.
383.26	Now let me go back
385.26	to the question
387.26	of power transition
389.26	between states
391.26	and what's happening there.
393.26	the narratives that we use now
395.26	tend to be the rise and fall
397.26	of the great powers.
399.26	And the current narrative is all about
401.26	the rise of China
403.26	and the decline of the United States.
406.26	Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,
408.26	many people said this was
410.26	the beginning of the end of American power.
412.26	The tectonic plates
414.26	of world politics were shifting.
417.26	And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,
419.26	pronounced in 2008
421.26	this was the beginning of the end
423.26	of United States power.
425.26	But in fact,
427.26	this metaphor of decline
429.26	is often very misleading.
431.26	If you look at history, in recent history,
434.26	you'll see the cycles of belief
436.26	in American decline
438.26	come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.
442.26	In 1958,
444.26	after the Soviets put up Sputnik,
446.26	"it was ""That's the end of America."""
448.26	In 1973, with the oil embargo
450.26	and the closing of the gold window,
453.26	that was the end of America.
455.26	In the 1980s,
457.26	as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,
459.26	between the rust belt economy of the midwest
462.26	to the Silicon Valley economy of California,
465.26	that was the end of America.
468.26	But in fact, what we've seen
470.26	is none of those were true.
473.26	Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic
476.26	in the early 2000s,
478.26	thinking America could do anything,
480.26	which led us into some disastrous
482.26	foreign policy adventures,
484.26	and now we're back to decline again.
486.26	The moral of this story
488.26	is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline
491.26	tell us a lot more about psychology
494.26	than they do about reality.
496.26	If we try to focus on the reality,
499.26	then what we need to focus on
501.26	is what's really happening
503.26	in terms of China and the United States.
507.26	Goldman Sachs has projected
509.26	that China, the Chinese economy,
512.26	will surpass that of the U.S.
515.26	by 2027.
517.26	So we've got, what,
521.26	before China's bigger.
523.26	Now someday,
525.26	with a billion point three people getting richer,
527.26	they are going to be bigger than the United States.
530.26	But be very careful about these projections
532.26	such as the Goldman Sachs projection
534.26	as though that gives you an accurate picture
537.26	of power transition in this century.
540.26	Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.
543.26	First of all, it's a linear projection.
546.26	You know, everything says,
548.26	here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,
550.26	here it goes -- straight line.
552.26	History is not linear.
554.26	There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.
557.26	The second thing is
559.26	that the Chinese economy
561.26	passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,
564.26	which it may it,
566.26	that will be a measure of total economic size,
569.26	but not of per capita income --
571.26	won't tell you about the composition of the economy.
574.26	China still has large areas
576.26	of underdevelopment
578.26	and per capita income is a better measure
580.26	of the sophistication of the economy.
582.26	And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans
585.26	until somewhere in the latter part,
587.26	after 2050, of this century.
590.26	The other point that's worth noticing
593.26	is how one-dimensional
595.26	this projection is.
597.26	You know, it looks at economic power
599.26	measured by GDP.
601.26	Doesn't tell you much about military power,
604.26	doesn't tell you very much about soft power.
606.26	It's all very one-dimensional.
608.26	And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,
611.26	or return of Asia
613.26	as I called it a little bit earlier,
615.26	it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.
618.26	If you're sitting in Japan,
621.26	or in New Delhi,
623.26	or in Hanoi,
625.26	your view of the rise of China
628.26	is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.
631.26	Indeed, one of the advantages
633.26	that the Americans will have
635.26	in terms of power in Asia
637.26	is all those countries
639.26	want an American insurance policy
641.26	against the rise of China.
643.26	It's as though Mexico and Canada
646.26	were hostile neighbors to the United States,
648.26	which they're not.
650.26	So these simple projections
652.26	of the Goldman Sachs type
654.26	are not telling us what we need to know
656.26	about power transition.
657.26	But you might ask, well so what in any case?
660.26	Why does it matter? Who cares?
662.26	Is this just a game
664.26	that diplomats and academics play?
666.26	The answer is it matters quite a lot.
669.26	Because, if you believe in decline
671.26	and you get the answers wrong on this,
674.26	the facts, not the myths,
676.26	you may have policies which are very dangerous.
679.26	Let me give you an example from history.
682.26	The Peloponnesian War
684.26	was the great conflict
686.26	in which the Greek city state system
688.26	tore itself apart
691.26	two and a half millennia ago.
694.26	What caused it?
696.26	Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,
699.26	said it was the rise in the power of Athens
702.26	and the fear it created in Sparta.
705.26	Notice both halves of that explanation.
708.26	Many people argue
710.26	that the 21st century
712.26	is going to repeat the 20th century,
714.26	in which World War One,
717.26	the great conflagration
719.26	in which the European state system
721.26	tore itself apart
723.26	and destroyed its centrality in the world,
725.26	that that was caused by
727.26	the rise in the power of Germany
729.26	and the fear it created in Britain.
732.26	So there are people who are telling us
734.26	this is going to be reproduced today,
736.26	that what we're going to see
738.26	is the same thing now in this century.
741.26	No, I think that's wrong.
743.26	It's bad history.
745.26	For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain
747.26	in industrial strength by 1900.
749.26	And as I said earlier,
751.26	China has not passed the United States.
754.26	But also, if you have this belief
756.26	and it creates a sense of fear,
759.26	it leads to overreaction.
761.26	And the greatest danger we have
763.26	of managing this power transition
766.26	of the shift toward the East is fear.
769.26	To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt
771.26	from a different context,
773.26	the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.
776.26	We don't have to fear the rise of China
779.26	or the return of Asia.
781.26	And if we have policies
783.26	in which we take it
785.26	in that larger historical perspective,
787.26	we're going to be able
789.26	to manage this process.
791.26	Let me say a word now
793.26	about the distribution of power
795.26	and how it relates to power diffusion
798.26	and then pull these two types together.
800.26	If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,
803.26	it's distributed much like
806.26	a three-dimensional chess game.
809.26	Top board:
811.26	military power among states.
813.26	The United States is the only superpower,
816.26	and it's likely to remain that way
818.26	for two or three decades.
820.26	China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.
823.26	Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:
826.26	economic power among states.
828.26	Power is multi-polar.
831.26	There are balancers --
833.26	the U.S., Europe,
835.26	China, Japan
837.26	can balance each other.
839.26	The bottom board of this three-dimensional,
842.26	the board of transnational relations,
844.26	things that cross borders outside the control of governments,
848.26	things like climate change, drug trade,
851.26	financial flows,
853.26	pandemics,
855.26	all these things that cross borders
857.26	outside the control of governments,
859.26	there nobody's in charge.
861.26	It makes no sense to call this unipolar
863.26	or multi-polar.
865.26	Power is chaotically distributed.
867.26	And the only way you can solve these problems --
869.26	and this is where many greatest challenges
871.26	are coming in this century --
873.26	is through cooperation,
875.26	through working together,
877.26	which means that soft power becomes more important,
880.26	that ability to organize networks
882.26	to deal with these kinds of problems
884.26	and to be able to get cooperation.
887.26	Another way of putting it
889.26	is that as we think of power in the 21st century,
892.26	we want to get away from the idea
894.26	that power's always zero sum --
896.26	my gain is your loss and vice versa.
899.26	Power can also be positive sum,
902.26	where your gain can be my gain.
905.26	If China develops greater energy security
908.26	and greater capacity
910.26	to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,
912.26	that's good for us
914.26	as well as good for China
916.26	as well as good for everybody else.
918.26	So empowering China
920.26	to deal with its own problems of carbon
923.26	is good for everybody,
926.26	and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.
929.26	It's one in which we can all gain.
931.26	So as we think about power
933.26	in this century,
935.26	we want to get away from this view
937.26	that it's all I win, you lose.
940.26	Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.
943.26	Wars persist. Power persists.
945.26	Military power is important.
947.26	Keeping balances is important.
949.26	All this still persists.
951.26	Hard power is there,
953.26	and it will remain.
955.26	But unless you learn how to mix
957.26	hard power with soft power
959.26	into strategies that I call smart power,
962.26	you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems
964.26	that we're facing.
967.26	So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this
970.26	is how do we work together
972.26	to produce global public goods,
975.26	things from which all of us can benefit?
978.26	How do we define our national interests
980.26	so that it's not just zero sum,
982.26	but positive sum.
984.26	In that sense, if we define our interests,
986.26	for example, for the United States
988.26	the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,
991.26	keeping an open trading system,
994.26	keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --
997.26	those were good for Britain,
999.26	they were good for others as well.
1001.26	And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.
1004.26	How do we produce global public goods,
1007.26	which are good for us,
1009.26	but good for everyone at the same time?
1011.26	And that's going to be the good news dimension
1013.26	of what we need to think about
1015.26	as we think of power in the 21st century.
1018.26	There are ways to define our interests
1021.26	in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,
1024.26	we can organize with others in networks
1027.26	to produce, not only public goods,
1030.26	but ways that will enhance our soft power.
1033.26	So if one looks at the statements
1036.26	that have been made about this,
1038.26	I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton
1040.26	described the foreign policy
1042.26	of the Obama administration,
1044.26	she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration
1047.26	was going to be smart power,
1050.26	"as she put it, ""using all the tools"
1052.26	"in our foreign policy tool box."""
1056.26	And if we're going to deal
1058.26	with these two great power shifts that I've described,
1061.26	the power shift represented by transition among states,
1064.26	the power shift represented
1066.26	by diffusion of power away from all states,
1069.26	we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power
1072.26	in which we combine hard and soft power
1075.26	into strategies of smart power.
1078.26	And that's the good news I have. We can do that.
1081.26	Thank you very much.
1083.26	(Applause)
