26.498	You know, when Chris first approached me
26.498	to speak at TED, I said no,
31	because I felt
31	like I wasn't going to be able
33.167	to make that personal connection,
33.167	you know, that I wanted to.
36.43	It's such a large conference.
38	But he explained to me
38	that he was in a bind,
40.523	and that he was having trouble
40.523	finding the kind of sex appeal
44	and star power that
44	the conference was known for.
47	So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.
49.859	I'll come on two conditions.
52	One: I want to speak as early
52	in the morning as possible.
57.349	And two: I want to pick
57.349	the theme for TED 2006.
61.64	And luckily he agreed.
63.773	And the theme, in two years,
63.773	"is going to be ""Cute Pictures Of Puppies."""

104.399	(Applause)
107.264	I invented the Placebo Camera.
111.088	(Laughter)
113.434	It doesn't actually take pictures,
113.434	but it's a hell of a lot cheaper,
117.271	and you still feel like you were there.
119.256	(Laughter)
121.605	(Clears his throat)
122.897	(Laughter)
130	"""Dear Sir, good day,"
130	compliments of the day,
133.469	and my best wishes to you and family.
135.69	(Breathes in)
136.785	I know this letter
136.785	will come to you surprisingly,
139.118	but let it not be a surprise to you,
141.368	for nature has a way
141.368	of arriving unannounced,
144.328	and, as an adage says,
144.328	originals are very hard to find,
146.953	but their echoes sound ouder.
149.014	So I decided to contact you myself,
151	for you to assure me
151	of safety and honesty,
153.072	if I have to entrust any amount of money
153.072	under your custody.
157.46	I am Mr Micheal Bangura,
157.46	the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura
164	who was the Minister of Finance
164	in Sierra Leone
167.191	but was killed during the civil war.
169	(Laughter)
170.287	Knowing your country to be
170.287	economical conducive for investment,
173.31	and your people as transparent
173.31	and trustworthy to engage in business,
176.588	on which premise I write you.
178.255	(Laughter)
180.234	Before my father death,
181.877	he had the sum of 23 million
181.877	United States dollars,
185.582	which he kept away from the rebel
185.582	leaders during the course of the war.
189.004	(Laughter)
191.42	This fund was supposed to be used
193.086	for the rehabilitation of water reserves
193.086	all over the country,
196.534	before the outbreak of war.
198.506	When the war broke out,
200.555	the rebel leader demanded
200.555	the fund be given to him,
203.025	my father insisted it
203.025	was not in his possession,
206.352	and he was killed because of his refusal
206.352	to release the fund.
209.655	Meanwhile, my mother and I
210.922	is the only person who knows about it
210.922	because my father always confide in me.
214.768	(Sighs)
216.001	I made an arrangement
216.001	with a Red Cross relief worker,
218.544	who used his official van to transport
218.544	the money to Lungi Airport, Freetown,
222.141	although he did not know
222.141	the real contents of the box.
224.69	(Laughter)
226.327	The fund was deposited
226.327	as a family reasure,
229.3	in a safe, reliable security company
229.3	in Dakar, Senegal,
233	where I was only given temporary asylum.
235.43	I do not wish to invest
235.43	the money in Senegal
238	due to unfavorable economic climate,
238	and so close to my country.
242.369	The only assistance I need from you,
242.369	which I know you would do for me,
246.811	are the following:
246.811	one, be a silent partner
249.776	and receive the funds
249.776	in your account in trust;
252	two, provide a bank account
252	under your control
255.401	to which the funds will be remitted;
257.368	three, receive the funds
257.368	into your account in trust;
261	take out your commission;
261	and leave the rest of the money
264.489	until I arrive,
264.489	after the transfer is complete.
267	"Sincerely, Mr Micheal Bangura."""
269.559	(Laughter)
270.874	(Applause)
277.249	This is really embarrassing.
279.486	I was told backstage
279.486	that I have 18 minutes.
282.881	I only prepared 15.
284.522	(Laughter)
286.434	So if it's cool,
286.434	I'd like to just wait for three.
289.543	(Laughter)
296.792	(Laughter ends)
298	I'm really sorry.
299.287	(Laughter)
303	(Applause)
307.983	What's your name?
309.18	(Laughter)
311.416	Mark Surfas.
314.615	It's pretty cool, huh? Pursuing happiness.
317.711	(Laughter)
319	Are you a virgin? Virgin?
321	I mean -- no, I mean
321	like in the TED sense?
323.051	(Laughter)
324.16	Are you? Oh, yeah?
327.881	So what are you, like, a thousand,
327.881	two thousand, somewhere in there?
332.182	Huh? Oh?
333.751	You don't know what I'm talking about?
335.608	(Laughter)
339.614	Ah, Mark --
342.601	(Laughter)
345	Surfas.
347	(Laughter)
353	1,860 -- am I good?
356.433	And that's nothing to be ashamed of.
358.321	That's nothing to be ashamed of.
360	(Applause)
364.869	Yeah, I was hanging out
364.869	with some Google guys last night.
368	Really cool, we were getting wasted.
370	(Laughter)
373.921	And they were telling me that Google
373.921	software has gotten so advanced
377.402	that, based on your interaction
377.402	with Google over your lifetime,
381.641	they can actually predict
381.641	what you are going to say --
384.763	(Laughter)
386.118	next.
387.529	"And I was like, ""Get the fuck"
387.529	"out of here. That's crazy."""
390.518	(Laughter)
392	But they said,
392	"""No, but don't show anyone."""
396.803	But they slipped up.
398.073	And they said that I could just type in
398.073	"""What was I going to say next?"""
402.154	and my name, and it would tell me.
403.876	And I have to tell you, this is
403.876	an unadulterated piece of software,
407.114	this is a real Internet browser
407.114	and this is the actual Google site,
410.337	and we're going to test it out live today.
413	What was I going to say next?
419.56	"And ""Ze Frank"" -- that's me."
423.182	Am I feeling lucky?
424.457	(Laughter)
426.171	(Shouting) Am I feeling lucky?
428	Audience: Yes! Yeah!
429.768	(Sighs)
430.793	(Laughter)
433	Ze Frank: Oh! Amazing.
437.153	(Laughter)
442	In March of 2001 --
444	(Laughter)
446.531	I filmed myself dancing
446.531	"to Madonna's ""Justify My Love."""
451.69	On a Thursday, I sent out a link
451.69	to a website that featured those clips
455.382	to 17 of my closest friends,
457.312	as part of an invitation to my --
457.312	an invitation to my th --
464.81	th -- 26th birthday party.
467	(Laughter)
468.514	(Clears throat)
469.539	By Monday, over a million people
469.539	were coming to this site a day.
475.467	(Sighs)
477.435	(Laughter)
480.326	Within a week, I received a call
480.326	from Earthlink that said,
484	due to a 10 cents
484	per megabyte overage charge,
486.215	I owed them 30,000 dollars.
488	(Laughter)
490.352	Needless to say,
490.352	I was able to leave my job.
494.036	[WAS LAID OFF]
495.21	(Laughter)
498.289	And, finally, you know, become freelance.
501.398	(Laughter)
502.482	[UNEMPLOYED]
504	But some people refer to me more
504	as, like, an Internet guru or --
507.388	[JACKASS]
508.684	swami.
509.866	(Laughter)
511	I knew I had something.
513.695	I'd basically distilled
513.695	a very difficult-to-explain
517	and complex philosophy,
517	which I won't get into here,
521	because it's a little too deep
521	for all of you, but --
524.307	(Laughter)
525.378	It's about what makes websites popular,
525.378	and, you know, it's --
530	[DANCE LIKE AN IDIOT
530	AND DON'T SELL ANYTHING]
532.174	It's unfortunate
532.174	that I don't have more time.
534.348	Maybe I can come back next year,
534.348	or something like that.
538	(Laughter)
540.527	I'm obsessed with email.
540.527	I get a lot of it.
543	Four years later, I still get probably
543	two or three hundred emails a day
547.263	from people I don't know,
549.482	and it's been an amazing opportunity
552.273	to kind of get to know
552.273	different cultures, you know?
556.235	It's like a microscope
556.235	to the rest of the world.
559	You can kind of peer
559	into other people's lives.
564.012	And I also feel like I get a lot
564.012	of inspiration from the average user.
568.857	For example, somebody wrote,
568.857	"""Hey Ze, if you ever come to Boulder,"
573	"you should rock out with us,"""
573	"and I said, ""Why wait?"""
575.583	[rocking out]
576.773	(Video) (Music)
579.763	And they said,
579.763	"""Hey Ze, thanks for rocking out,"
583	but I meant the kind of rocking out
583	"where we'd be naked."""
585.739	(Laughter)
587.207	And that was embarrassing.
588.675	But you know, it's kind of a collaboration
588.675	between me and the fans,
593.129	"so I said, ""Sure."""
594.715	[rocking out naked]
596.016	(Video) (Music)
597.067	(Laughter)
600.463	I hear a lot of you whispering.
602	(Laughter)
604	And I know what you're saying,
605.939	"""Holy crap!"
607.194	"How is his presentation so smooth?"""
609	(Laughter)
612.372	And I have to say
612.372	that it's not all me this year.
615.219	I guess Chris has to take some credit
615.219	here, because in years past,
620	I guess there's been
620	some sort of subpar speakers at TED.
622.734	I don't know.
624	And so, this year, Chris sent us
624	a TED conference simulator.
628	(Laughter)
629.431	Which really allowed us as speakers
629.431	to get there, in the trenches,
635	and practice at home so that we would be
635	ready for this experience.
639	And I've got to say that, you know,
639	it's really, really great to be here.
643	(Pre-recorded applause)
645.869	I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.
648.019	(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)
650.478	Not just the good stuff, though.
654.2	You can do heckler mode.
655.651	Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!
658.399	ZF: You get off the stage.
660	(Laughter)
662	Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.
664.219	(Laughter)
667.994	(Baby cooing)
670.413	(Huge crowd applauding)
675.91	In case you run over time.
677.508	(Heroic music)
678.682	Just one last thing
678.682	I'd like to say, I'd, really --
681.1	(Laughter)
683	I'd like to thank all of you
683	for being here.
685.367	(Loud music)
686.554	(Laughter)
688.714	And frog mode.
690.142	(Singing)
701	"(Sings) ""Ah, the first time that I made"
701	"love to a rock shrimp --"""
705.395	(Laughter)
708.866	[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]
712.104	(Sighs)
713.2	It's true.
714.496	Some people say to me,
717.192	"""Ze, you're doing all this stuff,"
717.192	this Internet stuff,
719.755	"and you're not making any money."""
721.41	(Laughter)
724	"""Why?"" And I say, ""Mom, Dad --"
726.352	(Laughter)
730	"I'm trying."""
731.863	I don't know if you're all aware of this,
734	but the video game market,
736	kids are playing these video games,
738.868	but, supposedly, there's tons of money.
740.944	I mean, like, I think,
744.191	is being spent on these things.
746.239	So I decided to try my hand.
750.177	I came up with a few games.
751.628	(Laughter)
753.746	"This is called ""Atheist."""
755	I figured it would be popular
755	with the young kids.
758.07	OK.
759.388	Look, I'll move around
759.388	and say some things.
763.41	(Sighs)
765.218	[Game over. There is no replay.]
767.55	(Laughter)
769.352	So that didn't go over so well.
771	(Laughter)
774.357	I don't really understand
774.357	why you're laughing.
776.651	(Laughter)
778	Should have done this
778	before I tried to pitch it.
781	"""Buddhist,"" of course, looks"
781	"very, very similar to ""Atheist."""
786	(Laughter)
787.109	But you come back as a duck.
789	(Laughter)
795	And this is great because,
795	you know, for a quarter,
797.453	you can play this for a long time.
799.453	(Laughter)
801.001	And Chris had said in an email
802.802	that we should really bring
802.802	something new to TED,
805.173	something that we haven't shown anyone.
808.849	"So, I made this for TED. It's ""Christian."""
811	It's the third in the series.
812.478	I'm hoping it's going
812.478	to do well this year.
815.191	(Sighs)
817	(Laughter)
820	Do you have a preference?
821.278	(Laughter)
823.431	Good choice.
824.605	(Laughter)
827.671	So you can wait for the Second Coming,
830.405	which is a random number
830.405	between one and 500 million.
835.744	(Laughter)
838.95	So really, what are we talking about here?
841.741	Oh, tech joy.
843	(Laughter)
845.417	Tech joy, to me, means something,
845.417	because I get a lot of joy out of tech.
850	And in fact, making things
850	using technology --
854	and I'm being serious here,
855.452	even though I'm using
855.452	my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.
859.657	Making things, you know --
862.736	making things actually
862.736	does give me a lot of joy.
865.066	It's the process of creation that keeps me
867.405	sort of a bubble and a half
867.405	above perpetual anxiety in my life,
871	and it's that feeling of being
871	about 80 percent complete on a project --
874.453	where you know you still have
874.453	something to do,
876.668	but it's not finished,
876.668	and you're not starting something --
880	that really fills my entire life.
882.714	And so, what I've done is,
884.572	I started getting interested
884.572	in creating online social spaces
888.202	to share that feeling
889.696	with people who don't consider
889.696	themselves artists.
892.124	We're in a culture of guru-ship.
894.622	It's so hard to use some software
894.622	because, you know, it's unapproachable,
898.478	people feel like they have
898.478	to read the manual.
901.078	So I try to create
901.078	these very minimal activities
906.694	that allow people to express
906.694	themselves, and, hopefully --
910.148	"(""The End"" by The Doors)"
914	Whoa! I'm like -- on the page,
914	but it doesn't exist.
920	(Laughter)
921.386	It's, like -- seriously, though --
924.398	(Laughter)
927	I try to create meaningful environments
927	for people to express themselves.
931	(Laughter)
932.087	Here I created a contest called,
932.087	"""When Office Supplies Attack,"""
936	which, I think, really resonated
936	with the working population.
941	(Laughter)
942.182	Over 500 entries in three weeks.
946.554	Toilet paper fashion.
948	(Laughter)
950.867	Again, people from all over the country.
953.178	The watch is particularly incredible.
955.31	(Laughter)
958	Online drawing tools --
958	you've probably seen a lot of them.
960.808	I think they're wonderful.
962.079	It's a chance for people
962.079	to get to play with crayons
964.575	and all that kind of stuff.
965.885	But I'm interested
965.885	in the process of creating,
968.262	as the real event that I'm interested in.
971.464	And the problem is that
971.464	a lot of people suck at drawing,
975.622	and they get bummed out at this,
975.622	sort of, you know, stick figure,
979.612	awful little thing that they created.
981.839	And eventually, it just makes them
981.839	stop playing with it,
985	or they draw penises and things like that.
987.545	(Laughter)
989	So, the Scribbler is an attempt
989	to create a generative tool.
992.429	In other words, it's a helping tool.
995	You can draw your simple stick figure,
996.834	and it collaborates with you to create
996.834	sort of a post-war German etching.
1001	(Laughter)
1003.23	In fact, it's tuned to be better
1003.23	at drawing things that look worse.
1010.46	So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.
1014.888	So the idea is that you can really,
1019	you know, partake in this process,
1022	but watch something
1022	really crappy look beautiful.
1025.853	And here are some of my favorites.
1027.587	This is the little trap marionette
1027.587	that was submitted to me.
1034.35	Very cool.
1035.572	(Laughter)
1038.257	Darling.
1040.201	Beautiful stuff.
1042.713	I mean this is incredible.
1044.415	An 11-year-old girl drew this
1044.415	and submitted it.
1047.14	It's just gorgeous.
1048.871	(Laughter)
1050.419	I'm dead serious here.
1052.211	This is not a joke.
1054	(Laughter)
1056	But, I think it's a really fun
1056	and wonderful thing.
1059.319	"So this is called the ""Fiction Project."""
1062.505	This is an online space,
1064.502	which is basically
1064.502	a refurbished message board
1068	that encourages collaborative
1068	fiction writing.
1070.754	These are haikus.
1072	None of the haikus were written
1072	by the same person.
1074.405	In fact, each line is contributed
1074.405	by a different person
1078.385	at a different time.
1080	"I think that the ""now tied up, tied down,"
1083.866	mistress cruel approaches me,
1083.866	"now tied down, it's up."""
1087	It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
1091	if you come home, and your spouse,
1091	or whoever it is,
1096.452	"says, ""Let's talk"" --"
1100.063	That, like, chills you to the very core.
1103.569	(Laughter)
1104.648	But it's peripheral activities like these
1106.847	that allow people to get together,
1106.847	doing fun things.
1110	They actually get to know each other,
1111.786	and it's sort of like low-threshold
1111.786	peripheral activities
1115.38	that I think are the key to bringing up
1117.37	some of our bonding social capital
1117.37	that we're lacking.
1119.918	And very, very quickly --
1119.918	I love puppets.
1122.306	Here's a puppet.
1124.315	It dances to music.
1125.523	Lotte Reiniger, an amazing
1125.523	shadow puppeteer in the 20s,
1130	that started doing more elaborate things.
1131.993	I became interested in puppets,
1133.494	and I just want to show
1133.494	one last thing to you.
1135.707	Oh, this is how you make puppets.
1137.303	(Applause)
1138.913	Chris Anderson: Ladies
1138.913	and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.
1141.453	(Applause)
