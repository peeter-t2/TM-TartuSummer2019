19.208	A question I'm often asked is,
21.168	where did I get my passion
21.168	for human rights and justice?
26.658	It started early.
28.515	I grew up in the west of Ireland,
30.816	wedged between four brothers,
32.901	two older than me and two younger than me.
35.695	So of course I had to be
35.695	interested in human rights,
38.93	and equality and justice,
41.459	and using my elbows!
43.204	(Laughter)
45.041	And those issues stayed
45.041	with me and guided me,
48.054	and in particular,
49.704	when I was elected the first
49.704	woman President of Ireland,
54.278	from 1990 to 1997.
57.539	I dedicated my presidency
60.08	to having a space for those who felt
60.08	marginalized on the island of Ireland,
65.561	and bringing together communities
65.561	from Northern Ireland
68.314	with those from the Republic,
70.078	trying to build peace.
72.465	And I went as the first Irish president
72.465	to the United Kingdom
77.739	and met with Queen Elizabeth II,
80.749	and also welcomed to my
80.749	official residence --
84.581	"which we call ""Áras an Uachtaráin,"""
84.581	the house of the president --
88.384	members of the royal family,
90.654	including, notably, the Prince of Wales.
93.946	And I was aware that at the time
93.946	of my presidency,
100.332	Ireland was a country beginning
100.332	a rapid economic progress.
105.772	We were a country that was benefiting
105.772	from the solidarity of the European Union.
113.607	Indeed, when Ireland first joined
113.607	the European Union in 1973,
118.635	there were parts of the country
118.635	that were considered developing,
122.015	including my own beloved
122.015	native county, County Mayo.
126.563	I led trade delegations
126.563	here to the United States,
130.898	to Japan, to India,
133.808	to encourage investment,
133.808	to help to create jobs,
137.098	to build up our economy,
138.448	to build up our health system,
138.448	our education --
140.766	our development.
142.956	What I didn't have to do as president
146	was buy land on mainland Europe,
150.665	so that Irish citizens could go there
150.665	because our island was going underwater.
157.711	What I didn't have to think about,
159.365	either as president
159.365	or as a constitutional lawyer,
162.064	was the implications
162.064	for the sovereignty of the territory
165.74	because of the impact of climate change.
169.309	But that is what President Tong,
169.309	of the Republic of Kiribati,
174.104	has to wake up every morning
174.104	thinking about.
177.47	He has bought land in Fiji
177.47	as an insurance policy,
182.752	"what he calls, ""migration with dignity,"""
186.537	because he knows that his people
186.537	may have to leave their islands.
192.295	As I listened to President Tong
192.295	describing the situation,
197.407	I really felt that this was a problem
197.407	that no leader should have to face.
204.194	And as I heard him speak
204.194	about the pain of his problems,
209.984	I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt.
213.703	I thought about her
213.703	and those who worked with her
218.103	on the Commission on Human Rights,
218.103	which she chaired in 1948,
223.205	and drew up the Universal
223.205	Declaration of Human Rights.
228.036	For them, it would have been unimaginable
231.638	that a whole country
231.638	could go out of existence
236.296	because of human-induced climate change.
239.741	I came to climate change not as
239.741	a scientist or an environmental lawyer,
244.514	and I wasn't really impressed
244.514	by the images of polar bears
248.497	or melting glaciers.
250.131	It was because of the impact on people,
254.004	and the impact on their rights --
257.101	their rights to food and safe water,
257.101	health, education and shelter.
262.256	And I say this with humility,
266.657	because I came late
266.657	to the issue of climate change.
270.894	When I served
272.069	as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
274.093	from 1997 to 2002,
277.347	climate change wasn't
277.347	at the front of my mind.
279.577	I don't remember making
279.577	a single speech on climate change.
283.498	I knew that there was another
283.498	part of the United Nations --
286.825	the UN Convention on Climate Change --
289.007	that was dealing with
289.007	the issue of climate change.
292.752	It was later when I started
292.752	to work in African countries
297.136	on issues of development and human rights.
300.428	And I kept hearing
300.428	this pervasive sentence:
303.714	"""Oh, but things are so much worse now,"
303.714	"things are so much worse."""
308.502	And then I explored what was behind that;
311.892	it was about changes in the climate --
315.225	climate shocks, changes in the weather.
318.859	I met Constance Okollet,
320.911	who had formed a women's group
320.911	in Eastern Uganda,
324.093	and she told me that
324.093	when she was growing up,
326.744	she had a very normal life in her village
326.744	and they didn't go hungry,
331.101	they knew that the seasons would come
331.101	as they were predicted to come,
336.454	they knew when to sow
336.454	and they knew when to harvest,
339.255	and so they had enough food.
342.008	But, in recent years,
344.357	at the time of this conversation,
346.305	they had nothing
346.305	but long periods of drought,
349.559	and then flash flooding,
351.234	and then more drought.
353.28	The school had been destroyed,
354.845	livelihoods had been destroyed,
356.408	their harvest had been destroyed.
358.206	She forms this women's group
358.206	to try to keep her community together.
363.169	And this was a reality
363.169	that really struck me,
368.353	because of course,
368.353	Constance Okollet wasn't responsible
372.762	for the greenhouse gas emissions
372.762	that were causing this problem.
376.809	Indeed, I was very struck
376.809	about the situation in Malawi
380.975	in January of this year.
382.881	There was an unprecedented
382.881	flooding in the country,
386.032	it covered about a third of the country,
388.438	over 300 people were killed,
390.628	and hundreds of thousands
390.628	lost their livelihoods.
394.388	And the average person in Malawi
397.508	emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year.
403.166	The average US citizen emits
403.166	about 17.5 metric tons.
409.126	So those who are suffering
409.126	disproportionately
412.841	don't drive cars, don't have electricity,
412.841	don't consume very significantly,
419.706	and yet they are feeling more and more
422.888	the impacts of the changes in the climate,
427.301	the changes that are preventing them
427.301	from knowing how to grow food properly,
431.594	and knowing how
431.594	to look after their future.
435.514	I think it was really
435.514	the importance of the injustice
443.031	that really struck me very forcibly.
446.061	And I know that we're not able
446.061	to address some of that injustice
453.136	because we're not on course
453.136	for a safe world.
456.627	Governments around the world agreed
456.627	at the conference in Copenhagen,
463.04	and have repeated it
463.04	at every conference on climate,
466.778	that we have to stay
466.778	below two degrees Celsius
470.262	of warming above pre-Industrial standards.
473.673	But we're on course
473.673	for about four degrees.
476.609	So we face an existential threat
476.609	to the future of our planet.
481.506	And that made me realize
483.15	that climate change is the greatest threat
483.15	to human rights in the 21st century.
489.566	And that brought me then
489.566	to climate justice.
493.225	Climate justice responds
493.225	to the moral argument --
497.408	both sides of the moral argument --
499.464	to address climate change.
501.906	First of all,
503.081	to be on the side of those who are
503.081	suffering most and are most effected.
507.294	And secondly,
508.675	to make sure that they're not left behind
508.675	again, when we start to move
513.7	and start to address climate change
513.7	with climate action,
516.533	as we are doing.
519.834	In our very unequal world today,
522.652	it's very striking how many
522.652	people are left behind.
526.929	In our world of 7.2 billion people,
526.929	about 3 billion are left behind.
533.262	1.3 billion don't have access
533.262	to electricity,
537.699	and they light their homes
537.699	with kerosene and candles,
541.227	both of which are dangerous.
542.926	And in fact they spend a lot of their
542.926	tiny income on that form of lighting.
549.441	2.6 billion people cook on open fires --
553.794	on coal, wood and animal dung.
557.327	And this causes
557.327	about 4 million deaths a year
562.025	from indoor smoke inhalation,
564.271	and of course, most of those
564.271	who die are women.
568.792	So we have a very unequal world,
573.046	and we need to change
573.046	"from ""business as usual."""
579.125	And we shouldn't underestimate
579.125	the scale and the transformative nature
585.213	of the change which will be needed,
587.974	because we have to go to zero
587.974	carbon emissions by about 2050,
594.587	if we're going to stay below
594.587	two degrees Celsius of warming.
598.976	And that means we have to leave
598.976	about two-thirds of the known resources
604	of fossil fuels in the ground.
606.564	It's a very big change,
608.311	and it means that obviously,
610.867	industrialized countries
610.867	must cut their emissions,
613.533	must become much more energy-efficient,
615.628	and must move as quickly as possible
615.628	to renewable energy.
620.199	For developing countries
620.199	and emerging economies,
624.603	the problem and the challenge
624.603	is to grow without emissions,
629.184	because they must develop;
629.184	they have very poor populations.
632.522	So they must develop without emissions,
632.522	and that is a different kind of problem.
638.59	Indeed, no country in the world
638.59	has actually grown without emissions.
644.132	All the countries have developed
644.132	with fossil fuels,
646.56	and then may be moving
646.56	to renewable energy.
648.882	So it is a very big challenge,
651.245	and it requires the total support
651.245	of the international community,
655.979	with the necessary finance and technology,
655.979	and systems and support,
660.939	because no country can make itself safe
660.939	from the dangers of climate change.
668.007	This is an issue that requires
668.007	complete human solidarity.
673.306	Human solidarity, if you like,
673.306	based on self-interest --
676.667	because we are all in this together,
678.971	and we have to work together
680.39	to ensure that we reach
680.39	zero carbon by 2050.
686.675	The good news is that change is happening,
689.462	and it's happening very fast.
692.131	Here in California,
693.429	there's a very ambitious
693.429	emissions target to cut emissions.
697.966	In Hawaii, they're passing legislation
700.795	to have 100 percent
700.795	renewable energy by 2045.
705.731	And governments are very ambitious
705.731	around the world.
709.731	In Costa Rica, they have committed
709.731	to being carbon-neutral by 2021.
715.11	In Ethiopia, the commitment
715.11	is to be carbon-neutral by 2027.
721.921	Apple have pledged that their factories
721.921	in China will use renewable energy.
728.44	And there is a race on at the moment
731.317	to convert electricity
731.317	from tidal and wave power,
735.278	in order that we can leave
735.278	the coal in the ground.
739.521	And that change is both welcome
739.521	and is happening very rapidly.
744.368	But it's still not enough,
745.777	and the political will
745.777	is still not enough.
748.475	Let me come back to President Tong
748.475	and his people in Kiribati.
754.077	They actually could be able to live
754.077	on their island and have a solution,
760.892	but it would take a lot of political will.
763.6	President Tong told me
763.6	about his ambitious idea
767.772	to either build up or even float
767.772	the little islands where his people live.
775.018	This, of course, is beyond
775.018	the resources of Kiribati itself.
779.425	It would require great solidarity
779.425	and support from other countries,
783.18	and it would require
783.18	the kind of imaginative idea
787.426	that we bring together when we want
787.426	to have a space station in the air.
792.436	But wouldn't it be wonderful
792.436	to have this engineering wonder
797.315	and to allow a people to remain
797.315	in their sovereign territory,
800.872	and be part of the community of nations?
804.015	That is the kind of idea
804.015	that we should be thinking about.
809.681	Yes, the challenges
809.681	of the transformation we need are big,
814.479	but they can be solved.
817.051	We are actually, as a people,
819.106	very capable of coming together
819.106	to solve problems.
822.806	I was very conscious of this
822.806	as I took part this year
826.464	in commemoration of the 70th anniversary
830.245	of the end of the Second
830.245	World War in 1945.
839.367	It was a year when the world faced
841.997	what must have seemed almost
841.997	insoluble problems --
845.548	the devastation of the world wars,
845.548	particularly the Second World War;
850.121	the fragile peace that had
850.121	been brought about;
853.352	the need for a whole
853.352	economic regeneration.
856.643	But the leaders of that time
856.643	didn't flinch from this.
860.892	They had the capacity, they had
860.892	a sense of being driven by
865.246	never again must the world
865.246	have this kind of problem.
869.321	And they had to build structures
869.321	for peace and security.
873.061	And what did we get?
873.061	What did they achieve?
876.546	The Charter of the United Nations,
879.189	the Bretton Woods institutions,
879.189	as they're called, The World Bank,
882.764	and the International Monetary Fund.
885.225	A Marshall Plan for Europe,
885.225	a devastated Europe,
888.623	to reconstruct it.
890.569	And indeed a few years later,
892.654	the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	in its importance
902.002	to 1945, with similar challenges
902.002	and similar potential.
907.377	There will be two big summits this year:
910.424	the first one, in September in New York,
913.227	is the summit for the sustainable
913.227	development goals.
917.071	And then the summit in Paris in December,
917.071	to give us a climate agreement.
923.365	The sustainable development goals
923.365	are intended to help countries
929.716	to live sustainably,
929.716	in tune with Mother Earth,
933.85	not to take out of Mother Earth
933.85	and destroy ecosystems,
939.2	but rather, to live in harmony
939.2	with Mother Earth,
942.838	by living under sustainable development.
946.691	And the sustainable development goals
949.088	will come into operation for all countries
951.497	on January 1, 2016.
954.814	The climate agreement --
956.015	a binding climate agreement --
957.555	is needed because
957.555	of the scientific evidence
961.243	that we're on a trajectory
961.243	for about a four-degree world
964.184	and we have to change course
964.184	to stay below two degrees.
968.033	So we need to take steps
968.033	that will be monitored and reviewed,
973.581	so that we can keep increasing
973.581	the ambition of how we cut emissions,
978.003	and how we move more rapidly
978.003	to renewable energy,
981.143	so that we have a safe world.
987.665	The reality is that this issue
987.665	is much too important
993.872	to be left to politicians
993.872	and to the United Nations.
997.459	(Laughter)
998.484	It's an issue for all of us,
1000.086	and it's an issue where we need
1000.086	more and more momentum.
1004.911	Indeed, the face of
1004.911	the environmentalist has changed,
1008.42	because of the justice dimension.
1010.753	It's now an issue
1010.753	for faith-based organizations,
1013.997	under very good leadership
1013.997	from Pope Francis,
1017.193	and indeed, the Church of England,
1018.989	which is divesting from fossil fuels.
1021.456	It's an issue for the business community,
1025.238	and the good news is
1026.666	that the business community
1026.666	is changing very rapidly --
1029.6	except for the fossil fuel industries --
1031.809	(Laughter)
1033.428	Even they are beginning
1033.428	to slightly change their language --
1036.748	but only slightly.
1037.753	But business is not only moving rapidly
1037.753	to the benefits of renewable energy,
1042.468	but is urging politicians
1042.468	to give them more signals,
1045.215	so that they can move even more rapidly.
1047.214	It's an issue for the trade
1047.214	union movement.
1049.239	It's an issue for the women's movement.
1051.286	It's an issue for young people.
1053.388	I was very struck when I learned
1053.388	that Jibreel Khazan,
1059.214	one of the Greensboro Four who had
1059.214	taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins,
1064.882	said quite recently that
1066.42	climate change is the lunch counter
1066.42	moment for young people.
1072.446	So, lunch counter moment
1072.446	for young people of the 21st century --
1076.758	the sort of real human rights issue
1076.758	of the 21st century,
1081.123	because he said it is
1081.123	the greatest challenge
1083.917	to humanity and justice in our world.
1088.391	I recall very much
1088.391	the Climate March last September,
1092.521	and that was a huge momentum,
1094.346	not just in New York,
1094.346	but all around the world.
1097.332	and we have to build on that.
1099.626	I was marching with some
1099.626	of The Elders family,
1102.761	and I saw a placard
1102.761	a little bit away from me,
1107.812	but we were wedged so closely together --
1109.79	because after all, there were 400,000
1109.79	people out in the streets of New York --
1113.489	so I couldn't quite get to that placard,
1115.426	I would have just liked to have been
1115.426	able to step behind it,
1118.531	"because it said, ""Angry Grannies!"""
1121.001	(Laughter)
1122.348	That's what I felt.
1123.826	And I have five grandchildren now,
1127.823	I feel very happy as an Irish grandmother
1127.823	to have five grandchildren,
1132.135	and I think about their world,
1135.202	and what it will be
1135.202	like when they will share that world
1138.387	with about 9 billion other people in 2050.
1143.574	We know that inevitably it will
1143.574	be a climate-constrained world,
1148.253	because of the emissions
1148.253	we've already put up there,
1151.126	but it could be a world that is much
1151.126	more equal and much fairer,
1156.547	and much better for health,
1156.547	and better for jobs
1159.153	and better for energy security,
1161.149	than the world we have now,
1163	if we have switched sufficiently
1163	and early enough to renewable energy,
1170.222	and no one is left behind.
1172.678	No one is left behind.
1175.736	And just as we've been
1175.736	looking back this year --
1179.34	in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years --
1184.871	I would like to think
1184.871	that they will look back,
1187.459	that world will look back
1195.23	and that they will say,
1198.072	"""Weren't they good"
1198.072	to do what they did in 2015?
1202.203	We really appreciate that they took
1202.203	the decisions that made a difference,
1207.702	and that put the world
1207.702	on the right pathway,
1210.664	"and we benefit now from that pathway,"""
1213.394	that they will feel that somehow
1213.394	we took our responsibilities,
1217.299	we did what was done
1217.299	in 1945 in similar terms,
1221.482	we didn't miss the opportunity,
1223.927	we lived up to our responsibilities.
1226.133	That's what this year is about.
1229.688	And somehow for me,
1231.062	it's captured in words of somebody
1231.062	that I admired very much.
1235.38	She was a mentor of mine,
1235.38	she was a friend,
1237.737	she died much too young,
1239.709	she was an extraordinary personality,
1241.738	a great champion of the environment:
1244.246	Wangari Maathai.
1246.627	Wangari said once,
1249.277	"""In the course of history,"
1251.255	there comes a time
1251.255	when humanity is called upon
1255.29	to shift to a new level of consciousness,
1260.065	"to reach a higher moral ground."""
1264.135	And that's what we have to do.
1266.078	We have to reach
1266.078	a new level of consciousness,
1269.39	a higher moral ground.
1271.791	And we have to do it this year
1271.791	in those two big summits.
1276.108	And that won't happen unless
1276.108	we have the momentum
1279.73	from people around the world who say:
1282.901	"""We want action now,"
1284.445	we want to change course,
1286.04	we want a safe world,
1287.437	a safe world for future generations,
1289.636	a safe world for our children
1289.636	and our grandchildren,
1292.268	"and we're all in this together."""
1294.563	Thank you.
1295.747	(Applause)
