26	There's an ancient and universal concept
26	that words have power,
30	that spells exist,
31.358	and that if we could only
31.358	pronounce the right words,
34.079	then -- whoosh! -- you know,
34.079	an avalanche would come
36.932	and wipe out the hobbits, right?
38.961	So this is a very attractive idea,
40.972	because we're very lazy,
40.972	like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,
43.623	or the world's greatest
43.623	computer programmer.
45.718	This idea has a lot of traction with us.
47.652	We love the idea that words,
47.652	when pronounced,
49.814	are little more than pure information,
51.656	but they evoke physical action
51.656	in the real world
53.939	that helps us do work.
55.122	So, of course, with lots
55.122	of programmable computers
57.554	and robots around,
58.729	this is an easy thing to picture.
60.585	How many of you know
60.585	what I'm talking about?
62.674	Raise your right hand.
63.849	How many don't know
63.849	what I'm talking about?
65.876	Raise your left hand.
67.051	So that's great. So that was too easy.
69.954	You guys have very insecure computers, OK?
73.097	So now the thing is,
73.097	this is a different kind of spell.
76.749	This is a computer program
76.749	made of zeros and ones.
79.13	It can be pronounced on a computer,
79.13	does something like this.
82.012	The important thing is we can write it
82.012	in a high-level language.
85.046	A computer magician can write this thing.
87.032	It can be compiled into zeros and ones
87.032	and pronounced by a computer.
90.27	And that's what makes computers powerful,
92.293	these high-level languages
92.293	that can be compiled.
94.577	And so, I'm here to tell you,
94.577	you don't need a computer
97.457	to actually have a spell.
99.375	In fact, what you can do
99.375	at the molecular level
101.684	is that if you encode information --
103.682	you encode a spell
103.682	or program as molecules --
105.896	then physics can actually directly
105.896	interpret that information
109.539	and run a program.
110.714	It's what happens in proteins.
112.17	When this amino-acid sequence
112.17	gets pronounced as atoms,
114.815	these little letters
114.815	are sticky for each other.
117.059	It collapses into a three-dimensional
117.059	shape that turns it into a nanomachine
120.967	that actually cuts DNA.
122.561	The interesting thing
122.561	is that if you change the sequence,
125.338	you change the three-dimensional folding.
127.37	You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.
129.354	These are the kind of molecular programs
129.354	we want to be able to write.
132.64	The problem is, we don't know
134.05	the machine language of proteins
134.05	or have a compiler for proteins.
137.203	So I've joined a growing band of people
139.093	that try to make
139.093	molecular spells using DNA.
141.331	We use DNA because it's cheaper,
141.331	it's easier to handle,
143.959	it's something
143.959	we understand really well --
146.054	so well, in fact, that we think
146.054	we can actually write
149.161	programming languages for DNA
149.161	and have molecular compilers.
152.598	So then, we think we can do that.
154.203	One of my first questions doing this was:
157.712	How can you make an arbitrary shape
157.712	or pattern out of DNA?
160.507	I decided to use a type of DNA origami,
162.742	where you take a long strand of DNA
164.471	and fold it into whatever shape
164.471	or pattern you might want.
167.304	So here's a shape.
168.491	I actually spent about a year in my home
168.491	in my underwear, coding,
171.875	like Linus [Torvalds],
171.875	in that picture before.
174.051	This program takes a shape
174.051	and spits out 250 DNA sequences.
177.62	These short DNA sequences
177.62	are what are going to fold the long strand
180.841	into this shape that we want to make.
182.634	So you send an e-mail
182.634	with these sequences in it
184.905	to a company,
186.081	and the company pronounces them
186.081	on a DNA synthesizer,
188.784	a machine about the size of a photocopier.
191.298	And they take your e-mail,
193.298	and every letter in your e-mail,
193.298	they replace with a 30-atom cluster --
196.683	one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.
199.113	They string them up in the right sequence,
201.148	and then they send them
201.148	back to you via FedEx.
203.333	So you get 250 of these
203.333	in the mail in little tubes.
205.798	I mix them together,
205.798	add a little bit of salt water,
208.265	and then add this long strand
208.265	I was telling you about,
210.825	that I've stolen from a virus.
212.309	And then what happens is,
213.556	you heat this whole thing up
213.556	to about boiling.
215.734	You cool it down to room temperature,
217.82	and as you do, those short strands
217.82	do the following thing:
221.006	each one of them binds
221.006	that long strand in one place,
224.426	and then has a second half that binds
224.426	that long strand in a distant place,
227.998	and brings those two parts
227.998	of the long strand
230.291	close together so they stick together.
232.36	So the net effect
232.36	of all 250 of these strands
235.071	is to fold the long strand
235.071	into the shape you're looking for.
239.422	It'll approximate that shape.
240.838	We do this for real, in the test tube.
242.691	In each little drop of water,
242.691	you get 50 billion of these guys.
245.683	With a microscope,
245.683	you can see them on a surface.
248.022	The neat thing is if you change
248.022	the sequence and change the spell,
251.161	just change the sequence of the staples,
253.116	you can make a molecule
253.116	that looks like this.
255.942	And, you know, he likes
255.942	to hang out with his buddies.
258.976	A lot of them are actually pretty good.
260.886	If you change the spell again,
260.886	you change the sequence again,
263.792	you get really nice,
266.122	If you do it again,
267.509	you can get arbitrary patterns.
269.744	So on a rectangle, you can paint
269.744	patterns of North and South America,
274.165	"or the words, ""DNA."""
275.37	So that's DNA origami. That's one way.
278.407	There are many ways
278.407	of casting molecular spells using DNA.
282.374	What we really want to do in the end
284.14	is learn how to program self-assembly
284.14	so we can build anything, right?
288	We want to be able to build
288	technological artifacts
290.414	that are maybe good for the world.
292.099	We want to learn how to build
292.099	biological artifacts,
295.054	like people and whales and trees.
296.799	And if it's the case that we can reach
296.799	that level of complexity,
299.845	if our ability to program molecules
299.845	gets to be that good,
303.129	then that will truly be magic.
305.889	Thank you very much.
307.064	(Applause)
