40.472	Where the highs are heaven,

44.441	oh, they can be hell.
47.03	You can grab the ring,
50.806	you can ring that bell,
54.241	when the ride is over,
58.59	you can never tell.
63.835	People tell you this one thing --
67.678	will make your life complete.
70.361	So you,
71.791	you give it everything you got
74.328	and you wind up on the street.
79.545	Then one day you wake up,
83.529	"and they tell you ""you're a queen,"""
87.478	but then you find that someone else
91.285	is pulling on the strings.
93.462	Rollercoaster,

113.126	you can ring that bell,

125.963	The one you love,
127.332	they love you --
128.381	oh yeah --
130.012	until the end of time.
133.901	But lose your edge or lose your cool,
136.521	they will drop you like a dime.
141.538	Everyone is crowding 'round
145.5	when fortune is your friend.
149.36	When your luck is running out,

174.953	you can ring that bell,
178.349	when the ride is over
182.583	you can never tell.
187.984	Well, maybe I'm just cynical,
191.868	and all these words are lies,
195.858	but experience keeps telling me
198.649	that the cautious one is wise.
203.668	But caution makes you hesitate,
207.524	and hesitate you're lost,
211.422	so take your opportunities
215.329	and never count the cost.

236.771	you can ring that bell,
240.257	when the ride is over --
242.791	over, over,
244.564	you can never, ever tell.
