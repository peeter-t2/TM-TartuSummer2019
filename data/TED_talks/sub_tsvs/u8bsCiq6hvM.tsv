16.331	Ladies and gentlemen,
17.507	I present to you the human genome.
19.658	(Applause)
23.561	Chromosome one -- top left,
23.561	bottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.
27.518	Women have two copies
27.518	of that big X chromosome;
30.27	men have the X and, of course,
30.27	that small copy of the Y.
33.459	Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny
33.459	little thing that makes you different.
37.174	So if you zoom in on this genome,
40.19	then what you see, of course,
40.19	is this double-helix structure --
43.832	the code of life spelled out
43.832	with these four biochemical letters,
46.99	or we call them bases: A, C, G and T.
49.26	How many are there
49.26	in the human genome? Three billion.
51.856	Is that a big number?
53.06	Well, everybody
53.06	can throw around big numbers.
55.303	But in fact, if I were to place one base
57.427	on each pixel of this
61.214	we would need 3,000 screens
61.214	to take a look at the genome.
64.517	So it's really quite big.
65.749	And perhaps because of its size,
67.668	a group of people -- all,
67.668	by the way, with Y chromosomes --
70.543	decided they would want to sequence it.
72.577	(Laughter)
74.616	And so 15 years, actually,
74.616	and about four billion dollars later,
77.897	the genome was sequenced and published.
79.796	In 2003, the final version was published,
79.796	and they keep working on it.
83.14	That was all done on a machine like this.
85.153	It costs about a dollar for each base --
85.153	a very slow way of doing it.
88.494	Well, folks, I'm here to tell you
90.113	that the world has completely changed,
92.228	and none of you know about it.
94.062	So now what we do is take a genome,
96.775	we make maybe 50 copies of it,
98.338	we cut all those copies up
98.338	into little 50-base reads,
101.382	and then we sequence them,
101.382	massively parallel.
103.747	Then we bring that into software
103.747	and reassemble it,
106.858	and tell you what the story is.
108.452	So to give you a picture
108.452	of what this looks like,
110.791	the Human Genome Project:
110.791	3 gigabases, right?
113.298	One run on one of these modern machines:
117.974	And that 200 is going
117.974	to change to 600 this summer,
120.511	and there's no sign of this pace slowing.
123.069	The price of a base, to sequence a base,
126.678	has fallen 100 million times.
129.455	That's the equivalent of you filling up
129.455	your car with gas in 1998,
133.255	waiting until 2011,
134.508	and now you can drive
134.508	to Jupiter and back twice.
136.945	(Laughter)
141.709	World population,
144.121	PC placements,
145.971	the archive of all of medical literature,
148.757	Moore's law,
150.479	the old way of sequencing,
152.332	and here's all the new stuff.
154.113	Guys, this is a long scale;
155.478	you don't typically see
155.478	lines that go up like that.
158.702	So the worldwide capacity
158.702	to sequence human genomes
162.184	is something like 50,000 to 100,000
162.184	human genomes this year.
165.377	We know this based on the machines
165.377	that are being placed.
168.104	This is expected to double,
168.104	triple or maybe quadruple
170.645	year over year for the foreseeable future.
172.879	In fact, there's one lab in particular
174.888	that represents 20 percent
174.888	of all that capacity:
177.848	It's called the Beijing
177.848	Genomics Institute.
180.666	The Chinese are absolutely winning
180.666	this race to the new Moon, by the way.
184.395	What does this mean for medicine?
186.72	So a woman, age 37,
189.468	presents with stage 2 estrogen
189.468	receptor-positive breast cancer.
192.706	She is treated with surgery,
192.706	chemotherapy and radiation.
195.897	She goes home.
197.105	Two years later,
198.28	she comes back with stage 3C
198.28	ovarian cancer, unfortunately;
201.478	treated again with surgery
201.478	and chemotherapy.
203.939	She comes back three years later at age 42
206.217	with more ovarian cancer,
206.217	more chemotherapy.
208.598	Six months later,
210.091	she comes back
210.091	with acute myeloid leukemia.
214.819	She goes into respiratory failure
214.819	and dies eight days later.
217.849	So first: the way in which
217.849	this woman was treated,
220.231	in as little as 10 years,
220.231	will look like bloodletting.
223.698	And it's because of people
223.698	like my colleague, Rick Wilson,
226.547	at the Genome Institute
226.547	at Washington University,
228.91	who decided to take a look
228.91	at this woman postmortem.
231.393	And he took skin cells, healthy skin
233.9	and cancerous bone marrow,
235.862	and sequenced the whole
235.862	genomes of both of them
238.172	in a couple of weeks, no big deal.
240.26	Then he compared those two
240.26	genomes in software,
242.485	and what he found, among other things,
244.334	was a deletion -- a 2,000-base deletion
244.334	across three billion bases
248.971	in a particular gene called TP53.
251.154	If you have this deleterious
251.154	mutation in this gene,
253.59	you're 90 percent likely
253.59	to get cancer in your life.
256.336	So unfortunately,
256.336	this doesn't help this woman,
258.584	but it does have severe --
258.584	profound, if you will --
261.26	implications to her family.
264.061	I mean, if they have the same mutation,
265.968	and they get this genetic test
265.968	and they understand it,
268.537	then they can get regular screens
268.537	and can catch cancer early,
271.442	and potentially live
271.442	a significantly longer life.
273.786	Let me introduce you to the Beery twins,
275.74	diagnosed with cerebral palsy
275.74	at the age of two.
278.096	Their mom is a very brave woman
278.096	who didn't believe it;
280.668	the symptoms weren't matching up.
282.295	And through some heroic efforts
282.295	and a lot of Internet searching,
285.327	she was able to convince
285.327	the medical community
287.522	that, in fact, they had something else.
289.442	They had dopa-responsive dystonia.
291.632	And so they were given L-Dopa,
293.635	and their symptoms did improve,
295.976	but they weren't totally asymptomatic.
297.843	Significant problems remained.
299.334	Turns out the gentleman in this picture
299.334	is a guy named Joe Beery,
302.527	who was lucky enough to be the CIO
304.194	of a company called Life Technologies.
306.339	They're one of two companies
307.705	that makes these massive
307.705	whole-genome sequencing tools.
310.879	And so he got his kids sequenced.
313.916	What they found was a series of mutations
313.916	in a gene called SPR,
317.018	which is responsible for producing
317.018	serotonin, among other things.
320.439	So on top of L-Dopa, they gave
320.439	these kids a serotonin precursor drug,
323.952	and they're effectively normal now.
325.698	Guys, this would never have happened
325.698	without whole-genome sequencing.
329.013	At the time -- this was
329.013	a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.
331.877	Today it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,
333.728	the year after, $100, give or take a year.
335.781	That's how fast this is moving.
337.305	So here's little Nick --
339.186	likes Batman and squirt guns.
340.926	And it turns out Nick
340.926	shows up at the children's hospital
344.645	with this distended belly,
344.645	like a famine victim.
346.931	And it's not that he's not eating;
346.931	it's that when he eats,
349.791	his intestine basically opens up
349.791	and feces spill out into his gut.
353.226	So a hundred surgeries later,
354.885	he looks at his mom and says,
354.885	"""Mom, please pray for me."
358.584	"I'm in so much pain."""
360.408	His pediatrician happens to have
360.408	a background in clinical genetics
363.547	and he has no idea what's going on,
365.26	"but he says, ""Let's get"
365.26	"this kid's genome sequenced."""
367.827	And what they find
367.827	is a single-point mutation
369.991	in a gene responsible for controlling
369.991	programmed cell death.
372.864	So the theory is that he's having
372.864	some immunological reaction
375.966	to what's going on --
375.966	to the food, essentially.
378.405	And that's a natural reaction,
378.405	which causes some programmed cell death,
381.799	but the gene that regulates
381.799	that down is broken.
384.093	And so this informs,
384.093	among other things, of course,
386.535	a treatment for bone marrow transplant,
386.535	which he undertakes.
389.53	And after nine months
389.53	of grueling recovery,
391.574	he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
393.503	(Laughter)
394.624	The prospect of using the genome
394.624	as a universal diagnostic
398.747	is upon us today.
401.462	Today. It's here.
403.025	And what it means for all of us
404.541	is that everybody in this room
404.541	could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,
407.852	just because of this one thing.
409.543	Which is a fantastic story,
411.63	unless you think about
411.63	humanity's footprint on the planet,
414.532	and our ability to keep up
414.532	food production.
417.031	So it turns out
418.627	that the very same technology
418.627	is also being used to grow new lines
422.592	of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops
425.745	that are highly tolerant
425.745	of drought, of flood,
427.944	of pests and pesticides.
429.491	Now, look --
431.184	as long as we continue
431.184	to increase the population,
433.582	we'll have to continue to grow and eat
433.582	genetically modified foods.
436.785	And that's the only position
436.785	I'll take today.
438.96	Unless there's anybody in the audience
440.802	who'd like to volunteer to stop eating?
443.047	None, not one.
444.961	This is a typewriter,
446.696	a staple of every desktop for decades.
449.339	And, in fact, the typewriter
449.339	was essentially deleted by this thing.
453.503	And then more general versions
453.503	of word processors came about.
456.792	But ultimately, it was a disruption
456.792	on top of a disruption.
459.595	It was Bob Metcalfe
459.595	inventing the Ethernet,
461.687	and the connection of all these computers
463.68	that fundamentally changed everything.
465.554	Suddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.
468.379	And we had, indeed,
468.379	the entire dot-com bubble.
471.948	(Laughter)
474.78	Not to worry though,
476.027	that was quickly rescued
476.027	by the iPod, Facebook
478.626	and, indeed, Angry Birds.
480.753	(Laughter)
483.125	Look, this is where we are today.
485.675	This is the genomic revolution today.
485.675	This is where we are.
488.489	What I'd like you to consider is:
490.093	What does it mean
491.522	when these dots don't represent
491.522	the individual bases of your genome,
494.903	but they connect to genomes
494.903	all across the planet?
497.778	I just recently had to buy life insurance,
497.778	and I was required to answer:
501.39	A. I have never had a genetic test;
503.545	B. I've had one, here you go;
505.052	or C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
507.021	Thankfully, I was able to answer A,
508.761	and I say that honestly, in case
508.761	my life insurance agent is listening.
512.333	But what would have happened
512.333	if I had said C?
514.756	Consumer applications
514.756	for genomics will flourish.
517.181	Do you want to see
517.181	if you're genetically compatible
519.654	with your girlfriend?
520.908	DNA sequencing on your iPhone?
520.908	There's an app for that.
523.895	(Laughter)
525.705	Personalized genomic massage, anyone?
529.038	There's already a lab today that tests
529.038	for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,
533.629	the so-called cheating gene.
535.037	(Laughter)
537.076	So anybody who's here today
537.076	with your significant other,
539.727	just turn over to them,
539.727	swab their mouth, send it to the lab
542.618	and you'll know for sure.
543.911	(Laughter)
545.046	Do you really want to elect a president
547.012	whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
549.298	Think of it -- it's 2016,
551.182	and the leading candidate releases
552.912	not only her four years
552.912	of back-tax returns,
555.018	but also her personal genome.
556.495	And it looks really good.
557.729	Then she challenges all
557.729	her competitors to do the same.
560.349	Do you think that's not going to happen?
562.308	Do you think it would have
562.308	helped John McCain?
564.566	(Laughter)
566.383	How many people in the audience
566.383	have the last name Resnick, like me?
569.625	Raise your hand.
570.807	Anybody? Nobody.
572.435	Typically, there's one or two.
573.904	So my father's father
573.904	was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
576.481	They all hated each other, and all moved
576.481	to different parts of the planet.
580.59	So it's likely I'm related
580.59	to every Resnick that I ever meet,
583.533	but I don't know.
584.708	So imagine if my genome
584.708	were De-identified, sitting in software,
587.769	And a third cousin's genome
587.769	was also sitting there,
590.177	and there was software
590.177	that could compare the two
592.502	and make these associations.
593.883	Not hard to imagine. My company
593.883	has software that does this right now.
597.215	Imagine one more thing,
598.407	that that software is able to ask
598.407	both parties for mutual consent:
601.666	"""Would you be willing"
601.666	"to meet your third cousin?"""
604.015	And if we both say yes -- voilà!
605.689	Welcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.
607.49	(Laughter)
611.808	Now this is probably a good thing, right?
613.825	Bigger clan gatherings and so on.
615.437	But maybe it's a bad thing as well.
617.162	How many fathers in the room?
617.162	Raise your hands.
619.467	OK, so experts think
619.467	that one to three percent of you
622.819	are not actually the father of your child.
624.946	(Laughter)
626.724	Look --
627.924	(Laughter)
632.871	These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,
635.26	they don't in any way represent
635.26	the quality of our relationships
638.649	or the nature of our society --
638.649	at least not yet.
641.366	And like any new technology,
643.185	it's really in humanity's hands
644.998	to wield it for the betterment of mankind
647.22	or not.
648.395	And so I urge you all
648.395	to wake up and to tune in
650.642	and to influence the genomic revolution
650.642	that's happening all around you.
654.062	Thank you.
655.237	(Applause)
