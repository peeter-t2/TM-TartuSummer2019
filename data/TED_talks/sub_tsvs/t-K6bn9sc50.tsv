12.853	In 1956, a documentary
12.853	by Jacques Cousteau won
17.661	both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.
20.686	This film was called,
20.686	"""Le Monde Du Silence,"""
23.571	"or, ""The Silent World."""
26.247	The premise of the title was that
26.247	the underwater world was a quiet world.
32.279	We now know, 60 years later,
34.618	that the underwater world
34.618	is anything but silent.
38.497	Although the sounds
38.497	are inaudible above water
41.528	depending on where you are
41.528	and the time of year,
44.862	the underwater soundscape can be as noisy
44.862	as any jungle or rainforest.
51.611	Invertebrates like snapping shrimp,
51.611	fish and marine mammals
56.493	all use sound.
58.174	They use sound to study their habitat,
61.111	to keep in communication with each other,
63.437	to navigate,
64.744	to detect predators and prey.
67.557	They also use sound by listening
67.557	to know something about their environment.
72.87	Take, for an example, the Arctic.
75.573	It's considered a vast,
75.573	inhospitable place,
78.825	sometimes described as a desert,
81.43	because it is so cold and so remote
84.387	and ice-covered for much of the year.
87.088	And despite this,
88.825	there is no place on Earth
88.825	that I would rather be than the Arctic,
92.893	especially as days lengthen
92.893	and spring comes.
97.284	To me, the Arctic really
97.284	embodies this disconnect
101.611	between what we see on the surface
101.611	and what's going on underwater.
107.505	You can look out across the ice --
107.505	all white and blue and cold --
113.511	and see nothing.
115.473	But if you could hear underwater,
118.134	the sounds you would hear
118.134	would at first amaze
121.539	and then delight you.
123.65	And while your eyes are seeing
123.65	nothing for kilometers but ice,
127.696	your ears are telling you that out there
127.696	are bowhead and beluga whales,
133.183	walrus and bearded seals.
136.481	The ice, too, makes sounds.
138.414	It screeches and cracks
138.414	and pops and groans,
141.922	as it collides and rubs when temperature
141.922	or currents or winds change.
147.932	And under 100 percent sea ice
147.932	in the dead of winter,
152.604	bowhead whales are singing.
156.067	And you would never expect that,
157.958	because we humans,
160.173	we tend to be very visual animals.
163.254	For most of us, but not all,
166.323	our sense of sight is how
166.323	we navigate our world.
169.545	For marine mammals that live underwater,
172.261	where chemical cues
172.261	and light transmit poorly,
176.148	sound is the sense by which they see.
180.247	And sound transmits very well underwater,
182.585	much better than it does in air,
184.541	so signals can be heard
184.541	over great distances.
188.09	In the Arctic, this
188.09	is especially important,
191.205	because not only do Arctic marine
191.205	mammals have to hear each other,
195.142	but they also have to listen
195.142	for cues in the environment
198.277	that might indicate
198.277	heavy ice ahead or open water.
202.682	Remember, although they spend
202.682	most of their lives underwater,
206.105	they are mammals,
207.353	and so they have to surface to breathe.
210.278	So they might listen
210.278	for thin ice or no ice,
214.158	or listen for echoes off nearby ice.
218.914	Arctic marine mammals live in a rich
218.914	and varied underwater soundscape.
224.546	In the spring,
225.812	it can be a cacophony of sound.
229.149	(Marine mammal sounds)
244.989	But when the ice is frozen solid,
247.903	and there are no big temperature
247.903	shifts or current changes,
251.635	the underwater Arctic has some
251.635	of the lowest ambient noise levels
255.958	of the world's oceans.
257.702	But this is changing.
259.048	This is primarily due to a decrease
259.048	in seasonal sea ice,
263.616	which is a direct result of human
263.616	greenhouse gas emissions.
268.174	We are, in effect, with climate change,
271.104	conducting a completely uncontrolled
271.104	experiment with our planet.
275.585	Over the past 30 years,
277.698	areas of the Arctic have seen
277.698	decreases in seasonal sea ice
281.575	from anywhere from
281.575	six weeks to four months.
286.64	This decrease in sea ice is sometimes
286.64	referred to as an increase
291.274	in the open water season.
293.161	That is the time of year when
293.161	the Arctic is navigable to vessels.
297.38	And not only is the extent
297.38	of ice changing,
301.165	but the age and the width of ice is, too.
305.176	Now, you may well have heard
306.658	that a decrease in seasonal sea ice
306.658	is causing a loss of habitat
310.165	for animals that rely on sea ice,
312.32	such as ice seals,
312.32	or walrus, or polar bears.
316.678	Decreasing sea ice is also causing
316.678	increased erosion along coastal villages,
321.541	and changing prey availability
321.541	for marine birds and mammals.
326.139	Climate change and decreases in sea ice
329.241	are also altering the underwater
329.241	soundscape of the Arctic.
335.19	What do I mean by soundscape?
337.653	Those of us who eavesdrop
337.653	on the oceans for a living
340.534	use instruments called hydrophones,
342.812	which are underwater microphones,
344.881	and we record ambient noise --
346.851	the noise all around us.
348.799	And the soundscape describes
348.799	the different contributors
352.164	to this noise field.
354.563	What we are hearing on our hydrophones
357.188	are the very real sounds
357.188	of climate change.
361.323	We are hearing these changes
361.323	from three fronts:
364.651	from the air,
366.447	from the water
367.924	and from land.
370.139	First: air.
373.724	Wind on water creates waves.
376.361	These waves make bubbles;
378.21	the bubbles break,
379.601	and when they do,
381.131	they make noise.
382.358	And this noise is like a hiss
382.358	or a static in the background.
387.118	In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,
390.093	most of the noise from wind
390.093	doesn't make it into the water column,
393.748	because the ice acts as a buffer
393.748	between the atmosphere and the water.
398.82	This is one of the reasons
400.189	that the Arctic can have
400.189	very low ambient noise levels.
404.654	But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,
407.308	not only is the Arctic now open
407.308	to this wave noise,
412.279	but the number of storms
412.279	and the intensity of storms in the Arctic
415.79	has been increasing.
417.545	All of this is raising noise levels
417.545	in a previously quiet ocean.
422.568	Second: water.
426.301	With less seasonal sea ice,
428.199	subarctic species are moving north,
430.899	and taking advantage of the new habitat
430.899	that is created by more open water.
436.324	Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,
439.373	they have no dorsal fin,
441.109	because they have evolved to live
441.109	and swim in ice-covered waters,
445.901	and having something sticking
445.901	off of your back is not very conducive
449.448	to migrating through ice,
451.282	and may, in fact, be excluding
451.282	animals from the ice.
455.655	But now, everywhere we've listened,
458.326	we're hearing the sounds
458.326	of fin whales and humpback whales
461.408	and killer whales,
462.901	further and further north,
465.156	and later and later in the season.
467.823	We are hearing, in essence,
469.259	an invasion of the Arctic
469.259	by subarctic species.
473.694	And we don't know what this means.
475.681	Will there be competition for food
475.681	between Arctic and subarctic animals?
480.785	Might these subarctic species introduce
480.785	diseases or parasites into the Arctic?
486.855	And what are the new sounds
486.855	that they are producing
489.656	doing to the soundscape underwater?
492.8	And third: land.
495.008	And by land ...
496.688	I mean people.
498.534	More open water means
498.534	increased human use of the Arctic.
503.074	Just this past summer,
504.416	a massive cruise ship made its way
504.416	through the Northwest Passage --
508.621	the once-mythical route
508.621	between Europe and the Pacific.
513.206	Decreases in sea ice have allowed
513.206	humans to occupy the Arctic more often.
519.987	It has allowed increases in oil
519.987	and gas exploration and extraction,
524.652	the potential for commercial shipping,
527.306	as well as increased tourism.
530.214	And we now know that ship noise increases
530.214	levels of stress hormones in whales
535.103	and can disrupt feeding behavior.
537.871	Air guns, which produce loud,
537.871	"low-frequency ""whoomps"""
543.144	every 10 to 20 seconds,
545.742	changed the swimming and vocal
545.742	behavior of whales.
549.543	And all of these sound sources
549.543	are decreasing the acoustic space
554.505	over which Arctic marine mammals
554.505	can communicate.
558.734	Now, Arctic marine mammals
558.734	are used to very high levels of noise
563.142	at certain times of the year.
565.147	But this is primarily from other
565.147	animals or from sea ice,
569.247	and these are the sounds
569.247	with which they've evolved,
571.767	and these are sounds that are vital
571.767	to their very survival.
575.281	These new sounds
575.281	are loud and they're alien.
578.981	They might impact the environment
578.981	in ways that we think we understand,
584.156	but also in ways that we don't.
588.818	Remember, sound is the most
588.818	important sense for these animals.
593.643	And not only is the physical habitat
593.643	of the Arctic changing rapidly,
598.242	but the acoustic habitat is, too.
600.906	It's as if we've plucked these animals up
600.906	from the quiet countryside
604.647	and dropped them into a big city
604.647	in the middle of rush hour.
608.657	And they can't escape it.
611.505	So what can we do now?
614.839	We can't decrease wind speeds
617.251	or keep subarctic animals
617.251	from migrating north,
620.455	but we can work on local solutions
622.912	to reducing human-caused underwater noise.
626.637	One of these solutions
626.637	is to slow down ships
629.818	that traverse the Arctic,
631.632	because a slower ship is a quieter ship.
635.754	We can restrict access
635.754	in seasons and regions
639.57	that are important for mating
639.57	or feeding or migrating.
644.317	We can get smarter about quieting ships
647.645	and find better ways
647.645	to explore the ocean bottom.
651.547	And the good news is,
653.514	there are people
653.514	working on this right now.
658.06	But ultimately,
659.585	we humans have to do the hard work
662.476	of reversing or at the very
662.476	least decelerating
666.656	human-caused atmospheric changes.
669.152	So, let's return to this idea
669.152	of a silent world underwater.
674.826	It's entirely possible
676.345	that many of the whales
676.345	swimming in the Arctic today,
679.706	especially long-lived species
679.706	like the bowhead whale
683.265	that the Inuits say can live
683.265	two human lives --
687.046	it's possible that these whales
687.046	were alive in 1956,
690.831	when Jacques Cousteau made his film.
693.697	And in retrospect,
695.433	considering all the noise
695.433	we are creating in the oceans today,
700.464	"perhaps it really was ""The Silent World."""
704.693	Thank you.
705.981	(Applause)
