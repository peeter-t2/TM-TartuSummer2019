15.319	One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness,
19.243	so if it was one, two, three, four, it's you, sir.
23.537	You. Yeah. (Laughter)
25.096	With the weird teeth. And you next to him. (Laughter)
28.444	You know who you are.
29.499	Actually, that whole row isn't right. (Laughter)
31.896	That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me. (Laughter)
37.07	I am one of the one in four. Thank you.
42.183	I think I inherit it from my mother, who,
45.193	used to crawl around the house on all fours.
48.007	She had two sponges in her hand, and then she had two
51.054	tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent. (Laughter)
55.636	And she would crawl around behind me going,
57.944	"""Who brings footprints into a building?!"""
61.509	So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right.
63.859	So before I start, I would like to thank
69.051	the makers of Lamotrigine, Sertraline, and Reboxetine,
73.737	because without those few simple chemicals, I would not be vertical today.
78.66	So how did it start?
83.497	My mental illness -- well, I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness.
87.616	What am I going to talk about? Okay.
89.929	I always dreamt that, when I had my final breakdown,
94.331	it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque
96.87	existentialist revelation,
99.283	or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it. (Laughter)
103.628	But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown
106.735	during my daughter's sports day.
108.725	There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot
112.45	eating food out of the back of their car -- only the English --
116.457	eating their sausages. They loved their sausages. (Laughter)
122.684	Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac,
127.316	and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running,
129.779	"and all the mummies went, ""Run! Run Chlamydia! Run!"" (Laughter)"
134.99	"""Run like the wind, Veruca! Run!"""
138.858	And all the girlies, girlies running, running, running,
141.325	everybody except for my daughter, who was just standing
144.27	at the starting line, just waving,
147.037	because she didn't know she was supposed to run.
149.368	So I took to my bed for about a month, and when I woke up
153.717	I found I was institutionalized, and when I saw the other inmates,
158.31	I realized that I had found my people, my tribe. (Laughter)
162.702	Because they became my only friends, they became my friends,
166.19	because very few people that I knew -- Well, I wasn't
169.188	sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean, if I had had a broken leg
172.558	or I was with child I would have been inundated,
174.722	but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up.
178.398	Perk up.
180.098	Because I didn't think of that. (Laughter)
184.805	(Laughter) (Applause)
188.105	Because, you know, the one thing, one thing that you get with this disease,
192.382	this one comes with a package, is you get a real sense of shame,
196.348	"because your friends go, ""Oh come on, show me the lump,"
198.66	"show me the x-rays,"" and of course you've got nothing to show,"
201.071	so you're, like, really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking,
204.165	"""I'm not being carpet-bombed. I don't live in a township."""
206.981	So you start to hear these abusive voices, but you don't hear one abusive voice,
210.429	you hear about a thousand -- 100,000 abusive voices,
213.288	like if the Devil had Tourette's, that's what it would sound like.
217.297	But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil,
219.925	there are no voices in your head.
221.804	You know that when you have those abusive voices,
223.478	all those little neurons get together and in that little gap
226.379	"you get a real toxic ""I want to kill myself"" kind of chemical,"
230.037	and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape,
232.783	you might have yourself depression.
234.679	Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
237.362	If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally,
240.964	its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive
244.421	that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow,
248.413	so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
251.868	If a soldier sees his friend blown up, his brain goes into
255.345	such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words,
258.859	so he just feels the horror over and over again.
261.633	So here's my question. My question is, how come
264.006	when people have mental damage, it's always an active imagination?
268.051	How come every other organ in your body can get sick
271.27	and you get sympathy, except the brain?
273.974	I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain,
276.373	because I know you like that here at TED,
278.404	so if you just give me a minute here, okay.
281.857	Okay, let me just say, there's some good news.
283.863	There is some good news. First of all, let me say,
287.145	we've come a long, long way.
289.472	We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba,
293.513	tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.
298.11	Here we go. (Laughter)
300.01	This little baby has a lot of horsepower.
302.375	It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.
306.798	We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world.
310.391	We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world.
313.037	Here we've got a little bit of long-term memory,
314.656	so, you know that night you want to forget, when you got really drunk? Bye-bye! Gone. (Laughter)
319.893	So actually, it's filled with 100 billion neurons
323.213	just zizzing away, electrically transmitting information,
326.516	zizzing, zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here.
329.236	I don't know if you can get that here. (Laughter)
332.828	So, zizzing away, and so — (Laughter) —
336.828	And for every one — I know, I drew this myself. Thank you.
340.517	For every one single neuron, you can actually have
344.189	from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections
347.915	or dendrites or whatever you want to call it, and every time
351.177	you learn something, or you have an experience,
353.697	that bush grows, you know, that bush of information.
355.97	Can you imagine, every human being is carrying
358.924	that equipment, even Paris Hilton? (Laughter)
363.847	Go figure.
365.541	But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news.
369.025	This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four.
372.145	We are not equipped for the 21st century.
376.325	Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth,
380.074	and for people who say, oh, they're having a nice day,
382.657	they're perfectly fine, they're more insane than the rest of us.
386.217	Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches
388.741	in evolution. Okay, let me just explain this to you.
391.185	When we were ancient man — (Laughter) —
394.746	millions of years ago, and we suddenly felt threatened
398.507	by a predator, okay? — (Laughter) —
402.209	we would — Thank you. I drew these myself. (Laughter)
405.157	Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
408.98	Thank you. Anyway, we would fill up with our own adrenaline
413.054	and our own cortisol, and then we'd kill or be killed,
415.672	we'd eat or we'd be eaten, and then suddenly we'd de-fuel,
418.942	and we'd go back to normal. Okay.
420.875	So the problem is, nowadays, with modern man— (Laughter) —
426.157	when we feel in danger, we still fill up with our own chemical
429.924	but because we can't kill traffic wardens — (Laughter) —
434.559	or eat estate agents, the fuel just stays in our body
439.356	over and over, so we're in a constant state of alarm,
441.844	a constant state. And here's another thing that happened.
443.577	About 150,000 years ago, when language came online,
446.682	we started to put words to this constant emergency,
449.107	"so it wasn't just, ""Oh my God, there's a saber-toothed tiger,"""
451.763	"which could be, it was suddenly, ""Oh my God, I didn't send the email. Oh my God, my thighs are too fat."
455.804	"Oh my God, everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party!"""
459.809	So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes
462.295	over and over again that drives you insane, so,
464.831	you see what the problem is? What once made you safe
467.808	now drives you insane.
469.614	I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but somebody has to be.
472.768	Your pets are happier than you are. (Laughter)
478.632	(Applause)
481.528	So kitty cat, meow, happy happy happy, human beings, screwed. (Laughter)
486.683	Completely and utterly -- so, screwed.
488.958	But my point is, if we don't talk about this stuff,
491.417	and we don't learn how to deal with our lives, it's not going
493.755	to be one in four. It's going to be four in four
496.229	who are really, really going to get ill in the upstairs department.
499.492	And while we're at it, can we please stop the stigma?
502.019	Thank you. (Applause)
508.696	(Applause) Thank you.
