16.014	I'm going to talk today
16.014	about energy and climate.
20.363	And that might seem a bit surprising,
22.165	because my full-time work
22.165	at the foundation
25.338	is mostly about vaccines and seeds,
27.397	about the things that we need
27.397	to invent and deliver
30.989	to help the poorest two billion
30.989	live better lives.
35.741	But energy and climate
35.741	are extremely important to these people;
40.26	in fact, more important
40.26	than to anyone else on the planet.
45.053	The climate getting worse means
45.053	that many years, their crops won't grow:
50.788	there will be too much rain,
50.788	not enough rain;
53.843	things will change in ways their fragile
53.843	environment simply can't support.
59.804	And that leads to starvation, it leads
59.804	to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.
64.132	So, the climate changes
64.132	will be terrible for them.
68.093	Also, the price of energy
68.093	is very important to them.
71.26	In fact, if you could pick just one thing
73.562	to lower the price of to reduce poverty,
73.562	by far you would pick energy.
78.962	Now, the price of energy
78.962	has come down over time.
82.343	Really advanced civilization
82.343	is based on advances in energy.
89.038	The coal revolution fueled
89.038	the Industrial Revolution,
92.633	and, even in the 1900s,
92.633	we've seen a very rapid decline
96.718	in the price of electricity,
98.26	and that's why we have
98.26	refrigerators, air-conditioning;
101.666	we can make modern materials
101.666	and do so many things.
105.486	And so, we're in a wonderful situation
105.486	with electricity in the rich world.
112.544	But as we make it cheaper --
112.544	and let's say,
115.447	let's go for making it twice as cheap --
119.616	we need to meet a new constraint,
122.037	and that constraint has to do with CO2.
126.003	CO2 is warming the planet,
129.096	and the equation on CO2
129.096	is actually a very straightforward one.
134.26	If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,
138.866	that leads to a temperature increase,
141.26	and that temperature increase
141.26	leads to some very negative effects:
145.26	the effects on the weather;
145.26	perhaps worse, the indirect effects,
149.197	in that the natural ecosystems
149.197	can't adjust to these rapid changes,
153.914	and so you get ecosystem collapses.
156.66	Now, the exact amount of how you map
156.66	from a certain increase of CO2
162.079	to what temperature will be,
162.079	and where the positive feedbacks are --
165.393	there's some uncertainty there,
165.393	but not very much.
168.526	And there's certainly uncertainty
168.526	about how bad those effects will be,
171.85	but they will be extremely bad.
174.461	I asked the top scientists
174.461	on this several times:
176.787	Do we really have to get
176.787	down to near zero?
179.335	Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?
182.392	And the answer is,
182.392	until we get near to zero,
186.26	the temperature will continue to rise.
188.718	And so that's a big challenge.
190.512	It's very different than saying,
192.762	"""We're a twelve-foot-high truck"
192.762	trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,
196.122	"and we can just sort of squeeze under."""
198.869	This is something that has to get to zero.
202.828	Now, we put out a lot
202.828	of carbon dioxide every year --
206.121	over 26 billion tons.
208.842	For each American, it's about 20 tons.
212.438	For people in poor countries,
212.438	it's less than one ton.
215.26	It's an average of about five tons
215.26	for everyone on the planet.
219.402	And somehow, we have to make changes
219.402	that will bring that down to zero.
224.877	It's been constantly going up.
227.045	It's only various economic changes
227.045	that have even flattened it at all,
231.674	so we have to go
231.674	from rapidly rising to falling,
235.155	and falling all the way to zero.
237.261	This equation has four factors,
237.261	a little bit of multiplication.
241.26	So you've got a thing on the left,
241.26	CO2, that you want to get to zero,
245.048	and that's going to be based
245.048	on the number of people,
248.462	the services each person
248.462	is using on average,
251.876	the energy, on average, for each service,
254.769	and the CO2 being put out
254.769	per unit of energy.
258.992	So let's look at each one of these,
260.969	and see how we can get this down to zero.
264.498	Probably, one of these numbers is going
264.498	to have to get pretty near to zero.
268.074	(Laughter)
269.28	That's back from high school algebra.
271.278	But let's take a look.
272.958	First, we've got population.
275.454	The world today has 6.8 billion people.
278.26	That's headed up to about nine billion.
280.487	Now, if we do a really great job
280.487	on new vaccines,
284.572	health care, reproductive health services,
287.053	we could lower that by,
287.053	perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.
290.178	But there, we see
290.178	an increase of about 1.3.
294.685	The second factor is the services we use.
297.715	This encompasses everything:
299.504	the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
304.037	These are very good things.
306.189	Getting rid of poverty means
306.189	providing these services
309.92	to almost everyone on the planet.
311.949	And it's a great thing
311.949	for this number to go up.
315.26	In the rich world, perhaps
315.26	the top one billion,
317.523	we probably could cut back and use less,
319.932	but every year, this number,
319.932	on average, is going to go up,
324.072	and so, overall,
324.072	that will more than double
327.26	the services delivered per person.
330.398	Here we have a very basic service:
332.525	Do you have lighting in your house
332.525	to be able to read your homework?
335.961	And, in fact, these kids don't,
337.504	so they're going out and reading
337.504	their schoolwork
339.846	under the street lamps.
342.538	"Now, efficiency, ""E,"""
342.538	the energy for each service --
346.26	here, finally we have some good news.
348.261	We have something that's not going up.
350.147	Through various inventions
350.147	and new ways of doing lighting,
353.26	through different types of cars,
353.26	different ways of building buildings --
358.715	there are a lot of services
360.374	where you can bring the energy
360.374	for that service down
363.738	quite substantially.
365.26	Some individual services
365.26	even bring it down by 90 percent.
368.779	There are other services,
368.779	like how we make fertilizer,
372.149	or how we do air transport,
373.815	where the rooms for improvement
373.815	are far, far less.
377.156	And so overall, if we're optimistic,
377.156	we may get a reduction
381.478	of a factor of three to even,
381.478	perhaps, a factor of six.
386.868	But for these first three factors now,
389.26	we've gone from 26 billion
389.26	to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,
394.344	and that just won't cut it.
396.259	So let's look at this fourth factor --
396.259	this is going to be a key one --
400.081	and this is the amount of CO2
400.081	put out per each unit of energy.
406.434	So the question is:
406.434	Can you actually get that to zero?
409.983	If you burn coal, no.
412.913	If you burn natural gas, no.
414.412	Almost every way
414.412	we make electricity today,
417.539	except for the emerging renewables
417.539	and nuclear, puts out CO2.
423.551	And so, what we're going to have
423.551	to do at a global scale,
426.828	is create a new system.
429.133	So we need energy miracles.
431.786	"Now, when I use the term ""miracle,"""
431.786	I don't mean something that's impossible.
436.103	The microprocessor is a miracle.
438.547	The personal computer is a miracle.
440.556	The Internet and its services
440.556	are a miracle.
443.047	So the people here have participated
443.047	in the creation of many miracles.
448.117	Usually, we don't have a deadline
450.118	where you have to get the miracle
450.118	by a certain date.
452.62	Usually, you just kind of stand by,
452.62	and some come along, some don't.
456.625	This is a case where we actually
456.625	have to drive at full speed
460.748	and get a miracle
460.748	in a pretty tight timeline.
465.749	"Now, I thought, ""How could"
465.749	I really capture this?
468.718	Is there some kind
468.718	of natural illustration,
470.965	some demonstration that would grab
470.965	"people's imagination here?"""
475.502	I thought back to a year ago
475.502	when I brought mosquitoes,
479.26	and somehow people enjoyed that.
481.914	(Laughter)
483.545	It really got them involved
483.545	in the idea of, you know,
487.615	there are people who live with mosquitoes.
489.691	With energy, all I could
489.691	come up with is this.
494.101	I decided that releasing fireflies
497.259	would be my contribution
497.259	to the environment here this year.
501.376	So here we have some natural fireflies.
504.26	I'm told they don't bite; in fact,
504.26	they might not even leave that jar.
507.893	(Laughter)
511.093	Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky
511.093	solutions like that one,
515.255	but they don't really add up to much.
517.18	We need solutions, either one or several,
521.227	that have unbelievable scale
521.227	and unbelievable reliability.
527.268	And although there's many directions
527.268	that people are seeking,
530.76	I really only see five
530.76	that can achieve the big numbers.
534.861	I've left out tide,
534.861	geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
539.172	Those may make some contribution,
541.173	and if they can do better
541.173	than I expect, so much the better.
544.046	But my key point here
544.046	is that we're going to have to work on
547.992	each of these five,
549.742	and we can't give up any of them
549.742	because they look daunting,
553.563	because they all have
553.563	significant challenges.
557.061	Let's look first at burning fossil fuels,
559.705	either burning coal
559.705	or burning natural gas.
563.021	What you need to do there seems
563.021	like it might be simple, but it's not.
567.131	And that's to take all the CO2,
569.588	after you've burned it,
569.588	going out the flue,
572.26	pressurize it, create a liquid,
572.26	put it somewhere,
575.429	and hope it stays there.
577.452	Now, we have some pilot things
579.098	that do this at the 60 to 80
579.098	percent level.
581.461	But getting up to that full percentage --
581.461	that will be very tricky.
585.884	And agreeing on where these CO2
585.884	quantities should be put will be hard,
591.48	but the toughest one here
591.48	is this long-term issue:
594.166	Who's going to be sure?
595.73	Who's going to guarantee
597.352	something that is literally
597.352	billions of times larger
600.445	than any type of waste you think of
600.445	in terms of nuclear or other things?
604.615	This is a lot of volume.
607.694	So that's a tough one.
609.527	Next would be nuclear.
611.26	It also has three big problems:
614.26	cost, particularly in highly
614.26	regulated countries, is high;
618.26	the issue of safety, really feeling good
618.26	about nothing could go wrong,
622.938	that, even though you have
622.938	these human operators,
625.966	the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.
628.716	And then what do you do with the waste?
630.695	Although it's not very large,
630.695	there are a lot of concerns about that.
634.123	People need to feel good about it.
635.812	So three very tough problems
635.812	that might be solvable,
640.26	and so, should be worked on.
642.449	The last three of the five,
642.449	I've grouped together.
645.164	These are what people often refer to
645.164	as the renewable sources.
649.101	And they actually -- although it's great
649.101	they don't require fuel --
653.148	they have some disadvantages.
655.577	One is that the density of energy
655.577	gathered in these technologies
661.443	is dramatically less than a power plant.
663.53	This is energy farming,
665.236	so you're talking about many square miles,
665.236	thousands of times more area
669.381	than you think of
669.381	as a normal energy plant.
672.758	Also, these are intermittent sources.
675.37	The sun doesn't shine all day,
675.37	it doesn't shine every day,
678.809	and likewise, the wind
678.809	doesn't blow all the time.
681.26	And so, if you depend on these sources,
683.673	you have to have some way
683.673	of getting the energy
686.047	during those time periods
686.047	that it's not available.
689.418	So we've got big cost challenges here.
692.498	We have transmission challenges;
694.42	for example, say this energy source
694.42	is outside your country,
698.008	you not only need the technology,
700.125	but you have to deal with the risk
700.125	of the energy coming from elsewhere.
704.522	And, finally, this storage problem.
707.06	To dimensionalize this,
708.585	I went through and looked
708.585	at all the types of batteries made --
712.162	for cars, for computers, for phones,
712.162	for flashlights, for everything --
716.698	and compared that to the amount
716.698	of electrical energy the world uses.
721.644	What I found is that all
721.644	the batteries we make now
725.261	could store less than 10 minutes
725.261	of all the energy.
729.26	And so, in fact, we need
729.26	a big breakthrough here,
732.652	something that's going to be
732.652	a factor of 100 better
736.544	than the approaches we have now.
738.401	It's not impossible,
738.401	but it's not a very easy thing.
742.594	Now, this shows up when you try
742.594	to get the intermittent source
746.26	to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent
746.26	of what you're using.
750.436	If you're counting on it for 100 percent,
753.054	you need an incredible miracle battery.
758.26	Now, how are we going to go forward
758.26	on this -- what's the right approach?
761.901	Is it a Manhattan Project?
761.901	What's the thing that can get us there?
765.504	Well, we need lots of companies
765.504	working on this -- hundreds.
770.339	In each of these five paths,
770.339	we need at least a hundred people.
773.942	A lot of them, you'll look at
773.942	"and say, ""They're crazy."""
776.676	That's good.
777.881	And, I think, here in the TED group,
780.835	we have many people
780.835	who are already pursuing this.
784.816	Bill Gross has several companies,
784.816	including one called eSolar
788.26	that has some great
788.26	solar thermal technologies.
791.066	Vinod Khosla is investing
791.066	in dozens of companies
794.54	that are doing great things
794.54	and have interesting possibilities,
798.491	and I'm trying to help back that.
800.664	Nathan Myhrvold and I
800.664	actually are backing a company
804.26	that, perhaps surprisingly,
804.26	is actually taking the nuclear approach.
808.056	There are some innovations
808.056	in nuclear: modular, liquid.
812.658	Innovation really stopped
812.658	in this industry quite some ago,
816.455	so the idea that there's some
816.455	good ideas laying around
819.574	is not all that surprising.
821.789	The idea of TerraPower is that,
821.789	instead of burning a part of uranium --
827.603	the one percent, which is the U235 --
830.746	"we decided, ""Let's burn"
830.746	"the 99 percent, the U238."""
834.998	It is kind of a crazy idea.
837.375	In fact, people had talked
837.375	about it for a long time,
840.542	but they could never simulate properly
840.542	whether it would work or not,
844.727	and so it's through the advent
844.727	of modern supercomputers
847.616	that now you can simulate
847.616	and see that, yes,
849.771	with the right materials approach,
849.771	this looks like it would work.
855.453	And because you're burning
855.453	that 99 percent,
858.26	you have greatly improved cost profile.
862.667	You actually burn up the waste,
862.667	and you can actually use as fuel
866.901	all the leftover waste
866.901	from today's reactors.
869.95	So instead of worrying about them,
869.95	you just take that, it's a great thing.
874.088	It breeds this uranium as it goes along,
874.088	so it's kind of like a candle.
878.607	You see it's a log there, often
878.607	referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
882.76	In terms of fuel,
882.76	this really solves the problem.
886.703	I've got a picture here
886.703	of a place in Kentucky.
889.628	This is the leftover, the 99 percent,
891.852	where they've taken out
891.852	the part they burn now,
894.106	so it's called depleted uranium.
895.7	That would power the US
895.7	for hundreds of years.
898.571	And simply by filtering seawater
898.571	in an inexpensive process,
902.13	you'd have enough fuel for the entire
902.13	lifetime of the rest of the planet.
906.314	So, you know, it's got lots
906.314	of challenges ahead,
910.399	but it is an example of the many
910.399	hundreds and hundreds of ideas
915.818	that we need to move forward.
918.667	So let's think: How should
918.667	we measure ourselves?
921.389	What should our report card look like?
924.616	Well, let's go out to where
924.616	we really need to get,
927.164	and then look at the intermediate.
929.331	For 2050, you've heard many people
929.331	talk about this 80 percent reduction.
935.102	That really is very important,
935.102	that we get there.
938.178	And that 20 percent will be used up
938.178	by things going on in poor countries --
942.623	still some agriculture; hopefully,
942.623	we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.
948.041	So, to get to that 80 percent,
951.054	the developed countries,
951.054	including countries like China,
955.583	will have had to switch
955.583	their electricity generation altogether.
960.385	The other grade is: Are we deploying
960.385	this zero-emission technology,
966.26	have we deployed it
966.26	in all the developed countries
968.681	and are in the process
968.681	of getting it elsewhere?
971.492	That's super important.
973.26	That's a key element
973.26	of making that report card.
977.26	Backing up from there, what should
977.26	the 2020 report card look like?
982.015	Well, again, it should have
982.015	the two elements.
984.357	We should go through these efficiency
984.357	measures to start getting reductions:
988.52	The less we emit,
988.52	the less that sum will be of CO2,
991.808	and therefore, the less the temperature.
993.904	But in some ways, the grade we get there,
996.857	doing things that don't get us
996.857	all the way to the big reductions,
1001.125	is only equally, or maybe even slightly
1001.125	less, important than the other,
1004.993	which is the piece of innovation
1004.993	on these breakthroughs.
1008.773	These breakthroughs,
1008.773	we need to move those at full speed,
1012.035	and we can measure that
1012.035	in terms of companies,
1014.484	pilot projects, regulatory things
1014.484	that have been changed.
1017.858	There's a lot of great books
1017.858	that have been written about this.
1020.856	"The Al Gore book, ""Our Choice,"""
1023.26	and the David MacKay book,
1023.26	"""Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."""
1026.864	They really go through it
1026.864	and create a framework
1030.064	that this can be discussed broadly,
1031.921	because we need broad backing for this.
1034.246	There's a lot that has to come together.
1036.497	So this is a wish.
1038.003	It's a very concrete wish
1038.003	that we invent this technology.
1042.632	If you gave me only one wish
1042.632	for the next 50 years --
1045.745	I could pick who's president,
1047.746	I could pick a vaccine,
1047.746	which is something I love,
1050.532	or I could pick that this thing
1052.613	that's half the cost with no CO2
1052.613	gets invented --
1056.098	this is the wish I would pick.
1058.029	This is the one with the greatest impact.
1060.138	If we don't get this wish,
1061.807	the division between the people
1061.807	who think short term and long term
1065.269	will be terrible,
1066.451	between the US and China,
1066.451	between poor countries and rich,
1069.419	and most of all,
1070.637	the lives of those two billion
1070.637	will be far worse.
1074.418	So what do we have to do?
1076.26	What am I appealing to you
1076.26	to step forward and drive?
1081.449	We need to go for more research funding.
1084.45	When countries get together
1084.45	in places like Copenhagen,
1087.099	they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.
1089.542	They should discuss
1089.542	this innovation agenda.
1091.933	You'd be stunned at the ridiculously
1091.933	low levels of spending
1096.26	on these innovative approaches.
1098.443	We do need the market incentives --
1098.443	CO2 tax, cap and trade --
1102.26	something that gets
1102.26	that price signal out there.
1105.141	We need to get the message out.
1106.763	We need to have this dialogue
1106.763	be a more rational,
1109.191	more understandable dialogue,
1110.805	including the steps
1110.805	that the government takes.
1113.36	This is an important wish,
1113.36	but it is one I think we can achieve.
1117.676	Thank you.
1118.853	(Applause)
1128.235	(Applause ends)
1130.26	Thank you.
1132.563	Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
1134.432	(Applause)
1139.517	CA: Thank you.
1141.039	So to understand more about TerraPower.
1145.659	I mean, first of all, can you give a sense
1145.659	of what scale of investment this is?
1150.158	Bill Gates: To actually do the software,
1150.158	buy the supercomputer,
1154.516	hire all the great scientists,
1154.516	which we've done,
1156.869	that's only tens of millions.
1159.15	And even once we test our materials out
1159.15	in a Russian reactor
1163.122	to make sure our materials work properly,
1166.321	then you'll only be up
1166.321	in the hundreds of millions.
1168.862	The tough thing
1168.862	is building the pilot reactor --
1171.244	finding the several billion,
1171.244	finding the regulator, the location
1176.072	that will actually build
1176.072	the first one of these.
1178.355	Once you get the first one built,
1178.355	if it works as advertised,
1182.541	then it's just clear as day,
1183.915	because the economics,
1183.915	the energy density, are so different
1187.135	than nuclear as we know it.
1188.573	CA: So to understand it right,
1190.059	this involves building
1190.059	deep into the ground,
1192.365	almost like a vertical column
1192.365	of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,
1197.949	and then the process starts
1197.949	at the top and kind of works down?
1201.113	BG: That's right.
1202.314	Today, you're always
1202.314	refueling the reactor,
1204.397	so you have lots of people and lots
1204.397	of controls that can go wrong,
1207.613	where you're opening it up
1207.613	and moving things in and out --
1210.376	that's not good.
1212.557	So if you have very --
1213.754	(Laughter)
1214.867	very cheap fuel
1214.867	that you can put 60 years in --
1217.638	just think of it as a log --
1219.216	put it down and not have
1219.216	those same complexities.
1222.778	And it just sits there and burns
1222.778	for the 60 years, and then it's done.
1227.707	CA: It's a nuclear power plant
1227.707	that is its own waste disposal solution.
1231.669	BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,
1233.587	you can let it sit there -- there's a lot
1233.587	less waste under this approach --
1238.991	then you can actually take that
1240.651	and put it into another one and burn that.
1243.26	And we start out, actually,
1243.26	by taking the waste that exists today
1247.49	that's sitting in these cooling pools
1247.49	or dry-casking by reactors --
1251.746	that's our fuel to begin with.
1253.922	So the thing that's been a problem
1253.922	from those reactors
1256.553	is actually what gets fed into ours,
1258.504	and you're reducing the volume
1258.504	of the waste quite dramatically
1261.515	as you're going through this process.
1263.516	CA: You're talking
1263.516	to different people around the world
1266.115	about the possibilities.
1267.428	Where is there most interest
1267.428	in actually doing something with this?
1270.86	BG: Well, we haven't picked
1270.86	a particular place,
1275.039	and there's all these interesting
1275.039	disclosure rules
1278.523	"about anything that's called ""nuclear."""
1281.023	So we've got a lot of interest.
1283.976	People from the company
1283.976	have been in Russia, India, China.
1287.075	I've been back seeing
1287.075	the secretary of energy here,
1289.713	talking about how this fits
1289.713	into the energy agenda.
1293.069	So I'm optimistic.
1294.669	The French and Japanese
1294.669	have done some work.
1296.87	This is a variant on something
1296.87	that has been done.
1300.554	It's an important advance,
1300.554	but it's like a fast reactor,
1304.26	and a lot of countries have built them,
1306.26	so anybody who's done
1306.26	a fast reactor is a candidate
1308.858	to be where the first one gets built.
1311.26	CA: So, in your mind,
1314.726	timescale and likelihood of actually
1314.726	taking something like this live?
1319.508	BG: Well, we need -- for one of these
1319.508	high-scale, electro-generation things
1325.619	that's very cheap,
1326.801	we have 20 years to invent
1326.801	and then 20 years to deploy.
1330.503	That's sort of the deadline
1332.283	that the environmental models
1332.283	have shown us that we have to meet.
1337.565	And TerraPower -- if things go well,
1337.565	which is wishing for a lot --
1343.001	could easily meet that.
1344.668	And there are, fortunately
1344.668	now, dozens of companies --
1347.964	we need it to be hundreds --
1349.339	who, likewise, if their science goes well,
1351.58	if the funding for their pilot
1351.58	plants goes well,
1354.499	that they can compete for this.
1356.549	And it's best if multiple succeed,
1358.547	because then you could use
1358.547	a mix of these things.
1361.26	We certainly need one to succeed.
1363.365	CA: In terms of big-scale
1363.365	possible game changers,
1366.348	is this the biggest
1366.348	that you're aware of out there?
1369.106	BG: An energy breakthrough
1369.106	is the most important thing.
1373.479	It would have been, even
1373.479	without the environmental constraint,
1376.486	but the environmental constraint
1376.486	just makes it so much greater.
1380.373	In the nuclear space,
1380.373	there are other innovators.
1383.721	You know, we don't know their work
1383.721	as well as we know this one,
1386.735	but the modular people,
1386.735	that's a different approach.
1390.016	There's a liquid-type reactor,
1390.016	which seems a little hard,
1393.645	but maybe they say that about us.
1395.905	And so, there are different ones,
1398.26	but the beauty of this
1398.26	is a molecule of uranium
1401.26	has a million times as much energy
1401.26	as a molecule of, say, coal.
1405.962	And so, if you can
1405.962	deal with the negatives,
1409.002	which are essentially the radiation,
1409.002	the footprint and cost,
1412.878	the potential, in terms of effect
1412.878	on land and various things,
1416.893	is almost in a class of its own.
1421.299	CA: If this doesn't work, then what?
1424.962	Do we have to start taking
1424.962	emergency measures
1428.26	to try and keep the temperature
1428.26	of the earth stable?
1431.382	BG: If you get into that situation,
1433.26	it's like if you've been overeating,
1433.26	and you're about to have a heart attack.
1438.26	Then where do you go?
1440.809	You may need heart surgery or something.
1442.766	There is a line of research
1442.766	on what's called geoengineering,
1446.66	which are various techniques
1446.66	that would delay the heating
1449.661	to buy us 20 or 30 years
1449.661	to get our act together.
1452.971	Now, that's just an insurance policy;
1452.971	you hope you don't need to do that.
1456.603	Some people say you shouldn't even
1456.603	work on the insurance policy
1459.669	because it might make you lazy,
1461.214	that you'll keep eating because you know
1461.214	heart surgery will be there to save you.
1465.104	I'm not sure that's wise,
1465.104	given the importance of the problem,
1468.245	but there's now
1468.245	the geoengineering discussion
1471.37	about: Should that be in the back
1471.37	pocket in case things happen faster,
1475.601	or this innovation goes
1475.601	a lot slower than we expect?
1480.809	CA: Climate skeptics:
1482.634	If you had a sentence or two
1482.634	to say to them,
1486.164	how might you persuade them
1486.164	that they're wrong?
1490.905	BG: Well, unfortunately,
1490.905	the skeptics come in different camps.
1493.98	The ones who make scientific
1493.98	arguments are very few.
1498.445	Are they saying there's negative
1498.445	feedback effects
1501.458	that have to do with clouds
1501.458	that offset things?
1503.684	There are very, very few things
1503.684	that they can even say
1507.016	there's a chance
1507.016	in a million of those things.
1509.687	The main problem we have here --
1509.687	it's kind of like with AIDS:
1512.915	you make the mistake now,
1512.915	and you pay for it a lot later.
1516.742	And so, when you have
1516.742	all sorts of urgent problems,
1520.021	the idea of taking pain now
1520.021	that has to do with a gain later,
1524.106	and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.
1526.416	In fact, the IPCC report --
1526.416	that's not necessarily the worst case,
1532.528	and there are people in the rich world
1532.528	who look at IPCC and say,
1536.627	"""OK, that isn't that big of a deal."""
1538.435	The fact is it's that uncertain part
1538.435	that should move us towards this.
1542.608	But my dream here is that,
1544.264	if you can make it economic,
1544.264	and meet the CO2 constraints,
1547.948	then the skeptics say,
1549.131	"""OK, I don't care"
1549.131	that it doesn't put out CO2,
1551.435	I kind of wish it did put out CO2.
1553.139	But I guess I'll accept it,
1554.519	because it's cheaper
1554.519	"than what's come before."""
1557.26	(Applause)
1562.115	CA: So that would be your response
1562.115	to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,
1565.319	basically if you spend all this energy
1565.319	trying to solve the CO2 problem,
1569.799	it's going to take away
1569.799	all your other goals
1571.917	of trying to rid the world
1571.917	of poverty and malaria and so forth,
1574.934	it's a stupid waste
1574.934	of the Earth's resources
1577.191	to put money towards that
1578.488	when there are better things we can do.
1580.43	BG: Well, the actual
1580.43	spending on the R&amp;D piece --
1583.845	say the US should spend 10 billion a year
1583.845	more than it is right now --
1587.365	it's not that dramatic.
1589.26	It shouldn't take away from other things.
1591.26	The thing you get into big money on,
1591.26	and reasonable people can disagree,
1594.704	is when you have something
1594.704	that's non-economic
1596.894	and you're trying to fund that --
1598.537	that, to me, mostly is a waste.
1600.489	Unless you're very close,
1602.06	and you're just funding the learning curve
1602.06	and it's going to get very cheap,
1605.728	I believe we should try more things
1608.55	that have a potential
1608.55	to be far less expensive.
1611.26	If the trade-off you get into is,
1611.26	"""Let's make energy super expensive,"""
1616.476	then the rich can afford that.
1618.522	I mean, all of us here could pay
1618.522	five times as much for our energy
1621.675	and not change our lifestyle.
1623.09	The disaster is for that two billion.
1625.378	And even Lomborg has changed.
1627.709	"His shtick now is, ""Why isn't the R&amp;D"
1627.709	"getting more discussed?"""
1632.26	He's still, because of his earlier stuff,
1634.797	still associated with the skeptic camp,
1636.721	but he's realized
1636.721	that's a pretty lonely camp,
1639.518	and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.
1642.8	And so there is a thread of something
1642.8	that I think is appropriate.
1647.26	The R&amp;D piece --
1647.26	it's crazy how little it's funded.
1650.816	CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak
1650.816	on behalf of most people here
1654.127	to say I really hope your wish comes true.
1656.219	Thank you so much.
1657.415	BG: Thank you.
1658.59	(Applause)
