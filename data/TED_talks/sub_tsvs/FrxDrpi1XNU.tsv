12.811	The 2011 Arab Spring
14.776	captured the attention of the world.
16.579	It also captured the attention
18.228	of authoritarian governments in other countries,
20.605	who were worried that revolution would spread.
23.568	To respond, they ramped up surveillance
25.645	of activists, journalists and dissidents
28.741	who they feared would inspire revolution
30.695	in their own countries.
32.53	One prominent Bahraini activist,
34.575	who was arrested and tortured by his government,
36.685	has said that the interrogators showed him
38.41	transcripts of his telephone calls
40.28	and text messages.
42.088	Of course, it's no secret
43.744	that governments are able to intercept
43.744	telephone calls and text messages.
46.94	It's for that reason that many activists
49.312	specifically avoid using the telephone.
51.238	Instead, they use tools like Skype,
53.586	which they think are immune to interception.
56.106	They're wrong.
57.878	There have now been over the last few years
60.604	an industry of companies
62.25	who provide surveillance technology to governments,
65.504	specifically technology that
65.504	allows those governments
67.865	to hack into the computers
69.518	of surveillance targets.
71.113	Rather than intercepting the communications 
71.113	as they go over the wire,
73.953	instead they now hack into your computer,
76.22	enable your webcam, enable your microphone,
78.222	and steal documents from your computer.
80.679	When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,
83.512	activists raided the office of the secret police,
86.913	and among the many documents they found
88.901	was this document by the Gamma Corporation,
91.218	by Gamma International.
93.019	Gamma is a German company
94.676	that manufactures surveillance software
96.16	and sells it only to governments.
98.317	It's important to note that most governments
100.324	don't really have the in-house capabilities
102.39	to develop this software.
103.855	Smaller ones don't have the resources
105.474	or the expertise,
107.25	and so there's this market of Western companies
110.557	who are happy to supply them with the tools
112.524	and techniques for a price.
114.242	Gamma is just one of these companies.
116.848	I should note also that Gamma never actually sold
119.756	their software to the Egyptian government.
121.653	They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,
124.25	but the Egyptians never bought it.
125.892	Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government
127.616	used a free demo version of Gamma's software.
130.249	(Laughter)
133.024	So this screenshot is from a sales video
136.522	that Gamma produced.
138.087	Really, they're just emphasizing
140.07	in a relatively slick presentation
141.721	the fact that the police can sort of sit
143.914	in an air-conditioned office
145.364	and remotely monitor someone
146.775	without them having any idea that it's going on.
148.95	You know, your webcam light won't turn on.
150.985	There's nothing to indicate that
150.985	the microphone is enabled.
154.339	This is the managing director
154.339	of Gamma International.
157.674	His name is Martin Muench.
159.535	There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.
162.466	This is perhaps my favorite.
164.318	I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.
166.462	You can see there's a little sticker
168.13	that's placed over his camera.
170.023	He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,
172.556	and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used
174.362	against him.
175.964	Muench has said that he intends
177.888	for his software to be used
179.552	to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.
182.535	Of course, he's also acknowledged that once
184.331	the software has been sold to governments,
186.486	he has no way of knowing how it can be used.
190.311	Gamma's software has been located on servers
192.161	in countries around the world,
193.817	many with really atrocious track records
196.208	and human rights violations.
197.769	They really are selling their
197.769	software around the world.
201.164	Gamma is not the only company in the business.
203.465	As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.
206.216	One of the other big guys in the industry
209.055	is an Italian company called Hacking Team.
211.45	Now, Hacking Team has what is probably
213.175	the slickest presentation.
215.145	The video they've produced is very sexy,
218.173	and so I'm going to play you a clip
219.821	just so you can get a feel
221.135	both for the capabilities of the software
222.966	but also how it's marketed
224.872	to their government clients.
226.64	(Video) Narrator: You want to look 
226.64	through your target's eyes.
230.179	(Music)
232.063	You have to hack your target.
235.065	"[""While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders""]"
241.381	You have to hit many different platforms.
244.304	"[""Windows, OS X, iOS, Android,"
244.304	"Blackberry, Symbian, Linux""]"
248.184	You have to overcome encryption
250.652	and capture relevant data.
253.549	[Skype &amp; encrypted calls, target location, 
253.549	messaging, relationships,
258.108	"web browsing, audio &amp; video""]"
261.28	Being stealth and untraceable.
265.44	"[""Immune to any protection system"
265.44	"Hidden collection infrastructure""]"
268.714	Deployed all over your country.
272.819	"[""Up to hundreds of thousands of targets"
272.819	"Managed from a single spot""]"
277.353	Exactly what we do.
280.675	Christopher Soghoian: So, it
280.675	would be funny if it wasn't true,
282.938	but, in fact, Hacking Team's software
284.726	is being sold to governments around the world.
287.674	Last year we learned, for example,
289.426	that it's been used to target Moroccan 
289.426	journalists by the Moroccan government.
293.474	Many, many countries it's been found in.
296.018	So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting
299.142	the U.S. law enforcement market.
301.485	In the last year or so, the company
303.768	has opened a sales office in Maryland.
308.544	The company has also hired a spokesperson.
310.658	They've been attending
312.195	surveillance industry conferences
313.792	where law enforcement officials show up.
315.807	They've spoken at the conferences.
317.641	What I thought was most fascinating was
319.229	they've actually paid for the coffee break
321.33	at one of the law enforcement conferences
323.27	earlier this year.
324.763	I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team
326.862	has sold their technology in the United States,
329.587	but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,
331.558	it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.
334.733	So as I said before,
336.775	governments that don't really have the resources
338.695	to build their own tools will buy
340.291	off-the-shelf surveillance software,
341.701	and so for that reason,
343.089	you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,
345.805	might use the same software
345.805	as the government of Germany.
347.993	They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.
350.265	The Federal Bureau of
350.265	Investigation in the United States
352.464	does have the budget to build
352.464	their own surveillance technology,
355.226	and so for several years, I've been trying
357.007	to figure out if and how the FBI
359.398	is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.
362.296	My friends at an organization called
362.296	the Electronic Frontier Foundation --
365.449	they're a civil society group â€”
367.761	obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI
370.253	detailing their next generation
370.253	of surveillance technologies.
373.101	Most of these documents were heavily redacted,
375.735	but what you can see from the slides,
378.551	if I zoom in, is this term:
380.513	Remote Operations Unit.
382.333	Now, when I first looked into this,
384.567	I'd never heard of this unit before.
386.637	I've been studying surveillance
386.637	for more than six years.
388.939	I'd never heard of it.
390.224	And so I went online and I did some research,
392.187	and ultimately I hit the mother lode
394.312	when I went to LinkedIn,
395.946	the social networking site for job seekers.
398.515	There were lots of former
398.515	U.S. government contractors
401.428	who had at one point worked
402.815	for the Remote Operating Unit,
404.124	and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs
407.538	what they had done in their former job.
409.569	(Laughter)
411.791	So I took this information
413.778	and I gave it to a journalist that I know
413.778	and trust at the Wall Street Journal,
417.522	and she was able to contact several other
419.323	former law enforcement officials
421.077	who spoke on background and confirmed
422.883	that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team
426.242	that does nothing but hack into the computers
428.378	of surveillance targets.
429.904	Like Gamma and Hacking Team,
431.792	the FBI also has the capability
433.909	to remotely activate webcams, microphones,
437.303	steal documents, get web browsing information,
439.505	the works.
441.189	There's sort of a big problem
443.011	with governments going into hacking,
444.611	and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,
447.13	drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists
450.041	all use the same kinds of computers.
452.312	There's no drug dealer phone
454.359	and there's no journalist laptop.
456.325	We all use the same technology,
458.559	and what that means then is that for governments
460.453	to have the capability to hack into the computers
462.57	of the real bad guys,
464.269	they also have to have the capability
466.245	to hack into our devices too.
468.43	So governments around the world
470.182	have been embracing this technology.
471.643	They've been embracing hacking
473.248	as a law enforcement technique,
475.068	but without any real debate.
477.018	In the United States, where I live,
478.837	there have been no congressional hearings.
480.662	There's no law that's been passed
482.623	specifically authorizing this technique,
484.696	and because of its power and potential for abuse,
487.365	it's vital that we have an informed public debate.
490.312	Thank you very much.
492.258	(Applause)
