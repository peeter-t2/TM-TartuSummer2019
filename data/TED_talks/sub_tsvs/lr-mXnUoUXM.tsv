12.639	Well, good afternoon.
14.378	How many of you
16.393	took the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?
19.16	(Applause)
20.69	Woo hoo!
22.95	Well, I have to tell you, from 
22.95	the bottom of our hearts,
26.038	thank you so very, very much.
28.818	Do you know to date the ALS Association
31.469	has raised 125 million dollars?
36.787	Woo hoo! (Applause)
43.239	It takes me back to the summer of 2011.
46.513	My family, my kids had all grown up.
48.602	We were officially empty nesters,
50.228	and we decided, let's 
50.228	go on a family vacation.
53.199	Jenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law
55.306	came down from New York.
56.88	My youngest, Andrew,
58.342	he came down from his home in Charlestown
60.897	where he was working in Boston,
62.675	and my son Pete,
63.916	who had played at 
63.916	Boston College, baseball,
66.858	had played baseball 
66.858	professionally in Europe,
69.682	and had now come home and was selling
69.682	group insurance, he also joined us.
74.559	And one night, I found myself
75.981	having a beer with Pete,
77.602	and Pete was looking at 
77.602	me and he just said,
80.27	"""You know, Mom, I don't know,"
82.46	selling group insurance 
82.46	"is just not my passion."""
86.459	"He said, ""I just don't feel "
86.459	I'm living up to my potential.
92.087	"I don't feel this is my mission in life."""
95.266	"And he said, ""You know, "
95.266	oh by the way, Mom,
98.707	I have to leave early from vacation
101.512	because my inter-city league team 
101.512	that I play for made the playoffs,
105.956	and I have to get back to Boston 
105.956	because I can't let my team down.
110.665	I'm just not as passionate about my job
113.88	"as I am about baseball."""
116.146	So off Pete went, and 
116.146	left the family vacation —
119.269	break a mother's heart —
120.985	and he went, and we 
120.985	followed four days later
125.297	to see the next playoff game.
127.943	We're at the playoff game, 
127.943	Pete's at the plate,
130.573	and a fastball's coming in,
132.974	and it hits him on the wrist.
135.29	Oh, Pete.
137.54	His wrist went completely limp, like this.
140.274	So for the next six months,
141.79	Pete went back to his home in Southie,
144.47	kept working that unpassionate job,
147.417	and was going to doctors
148.813	to see what was wrong with this wrist
150.686	that never came back.
152.556	Six months later, in March,
154.522	he called my husband 
154.522	and me, and he said,
156.485	"""Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor"
158.487	that found a diagnosis for that wrist.
161.491	Do you want to come with the
161.491	"doctor's appointment with me?"""
164.647	"I said, ""Sure, we'll come in."""
166.62	That morning, Pete, John and I
169.736	all got up, got dressed, got in our cars —
172.234	three separate cars
173.571	because we were going to go to work
175.338	after the doctor's appointment to
175.338	find out what happened to the wrist.
178.547	We walked into the 
178.547	neurologist's office, sat down,
181.109	four doctors walk in,
182.976	and the head neurologist sits down.
185.02	"And he says, ""Well, Pete, we've"
185.02	been looking at all the tests,
188.06	and I have to tell you, 
188.06	it's not a sprained wrist,
191.473	it's not a broken wrist,
193.854	it's not nerve damage in the wrist,
195.9	it's not an infection,
197.712	"it's not Lyme disease."""
201.48	And there was this deliberate 
201.48	elimination going up,
205.14	and I was thinking to myself,
206.723	where is he going with this?
210.04	Then he put his hands on his knees,
212.21	he looked right at my 
215.361	"""I don't know how to "
215.361	tell a 27-year-old this:
218.577	"Pete, you have ALS."""
222.472	ALS?
224.654	I had had a friend whose 
229.379	I looked at my husband, he looked at me,
231.44	and then we looked at the 
231.44	"doctor, and we said, ""ALS?"
233.982	Okay, what treatment? Let's go.
236.218	"What do we do? Let's go."""
239.523	And he looked at us, and he
239.523	"said, ""Mr. and Mrs. Frates,"
242.407	I'm sorry to tell you this,
244.356	but there's no treatment 
244.356	"and there's no cure."""
248.884	We were the worst culprits.
251.729	We didn't even understand
254.264	that it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig
256.313	and nothing had been done 
256.313	in the progress against ALS.
261.805	So we all went home, and Jenn and Dan
264.975	flew home from Wall Street,
267.166	Andrew came home from Charlestown,
269.787	and Pete went to B.C. to pick up
272.217	his then-girlfriend Julie 
272.217	and brought her home,
275.436	and six hours later after diagnosis,
277.369	we're sitting around 
277.369	having a family dinner,
280.125	and we're having small chat.
282.46	I don't even remember 
282.46	cooking dinner that night.
285.279	But then our leader, Pete, set the vision,
291.646	and talked to us just like 
291.646	we were his new team.
294.802	"He said, ""There will be "
294.802	"no wallowing, people."""
298.493	"He goes, ""We're not looking back,"
300.814	we're looking forward.
302.869	What an amazing opportunity 
302.869	we have to change the world.
308.623	I'm going to change the face
310.958	of this unacceptable situation of ALS.
314.111	We're going to move the needle,
315.969	and I'm going to get it in front
315.969	"of philanthropists like Bill Gates."""
320.393	And that was it. We 
320.393	were given our directive.
323.899	So in the days and months that followed,
326.13	within a week, we had 
326.13	our brothers and sisters
329.417	and our family come to us,
331.568	that they were already 
331.568	creating Team Frate Train.
334.063	Uncle Dave, he was the webmaster;
336.971	Uncle Artie, he was the accountant;
339.318	Auntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;
342.097	and my youngest son, Andrew,
344.648	quit his job, left his 
344.648	apartment in Charlestown
347.635	"and says, ""I'm going to take care "
347.635	"of Pete and be his caregiver."""
351.601	Then all those people, 
351.601	classmates, teammates,
354.942	coworkers that Pete had inspired
357.449	throughout his whole life,
359.607	the circles of Pete all started
359.607	intersecting with one another,
363.715	and made Team Frate Train.
367.959	Six months after diagnosis,
370.06	Pete was given an award at a 
370.06	research summit for advocacy.
375.047	He got up and gave a very eloquent speech,
377.976	and at the end of the 
377.976	speech, there was a panel,
380.582	and on the panel were these
380.582	pharmaceutical executives
383.48	and biochemists and clinicians
385.89	and I'm sitting there and 
385.89	I'm listening to them
388.26	and most of the content 
388.26	went straight over my head.
391.482	I avoided every science 
391.482	class I ever could.
393.76	But I was watching these people,
393.76	and I was listening to them,
396.654	and they were saying, 
396.654	"""I, I do this, I do that,"""
399.388	and there was a real 
399.388	unfamiliarity between them.
403.319	So at the end of their talk, the panel,
406.632	they had questions and answers,
408.465	and boom, my hand went right up,
410.562	and I get the microphone,
411.867	"and I look at them and I say, ""Thank you."
413.871	Thank you so much for working in ALS.
416.27	"It means so very much to us."""
417.995	"I said, ""But I do have to tell you"
419.8	that I'm watching your body language
421.741	and I'm listening to what you're saying.
423.862	It just doesn't seem like there's a whole 
423.862	lot of collaboration going on here.
429.233	And not only that, where's the flip chart
432.375	with the action items and the 
432.375	follow-up and the accountability?
437.157	What are you going to do 
437.157	"after you leave this room?"""
441.149	And then I turned around
443.984	and there was about 200 pairs 
443.984	of eyes just staring at me.
450.75	And it was that point that I realized
454.31	that I had talked about 
454.31	the elephant in the room.
458.781	Thus my mission had begun.
461.892	So over the next couple of years,
464.862	Pete — we've had our highs and our lows.
467.5	Pete was put on a compassionate use drug.
469.938	It was hope in a bottle for 
469.938	the whole ALS community.
473.121	It was in a phase III trial.
475.33	Then six months later, the 
475.33	data comes back: no efficacy.
479.917	We were supposed to 
479.917	have therapies overseas,
482.388	and the rug was 
482.388	pulled out from under us.
484.537	So for the next two years,
486.482	we just watched my son 
486.482	be taken away from me,
490.764	little by little every day.
494.435	Two and a half years ago,
496.952	Pete was hitting home 
496.952	runs at baseball fields.
500.11	Today, Pete's completely paralyzed.
503.94	He can't hold his head up any longer.
506.306	He's confined to a motorized wheelchair.
508.92	He can no longer swallow or eat.
511.138	He has a feeding tube.
513.033	He can't speak.
517.239	He talks with eye gaze technology
520.775	and a speech generating device,
522.726	and we're watching his lungs,
524.195	because his diaphragm 
524.195	eventually is going to give out
527.2	and then the decision will be made
527.2	to put him on a ventilator or not.
531.978	ALS robs the human of all their physical 
531.978	parts, but the brain stays intact.
541.586	So July 4th, 2014,
	inspirational speech comes,
550.615	and Pete is asked by MLB.com to write
550.615	an article in the Bleacher Report.
556.159	And it was very significant, because he 
556.159	wrote it using his eye gaze technology.
563.252	Twenty days later, 
563.252	the ice started to fall.
569.501	On July 27th, Pete's 
569.501	roommate in New York City,
574.176	wearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,
576.785	signifying Pat Quinn, another 
576.785	ALS patient known in New York,
580.635	and B.C. shorts
582.686	"said, ""I'm taking the ALS "
582.686	"Ice Bucket Challenge,"""
587.178	picked up the ice, put it over his head.
589.958	"""And I'm nominating ..."" "
589.958	And he sent it up to Boston.
594.166	And that was on July 27th.
597.59	Over the next couple 
597.59	of days, our news feed
600.161	was full of family and friends.
602.696	If you haven't gone back,
602.696	the nice thing about Facebook
605.374	is that you have the dates, you can go back.
607.587	You've got to see Uncle Artie's 
607.587	human Bloody Mary.
611.558	I'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,
614.704	and that was probably in day two.
617.666	By about day four, Uncle 
617.666	Dave, the webmaster,
621.636	he isn't on Facebook,
623.609	and I get a text from him, 
623.609	"and it says, ""Nancy,"
626.496	"what the hell is going on?"""
629.39	Uncle Dave gets a hit 
629.39	every time Pete's website
632.987	is gone onto, and his 
632.987	phone was blowing up.
636.01	So we all sat down and we realized,
637.865	money is coming in — how amazing.
641.717	So we knew awareness 
641.717	would lead to funding,
644.261	we just didn't know it would
644.261	only take a couple of days.
647.239	So we got together, put our best 
652.396	and off we went.
654.505	So week one, Boston media.
657.686	Week two, national media.
660.154	It was during week two 
660.154	that our neighbor next door
662.608	opened up our door and threw a pizza
665	across the kitchen floor, saying,
667.36	"""I think you people might "
667.36	"need food in there."""
670.299	(Laughter)
672.504	Week three, celebrities — 
672.504	Entertainment Tonight,
676.52	Access Hollywood.
678.586	Week four, global — BBC, Irish Radio.
684.741	"Did anyone see ""Lost In Translation""?"
687.663	My husband did Japanese television.
689.852	It was interesting.
691.562	(Laughter)
693.614	And those videos, the popular ones.
699.376	Paul Bissonnette's 
699.376	glacier video, incredible.
703.864	How about the redemption nuns of Dublin?
706.601	Who's seen that one?
708.306	It's absolutely fantastic.
710.893	J.T., Justin Timberlake.
713.11	That's when we knew, that 
713.11	was a real A-list celebrity.
716.879	I go back on my texts, and I can see
719.77	"""JT! JT!"" My sister texting me."
724.902	Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.
728.15	Incredible.
729.956	And the ALS patients,
732.266	you know what their favorite
732.266	ones are, and their families'?
735.46	All of them.
737.05	Because this misunderstood and 
737.05	"underfunded ""rare"" disease,"
741.898	they just sat and watched people 
741.898	"saying it over and over: ""ALS, ALS."""
748.378	It was unbelievable.
751.587	And those naysayers,
753.63	let's just talk a couple 
753.63	of stats, shall we?
756.469	Okay, so the ALS Association,
759.107	they think by year end,
759.107	it'll be 160 million dollars.
763.064	ALS TDI in Cambridge,
765.649	they raised three million dollars.
767.701	Well, guess what?
769.143	They had a clinical trial for a drug
769.143	that they've been developing.
772.437	It was on a three-year track for funding.
775.553	Two months.
777.04	It's coming out starting in two months.
779.328	(Applause)
785.791	And YouTube has reported
790.806	that over 150 countries have posted
790.806	Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS.
797.884	And Facebook, 2.5 million videos,
804.455	and I had the awesome adventure
807.57	visiting the Facebook campus last week,
810.29	"and I said to them, ""I know"
810.29	what it was like in my house.
813.057	I can't imagine what it 
813.057	"was like around here."""
815.677	"All she said was, ""Jaw-dropping."""
820.39	And my family's favorite video?
825.37	Bill Gates.
828.576	Because the night Pete was diagnosed,
831.659	he told us that he was going to get ALS in
831.659	front of philanthropists like Bill Gates,
839.244	and he did it.
840.79	Goal number one, check.
843.26	Now on to the treatment and cure.
845.203	(Applause)
854.775	So okay, after all of this ice,
857.829	we know that it was much more
859.725	than just pouring buckets of 
859.725	ice water over your head,
862.547	and I really would like to leave you
864.375	with a couple of things that 
864.375	I'd like you to remember.
867.289	The first thing is,
868.964	every morning when you wake up,
871.19	you can choose to live your day in positivity.
876.249	Would any of you blame me
878.52	if I just was in the fetal position
880.859	and pulled the covers 
880.859	over my head every day?
884.096	No, I don't think anybody would blame me,
886.308	but Pete has inspired us to wake up
889.31	every morning and be 
889.31	positive and proactive.
892.496	I actually had to ditch support groups
895.3	because everybody was in there saying that
897.779	spraying their lawns with chemicals,
899.613	that's why they got ALS,
901.481	"and I was like, ""I don't think so,"""
903.44	but I had to get away from the negativity.
907.459	The second thing I want to leave you with
910.346	is the person at the 
910.346	middle of the challenge
913.16	has to be willing to have 
913.16	the mental toughness
916.24	to put themselves out there.
919.985	Pete still goes to baseball games
922.21	and he still sits with his 
922.21	teammates in the dugout,
925.264	and he hangs his gravity feed bag
928.147	right on the cages.
929.547	You'll see the kids, they're 
929.547	up there hanging it up.
931.317	"""Pete, is that okay?"" ""Yup."""
932.988	And then they put it 
932.988	right into his stomach.
936.239	Because he wants them to see
936.239	what the reality of this is,
939.641	and how he's never, ever going to give up.
943.013	And the third thing I 
943.013	want to leave you with:
945.243	If you ever come across a situation
948.759	that you see as so unacceptable,
951.898	I want you to dig down as deep as you can
955.621	and find your best mother bear
958.476	and go after it.
960.885	(Applause)
994.886	Thank you.
996.954	(Applause)
1000.771	I know that I'm running over,
1002.43	but I've got to leave you with this:
1004.197	the gifts that my son has given me.
1007.371	I have had 29 years
1010.084	of having the honor of being the mother
1013.9	of Pete Frates.
1015.939	Pete Frates has been inspiring 
1015.939	and leading his whole life.
1020.985	He's thrown out kindness,
1023.257	and all that kindness 
1023.257	has come back to him.
1026.897	He walks the face of the Earth 
1026.897	right now and knows why he's here.
1033.342	What a gift.
1036.19	The second thing that my son has given me
1038.821	is he's given me my mission in life.
1041.876	Now I know why I'm here.
1043.68	I'm going to save my son,
1046.824	and if it doesn't happen in time for him,
1049.614	I'm going to work so that no other mother
1052.256	has to go through what I'm going through.
1055.815	And the third thing, 
1055.815	and last but not least
1058.519	gift that my son has given me,
1061.546	as an exclamation point
1063.633	to the miraculous month
1065.426	of August 2014:
1069.104	That girlfriend that he went to get on 
1069.104	the night of diagnosis is now his wife,
1075.248	and Pete and Julie have given me my
