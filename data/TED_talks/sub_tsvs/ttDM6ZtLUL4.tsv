15.26	Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.
17.26	Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.
19.26	BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto
21.26	opened in 2004, people didn't really know
23.26	what to expect. A lot of people thought
25.26	that it was a Japanese restaurant, and
27.26	maybe it was the name, maybe it was
29.26	the logo, which was like a Japanese
31.26	character, but anyway, we had all these
33.26	requests for Japanese food, which is
35.26	really not what we did. And after about
37.26	the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,
39.26	we decided to give the people
41.26	what they wanted. So this picture is
43.26	an example of printed food, and this was
45.26	the first foray into what we like to call
47.26	flavor transformation. So this is all
49.26	the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,
51.26	a standard maki roll, printed onto
53.26	a little piece of paper.
55.26	HC: So our diners started to get bored
57.26	with this idea, and we decided to give them
59.26	the same course twice, so here we actually
62.26	took an element from the maki roll and
64.26	and took a picture of a dish and then
66.26	basically served that picture with the dish.
69.26	So this dish in particular is basically
71.26	champagne with seafood.
73.26	The champagne grapes that you see are
75.26	actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of
77.26	seafood and some cr√®me fraiche and the
79.26	picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)
82.26	BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.
84.26	We decided to do something
86.26	a little bit different and transform flavors
88.26	that were very familiar -- so in this case,
91.26	we have carrot cake.
93.26	So we take a carrot cake, put it
95.26	in a blender, and we have kind of like
97.26	a carrot cake juice, and then that went into
99.26	a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create
101.26	this hollow shell of carrot cake
104.26	ice cream, I guess, and it comes off
106.26	looking like, you know,
108.26	Jupiter's floating around your plate.
110.26	So yeah, we're transforming things into
112.26	something that you have absolutely
114.26	no reference for.
116.26	HC: And here's something we have no
118.26	reference to eat. This is a cigar, and
120.26	basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of
122.26	a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these
124.26	spices that go into the pork shoulder,
126.26	we fashion that into ash. We take
128.26	the sandwich and wrap it up in
130.26	a collard green, put an edible label
132.26	that bears no similarity to
134.26	a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it
136.26	in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge
138.26	you about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)
141.26	HC: Delicious.
143.26	BR: That's not it, though.
145.26	Instead of making foods that
147.26	look like things that you wouldn't eat,
149.26	we decided to make ingredients
151.26	look like dishes that you know.
153.26	So this is a plate of nachos.
155.26	The difference between our nachos
157.26	and the other guy's nachos,
159.26	is that this is actually a dessert.
161.26	So the chips are candied,
163.26	the ground beef is made from chocolate,
165.26	and the cheese is made from a shredded
167.26	mango sorbet that gets shredded
169.26	into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.
171.26	And after doing all of this
173.26	dematerialization and reconfiguring
176.26	of this, of these ingredients, we realized
179.26	that it was pretty cool,
181.26	because as we served it, we learned that
183.26	the dish actually behaves like the real thing,
185.26	where the cheese begins to melt.
187.26	So when you're looking at this thing
189.26	in the dining room, you have this sensation
191.26	that this is actually a plate of nachos,
193.26	and it's not really until you begin tasting it
195.26	that you realize this is a dessert, and
197.26	it's just kind of like a mind-ripper.
200.26	(Laughter)
202.26	HC: So we had been creating
204.26	all of these dishes out of a
206.26	kitchen that was more like
208.26	a mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and
210.26	the next logical step for us was to install
212.26	a state-of-the-art laboratory,
214.26	and that's what we have here.
216.26	So we put this in the basement, and we
218.26	got really serious about food, like
220.26	serious experimentation.
222.26	BR: One of the really cool things about
224.26	the lab, besides that we have a new
226.26	science lab in the kitchen, is that,
228.26	you know, with this new equipment, and
230.26	this new approach, all these
232.26	different doors to creativity that we never
234.26	knew were there began to open, and so the
236.26	experiments and the food and the dishes
238.26	that we created, they just kept going
241.26	further and further out there.
243.26	HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,
245.26	and let's actually make some cool stuff.
247.26	You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.
249.26	What I see is a cow about to eat something
251.26	delicious. What is that cow eating?
254.26	And why is it delicious?
256.26	So the cow, basically, eats three basic
258.26	things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,
262.26	and so what I do is I actually
264.26	challenge my staff with these crazy,
266.26	wild ideas. Can we take what the cow
269.26	eats, remove the cow, and then make
271.26	some hamburgers out of that?
273.26	And basically the reaction tends to be
275.26	kind of like this. (Laughter)
277.26	BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,
279.26	Chris Jones. This is not the only guy
281.26	that just flips out when we assign
283.26	a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,
286.26	they're hard to understand.
288.26	They're hard to just get automatically.
290.26	There's a lot of research and a lot of
293.26	failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --
296.26	that goes into each and every dish,
298.26	so we don't always get it right, and it takes
300.26	a while for us to be able to explain that
302.26	to people.
304.26	HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I
306.26	staring at each other, we came up with
308.26	something that was pretty close
310.26	to the hamburger patty, and as you can
312.26	see it basically forms like hamburger meat.
314.26	This is made from three ingredients:
317.26	beets, barley, corn, and so it
319.26	actually cooks up like hamburger meat,
321.26	looks and tastes like hamburger meat,
323.26	and not only that, but it's basically
326.26	removing the cow from the equation.
328.26	So replicating food, taking it into that
331.26	next level is where we're going.
333.26	(Applause)
336.26	BR: And it's definitely the world's first
338.26	bleeding veggie burger,
340.26	which is a cool side effect.
343.26	And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar
345.26	with it, is a natural ingredient, and it
347.26	contains a special property.
349.26	It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,
351.26	a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks
353.26	me out every time I eat it, but it has a
355.26	unique ability to mask certain taste
357.26	receptors on your tongue, so that primarily
359.26	sour taste receptors, so normally things
361.26	that would taste very sour or tart,
363.26	somehow begin to taste very sweet.
366.26	HC: You're about to eat a lemon,
368.26	and now it tastes like lemonade.
370.26	Let's just stop and think about the
372.26	economic benefits of something like that.
374.26	We could eliminate sugar across the board
376.26	for all confectionary products and sodas,
378.26	and we can replace it with
380.26	all-natural fresh fruit.
382.26	BR: So you see us here cutting up
384.26	some watermelon. The idea with this
386.26	is that we're going to eliminate tons of
388.26	food miles, wasted energy,
391.26	and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,
394.26	or any exotic produce or item
397.26	from a very far-away place,
400.26	with local, organic produce;
403.26	so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.
405.26	HC: So if miracle berries take sour things
407.26	and turn them into sweet things,
409.26	we have this other pixie dust
411.26	that we put on the watermelon, and it
413.26	makes it go from sweet to savory.
416.26	So after we do that, we put it into
418.26	a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,
420.26	some spices, and we roll it, and this
423.26	starts taking on the appearance of tuna.
425.26	So the key now is to make it
427.26	behave like tuna.
429.26	BR: And then after a quick dip into some
431.26	liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,
434.26	we really have something that looks,
436.26	tastes and behaves like the real thing.
439.26	HC: So the key thing to remember here is,
442.26	we don't really care
445.26	what this tuna really is.
447.26	As long as it's good for you and good for
449.26	the environment, it doesn't matter.
451.26	But where is this going?
453.26	How can we take this idea of tricking your
455.26	tastebuds and leapfrog it into something
457.26	that we can do today that could be
459.26	a disruptive food technology?
461.26	So here's the next challenge.
463.26	I told the staff, let's just take a bunch
465.26	of wild plants, think of them as
467.26	food ingredients. As long as they're
469.26	non-poisonous to the human body,
471.26	go out around Chicago sidewalks,
473.26	take it, blend it, cook it and then
475.26	have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.
478.26	Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this
480.26	and see what they think. (Laughter)
484.26	BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task
486.26	like this -- this is another one of those
488.26	assignments that the kitchen staff
490.26	hated us for. But we really had to almost
492.26	relearn how to cook in general,
495.26	because these are ingredients, you know,
497.26	plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,
499.26	and two, we have no reference for how
501.26	to cook these things because
503.26	people don't eat them.
505.26	So we really had to think about new, creative ways
507.26	to flavor, new ways to cook
509.26	and to change texture -- and that was
511.26	the main issue with this challenge.
513.26	HC: So this is where we step into the future
516.26	and we leapfrog ahead.
518.26	So developing nations
520.26	and first-world nations,
522.26	imagine if you could take these wild plants
524.26	and consume them, food miles would
526.26	basically turn into food feet.
528.26	This disruptive mentality of what food is
530.26	would essentially open up the encyclopedia
533.26	of what raw ingredients are, even if we just
535.26	swapped out, say, one of these for flour,
537.26	that would eliminate so much energy
540.26	and so much waste.
542.26	And to give you a simple example here as to
544.26	what we actually fed these customers,
546.26	there's a bale of hay there
548.26	and some crab apples.
550.26	And basically we took hay and crab apples
552.26	and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.
554.26	People swore they were eating
556.26	barbecue sauce, and this is free food.
559.26	BR: Thanks, guys.
562.26	(Applause)
