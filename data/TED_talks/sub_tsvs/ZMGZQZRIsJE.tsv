170.719	Thank you.
173.834	Hi, everybody.
176.525	Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.
178.644	I'd like to share with you a little bit of me
181.478	playing my life.
183.59	I might look successful and happy
186.279	being in front of you today,
188.377	but I once suffered from severe depression
191.463	and was in total despair.
193.828	The violin, which meant everything to me,
196.933	became a grave burden on me.
199.51	Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,
203.236	their words sounded like meaningless noise.
207.161	When I was just about to give everything up
210.523	after years of suffering,
212.886	I started to rediscover the true power of music.
218.427	(Music)
299.924	In the midst of hardship,
302.776	it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.
308.266	The comfort the music gave me
310.035	was just indescribable,
311.745	and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,
315.909	and it totally changed my perspective on life
319.213	and set me free from the pressure
321.869	of becoming a successful violinist.
326.807	Do you feel like you are all alone?
329.946	I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,
333.505	as it did for me.
336.016	(Music)
412.051	(Applause)
420.758	Thank you.
422.503	Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts
426.44	and have found there are no boundaries.
429.119	My audience is anyone who is here to listen,
432.678	even those who are not familiar with classical music.
436.926	I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls
441.775	like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,
443.71	but also hospitals, churches, prisons,
447.501	and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,
451.721	just to mention a few.
453.687	Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you
458.297	that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,
461.978	and that it can rock you.
464.782	Let me introduce you to my brand new project,
468.21	"""Baroque in Rock,"""
469.715	which became a golden disc most recently.
473.407	It's such an honor for me.
475.904	I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician,
480.145	I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.
484.778	But it's now your turn.
488.345	Changing your perspectives
489.816	will not only transform you but also the whole world.
493.764	Just play your life with all you have,
496.247	and share it with the world.
498.581	I really look forward to witnessing
500.406	a transforming world by you, TEDsters.
504.351	Play your life, and stay tuned.
