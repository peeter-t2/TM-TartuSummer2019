12.392	I'm almost like a crazy evangelical.
14.586	I've always known that the age of design is upon us,
17.331	almost like a rapture.
19.412	If the day is sunny, I think,
20.947	"""Oh, the gods have had a good design day."""
23.472	Or, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,
27.788	particularly beautiful, I say
29.09	he's so good because he clearly looked to design
32.09	to understand what he needed to do.
33.813	So I really do believe that design
36.514	is the highest form of creative expression.
39.276	That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,
42.986	and the age of design is the age in which design
45.181	is still cute furniture, is still posters,
49.02	is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.
51.878	But in truth, what I really would like to explain
55.703	to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that
58.005	the most interesting chairs are the ones
60.668	that are actually made by a robot,
63.545	like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,
66.326	where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur
70.058	of recycled refrigerator parts,
72.914	as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.
77.382	Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time
81.017	and that become part of our identity.
83.146	I want people to understand
84.866	that design is so much more than cute chairs,
88.081	that it is first and foremost everything that is around us
91.548	in our life.
93.137	And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about
95.97	tonight is not simply design but interaction design.
99.146	And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying
103.023	to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art
105.401	for a few years, starting not very timidly
108.365	but just pointedly with works, for instance,
111.139	by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine
113.7	plays chess with itself, that you see here,
116.644	or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface
120.108	for One Laptop Per Child,
122.218	Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,
126.072	and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,
129.284	and John Maeda's Reactive Books,
131.74	and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.
135.905	These were some of the first acquisitions that really
138.596	introduced the idea of interaction design to the public.
141.78	But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper
146.019	into interaction design with examples
148.252	that are emotionally really suggestive
150.995	and that really explain interaction design at a level
153.7	that is almost undeniable.
155.771	The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,
158.851	I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.
161.267	It looks at the territory of the United States
163.789	as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds
169.514	and that is really giving you a pictorial image
172.687	of what's going on with the winds in the United States.
175.911	But also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,
180.53	and that's where all hell broke loose
183.073	in a really interesting way. (Laughter)
185.241	There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.
187.921	And that's really what I find so intriguing
190.895	about the reactions that we've had to the anointment
195.444	of video games in the MoMA collection.
197.68	We've -- No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.
200.967	I love them. So we are in the right quadrant.
203.112	We are in the Highbrow -- that's daring, that's courageous --
207.346	and Brilliant, which is great.
208.769	Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,
212.105	but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter)
215.472	But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic.
218.6	So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.
220.816	"""Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art."""
223.484	Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.
227.769	"""Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh"" --"
231.576	They're two floors away. (Laughter) —
234.736	"""will mean game over for any real understanding of art."""
239.404	I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?
243.379	We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.
245.216	And Jonathan Jones is making it happen.
247.953	So the same Guardian rebuts,
250.727	"""Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be."
253.466	Last week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested
256.055	that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?
259.369	"And does it matter?"" Thank you. Does it matter?"
261.844	You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem
264.585	of design being often misunderstood for art,
267.537	or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to
271.404	aspire to, would like to be called, artists.
274.729	No. Designers aspire to be really great designers.
278.041	Thank you very much. And that's more than enough.
279.954	So my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,
283.441	without any prompt, came out with this big declaration
286.943	on why video games belong in the MoMA.
289.313	And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.
291.473	But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article
295.129	that came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,
298.177	"by Liel Leibovitz, and it said, ""MoMA has mistaken video games for art."" Again."
302.137	"""The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso."" Again."
305.557	"""That misses the point."""
306.676	Excuse me. You're missing the point.
308.534	And here, look, the above question is put bluntly:
312.582	"""Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art"
315.932	"because they are quite thoroughly something else: code."""
320.453	Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right?
324.004	So it's so fantastic to see
326.234	how these feathers that were ruffled,
329.43	and these reactions, were so vehement.
331.496	And you know what?
332.555	The International Cat Video Film Festival
335.072	didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter)
337.505	I think this was truly fantastic.
339.244	We were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous
342.219	of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,
345.535	because it's very, very wonderful.
347.919	And there's this Flaubert quote that I love:
350.859	"""I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,"
352.804	but a tide of shit is beating at its walls,
355.164	"threatening to undermine it."""
357.11	I consider myself the tide of shit.
359.255	(Laughter) (Applause)
364.899	You know, we have to go through that.
366.589	Even in the 1930s, my colleagues
369.365	that were trying to put together an abstract art show
371.89	had all of these works stopped by the customs officers
374.887	that decided they were not art.
376.891	So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,
379.459	but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud
383.739	to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.
387.963	And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.
393.356	And you know, the amount of work --
395.882	yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government
399.471	and that's how he developed Tetris,
401.325	and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game
405.211	and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube
408.949	that makes it look slightly bombed.
412.46	And it's fantastic.
413.964	So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,
417.128	because we're still the Museum of Modern Art,
418.531	so even when we tackle popular culture,
420.238	we tackle it as a form of interaction design
423.367	and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,
425.517	therefore, has to be researched.
427.581	So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's
430.531	wonderful Another World, amongst others,
433.179	we put together a panel of experts,
434.859	and we worked on this acquisition,
436.369	and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.
439.876	We worked on it for a year and a half.
442.125	So many people helped us — designers of games,
445.098	you might know Jamin Warren
447.268	and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,
449.756	and you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.
451.488	We bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.
454.752	We were not real gamers enough,
456.898	so we had to really talk to them.
458.954	And so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,
462.515	not the other Sim City, that one in particular,
465.443	so the criteria that we developed along the way
468.442	were really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.
471.691	They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.
475.875	That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game
479.178	or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve
483.069	and show artifacts that will more and more
485.884	become part of our lives in the future.
487.847	We live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,
490.899	not in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone
494.115	that our mind makes of the two.
496.155	And that's really where interaction lies,
499.284	and that's the importance of interaction.
501.539	And in order to explain interaction, we need to really
504.683	bring people in and make them realize
507.324	how interaction is part of their lives.
509.03	So when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,
511.859	which are in a way the purest form of interaction,
514.372	unadulterated by any kind of function or finality.
517.844	I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,
520.991	which I consider a masterpiece of interaction.
523.117	I mean, that interface is beautiful.
525.428	It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.
529.005	You know, with your mitt you can actually paw
532.564	the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad
535.833	ATM machines usually are.
538.894	So I let people understand that it's up to them
541.723	to know how to judge interaction
543.965	so as to know when it's good or when it's bad.
545.992	So when I show The Sims,
547.645	I try to make people really feel what it meant
551.122	to have an interaction with The Sims,
553.021	not only the fun but also the responsibility
555.378	that came with the Tamagotchi.
557.253	You know, video games can be truly deep
559.133	even when they're completely mindless.
560.877	I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.
563.405	It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can
567.126	in a finite amount of time
568.957	and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.
571.32	I've never made it into a planet, but that's it.
573.565	Or, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.
576.733	It was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.
578.925	And it was one of the first video games
580.594	in which you could choose your own music.
582.295	So you would put into the PlayStation,
584.617	you would put your own CD,
586.422	and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic.
591.184	Not to mention Eve Online.
592.595	Eve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,
595.676	but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,
598.229	not Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,
600.837	was a really big shot in Eve Online,
602.705	so here you have a diplomat in the real world
605.325	that spends his time in Eve Online
607.813	to kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy
611.982	and about universe-building, and to the point that
614.939	the first announcement of the bombing
616.949	was actually given on Eve Online,
619.365	and after his death, several parts of the universe
621.749	were named after him.
623.209	And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival
627.043	in Reykjavík that was quite amazing.
629.181	I mean, we're talking about an experience
631.733	that of course can seem weird to many,
634.525	but that is very educational.
636.423	Of course, there are games that are even more educational.
639.296	Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail
641.988	of this kind of massive multiplayer online game,
644.377	and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,
646.923	and they were greeted
649.557	by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.
652.765	It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.
655.357	So you start seeing here that
657.901	the aesthetics that are so important
659.661	to a museum collection like MoMA's
661.504	are kept alive also by the selection of these games.
665.165	And you know, Valve -- you know, Portal --
667.125	is an example of a video game in which
669.248	you have a certain type of violence
671.562	which also leads me to talk about
673.661	one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss
676.007	when we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.
678.267	Right? We had to make decisions.
680.671	At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence
684.229	depicted in the art part of the collection,
687.133	but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,
690.349	"I said, ""You know what, we need a Beretta."""
691.9	"And I was told, ""No. No guns in the design collection."""
695.013	"And I was like, ""Why?"""
695.945	Interestingly, I learned that it's considered
699.461	that in design and in the design collection,
701.211	what you see is what you get.
702.448	So when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.
706.338	If it's in the art collection,
707.951	it might be a critique of the killing instrument.
711.695	So it's very interesting.
713.401	But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,
716.04	so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.
718.531	But here, in this particular case, we decided,
721.795	you know, with Kate and Paul,
723.078	that we would have no gratuitous violence.
725.337	So we have Portal because you shoot walls
728.089	in order to create new spaces.
729.409	We have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.
732.514	(Laughter)
734.03	But we don't have GTA because,
738.132	maybe it's my own reflection,
739.739	I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars
742.122	and shooting prostitutes and pimps.
744.082	So it was not very constructive. (Laughter)
747.623	So, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this
751.869	for so many days. You have no idea.
754.956	And to this day, I am ambivalent,
757.283	but when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.
760.699	It's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.
763.899	It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.
768.185	Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones.
772.01	So it's quite a hefty collection.
773.844	And right now, we started with the first 14,
776.102	but we have several that are coming up,
777.995	and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet
779.907	is because you don't acquire just the game.
782.335	You acquire the relationship with the company.
784.409	What we want, what we aspire to, is the code.
787.507	It's very hard to get, of course.
788.904	But that's what would enable us to preserve
790.777	the video games for a really long time,
792.766	and that's what museums do.
794.039	They also preserve artifacts for posterity.
796.64	In absence of the code, because, you know,
799.26	video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,
803.027	in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.
806.523	We're going to stay with them forever.
807.803	They're not going to get rid of us.
809.036	And one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter)
812.507	But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose
815.675	for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.
818.697	And I'm showing you Core War here,
820.738	which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically
824.053	of the limitations of the processor.
825.874	So the kind of interferences that you see here
829.123	that look like beautiful barriers in the game
831.767	are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,
836.114	which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.
839.194	And so is space, the spatial aspect of games.
843.198	You know, I feel that the best video games
845.342	are the ones that have really savvy architects
848.878	that are behind them, and if they're not architects,
851.501	bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.
854.139	But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important.
858.227	Time. The way we experience time in video games,
861.187	as in other forms of interaction design,
863.969	is really quite amazing.
865.228	It can be real time or it can be the time within the game,
868.233	as is in Animal Crossing, where seasons
870.449	follow each other at their own pace.
873.041	So time, space, aesthetics,
876.32	and then, most important, behavior.
878.689	The real core issue of interaction design is behavior.
882.809	Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors
886.286	that go to influence the rest of our lives.
888.601	They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.
891.136	In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,
893.185	which is a beautiful game
894.386	in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,
897.657	so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,
900.09	and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.
904.622	In a way, you can see how video games
906.977	are the purest aspect of interaction design
909.689	and are very useful to explain what interaction is.
914.308	We don't want to show the video games
916.393	with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.
919.335	If anything, we want to show the code,
921.017	and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,
924.031	of the Pac-Man code.
925.52	So the way we acquired the games is very interesting
929.859	and very unorthodox. You see them here
932.055	displayed alongside other examples of design,
936.063	furniture and other parts,
937.673	but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,
940.901	only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.
943.85	The controllers are, of course, part of the experience,
945.994	so you cannot do away with it.
948.443	But interestingly, this choice was not condemned
952.941	too vehemently by gamers.
954.286	I was afraid that they would kill us,
955.593	and instead they understood, especially
957.659	when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem
960.363	that Philip Johnson applied in 1934
963.505	when he wanted to make people understand
965.547	the importance of design, and he took propeller blades
967.859	and pieces of machinery and
970.139	in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals
973.266	against white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.
976.483	He created this strange distance, this shock,
980.211	that made people realize how gorgeous formally,
983.869	and also important functionally, design pieces were.
987.637	I would like to do the same with video games.
989.891	By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts
992.971	and everything else that we might remember from our childhood,
995.579	I want people to understand
1000.15	that those are important forms of design.
1002.019	And in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else
1005.197	lead us to make people understand
1007.881	a wider meaning for design.
1010.223	One of my dream acquisitions,
1012.276	which has been on hold for a few years
1014.191	but now will come back on the front burner,
1017.193	is a 747.
1018.625	I would like to acquire it, but without owning it.
1021.563	I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.
1024.874	I want it to keep flying.
1026.258	So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement
1029.798	with an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying.
1034.565	"And the same with the ""@"" sign that we acquired a few years ago."
1037.683	It was the first example of an acquisition of something
1039.865	that is in the public domain.
1041.27	And what I say to people, it's almost as if
1043.03	a butterfly were flying by
1045.004	and we captured the shadow on the wall,
1048.153	and just we're showing the shadow.
1049.61	So in a way, we're showing a manifestation
1051.818	of something that is truly important
1054.331	and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.
1057.962	And it's too long to explain the acquisition,
1059.898	but if you want to go on the MoMA blog,
1062.404	there's a long post where I explain why
1064.498	it's such a great example of design.
1066.786	Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?
1070.147	I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.
1074.466	But I see that people are coming along,
1077.282	that the audiences, paradoxically,
1079.032	are much more responsive and much more understanding
1081.858	of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.
1085.916	Design is truly everywhere,
1087.443	and design is as important as anything,
1090.411	and I'm so glad that, because of its diversity
1092.871	and because of its centrality to our lives,
1095.186	many more people are coming to it
1096.914	as a profession, as a passion,
1099.003	and as, very simply, part of their own culture.
1101.977	Thank you very much.
