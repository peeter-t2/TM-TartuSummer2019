12.207	I'd like to reimagine education.
15.558	The last year
17.148	has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.
20.054	It starts with an M.
21.967	MOOC: massive open online courses.
26.424	Many organizations
27.901	are offering these online courses
30.659	to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.
34.689	Anybody who has an Internet connection
36.249	and the will to learn can access these great courses
38.777	from excellent universities
40.871	and get a credential at the end of it.
44.128	Now, in this discussion today,
46.752	I'm going to focus
47.987	on a different aspect of MOOCs.
51.255	We are taking what we are learning
53.606	and the technologies we are developing in the large
56.171	and applying them in the small
58.271	to create a blended model of education
61.25	to really reinvent and reimagine
63.043	what we do in the classroom.
65.47	Now, our classrooms could use change.
67.98	So, here's a classroom
70.401	at this little three-letter institute
72.426	in the Northeast of America, MIT.
75.21	And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,
77.529	and this is a classroom today.
80.996	What's changed?
84.116	The seats are in color.
86.663	Whoop-de-do.
89.791	Education really hasn't changed
92.502	in the past 500 years.
94.197	The last big innovation in education
96.528	was the printing press and the textbooks.
100.01	Everything else has changed around us.
101.42	You know, from healthcare to transportation,
103.243	everything is different,
103.243	but education hasn't changed.
107.736	It's also been a real issue in terms of access.
110.409	So what you see here
112.036	is not a rock concert.
114.538	And the person you see at the end of the stage
117.084	is not Madonna.
119.144	This is a classroom
120.773	at the Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria.
125.191	Now, we've all heard of distance education,
129.127	but the students way in the back,
132.607	I think they are undergoing long-distance education.
137.502	Now, I really believe
139.177	that we can transform education,
141.392	both in quality and scale and access,
144.238	through technology.
146.546	For example, at edX,
150.241	we are trying to transform education
152.494	through online technologies.
155.654	Given education has been calcified for 500 years,
158.913	we really cannot think about reengineering it,
161.104	micromanaging it.
162.249	We really have to completely reimagine it.
164.557	It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.
168.598	Even the infrastructure has to change.
170.121	Everything has to change.
171.734	We need to go from lectures on the blackboard
175.099	to online exercises, online videos.
177.707	We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories
180.188	and gamification.
181.837	We have to go to completely online grading
183.748	and peer interaction and discussion boards.
186.501	Everything really has to change.
188.782	So at edX and a number of other organizations,
191.288	we are applying these technologies to education
193.447	through MOOCs to really
193.447	increase access to education.
196.633	And you heard of this example,
198.35	where, when we launched our very first course --
200.966	and this was an MIT-hard
202.732	circuits and electronics course --
204.32	about a year and a half ago,
212.317	enrolled in this course.
214.02	And we had no marketing budget.
216.706	Now, 155,000 is a big number.
220.194	This number is bigger
221.933	than the total number of alumni of MIT
224.564	in its 150-year history.
228.389	7,200 students passed the course,
230.547	and this was a hard course.
233.01	7,200 is also a big number.
236.464	If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,
240.006	I would have to teach for 40 years
242.883	before I could teach this many students.
245.485	Now these large numbers
247.023	are just one part of the story.
249.181	So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,
251.843	the other side of MOOCs,
253.068	take a different perspective.
255.247	We are taking what we develop
255.247	and learn in the large
258.182	and applying it in the small
259.727	to the classroom, to create
259.727	a blended model of learning.
263.723	But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.
268.326	When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,
272.41	she stopped speaking English,
275.777	and she began speaking this new language.
278.838	I call it teen-lish.
281.644	It's a digital language.
283.856	It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.
290.57	"""Honey, come over for dinner."""
293.886	"""Hmm."""
295.481	"""Did you hear me?"""
297.615	Silence. (Laughter)
299.878	"""Can you listen to me?"""
301.25	&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot;
302.622	So we had a real issue with communicating,
304.578	and we were just not communicating,
306.846	until one day I had this epiphany.
309.86	I texted her. (Laughter)
312.523	I got an instant response.
314.841	I said, no, that must have been by accident.
316.526	She must have thought, you know,
317.613	some friend of hers was calling her.
319.9	So I texted her again. Boom, another response.
322.997	I said, this is great.
324.806	And so since then, our life has changed.
326.862	I text her, she responds.
328.42	It's just been absolutely great.
330.922	(Applause)
336.777	So our millennial generation
338.747	is built differently.
340.381	Now, I'm older, and my
340.381	youthful looks might belie that,
342.882	but I'm not in the millennial generation.
346.738	But our kids are really different.
348.37	The millennial generation is completely comfortable
350.229	with online technology.
351.469	So why are we fighting it in the classroom?
353.498	Let's not fight it. Let's embrace it.
355.131	In fact, I believe -- and I have two fat thumbs,
356.82	I can't text very well --
358.469	but I'm willing to bet that with evolution,
360.636	our kids and their grandchildren
362.881	will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs
364.711	to text much better,
366.094	that evolution will fix all of that stuff.
368.954	But what if we embraced technology,
370.725	embraced the millennial generation's
373.329	natural predilections,
374.594	and really think about creating
374.594	these online technologies,
377.639	blend them into their lives.
379.073	So here's what we can do.
380.896	So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,
383.388	herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --
385.96	I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,
388.718	so why are we forcing our kids to do that?
390.8	So instead what you do
391.974	is you have them watch videos
393.994	and do interactive exercises
395.805	in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,
398.494	in the dining room, in the bathroom,
400.355	wherever they're most creative.
402.932	Then they come into the classroom
404.927	for some in-person interaction.
408.351	They can have discussions amongst themselves.
410.188	They can solve problems together.
411.764	They can work with the professor
412.91	and have the professor answer their questions.
415.904	In fact, with edX, when we
415.904	were teaching our first course
419.767	on circuits and electronics around the world,
422.193	this was happening unbeknownst to us.
424.572	Two high school teachers
426.111	at the Sant High School in Mongolia
429.793	had flipped their classroom,
431.94	and they were using our video lectures
434.219	and interactive exercises,
436.092	where the learners in the high school,
439.288	would go and do these things in their own homes
441.122	and they would come into class,
442.469	and as you see from this image here,
444.405	they would interact with each other
445.491	and do some physical laboratory work.
447.828	And the only way we discovered this
449.149	was they wrote a blog
450.572	and we happened to stumble upon that blog.
454.595	We were also doing other pilots.
456.702	So we did a pilot experimental blended courses,
459.184	working with San Jose State University in California,
462.156	again, with the circuits and electronics course.
464.003	You'll hear that a lot. That course has become
466.471	sort of like our petri dish of learning.
469.947	So there, the students would, again,
472.215	the instructors flipped the classroom,
474.942	blended online and in person,
476.663	and the results were staggering.
478.971	Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.
481.613	Just wait a little bit longer as we
481.613	experiment with this some more,
484.101	but the early results are incredible.
486.262	So traditionally, semester upon semester,
488.659	for the past several years, this course,
491	again, a hard course,
492.689	had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent
495.805	every semester.
497.305	With this blended class late last year,
500.003	the failure rate fell to nine percent.
503.984	So the results can be extremely, extremely good.
507.747	Now before we go too far into this,
510.974	I'd like to spend some time discussing
513.626	some key ideas.
514.775	What are some key ideas
515.986	that makes all of this work?
518.843	One idea is active learning.
521.07	The idea here is, rather than have students
523.51	walk into class and watch lectures,
525.696	we replace this with what we call lessons.
528.738	Lessons are interleaved sequences
530.982	of videos and interactive exercises.
533.663	So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video
536.842	and follow that with an interactive exercise.
539.882	Think of this as the ultimate
539.882	Socratization of education.
543.027	You teach by asking questions.
545.007	And this is a form of learning
546.511	called active learning,
547.788	and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,
551.067	by Craik and Lockhart,
552.585	where they said and discovered
554.106	that learning and retention really relates strongly
556.486	to the depth of mental processing.
558.235	Students learn much better
559.727	when they are interacting with the material.
562.915	The second idea is self-pacing.
565.693	Now, when I went to a lecture hall,
567.329	and if you were like me,
568.619	by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.
570.585	I wasn't all that smart, and I would
570.585	be scrambling, taking notes,
574.165	and then I would lose the lecture
574.165	for the rest of the hour.
577.356	Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,
579.826	we offer videos and interactive
579.826	engagements to students?
583.694	They can hit the pause button.
585.425	They can rewind the professor.
587.916	Heck, they can even mute the professor.
591.015	So this form of self-pacing
593.069	can be very helpful to learning.
595.694	The third idea that we have is instant feedback.
599.048	With instant feedback,
600.525	the computer grades exercises.
602.38	I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?
604.675	Your computer is grading all the exercises.
606.969	And we've all submitted homeworks,
608.503	and your grades come back two weeks later,
610.544	you've forgotten all about it.
612.168	I don't think I've still received
612.168	some of my homeworks
614.245	from my undergraduate days.
615.73	Some are never graded.
617.077	So with instant feedback,
618.571	students can try to apply answers.
620.061	If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.
622.47	They can try it again and try it again,
624.118	and this really becomes much more engaging.
626.051	They get the instant feedback,
627.634	and this little green check mark that you see here
630.553	is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.
634.143	Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night
637.047	dreaming of the green check mark.
640.491	In fact, one of our learners
642.293	who took the circuits course early last year,
645.074	he then went on to take a software course
647.006	from Berkeley at the end of the year,
649.307	and this is what the learner had to say
651.453	on our discussion board
652.725	when he just started that course
654.251	about the green check mark:
656.772	&amp;quot;Oh god; have I missed you.&amp;quot;
658.829	When's the last time you've seen students
661.527	posting comments like this about homework?
665.988	My colleague Ed Bertschinger,
668.384	who heads up the physics department at MIT,
670.554	has this to say about instant feedback:
673.398	He indicated that instant feedback
676.399	turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.
682.174	The next big idea is gamification.
684.466	You know, all learners engage really well
686.367	with interactive videos and so on.
687.876	You know, they would sit down and shoot
689.141	alien spaceships all day long until they get it.
691.485	So we applied these gamification
691.485	techniques to learning,
694.272	and we can build these online laboratories.
696.495	How do you teach creativity?
696.495	How do you teach design?
698.752	We can do this through online labs
700.421	and use computing power
701.698	to build these online labs.
703.287	So as this little video shows here,
705.675	you can engage students
707.14	much like they design with Legos.
708.747	So here, the learners are building a circuit
710.665	with Lego-like ease.
712.556	And this can also be graded by the computer.
716.647	Fifth is peer learning.
719.581	So here, we use discussion forums and discussions
722.416	and Facebook-like interaction
724.516	not as a distraction,
726.38	but to really help students learn.
729.227	Let me tell you a story.
730.944	When we did our circuits course
734.17	for the 155,000 students,
736.036	I didn't sleep for three nights
737.701	leading up to the launch of the course.
739.588	I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,
742.147	we're going to be up
743.413	monitoring the forum, answering questions.
745.287	They had answered questions for 100 students.
747.26	How do you do that for 150,000?
750.121	So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,
752.457	and I think there's this question
753.678	from a student from Pakistan,
755.649	and he asked a question, and I said,
756.977	okay, let me go and type up an answer,
758.433	I don't type all that fast,
760.041	and I begin typing up the answer,
761.605	and before I can finish,
763.299	another student from Egypt
763.299	popped in with an answer,
765.973	not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,
767.891	and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.
769.859	had popped in with a different answer.
771.468	And then I sat back, fascinated.
774.268	Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were
776.215	discussing and interacting with each other,
778.166	and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,
780.684	having this epiphany,
782.152	and by 4 a.m. in the morning,
783.408	they had discovered the right answer.
785.161	And all I had to do was go and bless it,
786.888	"""Good answer."""
788.854	So this is absolutely amazing,
791.206	where students are learning from each other,
793.016	and they're telling us that they are learning
795.833	by teaching.
798.13	Now this is all not just in the future.
800.11	This is happening today.
801.862	So we are applying these blended learning pilots
804.179	in a number of universities and 
804.179	high schools around the world,
806.92	from Tsinghua in China
808.706	to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia
811.138	to Berkeley in California --
812.749	all over the world.
814.108	And these kinds of technologies really help,
816.132	the blended model can really help
817.681	revolutionize education.
819.779	It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,
823.19	the business aspect.
824.87	We can also license these MOOC courses
827.186	to other universities,
828.925	and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,
831.489	where the university that
831.489	licenses it with the professor
833.878	can use these online courses
835.715	like the next-generation textbook.
837.916	They can use as much or as little as they like,
840.371	and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.
845.857	Finally, I would like to have you
847.907	dream with me for a little bit.
850.748	I would like us to really reimagine education.
854.917	We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.
859.042	We have to move from books to tablets
861.717	like the Aakash in India
863.543	or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.
865.891	The Aakash is 40 dollars.
867.898	We have to move from
867.898	bricks-and-mortar school buildings
870.812	to digital dormitories.
873.433	But I think at the end of the day,
874.881	I think we will still need one lecture hall
877.123	in our universities.
879.685	Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren
882.509	that your grandparents sat in that room
885.904	in neat little rows like cornstalks
889.128	and watched this professor at the end
891.681	talk about content and, you know,
894.328	you didn't even have a rewind button?
896.975	Thank you.
899.203	(Applause)
901.194	Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
