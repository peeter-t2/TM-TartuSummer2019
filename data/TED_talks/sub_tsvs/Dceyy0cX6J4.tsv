12.985	It's funny the things you forget.
15.809	I went to see my mother the other day,
15.809	and she told me this story
19.523	that I'd completely
19.523	forgotten about
21.715	how, when we were driving together,
21.715	she would pull the car over,
25.125	and by the time she had
25.125	gotten out of the car,
27.305	and gone around the car
27.305	to let me out of the car,
29.773	I would have already gotten out of the car
31.875	and pretended to have died.
34.138	(Laughter)
37.108	(Applause)
47.386	Because that's how you die.
48.927	(Laughter)
50.884	And I remember, that was a game
50.884	I used to play with myself
54.011	to entertain myself whenever
54.011	I was bored or frustrated.
58.174	(Laughter)
60.173	Settle down.
61.54	(Laughter)
63.929	People say we live in an age
63.929	of information overload. Right?
66.841	I don't know about that,
68.029	but I just know that I get
68.029	too many marketing emails.
70.616	I got a marketing email
70.616	from a supermarket firm,
73.089	which will remain nameless
74.922	for predominantly legal reasons,
76.892	"but which I'm going to call ""SafeMart."""
79.397	(Laughter)
81.479	I got an email from them,
81.479	and it went like this, it said:
84.701	"""Just three weeks until SafeMart"
84.701	"at King's Cross opens!!!"""
88.966	And I resented this,
90.402	because not only do I not remember
90.402	signing up to that,
94.597	but I resent the fact
94.597	that they appear to think
97.333	that I should be excited
97.333	about a shop opening.
101.259	So what I did was I scrolled down
101.259	to the bottom of the email,
104.268	"and I pressed, ""Unsubscribe."""
106.238	And I thought that'd be the end of it.
108.095	But a week later,
108.095	I got another one that said,
110.275	"""Just two weeks"
112.664	"until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"""
114.603	And I thought, obviously,
114.603	I haven't clicked hard enough.
117.254	So I tried it again. Right?
120.254	Lo and behold, a week passes,
120.254	you guessed it,
122.763	"""Just one week until SafeMart"
122.763	"at King's Cross opens!!!"""
126.844	And here's the problem:
128.71	The internet gave us access to everything;
131.889	but it also gave everything access to us.
135.177	It's hard enough to discriminate
136.774	between the things that genuinely
136.774	matter in this world
139.353	and the minutiae of life,
140.901	without having emails
140.901	about supermarket chains
143.6	and Candy Crush Saga.
146.696	And I was really annoyed with them,
148.427	and I thought, OK, I was about to write
148.427	a strongly worded email,
151.629	which I can do quite well.
152.914	(Laughter)
155.144	And I thought, no --
157.252	I'm going to find the game.
158.972	So I replied to it, and I said,
161.105	"""I literally cannot wait!!!!"""
163.535	(Laughter)
167.173	"""What do you need from me?"""
171.201	They got back to me;
171.201	a guy called Dan said,
173.235	"""Hi James. I've asked a colleague"
173.235	"to help me with your query."""
176.173	(Laughter)
177.217	Like it needs help.
180.364	"And I said, ""What's the plan, Dan?"
182.143	"I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."""
184.46	(Laughter)
188.276	"""I'm not sure what you mean."""
189.775	(Laughter)
191.512	"I said, ""I'm just tremendously"
191.512	"excited about the opening!"""
194.333	(Laughter)
197.362	"""Do you want to book"
197.362	"the bouncy castle or shall I?"""
203.687	"He said, ""I think you have misunderstood."""
205.863	(Laughter)
207.402	"""A new store is opening,"
207.402	"but there is no celebration planned."""
211.599	"I said, ""But what was all the 'Three weeks"
211.599	until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?
215.603	"I was getting excited."""
217.766	(Laughter)
220.296	"""I'm sorry you're disappointed."""
221.874	(Laughter)
225.694	"I said, ""Not to worry."
228.216	Let's do something anyway!
231.381	Besides, the deposit on the bouncy
231.381	"castle was non-refundable."""
234.393	(Laughter)
238.812	"""If we don't use it, we're out"
238.812	"a few hundred quid, Dan."""
241.656	(Laughter)
244.718	"He said, ""Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible"
244.718	"for anything you have ordered."""
249.454	"I said, ""Let's not get into who did what."
254.182	Bottom line: you and I
254.182	"are in this together."""
256.835	(Laughter)
259.103	(Applause)
263.452	"""Question: Will you be there"
263.452	"to make sure people take their shoes off?"""
266.854	(Laughter)
271.429	I'll be honest, then my relationship
271.429	with Dan deteriorated somewhat,
274.899	because the next email I got was this:
277.248	"""Thanks for your email -"
277.248	"your Case Number is ..."""
279.654	(Laughter)
281.981	That's outrageous.
283.156	"I said, ""Dan?"""
284.331	(Laughter)
286.195	And I got -- and I was just like,
286.195	this is ... -- and I, I ....
289.141	"And I said, ""Danny?"""
291.407	And I thought, this is terrible.
291.407	All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.
296.047	"I said, ""D-Dog?"""
297.618	(Laughter)
300.03	"""The store is now open."""
301.35	(Laughter)
305.104	"I said, ""But Dan, they must have wondered"
305.104	"why there was no bouncy castle."""
310.587	And then we were back to this.
315.123	And that might have been
315.123	the end of the story,
317.754	but I remembered
317.754	that anything -- everything --
321.83	even something as mundane
321.83	as getting out of a car,
325.426	can be fun if you find the right game.
329.474	So,
331.944	this is what I replied:
334.063	[Thanks for your email -
334.063	your Case Number is #0000001.]
336.694	(Laughter)
339.004	(Applause)
344.843	And we just, uh ...
346.262	(Laughter)
348.287	It was like we were dancing.
350.464	It was just a beautiful relationship.
352.731	We just kept going.
355.15	It was lovely.
356.616	But to be honest, guys,
356.616	it was quite labor-intensive,
359.525	and I had other stuff to do,
362.594	believe it or not.
365.262	So what I did is I have a little email
365.262	auto-replier program.
372.358	And I set it up so every time
372.358	it receives an email from SafeMart,
375.517	it just pings one back.
376.691	So I set it up, and it says,
378.066	"""Thanks for your email -"
378.066	"your Case Number is ..."""
380.451	Then it has a little formula that I wrote
380.451	to up the case number every time.
384.329	And I put it on the server
386.455	and set it running.
389.681	(Laughter)
394.889	I'll be honest, guys --
396.099	then I forgot about it.
397.519	(Laughter)
400.453	I checked back on it the other day,
402.616	and it appears there have been
402.616	a number of emails going back and forth.
409.661	We're on 21,439.
412.67	(Applause)
419.252	It gives me an immense
419.252	sense of satisfaction to know
422.328	that these computer programs
422.328	are just going to be pinging one another
426.273	for eternity.
428.926	And as legacies go,
428.926	I don't think that's bad.
433.573	So guys, just remember:
435.407	if ever you feel weighed down
435.407	by the bureaucracy
438.884	and often mundanity of modern life,
442.073	don't fight the frustration.
446.263	Let it be the catalyst
448.725	for whimsy.
451.739	(Laughter)
454.278	Thank you.
455.461	(Applause)
