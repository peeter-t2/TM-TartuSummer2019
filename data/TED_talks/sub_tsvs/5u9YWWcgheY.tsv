29	Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?
32	It's not a joke yet;
33	those aren't the jokes.
36	Is this thing off?
43	I went to Aspen recently
46	and stumbled into this song.
55	♫ Black men go to Aspen ♫
57	♫ and rent colorful chalets. ♫
66	♫ Giggle at the questions ♫
68	♫ their mere presence seems to raise. ♫
78	♫ Get taken for men ♫
80	♫ we don't resemble in the least. ♫
85	"""Are you ... ?"""
87	"""No."""
89	♫ It's a winter wonderland ♫
92	♫ in the belly of the beast. ♫
95	♫ And black men ski. ♫
101	♫ Black men ski. ♫
107	♫ Black men send back sushi ♫
109	♫ with a scorned Yakuza's flair. ♫
118	♫ We make postmodern art ♫
120	♫ with bacon grease ♫
122	♫ and hot combed hair. ♫
130	♫ We secretly play Beethoven ♫
133	♫ inside our bassmobiles. ♫
141	♫ We can tell you how cool looks ♫
144	♫ but cannot show you how it feels ♫
147	♫ when black men ski. ♫
151	♫ When black men ski. ♫
159	♫ Black men now are students ♫
161	♫ of gay sensibility. ♫
164	♫ We wear ironic T-shirts ♫
167	♫ drenched in code unknown to thee. ♫
170	♫ We get baptized in Walden Pond ♫
173	♫ amongst a searing mob ♫
175	♫ because the cleansing blood of Jesus ♫
178	♫ could not do a thorough job. ♫
181	♫ Black men ski. ♫
187	♫ Black men ski. ♫
192	♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫
195	♫ and Germans cook soul food. ♫
198	♫ White boys rap and hippies nap ♫
201	♫ their dreads up to look rude. ♫
203	♫ Jazz is now suburban ♫
206	♫ it's Marsalisly clean. ♫
209	♫ And now we've got Viagra ♫
212	♫ everyone's a sex machine. ♫
214	♫ So black men ski. ♫
219	What else can we do?
220	♫ Black men ski. ♫
226	♫ Black men ski. ♫
231	♫ Black men ski. ♫
237	♫ Some kids I'll describe as friends ♫
240	♫ say I am race-obsessed. ♫
243	♫ The luxury of your opinion ♫
245	♫ shows that you are blessed. ♫
248	♫ See, I have poems about sunsets ♫
251	♫ flowers and the rain. ♫
254	♫ I've read them to policemen ♫
257	♫ but it was all in vain. ♫
259	♫ So black men ski. ♫
265	♫ Black men ski ... ♫
269	elegantly.
270	♫ Black men ski. ♫
276	♫ Black men ski. ♫
