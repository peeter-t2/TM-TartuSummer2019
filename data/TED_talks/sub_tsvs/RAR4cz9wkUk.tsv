12.973	While preparing for my talk
15.209	I was reflecting on my life
15.209	and trying to figure out
19.263	where exactly was that moment
19.263	when my journey began.
24.187	A long time passed by,
24.187	and I simply couldn't figure out
26.834	the beginning or the middle
26.834	or the end of my story.
29.806	I always used to think that my beginning
31.757	was one afternoon in my community
31.757	when my mother had told me
35.867	that I had escaped three
35.867	arranged marriages by the time I was two.
40.278	Or one evening when electricity had failed
40.278	for eight hours in our community,
44.713	and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,
46.965	telling us stories of when he was
46.965	a little kid struggling to go to school
50.866	while his father, who was a farmer,
50.866	wanted him to work in the fields with him.
54.974	Or that dark night when I was 16
57.722	when three little kids had come to me
57.722	and they whispered in my ear
62.139	that my friend was murdered
62.139	in something called the honor killings.
68.106	But then I realized that,
70.231	as much as I know that these moments
70.231	have contributed on my journey,
73.948	they have influenced my journey
75.548	but they have not been
75.548	the beginning of it,
77.707	but the true beginning of my journey
77.707	was in front of a mud house
82.003	in upper Sindh of Pakistan,
84.626	where my father held the hand
84.626	of my 14-year-old mother
87.482	and they decided
87.482	to walk out of the village
89.502	to go to a town where they could
89.502	send their kids to school.
92.962	In a way, I feel like my life
95.168	is kind of a result of some wise choices
95.168	and decisions they've made.
100.903	And just like that,
100.903	another of their decisions
103.759	was to keep me and my siblings
103.759	connected to our roots.
106.986	While we were living in a community
106.986	I fondly remember as called Ribabad,
111.235	which means community of the poor,
113.464	my dad made sure that we also
113.464	had a house in our rural homeland.
117.156	I come from an indigenous tribe
117.156	in the mountains of Balochistan
120.78	called Brahui.
122.52	Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller,
122.52	and it is also my language.
127.688	Thanks to my father's very strict rules
127.688	about connecting to our customs,
131.924	I had to live a beautiful life of songs, 
131.924	cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,
137.655	and a lot of sheep.
139.696	But then, living in two extremes
142.365	between the traditions 
142.365	of my culture, of my village,
146.394	and then modern education
146.394	in my school wasn't easy.
149.745	I was aware that I was the only girl
149.745	who got to have such freedom,
154.249	and I was guilty of it.
156.293	While going to school
156.293	in Karachi and Hyderabad,
160.255	a lot of my cousins and childhood friends
160.255	were getting married off,
164.196	some to older men, some in exchange,
166.95	some even as second wives.
169.249	I got to see the beautiful tradition
169.249	and its magic fade in front of me
174.558	when I saw that the birth of a girl child
174.558	was celebrated with sadness,
179.892	when women were told
179.892	to have patience as their main virtue.
184.659	Up until I was 16,
186.64	I healed my sadness by crying,
189.448	mostly at nights 
189.448	when everyone would sleep
191.634	and I would sob in my pillow,
193.95	until that one night 
193.95	when I found out my friend was killed
197.297	in the name of honor.
200.381	Honor killings is a custom
203.218	where men and women
203.218	are suspected of having relationships
206.116	before or outside of the marriage,
207.811	and they're killed by their family for it.
209.99	Usually the killer is the brother
209.99	or father or the uncle in the family.
214.375	The U.N. reports there are about 1,000
214.375	honor murders every year in Pakistan,
219.007	and these are only the reported cases.
221.445	A custom that kills
221.445	did not make any sense to me,
225.183	and I knew I had to do
225.183	something about it this time.
227.761	I was not going to cry myself to sleep.
230.152	I was going to do something,
230.152	anything, to stop it.
232.66	I was 16 -- I started writing poetry
234.726	and going door to door
234.726	telling everybody about honor killings
237.954	and why it happens,
237.954	why it should be stopped,
240.149	and raising awareness about it
241.585	until I actually found a much, much 
241.585	better way to handle this issue.
246.841	In those days, we were living in
246.841	a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.
253.002	Every year, during the monsoon seasons,
253.002	our house would flood up with water --
257.529	rainwater and sewage --
259.241	and my mom and dad
259.241	would be taking the water out.
262.368	In those days, my dad brought home
262.368	a huge machine, a computer.
267.467	It was so big it looked as if it was going
267.467	to take up half of the only room we had,
272.364	and had so many pieces and wires
272.364	that needed to be connected.
275.864	But it was still the most exciting thing
277.954	that has ever happened
277.954	to me and my sisters.
280.74	My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge
280.74	of taking care of the computer,
284.85	and all of us were given
288.785	Being the oldest of eight kids,
291.85	I got to use it the last,
294.335	and that was after
294.335	I had washed the dishes,
297.074	cleaned the house,
297.074	made dinner with my mom,
299.837	and put blankets on the floor
299.837	for everyone to sleep,
302.529	and after that, 
302.529	I would run to the computer,
304.712	connect it to the Internet,
306.269	and have pure joy and wonder
306.269	for 10 to 15 minutes.
312.288	In those days, I had discovered
312.288	a website called Joogle.
316.694	[Google] (Laughter)
319.76	In my frantic wish
319.76	to do something about this custom,
323.474	I made use of Google
323.474	and discovered Facebook,
326.982	a website where people can connect
326.982	to anyone around the world,
331.137	and so, from my very tiny,
331.137	cement-roofed room in Karachi,
335.618	I connected with people in the U.K.,
335.618	the U.S., Australia and Canada,
338.828	and created a campaign called
341.335	WAKE UP Campaign
341.335	against Honor Killings.
344.228	It became enormous
344.228	in just a few months.
347.299	I got a lot of support
347.299	from all around the world.
349.851	Media was connecting to us.
351.312	A lot of people were reaching out
351.312	trying to raise awareness with us.
354.611	It became so big that it went from online
354.611	to the streets of my hometown,
359.353	where we would do rallies and strikes
361.697	trying to change the policies 
361.697	in Pakistan for women's support.
365.169	And while I thought
365.169	everything was perfect,
368.891	my team -- which was basically
368.891	my friends and neighbors at that time --
372.768	thought everything was going so well,
374.858	we had no idea a big opposition
374.858	was coming to us.
380.039	My community stood up against us,
382.174	saying we were spreading
382.174	un-Islamic behavior.
385.891	We were challenging centuries-old
385.891	customs in those communities.
390.601	I remember my father receiving
390.601	anonymous letters
393.679	"saying, ""Your daughter "
393.679	is spreading Western culture
396.615	"in the honorable societies."""
398.341	Our car was stoned at one point.
400.887	One day I went to the office
400.887	and found our metal signboard
404.787	wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people
404.787	had been hitting it with something heavy.
409.589	Things got so bad that I had
409.589	to hide myself in many ways.
413.216	I would put up the windows of the car,
416.293	veil my face, not speak
416.293	while I was in public,
420.225	but eventually situations got worse
420.225	when my life was threatened,
424.202	and I had to leave, back to Karachi,
424.202	and our actions stopped.
429.962	Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,
433.335	I thought this was the biggest
433.335	failure of my entire life.
438.101	I was devastated.
440.011	As a teenager, I was blaming
440.011	myself for everything that happened.
443.656	And it turns out,
443.656	when we started reflecting,
445.792	we did realize that it was actually
445.792	me and my team's fault.
451.666	There were two big reasons
451.666	why our campaign had failed big time.
456.821	One of those, the first reason,
459.071	is we were standing
459.071	against core values of people.
462.9	We were saying no to something
462.9	that was very important to them,
466.412	challenging their code of honor,
468.759	and hurting them deeply in the process.
471.026	And number two, which was very
471.026	important for me to learn,
473.725	and amazing, and surprising
473.725	for me to learn,
475.93	was that we were not including
475.93	the true heroes
479.111	who should be fighting for themselves.
481.317	The women in the villages had no idea
481.317	we were fighting for them in the streets.
485.274	Every time I would go back,
486.711	I would find my cousins and friends
486.711	with scarves on their faces,
489.718	"and I would ask, ""What happened?"""
491.512	And they'd be like, 
491.512	"""Our husbands beat us."""
493.902	But we are working in the streets for you!
496.781	We are changing the policies.
498.383	How is that not impacting their life?
501.355	So then we found out something
501.355	which was very amazing for us.
506.206	The policies of a country
508.856	do not necessarily always affect
508.856	the tribal and rural communities.
513.467	It was devastating -- like, oh,
513.467	we can't actually do something about this?
517.771	And we found out there's a huge gap
520.813	when it comes to official policies
520.813	and the real truth on the ground.
524.649	So this time, we were like,
524.649	we are going to do something different.
527.961	We are going to use strategy,
529.71	and we are going to go back and apologize.
532.699	Yes, apologize.
534.35	We went back to the communities
535.863	and we said we are 
535.863	very ashamed of what we did.
539.111	We are here to apologize, and in fact,
539.111	we are here to make it up to you.
543.681	How do we do that?
545.251	We are going to promote
545.251	three of your main cultures.
548.217	We know that it's music,
548.217	language, and embroidery.
551.799	Nobody believed us.
553.325	Nobody wanted to work with us.
556.063	It took a lot of convincing
556.063	and discussions with these communities
559.618	until they agreed that we are going
559.618	to promote their language
563.31	by making a booklet of their stories,
563.31	fables and old tales in the tribe,
567.972	and we would promote their music
570.544	by making a CD of the songs
570.544	from the tribe, and some drumbeating.
576.055	And the third, which was my favorite,
578.216	was we would promote their embroidery
578.216	by making a center in the village
582.227	where women would come every day
582.227	to make embroidery.
586.064	And so it began.
588.038	We worked with one village,
588.038	and we started our first center.
592.77	It was a beautiful day.
594.268	We started the center.
595.372	Women were coming to make embroidery,
597.441	and going through a life-changing
597.441	process of education,
601.185	learning about their rights,
601.185	what Islam says about their rights,
604.235	and enterprise development,
604.235	how they can create money,
607.054	and then how they can create
607.054	money from money,
609.306	how they can fight the customs
609.306	that have been destroying their lives
613.184	from so many centuries,
614.902	because in Islam, in reality,
616.758	women are supposed to be
616.758	shoulder to shoulder with men.
620.373	Women have so much status
620.373	that we have not been hearing,
624.125	that they have not been hearing,
625.938	and we needed to tell them
625.938	that they need to know
628.956	where their rights are
628.956	and how to take them by themselves,
631.696	because they can do it and we can't.
634.021	So this was the model which actually
634.021	came out -- very amazing.
636.993	Through embroidery
636.993	we were promoting their traditions.
639.526	We went into the village.
639.526	We would mobilize the community.
642.237	We would make a center inside
642.237	where 30 women will come
645.257	for six months to learn about
645.257	value addition of traditional embroidery,
649.365	enterprise development,
649.365	life skills and basic education,
653.104	and about their rights
653.104	and how to say no to those customs
656.215	and how to stand as leaders
656.215	for themselves and the society.
659.886	After six months, we would connect
659.886	these women to loans and to markets
664.698	where they can become
664.698	local entrepreneurs in their communities.
668.608	We soon called this project Sughar.
671.865	Sughar is a local word used
671.865	in many, many languages in Pakistan.
675.905	It means skilled and confident women.
679.341	I truly believe, to create women leaders,
679.341	there's only one thing you have to do:
684.449	Just let them know that they have
684.449	what it takes to be a leader.
688.631	These women you see here,
690.13	they have strong skills
690.13	and potential to be leaders.
694.573	All we had to do was remove
694.573	the barriers that surrounded them,
697.615	and that's what we decided to do.
700.154	But then while we were thinking
700.154	everything was going well,
703.443	once again everything was fantastic,
706.043	we found our next setback:
708.11	A lot of men started seeing
708.11	the visible changes in their wife.
711.279	She's speaking more,
711.279	she's making decisions --
713.42	oh my gosh, she's handling 
713.42	everything in the house.
716.109	They stopped them
716.109	from coming to the centers,
720.578	and this time, we were like,
720.578	okay, time for strategy two.
724.622	We went to the fashion 
724.622	industry in Pakistan
726.71	and decided to do research
726.71	about what happens there.
730.493	Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan
730.493	is very strong and growing day by day,
735.48	but there is less contribution
735.48	from the tribal areas
739.046	and to the tribal areas, especially women.
742.121	So we decided to launch our first ever
742.121	tribal women's very own fashion brand,
746.555	which is now called Nomads.
750.085	And so women started earning more,
752.267	they started contributing more
752.267	financially to the house,
755.073	and men had to think again
755.073	before saying no to them
758.304	when they were coming to the centers.
763.343	(Applause)
766.106	Thank you, thank you.
768.265	In 2013, we launched our first
768.265	Sughar Hub instead of a center.
773.442	We partnered with TripAdvisor
775.602	and created a cement hall
775.602	in the middle of a village
779.514	and invited so many other organizations
779.514	to work over there.
783.752	We created this platform
783.752	for the nonprofits
785.847	so they can touch and work
785.847	on the other issues
788.17	that Sughar is not working on,
790.395	which would be an easy place 
790.395	for them to give trainings,
794.259	use it as a farmer school,
794.259	even as a marketplace,
796.874	and anything they want to use it for,
799.146	and they have been doing really amazingly.
801.259	And so far, we have been able
801.259	to support 900 women
804.789	in 24 villages around Pakistan.
808.039	(Applause)
813.624	But that's actually not what I want.
818.758	My dream is to reach out
818.758	to one million women in the next 10 years,
823.41	and to make sure that happens,
825.059	this year we launched
825.059	Sughar Foundation in the U.S.
828.047	It is not just going to fund Sughar
828.047	but many other organizations in Pakistan
832.811	to replicate the idea
835.02	and to find even more innovative ways
837.76	to unleash the rural women's
837.76	potential in Pakistan.
841.591	Thank you so much.
843.564	(Applause)
846.606	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
851.056	Chris Anderson: Khalida, you are
851.056	quite the force of nature.
854.359	I mean, this story, in many ways,
854.359	just seems beyond belief.
858.982	It's incredible that someone
858.982	so young could do achieve this much
863.042	through so much force and ingenuity.
865.9	So I guess one question:
867.47	This is a spectacular dream to reach out
867.47	and empower a million women --
872.181	how much of the current 
872.181	success depends on you,
875.975	the force of this magnetic personality?
880.218	How does it scale?
882.858	Khalida Brohi: I think my job
882.858	is to give the inspiration out,
887.344	give my dream out.
889.065	I can't teach how to do it, because
889.065	there are so many different ways.
892.487	We have been experimenting
892.487	with three ways only.
894.792	There are a hundred different ways
894.792	to unleash potential in women.
898.385	I would just give the inspiration
898.385	and that's my job.
901.033	I will keep doing it.
901.033	Sughar will still be growing.
903.507	We are planning to reach out
903.507	to two more villages,
906.595	and soon I believe 
906.595	we will be scaling out of Pakistan
909.575	into South Asia and beyond.
912.361	CA: I love that when you talked
912.361	about your team in the talk,
915.914	I mean, you were all 18 at the time.
918.096	What did this team look like?
919.861	This was school friends, right?
921.509	KB: Do people here
921.509	believe that I'm at an age
926.478	where I'm supposed
926.478	to be a grandmother in my village?
929.522	My mom was married at nine,
929.522	and I am the oldest woman not married
935.412	and not doing anything
935.412	in my life in my village.
938.988	CA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?
942.285	KB: No.
942.285	CA: You're right.
944.653	KB: People feel sorry for me,
944.653	a lot of times.
947.556	CA: But how much time are you spending
947.556	now actually back in Balochistan?
951.48	KB: I live over there.
953.367	We live between, still,
953.367	Karachi and Balochistan.
956.199	My siblings are all going to school.
958.983	I am still the oldest of eight siblings.
961.424	CA: But what you're doing is definitely
961.424	threatening to some people there.
965.784	How do you handle safety?
965.784	Do you feel safe?
970.14	Are there issues there?
972.265	KB: This question has come to me
972.265	a lot of times before,
976.075	"and I feel like the word ""fear"""
976.075	just comes to me and then drops,
982.39	but there is one fear that I have
982.39	that is different from that.
986.12	The fear is that if I get killed,
986.12	what would happen to the people
989.623	who love me so much?
991.608	My mom waits for me till late at night
991.608	that I should come home.
995.84	My sisters want to learn so much from me,
998.585	and there are many, many girls
998.585	in my community who want to talk to me
1001.846	and ask me different things,
1004.119	and I recently got engaged. (Laughs)
1006.91	(Applause)
1009.324	CA: Is he here? You've got to stand up.
1012.552	(Applause)
1020.098	KB: Escaping arranged marriages,
1020.098	I chose my own husband
1023.72	across the world in L.A.,
1023.72	a really different world.
1028.178	I had to fight for a whole year.
1028.178	That's totally a different story.
1031.444	But I think that's
1031.444	the only thing that I'm afraid of,
1036.189	and I don't want my mom to not see anyone
1036.189	when she waits in the night.
1041.933	CA: So people who want
1041.933	to help you on their way,
1044.404	they can go on, they can maybe
1044.404	buy some of these clothes
1047.077	that you're bringing over
1049.649	that are actually made, the embroidery
1049.649	is done back in Balochistan?
1053.161	KB: Yeah.
1054.369	CA: Or they can get involved
1054.369	in the foundation.
1056.573	KB: Definitely. We are looking
1056.573	for as many people as we can,
1059.419	because now that the foundation's
1059.419	in the beginning process,
1063.117	I am trying to learn a lot
1063.117	about how to operate,
1065.708	how to get funding
1065.708	or reach out to more organizations,
1070.087	and especially in the e-commerce,
1070.087	which is very new for me.
1073.245	I mean, I am not
1073.245	a fashion person, believe me.
1075.632	CA: Well, it's been incredible
1075.632	to have you here.
1078.929	Please go on being courageous,
1078.929	go on being smart, and please stay safe.
1083.944	KB: Thank you so much.
1083.944	CA: Thank you, Khalida. (Applause)
