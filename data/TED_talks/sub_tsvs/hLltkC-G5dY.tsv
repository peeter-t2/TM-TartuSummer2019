12.801	(Music)
16.72	Roughly 43,000 years ago,
19.44	a young cave bear
19.44	died in the rolling hills
22.44	on the northwest border
22.44	of modern day Slovenia.
25.84	A thousand years later,
25.84	a mammoth died in southern Germany.
29.96	A few centuries after that,
29.96	a griffon vulture also died
33.28	in the same vicinity.
35.28	And we know almost nothing
35.28	about how these animals met their deaths,
39.44	but these different creatures
39.44	dispersed across both time and space
43.52	did share one remarkable fate.
46.72	After their deaths,
46.72	a bone from each of their skeletons
50.2	was crafted by human hands
52.92	into a flute.
54.92	Think about that for a second.
56.4	Imagine you're a caveman,
59.08	You've mastered fire.
60.76	You've built simple tools for hunting.
62.84	You've learned how to craft
62.84	garments from animal skins
65.48	to keep yourself warm in the winter.
67.56	What would you choose to invent next?
70.32	It seems preposterous
70.32	that you would invent the flute,
73.48	a tool that created
73.48	useless vibrations in air molecules.
77.319	But that is exactly
77.319	what our ancestors did.
81.2	Now this turns out
81.2	to be surprisingly common
84.64	in the history of innovation.
86.28	Sometimes people invent things
88.24	because they want to stay alive
88.24	or feed their children
91.2	or conquer the village next door.
93.36	But just as often,
94.8	new ideas come into the world
96.72	simply because they're fun.
99.52	And here's the really strange thing:
101.96	many of those playful
101.96	but seemingly frivolous inventions
105.24	ended up sparking
105.24	momentous transformations
107.88	in science, in politics and society.
111	Take what may be the most
111	important invention of modern times:
114.96	programmable computers.
116.72	Now, the standard story is that computers
116.72	descend from military technology,
121.36	since many of the early computers
121.36	were designed specifically
124.24	to crack wartime codes
124.24	or calculate rocket trajectories.
127.72	But in fact, the origins
127.72	of the modern computer
131.24	are much more playful,
132.92	even musical,
134.24	than you might imagine.
135.52	The idea behind the flute,
136.8	of just pushing air through tubes
136.8	to make a sound,
139.92	was eventually modified
139.92	to create the first organ
142.84	more than 2,000 years ago.
144.6	Someone came up with the brilliant idea
144.6	of triggering sounds
147.92	by pressing small levers with our fingers,
150.84	inventing the first musical keyboard.
153.24	Now, keyboards evolved
153.24	from organs to clavichords to harpsichords
157.4	to the piano,
158.76	until the middle of the 19th century,
161.44	when a bunch of inventors
161.44	finally hit on the idea
164.24	of using a keyboard
164.24	to trigger not sounds but letters.
168.16	In fact, the very first typewriter
170.48	was originally called
170.48	"""the writing harpsichord."""
175.44	Flutes and music led
175.44	to even more powerful breakthroughs.
179.28	About a thousand years ago,
181.04	at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,
183.28	three brothers in Baghdad
183.28	designed a device
185.64	that was an automated organ.
188.16	"They called it ""the instrument"
188.16	"that plays itself."""
191.96	Now, the instrument
191.96	was basically a giant music box.
195.12	The organ could be trained to play
195.12	various songs by using instructions
199.48	encoded by placing pins
199.48	on a rotating cylinder.
203.44	And if you wanted the machine
203.44	to play a different song,
206.08	you just swapped a new cylinder in
206.08	with a different code on it.
209.84	This instrument was the first of its kind.
213.24	It was programmable.
215	Now, conceptually,
215	this was a massive leap forward.
218.08	The whole idea of hardware and software
221.52	becomes thinkable for the first time
221.52	with this invention.
224.76	And that incredibly powerful concept
227.24	didn't come to us as an instrument
227.24	of war or of conquest,
230.44	or necessity at all.
232.16	It came from the strange delight
232.16	of watching a machine play music.
237.32	In fact, the idea of programmable machines
240.56	was exclusively kept alive by music
240.56	for about 700 years.
245.24	In the 1700s, music-making machines
247.76	became the playthings
247.76	of the Parisian elite.
251.36	Showmen used the same coded cylinders
254.56	to control the physical movements
254.56	of what were called automata,
258.52	an early kind of robot.
260.56	One of the most famous of those robots
262.52	was, you guessed it,
262.52	an automated flute player
265.92	designed by a brilliant French inventor
267.84	named Jacques de Vaucanson.
270.279	And as de Vaucanson
270.279	was designing his robot musician,
273.8	he had another idea.
275.76	If you could program a machine
275.76	to make pleasing sounds,
279.76	why not program it to weave
279.76	delightful patterns of color out of cloth?
284.92	Instead of using the pins of the cylinder
284.92	to represent musical notes,
289.2	they would represent
289.2	threads with different colors.
292.32	If you wanted a new pattern
292.32	for your fabric,
294.84	you just programmed a new cylinder.
297.2	This was the first programmable loom.
300.56	Now, the cylinders were too expensive
300.56	and time-consuming to make,
304.76	but a half century later,
306.32	another French inventor named Jacquard
308.96	hit upon the brilliant idea
308.96	of using paper-punched cards
313.68	instead of metal cylinders.
315.48	Paper turned out to be
315.48	much cheaper and more flexible
318.56	as a way of programming the device.
320.72	That punch card system inspired
320.72	Victorian inventor Charles Babbage
325.2	to create his analytical engine,
327.72	the first true programmable computer
330.36	ever designed.
331.72	And punch cards were used
331.72	by computer programmers
334.44	as late as the 1970s.
337.16	So ask yourself this question:
339.8	what really made
339.8	the modern computer possible?
343.32	Yes, the military involvement
343.32	is an important part of the story,
347.36	but inventing a computer
347.36	also required other building blocks:
351.12	music boxes,
352.36	toy robot flute players,
354.4	harpsichord keyboards,
355.92	colorful patterns woven into fabric,
358.52	and that's just a small part of the story.
361.36	There's a long list of world-changing
361.36	ideas and technologies
364.36	that came out of play:
366.08	public museums, rubber,
368.08	probability theory, the insurance business
370.44	and many more.
371.68	Necessity isn't always
371.68	the mother of invention.
375.08	The playful state of mind
375.08	is fundamentally exploratory,
379.28	seeking out new possibilities
379.28	in the world around us.
382.92	And that seeking
382.92	is why so many experiences
386.44	that started with simple
386.44	delight and amusement
389.48	eventually led us
389.48	to profound breakthroughs.
393.04	Now, I think this has implications
393.04	for how we teach kids in school
397.28	and how we encourage innovation
397.28	in our workspaces,
400.52	but thinking about play
400.52	and delight this way
403.6	also helps us detect what's coming next.
407.16	Think about it: if you were
407.16	sitting there in 1750
409.56	trying to figure out
409.56	the big changes coming to society
413.12	in the 19th, the 20th centuries,
415.04	automated machines, computers,
417.12	artificial intelligence,
419.08	a programmable flute
420.92	entertaining the Parisian elite
423.12	would have been as powerful a clue
423.12	as anything else at the time.
427.84	It seemed like an amusement at best,
430.4	not useful in any serious way,
433.16	but it turned out to be
433.16	the beginning of a tech revolution
437.04	that would change the world.
438.92	You'll find the future
440.8	wherever people are having the most fun.
