12.92	I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,
17.126	a small and very beautiful country
19.371	in West Africa,
21.076	a country rich both in physical resources
23.98	and creative talent.
26.312	However, Sierra Leone is infamous
28.274	for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s
30.688	when entire villages were burnt down.
33.778	An estimated 8,000 men, women and children
37.99	had their arms and legs amputated during this time.
42.256	As my family and I ran for safety
45.24	when I was about 12 from one of those attacks,
47.932	I resolved that I would do everything I could
51.364	to ensure that my own children
53.644	would not go through the 
53.644	same experiences we had.
57.03	They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone
59.644	where war and amputation
62.132	were no longer a strategy for gaining power.
66.838	As I watched people who I knew, loved ones,
70.571	recover from this devastation,
72.462	one thing that deeply troubled me
75.126	was that many of the amputees in the country
77.63	would not use their prostheses.
79.686	The reason, I would come to find out,
81.642	was that their prosthetic sockets
83.977	were painful because they did not fit well.
89.437	The prosthetic socket is the part
91.623	in which the amputee inserts their residual limb,
95.019	and which connects to the prosthetic ankle.
97.299	Even in the developed world,
99.037	it takes a period of three weeks to often years
102.529	for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.
106.791	Prosthetists still use conventional processes
109.673	like molding and casting
112.029	to create single-material prosthetic sockets.
115.747	Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts
118.535	of pressure on the limbs of the patient,
121.363	leaving them with pressure sores and blisters.
125.663	It does not matter
127.775	how powerful your prosthetic ankle is.
130.997	If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,
133.693	you will not use your leg,
135.265	and that is just simply unacceptable in our age.
139.145	So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr
141.565	about two and a half years ago,
143.09	and he asked me if I knew 
143.09	how to solve this problem,
145.577	"I said, ""No, not yet,"
147.677	"but I would love to figure it out."""
150.287	And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,
153.577	I designed custom prosthetic sockets
156.47	quickly and cheaply
159.377	that are more comfortable
161.232	than conventional prostheses.
164.229	I used magnetic resonance imaging
166.471	to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,
170.36	then use finite element modeling to better predict
173.464	the internal stresses and strains
175.407	on the normal forces,
177.405	and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.
182.018	We use a 3D printer to create
185.432	a multi-material prosthetic socket
189.248	which relieves pressure where needed
191.714	on the anatomy of the patient.
195.246	In short, we're using data
198.177	to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.
201.976	In a recent trial we just wrapped up
203.772	at the Media Lab,
205.534	one of our patients, a U.S. veteran
208.044	who has been an amputee for about 20 years
210.97	and worn dozens of legs,
214.052	said of one of our printed parts,
218.14	"""It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,"
221.544	"and it's effing sexy."""
224.48	(Laughter)
228.198	Disability in our age
231.474	should not prevent anyone
233.107	from living meaningful lives.
235.97	My hope and desire is that the tools and processes
239.313	we develop in our research group
241.311	can be used to bring highly functional prostheses
244.249	to those who need them.
246.54	For me, a place to begin healing the souls
251.991	of those affected by war and disease
255.88	is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces
259.629	for their bodies.
261.585	Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,
264.813	I hope this not only restores
268.419	but indeed transforms their
268.419	sense of human potential.
271.68	Thank you very much.
274.591	(Applause)
