15.992	So here's the good news about families.
18.879	The last 50 years have seen a revolution
21.128	in what it means to be a family.
23.184	We have blended families, adopted families,
25.479	we have nuclear families living in separate houses
27.784	and divorced families living in the same house.
30.663	But through it all, the family has grown stronger.
33.722	Eight in 10 say the family they have today
36.271	is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.
40.808	Now, here's the bad news.
42.792	Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed
45.19	by the chaos of family life.
47.501	Every parent I know, myself included,
49.559	feels like we're constantly playing defense.
52.155	Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.
55.208	Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,
57.248	they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.
60.448	And here's the worst news of all.
63.138	Our children sense we're out of control.
66.064	Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute
69.129	"asked 1,000 children, ""If you were granted"
71.408	"one wish about your parents, what would it be?"""
74.841	The parents predicted the kids would say,
77.159	spending more time with them.
80.025	They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?
82.87	That their parents be less tired and less stressed.
87.216	So how can we change this dynamic?
89.317	Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,
92.535	draw our family closer,
94.401	and generally prepare our children to enter the world?
99.257	I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,
102.453	traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,
105.478	experts ranging from elite peace negotiators
108.536	to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.
112.583	I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right
115.949	and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?
120.935	I want to tell you about one family that I met,
122.8	and why I think they offer clues.
125.424	At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,
128.411	where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down
130.719	to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.
133.957	The Starrs are a regular American family
136.182	with their share of regular American family problems.
138.933	David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care
141.725	of their four children, ages 10 to 15.
144.517	One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.
147.541	One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
150.046	One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.
153.557	"""We were living in complete chaos,"" Eleanor said."
156.885	What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
160.229	Instead of turning to friends or relatives,
162.997	they looked to David's workplace.
165.709	They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development
168.487	that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan
171.557	to startups in Silicon Valley.
174.533	In agile, workers are organized into small groups
177.401	and do things in very short spans of time.
180.087	So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,
183.029	the team in effect manages itself.
186.229	You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.
188.86	You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.
192.477	David said when they brought this system into their home,
195.677	the family meetings in particular increased communication,
199.093	decreased stress, and made everybody
201.469	happier to be part of the family team.
204.573	When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques
207.556	into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,
211.069	it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
215.133	And these meetings had this effect
217.322	while taking under 20 minutes.
219.821	So what is Agile, and why can it help
221.973	with something that seems so different, like families?
224.701	In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist
227.05	at a financial firm in New England.
229.367	He was very frustrated with how software got designed.
232.385	Companies followed the waterfall method, right,
235.137	in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down
238.195	to programmers below,
239.814	and no one had ever consulted the programmers.
242.462	Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
245.041	They were too bloated or too out of date
247.438	by the time they were done.
250.12	Sutherland wanted to create a system where
252.564	ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom
256.742	and be adjusted in real time.
259.287	He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review
262.35	before stumbling upon an article in 1986
265.142	"called ""The New New Product Development Game."""
268.221	It said that the pace of business was quickening --
270.472	and by the way, this was in 1986 --
272.601	and the most successful companies were flexible.
276.566	It highlighted Toyota and Canon
278.35	and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.
282.654	As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,
285.019	"and said, ""That's it."""
287.184	In Sutherland's system, companies don't use
289.901	large, massive projects that take two years.
292.902	They do things in small chunks.
294.13	Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
296.579	"So instead of saying, ""You guys go off into that bunker"
298.645	"and come back with a cell phone or a social network,"""
301.646	"you say, ""You go off and come up with one element,"
304.078	"then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."""
306.598	You succeed or fail quickly.
310.206	Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,
313.374	and it's sweeping into management suites.
316.312	Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques
318.822	and applying it to their families.
321.097	You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.
323.67	Even the Sutherlands told me that they had
325.566	an Agile Thanksgiving,
327.076	where you had one group of people working on the food,
329.587	one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.
332.918	Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.
336.438	So let's take one problem that families face,
339.118	crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.
342.135	A key plank is accountability,
344.301	so teams use information radiators,
346.1	these large boards in which everybody is accountable.
349.863	So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,
351.799	created a morning checklist
353.46	in which each child is expected to tick off chores.
357.048	So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,
359.428	poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,
362.138	and she sat there,
363.646	kind of amiably talking to each of her children
366.644	as one after the other they came downstairs,
368.635	checked the list, made themselves breakfast,
371.004	checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,
373.787	rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,
376.907	checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,
379.331	and made their way to the bus.
381.968	It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.
386.045	And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,
389.187	our kids needed way too much monitoring,
391.37	Eleanor looked at me.
392.67	"""That's what I thought,"" she said."
393.838	"""I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'"
396.158	"But I was wrong."""
397.779	"So I turned to David: ""So why does it work?"""
399.883	"He said, ""You can't underestimate the power of doing this."""
402.819	And he made a checkmark.
404.353	"He said, ""In the workplace, adults love it."
406.489	"With kids, it's heaven."""
408.965	The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,
411.802	it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)
415.949	But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.
419.034	So following the agile model, we ask three questions:
422.355	What worked well in our family this week,
424.277	what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?
428.437	Everyone throws out suggestions
430.024	and then we pick two to focus on.
432.756	And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.
436.658	What worked well this week?
438.778	Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.
441.698	What didn't work well? Our math sheets,
444.61	or greeting visitors at the door.
447.797	Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.
451.225	Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,
453.77	I mean at least not that are revealing.
455.304	This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.
459.067	But the most surprising part was when we turned to,
460.854	what are we going to work on in the week ahead?
463.508	You know, the key idea of agile is that
465.525	teams essentially manage themselves,
467.33	and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.
470.674	Our kids love this process.
472.365	So they would come up with all these ideas.
474.554	You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,
476.6	get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.
479.163	Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.
481.975	It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.
484.142	We constantly have to kind of dial them back.
487.087	Now look, naturally there's a gap between
489.079	their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,
492.447	but the truth is it didn't really bother us.
494.561	It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables
496.911	that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.
500.241	Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --
502.671	We're still holding these meetings.
505.108	My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.
509.84	So what did we learn?
512.223	"The word ""agile"" entered the lexicon in 2001"
514.724	when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers
516.924	met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.
521.056	I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.
524.587	I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.
527.962	I'm proposing three planks.
530.721	Plank number one: Adapt all the time.
534.289	When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
536.075	We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
539.174	That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.
542.823	We can't. What's great about the agile system
546.257	is you build in a system of change
548.123	so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.
551.154	It's like they say in the Internet world:
552.598	if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,
555.342	you're doing the wrong thing.
557	Parents can learn a lot from that.
559.908	"But to me, ""adapt all the time"" means something deeper, too."
563.22	We have to break parents out of this straitjacket
565.596	that the only ideas we can try at home
567.933	are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus
571.3	or other family experts.
573.62	The truth is, their ideas are stale,
575.892	whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas
578.188	to make groups and teams work effectively.
581.513	Let's just take a few examples.
582.648	Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.
585.868	Everybody knows that having family dinner
587.925	with your children is good for the kids.
590.253	But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.
593.212	I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,
595.484	"""No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner."
597.863	I'm not home, can't make family dinner?
599.999	We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.
602.991	"We'll make Sunday meals more important."""
605.857	And the truth is, recent research backs him up.
609.407	It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time
612.319	in any family meal.
614.156	"The rest of it's taken up with ""take your elbows off the table"" and ""pass the ketchup."""
618.074	You can take that 10 minutes and move it
620.111	to any part of the day and have the same benefit.
623.391	So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.
626.216	An environmental psychologist told me,
628.506	"""If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,"
631.841	you'll be more rigid.
633.291	"If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."""
637.194	"She told me, ""When you're discipling your children,"
638.801	sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.
641.199	"The conversation will go better."""
643.753	My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations
647.37	because I was sitting above in the power position.
650.19	So move where you sit. That's adaptability.
653.23	The point is there are all these new ideas out there.
656.584	We've got to hook them up with parents.
658.971	So plank number one: Adapt all the time.
661.398	Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.
665.838	Plank number two: Empower your children.
669.934	Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.
672.948	It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
675.542	There's a reason that few systems have been more
677.605	waterfall over time than the family.
680.657	But the single biggest lesson we learned
682.474	is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.
685.361	Enlist the children in their own upbringing.
689.226	Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,
691.114	and we had voted to work on overreacting.
693.993	"So we said, ""Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"""
697.289	So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.
701.865	So we kind of liked that.
703.623	But then her sister started working the system.
705.262	"She said, ""Do I get one five-minute overreaction"
708.399	"or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"""
711.869	I loved that. Spend the time however you want.
714.097	Now give us a punishment. Okay.
716.369	If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.
721.273	Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.
724.697	So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.
728.081	There's plenty of parental authority going on.
730.809	But we're giving them practice becoming independent,
733.524	which of course is our ultimate goal.
736.091	Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,
738.409	one of my daughters started screaming.
740.233	"The other one said, ""Overreaction! Overreaction!"""
742.748	and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.
745.677	To me that is a certified agile miracle.
749.186	(Laughter) (Applause)
751.393	And by the way, research backs this up too.
756.129	Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,
759.705	evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex
763.63	and take more control over their lives.
767.857	The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,
771.009	and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.
774.113	I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,
775.861	and he was chiding me for not letting my children
778.103	make mistakes with their allowance.
780.772	"And I said, ""But what if they drive into a ditch?"""
782.748	"He said, ""It's much better to drive into a ditch"
784.889	with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary
788.321	"or a $6 million inheritance."""
790.993	So the bottom line is, empower your children.
793.473	Plank number three: Tell your story.
798.259	Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
802.222	"Jim Collins, the author of ""Good To Great,"""
804.162	told me that successful human organizations of any kind
806.865	have two things in common:
808.379	they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.
811.674	So agile is great for stimulating progress,
813.879	but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.
817.161	So how do you do that?
819.215	Collins coached us on doing something
821.422	that businesses do, which is define your mission
824.209	and identify your core values.
826.603	So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.
830.161	We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.
832.425	We had a pajama party.
834.729	I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.
838.289	My wife bought a flip chart.
839.161	And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?
841.778	What values do we most uphold?
843.903	And we ended up with 10 statements.
845.659	We are travelers, not tourists.
847.63	We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
851.305	Again, research shows that parents should spend less time
854.536	worrying about what they do wrong
856.875	and more time focusing on what they do right,
860.032	worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.
864.143	This family mission statement is a great way to identify
866.879	what it is that you do right.
869.399	A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
871.689	One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
873.677	And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?
876.033	And we didn't really know what to do,
877.287	so we called her into my office.
878.715	The family mission statement was on the wall,
880.372	"and my wife said, ""So, anything up there seem to apply?"""
883.483	And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,
886.359	"""Bring people together?"""
888.087	Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.
891.543	Another great way to tell your story
892.875	is to tell your children where they came from.
896.17	Researchers at Emory gave children a simple
898.871	"""what do you know"" test."
900.953	Do you know where your grandparents were born?
903.031	Do you know where your parents went to high school?
905.495	Do you know anybody in your family
907.28	who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?
911.279	"The children who scored highest on this ""do you know"" scale"
914.849	had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.
919.415	"The ""do you know"" test was the single biggest predictor"
922.671	of emotional health and happiness.
925.375	As the author of the study told me,
927.551	children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative
931.405	have greater self-confidence.
934.359	So my final plank is, tell your story.
937.335	Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments
941.326	and how you overcame the negative ones.
944.167	If you give children this happy narrative,
946.623	you give them the tools to make themselves happier.
952.334	"I was a teenager when I first read ""Anna Karenina"""
954.757	and its famous opening sentence,
956.509	"""All happy families are alike."
958.468	"Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."""
962.559	"When I first read that, I thought, ""That sentence is inane."
965.783	"Of course all happy families aren't alike."""
968.906	But as I began working on this project,
971.247	I began changing my mind.
973.959	Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,
976.511	to identify the building blocks
979.247	that successful families have.
982.223	I've mentioned just three here today:
984.367	Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.
989.549	Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?
993.92	The answer, I believe, is yes.
997.296	When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,
1000.008	his brother Nikolay came to him
1001.75	and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness
1004.724	on a little green stick, which he had hidden
1007.504	in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
1010.62	If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
1015.053	Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
1020.549	In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
1024.9	He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
1029.445	That story perfectly captures for me
1031.996	the final lesson that I learned:
1034.204	Happiness is not something we find,
1036.868	it's something we make.
1039.764	Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations
1043.034	has come to pretty much the same conclusion.
1046.015	Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
1048.404	It's a matter of choice.
1051.268	You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.
1054.732	You just need to take small steps,
1056.916	accumulate small wins,
1059.108	keep reaching for that green stick.
1061.932	In the end, this may be the greatest lesson of all.
1065.581	What's the secret to a happy family? Try.
1069.748	(Applause)
