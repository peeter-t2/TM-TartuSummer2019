12.645	So in college,
15.349	I was a government major,
16.937	which means I had to write
16.937	a lot of papers.
19.423	Now, when a normal student writes a paper,
21.495	they might spread the work out
21.495	a little like this.
23.892	So, you know --
25.067	(Laughter)
26.748	you get started maybe a little slowly,
28.599	but you get enough done in the first week
30.591	that, with some heavier days later on,
32.446	everything gets done, things stay civil.
34.627	(Laughter)
35.853	And I would want to do that like that.
38.148	That would be the plan.
39.366	I would have it all ready to go,
41.88	but then, actually, the paper
41.88	would come along,
44.398	and then I would kind of do this.
46.363	(Laughter)
48.757	And that would happen every single paper.
51.638	But then came my 90-page senior thesis,
55.544	a paper you're supposed
55.544	to spend a year on.
57.855	And I knew for a paper like that,
57.855	my normal work flow was not an option.
61.498	It was way too big a project.
62.923	So I planned things out,
64.1	and I decided I kind of had
64.1	to go something like this.
67.781	This is how the year would go.
69.257	So I'd start off light,
71.248	and I'd bump it up in the middle months,
73.59	and then at the end,
73.59	I would kick it up into high gear
76.24	just like a little staircase.
77.703	How hard could it be
77.703	to walk up the stairs?
80.233	No big deal, right?
83.09	But then, the funniest thing happened.
84.924	Those first few months?
86.791	They came and went,
87.982	and I couldn't quite do stuff.
89.591	So we had an awesome new revised plan.
91.464	(Laughter)
92.655	And then --
93.838	(Laughter)
95.744	But then those middle months
95.744	actually went by,
98.552	and I didn't really write words,
100.758	and so we were here.
103.5	And then two months turned into one month,
106.1	which turned into two weeks.
107.749	And one day I woke up
109.724	with three days until the deadline,
113.502	still not having written a word,
115.457	and so I did the only thing I could:
117.54	I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
120.171	pulling not one but two all-nighters --
122.471	humans are not supposed to pull
122.471	two all-nighters --
126.373	sprinted across campus,
128.39	dove in slow motion,
129.9	and got it in just at the deadline.
131.98	I thought that was the end of everything.
134.028	But a week later I get a call,
135.611	and it's the school.
137.757	"And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"""
139.42	"And I say, ""Yeah."""
140.912	"And they say, ""We need"
140.912	"to talk about your thesis."""
143.276	"And I say, ""OK."""
145.468	And they say,
147.23	"""It's the best one we've ever seen."""
149.15	(Laughter)
152.014	(Applause)
156.945	That did not happen.
158.271	(Laughter)
160.433	It was a very, very bad thesis.
163.08	(Laughter)
165.378	I just wanted to enjoy that one moment
165.378	when all of you thought,
169.502	"""This guy is amazing!"""
171.431	(Laughter)
172.803	No, no, it was very, very bad.
175.343	Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
178.775	I write the blog Wait But Why.
180.542	And a couple of years ago,
180.542	I decided to write about procrastination.
184.302	My behavior has always perplexed
184.302	the non-procrastinators around me,
187.61	and I wanted to explain
187.61	to the non-procrastinators of the world
191.322	what goes on in the heads
191.322	of procrastinators,
193.453	and why we are the way we are.
194.917	Now, I had a hypothesis
196.097	that the brains of procrastinators
196.097	were actually different
198.976	than the brains of other people.
201.698	And to test this, I found an MRI lab
203.913	that actually let me scan both my brain
206.369	and the brain of a proven
206.369	non-procrastinator,
209.048	so I could compare them.
210.507	I actually brought them here
210.507	to show you today.
212.732	I want you to take a look carefully
212.732	to see if you can notice a difference.
216.293	I know that if you're not
216.293	a trained brain expert,
218.631	it's not that obvious,
218.631	but just take a look, OK?
220.918	So here's the brain
220.918	of a non-procrastinator.
223.835	(Laughter)
226.133	Now ...
228.325	here's my brain.
230.28	(Laughter)
235.713	There is a difference.
237.904	Both brains have a Rational
237.904	Decision-Maker in them,
240.316	but the procrastinator's brain
241.992	also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
245.002	Now, what does this mean
245.002	for the procrastinator?
247.328	Well, it means everything's fine
247.328	until this happens.
249.793	[This is a perfect time
249.793	to get some work done.] [Nope!]
252.439	So the Rational Decision-Maker
252.439	will make the rational decision
255.396	to do something productive,
257.316	but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,
259.29	so he actually takes the wheel,
260.822	"and he says, ""Actually, let's read"
260.822	the entire Wikipedia page
263.727	of the Nancy Kerrigan/
263.727	Tonya Harding scandal,
265.887	because I just remembered
265.887	that that happened.
268.042	(Laughter)
269.082	Then --
270.264	(Laughter)
271.551	Then we're going to go over to the fridge,
273.613	to see if there's anything new
273.613	in there since 10 minutes ago.
276.503	After that, we're going to go
276.503	on a YouTube spiral
279.165	that starts with videos
279.165	of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
282.439	and ends much, much later
282.439	with us watching interviews
285.179	with Justin Bieber's mom.
287.083	(Laughter)
289.295	"""All of that's going to take a while,"
291.082	so we're not going to really have room
291.082	on the schedule for any work today.
294.608	"Sorry!"""
295.795	(Sigh)
298.325	Now, what is going on here?
303.481	The Instant Gratification Monkey
303.481	does not seem like a guy
306.196	you want behind the wheel.
307.474	He lives entirely in the present moment.
309.443	He has no memory of the past,
309.443	no knowledge of the future,
312.295	and he only cares about two things:
314.016	easy and fun.
316.338	Now, in the animal world, that works fine.
319.454	If you're a dog
320.686	and you spend your whole life doing
320.686	nothing other than easy and fun things,
324.281	you're a huge success!
325.47	(Laughter)
327.405	And to the Monkey,
329.969	humans are just another animal species.
332.087	You have to keep well-slept, well-fed
332.087	and propagating into the next generation,
336.617	which in tribal times
336.617	might have worked OK.
338.927	But, if you haven't noticed,
338.927	now we're not in tribal times.
341.801	We're in an advanced civilization,
341.801	and the Monkey does not know what that is.
345.958	Which is why we have
345.958	another guy in our brain,
348.263	the Rational Decision-Maker,
350.652	who gives us the ability to do things
350.652	no other animal can do.
353.703	We can visualize the future.
355.648	We can see the big picture.
357.424	We can make long-term plans.
358.798	And he wants to take
358.798	all of that into account.
362.138	And he wants to just have us do
363.853	whatever makes sense
363.853	to be doing right now.
366.825	Now, sometimes it makes sense
368.238	to be doing things that are easy and fun,
370.291	like when you're having dinner
370.291	or going to bed
372.466	or enjoying well-earned leisure time.
374.318	That's why there's an overlap.
375.792	Sometimes they agree.
377.56	But other times, it makes much more sense
380.406	to be doing things that are harder
380.406	and less pleasant,
384.032	for the sake of the big picture.
385.596	And that's when we have a conflict.
388.017	And for the procrastinator,
389.356	that conflict tends to end
389.356	a certain way every time,
391.889	leaving him spending a lot of time
391.889	in this orange zone,
395.633	an easy and fun place that's entirely
395.633	out of the Makes Sense circle.
399.984	I call it the Dark Playground.
402.287	(Laughter)
403.935	Now, the Dark Playground is a place
407.087	that all of you procrastinators
407.087	out there know very well.
410.892	It's where leisure activities happen
412.72	at times when leisure activities
412.72	are not supposed to be happening.
416.418	The fun you have in the Dark Playground
418.332	isn't actually fun,
418.332	because it's completely unearned,
420.839	and the air is filled with guilt,
420.839	dread, anxiety, self-hatred --
424.078	all of those good procrastinator feelings.
426.703	And the question is, in this situation,
426.703	with the Monkey behind the wheel,
430.203	how does the procrastinator ever get
430.203	himself over here to this blue zone,
433.82	a less pleasant place, but where
433.82	really important things happen?
437.125	Well, turns out the procrastinator
437.125	has a guardian angel,
442.186	someone who's always looking
442.186	down on him and watching over him
445.418	in his darkest moments --
446.872	someone called the Panic Monster.
448.991	(Laughter)
454.386	Now, the Panic Monster
454.386	is dormant most of the time,
459.27	but he suddenly wakes up
459.27	anytime a deadline gets too close
463.196	or there's danger of public embarrassment,
465.265	a career disaster or some other
465.265	scary consequence.
467.8	And importantly, he's the only thing
467.8	the Monkey is terrified of.
471.996	Now, he became very relevant
471.996	in my life pretty recently,
476.598	because the people of TED
476.598	reached out to me about six months ago
479.868	and invited me to do a TED Talk.
481.913	(Laughter)
487.058	Now, of course, I said yes.
488.989	It's always been a dream of mine
488.989	to have done a TED Talk in the past.
492.818	(Laughter)
496.814	(Applause)
504.203	But in the middle of all this excitement,
506.196	the Rational Decision-Maker seemed
506.196	to have something else on his mind.
509.521	"He was saying, ""Are we clear"
509.521	on what we just accepted?
512.093	Do we get what's going to be now
512.093	happening one day in the future?
515.366	We need to sit down
515.366	"and work on this right now."""
517.657	"And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree,"
517.657	but let's just open Google Earth
520.946	and zoom in to the bottom of India,
520.946	like 200 feet above the ground,
524.13	and scroll up for two and a half hours
524.13	til we get to the top of the country,
527.775	"so we can get a better feel for India."""
529.777	(Laughter)
535.149	So that's what we did that day.
536.658	(Laughter)
540.604	As six months turned into four
540.604	and then two and then one,
544.524	the people of TED decided
544.524	to release the speakers.
547.643	And I opened up the website,
547.643	and there was my face
550.279	staring right back at me.
551.659	And guess who woke up?
553.283	(Laughter)
557.43	So the Panic Monster
557.43	starts losing his mind,
559.904	and a few seconds later,
559.904	the whole system's in mayhem.
562.674	(Laughter)
567.511	And the Monkey -- remember,
567.511	he's terrified of the Panic Monster --
570.636	boom, he's up the tree!
571.818	And finally,
572.993	finally, the Rational Decision-Maker
572.993	can take the wheel
575.613	and I can start working on the talk.
577.355	Now, the Panic Monster explains
579.667	all kinds of pretty insane
579.667	procrastinator behavior,
583.172	like how someone like me
583.172	could spend two weeks
585.53	unable to start the opening
585.53	sentence of a paper,
589.398	and then miraculously find
589.398	the unbelievable work ethic
592.193	to stay up all night
592.193	and write eight pages.
596.385	And this entire situation,
596.385	with the three characters --
599.391	this is the procrastinator's system.
602.096	It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
605.545	This is what I decided to write about
605.545	on the blog a couple of years ago.
609.631	When I did, I was amazed by the response.
612.626	Literally thousands of emails came in,
614.803	from all different kinds of people
614.803	from all over the world,
617.604	doing all different kinds of things.
619.366	These are people who were nurses,
619.366	bankers, painters, engineers
622.356	and lots and lots of PhD students.
624.702	(Laughter)
626.727	And they were all writing,
626.727	saying the same thing:
629.039	"""I have this problem too."""
631.015	But what struck me was the contrast
631.015	between the light tone of the post
634.868	and the heaviness of these emails.
636.987	These people were writing
636.987	with intense frustration
640.094	about what procrastination
640.094	had done to their lives,
642.88	about what this Monkey had done to them.
646.902	And I thought about this, and I said,
649.892	well, if the procrastinator's system
649.892	works, then what's going on?
653.028	Why are all of these people
653.028	in such a dark place?
655.538	Well, it turns out that there's
655.538	two kinds of procrastination.
659.987	Everything I've talked about today,
659.987	the examples I've given,
662.845	they all have deadlines.
664.02	And when there's deadlines,
665.342	the effects of procrastination
665.342	are contained to the short term
668.291	because the Panic Monster gets involved.
670.228	But there's a second kind
670.228	of procrastination
672.306	that happens in situations
672.306	when there is no deadline.
674.817	So if you wanted a career
674.817	where you're a self-starter --
677.531	something in the arts,
677.531	something entrepreneurial --
679.968	there's no deadlines on those things
679.968	at first, because nothing's happening,
683.517	not until you've gone out
683.517	and done the hard work
685.785	to get momentum, get things going.
687.435	There's also all kinds of important things
687.435	outside of your career
690.537	that don't involve any deadlines,
692.166	like seeing your family or exercising
692.166	and taking care of your health,
695.455	working on your relationship
696.883	or getting out of a relationship
696.883	that isn't working.
699.588	Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
699.588	of doing these hard things
704.76	is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,
706.669	because in all of these
706.669	non-deadline situations,
709.493	the Panic Monster doesn't show up.
711.145	He has nothing to wake up for,
712.621	so the effects of procrastination,
712.621	they're not contained;
715.343	they just extend outward forever.
717.953	And it's this long-term
717.953	kind of procrastination
720.717	that's much less visible
720.717	and much less talked about
723.822	than the funnier, short-term
723.822	deadline-based kind.
726.747	It's usually suffered
726.747	quietly and privately.
730.816	And it can be the source
731.994	of a huge amount of long-term
731.994	unhappiness, and regrets.
736.576	And I thought, that's why
736.576	those people are emailing,
739.472	and that's why they're
739.472	in such a bad place.
741.998	It's not that they're cramming
741.998	for some project.
744.766	It's that long-term procrastination
744.766	has made them feel like a spectator,
748.211	at times, in their own lives.
750.594	The frustration is not
750.594	that they couldn't achieve their dreams;
753.6	it's that they weren't even
753.6	able to start chasing them.
756.713	So I read these emails
756.713	and I had a little bit of an epiphany --
762.182	that I don't think
762.182	non-procrastinators exist.
765.979	That's right -- I think all of you
765.979	are procrastinators.
769.898	Now, you might not all be a mess,
771.836	like some of us,
773.21	(Laughter)
774.763	and some of you may have
774.763	a healthy relationship with deadlines,
778.103	but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick
780.651	is when the deadlines aren't there.
783.249	Now, I want to show you one last thing.
785.305	I call this a Life Calendar.
788.352	That's one box for every week
788.352	of a 90-year life.
793.345	That's not that many boxes,
794.958	especially since we've already
794.958	used a bunch of those.
798.607	So I think we need to all take a long,
798.607	hard look at that calendar.
804.977	We need to think about what
804.977	we're really procrastinating on,
808.014	because everyone is procrastinating
808.014	on something in life.
812.782	We need to stay aware
812.782	of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
817.455	That's a job for all of us.
820.669	And because there's not
820.669	that many boxes on there,
822.993	it's a job that should
822.993	probably start today.
825.307	Well, maybe not today, but ...
828.331	(Laughter)
829.996	You know.
831.576	Sometime soon.
833.393	Thank you.
834.626	(Applause)
