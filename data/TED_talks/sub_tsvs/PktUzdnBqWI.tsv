15.26	Delighted to be here
18.26	and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,
20.26	which is beauty.
23.26	I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,
26.26	actually, for a living.
28.26	I try to figure out intellectually,
30.26	philosophically, psychologically,
32.26	what the experience of beauty is,
35.26	what sensibly can be said about it
38.26	and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.
41.26	Now this is an extremely complicated subject,
44.26	in part because the things that we call beautiful
47.26	are so different.
49.26	I mean just think of the sheer variety --
51.26	a baby's face,
53.26	"Berlioz's ""Harold in Italy,"""
55.26	"movies like ""The Wizard of Oz"""
57.26	or the plays of Chekhov,
59.26	a central California landscape,
61.26	a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,
64.26	"""Der Rosenkavalier,"""
66.26	a stunning match-winning goal
68.26	in a World Cup soccer match,
70.26	"Van Gogh's ""Starry Night,"""
72.26	a Jane Austen novel,
74.26	Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.
77.26	This brief list includes human beings,
80.26	natural landforms,
82.26	works of art and skilled human actions.
85.26	An account that explains the presence of beauty
88.26	in everything on this list
90.26	is not going to be easy.
92.26	I can, however, give you at least a taste
95.26	of what I regard
97.26	as the most powerful theory of beauty
99.26	we yet have.
101.26	And we get it not from a philosopher of art,
103.26	not from a postmodern art theorist
105.26	or a bigwig art critic.
107.26	No, this theory
109.26	comes from an expert
111.26	on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,
117.26	and you know who I mean:
120.26	Charles Darwin.
122.26	Of course, a lot of people think they already know
125.26	the proper answer to the question,
128.26	"""What is beauty?"""
131.26	It's in the eye of the beholder.
133.26	It's whatever moves you personally.
135.26	Or, as some people,
137.26	especially academics prefer,
139.26	beauty is in the culturally conditioned
142.26	eye of the beholder.
144.26	People agree that paintings or movies or music
147.26	are beautiful
149.26	because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.
153.26	Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts
156.26	travel across cultures
158.26	with great ease.
160.26	Beethoven is adored in Japan.
162.26	Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
165.26	Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures
167.26	in British museums,
169.26	while Shakespeare is translated
171.26	into every major language of the Earth.
174.26	Or just think about American jazz
176.26	or American movies --
178.26	they go everywhere.
180.26	There are many differences among the arts,
183.26	but there are also universal,
185.26	cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures
187.26	and values.
189.26	How can we explain
192.26	this universality?
195.26	The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct
197.26	a Darwinian evolutionary history
200.26	of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.
203.26	We need to reverse-engineer
205.26	our present artistic tastes and preferences
208.26	and explain how they came
210.26	to be engraved in our minds
213.26	by the actions of both our prehistoric,
216.26	largely pleistocene environments,
218.26	where we became fully human,
220.26	but also by the social situations
222.26	in which we evolved.
224.26	This reverse engineering
226.26	can also enlist help
229.26	from the human record
231.26	preserved in prehistory.
233.26	I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
236.26	And it should take into account
238.26	what we know of the aesthetic interests
240.26	of isolated hunter-gatherer bands
243.26	that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.
247.26	Now, I personally
249.26	have no doubt whatsoever
251.26	that the experience of beauty,
253.26	with its emotional intensity and pleasure,
256.26	belongs to our evolved human psychology.
260.26	The experience of beauty is one component
263.26	in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
267.26	Beauty is an adaptive effect,
269.26	which we extend
271.26	and intensify
273.26	in the creation and enjoyment
275.26	of works of art and entertainment.
279.26	As many of you will know,
281.26	evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.
284.26	The first of these is natural selection --
287.26	that's random mutation and selective retention --
290.26	along with our basic anatomy and physiology --
293.26	the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
296.26	Natural selection also explains
299.26	many basic revulsions,
301.26	such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,
303.26	or fears, such as the fear of snakes
306.26	or standing close to the edge of a cliff.
309.26	Natural selection also explains pleasures --
312.26	sexual pleasure,
314.26	our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,
317.26	which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,
320.26	from ripe fruits through chocolate malts
323.26	and barbecued ribs.
326.26	The other great principle of evolution
328.26	is sexual selection,
330.26	and it operates very differently.
332.26	The peacock's magnificent tail
335.26	is the most famous example of this.
338.26	It did not evolve for natural survival.
341.26	In fact, it goes against natural survival.
344.26	No, the peacock's tail
346.26	results from the mating choices
348.26	made by peahens.
350.26	It's quite a familiar story.
352.26	It's women who actually push history forward.
356.26	Darwin himself, by the way,
358.26	had no doubts that the peacock's tail
360.26	was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.
362.26	He actually used that word.
365.26	Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,
368.26	we can say that the experience of beauty
371.26	is one of the ways that evolution has
374.26	of arousing and sustaining
376.26	interest or fascination,
378.26	even obsession,
380.26	in order to encourage us
382.26	toward making the most adaptive decisions
385.26	for survival and reproduction.
389.26	Beauty is nature's way
391.26	of acting at a distance,
394.26	so to speak.
396.26	I mean, you can't expect to eat
398.26	an adaptively beneficial landscape.
400.26	It would hardly do to eat your baby
402.26	or your lover.
404.26	So evolution's trick
406.26	is to make them beautiful,
408.26	to have them exert a kind of magnetism
411.26	to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
415.26	Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,
418.26	the magnetic pull
420.26	of beautiful landscapes.
422.26	People in very different cultures
424.26	all over the world
426.26	tend to like a particular kind of landscape,
429.26	a landscape that just happens to be similar
432.26	to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.
435.26	This landscape shows up today
437.26	on calendars, on postcards,
440.26	in the design of golf courses and public parks
443.26	and in gold-framed pictures
445.26	that hang in living rooms
447.26	from New York to New Zealand.
450.26	It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape
453.26	featuring open spaces
455.26	of low grasses
457.26	interspersed with copses of trees.
460.26	The trees, by the way, are often preferred
462.26	if they fork near the ground,
464.26	that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up
467.26	if you were in a tight fix.
470.26	The landscape shows the presence
472.26	of water directly in view,
474.26	or evidence of water in a bluish distance,
478.26	indications of animal or bird life
481.26	as well as diverse greenery
483.26	and finally -- get this --
486.26	a path
488.26	or a road,
490.26	perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,
493.26	that extends into the distance,
496.26	almost inviting you to follow it.
500.26	This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,
503.26	even by people in countries
505.26	that don't have it.
507.26	The ideal savanna landscape
509.26	is one of the clearest examples
511.26	where human beings everywhere
513.26	find beauty
515.26	in similar visual experience.
517.26	But, someone might argue,
519.26	that's natural beauty.
521.26	How about artistic beauty?
524.26	Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
527.26	No, I don't think it is.
529.26	And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory
532.26	to say something about it.
534.26	It is widely assumed
536.26	that the earliest human artworks
538.26	are the stupendously skillful cave paintings
541.26	that we all know from Lascaux
543.26	and Chauvet.
546.26	Chauvet caves
548.26	are about 32,000 years old,
550.26	along with a few small, realistic sculptures
553.26	of women and animals from the same period.
560.26	But artistic and decorative skills
562.26	are actually much older than that.
566.26	Beautiful shell necklaces
568.26	that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,
571.26	as well as ochre body paint,
573.26	have been found
575.26	from around 100,000 years ago.
577.26	But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts
580.26	are older even than this.
582.26	I have in mind
584.26	the so-called Acheulian hand axes.
588.26	The oldest stone tools are choppers
591.26	from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
593.26	They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
596.26	These crude tools
598.26	were around for thousands of centuries,
601.26	until around 1.4 million years ago
604.26	when Homo erectus
606.26	started shaping
608.26	single, thin stone blades,
610.26	sometimes rounded ovals,
613.26	but often in what are to our eyes
615.26	an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf
618.26	or teardrop form.
620.26	These Acheulian hand axes --
622.26	they're named after St. Acheul in France,
624.26	where finds were made in 19th century --
627.26	have been unearthed in their thousands,
630.26	scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,
633.26	almost everywhere Homo erectus
636.26	and Homo ergaster roamed.
639.26	Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes
642.26	shows that they can't have been made
644.26	for butchering animals.
646.26	And the plot really thickens when you realize
649.26	that, unlike other pleistocene tools,
652.26	the hand axes often exhibit
654.26	no evidence of wear
656.26	on their delicate blade edges.
658.26	And some, in any event, are too big
660.26	to use for butchery.
663.26	Their symmetry, their attractive materials
665.26	and, above all,
667.26	their meticulous workmanship
669.26	are simply quite beautiful
672.26	to our eyes, even today.
675.26	So what were these ancient --
679.26	I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,
681.26	but they're at the same time
683.26	somehow familiar.
685.26	What were these artifacts for?
688.26	The best available answer
690.26	is that they were literally
692.26	the earliest known works of art,
694.26	practical tools transformed
696.26	into captivating aesthetic objects,
699.26	contemplated both for their elegant shape
701.26	and their virtuoso craftsmanship.
705.26	Hand axes mark
707.26	an evolutionary advance in human history --
709.26	tools fashioned to function
711.26	"as what Darwinians call ""fitness signals"" --"
714.26	that is to say, displays
716.26	that are performances
718.26	like the peacock's tail,
720.26	except that, unlike hair and feathers,
723.26	the hand axes are consciously
725.26	cleverly crafted.
727.26	Competently made hand axes
729.26	indicated desirable personal qualities --
733.26	intelligence, fine motor control,
736.26	planning ability,
738.26	conscientiousness
740.26	and sometimes access to rare materials.
743.26	Over tens of thousands of generations,
746.26	such skills increased the status
748.26	of those who displayed them
750.26	and gained a reproductive advantage
752.26	over the less capable.
754.26	You know, it's an old line,
756.26	but it has been shown to work --
758.26	"""Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"""
761.26	(Laughter)
763.26	Except, of course, what's interesting about this
766.26	is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,
769.26	because the Homo erectus
771.26	that made these objects
774.26	did not have language.
776.26	It's hard to grasp,
778.26	but it's an incredible fact.
781.26	This object was made
783.26	by a hominid ancestor,
786.26	Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,
790.26	between 50,000 and 100,000 years
793.26	before language.
796.26	Stretching over a million years,
798.26	the hand axe tradition
800.26	is the longest artistic tradition
803.26	in human and proto-human history.
806.26	By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --
809.26	as they were then called, finally --
811.26	were doubtless finding new ways
813.26	to amuse and amaze each other
816.26	by, who knows, telling jokes,
818.26	storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.
821.26	Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.
824.26	For us moderns,
826.26	virtuoso technique
828.26	is used to create imaginary worlds
830.26	in fiction and in movies,
832.26	to express intense emotions
834.26	with music, painting and dance.
837.26	But still,
839.26	one fundamental trait
841.26	of the ancestral personality persists
843.26	in our aesthetic cravings:
846.26	the beauty we find
848.26	in skilled performances.
850.26	From Lascaux to the Louvre
852.26	to Carnegie Hall,
854.26	human beings
856.26	have a permanent innate taste
858.26	for virtuoso displays in the arts.
862.26	We find beauty
864.26	in something done well.
868.26	So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window
870.26	displaying a beautifully cut
872.26	teardrop-shaped stone,
874.26	don't be so sure
876.26	it's just your culture telling you
878.26	that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
880.26	Your distant ancestors loved that shape
883.26	and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,
886.26	even before
888.26	they could put their love into words.
890.26	Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
893.26	No, it's deep in our minds.
896.26	It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills
899.26	and rich emotional lives
901.26	of our most ancient ancestors.
904.26	Our powerful reaction to images,
906.26	to the expression of emotion in art,
909.26	to the beauty of music, to the night sky,
912.26	will be with us and our descendants
915.26	for as long as the human race exists.
918.26	Thank you.
920.26	(Applause)
