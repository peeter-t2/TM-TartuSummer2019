13.174	Hi.
14.357	I want to talk about understanding,
14.357	and the nature of understanding,
18.2	and what the essence of understanding is,
21.617	because understanding is something
21.617	we aim for, everyone.
24.678	We want to understand things.
27.763	My claim is that understanding has to do
30.135	with the ability to change
30.135	your perspective.
32.737	If you don't have that,
32.737	you don't have understanding.
36.106	So that is my claim.
37.672	And I want to focus on mathematics.
40.05	Many of us think of mathematics
40.05	as addition, subtraction,
43.57	multiplication, division,
45.542	fractions, percent, geometry,
45.542	algebra -- all that stuff.
50.034	But actually, I want to talk
50.034	about the essence of mathematics as well.
53.732	And my claim is that mathematics
53.732	has to do with patterns.
57.043	Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,
59.558	and this pattern actually emerges
59.558	just from drawing circles
63.513	in a very particular way.
65.778	So my day-to-day definition
65.778	of mathematics that I use every day
70.391	is the following:
72.03	First of all, it's about finding patterns.
76.001	"And by ""pattern,"" I mean a connection,"
76.001	a structure, some regularity,
81.52	some rules that govern what we see.
84.17	Second of all,
85.349	I think it is about representing
85.349	these patterns with a language.
89.361	We make up language if we don't have it,
91.829	and in mathematics, this is essential.
95.013	It's also about making assumptions
96.837	and playing around with these assumptions
96.837	and just seeing what happens.
100.474	We're going to do that very soon.
102.986	And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.
106.46	Mathematics enables us
106.46	to do so many things.
110.632	So let's have a look at these patterns.
112.872	If you want to tie a tie knot,
115.118	there are patterns.
116.452	Tie knots have names.
118.453	And you can also do
118.453	the mathematics of tie knots.
120.824	This is a left-out, right-in,
120.824	center-out and tie.
124.073	This is a left-in, right-out,
124.073	left-in, center-out and tie.
128.005	This is a language we made up
128.005	for the patterns of tie knots,
132.522	and a half-Windsor is all that.
135.529	This is a mathematics book
135.529	about tying shoelaces
138.34	at the university level,
139.754	because there are patterns in shoelaces.
141.756	You can do it in so many different ways.
143.891	We can analyze it.
145.159	We can make up languages for it.
148.218	And representations
148.218	are all over mathematics.
151.181	This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.
155.335	He invented a language
155.335	for patterns in nature.
159.363	When we throw something up in the air,
161.255	it falls down.
162.469	Why?
163.644	We're not sure, but we can represent
163.644	this with mathematics in a pattern.
168.285	This is also a pattern.
169.912	This is also an invented language.
172.636	Can you guess for what?
175.481	It is actually a notation system
175.481	for dancing, for tap dancing.
179.532	That enables him as a choreographer
179.532	to do cool stuff, to do new things,
184.812	because he has represented it.
187.232	I want you to think about how amazing
187.232	representing something actually is.
192.62	"Here it says the word ""mathematics."""
195.905	But actually, they're just dots, right?
198.329	So how in the world can these dots
198.329	represent the word?
201.344	Well, they do.
203.343	"They represent the word ""mathematics,"""
205.265	and these symbols also represent that word
207.849	and this we can listen to.
209.531	It sounds like this.
210.912	(Beeps)
212.92	Somehow these sounds represent
212.92	the word and the concept.
216.234	How does this happen?
217.914	There's something amazing
217.914	going on about representing stuff.
221.966	So I want to talk about
221.966	that magic that happens
227.607	when we actually represent something.
229.602	Here you see just lines
229.602	with different widths.
232.642	They stand for numbers
232.642	for a particular book.
235.291	And I can actually recommend
235.291	this book, it's a very nice book.
238.308	(Laughter)
239.354	Just trust me.
241.475	OK, so let's just do an experiment,
243.822	just to play around
243.822	with some straight lines.
246.014	This is a straight line.
247.205	Let's make another one.
248.383	So every time we move,
248.383	we move one down and one across,
251.216	and we draw a new straight line, right?
253.814	We do this over and over and over,
256.351	and we look for patterns.
257.733	So this pattern emerges,
260.22	and it's a rather nice pattern.
262.286	It looks like a curve, right?
264.045	Just from drawing simple, straight lines.
267.271	Now I can change my perspective
267.271	a little bit. I can rotate it.
270.944	Have a look at the curve.
272.35	What does it look like?
273.753	Is it a part of a circle?
275.759	It's actually not a part of a circle.
277.685	So I have to continue my investigation
277.685	and look for the true pattern.
281.868	Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?
285.674	Well, no.
286.854	Perhaps I should extend
286.854	the lines like this,
289.027	and look for the pattern there.
290.821	Let's make more lines.
292.14	We do this.
293.394	And then let's zoom out
293.394	and change our perspective again.
297.801	Then we can actually see that
297.801	what started out as just straight lines
301.336	is actually a curve called a parabola.
303.855	This is represented by a simple equation,
307.096	and it's a beautiful pattern.
309.521	So this is the stuff that we do.
311.32	We find patterns, and we represent them.
313.954	And I think this is a nice
313.954	day-to-day definition.
316.602	But today I want to go
316.602	a little bit deeper,
318.957	and think about
318.957	what the nature of this is.
322.925	What makes it possible?
324.377	There's one thing
324.377	that's a little bit deeper,
326.555	and that has to do with the ability
326.555	to change your perspective.
330.082	And I claim that when
330.082	you change your perspective,
332.629	and if you take another point of view,
335.459	you learn something new
335.459	about what you are watching
339.393	or looking at or hearing.
341.472	And I think this is a really important
341.472	thing that we do all the time.
345.834	So let's just look at
345.834	this simple equation,
349.838	x + x = 2 • x.
352.411	This is a very nice pattern,
352.411	and it's true,
354.507	because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.
357.36	We've seen this over and over,
357.36	and we represent it like this.
360.485	But think about it: this is an equation.
363.025	It says that something
363.025	is equal to something else,
365.611	and that's two different perspectives.
367.922	One perspective is, it's a sum.
369.845	It's something you plus together.
371.715	On the other hand, it's a multiplication,
374.111	and those are two different perspectives.
377.14	And I would go as far as to say
377.14	that every equation is like this,
380.912	every mathematical equation
380.912	where you use that equality sign
385.052	is actually a metaphor.
386.919	It's an analogy between two things.
388.949	You're just viewing something
388.949	and taking two different points of view,
392.468	and you're expressing that in a language.
394.885	Have a look at this equation.
396.473	This is one of the most
396.473	beautiful equations.
398.752	It simply says that, well,
401.902	two things, they're both -1.
404.279	This thing on the left-hand side is -1,
404.279	and the other one is.
407.693	And that, I think, is one
407.693	of the essential parts
410.043	of mathematics -- you take
410.043	different points of view.
412.53	So let's just play around.
413.889	Let's take a number.
415.18	We know four-thirds.
415.18	We know what four-thirds is.
418.082	It's 1.333, but we have to have
418.082	those three dots,
421.489	otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.
423.886	But this is only in base 10.
425.806	You know, the number system,
425.806	we use 10 digits.
428.093	If we change that around
428.093	and only use two digits,
430.435	that's called the binary system.
432.269	It's written like this.
433.996	So we're now talking about the number.
435.982	The number is four-thirds.
437.964	We can write it like this,
439.331	and we can change the base,
439.331	change the number of digits,
442.36	and we can write it differently.
444.172	So these are all representations
444.172	of the same number.
448.363	We can even write it simply,
448.363	like 1.3 or 1.6.
451.935	It all depends on
451.935	how many digits you have.
454.521	Or perhaps we just simplify
454.521	and write it like this.
457.927	I like this one, because this says
457.927	four divided by three.
461.166	And this number expresses
461.166	a relation between two numbers.
464.227	You have four on the one hand
464.227	and three on the other.
467.215	And you can visualize this in many ways.
469.317	What I'm doing now is viewing that number
469.317	from different perspectives.
473.388	I'm playing around.
474.563	I'm playing around with
474.563	how we view something,
477.131	and I'm doing it very deliberately.
478.867	We can take a grid.
480.074	If it's four across and three up,
480.074	this line equals five, always.
484.776	It has to be like this.
484.776	This is a beautiful pattern.
487.488	Four and three and five.
489.177	And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,
491.912	you've seen a lot of times.
493.527	This is your average computer screen.
498.767	is a television or a computer screen.
501.864	So these are all nice representations,
503.92	but I want to go a little bit further
503.92	and just play more with this number.
507.866	Here you see two circles.
507.866	I'm going to rotate them like this.
511.138	Observe the upper-left one.
512.95	It goes a little bit faster, right?
515.137	You can see this.
516.319	It actually goes exactly
516.319	four-thirds as fast.
519.717	That means that when it goes
519.717	around four times,
522.141	the other one goes around three times.
524.044	Now let's make two lines, and draw
524.044	this dot where the lines meet.
527.569	We get this dot dancing around.
529.295	(Laughter)
530.356	And this dot comes from that number.
532.926	Right? Now we should trace it.
535.239	Let's trace it and see what happens.
537.441	This is what mathematics is all about.
539.393	It's about seeing what happens.
541.052	And this emerges from four-thirds.
544.02	I like to say that this
544.02	is the image of four-thirds.
547.404	It's much nicer -- (Cheers)
548.724	Thank you!
549.906	(Applause)
556.556	This is not new.
557.731	This has been known
557.731	for a long time, but --
559.789	(Laughter)
561.422	But this is four-thirds.
563.13	Let's do another experiment.
564.713	Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)
568.846	This is a perfect A, 440Hz.
571.859	Let's multiply it by two.
573.569	We get this sound. (Beep)
574.952	When we play them together,
574.952	it sounds like this.
577.231	This is an octave, right?
578.468	We can do this game. We can play
578.468	a sound, play the same A.
581.257	We can multiply it by three-halves.
582.982	(Beep)
584.624	This is what we call a perfect fifth.
586.592	(Beep)
587.662	They sound really nice together.
589.792	Let's multiply this sound
589.792	by four-thirds. (Beep)
593.939	What happens?
595.889	You get this sound. (Beep)
597.344	This is the perfect fourth.
598.654	If the first one is an A, this is a D.
600.923	They sound like this together. (Beeps)
602.977	This is the sound of four-thirds.
605.411	What I'm doing now,
605.411	I'm changing my perspective.
607.989	I'm just viewing a number
607.989	from another perspective.
610.793	I can even do this with rhythms, right?
612.782	I can take a rhythm and play
612.782	three beats at one time (Drumbeats)
616.478	in a period of time,
618.053	and I can play another sound
618.053	four times in that same space.
622.419	(Clanking sounds)
623.485	Sounds kind of boring,
623.485	but listen to them together.
625.89	(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)
628.7	(Laughter)
630.014	Hey! So.
631.459	(Laughter)
633.371	I can even make a little hi-hat.
635.554	(Drumbeats and cymbals)
637.419	Can you hear this?
638.594	So, this is the sound of four-thirds.
640.731	Again, this is as a rhythm.
642.605	(Drumbeats and cowbell)
644.439	And I can keep doing this
644.439	and play games with this number.
647.311	Four-thirds is a really great number.
647.311	I love four-thirds!
650.08	(Laughter)
651.38	Truly -- it's an undervalued number.
653.891	So if you take a sphere and look
653.891	at the volume of the sphere,
656.774	it's actually four-thirds
656.774	of some particular cylinder.
659.731	So four-thirds is in the sphere.
659.731	It's the volume of the sphere.
663.824	OK, so why am I doing all this?
665.89	Well, I want to talk about what it means
665.89	to understand something
669.144	and what we mean
669.144	by understanding something.
671.732	That's my aim here.
673.179	And my claim is that
673.179	you understand something
675.333	if you have the ability to view it
675.333	from different perspectives.
678.349	Let's look at this letter.
678.349	It's a beautiful R, right?
680.914	How do you know that?
682.557	Well, as a matter of fact,
682.557	you've seen a bunch of R's,
685.769	and you've generalized
687.438	and abstracted all of these
687.438	and found a pattern.
690.432	So you know that this is an R.
695.643	So what I'm aiming for here
695.643	is saying something
698.474	about how understanding
698.474	and changing your perspective
701.879	are linked.
703.235	And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,
705.428	and I can actually use this
705.428	to teach something,
707.764	because when I give someone else
707.764	another story, a metaphor, an analogy,
712.628	if I tell a story
712.628	from a different point of view,
715.051	I enable understanding.
716.588	I make understanding possible,
718.478	because you have to generalize
718.478	over everything you see and hear,
721.568	and if I give you another perspective,
721.568	that will become easier for you.
726.191	Let's do a simple example again.
728.121	This is four and three.
728.121	This is four triangles.
730.786	So this is also four-thirds, in a way.
733.258	Let's just join them together.
735.004	Now we're going to play a game;
735.004	we're going to fold it up
737.737	into a three-dimensional structure.
739.443	I love this.
740.631	This is a square pyramid.
742.529	And let's just take two of them
742.529	and put them together.
745.703	So this is what is called an octahedron.
748.416	It's one of the five platonic solids.
751.147	Now we can quite literally
751.147	change our perspective,
753.616	because we can rotate it
753.616	around all of the axes
756.335	and view it from different perspectives.
758.371	And I can change the axis,
760.461	and then I can view it
760.461	from another point of view,
762.823	but it's the same thing,
762.823	but it looks a little different.
765.55	I can do it even one more time.
767.242	Every time I do this,
767.242	something else appears,
770.568	so I'm actually learning
770.568	more about the object
772.771	when I change my perspective.
774.32	I can use this as a tool
774.32	for creating understanding.
778.548	I can take two of these
778.548	and put them together like this
782.164	and see what happens.
783.865	And it looks a little bit
783.865	like the octahedron.
787.3	Have a look at it if I spin
787.3	it around like this.
789.802	What happens?
791.008	Well, if you take two of these,
791.008	join them together and spin it around,
794.376	there's your octahedron again,
796.801	a beautiful structure.
798.456	If you lay it out flat on the floor,
800.644	this is the octahedron.
801.885	This is the graph structure
801.885	of an octahedron.
805.255	And I can continue doing this.
807.652	You can draw three great circles
807.652	around the octahedron,
811.203	and you rotate around,
813.077	so actually three great circles
813.077	is related to the octahedron.
817.562	And if I take a bicycle pump
817.562	and just pump it up,
821.245	you can see that this is also
821.245	a little bit like the octahedron.
824.801	Do you see what I'm doing here?
827.121	I am changing the perspective every time.
830.801	So let's now take a step back --
833.475	and that's actually
833.475	a metaphor, stepping back --
836.536	and have a look at what we're doing.
838.923	I'm playing around with metaphors.
840.611	I'm playing around
840.611	with perspectives and analogies.
843.107	I'm telling one story in different ways.
845.472	I'm telling stories.
846.706	I'm making a narrative;
846.706	I'm making several narratives.
849.914	And I think all of these things
849.914	make understanding possible.
853.46	I think this actually is the essence
853.46	of understanding something.
856.863	I truly believe this.
858.181	So this thing about changing
858.181	your perspective --
860.608	it's absolutely fundamental for humans.
863.829	Let's play around with the Earth.
865.474	Let's zoom into the ocean,
865.474	have a look at the ocean.
868.007	We can do this with anything.
869.973	We can take the ocean
869.973	and view it up close.
872.457	We can look at the waves.
874.415	We can go to the beach.
875.651	We can view the ocean
875.651	from another perspective.
877.938	Every time we do this, we learn
877.938	a little bit more about the ocean.
881.152	If we go to the shore,
881.152	we can kind of smell it, right?
883.765	We can hear the sound of the waves.
885.499	We can feel salt on our tongues.
887.569	So all of these
887.569	are different perspectives.
890.483	And this is the best one.
891.771	We can go into the water.
893.438	We can see the water from the inside.
895.471	And you know what?
896.673	This is absolutely essential
896.673	in mathematics and computer science.
899.778	If you're able to view
899.778	a structure from the inside,
902.757	then you really learn something about it.
905.351	That's somehow the essence of something.
907.883	So when we do this,
907.883	and we've taken this journey
911.55	into the ocean,
912.747	we use our imagination.
914.661	And I think this is one level deeper,
917.338	and it's actually a requirement
917.338	for changing your perspective.
921.818	We can do a little game.
923.009	You can imagine that you're sitting there.
925.074	You can imagine that you're up here,
925.074	and that you're sitting here.
928.325	You can view yourselves from the outside.
930.675	That's really a strange thing.
932.637	You're changing your perspective.
934.484	You're using your imagination,
936.367	and you're viewing yourself
936.367	from the outside.
939.073	That requires imagination.
941.126	Mathematics and computer science
941.126	are the most imaginative art forms ever.
946.884	And this thing about changing perspectives
949.09	should sound a little bit familiar to you,
951.622	because we do it every day.
954.604	And then it's called empathy.
956.954	When I view the world
956.954	from your perspective,
960.939	I have empathy with you.
962.629	If I really, truly understand
964.501	what the world looks
964.501	like from your perspective,
967.603	I am empathetic.
969.098	That requires imagination.
971.827	And that is how we obtain understanding.
975.206	And this is all over mathematics
975.206	and this is all over computer science,
978.983	and there's a really deep connection
978.983	between empathy and these sciences.
985.288	So my conclusion is the following:
989.931	understanding something really deeply
992.177	has to do with the ability
992.177	to change your perspective.
995.894	So my advice to you is:
995.894	try to change your perspective.
999.507	You can study mathematics.
1001.08	It's a wonderful way to train your brain.
1004.663	Changing your perspective
1004.663	makes your mind more flexible.
1008.495	It makes you open to new things,
1010.353	and it makes you
1010.353	able to understand things.
1013.202	And to use yet another metaphor:
1015.243	have a mind like water.
1016.748	That's nice.
1017.923	Thank you.
1019.104	(Applause)
