21.26	Space,
23.26	we all know what it looks like.
25.26	We've been surrounded by images of space
27.26	our whole lives,
29.26	from the speculative images
31.26	of science fiction
33.26	to the inspirational visions of artists
36.26	to the increasingly beautiful pictures
39.26	made possible by complex technologies.
42.26	But whilst we have
44.26	an overwhelmingly vivid
46.26	visual understanding of space,
48.26	we have no sense of what space sounds like.
51.26	And indeed, most people associate space with silence.
55.26	But the story of how
57.26	we came to understand the universe
59.26	is just as much a story of listening
61.26	as it is by looking.
64.26	And yet despite this,
66.26	hardly any of us have ever heard space.
69.26	How many of you here
71.26	could describe the sound
73.26	of a single planet or star?
75.26	Well in case you've ever wondered,
77.26	this is what the Sun sounds like.
79.26	(Static)
93.26	(Crackling)
97.26	(Static)
103.26	(Crackling)
107.26	This is the planet Jupiter.
110.26	(Soft crackling)
130.26	And this is the space probe Cassini
133.26	pirouetting through the ice rings of Saturn.
137.26	(Crackling)
157.26	This is a a highly condensed clump
160.26	of neutral matter,
162.26	spinning in the distant universe.
166.26	(Tapping)
184.26	So my artistic practice
186.26	is all about listening
188.26	to the weird and wonderful noises
191.26	emitted by the magnificent celestial objects
194.26	that make up our universe.
197.26	And you may wonder,
199.26	how do we know what these sounds are?
201.26	How can we tell the difference
203.26	between the sound of the Sun
205.26	and the sound of a pulsar?
207.26	Well the answer
209.26	is the science of radio astronomy.
211.26	Radio astronomers
213.26	study radio waves from space
215.26	using sensitive antennas and receivers,
218.26	which give them precise information
220.26	about what an astronomical object is
223.26	and where it is in our night sky.
225.26	And just like the signals
227.26	that we send and receive here on Earth,
230.26	we can convert these transmissions into sound
233.26	using simple analog techniques.
236.26	And therefore, it's through listening
239.26	that we've come to uncover
241.26	some of the universe's most important secrets --
244.26	its scale, what it's made of
247.26	and even how old it is.
249.26	So today, I'm going to tell you a short story
252.26	of the history of the universe through listening.
255.26	It's punctuated
257.26	by three quick anecdotes,
259.26	which show how accidental encounters
261.26	with strange noises
263.26	gave us some of the most important information
266.26	we have about space.
268.26	Now this story doesn't start
270.26	with vast telescopes
272.26	or futuristic spacecraft,
275.26	but a rather more humble technology --
278.26	and in fact, the very medium
280.26	which gave us the telecommunications revolution
283.26	that we're all part of today:
285.26	the telephone.
287.26	It's 1876, it's in Boston,
290.26	and this is Alexander Graham Bell
292.26	who was working with Thomas Watson
294.26	on the invention of the telephone.
297.26	A key part of their technical set up
300.26	was a half-mile long length of wire,
302.26	which was thrown across the rooftops
304.26	of several houses in Boston.
307.26	The line carried the telephone signals
310.26	that would later make Bell a household name.
313.26	But like any long length of charged wire,
316.26	it also inadvertently became
318.26	an antenna.
320.26	Thomas Watson
322.26	spent hours listening
324.26	to the strange crackles and hisses
326.26	and chirps and whistles
329.26	that his accidental antenna detected.
332.26	Now you have to remember,
334.26	this is 10 years before
336.26	Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of radio waves --
343.26	nearly 20 years before Marconi's first broadcast.
347.26	So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.
350.26	We didn't have the technology
352.26	to transmit.
354.26	So what were these strange noises?
358.26	Watson was in fact listening
360.26	to very low-frequency radio emissions
362.26	caused by nature.
364.26	Some of the crackles and pops were lightning,
367.26	but the eerie whistles
370.26	and curiously melodious chirps
373.26	had a rather more exotic origin.
376.26	Using the very first telephone,
378.26	Watson was in fact
380.26	dialed into the heavens.
382.26	As he correctly guessed,
384.26	some of these sounds were caused
386.26	by activity on the surface of the Sun.
389.26	It was a solar wind
391.26	interacting with our ionosphere
393.26	that he was listening to --
395.26	a phenomena which we can see
397.26	at the extreme northern and southern latitudes of our planet
400.26	as the aurora.
402.26	So whilst inventing the technology
405.26	that would usher in the telecommunications revolution,
409.26	Watson had discovered
411.26	that the star at the center of our solar system
414.26	emitted powerful radio waves.
417.26	He had accidentally been the first person
420.26	to tune in to them.
422.26	Fast-forward 50 years,
424.26	and Bell and Watson's technology
427.26	has completely transformed
429.26	global communications.
431.26	But going from slinging some wire
433.26	across rooftops in Boston
435.26	to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable
438.26	on the Atlantic Ocean seabed
440.26	is no easy matter.
442.26	And so before long,
444.26	Bell were looking to new technologies
446.26	to optimize their revolution.
449.26	Radio could carry sound without wires.
452.26	But the medium is lossy --
454.26	it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.
458.26	So Bell employed an engineer
460.26	to study those noises,
462.26	to try and find out where they came from,
464.26	with a view towards building
466.26	the perfect hardware codec, which would get rid of them
469.26	so they could think about using radio
471.26	for the purposes of telephony.
474.26	Most of the noises
476.26	that the engineer, Karl Jansky, investigated
479.26	were fairly prosaic in origin.
481.26	They turned out to be lightning
483.26	or sources of electrical power.
486.26	But there was one persistent noise
489.26	that Jansky couldn't identify,
491.26	and it seemed to appear
493.26	in his radio headset
495.26	four minutes earlier each day.
498.26	Now any astronomer will tell you,
500.26	this is the telltale sign
502.26	of something that doesn't originate from Earth.
505.26	Jansky had made a historic discovery,
509.26	that celestial objects could emit radio waves
512.26	as well as light waves.
514.26	Fifty years on
516.26	from Watson's accidental encounter with the Sun,
519.26	Jansky's careful listening
521.26	ushered in a new age of space exploration:
524.26	the radio astronomy age.
526.26	Over the next few years,
528.26	astronomers connected up their antennas to loudspeakers
532.26	and learned about our radio sky,
534.26	about Jupiter and the Sun,
536.26	by listening.
538.26	Let's jump ahead again.
540.26	It's 1964,
542.26	and we're back at Bell Labs.
544.26	And once again,
546.26	two scientists have got a problem with noise.
549.26	Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson
552.26	were using the horn antenna
554.26	at Bell's Holmdel laboratory
556.26	to study the Milky Way
558.26	with extraordinary precision.
560.26	They were really listening
562.26	to the galaxy in high fidelity.
564.26	There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
567.26	A mysterious persistent noise
570.26	was disrupting their research.
572.26	It was in the microwave range,
574.26	and it appeared to be coming
576.26	from all directions simultaneously.
578.26	Now this didn't make any sense,
580.26	and like any reasonable engineer or scientist,
583.26	they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself,
586.26	it must be the dish.
588.26	There were pigeons roosting in the dish.
591.26	And so perhaps once they cleaned up the pigeon droppings,
594.26	get the disk kind of operational again,
596.26	normal operations would resume.
599.26	But the noise didn't disappear.
602.26	The mysterious noise
604.26	that Penzias and Wilson were listening to
607.26	turned out to be the oldest and most significant sound
610.26	that anyone had ever heard.
612.26	It was cosmic radiation
614.26	left over from the very birth of the universe.
618.26	This was the first experimental evidence
621.26	that the Big Bang existed
623.26	and the universe was born at a precise moment
626.26	some 14.7 billion years ago.
631.26	So our story ends
633.26	at the beginning --
635.26	the beginning of all things, the Big Bang.
638.26	This is the noise that Penzias and Wilson heard --
641.26	the oldest sound that you're ever going to hear,
644.26	the cosmic microwave background radiation
647.26	left over from the Big Bang.
649.26	(Fuzz)
664.26	Thanks.
666.26	(Applause)
