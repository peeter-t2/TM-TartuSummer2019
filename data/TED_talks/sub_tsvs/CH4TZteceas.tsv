16.133	A couple of years ago,
17.315	when I was attending
17.315	the TED conference in Long Beach,
20.448	I met Harriet.
21.837	We'd actually met online before --
21.837	not the way you're thinking.
25.26	We were introduced
25.26	because we both knew Linda Avey,
27.719	one of the founders of the first
27.719	online personal genomic companies.
31.047	And because we shared
31.047	our genetic information with Linda,
33.768	she could see that Harriet and I shared
35.699	a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA,
35.699	haplotype K1a1b1a,
39.613	which meant we were distantly related.
41.632	We actually share the same
41.632	genealogy with Ötzi the Iceman.
44.489	So -- Ötzi, Harriet and me.
46.024	And being the current day, of course,
46.024	we started our own Facebook group.
49.449	You're all welcome to join.
50.772	When I met Harriet in person
50.772	the next year at the TED conference,
53.876	she'd gone online and ordered
53.876	our own happy haplotype T-shirts.
56.888	(Laughter)
57.923	Why am I telling you this story?
59.49	What does it have to do
59.49	with the future of health?
61.856	Well, the way I met Harriet is an example
63.856	of how leveraging cross-disciplinary,
63.856	exponentially growing technologies
67.631	is affecting our future
67.631	of health and wellness --
69.966	from low-cost gene analysis
71.34	to the ability to do
71.34	powerful bioinformatics
73.482	to the connection of the Internet
73.482	and social networking.
76.849	What I'd like to talk about today
78.473	is understanding
78.473	these exponential technologies.
80.757	We often think linearly.
82.338	But if you think about it,
82.338	if you have a lily pad
84.95	and it just divided every single day --
86.937	two, four, eight, sixteen --
86.937	in 15 days, you'd have 32,000.
90.617	What do you think you'd have in a month?
92.576	We're at a billion.
93.751	If we start to think exponentially,
95.447	we can see how this is starting to affect
95.447	all the technologies around us.
98.923	Many of these technologies,
98.923	speaking as a physician and innovator,
102.05	we can start to leverage,
102.05	to impact the future of our own health
105.166	and of health care,
106.341	and to address many of the major
106.341	challenges in health care today,
109.45	ranging from the exponential costs
109.45	to the aging population,
112.639	the way we really don't use
112.639	information very well today,
115.363	the fragmentation of care
116.877	and the often very difficult course
116.877	of adoption of innovation.
120.631	And one of the major things we can do
120.631	is move the curve to the left.
124.45	We spend most of our money
124.45	on the last 20 percent of life.
127.191	What if we could incentivize physicians
127.191	in the health care system
130.275	and our own selves
131.455	to move the curve to the left
131.455	and improve our health,
133.994	leveraging technology as well?
135.462	Now my favorite example
135.462	of exponential technology,
137.91	we all have in our pocket.
139.234	If you think about it,
139.234	these are really dramatically improving.
142.529	I mean, this is the iPhone 4.
144.459	Imagine what the iPhone 8
144.459	will be able to do.
147.671	Now, I've gained some insight into this.
149.613	I've been the track share
149.613	for the medicine portion
152.212	of a new institution
152.212	called Singularity University,
154.743	based in Silicon Valley.
156.156	We bring together each summer
156.156	about 100 very talented students
159.14	from around the world.
160.33	And we look at these exponential
160.33	technologies from medicine,
163.22	biotech, artificial intelligence,
163.22	robotics, nanotechnology, space,
166.39	and address how we can cross-train
166.39	and leverage these
168.893	to impact major unmet goals.
170.257	We also have seven-day executive programs.
172.288	And coming up next month is FutureMed,
174.695	a program to help cross-train
174.695	and leverage technologies into medicine.
178.093	Now, I mentioned the phone.
179.638	These mobile phones have over 20,000
179.638	different mobile apps available.
182.973	There's one out of the UK
182.973	where you can pee on a little chip,
186.239	connect it to your iPhone,
187.544	and check for an STD.
188.723	I don't know if I'd try that,
188.723	but it's available.
191.05	There are other sorts of applications.
192.899	Merging your phone
192.899	and diagnostics, for example,
195.199	measuring your blood glucose
195.199	on your iPhone
197.264	and sending that to your physician,
198.995	so they can better understand
198.995	and you can better understand
201.786	your blood sugars as a diabetic.
203.39	So let's see how exponential
203.39	technologies are taking health care.
206.535	Let's start with faster.
207.725	It's no secret that computers,
207.725	through Moore's law,
210.158	are speeding up faster and faster.
211.825	We can do more powerful things with them.
213.91	They're really approaching --
213.91	in many cases, surpassing --
216.735	the ability of the human mind.
218.205	But where I think computational speed
218.205	is most applicable is in imaging.
222.063	The ability now to look
222.063	inside the body in real time
224.719	with very high resolution
226.201	is really becoming incredible.
227.685	And we're layering multiple
227.685	technologies -- PET scans, CT scans
230.745	and molecular diagnostics --
232.791	to find and seek things
232.791	at different levels.
235.616	Here you're going to see the very highest
235.616	resolution MRI scan done today,
239.091	of Marc Hodosh, the curator of TEDMED.
241.934	And now we can see inside of the brain
244.101	at a resolution and ability
244.101	never before available,
246.717	and essentially learn how to reconstruct
246.717	and maybe even reengineer
250.807	or backwards engineer the brain,
252.515	so we can better understand
252.515	pathology, disease and therapy.
255.516	We can look inside with real-time
255.516	fMRI in the brain at real time.
258.832	And by understanding these sorts
258.832	of processes and these connections,
262.145	we're going to understand the effects
262.145	of medication or meditation
265.232	and better personalize
265.232	and make effective, for example,
267.863	psychoactive drugs.
269.49	The scanners for these are getting
269.49	smaller, less expensive
272.282	and more portable.
273.457	And this sort of data explosion
273.457	available from these
275.952	is really almost becoming a challenge.
277.91	The scan of today takes up
277.91	about 800 books, or 20 gigabytes.
280.911	The scan in a couple of years
280.911	will be one terabyte, or 800,000 books.
284.206	How do you leverage that information?
285.999	Let's get personal.
287.174	I won't ask who here's had a colonoscopy,
287.174	but if you're over age 50,
290.405	it's time for your screening colonoscopy.
292.422	How'd you like to avoid
292.422	the pointy end of the stick?
294.877	Now there's essentially
294.877	virtual colonoscopy.
296.952	Compare those two pictures.
298.267	As a radiologist, you can basically
298.267	fly through your patient's colon,
301.558	and augmenting that
301.558	with artificial intelligence,
303.877	potentially identify a lesion
303.877	that we might have missed,
306.53	but using AI on top of radiology,
308.13	we can find lesions
308.13	that were missed before.
310.205	Maybe this will encourage
310.205	people to get colonoscopies
312.756	that wouldn't have otherwise.
314.163	This is an example of this paradigm shift.
316.199	We're moving to this integration
316.199	of biomedicine, information technology,
319.624	wireless and, I would say, mobile now --
319.624	this era of digital medicine.
322.954	Even my stethoscope is now digital,
322.954	and of course, there's an app for that.
326.522	We're moving, obviously,
326.522	to the era of the tricorder.
329.081	So the handheld ultrasound
329.081	is basically surpassing
331.554	and supplanting the stethoscope.
333.576	These are now at a price point
333.576	of what used to be 100,000 euros
336.562	or a couple hundred-thousand dollars.
338.425	For about 5,000 dollars,
339.602	I can have the power of a very powerful
339.602	diagnostic device in my hand.
342.952	Merging this now with the advent
342.952	of electronic medical records --
346.068	in the US, we're still
346.068	less than 20 percent electronic;
348.673	here in the Netherlands,
348.673	I think it's more than 80 percent.
351.493	Now that we're switching
351.493	to merging medical data,
353.805	making it available electronically,
355.504	we can crowd-source the information,
355.504	and as a physician,
358.176	I can access my patients' data
358.176	from wherever I am,
360.536	just through my mobile device.
361.99	And now, of course, we're in the era
361.99	of the iPad, even the iPad 2.
365.127	Just last month,
366.302	the first FDA-approved
366.302	application was approved
368.541	to allow radiologists to do actual
368.541	reading on these sorts of devices.
372.058	So certainly, the physicians
372.058	of today, including myself,
374.703	are completely reliable on these devices.
376.704	And as you saw just about a month ago,
378.547	Watson from IBM beat
378.547	"the two champions in ""Jeopardy."""
381.064	So I want you to imagine
381.064	when, in a couple of years,
383.526	we've started to apply
383.526	this cloud-based information,
386.01	when we really have the AI physician
386.01	and leverage our brains to connectivity
389.634	to make decisions and diagnostics
389.634	at a level never done.
392.608	Already today, you don't need to go
392.608	to your physician in many cases.
395.831	Only in about 20 percent of visits
395.831	do you need to lay hands on the patient.
399.397	We're now in the era of virtual visits.
401.282	From Skype-type visits
401.282	you can do with American Well,
403.799	to Cisco, that's developed a very complex
403.799	health presence system,
406.88	the ability to interact with
406.88	your health care provider is different.
410.111	And these are being augmented
410.111	even by our devices, again, today.
413.16	My friend Jessica sent me
413.16	a picture of her head laceration,
415.953	so I can save her a trip
415.953	to the emergency room,
418.185	and do diagnostics that way.
419.638	Or maybe we can leverage
419.638	today's gaming technology,
422.056	like the Microsoft Kinect,
423.326	hack that to enable diagnostics,
423.326	for example, in diagnosing stroke,
426.527	using simple motion detection,
426.527	using $100 devices.
429.14	We can actually now visit
429.14	our patients robotically.
432.349	This is the RP7;
433.524	if I'm a hematologist,
433.524	I can visit another clinic or hospital.
436.506	These are being augmented
436.506	by a whole suite of tools
438.925	actually in the home now.
440.145	We already have wireless scales.
442.023	You step on the scale,
442.023	tweet your weight to your friends,
444.752	they can keep you in line.
446.018	We have wireless blood pressure cuffs.
447.86	A whole gamut of technologies
447.86	are being put together.
450.391	Instead of wearing kludgy devices,
450.391	we put on a simple patch.
453.229	This was developed at Stanford.
454.746	It's called iRhythm; it completely
454.746	supplants the prior technology
457.849	at a much lower price point,
457.849	with much more effectivity.
460.525	We're also in the era today
460.525	of quantified self.
463.024	Consumers now can basically buy
463.024	$100 devices, like this little Fitbit.
466.653	I can measure my steps,
466.653	my caloric outtake.
468.698	I can get insight into that
468.698	on a daily basis
470.775	and share it with my friends or physician.
472.807	There's watches that measure
472.807	your heart rate, Zeo sleep monitors,
475.91	a suite of tools
475.91	that enable you to leverage
478.017	and have insight into your own health.
479.855	As we start to integrate this information,
481.887	we'll know better what to do with it,
481.887	and have better insight
484.792	into our own pathologies,
484.792	health and wellness.
487.243	There's even mirrors
487.243	that can pick up your pulse rate.
489.91	And I would argue, in the future,
491.693	we'll have wearable devices
491.693	in our clothes, monitoring us 24/7.
494.879	And just like the OnStar system
494.879	in cars, your red light might go on.
498.32	"It won't say ""check engine"";"
498.32	"it'll be a ""check your body"" light,"
501.389	and you'll go get it taken care of.
503.097	Probably in a few years,
504.294	you'll look in your mirror
504.294	and it'll be diagnosing you.
507.124	(Laughter)
508.37	For those of you with kiddos at home,
510.473	how would you like a wireless
510.473	diaper that supports your --
513.442	(Laughter)
514.526	More information, I think,
514.526	than you might need,
516.747	but it's going to be here.
518.208	Now, we've heard a lot today
518.208	about technology and connection.
521.332	And I think some of these technologies
523.168	will enable us to be more connected
523.168	with our patients, to take more time
526.61	and do the important
526.61	human-touch elements of medicine,
529.215	as augmented by these technologies.
530.917	Now, we've talked about
530.917	augmenting the patient.
533.31	How about augmenting the physician?
535.01	We're now in the era
535.01	of super-enabling the surgeon,
537.424	who can now go into the body and do
537.424	robotic surgery, which is here today,
540.91	at a level that was not really possible
540.91	even five years ago.
544.397	And now this is being augmented
544.397	with further layers of technology,
547.541	like augmented reality.
548.72	So the surgeon can see
548.72	inside the patient, through their lens,
551.675	where the tumor is,
551.675	where the blood vessels are.
554.01	This can be integrated
554.01	with decision support.
556.139	A surgeon in New York can help
556.139	a surgeon in Amsterdam, for example.
559.324	And we're entering an era
559.324	of truly scarless surgery called NOTES,
562.724	where the robotic endoscope
562.724	can come out the stomach
565.339	and pull out that gallbladder,
566.811	all in a scarless way and robotically.
569.186	This is called NOTES, and it's coming --
569.186	basically scarless surgery,
572.526	as mediated by robotic surgery.
574.608	Now, how about controlling other elements?
576.728	For those who have
576.728	disabilities -- the paraplegic,
579.182	there's the brain-computer
579.182	interface, or BCI,
581.993	where chips have been put
581.993	on the motor cortex
584.206	of completely quadriplegic patients,
586.05	and they can control
586.05	a cursor or a wheelchair
588.734	or, potentially, a robotic arm.
590.291	These devices are getting smaller
591.911	and going into more and more
591.911	of these patients.
594.162	Still in clinical trials,
595.398	but imagine when we can connect
595.398	these, for example,
597.823	to the amazing bionic limb,
599.463	such as the DEKA Arm,
599.463	built by Dean Kamen and colleagues,
602.309	which has 17 degrees
602.309	of motion and freedom,
604.353	and can allow the person who's lost a limb
606.405	to have much higher dexterity or control
606.405	than they've had in the past.
609.764	So we're really entering the era
609.764	of wearable robotics, actually.
612.832	If you haven't lost a limb
612.832	but had a stroke,
615.07	you can wear these augmented limbs.
616.781	Or if you're a paraplegic -- I've visited
616.781	the folks at Berkeley Bionics --
620.301	they've developed eLEGS.
621.494	I took this video last week.
622.884	Here's a paraplegic patient, walking
622.884	by strapping on these exoskeletons.
626.693	He's otherwise completely
626.693	wheelchair-bound.
628.728	This is the early era
628.728	of wearable robotics.
630.768	And by leveraging
630.768	these sorts of technologies,
633.071	we're going to change
633.071	the definition of disability
635.432	to, in some cases, be superability,
635.432	or super-enabling.
637.986	This is Aimee Mullins, who lost
637.986	her lower limbs as a young child,
641.2	and Hugh Herr, who's a professor at MIT,
643.537	who lost his limbs in a climbing accident.
645.562	And now both of them can climb better,
645.562	move faster, swim differently
648.981	with their prosthetics
648.981	than us normal-abled persons.
652.492	How about other exponentials?
653.956	Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially
653.956	going in the wrong direction,
657.39	including with huge costs.
658.849	But the trend in medicine
658.849	is to get exponentially smaller.
661.996	A few examples: we're now in the era
661.996	"of ""Fantastic Voyage,"" the iPill."
665.595	You can swallow this
665.595	completely integrated device.
668.02	It can take pictures of your GI system,
669.91	help diagnose and treat
669.91	as it moves through your GI tract.
672.69	We get into even smaller micro-robots
674.533	that will eventually, autonomously,
674.533	move through your system,
677.454	and be able to do things surgeons can't do
679.535	in a much less invasive manner.
681.095	Sometimes these might
681.095	self-assemble in your GI system,
683.708	and be augmented in that reality.
685.456	On the cardiac side,
685.456	pacemakers are getting smaller
687.972	and much easier to place,
689.333	so no need to train an interventional
689.333	cardiologist to place them.
692.44	And they'll be wirelessly telemetered
692.44	to your mobile devices,
695.4	so you can go places
695.4	and be monitored remotely.
697.91	These are shrinking even further.
699.532	This one is in prototyping
699.532	by Medtronic; it's smaller than a penny.
702.812	Artificial retinas, the ability to put
702.812	arrays on the back of the eyeball
706.261	and allow the blind to see --
707.709	also in early trials,
707.709	but moving into the future.
710.044	These are going to be game-changing.
711.799	Or for those of us who are sighted,
713.511	how about having
713.511	the assisted-living contact lens?
715.897	Bluetooth, Wi-Fi available --
715.897	beams back images to your eye.
718.743	(Laughter)
719.79	Now, if you have trouble
719.79	maintaining your diet,
722.017	it might help to have some extra imagery
723.997	to remind you how many calories
723.997	are going to be coming at you.
727.655	How about enabling the pathologist
727.655	to use their cell phone
730.43	to see at a microscopic level
732	and to lumber that data back to the cloud
732	and make better diagnostics?
735.338	In fact, the whole era
735.338	of laboratory medicine
737.648	is completely changing.
738.824	We can now leverage microfluidics,
740.801	like this chip made
740.801	by Steve Quake at Stanford.
743.042	Microfluidics can replace
743.042	an entire lab of technicians;
745.702	put it on a chip, enable thousands
745.702	of tests at the point of care,
748.865	anywhere in the world.
750.041	This will really leverage technology
750.041	to the rural and the underserved
753.469	and enable what used to be thousand-dollar
753.469	tests to be done for pennies,
757.008	and at the point of care.
758.384	If we go down the small
758.384	pathway a little bit further,
760.909	we're entering the era of nanomedicine,
762.832	the ability to make devices super-small,
764.778	to the point where we can
764.778	design red blood cells
767.122	or microrobots that monitor
767.122	our blood system or immune system,
770.221	or even those that might clear out
770.221	the clots from our arteries.
773.333	Now how about exponentially cheaper?
775.097	Not something we usually think
775.097	about in the era of medicine,
777.954	but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars
777.954	for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper.
781.882	In genomics now, the genome
781.882	cost about a billion dollars
784.568	about 10 years ago,
784.568	when the first one came out.
786.851	We're now approaching essentially
786.851	a $1,000 genome, probably next year.
790.239	And in two years, a $100 genome.
791.796	What will we do with $100 genomes?
793.544	Soon we'll have millions
793.544	of these tests available.
795.922	Then it gets interesting, when we start
795.922	to crowd-source that information,
799.437	and enter the era
799.437	of true personalized medicine:
801.707	the right drug for the right person
801.707	at the right time,
804.263	instead of what we're doing now,
804.263	which is the same drug for everybody,
807.58	blockbuster drug medications,
807.58	which don't work for the individual.
810.71	Many different companies are working
810.71	on leveraging these approaches.
813.953	I'll show you a simple example,
813.953	from 23andMe again.
816.382	My data indicates
816.382	I've got about average risk
818.516	for developing macular degeneration,
818.516	a kind of blindness.
821.231	But if I take that same data,
821.231	upload it to deCODEme,
823.881	I can look at my risk for type 2 diabetes;
823.881	I'm at almost twice the risk.
828.16	I might want to watch how much dessert
828.16	I have at lunch, for example.
831.401	It might change my behavior.
832.776	Leveraging my knowledge
832.776	of my pharmacogenomics:
835.042	how my genes modulate,
835.042	what my drugs do and what doses I need
838.401	will become increasingly important,
840.116	and once in the hands
840.116	of individuals and patients,
842.491	will make better drug dosing
842.491	and selection available.
845.037	So again, it's not just genes,
845.037	it's multiple details --
847.903	our habits, our environmental exposures.
850.046	When was the last time your doctor
850.046	asked where you've lived?
852.881	Geomedicine: where you live,
852.881	what you've been exposed to,
855.616	can dramatically affect your health.
857.357	We can capture that information.
858.912	Genomics, proteomics, the environment --
860.845	all this data streaming at us
860.845	individually and as physicians:
863.734	How do we manage it?
864.91	We're now entering the era
864.91	of systems medicine, systems biology,
867.996	where we can start to integrate
867.996	all this information.
870.521	And by looking at the patterns,
870.521	for example, in our blood,
873.353	of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test,
875.19	we can look at patterns and detect disease
875.19	at a much earlier stage.
878.749	This is called by Lee Hood,
878.749	the father of the field, P4 Medicine.
882.207	We'll be predictive and know
882.207	what you're likely to have.
884.857	We can be preventative;
884.857	that prevention can be personalized.
887.704	More importantly,
887.704	it'll be increasingly participatory.
890.257	Through websites like PatientsLikeMe
892.12	or managing your data on Microsoft
892.12	HealthVault or Google Health,
895.255	leveraging this together
895.255	in participatory ways
897.426	will be increasingly important.
898.934	I'll finish up with exponentially better.
900.914	We'd like to get therapies
900.914	better and more effective.
903.455	Today we treat high blood pressure
903.455	mostly with pills.
905.96	What if we take a new device,
907.371	knock out the nerve vessels
907.371	that help mediate blood pressure,
910.281	and in a single therapy,
910.281	basically cure hypertension?
912.91	This is a new device
912.91	doing essentially that.
914.995	It should be on the market
914.995	in a year or two.
917.081	How about more targeted
917.081	therapies for cancer?
919.209	I'm an oncologist and know that most
919.209	of what we give is essentially poison.
922.782	We learned at Stanford and other places
922.782	that we can discover cancer stem cells,
926.595	the ones that seem to be really
926.595	responsible for disease relapse.
929.847	So if you think of cancer as a weed,
931.79	we often can whack the weed away
931.79	and it seems to shrink,
934.707	but it often comes back.
935.899	So we're attacking the wrong target.
937.66	The cancer stem cells remain,
939.146	and the tumor can return
939.146	months or years later.
941.426	We're now learning to identify
941.426	the cancer stem cells
943.931	and identify those as targets
943.931	and go for the long-term cure.
947.071	We're entering the era
947.071	of personalized oncology,
949.388	the ability to leverage
949.388	all of this data together,
951.775	analyze the tumor
952.95	and come up with a real, specific cocktail
952.95	for the individual patient.
956.288	I'll close with regenerative medicine.
958.145	I've studied a lot about stem cells.
959.911	Embryonic stem cells
959.911	are particularly powerful.
962.137	We have adult stem cells
962.137	throughout our body;
964.272	we use those in bone marrow
964.272	transplantation.
966.421	Geron, last year, started the first trial
966.421	using human embryonic stem cells
970.247	to treat spinal cord injuries.
971.836	Still a phase I trial, but evolving.
973.91	We've been using adult stem cells
973.91	in clinical trials for about 15 years
977.707	to approach a whole range of topics,
977.707	particularly cardiovascular disease.
981.31	If we take our own bone marrow cells
981.31	and treat a patient with a heart attack,
985.05	we can see much improved
985.05	heart function and better survival
987.986	using our own bone marrow derived cells
987.986	after a heart attack.
990.963	I invented a device
990.963	called the MarrowMiner,
993.023	a much less invasive way
993.023	for harvesting bone marrow.
995.484	It's now been FDA approved;
995.484	hopefully on the market in the next year.
998.767	Hopefully you can appreciate the device
1000.668	going through the patient's body removing
1000.668	bone marrow, not with 200 punctures,
1004.462	but with a single puncture,
1004.462	under local anesthesia.
1006.879	Where is stem-cell therapy going?
1008.487	If you think about it,
1009.662	every cell in your body has the same DNA
1009.662	you had when you were an embryo.
1013.161	We can now reprogram your skin cells
1015.129	to actually act like a pluripotent
1015.129	embryonic stem cell
1018.066	and utilize those, potentially, to treat
1018.066	multiple organs in the same patient,
1021.738	making personalized stem cell lines.
1023.485	I think there'll be a new era
1023.485	of your own stem cell banking
1026.294	to have in the freezer your own cardiac
1026.294	cells, myocytes and neural cells
1029.786	to use them in the future,
1029.786	should you need them.
1032.163	We're integrating this now
1032.163	with a whole era of cellular engineering,
1035.409	and integrating exponential technologies
1035.409	for essentially 3D organ printing,
1039.001	replacing the ink with cells,
1040.709	and essentially building
1040.709	and reconstructing a 3D organ.
1043.53	That's where things are heading.
1045.08	Still very early days,
1046.265	but I think, as integration
1046.265	of exponential technologies,
1049.036	this is the example.
1050.224	So in closing, as you think
1050.224	about technology trends
1052.735	and how to impact health and medicine,
1054.599	we're entering an era of miniaturization,
1056.6	decentralization and personalization.
1058.846	And by pulling these things together,
1060.678	if we start to think about
1060.678	how to understand and leverage them,
1063.687	we're going to empower the patient,
1063.687	enable the doctor, enhance wellness
1067.062	and begin to cure the well
1067.062	before they get sick.
1069.533	Because I know as a doctor, if someone
1069.533	comes to me with stage I disease,
1073.095	I'm thrilled; we can often cure them.
1074.91	But often it's too late,
1076.104	and it's stage III or IV
1076.104	cancer, for example.
1078.257	So by leveraging
1078.257	these technologies together,
1080.396	I think we'll enter a new era
1080.396	that I like to call stage 0 medicine.
1083.657	And as a cancer doctor,
1083.657	I'm looking forward to being out of a job.
1086.95	Thanks very much.
1088.196	(Applause)
1090.198	Host: Thank you. Thank you.
1091.919	(Applause)
1093.743	Take a bow, take a bow.
