12.964	When, in 1960, still a student,
15.734	I got a traveling fellowship
18.159	to study housing in North America.
21.22	We traveled the country.
23.504	We saw public housing high-rise buildings
26.609	in all major cities:
28.95	New York, Philadelphia.
31.03	Those who have no choice lived there.
33.999	And then we traveled from suburb to suburb,
36.294	and I came back thinking,
38.342	we've got to reinvent the apartment building.
40.996	There has to be another way of doing this.
43.675	We can't sustain suburbs,
45.71	so let's design a building
48.275	which gives the qualities of a house
51.518	to each unit.
52.689	Habitat would be all about gardens,
56.85	contact with nature,
58.755	streets instead of corridors.
60.939	We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,
64.737	and there it is almost 50 years later.
69.98	It's a very desirable place to live in.
73.351	It's now a heritage building,
75.81	but it did not proliferate.
79.413	In 1973, I made my first trip to China.
84.117	It was the Cultural Revolution.
88.383	We traveled the country,
90.531	met with architects and planners.
93.76	This is Beijing then,
95.976	not a single high rise building
98.848	in Beijing or Shanghai.
101.132	Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.
104.99	There were hardly any cars.
108.269	Thirty years later,
110.92	this is Beijing today.
113.915	This is Hong Kong.
115.628	If you're wealthy, you live there,
118.128	if you're poor, you live there,
120.548	but high density it is, and it's not just Asia.
123.214	SÃ£o Paulo, you can travel
125.171	in a helicopter 45 minutes
127.695	seeing those high-rise buildings consume
129.705	the 19th-century low-rise environment.
132.341	And with it, comes congestion,
134.652	and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.
138.674	So a few years ago, we decided to go back
141.224	and rethink Habitat.
143.138	Could we make it more affordable?
145.827	Could we actually achieve this quality of life
148.89	in the densities that are prevailing today?
153.297	And we realized, it's basically about light,
156.16	it's about sun, it's about nature,
159.222	it's about fractalization.
161.402	Can we open up the surface of the building
164.631	so that it has more contact with the exterior?
167.499	We came up with a number of models:
169.738	economy models, cheaper to build and more compact;
173.574	membranes of housing
175.621	where people could design their own house
177.98	and create their own gardens.
180.087	And then we decided to take New York as a test case,
183.968	and we looked at Lower Manhattan.
186.015	And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.
189.84	On the left is Manhattan today:
193.215	blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.
197.602	On the right, we reconfigured it:
200.201	the office buildings form the base,
202.518	and then rising 75 stories above,
205.781	are apartments.
207.16	There's a street in the air on the 25th level,
210.136	a community street.
212.15	It's permeable.
213.759	There are gardens and open spaces
215.712	for the community,
217.156	almost every unit with its own private garden,
220.365	and community space all around.
223.027	And most important, permeable, open.
226.187	It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,
229.584	and light permeates everywhere.
232.419	And in the last two or three years,
234.076	we've actually been, for the first time,
236.648	realizing the quality of life of Habitat
240.361	in real-life projects across Asia.
244.068	This in Qinhuangdao in China:
247.302	middle-income housing, where there is a bylaw
249.88	that every apartment must receive
252.587	three hours of sunlight.
255.343	That's measured in the winter solstice.
258.233	And under construction in Singapore,
261.66	again middle-income housing, gardens,
264.882	community streets and parks and so on and so forth.
268.748	And Colombo.
271.198	And I want to touch on one more issue,
273.414	which is the design of the public realm.
277.099	A hundred years after we've begun building
280.693	with tall buildings,
282.425	we are yet to understand
284.765	how the tall high-rise building
287.69	becomes a building block in making a city,
290.525	in creating the public realm.
293.348	In Singapore, we had an opportunity:
298.99	Taking the concept of outdoor and indoor,
303.112	promenades and parks integrated
305.363	with intense urban life.
307.545	So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,
311.133	and you move from one to the other,
313.11	and there is contact with nature,
315.217	and most relevantly, at every level of the structure,
319.188	public gardens and open space:
321.877	on the roof of the podium,
323.643	climbing up the towers,
325.442	and finally on the roof, the sky park,
329.38	two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,
332.754	and the world's longest swimming pool.
338.109	And that's all I can tell you in five minutes.
340.865	Thank you.
342.733	(Applause)
