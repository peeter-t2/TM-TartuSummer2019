12.746	Today, I want to talk to you about dreams.
15.999	I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,
18.74	and it's cooler than in the movies.
20.74	(Laughter)
22.707	Beyond flying, breathing fire,
25.439	and making hot men
25.439	spontaneously appear ...
28.304	(Laughter)
30.305	I can do things like read and write music.
33.344	Fun fact is that I wrote
33.344	my personal statement to college
36.699	in a dream.
38.043	And I did accepted. So, yeah.
41.873	I am a very visual thinker.
44.393	I think in pictures, not words.
47.174	To me, words are more like
47.174	instincts and language.
51.993	There are many people like me;
53.769	Nikola Tesla, for example,
56.307	who could visualize, design,
56.307	test, and troubleshoot everything --
61.346	all of his inventions --
61.346	in his mind, accurately.
66.633	Language is kind of exclusive
66.633	to our species, anyway.
69.999	I am a bit more primitive,
72.133	like a beta version of Google Translate.
74.725	(Laughter)
78.741	My brain has the ability
78.741	to hyper-focus on things that interest me.
83.307	For example, once
83.307	I had an affair with calculus
85.998	that lasted longer
85.998	than some celebrity marriages.
88.711	(Laughter)
92.527	There are some other
92.527	unusual things about me.
96.391	You may have noticed
96.391	that I don't have much inflection
99.241	in my voice.
100.479	That's why people
100.479	often confuse me with a GPS.
103.564	(Laughter)
108.034	This can make basic communication
108.034	a challenge, unless you need directions.
112.005	(Laughter)
116.444	Thank you.
117.642	(Applause)
122.6	A few years ago, when I started
122.6	doing presentations,
125.863	I went to get head shots done
125.863	for the first time.
129.381	The photographer told me to look flirty.
132.148	(Laughter)
134.441	And I had no idea
134.441	what she was talking about.
137.054	(Laughter)
138.724	"She said, ""Do that thing,"
138.724	you know, with your eyes,
141.176	"when you're flirting with guys."""
143.101	"""What thing?"" I asked."
145.608	"""You know, squint."""
147.553	And so I tried, really.
149.261	It looked something like this.
151.382	(Laughter)
153.867	I looked like I was searching for Waldo.
156.514	(Laughter)
160.582	There's a reason for this,
162.338	as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.
164.931	(Laughter)
172.918	I have Asperger's,
174.53	a high-functioning form of autism
176.546	that impairs the basic social skills
176.546	one is expected to display.
182.726	It's made life difficult in many ways,
185.834	and growing up,
185.834	I struggled to fit in socially.
189.955	My friends would tell jokes,
189.955	but I didn't understand them.
194.32	My personal heroes were George Carlin
194.32	and Stephen Colbert --
199	and they taught me humor.
202.881	My personality switched
202.881	from being shy and awkward
206.711	to being defiant and cursing out a storm.
210.322	Needless to say,
210.322	I did not have many friends.
213.714	I was also hypersensitive to texture.
216.722	The feel of water on my skin
216.722	was like pins and needles,
220.433	and so for years, I refused to shower.
223.251	I can assure you that my hygiene routine
223.251	is up to standards now, though.
227.243	(Laughter)
230.487	I had to do a lot to get here,
230.487	and my parents --
234.904	things kind of got out of control
234.904	when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,
239.557	and on top of everything,
239.557	it made a difficult situation worse.
245.27	And I had to travel 2,000 miles
245.27	across the country to get treatment,
250.857	but within days of them prescribing
250.857	a new medication,
254.555	my life turned into an episode
254.555	of the Walking Dead.
258.109	I became paranoid,
258.109	and began to hallucinate
261.245	that rotting corpses
261.245	were coming towards me.
264.769	My family finally rescued me,
267.635	but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds
267.635	in those three weeks,
272.348	as well as developing severe anemia,
274.801	and was on the verge of suicide.
278.18	I transferred to a new treatment center
278.18	that understood my aversions,
282.879	my trauma, and my social anxiety,
286.584	and they knew how to treat it,
286.584	and I got the help I finally needed.
290.202	And after 18 months of hard work,
292.798	I went on to do incredible things.
296.71	One of the things with Asperger's
296.71	is that oftentimes,
300.162	these people have
300.162	a very complex inner life,
302.279	and I know for myself,
302.279	I have a very colorful personality,
305.144	rich ideas, and just a lot
305.144	going on in my mind.
308.872	But there's a gap
308.872	between where that stands,
312.269	and how I communicate it
312.269	with the rest of the world.
315.416	And this can make
315.416	basic communication a challenge.
320.106	Not many places would hire me,
320.106	due to my lack of social skills,
323.389	which is why I applied to Waffle House.
325.713	(Laughter)
332.07	Waffle House is an exceptional
335.772	(Laughter)
337.749	(Applause)
341.027	thank you --
342.991	where you can order your hash browns
344.774	the many ways that someone
344.774	would dispose of a human corpse ...
347.951	(Laughter)
349.608	Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked,
349.608	topped, capped, and covered.
354.361	(Laughter)
356.488	As social norms would have it,
357.957	you should only go to Waffle House
357.957	at an ungodly hour in the night.
361.478	(Laughter)
362.653	So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting
362.653	with a waitress, and I asked her,
367.033	"""What's the most ridiculous thing"
367.033	"that's happened to you on the job?"""
370.873	And she told me that one time,
370.873	a man walked in completely naked.
374.16	(Laughter)
375.754	"I said, ""Great! Sign me up"
375.754	"for the graveyard shift!"""
378.286	(Laughter)
380.914	Needless to say,
380.914	Waffle House did not hire me.
385.838	So in terms of having Asperger's,
385.838	it can be viewed as a disadvantage,
390.242	and sometimes it is
390.242	a real pain in the butt,
392.433	but it's also the opposite.
394.211	It's a gift, and it allows me
394.211	to think innovatively.
398.81	At 19, I won a research competition
398.81	for my research on coral reefs,
405.664	and I ended up speaking
407.203	at the UN Convention
407.203	of Biological Diversity,
409.478	presenting this research.
410.998	(Applause)
412.71	Thank you.
413.892	(Applause)
418.814	And at 22, I'm getting ready
418.814	to graduate college,
422.833	and I am a co-founder of a biotech
422.833	company called AutismSees.
428.275	(Applause)
429.307	Thank you.
430.586	(Applause)
433.287	But consider what I had to do to get here:
	and years of pain and trauma.
442.698	I spent a lot of time thinking
442.698	if there's a better way,
445.793	and I think there is:
445.793	autism-assistive technology.
450.503	This technology
450.503	could play an integral role
452.544	in helping people
452.544	with autistic spectrum disorder,
455.423	or ASD.
458.465	The app Podium, released
458.465	by my company, AutismSees,
463.455	has the ability to independently assess
463.455	and help develop communication skills.
469.324	In addition to this, it tracks
469.324	eye contact through camera
473.67	and simulates a public-speaking
473.67	and job-interview experience.
480.561	And so maybe one day,
480.561	Waffle House will hire me,
483.142	after practicing on it some more.
485.346	(Laughter)
489.162	And one of the great things
489.162	is that I've used Podium
494.705	to help me prepare for today,
494.705	and it's been a great help.
499.815	But it's more than that.
501.466	There's more that can be done.
504.274	For people with ASD --
507.39	it has been speculated
507.39	that many innovative scientists,
511.931	researchers, artists,
511.931	and engineers have it;
516.546	like, for example, Emily Dickinson,
516.546	Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates
522.6	are some examples.
524.361	But the problem that's encountered
526.138	is that these brilliant ideas
526.138	often can't be shared
529.999	if there are communication roadblocks.
533.249	And so, many people with autism
533.249	are being overlooked every day,
537.999	and they're being taken advantage of.
541.175	So my dream for people with autism
541.175	is to change that,
548.094	to remove the roadblocks
548.094	that prevent them from succeeding.
551.808	One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming
554.334	is because it allows me to be free,
557.24	without judgment of social
557.24	and physical consequences.
561.638	When I'm flying over scenes
561.638	that I create in my mind,
564.664	I am at peace.
567.346	I am free from judgment,
569.39	and so I can do whatever I want, you know?
571.43	I'm making out with Brad Pitt,
571.43	and Angelina is totally cool with it.
576.358	(Laughter)
579.759	But the goal of autism-assistive
579.759	technology is bigger than that,
583.682	and more important.
585.725	My goal is to shift people's perspective
589.67	of autism and people
589.67	with higher-functioning Asperger's
594.674	because there is a lot they can do.
598.562	I mean, look at
598.562	Temple Grandin, for example.
602.022	And by doing so, we allow people
602.022	to share their talents with this world
607.141	and move this world forward.
609.532	In addition, we give them the courage
609.532	to pursue their dreams
612.778	in the real world, in real time.
615.09	Thank you.
616.273	(Applause)
619.945	Thank you.
621.12	(Applause)
