16.26	So I was privileged to train in transplantation
20.26	under two great surgical pioneers:
22.26	Thomas Starzl,
24.26	who performed the world's first successful liver transplant
27.26	in 1967,
29.26	and Sir Roy Calne,
31.26	who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.
34.26	in the following year.
37.26	I returned to Singapore
39.26	and, in 1990,
41.26	performed Asia's first successful
43.26	cadaveric liver transplant procedure,
46.26	but against all odds.
49.26	Now when I look back,
51.26	the transplant was actually the easiest part.
55.26	Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.
59.26	But perhaps the most challenging part
63.26	was to convince the regulators --
65.26	a matter which was debated in the parliament --
69.26	that a young female surgeon
71.26	be allowed the opportunity
73.26	to pioneer for her country.
76.26	But 20 years on,
78.26	my patient, Surinder,
80.26	is Asia's longest surviving
82.26	cadaveric liver transplant to date.
85.26	(Applause)
89.26	And perhaps more important,
92.26	I am the proud godmother
94.26	to her 14 year-old son.
96.26	(Applause)
100.26	But not all patients on the transplant wait list
102.26	are so fortunate.
104.26	The truth is,
106.26	there are just simply not enough donor organs
108.26	to go around.
110.26	As the demand for donor organs
112.26	continues to rise,
114.26	in large part due to the aging population,
117.26	the supply has remained relatively constant.
121.26	In the United States alone,
127.26	are on the waiting list for donor organs,
130.26	and more than a dozen die each day
133.26	because of a lack of donor organs.
136.26	The transplant community
138.26	has actively campaigned in organ donation.
141.26	And the gift of life
143.26	has been extended
145.26	from brain-dead donors
147.26	to living, related donors --
149.26	relatives who might donate an organ
152.26	or a part of an organ,
154.26	like a split liver graft,
156.26	to a relative or loved one.
159.26	But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,
162.26	the gift of life was then extended
164.26	from living, related donors
166.26	to now living, unrelated donors.
169.26	And this then has given rise
172.26	to unprecedented and unexpected
175.26	moral controversy.
178.26	How can one distinguish
181.26	a donation that is voluntary and altruistic
184.26	from one that is forced or coerced
187.26	from, for example,
189.26	a submissive spouse, an in-law,
192.26	a servant, a slave,
194.26	an employee?
196.26	Where and how can we draw the line?
200.26	In my part of the world,
203.26	too many people live below the poverty line.
206.26	And in some areas,
208.26	the commercial gifting of an organ
210.26	in exchange for monetary reward
213.26	has led to a flourishing trade
215.26	in living, unrelated donors.
219.26	Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,
222.26	I received my next assignment,
224.26	and that was to go to the prisons
227.26	to harvest organs
229.26	from executed prisoners.
232.26	I was also pregnant at the time.
235.26	Pregnancies are meant
237.26	to be happy and fulfilling moments
240.26	in any woman's life.
242.26	But my joyful period
244.26	was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --
249.26	thoughts of walking through
251.26	the prison's high-security death row,
254.26	as this was the only route
256.26	to take me to the makeshift operating room.
260.26	And at each time,
262.26	I would feel the chilling stares
265.26	of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.
269.26	And for two years,
271.26	I struggled with the dilemma
273.26	of waking up at 4:30 am
275.26	on a Friday morning,
277.26	driving to the prison,
279.26	getting down, gloved and scrubbed,
281.26	ready to receive the body
284.26	of an executed prisoner,
286.26	remove the organs
288.26	and then transport these organs
290.26	to the recipient hospital
292.26	and then graft the gift of life
295.26	to a recipient the same afternoon.
298.26	No doubt, I was informed,
300.26	the consent had been obtained.
306.26	But, in my life,
308.26	the one fulfilling skill that I had
313.26	was now invoking feelings of conflict --
317.26	conflict ranging
319.26	from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn
323.26	to celebratory joy
325.26	at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.
329.26	In my team,
331.26	the lives of one or two of my colleagues
334.26	were tainted by this experience.
337.26	Some of us may have been sublimated,
340.26	but really none of us remained the same.
344.26	I was troubled
347.26	that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners
351.26	was at least as morally controversial
354.26	as the harvesting of stem cells
356.26	from human embryos.
359.26	And in my mind,
361.26	I realized as a surgical pioneer
364.26	that the purpose of my position of influence
367.26	was surely to speak up
369.26	for those who have no influence.
372.26	It made me wonder
374.26	if there could be a better way --
376.26	a way to circumvent death
379.26	and yet deliver the gift of life
381.26	that might exponentially impact
384.26	millions of patients worldwide.
388.26	Now just about that time,
390.26	the practice of surgery evolved
392.26	from big to small,
394.26	from wide open incisions
396.26	to keyhole procedures,
398.26	tiny incisions.
401.26	And in transplantation, concepts shifted
404.26	from whole organs to cells.
407.26	In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,
410.26	I participated in a small series
413.26	of whole organ pancreas transplants.
416.26	I witnessed the technical difficulty.
419.26	And this inspired in my mind
421.26	a shift from transplanting whole organs
425.26	to perhaps transplanting cells.
427.26	I thought to myself,
429.26	why not take the individual cells
432.26	out of the pancreas --
434.26	the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --
437.26	and transplant these cells? --
440.26	technically a much simpler procedure
442.26	than having to grapple with the complexities
445.26	of transplanting a whole organ.
448.26	And at that time,
450.26	stem cell research
452.26	had gained momentum,
454.26	following the isolation of the world's first
457.26	human embryonic stem cells
459.26	in the 1990s.
462.26	The observation that stem cells, as master cells,
465.26	could give rise
467.26	to a whole variety of different cell types --
469.26	heart cells, liver cells,
471.26	pancreatic islet cells --
473.26	captured the attention of the media
476.26	and the imagination of the public.
479.26	I too was fascinated
481.26	by this new and disruptive cell technology,
484.26	and this inspired a shift in my mindset,
487.26	from transplanting whole organs
489.26	to transplanting cells.
492.26	And I focused my research on stem cells
495.26	as a possible source
497.26	for cell transplants.
500.26	Today we realize
502.26	that there are many different types of stem cells.
505.26	Embryonic stem cells
507.26	have occupied center stage,
509.26	chiefly because of their pluripotency --
513.26	that is their ease in differentiating
516.26	into a variety of different cell types.
520.26	But the moral controversy
523.26	surrounding embryonic stem cells --
526.26	the fact that these cells are derived
528.26	from five-day old human embryos --
531.26	has encouraged research
533.26	into other types of stem cells.
536.26	Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,
540.26	I inspired my lab
542.26	to focus on what I thought
545.26	was the most non-controversial source of stem cells,
549.26	adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --
552.26	nowadays available in abundant supply --
556.26	you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.
561.26	Fat-derived stem cells
563.26	are adult stem cells.
565.26	And adult stem cells
567.26	are found in you and me --
569.26	in our blood, in our bone marrow,
571.26	in our fat, our skin and other organs.
574.26	And as it turns out,
576.26	fat is one of the best sources
578.26	of adult stem cells.
580.26	But adult stem cells
582.26	are not embryonic stem cells.
585.26	And here is the limitation:
587.26	adult stem cells are mature cells,
590.26	and, like mature human beings,
593.26	these cells are more restricted in their thought
596.26	and more restricted in their behavior
599.26	and are unable to give rise
601.26	to the wide variety of specialized cell types,
604.26	as embryonic stem cells [can].
606.26	But in 2007,
609.26	two remarkable individuals,
612.26	Shinya Yamanaka of Japan
614.26	and Jamie Thomson of the United States,
617.26	made an astounding discovery.
620.26	They discovered
622.26	that adult cells, taken from you and me,
625.26	could be reprogrammed
628.26	back into embryonic-like cells,
630.26	which they termed IPS cells,
633.26	or induced pluripotent stem cells.
638.26	And so guess what,
640.26	scientists around the world and in the labs
643.26	are racing
645.26	to convert aging adult cells --
648.26	aging adult cells from you and me --
650.26	they are racing to reprogram these cells
653.26	back into more useful IPS cells.
658.26	And in our lab,
660.26	we are focused on taking fat
662.26	and reprogramming
664.26	mounds of fat
666.26	into fountains of youthful cells --
670.26	cells that we may use
672.26	to then form other,
674.26	more specialized, cells,
676.26	which one day may be used as cell transplants.
680.26	If this research is successful,
683.26	it may then reduce the need
686.26	to research and sacrifice
688.26	human embryos.
692.26	Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope
695.26	that the promise of stem cells
697.26	will one day provide cures
699.26	for a whole range of conditions.
701.26	Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
704.26	spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,
706.26	retinal eye diseases --
709.26	are any of these conditions
711.26	relevant, personally, to you?
714.26	In May 2006,
717.26	something horrible happened to me.
720.26	I was about to start a robotic operation,
722.26	but stepping out of the elevator
724.26	into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,
727.26	I realized
729.26	that my left visual field
731.26	was fast collapsing into darkness.
734.26	Earlier that week,
736.26	I had taken a rather hard knock
738.26	during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.
741.26	And I started to see floaters and stars,
743.26	which I casually dismissed
745.26	as too much high-altitude sun exposure.
748.26	What happened to me
750.26	might have been catastrophic,
752.26	if not for the fact
754.26	that I was in reach of good surgical access.
756.26	And I had my vision restored,
758.26	but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --
761.26	three months --
763.26	in a head down position.
765.26	This experience
767.26	taught me to empathize more with my patients,
770.26	and especially those with retinal diseases.
776.26	are blind,
778.26	and 127 million more
781.26	suffer from impaired vision.
784.26	Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,
787.26	now in a research phase,
789.26	may one day restore vision,
791.26	or part vision,
793.26	to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.
797.26	Indeed, we live
799.26	in both challenging
801.26	as well as exciting times.
805.26	As the world population ages,
808.26	scientists are racing
810.26	to discover new ways
812.26	to enhance the power of the body
814.26	to heal itself through stem cells.
817.26	It is a fact
819.26	that when our organs or tissues are injured,
822.26	our bone marrow
824.26	releases stem cells
826.26	into our circulation.
828.26	And these stem cells
830.26	then float in the bloodstream
832.26	and hone in to damaged organs
835.26	to release growth factors
837.26	to repair the damaged tissue.
839.26	Stem cells may be used as building blocks
842.26	to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,
846.26	or to provide new liver cells
848.26	to repair damaged liver.
851.26	As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials
854.26	researching the use of stem cells
857.26	for liver diseases.
859.26	What lies ahead?
861.26	Heart disease
863.26	is the leading cause of death worldwide.
865.26	1.1 million Americans
867.26	suffer heart attacks yearly.
870.26	4.8 million
872.26	suffer cardiac failure.
874.26	Stem cells may be used
876.26	to deliver growth factors
878.26	to repair damaged heart muscle
880.26	or be differentiated
882.26	into heart muscle cells
884.26	to restore heart function.
886.26	There are 170 clinical trials
889.26	investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.
893.26	While still in a research phase,
896.26	stem cells may one day herald
899.26	a quantum leap in the field of cardiology.
903.26	Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --
906.26	small, incremental steps,
909.26	cells rather than organs,
912.26	repair rather than replacement.
915.26	Stem cell therapies
918.26	may one day reduce the need for donor organs.
922.26	Powerful new technologies
924.26	always present enigmas.
926.26	As we speak,
928.26	the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury
931.26	is currently underway
933.26	following the USFDA approval.
936.26	And in the U.K.,
938.26	neural stem cells to treat stroke
940.26	are being investigated in a phase one trial.
944.26	The research success that we celebrate today
947.26	has been made possible
949.26	by the curiosity and contribution and commitment
953.26	of individual scientists
955.26	and medical pioneers.
957.26	Each one has his story.
960.26	My story has been about my journey
963.26	from organs to cells --
965.26	a journey through controversy,
967.26	inspired by hope --
969.26	hope that, as we age,
972.26	you and I may one day celebrate longevity
975.26	with an improved quality of life.
977.26	Thank you.
