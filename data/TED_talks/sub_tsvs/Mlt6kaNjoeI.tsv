12.884	"When we use the word ""architect"" or ""designer,"""
16.053	what we usually mean is a professional,
18.852	someone who gets paid,
21.324	and we tend to assume that it's those professionals
24.247	who are going to be the ones to help us solve
26.228	the really big, systemic design challenges that we face
28.788	like climate change, urbanization and social inequality.
32.633	That's our kind of working presumption.
35.717	And I think it's wrong, actually.
38.724	In 2008, I was just about to graduate from architecture school
41.972	after several years, and go out and get a job,
44.645	and this happened.
47.57	The economy ran out of jobs.
49.82	And a couple of things struck me about this.
52.275	One, don't listen to career advisers.
56.005	And two, actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture,
60.661	which is that, as a society, we've never needed design thinking more,
64.931	and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed.
68.889	It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design,
72.44	but actually there's an economics behind architecture
74.556	that we don't talk about, and I think we need to.
77.024	And a good place to start is your own paycheck.
80.655	So, as a bottom-of-the-rung architecture graduate,
83.097	I might expect to earn about 24,000 pounds.
86.073	That's about 36,000, 37,000 dollars.
89.689	Now in terms of the whole world's population,
91.394	that already puts me in the top 1.95 richest people,
96.276	which raises the question of, who is it I'm working for?
100.036	The uncomfortable fact is that
102.747	actually almost everything that we call architecture today
105.631	is actually the business of designing
107.923	for about the richest one percent of the world's population,
110.848	and it always has been.
113.077	The reason why we forgot that
114.824	is because the times in history when architecture
116.927	did the most to transform society were those times
119.852	when, actually, the one percent would build
122.509	on behalf of the 99 percent, for various different reasons,
125.544	whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century,
128.159	communism in the early 20th,
130.429	the welfare state, and most recently, of course,
133.467	through this inflated real estate bubble.
137.083	And all of those booms, in their own various ways,
140.391	have now kicked the bucket,
142.31	and we're back in this situation
144.596	where the smartest designers and architects in the world
149.512	are only really able to work for one percent of the population.
153.292	Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy,
155.402	though I think it probably is,
157.241	it's actually not a very clever business strategy, actually.
160.337	I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects
163.196	is, how are we going to turn our client
165.238	from the one percent to the 100 percent?
168.859	And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas
172.433	for how it might be done.
174.275	The first is, I think we need to question this idea
177.657	that architecture is about making buildings.
179.948	Actually, a building is about the most expensive solution
182.692	you can think of to almost any given problem.
185.708	And fundamentally, design should be much, much more interested
188.236	in solving problems and creating new conditions.
190.968	So here's a story.
192.49	The office was working with a school,
194.088	and they had an old Victorian school building.
196.514	"And they said to the architects, ""Look,"
199.245	our corridors are an absolute nightmare.
201.198	They're far too small. They get congested between classes.
203.564	There's bullying. We can't control them.
205.947	So what we want you to do is re-plan our entire building,
208.789	and we know it's going to cost several million pounds,
210.979	"but we're reconciled to the fact."""
212.89	And the team thought about this, and they went away,
215.596	"and they said, ""Actually, don't do that."
217.613	Instead, get rid of the school bell.
220.393	And instead of having one school bell that goes off once,
223.222	have several smaller school bells that go off
225.48	in different places and different times,
227.728	"distribute the traffic through the corridors."""
229.976	It solves the same problem,
231.393	but instead of spending several million pounds,
234.201	you spend several hundred pounds.
236.344	Now, it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job,
239.144	but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful.
241.705	Architects are actually really, really good
243.178	at this kind of resourceful, strategic thinking.
245.52	And the problem is that, like a lot of design professions,
247.482	we got fixated on the idea of providing
249.665	a particular kind of consumer product,
251.946	and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore.
254.416	The second idea worth questioning is this 20th-century thing
258.617	that mass architecture is about big --
261.878	big buildings and big finance.
264.472	Actually, we've got ourselves locked into this
266.561	Industrial Era mindset which says that
268.968	the only people who can make cities are large organizations
272.454	or corporations who build on our behalf,
274.972	procuring whole neighborhoods
276.78	in single, monolithic projects, and of course,
280.213	form follows finance.
282.432	So what you end up with are single, monolithic neighborhoods
285.456	based on this kind of one-size-fits-all model.
289.144	And a lot of people can't even afford them.
291.657	But what if, actually, it's possible now for cities
294.624	to be made not just by the few with a lot
297.394	but also by the many with a bit?
300.582	And when they do, they bring with them
301.876	a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live.
305.215	And it raises really interesting questions about,
307.319	how will we plan cities? How will finance development?
310.602	How will we sell design services?
312.263	What would it mean for democratic societies
314.503	to offer their citizens a right to build?
316.903	And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right,
319.183	that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.
324.652	And thirdly, we need to remember that,
327.816	from a strictly economic point of view,
330.167	design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly --
335.013	mostly it's done by amateurs.
337.609	And that's a good thing.
339.495	Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy
342.965	in what's called the social economy or the core economy,
345.025	which is people doing it for themselves.
347.417	And the problem is that, up until now,
350.665	it was the monetary economy which had
352.467	all the infrastructure and all the tools.
354.625	So the challenge we face is, how are we going
356.448	to build the tools, the infrastructure and the institutions
359.682	for architecture's social economy?
361.422	And that began with open-source software.
364.154	And over the last few years, it's been moving
366.522	into the physical world with open-source hardware,
369.017	which are freely shared blueprints
370.547	that anyone can download and make for themselves.
374.593	And that's where 3D printing gets really, really interesting.
377.834	Right? When suddenly you had a 3D printer
381.37	that was open-source, the parts for which
382.924	could be made on another 3D printer.
385.205	Or the same idea here, which is for a CNC machine,
388.266	which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood.
392.762	What these technologies are doing is radically
395.576	lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill.
398.657	They're challenging the idea that
400.239	if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one-size-fits-all.
404.065	And they're distributing massively
406.398	really complex manufacturing capabilities.
409.285	We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere,
413.416	and increasingly that means
414.611	that the design team is everyone.
417.898	That really is an industrial revolution.
420.424	And when we think that the major ideological conflicts
423.64	that we inherited were all based around this question
425.658	of who should control the means of production,
427.57	and these technologies are coming back with a solution:
430.297	actually, maybe no one. All of us.
434.286	And we were fascinated by
436.455	what that might mean for architecture.
439.062	So about a year and a half ago,
441.584	we started working on a project called WikiHouse,
443.48	and WikiHouse is an open-source construction system.
446.754	And the idea is to make it possible for anyone
449.552	to go online, access a freely shared library
451.936	of 3D models which they can download and adapt in,
456.397	at the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use,
459.788	and almost at the click of a switch
462.347	they can generate a set of cutting files
464.831	which allow them, in effect,
466.872	to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine
470.06	and a standard sheet material like plywood.
473.271	And the parts are all numbered,
476.391	and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.
480.568	(Laughter)
482.839	And it goes together without any bolts.
485.105	It uses wedge and peg connections.
487.295	And even the mallets to make it
489.439	can be provided on the cutting sheets as well.
491.919	And a team of about two or three people,
494.456	working together, can build this.
496.495	They don't need any traditional construction skills.
498.975	They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that,
502.126	and they can build a small house of about this size
504.639	in about a day.
509.403	(Applause)
516.706	And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house
519.701	onto which you can then apply systems like windows
522.16	and cladding and insulation and services
524.218	based on what's cheap and what's available.
527.267	Of course, the house is never finished.
529.452	We're shifting our heads here, so the house is not a finished product.
532.333	With the CNC machine, you can make new parts for it
535.09	over its life or even use it to make the house next door.
538.947	So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open-source,
542.385	citizen-led urban development model, potentially.
546.66	And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now,
550.21	and some really interesting lessons here.
552.331	One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable.
554.658	People get confused between construction work and having fun.
559.356	But the principles of openness go right down
562.015	into the really mundane, physical details.
564.821	Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.
567.824	Or, when you're designing a piece,
569.123	make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round,
572.003	or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.
574.956	Probably the principal which runs deepest with us
578.998	is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds,
581.953	the open-source pioneer,
584.678	"which was that idea of, ""Be lazy like a fox."""
587.967	Don't reinvent the wheel every time.
589.676	Take what already works, and adapt it for your own needs.
593.469	Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught
596.052	at an architecture school, copying is good.
600.149	Which is appropriate, because actually,
602.15	this approach is not innovative.
603.93	It's actually how we built buildings
605.539	for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution
608.035	in these sorts of community barn-raisings.
610.462	The only difference between traditional
612.606	vernacular architecture and open-source architecture
615.014	might be a web connection,
617.134	but it's a really, really big difference.
619.946	We shared the whole of WikiHouse
621.377	under a Creative Commons license,
623.219	and now what's just beginning to happen
624.641	is that groups around the world are beginning to take it
626.623	and use it and hack it and tinker with it, and it's amazing.
629.362	There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand
632.327	looking at post-earthquake development housing,
635.462	and thanks to the TED city Prize,
638.71	we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas
641.449	to set up a kind of community factory
643.938	and micro-university.
645.852	These are very, very small beginnings,
647.716	and actually there's more people in the last week
650.591	who have got in touch and they're not even on this map.
652.774	I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.
656.514	We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer,
660.963	but it's a small answer to a really, really big question,
664.535	which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities
668.311	are not skyscraper cities.
670.542	They're self-made cities in one form or another.
674.638	If we're talking about the 21st-century city,
678.262	these are the guys who are going to be making it.
680.886	You know, like it or not, welcome to the world's biggest design team.
685.368	So if we're serious about problems
687.494	like climate change, urbanization and health,
691.648	actually, our existing development models aren't going to do it.
695.546	As I think Robert Neuwirth said, there isn't a bank
697.634	or a corporation or a government or an NGO
700.411	who's going to be able to do it
701.797	if we treat citizens only as consumers.
705.446	How extraordinary would it be, though, if collectively
709.227	we were to develop solutions not just to the problem
711.5	of structure that we've been working on,
713.914	but to infrastructure problems like solar-powered air conditioning,
718.634	off-grid energy, off-grid sanitation --
721.45	low-cost, open-source, high-performance solutions
725.379	that anyone can very, very easily make,
727.319	and to put them all into a commons
729.22	where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone?
733.568	A kind of Wikipedia for stuff?
737.738	And once something's in the commons,
739.779	it will always be there.
741.135	How much would that change the rules?
744.663	And I think the technology's on our side.
748.099	If design's great project in the 20th century
751.759	was the democratization of consumption --
755.52	that was Henry Ford, Levittown, Coca-Cola, IKEA —
761.946	I think design's great project in the 21st century
765.568	is the democratization of production.
768.44	And when it comes to architecture in cities,
771.12	that really matters.
773.192	Thank you very much.
774.946	(Applause)
