12.841	For the last 50 years,
15.047	a lot of smart, well-resourced people --
15.047	some of you, no doubt --
20.662	have been trying to figure out
20.662	how to reduce poverty
23.988	in the United States.
26.18	People have created and invested
26.18	millions of dollars
30.168	into non-profit organizations
32.409	with the mission of helping
32.409	people who are poor.
36.249	They've created think tanks
38.159	that study issues like education,
38.159	job creation and asset-building,
43.437	and then advocated for policies to support
43.437	our most marginalized communities.
48.736	They've written books and columns
48.736	and given passionate speeches,
52.394	decrying the wealth gap
52.394	that is leaving more and more people
56.189	entrenched at the bottom end
56.189	of the income scale.
60.069	And that effort has helped.
62.161	But it's not enough.
64.101	Our poverty rates haven't changed
64.101	that much in the last 50 years,
67.858	since the War on Poverty was launched.
70.576	I'm here to tell you
72.751	that we have overlooked
72.751	the most powerful and practical resource.
78.775	Here it is:
80.509	people who are poor.
83.382	Up in the left-hand corner
83.382	is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.
87.925	They met when they all had small children,
89.958	through a parenting class
89.958	at a family resource center
92.819	in San Francisco.
94.8	As they grew together
94.8	as parents and friends,
98.443	they talked a lot about how hard it was
100.483	to make money when your kids are little.
102.729	Child care is expensive,
104.435	more than they'd earn in a job.
106.214	Their husbands worked,
107.398	but they wanted to contribute
107.398	financially, too.
109.898	So they hatched a plan.
111.661	They started a cleaning business.
114.091	They plastered neighborhoods with flyers
116.459	and handed business cards out
116.459	to their families and friends,
119.356	and soon, they had clients calling.
121.597	Two of them would clean
121.597	the office or house
124.686	and one of them would watch the kids.
126.576	They'd rotate who'd cleaned
126.576	and who'd watch the kids.
129.515	(Laughs) It's awesome, right?
131.752	(Laughter)
132.99	And they split the money three ways.
134.866	It was not a full-time gig,
136.191	no one could watch
136.191	the little ones all day.
138.446	But it made a difference
138.446	for their families.
142.049	Extra money to pay for bills
142.049	when a husband's work hours were cut.
147.1	Money to buy the kids clothes
147.1	as they were growing.
150.402	A little extra money in their pockets
152.345	to make them feel some independence.
154.863	Up in the top-right corner
154.863	is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.
159.016	Brianna is one of those kids
160.955	with this sparkly, infectious,
160.955	outgoing personality.
165.789	For example, when Rosie,
167.525	a little girl who spoke only Spanish,
167.525	moved in next door,
170.705	Brianna, who spoke only English,
172.877	borrowed her mother's tablet
172.877	and found a translation app
176.486	so the two of them could communicate.
178.29	(Laughter)
179.416	I know, right?
180.622	Rosie's family credits Brianna
180.622	with helping Rosie to learn English.
185.192	A few years ago,
187.101	Brianna started to struggle academically.
190.312	She was growing frustrated
190.312	and kind of withdrawn
194.751	and acting out in class.
197.023	And her mother was heartbroken
197.023	over what was happening.
201.697	Then they found out that she was going
201.697	to have to repeat second grade
204.983	and Brianna was devastated.
207.02	Her mother felt hopeless
207.02	and overwhelmed and alone
212.215	because she knew that her daughter
212.215	was not getting the support she needed,
215.743	and she did not know how to help her.
217.705	One afternoon, Theresa was catching up
217.705	with a group of friends,
221.293	and one of them said,
222.876	"""Theresa, how are you?"""
225.344	And she burst into tears.
227.804	After she shared her story,
227.804	one of her friends said,
231.169	"""I went through the exact same thing"
231.169	"with my son about a year ago."""
234.47	And in that moment,
235.645	Theresa realized
235.645	that so much of her struggle
237.926	was not having anybody
237.926	to talk with about it.
240.984	So she created a support group
240.984	for parents like her.
245.101	The first meeting was her
245.101	and two other people.
248.459	But word spread, and soon
251.524	were showing up for these
251.524	monthly meetings that she put together.
254.923	She went from feeling helpless
257.164	to realizing how capable she was
257.164	of supporting her daughter,
260.817	with the support of other people
260.817	who were going through the same struggle.
264.522	And Brianna is doing fantastic --
264.522	she's doing great academically
267.583	and socially.
269.834	That in the middle is my man Baakir,
273.244	standing in front of
273.244	BlackStar Books and Caffe,
276.113	which he runs out of part of his house.
278.722	As you walk in the door,
280.321	Baakir greets you
280.321	"with a ""Welcome black home."""
283.729	(Laughter)
286.531	Once inside, you can order
286.531	some Algiers jerk chicken,
290.598	perhaps a vegan walnut burger,
293.145	or jive turkey sammich.
295.519	And that's sammich -- not sandwich.
298.436	You must finish your meal
298.436	with a buttermilk drop,
302.691	which is several steps above a donut hole
305.073	and made from a very secret family recipe.
308.197	For real, it's very secret,
308.197	he won't tell you about it.
311.464	But BlackStar is much more than a caf√©.
315.046	For the kids in the neighborhood,
316.675	it's a place to go after school
316.675	to get help with homework.
319.704	For the grown-ups, it's where they go
321.521	to find out what's going on
321.521	in the neighborhood
323.748	and catch up with friends.
325.129	It's a performance venue.
326.63	It's a home for poets,
326.63	musicians and artists.
330.424	Baakir and his partner Nicole,
332.632	with their baby girl strapped to her back,
334.796	are there in the mix of it all,
336.374	serving up a cup of coffee,
338.469	teaching a child how to play Mancala,
340.633	or painting a sign
340.633	for an upcoming community event.
344.182	I have worked with and learned
344.182	from people just like them
348.452	for more than 20 years.
350.117	I have organized
350.117	against the prison system,
352.984	which impacts poor folks,
355.341	especially black, indigenous
355.341	and Latino folks,
357.909	at an alarming rate.
359.758	I have worked with young people
359.758	who manifest hope and promise,
363.297	despite being at the effect of racist
363.297	discipline practices in their schools,
367.73	and police violence in their communities.
370.605	I have learned from families
372.515	who are unleashing
372.515	their ingenuity and tenacity
376.221	to collectively create
376.221	their own solutions.
378.435	And they're not just focused on money.
380.911	They're addressing education,
380.911	housing, health, community --
384.631	the things that we all care about.
388.26	Everywhere I go,
389.667	I see people who are broke but not broken.
393.263	I see people who are struggling
393.263	to realize their good ideas,
397.106	so that they can create
397.106	a better life for themselves,
399.698	their families, their communities.
403.316	Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa
403.316	and Baakir are the rule,
409.828	not the shiny exception.
411.923	I am the exception.
414.54	I was raised by a quietly fierce
414.54	single mother in Rochester, New York.
419.625	I was bussed to a school
419.625	in the suburbs, from a neighborhood
422.591	that many of my classmates
422.591	and their parents considered dangerous.
426.502	At eight, I was a latchkey kid.
428.933	I'd get myself home after school every day
428.933	and do homework and chores,
433.365	and wait for my mother to come home.
435.375	After school, I'd go to the corner store
437.591	and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,
440.117	which I'd heat up on the stove
440.117	as my afternoon snack.
443.145	If I had a little extra money,
443.145	I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.
445.976	(Laughter)
447.001	Cherry.
448.176	Not as good as a buttermilk drop.
449.854	(Laughter)
450.879	We were poor when I was a kid.
452.597	But now, I own a home
452.597	in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood
456.414	in Oakland, California.
458.363	I've built a career.
460.375	My husband is a business owner.
463.605	I have a retirement account.
466.305	My daughter is not even allowed
466.305	to turn on the stove
468.906	unless there's a grown-up at home
470.509	and she doesn't have to,
471.691	because she does not have to have
471.691	the same kind of self-reliance
474.978	that I had to at her age.
476.795	My kids' raviolis are organic
479.023	and full of things
479.023	like spinach and ricotta,
481.954	because I have the luxury of choice
484.301	when it comes to what my children eat.
486.243	I am the exception,
488.367	not because I'm more talented than Baakir
490.723	or my mother worked any harder
490.723	than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,
494.629	or cared any more than Theresa.
497.395	Marginalized communities are full
497.395	of smart, talented people,
502.525	hustling and working and innovating,
504.863	just like our most revered
504.863	and most rewarded CEOs.
508.828	They are full of people
508.828	tapping into their resilience
511.485	to get up every day,
511.485	get the kids off to school
514.011	and go to jobs that don't pay enough,
516.021	or get educations
516.021	that are putting them in debt.
518.85	They are full of people applying
518.85	their savvy intelligence
523.678	to stretch a minimum wage paycheck,
526.089	or balance a job and a side hustle
526.089	to make ends meet.
529.627	They are full of people
529.627	doing for themselves and for others,
533.426	whether it's picking up medication
533.426	for an elderly neighbor,
536.954	or letting a sibling borrow some money
536.954	to pay the phone bill,
540.712	or just watching out
540.712	for the neighborhood kids
542.979	from the front stoop.
545.259	I am the exception
545.259	because of luck and privilege,
548.67	not hard work.
549.979	And I'm not being modest
549.979	or self-deprecating --
552.341	I am amazing.
553.516	(Laughter)
554.758	But most people work hard.
556.83	Hard work is the common
556.83	denominator in this equation,
561.023	and I'm tired of the story we tell
563.416	that hard work leads to success,
566.048	because that allows --
567.609	Thank you.
568.823	(Applause)
573.509	... because that story allows those of us
573.509	who make it to believe we deserve it,
578.146	and by implication,
579.403	those who don't make it don't deserve it.
582.175	We tell ourselves,
582.175	in the back of our minds,
584.402	and sometimes in the front of our mouths,
586.701	"""There must be something a little wrong"
586.701	"with those poor people."""
589.762	We have a wide range of beliefs
591.278	about what that something wrong is.
593.487	Some people tell the story
593.487	that poor folks are lazy freeloaders
596.795	who would cheat and lie
596.795	to get out of an honest day's work.
600.287	Others prefer the story
600.287	that poor people are helpless
603.224	and probably had neglectful parents
603.224	that didn't read to them enough,
606.529	and if they were just told what to do
608.762	and shown the right path,
610.043	they could make it.
611.917	For every story I hear demonizing
611.917	low-income single mothers
618.08	or absentee fathers,
619.453	which is how people
619.453	might think of my parents,
622.219	I've got 50 that tell a different story
622.219	about the same people,
627.105	showing up every day and doing their best.
630.491	I'm not saying that some
630.491	of the negative stories aren't true,
634.231	but those stories allow us
634.231	to not really see who people really are,
640.619	because they don't paint a full picture.
643.249	The quarter-truths and limited
643.249	plot lines have us convinced
647.122	that poor people are a problem
647.122	that needs fixing.
651.57	What if we recognized
651.57	that what's working is the people
655.863	and what's broken is our approach?
658.441	What if we realized that the experts
658.441	we are looking for,
661.99	the experts we need to follow,
663.81	are poor people themselves?
665.755	What if, instead of imposing solutions,
668.782	we just added fire
670.905	to the already-burning flame
670.905	that they have?
673.873	Not directing --
676.054	not even empowering --
678.668	but just fueling their initiative.
682	Just north of here,
683.381	we have an example
683.381	of what this could look like:
686.572	Silicon Valley.
688.497	A whole venture capital industry
688.497	has grown up around the belief
692.695	that if people have good ideas
692.695	and the desire to manifest them,
697.007	we should give them lots
697.007	and lots and lots of money.
701.028	(Laughter)
702.174	Right? But where is our strategy
702.174	for Theresa and Baakir?
707.127	There are no incubators for them,
709.447	no accelerators, no fellowships.
712.577	How are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha
712.577	really all that different
716.276	from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?
718.938	Baakir has experience and a track record.
721.946	I'd put my money on him.
724.649	So, consider this an invitation
724.649	to rethink a flawed strategy.
732.19	Let's grasp this opportunity
734.984	to let go of a tired, faulty narrative
738.825	and listen and look for true stories,
741.886	more beautifully complex stories,
743.923	about who marginalized people
743.923	and families and communities are.
751.149	I'm going to take a minute
751.149	to speak to my people.
759.986	We cannot wait
761.47	for somebody else to get it right.
765.136	Let us remember what we are capable of;
768.316	all that we have built
768.316	with blood, sweat and dreams;
772.209	all the cogs that keep turning;
774.012	and the people kept afloat
774.012	because of our backbreaking work.
777.708	Let us remember that we are magic.
780.677	If you need some inspiration
780.677	to jog your memory,
783.621	read Octavia Butler's
783.621	"""Parable of the Sower."""
786.615	Listen to Reverend King's
786.615	"""Letter from Birmingham Jail."""
790.028	Listen to Suheir Hammad recite
790.028	"""First Writing Since,"""
794.672	or Esperanza Spalding
794.672	"perform ""Black Gold."""
797.745	Set your gaze upon the art
797.745	of Kehinde Wiley
800.417	or Favianna Rodriguez.
802.914	Look at the hands of your grandmother
808.523	or into the eyes of someone who loves you.
812.386	We are magic.
815.087	Individually, we don't have
815.087	a lot of wealth and power,
817.981	but collectively, we are unstoppable.
822.114	And we spend a lot of our time and energy
824.409	organizing our power to demand change
824.409	from systems that were not made for us.
831.489	Instead of trying to alter
831.489	the fabric of existing ways,
835.094	let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.
838.355	Let's use some of our
838.355	substantial collective power
841.869	toward inventing and bringing to life
843.865	new ways of being that work for us.
847.423	Desmond Tutu talks
847.423	about the concept of ubuntu,
852.382	in the context of South Africa's
852.382	Truth and Reconciliation process
856.061	that they embarked on after apartheid.
858.378	He says it means,
860.737	"""My humanity is caught up,"
860.737	is inextricably bound up, in yours;
866.287	"we belong to a bundle of life."""
872.381	A bundle of life.
876.019	The Truth and Reconciliation process
877.831	started by elevating
877.831	the voices of the unheard.
882.068	If this country is going to live up to its
882.068	promise of liberty and justice for all,
888.033	then we need to elevate
888.033	the voices of our unheard,
891.146	of people like Jobana,
891.146	Sintia and Bertha,
894.651	Theresa and Baakir.
897.809	We must leverage their solutions
897.809	and their ideas.
901.437	We must listen to their true stories,
904.591	their more beautifully complex stories.
907.956	Thank you.
909.14	(Applause)
