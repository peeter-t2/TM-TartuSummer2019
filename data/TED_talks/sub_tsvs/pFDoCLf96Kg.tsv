15.26	So I begin with an advertisement
18.26	inspired by George Orwell
20.26	that Apple ran in 1984.
32.26	(Video) Big Brother: We are one people
34.26	with one will, one resolve,
37.26	one cause.
39.26	Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,
42.26	and we will fight them with their own confusion.
47.26	We shall prevail.
52.26	Narrator: On January 24th,
54.26	Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.
57.26	And you'll see why 1984
60.26	"won't be like ""1984."""
62.26	Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video
65.26	remains very powerful even today.
68.26	Technology created by innovative companies
71.26	will set us all free.
74.26	Fast-forward more than two decades:
77.26	Apple launches the iPhone in China
80.26	and censors the Dalai Lama out
82.26	along with several other politically sensitive applications
85.26	at the request of the Chinese government
87.26	for its Chinese app store.
89.26	The American political cartoonist
91.26	Mark Fiore
93.26	also had his satire application
95.26	censored in the United States
97.26	because some of Apple's staff
99.26	were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
102.26	His app wasn't reinstated
104.26	until he won the Pulitzer Prize.
107.26	The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,
110.26	had its app censored
112.26	because the Apple nannies deemed it
114.26	to be a little bit too racy for their users,
117.26	and despite the fact that this magazine
119.26	is perfectly legal for sale
121.26	on newsstands throughout Germany.
124.26	And more controversially, recently,
126.26	Apple censored a Palestinian protest app
129.26	after the Israeli government voiced concerns
132.26	that it might be used to organize violent attacks.
135.26	So here's the thing.
137.26	We have a situation where private companies
139.26	are applying censorship standards
142.26	that are often quite arbitrary
145.26	and generally more narrow
147.26	than the free speech constitutional standards
149.26	that we have in democracies.
151.26	Or they're responding to censorship requests
154.26	by authoritarian regimes
156.26	that do not reflect consent of the governed.
158.26	Or they're responding to requests and concerns
161.26	by governments that have no jurisdiction
165.26	over many, or most, of the users and viewers
168.26	who are interacting with the content in question.
171.26	So here's the situation.
173.26	In a pre-Internet world,
175.26	sovereignty over our physical freedoms,
178.26	or lack thereof,
180.26	was controlled almost entirely
182.26	by nation-states.
184.26	But now we have this new layer
186.26	of private sovereignty
188.26	in cyberspace.
190.26	And their decisions about software coding,
192.26	engineering, design, terms of service
195.26	all act as a kind of law
197.26	that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.
201.26	And their sovereignties,
203.26	cross-cutting, globally interlinked,
205.26	can in some ways
207.26	challenge the sovereignties of nation-states
209.26	in very exciting ways,
211.26	but sometimes also act
213.26	to project and extend it
215.26	at a time when control
217.26	over what people can and cannot do
219.26	with information
221.26	has more effect than ever
223.26	on the exercise of power
225.26	in our physical world.
228.26	After all, even the leader of the free world
230.26	needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan
233.26	if he wants to get reelected next year.
236.26	And these platforms
238.26	were certainly very helpful
240.26	to activists in Tunisia and Egypt
243.26	this past spring and beyond.
245.26	As Wael Ghonim,
248.26	the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,
251.26	secret-Facebook-activist by night,
253.26	famously said to CNN
255.26	after Mubarak stepped down,
257.26	"""If you want to liberate a society,"
259.26	"just give them the Internet."""
261.26	But overthrowing a government is one thing
263.26	and building a stable democracy
265.26	is a bit more complicated.
267.26	On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist
270.26	who was part of the storming
272.26	of the Egyptian state security offices in March.
275.26	And many of the agents
277.26	shredded as many of the documents as they could
279.26	and left them behind in piles.
281.26	But some of the files were left behind intact,
284.26	and activists, some of them,
286.26	found their own surveillance dossiers
289.26	full of transcripts of their email exchanges,
292.26	their cellphone text message exchanges,
294.26	even Skype conversations.
296.26	And one activist actually found
298.26	a contract from a Western company
301.26	for the sale of surveillance technology
303.26	to the Egyptian security forces.
305.26	And Egyptian activists are assuming
307.26	that these technologies for surveillance
309.26	are still being used
311.26	by the transitional authorities running the networks there.
315.26	And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --
318.26	not nearly as extensively
320.26	as under President Ben Ali.
323.26	But you'll see here a blocked page
325.26	of what happens when you try to reach
327.26	certain Facebook pages and some other websites
329.26	that the transitional authorities
331.26	have determined might incite violence.
334.26	In protest over this,
336.26	blogger Slim Amamou,
338.26	who had been jailed under Ben Ali
340.26	and then became part of the transitional government
342.26	after the revolution,
344.26	he resigned in protest from the cabinet.
347.26	But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia
349.26	about how to handle this kind of problem.
351.26	In fact, on Twitter,
353.26	there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution
355.26	"who said, ""Well actually,"
357.26	we do want democracy and free expression,
359.26	but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds
362.26	because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.
365.26	But the problem is,
367.26	how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions
370.26	and how do you make sure
372.26	that they do not abuse their power?
374.26	As Riadh Guerfali,
376.26	the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,
378.26	remarked over this incident,
380.26	"""Before, things were simple:"
382.26	you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.
385.26	"Today, things are a lot more subtle."""
388.26	Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.
391.26	The reality is
393.26	that even in democratic societies today,
396.26	we do not have good answers
398.26	for how you balance the need
400.26	for security and law enforcement on one hand
403.26	and protection of civil liberties
405.26	and free speech on the other
407.26	in our digital networks.
409.26	In fact, in the United States,
411.26	whatever you may think of Julian Assange,
414.26	even people who are not necessarily big fans of his
417.26	are very concerned about the way
419.26	in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.
422.26	Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer
425.26	after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,
429.26	despite the fact
431.26	that Wikileaks had not been charged,
433.26	let alone convicted,
435.26	of any crime.
438.26	So we assume
440.26	that the Internet is a border-busting technology.
443.26	This is a map of social networks worldwide,
446.26	and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --
449.26	which is either a good or a bad thing,
451.26	depending on how you like
453.26	the way Facebook manages its service.
455.26	But borders do persist
457.26	in some parts of cyberspace.
459.26	In Brazil and Japan,
461.26	it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.
464.26	But if you look at China, Vietnam
466.26	and a number of the former Soviet states,
469.26	what's happening there is more troubling.
471.26	You have a situation
473.26	where the relationship between government
475.26	and local social networking companies
478.26	is creating a situation
480.26	where, effectively,
482.26	the empowering potential of these platforms
485.26	is being constrained
487.26	because of these relationships
489.26	between companies and government.
491.26	Now in China,
493.26	"you have the ""great firewall,"" as it's well-known,"
495.26	that blocks Facebook
497.26	and Twitter and now Google+
500.26	and many of the other overseas websites.
503.26	And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.
506.26	But that's only half of the story.
509.26	The other part of the story
511.26	are requirements that the Chinese government places
514.26	on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,
517.26	known as a system of self-discipline.
519.26	In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance
522.26	of their users.
524.26	And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009
527.26	where the Internet Society of China presented awards
530.26	to the top 20 Chinese companies
533.26	that are best at exercising self-discipline --
536.26	i.e. policing their content.
538.26	And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,
541.26	China's dominant search engine,
543.26	was one of the recipients.
546.26	In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet
550.26	and directly censor websites.
552.26	But this is a website called Rospil
554.26	that's an anti-corruption site.
556.26	And earlier this year,
558.26	there was a troubling incident
560.26	where people who had made donations to Rospil
563.26	through a payments processing system
565.26	called Yandex Money
567.26	suddenly received threatening phone calls
569.26	from members of a nationalist party
572.26	who had obtained details
574.26	about donors to Rospil
577.26	through members of the security services
579.26	who had somehow obtained this information
582.26	from people at Yandex Money.
585.26	This has a chilling effect
587.26	on people's ability to use the Internet
589.26	to hold government accountable.
592.26	So we have a situation in the world today
594.26	where in more and more countries
596.26	the relationship between citizens and governments
599.26	is mediated through the Internet,
602.26	which is comprised primarily
604.26	of privately owned and operated services.
608.26	So the important question, I think,
610.26	is not this debate over whether the Internet
612.26	is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
615.26	Of course, it's going to empower
617.26	whoever is most skilled at using the technology
620.26	and best understands the Internet
622.26	in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
625.26	The most urgent question we need to be asking today
628.26	is how do we make sure
630.26	that the Internet evolves
632.26	in a citizen-centric manner.
635.26	Because I think all of you will agree
637.26	that the only legitimate purpose of government
640.26	is to serve citizens,
642.26	and I would argue
644.26	that the only legitimate purpose of technology
646.26	is to improve our lives,
648.26	not to manipulate or enslave us.
653.26	So the question is,
655.26	we know how to hold government accountable.
657.26	We don't necessarily always do it very well,
659.26	but we have a sense of what the models are,
662.26	politically and institutionally, to do that.
664.26	How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace
666.26	accountable to the public interest
668.26	when most CEO's argue
670.26	that their main obligation
672.26	is to maximize shareholder profit?
674.26	And government regulation
676.26	often isn't helping all that much.
678.26	You have situations, for instance, in France
680.26	where president Sarkozy
682.26	tells the CEO's of Internet companies,
684.26	"""We're the only legitimate representatives"
686.26	"of the public interest."""
688.26	But then he goes and champions laws
690.26	"like the infamous ""three-strikes"" law"
692.26	that would disconnect citizens from the Internet
694.26	for file sharing,
696.26	which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur
699.26	on Freedom of Expression
701.26	as being a disproportionate violation
704.26	of citizens' right to communications,
706.26	and has raised questions amongst civil society groups
709.26	about whether
711.26	some political representatives
713.26	are more interested in preserving
715.26	the interests of the entertainment industry
718.26	than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.
720.26	And here in the United Kingdom
722.26	there's also concern over
724.26	a law called the Digital Economy Act
726.26	that's placing more onus
728.26	on private intermediaries
730.26	to police citizen behavior.
734.26	So what we need to recognize
736.26	is that if we want to have
738.26	a citizen-centric Internet in the future,
741.26	we need a broader and more sustained
743.26	Internet freedom movement.
745.26	After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater
748.26	as a matter of course,
751.26	or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,
753.26	just because executives woke up one day
755.26	and decided it was the right thing to do.
758.26	It was the result of decades of sustained activism,
760.26	shareholder advocacy
762.26	and consumer advocacy.
764.26	Similarly, governments don't enact
768.26	intelligent environmental and labor laws
771.26	just because politicians wake up one day.
774.26	It's the result of very sustained and prolonged
776.26	political activism
778.26	that you get the right regulations,
780.26	and that you get the right corporate behavior.
782.26	We need to make the same approach
784.26	with the Internet.
786.26	We also are going to need
788.26	political innovation.
790.26	Eight hundred years ago, approximately,
793.26	the barons of England decided
795.26	that the Divine Right of Kings
797.26	was no longer working for them so well,
800.26	and they forced King John
802.26	to sign the Magna Carta,
805.26	which recognized
807.26	that even the king
809.26	who claimed to have divine rule
812.26	still had to abide by a basic set of rules.
815.26	This set off a cycle
818.26	of what we can call political innovation,
820.26	which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --
823.26	which was implemented for the first time
826.26	by that radical revolutionary government
829.26	in America across the pond.
832.26	So now we need to figure out
835.26	how to build consent of the networked.
837.26	And what does that look like?
839.26	At the moment, we still don't know.
842.26	But it's going to require innovation
846.26	that's not only going to need
849.26	to focus on politics,
851.26	on geopolitics,
853.26	but it's also going to need
855.26	to deal with questions
858.26	of business management, investor behavior,
861.26	consumer choice
863.26	and even software design and engineering.
867.26	Each and every one of us has a vital part to play
870.26	in building the kind of world
873.26	in which government and technology
876.26	serve the world's people and not the other way around.
879.26	Thank you very much.
881.26	(Applause)
