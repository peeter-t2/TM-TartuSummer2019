12.96	For the last year,
14.24	everyone's been watching the same show,
16.92	and I'm not talking
16.92	"about ""Game of Thrones,"""
19.16	but a horrifying, real-life drama
22.12	that's proved too fascinating to turn off.
25.4	It's a show produced by murderers
28.12	and shared around the world
28.12	via the Internet.
32.08	Their names have become familiar:
34.56	James Foley, Steven Sotloff,
34.56	David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,
41.48	Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.
45.12	Their beheadings by the Islamic State
47.84	were barbaric,
49.48	but if we think they were archaic,
53.28	from a remote, obscure age,
56.16	then we're wrong.
57.84	They were uniquely modern,
60.6	because the murderers acted knowing well
63.48	that millions of people
63.48	would tune in to watch.
67.68	The headlines called them
67.68	savages and barbarians,
71.04	because the image of one man
71.04	overpowering another,
74.52	killing him with a knife to the throat,
76.8	conforms to our idea
76.8	of ancient, primitive practices,
81.12	the polar opposite
81.12	of our urban, civilized ways.
86.24	We don't do things like that.
89.96	But that's the irony.
91.8	We think a beheading
91.8	has nothing to do with us,
94.48	even as we click on the screen to watch.
98.28	But it is to do with us.
101.84	The Islamic State beheadings
104.32	are not ancient or remote.
107.04	They're a global, 21st century event,
110.08	a 21st century event that takes place
110.08	in our living rooms, at our desks,
115.04	on our computer screens.
117.4	They're entirely dependent
117.4	on the power of technology to connect us.
122.88	And whether we like it or not,
124.48	everyone who watches
124.48	is a part of the show.
129.28	And lots of people watch.
133.56	We don't know exactly how many.
135.12	Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.
137.8	But a poll taken in the UK,
137.8	for example, in August 2014,
143.48	estimated that 1.2 million people
149.32	had watched the beheading of James Foley
152.8	in the few days after it was released.
156.6	And that's just the first few days,
159.08	and just Britain.
161.68	A similar poll taken in the United States
164.12	in November 2014
166.96	found that nine percent of those surveyed
169.72	had watched beheading videos,
172.52	and a further 23 percent
174.8	had watched the videos but had stopped
174.8	just before the death was shown.
180.72	Nine percent may be a small minority
180.72	of all the people who could watch,
185.72	but it's still a very large crowd.
188.8	And of course that crowd
188.8	is growing all the time,
191.56	because every week, every month,
193.72	more people will keep downloading
193.72	and keep watching.
198.6	If we go back 11 years,
200.56	before sites like YouTube
200.56	and Facebook were born,
204.04	it was a similar story.
205.8	When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,
209.2	Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,
213.16	those videos were shown
213.16	during the Iraq War.
216.8	Nick Berg's beheading
218.48	quickly became one of the most
218.48	searched for items on the Internet.
224.2	Within a day, it was the top search term
227.24	across search engines
227.24	like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.
232.36	In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,
235.56	these were the top 10 search terms
235.56	in the United States.
240.88	The Berg beheading video remained
240.88	the most popular search term for a week,
245.8	and it was the second most popular
245.8	search term for the whole month of May,
250.44	"runner-up only to ""American Idol."""
254.64	The al-Qaeda-linked website
254.64	that first showed Nick Berg's beheading
259.36	had to close down within a couple of days
259.36	due to overwhelming traffic to the site.
265.6	One Dutch website owner said
265.6	that his daily viewing figures
269.76	rose from 300,000 to 750,000
274.6	every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.
278.44	He told reporters 18 months later
281.6	that it had been downloaded
281.6	many millions of times,
285	and that's just one website.
287.76	A similar pattern was seen again and again
290.28	when videos of beheadings
290.28	were released during the Iraq War.
296.88	Social media sites have made these images
296.88	more accessible than ever before,
301.92	but if we take
301.92	another step back in history,
305.48	we'll see that it was the camera
305.48	that first created a new kind of crowd
310.64	in our history of beheadings
310.64	as public spectacle.
314.84	As soon as the camera
314.84	appeared on the scene,
317.92	a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,
321.68	it had an immediate
321.68	and unequivocal effect.
325.4	That day, the first film of a public
325.4	beheading was created in France.
331.68	It was the execution, the guillotining,
331.68	of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,
337.44	outside the prison
337.44	Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
342.24	Weidmann was due to be executed
342.24	at the crack of dawn,
345.24	as was customary at the time,
347.44	but his executioner was new to the job,
350.04	and he'd underestimated
350.04	how long it would take him to prepare.
353.92	So Weidmann was executed
353.92	at 4:30 in the morning,
358.08	by which time on a June morning,
360.48	there was enough light
360.48	to take photographs,
363.88	and a spectator in the crowd
363.88	filmed the event,
368.04	unbeknownst to the authorities.
371.04	Several still photographs
371.04	were taken as well,
375.36	and you can still watch
375.36	the film online today
379.52	and look at the photographs.
382.96	The crowd on the day
382.96	of Weidmann's execution
386.4	"was called ""unruly"""
386.4	"and ""disgusting"" by the press,"
390.4	but that was nothing compared
390.4	to the untold thousands of people
394.6	who could now study the action
397.24	over and over again,
398.48	freeze-framed in every detail.
403.12	The camera may have made these scenes
403.12	more accessible than ever before,
408	but it's not just about the camera.
410.68	If we take a bigger leap back in history,
413.12	we'll see that for as long
413.12	as there have been
415.32	public judicial executions and beheadings,
418.44	there have been the crowds to see them.
421.92	In London, as late as
421.92	the early 19th century,
425.08	there might be four or five thousand
425.08	people to see a standard hanging.
429.76	There could be 40,000 or 50,000
429.76	to see a famous criminal killed.
435.08	And a beheading, which was
435.08	a rare event in England at the time,
439.52	attracted even more.
441.84	In May 1820,
444.92	five men known as
444.92	the Cato Street Conspirators
448.96	were executed in London for plotting
451.12	to assassinate members
451.12	of the British government.
454.44	They were hung and then decapitated.
458.12	It was a gruesome scene.
460.12	Each man's head was hacked off in turn
460.12	and held up to the crowd.
464.52	And 100,000 people,
466.72	that's 10,000 more than can fit
466.72	into Wembley Stadium,
470.36	had turned out to watch.
472.32	The streets were packed.
474.6	People had rented out
474.6	windows and rooftops.
478.84	People had climbed onto carts
478.84	and wagons in the street.
481.88	People climbed lamp posts.
484	People had been known to have died
484	in the crush on popular execution days.
490.12	Evidence suggests
490.12	that throughout our history
493.56	of public beheadings
493.56	and public executions,
496.92	the vast majority of the people
496.92	who come to see
500.28	are either enthusiastic
500.28	or, at best, unmoved.
505.52	Disgust has been comparatively rare,
509.16	and even when people
509.16	are disgusted and are horrified,
513.4	it doesn't always stop them
513.4	from coming out all the same to watch.
518.6	Perhaps the most striking example
521.84	of the human ability to watch
521.84	a beheading and remain unmoved
527.159	and even be disappointed
529.52	was the introduction in France
529.52	in 1792 of the guillotine,
535	that famous decapitation machine.
538.24	To us in the 21st century,
540.88	the guillotine may seem
540.88	like a monstrous contraption,
544.4	but to the first crowds who saw it,
544.4	it was actually a disappointment.
550.88	They were used to seeing long, drawn-out,
550.88	torturous executions on the scaffold,
557.44	where people were mutilated
557.44	and burned and pulled apart slowly.
562.92	To them, watching
562.92	the guillotine in action,
565.92	it was so quick, there was nothing to see.
569.12	The blade fell, the head fell
569.12	into a basket, out of sight immediately,
574.36	and they called out,
576.08	"""Give me back my gallows,"
576.08	"give me back my wooden gallows."""
581.36	The end of torturous public
581.36	judicial executions in Europe and America
586.56	was partly to do with being
586.56	more humane towards the criminal,
590.52	but it was also partly because the crowd
590.52	obstinately refused to behave
595.28	in the way that they should.
597.56	All too often, execution day
599.92	was more like a carnival
599.92	than a solemn ceremony.
604.52	Today, a public judicial execution
604.52	in Europe or America is unthinkable,
609.36	but there are other scenarios
609.36	that should make us cautious
612.12	about thinking
612.12	that things are different now
614.2	and we don't behave like that anymore.
617.56	Take, for example,
617.56	the incidents of suicide baiting.
622.2	This is when a crowd gathers
624.4	to watch a person who has climbed
624.4	to the top of a public building
628.04	in order to kill themselves,
630.48	and people in the crowd shout and jeer,
633.48	"""Get on with it! Go on and jump!"""
636.6	This is a well-recognized phenomenon.
640.12	One paper in 1981 found that in 10
640.12	out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,
646.4	there was incidents of suicide baiting
646.4	and jeering from a crowd.
651.28	And there have been incidents
651.28	reported in the press this year.
656.88	This was a very widely reported incident
659.68	in Telford and Shropshire
659.68	in March this year.
662.68	And when it happens today,
664.32	people take photographs
664.32	and they take videos on their phones
667.76	and they post those videos online.
672.12	When it comes to brutal murderers
672.12	who post their beheading videos,
675.84	the Internet has created
675.84	a new kind of crowd.
679.56	Today, the action takes place
679.56	in a distant time and place,
684.6	which gives the viewer a sense
684.6	of detachment from what's happening,
687.92	a sense of separation.
689.2	It's nothing to do with me.
690.96	It's already happened.
693.4	We are also offered
693.4	an unprecedented sense of intimacy.
696.96	Today, we are all offered front row seats.
699.68	We can all watch in private,
699.68	in our own time and space,
703.44	and no one need ever know
703.44	that we've clicked on the screen to watch.
708.52	This sense of separation --
710.52	from other people,
710.52	from the event itself --
713.52	seems to be key to understanding
713.52	our ability to watch,
717.12	and there are several ways
718.4	in which the Internet
718.4	creates a sense of detachment
721.68	that seems to erode
721.68	individual moral responsibility.
726.68	Our activities online
726.68	are often contrasted with real life,
730.4	as though the things we do online
730.4	are somehow less real.
734.28	We feel less accountable for our actions
737.28	when we interact online.
740.64	There's a sense of anonymity,
740.64	a sense of invisibility,
744.76	so we feel less accountable
744.76	for our behavior.
748.8	The Internet also makes it far easier
748.8	to stumble upon things inadvertently,
753.44	things that we would usually avoid
753.44	in everyday life.
757.08	Today, a video can start playing
757.08	before you even know what you're watching.
761.96	Or you may be tempted to look at material
761.96	that you wouldn't look at in everyday life
766	or you wouldn't look at if you
766	were with other people at the time.
770.12	And when the action is pre-recorded
773.04	and takes place
773.04	in a distant time and space,
777.28	watching seems like a passive activity.
781.28	There's nothing I can do about it now.
783.12	It's already happened.
785.16	All these things make it easier
785.16	as an Internet user
788.48	for us to give in to our sense
788.48	of curiosity about death,
792.32	to push our personal boundaries,
795.04	to test our sense of shock,
795.04	to explore our sense of shock.
801.36	But we're not passive when we watch.
803.72	On the contrary, we're fulfilling
803.72	the murderer's desire to be seen.
808.24	When the victim of a decapitation
808.24	is bound and defenseless,
812.72	he or she essentially becomes
812.72	a pawn in their killer's show.
818.52	Unlike a trophy head
818.52	that's taken in battle,
821.4	that represents the luck and skill
821.4	it takes to win a fight,
827.2	when a beheading is staged,
829.36	when it's essentially a piece of theater,
832.32	the power comes from the reception
832.32	the killer receives as he performs.
838.88	In other words, watching
838.88	is very much part of the event.
843.64	The event no longer takes place
843.64	in a single location
847.2	at a certain point in time as it used to
847.2	and as it may still appear to.
853.2	Now the event is stretched out
853.2	in time and place,
857.16	and everyone who watches plays their part.
861.52	We should stop watching,
864.12	but we know we won't.
866.44	History tells us we won't,
868.92	and the killers know it too.
871.24	Thank you.
872.48	(Applause)
877	Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
877	Let me get this back. Thank you.
879.92	Let's move here. While they install
879.92	for the next performance,
882.84	I want to ask you the question
882.84	that probably many here have,
885.72	which is how did you
885.72	get interested in this topic?
890.36	Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum
892.4	called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,
894.36	which was famous for its display
894.36	of shrunken heads from South America.
898.24	"People used to say, ""Oh, the shrunken head"
898.24	"museum, the shrunken head museum!"""
902.2	And at the time,
902.2	I was working on the history
905.84	of scientific collections of skulls.
907.88	I was working on the cranial collections,
910.48	and it just struck me as ironic
912.32	that here were people coming to see
912.32	this gory, primitive, savage culture
917.12	that they were almost
917.12	fantasizing about and creating
921.96	without really understanding
921.96	what they were seeing,
924.365	and all the while these vast --
924.365	I mean hundreds of thousands
927.96	of skulls in our museums,
927.96	all across Europe and the States --
932.12	were kind of upholding this Enlightenment
932.12	pursuit of scientific rationality.
937.4	So I wanted to kind of twist it round
937.4	"and say, ""Let's look at us."""
942.48	We're looking through the glass case
942.48	at these shrunken heads.
945.4	Let's look at our own history and our own
945.4	cultural fascination with these things.
949.96	BG: Thank you for sharing that.
951.802	FL: Thank you.
953	(Applause)
