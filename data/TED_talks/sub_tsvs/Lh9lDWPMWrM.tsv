15.64	So, before I became a dermatologist,
18.047	I started in general medicine,
20.599	as most dermatologists do in Britain.
22.815	At the end of that time, I went off to Australia,
24.863	about 20 years ago.
26.759	What you learn when you go to Australia
28.88	is the Australians are very competitive.
31.606	And they are not magnanimous in victory.
33.663	And that happened a lot:
35.727	"""You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."""
38.159	I could accept that.
40.277	But moving into work --
42.607	and we have each week what's called a journal club,
45.145	when you'd sit down with the other doctors
47.603	and you'd study a scientific paper
49.723	in relation to medicine.
51.564	And after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,
54.313	a dry subject -- how many people die of heart disease,
57.993	what the rates are.
59.377	And they were competitive about this:
61.353	"""You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."""
64.449	And of course, they were right.
66.345	Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do --
70.326	less deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes --
74.117	they're generally a healthier bunch.
76.177	And of course they said this was because of
77.868	their fine moral standing, their exercise,
79.932	because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.
84	But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.
89.031	Within Britain, there is a gradient of health --
92.559	and this is what's called standardized mortality,
94.495	basically your chances of dying.
96.583	This is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,
99.927	but it's true today.
101.402	Comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north --
104.492	that's the South, that's London and places --
106.759	by latitude, and 55 degrees --
110.111	the bad news is that's here, Glasgow.
112.495	I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.
115.343	(Laughter)
119.467	So what accounts for this horrible space here
122.773	between us up here in southern Scotland
124.977	and the South?
125.987	Now, we know about smoking,
127.405	deep-fried Mars bars, chips -- the Glasgow diet.
130.107	All of these things.
131.435	But this graph is after taking into account
134.227	all of these known risk factors.
136.291	This is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,
140.06	all those other known risk factors.
141.803	We are left with this missing space
144.027	of increased deaths the further north you go.
147.887	Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this.
150.524	And vitamin D has had a great deal of press,
152.844	and a lot of people get concerned about it.
154.846	And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.
158.838	My grandmother grew up in Glasgow,
161.07	back in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem
164.656	and cod liver oil was brought in.
166.854	And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.
170.798	And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.
174.718	I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.
177.742	But an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,
182.524	the less heart disease they have, the less cancer.
185.851	There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.
189.693	And it is, to prevent rickets and so on.
191.987	But if you give people vitamin D supplements,
194.707	you don't change that high rate of heart disease.
198.139	And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.
201.867	So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.
206.724	It's not the only reason preventing heart disease.
210.035	High vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,
214.404	and sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,
217.619	is good for heart disease.
220.058	Anyway, I came back from Australia,
222.019	and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.
225.515	(Laughter)
228.067	Now, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.
231.218	But I also became interested in research,
233.163	and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.
236.338	Now these three guys up here,
237.714	Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad,
239.284	won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
242.546	And they were the first people to describe
244.689	this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
248.034	What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,
251.059	so it lowers your blood pressure.
252.93	It also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.
257.097	And what was remarkable about it
258.483	was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,
262.554	we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,
265.724	or nerve transmission.
267.194	Very complex processes with very complex chemicals
270.489	that fit into very complex receptors.
272.777	And here's this incredibly simple molecule,
275.138	a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,
278.476	and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,
283.106	for neurotransmission, for many, many things,
285.712	but particularly cardiovascular health.
289.114	And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,
292.416	that the skin produces nitric oxide.
295.026	So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
297.923	It arises in the skin.
299.79	Well, having found that and published that,
301.656	I thought, well, what's it doing?
303.712	How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?
305.192	It's not the heart. What do you do?
307.283	So I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,
311.354	and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.
315.091	And I was interested in these really complex systems.
317.704	We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,
321.745	and how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.
324.225	And I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,
327.592	and then I was using knockout mouse models --
329.712	mice that couldn't make the gene.
331.449	We worked out a mechanism, which -- NO was helping cells survive.
335.859	And I then moved back to Edinburgh.
339.68	And in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.
342.462	It's a species close to human,
344.52	with several advantages over mice:
346.422	They're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,
349.878	and nobody pickets your office saying,
351.998	"""Save the lab medical student."""
354.398	So they're really an ideal model.
357.661	But what we found
359.622	was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.
364.239	It seemed we couldn't turn off the production
367.479	of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.
370.559	We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,
373.351	we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.
377.735	And the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,
380.999	was that in the skin we have huge stores
385.047	not of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,
388.135	and it's released -- (Poof!) -- and in a few seconds it's away,
391.287	but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide --
394.511	nitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.
398.143	And these are more stable,
399.559	and your skin has got really large stores of NO.
403.719	And we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,
406.544	I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores
409.855	and release them from the skin,
411.599	where the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.
414.991	Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation,
417.831	and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?
423.071	Well, I'm an experimental dermatologist,
425.599	so what we did was we thought
426.904	we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.
430.431	And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers
434.511	and we exposed them to ultraviolet light.
437.209	So these are kind of sunlamps.
438.938	Now, what we were careful to do was,
441.634	vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays
444.594	and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.
448.57	So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.
452.417	When we put people under a lamp
454.698	for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,
459.774	what we produced was, we produced a rise
462.314	in circulating nitric oxide.
464.306	So we put patients with these subjects under the UV,
467.154	and their NO levels do go up,
469.57	and their blood pressure goes down.
471.706	Not by much, as an individual level,
474.083	but enough at a population level
476.45	to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.
480.17	And when we shone UV at them,
482.594	or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,
486.256	but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.
489.518	So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.
493.382	Now, we're still collecting data.
495.206	A few good things here:
496.654	This appeared to be more marked in older people.
499.801	I'm not sure exactly how much.
501.414	One of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,
503.187	and clearly I do not know her age.
506.139	But certainly in people older than my wife,
509.571	this appears to be a more marked effect.
512.704	And the other thing I should mention
513.955	was there was no change in vitamin D.
516.011	This is separate from vitamin D.
518.131	So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets,
519.667	it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.
521.907	But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
524.939	Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure
527.515	is your body does everything it can
529.067	to keep your blood pressure at the same place.
530.65	If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,
532.299	your body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,
535.204	do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.
537.428	That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.
540.404	So what we've next done
542.211	is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.
545.867	So we've measured -- this is again,
547.364	notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.
552.692	In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm
555.31	by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.
558.542	And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation --
562.017	this is the thick line here --
563.486	this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up
565.886	but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.
568.71	There is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.
572.622	But the active irradiation,
574.471	during the UV and for an hour after it,
577.823	there is dilation of the blood vessels.
579.92	This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,
582.52	by which you dilate the coronary arteries also,
584.896	to let the blood be supplied with the heart.
586.607	So here, further data that ultraviolet -- that's sunlight --
591	has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.
595.879	So we thought we'd just kind of model --
598.222	Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,
604.471	so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide --
608.495	the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin --
610.751	cleave to release NO.
613.623	Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
617.448	So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
619.527	And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,
623.512	it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
625.328	In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.
627.767	If you live up here, in summer
630.28	the sun is coming fairly directly down,
632.936	but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,
636.243	and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,
639.464	and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth
641.816	are different from summer to winter.
644.144	So what you can do is you can multiply those data
646.086	by the NO that's released
648.079	and you can calculate how much nitric oxide
651.263	would be released from the skin into the circulation.
654.432	Now, if you're on the equator here --
656.432	that's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line --
659.859	the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,
664.256	it's the area in this space here.
666.287	So if you're on the equator, December or June,
668.984	you've got masses of NO being released from the skin.
672.24	So Ventura is in southern California.
674.704	In summer, you might as well be at the equator.
676.92	It's great. Lots of NO is released.
678.976	Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.
682.919	Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,
686.88	but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released
691.095	is next to nothing, tiny amounts.
694.953	So what do we think?
696.758	We're still working at this story,
698.35	we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
700.262	We think it's very important.
701.91	We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,
705.503	It's of relevance to us.
707.134	We think that the skin --
708.822	well, we know that the skin has got very large stores
711.71	of nitric oxide as these various other forms.
713.934	We suspect a lot of these come from diet,
715.807	green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce
718.078	has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
721.398	We think they're then stored in the skin,
723.542	and we think the sunlight releases this
725.942	where it has generally beneficial effects.
728.575	And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists --
731.054	I mean, I'm a dermatologist.
732.774	"My day job is saying to people, ""You've got skin cancer,"
735.302	"it's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."""
737.182	I actually think a far more important message
739.918	is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.
743.342	Yes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,
749.095	but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher
751.966	than deaths from skin cancer.
753.918	And I think that we need to be more aware of,
756.567	and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.
758.646	How much sunlight is safe,
760.118	and how can we finesse this best for our general health?
764.318	So, thank you very much indeed.
766.498	(Applause)
