12.428	The world's largest and most devastating
12.428	environmental and industrial project
17.733	is situated in the heart of the largest
17.733	and most intact forest in the world,
21.598	Canada's boreal forest.
23.426	It stretches right across
23.426	Northern Canada, in Labrador,
27.873	it's home to the largest remaining
27.873	wild caribou herd in the world:
31.07	the George River caribou herd,
32.565	numbering approximately 400,000 animals.
34.758	Unfortunately, when I was there,
34.758	I couldn't find one of them,
37.64	but you have the antlers as proof.
39.949	All across the boreal,
41.351	we're blessed with this incredible
41.351	abundance of wetlands.
44.769	Wetlands, globally, are one
44.769	of the most endangered ecosystems.
49.126	They're absolutely critical ecosystems,
52.032	they clean air, they clean water,
54.637	they sequester large amounts
54.637	of greenhouse gases,
57.73	and they're home
57.73	to a huge diversity of species.
61.155	In the boreal, they are also the home
63.536	where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird
63.536	species found in North America
67.911	migrate north to breed
67.911	and raise their young.
72.571	In Ontario, the boreal marches down south
72.571	to the north shore of Lake Superior.
78.032	And these incredibly
78.032	beautiful boreal forests
81.569	were the inspiration for some of the most
81.569	famous art in Canadian history,
85.538	the Group of Seven
85.538	were very inspired by this landscape,
89.892	and so the boreal is not just a really key
89.892	part of our natural heritage,
95.274	but also an important part
95.274	of our cultural heritage.
98.566	In Manitoba, this is an image
98.566	from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,
102.538	and this is the home of the newly
102.538	designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.
108.531	In Saskatchewan,
108.531	as across all of the boreal,
111.573	home to some of our most famous rivers,
114.01	an incredible network of rivers and lakes
114.01	that every school-age child learns about,
119.09	the Peace, the Athabasca,
119.09	the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,
123.019	and these networks
123.019	were the historical routes
126.874	for the voyageur and the coureur de bois,
129.122	the first non-aboriginal
129.122	explorers of Northern Canada
132.453	that, taking from
132.453	the First Nations people,
135.236	used canoes and paddled to explore
137.64	for a trade route,
137.64	a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.
141.954	In the North, the boreal
141.954	is bordered by the tundra,
145.609	and just below that, in Yukon,
148.656	we have this incredible valley,
148.656	the Tombstone Valley.
152.158	And the Tombstone Valley is home
152.158	to the Porcupine caribou herd.
156.868	Now you've probably heard
156.868	about the Porcupine caribou herd
159.61	in the context of its breeding ground
159.61	in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
163.186	Well, the wintering ground
163.186	is also critical
165.432	and it also is not protected,
168.057	and is potentially, could be potentially,
168.057	exploited for gas and mineral rights.
174.855	The western border of the boreal
174.855	in British Columbia
177.333	is marked by the Coast Mountains,
178.974	and on the other side of those mountains
180.969	is the greatest remaining
180.969	temperate rainforest in the world,
183.821	the Great Bear Rainforest,
185.187	and we'll discuss that in a few minutes
185.187	in a bit more detail.
188.071	All across the boreal,
189.525	it's home for a huge incredible range
189.525	of indigenous peoples,
194.543	and a rich and varied culture.
197.616	And I think that one of the reasons
200.146	why so many of these groups have
200.146	retained a link to the past,
203.644	know their native languages,
205.68	the songs, the dances, the traditions,
208.042	I think part of that reason
208.042	is because of the remoteness,
211.577	the span and the wilderness
212.903	of this almost 95 percent
212.903	intact ecosystem.
217.033	And I think particularly now,
218.667	as we see ourselves in a time
218.667	of environmental crisis,
221.823	we can learn so much from these people
223.76	who have lived so sustainably
223.76	in this ecosystem
226.009	for over 10,000 years.
229.496	In the heart of this ecosystem
229.496	is the very antithesis
232.557	of all of these values
232.557	that we've been talking about,
235.06	and I think these
235.06	are some of the core values
237.222	that make us proud to be Canadians.
238.924	This is the Alberta tar sands,
240.764	the largest oil reserves on the planet
240.764	outside of Saudi Arabia.
245.39	Trapped underneath the boreal forest
245.39	and wetlands of northern Alberta
249.31	are these vast reserves
249.31	of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.
253.631	And the mining
253.631	and the exploitation of that
256.241	is creating devastation on a scale
256.241	that the planet has never seen before.
262.715	I want to try to convey
262.715	some sort of a sense of the size of this.
266.889	If you look at that truck there,
268.86	it is the largest truck
268.86	of its kind on the planet.
271.3	It is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck
274.07	and its dimensions are 45 feet long
274.07	by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.
281.254	If I stand beside that truck,
282.714	my head comes to around the bottom
282.714	of the yellow part of that hubcap.
286.616	Within the dimensions of that truck,
288.709	you could build a 3,000-square-foot
288.709	two-story home quite easily.
292.998	I did the math.
294.553	So instead of thinking of that as a truck,
294.553	think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.
299.802	That's not a bad size home.
301.722	And line those trucks / homes
301.722	back and forth
305.103	across there from the bottom
305.103	all the way to the top.
309.993	And then think of how large
309.993	that very small section of one mine is.
315.9	Now, you can apply that same kind
315.9	of thinking here as well.
319.492	Now, here you see --
319.492	of course, as you go further on,
322.225	these trucks become like a pixel.
324.505	Again, imagine those
324.505	all back and forth there.
327.921	How large is that one portion of a mine?
331.79	That would be a huge,
331.79	vast metropolitan area,
336.15	probably much larger
336.15	than the city of Victoria.
338.526	And this is just one of a number of mines,
344.584	This is one section of one mining complex,
347.214	and there are about another 40 or 50
347.214	in the approval process.
351.077	No tar sands mine has actually
351.077	ever been denied approval,
353.861	so it is essentially a rubber stamp.
357.498	The other method of extraction
357.498	is what's called the in situ.
360.463	And here, massive amounts of water
362.459	are superheated and pumped
362.459	through the ground,
365.49	through these vasts networks of pipelines,
367.602	seismic lines, drill paths,
367.602	compressor stations.
371.316	And even though this looks
371.316	maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,
375.483	it's even more damaging in some ways.
377.684	It impacts and fragments
377.684	a larger part of the wilderness,
383.083	where there is 90 percent
383.083	reduction of key species,
385.569	like woodland caribou and grizzly bears,
387.91	and it consumes
387.91	even more energy, more water,
391.442	and produces at least
391.442	as much greenhouse gas.
394.019	So these in situ developments are at least
394.019	as ecologically damaging as the mines.
401.717	The oil produced from either method
404.382	produces more greenhouse gas
404.382	emissions than any other oil.
408.958	This is one of the reasons
408.958	why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
412.596	It's also one of the reasons
413.973	why it is the largest and fastest-growing
413.973	single source of carbon in Canada,
419.193	and it is also a reason
419.193	why Canada is now number three
424.139	in terms of producing carbon per person.
428.778	The tailings ponds are the largest toxic
428.778	impoundments on the planet.
434.33	Oil sands -- or rather,
434.33	I should say tar sands --
436.896	oil sands is a PR-created term
439.205	so that the oil companies
439.205	wouldn't be trying to promote something
442.288	that sounds like a sticky tar-like
442.288	substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.
446.709	So they decided to call it oil sands.
449.106	The tar sands consume more water
449.106	than any other oil process,
452.952	three to five barrels of water
452.952	are taken, polluted
456.263	and then returned into tailings ponds,
458.583	the largest toxic
458.583	impoundments on the planet.
461.084	SemCrude, just one of the licensees,
461.084	in just one of their tailings ponds,
465.188	dumps 250,000 tons
465.188	of this toxic gunk every single day.
470.739	That's creating the largest toxic
470.739	impoundments in the history of the planet.
474.756	So far, this is enough toxin to cover
474.756	the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.
481.685	And the tailings ponds
481.685	range in size up to 9,000 acres.
486.592	That's two-thirds the size
486.592	of the entire island of Manhattan.
490.565	That's like from Wall Street
490.565	at the southern edge of Manhattan
493.558	up to maybe 120th Street.
496.171	So this is one of the larger
496.171	tailings ponds.
500.198	This might be, what? I don't know,
500.198	half the size of Manhattan.
503.265	And you can see in the context,
504.782	it's just a relatively small section
504.782	of one of 10 mining complexes
509.152	and another 40 to 50
509.152	on stream to be approved soon.
514.398	And of course, these tailings ponds --
516.978	well, you can't see
516.978	many ponds from outer space
519.557	and you can see these, so maybe
519.557	we should stop calling them ponds --
523.412	these massive toxic wastelands are built
527.24	unlined and on the banks
527.24	of the Athabasca River.
530.562	And the Athabasca River drains downstream
530.562	to a range of aboriginal communities.
534.971	In Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there,
534.971	are finding toxins in the food chain,
539.309	this has been scientifically proven.
541.719	The tar sands toxins
541.719	are in the food chain,
543.762	and this is causing cancer
543.762	rates up to 10 times
546.697	what they are in the rest of Canada.
549.767	In spite of that, people have to live,
549.767	have to eat this food in order to survive.
555.264	The incredibly high price of flying food
558.303	into these remote
558.303	Northern aboriginal communities
560.916	and the high rate of unemployment
562.615	makes this an absolute
562.615	necessity for survival.
565.709	And not that many years ago,
565.709	I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,
569.813	"and he said, ""When you"
569.813	go out on the river,
572.064	do not under any
572.064	circumstances eat the fish.
575.733	"It's carcinogenic."""
577.417	And yet, on the front porch
577.417	of that man's cabin,
581.962	I saw four fish.
583.393	He had to feed his family to survive.
586.193	And as a parent, I just can't imagine
586.193	what that does to your soul.
592.354	And that's what we're doing.
595.893	The boreal forest
595.893	is also perhaps our best defense
600.319	against global warming and climate change.
603.443	The boreal forest sequesters more carbon
603.443	than any other terrestrial ecosystem.
609.322	And this is absolutely key.
611.934	So what we're doing is,
613.828	we're taking the most concentrated
613.828	greenhouse gas sink --
619.517	twice as much greenhouse
619.517	gases are sequestered
622.074	in the boreal per acre
622.074	than the tropical rainforests.
626.088	And what we're doing is we're destroying
628.589	this carbon sink,
628.589	turning it into a carbon bomb.
631.645	And we're replacing that
631.645	with the largest industrial project
634.781	in the history of the world,
636.176	which is producing the most high-carbon
636.176	greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.
642.976	And we're doing this on the second largest
642.976	oil reserves on the planet.
648.183	This is one of the reasons why Canada,
648.183	originally a climate change hero --
651.984	we were one of the first
651.984	signatories of the Kyoto Accord.
655.372	Now we're the country
655.372	that has full-time lobbyists
657.816	in the European Union and Washington DC,
660.875	threatening trade wars
662.798	when these countries talk about wanting
662.798	to bring in positive legislation
667.548	to limit the import of high-carbon fuels,
670.583	of greenhouse gas emissions,
670.583	anything like this,
673.87	at international conferences,
673.87	whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,
678.408	international conferences
678.408	on climate change,
680.928	we're the country that gets
680.928	the dinosaur award every single day,
684.091	as being the biggest
684.091	obstacle to progress on this issue.
689.317	Just 70 miles downstream
691.747	is the world's largest freshwater delta,
691.747	the Peace-Athabasca Delta,
695.466	the only one at the juncture
695.466	of all four migratory flyways.
699.293	This is a globally significant wetland,
699.293	perhaps the greatest on the planet.
703.234	Incredible habitat
703.234	for half the bird species
706.967	you find in North America, migrating here.
710.611	And also the last refuge
710.611	for the largest herd of wild bison,
714.869	and also, of course, critical habitat
714.869	for another whole range of other species.
719.82	But it too is being threatened
721.973	by the massive amount of water
721.973	being drawn from the Athabasca,
725.637	which feeds these wetlands,
727.643	and also the incredible toxic burden
729.76	of the largest toxic unlined
729.76	impoundments on the planet,
732.557	which are leaching in to the food chain
732.557	for all the species downstream.
737.683	So as bad as all that is, things are going
737.683	to get much worse -- much, much worse.
741.652	This is the infrastructure
741.652	as we see it about now.
745.141	This is what's planned for 2015.
748.11	And you can see here
748.11	the Keystone Pipeline,
752.168	which would take tar sands raw
752.168	down to the Gulf Coast,
756.419	punching a pipeline through
756.419	the agricultural heart of North America,
760.726	of the United States,
763.106	and securing the contract
763.106	with the dirtiest fuel in the world
768.435	by consumption of the United States,
771.403	and promoting a huge disincentive
774.288	to a sustainable clean-energy
774.288	future for America.
778.14	Here you see the route
778.14	down the Mackenzie valley.
783.677	This would put a pipeline
783.677	to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea
787.363	through the heart of the third largest
787.363	watershed basin in the world,
792.051	and the only one
792.051	which is 95 percent intact.
795.231	And building a pipeline
795.231	with an industrial highway
798.639	would change forever
798.639	this incredible wilderness,
802.151	which is a true rarity
802.151	on the planet today.
807.306	So the Great Bear Rainforest
807.306	is just over the hill there,
811.575	within a few miles,
811.575	we go from these dry boreal forests
814.726	of 100-year-old trees,
814.726	maybe 10 inches across,
818.139	and soon, we're in the coastal
818.139	temperate rainforest,
820.6	rain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,
	different ecosystem.
827.278	And the Great Bear Rainforest
827.278	is generally considered to be
830.071	the largest coastal temperate rainforest
830.071	ecosystem in the world.
834.014	Some of the greatest densities
835.844	of some of the most iconic
835.844	and threatened species on the planet.
839.881	And yet there's a proposal,
839.881	of course, to build a pipeline
844.476	to take huge tankers,
848.359	through some of the most
848.359	difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,
851.838	where only just a few years ago,
851.838	a BC ferry ran aground.
856.202	When one of these tar sands tankers,
858.579	carrying the dirtiest oil,
861.965	eventually hits a rock and goes down,
864.298	we're going to have
864.298	one of the worst ecological disasters
867.232	this planet has ever seen.
869.799	And here we have the plan out to 2030.
872.903	What they're proposing is an almost
872.903	four-times increase in production,
877.48	and that would industrialize
877.48	an area the size of Florida.
882.271	In doing so, we'll be removing
882.271	a large part of our greatest carbon sink
887.127	and replacing it with the most high
887.127	greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.
893.581	The world does not need
893.581	any more tar mines.
897.697	The world does not need any more pipelines
900.661	to wed our addiction to fossil fuels.
903.841	And the world certainly does not need
905.857	the largest toxic impoundments
905.857	to grow and multiply
908.934	and further threaten
908.934	the downstream communities.
911.211	And let's face it, we all live downstream
913.231	in an era of global warming
913.231	and climate change.
917.043	What we need, is we all need to act
919.825	to ensure that Canada respects
919.825	the massive amounts of freshwater
924.521	that we hold in this country.
926.956	We need to ensure
926.956	that these wetlands and forests
929.305	that are our best and greatest
929.305	and most critical defense
932.611	against global warming are protected,
935.097	and we are not releasing
935.097	that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.
939.557	And we need to all gather together
939.557	and say no to the tar sands.
944.712	And we can do that.
945.887	there is a huge network
945.887	all over the world,
948.794	fighting to stop this project.
951.04	And I quite simply think
952.858	that this is not something
952.858	that should be decided just in Canada.
956.748	Everyone in this room,
956.748	everyone across Canada,
959.052	everyone listening to this presentation
961.037	has a role to play
961.037	and, I think, a responsibility.
963.863	Because what we do here
963.863	is going to change our history,
969.522	it's going to color
969.522	our possibility to survive,
972.239	and for our children to survive
972.239	and have a rich future.
977.749	We have an incredible gift in the boreal,
979.735	an incredible opportunity to preserve
979.735	our best defense against global warming,
984.987	but we could let that slip away.
987.715	The tar sands could threaten
987.715	not just a large section of the boreal.
991.717	It compromises the life and the health
994.714	of some of our most underprivileged
994.714	and vulnerable people,
999.262	the aboriginal communities
999.262	that have so much to teach us.
1003.131	It could destroy the Athabasca Delta,
1005.733	the largest and possibly greatest
1005.733	freshwater delta in the planet.
1010.389	It could destroy
1010.389	the Great Bear Rainforest,
1013.982	the largest temperate
1013.982	rainforest in the world.
1016.817	And it could have huge impacts
1018.849	on the future of the agricultural
1018.849	heartland of North America.
1023.337	I hope that you will all,
1023.337	if you've been moved by this presentation,
1026.555	join with the growing
1026.555	international community
1029.358	to get Canada to step up
1029.358	to its responsibilities,
1032.828	to convince Canada to go back
1032.828	to being a climate change champion
1037.238	instead of a climate change villain,
1038.995	and to say no to the tar sands,
1040.676	and yes to a clean energy future for all.
1043.369	Thank you so much.
1044.717	(Applause)
