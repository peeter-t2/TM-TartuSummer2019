13.052	Last year,
14.739	three of my family members
14.739	were gruesomely murdered
17.27	in a hate crime.
20.094	It goes without saying
20.094	that it's really difficult
22.452	for me to be here today,
24.199	but my brother Deah,
25.806	his wife Yusor,
27.246	and her sister Razan
28.801	don't give me much of a choice.
31.274	I'm hopeful that by the end
31.274	of this talk you will make a choice,
34.687	and join me in standing up against hate.
38.659	It's December 27, 2014:
41.77	the morning of my brother's wedding day.
44.026	He asks me to come over and comb his hair
46.114	in preparation
46.114	for his wedding photo shoot.
48.614	A 23-year-old, six-foot-three basketball,
48.614	particularly Steph Curry, fanatic --
53.971	(Laughter)
57.684	An American kid in dental school
57.684	ready to take on the world.
61.721	When Deah and Yusor
61.721	have their first dance,
64.506	I see the love in his eyes,
66.336	her reciprocated joy,
67.99	and my emotions begin to overwhelm me.
71.175	I move to the back of the hall
71.175	and burst into tears.
74.557	And the second the song finishes playing,
76.569	he beelines towards me,
77.78	buries me into his arms
79.055	and rocks me back and forth.
80.934	Even in that moment,
82.147	when everything was so distracting,
84.048	he was attuned to me.
85.925	He cups my face and says,
87.78	"""Suzanne,"
88.984	I am who I am because of you.
95.179	Thank you for everything.
96.867	"I love you."""
99.18	About a month later, I'm back home
99.18	in North Carolina for a short visit,
102.687	and on the last evening,
102.687	I run upstairs to Deah's room,
105.422	eager to find out how he's feeling
105.422	being a newly married man.
108.741	With a big boyish smile he says,
111.066	"""I'm so happy. I love her."
111.066	"She's an amazing girl."""
115.201	And she is.
116.902	At just 21, she'd recently
116.902	been accepted to join Deah
119.864	at UNC dental school.
121.974	She shared his love for basketball,
121.974	and at her urging,
125.273	they started their honeymoon off
125.273	attending their favorite team of the NBA,
129.22	the LA Lakers.
130.649	I mean, check out that form.
132.425	(Laughter)
139.233	I'll never forget that moment
139.233	sitting there with him --
142.028	how free he was in his happiness.
144.552	My littler brother,
144.552	a basketball-obsessed kid,
147.041	had become and transformed
147.041	into an accomplished young man.
151.448	He was at the top
151.448	of his dental school class,
153.623	and alongside Yusor and Razan,
155.224	was involved in local and international
155.224	community service projects
159.464	dedicated to the homeless and refugees,
161.817	including a dental relief trip
161.817	they were planning
164.128	for Syrian refugees in Turkey.
166.668	Razan, at just 19,
168.82	used her creativity
168.82	as an architectural engineering student
171.998	to serve those around her,
173.713	making care packages
173.713	for the local homeless,
175.984	among other projects.
178.235	That is who they were.
181.423	Standing there that night,
182.687	I take a deep breath
182.687	and look at Deah and tell him,
185.652	"""I have never been more proud of you"
185.652	"than I am in this moment."""
189.575	He pulls me into his tall frame,
191.404	hugs me goodnight,
192.591	and I leave the next morning
192.591	without waking him
194.845	to go back to San Francisco.
196.958	That is the last time I ever hug him.
202.617	Ten days later, I'm on call
202.617	at San Francisco General Hospital
205.639	when I receive a barrage of vague
205.639	text messages expressing condolences.
209.509	Confused, I call my father,
209.509	who calmly intones,
212.341	"""There's been a shooting"
212.341	in Deah's neighborhood in Chapel Hill.
215.366	"It's on lock-down. That's all we know."""
217.829	I hang up and quickly Google,
217.829	"""shooting in Chapel Hill."""
221.354	One hit comes up.
222.901	Quote:
224.347	"""Three people were shot"
224.347	in the back of the head
226.632	"and confirmed dead on the scene."""
228.819	Something in me just knows.
230.49	I fling out of my chair and faint
230.49	onto the gritty hospital floor,
233.634	wailing.
235.419	I take the first red-eye
235.419	out of San Francisco,
237.781	numb and disoriented.
239.443	I walk into my childhood home
239.443	and faint into my parents' arms,
242.972	sobbing.
244.178	I then run up to Deah's room
244.178	as I did so many times before,
247.12	just looking for him,
249.192	only to find a void
249.192	that will never be filled.
255.769	Investigation and autopsy reports
255.769	eventually revealed
259.03	the sequence of events.
262.069	Deah had just gotten
262.069	off the bus from class,
264.8	Razan was visiting for dinner,
266.403	already at home with Yusor.
268.55	As they began to eat,
268.55	they heard a knock on the door.
271.408	When Deah opened it,
273.46	their neighbor proceeded
273.46	to fire multiple shots at him.
278.787	According to 911 calls,
280.341	the girls were heard screaming.
283.516	The man turned towards the kitchen
283.516	and fired a single shot into Yusor's hip,
287.197	immobilizing her.
288.371	He then approached her from behind,
290.163	pressed the barrel of his gun
290.163	against her head,
292.432	and with a single bullet,
292.432	lacerated her midbrain.
296.365	He then turned towards Razan,
296.365	who was screaming for her life,
299.478	and, execution-style, with a single bullet
303.927	to the back of the head,
305.392	killed her.
307.754	On his way out,
308.929	he shot Deah one last time --
308.929	a bullet in the mouth --
312.23	for a total of eight bullets:
314.105	two lodged in the head,
315.983	two in his chest
317.518	and the rest in his extremities.
321.377	Deah, Yusor and Razan were executed
323.686	in a place that was meant
323.686	to be safe: their home.
327.821	For months, this man
327.821	had been harassing them:
330.339	knocking on their door,
331.768	brandishing his gun
331.768	on a couple of occasions.
334.579	His Facebook was cluttered
334.579	with anti-religion posts.
338.634	Yusor felt particularly threatened by him.
341.947	As she was moving in,
344.5	he told Yusor and her mom
344.5	that he didn't like the way they looked.
348.863	In response, Yusor's mom told her
348.863	to be kind to her neighbor,
352.305	that as he got to know them,
353.686	he'd see them for who they were.
357.28	I guess we've all become
357.28	so numb to the hatred
359.82	that we couldn't have ever imagined
359.82	it turning into fatal violence.
365.685	The man who murdered my brother
365.685	turned himself in to the police
368.68	shortly after the murders,
370.516	saying he killed three kids,
372.77	execution-style,
374.341	over a parking dispute.
377.321	The police issued a premature
377.321	public statement that morning,
380.228	echoing his claims
380.228	without bothering to question it
382.696	or further investigate.
384.703	It turns out there was no parking dispute.
387.774	There was no argument.
389.404	No violation.
391.197	But the damage was already done.
393.329	In a 24-hour media cycle,
395.406	"the words ""parking dispute"" had already"
395.406	become the go-to sound bite.
401.578	I sit on my brother's bed
401.578	and remember his words,
404.763	the words he gave me
404.763	so freely and with so much love,
408.026	"""I am who I am because of you."""
410.94	That's what it takes for me
410.94	to climb through my crippling grief
413.98	and speak out.
415.161	I cannot let my family's deaths
415.161	be diminished to a segment
417.967	that is barely discussed on local news.
420.73	They were murdered by their neighbor
420.73	because of their faith,
424.183	because of a piece of cloth
424.183	they chose to don on their heads,
427.665	because they were visibly Muslim.
433.72	Some of the rage I felt at the time
435.443	was that if roles were reversed,
437.388	and an Arab, Muslim
437.388	or Muslim-appearing person
441.227	had killed three white American
441.227	college students execution-style,
446.105	in their home,
447.285	what would we have called it?
450.041	A terrorist attack.
452.304	When white men commit
452.304	acts of violence in the US,
455.499	they're lone wolves,
456.743	mentally ill
457.957	or driven by a parking dispute.
463.323	I know that I have to give
463.323	my family voice,
465.935	and I do the only thing I know how:
468.155	I send a Facebook message
468.155	to everyone I know in media.
473.253	A couple of hours later,
474.728	in the midst of a chaotic house
474.728	overflowing with friends and family,
478.546	our neighbor Neal comes over,
478.546	sits down next to my parents
481.62	"and asks, ""What can I do?"""
484.933	Neal had over two decades
484.933	of experience in journalism,
488.559	but he makes it clear that he's not
488.559	there in his capacity as journalist,
491.988	but as a neighbor who wants to help.
494.367	I ask him what he thinks we should do,
496.232	given the bombardment
496.232	of local media interview requests.
499.31	He offers to set up a press conference
499.31	at a local community center.
505.431	Even now I don't have
505.431	the words to thank him.
508.649	"""Just tell me when, and I'll have"
508.649	"all the news channels present,"" he said."
512.87	He did for us what we
512.87	could not do for ourselves
515.162	in a moment of devastation.
517.737	I delivered the press statement,
519.356	still wearing scrubs
519.356	from the previous night.
521.507	And in under 24 hours from the murders,
523.542	I'm on CNN being interviewed
523.542	by Anderson Cooper.
527.03	The following day, major newspapers --
528.926	including the New York Times,
528.926	Chicago Tribune --
531.701	published stories about Deah,
531.701	Yusor and Razan,
534.356	allowing us to reclaim the narrative
536.555	and call attention the mainstreaming
536.555	of anti-Muslim hatred.
543.323	These days,
544.515	it feels like Islamophobia
544.515	is a socially acceptable form of bigotry.
549.987	We just have to put up with it and smile.
552.919	The nasty stares,
554.527	the palpable fear when boarding a plane,
556.954	the random pat downs at airports
556.954	that happen 99 percent of the time.
562.148	It doesn't stop there.
564.064	We have politicians reaping political
564.064	and financial gains off our backs.
568.288	Here in the US,
569.472	we have presidential candidates
569.472	like Donald Trump,
571.863	casually calling to register
571.863	American Muslims,
574.29	and ban Muslim immigrants and refugees
574.29	from entering this country.
578.353	It is no coincidence that hate crimes rise
581.101	in parallel with election cycles.
586.748	Just a couple months ago, Khalid Jabara,
589.056	a Lebanese-American Christian,
590.88	was murdered in Oklahoma
590.88	by his neighbor --
593.66	"a man who called him a ""filthy Arab."""
596.627	This man was previously jailed
596.627	for a mere 8 months,
599.362	after attempting run over
599.362	Khalid's mother with his car.
603.627	Chances are you haven't heard
603.627	Khalid's story,
606.505	because it didn't make it
606.505	to national news.
609.232	The least we can do is call it what it is:
612.029	a hate crime.
613.369	The least we can do is talk about it,
616.184	because violence and hatred
616.184	doesn't just happen in a vacuum.
623.759	Not long after coming back to work,
625.478	I'm the senior on rounds in the hospital,
627.48	when one of my patients
627.48	looks over at my colleague,
630.12	gestures around her face
630.12	"and says, ""San Bernardino,"""
633.697	referencing a recent terrorist attack.
636.596	Here I am having just lost three
636.596	family members to Islamophobia,
640.184	having been a vocal advocate
640.184	within my program
642.38	on how to deal with such microaggressions,
644.631	and yet --
645.814	silence.
647.535	I was disheartened.
649.207	Humiliated.
651.413	Days later rounding on the same patient,
653.372	she looks at me and says,
654.712	"""Your people are killing"
654.712	"people in Los Angeles."""
659.216	I look around expectantly.
661.303	Again:
662.648	silence.
664.865	I realize that yet again,
666.619	I have to speak up for myself.
669.8	I sit on her bed and gently ask her,
672.308	"""Have I ever done anything"
672.308	but treat you with respect and kindness?
677.395	Have I done anything but give
677.395	"you compassionate care?"""
681.143	She looks down and realizes
681.143	what she said was wrong,
683.602	and in front of the entire team,
685.361	she apologizes and says,
686.901	"""I should know better."
686.901	I'm Mexican-American.
689.511	I receive this kind
689.511	"of treatment all the time."""
695.339	Many of us experience
695.339	microaggressions on a daily basis.
699.156	Odds are you may have experienced it,
701.525	whether for your race,
702.948	gender,
704.123	sexuality
705.298	or religious beliefs.
706.731	We've all been in situations
706.731	where we've witnessed something wrong
709.888	and didn't speak up.
711.172	Maybe we weren't equipped
711.172	with the tools to respond in the moment.
714.853	Maybe we weren't even aware
714.853	of our own implicit biases.
719.466	We can all agree that bigotry
719.466	is unacceptable,
722.609	but when we see it,
723.838	we're silent,
725.029	because it makes us uncomfortable.
727.834	But stepping right into that discomfort
730.012	means you are also stepping
730.012	into the ally zone.
733.472	There may be over three million
733.472	Muslims in America.
736.672	That's still just one percent
736.672	of the total population.
740.966	Martin Luther King once said,
742.591	"""In the end,"
743.955	we will remember not
743.955	the words of our enemies,
747.098	"but the silence of our friends."""
753.65	So what made my neighbor
753.65	Neal's allyship so profound?
757.313	A couple of things.
759.17	He was there as a neighbor who cared,
761.351	but he was also bringing in
761.351	his professional expertise and resources
764.567	when the moment called for it.
766.926	Others have done the same.
769.113	Larycia Hawkins drew on her platform
771.598	as the first tenured African-American
771.598	professor at Wheaton College
775.11	to wear a hijab in solidarity
776.788	with Muslim women who face
776.788	discrimination every day.
780.07	As a result, she lost her job.
783.821	Within a month,
784.995	she joined the faculty
784.995	at the University of Virginia,
787.542	where she now works on pluralism,
787.542	race, faith and culture.
792.562	Reddit cofounder, Alexis Ohanian,
794.946	demonstrated that not all active
794.946	allyship needs to be so serious.
799.057	He stepped up to support
799.057	a 15-year-old Muslim girl's mission
801.957	to introduce a hijab emoji.
804.028	(Laughter)
806.035	It's a simple gesture,
807.648	but it has a significant
807.648	subconscious impact
810.209	on normalizing and humanizing Muslims,
813.472	including the community
813.472	"as a part of an ""us"""
816.141	"instead of an ""other."""
819.352	The editor in chief
819.352	of Women's Running magazine
821.693	just put the first hijabi to ever be
821.693	on the cover of a US fitness magazine.
827.001	These are all very different examples
828.787	of people who drew upon
828.787	their platforms and resources
831.766	in academia, tech and media,
834.123	to actively express their allyship.
837.839	What resources and expertise
837.839	do you bring to the table?
841.589	Are you willing to step
841.589	into your discomfort
843.689	and speak up when you witness
843.689	hateful bigotry?
846.826	Will you be Neal?
849.258	Many neighbors appeared in this story.
851.576	And you, in your respective communities,
851.576	all have a Muslim neighbor,
855.368	colleague
856.545	or friend your child plays with at school.
858.9	Reach out to them.
860.392	Let them know you stand
860.392	with them in solidarity.
863.332	It may feel really small,
864.748	but I promise you it makes a difference.
869.268	Nothing will ever bring back
869.268	Deah, Yusor and Razan.
873.723	But when we raise our collective voices,
876.094	that is when we stop the hate.
878.35	Thank you.
879.536	(Applause)
