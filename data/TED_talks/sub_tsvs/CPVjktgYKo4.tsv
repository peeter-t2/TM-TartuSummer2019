12.48	The narrative of a rising Africa
12.48	is being challenged.
16.36	About 10 years ago,
16.36	I spoke about an Africa,
20.84	an Africa of hope and opportunity,
23.56	an Africa of entrepreneurs,
25.52	an Africa very different from the Africa
25.52	that you normally hear about
29	of death, poverty and disease.
31.8	And that what I spoke about,
33.88	became part of what is known now
33.88	as the narrative of the rising Africa.
39.36	I want to tell you two stories
39.36	about this rising Africa.
42.72	The first has to do with Rwanda,
44.52	a country that has gone
44.52	through many trials and tribulations.
47.96	And Rwanda has decided to become
47.96	the technology hub, or a technology hub
52.48	on the continent.
53.84	It's a country with mountainous
53.84	and hilly terrain,
56.88	a little bit like here,
58.12	so it's very difficult
58.12	to deliver services to people.
61.32	So what has Rwanda said?
63.04	In order to save lives,
63.04	it's going to try using drones
66.72	to deliver lifesaving drugs,
66.72	vaccines and blood
69.96	to people in hard-to-reach places
72	in partnership with
72	a company called Zipline,
74.52	with UPS, and also with the Gavi,
74.52	a global vaccine alliance.
79.08	In doing this, it will save lives.
81.48	This is part of the type of innovation
81.48	we want to see in the rising Africa.
86.8	The second story has to do with something
89.36	that I'm sure most of you
89.36	have seen or will remember.
92.4	Very often, countries in Africa
92.4	suffer drought and floods,
96.32	and it's getting more frequent
96.32	because of climate change effects.
100.04	When this happens, they normally wait
100.04	for international appeals to raise money.
105.76	You see pictures of children
105.76	with flies on their faces,
109.16	carcasses of dead animals and so on.
111.68	Now these countries,
114.72	under the auspices of the African Union
117.2	and decided to form an organization
117.2	called the African Risk Capacity.
122.24	What does it do?
123.48	It's a weather-based insurance agency,
125.6	and what these countries do
125.6	is to pay insurance each year,
130	about 3 million dollars a year
130	of their own resources,
132.96	so that in the event they have
132.96	a difficult drought situation or flood,
137.8	this money will be paid out to them,
140.44	which they can then use
140.44	to take care of their populations,
143.2	instead of waiting for aid to come.
146	The African Risk Capacity
146	last year paid 26 million dollars
150.24	to Mauritania, Senegal and Niger.
152.76	This enabled them to take care
152.76	of 1.3 million people affected by drought.
158.24	They were able to restore livelihoods,
160.6	buy fodder for cattle,
160.6	feed children in school
163.32	and in short keep the populations home
163.32	instead of migrating out of the area.
169.12	So these are the kinds of stories
171	of an Africa ready
171	to take responsibility for itself,
174.64	and to look for solutions
174.64	for its own problems.
177.84	But that narrative is being challenged now
180.36	because the continent has not
180.36	been doing well in the last two years.
185.2	It had been growing
185.2	at five percent per annum
188.16	for the last one and a half decades,
190.12	but this year's forecast
190.12	was three percent. Why?
192.92	In an uncertain global environment,
192.92	commodity prices have fallen.
197.12	Many of the economies
197.12	are still commodity driven,
200.32	and therefore their
200.32	performance has slipped.
203.48	And now the issue of Brexit
203.48	doesn't make it any easier.
207.48	I never knew that the Brexit could happen
211.12	and that it could be one of the things
211.12	that would cause global uncertainty
215.28	such as we have.
216.6	So now we've got this situation,
218.8	and I think it's time to take stock
221.68	and to say what were the things
221.68	that the African countries did right?
226.56	What did they do wrong?
228.84	How do we build on all of this
228.84	and learn lessons
231.32	so that we can keep Africa rising?
234.72	So let me talk about six things
234.72	that I think we did right.
238.72	The first is managing
238.72	our economies better.
242.04	The '80s and '90s were the lost decades,
242.04	when Africa was not doing well,
246.32	and some of you will remember
246.32	"an ""Economist"" cover"
249.96	"that said, ""The Lost Continent."""
252	But in the 2000s, policymakers learned
256.12	that they needed to manage
256.12	the macroeconomic environment better,
260.4	to ensure stability,
261.96	keep inflation low in single digits,
264.6	keep their fiscal deficits low,
264.6	below three percent of GDP,
270.2	give investors, both domestic and foreign,
274.12	some stability so they'll have confidence
274.12	to invest in these economies.
277.96	So that was number one.
279.48	Two, debt.
280.84	In 1994, the debt-to-GDP ratio
280.84	of African countries was 130 percent,
286.56	and they didn't have fiscal space.
288.84	They couldn't use their resources
288.84	to invest in their development
291.88	because they were paying debt.
293.36	There may be some of you in this room
293.36	who worked to support African countries
298.12	to get debt relief.
299.44	So private creditors, multilaterals
299.44	and bilaterals came together
303.92	and decided to do the Highly Indebted
303.92	Poor Countries Initiative
307.56	and give debt relief.
308.84	So this debt relief in 2005
310.96	made the debt-to-GDP ratio
310.96	fall down to about 30 percent,
314.92	and there was enough resources
314.92	to try and reinvest.
318.84	The third thing was
318.84	loss-making enterprises.
321.32	Governments were involved in business
323.4	which they had no business being in.
325.68	And they were running businesses,
325.68	they were making losses.
328.8	So some of these enterprises
328.8	were restructured,
331.56	commercialized, privatized or closed,
334	and they became
334	less of a burden on government.
338.08	The fourth thing
338.08	was a very interesting thing.
341.2	The telecoms revolution came,
343.52	and African countries jumped on it.
346.12	In 2000, we had 11 million phone lines.
348.76	Today, we have about 687 million
348.76	mobile lines on the continent.
354.12	And this has enabled us
355.96	to go, move forward
355.96	with some mobile technology
358.64	where Africa is actually leading.
361.28	In Kenya, the development
361.28	of mobile money --
363.84	M-Pesa, which all of you
363.84	have heard about --
366.64	it took some time for the world
366.64	to notice that Africa was ahead
370.12	in this particular technology.
371.68	And this mobile money
371.68	is also providing a platform
374.92	for access to alternative energy.
377.4	You know, people who can now pay for solar
380.92	the same way they pay
380.92	for cards for their telephone.
385.16	So this was a very good development,
385.16	something that went right.
390.24	We also invested more
390.24	in education and health, not enough,
394.76	but there were some improvements.
	in the last one and a half decades.
402.52	The other thing was
402.52	that conflicts decreased.
405.92	There were many conflicts
405.92	on the continent.
408	Many of you are aware of that.
409.48	But they came down, and our leaders
409.48	even managed to dampen some coups.
414.32	New types of conflicts have emerged,
414.32	and I'll refer to those later.
418.4	So based on all this, there's also
418.4	some differentiation on the continent
422.04	that I want you to know about,
423.52	because even as
423.52	the doom and gloom is here,
426.04	there are some countries --
426.04	CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Kenya, Ethiopia,
430.04	Tanzania and Senegal are performing
430.04	relatively well at the moment.
435.12	But what did we do wrong?
437.28	Let me mention eight things.
438.68	You have to have
438.68	more things wrong than right.
440.88	(Laughter)
442.36	So there are eight things we did wrong.
444.76	The first was that even though we grew,
444.76	we didn't create enough jobs.
448.8	We didn't create jobs for our youth.
450.72	Youth unemployment on the continent
450.72	is about 15 percent,
453.68	and underemployment is a serious problem.
457.4	The second thing that we did is that
457.4	the quality of growth was not good enough.
462.96	Even those jobs we created
462.96	were low-productivity jobs,
466.52	so we moved people
466.52	from low-productivity agriculture
470.04	to low-productivity commerce
470.04	and working in the informal sector
474	in the urban areas.
476.24	The third thing
476.24	is that inequality increased.
480.6	So we created more billionaires.
488.32	own more wealth than the bottom
493.92	Poverty,
495.52	the proportion of people in poverty --
495.52	that's the fourth thing -- did decrease,
499.92	but the absolute numbers did not
499.92	because of population growth.
504.04	And population growth is something
506.64	that we don't have enough
506.64	of a dialogue about on the continent.
510.08	And I think we will need
510.08	to get a handle on it,
513.24	particularly how we educate girls.
516.52	That is the road to really working
516.52	on this particular issue.
521.88	The fifth thing is that we didn't invest
521.88	enough in infrastructure.
528.72	We had investment from the Chinese.
530.84	That helped some countries,
530.84	but it's not enough.
534.08	The consumption of electricity
534.08	in Africa on the continent
537.44	in Sub-Saharan Africa
537.44	is equivalent to Spain.
541.04	The total consumption
541.04	is equivalent to that of Spain.
544.52	So many people are living in the dark,
547.2	and as the President of the African
547.2	Development Bank said recently,
550.8	Africa cannot develop in the dark.
554.12	The other thing we have not done
556.28	is that our economies
556.28	retain the same structure
561.72	that we've had for decades.
563.36	So even though we've been growing,
565.04	the structure of the economies
565.04	has not changed very much.
567.76	We are still exporting commodities,
570.36	and exporting commodities is what?
570.36	It's exporting jobs.
574.24	Our manufacturing value-added
574.24	is only 11 percent.
577.56	We are not creating enough
577.56	decent manufacturing jobs for our youth,
582.12	and trade among ourselves is low.
584.76	Only about 12 percent of our trade
584.76	is among ourselves.
588.28	So that's another serious problem.
591	Then governance.
593.12	Governance is a serious issue.
595.56	We have weak institutions,
597.8	and sometimes nonexistent institutions,
597.8	and I think this gives way for corruption.
602.84	Corruption is an issue that we have not
602.84	yet gotten a good enough handle on,
608.08	and we have to fight tooth and nail,
610.72	that and increased transparency
610.72	in the way we manage our economies
614.32	and the way we manage our finances.
616.8	We also need to be wary of new conflicts,
621.56	new types of conflicts,
623.52	such as we have with Boko Haram
623.52	in my country, Nigeria,
626.76	and with Al-Shabaab in Kenya.
628.84	We need to partner
628.84	with international partners,
632.2	developed countries,
632.2	to fight this together.
635.08	Otherwise, we create a new reality
637	which is not the type
637	we want for a rising Africa.
640.28	And finally, the issue of education.
643.84	Our education systems
643.84	in many countries are broken.
647.16	We are not creating the types of skills
647.16	needed for the future.
651.72	So we have to find a way
651.72	to educate better.
654.92	So those are the things
654.92	that we are not doing right.
658.24	Now, where do we go from there?
661.24	I believe that the way forward
661.24	is to learn to manage success.
665.96	Very often, when people succeed
665.96	or countries succeed,
669.72	they forget what made them succeed.
672.68	Learning what you're successful at,
675.24	managing it and keeping it
675.24	is vital for us.
677.68	So all those things I said we did right,
679.92	we have to learn to do it right again,
679.92	keep doing it right.
683.84	Managing the economy while
683.84	creating stability is vital,
687.44	getting prices right,
687.44	and policy consistency.
690.96	Very often, we are not consistent.
693.36	One regime goes out, another comes in
695.64	and they throw away even the functioning
695.64	policies that were there before.
699.12	What does this do?
700.4	It creates uncertainty
700.4	for people, for households,
702.8	uncertainties for business.
704.2	They don't know whether and how to invest.
706.92	Debt: we must manage
706.92	the success we had in reducing our debt,
711.28	but now countries
711.28	are back to borrowing again,
713.84	and we see our debt-to-GDP ratio
713.84	beginning to creep up,
717.28	and in certain countries,
718.76	debt is becoming a problem,
718.76	so we have to avoid that.
721.28	So managing success.
722.76	The next thing
722.76	is focusing with a laser beam
725.44	on those things we did not do well.
727.32	First and foremost is infrastructure.
729.2	Yes, most countries now recognize
729.2	they have to invest in this,
732.8	and they are trying to do
732.8	the best they can to do that.
735.44	We must.
736.68	The most important thing is power.
738.36	You cannot develop in the dark.
740.64	And then governance and corruption:
742.92	we have to fight.
744.16	We have to make our countries transparent.
746.96	And above all, we have to
746.96	engage our young people.
750.56	We have genius in our young people.
752.8	I see it every day.
754.08	It's what makes me wake up
754.08	in the morning and feel ready to go.
757.64	We have to unleash
757.64	the genius of our young people,
760.04	get out of their way,
760.04	support them to create and innovate
763.32	and lead the way.
764.56	And I know that they will lead us
764.56	in the right direction.
767.28	And our women, and our girls:
769.48	we have to recognize
769.48	that girls and women are a gift.
772.56	They have strength,
774.08	and we have to unleash that strength
776.24	so that they can
776.24	contribute to the continent.
779.2	I strongly believe
779.2	that when we do all of these things,
783.04	we find that the rising Africa narrative
786.28	is not a fluke.
787.88	It's a trend.
789.72	It's a trend, and if we continue,
789.72	if we unleash our youth,
793.56	if we unleash our women,
794.92	we may step backwards sometimes,
796.96	we may even step sideways,
798.88	but the trend is clear.
800.52	Africa will continue to rise.
802.56	And I tell you businesspeople
802.56	in the audience,
806.32	investment in Africa is not for today,
806.32	is not for tomorrow,
809.8	it's not a short-term thing,
809.8	it's a longer term thing.
813.08	But if you are not invested in Africa,
815.52	then you will be missing
816.96	one of the most important
816.96	emerging opportunities in the world.
821.24	Thank you.
822.48	(Applause)
831.227	Kelly Stoetzel: So you mentioned
831.227	corruption in your talk,
833.92	and you're known, well-known
833.92	as a strong anticorruption fighter.
837.44	But that's had consequences.
840	People have fought back,
840	and your mother was kidnapped.
842.96	How have you been handling this?
845.28	Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala:
845.28	It's been very difficult.
847.48	Thank you for mentioning
847.48	the issue of the kidnap of my mother.
851.84	It's a very difficult subject.
854.44	But what it means
854.44	is that when you fight corruption,
858.32	when you touch the pockets
858.32	of people who are stealing money,
861.76	they don't just keep quiet.
863.64	They fight back, and the issue for you
863.64	is when they try to intimidate you,
867.32	do you give up, or do you fight on?
870.8	Do you find a way
870.8	to stay on and fight back?
873.96	And the answer that I had
873.96	with the teams I worked with
878.24	is we have to fight on.
880.04	We have to create those institutions.
881.88	We have to find ways to stop these people
885.12	from taking away
885.12	the heritage of the future.
888.32	And so that's what we did.
890.24	And even out of government,
890.24	we continued to make that point.
893.88	In our countries, nobody,
893.88	nobody is going to fight corruption
897.88	for us but us.
899.44	And therefore,
899.44	that comes with consequences,
901.68	and we just have to do the best we can.
903.6	But I thank you and thank TED
903.6	for giving us a voice
907.04	to say to those people, you will not win,
910.36	and we will not be intimidated.
912.72	Thank you.
913.96	(Applause)
915.2	Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much
915.2	for your great talk and important work.
918.69	(Applause)
