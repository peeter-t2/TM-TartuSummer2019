12.454	On June 12, 2014, precisely at 3:33
18.966	in a balmy winter afternoon
18.966	in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,
23.106	a typical South American winter afternoon,
26.632	this kid, this young man 
26.632	that you see celebrating here
29.612	like he had scored a goal,
31.131	Juliano Pinto, 29 years old,
31.131	accomplished a magnificent deed.
38.102	Despite being paralyzed
40.182	and not having any sensation
40.182	from mid-chest to the tip of his toes
45.163	as the result of a car crash six years ago
45.163	that killed his brother
49.693	and produced a complete spinal cord lesion
49.693	that left Juliano in a wheelchair,
57.187	Juliano rose to the occasion,
57.187	and on this day did something
62.217	that pretty much everybody that saw him 
62.217	in the six years deemed impossible.
69.062	Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick
74.394	of the 2014 Brazilian 
74.394	World Soccer Cup here
80.41	just by thinking.
82.82	He could not move his body,
84.697	but he could imagine the movements
84.697	needed to kick a ball.
89.584	He was an athlete before the lesion.
89.584	He's a para-athlete right now.
92.838	He's going to be in the Paralympic Games,
92.838	I hope, in a couple years.
96.3	But what the spinal cord lesion 
96.3	did not rob from Juliano
100.882	was his ability to dream.
103.883	And dream he did that afternoon,
103.883	for a stadium of about 75,000 people
109.933	and an audience of close to a billion
109.933	watching on TV.
114.424	And that kick crowned, basically,
120.725	studying how the brain,
122.972	how this amazing universe
122.972	that we have between our ears
126.699	that is only comparable to universe
126.699	that we have above our head
130.795	because it has about 100 billion elements
133.561	talking to each other
133.561	through electrical brainstorms,
136.263	what Juliano accomplished
136.263	took 30 years to imagine in laboratories
141.504	and about 15 years to plan.
144.107	When John Chapin and I,
148.606	that we would build something
148.606	that we called a brain-machine interface,
153.788	meaning connecting a brain to devices
156.745	so that animals and humans
156.745	could just move these devices,
160.289	no matter how far they are
160.289	from their own bodies,
162.14	just by imagining what they want to do,
164.726	our colleagues told us that
164.726	we actually needed professional help,
169.313	of the psychiatry variety.
172.01	And despite that,
172.01	a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,
177.456	because that's how we were raised
177.456	in our respective countries,
182.471	and for 12, 15 years,
184.607	we made demonstration after demonstration
184.607	suggesting that this was possible.
188.996	And a brain-machine interface
188.996	is not rocket science,
191.445	it's just brain research.
193.171	It's nothing but using sensors
196.418	to read the electrical brainstorms
196.418	that a brain is producing
199.965	to generate the motor commands
201.971	that have to be downloaded
201.971	to the spinal cord,
204.184	so we projected sensors that can read
206.847	hundreds and now thousands
206.847	of these brain cells simultaneously,
210.362	and extract from these electrical signals
213.408	the motor planning
213.408	that the brain is generating
216.293	to actually make us move into space.
219.256	And by doing that, we converted
219.256	these signals into digital commands
222.942	that any mechanical, electronic,
222.942	or even a virtual device can understand
227.934	so that the subject can imagine
227.934	what he, she or it wants to make move,
234.49	and the device obeys that brain command.
237.941	By sensorizing these devices
237.941	with lots of different types of sensors,
241.845	as you are going to see in a moment,
243.63	we actually sent messages
243.63	back to the brain to confirm
247.099	that that voluntary motor will
247.099	was being enacted, no matter where --
251.054	next to the subject, next door,
251.054	or across the planet.
256.429	And as this message gave feedback
256.429	back to the brain,
259.67	the brain realized its goal:
259.67	to make us move.
263.888	So this is just one experiment
263.888	that we published a few years ago,
267.346	where a monkey, without moving its body,
269.673	learned to control the movements
269.673	of an avatar arm,
273.777	a virtual arm that doesn't exist.
275.823	What you're listening to
275.823	is the sound of the brain of this monkey
279.025	as it explores three different
279.025	visually identical spheres
283.429	in virtual space.
285.088	And to get a reward,
285.088	a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,
289.13	this animal has to detect,
289.13	select one of these objects
292.942	by touching,
294.703	not by seeing it, by touching it,
296.355	because every time this virtual hand
296.355	touches one of the objects,
299.4	an electrical pulse goes back
299.4	to the brain of the animal
302.483	describing the fine texture
302.483	of the surface of this object,
306.876	so the animal can judge what is 
306.876	the correct object that he has to grab,
310.774	and if he does that, he gets a reward
310.774	without moving a muscle.
316.018	The perfect Brazilian lunch:
318.498	not moving a muscle
318.498	and getting your orange juice.
322.213	So as we saw this happening,
325.017	we actually came and proposed the idea
325.017	that we had published 15 years ago.
329.962	We reenacted this paper.
331.991	We got it out of the drawers,
333.96	and we proposed that perhaps we could get
333.96	a human being that is paralyzed
337.887	to actually use the brain-machine
337.887	interface to regain mobility.
342.19	The idea was that if you suffered --
344.368	and that can happen to any one of us.
346.641	Let me tell you, it's very sudden.
348.653	It's a millisecond of a collision,
350.378	a car accident that
350.378	transforms your life completely.
353.84	If you have a complete lesion
353.84	of the spinal cord,
356.697	you cannot move because your brainstorms
356.697	cannot reach your muscles.
360.08	However, your brainstorms
360.08	continue to be generated in your head.
364.33	Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients
364.33	dream about moving every night.
368.245	They have that inside their head.
370.397	The problem is how
370.397	to get that code out of it
373.738	and make the movement be created again.
376.662	So what we proposed was,
376.662	let's create a new body.
379.883	Let's create a robotic vest.
381.619	And that's exactly why Juliano could
381.619	kick that ball just by thinking,
386.462	because he was wearing
386.462	the first brain-controlled robotic vest
390.781	that can be used by paraplegic,
390.781	quadriplegic patients to move
394.06	and to regain feedback.
395.871	That was the original idea, 15 years ago.
398.768	What I'm going to show you is how
404.242	all over the five continents
404.242	of this beautiful Earth,
407.011	dropped their lives,
407.011	dropped their patents,
410.029	dropped their dogs, wives,
410.029	kids, school, jobs,
414.139	and congregated to come to Brazil
414.139	for 18 months to actually get this done.
419.656	Because a couple years after Brazil
419.656	was awarded the World Cup,
423.531	we heard that the Brazilian government
423.531	wanted to do something meaningful
427.183	in the opening ceremony
428.881	in the country that reinvented
428.881	and perfected soccer
432.621	until we met the Germans, of course.
434.827	(Laughter)
436.22	But that's a different talk,
438.055	and a different neuroscientist
438.055	needs to talk about that.
442.095	But what Brazil wanted to do
442.095	is to showcase
444.169	a completely different country,
445.894	a country that values science
445.894	and technology,
448.782	and can give a gift to millions,
452.665	that cannot move any longer
452.665	because of a spinal cord injury.
455.5	Well, we went to the Brazilian government
455.5	and to FIFA and proposed,
459.104	well, let's have the kickoff
459.104	of the 2014 World Cup
462.472	be given by a Brazilian paraplegic
464.844	using a brain-controlled exoskeleton
464.844	that allows him to kick the ball
469.734	and to feel the contact of the ball.
472.01	They looked at us,
472.01	thought that we were completely nuts,
474.624	"and said, ""Okay, let's try."""
477.48	We had 18 months to do everything
477.48	from zero, from scratch.
481.72	We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,
484.956	we had nothing done.
486.173	These people came all together
488.509	and in 18 months, we got eight patients
488.509	in a routine of training
492.757	and basically built from nothing this guy,
496.855	that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.
501.315	The first brain-controlled
501.315	exoskeleton to be built
504.74	was named after the most famous
504.74	Brazilian scientist ever,
508.896	Alberto Santos Dumont,
510.869	who, on October 19, 1901,
510.869	created and flew himself
516.672	the first controlled airship on air
516.672	in Paris for a million people to see.
523.899	Sorry, my American friends,
525.918	I live in North Carolina,
527.228	but it was two years
527.228	before the Wright Brothers flew
532.11	on the coast of North Carolina.
534.274	(Applause)
537.339	Flight control is Brazilian.
537.339	(Laughter)
542.117	So we went together with these guys
545.117	and we basically put
545.117	this exoskeleton together,
	hydraulic machine
551.99	that can be commanded by brain signals
554.707	recorded by a non-invasive technology
554.707	called electroencephalography
558.925	that can basically allow the patient
558.925	to imagine the movements
562.114	and send his commands
562.114	to the controls, the motors,
566.065	and get it done.
567.867	This exoskeleton was covered
567.867	with an artificial skin
570.73	invented by Gordon Cheng,
570.73	one of my greatest friends, in Munich,
574.814	to allow sensation from the joints moving
574.814	and the foot touching the ground
579.4	to be delivered back to the patient
579.4	through a vest, a shirt.
583.94	It is a smart shirt
583.94	with micro-vibrating elements
586.91	that basically delivers the feedback
586.91	and fools the patient's brain
591.733	by creating a sensation that it is not
591.733	a machine that is carrying him,
595.204	but it is he who is walking again.
598.454	So we got this going,
598.454	and what you'll see here
601.313	is the first time one of our patients,
601.313	Bruno, actually walked.
606.003	And he takes a few seconds
606.003	because we are setting everything,
608.881	and you are going to see a blue light
608.881	cutting in front of the helmet
612.178	because Bruno is going to imagine
612.178	the movement that needs to be performed,
616.098	the computer is going to analyze it,
616.098	Bruno is going to certify it,
619.306	and when it is certified,
621.115	the device starts moving
621.115	under the command of Bruno's brain.
624.642	And he just got it right,
624.642	and now he starts walking.
629.217	After nine years without
629.217	being able to move,
632.003	he is walking by himself.
634.673	And more than that --
636.275	(Applause) --
639.503	more than just walking,
641.29	he is feeling the ground,
643.608	and if the speed of the exo goes up,
645.651	he tells us that he is walking again
645.651	on the sand of Santos,
650.102	the beach resort where he used to go
650.102	before he had the accident.
654.293	That's why the brain is creating
654.293	a new sensation in Bruno's head.
657.757	So he walks, and at the end of the walk --
657.757	I am running out of time already --
661.456	"he says, ""You know, guys,"
664.18	I need to borrow this thing from you
664.18	when I get married,
666.811	because I wanted to walk to the priest
669.316	and see my bride and actually
669.316	be there by myself.
673.09	Of course, he will have it
673.09	whenever he wants.
676.482	And this is what we wanted to show
676.482	during the World Cup, and couldn't,
680.564	because for some mysterious reason,
680.564	FIFA cut its broadcast in half.
685.618	What you are going to see very quickly
685.618	is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick
693.291	a few minutes before we went to the pitch
695.588	and did the real thing
695.588	in front of the entire crowd,
698.499	and the lights you are going to see
698.499	just describe the operation.
701.88	Basically, the blue lights pulsating
701.88	indicate that the exo is ready to go.
706.768	It can receive thoughts
706.768	and it can deliver feedback,
709.843	and when Juliano
709.843	makes the decision to kick the ball,
712.861	you are going to see
712.861	two streams of green and yellow light
715.964	coming from the helmet
715.964	and going to the legs,
718.641	representing the mental commands
718.641	that were taken by the exo
722.742	to actually make that happen.
724.641	And in basically 13 seconds,
727.336	Juliano actually did.
729.419	You can see the commands.
731.135	He gets ready, 
731.135	the ball is set, and he kicks.
735.475	And the most amazing thing is,
	and looked at us on the pitch,
740.585	he told us, celebrating as you saw,
742.862	"""I felt the ball."""
745.562	And that's priceless.
747.759	(Applause)
749.631	So where is this going to go?
751.131	I have two minutes to tell you
753.066	that it's going to the limits
753.066	of your imagination.
756.316	Brain-actuating technology is here.
758.495	This is the latest: We just
758.495	published this a year ago,
761.049	the first brain-to-brain interface
763.282	that allows two animals
763.282	to exchange mental messages
766.909	so that one animal that sees something
766.909	coming from the environment
770.485	can send a mental SMS,
770.485	a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,
776.042	to the second animal,
777.648	and the second animal performs
777.648	the act that he needed to perform
781.525	without ever knowing what
781.525	the environment was sending as a message,
785.983	because the message came
785.983	from the first animal's brain.
789.279	So this is the first demo.
791.649	I'm going to be very quick
791.649	because I want to show you the latest.
795.603	But what you see here
795.603	is the first rat getting informed
801.192	by a light that is going to show up
801.192	on the left of the cage
804.125	that he has to press the left cage
804.125	to basically get a reward.
807.865	He goes there and does it.
809.658	And the same time,
809.658	he is sending a mental message
811.984	to the second rat
811.984	that didn't see any light,
815.007	and the second rat,
815.007	in 70 percent of the times
817.368	is going to press the left lever
817.368	and get a reward
821.581	without ever experiencing
821.581	the light in the retina.
825.716	Well, we took this
825.716	to a little higher limit
829.85	by getting monkeys to collaborate 
829.85	mentally in a brain net,
834.582	basically to donate their brain activity
836.772	and combine them to move
836.772	the virtual arm that I showed you before,
840.29	and what you see here is the first time
840.29	the two monkeys combine their brains,
845.058	synchronize their brains perfectly
845.058	to get this virtual arm to move.
849.316	One monkey is controlling the x dimension,
852.116	the other monkey
852.116	is controlling the y dimension.
854.996	But it gets a little more interesting
854.996	when you get three monkeys in there
859.176	and you ask one monkey to control x and y,
862.983	the other monkey to control y and z,
865.654	and the third one to control x and z,
868.532	and you make them all
868.532	play the game together,
870.648	moving the arm in 3D into a target
870.648	to get the famous Brazilian orange juice.
876.602	And they actually do.
878.987	The black dot is the average
878.987	of all these brains working
883.161	in parallel, in real time.
886.019	That is the definition
886.019	of a biological computer,
889.105	interacting by brain activity
889.105	and achieving a motor goal.
893.647	Where is this going?
895.536	We have no idea.
898.121	We're just scientists.
899.921	(Laughter)
901.218	We are paid to be children,
903.774	to basically go to the edge
903.774	and discover what is out there.
907.764	But one thing I know:
909.45	One day, in a few decades,
911.635	when our grandchildren
911.635	surf the Net just by thinking,
915.157	or a mother donates her eyesight
915.157	to an autistic kid who cannot see,
919.475	or somebody speaks because
919.475	of a brain-to-brain bypass,
922.403	some of you will remember
922.403	that it all started on a winter afternoon
928.73	in a Brazilian soccer field
928.73	with an impossible kick.
932.502	Thank you.
934.498	(Applause)
943.962	Thank you.
959.44	Bruno Giussani: Miguel,
959.44	thank you for sticking to your time.
963.004	I actually would have given you
963.004	a couple more minutes,
965.529	because there are a couple of points
965.529	we want to develop, and, of course,
968.913	clearly it seems that we need connected 
968.913	brains to figure out where this is going.
972.81	So let's connect all this together.
974.712	So if I'm understanding correctly,
976.381	one of the monkeys
976.381	is actually getting a signal
978.88	and the other monkey
978.88	is reacting to that signal
981.146	just because the first one is receiving it
981.146	and transmitting the neurological impulse.
985.631	Miguel Nicolelis: 
985.631	No, it's a little different.
987.855	No monkey knows of the existence
987.855	of the other two monkeys.
990.746	They are getting a visual feedback in 2D,
993.682	but the task they have
993.682	to accomplish is 3D.
996.355	They have to move an arm
996.355	in three dimensions.
998.954	But each monkey is only getting
998.954	the two dimensions on the video screen
1002.356	that the monkey controls.
1004.132	And to get that thing done,
1007.15	you need at least two monkeys
1007.15	to synchronize their brains,
1009.964	but the ideal is three.
1011.735	So what we found out is that
1011.735	when one monkey starts slacking down,
1015.351	the other two monkeys
1015.351	enhance their performance
1017.962	to get the guy to come back,
1019.944	so this adjusts dynamically,
1022.05	but the global synchrony remains the same.
1026.399	Now, if you flip
1026.399	without telling the monkey
1029.023	the dimensions that each brain
1029.023	has to control,
1031.321	like this guy is controlling x and y,
1033.62	but he should be controlling now y and z,
1036.035	instantaneously, that animal's brain
1036.035	forgets about the old dimensions
1040.818	and it starts concentrating
1040.818	on the new dimensions.
1043.336	So what I need to say is
1043.336	that no Turing machine,
1046.623	no computer can predict
1046.623	what a brain net will do.
1050.825	So we will absorb technology
1050.825	as part of us.
1053.206	Technology will never absorb us.
1055.815	It's simply impossible.
1058.456	BG: How many times have you tested this?
1061.506	And how many times
1061.506	have you succeeded versus failed?
1064.051	MN: Oh, tens of times.
1066.327	With the three monkeys?
1066.327	Oh, several times.
1068.565	I wouldn't be able to talk about this here
1068.565	unless I had done it a few times.
1073.185	And I forgot to mention, because of time,
1075.786	that just three weeks ago,
1075.786	a European group
1079.547	just demonstrated the first
1079.547	man-to-man brain-to-brain connection.
1084.637	BG: And how does that play?
1086.157	MN: There was one bit of information --
1086.157	big ideas start in a humble way --
1090.739	but basically the brain activity
1090.739	of one subject
1097.102	was transmitted to a second object,
1097.102	all non-invasive technology.
1101.308	So the first subject got a message,
1101.308	like our rats, a visual message,
1105.552	and transmitted it to the second subject.
1108.106	The second subject received
1108.106	a magnetic pulse in the visual cortex,
1112.588	or a different pulse,
1112.588	two different pulses.
1116.094	In one pulse, the subject saw something.
1118.799	On the other pulse,
1118.799	he saw something different.
1120.935	And he was able to verbally indicate
1122.918	what was the message
1122.918	the first subject was sending
1125.958	through the Internet across continents.
1128.853	Moderator: Wow.
1128.853	Okay, that's where we are going.
1131.372	That's the next TED Talk
1131.372	at the next conference.
1133.689	Miguel Nicolelis, thank you.
1133.689	MN: Thank you, Bruno. Thank you.
