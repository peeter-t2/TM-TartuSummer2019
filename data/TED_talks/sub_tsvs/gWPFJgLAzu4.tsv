12.48	A hundred years ago this month,
12.48	a 36-year-old Albert Einstein
16.2	stood up in front of the Prussian
16.2	Academy of Sciences in Berlin
19.48	to present a radical new theory
19.48	of space, time and gravity:
23.96	the general theory of relativity.
27	General relativity is unquestionably
27	Einstein's masterpiece,
30.08	a theory which reveals the workings
30.08	of the universe at the grandest scales,
34.08	capturing in one beautiful line of algebra
36.48	everything from why apples fall from trees
36.48	to the beginning of time and space.
	to be a physicist.
44.84	Two new ideas were turning
44.84	the subject on its head.
48.36	One was Einstein's theory of relativity,
50.72	the other was arguably
50.72	even more revolutionary:
53.92	quantum mechanics,
55.4	a mind-meltingly strange
55.4	yet stunningly successful new way
58.96	of understanding the microworld,
58.96	the world of atoms and particles.
63.92	Over the last century,
63.92	these two ideas have utterly transformed
67.6	our understanding of the universe.
69.36	It's thanks to relativity
69.36	and quantum mechanics
71.72	that we've learned
71.72	what the universe is made from,
74.08	how it began
74.08	and how it continues to evolve.
77.36	A hundred years on, we now find ourselves
77.36	at another turning point in physics,
81.68	but what's at stake now
81.68	is rather different.
84.84	The next few years may tell us
84.84	whether we'll be able
87.32	to continue to increase
87.32	our understanding of nature,
90.2	or whether maybe for the first time
90.2	in the history of science,
93.64	we could be facing questions
93.64	that we cannot answer,
97.6	not because we don't have
97.6	the brains or technology,
100.2	but because the laws of physics
100.2	themselves forbid it.
104.56	This is the essential problem:
104.56	the universe is far, far too interesting.
109.16	Relativity and quantum mechanics
109.16	appear to suggest
111.84	that the universe
111.84	should be a boring place.
114.16	It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.
117.08	But when we look around us, we see we live
117.08	in a universe full of interesting stuff,
121.04	full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.
124.12	The question is, ultimately,
125.64	why does all this interesting stuff exist?
128.96	Why is there something
128.96	rather than nothing?
133.08	This contradiction is the most pressing
133.08	problem in fundamental physics,
136.6	and in the next few years, we may find out
136.6	whether we'll ever be able to solve it.
143.08	At the heart of this problem
143.08	are two numbers,
146.2	two extremely dangerous numbers.
148.72	These are properties of the universe
148.72	that we can measure,
151.44	and they're extremely dangerous
153	because if they were different,
153	even by a tiny bit,
155.44	then the universe as we know it
155.44	would not exist.
158.72	The first of these numbers is associated
158.72	with the discovery that was made
162.2	a few kilometers from this hall,
162.2	at CERN, home of this machine,
165.2	the largest scientific device
165.2	ever built by the human race,
168.28	the Large Hadron Collider.
170.16	The LHC whizzes subatomic particles
170.16	around a 27-kilometer ring,
174.16	getting them closer and closer
174.16	to the speed of light
176.64	before smashing them into each other
176.64	inside gigantic particle detectors.
181.32	On July 4, 2012, physicists
181.32	at CERN announced to the world
185.84	that they'd spotted
185.84	a new fundamental particle
188.4	being created at the violent collisions
188.4	at the LHC: the Higgs boson.
193.44	Now, if you followed the news at the time,
195.52	you'll have seen a lot of physicists
195.52	getting very excited indeed,
198.6	and you'd be forgiven for thinking
200.28	we get that way every time
200.28	we discover a new particle.
202.84	Well, that is kind of true,
204.2	but the Higgs boson
204.2	is particularly special.
206.92	We all got so excited
206.92	because finding the Higgs
209.4	proves the existence
209.4	of a cosmic energy field.
212.76	Now, you may have trouble
212.76	imagining an energy field,
215.4	but we've all experienced one.
216.853	If you've ever held a magnet
216.853	close to a piece of metal
219.413	and felt a force pulling across that gap,
221.56	then you've felt the effect of a field.
223.442	And the Higgs field
223.442	is a little bit like a magnetic field,
226.84	except it has a constant value everywhere.
229.68	It's all around us right now.
231.16	We can't see it or touch it,
232.92	but if it wasn't there,
234.16	we would not exist.
236.2	The Higgs field gives mass
238	to the fundamental particles
238	that we're made from.
240.4	If it wasn't there, those particles
240.4	would have no mass,
243.04	and no atoms could form
243.04	and there would be no us.
246.88	But there is something deeply mysterious
246.88	about the Higgs field.
251.36	Relativity and quantum mechanics tell us
251.36	that it has two natural settings,
255.08	a bit like a light switch.
256.76	It should either be off,
258.16	so that it has a zero value
258.16	everywhere in space,
260.84	or it should be on so it has
260.84	an absolutely enormous value.
264.84	In both of these scenarios,
264.84	atoms could not exist,
267.6	and therefore all the other
267.6	interesting stuff
269.76	that we see around us
269.76	in the universe would not exist.
273	In reality, the Higgs field
273	is just slightly on,
276.64	not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker
276.64	than its fully on value,
281.72	a bit like a light switch that's got stuck
281.72	just before the off position.
286.48	And this value is crucial.
288.12	If it were a tiny bit different,
290	then there would be
290	no physical structure in the universe.
293.68	So this is the first
293.68	of our dangerous numbers,
295.88	the strength of the Higgs field.
297.96	Theorists have spent decades
297.96	trying to understand
300.72	why it has this very peculiarly
300.72	fine-tuned number,
303.4	and they've come up
303.4	with a number of possible explanations.
306.24	They have sexy-sounding names
306.24	"like ""supersymmetry"""
309.2	"or ""large extra dimensions."""
311.16	I'm not going to go
311.16	into the details of these ideas now,
313.96	but the key point is this:
316.36	if any of them explained this weirdly
316.36	fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,
320.24	then we should see new particles
320.24	being created at the LHC
324	along with the Higgs boson.
326	So far, though, we've not seen
326	any sign of them.
329.96	But there's actually an even worse example
332.04	of this kind of fine-tuning
332.04	of a dangerous number,
334.44	and this time it comes
334.44	from the other end of the scale,
337.08	from studying the universe
337.08	at vast distances.
339.96	One of the most important consequences
339.96	of Einstein's general theory of relativity
344.32	was the discovery that the universe began
344.32	as a rapid expansion of space and time
352.56	Now, according to early versions
352.56	of the Big Bang theory,
355.24	the universe has been expanding ever since
357.44	with gravity gradually putting
357.44	the brakes on that expansion.
361.52	But in 1998, astronomers made
361.52	the stunning discovery
364.88	that the expansion of the universe
364.88	is actually speeding up.
367.72	The universe is getting
367.72	bigger and bigger faster and faster
370.88	driven by a mysterious repulsive force
370.88	called dark energy.
375.28	Now, whenever you hear
375.28	"the word ""dark"" in physics,"
377.72	you should get very suspicious
379.24	because it probably means
379.24	we don't know what we're talking about.
382.32	(Laughter)
383.36	We don't know what dark energy is,
385.4	but the best idea is that it's the energy
385.4	of empty space itself,
390.16	the energy of the vacuum.
392.4	Now, if you use good old
392.4	quantum mechanics to work out
394.96	how strong dark energy should be,
396.6	you get an absolutely astonishing result.
399.84	You find that dark energy
401.72	should be 10 to the power
401.72	of 120 times stronger
405.72	than the value we observe from astronomy.
408.56	That's one with 120 zeroes after it.
413.4	This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge
416	that it's impossible
416	to get your head around.
418.24	"We often use the word ""astronomical"""
418.24	when we're talking about big numbers.
421.76	Well, even that one won't do here.
423.44	This number is bigger
423.44	than any number in astronomy.
425.88	It's a thousand trillion
425.88	trillion trillion times bigger
429	than the number of atoms
429	in the entire universe.
432.44	So that's a pretty bad prediction.
434.28	In fact, it's been called
434.28	the worst prediction in physics,
437.019	and this is more than just
437.019	a theoretical curiosity.
440.32	If dark energy were
440.32	anywhere near this strong,
443.08	then the universe
443.08	would have been torn apart,
445.24	stars and galaxies could not form,
445.24	and we would not be here.
449.24	So this is the second
449.24	of those dangerous numbers,
451.6	the strength of dark energy,
453	and explaining it requires an even more
453	fantastic level of fine-tuning
456.96	than we saw for the Higgs field.
458.84	But unlike the Higgs field,
458.84	this number has no known explanation.
465	The hope was that a complete combination
467.48	of Einstein's general
467.48	theory of relativity,
469.72	which is the theory
469.72	of the universe at grand scales,
472.32	with quantum mechanics, the theory
472.32	of the universe at small scales,
475.8	might provide a solution.
477.68	Einstein himself
477.68	spent most of his later years
480.16	on a futile search
480.16	for a unified theory of physics,
483.36	and physicists have kept at it ever since.
486.76	One of the most promising candidates
486.76	for a unified theory is string theory,
490.92	and the essential idea is,
492.24	if you could zoom in on the fundamental
492.24	particles that make up our world,
495.76	you'd see actually
495.76	that they're not particles at all,
498.44	but tiny vibrating strings of energy,
501.08	with each frequency of vibration
501.08	corresponding to a different particle,
505.44	a bit like musical notes
505.44	on a guitar string.
508.68	So it's a rather elegant, almost poetic
508.68	way of looking at the world,
512.08	but it has one catastrophic problem.
515.56	It turns out that string theory
515.56	isn't one theory at all,
518.48	but a whole collection of theories.
520.8	It's been estimated, in fact,
522.24	that there are 10 to the 500
522.24	different versions of string theory.
526.2	Each one would describe
526.2	a different universe
528.6	with different laws of physics.
530.76	Now, critics say this makes
530.76	string theory unscientific.
533.4	You can't disprove the theory.
535.36	But others actually
535.36	turned this on its head
537.384	and said, well,
537.384	maybe this apparent failure
539.68	is string theory's greatest triumph.
542.04	What if all of these 10 to the 500
542.04	different possible universes
545.44	actually exist out there somewhere
547.68	in some grand multiverse?
550.44	Suddenly we can understand
552.16	the weirdly fine-tuned values
552.16	of these two dangerous numbers.
555.76	In most of the multiverse,
557.08	dark energy is so strong
557.08	that the universe gets torn apart,
560.08	or the Higgs field is so weak
560.08	that no atoms can form.
563.44	We live in one of the places
563.44	in the multiverse
565.64	where the two numbers are just right.
568.04	We live in a Goldilocks universe.
571.64	Now, this idea is extremely controversial,
571.64	and it's easy to see why.
576.52	If we follow this line of thinking,
578.44	then we will never be able
578.44	to answer the question,
580.84	"""Why is there something"
580.84	"rather than nothing?"""
583.32	In most of the multiverse,
583.32	there is nothing,
585.52	and we live in one of the few places
587.36	where the laws of physics
587.36	allow there to be something.
591.36	Even worse, we can't test
591.36	the idea of the multiverse.
594.52	We can't access these other universes,
596.68	so there's no way of knowing
596.68	whether they're there or not.
601.64	So we're in an extremely
601.64	frustrating position.
605	That doesn't mean
605	the multiverse doesn't exist.
607.72	There are other planets,
607.72	other stars, other galaxies,
610.32	so why not other universes?
612.52	The problem is, it's unlikely
612.52	we'll ever know for sure.
616.72	Now, the idea of the multiverse
616.72	has been around for a while,
620.08	but in the last few years,
620.08	we've started to get the first solid hints
623.36	that this line of reasoning
623.36	may get born out.
627.28	Despite high hopes
627.28	for the first run of the LHC,
630.68	what we were looking for there --
632.276	we were looking
632.276	for new theories of physics:
634.36	supersymmetry or large extra dimensions
636.28	that could explain this weirdly
636.28	fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.
640.52	But despite high hopes, the LHC
640.52	revealed a barren subatomic wilderness
644.76	populated only by a lonely Higgs boson.
648.68	My experiment published paper after paper
651.04	where we glumly had to conclude
651.04	that we saw no signs of new physics.
656.4	The stakes now could not be higher.
659.08	This summer, the LHC began
659.08	its second phase of operation
662	with an energy almost double
662	what we achieved in the first run.
665.28	What particle physicists
665.28	are all desperately hoping for
667.96	are signs of new particles,
667.96	micro black holes,
670.76	or maybe something totally unexpected
672.88	emerging from the violent collisions
672.88	at the Large Hadron Collider.
676.52	If so, then we can continue
676.52	this long journey
678.88	that began 100 years ago
678.88	with Albert Einstein
681.48	towards an ever deeper understanding
681.48	of the laws of nature.
685.76	But if, in two or three years' time,
687.8	when the LHC switches off again
687.8	for a second long shutdown,
691.16	we've found nothing but the Higgs boson,
693.48	then we may be entering
693.48	a new era in physics:
697.32	an era where there are weird features
697.32	of the universe that we cannot explain;
702.12	an era where we have hints
702.12	that we live in a multiverse
705.2	that lies frustratingly
705.2	forever beyond our reach;
709	an era where we will never be able
709	to answer the question,
712.28	"""Why is there something"
712.28	"rather than nothing?"""
715.36	Thank you.
716.6	(Applause)
723.04	Bruno Giussani: Harry,
723.04	even if you just said
726.12	the science may not have some answers,
728	I would like to ask you a couple
728	of questions, and the first is:
731.04	building something like the LHC
731.04	is a generational project.
734.08	I just mentioned, introducing you,
734.08	that we live in a short-term world.
738.4	How do you think so long term,
741.28	projecting yourself out a generation
741.28	when building something like this?
744.64	Harry Cliff: I was very lucky
746.08	that I joined the experiment
746.08	I work on at the LHC in 2008,
748.92	just as we were switching on,
750.325	and there are people in my research group
750.325	who have been working on it
753.6	for three decades,
753.6	their entire careers on one machine.
756.24	So I think the first conversations
756.24	about the LHC were in 1976,
759.44	and you start planning the machine
759.44	without the technology
762.16	that you know you're going to need
762.16	to be able to build it.
764.6	So the computing power
764.6	did not exist in the early '90s
767.16	when design work began in earnest.
768.804	One of the big detectors
768.804	which record these collisions,
771.044	they didn't think there was technology
772.92	that could withstand the radiation
772.92	that would be created in the LHC,
775.8	so there was basically a lump of lead
775.8	in the middle of this object
778.56	with some detectors around the outside,
780.16	but subsequently
780.16	we have developed technology.
782.08	So you have to rely on people's ingenuity,
782.08	that they will solve the problems,
785.44	but it may be a decade
785.44	or more down the line.
787.32	BG: China just announced
787.32	two or three weeks ago
789.56	that they intend to build
791.04	a supercollider twice the size of the LHC.
794.04	I was wondering how you
794.04	and your colleagues welcome the news.
797.68	HC: Size isn't everything, Bruno.
797.68	BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.
800.44	(Laughter)
802.24	It sounds funny for a particle
802.24	physicist to say that.
804.36	But I mean, seriously, it's great news.
806.72	So building a machine like the LHC
809.24	requires countries from all over the world
809.24	to pool their resources.
812.04	No one nation can afford
812.04	to build a machine this large,
814.4	apart from maybe China,
815.64	because they can mobilize
815.64	huge amounts of resources,
817.88	manpower and money
817.88	to build machines like this.
819.96	So it's only a good thing.
821.24	What they're really planning to do
821.24	is to build a machine
823.6	that will study the Higgs boson in detail
823.6	and could give us some clues
826.36	as to whether these new ideas,
826.36	like supersymmetry, are really out there,
829.32	so it's great news for physics, I think.
831.249	BG: Harry, thank you.
831.249	HC: Thank you very much.
833.449	(Applause)
