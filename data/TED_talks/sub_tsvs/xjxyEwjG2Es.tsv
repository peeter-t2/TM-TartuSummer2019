12.709	Type is something we consume
14.235	in enormous quantities.
16.157	In much of the world,
17.239	it's completely inescapable.
19.107	But few consumers are concerned to know
22.13	where a particular typeface came from
24.462	or when or who designed it,
27.226	if, indeed, there was any human agency involved
30.579	in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize
33.376	out of the software ether.
37.088	But I do have to be concerned with those things.
40.613	It's my job.
42.13	I'm one of the tiny handful of people
44.34	who gets badly bent out of shape
46.454	by the bad spacing of the T and the E
49.048	that you see there.
50.948	I've got to take that slide off.
52.39	I can't stand it. Nor can Chris.
54.461	There. Good.
56.122	So my talk is about the connection
57.89	between technology and design of type.
61.29	The technology has changed
63.953	a number of times since I started work:
66.825	photo, digital, desktop, screen, web.
71.486	I've had to survive those changes and try
73.224	to understand their implications for what I do
75.928	for design.
77.319	This slide is about the effect of tools on form.
82.489	The two letters, the two K's,
85.39	the one on your left, my right, is modern,
88.715	made on a computer.
90.126	All straight lines are dead straight.
92.168	The curves have that kind of
92.168	mathematical smoothness
94.978	that the Bézier formula imposes.
98.724	On the right, ancient Gothic,
101.221	cut in the resistant material of steel by hand.
105.28	None of the straight lines are actually straight.
107.405	The curves are kind of subtle.
109.57	It has that spark of life from the human hand
114.284	that the machine or the program
116.198	can never capture.
118.131	What a contrast.
120.11	Well, I tell a lie.
122.689	A lie at TED. I'm really sorry.
125.677	Both of these were made on a computer,
127.798	same software, same Bézier curves,
129.724	same font format.
131.416	The one on your left
133.95	was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,
136.204	and I did the other one.
137.639	The tool is the same, yet the letters are different.
140.995	The letters are different
142.518	because the designers are different.
143.724	That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.
146.985	I wanted mine to look like that. End of story.
150.106	Type is very adaptable.
152.31	Unlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,
155.631	type hides its methods.
159.03	I think of myself as an industrial designer.
161.827	The thing I design is manufactured,
163.393	and it has a function:
165.269	to be read, to convey meaning.
167.107	But there is a bit more to it than that.
168.753	There's the sort of aesthetic element.
170.601	What makes these two letters different
173.317	from different interpretations by different designers?
176.349	What gives the work of some designers
178.362	sort of characteristic personal style,
181.273	as you might find in the work of a fashion designer,
183.81	an automobile designer, whatever?
186.885	There have been some cases, I admit,
188.66	where I as a designer
189.81	did feel the influence of technology.
192.899	This is from the mid-'60s,
195.959	the change from metal type to photo,
198.194	hot to cold.
199.896	This brought some benefits
201.093	but also one particular drawback:
204.439	a spacing system that only provided
211.095	to be accommodated on.
213.558	I was asked at this time to design
215.534	a series of condensed sans serif types
218.272	with as many different variants as possible
221.435	within this 18-unit box.
225.282	Quickly looking at the arithmetic,
226.921	I realized I could only actually make three
230.23	of related design. Here you see them.
233.617	In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,
236.208	and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system
240.019	really boxed me in.
241.592	It kind of determined the proportions
243.425	of the design.
245.714	Here are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.
249.744	So do you look at these and say,
252.436	"""Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,"
255.575	"and by God it shows in the results."""
259.382	I hope not.
260.689	If I were doing this same job today,
262.93	instead of having 18 spacing units,
265.756	I would have 1,000.
268.84	Clearly I could make more variants,
271.293	but would these three members
271.293	of the family be better?
275.989	It's hard to say without actually doing it,
277.841	but they would not be better in the proportion
279.548	of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.
282.637	My instinct tells you that any improvement
284.575	would be rather slight, because they were designed
287.653	as functions of the system they were designed to fit,
290.574	and as I said, type is very adaptable.
292.983	It does hide its methods.
295.77	All industrial designers work within constraints.
298.452	This is not fine art.
300.944	The question is, does a constraint
302.822	force a compromise?
305.489	By accepting a constraint,
307	are you working to a lower standard?
309.449	I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged
311.411	by something that Charles Eames said.
313.535	He said he was conscious of working
315.08	within constraints,
316.118	but not of making compromises.
319.344	The distinction between a constraint
321.905	and a compromise is obviously very subtle,
324.28	but it's very central to my attitude to work.
329.951	Remember this reading experience?
332.842	The phone book. I'll hold the slide
334.267	so you can enjoy the nostalgia.
338.802	This is from the mid-'70s early trials
341.548	of Bell Centennial typeface I designed
344.177	for the U.S. phone books,
345.951	and it was my first experience of digital type,
349.27	and quite a baptism.
353.44	Designed for the phone books, as I said,
355.039	to be printed at tiny size on newsprint
358.407	on very high-speed rotary presses
360.725	with ink that was kerosene and lampblack.
363.477	This is not a hospitable environment
367.318	for a typographic designer.
370.52	So the challenge for me was to design type
372.419	that performed as well as possible
373.92	in these very adverse production conditions.
378.665	As I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.
381.52	I had to draw every character by hand
384.339	on quadrille graph paper --
386.054	there were four weights of Bell Centennial —
388.006	pixel by pixel, then encode
388.006	them raster line by raster line
391.359	for the keyboard.
392.34	It took two years, but I learned a lot.
396.764	These letters look as though they've been chewed
398.394	by the dog or something or other,
399.838	but the missing pixels at the intersections
401.78	of strokes or in the crotches
403.385	are the result of my studying the effects
406.559	of ink spread on cheap paper
409.505	and reacting, revising the font accordingly.
413.242	These strange artifacts are designed to compensate
416.492	for the undesirable effects of scale
419.244	and production process.
421.53	At the outset, AT&amp;T had wanted
424.376	to set the phone books in Helvetica,
427.617	but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said
429.282	in the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,
431.785	the letters in Helvetica were designed to be
433.82	as similar to one another as possible.
436.561	This is not the recipe for legibility at small size.
439.835	It looks very elegant up on a slide.
442.425	I had to disambiguate these forms
444.615	of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial
447.615	by sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see
449.91	in the bottom part of that slide.
452.823	So now we're on to the mid-'80s,
455.48	the early days of digital outline fonts,
458.036	vector technology.
460.393	There was an issue at that time
462.431	with the size of the fonts,
464.287	the amount of data that was required to find
467.171	and store a font in computer memory.
472.141	It limited the number of fonts you could get
473.799	on your typesetting system at any one time.
476.789	I did an analysis of the data,
480.938	and found that a typical serif face
483.462	you see on the left
484.921	needed nearly twice as much data
486.937	as a sans serif in the middle
489.473	because of all the points required
491.535	to define the elegantly curved serif brackets.
496.043	The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,
499.477	they represent the amount of data
501.179	needed to store each of the fonts.
504.984	So the sans serif, in the middle,
507.15	sans the serifs, was much more economical,
512.313	"""Aha,"" I thought. ""The engineers have a problem."
515.97	"Designer to the rescue."""
518.205	I made a serif type, you can see it on the right,
520.552	without curved serifs.
522.499	I made them polygonal, out
522.499	of straight line segments,
524.915	chamfered brackets.
526.898	And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
531.266	We call it Charter, on the right.
533.565	So I went to the head of engineering
535.535	with my numbers, and I said proudly,
537.993	"""I have solved your problem."""
540.121	"""Oh,"" he said. ""What problem?"""
543.834	"And I said, ""Well, you know, the problem"
545.48	of the huge data you require
545.48	"for serif fonts and so on."""
548.897	"""Oh,"" he said. ""We solved that problem last week."
552.444	We wrote a compaction routine that reduces
554.6	the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.
557.18	You can have as many fonts on your system
559.168	"as you like."""
560.726	"""Well, thank you for letting me know,"" I said."
563.34	Foiled again.
564.97	I was left with a design solution
567.015	for a nonexistent technical problem.
571.488	But here is where the story sort
571.488	of gets interesting for me.
573.957	I didn't just throw my design away
576.552	in a fit of pique.
577.953	I persevered.
579.69	What had started as a technical exercise
581.858	became an aesthetic exercise, really.
585.122	In other words, I had come to like this typeface.
588.171	Forget its origins. Screw that.
590.49	I liked the design for its own sake.
592.98	The simplified forms of Charter
595.363	gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality
597.446	and unfussy spareness
598.997	that sort of pleased me.
601.487	You know, at times of technical innovation,
604.04	designers want to be influenced
605.56	by what's in the air.
607.296	We want to respond. We want to be pushed
609.527	into exploring something new.
612.938	So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.
615.837	In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link
619.627	between the technology and the design of Charter.
622.82	I had really misunderstood the technology.
626.582	The technology did suggest something to me,
629.91	but it did not force my hand,
632.027	and I think this happens very often.
634.744	You know, engineers are very smart,
637.37	and despite occasional frustrations
638.926	because I'm less smart,
640.453	I've always enjoyed working with them
642.18	and learning from them.
644.258	Apropos, in the mid-'90s,
646.6	I started talking to Microsoft
649.291	about screen fonts.
651.679	Up to that point, all the fonts on screen
654.1	had been adapted from previously existing
656.853	printing fonts, of course.
659.23	But Microsoft foresaw correctly
661.733	the movement, the stampede
663.883	towards electronic communication,
666.67	to reading and writing onscreen
668.7	with the printed output as being sort of secondary
671.833	in importance.
674.056	So the priorities were just tipping at that point.
677.635	They wanted a small core set of fonts
679.829	that were not adapted but designed for the screen
683.134	to face up to the problems of screen,
685.707	which were their coarse resolution displays.
689.549	I said to Microsoft, a typeface designed
693.08	for a particular technology
694.649	is a self-obsoleting typeface.
698.024	I've designed too many faces in the past
700.118	that were intended to mitigate technical problems.
703.697	Thanks to the engineers, the
703.697	technical problems went away.
706.532	So did my typeface.
709.021	It was only a stopgap.
712.152	Microsoft came back to say that
713.693	affordable computer monitors
715.323	with better resolutions
716.52	were at least a decade away.
719.116	So I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,
721.77	that's more than a stopgap.
724.182	So I was persuaded, I was convinced,
726.183	and we went to work on what became Verdana
728.505	and Georgia,
730.177	for the first time working not on paper
732.517	but directly onto the screen from the pixel up.
736.477	At that time, screens were binary.
740.33	The pixel was either on or it was off.
743.37	Here you see the outline of a letter,
746.225	the cap H,
747.692	which is the thin black line, the contour,
750.493	which is how it is stored in memory,
753.369	superimposed on the bitmap,
755.039	which is the grey area,
757.187	which is how it's displayed on the screen.
759.024	The bitmap is rasterized from the outline.
762.17	Here in a cap H, which is all straight lines,
764.411	the two are in almost perfect sync
766.499	on the Cartesian grid.
770.867	Not so with an O.
773.993	This looks more like bricklaying
773.993	than type design,
776.72	but believe me, this is a good bitmap O,
779.621	for the simple reason that it's symmetrical
781.636	in both x and y axes.
784.116	In a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask
786.974	for more than that.
788.694	I would sometimes make, I don't know,
791.098	three or four different versions of a difficult letter
793.454	like a lowercase A,
794.96	and then stand back to choose which was the best.
798.5	Well, there was no best,
800.595	so the designer's judgment comes in
803.02	in trying to decide
804.409	which is the least bad.
807.45	Is that a compromise?
809.9	Not to me, if you are working
811.446	at the highest standard the technology will allow,
814.533	although that standard may be
816.742	well short of the ideal.
819.221	You may be able to see on this slide
820.812	two different bitmap fonts there.
822.974	"The ""a"" in the upper one, I think,"
824.67	"is better than the ""a"" in the lower one,"
826.583	but it still ain't great.
829.159	You can maybe see the effect better
831.066	if it's reduced. Well, maybe not.
834.442	So I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,
836.838	out of necessity.
838.341	For a certain kind of temperament,
840.27	there is a certain kind of satisfaction
841.97	in doing something that cannot be perfect
845.608	but can still be done to the best of your ability.
849.477	Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.
854.334	The bitmap looks jagged and rough.
856.607	It is jagged and rough.
858.466	But I discovered, by experiment,
860.462	that there is an optimum slant
863.679	for an italic on a screen
865.625	so the strokes break well
867.957	at the pixel boundaries.
870.44	Look in this example how, rough as it is,
873.221	how the left and right legs
875.271	actually break at the same level.
877.22	That's a victory. That's good, right there.
880.74	And of course, at the lower depths,
883.918	you don't get much choice.
885.841	This is an S, in case you were wondering.
890.886	Well, it's been 18 years now
893.04	since Verdana and Georgia were released.
895.69	Microsoft were absolutely right,
897.78	it took a good 10 years,
900.194	but screen displays now do have
902.474	improved spatial resolution,
904.927	and very much improved photometric resolution
908.399	thanks to anti-aliasing and so on.
911.553	So now that their mission is accomplished,
915.25	has that meant the demise
916.98	of the screen fonts that I designed
918.86	for coarser displays back then?
921.511	Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens
924.906	and the flood of new web fonts
927.078	coming on to the market?
928.581	Or have they established their own
930.441	sort of evolutionary niche
932.679	that is independent of technology?
936.416	In other words, have they been absorbed
938.087	into the typographic mainstream?
941.4	I'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.
945.058	Hey, 18 is a good age for anything
947.553	with present-day rates of attrition,
949.704	so I'm not complaining.
951.618	Thank you.
954.457	(Applause)
