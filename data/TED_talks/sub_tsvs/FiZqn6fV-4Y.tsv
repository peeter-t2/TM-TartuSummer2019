12.96	What is the intersection
12.96	between technology, art and science?
18.769	Curiosity and wonder,
20.899	because it drives us to explore,
23.646	because we're surrounded
23.646	by things we can't see.
27.11	And I love to use film
27.11	to take us on a journey
30.06	through portals of time and space,
32.94	to make the invisible visible,
35.578	because what that does,
36.964	it expands our horizons,
38.887	it transforms our perception,
41.571	it opens our minds
43.678	and it touches our heart.
45.944	So here are some scenes
45.944	from my 3D IMAX film,
48.767	"""Mysteries of the Unseen World."""
51.353	(Music)
53.799	There is movement which is too slow
53.799	for our eyes to detect,
58.253	and time lapse makes us discover
61.404	and broaden our perspective of life.
63.79	We can see how organisms emerge and grow,
68.042	how a vine survives by creeping
68.042	from the forest floor
71.701	to look at the sunlight.
76.117	And at the grand scale,
77.803	time lapse allows us to see
77.803	our planet in motion.
82.875	We can view not only
82.875	the vast sweep of nature,
85.724	but the restless movement of humanity.
89.346	Each streaking dot
89.346	represents a passenger plane,
92.65	and by turning air traffic data
92.65	into time-lapse imagery,
96.215	we can see something
96.215	that's above us constantly
98.56	but invisible:
100.301	the vast network of air travel
100.301	over the United States.
105.872	We can do the same thing
105.872	with ships at sea.
108.826	We can turn data into a time-lapse view
108.826	of a global economy in motion.
121.676	And decades of data give us
121.676	the view of our entire planet
125.364	as a single organism
127.593	sustained by currents circulating
127.593	throughout the oceans
130.855	and by clouds swirling
130.855	through the atmosphere,
134.976	pulsing with lightning,
136.849	crowned by the aurora Borealis.
139.937	It may be the ultimate time-lapse image:
144.171	the anatomy of Earth brought to life.
151.599	At the other extreme,
153.289	there are things that move
153.289	too fast for our eyes,
156.702	but we have technology
156.702	that can look into that world as well.
163.763	With high-speed cameras,
164.93	we can do the opposite of time lapse.
166.985	We can shoot images
168.33	that are thousands of times
168.33	faster than our vision.
173.001	And we can see how nature's
173.001	ingenious devices work,
176.985	and perhaps we can even imitate them.
182.648	When a dragonfly flutters by,
184.665	you may not realize,
186.724	but it's the greatest flier in nature.
188.947	It can hover, fly backwards,
193.391	even upside down.
196.476	And by tracking markers
196.476	on an insect's wings,
199.577	we can visualize the air flow
199.577	that they produce.
203.326	Nobody knew the secret,
204.691	but high speed shows that a dragonfly
207.324	can move all four wings
207.324	in different directions
209.832	at the same time.
211.68	And what we learn can lead us
211.68	to new kinds of robotic flyers
215.292	that can expand our vision
217.11	of important and remote places.
224.392	We're giants,
225.687	and we're unaware of things
225.687	that are too small for us to see.
228.746	The electron microscope
228.746	fires electrons which creates images
233.369	which can magnify things
233.369	by as much as a million times.
237.416	This is the egg of a butterfly.
241.455	And there are unseen creatures
241.455	living all over your body,
244.544	including mites
244.544	that spend their entire lives
247.259	dwelling on your eyelashes,
249.29	crawling over your skin at night.
252.722	Can you guess what this is?
256.01	Shark skin.
259.96	A caterpillar's mouth.
264.409	The eye of a fruit fly.
269.283	An eggshell.
273.95	A flea.
279.36	A snail's tongue.
284.098	We think we know
284.098	most of the animal kingdom,
286.473	but there may be millions of tiny species
288.992	waiting to be discovered.
294.992	A spider also has great secrets,
297.779	because spiders' silk thread
297.779	is pound for pound stronger than steel
301.517	but completely elastic.
303.744	This journey will take us
303.744	all the way down to the nano world.
307.987	The silk is 100 times thinner
307.987	than human hair.
314.293	On there is bacteria,
317.02	and near that bacteria, 10 times smaller,
320.221	a virus.
323.291	Inside of that, 10 times smaller,
326.647	three strands of DNA.
329.743	And nearing the limit
329.743	of our most powerful microscopes,
333.076	single carbon atoms.
337.787	With the tip of a powerful microscope,
339.935	we can actually move atoms
342.156	and begin to create amazing nano devices.
347.827	Some could one day patrol our body
347.827	for all kinds of diseases
351.92	and clean out clogged arteries
351.92	along the way.
356.1	Tiny chemical machines of the future
359.084	can one day, perhaps, repair DNA.
363.084	We are on the threshold
363.084	of extraordinary advances,
366.151	born of our drive
366.151	to unveil the mysteries of life.
372.554	So under an endless rain of cosmic dust,
375.482	the air is full of pollen,
377.599	micro-diamonds and jewels
379.259	from other planets
379.259	and supernova explosions.
383.573	People go about their lives
383.573	surrounded by the unseeable.
390.59	Knowing that there's so much
390.59	around us we can't see
393.662	forever changes
393.662	our understanding of the world,
396.816	and by looking at unseen worlds,
398.656	we recognize that we exist
398.656	in the living universe,
401.432	and this new perspective creates wonder
404.312	and inspires us to become explorers
406.915	in our own backyards.
410.602	Who knows what awaits to be seen
413.036	and what new wonders
413.036	will transform our lives.
416.727	We'll just have to see.
421.674	(Applause)
426.451	Thank you.
427.649	(Applause)
