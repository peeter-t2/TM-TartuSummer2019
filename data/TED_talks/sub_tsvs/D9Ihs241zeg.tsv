12.16	I'm a storyteller.
14.16	And I would like to tell you
14.16	a few personal stories
17.16	about what I like to call
17.16	"""the danger of the single story."""
22.906	I grew up on a university campus
22.906	in eastern Nigeria.
26.318	My mother says that I started
26.318	reading at the age of two,
29.651	although I think four
29.651	is probably close to the truth.
33.913	So I was an early reader,
35.748	and what I read were British
35.748	and American children's books.
39.866	I was also an early writer,
42.16	and when I began to write,
42.16	at about the age of seven,
46.16	stories in pencil
46.16	with crayon illustrations
48.232	that my poor mother was obligated to read,
51.788	I wrote exactly the kinds
51.788	of stories I was reading:
55.38	All my characters were
55.38	white and blue-eyed,
60.16	they played in the snow,
62.491	they ate apples,
64.602	(Laughter)
66.173	and they talked a lot about the weather,
68.208	how lovely it was
68.208	that the sun had come out.
70.569	(Laughter)
72.557	Now, this despite the fact
72.557	that I lived in Nigeria.
75.715	I had never been outside Nigeria.
79.303	We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,
82.588	and we never talked about the weather,
84.46	because there was no need to.
86.429	My characters also drank
86.429	a lot of ginger beer,
89.16	because the characters
89.16	in the British books I read
91.565	drank ginger beer.
93.461	Never mind that I had no idea
93.461	what ginger beer was.
96.16	(Laughter)
97.715	And for many years afterwards,
99.189	I would have a desperate desire
99.189	to taste ginger beer.
102.636	But that is another story.
104.16	What this demonstrates, I think,
106.667	is how impressionable
106.667	and vulnerable we are
109.545	in the face of a story,
111.16	particularly as children.
113.799	Because all I had read were books
113.799	in which characters were foreign,
117.593	I had become convinced that books
119.736	by their very nature
119.736	had to have foreigners in them
122.93	and had to be about things with which
122.93	I could not personally identify.
127.76	Now, things changed
127.76	when I discovered African books.
131.16	There weren't many of them available,
133.16	and they weren't quite as easy to find
133.16	as the foreign books.
136.053	But because of writers like
136.053	Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,
139.16	I went through a mental shift
139.16	in my perception of literature.
143.16	I realized that people like me,
145.398	girls with skin the color of chocolate,
147.429	whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,
150.715	could also exist in literature.
152.842	I started to write
152.842	about things I recognized.
156.897	Now, I loved those
156.897	American and British books I read.
160.16	They stirred my imagination.
160.16	They opened up new worlds for me.
164.16	But the unintended consequence
166.16	was that I did not know
166.16	that people like me
168.232	could exist in literature.
170.611	So what the discovery of African writers
170.611	did for me was this:
174.16	It saved me from having a single story
174.16	of what books are.
179.16	I come from a conventional,
179.16	middle-class Nigerian family.
182.16	My father was a professor.
184.545	My mother was an administrator.
187.529	And so we had, as was the norm,
190.355	live-in domestic help, who would often
190.355	come from nearby rural villages.
195.342	So, the year I turned eight,
195.342	we got a new house boy.
199.262	His name was Fide.
201.818	The only thing my mother told us about him
201.818	was that his family was very poor.
207.16	My mother sent yams and rice,
207.16	and our old clothes, to his family.
212.16	And when I didn't finish my dinner,
212.16	my mother would say,
214.804	"""Finish your food! Don't you know?"
214.804	"People like Fide's family have nothing."""
219.16	So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
223.736	Then one Saturday,
223.736	we went to his village to visit,
226.657	and his mother showed us
226.657	a beautifully patterned basket
230.16	made of dyed raffia
230.16	that his brother had made.
233.16	I was startled.
235.16	It had not occurred to me
235.16	that anybody in his family
238.16	could actually make something.
241.16	All I had heard about them
241.16	was how poor they were,
244.16	so that it had become impossible for me
244.16	to see them as anything else but poor.
249.303	Their poverty was my single story of them.
253.16	Years later, I thought about this
253.16	when I left Nigeria
255.708	to go to university in the United States.
258.501	I was 19.
260.581	My American roommate was shocked by me.
264.16	She asked where I had learned
264.16	to speak English so well,
267.77	and was confused when I said that Nigeria
269.882	happened to have English
269.882	as its official language.
273.913	She asked if she could listen
273.913	"to what she called my ""tribal music,"""
278.16	and was consequently very disappointed
280.16	when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
282.16	(Laughter)
285.16	She assumed that I did not know
285.16	how to use a stove.
289.942	What struck me was this:
291.222	She had felt sorry for me
291.222	even before she saw me.
294.688	Her default position
294.688	toward me, as an African,
298.16	was a kind of patronizing,
298.16	well-meaning pity.
302.16	My roommate had a single story of Africa:
305.783	a single story of catastrophe.
308.572	In this single story,
309.882	there was no possibility of Africans
309.882	being similar to her in any way,
314.16	no possibility of feelings
314.16	more complex than pity,
317.16	no possibility of a connection
317.16	as human equals.
321.16	I must say that before I went to the U.S.,
323.307	I didn't consciously identify as African.
326.16	But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,
326.16	people turned to me.
329.16	Never mind that I knew nothing
329.16	about places like Namibia.
333.16	But I did come to embrace
333.16	this new identity,
335.28	and in many ways I think
335.28	of myself now as African.
338.16	Although I still get quite irritable
338.16	when Africa is referred to as a country,
342.16	the most recent example being
342.16	my otherwise wonderful flight
346.16	from Lagos two days ago,
347.469	in which there was an announcement
347.469	on the Virgin flight
350.375	"about the charity work in ""India,"
350.375	"Africa and other countries."""
355.16	(Laughter)
356.636	So, after I had spent some years
356.636	in the U.S. as an African,
360.16	I began to understand
360.16	my roommate's response to me.
364.16	If I had not grown up in Nigeria,
366.209	and if all I knew about Africa
366.209	were from popular images,
369.374	I too would think that Africa
369.374	was a place of beautiful landscapes,
374.57	beautiful animals,
376.16	and incomprehensible people,
378.16	fighting senseless wars,
378.16	dying of poverty and AIDS,
381.815	unable to speak for themselves
384.16	and waiting to be saved
384.16	by a kind, white foreigner.
389.088	I would see Africans
389.088	in the same way that I,
391.281	as a child, had seen Fide's family.
395.16	This single story of Africa ultimately
395.16	comes, I think, from Western literature.
399.16	Now, here is a quote from the writing
399.16	of a London merchant called John Lok,
404.16	who sailed to west Africa in 1561
407.16	and kept a fascinating
407.16	account of his voyage.
412.363	After referring to the black Africans
412.363	"as ""beasts who have no houses,"""
416.16	"he writes, ""They are also"
416.16	people without heads,
420.16	having their mouth and eyes
420.16	"in their breasts."""
425.16	Now, I've laughed
425.16	every time I've read this.
427.28	And one must admire
427.28	the imagination of John Lok.
431.533	But what is important about his writing
433.423	is that it represents the beginning
435.16	of a tradition of telling
435.16	African stories in the West:
438.16	A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa
438.16	as a place of negatives,
441.639	of difference, of darkness,
443.818	of people who, in the words
443.818	of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,
449.16	"are ""half devil, half child."""
452.371	And so, I began to realize
452.371	that my American roommate
455.16	must have throughout her life
457.16	seen and heard different versions
457.16	of this single story,
461.16	as had a professor,
463.16	who once told me that my novel
463.16	"was not ""authentically African."""
468.029	Now, I was quite willing to contend
469.744	that there were a number of things
469.744	wrong with the novel,
472.863	that it had failed in a number of places,
476.16	but I had not quite imagined
476.16	that it had failed
478.423	at achieving something
478.423	called African authenticity.
481.16	In fact, I did not know
481.16	what African authenticity was.
486.16	The professor told me that my characters
486.16	were too much like him,
490.58	an educated and middle-class man.
492.58	My characters drove cars.
494.706	They were not starving.
497.16	Therefore they were not
497.16	authentically African.
501.16	But I must quickly add
501.16	that I too am just as guilty
504.16	in the question of the single story.
507.16	A few years ago,
507.16	I visited Mexico from the U.S.
511.16	The political climate in the U.S.
511.16	at the time was tense,
513.851	and there were debates going on
513.851	about immigration.
517.16	And, as often happens in America,
519.16	immigration became
519.16	synonymous with Mexicans.
522.858	There were endless stories of Mexicans
524.815	as people who were
524.815	fleecing the healthcare system,
528.16	sneaking across the border,
530.16	being arrested at the border,
530.16	that sort of thing.
534.323	I remember walking around
534.323	on my first day in Guadalajara,
538.16	watching the people going to work,
540.16	rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
542.16	smoking, laughing.
545.355	I remember first feeling slight surprise.
548.16	And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
551.501	I realized that I had been so immersed
551.501	in the media coverage of Mexicans
556.16	that they had become one thing in my mind,
558.184	the abject immigrant.
560.929	I had bought into
560.929	the single story of Mexicans
563.375	and I could not have
563.375	been more ashamed of myself.
566.231	So that is how to create a single story,
568.802	show a people as one thing,
571.16	as only one thing,
573.16	over and over again,
575.16	and that is what they become.
577.953	It is impossible to talk
577.953	about the single story
580.423	without talking about power.
583.656	There is a word, an Igbo word,
585.428	that I think about whenever I think about
585.428	the power structures of the world,
589.103	"and it is ""nkali."""
590.492	It's a noun that loosely translates
590.492	"to ""to be greater than another."""
595.714	Like our economic and political worlds,
598.666	stories too are defined
598.666	by the principle of nkali:
603.16	How they are told, who tells them,
605.16	when they're told,
605.16	how many stories are told,
608.421	are really dependent on power.
612.16	Power is the ability not just to tell
612.16	the story of another person,
615.327	but to make it the definitive
615.327	story of that person.
619.16	The Palestinian poet
619.16	Mourid Barghouti writes
621.28	that if you want to dispossess a people,
624.16	the simplest way to do it
624.16	is to tell their story
627.16	"and to start with, ""secondly."""
630.644	Start the story with the arrows
630.644	of the Native Americans,
634.566	and not with the arrival of the British,
637.16	and you have an entirely different story.
640.161	Start the story with
640.161	the failure of the African state,
644.617	and not with the colonial
644.617	creation of the African state,
648.16	and you have an entirely different story.
652.16	I recently spoke at a university
654.16	where a student told me
654.16	that it was such a shame
657.969	that Nigerian men were physical abusers
661.112	like the father character in my novel.
664.16	I told him that I had just read a novel
664.16	"called ""American Psycho"" --"
668.16	(Laughter)
670.16	-- and that it was such a shame
672.16	that young Americans
672.16	were serial murderers.
675.16	(Laughter)
679.16	(Applause)
685.16	Now, obviously I said this
685.16	in a fit of mild irritation.
688.16	(Laughter)
690.16	But it would never have
690.16	occurred to me to think
692.375	that just because I had read a novel
692.375	in which a character was a serial killer
696.16	that he was somehow
696.16	representative of all Americans.
700.16	This is not because I am
700.16	a better person than that student,
703.16	but because of America's cultural
703.16	and economic power,
706.16	I had many stories of America.
708.16	I had read Tyler and Updike
708.16	and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
712.16	I did not have a single story of America.
715.831	When I learned, some years ago,
717.561	that writers were expected
717.561	to have had really unhappy childhoods
721.926	to be successful,
724.16	I began to think about how I could invent
724.16	horrible things my parents had done to me.
728.184	(Laughter)
730.16	But the truth is that I had
730.16	a very happy childhood,
734.16	full of laughter and love,
734.16	in a very close-knit family.
737.16	But I also had grandfathers
737.16	who died in refugee camps.
740.91	My cousin Polle died because
740.91	he could not get adequate healthcare.
745.16	One of my closest friends,
745.16	Okoloma, died in a plane crash
748.16	because our fire trucks
748.16	did not have water.
751.16	I grew up under repressive
751.16	military governments
754.16	that devalued education,
756.16	so that sometimes, my parents
756.16	were not paid their salaries.
759.16	And so, as a child, I saw jam
759.16	disappear from the breakfast table,
763.161	then margarine disappeared,
765.682	then bread became too expensive,
768.16	then milk became rationed.
771.16	And most of all, a kind
771.16	of normalized political fear
774.841	invaded our lives.
777.983	All of these stories make me who I am.
780.617	But to insist on only
780.617	these negative stories
784.16	is to flatten my experience
787.16	and to overlook the many other
787.16	stories that formed me.
791.554	The single story creates stereotypes,
794.16	and the problem with stereotypes
794.16	is not that they are untrue,
799.16	but that they are incomplete.
801.517	They make one story become the only story.
805.16	Of course, Africa is a continent
805.16	full of catastrophes:
807.756	There are immense ones,
807.756	such as the horrific rapes in Congo
811.16	and depressing ones,
812.81	such as the fact that 5,000 people apply
812.81	for one job vacancy in Nigeria.
818.16	But there are other stories
818.16	that are not about catastrophe,
821.747	and it is very important, it is just
821.747	as important, to talk about them.
825.16	I've always felt that it is impossible
827.16	to engage properly
827.16	with a place or a person
830.16	without engaging with all of the stories
830.16	of that place and that person.
834.16	The consequence
834.16	of the single story is this:
837.764	It robs people of dignity.
840.492	It makes our recognition
840.492	of our equal humanity difficult.
844.16	It emphasizes how we are different
844.16	rather than how we are similar.
849.16	So what if before my Mexican trip,
851.673	I had followed the immigration
851.673	debate from both sides,
855.16	the U.S. and the Mexican?
857.16	What if my mother had told us
857.16	that Fide's family was poor
861.16	and hardworking?
863.16	What if we had an African
863.16	television network
865.28	that broadcast diverse
865.28	African stories all over the world?
869.16	What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe
869.16	"calls ""a balance of stories."""
873.515	What if my roommate knew
873.515	about my Nigerian publisher,
877.515	Muhtar Bakare,
879.16	a remarkable man who left
879.16	his job in a bank
881.232	to follow his dream
881.232	and start a publishing house?
884.161	Now, the conventional wisdom
884.161	was that Nigerians don't read literature.
887.872	He disagreed.
889.15	He felt that people
889.15	who could read, would read,
892.26	if you made literature affordable
892.26	and available to them.
896.826	Shortly after he published my first novel,
899.16	I went to a TV station
899.16	in Lagos to do an interview,
902.16	and a woman who worked there
902.16	as a messenger came up to me and said,
905.375	"""I really liked your novel."
905.375	I didn't like the ending.
908.16	Now, you must write a sequel,
908.16	"and this is what will happen ..."""
911.423	(Laughter)
914.161	And she went on to tell me
914.161	what to write in the sequel.
917.724	I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
920.16	Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
920.16	masses of Nigerians,
923.16	who were not supposed to be readers.
926.061	She had not only read the book,
927.709	but she had taken ownership of it
929.542	and felt justified in telling me
929.542	what to write in the sequel.
933.74	Now, what if my roommate knew
933.74	about my friend Funmi Iyanda,
937.16	a fearless woman who hosts
937.16	a TV show in Lagos,
940.16	and is determined to tell the stories
940.16	that we prefer to forget?
943.855	What if my roommate knew
943.855	about the heart procedure
947.16	that was performed in the Lagos
947.16	hospital last week?
950.16	What if my roommate knew
950.16	about contemporary Nigerian music,
954.16	talented people singing
954.16	in English and Pidgin,
957.16	and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,
959.16	mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela
963.16	to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.
966.16	What if my roommate knew
966.16	about the female lawyer
968.423	who recently went to court in Nigeria
968.423	to challenge a ridiculous law
972.16	that required women to get
972.16	their husband's consent
975.16	before renewing their passports?
978.16	What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,
981.16	full of innovative people making
981.16	films despite great technical odds,
985.564	films so popular
987.16	that they really are the best example
987.16	of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
992.16	What if my roommate knew about
992.16	my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,
995.47	who has just started her own business
995.47	selling hair extensions?
999.16	Or about the millions of other Nigerians
999.16	who start businesses and sometimes fail,
1003.16	but continue to nurse ambition?
1007.16	Every time I am home I am confronted
1009.16	with the usual sources of irritation
1009.16	for most Nigerians:
1012.16	our failed infrastructure,
1012.16	our failed government,
1015.628	but also by the incredible resilience
1017.707	of people who thrive
1017.707	despite the government,
1021.16	rather than because of it.
1023.533	I teach writing workshops
1023.533	in Lagos every summer,
1026.16	and it is amazing to me
1026.16	how many people apply,
1029.16	how many people are eager to write,
1032.16	to tell stories.
1034.435	My Nigerian publisher and I
1034.435	have just started a non-profit
1037.482	called Farafina Trust,
1039.16	and we have big dreams
1039.16	of building libraries
1042.16	and refurbishing libraries
1042.16	that already exist
1044.327	and providing books for state schools
1047.16	that don't have anything
1047.16	in their libraries,
1049.28	and also of organizing lots
1049.28	and lots of workshops,
1051.685	in reading and writing,
1053.16	for all the people who are eager
1053.16	to tell our many stories.
1056.486	Stories matter.
1058.16	Many stories matter.
1060.16	Stories have been used
1060.16	to dispossess and to malign,
1064.16	but stories can also be used
1064.16	to empower and to humanize.
1068.802	Stories can break the dignity of a people,
1071.16	but stories can also repair
1071.16	that broken dignity.
1076.16	The American writer
1076.16	Alice Walker wrote this
1078.232	about her Southern relatives
1078.232	who had moved to the North.
1082.16	She introduced them to a book about
1084.16	the Southern life
1084.16	that they had left behind.
1087.752	"""They sat around,"
1087.752	reading the book themselves,
1091.16	listening to me read the book,
1091.16	"and a kind of paradise was regained."""
1097.739	I would like to end with this thought:
1100.625	That when we reject the single story,
1103.16	when we realize that
1103.16	there is never a single story
1106.16	about any place,
1108.625	we regain a kind of paradise.
1110.855	Thank you.
1112.001	(Applause)
