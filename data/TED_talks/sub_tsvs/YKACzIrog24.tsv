12.58	Most of us go through life trying
12.58	to do our best at whatever we do,
16.62	whether it's our job, family, school
19.22	or anything else.
21.06	I feel that way. I try my best.
23.74	But some time ago, I came to a realization
26.66	that I wasn't getting much better
26.66	at the things I cared most about,
30.46	whether it was being a husband or a friend
33.66	or a professional or teammate,
35.9	and I wasn't improving
35.9	much at those things
37.94	even though I was spending a lot of time
40.5	working hard at them.
43.02	I've since realized from conversations
43.02	I've had and from research
46.42	that this stagnation, despite hard work,
49.1	turns out to be pretty common.
50.86	So I'd like to share with you
50.86	some insights into why that is
53.74	and what we can all do about it.
55.98	What I've learned
55.98	is that the most effective people
58.5	and teams in any domain
60.5	do something we can all emulate.
62.82	They go through life deliberately
62.82	alternating between two zones:
66.9	the learning zone
66.9	and the performance zone.
69.98	The learning zone
69.98	is when our goal is to improve.
72.66	Then we do activities
72.66	designed for improvement,
75.78	concentrating on what
75.78	we haven't mastered yet,
78.26	which means we have to expect
78.26	to make mistakes,
80.74	knowing that we will learn from them.
82.98	That is very different from what we do
82.98	when we're in our performance zone,
86.74	which is when our goal is to do something
86.74	as best as we can, to execute.
91.06	Then we concentrate
91.06	on what we have already mastered
93.7	and we try to minimize mistakes.
96.66	Both of these zones
96.66	should be part of our lives,
99.1	but being clear about
99.1	when we want to be in each of them,
102.38	with what goal, focus and expectations,
104.7	helps us better perform
104.7	and better improve.
107.54	The performance zone maximizes
107.54	our immediate performance,
110.5	while the learning zone
110.5	maximizes our growth
112.62	and our future performance.
115.14	The reason many of us don't improve much
117.22	despite our hard work
118.98	is that we tend to spend almost
118.98	all of our time in the performance zone.
123.7	This hinders our growth,
125.1	and ironically, over the long term,
125.1	also our performance.
129.86	So what does the learning zone look like?
132.58	Take Demosthenes, a political leader
134.62	and the greatest orator
134.62	and lawyer in ancient Greece.
138.06	To become great,
138.06	he didn't spend all his time
141.739	just being an orator or a lawyer,
144.18	which would be his performance zone.
146.38	But instead, he did activities
146.38	designed for improvement.
149.42	Of course, he studied a lot.
150.82	He studied law and philosophy
150.82	with guidance from mentors,
153.66	but he also realized that being a lawyer
153.66	involved persuading other people,
158.22	so he also studied great speeches
160.62	and acting.
162.46	To get rid of an odd habit he had
162.46	of involuntarily lifting his shoulder,
166.78	he practiced his speeches
166.78	in front of a mirror,
169.22	and he suspended a sword from the ceiling
172.22	so that if he raised his shoulder,
173.98	it would hurt.
175.22	(Laughter)
176.86	To speak more clearly despite a lisp,
179.02	he went through his speeches
179.02	with stones in his mouth.
182.66	He built an underground room
184.06	where he could practice
184.06	without interruptions
186.22	and not disturb other people.
187.66	And since courts at the time
187.66	were very noisy,
189.82	he also practiced by the ocean,
191.7	projecting his voice
191.7	above the roar of the waves.
195.22	His activities in the learning zone
196.94	were very different
196.94	from his activities in court,
199.46	his performance zone.
201.58	In the learning zone,
202.82	he did what Dr. Anders Ericsson
202.82	calls deliberate practice.
205.62	This involves breaking down
205.62	abilities into component skills,
209.18	being clear about what subskill
209.18	we're working to improve,
212.1	like keeping our shoulders down,
214.1	giving full concentration
214.1	to a high level of challenge
216.98	outside our comfort zone,
218.42	just beyond what we can currently do,
220.78	using frequent feedback
220.78	with repetition and adjustments,
224.02	and ideally engaging the guidance
224.02	of a skilled coach,
227.02	because activities
227.02	designed for improvement
229.1	are domain-specific,
230.38	and great teachers and coaches
230.38	know what those activities are
233.3	and can also give us expert feedback.
235.78	It is this type of practice
235.78	in the learning zone
238.5	which leads to substantial improvement,
240.42	not just time on task performing.
243.78	For example, research shows
243.78	that after the first couple of years
246.98	working in a profession,
248.26	performance usually plateaus.
250.62	This has been shown to be true
250.62	in teaching, general medicine,
253.7	nursing and other fields,
255.42	and it happens because once we think
255.42	we have become good enough,
259.18	adequate,
260.42	then we stop spending time
260.42	in the learning zone.
262.7	We focus all our time
262.7	on just doing our job,
264.9	performing,
266.14	which turns out not to be
266.14	a great way to improve.
268.98	But the people who continue
268.98	to spend time in the learning zone
271.94	do continue to always improve.
274.1	The best salespeople at least once a week
276.54	do activities with
276.54	the goal of improvement.
279.18	They read to extend their knowledge,
280.98	consult with colleagues or domain experts,
283.42	try out new strategies,
283.42	solicit feedback and reflect.
287.18	The best chess players
288.82	spend a lot of time
288.82	not playing games of chess,
292.38	which would be their performance zone,
294.34	but trying to predict the moves
294.34	grand masters made and analyzing them.
298.74	Each of us has probably spent
298.74	many, many, many hours
302.86	typing on a computer
304.42	without getting faster,
306.02	but if we spent 10 to 20 minutes each day
309.46	fully concentrating
309.46	on typing 10 to 20 percent faster
312.66	than our current reliable speed,
314.26	we would get faster,
315.54	especially if we also identified
315.54	what mistakes we're making
318.58	and practiced typing those words.
321.22	That's deliberate practice.
324.1	In what other parts of our lives,
325.86	perhaps that we care more about,
327.58	are we working hard but not improving much
330.14	because we're always
330.14	in the performance zone?
334.38	Now, this is not to say
334.38	that the performance zone has no value.
337.38	It very much does.
338.62	When I needed a knee surgery,
338.62	I didn't tell the surgeon,
341.3	"""Poke around in there"
341.3	"and focus on what you don't know."""
343.98	(Laughter)
345.02	"""We'll learn from your mistakes!"""
347.5	I looked for a surgeon
347.5	who I felt would do a good job,
350.78	and I wanted her to do a good job.
352.98	Being in the performance zone
354.42	allows us to get things done
354.42	as best as we can.
357.62	It can also be motivating,
359.02	and it provides us with information
359.02	to identify what to focus on next
362.62	when we go back to the learning zone.
364.94	So the way to high performance
366.66	is to alternate between the learning zone
366.66	and the performance zone,
370.38	purposefully building our skills
370.38	in the learning zone,
372.94	then applying those skills
372.94	in the performance zone.
376.38	When Beyonc√© is on tour,
378.42	during the concert,
378.42	she's in her performance zone,
381.62	but every night when she
381.62	gets back to the hotel room,
384.14	she goes right back
384.14	into her learning zone.
386.38	She watches a video
386.38	of the show that just ended.
389.18	She identifies opportunities
389.18	for improvement,
391.34	for herself, her dancers
391.34	and her camera staff.
393.98	And the next morning,
395.26	everyone receives pages of notes
395.26	with what to adjust,
398.34	which they then work on during the day
398.34	before the next performance.
402.34	It's a spiral
403.58	to ever-increasing capabilities,
405.18	but we need to know when we seek to learn,
405.18	and when we seek to perform,
408.82	and while we want
408.82	to spend time doing both,
410.9	the more time we spend
410.9	in the learning zone,
413.02	the more we'll improve.
415.18	So how can we spend
415.18	more time in the learning zone?
418.86	First, we must believe and understand
422.06	that we can improve,
423.42	what we call a growth mindset.
425.66	Second, we must want
425.66	to improve at that particular skill.
428.94	There has to be a purpose we care about,
430.9	because it takes time and effort.
433.18	Third, we must have an idea
433.18	about how to improve,
436.22	what we can do to improve,
437.94	not how I used to practice
437.94	the guitar as a teenager,
440.54	performing songs over and over again,
442.66	but doing deliberate practice.
444.78	And fourth, we must be
444.78	in a low-stakes situation,
448.98	because if mistakes are to be expected,
451.22	then the consequence of making them
451.22	must not be catastrophic,
454.26	or even very significant.
456.06	A tightrope walker doesn't practice
456.06	new tricks without a net underneath,
459.78	and an athlete wouldn't set out
459.78	to first try a new move
462.42	during a championship match.
464.94	One reason that in our lives
466.62	we spend so much time
466.62	in the performance zone
469.1	is that our environments
469.1	often are, unnecessarily, high stakes.
474.02	We create social risks for one another,
476.26	even in schools which are supposed
476.26	to be all about learning,
479.14	and I'm not talking
479.14	about standardized tests.
481.3	I mean that every minute of every day,
483.54	many students in elementary
483.54	schools through colleges
486.26	feel that if they make a mistake,
486.26	others will think less of them.
489.7	No wonder they're always stressed out
491.66	and not taking the risks
491.66	necessary for learning.
494.58	But they learn
494.58	that mistakes are undesirable
496.86	inadvertently
498.14	when teachers or parents
498.14	are eager to hear just correct answers
501.66	and reject mistakes
501.66	rather than welcome and examine them
504.34	to learn from them,
505.62	or when we look for narrow responses
507.38	rather than encourage
507.38	more exploratory thinking
509.62	that we can all learn from.
510.98	When all homework or student work
510.98	has a number or a letter on it,
514.1	and counts towards a final grade,
515.86	rather than being used for practice,
515.86	mistakes, feedback and revision,
519.46	we send the message
519.46	that school is a performance zone.
524.06	The same is true in our workplaces.
526.14	In the companies I consult with,
526.14	I often see flawless execution cultures
530.18	which leaders foster
530.18	to encourage great work.
532.78	But that leads employees
532.78	to stay within what they know
535.34	and not try new things,
536.62	so companies struggle
536.62	to innovate and improve,
538.98	and they fall behind.
541.78	We can create more spaces for growth
544.1	by starting conversations with one another
546.18	about when we want to be in each zone.
549.06	What do we want to get better at and how?
551.78	And when do we want
551.78	to execute and minimize mistakes?
555.5	That way, we gain clarity
555.5	about what success is,
558.54	when, and how to best support one another.
561.82	But what if we find ourselves
561.82	in a chronic high-stakes setting
564.94	and we feel we can't
564.94	start those conversations yet?
568.54	Then here are three things
568.54	that we can still do as individuals.
571.66	First, we can create low-stakes islands
571.66	in an otherwise high-stakes sea.
576.46	These are spaces where mistakes
576.46	have little consequence.
579.22	For example, we might find
579.22	a mentor or a trusted colleague
582.7	with whom we can exchange ideas
582.7	or have vulnerable conversations
585.9	or even role-play.
587.3	Or we can ask for feedback-oriented
587.3	meetings as projects progress.
590.94	Or we can set aside time to read
590.94	or watch videos or take online courses.
595.1	Those are just some examples.
597.18	Second, we can execute
597.18	and perform as we're expected,
601.38	but then reflect on what
601.38	we could do better next time,
603.98	like Beyonc√© does,
605.26	and we can observe and emulate experts.
607.42	The observation, reflection
607.42	and adjustment is a learning zone.
611.7	And finally, we can lead
614.58	and lower the stakes for others
614.58	by sharing what we want to get better at,
618.18	by asking questions
618.18	about what we don't know,
620.7	by soliciting feedback
620.7	and by sharing our mistakes
623.22	and what we've learned from them,
624.86	so that others
624.86	can feel safe to do the same.
627.58	Real confidence is about
627.58	modeling ongoing learning.
632.7	What if, instead of spending
632.7	our lives doing, doing, doing,
637.18	performing, performing, performing,
639.3	we spent more time exploring,
642.46	asking,
643.9	listening,
645.22	experimenting, reflecting,
648.34	striving and becoming?
652.14	What if we each always had something
654.98	we were working to improve?
657.58	What if we created more low-stakes islands
660.02	and waters?
661.66	And what if we got clear,
664.14	within ourselves and with our teammates,
666.54	about when we seek to learn
666.54	and when we seek to perform,
670.1	so that our efforts
670.1	can become more consequential,
673.18	our improvement never-ending
675.86	and our best even better?
678.82	Thank you.
