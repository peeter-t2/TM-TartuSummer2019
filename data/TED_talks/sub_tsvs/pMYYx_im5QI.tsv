12.691	I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,
15.849	"so if I say ""killer robots,"""
18.042	you'd probably think something like this.
20.403	But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.
22.958	I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,
25.906	autonomous combat drones.
29.028	Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,
32.655	which have a human making targeting decisions.
35.915	I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons
39.044	that make lethal decisions about human beings
41.698	all on their own.
44.115	There's actually a technical term for this: lethal autonomy.
48.115	Now, lethally autonomous killer robots
50.971	would take many forms -- flying, driving,
54.04	or just lying in wait.
56.786	And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.
59.895	These are two automatic sniper stations
62.379	currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.
66.516	Both of these machines are capable of automatically
68.687	identifying a human target and firing on it,
72.211	the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.
76.535	Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop
80.124	to make that lethal firing decision,
82.496	but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.
87.909	And it's that choice that I want to focus on,
91.002	because as we migrate lethal decision-making
93.643	from humans to software,
96.752	we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,
100.228	but also changing our social landscape entirely,
103.754	far from the battlefield.
105.978	That's because the way humans resolve conflict
110.487	shapes our social landscape.
112.22	And this has always been the case, throughout history.
114.853	For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems
117.514	in 1400 A.D.
119.593	Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,
122.737	but with these you could dominate the populace,
125.977	and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.
129.866	Power was focused at the very top.
132.553	And what changed? Technological innovation.
136.081	Gunpowder, cannon.
137.952	And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,
141.769	and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield
144.302	versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.
148.081	And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose
151.719	as a political and logistical requirement of defense.
155.399	And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,
157.775	they began to share power.
159.608	Representative government began to form.
162.207	So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict
165.495	shape our social landscape.
168.799	Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,
172.863	except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,
178.031	they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,
182.871	possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.
189.386	Now, I think, knowing this,
191.143	we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,
195.495	to do what humans do best, which is adapt.
199.474	But time is a factor.
201.479	Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted
204.33	combat drones of their own,
206.487	and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones
209.08	are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.
213.552	That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,
216.319	there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making
219.703	away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.
224.303	The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.
229.562	For example, in 2004, the U.S. drone fleet produced
233.415	a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.
238.727	By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours,
243.226	outstripping human ability to review it all,
246.375	but even that number is about to go up drastically.
250.039	The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs
252.614	will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes
255.778	on each drone platform,
257.816	and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.
261.119	And that means visual intelligence software will need
263.279	to scan it for items of interest.
267.327	And that means very soon
268.675	drones will tell humans what to look at,
271.422	not the other way around.
273.919	But there's a second powerful incentive pushing
276.392	decision-making away from humans and onto machines,
279.775	and that's electromagnetic jamming,
282.647	severing the connection between the drone
284.883	and its operator.
287.697	Now we saw an example of this in 2011
290.315	when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone
293.271	got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,
297.578	but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,
302.692	and that means drones
304.744	will have to shoulder more decision-making.
308.364	They'll know their mission objective,
311.407	and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.
316.252	They'll ignore external radio signals
318.833	and send very few of their own.
321.163	Which brings us to, really, the third
323.169	and most powerful incentive pushing decision-making
327.031	away from humans and onto weapons:
330.373	plausible deniability.
333.666	Now we live in a global economy.
336.553	High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.
340.887	Cyber espionage is spiriting away advanced designs
343.801	to parts unknown,
345.687	and in that environment, it is very likely
347.701	that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories,
352.435	proliferate in the gray market.
354.605	And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage
357.065	of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say
360.025	who sent that weapon.
364.425	This raises the very real possibility
367.225	of anonymous war.
370.16	This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head,
372.774	make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower
376.265	against an attacker, and that could shift the balance
379.113	in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.
382.877	It could make military action a viable option
386.001	not just for small nations,
388.289	but criminal organizations, private enterprise,
390.834	even powerful individuals.
393.313	It could create a landscape of rival warlords
396.641	undermining rule of law and civil society.
400.321	Now if responsibility and transparency
403.937	are two of the cornerstones of representative government,
406.321	autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.
410.641	Now you might be thinking that
412.187	citizens of high-tech nations
414.433	would have the advantage in any robotic war,
417.136	that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable,
420.769	particularly against developing nations.
425.057	But I think the truth is the exact opposite.
428.581	I think citizens of high-tech societies
430.832	are more vulnerable to robotic weapons,
434.561	and the reason can be summed up in one word: data.
439.026	Data powers high-tech societies.
442.507	Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata,
445.697	social media, email, text, financial transaction data,
449.169	transportation data, it's a wealth of real-time data
452.701	on the movements and social interactions of people.
456.074	In short, we are more visible to machines
459.849	than any people in history,
462.091	and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.
467.707	What you're looking at here
469.445	is a link analysis map of a social group.
472.691	Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.
476.325	And these types of maps can be automatically generated
479.205	based on the data trail modern people leave behind.
483.92	Now it's typically used to market goods and services
486.397	to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,
490.813	because targeting is used in another context.
494.173	Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.
496.733	These are the hubs of social networks.
500.013	These are organizers, opinion-makers, leaders,
503.603	and these people also can be automatically identified
506.285	from their communication patterns.
508.667	Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them
510.813	with product samples, try to spread your brand
513.356	through their social group.
516.185	But if you're a repressive government
518.138	searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,
522.948	eliminate them, disrupt their social group,
525.708	and those who remain behind lose social cohesion
528.877	and organization.
531.498	Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,
534.822	borders would offer very little protection
537.457	to critics of distant governments
539.403	or trans-national criminal organizations.
543.049	Popular movements agitating for change
546.542	could be detected early and their leaders eliminated
550.151	before their ideas achieve critical mass.
553.062	And ideas achieving critical mass
555.653	is what political activism in popular government is all about.
559.589	Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action
563.586	an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.
567.368	And this would put a chill on free speech
571.102	and popular political action, the very heart of democracy.
576.41	And this is why we need an international treaty
579.324	on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban
582.864	on the development and deployment of killer robots.
586.772	Now we already have international treaties
590.026	on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,
593.412	these have largely worked.
595.7	But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,
599.468	because they will almost certainly be used,
602.756	and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.
607.783	Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense
611.251	issued a directive requiring
613.709	a human being be present in all lethal decisions.
618.228	This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military,
623.004	but that directive needs to be made permanent.
626.757	And it could set the stage for global action.
631.133	Because we need an international legal framework
634.978	for robotic weapons.
637.116	And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack
640.044	or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world
643.196	to rush to adopt these weapons
645.12	before thinking through the consequences.
648.891	Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power
651.872	in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.
658.155	Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons
660.841	of great uses for unarmed civilian drones:
663.459	environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.
667.398	If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,
670.224	how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones
673.811	and vehicles while still protecting ourselves
676.459	against illegal robotic weapons?
680.439	I think the secret will be transparency.
685.18	No robot should have an expectation of privacy
688.193	in a public place.
691.644	(Applause)
696.692	Each robot and drone should have
698.737	a cryptographically signed I.D. burned in at the factory
701.62	that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.
704.543	We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.
707.924	This is no different.
709.765	And every citizen should be able to download an app
711.777	that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles
714.902	moving through public spaces around them,
717.331	both right now and historically.
720.064	And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones
723.612	to detect rogue drones,
725.956	and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,
729.132	they should notify humans to their presence.
732.124	And in certain very high-security areas,
734.73	perhaps civic drones would snare them
736.639	and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.
739.48	But notice, this is more an immune system
742.507	than a weapons system.
743.828	It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use
746.42	of autonomous vehicles and drones
748.452	while still preserving our open, civil society.
752.747	We must ban the deployment and development
755.746	of killer robots.
757.608	Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.
762.458	Autocratic governments and criminal organizations
765.176	undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.
768.132	Autonomous robotic weapons
770.023	would concentrate too much power
772.074	in too few unseen hands,
774.556	and that would be corrosive to representative government.
777.811	Let's make sure, for democracies at least,
780.772	killer robots remain fiction.
783.376	Thank you.
784.486	(Applause)
789.051	Thank you. (Applause)
