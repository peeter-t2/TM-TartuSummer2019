12.713	That's how we traveled in the year 1900.
15.422	That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.
17.791	It doesn't have air conditioning.
19.42	That horse is pulling it along
21.477	at one percent of the speed of sound,
23.775	and the rutted dirt road
25.527	turns into a quagmire of mud anytime it rains.
29.909	That's a Boeing 707.
32.654	Only 60 years later, it travels
34.955	at 80 percent of the speed of sound,
37.172	and we don't travel any faster today
39.805	because commercial supersonic air travel
42.944	turned out to be a bust.
44.913	So I started wondering and pondering,
47.465	could it be that the best years of American economic growth
50.487	are behind us?
52.146	And that leads to the suggestion, maybe economic growth
56.625	is almost over.
58.852	Some of the reasons for this are not really very controversial.
62.614	There are four headwinds that are just hitting
64.988	the American economy in the face.
67.373	They're demographics, education, debt and inequality.
72.031	They're powerful enough to cut growth in half.
75.664	So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline.
80.322	And here's my theme: Because of the headwinds,
83.09	if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been
85.771	in the last 150 years, growth is cut in half.
89.638	If innovation is less powerful,
92.349	invents less great, wonderful things,
94.803	then growth is going to be even lower than half of history.
98.813	Now here's eight centuries of economic growth.
101.968	The vertical axis is just percent per year of growth,
105.632	zero percent a year, one percent a year, two percent a year.
108.755	The white line is for the U.K., and then the U.S.
111.655	takes over as the leading nation in the year 1900,
114.186	when the line switches to red.
115.677	You'll notice that, for the first four centuries,
117.663	there's hardly any growth at all, just 0.2 percent.
121.533	Then growth gets better and better.
123.152	It maxes out in the 1930s, '40s and '50s,
126.13	and then it starts slowing down, and here's a cautionary note.
129.887	That last downward notch in the red line
132.383	is not actual data.
134.614	That is a forecast that I made six years ago
137.754	that growth would slow down to 1.3 percent.
140.383	But you know what the actual facts are?
142.393	You know what the growth in per-person income has been
144.206	in the United States in the last six years?
147.098	Negative.
149.438	This led to a fantasy.
151.709	What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?
156.955	I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted,
160.923	but I decided I would end it at 0.2,
163.717	just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.
168.542	Now the history that we've achieved is that we've grown
171.906	at 2.0 percent per year over the whole period,
179.155	and remember it's been a little bit negative since 2007.
182.779	But if growth slows down,
185.084	instead of doubling our standard of living every generation,
189.067	Americans in the future can't expect to be twice as well off as their parents,
193.905	or even a quarter [more well off than] their parents.
196.875	Now we're going to change and look at the level of per capita income.
201.24	The vertical axis now is thousands of dollars in today's prices.
204.604	You'll notice that in 1891, over on the left,
207.18	we were at about 5,000 dollars.
208.91	Today we're at about 44,000 dollars of total output
211.815	per member of the population.
214.482	Now what if we could achieve that historic
216.9	two-percent growth for the next 70 years?
219.883	Well, it's a matter of arithmetic.
221.215	Two-percent growth quadruples your standard of living in 70 years.
225.355	That means we'd go from 44,000 to 180,000.
229.056	Well, we're not going to do that,
231.507	and the reason is the headwinds.
233.333	The first headwind is demographics.
234.974	It's a truism that your standard of living
237.312	rises faster than productivity, rises faster than output per hour,
240.824	if hours per person increased.
243.434	And we got that gift back in the '70s and '80s
245.936	when women entered the labor force.
248.454	But now it's turned around.
250.691	Now hours per person are shrinking,
252.891	first because of the retirement of the baby boomers,
255.765	and second because there's been a very significant
259.919	dropping out of the labor force of prime age adult males
263.916	who are in the bottom half of the educational distribution.
267.854	The next headwind is education.
270.015	We've got problems all over our educational system
272.66	despite Race to the Top.
274.181	In college, we've got cost inflation in higher education
278.263	that dwarfs cost inflation in medical care.
281.175	We have in higher education a trillion dollars of student debt,
285.431	and our college completion rate
288.418	is 15 points, 15 percentage points below Canada.
295.369	We have a lot of debt.
297.476	Our economy grew from 2000 to 2007
302.458	on the back of consumers massively overborrowing.
305.69	Consumers paying off that debt is one of the main reasons
308.626	why our economic recovery is so sluggish today.
311.362	And everybody of course knows
312.948	that the federal government debt is growing
315.077	as a share of GDP at a very rapid rate,
318.406	and the only way that's going to stop is some combination
321.568	of faster growth in taxes or slower growth in entitlements,
326.645	also called transfer payments.
328.73	And that gets us down from the 1.5,
330.899	where we've reached for education, down to 1.3.
334.3	And then we have inequality.
336.718	Over the 15 years before the financial crisis,
339.471	the growth rate of the bottom 99 percent
342.737	of the income distribution was half a point slower
345.86	than the averages we've been talking about before.
348.636	All the rest went to the top one percent.
350.922	So that brings us down to 0.8.
353.274	And that 0.8 is the big challenge.
356.649	Are we going to grow at 0.8?
358.863	If so, that's going to require that our inventions
361.318	are as important as the ones that happened
363.665	over the last 150 years.
366.583	So let's see what some of those inventions were.
370.622	If you wanted to read in 1875 at night,
374.124	you needed to have an oil or a gas lamp.
377.446	They created pollution, they created odors,
379.603	they were hard to control, the light was dim,
382.008	and they were a fire hazard.
384.156	By 1929, electric light was everywhere.
389.251	We had the vertical city, the invention of the elevator.
393.4	Central Manhattan became possible.
396.385	And then, in addition to that, at the same time,
399.632	hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools
403.128	and hand-powered electric tools,
405.836	all achieved by electricity.
408.694	Electricity was also very helpful in liberating women.
412.907	Women, back in the late 19th century,
415.595	spent two days a week doing the laundry.
418.251	They did it on a scrub board.
419.966	Then they had to hang the clothes out to dry.
422.034	Then they had to bring them in.
423.566	The whole thing took two days out of the seven-day week.
426.519	And then we had the electric washing machine.
430.106	And by 1950, they were everywhere.
433.18	But the women still had to shop every day,
436.208	but no they didn't, because electricity
438.5	brought us the electric refrigerator.
441.401	Back in the late 19th century, the only source of heat in most homes
444.593	was a big fireplace in the kitchen that was used for cooking and heating.
449.122	The bedrooms were cold. They were unheated.
451.438	But by 1929, certainly by 1950,
454.118	we had central heating everywhere.
458.01	What about the internal combustion engine,
460.602	which was invented in 1879?
462.942	In America, before the motor vehicle,
466.76	transportation depended entirely on the urban horse,
470.732	which dropped, without restraint,
477.423	together with a gallon of urine.
479.347	That comes out at five to 10 tons daily
482.56	per square mile in cities.
484.993	Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.
490.934	That's the percentage of American agricultural land
493.332	it took to feed the horses.
495.525	Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented,
499.487	and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929,
502.691	that agricultural land could be used for human consumption
505.786	or for export.
507.32	And here's an interesting ratio: Starting from zero in 1900,
510.96	only 30 years later, the ratio of motor vehicles to the number of households
515.876	in the United States reached 90 percent in just 30 years.
522.46	Back before the turn of the century,
525.271	women had another problem.
526.672	All the water for cooking, cleaning and bathing
531.267	had to be carried in buckets and pails in from the outside.
535.937	It's a historical fact that in 1885,
538.412	the average North Carolina housewife
540.726	walked 148 miles a year carrying 35 tons of water.
546.096	But by 1929, cities around the country
550.5	had put in underground water pipes.
553.515	They had put in underground sewer pipes,
556.941	and as a result, one of the great scourges of the late 19th century,
562.123	waterborne diseases like cholera, began to disappear.
566.369	And an amazing fact for techno-optimists
569.971	is that in the first half of the 20th century,
572.543	the rate of improvement of life expectancy
575.255	was three times faster than it was
578.056	in the second half of the 19th century.
580.927	So it's a truism that things can't be more than 100 percent of themselves.
586.013	And I'll just give you a few examples.
588.195	We went from one percent to 90 percent of the speed of sound.
591.463	Electrification, central heat, ownership of motor cars,
595.071	they all went from zero to 100 percent.
597.434	Urban environments make people more productive than on the farm.
601.084	We went from 25 percent urban to 75 percent
603.926	by the early postwar years.
608.054	What about the electronic revolution?
610.297	Here's an early computer.
612.418	It's amazing. The mainframe computer was invented in 1942.
615.728	By 1960 we had telephone bills, bank statements
620.281	were being produced by computers.
622.052	The earliest cell phones, the earliest personal computers
624.916	were invented in the 1970s.
627.831	The 1980s brought us Bill Gates, DOS,
631.086	ATM machines to replace bank tellers,
633.871	bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector.
637.764	Fast forward through the '90s,
639.631	we had the dotcom revolution
641.199	and a temporary rise in productivity growth.
644.323	But I'm now going to give you an experiment.
646.775	You have to choose either option A or option B.
649.863	(Laughter)
652.378	Option A is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago.
655.719	So you get Google, you get Amazon,
658.629	you get Wikipedia, and you get running water and indoor toilets.
661.716	Or you get everything invented to yesterday,
663.545	including Facebook and your iPhone,
665.621	but you have to give up, go out to the outhouse,
667.98	and carry in the water.
670.844	Hurricane Sandy caused a lot of people to lose the 20th century,
674.294	maybe for a couple of days,
675.817	in some cases for more than a week,
677.943	electricity, running water, heating, gasoline for their cars,
681.483	and a charge for their iPhones.
684.399	The problem we face is that all these great inventions,
687.91	we have to match them in the future,
690.914	and my prediction that we're not going to match them
693.502	brings us down from the original two-percent growth
696.697	down to 0.2, the fanciful curve that I drew you at the beginning.
701.767	So here we are back to the horse and buggy.
704.774	I'd like to award an Oscar
707.095	to the inventors of the 20th century,
710.748	the people from Alexander Graham Bell
713.489	to Thomas Edison to the Wright Brothers,
715.192	I'd like to call them all up here,
716.915	and they're going to call back to you.
718.785	Your challenge is, can you match what we achieved?
722.448	Thank you.
723.982	(Applause)
