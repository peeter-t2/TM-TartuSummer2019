12.464	I'm going to talk about consciousness.
15.081	Why consciousness?
16.561	Well, it's a curiously neglected subject,
19.387	both in our scientific
19.387	and our philosophical culture.
22.951	Now why is that curious?
24.223	Well, it is the most important
24.223	aspect of our lives
27.733	for a very simple, logical reason,
29.691	namely, it's a necessary
29.691	condition on anything
32.088	being important in our lives
32.088	that we're conscious.
34.565	You care about science, philosophy,
34.565	music, art, whatever --
37.724	it's no good if you're
37.724	a zombie or in a coma, right?
41.202	So consciousness is number one.
43.546	The second reason is that when people do
46.014	get interested in it,
46.014	as I think they should,
48.33	they tend to say
48.33	the most appalling things.
51.181	And then, even when they're
51.181	not saying appalling things
53.825	and they're really trying
53.825	to do serious research,
56.183	well, it's been slow.
56.183	Progress has been slow.
59.324	When I first got interested
59.324	in this, I thought, well,
62.464	it's a straightforward problem in biology.
64.67	Let's get these brain stabbers
64.67	to get busy and figure out
67.167	how it works in the brain.
68.051	So I went over to UCSF and I talked to all
70.075	the heavy-duty neurobiologists there,
71.868	and they showed some impatience,
73.444	as scientists often do when you
73.444	ask them embarrassing questions.
76.827	But the thing that struck me is,
76.827	one guy said in exasperation,
80.585	a very famous neurobiologist,
80.585	"he said, ""Look,"
82.752	in my discipline it's okay to be
82.752	interested in consciousness,
86.175	"but get tenure first. Get tenure first."""
89.742	Now I've been working
89.742	on this for a long time.
92.46	I think now you might actually get tenure
94.438	by working on consciousness.
95.796	If so, that's a real step forward.
98.342	Okay, now why then is this
98.342	curious reluctance
101.247	and curious hostility to consciousness?
103.145	Well, I think it's a combination
103.145	of two features
105.875	of our intellectual culture
107.78	that like to think they're
107.78	opposing each other
110.306	but in fact they share
110.306	a common set of assumptions.
113.929	One feature is the tradition
113.929	of religious dualism:
117.891	Consciousness is not a part
117.891	of the physical world.
121.216	It's a part of the spiritual world.
123.143	It belongs to the soul,
124.679	and the soul is not a part
124.679	of the physical world.
127.975	That's the tradition of God,
127.975	the soul and immortality.
131.006	There's another tradition
131.006	that thinks it's opposed to this
133.111	but accepts the worst assumption.
135.215	That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty
135.215	scientific materialists:
139.293	Consciousness is not a part
139.293	of the physical world.
142.758	Either it doesn't exist at all,
142.758	or it's something else,
145.404	a computer program
145.404	or some damn fool thing,
148.054	but in any case it's not part of science.
151.249	And I used to get in an argument
151.249	that really gave me a stomachache.
153.457	Here's how it went.
155.076	Science is objective,
155.076	consciousness is subjective,
159.108	therefore there cannot be
159.108	a science of consciousness.
162.435	Okay, so these twin
162.435	traditions are paralyzing us.
168.939	It's very hard to get
168.939	out of these twin traditions.
171.807	And I have only one real
171.807	message in this lecture,
174.825	and that is, consciousness
174.825	is a biological phenomenon
178.209	like photosynthesis, digestion, mitosis --
181.098	you know all the biological phenomena
181.098	-- and once you accept that,
185.433	most, though not all, of the hard problems
188.072	about consciousness simply evaporate.
190.347	And I'm going to go through some of them.
192.4	Okay, now I promised you to tell you some
194.733	of the outrageous things
194.733	said about consciousness.
197.472	One: Consciousness does not exist.
201.072	It's an illusion, like sunsets.
203.302	Science has shown sunsets
203.302	and rainbows are illusions.
208.367	So consciousness is an illusion.
210.29	Two: Well, maybe it exists,
210.29	but it's really something else.
213.545	It's a computer program
213.545	running in the brain.
217.326	Three: No, the only thing
217.326	that exists is really behavior.
221.14	It's embarrassing how influential
221.14	behaviorism was,
224.748	but I'll get back to that.
226.103	And four: Maybe consciousness exists,
228.837	but it can't make
228.837	any difference to the world.
231.052	How could spirituality move anything?
233.772	Now, whenever somebody
233.772	tells me that, I think,
235.987	you want to see spirituality
235.987	move something?
238.277	Watch. I decide consciously
238.277	to raise my arm,
241.129	and the damn thing goes up. (Laughter)
243.738	Furthermore, notice this:
247.509	"We do not say, ""Well, it's a bit"
247.509	like the weather in Geneva.
251.504	Some days it goes up and some days
251.504	"it doesn't go up."""
254.152	No. It goes up whenever
254.152	I damn well want it to.
256.807	Okay. I'm going to tell
256.807	you how that's possible.
259.117	Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.
262.616	You can't do this if you
262.616	don't give a definition.
264.974	People always say consciousness
264.974	is very hard to define.
267.96	I think it's rather easy to define
269.843	if you're not trying to give
269.843	a scientific definition.
272.052	We're not ready
272.052	for a scientific definition,
274.332	but here's a common-sense definition.
276.118	Consciousness consists
276.118	of all those states of feeling
278.92	or sentience or awareness.
280.988	It begins in the morning when you
280.988	wake up from a dreamless sleep,
284.546	and it goes on all day
284.546	until you fall asleep
287.015	or die or otherwise become unconscious.
290.213	Dreams are a form of consciousness
290.213	on this definition.
293.333	Now, that's the common-sense definition.
293.333	That's our target.
296.235	If you're not talking about that,
296.235	you're not talking about consciousness.
299.736	"But they think, ""Well, if that's it,"
299.736	that's an awful problem.
303.22	How can such a thing exist
303.22	"as part of the real world?"""
307.178	And this, if you've ever
307.178	had a philosophy course,
309.536	this is known as the famous
309.536	mind-body problem.
312.287	I think that has a simple solution too.
312.287	I'm going to give it to you.
315.55	And here it is: All of our conscious
315.55	states, without exception,
319.552	are caused by lower-level
319.552	neurobiological processes in the brain,
325.077	and they are realized in the brain
327.258	as higher-level or system features.
329.592	It's about as mysterious
329.592	as the liquidity of water.
332.748	Right? The liquidity is not
332.748	an extra juice squirted out
336.223	by the H2O molecules.
337.913	It's a condition that the system is in.
340.791	And just as the jar full of water
340.791	can go from liquid to solid
345.953	depending on the behavior
345.953	of the molecules,
348.025	so your brain can go
348.025	from a state of being conscious
350.902	to a state of being unconscious,
352.542	depending on the behavior
352.542	of the molecules.
355.528	The famous mind-body
355.528	problem is that simple.
359.913	All right? But now we get
359.913	into some harder questions.
363.09	Let's specify the exact
363.09	features of consciousness,
366.534	so that we can then answer
366.534	those four objections
369.006	that I made to it.
370.293	Well, the first feature is,
370.293	it's real and irreducible.
374.56	You can't get rid of it.
376.614	You see, the distinction
376.614	between reality and illusion
380.785	is the distinction between how things
383.454	consciously seem to us
383.454	and how they really are.
387.328	It consciously seems like there's --
389.204	"I like the French ""arc-en-ciel"" —"
390.872	it seems like there's an arch in the sky,
393.07	or it seems like the sun
393.07	is setting over the mountains.
396.85	It consciously seems to us,
396.85	but that's not really happening.
399.947	But for that distinction between
401.874	how things consciously seem
401.874	and how they really are,
404.375	you can't make that distinction
404.375	for the very existence of consciousness,
408.43	because where the very existence
408.43	of consciousness is concerned,
412.281	if it consciously seems to you
412.281	that you are conscious,
415.261	you are conscious.
417.146	I mean, if a bunch of experts
417.146	come to me and say,
420.5	"""We are heavy-duty neurobiologists"
420.5	and we've done a study
423.191	of you, Searle, and we're
423.191	convinced you are not conscious,
425.941	you are a very cleverly
425.941	"constructed robot,"""
428.013	"I don't think, ""Well, maybe these"
428.013	"guys are right, you know?"""
431.282	I don't think that for a moment,
431.282	because, I mean,
433.845	Descartes may have made a lot
433.845	of mistakes, but he was right about this.
436.755	You cannot doubt the existence
436.755	of your own consciousness.
439.71	Okay, that's the first
439.71	feature of consciousness.
442.02	It's real and irreducible.
443.824	You cannot get rid of it
443.824	by showing that it's an illusion
447.055	in a way that you can
447.055	with other standard illusions.
450.284	Okay, the second feature is this one
452.816	that has been such
452.816	a source of trouble to us,
455.281	and that is, all of our conscious states
457.463	have this qualitative character to them.
460.427	There's something that it
460.427	feels like to drink beer
462.832	which is not what it feels
462.832	like to do your income tax
465.777	or listen to music,
465.777	and this qualitative feel
468.845	automatically generates a third feature,
471.406	namely, conscious states
471.406	are by definition subjective
475.2	in the sense that they only exist
475.2	as experienced
478.155	by some human or animal subject,
480.35	some self that experiences them.
482.223	Maybe we'll be able to build
482.223	a conscious machine.
484.606	Since we don't know how our brains do it,
486.759	we're not in a position, so far,
486.759	to build a conscious machine.
490.894	Okay. Another feature of consciousness
493.669	is that it comes in unified
493.669	conscious fields.
497.82	So I don't just have the sight
497.82	of the people in front of me
500.176	and the sound of my voice
500.176	and the weight of my shoes
502.89	against the floor, but they occur to me
505.065	as part of one single
505.065	great conscious field
508.547	that stretches forward and backward.
510.563	That is the key to understanding
512.332	the enormous power of consciousness.
514.771	And we have not been able
514.771	to do that in a robot.
517.715	The disappointment of robotics
517.715	derives from the fact
520.216	that we don't know how to make
520.216	a conscious robot,
522.574	so we don't have a machine
522.574	that can do this kind of thing.
525.623	Okay, the next feature of consciousness,
528.131	after this marvelous
528.131	unified conscious field,
531.246	is that it functions
531.246	causally in our behavior.
534.039	I gave you a scientific
534.039	demonstration by raising my hand,
537.242	but how is that possible?
538.992	How can it be that this
538.992	thought in my brain
542.756	can move material objects?
544.956	Well, I'll tell you the answer.
546.457	I mean, we don't know the detailed answer,
548.481	but we know the basic part
548.481	of the answer, and that is,
551.183	there is a sequence of neuron firings,
553.476	and they terminate where the acetylcholine
556.563	is secreted at the axon
556.563	end-plates of the motor neurons.
559.384	Sorry to use philosophical
559.384	terminology here,
561.504	but when it's secreted at the axon
561.504	end-plates of the motor neurons,
565.475	a whole lot of wonderful things
565.475	happen in the ion channels
568.261	and the damned arm goes up.
570.167	Now, think of what I told you.
572.291	One and the same event,
574.033	my conscious decision to raise my arm
577.068	has a level of description
577.068	where it has all of these
579.863	touchy-feely spiritual qualities.
582.009	It's a thought in my brain,
582.009	but at the same time,
584.41	it's busy secreting acetylcholine
586.396	and doing all sorts of other things
588.087	as it makes its way from the motor cortex
590.719	down through the nerve fibers in the arm.
593.416	Now, what that tells us
593.416	is that our traditional vocabularies
597.232	for discussing these issues
597.232	are totally obsolete.
600.616	One and the same event has
600.616	a level of description
603.873	where it's neurobiological,
603.873	and another level of description
606.839	where it's mental,
606.839	and that's a single event,
609.03	and that's how nature works.
609.03	That's how it's possible
611.578	for consciousness to function causally.
614.171	Okay, now with that in mind,
617.03	with going through these various
617.03	features of consciousness,
620.097	let's go back and answer
620.097	some of those early objections.
623.269	Well, the first one I said was,
623.269	consciousness doesn't exist,
626.878	it's an illusion. Well,
626.878	I've already answered that.
628.712	I don't think we need to worry about that.
630.736	But the second one had
630.736	an incredible influence,
634.092	and may still be around, and that is,
635.936	"""Well, if consciousness exists,"
635.936	it's really something else.
639.127	It's really a digital computer
639.127	program running in your brain
642.89	and that's what we need to do
642.89	to create consciousness
645.438	is get the right program.
646.891	Yeah, forget about the hardware.
646.891	Any hardware will do
649.439	provided it's rich enough and stable
649.439	"enough to carry the program."""
652.606	Now, we know that that's wrong.
655.164	I mean, anybody who's thought
655.164	about computers at all
658.173	can see that that's wrong,
658.173	because computation
660.637	is defined as symbol manipulation,
663.052	usually thought of as zeros
663.052	as ones, but any symbols will do.
665.981	You get an algorithm that you can program
669.103	in a binary code,
669.103	and that's the defining trait
672.21	of the computer program.
674.261	But we know that that's purely
674.261	syntactical. That's symbolic.
678.144	We know that actual human consciousness
678.144	has something more than that.
682.159	It's got a content
682.159	in addition to the syntax.
685.352	It's got a semantics.
686.849	Now that argument, I made
686.849	that argument 30 --
689.338	oh my God, I don't want
689.338	to think about it —
690.629	more than 30 years ago,
691.971	but there's a deeper argument
691.971	implicit in what I've told you,
694.9	and I want to tell you that argument
694.9	briefly, and that is,
697.943	consciousness creates
697.943	an observer-independent reality.
702.093	It creates a reality of money,
702.093	property, government,
705.581	marriage, CERN conferences,
709.553	cocktail parties and summer vacations,
712.172	and all of those are creations
712.172	of consciousness.
714.921	Their existence is observer-relative.
717.756	It's only relative to conscious
717.756	agents that a piece of paper
721.259	is money or that a bunch
721.259	of buildings is a university.
724.106	Now, ask yourself about computation.
727.98	Is that absolute, like force and mass
727.98	and gravitational attraction?
731.649	Or is it observer-relative?
733.781	Well, some computations are intrinsic.
737.308	I add two plus two to get four.
739.219	That's going on no matter
739.219	what anybody thinks.
741.79	But when I haul out my pocket calculator
744.279	and do the calculation,
744.279	the only intrinsic phenomenon
748.061	is the electronic circuit
748.061	and its behavior.
751.236	That's the only absolute phenomenon.
753	All the rest is interpreted by us.
755.428	Computation only exists
755.428	relative to consciousness.
759.269	Either a conscious agent
759.269	is carrying out the computation,
762.044	or he's got a piece of machinery that admits
762.044	of a computational interpretation.
765.83	Now that doesn't mean
765.83	computation is arbitrary.
768.755	I spent a lot of money on this hardware.
771.203	But we have this persistent confusion
773.349	between objectivity and subjectivity
773.349	as features of reality
778.07	and objectivity and subjectivity
778.07	as features of claims.
781.998	And the bottom line of this
781.998	part of my talk is this:
785.164	You can have a completely
785.164	objective science,
788.815	a science where you make
788.815	objectively true claims,
791.727	about a domain whose existence
791.727	is subjective,
795.157	whose existence is in the human brain
798.392	consisting of subjective
798.392	states of sentience
800.531	or feeling or awareness.
802.216	So the objection that you can't have
802.216	an objective science of consciousness
806.553	because it's subjective and science
806.553	is objective, that's a pun.
810.761	That's a bad pun on objectivity
810.761	and subjectivity.
813.47	You can make objective claims
815.794	about a domain that is subjective
815.794	in its mode of existence,
819.836	and indeed that's what neurologists do.
821.409	I mean, you have patients
821.409	that actually suffer pains,
823.957	and you try to get
823.957	an objective science of that.
826.588	Okay, I promised to refute all these guys,
828.66	and I don't have an awful
828.66	lot of time left,
830.235	but let me refute a couple more of them.
832.164	I said that behaviorism ought to be
834.378	one of the great embarrassments
834.378	of our intellectual culture,
837.667	because it's refuted
837.667	the moment you think about it.
840.56	Your mental states are identical
840.56	with your behavior?
843.417	Well, think about the distinction
843.417	between feeling a pain
846.568	and engaging in pain behavior.
848.271	I won't demonstrate pain
848.271	behavior, but I can tell you
850.259	I'm not having any pains right now.
852.098	So it's an obvious mistake. Why
852.098	did they make the mistake?
856.218	The mistake was — and you
856.218	can go back and read
858.433	the literature on this, you
858.433	can see this over and over —
861.124	they think if you accept
861.124	the irreducible existence
864.707	of consciousness, you're
864.707	giving up on science.
867.502	You're giving up on 300
867.502	years of human progress
870.573	and human hope and all the rest of it.
872.407	And the message I want
872.407	to leave you with is,
875.222	consciousness has to become accepted
877.665	as a genuine biological phenomenon,
880.153	as much subject to scientific analysis
882.62	as any other phenomenon in biology,
884.58	or, for that matter, the rest of science.
886.734	Thank you very much.
888.116	(Applause)
