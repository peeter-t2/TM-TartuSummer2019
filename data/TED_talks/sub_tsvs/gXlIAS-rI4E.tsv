12	This is my niece, Stella.
15.561	She's just turned one and started to walk.
18.057	And she's walking in that really cool way that
18.057	one-year-olds do,
21.057	a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving-
21.057	too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.
26.273	It is absolutely gorgeous.
28.762	And one of her favorite 
28.762	things to do at the moment
31.38	is to stare at herself in the mirror.
33.844	She absolutely loves her reflection.
36.999	She giggles and squeals, and gives
36.999	herself these big, wet kisses.
43.371	It is beautiful.
45.384	Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom
45.384	tells me that I used to do this,
50.676	and it got me thinking:
52.191	When did I stop doing this?
55.648	When is it suddenly not okay to love 
55.648	the way that we look?
60.951	Because apparently we don't.
63.636	Ten thousand people every month google,
67.065	"""Am I ugly?"""
69.211	This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she 
69.211	lives in Denver.
73.734	And like any teenager, she just wants to 
73.734	be liked and to fit in.
77.708	It's Sunday night.
79.517	She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.
82.211	And she's slightly dreading it, and 
82.211	she's a bit confused because
84.497	despite her mom telling her all the time
87.106	that she's beautiful,
89.452	every day at school, someone tells her 
89.452	that she's ugly.
95.364	Because of the difference between what her mom 
95.364	tells her and what her friends
98.629	at school, or her peers at school are telling her,
101.653	she doesn't know who to believe.
104.018	So, she takes a video of herself. 
104.018	She posts it to YouTube
107.967	and she asks people to please leave 
107.967	a comment:
110.293	"""Am I pretty or am I ugly?"""
112.41	Well, so far, Faye has received 
112.41	over 13,000 comments.
117.415	Some of them are so nasty, they don't 
117.415	bear thinking about.
121.019	This is an average, healthy-looking 
121.019	teenage girl receiving this feedback
126.95	at one of the most emotionally vulnerable
126.95	times in her life.
131.184	Thousands of people are posting videos like this,
135.081	mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.
138.918	But what's leading them to do this?
140.867	Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.
144.774	They're under pressure to be online
144.774	and available at all times,
149.604	talking, messaging, liking, commenting, 
149.604	sharing, posting —
154.145	it never ends.
156.062	Never before have we been so connected,
159.012	so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.
163.772	And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party
163.772	in their bedroom every night.
168.632	There's simply no privacy.
172.071	And the social pressures that go along 
172.071	with that are relentless.
176.424	This always-on environment is training
176.424	our kids to value themselves
181.302	based on the number of likes they get
183.013	and the types of comments that they receive.
186.012	There's no separation between online and offline life.
190.591	What's real or what isn't is really
190.591	hard to tell the difference between.
196.164	And it's also really hard to tell the difference 
196.164	between what's authentic
199.955	and what's digitally manipulated.
202.241	What's a highlight in someone's life versus
202.241	what's normal in the context of everyday.
207.886	And where are they looking to for inspiration?
211.017	Well, you can see the kinds of images
211.017	that are covering the newsfeeds
214.829	of girls today.
216.441	Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.
219.655	Airbrushing is now routine.
222.312	And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,
224.923	#bikinibridge and #proana.
227.042	For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.
230.586	These trends are teamed with the 
230.586	stereotyping and flagrant objectification
235.427	of women in today's popular culture.
237.631	It is not hard to see what girls are
237.631	benchmarking themselves against.
243.608	But boys are not immune to this either.
246.057	Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs
246.057	of superhero-like sports stars
251.189	and playboy music artists.
253.707	But, what's the problem with all of this?
256.079	Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, 
256.079	well balanced individuals.
263.132	But in an image-obsessed culture, we are
263.132	training our kids
267.008	to spend more time and mental effort on 
267.008	their appearance
271.816	at the expense of all of the other aspects
271.816	of their identities.
276.111	So, things like their relationships, the development
276.111	of their physical abilities,
280.221	and their studies and so on begin to suffer.
284.256	Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do 
284.256	something because they don't
289.858	think they look good enough.
291.722	These are not trivial activities.
294.104	These are fundamental activities to their
294.104	development as humans
298.008	and as contributors to society and to 
298.008	the workforce.
303.358	Thirty-one percent, nearly one in 
303.358	three teenagers, are withdrawing
309.279	from classroom debate. They're failing
310.851	to engage in classroom debate because
312.982	they don't want to draw attention to the 
312.982	way that they look.
316.232	One in five are not showing up to class at all
319.089	on days when they don't feel good about it.
321.456	And when it comes to exams,
322.876	if you don't think you look good enough,
325.225	specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,
328.561	you will score a lower grade point average
331.667	than your peers who are not concerned with this.
334.464	And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.
337.607	and China, and is true regardless of how much
337.607	you actually weigh.
343.664	So to be super clear, we're talking about the
346.546	way you think you look, not how
346.546	you actually look.
351.789	Low body confidence is undermining 
351.789	academic achievement.
356.544	But it's also damaging health.
358.952	Teenagers with low body confidence
358.952	do less physical activity,
362.534	eat less fruits and vegetables,
364.657	partake in more unhealthy weight control
364.657	practices
367.692	that can lead to eating disorders.
370.101	They have lower self-esteem.
372.654	They're more easily influenced by people around them
374.74	and they're at greater risk of depression.
377.488	And we think it's for all of these reasons
377.488	that they take more risks
381.416	with things like alcohol and drug use;
385.141	crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; 
385.141	unprotected, earlier sex;
390.552	and self-harm.
392.682	The pursuit of the perfect body is putting
392.682	pressure on our healthcare systems
396.816	and costing our governments billions of 
396.816	dollars every year.
401.263	And we don't grow out of it.
403.916	Women who think they're overweight — again,
406.815	regardless of whether they are or are not —
409.567	have higher rates of absenteeism.
412.877	Seventeen percent of women would
414.934	not show up to a job interview on
417.651	a day when they weren't feeling confident
417.651	about the way that they look.
422.961	Have a think about what this is doing
424.866	to our economy.
426.582	If we could overcome this, what that
428.444	opportunity looks like.
430.754	Unlocking this potential is in the interest
433.349	of every single one of us.
436.609	But how do we do that?
438.181	Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.
442.153	It's not enough by itself.
444.037	If you actually want to make a difference,
445.462	you have to do something.
447.598	And we've learned there are three key ways:
450.672	The first is we have to educate for body confidence.
453.314	We have to help our teenagers develop
455.236	strategies to overcome image-related pressures
458.581	and build their self-esteem.
460.131	Now, the good news is that there are
462.117	many programs out there available
462.117	to do this.
466.07	The bad news is that most of them don't work.
469.82	I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning
474.527	programs are inadvertently actually
477.755	making the situation worse.
481.15	So we need to make damn sure that
482.856	the programs that our kids are receiving
485.459	are not only having a positive impact,
487.419	but having a lasting impact as well.
490.387	And the research shows 
490.387	that the best programs
493.779	address six key areas:
495.854	The first is the influence of family, 
495.854	friends and relationships.
499.917	The second is media and celebrity culture,
503.381	then how to handle teasing and bullying,
505.433	the way we compete and compare with
505.433	one another
507.425	based on looks,
508.962	talking about appearance — some people
510.712	"call this ""body talk"" or ""fat talk"" —"
513.219	and finally, the foundations of respecting
515.693	and looking after yourself.
517.467	These six things are crucial starting points
519.94	for anyone serious about delivering
522.831	body-confidence education that works.
525.768	An education is critical,
528.074	but tackling this problem is going
529.895	to require each and everyone of us
532.665	to step up and be better role models
535.255	for the women and girls in our own lives.
538.233	Challenging the status quo of how
540.166	women are seen and talked about in
540.166	our own circles.
543.17	It is not okay that we judge the contribution
547.212	of our politicians by their haircuts
550.37	or the size of their breasts,
552.099	or to infer that the determination or the success
555.464	of an Olympian is down 
555.464	to her not being a looker.
558.697	We need to start judging people by what they do,
561.803	not what they look like.
564.354	We can all start by taking responsibility 
564.354	for the types of pictures
568.718	and comments that we post
570.361	on our own social networks.
572.548	We can compliment people based on 
572.548	their effort
576.777	and their actions
578.18	and not on their appearance.
580.861	And let me ask you,
582.375	when was the last time that you
583.663	kissed a mirror?
585.519	Ultimately, we need to work together
587.812	as communities, as governments
590.236	and as businesses to really change
590.236	this culture of ours
594.701	so that our kids grow up valuing their 
594.701	whole selves,
599.306	valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
603.969	We need to put the people that are
603.969	making a real difference
606.765	on our pedestals, making a difference
610.173	in the real world.
612.153	Giving them the airtime, because only then
614.863	will we create a different world.
616.728	A world where our kids are free to become
620.057	the best versions of themselves,
623.302	where the way they think they look
625.248	never holds them back from being
625.248	who they are
627.889	or achieving what they want in life.
630.835	Think about what this might mean 
630.835	for someone in your life.
635.053	Who have you got in mind?
636.551	Is it your wife?
637.956	Your sister?
639.344	Your daughter?
640.993	Your niece?
642.266	Your friend? It could just be the woman 
642.266	a couple of seats away
645.329	from you today.
646.624	What would it mean for her
649.314	if she were freed from that voice
653.072	of her inner critic, nagging her to have
656.106	longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,
658.897	shorter feet?
660.332	What could it mean for her if we overcame this
663.7	and unlocked her potential in that way?
668.213	Right now, our culture's obsession
672.035	with image is holding us all back.
675.39	But let's show our kids the truth.
677.917	Let's show them that the way you look
679.932	is just one part of your identity
683.647	and that the truth is we love them
686.36	for who they are
687.931	and what they do
689.898	and how they make us feel.
692.598	Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.
696.683	Let's each and every one of us change the way
699.343	we talk and compare ourselves to other people.
702.778	And let's work together as communities,
705.508	from grassroots to governments,
708.302	so that the happy little one-year-olds
710.477	of today become the confident
713.354	changemakers of tomorrow.
715.969	Let's do this.
717.986	(Applause)
