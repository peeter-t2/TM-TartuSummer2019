13.24	A few years ago,
13.24	I broke into my own house.
16.88	I had just driven home,
18.12	it was around midnight
18.12	in the dead of Montreal winter,
20.68	I had been visiting my friend,
20.68	Jeff, across town,
23	and the thermometer on the front porch
23	read minus 40 degrees --
27.8	and don't bother asking
27.8	if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,
30.92	minus 40 is where the two scales meet --
33.4	it was very cold.
34.68	And as I stood on the front porch
34.68	fumbling in my pockets,
37.92	I found I didn't have my keys.
40.2	In fact, I could see them
40.2	through the window,
42.32	lying on the dining room table
42.32	where I had left them.
45.44	So I quickly ran around
45.44	and tried all the other doors and windows,
48.6	and they were locked tight.
50.2	I thought about calling a locksmith --
50.2	at least I had my cellphone,
53.367	but at midnight, it could take a while
53.367	for a locksmith to show up,
56.72	and it was cold.
60.421	I couldn't go back to my friend
60.421	Jeff's house for the night
63.16	because I had an early flight
63.16	to Europe the next morning,
65.851	and I needed to get
65.851	my passport and my suitcase.
68.4	So, desperate and freezing cold,
70.92	I found a large rock and I broke
70.92	through the basement window,
74.56	cleared out the shards of glass,
76.56	I crawled through,
77.92	I found a piece of cardboard
77.92	and taped it up over the opening,
81.36	figuring that in the morning,
81.36	on the way to the airport,
84.004	I could call my contractor
84.004	and ask him to fix it.
86.8	This was going to be expensive,
88.301	but probably no more expensive
88.301	than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,
91.88	so I figured, under the circumstances,
91.88	I was coming out even.
96.92	Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training
99.12	and I know a little bit
99.12	about how the brain performs under stress.
103.24	It releases cortisol
103.24	that raises your heart rate,
106.8	it modulates adrenaline levels
109.08	and it clouds your thinking.
111.08	So the next morning,
113.08	when I woke up on too little sleep,
115.56	worrying about the hole in the window,
118.32	and a mental note
118.32	that I had to call my contractor,
121.12	and the freezing temperatures,
122.84	and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,
125.32	and, you know, with all
125.32	the cortisol in my brain,
128.88	my thinking was cloudy,
130.28	but I didn't know it was cloudy
130.28	because my thinking was cloudy.
133.72	(Laughter)
135.24	And it wasn't until I got
135.24	to the airport check-in counter,
138.52	that I realized I didn't have my passport.
140.8	(Laughter)
142.84	So I raced home in the snow
142.84	and ice, 40 minutes,
146.32	got my passport,
146.32	raced back to the airport,
148.8	I made it just in time,
150.64	but they had given away
150.64	my seat to someone else,
152.903	so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
152.903	next to the bathrooms,
155.903	in a seat that wouldn't recline,
155.903	on an eight-hour flight.
159.88	Well, I had a lot of time to think
159.88	during those eight hours and no sleep.
163.36	(Laughter)
164.52	And I started wondering,
164.52	are there things that I can do,
167.2	systems that I can put into place,
169.16	that will prevent bad things
169.16	from happening?
171.64	Or at least if bad things happen,
173.56	will minimize the likelihood
173.56	of it being a total catastrophe.
179.36	So I started thinking about that,
180.96	but my thoughts didn't crystallize
180.96	until about a month later.
183.842	I was having dinner with my colleague,
183.842	Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,
187.56	and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
187.56	about having broken my window,
190.96	and, you know, forgotten my passport,
193.4	and Danny shared with me
194.64	that he'd been practicing
194.64	something called prospective hindsight.
199.16	(Laughter)
200.92	It's something that he had gotten
200.92	from the psychologist Gary Klein,
204.087	who had written about it
204.087	a few years before,
206.16	also called the pre-mortem.
208.28	Now, you all know what the postmortem is.
210.257	Whenever there's a disaster,
211.76	a team of experts come in and they try
211.76	to figure out what went wrong, right?
216.08	Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,
218.52	you look ahead and you try to figure out
218.52	all the things that could go wrong,
222.44	and then you try to figure out
222.44	what you can do
225.04	to prevent those things from happening,
225.04	or to minimize the damage.
228.56	So what I want to talk to you about today
231.52	are some of the things we can do
231.52	in the form of a pre-mortem.
235.08	Some of them are obvious,
235.08	some of them are not so obvious.
238	I'll start with the obvious ones.
239.96	Around the home, designate a place
239.96	for things that are easily lost.
245.68	Now, this sounds
245.68	like common sense, and it is,
249.56	but there's a lot of science
249.56	to back this up,
252.12	based on the way our spatial memory works.
255.44	There's a structure in the brain
255.44	called the hippocampus,
258.32	that evolved over tens
258.32	of thousands of years,
261.28	to keep track of the locations
261.28	of important things --
265.08	where the well is,
265.08	where fish can be found,
267.52	that stand of fruit trees,
270.04	where the friendly and enemy tribes live.
272.68	The hippocampus is the part of the brain
274.609	that in London taxicab drivers
274.609	becomes enlarged.
278.12	It's the part of the brain
278.12	that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
281.84	And if you're wondering,
281.84	somebody actually did the experiment
284.722	where they cut off
284.722	the olfactory sense of the squirrels,
287.52	and they could still find their nuts.
289.36	They weren't using smell,
289.36	they were using the hippocampus,
292.2	this exquisitely evolved mechanism
292.2	in the brain for finding things.
297.24	But it's really good for things
297.24	that don't move around much,
301	not so good for things that move around.
303.48	So this is why we lose car keys
303.48	and reading glasses and passports.
307.8	So in the home,
307.8	designate a spot for your keys --
310.32	a hook by the door,
310.32	maybe a decorative bowl.
313.2	For your passport, a particular drawer.
315.32	For your reading glasses,
315.32	a particular table.
318.12	If you designate a spot
318.12	and you're scrupulous about it,
321.6	your things will always be there
321.6	when you look for them.
324.44	What about travel?
325.68	Take a cell phone picture
325.68	of your credit cards,
328.08	your driver's license, your passport,
330.4	mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.
332.68	If these things are lost or stolen,
332.68	you can facilitate replacement.
337.08	Now these are some rather obvious things.
339.72	Remember, when you're under stress,
339.72	the brain releases cortisol.
343.28	Cortisol is toxic,
343.28	and it causes cloudy thinking.
346.52	So part of the practice of the pre-mortem
349.08	is to recognize that under stress
349.08	you're not going to be at your best,
353.36	and you should put systems in place.
355.68	And there's perhaps
355.68	no more stressful a situation
358.64	than when you're confronted
358.64	with a medical decision to make.
362.08	And at some point, all of us
362.08	are going to be in that position,
365.4	where we have to make
365.4	a very important decision
367.8	about the future of our medical care
367.8	or that of a loved one,
371.12	to help them with a decision.
372.8	And so I want to talk about that.
374.44	And I'm going to talk about
374.44	a very particular medical condition.
377.48	But this stands as a proxy for all kinds
377.48	of medical decision-making,
381.04	and indeed for financial decision-making,
381.04	and social decision-making --
385.08	any kind of decision you have to make
387.36	that would benefit from a rational
387.36	assessment of the facts.
391.4	So suppose you go to your doctor
391.4	and the doctor says,
394.56	"""I just got your lab work back,"
394.56	"your cholesterol's a little high."""
399.24	Now, you all know that high cholesterol
402.28	is associated with an increased risk
402.28	of cardiovascular disease,
406.44	heart attack, stroke.
407.88	And so you're thinking
409.12	having high cholesterol
409.12	isn't the best thing,
411.24	and so the doctor says,
411.24	"""You know, I'd like to give you a drug"
414.28	that will help you
414.28	"lower your cholesterol, a statin."""
417.08	And you've probably heard of statins,
419	you know that they're among
419	the most widely prescribed drugs
421.834	in the world today,
423.032	you probably even know
423.032	people who take them.
425.135	And so you're thinking,
425.135	"""Yeah! Give me the statin."""
427.541	But there's a question
427.541	you should ask at this point,
430	a statistic you should ask for
431.88	that most doctors
431.88	don't like talking about,
434.36	and pharmaceutical companies
434.36	like talking about even less.
438.8	It's for the number needed to treat.
441.2	Now, what is this, the NNT?
443.2	It's the number of people
443.2	that need to take a drug
446.28	or undergo a surgery
446.28	or any medical procedure
449.16	before one person is helped.
451.56	And you're thinking,
451.56	what kind of crazy statistic is that?
454.44	The number should be one.
455.68	My doctor wouldn't prescribe
455.68	something to me
457.76	if it's not going to help.
459.069	But actually, medical practice
459.069	doesn't work that way.
461.578	And it's not the doctor's fault,
463.134	if it's anybody's fault,
463.134	it's the fault of scientists like me.
466.077	We haven't figured out
466.077	the underlying mechanisms well enough.
468.966	But GlaxoSmithKline estimates
471.4	that 90 percent of the drugs work
471.4	in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
476.4	So the number needed to treat
476.4	for the most widely prescribed statin,
480.24	what do you suppose it is?
482.4	How many people have to take it
482.4	before one person is helped?
487.075	This is according to research
488.48	by research practitioners
488.48	Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
492	independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.
494.8	I ran through the numbers myself.
	take the drug for a year
500.32	before one heart attack, stroke
500.32	or other adverse event is prevented.
504.32	Now you're probably thinking,
505.725	"""Well, OK, one in 300 chance"
505.725	of lowering my cholesterol.
508.56	Why not, doc? Give me
508.56	"the prescription anyway."""
510.8	But you should ask at this point
510.8	for another statistic,
513.68	"and that is, ""Tell me"
513.68	"about the side effects."" Right?"
516.28	So for this particular drug,
517.96	the side effects occur
517.96	in five percent of the patients.
521.64	And they include terrible things --
523.331	debilitating muscle and joint pain,
523.331	gastrointestinal distress --
527.799	"but now you're thinking, ""Five percent,"
529.682	not very likely
529.682	it's going to happen to me,
531.72	"I'll still take the drug."""
532.982	But wait a minute.
534.2	Remember under stress
534.2	you're not thinking clearly.
536.56	So think about how you're going
536.56	to work through this ahead of time,
539.75	so you don't have to manufacture
539.75	the chain of reasoning on the spot.
	One person's helped,
545.489	five percent of those 300
545.489	have side effects,
547.92	that's 15 people.
549.8	You're 15 times more likely
549.8	to be harmed by the drug
553.72	than you are to be helped by the drug.
556.56	Now, I'm not saying whether you
556.56	should take the statin or not.
559.489	I'm just saying you should have
559.489	this conversation with your doctor.
562.656	Medical ethics requires it,
564	it's part of the principle
564	of informed consent.
566.32	You have the right to have access
566.32	to this kind of information
569.56	to begin the conversation about whether
569.56	you want to take the risks or not.
573.48	Now you might be thinking
574.72	I've pulled this number
574.72	out of the air for shock value,
577.44	but in fact it's rather typical,
577.44	this number needed to treat.
580.72	For the most widely performed surgery
580.72	on men over the age of 50,
585.36	removal of the prostate for cancer,
587.6	the number needed to treat is 49.
590.2	That's right, 49 surgeries are done
590.2	for every one person who's helped.
594.4	And the side effects in that case
594.4	occur in 50 percent of the patients.
599.08	They include impotence,
599.08	erectile dysfunction,
601.96	urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,
604.76	fecal incontinence.
606.24	And if you're lucky, and you're one
606.24	of the 50 percent who has these,
609.76	they'll only last for a year or two.
612.88	So the idea of the pre-mortem
612.88	is to think ahead of time
616.52	to the questions
616.52	that you might be able to ask
619.08	that will push the conversation forward.
621.48	You don't want to have to manufacture
621.48	all of this on the spot.
624.6	And you also want to think
624.6	about things like quality of life.
627.52	Because you have a choice oftentimes,
629.32	do you I want a shorter life
629.32	that's pain-free,
631.64	or a longer life that might have
631.64	a great deal of pain towards the end?
635.44	These are things to talk about
635.44	and think about now,
637.88	with your family and your loved ones.
639.72	You might change your mind
639.72	in the heat of the moment,
642.24	but at least you're practiced
642.24	with this kind of thinking.
645.32	Remember, our brain under stress
645.32	releases cortisol,
649.96	and one of the things
649.96	that happens at that moment
652.32	is a whole bunch on systems shut down.
654.28	There's an evolutionary reason for this.
656.209	Face-to-face with a predator,
656.209	you don't need your digestive system,
659.64	or your libido, or your immune system,
662.12	because if you're body is expending
662.12	metabolism on those things
665.8	and you don't react quickly,
667.48	you might become the lion's lunch,
667.48	and then none of those things matter.
671.48	Unfortunately,
672.92	one of the things that goes out the window
672.92	during those times of stress
676.56	is rational, logical thinking,
678.56	as Danny Kahneman
678.56	and his colleagues have shown.
682	So we need to train ourselves
682	to think ahead
685.2	to these kinds of situations.
687.48	I think the important point here
687.48	is recognizing that all of us are flawed.
693.68	We all are going to fail now and then.
696.56	The idea is to think ahead
696.56	to what those failures might be,
700.2	to put systems in place
700.2	that will help minimize the damage,
704.12	or to prevent the bad things
704.12	from happening in the first place.
708.28	Getting back to that
708.28	snowy night in Montreal,
710.96	when I got back from my trip,
712.72	I had my contractor install
712.72	a combination lock next to the door,
716.6	with a key to the front door in it,
716.6	an easy to remember combination.
720.16	And I have to admit,
721.4	I still have piles of mail
721.4	that haven't been sorted,
724.84	and piles of emails
724.84	that I haven't gone through.
727.44	So I'm not completely organized,
729.24	but I see organization
729.24	as a gradual process,
732.4	and I'm getting there.
733.64	Thank you very much.
734.88	(Applause)
