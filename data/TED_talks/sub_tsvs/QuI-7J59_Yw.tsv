16.323	I am a PhD student.
19.054	And that means I have a question:
21.181	How can we make digital content graspable?
24.892	Because you see, on the one hand,
24.892	there is the digital world
28.469	and no question, many things
28.469	are happening there right now.
31.929	And for us humans, it's not quite
31.929	material, it's not really there --
35.379	it's virtual.
37.014	On the other hand,
38.26	we're humans, we live in a physical world.
40.37	It's rich, it tastes good,
40.37	it feels good, it smells good.
43.719	So the question is:
44.904	How do we get the stuff over
44.904	from the digital into the physical?
47.98	That's my question.
49.57	If you look at the iPhone with its touch
51.72	and the Wii with its bodily activity,
53.721	you can see the tendency;
53.721	it's getting physical.
56.722	The question is: What's next?
59.229	Now, I have three options
59.229	that I would like to show you.
62.276	The first one is mass.
64.909	As humans, we are sensitive
64.909	to where an object in our hand is heavy.
68.524	So could we use that in mobile phones?
71.26	Let me show you
71.26	the weight-shifting mobile.
73.769	It is a mobile phone-shaped box
75.502	that has an iron weight inside,
75.502	which we can move around,
78.641	and you can feel where it's heavy.
80.458	We shift the gravitational center of it.
83.937	For example, we can augment
83.937	digital content with physical mass.
88.033	So you move around the content
88.033	on the display,
90.233	but you can also feel where it is
90.233	just from the weight of the device.
94.748	Another thing it's good for is navigation.
97.954	It can guide you around in a city.
99.96	It can tell you by its weight,
101.651	"""OK, move right. Walk ahead."
101.651	"Make a left here."""
104.652	And the good thing about that is,
106.293	you don't have to look
106.293	at the device all the time;
108.695	you have your eyes free to see the city.
110.667	Now, mass is the first thing --
112.227	the second thing, that's shape.
114.701	We're also sensitive to the shape
114.701	of objects we have in our hands.
118.079	So if I download an e-book
118.079	and it has 20 pages --
120.639	well, they could be thin, right?
122.21	But if it has 500 pages,
122.21	"I want to feel that ""Harry Potter"" --"
125.192	it's thick.
126.378	(Laughter)
127.408	So let me show you
127.408	the shape-changing mobile.
130.26	Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,
132.26	and this one can change its shape.
136.892	We can play with the shape itself.
138.616	For example, it can be thin
138.616	in your pocket,
140.689	which we of course want it to be.
142.356	But then if you hold it in your hand,
142.356	it can lean towards you, be thick.
145.806	It's like tapered to the downside.
147.807	If you change the grasp,
147.807	it can adjust to that.
151.496	It's also useful if you want to put it
151.496	down on your nightstand
154.542	to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.
156.61	It stands.
157.795	It's fairly simple.
159.26	Another thing is,
160.975	sometimes we watch things
160.975	on a mobile phone
163.096	that are bigger than the phone itself.
165.108	In that case -- like here, there's an app
167.142	that's bigger than the phone's screen --
169.079	the shape of the phone could tell you,
170.978	"""OK, off the screen, right here,"
170.978	there is more content.
173.6	"You can't see it, but it's there."""
175.255	And you can feel it,
175.255	because it's thicker at that edge.
178.077	The shape is the second thing.
180.26	The third thing operates
180.26	on a different level.
183.626	As humans, we are social, we are empathic,
186.647	and that's great.
188.374	Wouldn't that be a way to make
188.374	mobile phones more intuitive?
191.467	Think of a hamster in the pocket.
193.348	Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.
193.348	I don't have to check it.
196.664	(Laughter)
197.714	Let me show you the living mobile phone.
200.003	So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.
202.555	But this one, it has
202.555	a breath and a heartbeat,
205.883	and it feels very organic.
207.729	(Laughter)
210.045	And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
212.366	Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,
214.721	new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting.
216.762	(Laughter)
218.531	How do we calm it down?
220.577	You give it a pat behind the ears,
223.313	and everything is all right again.
225.26	That's very intuitive,
225.26	and that's what we want.
227.957	So what we have seen are three ways
227.957	to make the digital graspable for us.
232.076	And I think making it physical
232.076	is a good way to do that.
235.261	What's behind that is a postulation,
237.793	namely, not that humans should get
237.793	much more technical in the future;
242.053	rather than that, technology,
242.053	a bit more human.
247.26	(Applause)
