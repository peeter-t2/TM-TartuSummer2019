12.757	Five hundred seventy-one million
16.244	two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels
22.551	are used by Americans
24.438	every year.
28.109	If we could -- correction, wrong figure --
33.515	If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,
36.618	one paper towel per person per day,
46.681	We can do that.
48.816	Now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers.
52.746	There's the tri-fold. People typically take two or three.
56.977	There's the one that cuts it, that you have to tear off.
61.14	People go one, two, three, four, tear.
63.404	This much, right?
64.842	There's the one that cuts itself.
67.307	People go, one, two, three, four.
71.447	Or there's the same thing, but recycled paper,
75.522	you have to get five of those because they're not as absorbent, of course.
80.035	The fact is, you can do it all with one towel.
86.556	The key, two words:
88.596	"This half of the room, your word is ""shake."""
93.044	Let's hear it. Shake. Louder.
95.226	Audience: Shake.
96.771	"Joe Smith: Your word is ""fold."""
98.947	Audience: Fold.
100.063	JS: Again.
100.99	Audience: Fold. JS: Really loud.
103.059	Audience: Shake. Fold.
104.607	JS: OK. Wet hands.
108.767	Shake -- one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.
113.567	Why 12? Twelve apostles, twelve tribes,
116.505	twelve zodiac signs, twelve months. The one I like the best:
120.612	It's the biggest number with one syllable.
122.809	(Laughter)
127.071	Tri-fold. Fold ...
134.431	Dry.
135.983	(Applause)
140.215	Audience: Shake.
145.429	Fold.
148.361	JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important
150.939	because it allows interstitial suspension.
155.821	You don't have to remember that part, but trust me.
158.299	(Laughter)
163.352	Audience: Shake. Fold.
170.069	JS: Cuts itself.
175.731	You know the funny thing is,
176.888	I get my hands drier than people do with three or four,
179.063	because they can't get in between the cracks.
181.511	If you think this isn't as good...
184.655	Audience: Shake. Fold.
193.124	JS: Now, there's now a real fancy invention,
196.692	it's the one where you wave your hand
199.099	and it kicks it out.
200.89	It's way too big a towel.
202.976	Let me tell you a secret.
204.003	If you're really quick, if you're really quick --
206.09	and I can prove this --
207.67	this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building.
212.519	How? As soon as it starts, you just tear it off.
215.886	It's smart enough to stop.
217.558	And you get half a towel.
221.55	Audience: Shake. Fold.
234.827	JS: Now, let's all say it together. Shake. Fold.
241.661	You will for the rest of your life remember those words
245.804	every time you pick up a paper towel.
248.787	And remember, one towel per person for one year --
258.595	And next year, toilet paper.
260.843	(Laughter)
