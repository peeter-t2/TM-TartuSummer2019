12.598	Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.
15.271	Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out
18.214	and see so many women.
20.132	It's so not my regular experience, 
20.132	as I know anyone else's.
25.262	PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,
30.654	which we assumed it would be, but 
30.654	that you had very much on your mind
35.31	the missing leadership positions, particularly 
35.31	in the sector of technology and social media.
42.464	But how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?
49.238	SS: So I was really scared to get on 
49.238	this stage and talk about women,
51.809	because I grew up in the business 
51.809	world, as I think so many of us did.
55.461	You never talk about being a woman, because 
55.461	someone might notice that you're a woman, right?
61.793	"They might notice. Or worse, if you say ""woman,"" "
61.793	people on the other end of the table
65.953	think you're asking for special 
65.953	treatment, or complaining.
69.043	Or worse, about to sue them. 
69.043	And so I went through -- (Laughter)
72.751	Right? I went through my entire business career,
74.929	and never spoke about being a woman, 
74.929	never spoke about it publicly.
78.557	But I also had noticed that it wasn't working.
81.46	I came out of college over 
84.899	that all of my peers were men and women, 
84.899	all the people above me were all men,
88.798	but that would change,
89.896	because your generation had done such 
89.896	an amazing job fighting for equality,
94.429	equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.
98.041	Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,
101.376	and now, often the only woman in a room.
103.328	And I talked to a bunch of people about,
105.418	should I give a speech at TEDWomen 
105.418	about women, and they said, oh no, no.
108.839	It will end your business career. You 
108.839	cannot be a serious business executive
114.033	and speak about being a woman. 
114.033	You'll never be taken seriously again.
117.471	But fortunately, there were the few, the proud -- like you -- who told me I should give the speech,
122.346	and I asked myself the question 
122.346	Mark Zuckerberg might --
125.002	the founder of Facebook and my boss --
126.84	asks all of us, which is, what 
126.84	would I do if I wasn't afraid?
131.419	And the answer to what would I do if I wasn't 
131.419	afraid is I would get on the TED stage,
135.241	and talk about women, and leadership. 
135.241	And I did, and survived. (Applause)
142.746	PM: I would say, not only survived. 
142.746	I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,
146.581	when you and I were standing backstage 
146.581	together, and you turned to me,
150.914	and you told me a story.
152.652	And I said -- very last minute -- you know, 
152.652	you really should share that story.
156.531	SS: Oh, yeah.
156.531	PM: What was that story?
158.281	SS: Well, it's an important part of the 
158.281	journey. So I had -- TEDWomen --
161.546	the original one was in D.C. -- so I live here, 
161.546	so I had gotten on a plane the day before,
165.355	and my daughter was three, she was 
165.355	"clinging to my leg: ""Mommy, don't go."""
170.404	And Pat's a friend, and so, not related 
170.404	to the speech I was planning on giving,
174.137	which was chock full of facts and 
174.137	figures, and nothing personal,
178.599	I told Pat the story. I said, well, 
178.599	I'm having a hard day.
180.865	Yesterday my daughter was clinging 
180.865	"to my leg, and ""Don't go."""
183.469	And you looked at me and said, 
183.469	you have to tell that story.
185.213	I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?
189.448	I'm going to get on a stage and admit 
189.448	my daughter was clinging to my leg?
191.905	And you said yes, because if you want to talk 
191.905	about getting more women into leadership roles,
196.072	you have to be honest about how hard it is.
199.209	And I did. And I think that's a really 
199.209	important part of the journey.
203.945	The same thing happened when I wrote my book. 
203.945	I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,
209.243	I thought it was fabulous. It was 
209.243	chock-full of data and figures,
213.209	I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai 
213.209	tribes, and their sociological patterns.
221.069	My husband read it and he was like, this 
221.069	is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)
226.132	No one -- and I apologize to Wheaties if there's 
226.132	someone -- no one, no one will read this book.
233.497	And I realized through the process that I 
233.497	had to be more honest and more open,
237.682	and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still 
237.682	not feeling as self-confident as I should,
242.428	in many situations. My first and 
242.428	failed marriage. Crying at work.
248.647	Felling like I didn't belong there, 
248.647	feeling guilty to this day.
252.319	And part of my journey, starting on this stage, 
252.319	"going to ""Lean In,"" going to the foundation,"
256.714	is all about being more open and 
256.714	honest about those challenges,
260.602	so that other women can be more open and honest,
262.61	and all of us can work together towards real equality.
266.242	PM: I think that one of the most 
266.242	striking parts about the book,
269.584	and in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such 
269.584	a nerve and is resonating around the world,
275.449	is that you are personal in the book, 
275.449	and that you do make it clear that,
281.234	while you've observed some things that are 
281.234	very important for other women to know,
285.392	that you've had the same challenges 
285.392	that many others of us have,
289.951	as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and 
289.951	possibly the people who don't believe the same.
296.746	So talk about that process: deciding 
296.746	you'd go public with the private part,
301.384	and then you would also put yourself in 
301.384	the position of something of an expert
305.101	on how to resolve those challenges.
308.542	SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was --
310.726	you know, I never really expected to write 
310.726	a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,
314.474	and it was viewed a lot, and it really 
314.474	started impacting people's lives.
319.143	I got this great --- one of the first 
319.143	letters I got was from a woman
322.663	who said that she was offered a really big 
322.663	promotion at work, and she turned it down,
327.789	and she told her best friend she turned 
327.789	it down, and her best friend said,
330.142	you really need to watch this TED Talk.
331.975	And so she watched this TED Talk, and she 
331.975	went back the next day, she took the job,
336.391	she went home, and she handed her 
336.391	husband the grocery list. (Laughter)
341.239	And she said, I can do this.
342.831	And what really mattered to me -- it wasn't 
342.831	only women in the corporate world,
345.984	even though I did hear from a lot of 
345.984	them, and it did impact a lot of them,
348.954	it was also people of all different circumstances.
352.784	There was a doctor I met who was an 
352.784	attending physician at Johns Hopkins,
356.531	and he said that until he saw my TED 
356.531	Talk, it never really occurred to him
360.124	that even though half the students in 
360.124	his med school classes were women,
362.498	they weren't speaking as much as 
362.498	the men as he did his rounds.
365.409	So he started paying attention, and as he waited for 
365.409	raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.
371.635	So he started encouraging the 
371.635	women to raise their hands more,
373.92	and it still didn't work.
375.197	So he told everyone, no more 
375.197	hand raising, I'm cold-calling.
378.751	So he could call evenly on men and women. 
378.751	And what he proved to himself was that
382.955	the women knew the answers just as well or better,
385.588	and he was able to go back 
385.588	to them and tell them that.
387.476	And then there was the woman, stay-at-home 
387.476	mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,
392.595	with not a great school, she said that TED 
392.595	Talk -- she's never had a corporate job,
396.631	but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school 
396.631	and fight for a better teacher for her child.
402.406	And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.
406.698	And I realized that other women and 
406.698	men could find their voice through it,
410.752	which is why I went from the talk to the book.
413.474	PM: And in the book, you not only found your 
413.474	voice, which is clear and strong in the book,
419.799	but you also share what you've learned --
423.363	the experiences of other people in the lessons.
426.506	And that's what I'm thinking about 
426.506	in terms of putting yourself in a --
430.688	you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.
435.642	So what did that feel like, and 
435.642	become like in your life?
440.034	To launch not just a book, not just 
440.034	a best-selling, best-viewed talk,
446.246	but a movement, where people began to 
446.246	literally describe their actions at work as,
452.09	I'm leaning in.
454.772	SS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored, 
454.772	I'm happy, and it's the very beginning.
461.986	So I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is 
461.986	an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.
466.5	I have read every study, I have 
466.5	pored over the materials,
469.713	and the lessons are very clear. 
469.713	Because here's what we know:
473.341	What we know is that stereotypes are holding women 
473.341	back from leadership roles all over the world.
478.053	"It's so striking. ""Lean In"" is very global, "
478.053	I've been all over the world,
480.656	talking about it, and -- cultures are so different.
483.051	Even within our own country, to Japan, 
483.051	to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,
488.044	they're so different. Except for one thing: gender.
492.231	All over the world, no matter what our cultures are,
494.151	we think men should be strong, 
494.151	assertive, aggressive, have voice;
498.481	we think women should speak 
498.481	when spoken to, help others.
502.998	Now we have, all over the world,
506.703	"women are called ""bossy."" "
506.703	"There is a word for ""bossy,"""
510.496	for little girls, in every language there's one.
512.814	It's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,
515.024	because if a little boy leads, 
515.024	there's no negative word for it,
517.952	it's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.
522.741	Now I know there aren't a lot of 
522.741	men here, but bear with me.
524.736	If you're a man, you'll have 
524.736	to represent your gender.
527.27	Please raise your hand if you've been 
527.27	told you're too aggressive at work.
532.834	(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about 
532.834	five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.
538.718	If you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've 
538.718	ever been told you're too aggressive at work.
545.281	(Laughter) That is what audiences have 
545.281	said in every country in the world,
548.894	and it's deeply supported by the data.
551.76	Now, do we think women are more 
551.76	aggressive than men? Of course not.
556.099	It's just that we judge them through a different lens,
558.449	and a lot of the character traits that you must 
558.449	exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,
563.3	are ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,
566.164	and in a woman, she's bossy.
567.786	And the good news about this is that we 
567.786	can change this by acknowledging it.
571.872	One of the happiest moments 
571.872	I had in this whole journey is,
574.262	after the book came out, I stood on a stage 
574.262	with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.
579.195	He read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he 
579.195	invited me in front of his whole management team,
582.854	men and women, and he said, I thought we 
582.854	were good at this. I thought I was good at this.
586.246	And then I read this book, and I 
586.246	realized that we -- my company --
591.312	we have called all of our 
591.312	senior women too aggressive,
593.296	and I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.
595.745	And I want you to know we're 
595.745	never going to do it again.
599.49	PM: Can we send that to a lot of other 
599.49	people that we know? (Applause)
602.874	SS: And so John is doing that because 
602.874	he believes it's good for his company,
606.775	and so this kind of acknowledgement 
606.775	of these biases can change it.
609.829	And so next time you all see 
609.829	"someone call a little girl ""bossy,"""
613.477	you walk right up to that person, 
613.477	big smile, and you say,
616.025	"""That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has "
616.025	"executive leadership skills."" (Laughter)"
622.56	PM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter. 
622.56	SS: Absolutely.
625.765	PM: And you did focus in the book -- and 
625.765	the reason, as you said, in writing it,
628.834	was to create a dialogue about this.
630.759	I mean, let's just put it out there, 
630.759	face the fact that women are --
634.273	in a time when we have more open 
634.273	doors, and more opportunities --
637.948	are still not getting to the leadership positions.
641.248	So in the months that have come since the book,
643.446	"in which ""Lean In"" focused on that and said,"
646.004	here are some of the challenges that remain, and 
646.004	many of them we have to own within ourselves
650.304	and look at ourselves. What has changed?
653.066	Have you seen changes?
655.152	SS: Well, there's certainly more 
655.152	dialogue, which is great.
657.415	But what really matters to me, 
657.415	and I think all of us, is action.
660.463	So everywhere I go, CEOs, 
660.463	they're mostly men, say to me,
664.247	you're costing me so much money
666.866	because all the women want to 
666.866	be paid as much as the men.
670.038	And to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)
674.319	At all. I mean, the women should 
674.319	be paid as much as the men.
677.557	Everywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.
680.694	Everywhere I go, women say they're getting 
680.694	better relationships with their spouses,
684.691	asking for more help at home, asking for the 
684.691	promotions they should be getting at work,
688.671	and importantly, believing it 
688.671	themselves. Even little things.
691.669	One of the governors of one of the states told me 
691.669	that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,
695.701	literally sitting on the side 
695.701	of the room, which they are,
697.93	and now he made a rule that all the women 
697.93	on his staff need to sit at the table.
703.417	The foundation I started along 
703.417	"with the book ""Lean In"""
705.573	helps women, or men, start circles -- small groups,
708.925	it can be 10, it can be however many 
708.925	you want, which meet once a month.
712.174	I would have hoped that by now, we'd have 
712.174	about 500 circles. That would've been great.
715.495	You know, 500 times roughly 10.
718.417	There are over 12,000 circles 
718.417	in 50 countries in the world.
721.647	PM: Wow, that's amazing.
723.207	SS: And these are people who 
723.207	are meeting every single month.
726.282	I met one of them, I was in Beijing.
728.621	A group of women, they're all about 29 or 30, 
728.621	they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,
733.321	several of them grew up in very poor, rural China.
737.314	These women are 29, they are told by 
737.314	"their society that they are ""left over,"""
743.122	because they are not yet married,
745.135	and the process of coming together 
745.135	once a month at a meeting
747.918	is helping them define who they are for themselves.
751.218	What they want in their careers. The 
751.218	kind of partners they want, if at all.
755.554	I looked at them, we went around 
755.554	and introduced ourselves,
757.541	and they all said their names 
757.541	and where they're from,
759.38	and I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg, 
759.38	and this was my dream.
762.86	And I kind of just started crying.
764.7	Right, which, I admit, I do. Right? 
764.7	I've talked about it before.
769.457	But the fact that a woman so far away out in 
769.457	the world, who grew up in a rural village,
774.027	who's being told to marry someone 
774.027	she doesn't want to marry,
778.138	can now go meet once a month with 
778.138	a group of people and refuse that,
781.075	and find life on her own terms.
784.069	That's the kind of change we have to hope for.
786.012	PM: Have you been surprised by 
786.012	the global nature of the message?
789.559	Because I think when the book first 
789.559	came out, many people thought,
792.864	well, this is a really important handbook 
792.864	for young women on their way up.
796.616	They need to look at this, anticipate 
796.616	the barriers, and recognize them,
800.93	put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,
803.58	but that it's really for women who are that. 
803.58	Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.
808.699	And yet the book is being read, as you 
808.699	say, in rural and developing countries.
813.082	What part of that has surprised you, and 
813.082	perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?
820.359	SS: The book is about self-confidence, 
820.359	and about equality.
823.515	And it turns out, everywhere in the world, 
823.515	women need more self-confidence,
827.415	because the world tells us we're not equal to men.
829.636	Everywhere in the world, we live in 
829.636	"a world where the men get ""and,"""
833.049	"and women get ""or."""
834.36	I've never met a man who's been 
834.36	asked how he does it all. (Laughter)
838.034	Again, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:
841.247	Please raise your hand if you've 
841.247	been asked, how do you do it all?
844.279	(Laughter)
845.728	Men only.
847.159	Women, women. Please raise your hand 
847.159	if you've been asked how you do it all?
852.037	We assume men can do it all, 
852.037	slash -- have jobs and children.
858.396	We assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,
860.174	because the great majority of women everywhere 
860.174	in the world, including the United States,
863.75	work full time and have children.
866.046	And I think people don't fully understand 
866.046	how broad the message is.
871.218	There is a circle that's been started 
871.218	for rescued sex workers in Miami.
875.58	"They're using ""Lean In"" to help "
875.58	people make the transition
880.931	back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing 
880.931	them from their pimps, and using it.
885.672	There are dress-for-success groups 
885.672	in Texas which are using the book,
889.421	for women who have never been to college.
891.08	And we know there are groups 
891.08	all the way to Ethiopia.
895.008	And so these messages of equality -- of how women 
895.008	are told they can't have what men can have --
900.891	how we assume that leadership is for men, 
900.891	how we assume that voice is for men,
905.124	these affect all of us, and I 
905.124	think they are very universal.
908.262	And it's part of what TEDWomen does.
909.923	It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,
913.706	which is more women, more voice, more equality.
917.954	PM: If you were invited now to 
917.954	make another TEDWomen talk,
924.735	what would you say that is a result 
924.735	of this experience, for you personally,
930.029	and what you've learned about women, and men,
932.648	as you've made this journey?
936.334	SS: I think I would say -- I tried to say this strongly,
939.432	but I think I can say it more strongly --
941.886	I want to say that the status quo is not enough.
945.29	That it's not good enough, that it's 
945.29	not changing quickly enough.
948.27	Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book, 
948.27	another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.
953.397	And you know what we found?
955.186	No movement in the wage gap 
955.186	for women in the United States.
957.963	Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.
960.509	If you are a black woman, 64 cents.
962.543	If you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.
965.051	Do you know when the last 
965.051	time those numbers went up?
971.786	We are stagnating, we are 
971.786	stagnating in so many ways.
974.67	And I think we are not really being honest about that,
977.478	for so many reasons. It's so 
977.478	hard to talk about gender.
980.724	"We shy away from the word ""feminist,"" "
980.724	a word I really think we need to embrace.
984.541	We have to get rid of the 
984.541	word bossy and bring back --
987.733	(Applause)
990.893	I think I would say in a louder voice, 
990.893	"we need to get rid of the word ""bossy"""
995.215	"and bring back the word ""feminist,"" "
995.215	because we need it.
998.276	(Applause)
999.761	PM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.
1002.803	SS: A lot more leaning in.
1004.004	PM: Thank you, Sheryl.
1005.234	Thanks for leaning in and saying yes.
1006.468	SS: Thank you.
1008.63	(Applause)
