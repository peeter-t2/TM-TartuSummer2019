12.667	I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,
15.866	and I'll explain how
15.866	these identities come together.
19.068	It started four years ago,
20.764	when a friend and I opened
20.764	our first Ramadan fast
23.42	at one of the busiest mosques
23.42	in New York City.
26.045	Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps
26.045	were swarming the streets.
29.943	It was an FBI agent's wet dream.
29.943	(Laughter)
33.548	But being a part of this community,
33.548	we knew how welcoming this space was.
37.046	For years, I'd seen photos 
37.046	of this space being documented
40.363	as a lifeless and cold monolith,
42.47	much like the stereotypical image
42.47	painted of the American Muslim experience.
46.181	Frustrated by this myopic view,
48.474	my friend and I had this crazy idea:
50.876	Let's break our fast
50.876	at a different mosque in a different state
53.877	each night of Ramadan
55.302	and share those stories on a blog.
57.454	"We called it ""30 Mosques in 30 Days,"""
59.734	and we drove to all the 50 states
61.54	and shared stories from over 100
61.54	vastly different Muslim communities,
64.905	ranging from the Cambodian refugees
64.905	in the L.A. projects
68.234	to the black Sufis living
68.234	in the woods of South Carolina.
71.426	What emerged was a beautiful
71.426	and complicated portrait of America.
74.795	The media coverage
74.795	forced local journalists
76.82	to revisit their Muslim communities,
78.557	but what was really exciting
78.557	was seeing people from around the world
82.177	being inspired to take
82.177	their own 30-mosque journey.
85.184	There were even these two NFL athletes
87.001	who took a sabbatical
87.001	from the league to do so.
89.277	And as 30 Mosques
89.277	was blossoming around the world,
92.614	I was actually stuck in Pakistan
92.614	working on a film.
95.273	My codirector, Omar, and I were at 
95.273	a breaking point with many of our friends
98.894	on how to position the film.
100.559	"The movie is called ""These Birds Walk,"""
102.646	and it is about wayward street kids
104.406	who are struggling to find
104.406	some semblance of family.
107.242	We focus on the complexities
107.242	of youth and family discord,
110.71	but our friends kept on nudging us
110.71	to comment on drones and target killings
114.495	"to make the film ""more relevant,"""
117.304	essentially reducing these people
117.304	who have entrusted us with their stories
120.81	into sociopolitical symbols.
122.777	Of course, we didn't listen to them,
124.553	and instead, we championed
124.553	the tender gestures of love
127.973	and headlong flashes of youth.
130.295	The agenda behind our cinematic 
130.295	immersion was only empathy,
133.374	an emotion that's largely 
133.374	deficient from films
135.958	that come from our region of the world.
139.233	"And as ""These Birds Walk"" played at film "
139.233	festivals and theaters internationally,
143.46	I finally had my feet
143.46	planted at home in New York,
145.943	and with all the extra time
145.943	and still no real money,
149.505	my wife tasked me to cook more for us.
153.19	And whenever I'd go to the local butcher
153.19	to purchase some halal meat,
156.577	something felt off.
157.946	For those that don't know,
157.946	halal is a term used for meat
161.313	that is raised and slaughtered humanely
161.313	following very strict Islamic guidelines.
165.855	Unfortunately, the majority
165.855	of halal meat in America
169.209	doesn't rise to the standard
169.209	that my faith calls for.
172.151	The more I learned
172.151	about these unethical practices,
174.852	the more violated I felt,
176.9	particularly because businesses
176.9	from my own community
180.092	were the ones taking advantage
180.092	of my orthodoxy.
183.211	So, with emotions running high,
183.211	and absolutely no experience in butchery,
187.225	some friends and I opened a meat store
189.474	in the heart of the
189.474	East Village fashion district.
192.034	(Laughter)
193.394	We call it Honest Chops,
195.234	and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing
195.234	organic, humanely raised animals,
198.947	and by making it accessible and affordable
198.947	to working-class families.
202.668	There's really nothing like it in America.
204.817	The unbelievable part is actually
204.817	that 90 percent of our in-store customers
208.939	are not even Muslim.
210.479	For many, it is their first time 
210.479	interacting with Islam
213.206	on such an intimate level.
215.601	So all these disparate projects --
215.601	(Laughter) --
220.347	are the result of a restlessness.
222.522	They are a visceral response
222.522	to the businesses and curators
226.106	who work hard to oversimplify
226.106	my beliefs and my community,
229.625	and the only way to beat their machine
229.625	is to play by different rules.
233.79	We must fight with an inventive approach.
235.976	With the trust, with the access,
235.976	with the love that only we can bring,
240.317	we must unapologetically
240.317	reclaim our beliefs
242.777	in every moving image,
242.777	in every cut of meat,
245.419	because if we whitewash our stories
245.419	for the sake of mass appeal,
249.565	not only will we fail,
251.074	but we will be trumped by those
251.074	with more money and more resources
254.401	to tell our stories.
256.211	But the call for creative courage
256.211	is not for novelty or relevance.
260.914	It is simply because our communities
260.914	are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.
265.767	They demand us to find uncompromising ways
265.767	to be acknowledged and respected.
272.603	Thank you.
274.358	(Applause)
