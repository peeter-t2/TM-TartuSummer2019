16.86	So, I'll start with this: a couple
16.86	years ago, an event planner called me
20.345	because I was going
20.345	to do a speaking event.
22.418	And she called, and she said,
24.132	"""I'm really struggling with how"
24.132	"to write about you on the little flyer."""
27.728	And I thought,
27.728	"""Well, what's the struggle?"""
30.488	"And she said, ""Well, I saw you speak,"
32.416	and I'm going to call you
32.416	a researcher, I think,
34.925	but I'm afraid if I call you
34.925	a researcher, no one will come,
37.837	because they'll think
37.837	"you're boring and irrelevant."""
40.32	(Laughter)
41.345	"And I was like, ""Okay."""
42.945	"And she said, ""But the thing"
42.945	I liked about your talk
45.447	is you're a storyteller.
46.687	So I think what I'll do
46.687	"is just call you a storyteller."""
49.99	And of course, the academic,
49.99	insecure part of me
52.99	"was like, ""You're going"
52.99	"to call me a what?"""
55.324	"And she said, ""I'm going"
55.324	"to call you a storyteller."""
57.896	"And I was like, ""Why not 'magic pixie'?"""
60.769	(Laughter)
63.648	"I was like, ""Let me think"
63.648	"about this for a second."""
67.291	I tried to call deep on my courage.
69.854	And I thought, you know,
69.854	I am a storyteller.
72.99	I'm a qualitative researcher.
74.418	I collect stories; that's what I do.
76.656	And maybe stories
76.656	are just data with a soul.
79.585	And maybe I'm just a storyteller.
81.99	"And so I said, ""You know what?"
83.673	Why don't you just say
83.673	"I'm a researcher-storyteller."""
86.338	"And she went, ""Ha ha."
86.338	"There's no such thing."""
89.99	(Laughter)
91.697	So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
91.697	and I'm going to talk to you today --
95.698	we're talking about
95.698	expanding perception --
97.771	and so I want to talk to you
97.771	and tell some stories
100.177	about a piece of my research
100.177	that fundamentally expanded my perception
105.36	and really actually changed
105.36	the way that I live and love
108.273	and work and parent.
110.093	And this is where my story starts.
112.99	When I was a young researcher,
112.99	doctoral student,
115.697	my first year, I had
115.697	a research professor who said to us,
119.698	"""Here's the thing, if you cannot"
119.698	"measure it, it does not exist."""
125.374	And I thought he was just
125.374	sweet-talking me.
128.339	"I was like, ""Really?"""
128.339	"and he was like, ""Absolutely."""
130.8	And so you have to understand
133.077	that I have a bachelor's
133.077	and a master's in social work,
135.681	and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
135.681	so my entire academic career
139.079	was surrounded by people who kind of
139.079	"believed in the ""life's messy, love it."""
145.474	"And I'm more of the, ""life's messy,"
145.474	clean it up, organize it
150.926	"and put it into a bento box."""
152.727	(Laughter)
155.02	And so to think that I had found my way,
155.02	to found a career that takes me --
160.355	really, one of the big sayings
160.355	in social work is,
163.712	"""Lean into the discomfort of the work."""
166.537	And I'm like, knock discomfort
166.537	upside the head
169.093	and move it over and get all A's.
171.395	That was my mantra.
174.99	So I was very excited about this.
176.99	And so I thought, you know what,
176.99	this is the career for me,
179.99	because I am interested
179.99	in some messy topics.
182.99	But I want to be able
182.99	to make them not messy.
185.385	I want to understand them.
186.731	I want to hack into these things
186.731	that I know are important
190.332	and lay the code out for everyone to see.
192.99	So where I started was with connection.
195.673	Because, by the time
195.673	you're a social worker for 10 years,
199.109	what you realize is that connection
199.109	is why we're here.
203.84	It's what gives purpose
203.84	and meaning to our lives.
207.076	This is what it's all about.
208.886	It doesn't matter whether
208.886	you talk to people
211.007	who work in social justice,
211.007	mental health and abuse and neglect,
214.123	what we know is that connection,
214.123	the ability to feel connected, is --
219.948	neurobiologically
219.948	that's how we're wired --
221.99	it's why we're here.
223.393	So I thought, you know what,
223.393	I'm going to start with connection.
227.067	Well, you know that situation
228.988	where you get an evaluation
228.988	from your boss,
231.52	and she tells you 37 things
231.52	that you do really awesome,
234.33	"and one ""opportunity for growth?"""
236.728	(Laughter)
239.196	And all you can think about
239.196	is that opportunity for growth, right?
242.688	Well, apparently this is the way
242.688	my work went as well,
245.41	because, when you ask people about love,
245.41	they tell you about heartbreak.
250.411	When you ask people about belonging,
253.069	they'll tell you their most excruciating
253.069	experiences of being excluded.
257.045	And when you ask people about connection,
259.57	the stories they told me
259.57	were about disconnection.
263.118	So very quickly -- really about six weeks
263.118	into this research --
266.167	I ran into this unnamed thing
266.167	that absolutely unraveled connection
272.213	in a way that I didn't understand
272.213	or had never seen.
275.109	And so I pulled back out of the research
277.11	and thought, I need
277.11	to figure out what this is.
279.364	And it turned out to be shame.
283.212	And shame is really easily understood
283.212	as the fear of disconnection:
287.213	Is there something about me that,
287.213	if other people know it or see it,
291.793	that I won't be worthy of connection?
295.593	The things I can tell you about it:
297.299	It's universal; we all have it.
298.99	The only people who don't experience shame
301.014	have no capacity for human
301.014	empathy or connection.
303.372	No one wants to talk about it,
304.99	and the less you talk about it,
304.99	the more you have it.
309.005	What underpinned this shame,
309.005	"this ""I'm not good enough,"" --"
314.195	which, we all know that feeling:
315.823	"""I'm not blank enough."
315.823	I'm not thin enough,
317.896	rich enough, beautiful enough,
317.896	"smart enough, promoted enough."""
321.174	The thing that underpinned this
321.174	was excruciating vulnerability.
326.862	This idea of, in order
326.862	for connection to happen,
330.99	we have to allow ourselves
330.99	to be seen, really seen.
336.061	And you know how I feel
336.061	about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.
339.283	And so I thought, this is my chance
339.283	to beat it back with my measuring stick.
343.805	I'm going in, I'm going
343.805	to figure this stuff out,
346.52	I'm going to spend a year,
346.52	I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,
349.854	I'm going to understand
349.854	how vulnerability works,
352.156	and I'm going to outsmart it.
354.64	So I was ready, and I was really excited.
360.239	As you know,
360.239	it's not going to turn out well.
362.406	(Laughter)
364.943	You know this.
366.561	So, I could tell you a lot about shame,
368.474	but I'd have to borrow
368.474	everyone else's time.
370.595	But here's what I can tell you
370.595	that it boils down to --
373.476	and this may be one of the most important
373.476	things that I've ever learned
376.882	in the decade of doing this research.
380.068	My one year turned into six years:
384.284	Thousands of stories, hundreds
384.284	of long interviews, focus groups.
388.99	At one point, people were
388.99	sending me journal pages
391.395	and sending me their stories --
393.256	thousands of pieces of data in six years.
397.272	And I kind of got a handle on it.
398.99	I kind of understood, this is
398.99	what shame is, this is how it works.
403.452	I wrote a book, I published a theory,
403.452	but something was not okay --
409.723	and what it was is that, if I roughly
409.723	took the people I interviewed
413.903	and divided them into people who really
413.903	have a sense of worthiness --
420.499	that's what this comes down to,
420.499	a sense of worthiness --
423.285	they have a strong sense
423.285	of love and belonging --
426.531	and folks who struggle for it,
428.206	and folks who are always wondering
428.206	if they're good enough.
431.33	There was only one variable that separated
433.593	the people who have a strong sense
433.593	of love and belonging
436.357	and the people who really struggle for it.
438.64	And that was, the people who have
438.64	a strong sense of love and belonging
442.382	believe they're worthy
442.382	of love and belonging.
445.704	That's it.
447.505	They believe they're worthy.
450.736	And to me, the hard part of the one thing
450.736	that keeps us out of connection
456.578	is our fear that we're not
456.578	worthy of connection,
459.817	was something that,
459.817	personally and professionally,
462.244	I felt like I needed to understand better.
464.807	So what I did is I took
464.807	all of the interviews
469.808	where I saw worthiness,
469.808	where I saw people living that way,
472.65	and just looked at those.
475.314	What do these people have in common?
477.386	I have a slight office supply addiction,
477.386	but that's another talk.
482.053	So I had a manila folder,
482.053	and I had a Sharpie,
485.554	and I was like, what am I going
485.554	to call this research?
488.198	And the first words that came
488.198	"to my mind were ""whole-hearted."""
491.807	These are whole-hearted people,
491.807	living from this deep sense of worthiness.
495.347	So I wrote at the top
495.347	of the manila folder,
498.227	and I started looking at the data.
500.18	In fact, I did it first in a four-day,
500.18	very intensive data analysis,
506.197	where I went back, pulled the interviews,
506.197	the stories, pulled the incidents.
509.798	What's the theme? What's the pattern?
512.37	My husband left town with the kids
515.371	because I always go into this
515.371	Jackson Pollock crazy thing,
518.372	where I'm just writing
518.372	and in my researcher mode.
523.625	And so here's what I found.
528.114	What they had in common
528.114	was a sense of courage.
531.624	And I want to separate courage
531.624	and bravery for you for a minute.
534.745	Courage, the original
534.745	definition of courage,
537.21	when it first came
537.21	into the English language --
539.473	"it's from the Latin word ""cor,"""
539.473	"meaning ""heart"" --"
541.85	and the original definition was to tell
541.85	the story of who you are
544.885	with your whole heart.
547.059	And so these folks had, very simply,
547.059	the courage to be imperfect.
553.632	They had the compassion to be kind
553.632	to themselves first and then to others,
558.633	because, as it turns out,
559.856	we can't practice compassion
559.856	with other people
562.114	if we can't treat ourselves kindly.
564.259	And the last was they had connection,
564.259	and -- this was the hard part --
568.68	as a result of authenticity,
571.681	they were willing to let go
571.681	of who they thought they should be
574.99	in order to be who they were,
574.99	which you have to absolutely do that
579.618	for connection.
583.323	The other thing that they had
583.323	in common was this:
590.91	They fully embraced vulnerability.
595.679	They believed that what made them
595.679	vulnerable made them beautiful.
606.141	They didn't talk about vulnerability
606.141	being comfortable,
609.99	nor did they really talk
609.99	about it being excruciating --
612.84	as I had heard it earlier
612.84	in the shame interviewing.
615.342	They just talked about it being necessary.
618.633	They talked about the willingness
618.633	"to say, ""I love you"" first ..."
624.378	the willingness to do something
624.378	where there are no guarantees ...
631.283	the willingness to breathe
631.283	through waiting for the doctor to call
635.642	after your mammogram.
638.631	They're willing to invest
638.631	in a relationship
641.92	that may or may not work out.
644.465	They thought this was fundamental.
647.442	I personally thought it was betrayal.
650.847	I could not believe I had pledged
650.847	allegiance to research, where our job --
655.467	you know, the definition of research
655.467	is to control and predict,
659.555	to study phenomena for the explicit
659.555	reason to control and predict.
664.222	And now my mission to control and predict
668.612	had turned up the answer
668.612	that the way to live is with vulnerability
672.205	and to stop controlling and predicting.
674.327	This led to a little breakdown --
676.902	(Laughter)
681.99	-- which actually looked more like this.
684.99	(Laughter)
686.507	And it did.
688.508	I call it a breakdown; my therapist
688.508	calls it a spiritual awakening.
691.712	(Laughter)
692.97	A spiritual awakening
692.97	sounds better than breakdown,
695.411	but I assure you, it was a breakdown.
697.212	And I had to put my data away
697.212	and go find a therapist.
700.14	Let me tell you something:
700.14	you know who you are
702.395	when you call your friends and say,
702.395	"""I think I need to see somebody."
705.659	"Do you have any recommendations?"""
707.489	Because about five
707.489	of my friends were like,
709.562	"""Wooo, I wouldn't want"
709.562	"to be your therapist."""
711.73	(Laughter)
714.492	"I was like, ""What does that mean?"""
716.493	And they're like,
716.493	"""I'm just saying, you know."
719.724	"Don't bring your measuring stick."""
721.725	(Laughter)
724.485	"I was like, ""Okay."""
726.545	So I found a therapist.
728.403	My first meeting with her, Diana --
732.109	I brought in my list of the way
732.109	the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
736.427	"And she said, ""How are you?"""
738.26	"And I said, ""I'm great. I'm okay."""
741.879	"She said, ""What's going on?"""
743.427	And this is a therapist
743.427	who sees therapists,
746.07	because we have to go to those,
746.07	because their B.S. meters are good.
751.307	(Laughter)
753.736	"And so I said, ""Here's the thing,"
753.736	"I'm struggling."""
757.593	"And she said, ""What's the struggle?"""
760.442	"And I said, ""Well, I have"
760.442	a vulnerability issue.
762.727	And I know that vulnerability
762.727	is the core of shame and fear
768.106	and our struggle for worthiness,
769.727	but it appears that it's also
769.727	the birthplace of joy, of creativity,
775.427	of belonging, of love.
777.776	And I think I have a problem,
777.776	"and I need some help."""
783.236	"And I said, ""But here's the thing:"
783.236	"no family stuff, no childhood shit."""
788.427	(Laughter)
790.427	"""I just need some strategies."""
793.427	(Laughter)
797.427	(Applause)
801.036	Thank you.
804.283	So she goes like this.
807.427	(Laughter)
809.807	"And then I said, ""It's bad, right?"""
812.427	"And she said, ""It's neither good nor bad."""
815.427	(Laughter)
817.284	"""It just is what it is."""
819.664	"And I said, ""Oh my God,"
819.664	"this is going to suck."""
822.427	(Laughter)
825.593	And it did, and it didn't.
827.871	And it took about a year.
829.958	And you know how there are people
831.998	that, when they realize that vulnerability
831.998	and tenderness are important,
836.046	that they surrender and walk into it.
839.231	A: that's not me,
841.215	and B: I don't even hang out
841.215	with people like that.
843.636	(Laughter)
846.427	For me, it was a yearlong street fight.
849.752	It was a slugfest.
851.339	Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
853.593	I lost the fight,
856.704	but probably won my life back.
858.727	And so then I went back into the research
860.727	and spent the next couple of years
862.427	really trying to understand
862.427	what they, the whole-hearted,
865.427	what choices they were making,
865.427	and what we are doing with vulnerability.
871.427	Why do we struggle with it so much?
873.791	Am I alone in struggling
873.791	with vulnerability?
877.19	No.
878.427	So this is what I learned.
881.959	We numb vulnerability --
884.68	when we're waiting for the call.
886.291	It was funny, I sent something out
886.291	on Twitter and on Facebook
889.204	"that says, ""How would you"
889.204	define vulnerability?
891.502	"What makes you feel vulnerable?"""
893.074	And within an hour and a half,
893.074	I had 150 responses.
895.822	Because I wanted to know what's out there.
901.204	Having to ask my husband for help
901.204	because I'm sick, and we're newly married;
906.251	initiating sex with my husband;
908.282	initiating sex with my wife;
911.02	being turned down; asking someone out;
914.022	waiting for the doctor to call back;
916.085	getting laid off; laying off people.
918.451	This is the world we live in.
920.962	We live in a vulnerable world.
923.954	And one of the ways we deal
923.954	with it is we numb vulnerability.
927.688	And I think there's evidence --
929.427	and it's not the only reason
929.427	this evidence exists,
931.832	but I think it's a huge cause --
933.965	We are the most in-debt ...
938.538	obese ...
940.91	addicted and medicated
940.91	adult cohort in U.S. history.
948.315	The problem is -- and I learned this
948.315	from the research --
951.609	that you cannot selectively numb emotion.
955.291	You can't say, here's the bad stuff.
958.427	Here's vulnerability,
958.427	here's grief, here's shame,
960.827	here's fear, here's disappointment.
962.527	I don't want to feel these.
964.427	I'm going to have a couple of beers
964.427	and a banana nut muffin.
967.333	(Laughter)
970.043	I don't want to feel these.
971.936	And I know that's knowing laughter.
973.936	I hack into your lives for a living.
976.427	God.
978.427	(Laughter)
980.998	You can't numb those hard feelings
983.78	without numbing
983.78	the other affects, our emotions.
986.438	You cannot selectively numb.
987.914	So when we numb those,
990.545	we numb joy,
993.092	we numb gratitude,
994.427	we numb happiness.
997.148	And then, we are miserable,
1000.295	and we are looking
1000.295	for purpose and meaning,
1002.328	and then we feel vulnerable,
1003.784	so then we have a couple of beers
1003.784	and a banana nut muffin.
1006.616	And it becomes this dangerous cycle.
1011.087	One of the things that I think
1011.087	we need to think about
1014.244	is why and how we numb.
1016.928	And it doesn't just have to be addiction.
1020.477	The other thing we do is we make
1020.477	everything that's uncertain certain.
1025.427	Religion has gone from a belief
1025.427	in faith and mystery to certainty.
1030.537	"""I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."""
1034.187	That's it.
1036.611	Just certain.
1038.34	The more afraid we are,
1038.34	the more vulnerable we are,
1040.78	the more afraid we are.
1042.189	This is what politics looks like today.
1044.22	There's no discourse anymore.
1045.919	There's no conversation.
1047.807	There's just blame.
1049.055	You know how blame
1049.055	is described in the research?
1052.553	A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
1057.616	We perfect.
1058.83	If there's anyone who wants their life
1058.83	to look like this, it would be me,
1062.632	but it doesn't work.
1063.883	Because what we do is we take fat
1063.883	from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
1067.527	(Laughter)
1070.99	Which just, I hope in 100 years,
1070.99	"people will look back and go, ""Wow."""
1074.427	(Laughter)
1076.974	And we perfect,
1076.974	most dangerously, our children.
1080.427	Let me tell you what we think
1080.427	about children.
1082.594	They're hardwired for struggle
1082.594	when they get here.
1085.427	And when you hold those perfect
1085.427	little babies in your hand,
1088.333	our job is not to say,
1088.333	"""Look at her, she's perfect."
1091.315	My job is just to keep her perfect --
1093.235	make sure she makes the tennis team
1093.235	"by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."""
1096.666	That's not our job.
1097.927	Our job is to look and say,
1099.56	"""You know what? You're imperfect,"
1099.56	and you're wired for struggle,
1102.6	"but you are worthy of love and belonging."""
1105.501	That's our job.
1107.104	Show me a generation
1107.104	of kids raised like that,
1109.358	and we'll end the problems,
1109.358	I think, that we see today.
1111.983	We pretend that what we do
1111.983	doesn't have an effect on people.
1118.871	We do that in our personal lives.
1120.529	We do that corporate --
1121.776	whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...
1125.386	a recall.
1126.57	We pretend like what we're doing
1128.571	doesn't have a huge impact
1128.571	on other people.
1131.427	I would say to companies,
1131.427	this is not our first rodeo, people.
1135.769	We just need you to be authentic
1135.769	and real and say ...
1139.919	"""We're sorry. We'll fix it."""
1145.535	But there's another way,
1145.535	and I'll leave you with this.
1148.331	This is what I have found:
1149.736	To let ourselves be seen,
1149.736	deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...
1156.891	to love with our whole hearts,
1156.891	even though there's no guarantee --
1161.304	and that's really hard,
1162.582	and I can tell you as a parent,
1162.582	that's excruciatingly difficult --
1168.495	to practice gratitude and joy
1168.495	in those moments of terror,
1172.701	when we're wondering,
1172.701	"""Can I love you this much?"
1175.038	Can I believe in this this passionately?
1177.248	"Can I be this fierce about this?"""
1179.202	just to be able to stop and, instead of
1179.202	catastrophizing what might happen,
1182.803	"to say, ""I'm just so grateful,"
1184.804	because to feel this vulnerable
1184.804	"means I'm alive."""
1188.748	And the last, which I think
1188.748	is probably the most important,
1192.434	is to believe that we're enough.
1194.664	Because when we work from a place,
1194.664	"I believe, that says, ""I'm enough"" ..."
1200.743	then we stop screaming
1200.743	and start listening,
1204.735	we're kinder and gentler
1204.735	to the people around us,
1207.086	and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.
1210.125	That's all I have. Thank you.
1211.627	(Applause)
