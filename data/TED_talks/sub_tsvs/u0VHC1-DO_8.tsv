16.26	I'm an ecologist,
18.26	mostly a coral reef ecologist.
20.26	I started out in Chesapeake Bay
22.26	and went diving in the winter
24.26	and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
27.26	And it was really a lot of fun
30.26	for about 10 years.
32.26	I mean, somebody pays you
34.26	to go around and travel
36.26	and look at some of the most
38.26	beautiful places on the planet.
40.26	And that was what I did.
43.26	And I ended up in Jamaica,
45.26	in the West Indies,
47.26	where the coral reefs were really
49.26	among the most extraordinary, structurally,
51.26	that I ever saw in my life.
54.26	And this picture here,
56.26	it's really interesting, it shows two things:
58.26	First of all, it's in black and white
60.26	because the water was so clear
62.26	and you could see so far,
64.26	and film was so slow
66.26	in the 1960s and early 70s,
68.26	you took pictures in black and white.
70.26	The other thing it shows you
72.26	is that, although there's this beautiful
74.26	forest of coral,
76.26	there are no fish in that picture.
79.26	Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica
82.26	were the most studied coral reefs
84.26	in the world for 20 years.
86.26	We were the best and the brightest.
88.26	People came to study our reefs from Australia,
91.26	which is sort of funny
93.26	because now we go to theirs.
95.26	And the view of scientists
98.26	about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,
101.26	was based on these reefs
103.26	without any fish.
105.26	Then, in 1980,
107.26	there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.
110.26	I put half the lab
112.26	up in my house.
114.26	The wind blew very strong.
116.26	The waves were 25
119.26	to 50 feet high.
121.26	And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,
124.26	"and we thought, ""Well, we're real smart."
126.26	We know that hurricanes
128.26	"have always happened in the past."""
130.26	And we published a paper in Science,
132.26	the first time that anybody ever
134.26	described the destruction
136.26	on a coral reef by a major hurricane.
139.26	And we predicted what would happen,
141.26	and we got it all wrong.
143.26	And the reason was
145.26	because of overfishing,
148.26	and the fact that a last common grazer,
151.26	a sea urchin, died.
154.26	And within a few months
156.26	after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.
159.26	And that is the same reef;
161.26	that's the same reef 15 years ago;
163.26	that's the same reef today.
166.26	The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
169.26	have a few percent live coral cover
172.26	and a lot of seaweed and slime.
174.26	And that's more or less the story
176.26	of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,
178.26	and increasingly, tragically,
181.26	the coral reefs worldwide.
183.26	Now, that's my little, depressing story.
186.26	All of us in our 60s and 70s
189.26	have comparable depressing stories.
192.26	There are tens of thousands
194.26	of those stories out there,
196.26	and it's really hard to conjure up
198.26	much of a sense of well-being,
200.26	because it just keeps getting worse.
202.26	And the reason it keeps getting worse
204.26	is that after a natural catastrophe,
207.26	like a hurricane,
211.26	it used to be that there was
213.26	some kind of successional sequence of recovery,
216.26	but what's going on now is that
219.26	overfishing and pollution and climate change
222.26	are all interacting
224.26	in a way that prevents that.
226.26	And so I'm going to sort of go through
228.26	and talk about those three
230.26	kinds of things.
232.26	We hear a lot about
234.26	the collapse of cod.
236.26	It's difficult to imagine that
238.26	two, or some historians would say three world wars
242.26	were fought during the colonial era
244.26	for the control of cod.
246.26	Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
249.26	It fed the slaves
251.26	brought to the Antilles,
254.26	"the song ""Jamaica Farewell"" --"
256.26	"""Ackee rice salt fish are nice"" --"
258.26	is an emblem of the importance
261.26	of salt cod from northeastern Canada.
264.26	It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
270.26	And that was the beginning
272.26	of a kind of serial depletion
274.26	from bigger and tastier species
276.26	to smaller and not-so-tasty species,
279.26	from species that were near to home
281.26	to species that were all around the world,
284.26	and what have you.
286.26	It's a little hard to understand that,
288.26	because you can go to a Costco in the United States
291.26	and buy cheap fish.
293.26	You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,
295.26	but it's still cheap,
297.26	and everybody thinks it's okay.
299.26	It's hard to communicate this,
301.26	and one way that I think is really interesting
304.26	is to talk about sport fish,
307.26	because people like to go out and catch fish.
310.26	It's one of those things.
312.26	This picture here shows the trophy fish,
315.26	the biggest fish caught
317.26	by people who pay a lot of money
319.26	to get on a boat,
321.26	go to a place off of Key West in Florida,
324.26	drink a lot of beer,
326.26	throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,
328.26	come back with the biggest and the best fish,
331.26	and the champion trophy fish
333.26	are put on this board, where people take a picture,
336.26	and this guy is obviously
338.26	really excited about that fish.
341.26	Well, that's what it's like now,
343.26	but this is what it was like in the 1950s
345.26	from the same boat in the same place
348.26	on the same board on the same dock.
351.26	The trophy fish
353.26	were so big
355.26	that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
358.26	And the average size trophy fish
360.26	weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,
363.26	and if you wanted to go out and kill something,
365.26	you could pretty much count on
367.26	being able to catch one of those fish.
369.26	And they tasted really good.
371.26	And people paid less in 1950 dollars
374.26	to catch that
376.26	than what people pay now
378.26	to catch those little, tiny fish.
381.26	And that's everywhere.
383.26	It's not just the fish, though,
385.26	that are disappearing.
387.26	Industrial fishing uses big stuff,
390.26	big machinery.
392.26	We use nets that are 20 miles long.
394.26	We use longlines
396.26	that have one million or two million hooks.
399.26	And we trawl,
401.26	which means to take something
403.26	the size of a tractor trailer truck
405.26	that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,
408.26	put it on a big chain,
410.26	and drag it across the sea floor
412.26	to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.
415.26	Think of it as
418.26	being kind of the bulldozing of a city
420.26	or of a forest,
422.26	because it clears it away.
424.26	And the habitat destruction
426.26	is unbelievable.
428.26	This is a photograph,
430.26	a typical photograph,
432.26	of what the continental shelves
434.26	of the world look like.
436.26	You can see the rows in the bottom,
439.26	the way you can see the rows
441.26	in a field that has just been plowed
443.26	to plant corn.
445.26	What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,
448.26	which is a critical habitat
450.26	for the development of fish.
452.26	What it is now is mud,
455.26	and the area of the ocean floor
458.26	that has been transformed from forest
461.26	to level mud, to parking lot,
463.26	is equivalent to the entire area
466.26	of all the forests
468.26	that have ever been cut down
470.26	on all of the earth
472.26	in the history of humanity.
474.26	We've managed to do that
476.26	in the last 100 to 150 years.
480.26	We tend to think of oil spills
482.26	and mercury
484.26	and we hear a lot about plastic these days.
486.26	And all of that stuff is really disgusting,
488.26	but what's really insidious
490.26	is the biological pollution that happens
493.26	because of the magnitude of the shifts
496.26	that it causes
498.26	to entire ecosystems.
500.26	And I'm going to just talk very briefly
502.26	about two kinds of biological pollution:
505.26	one is introduced species
507.26	and the other is what comes from nutrients.
510.26	So this is the infamous
512.26	Caulerpa taxifolia,
514.26	the so-called killer algae.
517.26	A book was written about it.
519.26	It's a bit of an embarrassment.
521.26	It was accidentally released
523.26	from the aquarium in Monaco,
525.26	it was bred to be cold tolerant
528.26	to have in peoples aquaria.
530.26	It's very pretty,
532.26	and it has rapidly started
534.26	to overgrow
536.26	the once very rich
538.26	biodiversity of the
540.26	northwestern Mediterranean.
542.26	I don't know how many of you remember the movie
544.26	"""The Little Shop of Horrors,"""
546.26	"but this is the plant of ""The Little Shop of Horrors."""
549.26	But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,
552.26	what it's doing is overgrowing
554.26	and smothering
556.26	virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life
559.26	of the entire northwestern
562.26	Mediterranean Sea.
564.26	We don't know anything that eats it,
566.26	we're trying to do all sorts of genetics
568.26	and figure out something that could be done,
571.26	but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,
574.26	about which nobody knows what to do.
577.26	Now another form of pollution
580.26	that's biological pollution
582.26	is what happens from excess nutrients.
584.26	The green revolution,
586.26	all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
589.26	It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
592.26	It runs down the rivers,
594.26	and it feeds the plankton,
596.26	the little microscopic plant cells
598.26	in the coastal water.
600.26	But since we ate all the oysters
602.26	and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,
604.26	there's nothing to eat the plankton
606.26	and there's more and more of it,
608.26	so it dies of old age,
610.26	which is unheard of for plankton.
612.26	And when it dies, it falls to the bottom
614.26	and then it rots,
616.26	which means that bacteria break it down.
618.26	And in the process
620.26	they use up all the oxygen,
622.26	and in using up all the oxygen
624.26	they make the environment utterly lethal
626.26	for anything that can't swim away.
628.26	So, what we end up with
630.26	is a microbial zoo
632.26	dominated by bacteria
634.26	and jellyfish, as you see
636.26	on the left in front of you.
638.26	And the only fishery left --
640.26	and it is a commercial fishery --
642.26	is the jellyfish fishery
644.26	you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.
646.26	Even in Newfoundland
648.26	where we used to catch cod,
650.26	we now have a jellyfish fishery.
653.26	And another version of this sort of thing
655.26	is what is often called red tides
657.26	or toxic blooms.
659.26	That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
662.26	I have talked about it a million times,
664.26	but it's unbelievable.
666.26	In the upper right of that picture on the left
668.26	is almost the Mississippi Delta,
670.26	and the lower left of that picture
672.26	is the Texas-Mexico border.
674.26	You're looking at the entire
676.26	northwestern Gulf of Mexico;
678.26	you're looking at one toxic
680.26	dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,
682.26	made by that beautiful little creature
684.26	on the lower right.
686.26	And in the upper right you see this
688.26	black sort of cloud
690.26	moving ashore.
692.26	That's the same species.
694.26	And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,
697.26	and little droplets of the water get into the air,
700.26	the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
703.26	with people with acute respiratory distress.
705.26	And that's retirement homes
707.26	on the west coast of Florida.
709.26	A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
711.26	we called Hollywood ocean night,
713.26	and I was trying to figure out how to
715.26	explain to actors what's going on.
717.26	And I said,
719.26	"""So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'"
722.26	because all the beautiful people have moved
724.26	to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.
726.26	And the only people who are left there
728.26	are the people who can't afford
731.26	to move away from the coast,
733.26	because the coast, instead of being paradise,
736.26	"is harmful to your health."""
738.26	And then this is amazing.
740.26	It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
743.26	This is from the coast of Brittany,
745.26	which is being enveloped
747.26	in this green, algal slime.
750.26	The reason that it attracted so much attention,
753.26	besides the fact that it's disgusting,
756.26	is that sea birds flying over it
758.26	are asphyxiated by the smell and die,
761.26	and a farmer died of it,
763.26	and you can imagine the scandal that happened.
765.26	And so there's this war
767.26	between the farmers
769.26	and the fishermen about it all,
771.26	and the net result is that
773.26	the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
776.26	on a regular basis.
778.26	And then, of course, there's climate change,
780.26	and we all know about climate change.
782.26	I guess the iconic figure of it
784.26	is the melting of the ice
786.26	in the Arctic Sea.
788.26	Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died
791.26	trying to find the Northwest Passage.
794.26	Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.
796.26	I think it's sort of funny;
798.26	it's on the Siberian coast,
800.26	maybe the Russians will charge tolls.
803.26	The governments of the world
805.26	are taking this really seriously.
807.26	The military of the Arctic nations
810.26	is taking it really seriously.
813.26	For all the denial of climate change
815.26	by government leaders,
817.26	the CIA
819.26	and the navies of Norway
821.26	and the U.S. and Canada, whatever
824.26	are busily thinking about
826.26	how they will secure their territory
829.26	in this inevitability
832.26	from their point of view.
834.26	And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.
836.26	The other kinds of effects of climate change --
838.26	this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?
840.26	All that white coral.
842.26	Except it's supposed to be brown.
845.26	What happens is that
847.26	the corals are a symbiosis,
849.26	and they have these little algal cells
851.26	that live inside them.
853.26	And the algae give the corals sugar,
855.26	and the corals give the algae
857.26	nutrients and protection.
859.26	But when it gets too hot,
861.26	the algae can't make the sugar.
863.26	"The corals say, ""You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."""
865.26	They kick them out, and then they die.
868.26	Not all of them die; some of them survive,
870.26	some more are surviving,
872.26	but it's really bad news.
874.26	To try and give you a sense of this,
876.26	imagine you go camping in July
879.26	somewhere in Europe or in North America,
882.26	and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,
884.26	and you see that 80 percent of the trees,
886.26	as far as you can see,
888.26	have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.
891.26	And you come home, and you discover
893.26	that 80 percent of all the trees
895.26	in North America and in Europe
897.26	have dropped their leaves.
899.26	And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,
901.26	"""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."""
904.26	Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean
907.26	during the 1998 El Nino,
909.26	an area vastly greater
911.26	than the size of North America and Europe,
913.26	when 80 percent of all the corals bleached
916.26	and a quarter of them died.
919.26	And then the really scary thing
921.26	about all of this --
923.26	the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --
926.26	is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.
929.26	But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,
932.26	the synergies among them
934.26	that make the whole vastly greater
936.26	than the sum of the parts.
938.26	And the great scientific challenge
941.26	for people like me in thinking about all this,
944.26	is do we know how
946.26	to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?
949.26	I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.
952.26	But what does that mean?
954.26	We really don't know.
957.26	So what are the oceans going to be like
960.26	in 20 or 50 years?
963.26	Well, there won't be any fish
965.26	except for minnows,
967.26	and the water will be pretty dirty,
970.26	and all those kinds of things
972.26	and full of mercury, etc., etc.
977.26	And dead zones will get bigger and bigger
979.26	and they'll start to merge,
981.26	and we can imagine something like
983.26	the dead-zonification
985.26	of the global, coastal ocean.
988.26	Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,
991.26	because it would be a kind of
993.26	gastronomic Russian roulette.
995.26	Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;
997.26	sometimes you don't.
999.26	That doesn't sell.
1001.26	The really scary things though
1003.26	are the physical, chemical,
1006.26	oceanographic things that are happening.
1009.26	As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,
1012.26	the water is lighter when it's warmer,
1014.26	it becomes harder and harder
1016.26	to turn the ocean over.
1018.26	We say it becomes
1020.26	more strongly stratified.
1022.26	The consequence of that is that
1024.26	all those nutrients
1026.26	that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,
1029.26	of the sardines of California
1031.26	or in Peru or whatever,
1034.26	those slow down
1036.26	and those fisheries collapse.
1038.26	And, at the same time,
1040.26	water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,
1043.26	doesn't make it down
1047.26	and the ocean turns into a desert.
1050.26	So the question is: How are we all
1052.26	going to respond to this?
1054.26	And we can do
1056.26	all sorts of things to fix it,
1058.26	but in the final analysis,
1060.26	the thing we really need to fix
1062.26	is ourselves.
1064.26	It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;
1067.26	it's not about the climate change.
1069.26	It's about us
1071.26	and our greed and our need for growth
1074.26	and our inability to imagine a world
1077.26	that is different from the selfish world
1079.26	we live in today.
1081.26	So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
1084.26	I would say that the future of life
1086.26	and the dignity of human beings
1088.26	depends on our doing that.
1090.26	Thank you. (Applause)
