16.188	So I'm here to tell you
16.188	that we have a problem with boys,
19.383	and it's a serious problem with boys.
22.017	Their culture isn't working in schools,
24.669	and I'm going to share with you ways
26.471	that we can think
26.471	about overcoming that problem.
29.565	First, I want to start
29.565	by saying, this is a boy,
32.555	and this is a girl,
35.101	and this is probably stereotypically
35.101	what you think of as a boy and a girl.
38.673	If I essentialize gender for you today,
38.673	then you can dismiss what I have to say.
42.48	So I'm not going to do that,
42.48	I'm not interested in doing that.
45.468	This is a different kind of boy
45.468	and a different kind of girl.
48.709	So the point here is that not all boys
48.709	exist within these rigid boundaries
53.166	of what we think of as boys and girls,
55.38	and not all girls exist
55.38	within those rigid boundaries
57.959	of what we think of as girls.
59.375	But, in fact, most boys
59.375	tend to be a certain way,
63.124	and most girls tend to be a certain way.
65.125	And the point is that, for boys,
67.388	the way that they exist
67.388	and the culture that they embrace
70.598	isn't working well in schools now.
73.13	How do we know that?
74.378	The 100 girls project
74.378	tells us some really nice statistics.
79.161	For example, for every 100 girls
79.161	that are suspended from school,
82.698	there are 250 boys
82.698	that are suspended from school.
85.642	For every 100 girls
85.642	who are expelled from school,
87.989	there are 335 boys
87.989	who are expelled from school.
91.34	For every 100 girls in special education,
93.711	there are 217 boys.
95.902	For every 100 girls
95.902	with a learning disability,
98.127	there are 276 boys.
100.545	For every 100 girls
100.545	with an emotional disturbance diagnosed,
105.031	we have 324 boys.
106.825	And by the way, all of these numbers
106.825	are significantly higher
110.425	if you happen to be black,
111.869	if you happen to be poor,
113.736	if you happen to exist
113.736	in an overcrowded school.
117.509	And if you are a boy,
119.654	you're four times as likely
119.654	to be diagnosed with ADHD --
123.414	Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
126.339	Now there is another side to this.
129.424	And it is important that we recognize
129.424	that women still need help in school,
135.058	that salaries are still
135.058	significantly lower,
137.345	even when controlled for job types,
139.667	and that girls have continued to struggle
139.667	in math and science for years.
143.974	That's all true.
145.154	Nothing about that prevents us
147.457	from paying attention
147.457	to the literacy needs
149.515	of our boys between ages three and 13.
152.109	And so we should.
153.285	In fact, what we ought to do
153.285	is take a page from their playbook,
156.332	because the initiatives and programs
156.332	that have been set in place
160.603	for women in science and engineering
160.603	and mathematics are fantastic.
164.468	They've done a lot of good
164.468	for girls in these situations,
168.422	and we ought to be thinking about
168.422	how we can make that happen for boys too
172.26	in their younger years.
174.36	Even in their older years,
176.26	what we find is that
176.26	there's still a problem.
178.771	When we look at the universities,
	are going to women now,
183.402	which is a significant shift.
185.26	And in fact, university administrators
185.26	are a little uncomfortable about the idea
189.155	that we may be getting close to 70 percent
189.155	female population in universities.
194.084	This makes university
194.084	administrators very nervous,
196.458	because girls don't want to go
196.458	to schools that don't have boys.
201.79	And so we're starting to see
203.912	the establishment of men centers
203.912	and men studies
207.093	to think about how do we engage men
207.093	in their experiences in the university.
211.394	If you talk to faculty,
211.394	"they may say, ""Ugh. Yeah, well,"
214.195	they're playing video games,
215.767	and they're gambling
215.767	online all night long,
218.76	and they're playing World of Warcraft,
220.599	and that's affecting
220.599	"their academic achievement."""
225.72	Guess what?
226.925	Video games are not the cause.
229.42	Video games are a symptom.
231.741	They were turned off a long time
231.741	before they got here.
236.387	So let's talk about
236.387	why they got turned off
239.07	when they were between the ages
239.07	of three and 13.
242.45	There are three reasons that I believe
244.353	that boys are out of sync
244.353	with the culture of schools today.
248.014	The first is zero tolerance.
250.627	A kindergarten teacher I know,
250.627	her son donated all of his toys to her,
255.668	and when he did, she had to go through
255.668	and pull out all the little plastic guns.
262.26	You can't have plastic knives
262.26	and swords and axes
264.778	and all that kind of thing
264.778	in a kindergarten classroom.
267.945	What is it that we're afraid that this
267.945	young man is going to do with this gun?
271.844	I mean, really.
273.918	But here he stands as testament
276.26	to the fact that you can't roughhouse
276.26	on the playground today.
279.56	Now I'm not advocating for bullies.
281.593	I'm not suggesting that we need to be
281.593	allowing guns and knives in the school.
286.82	But when we say that an Eagle Scout
286.82	in a high school classroom
291.1	who has a locked parked car
291.1	in the parking lot and a penknife in it,
294.449	has to be suspended from school,
296.496	I think we may have gone
296.496	a little too far with zero tolerance.
299.82	Another way that zero tolerance
299.82	lives itself out
302.172	is in the writing of boys.
303.487	In a lot of classrooms today,
304.896	you're not allowed to write
304.896	about anything that's violent.
307.64	You're not allowed to write about anything
307.64	that has to do with video games.
311.19	These topics are banned.
312.384	Boy comes home from school, and he says,
314.356	"""I hate writing."""
315.83	"""Why do you hate writing, son?"
315.83	"What's wrong with writing?"""
318.581	"""Now I have to write"
318.581	"what she tells me to write."""
320.918	"""OK, what is she telling you to write?"""
323.363	"""Poems. I have to write poems."
325.748	And little moments in my life.
327.768	"I don't want to write that stuff."""
330.14	"""Well, what do you want to write?"
331.806	"What do you want to write about?"""
333.421	"""I want to write about video games."
333.421	I want to write about leveling-up.
336.734	I want to write about
336.734	this really interesting world.
339.196	I want to write about a tornado
339.196	that comes into our house
342.049	and blows all the windows out,
343.585	and ruins all the furniture
343.585	"and kills everybody."""
345.915	"""All right. OK."""
347.41	You tell a teacher that,
347.41	and they'll ask you, in all seriousness,
351.157	"""Should we send this child"
351.157	"to the psychologist?"""
354.877	And the answer is no, he's just a boy.
357.772	He's just a little boy.
360.436	It's not OK to write these kinds of things
360.436	in classrooms today.
365.094	So that's the first reason:
366.413	Zero tolerance policies
366.413	and the way they're lived out.
368.986	The next reason that boys' cultures
368.986	are out of sync with school cultures:
372.491	there are fewer male teachers.
373.952	Anybody who's over 15
373.952	doesn't know what this means,
376.735	because in the last 10 years,
378.515	the number of elementary school
378.515	classroom teachers has been cut in half.
382.332	We went from 14 percent to seven percent.
386.2	That means that 93 percent of the teachers
388.547	that our young men get in elementary
388.547	classrooms are women.
392.743	Now what's the problem with this?
394.997	Women are great, yep, absolutely.
397.6	But male role models for boys
397.6	that say it's all right to be smart --
402.066	they've got dads, they've got pastors,
402.066	they've got Cub Scout leaders,
405.692	but ultimately, six hours a day,
405.692	five days a week
408.8	they're spending in a classroom,
411.07	and most of those classrooms
411.07	are not places where men exist.
414.458	And so they say, I guess this really
414.458	isn't a place for boys.
418.383	This is a place for girls.
420.075	And I'm not very good at this,
421.689	so I guess I'd better go play video games
424.921	or get into sports,
424.921	or something like that,
426.956	because I obviously don't belong here.
428.862	Men don't belong here,
428.862	that's pretty obvious.
430.996	So that may be a very direct way
430.996	that we see it happen.
435.332	But less directly, the lack of male
435.332	presence in the culture --
439.757	you've got a teachers' lounge,
439.757	and they're having a conversation
442.971	about Joey and Johnny
442.971	who beat each other up on the playground.
447.122	"""What are we going to do with these boys?"""
449.15	The answer to that question changes
450.858	depending on who's sitting
450.858	around that table.
452.983	Are there men around that table?
454.567	Are there moms who've raised boys
454.567	around that table?
457.041	You'll see, the conversation changes
458.807	depending upon who's sitting
458.807	around the table.
460.979	Third reason that boys
460.979	are out of sync with school today:
463.855	Kindergarten is the old
463.855	second grade, folks.
466.323	We have a serious compression
466.323	of the curriculum happening out there.
470.592	When you're three, you better be able
470.592	to write your name legibly,
473.709	or else we'll consider it
473.709	a developmental delay.
476.754	By the time you're in first grade,
478.421	you should be able to read
478.421	paragraphs of text
481.05	with maybe a picture, maybe not,
481.05	in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.
484.554	If you don't,
485.758	we're probably going to be putting you
485.758	into a Title I special reading program.
489.457	And if you ask Title I teachers,
489.457	they'll tell you
491.779	they've got about four or five boys
491.779	for every girl that's in their program,
495.422	in the elementary grades.
496.65	The reason that this is a problem
498.428	is because the message
498.428	that boys are getting
501.505	"is, ""You need to do what the teacher"
501.505	"asks you to do all the time."""
506.352	The teacher's salary depends
506.352	"on ""No Child Left Behind"""
510.536	"and ""Race to the Top"""
510.536	and accountability and testing
513.26	and all of this.
515.26	So she has to figure out a way
515.26	to get all these boys
519.258	through this curriculum -- and girls.
523.142	This compressed curriculum is bad
523.142	for all active kids.
527.746	And what happens is,
529.59	"she says, ""Please, sit down,"
529.59	be quiet, do what you're told,
534.274	follow the rules, manage your time,
534.274	"focus, be a girl."""
540.569	That's what she tells them.
542.151	Indirectly, that's what she tells them.
544.26	And so this is a very serious problem.
546.344	Where is it coming from?
546.344	It's coming from us.
548.725	(Laughter)
551.992	We want our babies to read
551.992	when they are six months old.
554.984	Have you seen the ads?
556.26	We want to live in Lake Wobegon
556.26	where every child is above average ...
561.658	but what this does to our children
561.658	is really not healthy.
565.126	It's not developmentally appropriate,
566.96	and it's particularly bad for boys.
569.404	So what do we do?
571.16	We need to meet them where they are.
572.909	We need to put ourselves into boy culture.
575.197	We need to change the mindset
575.197	of acceptance in boys
580.476	in elementary schools.
582.428	More specifically, we can do
582.428	some very specific things.
585.648	We can design better games.
587.26	Most of the educational games
587.26	that are out there today
590.099	are really flashcards.
591.648	They're glorified drill and practice.
593.614	They don't have the depth,
593.614	the rich narrative
596.451	that really engaging video games have,
599.227	that the boys are really interested in.
601.254	So we need to design better games.
602.92	We need to talk to teachers and parents
602.92	and school board members and politicians.
606.77	We need to make sure that people see
606.77	that we need more men in the classroom.
610.37	We need to look carefully
610.37	at our zero tolerance policies.
613.088	Do they make sense?
614.28	We need to think about how to uncompress
614.28	this curriculum if we can,
618.26	trying to bring boys back into a space
618.26	that is comfortable for them.
622.26	All of those conversations
622.26	need to be happening.
624.57	There are some great examples
624.57	out there of schools --
627.397	the New York Times
627.397	just talked about a school recently.
630.904	A game designer from the New School
633.26	put together a wonderful
633.26	video gaming school.
636.652	But it only treats a few kids,
636.652	and so this isn't very scalable.
641.513	We have to change the culture
641.513	and the feelings
643.693	that politicians and school board
643.693	members and parents have
648.539	about the way we accept
648.539	and what we accept in our schools today.
651.63	We need to find more money
651.63	for game design.
653.663	Because good games,
653.663	really good games, cost money,
656.041	and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.
658.052	Most of the educational games do not.
660.168	Where we started:
661.44	my colleagues Mike Petner,
661.44	Shawn Vashaw, myself,
664.26	we started by trying to look
664.26	at the teachers' attitudes
666.875	and find out how do they really
666.875	feel about gaming,
669.244	what do they say about it.
670.528	And we discovered that they talk
670.528	about the kids in their school,
675.526	who talk about gaming,
675.526	in pretty demeaning ways.
678.792	"They say, ""Oh, yeah. They're always"
678.792	talking about that stuff.
682.009	They're talking
682.009	about their little action figures
684.357	and their little achievements
684.357	or merit badges,
686.769	or whatever it is that they get.
688.851	And they're always talking
688.851	"about this stuff."""
690.977	And they say these things as if it's OK.
692.958	But if it were your culture,
692.958	think of how that might feel.
696.26	It's very uncomfortable
696.26	to be on the receiving end
698.665	of that kind of language.
701.236	They're nervous about anything
701.236	that has anything to do with violence
704.476	because of the zero tolerance policies.
706.385	They are sure that parents
706.385	and administrators
708.52	will never accept anything.
709.842	So we really need to think
709.842	about looking at teacher attitudes
712.75	and finding ways to change the attitudes,
715.536	so that teachers are much more open
715.536	and accepting of boy cultures
719.53	in their classrooms.
720.744	Because, ultimately, if we don't,
722.836	then we're going to have boys
722.836	who leave elementary school saying,
726.132	"""Well I guess that was just"
726.132	a place for girls, it wasn't for me.
729.184	So I've got to do gaming,
729.184	"or I've got to do sports."""
732.416	If we change these things,
732.416	if we pay attention to these things,
735.453	and we reengage boys in their learning,
737.396	they will leave the elementary
737.396	"schools saying, ""I'm smart."""
741.394	Thank you.
742.569	(Applause)
