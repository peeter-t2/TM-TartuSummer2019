12.943	I'm really glad to be here.
15.015	I'm glad you're here,
16.727	because that would be a little weird.
19.46	I'm glad we're all here.
22.303	"And by ""here,"" I don't mean here."
26.831	Or here.
28.728	But here.
29.904	I mean Earth.
31.627	"And by ""we,"" I don't mean"
31.627	those of us in this auditorium,
35.594	but life,
37.088	all life on Earth --
38.561	(Laughter)
44.28	from complex to single-celled,
46.295	from mold to mushrooms
48.643	to flying bears.
50.045	(Laughter)
53.736	The interesting thing is,
55.269	Earth is the only place
55.269	we know of that has life --
58.324	8.7 million species.
60.66	We've looked other places,
61.938	maybe not as hard
61.938	as we should or we could,
64.059	but we've looked and haven't found any;
66.01	Earth is the only place
66.01	we know of with life.
69.318	Is Earth special?
71.591	This is a question I've wanted
71.591	to know the answer to
74.069	since I was a small child,
75.347	and I suspect 80 percent
75.347	of this auditorium
77.403	has thought the same thing
77.403	and also wanted to know the answer.
80.879	To understand whether
80.879	there are any planets --
83.07	out there in our solar system or beyond --
85.372	that can support life,
86.854	the first step is to understand
86.854	what life here requires.
90.575	It turns out, of all of those
90.575	8.7 million species,
94.162	life only needs three things.
97.032	On one side, all life
97.032	on Earth needs energy.
99.908	Complex life like us derives
99.908	our energy from the sun,
103.417	but life deep underground
103.417	can get its energy
105.542	from things like chemical reactions.
107.288	There are a number
107.288	of different energy sources
109.463	available on all planets.
111.4	On the other side,
112.58	all life needs food or nourishment.
115.741	And this seems like a tall order,
115.741	especially if you want a succulent tomato.
120.239	(Laughter)
121.979	However, all life on Earth
121.979	derives its nourishment
125.069	from only six chemical elements,
127.123	and these elements can be found
127.123	on any planetary body
130.151	in our solar system.
132.537	So that leaves the thing
132.537	in the middle as the tall pole,
135.788	the thing that's hardest to achieve.
137.766	Not moose, but water.
139.682	(Laughter)
143.285	Although moose would be pretty cool.
145.103	(Laughter)
146.285	And not frozen water, and not water
146.285	in a gaseous state, but liquid water.
152.748	This is what life needs
152.748	to survive, all life.
155.68	And many solar system bodies
155.68	don't have liquid water,
159.04	and so we don't look there.
160.7	Other solar system bodies
160.7	might have abundant liquid water,
163.717	even more than Earth,
165.076	but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,
167.55	and so it's hard to access,
167.55	it's hard to get to,
169.835	it's hard to even find out
169.835	if there's any life there.
173.475	So that leaves a few bodies
173.475	that we should think about.
176.494	So let's make the problem
176.494	simpler for ourselves.
178.947	Let's think only about liquid water
178.947	on the surface of a planet.
182.312	There are only three bodies
182.312	to think about in our solar system,
185.292	with regard to liquid water
185.292	on the surface of a planet,
187.898	and in order of distance from the sun,
187.898	it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.
193.265	You want to have an atmosphere
193.265	for water to be liquid.
196.661	You have to be very careful
196.661	with that atmosphere.
199.063	You can't have too much atmosphere,
199.063	too thick or too warm an atmosphere,
202.499	because then you end up
202.499	too hot like Venus,
205.428	and you can't have liquid water.
207.189	But if you have too little atmosphere
207.189	and it's too thin and too cold,
211.166	you end up like Mars, too cold.
213.865	So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,
216.364	and Earth is just right.
217.552	You can look at these images behind me
217.552	and you can see automatically
221.051	where life can survive
221.051	in our solar system.
224.296	It's a Goldilocks-type problem,
225.92	and it's so simple
225.92	that a child could understand it.
229.452	However,
231.45	I'd like to remind you of two things
234.402	from the Goldilocks story
234.402	that we may not think about so often
237.38	but that I think are really relevant here.
240.056	Number one:
242.311	if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold
245.833	when Goldilocks walks into the room,
248.642	does that mean it's always been too cold?
251.825	Or could it have been just right
251.825	at some other time?
255.65	When Goldilocks walks into the room
255.65	determines the answer
259.355	that we get in the story.
261.114	And the same is true with planets.
262.868	They're not static things. They change.
264.918	They vary. They evolve.
266.684	And atmospheres do the same.
268.751	So let me give you an example.
270.477	Here's one of my favorite
270.477	pictures of Mars.
272.503	It's not the highest resolution image,
272.503	it's not the sexiest image,
275.658	it's not the most recent image,
277.185	but it's an image that shows riverbeds
277.185	cut into the surface of the planet;
281.32	riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;
285.515	riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands
285.515	or tens of thousands of years to form.
290.425	This can't happen on Mars today.
292.067	The atmosphere of Mars today
292.067	is too thin and too cold
294.572	for water to be stable as a liquid.
296.737	This one image tells you
296.737	that the atmosphere of Mars changed,
301.109	and it changed in big ways.
303.714	And it changed from a state
303.714	that we would define as habitable,
308.547	because the three requirements
308.547	for life were present long ago.
313.049	Where did that atmosphere go
315.141	that allowed water
315.141	to be liquid at the surface?
317.985	Well, one idea is it escaped
317.985	away to space.
321.356	Atmospheric particles
321.356	got enough energy to break free
324.047	from the gravity of the planet,
325.724	escaping away to space, never to return.
328.437	And this happens with all bodies
328.437	with atmospheres.
331.149	Comets have tails
332.345	that are incredibly visible reminders
332.345	of atmospheric escape.
335.626	But Venus also has an atmosphere
335.626	that escapes with time,
339.059	and Mars and Earth as well.
340.743	It's just a matter of degree
340.743	and a matter of scale.
344.092	So we'd like to figure out
344.092	how much escaped over time
346.792	so we can explain this transition.
348.932	How do atmospheres
348.932	get their energy for escape?
351.567	How do particles get
351.567	enough energy to escape?
353.722	There are two ways, if we're going
353.722	to reduce things a little bit.
356.931	Number one, sunlight.
358.106	Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed
358.106	by atmospheric particles
361.542	and warm the particles.
363.28	Yes, I'm dancing, but they --
365.412	(Laughter)
367.693	Oh my God, not even at my wedding.
369.629	(Laughter)
371.145	They get enough energy
371.145	to escape and break free
374.172	from the gravity of the planet
374.172	just by warming.
376.696	A second way they can get energy
376.696	is from the solar wind.
379.882	These are particles, mass, material,
379.882	spit out from the surface of the sun,
384.932	and they go screaming
384.932	through the solar system
387.36	at 400 kilometers per second,
389.169	sometimes faster during solar storms,
391.787	and they go hurtling
391.787	through interplanetary space
394.533	towards planets and their atmospheres,
397.003	and they may provide energy
398.652	for atmospheric particles
398.652	to escape as well.
401.182	This is something that I'm interested in,
403.175	because it relates to habitability.
405.378	I mentioned that there were two things
405.378	about the Goldilocks story
408.534	that I wanted to bring to your attention
408.534	and remind you about,
411.542	and the second one
411.542	is a little bit more subtle.
413.805	If Papa Bear's bowl is too hot,
418.18	and Mama Bear's bowl is too cold,
423.057	shouldn't Baby Bear's bowl be even colder
427.081	if we're following the trend?
430.195	This thing that you've accepted
430.195	your entire life,
432.531	when you think about it a little bit more,
432.531	may not be so simple.
436.513	And of course, distance of a planet
436.513	from the sun determines its temperature.
440.565	This has to play into habitability.
442.855	But maybe there are other things
442.855	we should be thinking about.
445.809	Maybe it's the bowls themselves
447.449	that are also helping to determine
447.449	the outcome in the story,
450.529	what is just right.
452.765	I could talk to you about a lot
452.765	of different characteristics
455.654	of these three planets
456.829	that may influence habitability,
458.422	but for selfish reasons related
458.422	to my own research
461.04	and the fact that I'm standing up here
461.04	holding the clicker and you're not --
464.652	(Laughter)
465.682	I would like to talk
465.682	for just a minute or two
467.815	about magnetic fields.
469.715	Earth has one; Venus and Mars do not.
472.825	Magnetic fields are generated
472.825	in the deep interior of a planet
475.972	by electrically conducting
475.972	churning fluid material
479.713	that creates this big old magnetic field
479.713	that surrounds Earth.
482.642	If you have a compass,
482.642	you know which way north is.
485.062	Venus and Mars don't have that.
486.58	If you have a compass on Venus and Mars,
488.518	congratulations, you're lost.
489.938	(Laughter)
491.865	Does this influence habitability?
495.175	Well, how might it?
497.024	Many scientists think
497.024	that a magnetic field of a planet
499.652	serves as a shield for the atmosphere,
502.071	deflecting solar wind particles
502.071	around the planet
505.45	in a bit of a force field-type effect
507.289	having to do with electric charge
507.289	of those particles.
510.362	I like to think of it instead
510.362	as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.
514.013	(Laughter)
516.962	And yes, my colleagues
516.962	who watch this later will realize
520.367	this is the first time in the history
520.367	of our community
522.935	that the solar wind has been
522.935	equated with mucus.
525.238	(Laughter)
528.978	OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth
528.978	may have been protected
532.477	for billions of years,
533.67	because we've had a magnetic field.
535.544	Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.
537.747	Mars, on the other hand,
537.747	has been unprotected
539.878	because of its lack of magnetic field,
541.744	and over billions of years,
543.72	maybe enough atmosphere
543.72	has been stripped away
545.924	to account for a transition
545.924	from a habitable planet
548.541	to the planet that we see today.
551.059	Other scientists think
551.059	that magnetic fields
554.072	may act more like the sails on a ship,
556.958	enabling the planet to interact
556.958	with more energy from the solar wind
562.019	than the planet would have been able
562.019	to interact with by itself.
565.315	The sails may gather energy
565.315	from the solar wind.
567.83	The magnetic field may gather
567.83	energy from the solar wind
570.52	that allows even more
570.52	atmospheric escape to happen.
573.788	It's an idea that has to be tested,
576.066	but the effect and how it works
577.975	seems apparent.
579.15	That's because we know
580.325	energy from the solar wind
580.325	is being deposited into our atmosphere
583.424	here on Earth.
584.599	That energy is conducted
584.599	along magnetic field lines
587.028	down into the polar regions,
588.4	resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.
590.56	If you've ever experienced them,
590.56	it's magnificent.
593.24	We know the energy is getting in.
595.27	We're trying to measure
595.27	how many particles are getting out
598.327	and if the magnetic field
598.327	is influencing this in any way.
602.722	So I've posed a problem for you here,
605.126	but I don't have a solution yet.
606.696	We don't have a solution.
608.702	But we're working on it.
608.702	How are we working on it?
611.083	Well, we've sent spacecraft
611.083	to all three planets.
613.405	Some of them are orbiting now,
614.905	including the MAVEN spacecraft
614.905	which is currently orbiting Mars,
618.001	which I'm involved with
618.001	and which is led here,
621.557	out of the University of Colorado.
623.39	It's designed to measure
623.39	atmospheric escape.
626.022	We have similar measurements
626.022	from Venus and Earth.
628.953	Once we have all our measurements,
630.642	we can combine all these together,
630.642	and we can understand
633.541	how all three planets interact
633.541	with their space environment,
636.982	with the surroundings.
638.168	And we can decide whether magnetic fields
638.168	are important for habitability
641.714	or not.
642.896	Once we have that answer,
642.896	why should you care?
645.185	I mean, I care deeply ...
648.128	And financially as well, but deeply.
650.158	(Laughter)
652.763	First of all, an answer to this question
654.705	will teach us more
654.705	about these three planets,
656.832	Venus, Earth and Mars,
658.016	not only about how they interact
658.016	with their environment today,
660.951	but how they were billions of years ago,
662.902	whether they were habitable
662.902	long ago or not.
664.988	It will teach us about atmospheres
666.656	that surround us and that are close.
669.127	But moreover, what we learn
669.127	from these planets
671.335	can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,
674.485	including planets that we're now
674.485	observing around other stars.
677.422	For example, the Kepler spacecraft,
679.201	which is built and controlled
679.201	here in Boulder,
682.433	has been observing
682.433	a postage stamp-sized region of the sky
685.742	for a couple years now,
687.013	and it's found thousands of planets --
689.265	in one postage stamp-sized
689.265	region of the sky
692.202	that we don't think is any different
692.202	from any other part of the sky.
696.815	We've gone, in 20 years,
698.649	from knowing of zero planets
698.649	outside of our solar system,
702.71	to now having so many,
704.487	that we don't know
704.487	which ones to investigate first.
709.269	Any lever will help.
712.539	In fact, based on observations
712.539	that Kepler's taken
716.147	and other similar observations,
718.3	we now believe that,
719.493	of the 200 billion stars
719.493	in the Milky Way galaxy alone,
724.786	on average, every star
724.786	has at least one planet.
730.819	In addition to that,
732.346	estimates suggest there are somewhere
732.346	between 40 billion and 100 billion
738.071	of those planets
738.071	that we would define as habitable
743.139	in just our galaxy.
746.59	We have the observations of those planets,
748.651	but we just don't know
748.651	which ones are habitable yet.
751.159	It's a little bit like
751.159	being trapped on a red spot --
754.789	(Laughter)
755.984	on a stage
758.178	and knowing that there are
758.178	other worlds out there
763.042	and desperately wanting to know
763.042	more about them,
767.174	wanting to interrogate them and find out
767.174	if maybe just one or two of them
771.132	are a little bit like you.
774.244	You can't do that.
774.244	You can't go there, not yet.
776.827	And so you have to use the tools
776.827	that you've developed around you
780.844	for Venus, Earth and Mars,
782.163	and you have to apply them
782.163	to these other situations,
785	and hope that you're making
785	reasonable inferences from the data,
789.72	and that you're going to be able
789.72	to determine the best candidates
792.862	for habitable planets,
792.862	and those that are not.
796.139	In the end, and for now, at least,
798.878	this is our red spot, right here.
802.376	This is the only planet
802.376	that we know of that's habitable,
805.736	although very soon we may
805.736	come to know of more.
808.951	But for now, this is
808.951	the only habitable planet,
811.711	and this is our red spot.
813.976	I'm really glad we're here.
816.507	Thanks.
817.706	(Applause)
