12.883	This is our life with bees,
16.863	and this is our life without bees.
20.586	Bees are the most important pollinators
23.054	of our fruits and vegetables and flowers
25.863	and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.
29.522	More than one third of the world's crop production
32.21	is dependent on bee pollination.
34.992	But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there
37.829	pollinating our food intentionally.
40.746	They're out there because they need to eat.
43.617	Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet
46.336	from pollen
47.665	and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.
50.601	They're flower-feeders,
52.366	and as they move from flower to flower,
54.3	basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,
57.771	they end up providing this valuable pollination service.
62.226	In parts of the world where there are no bees,
64.746	or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,
67.652	people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.
71.858	These people are moving pollen from flower to flower
75.542	with a paintbrush.
77.441	Now this business of hand pollination
79.887	is actually not that uncommon.
81.973	Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers
85.325	with a hand-held vibrator.
87.982	Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)
91.926	Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower
97.206	is held very securely within
98.986	the male part of the flower, the anther,
101.486	and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
104.86	So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world
108.546	that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,
111.669	and they do this by shaking their flight muscles
114.261	at a frequency similar to the musical note C.
118.813	So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,
121.399	and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,
124.446	and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,
127.185	and she takes it home as food.
129.682	Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies
132.523	inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes
135.054	because they get much more efficient pollination
137.417	when it's done naturally
138.912	and they get better quality tomatoes.
142.474	So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,
146.061	to care about bees.
147.484	There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,
151.656	and they're absolutely gorgeous.
154.662	These bees spend the majority of their life cycle
157.281	hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem
160.101	and very few of these beautiful species
162.801	have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.
166.234	Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative
169.854	for the other 19,900-plus species
173.023	because there's something about honeybees
175.664	that draws people into their world.
178.513	Humans have been drawn to honeybees
180.96	since early recorded history,
182.676	mostly to harvest their honey,
184.152	which is an amazing natural sweetener.
187.611	I got drawn into the honeybee world
189.399	completely by a fluke.
191.484	I was 18 years old and bored,
193.806	and I picked up a book in the library on bees
196.668	and I spent the night reading it.
198.91	I had never thought about insects
200.837	living in complex societies.
202.56	It was like the best of science fiction come true.
205.962	And even stranger, there were these people,
208.856	these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,
212.847	and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.
216.15	So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,
218.635	a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.
222.832	And I was permanently hooked.
226.239	Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,
229.553	where the colony is the organism
231.709	and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000
234.441	individual bee organisms.
237.369	Now this society has no central authority.
240.701	Nobody's in charge.
242.297	So how they come to collective decisions,
244.642	and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,
247.622	how they communicate where the flowers are,
250.104	all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.
254.268	My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,
258.036	is their system of healthcare.
259.981	So bees have social healthcare.
263.466	So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.
267.736	For example, we study hygiene,
270.075	where some bees are able to locate and weed out
272.961	sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,
276.128	and it keeps the colony healthy.
278.592	And more recently, we've been studying resins
282.019	that bees collect from plants.
284.128	So bees fly to some plants and they scrape
287.311	these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,
289.967	and they take them back to the nest
291.545	where they cement them into the nest architecture
294.411	where we call it propolis.
296.936	We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.
301.558	It's a natural antibiotic.
303.502	It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs
306.681	within the colony,
308.283	and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
312.246	Humans have known about the power of propolis
315.537	since biblical times.
317.184	We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies
320.534	for human medicine,
322.586	but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.
326.25	So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses
330.303	that have kept them healthy and thriving
332.992	for over 50 million years.
337.249	So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies
340.598	were reported to be dying en masse,
342.397	first in the United States,
344.369	it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.
348.182	In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,
351.668	we know we can't afford to lose bees.
354.854	So what's going on?
357.969	Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,
362.058	and I'll go through each of these.
364.54	The bottom line is,
366.393	bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape
370.445	and a dysfunctional food system.
373.934	Now we have the best data on honeybees,
375.926	so I'll use them as an example.
377.782	In the United States, bees in fact have been
381.275	in decline since World War II.
384.139	We have half the number of managed hives
386.413	in the United States now compared to 1945.
389.427	We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.
393.078	And the reason is, after World War II,
395.824	we changed our farming practices.
399.152	We stopped planting cover crops.
401.991	We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,
404.734	which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,
408.58	and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.
412.184	Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.
417.728	And after World War II, we started using herbicides
421.182	to kill off the weeds in our farms.
423.679	Many of these weeds are flowering plants
426.46	that bees require for their survival.
429.393	And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.
434.964	Now we talk about food deserts,
437.529	places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.
441.779	The very farms that used to sustain bees
445.822	are now agricultural food deserts,
448.578	dominated by one or two plant species
451.001	like corn and soybeans.
453.59	Since World War II, we have been systematically
456.495	eliminating many of the flowering plants
459.394	that bees need for their survival.
462.946	And these monocultures extend even to crops
465.844	that are good for bees, like almonds.
468.391	Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,
472.377	hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,
475.388	and also because the pollen in an almond blossom
479.32	is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.
483.5	Now, the scale of almond monoculture
487.497	demands that most of our nation's bees,
490.049	over 1.5 million hives of bees,
492.785	be transported across the nation
495.777	to pollinate this one crop.
498.128	And they're trucked in in semi-loads,
500.773	and they must be trucked out,
503.103	because after bloom, the almond orchards
505.842	are a vast and flowerless landscape.
511.052	Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,
513.518	and we're planting more crops that need them.
517.323	There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production
521.507	that requires bee pollination.
525.311	And then there's pesticides.
528.337	After World War II, we started using pesticides
531.681	on a large scale, and this became necessary
534.245	because of the monocultures that put out a feast
538.039	for crop pests.
540.332	Recently, researchers from Penn State University
543.273	have started looking at the pesticide residue
546.57	in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,
550.12	and they've found that every batch of pollen
553.711	that a honeybee collects
555.718	has at least six detectable pesticides in it,
559.505	and this includes every class of insecticides,
563.548	herbicides, fungicides,
566.391	and even inert and unlabeled ingredients
569.971	that are part of the pesticide formulation
572.543	that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.
576.765	This small bee is holding up a large mirror.
582.407	How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?
586.855	One of these class of insecticides,
589.835	the neonicontinoids,
591.21	is making headlines around the world right now.
593.47	You've probably heard about it.
594.916	This is a new class of insecticides.
596.974	It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,
600.133	a leaf-eating insect,
601.576	would take a bite of the plant
602.81	and get a lethal dose and die.
606.15	If one of these neonics, we call them,
608.973	is applied in a high concentration,
611.427	such as in this ground application,
613.689	enough of the compound moves through the plant
616.157	and gets into the pollen and the nectar,
618.369	where a bee can consume, in this case,
620.473	a high dose of this neurotoxin
623.491	that makes the bee twitch and die.
627.64	In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,
630.813	it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,
634.756	and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant
637.747	and gets into the pollen and nectar,
639.715	and if a bee consumes this lower dose,
642.258	either nothing happens
643.6	or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented
647.188	and she may not find her way home.
650.9	And on top of everything else, bees have
653.032	their own set of diseases and parasites.
655.3	Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.
658.16	It's called varroa destructor.
660.465	It's aptly named.
661.569	It's this big, blood-sucking parasite
664.181	that compromises the bee's immune system
666.555	and circulates viruses.
669.326	Let me put this all together for you.
672.255	I don't know what it feels like to a bee
674.922	to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,
677.623	and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,
680.762	but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,
685.89	and I know how difficult it is for me to get
689.122	to the grocery store to get good nutrition.
691.911	But what if I lived in a food desert?
694.957	And what if I had to travel a long distance
697.452	to get to the grocery store,
699.325	and I finally got my weak body out there
702.199	and I consumed, in my food,
704.343	enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,
707.144	that I couldn't find my way home?
709.9	And this is what we mean by multiple
713.087	and interacting causes of death.
716.79	And it's not just our honeybees.
718.979	All of our beautiful wild species of bees
721.854	are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.
726.025	These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.
729.576	They're providing the pollination insurance
731.626	alongside our honeybees.
733.244	We need all of our bees.
735.667	So what are we going to do?
738.208	What are we going to do about this big bee bummer
740.622	that we've created?
742.885	It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.
746.702	Every one of you out there can help bees
750.285	in two very direct and easy ways.
754.75	Plant bee-friendly flowers,
757.705	and don't contaminate these flowers,
759.838	this bee food, with pesticides.
762.5	So go online and search for flowers
765.834	that are native to your area and plant them.
769.246	Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.
771.369	Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,
773.943	in your boulevards.
775.473	Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,
779.086	community spaces, meadows.
781.667	Set aside farmland.
783.416	We need a beautiful diversity of flowers
786.116	that blooms over the entire growing season,
788.287	from spring to fall.
790.181	We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,
793.879	but also for migrating butterflies and birds
797.333	and other wildlife.
799.309	And we need to think carefully about putting back in
802.749	cover crops to nourish our soil
805.934	and nourish our bees.
808.955	And we need to diversify our farms.
812.218	We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows
816	to disrupt the agricultural food desert
819.856	and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system
823.146	that we've created.
825.377	So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure
828.761	to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --
831.779	but when bees have access to good nutrition,
834.807	we have access to good nutrition
836.993	through their pollination services.
839.408	And when bees have access to good nutrition,
841.944	they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,
845.543	their healthcare,
846.961	that they have relied on for millions of years.
851.059	So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,
855.908	is that every one of us needs to behave
860.358	a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,
865.138	where each of our individual actions
868.17	can contribute to a grand solution,
871.276	an emergent property,
872.963	that's much greater than the mere sum
874.944	of our individual actions.
877.689	So let the small act of planting flowers
882.839	and keeping them free of pesticides
886.166	be the driver of large-scale change.
890.381	On behalf of the bees, thank you.
893.417	(Applause)
897.54	Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.
901.508	The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,
904.664	is there any sign of things bottoming out?
906.892	What's your hope/depression level on this?
909.671	Maria Spivak: Yeah.
910.285	At least in the United States,
912.238	an average of 30 percent of all bee hives
914.59	are lost every winter.
916.717	About 20 years ago,
918.522	we were at a 15-percent loss.
920.858	So it's getting precarious.
922.979	CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's --
922.979	MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.
925.586	CA: Thirty percent a year.
925.586	MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies
929.14	and so they can maintain the same number,
931.79	they can recuperate some of their loss.
934.111	We're kind of at a tipping point.
935.729	We can't really afford to lose that many more.
938.598	We need to be really appreciative
940.418	of all the beekeepers out there. Plant flowers.
943.771	CA: Thank you.
944.921	(Applause)
