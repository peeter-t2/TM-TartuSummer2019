12.747	The year is 1800.
15.07	A curious little invention is being talked about.
18.126	It's called a microscope.
21.207	What it allows you to do
22.986	is see tiny little lifeforms
25.628	that are invisible to the naked eye.
28.115	Soon comes the medical discovery
30.143	that many of these lifeforms are actually causes
33.228	of terrible human diseases.
35.419	Imagine what happened to the society
38.204	when they realized
40.192	that an English mom in her teacup
43.008	actually was drinking a monster soup,
46.144	not very far from here. This is from London.
49.293	Fast forward 200 years.
52.135	We still have this monster soup around,
54.267	and it's taken hold in the developing countries
57.122	around the tropical belt.
59.538	Just for malaria itself,
62.101	there are a million deaths a year,
64.546	and more than a billion people
66.292	that need to be tested because they are at risk
68.94	for different species of malarial infections.
72.175	Now it's actually very simple to put a face
74.986	to many of these monsters.
76.781	You take a stain, like acridine orange
79.408	or a fluorescent stain or Giemsa,
81.525	and a microscope, and you look at them.
84.638	They all have faces.
87.018	Why is that so, that Alex in Kenya,
89.656	Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjoot in Mumbai,
92.884	and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months
96.305	to be able to diagnose why they are sick?
99.884	And that's primarily because scalability
102.91	of the diagnostics is completely out of reach.
105.942	And remember that number: one billion.
109.858	The problem lies with the microscope itself.
113.759	Even though the pinnacle of modern science,
116.135	research microscopes are
116.135	not designed for field testing.
119.27	Neither were they first designed
120.95	for diagnostics at all.
123.101	They are heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain,
126.489	and cost a lot of money.
128.79	This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the '40s
132.195	using the exact same setup
132.195	that we actually use today
135.489	for diagnosing T.B. in his ashram
138.173	in Sevagram in India.
140.618	Two of my students, Jim and James,
143.945	traveled around India and Thailand,
146.265	starting to think about this problem a lot.
148.517	We saw all kinds of donated equipment.
150.992	We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.
153.904	And we saw people who had a functional microscope
156.099	but just didn't know how to even turn it on.
159.05	What grew out of that work and that trip
161.69	was actually the idea of what we call Foldscopes.
165.441	So what is a Foldscope?
167.264	A Foldscope is a completely functional microscope,
170.813	a platform for fluorescence, bright-field,
173.943	polarization, projection,
175.518	all kinds of advanced microscopy
178.086	built purely by folding paper.
181.301	So, now you think, how is that possible?
184.162	I'm going to show you some examples here,
186.125	and we will run through some of them.
187.926	It starts with a single sheet of paper.
191.71	What you see here is all the possible components
195.081	to build a functional bright-field
195.081	and fluorescence microscope.
199.506	So, there are three stages:
201.315	There is the optical stage, the illumination stage
204.064	and the mask-holding stage.
206.532	And there are micro optics at the bottom
208.404	that's actually embedded in the paper itself.
211.278	What you do is, you take it on,
213.782	and just like you are playing like a toy,
216.558	which it is,
220.584	I tab it off,
227.039	and I break it off.
229.221	This paper has no instructions and no languages.
231.945	There is a code, a color code embedded,
234.264	that tells you exactly how to
234.264	fold that specific microscope.
238.875	When it's done, it looks something like this,
241.524	has all the functionalities of a standard microscope,
244.255	just like an XY stage,
246.136	a place where a sample slide could go,
250.557	for example right here.
253.097	We didn't want to change this,
254.609	because this is the standard
255.981	that's been optimized for over the years,
257.834	and many health workers are actually used to this.
260.53	So this is what changes,
261.991	but the standard stains all remain the same
264.158	for many different diseases.
265.933	You pop this in.
268.865	There is an XY stage,
272.751	and then there is a focusing stage,
274.724	which is a flexure mechanism
276.59	that's built in paper itself that allows us to move
279.143	and focus the lenses by micron steps.
282.124	So what's really interesting about this object,
284.257	and my students hate when I do this,
286.14	but I'm going to do this anyway,
287.901	is these are rugged devices.
289.857	I can turn it on and throw it on the floor
294.434	and really try to stomp on it.
297.386	And they last, even though they're designed
299.761	from a very flexible material, like paper.
303.224	Another fun fact is, this is what we actually
306.076	send out there as a standard diagnostic tool,
310.131	but here in this envelope
311.9	I have 30 different foldscopes
314.291	of different configurations all in a single folder.
320.022	And I'm going to pick one randomly.
321.834	This one, it turns out, is actually designed
323.916	specifically for malaria,
325.479	because it has the fluorescent filters built
327.79	specifically for diagnosing malaria.
329.887	So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes
333.815	comes out of this.
335.581	So up till now, you didn't actually see
338.52	what I would see from one of these setups.
341.477	So what I would like to do is,
343.158	if we could dim the lights, please,
344.784	it turns out foldscopes are
344.784	also projection microscopes.
348.449	I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn --
350.983	go to the back of the wall --
352.736	and just project, and this way you will see
354.444	exactly what I would see.
356.564	What you're looking at --
358.35	(Applause) —
360.733	This is a cross-section of a compound eye,
363.369	and when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there,
365.72	I am going through the z-axis.
367.964	You actually see how the lenses are cut together
370.988	in the cross-section pattern.
372.561	Another example, one of my favorite insects,
375.117	I love to hate this one,
377.094	is a mosquito,
378.875	and you're seeing the antenna of a culex pipiens.
382.637	Right there.
386	All from the simple setup that I actually described.
390.213	So my wife has been field testing
391.986	some of our microscopes
393.986	by washing my clothes whenever I forget them
396.467	in the dryer.
398.496	So it turns out they're waterproof, and --
401.296	(Laughter) —
403.084	right here is just fluorescent water,
405.582	and I don't know if you can actually see this.
407.132	This also shows you how 
407.132	the projection scope works.
409.521	You get to see the beam the 
409.521	way it's projected and bent.
416.199	Can we get the lights back on again?
419.139	So I'm quickly going to show you,
420.926	since I'm running out of time,
422.975	in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture,
425.401	the biggest idea was roll-to-roll manufacturing,
428.481	so we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.
431.603	(Applause)
434.462	And what this allows us to do
436.557	is to think about a new paradigm in microscopy,
438.893	which we call use-and-throw microscopy.
440.91	I'm going to give you a quick snapshot
442.999	of some of the parts that go in.
444.762	Here is a sheet of paper.
446.221	This is when we were thinking about the idea.
448.31	This is an A4 sheet of paper.
449.665	These are the three stages that you actually see.
451.646	And the optical components, if you
451.646	look at the inset up on the right,
455.076	we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses
457.503	in paper itself at really high throughputs,
459.815	so it uses a process of self-assembly
461.674	and surface tension
462.786	to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.
466.322	So that's where the lenses go.
467.767	There are some light sources.
469.379	And essentially, in the end,
470.764	all the parts line up because of origami,
473.942	because of the fact that origami allows us
477.213	micron-scale precision of optical alignment.
480.193	So even though this looks like a simple toy,
482.822	the aspects of engineering that go in
484.736	something like this are fairly sophisticated.
487.422	So here is another obvious thing that we would do,
490.657	typically, if I was going to show
492.25	that these microscopes are robust,
493.755	is go to the third floor and
493.755	drop it from the floor itself.
497.593	There it is, and it survives.
500.916	So for us, the next step actually
503.093	is really finishing our field trials.
504.932	We are starting at the end of the summer.
507.037	We are at a stage where we'll be 
507.037	making thousands of microscopes.
509.964	That would be the first time where we would be
512.108	doing field trials with the highest density
514.193	of microscopes ever at a given place.
516.748	We've started collecting data for malaria,
518.828	Chagas disease and giardia from patients themselves.
522.624	And I want to leave you with this picture.
524.718	I had not anticipated this before,
526.643	but a really interesting link
528.33	between hands-on science education
530.225	and global health.
531.483	What are the tools that we're actually providing
534.409	the kids who are going to fight
536.589	this monster soup for tomorrow?
538.507	I would love for them to be able to just print out
540.865	a Foldscope and carry them around in their pockets.
542.994	Thank you.
545.9	(Applause)
