12.76	I'm often asked
14.68	why I do art,
17	what do I want to say
17	with my art photography,
19.96	and what is the use of it?
22.36	Once in a while I start to worry
25.04	how to actually measure
25.04	the impact from the art
29.72	like we do with medicine or technology,
33.04	where we can see the results
33.04	and calculate it.
36.76	Then I would finally be able
36.76	to explain to my mother my art
41.64	with real numbers.
44.08	But my art is so far from metrics,
47.44	and moreover, my photography
47.44	is widely exposing the theme of escapism.
54.64	My theory is that all of us
57.8	struggle sometimes to escape
60.68	in order to analyze our reality,
63.48	appreciate it or change.
66.8	I don't work with daily life as it is,
69.92	and I'm not a documentary photographer
73.28	in the common sense.
75.6	But I am a documentary photographer
78.64	in a different sense.
80.36	I document dreams.
83.6	I work with daily life as it could be,
86.16	as I imagine it.
88.2	I am a daydreamer, but at the same time
88.2	I love things that are authentic
94.36	and deal with our innermost nature,
97.8	which I would never want to escape from.
100.92	I adore complicated personalities,
103.56	and real life inspires me
103.56	to create my images.
108.48	Real life inspires our escape,
112.2	and sometimes that escape is very needed.
117.24	I believe heroes are not created easily,
121.12	and I choose to work with individuals
123.72	who are survivors
125.68	and facing everyday routines
128.16	that are not always full of color,
131.04	people who are on their way
131.04	to a better life,
134.44	fighting against life circumstances.
138.72	Why do I choose people
138.72	like that for my models?
141.919	Because I've been in that position myself,
144.6	when I had to learn
144.6	how to survive in real life.
148.84	I was a student living abroad in London.
152	I was working at two places
152	at the same time as a waitress.
156.48	Obviously that wasn't my dream job,
159.52	but I decided to play a game
162.36	where I imagined
162.36	that I am taking a role in a film,
167	and in the film I am a waitress,
170.12	and I need to act great.
172.52	I used to dye my hair
172.52	and brows to gingerette,
176.72	I changed my hair to curly perm,
179.28	I lost weight
180.64	and made myself believe
183.16	I am just a character acting in a film.
187.28	That isn't forever,
188.56	that is all just temporary.
191.4	That helped me a lot.
192.84	It motivated me to change my life
195.52	and take a hard time as a game.
199.24	Now, as an artist,
201.96	I am creating different
201.96	lives for my models
204.88	in order to give them the experience
204.88	of being someone else in reality.
210.36	Through the photographic process,
212.64	all of my models
212.64	become like silent movie actors.
216.96	They are captured at the moment
218.88	when they believe
218.88	in being someone else entirely.
223.28	In order to create
223.28	a new reality in its entirety,
226.84	I physically create
226.84	every single thing in my work,
230.76	sometimes from outfits to the stage.
233.76	Because I work with analogues,
235.6	and I don't make any digital
235.6	manipulations to my photographs,
239.72	I need everything
239.72	to take place in reality,
243.72	in spite of the fact that nowadays,
246.04	digitally, you can create
246.04	pretty much everything.
250.4	I don't like this path.
252.28	Even if that reaches perfection,
254.56	I see the beauty
254.56	in authenticity of making,
258.36	and that's impossible without flaws.
261.88	A digitally manipulated photograph
264.32	is not true for me.
266	It doesn't capture anything real.
268.72	It's not experienced, not motivating.
272.48	It's like, instead of going traveling,
274.84	you look at someone else's
274.84	travel photographs.
279	What I find so exciting
281.24	is the ability to make people's dreams
281.24	of being someone else a reality.
287.72	That's like a drug
289.32	which pushes me to keep working,
291.52	even without metrics.
295.12	One of my models
297.04	had always dreamed
297.04	of being seen as a warrior,
301.32	but she wasn't able to do sports
301.32	because of her health problems.
306.12	Half a year ago, she passed away
308.32	from heart disease at the age of 22.
313.16	But two days before her death,
315.28	the images we spent months
315.28	working on together
319.6	of her as a warrior
319.6	she dreamed of becoming
323.76	were published at a large exhibition
323.76	in Milan by Vogue Magazine.
329.6	All her life was about overcoming.
333.8	Before she died, she had known
335.84	that thousands of people
335.84	saw her image from the land of escapism
341	and believed in her
341	as a brave and fearless warrior.
347.56	For my work, I invite people
347.56	to play a game
351.2	like we all used to as children
353.88	when we pretend to be someone else
355.96	and that process made us really happy.
359.52	To my mind it is important for grown-ups.
363.72	We need these transformations
365.8	to enact this in the name of art.
368.88	It gives us the very real feeling
368.88	of being important and powerful
374.36	in order to influence our reality.
378.2	I know this from
378.2	my own personal experience.
382.08	I have had so many versions of myself
385.64	through my self-portraits
387.76	that I've been many different characters.
393.04	Being someone else in the land of escapism
396.92	doesn't exactly give us numbers
396.92	that we can gauge,
401	but it's like a real lost form of magic
404.68	which exists but can't be measured.
407.8	There is a unique power in art
410.36	to transform and lift our limits.
414	Art creates what I call a conjured life,
417.64	which helps our existence
420.24	and pushes, motivates
420.24	and inspires us to dwell
424.8	and express ourselves
427.36	without metrics or calculations.
430.48	Thank you.
431.72	(Applause)
