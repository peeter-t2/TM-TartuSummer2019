12.597	One of my earliest memories
14.362	is of trying to wake up
14.362	one of my relatives and not being able to.
17.482	And I was just a little kid,
17.482	so I didn't really understand why,
20.459	but as I got older,
21.793	I realized we had
21.793	drug addiction in my family,
23.96	including later cocaine addiction.
25.818	I'd been thinking about it a lot lately,
25.818	partly because it's now exactly 100 years
30.621	since drugs were first banned
30.621	in the United States and Britain,
33.691	and we then imposed that
33.691	on the rest of the world.
36.23	It's a century since we made
36.23	this really fateful decision
39.75	to take addicts and punish them
39.75	and make them suffer,
43.827	because we believed that would deter them;
43.827	it would give them an incentive to stop.
48.238	And a few years ago, I was looking at
48.238	some of the addicts in my life who I love,
53.231	and trying to figure out
53.231	if there was some way to help them.
56.644	And I realized there were loads
56.644	of incredibly basic questions
59.918	I just didn't know the answer to,
61.752	like, what really causes addiction?
64.192	Why do we carry on with this approach
64.192	that doesn't seem to be working,
67.632	and is there a better way out there
67.632	that we could try instead?
70.561	So I read loads of stuff about it,
72.275	and I couldn't really find
72.275	the answers I was looking for,
74.966	so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit
74.966	with different people around the world
78.526	who lived this and studied this
80.214	and talk to them and see
80.214	if I could learn from them.
82.779	And I didn't realize I would end up
82.779	going over 30,000 miles at the start,
86.28	but I ended up going and meeting
86.28	loads of different people,
89.188	from a transgender crack dealer
89.188	in Brownsville, Brooklyn,
91.967	to a scientist who spends a lot of time
91.967	feeding hallucinogens to mongooses
95.545	to see if they like them --
96.855	it turns out they do, but only
96.855	in very specific circumstances --
99.96	to the only country that's ever
99.96	decriminalized all drugs,
102.755	from cannabis to crack, Portugal.
105.134	And the thing I realized
105.134	that really blew my mind is,
107.735	almost everything we think
107.735	we know about addiction is wrong,
111.543	and if we start to absorb
111.543	the new evidence about addiction,
114.654	I think we're going to have to change
114.654	a lot more than our drug policies.
118.1	But let's start with what we think
118.1	we know, what I thought I knew.
121.525	Let's think about this middle row here.
123.63	Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went
123.63	off and used heroin three times a day.
127.416	Some of you look a little more
127.416	enthusiastic than others at this prospect.
130.885	(Laughter)
131.914	Don't worry,
131.914	it's just a thought experiment.
134.18	Imagine you did that, right?
136.243	What would happen?
137.428	Now, we have a story about what would
137.428	happen that we've been told for a century.
141.245	We think, because there are
141.245	chemical hooks in heroin,
143.766	as you took it for a while,
145.553	your body would become
145.553	dependent on those hooks,
148.131	you'd start to physically need them,
149.919	and at the end of those 20 days,
149.919	you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
153.267	That's what I thought.
154.523	First thing that alerted me to the fact
154.523	that something's not right with this story
158.405	is when it was explained to me.
160.083	If I step out of this TED Talk today
160.083	and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,
163.822	I'll be taken to hospital
163.822	and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.
167.159	Diamorphine is heroin.
168.745	It's actually much better heroin
168.745	than you're going to buy on the streets,
172.203	because the stuff you buy
172.203	from a drug dealer is contaminated.
175.159	Actually, very little of it is heroin,
177.007	whereas the stuff you get
177.007	from the doctor is medically pure.
179.847	And you'll be given it for quite
179.847	a long period of time.
182.443	There are loads of people in this room,
184.325	you may not realize it,
184.325	you've taken quite a lot of heroin.
187.31	And anyone who is watching this
187.31	anywhere in the world, this is happening.
190.887	And if what we believe
190.887	about addiction is right --
193.264	those people are exposed
193.264	to all those chemical hooks --
195.86	What should happen?
195.86	They should become addicts.
198.094	This has been studied really carefully.
200.06	It doesn't happen; you will have noticed
200.06	if your grandmother had a hip replacement,
203.989	she didn't come out as a junkie.
203.989	(Laughter)
206.037	And when I learned this,
206.037	it seemed so weird to me,
209.65	so contrary to everything I'd been told,
209.65	everything I thought I knew,
213.18	I just thought it couldn't be right,
213.18	until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.
216.995	He's a professor
216.995	of psychology in Vancouver
219.617	who carried out an incredible experiment
221.556	I think really helps us
221.556	to understand this issue.
223.942	Professor Alexander explained to me,
225.704	the idea of addiction we've all
225.704	got in our heads, that story,
228.665	comes partly from a series of experiments
230.716	that were done earlier
230.716	in the 20th century.
232.826	They're really simple.
234.156	You can do them tonight at home
234.156	if you feel a little sadistic.
237.16	You get a rat and you put it in a cage,
237.16	and you give it two water bottles:
240.741	One is just water, and the other is water
240.741	laced with either heroin or cocaine.
244.509	If you do that, the rat will almost always
244.509	prefer the drug water
247.541	and almost always
247.541	kill itself quite quickly.
249.703	So there you go, right?
249.703	That's how we think it works.
252.204	In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes
252.204	along and he looks at this experiment
255.8	and he noticed something.
257.08	He said ah, we're putting
257.08	the rat in an empty cage.
259.583	It's got nothing to do
259.583	except use these drugs.
261.84	Let's try something different.
263.379	So Professor Alexander built a cage
263.379	"that he called ""Rat Park,"""
266.331	which is basically heaven for rats.
268.871	They've got loads of cheese,
268.871	they've got loads of colored balls,
271.974	they've got loads of tunnels.
273.382	Crucially, they've got loads of friends.
273.382	They can have loads of sex.
276.597	And they've got both the water bottles,
276.597	the normal water and the drugged water.
281.411	But here's the fascinating thing:
284.12	In Rat Park, they don't
284.12	like the drug water.
287.602	They almost never use it.
289.315	None of them ever use it compulsively.
291.892	None of them ever overdose.
293.317	You go from almost 100 percent overdose
293.317	when they're isolated
296.731	to zero percent overdose when they
296.731	have happy and connected lives.
299.981	Now, when he first saw this,
299.981	Professor Alexander thought,
303.251	maybe this is just a thing about rats,
303.251	they're quite different to us.
306.514	Maybe not as different as we'd like,
306.514	but, you know --
309.015	But fortunately, there was
309.015	a human experiment
311.15	into the exact same principle happening
311.15	at the exact same time.
314.279	It was called the Vietnam War.
316.281	In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American
316.281	troops were using loads of heroin,
320.888	and if you look at the news
320.888	reports from the time,
323.52	they were really worried, because
323.52	they thought, my God, we're going to have
327.202	hundreds of thousands of junkies
327.202	on the streets of the United States
330.426	when the war ends; it made total sense.
332.366	Now, those soldiers who were using
332.366	loads of heroin were followed home.
335.676	The Archives of General Psychiatry
335.676	did a really detailed study,
338.654	and what happened to them?
340.582	It turns out they didn't go to rehab.
340.582	They didn't go into withdrawal.
344.166	Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.
347.476	Now, if you believe the story
347.476	about chemical hooks,
349.901	that makes absolutely no sense,
349.901	but Professor Alexander began to think
353.389	there might be a different
353.389	story about addiction.
355.72	He said, what if addiction isn't
355.72	about your chemical hooks?
358.585	What if addiction is about your cage?
361.255	What if addiction is an adaptation
361.255	to your environment?
364.393	Looking at this,
365.547	there was another professor
365.547	called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands
368.669	who said, maybe we shouldn't
368.669	even call it addiction.
371.14	Maybe we should call it bonding.
372.888	Human beings have a natural
372.888	and innate need to bond,
375.811	and when we're happy and healthy,
375.811	we'll bond and connect with each other,
379.389	but if you can't do that,
382.043	because you're traumatized or isolated
382.043	or beaten down by life,
385.867	you will bond with something
385.867	that will give you some sense of relief.
389.19	Now, that might be gambling,
389.19	that might be pornography,
391.786	that might be cocaine,
391.786	that might be cannabis,
393.962	but you will bond and connect
393.962	with something because that's our nature.
397.616	That's what we want as human beings.
400.356	And at first, I found this quite
400.356	a difficult thing to get my head around,
403.868	but one way that helped me
403.868	to think about it is,
406.323	I can see, I've got over by my seat
406.323	a bottle of water, right?
409.736	I'm looking at lots of you, and lots
409.736	of you have bottles of water with you.
413.284	Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.
415.123	Totally legally, all of those bottles
415.123	of water could be bottles of vodka, right?
419.79	We could all be getting drunk --
419.79	I might after this -- (Laughter) --
423.5	but we're not.
424.676	Now, because you've been able to afford
424.676	the approximately gazillion pounds
428.177	that it costs to get into a TED Talk,
428.177	I'm guessing you guys could afford
431.582	to be drinking vodka
431.582	for the next six months.
433.96	You wouldn't end up homeless.
435.931	You're not going to do that,
435.931	and the reason you're not going to do that
439.556	is not because anyone's stopping you.
441.459	It's because you've got
441.459	bonds and connections
443.676	that you want to be present for.
445.224	You've got work you love.
445.224	You've got people you love.
447.725	You've got healthy relationships.
449.77	And a core part of addiction,
452.44	I came to think, and I believe
452.44	the evidence suggests,
454.941	is about not being able to bear
454.941	to be present in your life.
458.779	Now, this has really
458.779	significant implications.
461.142	The most obvious implications
461.142	are for the War on Drugs.
464.3	In Arizona, I went out
464.3	with a group of women
467.86	who were made to wear t-shirts
467.86	"saying, ""I was a drug addict,"""
471.718	and go out on chain gangs and dig graves
471.718	while members of the public jeer at them,
476.495	and when those women get out of prison,
476.495	they're going to have criminal records
480.195	that mean they'll never work
480.195	in the legal economy again.
482.839	Now, that's a very extreme example,
482.839	obviously, in the case of the chain gang,
486.56	but actually almost
486.56	everywhere in the world
488.65	we treat addicts to some degree like that.
490.674	We punish them. We shame them.
490.674	We give them criminal records.
493.556	We put barriers between them reconnecting.
496.315	There was a doctor in Canada,
496.315	Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,
499.318	who said to me, if you wanted to design
499.318	a system that would make addiction worse,
503.213	you would design that system.
504.844	Now, there's a place that decided
504.844	to do the exact opposite,
507.724	and I went there to see how it worked.
509.581	In the year 2000, Portugal had
509.581	one of the worst drug problems in Europe.
513	One percent of the population was addicted
513	to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,
516.999	and every year, they tried
516.999	the American way more and more.
519.791	They punished people and stigmatized them
519.791	and shamed them more,
522.768	and every year, the problem got worse.
524.611	And one day, the Prime Minister and
524.611	the leader of the opposition got together,
528.346	and basically said, look, we can't go on
530.349	with a country where we're having
530.349	ever more people becoming heroin addicts.
533.902	Let's set up a panel
533.902	of scientists and doctors
536.085	to figure out what would
536.085	genuinely solve the problem.
538.591	And they set up a panel led by
538.591	an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,
541.864	to look at all this new evidence,
543.514	and they came back and they said,
545.11	"""Decriminalize all drugs"
545.11	"from cannabis to crack, but"" --"
549.43	and this is the crucial next step --
551.724	"""take all the money we used to spend"
551.724	on cutting addicts off,
555.369	on disconnecting them,
556.79	and spend it instead
556.79	"on reconnecting them with society."""
560.454	And that's not really what we think of
560.454	as drug treatment
565.05	in the United States and Britain.
566.932	So they do do residential rehab,
568.537	they do psychological therapy,
568.537	that does have some value.
571.369	But the biggest thing they did
571.369	was the complete opposite of what we do:
574.776	a massive program
574.776	of job creation for addicts,
577.294	and microloans for addicts
577.294	to set up small businesses.
579.914	So say you used to be a mechanic.
581.579	When you're ready, they'll go
581.579	to a garage, and they'll say,
584.4	if you employ this guy for a year,
584.4	we'll pay half his wages.
587.311	The goal was to make sure
587.311	that every addict in Portugal
590.068	had something to get out
590.068	of bed for in the morning.
592.473	And when I went and met the addicts
592.473	in Portugal,
595.668	what they said is,
595.668	as they rediscovered purpose,
597.946	they rediscovered bonds
597.946	and relationships with the wider society.
601.075	It'll be 15 years this year
601.075	since that experiment began,
603.719	and the results are in:
605.386	injecting drug use is down in Portugal,
607.268	according to the British
607.268	Journal of Criminology,
609.883	by 50 percent, five-zero percent.
612.47	Overdose is massively down,
612.47	HIV is massively down among addicts.
616.17	Addiction in every study
616.17	is significantly down.
618.545	One of the ways you know it's worked
618.545	so well is that almost nobody in Portugal
622.408	wants to go back to the old system.
624.113	Now, that's the political implications.
626.001	I actually think there's a layer
626.001	of implications
629.024	to all this research below that.
630.684	We live in a culture where people
630.684	feel really increasingly vulnerable
633.97	to all sorts of addictions,
633.97	whether it's to their smartphones
636.95	or to shopping or to eating.
638.308	Before these talks began --
638.308	you guys know this --
640.639	we were told we weren't allowed
640.639	to have our smartphones on,
643.503	and I have to say, a lot of you
643.503	looked an awful lot like
646.148	addicts who were told their dealer
646.148	was going to be unavailable
649.157	for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)
651.086	A lot of us feel like that,
651.086	and it might sound weird to say,
653.957	I've been talking about how disconnection
653.957	is a major driver of addiction
657.374	and weird to say it's growing,
658.827	because you think we're the most connected
658.827	society that's ever been, surely.
662.423	But I increasingly began to think
662.423	that the connections we have
665.48	or think we have, are like a kind
665.48	of parody of human connection.
668.504	If you have a crisis in your life,
668.504	you'll notice something.
671.365	It won't be your Twitter followers
671.365	who come to sit with you.
674.299	It won't be your Facebook friends
674.299	who help you turn it round.
677.181	It'll be your flesh and blood friends
677.181	who you have deep and nuanced
680.348	and textured, face-to-face
680.348	relationships with,
682.614	and there's a study I learned about from
682.614	Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,
687.173	that I think tells us a lot about this.
689.38	It looked at the number of close friends
689.38	the average American believes
692.778	they can call on in a crisis.
694.729	That number has been declining
694.729	steadily since the 1950s.
697.747	The amount of floor space
697.747	an individual has in their home
700.621	has been steadily increasing,
702.688	and I think that's like a metaphor
704.592	for the choice we've made as a culture.
706.474	We've traded floorspace for friends,
706.474	we've traded stuff for connections,
711.349	and the result is we are one of the
711.349	loneliest societies there has ever been.
714.97	And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did
714.97	the Rat Park experiment, says,
718.161	we talk all the time in addiction
718.161	about individual recovery,
721.732	and it's right to talk about that,
723.659	but we need to talk much more
723.659	about social recovery.
726.214	Something's gone wrong with us,
726.214	not just with individuals but as a group,
729.867	and we've created a society where,
729.867	for a lot of us,
732.3	life looks a whole lot more
732.3	like that isolated cage
734.785	and a whole lot less like Rat Park.
736.856	If I'm honest, this isn't
736.856	why I went into it.
739.912	I didn't go in to the discover
739.912	the political stuff, the social stuff.
743.242	I wanted to know how to help
743.242	the people I love.
745.605	And when I came back from this
745.605	long journey and I'd learned all this,
748.868	I looked at the addicts in my life,
751.6	and if you're really candid,
751.6	it's hard loving an addict,
756.13	and there's going to be lots of people
756.13	who know in this room.
759.012	You are angry a lot of the time,
761.26	and I think one of the reasons
761.26	why this debate is so charged
765.285	is because it runs through the heart
765.285	of each of us, right?
768.109	Everyone has a bit of them
768.109	that looks at an addict and thinks,
771.08	I wish someone would just stop you.
772.855	And the kind of scripts we're told for how
772.855	to deal with the addicts in our lives
776.641	is typified by, I think,
777.837	"the reality show ""Intervention,"""
777.837	if you guys have ever seen it.
780.814	I think everything in our lives
780.814	is defined by reality TV,
783.512	but that's another TED Talk.
784.981	If you've ever seen
784.981	"the show ""Intervention,"""
787.193	it's a pretty simple premise.
788.673	Get an addict, all the people
788.673	in their life, gather them together,
791.793	confront them with what they're doing,
791.793	and they say, if you don't shape up,
795.449	we're going to cut you off.
796.811	So what they do is they take
796.811	the connection to the addict,
799.55	and they threaten it,
799.55	they make it contingent
801.67	on the addict behaving the way they want.
804.072	And I began to think, I began to see
804.072	why that approach doesn't work,
807.823	and I began to think that's almost like
807.823	the importing of the logic of the Drug War
812.397	into our private lives.
814.278	So I was thinking,
814.278	how could I be Portuguese?
817.97	And what I've tried to do now,
817.97	and I can't tell you I do it consistently
821.499	and I can't tell you it's easy,
823.472	is to say to the addicts in my life
825.98	that I want to deepen
825.98	the connection with them,
828.23	to say to them, I love you
828.23	whether you're using or you're not.
831.924	I love you, whatever state you're in,
834.78	and if you need me,
834.78	I'll come and sit with you
837.195	because I love you and I don't
837.195	want you to be alone
839.819	or to feel alone.
841.839	And I think the core of that message --
843.905	you're not alone, we love you --
846.598	has to be at every level
846.598	of how we respond to addicts,
849.687	socially, politically and individually.
852.334	For 100 years now, we've been singing
852.334	war songs about addicts.
856.606	I think all along we should have been
856.606	singing love songs to them,
860.53	because the opposite of addiction
860.53	is not sobriety.
864.802	The opposite of addiction is connection.
868.657	Thank you.
870.63	(Applause)
