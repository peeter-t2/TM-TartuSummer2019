13.19	I'd like to introduce you
13.19	to an emerging area of science,
17.742	one that is still speculative
17.742	but hugely exciting,
21.709	and certainly one
21.709	that's growing very rapidly.
25.448	Quantum biology
25.448	asks a very simple question:
29.52	Does quantum mechanics --
30.894	that weird and wonderful
30.894	and powerful theory
34.22	of the subatomic world
34.22	of atoms and molecules
36.932	that underpins so much
36.932	of modern physics and chemistry --
40.444	also play a role inside the living cell?
43.88	In other words: Are there processes,
43.88	mechanisms, phenomena
47.983	in living organisms
47.983	that can only be explained
51.995	with a helping hand
51.995	from quantum mechanics?
55.546	Now, quantum biology isn't new;
57.207	it's been around since the early 1930s.
59.928	But it's only in the last decade or so
59.928	that careful experiments --
63.667	in biochemistry labs,
63.667	using spectroscopy --
67.155	have shown very clear, firm evidence
67.155	that there are certain specific mechanisms
74.042	that require quantum mechanics
74.042	to explain them.
77.674	Quantum biology brings together
77.674	quantum physicists, biochemists,
81.027	molecular biologists --
81.027	it's a very interdisciplinary field.
84.692	I come from quantum physics,
84.692	so I'm a nuclear physicist.
88.645	I've spent more than three decades
90.934	trying to get my head
90.934	around quantum mechanics.
93.887	One of the founders
93.887	of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,
96.404	said, If you're not astonished by it,
96.404	then you haven't understood it.
100.237	So I sort of feel happy
100.237	that I'm still astonished by it.
103.104	That's a good thing.
104.873	But it means I study the very
104.873	smallest structures in the universe --
111.782	the building blocks of reality.
113.881	If we think about the scale of size,
117.12	start with an everyday object
117.12	like the tennis ball,
120.096	and just go down orders
120.096	of magnitude in size --
123.021	from the eye of a needle down to a cell,
123.021	down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --
128.242	you eventually reach the nano-world.
129.995	Now, nanotechnology may be
129.995	a term you've heard of.
132.841	A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.
136.56	My area is the atomic nucleus,
136.56	which is the tiny dot inside an atom.
140.954	It's even smaller in scale.
142.91	This is the domain of quantum mechanics,
144.852	and physicists and chemists
144.852	have had a long time
147.392	to try and get used to it.
149.248	Biologists, on the other hand,
149.248	have got off lightly, in my view.
154.071	They are very happy with their
154.071	balls-and-sticks models of molecules.
158.426	(Laughter)
159.532	The balls are the atoms, the sticks
159.532	are the bonds between the atoms.
162.754	And when they can't build them
162.754	physically in the lab,
165.272	nowadays, they have
165.272	very powerful computers
167.688	that will simulate a huge molecule.
169.679	This is a protein made up
169.679	of 100,000 atoms.
174.003	It doesn't really require much in the way
174.003	of quantum mechanics to explain it.
179.695	Quantum mechanics
179.695	was developed in the 1920s.
182.965	It is a set of beautiful and powerful
182.965	mathematical rules and ideas
189.869	that explain the world of the very small.
192.501	And it's a world that's very different
192.501	from our everyday world,
195.897	made up of trillions of atoms.
197.44	It's a world built
197.44	on probability and chance.
201.818	It's a fuzzy world.
203.144	It's a world of phantoms,
204.898	where particles can also behave
204.898	like spread-out waves.
210.157	If we imagine quantum mechanics
210.157	or quantum physics, then,
213.043	as the fundamental
213.043	foundation of reality itself,
218.281	then it's not surprising that we say
220.035	quantum physics underpins
220.035	organic chemistry.
222.479	After all, it gives us
222.479	the rules that tell us
224.623	how the atoms fit together
224.623	to make organic molecules.
227.288	Organic chemistry,
227.288	scaled up in complexity,
230.551	gives us molecular biology,
230.551	which of course leads to life itself.
234.174	So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.
236.175	It's almost trivial.
237.413	"You say, ""Well, of course life ultimately"
237.413	"must depend of quantum mechanics."""
242.141	But so does everything else.
244.555	So does all inanimate matter,
244.555	made up of trillions of atoms.
248.501	Ultimately, there's a quantum level
253.403	where we have to delve into
253.403	this weirdness.
255.61	But in everyday life,
255.61	we can forget about it.
258.404	Because once you put together
258.404	trillions of atoms,
261.627	that quantum weirdness
261.627	just dissolves away.
267.288	Quantum biology isn't about this.
269.881	Quantum biology isn't this obvious.
272.461	Of course quantum mechanics
272.461	underpins life at some molecular level.
277.254	Quantum biology is about looking
277.254	for the non-trivial --
283.282	the counterintuitive ideas
283.282	in quantum mechanics --
287.782	and to see if they do, indeed,
287.782	play an important role
290.821	in describing the processes of life.
294.653	Here is my perfect example
294.653	of the counterintuitiveness
299.897	of the quantum world.
301.367	This is the quantum skier.
302.642	He seems to be intact,
302.642	he seems to be perfectly healthy,
305.306	and yet, he seems to have gone around
305.306	both sides of that tree at the same time.
309.457	Well, if you saw tracks like that
311.144	you'd guess it was some
311.144	sort of stunt, of course.
313.477	But in the quantum world,
313.477	this happens all the time.
316.864	Particles can multitask,
316.864	they can be in two places at once.
319.914	They can do more than one thing
319.914	at the same time.
322.266	Particles can behave
322.266	like spread-out waves.
325.298	It's almost like magic.
327.538	Physicists and chemists have had
327.538	nearly a century
330.311	of trying to get used to this weirdness.
333.445	I don't blame the biologists
334.819	for not having to or wanting
334.819	to learn quantum mechanics.
337.478	You see, this weirdness is very delicate;
340.7	and we physicists work very hard
340.7	to maintain it in our labs.
345.174	We cool our system down
345.174	to near absolute zero,
349.402	we carry out our experiments in vacuums,
351.371	we try and isolate it
351.371	from any external disturbance.
355.602	That's very different from the warm,
355.602	messy, noisy environment of a living cell.
361.96	Biology itself, if you think of
361.96	molecular biology,
364.771	seems to have done very well
364.771	in describing all the processes of life
368.252	in terms of chemistry --
368.252	chemical reactions.
370.762	And these are reductionist,
370.762	deterministic chemical reactions,
375.636	showing that, essentially, life is made
375.636	of the same stuff as everything else,
380.774	and if we can forget about quantum
380.774	mechanics in the macro world,
383.858	then we should be able to forget
383.858	about it in biology, as well.
387.706	Well, one man begged
387.706	to differ with this idea.
392.062	Erwin Schrödinger,
392.062	of Schrödinger's Cat fame,
395.555	was an Austrian physicist.
396.896	He was one of the founders
396.896	of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.
400.663	In 1944, he wrote a book
400.663	"called ""What is Life?"""
403.839	It was tremendously influential.
405.594	It influenced Francis Crick
405.594	and James Watson,
408.499	the discoverers of the double-helix
408.499	structure of DNA.
411.343	To paraphrase a description
411.343	in the book, he says:
415.035	At the molecular level,
415.035	living organisms have a certain order,
420.845	a structure to them that's very different
424.101	from the random thermodynamic jostling
424.101	of atoms and molecules
428.861	in inanimate matter
428.861	of the same complexity.
433.504	In fact, living matter seems to behave
433.504	in this order, in a structure,
438.542	just like inanimate matter
438.542	cooled down to near absolute zero,
442.4	where quantum effects
442.4	play a very important role.
446.28	There's something special
446.28	about the structure -- the order --
450.464	inside a living cell.
452.048	So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe
452.048	quantum mechanics plays a role in life.
458.096	It's a very speculative,
458.096	far-reaching idea,
461.545	and it didn't really go very far.
465.536	But as I mentioned at the start,
467.093	in the last 10 years, there have been
467.093	experiments emerging,
469.916	showing where some of these
469.916	certain phenomena in biology
473.995	do seem to require quantum mechanics.
475.782	I want to share with you
475.782	just a few of the exciting ones.
480.215	This is one of the best-known
480.215	phenomena in the quantum world,
483.946	quantum tunneling.
485.671	The box on the left shows
485.671	the wavelike, spread-out distribution
490.084	of a quantum entity --
490.084	a particle, like an electron,
492.869	which is not a little ball
492.869	bouncing off a wall.
496.53	It's a wave that has a certain probability
496.53	of being able to permeate
501.293	through a solid wall, like a phantom
501.293	leaping through to the other side.
504.723	You can see a faint smudge of light
504.723	in the right-hand box.
509.773	Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle
509.773	can hit an impenetrable barrier,
514.409	and yet somehow, as though by magic,
516.893	disappear from one side
516.893	and reappear on the other.
519.658	The nicest way of explaining it is
519.658	if you want to throw a ball over a wall,
523.933	you have to give it enough energy
523.933	to get over the top of the wall.
527.534	In the quantum world,
527.534	you don't have to throw it over the wall,
530.616	you can throw it at the wall,
530.616	and there's a certain non-zero probability
534.047	that it'll disappear on your side,
534.047	and reappear on the other.
537.394	This isn't speculation, by the way.
539.096	"We're happy -- well, ""happy"""
539.096	is not the right word --
542.516	(Laughter)
544.585	we are familiar with this.
546.227	(Laughter)
548.996	Quantum tunneling
548.996	takes place all the time;
551.314	in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.
554.655	The particles fuse together,
556.188	and the Sun turns hydrogen
556.188	into helium through quantum tunneling.
561.464	Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered
561.464	that quantum tunneling also takes place
566.708	inside living cells.
568.29	Enzymes, those workhorses of life,
568.29	the catalysts of chemical reactions --
574.58	enzymes are biomolecules that speed up
574.58	chemical reactions in living cells,
578.77	by many, many orders of magnitude.
580.497	And it's always been a mystery
580.497	how they do this.
583.65	Well, it was discovered
584.863	that one of the tricks that enzymes
584.863	have evolved to make use of,
589.739	is by transferring subatomic particles,
589.739	like electrons and indeed protons,
594.991	from one part of a molecule
594.991	to another via quantum tunneling.
600.333	It's efficient, it's fast,
600.333	it can disappear --
603.208	a proton can disappear from one place,
603.208	and reappear on the other.
606.343	Enzymes help this take place.
608.548	This is research that's been
608.548	carried out back in the 80s,
611.255	particularly by a group
611.255	in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.
615.316	Other groups in the UK
615.316	have now also confirmed
617.545	that enzymes really do this.
621.048	Research carried out by my group --
623.621	so as I mentioned,
623.621	I'm a nuclear physicist,
626.079	but I've realized I've got these tools
626.079	of using quantum mechanics
629.158	in atomic nuclei, and so can apply
629.158	those tools in other areas as well.
635.404	One question we asked
637.238	is whether quantum tunneling
637.238	plays a role in mutations in DNA.
641.843	Again, this is not a new idea;
641.843	it goes all the way back to the early 60s.
645.527	The two strands of DNA,
645.527	the double-helix structure,
648.512	are held together by rungs;
648.512	it's like a twisted ladder.
651.359	And those rungs of the ladder
651.359	are hydrogen bonds --
654.89	protons, that act as the glue
654.89	between the two strands.
658.704	So if you zoom in, what they're doing
658.704	is holding these large molecules --
663.478	nucleotides -- together.
666.13	Zoom in a bit more.
667.304	So, this a computer simulation.
669.855	The two white balls
669.855	in the middle are protons,
673.421	and you can see that
673.421	it's a double hydrogen bond.
675.744	One prefers to sit on one side;
675.744	the other, on the other side
679.082	of the two strands of the vertical lines
679.082	going down, which you can't see.
684.41	It can happen that
684.41	these two protons can hop over.
687.829	Watch the two white balls.
689.748	They can jump over to the other side.
692.239	If the two strands of DNA then separate,
692.239	leading to the process of replication,
697.909	and the two protons
697.909	are in the wrong positions,
701.132	this can lead to a mutation.
703.204	This has been known for half a century.
705.1	The question is: How likely
705.1	are they to do that,
707.467	and if they do, how do they do it?
709.869	Do they jump across,
709.869	like the ball going over the wall?
712.912	Or can they quantum-tunnel across,
712.912	even if they don't have enough energy?
717.089	Early indications suggest that
717.089	quantum tunneling can play a role here.
721.365	We still don't know yet
721.365	how important it is;
723.513	this is still an open question.
726.199	It's speculative,
727.373	but it's one of those questions
727.373	that is so important
730.04	that if quantum mechanics
730.04	plays a role in mutations,
732.51	surely this must have big implications,
734.833	to understand certain types of mutations,
737.551	possibly even those that lead
737.551	to turning a cell cancerous.
742.803	Another example of quantum mechanics
742.803	in biology is quantum coherence,
748.126	in one of the most
748.126	important processes in biology,
750.503	photosynthesis: plants
750.503	and bacteria taking sunlight,
754.468	and using that energy to create biomass.
758.215	Quantum coherence is the idea
758.215	of quantum entities multitasking.
762.912	It's the quantum skier.
764.54	It's an object that behaves like a wave,
767.516	so that it doesn't just move
767.516	in one direction or the other,
770.442	but can follow multiple pathways
770.442	at the same time.
774.708	Some years ago,
774.708	the world of science was shocked
778.648	when a paper was published
778.648	showing experimental evidence
782.256	that quantum coherence
782.256	takes place inside bacteria,
786.056	carrying out photosynthesis.
787.766	The idea is that the photon,
787.766	the particle of light, the sunlight,
790.854	the quantum of light
790.854	captured by a chlorophyll molecule,
794.222	is then delivered to what's called
794.222	the reaction center,
796.837	where it can be turned into
796.837	chemical energy.
798.925	And in getting there,
798.925	it doesn't just follow one route;
801.597	it follows multiple pathways at once,
803.836	to optimize the most efficient way
803.836	of reaching the reaction center
808.197	without dissipating as waste heat.
811.228	Quantum coherence taking place
811.228	inside a living cell.
814.561	A remarkable idea,
816.705	and yet evidence is growing almost weekly,
816.705	with new papers coming out,
822.964	confirming that this
822.964	does indeed take place.
825.555	My third and final example
825.555	is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.
830.318	It's also still very speculative,
830.318	but I have to share it with you.
834.405	The European robin
834.405	migrates from Scandinavia
839.041	down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,
841.7	and like a lot of other
841.7	marine animals and even insects,
845.097	they navigate by sensing
845.097	the Earth's magnetic field.
850.968	Now, the Earth's magnetic field
850.968	is very, very weak;
853.419	it's 100 times weaker
853.419	than a fridge magnet,
855.523	and yet it affects the chemistry --
855.523	somehow -- within a living organism.
861.932	That's not in doubt --
861.932	a German couple of ornithologists,
865.762	Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko,
865.762	in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,
870.046	the robin does find its way by somehow
870.046	sensing the Earth's magnetic field,
874.047	to give it directional information --
874.047	a built-in compass.
877.398	The puzzle, the mystery was:
877.398	How does it do it?
880.351	Well, the only theory in town --
883.405	we don't know if it's the correct theory,
883.405	but the only theory in town --
886.865	is that it does it via something
886.865	called quantum entanglement.
890.567	Inside the robin's retina --
892.965	I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina
892.965	is a protein called cryptochrome,
897.221	which is light-sensitive.
898.625	Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons
898.625	are quantum-entangled.
902.588	Now, quantum entanglement
902.588	is when two particles are far apart,
905.844	and yet somehow remain
905.844	in contact with each other.
908.991	Even Einstein hated this idea;
910.461	"he called it ""spooky action"
910.461	"at a distance."""
912.524	(Laughter)
914.429	So if Einstein doesn't like it,
914.429	then we can all be uncomfortable with it.
917.896	Two quantum-entangled electrons
917.896	within a single molecule
920.773	dance a delicate dance
922.268	that is very sensitive
922.268	to the direction the bird flies
924.833	in the Earth's magnetic field.
926.848	We don't know if it's
926.848	the correct explanation,
929.482	but wow, wouldn't it be exciting
929.482	if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?
935.069	Quantum biology is still in it infancy.
