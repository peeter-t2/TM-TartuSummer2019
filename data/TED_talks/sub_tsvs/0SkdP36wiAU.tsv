12.535	I am a computer science and engineering
12.535	professor here at Carnegie Mellon,
15.98	and my research focuses on
15.98	usable privacy and security,
20.228	and so my friends like to give me examples
22.996	of their frustrations with computing systems,
25.198	especially frustrations related to
28.552	unusable privacy and security.
32.664	So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.
35.375	A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,
38.255	and it's bad enough
39.949	when you have to have one really good password
42.593	that you can remember
44.415	but nobody else is going to be able to guess.
47.309	But what do you do when you have accounts
48.946	on a hundred different systems
50.754	and you're supposed to have a unique password
53.03	for each of these systems?
56.067	It's tough.
58.251	At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it
60.01	actually pretty easy for us
61.309	to remember our passwords.
63.046	The password requirement up through 2009
65.449	was just that you had to have a password
67.828	with at least one character.
70.039	Pretty easy. But then they changed things,
72.927	and at the end of 2009, they announced
75.597	that we were going to have a new policy,
77.973	and this new policy required
79.836	passwords that were at least eight characters long,
82.517	with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,
84.292	a digit, a symbol,
85.58	you couldn't use the same
85.58	character more than three times,
88.218	and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.
90.652	Now, when they implemented this new policy,
92.834	a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,
95.144	"came up to me and they said, ""Wow,"
96.998	now that's really unusable.
98.51	Why are they doing this to us,
99.703	"and why didn't you stop them?"""
101.414	"And I said, ""Well, you know what?"
102.77	"They didn't ask me."""
104.278	But I got curious, and I decided to go talk
107.743	to the people in charge of our computer systems
109.68	and find out what led them to introduce
112.511	this new policy,
114.359	and they said that the university
115.943	had joined a consortium of universities,
118.309	and one of the requirements of membership
120.943	was that we had to have stronger passwords
123.191	that complied with some new requirements,
125.463	and these requirements were that our passwords
127.567	had to have a lot of entropy.
129.171	Now entropy is a complicated term,
131.449	but basically it measures the strength of passwords.
134.247	But the thing is, there isn't actually
136.226	a standard measure of entropy.
138.175	Now, the National Institute
138.175	of Standards and Technology
140.574	has a set of guidelines
142.127	which have some rules of thumb
144.695	for measuring entropy,
146.135	but they don't have anything too specific,
149.03	and the reason they only have rules of thumb
151.367	is it turns out they don't actually have any good data
154.503	on passwords.
156.023	In fact, their report states,
158.335	"""Unfortunately, we do not have much data"
160.663	on the passwords users
160.663	choose under particular rules.
163.505	NIST would like to obtain more data
165.838	on the passwords users actually choose,
168.3	but system administrators
168.3	are understandably reluctant
170.763	"to reveal password data to others."""
173.703	So this is a problem, but our research group
176.8	looked at it as an opportunity.
178.94	"We said, ""Well, there's a need"
178.94	for good password data.
182.04	Maybe we can collect some good password data
184.188	and actually advance the state of the art here.
186.892	So the first thing we did is,
188.564	we got a bag of candy bars
190.12	and we walked around campus
191.206	and talked to students, faculty and staff,
194.004	and asked them for information
195.534	about their passwords.
197.086	"Now we didn't say, ""Give us your password."""
200.09	No, we just asked them about their password.
202.751	How long is it? Does it have a digit?
204.229	Does it have a symbol?
205.297	And were you annoyed at having to create
207.342	a new one last week?
210.086	So we got results from 470 students,
213.292	faculty and staff,
214.263	and indeed we confirmed that the new policy
216.777	was very annoying,
218.23	but we also found that people said
220.022	they felt more secure with these new passwords.
223.152	We found that most people knew
225.458	they were not supposed to
225.458	write their password down,
227.61	and only 13 percent of them did,
230.001	but disturbingly, 80 percent of people
232.417	said they were reusing their password.
234.541	Now, this is actually more dangerous
236.337	than writing your password down,
238.359	because it makes you much
238.359	more susceptible to attackers.
241.92	So if you have to, write your passwords down,
245.038	but don't reuse them.
246.837	We also found some interesting things
248.588	about the symbols people use in passwords.
251.549	So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,
254.348	but as you can see, there's only a small number
256.781	that most people are using,
258.583	so we're not actually getting very much strength
261.524	from the symbols in our passwords.
263.99	So this was a really interesting study,
266.701	and now we had data from 470 people,
269.165	but in the scheme of things,
270.47	that's really not very much password data,
273.05	and so we looked around to see
274.495	where could we find additional password data?
277.055	So it turns out there are a lot of people
279.231	going around stealing passwords,
281.433	and they often go and post these passwords
283.91	on the Internet.
285.247	So we were able to get access
286.92	to some of these stolen password sets.
290.89	This is still not really ideal for research, though,
293.218	because it's not entirely clear
295.255	where all of these passwords came from,
297.439	or exactly what policies were in effect
299.681	when people created these passwords.
301.789	So we wanted to find some better source of data.
305.341	So we decided that one thing we could do
306.975	is we could do a study and have people
309.104	actually create passwords for our study.
312.344	So we used a service called
312.344	Amazon Mechanical Turk,
315.165	and this is a service where you can post
317.499	a small job online that takes a minute,
319.803	a few minutes, an hour,
321.303	and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,
323.887	to do a task for you,
325.233	and then you pay them through Amazon.com.
327.355	So we paid people about 50 cents
329.649	to create a password following our rules
332.245	and answering a survey,
333.655	and then we paid them again to come back
336.18	two days later and log in
338.251	using their password and answering another survey.
340.825	So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,
345.289	and we gave people a bunch of different policies
347.984	to create passwords with.
349.492	So some people had a pretty easy policy,
351.402	we call it Basic8,
352.941	and here the only rule was that your password
355.087	had to have at least eight characters.
358.503	Then some people had a much harder policy,
360.754	and this was very similar to the CMU policy,
363.291	that it had to have eight characters
365.225	including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,
367.601	and pass a dictionary check.
369.99	And one of the other policies we tried,
371.325	and there were a whole bunch more,
372.595	but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,
374.835	and the only requirement here
377.467	was that your password had
377.467	to have at least 16 characters.
380.62	All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,
383.078	and so we had much more detailed information.
386.641	Again we see that there's only a small number
389.2	of symbols that people are actually using
391.115	in their passwords.
393.001	We also wanted to get an idea of how strong
395.6	the passwords were that people were creating,
398.371	but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure
400.991	of password strength.
402.745	So what we decided to do was to see
405.057	how long it would take to crack these passwords
407.427	using the best cracking tools
408.841	that the bad guys are using,
410.649	or that we could find information about
412.665	in the research literature.
414.202	So to give you an idea of how bad guys
416.96	go about cracking passwords,
419.13	they will steal a password file
421.081	that will have all of the passwords
423.234	in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,
426.123	and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess
428.685	as to what a password is,
430.397	run it through a hashing function,
432.294	and see whether it matches
434.059	the passwords they have on
434.059	their stolen password list.
438.009	So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.
441.114	They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,
444.682	and this is going to take a really long time
447.1	before they get any passwords
448.626	that people are really likely to actually have.
451.323	A smart attacker, on the other hand,
453.506	does something much more clever.
454.892	They look at the passwords
456.718	that are known to be popular
458.518	from these stolen password sets,
460.245	and they guess those first.
461.434	"So they're going to start by guessing ""password,"""
463.568	"and then they'll guess ""I love you,"" and ""monkey,"""
466.319	"and ""12345678,"""
468.902	because these are the passwords
470.214	that are most likely for people to have.
472.119	In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.
477.191	So what we found
478.489	by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected
481.895	through these tests to see how strong they were,
486.001	we found that the long passwords
488.753	were actually pretty strong,
490.033	and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.
493.295	However, when we looked at the survey data,
495.737	we saw that people were really frustrated
498.761	by the very complex passwords,
501.1	and the long passwords were a lot more usable,
503.73	and in some cases, they were actually
505.055	even stronger than the complex passwords.
507.963	So this suggests that,
509.132	instead of telling people that they need
510.835	to put all these symbols and numbers
512.357	and crazy things into their passwords,
515.199	we might be better off just telling people
517.221	to have long passwords.
519.873	Now here's the problem, though:
521.665	Some people had long passwords
523.92	that actually weren't very strong.
525.475	You can make long passwords
527.472	that are still the sort of thing
529.028	that an attacker could easily guess.
530.77	So we need to do more than
530.77	just say long passwords.
534.135	There has to be some additional requirements,
536.071	and some of our ongoing research is looking at
539.04	what additional requirements we should add
541.479	to make for stronger passwords
543.583	that also are going to be easy for people
545.895	to remember and type.
548.593	Another approach to getting people to have
550.719	stronger passwords is to use a password meter.
552.976	Here are some examples.
554.361	You may have seen these on the Internet
555.762	when you were creating passwords.
558.819	We decided to do a study to find out
561.067	whether these password meters actually work.
563.954	Do they actually help people
565.375	have stronger passwords,
566.828	and if so, which ones are better?
568.914	So we tested password meters that were
571.421	different sizes, shapes, colors,
573.519	different words next to them,
574.935	and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.
578.21	As you type a better password,
579.792	the bunny dances faster and faster.
582.331	So this was pretty fun.
584.86	What we found
586.427	was that password meters do work.
589.999	(Laughter)
591.8	Most of the password meters were actually effective,
595.133	and the dancing bunny was very effective too,
597.654	but the password meters that were the most effective
600.535	were the ones that made you work harder
602.89	before they gave you that thumbs up and said
604.87	you were doing a good job,
606.247	and in fact we found that most
607.759	of the password meters on the Internet today
610.04	are too soft.
610.992	They tell you you're doing a good job too early,
613.195	and if they would just wait a little bit
615.124	before giving you that positive feedback,
617.173	you probably would have better passwords.
620.333	Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,
624.18	is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.
627.07	So this was an xkcd cartoon 
627.07	from a couple of years ago,
630.488	and the cartoonist suggests
632.162	that we should all use pass phrases,
634.358	and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,
637.528	you can see the cartoonist is suggesting
639.385	"that the pass phrase ""correct horse battery staple"""
642.826	would be a very strong pass phrase
645.307	and something really easy to remember.
647.223	He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.
650.02	And so we decided to do a research study
652.17	to find out whether this was true or not.
654.762	In fact, everybody who I talk to,
656.537	who I mention I'm doing password research,
658.579	they point out this cartoon.
659.979	"""Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd."
661.553	"Correct horse battery staple."""
663.155	So we did the research study to see
664.961	what would actually happen.
667.32	So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,
670.38	and we had the computer pick the random words
674.547	in the pass phrase.
675.647	Now the reason we did this
676.8	is that humans are not very good
678.386	at picking random words.
679.77	If we asked a human to do it,
681.032	they would pick things that were not very random.
684.03	So we tried a few different conditions.
686.062	In one condition, the computer picked
688.152	from a dictionary of the very common words
690.368	in the English language,
691.73	and so you'd get pass phrases like
693.494	"""try there three come."""
695.418	And we looked at that, and we said,
697.15	"""Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."""
700.2	So then we tried picking words
702.44	that came from specific parts of speech,
704.961	so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.
707.143	That comes up with something
707.143	that's sort of sentence-like.
709.72	So you can get a pass phrase like
711.79	"""plan builds sure power"""
713.098	"or ""end determines red drug."""
715.884	And these seemed a little bit more memorable,
718.56	and maybe people would like those a little bit better.
721.382	We wanted to compare them with passwords,
723.954	and so we had the computer
723.954	pick random passwords,
727.15	and these were nice and short, but as you can see,
729.14	they don't really look very memorable.
731.946	And then we decided to try something called
733.342	a pronounceable password.
734.988	So here the computer picks random syllables
737.233	and puts them together
738.367	so you have something sort of pronounceable,
740.842	"like ""tufritvi"" and ""vadasabi."""
743.444	That one kind of rolls off your tongue.
745.591	So these were random passwords that were
747.807	generated by our computer.
750.551	So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,
753.529	pass phrases were not actually all that good.
757.297	People were not really better at remembering
760.09	the pass phrases than these random passwords,
763.043	and because the pass phrases are longer,
765.797	they took longer to type
767.023	and people made more errors while typing them in.
770.033	So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.
773.26	Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.
776.605	On the other hand, we did find
778.497	that pronounceable passwords
780.301	worked surprisingly well,
781.772	and so we actually are doing some more research
784.19	to see if we can make that
784.19	approach work even better.
787.385	So one of the problems
789.197	with some of the studies that we've done
790.82	is that because they're all done
792.503	using Mechanical Turk,
794.093	these are not people's real passwords.
795.905	They're the passwords that they created
798.01	or the computer created for them for our study.
800.505	And we wanted to know whether people
802.073	would actually behave the same way
804.385	with their real passwords.
806.612	So we talked to the information
806.612	security office at Carnegie Mellon
810.293	and asked them if we could
810.293	have everybody's real passwords.
814.096	Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant
815.85	to share them with us,
817.4	but we were actually able to work out
819.21	a system with them
820.25	where they put all of the real passwords
822.359	for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,
825.45	into a locked computer in a locked room,
827.898	not connected to the Internet,
829.292	and they ran code on it that we wrote
831.14	to analyze these passwords.
833.292	They audited our code.
834.618	They ran the code.
835.93	And so we never actually saw
837.668	anybody's password.
840.485	We got some interesting results,
842	and those of you Tepper students in the back
843.696	will be very interested in this.
846.571	So we found that the passwords created
850.302	by people affiliated with the
850.302	school of computer science
852.46	were actually 1.8 times stronger
854.784	than those affiliated with the business school.
858.522	We have lots of other really interesting
860.562	demographic information as well.
862.8	The other interesting thing that we found
864.646	is that when we compared
864.646	the Carnegie Mellon passwords
867.086	to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,
869.369	there was actually a lot of similarities,
871.988	and so this helped validate our research method
873.936	and show that actually, collecting passwords
876.446	using these Mechanical Turk studies
878.254	is actually a valid way to study passwords.
881.042	So that was good news.
883.327	Okay, I want to close by talking about
885.741	some insights I gained while on sabbatical
887.809	last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.
891.01	One of the things that I did
892.291	is I made a number of quilts,
893.815	and I made this quilt here.
895.363	"It's called ""Security Blanket."""
897.262	(Laughter)
899.693	And this quilt has the 1,000
902.788	most frequent passwords stolen
905.116	from the RockYou website.
907.687	And the size of the passwords is proportional
909.748	to how frequently they appeared
911.649	in the stolen dataset.
913.897	And what I did is I created this word cloud,
916.529	and I went through all 1,000 words,
918.661	and I categorized them into
920.456	loose thematic categories.
922.836	And it was, in some cases,
924.739	it was kind of difficult to figure out
926.777	what category they should be in,
928.532	and then I color-coded them.
930.431	So here are some examples of the difficulty.
933.05	"So ""justin."""
934.231	Is that the name of the user,
936.06	their boyfriend, their son?
937.382	Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.
940.27	"Or ""princess."""
942.495	Is that a nickname?
944.13	Are they Disney princess fans?
945.725	Or maybe that's the name of their cat.
949.419	"""Iloveyou"" appears many times"
951.074	in many different languages.
952.619	There's a lot of love in these passwords.
956.354	If you look carefully, you'll see there's also
958.034	some profanity,
960.301	but it was really interesting to me to see
962.251	that there's a lot more love than hate
964.558	in these passwords.
966.85	And there are animals,
968.34	a lot of animals,
969.7	"and ""monkey"" is the most common animal"
972.004	and the 14th most popular password overall.
975.679	And this was really curious to me,
977.91	"and I wondered, ""Why are monkeys so popular?"""
980.433	And so in our last password study,
983.785	any time we detected somebody
985.471	"creating a password with the word ""monkey"" in it,"
988.12	we asked them why they had
988.12	a monkey in their password.
991.15	And what we found out --
993.06	we found 17 people so far, I think,
995.163	"who have the word ""monkey"" --"
996.446	We found out about a third of them said
998.258	"they have a pet named ""monkey"""
999.998	"or a friend whose nickname is ""monkey,"""
1002.289	and about a third of them said
1003.949	that they just like monkeys
1005.482	and monkeys are really cute.
1007.12	And that guy is really cute.
1010.759	So it seems that at the end of the day,
1014.167	when we make passwords,
1015.95	we either make something that's really easy
1017.924	to type, a common pattern,
1020.933	or things that remind us of the word password
1023.419	or the account that we've created the password for,
1026.731	or whatever.
1029.348	Or we think about things that make us happy,
1031.99	and we create our password
1033.294	based on things that make us happy.
1035.532	And while this makes typing
1038.395	and remembering your password more fun,
1041.265	it also makes it a lot easier
1043.072	to guess your password.
1044.578	So I know a lot of these TED Talks
1046.326	are inspirational
1047.96	and they make you think about nice, happy things,
1050.421	but when you're creating your password,
1052.318	try to think about something else.
1054.309	Thank you.
