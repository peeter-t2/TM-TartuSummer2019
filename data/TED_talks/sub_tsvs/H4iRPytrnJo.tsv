16.05	The filmmaker Georges Méliès was first a magician.
22.141	Now movies proved to be the ultimate medium for magic.
28.901	With complete control of everything the audience can see,
34.382	moviemakers had developed an arsenal of techniques
38.739	to further their deceptions.
43.033	Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life,
47.848	produced by the sequential projection of still frames,
51.691	and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.
56.559	Even today's sophisticated moviegoers
59.255	still lose themselves to the screen,
62.175	and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality
65.855	to great effect.
68.402	Now imaginative people have been having fun with this
72.712	for over 400 years.
74.781	Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar
78.582	in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world
84.184	and saw how it could be manipulated.
87.831	Playing with the world, and our perception of it,
91.247	really is the essence of visual effects.
94.537	So digging deeper into this
96.719	with the Science and Technology Council
99.071	of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
102.231	reveals some truth behind the trickery.
106.719	Visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions:
112.063	assumption, things are as we know them;
115.743	presumption, things will behave as we expect;
119.816	and context in reality,
122.313	our knowledge of the world as we know it,
124.905	such as scale.
126.507	Now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession,
130.584	which is, never betray the illusion.
134.689	And that last point has made visual effects
137.792	a constant quest for perfection.
141.144	So from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema
145.871	to last Sunday's Oscar winner, what follows are some steps
150.951	and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects.
156.158	I hope you will enjoy.
