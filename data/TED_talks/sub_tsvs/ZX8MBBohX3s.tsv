15.326	Good morning. So magic is an excellent way
18.308	for staying ahead of the reality curve,
20.351	to make possible today
23.266	what science will make a reality tomorrow.
25.348	As a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion
28.349	and science to give us a feel of how future technologies
33.308	might be experienced.
35.355	You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.
39.26	It's new technology. You look through them
41.287	and the world you see is augmented with data:
44.26	names of places, monuments, buildings,
47.317	maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.
51.333	So these are my illusion glasses.
55.349	They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.
59.304	And when you look through them, you get a glimpse
62.31	into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.
66.318	Let me show you what I mean.
68.343	All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
73.324	Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it
77.334	when we see it again.
82.322	All right. Very significant mark.
86.272	And let's put it back into the deck,
88.272	somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.
93.266	(Music)
94.296	Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.
97.273	Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,
99.302	a deck of cards is made up of four different suits:
103.271	hearts, clubs,
106.272	diamonds and spades.
109.293	The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,
112.283	and have been interpreted in many different ways.
117.287	Now, some say that the four suits
121.275	represent the four seasons.
125.277	There's spring, summer,
128.347	autumn and â€”
131.274	Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.
134.268	Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,
137.285	when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,
140.356	and then it all disappears.
144.33	There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)
150.353	Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.
154.31	MT: So over here is low tide,
157.268	and over here is high tide,
159.338	and in the middle is the moon.
162.326	Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.
166.286	MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.
170.351	There is the color red
173.342	and the color black,
178.279	representing the constant change
181.278	from day to night.
184.278	Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)
186.319	MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards
190.356	in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?
195.359	(Music)
199.293	Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,
201.331	the result is 365.
204.265	MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,
207.309	the number of days between
210.309	each birthday.
212.344	Make a wish. (Blowing noise)
216.3	Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.
218.344	MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday
221.303	that I received my first deck of cards,
224.347	and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world
229.287	performing magic for boys and girls,
232.343	men and women, husbands and wives,
235.29	even kings and queens. (Applause)
241.315	Voice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.
245.309	Wake up.
247.318	Joker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?
249.31	Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.
251.333	Joker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.
254.34	Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)
258.274	MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.
263.334	I'm performing for you.
266.354	Voice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me
269.352	how do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?
274.281	Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.
277.287	I don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.
285.273	but it does take practice. Now, some people will say,
288.325	well, magic, that must be the work of some evil
293.296	supernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)
296.304	(Music)
299.282	Whoa.
304.275	Well, to this, I just say, no no.
308.261	Actually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)
310.35	Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,
314.301	if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,
318.267	don't play for money.
321.28	(Music)
324.313	Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.
328.264	The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.
331.342	MT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.
336.284	Voice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,
341.281	and most important card of all:
344.292	the one with this very significant mark on it.
347.293	And unlike anything else we've just seen,
350.26	virtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.
354.281	Digital MT: This is without a question the real thing.
363.287	MT: Bye bye. (Music)
372.28	Thank you. (Applause)
375.33	(Applause)
378.348	Thank you very much. (Applause)
385.317	(Applause)
