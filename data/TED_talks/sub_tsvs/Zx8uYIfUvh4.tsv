16.769	It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,
21.725	the Cuban shore,
23.801	looking out at that distant horizon,
28.389	believing, again,
31.887	that I'm going to make it all the way
34.454	across that vast,
34.454	dangerous wilderness of an ocean.
39.547	Not only have I tried four times,
41.295	but the greatest swimmers in the world
41.295	have been trying since 1950,
45.847	and it's still never been done.
49.378	The team is proud of our four attempts.
53.33	It's an expedition of some 30 people.
55.884	Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,
60.484	who somehow summons will,
63.148	that last drop of will within me,
63.148	when I think it's gone,
66.931	after many, many hours and days out there.
70.526	The shark experts
70.526	are the best in the world --
72.916	large predators below.
76.694	The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom
76.694	in all of the ocean,
81.527	is in these waters,
83.127	and I have come close to dying from them
83.127	on a previous attempt.
88.12	The conditions themselves,
90.556	besides the sheer distance
90.556	of over 100 miles in the open ocean --
95.849	the currents and whirling eddies
95.849	and the Gulf Stream itself,
99.886	the most unpredictable
99.886	of all of the planet Earth.
105.639	And by the way -- it's amusing to me
109.815	that journalists and people,
109.815	before these attempts, often ask me,
114.489	"""Well, are you going to go with any boats"
114.489	"or any people or anything?"""
117.917	(Laughter)
119.404	And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?
121.564	That I'll just sort of do
121.564	some celestial navigation --
124.608	(Laughter)
125.739	And carry a bowie knife in my mouth,
129.267	and I'll hunt fish and skin them
129.267	alive and eat them,
132.83	and maybe drag a desalinization plant
132.83	behind me for fresh water.
137.601	(Laughter)
142.331	Yes, I have a team.
143.612	(Laughter)
146.139	And the team is expert,
148.442	and the team is courageous,
150.614	and brimming with innovation
150.614	and scientific discovery,
154.8	as is true of any major
154.8	expedition on the planet.
160.035	And we've been on a journey.
162.96	And the debate has raged, hasn't it,
165.203	since the Greeks,
166.583	of isn't it what it's all about?
169.446	Isn't life about the journey,
169.446	not really the destination?
174.415	And here we've been on this journey,
176.154	and the truth is, it's been thrilling.
178.426	We haven't reached that other shore,
180.197	and still, our sense
180.197	of pride and commitment,
183.949	unwavering commitment.
186.112	When I turned 60,
186.112	the dream was still alive
190.566	from having tried this in my 20s --
190.566	dreamed it and imagined it.
196.303	The most famous body of water
196.303	on the Earth today, I imagine,
200.932	Cuba to Florida.
202.894	And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.
207.121	When I turned 60,
209.411	it wasn't so much
209.411	about the athletic accomplishment,
212.064	it wasn't the ego
212.064	"of ""I want to be the first."""
215.379	That's always there and it's undeniable.
218.101	But it was deeper.
219.898	"It was ""how much life is there left?"""
221.955	Let's face it -- we're all
221.955	on a one-way street, aren't we?
225.219	And what are we going to do?
226.786	What are we going to do as we go forward,
226.786	to have no regrets looking back?
232.194	And all this past year in training,
234.856	I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote
237.567	to paraphrase it,
237.567	floating around in my brain.
239.844	"It says, ""You go ahead."
241.683	You go ahead and sit back
241.683	in your comfortable chair
244.803	and you be the critic,
244.803	you be the observer,
248.775	while the brave one
248.775	gets in the ring and engages
252.943	and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails
252.943	over and over and over again,
257.424	but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid
257.424	"and lives life in a bold way."""
262.944	And so of course I want to make it across.
265.401	It is the goal, and I should
265.401	be so shallow to say that this year,
270.673	the destination was even sweeter
270.673	than the journey.
274.198	(Laughter)
276.125	(Applause)
279.557	But the journey itself
279.557	was worthwhile taking.
282.839	And at this point, by this summer,
285.281	everybody -- scientists,
285.281	sports scientists,
289.016	endurance experts, neurologists,
293.319	my own team, Bonnie --
297.755	said it's impossible.
299.582	It just simply can't be done,
299.582	and Bonnie said to me,
302.154	"""But if you're going to take the journey,"
304.164	I'm going to see you
304.164	through to the end of it,
306.379	"so I'll be there."""
307.566	And now we're there.
312.132	As we're looking out,
312.132	kind of a surreal moment
315.029	before the first stroke,
316.357	standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,
318.883	the Cuban flag is flying above,
321.576	all my team is out in their boats,
321.576	hands up in the air,
325.85	"""We're here!"
327.914	"We're here for you!"""
331.017	Bonnie and I look at each other and say,
333.13	this year, the mantra is --
333.13	and I've been using it in training --
337.216	Find a way.
339.137	You have a dream
341.871	and you have obstacles
341.871	in front of you, as we all do.
344.886	None of us ever get through this life
348.538	without heartache,
352.058	without turmoil,
354.379	and if you believe and you have faith
357.197	and you can get knocked down
357.197	and get back up again
359.593	and you believe in perseverance
362.518	as a great human quality,
366.16	you find your way.
367.473	And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,
369.118	"and she said, ""Let's find"
369.118	"our way to Florida."""
373.374	And we started, and for the next 53 hours,
375.947	it was an intense,
375.947	unforgettable life experience.
381.647	The highs were high, the awe --
383.888	I'm not a religious person,
383.888	but I'll tell you,
386.237	to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream
389.686	as if, as you're breathing,
391.59	you're looking down miles
391.59	and miles and miles,
396.253	to feel the majesty
396.253	of this blue planet we live on --
401.186	it's awe-inspiring.
405.055	I have a playlist of about 85 songs,
407.557	and especially in the middle
407.557	of the night ...
409.694	That night, because we use
409.694	no lights -- lights attract jellyfish,
412.834	lights attract sharks,
414.054	lights attract baitfish
414.054	that attract sharks,
416.439	so we go in the pitch black of the night.
418.94	You've never seen black this black.
422.271	You can't see the front of your hand,
424.357	and the people on the boat,
424.357	Bonnie and my team on the boat --
427.37	they just hear the slapping of the arms,
429.427	and they know where I am,
430.642	because there's no visual at all.
432.584	And I'm out there kind of tripping out
432.584	on my little playlist.
436.721	(Laughter)
439.249	I've got tight rubber caps,
439.249	I don't hear a thing.
442.317	I've got goggles and I'm turning
442.317	my head 50 times a minute,
445.458	and I'm singing ...
447.5	(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
450.123	(Laughter)
451.734	doo doo doo doo doo
453.44	It's easy if you try
456.284	doo doo doo doo doo
457.512	And I can sing that song
457.512	a thousand times in a row.
460.07	(Laughter)
462.329	Now there's a talent unto itself.
464.979	(Laughter)
466.807	(Applause)
469.411	And each time I get done with,
471.809	(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer
471.809	but I'm not the only one
481.57	(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
484.03	(Laughter)
486.136	And when I get through the end
487.675	"of a thousand of John Lennon's ""Imagine,"""
489.755	I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...
492.783	exactly.
493.982	(Laughter)
496.403	And then there are the crises.
498.379	Of course there are.
500.957	And the vomiting starts,
500.957	the seawater -- you're not well.
504.299	You're wearing a jellyfish mask
504.299	for the ultimate protection.
507.932	It's difficult to swim in.
509.415	It's causing abrasions
509.415	on the inside of the mouth,
512.073	but the tentacles can't get you.
514.707	And the hypothermia sets in.
517.292	The water's 85 degrees,
517.292	and yet you're losing weight
520.701	and using calories.
522.044	And as you come over
522.044	toward the side of the boat --
524.506	not allowed to touch it,
524.506	not allowed to get out,
526.87	but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition
529.024	and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.
532.377	I am seeing the Taj Mahal --
535.26	(Laughter)
536.505	Over here.
537.812	I'm in a very different state --
541.599	(Laughter)
542.995	"And I'm thinking, ""Wow!"
545.781	I never thought I'd be running
545.781	into the Taj Mahal out here.
549.663	It's gorgeous!
551.448	I mean, how long
551.448	did it take them to build that?
554.061	It's just ...
556.315	So, uh -- wooo -- you know?
558.439	(Laughter)
562.626	We kind of have a cardinal rule
564.518	that I'm never told how far it is,
564.518	because we don't know how far it is.
568.011	What's going to happen to you
568.011	between this point and that point?
571.212	What's going to happen
571.212	to the weather and the currents
573.84	and, God forbid, you're stung,
575.824	when you don't think you could
575.824	be stung in all this armor.
580.393	Bonnie made a decision
580.393	coming into that third morning
584.772	that I was suffering,
586.567	and I was hanging on by a thread.
590.459	"And she said, ""Come here,"""
591.728	and I came close
591.728	to the boat, and she said,
593.839	"""Look, look out there."""
595.061	And I saw light,
596.238	because the day is easier than the night,
598.264	and I thought we were coming into day.
600.118	I saw a stream of white light
600.118	along the horizon,
603.8	"and I said, ""It's going"
603.8	"to be morning soon."""
606.102	"And she said, ""No, those"
606.102	"are the lights of Key West."""
611.65	It was 15 more hours,
613.516	which for most swimmers
613.516	would be a long time.
615.749	(Laughter)
618.899	(Applause)
622.24	You have no idea how many
626.785	So here we go, and I somehow,
626.785	without a decision,
630.626	went into no counting of strokes
632.968	and no singing
634.301	and no quoting Stephen Hawking
634.301	on the parameters of the universe.
639.516	I just went into thinking
639.516	about this dream, and why and how.
646.188	As I said, when I turned 60,
648.354	it wasn't about that concrete
648.354	"""Can you do it?"""
652.382	That's the everyday machinations.
655.342	That's the discipline,
655.342	and it's the preparation,
658.113	and there's a pride in that.
659.842	But I decided to think, as I went along,
664.391	about -- you know, the phrase usually is,
664.391	"""reaching for the stars."""
668.28	And in my case,
668.28	it's reaching for the horizon.
671.438	And when you reach for the horizon,
673.333	as I've proven, you may not get there.
676.036	But what a tremendous build
676.036	of character and spirit
682.392	that you lay down;
684.409	what a foundation you lay down
684.409	in reaching for those horizons.
689.889	And now, the shore is coming.
692.432	And there's just a little part
692.432	of me that's sad.
695.579	The epic journey is going to be over.
697.82	So many people come up to me now and say,
699.91	"""What's next?"""
701.127	(Laughter)
702.573	"""We love that!"""
703.902	(Laughter)
705.013	"""That little tracker on the computer?"
706.917	When are you going to do the next one?
708.782	"We can't wait to follow the next one."""
710.638	Well, they were just there for 53 hours,
712.842	and I was there for years.
715.229	And so there won't be another
715.229	epic journey in the ocean.
718.658	But the point is, and the point was,
722.233	that every day of our lives is epic.
727.417	And I'll tell you,
727.417	when I walked up onto that beach,
729.913	staggered up onto that beach ...
731.908	I had so many times,
731.908	in a very puffed-up ego way,
738.359	rehearsed what I would say ...
740.418	(Laughter)
742.089	on the beach.
743.363	When Bonnie thought the back
743.363	of my throat was swelling up,
746.327	she brought the medical team
746.327	over to our boat
748.52	"to say, ""She's really beginning"
748.52	to have trouble breathing;
752.752	another 12, 24 hours
752.752	"in the saltwater ..."" --"
755.831	the whole thing -- I just thought,
755.831	in my hallucinatory moment,
759.6	"that I heard the word ""tracheotomy."""
762.01	(Laughter)
764.871	Bonnie said to the doctor,
764.871	"""I'm not worried about her not breathing."
768.165	If she can't talk
768.165	when she gets to the shore,
770.33	"she's going to be pissed off."""
771.881	(Laughter)
777.112	But the truth is, all those orations
777.112	that I had practiced,
781.041	just to get myself through some
781.041	training swims as motivation --
784.941	it wasn't like that.
786.433	It was a very real moment,
788.905	with that crowd, with my team.
791.368	We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.
793.877	And we'll never forget it.
793.877	It'll always be part of us.
797.181	The three things I did sort of blurt out
797.181	when we got there, was first:
801.223	Never, ever give up.
804.55	I live it.
805.976	What's the phrase
805.976	from today from Socrates?
808.867	Audience: To be is to do.
810.087	Diana Nyad: To be is to do.
811.419	So I don't stand up and say,
811.419	"""Don't ever give up."""
814.432	I didn't give up.
816.341	There was action behind these words.
818.292	The second is:
820.01	You can chase your dreams
820.01	at any age; you're never too old.
823.31	Sixty-four; a thing no one,
823.31	at any age, any gender, could ever do
828.413	has done it.
829.593	And there's no doubt in my mind
831.156	that I am at the prime of my life today.
833.848	(Applause)
836.676	Yeah.
837.948	(Applause)
842.258	Thank you.
844.081	And the third thing
844.081	I said on that beach was,
846.248	it looks like the most solitary
846.248	endeavor in the world,
848.924	and in many ways, of course, it is.
851.051	And in other ways,
851.051	and the most important ways,
854.724	it's a team.
855.936	And if you think I'm a badass,
855.936	you want to meet Bonnie.
858.669	(Laughter)
860.145	Bonnie, where are you?
862.741	Where are you?
865.236	There's Bonnie Stoll.
866.639	(Applause)
869.05	My buddy.
870.368	(Applause)
873.397	The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,
875.741	"""When you achieve your dreams,"
875.741	it's not so much what you get
879.035	"as who you have become in achieving them."""
881.904	And yeah, I stand before you now.
883.839	In the three months since that swim ended,
885.863	I've sat down with Oprah,
887.691	and I've been in
887.691	President Obama's Oval Office;
891.473	I've been invited to speak
891.473	in front of esteemed groups
894.048	such as yourselves;
895.223	I've signed a wonderful
895.223	major book contract.
897.498	All of that's great,
897.498	and I don't denigrate it.
900.233	I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,
902.148	I'm walking around tall
903.465	because I am that bold, fearless person,
903.465	and I will be, every day,
909.432	until it's time for these days to be done.
913.605	Thank you very much
913.605	and enjoy the conference.
915.787	Thank you. Thank you!
917.918	(Applause)
920.681	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
920.681	Thank you! Thank you.
924.466	(Applause)
927.195	Find a way!
928.636	(Applause)
