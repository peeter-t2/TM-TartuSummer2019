12.555	In 2011, during the final six months
12.555	of Kim Jong-Il's life,
19.029	I lived undercover in North Korea.
23.791	I was born and raised
23.791	in South Korea, their enemy.
28.035	I live in America, their other enemy.
32.369	Since 2002, I had visited
32.369	North Korea a few times.
36.942	And I had come to realize
36.942	that to write about it with any meaning,
42.339	or to understand the place
42.339	beyond the regime's propaganda,
47.411	the only option was total immersion.
54.109	So I posed as a teacher and a missionary
58.36	at an all-male university in Pyongyang.
66.239	The Pyongyang University
66.239	of Science and Technology
70.001	was founded by Evangelical Christians
70.001	who cooperate with the regime
75.958	to educate the sons
75.958	of the North Korean elite,
81.212	without proselytizing,
81.212	which is a capital crime there.
87.196	The students were 270 young men,
87.196	expected to be the future leaders
93.921	of the most isolated and brutal
93.921	dictatorship in existence.
100.689	When I arrived, they became my students.
109.642	marking the 100th anniversary of the birth
109.642	of North Korea's original Great Leader,
115.908	Kim Il-Sung.
117.869	To celebrate the occasion, the regime
117.869	shut down all universities,
123.385	and sent students off to the fields
126.22	to build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal
130.378	as the world's most powerful
130.378	and prosperous nation.
136.958	My students were the only ones
136.958	spared from that fate.
141.502	North Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.
146.038	Everything there
146.038	is about the Great Leader.
148.494	Every book, every newspaper article,
148.494	every song, every TV program --
153.828	there is just one subject.
155.97	The flowers are named after him,
157.935	the mountains are carved with his slogans.
160.831	Every citizen wears the badge
160.831	of the Great Leader at all times.
165.861	Even their calendar system begins
165.861	with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.
171.521	The school was a heavily guarded
171.521	prison, posing as a campus.
176.751	Teachers could only leave on group outings
176.751	accompanied by an official minder.
183.96	Even then, our trips were limited
183.96	to sanctioned national monuments
189.357	celebrating the Great Leader.
192.405	The students were not allowed
192.405	to leave the campus,
196.274	or communicate with their parents.
200.761	Their days were meticulously mapped out,
200.761	and any free time they had
204.911	was devoted to honoring
204.911	their Great Leader.
209.421	Lesson plans had to meet the approval
209.421	of North Korean staff,
214.452	every class was recorded and reported on,
214.452	every room was bugged,
218.681	and every conversation, overheard.
222.743	Every blank space was covered with the 
222.743	portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,
228.413	like everywhere else in North Korea.
233.092	We were never allowed
233.092	to discuss the outside world.
235.969	As students of science and technology,
235.969	many of them were computer majors
241.003	but they did not know
241.003	the existence of the Internet.
244.555	They had never heard
244.555	of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.
249.525	Facebook, Twitter -- none of those things
249.525	would have meant a thing.
254.605	And I could not tell them.
258.861	I went there looking for truth.
262.135	But where do you even start
262.135	when an entire nation's ideology,
265.805	my students' day-to-day realities,
267.823	and even my own position
267.823	at the universities,
271.798	were all built on lies?
277.93	I started with a game.
279.976	"We played ""Truth and Lie."""
282.689	A volunteer would write a sentence
282.689	on the chalkboard,
285.356	and the other students had to guess
288.131	whether it was a truth or a lie.
291.158	"Once a student wrote, ""I visited"
291.158	"China last year on vacation,"""
295.385	"and everyone shouted, ""Lie!"""
299.025	They all knew this wasn't possible.
301.317	Virtually no North Korean is allowed
301.317	to leave the country.
305.297	Even traveling within their own country
305.297	requires a travel pass.
312.569	I had hoped that this game would reveal
312.569	some truth about my students,
317.87	because they lie so often and so easily,
320.957	whether about the mythical
320.957	accomplishments of their Great Leader,
325.394	or the strange claim that they cloned
325.394	a rabbit as fifth graders.
331.482	The difference between truth and lies
331.482	seemed at times hazy to them.
336.423	It took me a while to understand
336.423	the different types of lies;
340.538	they lie to shield their system
340.538	from the world,
343.538	or they were taught lies,
343.538	and were just regurgitating them.
347.417	Or, at moments, they lied out of habit.
352.314	But if all they have ever known were lies,
356.449	how could we expect them to be otherwise?
361.33	Next, I tried to teach them essay writing.
364.408	But that turned out to be
364.408	nearly impossible.
367.225	Essays are about coming up with
367.225	one's own thesis,
371.412	and making an evidence-based
371.412	argument to prove it.
376.044	These students, however, were
376.044	simply told what to think,
379.985	and they obeyed.
381.8	In their world, critical thinking
381.8	was not allowed.
386.88	I also gave them the weekly assignment
386.88	of writing a personal letter,
391.535	to anybody.
393.31	It took a long time, but eventually
393.31	some of them began to write
397.509	to their mothers, their friends,
397.509	their girlfriends.
402.479	Although those were just homework,
405.496	and would never reach
405.496	their intended recipients,
409.076	my students slowly began to reveal
409.076	their true feelings in them.
414.376	They wrote that they were fed
414.376	up with the sameness of everything.
419.435	They were worried about their future.
421.787	In those letters, they rarely ever
421.787	mentioned their Great Leader.
430.806	I was spending all of my time
430.806	with these young men.
434.558	We all ate meals together,
434.558	played basketball together.
439.679	I often called them gentlemen,
439.679	which made them giggle.
444.858	They blushed at the mention of girls.
448.332	And I came to adore them.
450.703	And watching them open up
450.703	even in the tiniest of ways,
454.364	was deeply moving.
457.967	But something also felt wrong.
460.973	During those months
460.973	of living in their world,
463.846	I often wondered if the truth would,
463.846	in fact, improve their lives.
471.759	I wanted so much to tell them the truth,
474.874	of their country and of the outside world,
478.318	where Arab youth were turning
478.318	their rotten regime inside out,
482.333	using the power of social media,
484.152	where everyone except them was
484.152	connected through the world wide web,
488.874	which wasn't worldwide after all.
493.489	But for them, the truth was dangerous.
498.955	By encouraging them to run after it,
498.955	I was putting them at risk --
503.878	of persecution,
506.259	of heartbreak.
510.755	When you're not allowed to express
510.755	anything in the open,
513.437	you become good at reading
513.437	what is unspoken.
517.736	In one of their personal letters to me,
517.736	a student wrote that he understood
522.784	why I always called them gentlemen.
526.63	It was because I was wishing them
526.63	to be gentle in life, he said.
534.767	On my last day in December of 2011,
537.568	the day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,
540.342	their world shattered.
544.798	I had to leave without a proper goodbye.
548.667	But I think they knew
548.667	how sad I was for them.
552.34	Once, toward the end of my stay,
552.34	a student said to me,
556.269	"""Professor, we never think of you"
556.269	as being different from us.
561.767	Our circumstances are different,
561.767	but you're the same as us.
567.898	We want you to know that we truly
567.898	"think of you as being the same."""
577.999	Today, if I could respond
577.999	to my students with a letter of my own,
581.83	which is of course impossible,
584.33	I would tell them this:
589.876	"""My dear gentlemen,"
592.55	It's been a bit over three years
592.55	since I last saw you.
595.549	And now, you must be 22 --
595.549	maybe even as old as 23.
600.565	At our final class, I asked you
600.565	if there was anything you wanted.
605.822	The only wish you expressed,
605.822	the only thing you ever asked of me
609.265	in all those months we spent together,
612.707	was for me to speak to you in Korean.
615.16	Just once.
617.084	I was there to teach you English;
619.584	you knew it wasn't allowed.
622.144	But I understood then, you wanted
622.144	to share that bond of our mother tongue.
630.052	I called you my gentlemen,
633.306	but I don't know if being gentle
633.306	in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea
637.751	is a good thing.
639.717	I don't want you to lead a revolution --
642.068	let some other young person do it.
645.035	The rest of the world might casually
645.035	encourage or even expect
648.605	some sort of North Korean Spring,
650.979	but I don't want you to do anything risky,
653.525	because I know in your world,
653.525	someone is always watching.
659.027	I don't want to imagine
659.027	what might happen to you.
662.225	If my attempts to reach you have
662.225	inspired something new in you,
667.191	I would rather you forget me.
669.646	Become soldiers of your Great Leader,
669.646	and live long, safe lives.
676.361	You once asked me if I thought
676.361	your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,
681.084	and I could not answer truthfully then.
685.609	But I know why you asked.
687.493	I know that it was important for you
687.493	to hear that I, your teacher,
692.048	the one who has seen the world
692.048	that you are forbidden from,
695.933	declare your city as the most beautiful.
701.793	I know hearing that would make
701.793	your lives there a bit more bearable,
706.972	but no, I don't find
706.972	your capital beautiful.
710.9	Not because it's monotone and concrete,
713.553	but because of what it symbolizes:
715.44	a monster that feeds off
715.44	the rest of the country,
720.297	where citizens are soldiers and slaves.
725.734	All I see there is darkness.
729.932	But it's your home, so I cannot hate it.
733.623	And I hope instead that you,
733.623	my lovely young gentlemen,
738.684	will one day help make it beautiful.
742.97	Thank you.
744.183	(Applause)
