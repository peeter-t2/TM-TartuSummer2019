15.918	I want you to imagine two couples
15.918	in the middle of 1979
20.604	on the exact same day,
20.604	at the exact same moment,
23.897	each conceiving a baby, OK?
26.203	So two couples each conceiving one baby.
28.481	Now I don't want you to spend too
28.481	much time imagining the conception,
31.771	because if you do,
31.771	you're not going to listen to me,
34.651	so just imagine that for a moment.
36.486	And in this scenario,
36.486	I want to imagine that, in one case,
40.684	the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,
42.876	meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
44.931	And in the other case,
44.931	the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,
48.127	meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
50.418	Both are viable; both take off.
53.007	We'll come back to these people later.
55.079	So I wear two hats in most of what I do.
59.134	As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
62.357	I'm a historian by training,
62.357	and what I study in that case
66.26	is the way that people
66.26	have dealt with anatomy --
68.87	meaning human bodies, animal bodies --
71.524	how they dealt with bodily fluids,
71.524	concepts of bodies;
74.26	how have they thought about bodies.
76.993	The other hat that I've worn
76.993	in my work is as an activist,
80.973	as a patient advocate --
82.853	or, as I sometimes say,
82.853	as an impatient advocate --
85.26	for people who are patients of doctors.
87.521	In that case, what I've worked with
87.521	is people who have body types
91.26	that challenge social norms.
93.199	So some of what
93.199	I've worked on, for example,
95.38	is people who are conjoined twins --
97.451	two people within one body.
99.5	Some of what I've worked on
99.5	is people who have dwarfism --
102.244	so people who are much
102.244	shorter than typical.
104.552	And a lot of what I've worked on
104.552	is people who have atypical sex --
108.598	so people who don't have the standard male
108.598	or the standard female body types.
112.65	And as a general term,
112.65	"we can use the term ""intersex"" for this."
116.26	Intersex comes
116.26	in a lot of different forms.
118.822	I'll just give you a few examples
118.822	of the types of ways you can have sex
122.26	that isn't standard for male or female.
124.617	So in one instance,
126.26	you can have somebody
126.26	who has an XY chromosomal basis,
129.72	and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome
132.26	tells the proto-gonads,
132.26	which we all have in the fetal life,
135.688	to become testes.
136.896	So in the fetal life,
136.896	those testes are pumping out testosterone.
140.042	But because this individual
140.042	lacks receptors to hear that testosterone,
145.249	the body doesn't react
145.249	to the testosterone.
147.353	And this is a syndrome called
147.353	androgen insensitivity syndrome.
150.952	So lots of levels of testosterone,
150.952	but no reaction to it.
153.838	As a consequence, the body develops
153.838	more along the female typical path.
157.764	When the child is born,
157.764	she looks like a girl.
160.066	She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
163.188	And it's often not until she hits puberty
163.188	and she's growing and developing breasts,
167.758	but she's not getting her period,
169.361	that somebody figures
169.361	out something's up here.
171.549	And they do some tests and figure out
173.342	that, instead of having
173.342	ovaries inside and a uterus,
175.843	she has testes inside,
175.843	and she has a Y chromosome.
178.313	Now what's important to understand
180.028	is you may think of this
180.028	person as really being male,
182.54	but they're really not.
183.792	Females, like males,
185.88	have in our bodies something
185.88	called the adrenal glands.
188.559	They're in the back of our body.
190.14	And the adrenal glands make androgens,
190.14	which are a masculinizing hormone.
193.594	Most females like me --
193.594	I believe myself to be a typical female --
196.719	I don't actually know
196.719	my chromosomal make-up,
198.902	but I think I'm probably typical --
200.611	most females like me
200.611	are actually androgen-sensitive.
203.117	We're making androgen,
203.117	and we're responding to androgens.
205.862	The consequence is that somebody like me
207.975	has actually had a brain
207.975	exposed to more androgens
211.018	than the woman born with testes
211.018	who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.
214.424	So sex is really complicated --
215.97	it's not just that intersex people
217.638	are in the middle
217.638	of all the sex spectrum --
219.739	in some ways,
219.739	they can be all over the place.
221.86	Another example:
223.042	a few years ago I got a call
223.042	from a man who was 19 years old,
225.971	who was born a boy, raised a boy,
227.858	had a girlfriend,
227.858	had sex with his girlfriend,
230.467	had a life as a guy,
232.163	and had just found out
232.163	that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
235.789	What he had was an extreme form
237.565	of a condition called
237.565	congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
240.27	He had XX chromosomes,
242.22	and in the womb, his adrenal glands
242.22	were in such high gear
245.983	that it created, essentially,
245.983	a masculine hormonal environment.
249.625	And as a consequence,
249.625	his genitals were masculinized,
252.187	his brain was subject to the more typical
252.187	masculine component of hormones.
255.723	And he was born looking like a boy --
255.723	nobody suspected anything.
258.984	And it was only when he had
258.984	reached the age of 19
261.719	that he began to have enough medical
261.719	problems from menstruating internally,
265.334	that doctors figured out that, in fact,
265.334	he was female, internally.
269.194	OK, so just one more quick example
269.194	of a way you can have intersex.
272.752	Some people who have XX chromosomes
272.752	develop what are called ovotestis,
276.655	which is when you have ovarian tissue
276.655	with testicular tissue wrapped around it.
280.418	And we're not exactly sure
280.418	why that happens.
282.568	So sex can come
282.568	in lots of different varieties.
285.415	The reason that children
285.415	with these kinds of bodies --
290.286	whether it's dwarfism,
290.286	or it's conjoined twinning,
293.077	or it's an intersex type --
294.427	"are often ""normalized"" by surgeons"
296.832	is not because it actually leaves them
296.832	better off in terms of physical health.
300.896	In many cases, people are actually
300.896	perfectly healthy.
303.902	The reason they're often subject
303.902	to various kinds of surgeries
306.968	is because they threaten
306.968	our social categories.
309.813	Our system has been based
309.813	typically on the idea
312.606	that a particular kind of anatomy
312.606	comes with a particular identity.
315.96	So we have the concept
315.96	that what it means to be a woman
318.587	is to have a female identity;
320.003	what it means to be a black person
320.003	is, allegedly, to have an African anatomy
324.26	in terms of your history.
326.377	And so we have
326.377	this terribly simplistic idea.
330.18	And when we're faced with a body
331.837	that actually presents us
331.837	something quite different,
334.795	it startles us in terms
334.795	of those categorizations.
337.613	So we have a lot of very romantic ideas
337.613	in our culture about individualism.
341.578	And our nation's really founded on
341.578	a very romantic concept of individualism.
345.243	You can imagine how startling then it is
347.172	when you have children who are born
347.172	who are two people inside of one body.
351.531	Where I ran into the most heat
351.531	from this most recently
355.558	was last year when South African runner,
355.558	Caster Semenya,
358.453	had her sex called into question
358.453	at the International Games in Berlin.
362.032	I had a lot of journalists
362.032	calling me, asking me,
364.88	"""Which is the test they're going to run"
366.778	that will tell us whether or not
366.778	"Caster Semenya is male or female?"""
370.26	And I had to explain to the journalists
370.26	there isn't such a test.
373.577	In fact, we now know
373.577	that sex is complicated enough
377.452	that we have to admit:
379.21	Nature doesn't draw the line
379.21	for us between male and female,
382.923	or between male and intersex
382.923	and female and intersex;
385.856	we actually draw that line on nature.
388.452	So what we have is a sort of situation
388.452	where the farther our science goes,
393.143	the more we have to admit to ourselves
393.143	that these categories
396.103	that we thought of as stable
396.103	anatomical categories,
398.814	that mapped very simply
398.814	to stable identity categories
402.505	are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.
404.664	And it's not just in terms of sex.
406.641	It's also in terms of race,
408.26	which turns out to be
408.26	vastly more complicated
410.7	than our terminology has allowed.
412.816	As we look, we get into all sorts
412.816	of uncomfortable areas.
415.932	We look, for example, about the fact
417.785	that we share at least 95 percent
417.785	of our DNA with chimpanzees.
422.121	What are we to make of the fact
423.845	that we differ from them
423.845	only, really, by a few nucleotides?
427.336	And as we get farther
427.336	and farther with our science,
429.803	we get more and more
429.803	into a discomforted zone,
432.016	where we have to acknowledge
432.016	that the simplistic categories we've had
435.325	are probably overly simplistic.
437.923	So we're seeing this
437.923	in all sorts of places in human life.
441.558	One of the places
441.558	we're seeing it, for example,
443.787	in our culture,
443.787	in the United States today,
445.825	is battles over the beginning
445.825	of life and the end of life.
448.628	We have difficult conversations
450.26	about at what point we decide
450.26	a body becomes a human,
453.423	such that it has a different
453.423	right than a fetal life.
456.412	We have very difficult
456.412	conversations nowadays --
458.96	probably not out in the open
458.96	as much as within medicine --
461.733	about the question
461.733	of when somebody's dead.
464.006	In the past, our ancestors
464.006	never had to struggle so much
466.657	with this question
466.657	of when somebody was dead.
468.783	At most, they'd stick
468.783	a feather on somebody's nose,
471.199	and if it twitched,
471.199	they didn't bury them yet.
473.367	If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
475.25	But today, we have a situation
476.71	where we want to take
476.71	vital organs out of beings
479.045	and give them to other beings.
480.653	And as a consequence,
482.136	we have to struggle
482.136	with this really difficult question
484.764	about who's dead,
486.423	and this leads us
486.423	to a really difficult situation
488.792	where we don't have such simple
488.792	categories as we've had before.
491.792	Now you might think that all this
491.792	breaking-down of categories
494.927	would make somebody like me really happy.
496.937	I'm a political progressive,
496.937	I defend people with unusual bodies,
500.013	but I have to admit to you
500.013	that it makes me nervous.
502.472	Understanding that these categories
504.186	are really much more unstable
504.186	than we thought makes me tense.
507.303	It makes me tense from the point of view
507.303	of thinking about democracy.
510.58	So in order to tell you
510.58	about that tension,
512.76	I have to first admit to you
512.76	a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
515.901	I know they were racists,
515.901	I know they were sexist,
518.534	but they were great.
519.731	I mean, they were so brave and so bold
519.731	and so radical in what they did,
524.869	that I find myself watching that cheesy
524.869	"musical ""1776"" every few years,"
529.363	and it's not because of the music,
529.363	which is totally forgettable.
532.391	It's because of what happened in 1776
532.391	with the Founding Fathers.
535.753	The Founding Fathers were,
535.753	for my point of view,
538.051	the original anatomical activists,
540.127	and this is why.
541.756	What they rejected
541.756	was an anatomical concept
545.055	and replaced it with another one
546.615	that was radical and beautiful
546.615	and held us for 200 years.
549.968	So as you all recall,
551.714	what our Founding Fathers were
551.714	rejecting was a concept of monarchy,
555.142	and the monarchy was basically based
555.142	on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
558.804	The monarchs of the old world
558.804	didn't have a concept of DNA,
562.467	but they did have a concept of birthright.
564.624	They had a concept of blue blood.
566.32	They had the idea that the people
566.32	who would be in political power
569.527	should be in political power
569.527	because of the blood being passed down
572.728	from grandfather to father
572.728	to son and so forth.
577.054	The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,
579.446	and they replaced it
579.446	with a new anatomical concept,
582.121	and that concept
582.121	"was ""all men are created equal."""
585.978	They leveled that playing field
585.978	and decided the anatomy that mattered
589.365	was the commonality of anatomy,
589.365	not the difference in anatomy,
593.803	and that was a really radical thing to do.
596.82	Now they were doing it in part
598.296	because they were part
598.296	of an Enlightenment system
600.612	where two things were growing up together.
602.645	And that was democracy growing up,
604.937	but it was also science
604.937	growing up at the same time.
608.026	And it's really clear, if you look
608.026	at the history of the Founding Fathers,
611.529	a lot of them were very
611.529	interested in science,
613.839	and they were interested
613.839	in the concept of a naturalistic world.
616.891	They were moving away
616.891	from supernatural explanations,
619.401	and they were rejecting things
619.401	like a supernatural concept of power,
622.662	where it transmitted because
622.662	of a very vague concept of birthright.
626.741	They were moving
626.741	towards a naturalistic concept.
629.047	And if you look, for example,
629.047	in the Declaration of Independence,
632.126	they talk about nature and nature's God.
634.856	They don't talk about God
634.856	and God's nature.
637.069	They're talking about the power of nature
637.069	to tell us who we are.
640.996	So as part of that,
640.996	they were coming to us with a concept
644.26	that was about anatomical commonality.
646.994	And in doing so, they were really
646.994	setting up in a beautiful way
650.147	the Civil Rights Movement of the future.
652.084	They didn't think of it that way,
652.084	but they did it for us, and it was great.
655.649	So what happened years afterwards?
657.316	What happened was women, for example,
657.316	who wanted the right to vote,
660.782	took the Founding Fathers' concept
660.782	of anatomical commonality
664.168	being more important
664.168	than anatomical difference
666.399	"and said, ""The fact that we have"
666.399	a uterus and ovaries
668.957	is not significant enough
668.957	in terms of a difference
671.744	to mean that we shouldn't
671.744	have the right to vote,
674.057	the right to full citizenship,
674.057	"the right to own property, etc."""
677.763	And women successfully argued that.
679.839	Next came the successful
679.839	Civil Rights Movement,
682.26	where we found people like Sojourner Truth
684.403	"talking about, ""Ain't I a woman?"""
686.696	We find men on the marching lines
686.696	of the Civil Rights Movement
690.665	"saying, ""I am a man."""
692.039	Again, people of color
692.039	appealing to a commonality of anatomy
696.46	over a difference of anatomy,
696.46	again, successfully.
699.174	We see the same thing
699.174	with the disability rights movement.
702.552	The problem is, of course,
704.734	that, as we begin to look
704.734	at all that commonality,
707.136	we have to begin to question
707.136	why we maintain certain divisions.
710.585	Mind you, I want to maintain
710.585	some divisions,
713.338	anatomically, in our culture.
715.029	For example, I don't want to give a fish
715.029	the same rights as a human.
718.733	I don't want to say
718.733	we give up entirely on anatomy.
721.342	I don't want to say a five-year-old
723.033	should be allowed to consent
723.033	to sex or consent to marry.
725.688	So there are some anatomical divisions
727.679	that make sense to me
727.679	and that I think we should retain.
731.012	But the challenge is trying
731.012	to figure out which ones they are
733.929	and why do we retain them,
733.929	and do they have meaning.
736.564	So let's go back to those two beings
736.564	conceived at the beginning of this talk.
740.378	We have two beings, both conceived
742.26	in the middle of 1979
742.26	on the exact same day.
745.775	Let's imagine one of them, Mary,
745.775	is born three months prematurely,
749.549	so she's born on June 1, 1980.
752.075	Henry, by contrast, is born at term,
752.075	so he's born on March 1, 1980.
756.846	Simply by virtue of the fact
758.662	that Mary was born
758.662	prematurely three months,
761.144	she comes into all sorts of rights
761.144	three months earlier than Henry does --
765.41	the right to consent to sex,
765.41	the right to vote, the right to drink.
769.649	Henry has to wait for all of that,
771.306	not because he's actually
771.306	any different in age, biologically,
774.344	except in terms of when he was born.
777.249	We find other kinds of weirdness
777.249	in terms of what their rights are.
780.433	Henry, by virtue of being
780.433	assumed to be male --
782.65	although I haven't told you
782.65	that he's the XY one --
785.065	by virtue of being assumed to be male
785.065	is now liable to be drafted,
789.26	which Mary does not need to worry about.
791.224	Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states
791.224	have the same right
795.021	that Henry has in all the states,
796.645	namely, the right to marry.
798.151	Henry can marry, in every state, a woman,
800.939	but Mary can only marry today
800.939	in a few states, a woman.
804.479	So we have these anatomical
804.479	categories that persist,
807.396	that are in many ways
807.396	problematic and questionable.
811.169	And the question to me becomes:
812.914	What do we do, as our science
812.914	gets to be so good in looking at anatomy,
818.926	that we reach the point
818.926	where we have to admit
821.52	that a democracy
821.52	that's been based on anatomy
824.421	might start falling apart?
827.14	I don't want to give up the science,
827.14	but at the same time,
829.888	it feels sometimes like the science
829.888	is coming out from under us.
833.06	So where do we go?
835.089	It seems like what happens in our culture
835.089	is a sort of pragmatic attitude:
839.194	"""We have to draw the line somewhere,"
839.194	"so we will draw the line somewhere."""
842.656	But a lot of people get stuck
842.656	in a very strange position.
845.366	So for example, Texas has at one point
845.366	decided that what it means to marry a man
850.26	is to mean that you don't have
850.26	a Y chromosome,
852.679	and what it means to marry a woman
852.679	means you have a Y chromosome.
855.773	In practice they don't test people
855.773	for their chromosomes.
858.519	But this is also very bizarre,
860.026	because of the story I told you
860.026	at the beginning
862.37	about androgen insensitivity syndrome.
864.204	If we look at one of the Founding Fathers
864.204	of modern democracy,
867.76	Dr. Martin Luther King,
868.964	he offers us something of a solution
868.964	"in his ""I have a dream"" speech."
872.191	He says we should judge people
872.191	"""based not on the color of their skin,"
875.482	"but on the content of their character,"""
877.377	moving beyond anatomy.
878.923	"And I want to say, ""Yeah, that sounds"
878.923	"like a really good idea."""
881.926	But in practice, how do you do it?
883.606	How do you judge people based
883.606	on the content of character?
887.093	I also want to point out
888.269	that I'm not sure that is how we should
888.269	distribute rights in terms of humans,
892.104	because, I have to admit, that there
892.104	are some golden retrievers I know
895.431	that are probably more deserving of social
895.431	services than some humans I know.
899.032	I also want to say there are probably
899.032	also some yellow Labradors that I know
902.651	that are more capable of informed,
902.651	intelligent, mature decisions
905.698	about sexual relations
905.698	than some 40-year-olds that I know.
908.444	So how do we operationalize
908.444	the question of content of character?
912.646	It turns out to be really difficult.
914.595	And part of me also wonders,
916.1	what if content of character
917.996	turns out to be something
917.996	that's scannable in the future --
921.981	able to be seen with an fMRI?
924.314	Do we really want to go there?
926.36	I'm not sure where we go.
927.72	What I do know is that it seems
927.72	to be really important
930.295	to think about the idea
930.295	of the United States being in the lead
933.262	of thinking about this issue of democracy.
935.29	We've done a really good job
935.29	struggling with democracy,
938.025	and I think we would do
938.025	a good job in the future.
940.383	We don't have a situation
940.383	that Iran has, for example,
943.01	where a man who's sexually
943.01	attracted to other men
945.327	is liable to be murdered,
946.548	unless he's willing
946.548	to submit to a sex change,
948.743	in which case he's allowed to live.
951.168	We don't have that kind of situation.
952.983	I'm glad to say we don't have
952.983	the kind of situation with --
956.306	a surgeon I talked to a few years ago
958.313	who had brought over a set
958.313	of conjoined twins
960.773	in order to separate them,
960.773	partly to make a name for himself.
963.708	But when I was on the phone with him,
963.708	asking why he'll do this surgery --
967.182	this was a very high-risk surgery --
967.182	his answer was that, in this other nation,
970.932	these children were going to be treated
970.932	very badly, and so he had to do this.
974.589	"My response to him was, ""Well,"
974.589	have you considered political asylum
977.765	"instead of a separation surgery?"""
979.396	The United States has offered
979.396	tremendous possibility
981.869	for allowing people
981.869	to be the way they are,
984.26	without having them have
984.26	to be changed for the sake of the state.
987.982	So I think we have to be in the lead.
990.184	Well, just to close,
990.184	I want to suggest to you
992.665	that I've been talking
992.665	a lot about the Fathers.
995.22	And I want to think
995.22	about the possibilities
997.26	of what democracy might look like,
997.26	or might have looked like,
1000.189	if we had more involved the mothers.
1002.645	And I want to say something
1002.645	a little bit radical for a feminist,
1005.707	and that is that I think that there may be
1005.707	different kinds of insights
1009.576	that can come from different
1009.576	kinds of anatomies,
1011.849	particularly when we have
1011.849	people thinking in groups.
1014.495	For years, because
1014.495	I've been interested in intersex,
1017.026	I've also been interested
1017.026	in sex-difference research.
1019.527	And one of the things
1019.527	that I've been interested in
1021.904	is looking at the differences
1021.904	between males and females
1024.53	in terms of the way they think
1024.53	and operate in the world.
1027.193	And what we know
1027.193	from cross-cultural studies
1029.29	is that females, on average --
1031.154	not everyone, but on average --
1033.26	are more inclined to be very attentive
1033.26	to complex social relations
1038.175	and to taking care of people
1039.777	who are, basically,
1039.777	vulnerable within the group.
1042.779	And so if we think about that,
1045.01	we have an interesting situation in hands.
1047.035	Years ago, when I was in graduate school,
1049.025	one of my graduate advisors
1049.025	who knew I was interested in feminism --
1052.246	I considered myself
1052.246	a feminist, as I still do,
1054.506	asked a really strange question.
1056.079	"He said, ""Tell me what's feminine"
1056.079	"about feminism."""
1059.012	"And I thought, ""Well, that's the dumbest"
1059.012	question I've ever heard.
1062.207	Feminism is all about undoing
1062.207	stereotypes about gender,
1064.805	so there's nothing
1064.805	"feminine about feminism."""
1066.891	But the more I thought about his question,
1068.94	the more I thought there might be
1068.94	something feminine about feminism.
1072.182	That is to say, there might be
1072.182	something, on average,
1074.915	different about female
1074.915	brains from male brains
1077.811	that makes us more attentive
1077.811	to deeply complex social relationships,
1082.899	and more attentive
1082.899	to taking care of the vulnerable.
1085.756	So whereas the Fathers
1085.756	were extremely attentive
1088.283	to figuring out how to protect
1088.283	individuals from the state,
1092.118	it's possible that if we injected
1092.118	more mothers into this concept,
1095.987	what we would have is more of a concept
1095.987	of not just how to protect,
1099.617	but how to care for each other.
1101.961	And maybe that's where
1101.961	we need to go in the future,
1104.558	when we take democracy beyond anatomy,
1106.789	is to think less about the individual body
1106.789	in terms of the identity,
1110.348	and think more about those relationships.
1112.722	So that as we the people
1112.722	try to create a more perfect union,
1116.211	we're thinking about what we do
1116.211	for each other.
1119.128	Thank you.
1120.303	(Applause)
