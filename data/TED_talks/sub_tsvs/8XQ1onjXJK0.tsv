12.764	G'day, my name's Kevin.
14.923	I'm from Australia. I'm here to help.
17.616	(Laughter)
20.147	Tonight, I want to talk about
20.147	a tale of two cities.
24.814	One of those cities is called Washington,
24.814	and the other is called Beijing.
30.248	Because how these two capitals
30.248	shape their future
36.284	and the future of the United States
36.284	and the future of China
39.489	doesn't just affect those two countries,
41.578	it affects all of us
43.9	in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:
46.78	the air we breathe, the water we drink,
51.145	the fish we eat,
51.145	the quality of our oceans,
54.279	the languages we speak in the future,
57.948	the jobs we have,
57.948	the political systems we choose,
60.873	and, of course, the great questions
60.873	of war and peace.
66.024	You see that bloke? He's French.
69.279	His name is Napoleon.
71.109	A couple of hundred years ago,
72.645	he made this extraordinary projection:
75.083	"""China is a sleeping lion,"
75.083	and when she awakes,
77.707	"the world will shake."""
79.913	Napoleon got a few things wrong;
82.096	he got this one absolutely right.
84.789	Because China is today
84.789	not just woken up,
89.061	China has stood up
89.061	and China is on the march,
92.521	and the question for us all
94.541	is where will China go
96.515	and how do we engage
96.515	this giant of the 21st century?
103.003	You start looking at the numbers,
103.003	they start to confront you in a big way.
107.381	It's projected that China will become,
110.492	by whichever measure --
110.492	PPP, market exchange rates --
113.906	the largest economy in the world
115.833	over the course of the decade ahead.
118.039	They're already
118.039	the largest trading nation,
120.19	already the largest exporting nation,
122.341	already the largest manufacturing nation,
124.494	and they're also the biggest
124.494	emitters of carbon in the world.
128.859	America comes second.
131.343	So if China does become
131.343	the world's largest economy,
136.869	think about this:
138.495	It'll be the first time
141.513	since this guy was on
141.513	the throne of England --
146.18	George III, not a good friend
146.18	of Napoleon's --
149.663	that in the world we will have
149.663	as the largest economy
155.102	a non-English speaking country,
157.488	a non-Western country,
159.694	a non-liberal democratic country.
162.021	And if you don't think
162.021	that's going to affect
164.314	the way in which the world
164.314	happens in the future,
167.077	then personally, I think
167.077	you've been smoking something,
170.305	and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.
174.925	So in short, the question
174.925	we have tonight is,
177.711	how do we understand this mega-change,
180.707	which I believe to be the biggest change
180.707	for the first half of the 21st century?
185.49	It'll affect so many things.
188.415	It will go to the absolute core.
190.157	It's happening quietly.
190.157	It's happening persistently.
192.804	It's happening in some senses
192.804	under the radar,
195.358	as we are all preoccupied with
197.103	what's going in Ukraine,
197.103	what's going on in the Middle East,
199.932	what's going on with ISIS,
199.932	what's going on with ISIL,
202.44	what's happening with
202.44	the future of our economies.
205.412	This is a slow and quiet revolution.
209.684	And with a mega-change
209.684	comes also a mega-challenge,
215.373	and the mega-challenge is this:
217.044	Can these two great countries,
219.297	China and the United States --
221.897	China,
227.725	the Middle Kingdom,
229.374	and the United States,
234.343	Měiguó --
237.547	which in Chinese, by the way,
237.547	"means ""the beautiful country."""
240.89	Think about that -- that's the name
240.89	that China has given this country
244.514	for more than a hundred years.
246.254	Whether these two great civilizations,
246.254	these two great countries,
249.853	can in fact carve out a common future
254.056	for themselves and for the world?
256.633	In short, can we carve out a future
259.605	which is peaceful and mutually prosperous,
263.044	or are we looking at a great challenge
264.948	of war or peace?
267.316	And I have 15 minutes
267.316	to work through war or peace,
269.94	which is a little less time
273.493	than they gave this guy to write a book
273.493	"called ""War and Peace."""
278.486	People ask me, why is it that a kid
278.486	growing up in rural Australia
282.664	got interested in learning Chinese?
284.452	Well, there are two reasons for that.
286.31	Here's the first of them.
287.936	That's Betsy the cow.
289.955	Now, Betsy the cow was one
289.955	of a herd of dairy cattle
293.88	that I grew up with on a farm
293.88	in rural Australia.
297.05	See those hands there?
297.05	These are not built for farming.
300.543	So very early on, I discovered
300.543	that in fact, working in a farm
304.281	was not designed for me,
304.281	and China was a very safe remove
307.927	from any career in Australian farm life.
310.318	Here's the second reason.
312.013	That's my mom.
312.918	Anyone here ever listen
312.918	to what their mom told them to do?
315.682	Everyone ever do what
315.682	their mom told them to do?
318.352	I rarely did,
320.256	but what my mom said to me was,
322.151	one day, she handed me a newspaper,
325.03	a headline which said,
325.03	here we have a huge change.
330.881	And that change is China
330.881	entering the United Nations.
339.193	and she handed me this headline.
341.47	"And she said, ""Understand this, "
341.47	learn this,
343.657	"because it's going to affect your future."""
346.563	So being a very good student of history,
350.361	I decided that the best thing
350.361	for me to do was, in fact,
353.032	to go off and learn Chinese.
355.284	The great thing about learning Chinese
357.397	is that your Chinese teacher
357.397	gives you a new name.
360.508	And so they gave me this name:
363.434	Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer,
368.565	and Wén, and that's the character
368.565	for literature or the arts.
373.163	Kè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.
377.528	"Any of you guys called ""Kevin""?"
380.175	It's a major lift from being called Kevin
380.175	to be called Conqueror of the Classics.
384.256	(Laughter)
385.907	I've been called Kevin all my life.
387.649	Have you been called Kevin all your life?
389.637	Would you prefer to be called
389.637	Conqueror of the Classics?
392.838	And so I went off after that
392.838	and joined the Australian Foreign Service,
396.396	but here is where pride -- before pride,
396.396	there always comes a fall.
403.022	So there I am in the embassy in Beijing,
405.53	off to the Great Hall of the People
407.736	with our ambassador, who had asked me
407.736	to interpret for his first meeting
411.13	in the Great Hall of the People.
413.146	And so there was I.
414.634	If you've been to a Chinese meeting,
414.634	it's a giant horseshoe.
417.475	At the head of the horsehoe
417.475	are the really serious pooh-bahs,
420.353	and down the end of the horseshoe
420.353	are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,
423.515	the junior woodchucks like me.
425.94	And so the ambassador
425.94	began with this inelegant phrase.
428.726	"He said, ""China and Australia"
428.726	are currently enjoying a relationship
433.37	"of unprecedented closeness."""
436.922	And I thought to myself,
438.408	"""That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd."
442.17	"I will improve it."""
444.468	Note to file: Never do that.
447.202	It needed to be a little more elegant,
447.202	a little more classical,
450.191	so I rendered it as follows.
452.49	[In Chinese]
457.621	There was a big pause
457.621	on the other side of the room.
460.848	You could see the giant pooh-bahs
460.848	at the head of the horseshoe,
464.633	the blood visibly draining
464.633	from their faces,
467.628	and the junior woodchucks
467.628	at the other end of the horseshoe
470.577	engaged in peals of 
470.577	unrestrained laughter.
473.364	Because when I rendered his sentence,
475.158	"""Australia and China are "
475.158	enjoying a relationship
477.473	"of unprecedented closeness,"""
479.558	in fact, what I said was that
479.558	Australia and China
482.024	were now experiencing fantastic orgasm.
485.252	(Laughter)
491.428	That was the last time
491.428	I was asked to interpret.
495.05	But in that little story,
495.05	there's a wisdom, which is,
497.558	as soon as you think you know something
497.558	about this extraordinary civilization
501.412	of 5,000 years of continuing history,
503.618	there's always something new to learn.
507.58	History is against us
509.678	when it comes to the U.S. and China
511.907	forging a common future together.
514.206	This guy up here?
515.644	He's not Chinese and he's not American.
517.573	He's Greek. His name's Thucydides.
519.802	He wrote the history
519.802	of the Peloponnesian Wars.
522.286	And he made this extraordinary observation
525.064	about Athens and Sparta.
527.412	"""It was the rise of Athens"
527.412	and the fear that this inspired in Sparta
530.622	"that made war inevitable."""
532.154	And hence, a whole literature about
532.154	something called the Thucydides Trap.
537.471	This guy here? He's not American
537.471	and he's not Greek. He's Chinese.
541.303	His name is Sun Tzu.
541.303	"He wrote ""The Art of War,"""
543.674	and if you see his statement underneath,
543.674	it's along these lines:
547.197	"""Attack him where he is unprepared,"
547.197	"appear where you are not expected."""
552.424	Not looking good so far
552.424	for China and the United States.
556.43	This guy is an American.
556.43	His name's Graham Allison.
559.309	In fact, he's a teacher
559.309	at the Kennedy School
561.909	over there in Boston.
563.187	He's working on a single project
563.187	at the moment, which is,
566.159	does the Thucydides Trap
566.159	about the inevitably of war
569.34	between rising powers
569.34	and established great powers
572.428	apply to the future
572.428	of China-U.S. relations?
575.4	It's a core question.
576.819	And what Graham has done
576.819	is explore 15 cases in history
580.86	since the 1500s
583.321	to establish what the precedents are.
585.852	And in 11 out of 15 of them,
587.848	let me tell you,
589.915	they've ended in catastrophic war.
593.05	"You may say, ""But Kevin --"
596.486	or Conqueror of the Classics --
598.785	that was the past.
600.967	We live now in a world
600.967	of interdependence and globalization.
604.102	"It could never happen again."""
605.565	Guess what?
606.911	The economic historians
606.911	tell us that in fact,
609.581	the time which we reached
609.581	the greatest point
611.9	of economic integration and globalization
614.719	was in 1914,
617.29	just before that happened, World War I,
621.423	a sobering reflection from history.
624.511	So if we are engaged
624.511	in this great question
627.065	of how China thinks, feels,
630.27	and positions itself
630.27	towards the United States,
634.147	and the reverse,
635.633	how do we get to the baseline
637.514	of how these two countries
637.514	and civilizations
640.904	can possibly work together?
643.83	Let me first go to, in fact,
646.128	China's views of the U.S.
646.128	and the rest of the West.
648.729	Number one: China feels
648.729	as if it's been humiliated
651.604	at the hands of the West
651.604	through a hundred years of history,
654.487	beginning with the Opium Wars.
656.275	When after that, the Western powers
656.275	carved China up into little pieces,
660.083	so that by the time
660.083	it got to the '20s and '30s,
662.614	signs like this one appeared
662.614	on the streets of Shanghai.
665.291	"[""No dogs and Chinese allowed""]"
666.786	How would you feel if you were Chinese, 
668.756	in your own country, 
668.756	if you saw that sign appear?
671.539	China also believes and feels
675.407	as if, in the events of 1919,
675.407	at the Peace Conference in Paris,
680.028	when Germany's colonies were given back
681.924	to all sorts of countries
681.924	around in the world,
684.068	what about German colonies in China?
685.926	They were, in fact, given to Japan.
688.48	When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s
692.589	the world looked away and was indifferent
692.589	to what would happen to China.
696.257	And then, on top of that,
696.257	the Chinese to this day believe
699.114	that the United States and the West
700.801	do not accept the legitimacy
700.801	of their political system
703.333	because it's so radically different
703.333	from those of us who come
706.223	from liberal democracies,
707.513	and believe that the United States
707.513	to this day is seeking
710.329	to undermine their political system.
712.767	China also believes
712.767	that it is being contained
715.785	by U.S. allies and by those
715.785	with strategic partnerships with the U.S.
720.638	right around its periphery.
723.262	And beyond all that,
723.262	the Chinese have this feeling
725.746	in their heart of hearts
725.746	and in their gut of guts
728.974	that those of us in the collective West
733.176	are just too damned arrogant.
736.868	That is, we don't recognize
736.868	the problems in our own system,
740.815	in our politics and our economics,
742.673	and are very quick
742.673	to point the finger elsewhere,
745.064	and believe that, in fact,
745.064	we in the collective West
748.826	are guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.
752.634	Of course, in international relations,
756.047	it's not just the sound
756.047	of one hand clapping.
760.006	There's another country too,
760.006	and that's called the U.S.
762.688	So how does the U.S.
762.688	respond to all of the above?
765.242	The U.S. has a response to each of those.
767.378	On the question of
767.378	is the U.S. containing China,
769.881	"they say, ""No, look at the history of"
769.881	"the Soviet Union. That was containment."""
773.559	Instead, what we have done
773.559	in the U.S. and the West
775.969	is welcome China
775.969	into the global economy,
777.943	and on top of that, welcome them
777.943	into the World Trade Organization.
781.379	The U.S. and the West say China cheats
783.252	on the question
783.252	of intellectual property rights,
785.558	and through cyberattacks
785.558	on U.S. and global firms.
789.877	Furthermore, the United States
789.877	says that the Chinese political system
793.453	is fundamentally wrong
796.332	because it's at such fundamental variance
799.629	to the human rights, democracy,
799.629	and rule of law that we enjoy
802.88	in the U.S. and the collective West.
805.504	And on top of all the above,
805.504	what does the United States say?
808.661	That they fear that China will,
808.661	when it has sufficient power,
813.769	establish a sphere of influence
813.769	in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,
817.786	boot the United States out,
819.69	and in time, when it's powerful enough,
821.71	unilaterally seek to change
821.71	the rules of the global order.
825.719	So apart from all of that,
825.719	it's just fine and dandy,
828.421	the U.S.-China relationship.
829.815	No real problems there.
832.02	The challenge, though,
832.02	is given those deep-rooted feelings,
836.942	those deep-rooted emotions
836.942	and thought patterns,
839.937	"what the Chinese call ""Sīwéi,"""
839.937	ways of thinking,
842.747	how can we craft a basis
842.747	for a common future between these two?
847.205	I argue simply this:
848.836	We can do it on the basis on a framework
850.781	of constructive realism
850.781	for a common purpose.
855.356	What do I mean by that?
857.329	Be realistic about the things
857.329	that we disagree on,
859.674	and a management approach
859.674	that doesn't enable
861.949	any one of those differences
861.949	to break into war or conflict
864.805	until we've acquired
864.805	the diplomatic skills to solve them.
868.358	Be constructive in areas of the
868.358	bilateral, regional and global engagement
872.014	between the two,
873.386	which will make a difference
873.386	for all of humankind.
876.113	Build a regional institution
876.113	capable of cooperation in Asia,
880.106	an Asia-Pacific community.
882.034	And worldwide, act further,
884.448	like you've begun to do
884.448	at the end of last year
887.072	by striking out against climate change
889.301	with hands joined together
889.301	rather than fists apart.
893.295	Of course, all that happens
893.295	if you've got a common mechanism
896.197	and political will to achieve the above.
898.31	These things are deliverable.
901.004	But the question is,
901.004	are they deliverable alone?
905.02	This is what our head
905.02	tells us we need to do,
907.969	but what about our heart?
909.873	I have a little experience
909.873	in the question back home
912.915	of how you try to bring
912.915	together two peoples
916.235	who, frankly, haven't had
916.235	a whole lot in common in the past.
919.857	And that's when I apologized
919.857	to Australia's indigenous peoples.
923.434	This was a day of reckoning
923.434	in the Australian government,
927.219	the Australian parliament,
927.219	and for the Australian people.
929.911	After 200 years of unbridled abuse
929.911	towards the first Australians,
934.694	it was high time that we white folks
934.694	said we were sorry.
939.872	The important thing --
941.242	(Applause)
946.288	The important thing that I remember
946.288	is staring in the faces
949.21	of all those from Aboriginal Australia
951.691	as they came to listen to this apology.
954.5	It was extraordinary to see, for example,
958.308	old women telling me the stories
958.308	of when they were five years old
962.232	and literally ripped away
962.232	from their parents,
965.228	like this lady here.
966.829	It was extraordinary for me
966.829	to then be able to embrace
970.962	and to kiss Aboriginal elders
970.962	as they came into the parliament building,
974.91	and one woman said to me,
976.166	it's the first time a white fella
976.166	had ever kissed her in her life,
979.321	and she was over 70.
981.272	That's a terrible story.
983.779	And then I remember
983.779	this family saying to me,
986.241	"""You know, we drove all the way"
986.241	from the far North down to Canberra
990.304	to come to this thing,
991.674	drove our way through redneck country.
993.857	On the way back, stopped at a cafe
993.857	"after the apology for a milkshake."""
1000.474	And they walked into this cafe
1000.474	quietly, tentatively, gingerly,
1006.046	a little anxious.
1007.509	I think you know what I'm talking about.
1010.063	But the day after the apology,
1010.063	what happened?
1013.871	Everyone in that cafe,
1013.871	every one of the white folks,
1017.981	stood up and applauded.
1020.767	Something had happened in the hearts
1020.767	of these people in Australia.
1025.903	The white folks, our Aboriginal
1025.903	brothers and sisters,
1028.592	and we haven't solved
1028.592	all these problems together,
1031.82	but let me tell you,
1031.82	there was a new beginning
1035.488	because we had gone not just to the head,
1037.904	we'd gone also to the heart.
1040.562	So where does that conclude
1040.562	in terms of the great question
1043.433	that we've been asked
1043.433	to address this evening,
1045.62	which is the future
1045.62	of U.S.-China relations?
1048.584	The head says there's a way forward.
1050.883	The head says there is a policy framework,
1050.883	there's a common narrative,
1054.574	there's a mechanism
1054.574	through regular summitry
1056.501	to do these things
1056.501	and to make them better.
1058.405	But the heart must also find a way
1058.405	to reimagine the possibilities
1063.978	of the America-China relationship,
1065.882	and the possibilities of China's
1065.882	future engagement in the world.
1069.542	Sometimes, folks, we just need
1069.542	to take a leap of faith
1075.625	not quite knowing where we might land.
1079.549	In China, they now talk about
1079.549	the Chinese Dream.
1083.822	In America, we're all familiar
1083.822	"with the term ""the American Dream."""
1089.348	I think it's time, across the world,
1092.482	that we're able to think also
1092.482	of something we might also call
1097.614	a dream for all humankind.
1103.368	Because if we do that,
1105.327	we might just change the way
1107.977	that we think about each other.
1115.923	[In Chinese]
1119.034	That's my challenge to America.
1119.034	That's my challenge to China.
1122.401	That's my challenge to all of us,
1124.885	but I think where there's a will
1124.885	and where there is imagination
1128.182	we can turn this into a future
1130.226	driven by peace and prosperity
1132.571	and not once again repeat
1134.591	the tragedies of war.
1136.704	I thank you.
1138.562	(Applause)
1143.997	Chris Anderson: Thanks so much for that.
1143.997	Thanks so much for that.
1147.176	It feels like you yourself
1147.176	have a role to play in this bridging.
1151.773	You, in a way, are uniquely placed
1151.773	to speak to both sides.
1156.124	Kevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians
1156.124	do best is organize the drinks,
1159.377	so you get them together in one room,
1159.377	and we suggest this and suggest that,
1162.904	then we go and get the drinks.
1164.337	But no, look, for all of us
1164.337	who are friends
1166.341	of these two great countries,
1166.341	America and China,
1168.603	you can do something.
1169.942	You can make a practical contribution,
1172.241	and for all you good folks here,
1174.122	next time you meet someone from China,
1175.747	sit down and have a conversation.
1177.359	See what you can find out about
1177.359	where they come from and what they think,
1180.814	and my challenge for all
1180.814	the Chinese folks
1182.852	who are going to watch
1182.852	this TED Talk at some time
1185.181	is do the same.
1187.542	Two of us seeking to change the world
1187.542	can actually make a huge difference.
1191.443	Those of us up the middle,
1191.443	we can make a small contribution.
1194.345	CA: Kevin, all power to you,
1194.345	my friend. Thank you.
1196.701	KR: Thank you. Thank you, folks.
1198.827	(Applause)
