12.325	In the middle of my Ph.D.,
14.388	I was hopelessly stuck.
17.85	Every research direction that I tried
19.63	led to a dead end.
21.246	It seemed like my basic assumptions
23.148	just stopped working.
25.076	I felt like a pilot flying through the mist,
28.075	and I lost all sense of direction.
30.87	I stopped shaving.
32.351	I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.
35.092	I felt unworthy
36.825	of stepping across the gates of the university,
39.978	because I wasn't like Einstein or Newton
42.126	or any other scientist whose results
44.279	I had learned about, because in science,
45.81	we just learn about the results, not the process.
49.192	And so obviously, I couldn't be a scientist.
53.893	But I had enough support
55.557	and I made it through
56.954	and discovered something new about nature.
59.174	This is an amazing feeling of calmness,
61.917	being the only person in the world
63.249	who knows a new law of nature.
65.474	And I started the second project in my Ph.D,
68.516	and it happened again.
69.88	I got stuck and I made it through.
72.169	And I started thinking,
73.555	maybe there's a pattern here.
74.712	I asked the other graduate students, and they said,
76.553	"""Yeah, that's exactly what happened to us,"
78.596	"except nobody told us about it."""
80.945	We'd all studied science as if it's a series
82.895	of logical steps between question and answer,
86.471	but doing research is nothing like that.
89.217	At the same time, I was also studying
91.551	to be an improvisation theater actor.
93.638	So physics by day,
95.072	and by night, laughing, jumping, singing,
97.09	playing my guitar.
98.402	Improvisation theater,
99.881	just like science, goes into the unknown,
102.89	because you have to make a scene onstage
104.302	without a director, without a script,
106.005	without having any idea what you'll portray
108.283	or what the other characters will do.
110.689	But unlike science,
112.538	in improvisation theater, they tell you from day one
115.561	what's going to happen to
115.561	you when you get onstage.
117.776	You're going to fail miserably.
120.548	You're going to get stuck.
121.725	And we would practice staying creative
123.843	inside that stuck place.
125.046	For example, we had an exercise
126.951	where we all stood in a circle,
128.093	and each person had to do
128.093	the world's worst tap dance,
131.058	and everybody else applauded
132.644	and cheered you on,
133.886	supporting you onstage.
136.649	When I became a professor
138.557	and had to guide my own students
139.938	through their research projects,
141.911	I realized again,
143.278	I don't know what to do.
144.99	I'd studied thousands of hours of physics,
146.984	biology, chemistry,
148.598	but not one hour, not one concept
150.97	on how to mentor, how to guide someone
153.556	to go together into the unknown,
155.293	about motivation.
157.214	So I turned to improvisation theater,
159.144	and I told my students from day one
161.317	what's going to happen when you start research,
164.218	and this has to do with our mental schema
165.944	of what research will be like.
167.956	Because you see, whenever people do anything,
170.234	for example if I want to touch this blackboard,
172.876	my brain first builds up a schema,
174.536	a prediction of exactly what my muscles will do
176.395	before I even start moving my hand,
178.551	and if I get blocked,
180.399	if my schema doesn't match reality,
182.274	that causes extra stress called cognitive dissonance.
184.558	That's why your schemas had better match reality.
187.467	But if you believe the way science is taught,
190.622	and if you believe textbooks, you're liable
192.519	to have the following schema of research.
198.813	If A is the question,
202.131	and B is the answer,
205.531	then research is a direct path.
210.127	The problem is that if an experiment doesn't work,
213.242	or a student gets depressed,
216.904	it's perceived as something utterly wrong
218.99	and causes tremendous stress.
222.02	And that's why I teach my students
223.803	a more realistic schema.
230.86	Here's an example
232.384	where things don't match your schema.
238.379	(Laughter)
241.641	(Applause)
253.564	So I teach my students a different schema.
257.01	If A is the question,
259.204	B is the answer,
265.32	stay creative in the cloud,
266.855	and you start going,
268.83	and experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
271.193	experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
273.728	until you reach a place linked
273.728	with negative emotions
276.404	where it seems like your basic assumptions
278.682	have stopped making sense,
279.798	like somebody yanked the carpet beneath your feet.
282.853	And I call this place the cloud.
299.685	Now you can be lost in the cloud
302.363	for a day, a week, a month, a year,
304.871	a whole career,
306.369	but sometimes, if you're lucky enough
308.531	and you have enough support,
310.387	you can see in the materials at hand,
312.377	or perhaps meditating on the shape of the cloud,
315.625	a new answer,
319.285	C, and you decide to go for it.
322.969	And experiments don't work, experiments don't work,
325.338	but you get there,
326.807	and then you tell everyone about it
328.027	by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C,
331.529	which is a great way to communicate,
333.488	but as long as you don't forget the path
335.832	that brought you there.
337.631	Now this cloud is an inherent part
339.606	of research, an inherent part of our craft,
342.21	because the cloud stands guard at the boundary.
349.721	It stands guard at the boundary
351.99	between the known
357.795	and the unknown,
365.11	because in order to discover something truly new,
367.385	at least one of your basic
367.385	assumptions has to change,
370.962	and that means that in science,
372.216	we do something quite heroic.
374.178	Every day, we try to bring ourselves
375.999	to the boundary between
375.999	the known and the unknown
377.811	and face the cloud.
379.632	Now notice that I put B
381.337	in the land of the known,
382.08	because we knew about it in the beginning,
383.891	but C is always more interesting
387.54	and more important than B.
390.263	So B is essential in order to get going,
392.456	but C is much more profound,
394.274	and that's the amazing thing about resesarch.
398.771	Now just knowing that word, the cloud,
400.959	has been transformational in my research group,
403.514	because students come to me and say,
405.384	"""Uri, I'm in the cloud,"""
406.982	"and I say, ""Great, you must be feeling miserable."""
410.148	(Laughter)
412.29	But I'm kind of happy,
414.203	because we might be close to the boundary
415.881	between the known and the unknown,
417.777	and we stand a chance of discovering
419.323	something truly new,
421.184	since the way our mind works,
422.526	it's just knowing that the cloud
425.674	is normal, it's essential,
430.1	and in fact beautiful,
431.305	we can join the Cloud Appreciation Society,
434.928	and it detoxifies the feeling that something
436.846	is deeply wrong with me.
439.408	And as a mentor, I know what to do,
441.858	which is to step up my support for the student,
444.06	because research in psychology shows
445.541	that if you're feeling fear and despair,
449.1	your mind narrows down
450.097	to very safe and conservative ways of thinking.
452.928	If you'd like to explore the risky paths
454.503	needed to get out of the cloud,
455.891	you need other emotions --
457.652	solidarity, support, hope —
459.853	that come with your connection from somebody else,
461.59	so like in improvisation theater,
463.14	in science, it's best to walk into the unknown
465.441	together.
467.41	So knowing about the cloud,
469.852	you also learn from improvisation theater
473.176	a very effective way to have conversations
475.778	inside the cloud.
477.538	It's based on the central principle
479.515	of improvisation theater,
481.282	so here improvisation theater
482.375	came to my help again.
483.671	"It's called saying ""Yes, and"""
485.962	to the offers made by other actors.
496.297	That means accepting the offers
499.191	"and building on them, saying, ""Yes, and."""
501.702	For example, if one actor says,
502.941	"""Here is a pool of water,"""
504.096	and the other actor says,
505.141	"""No, that's just a stage,"""
507.01	the improvisation is over.
508.748	It's dead, and everybody feels frustrated.
512.52	That's called blocking.
513.868	If you're not mindful of communications,
515.475	scientific conversations can have a lot of blocking.
518.412	"Saying ""Yes, and"" sounds like this."
520.648	"""Here is a pool of water."""
520.648	"""Yeah, let's jump in."""
523.156	"""Look, there's a whale! Let's grab it by its tail."
526.165	"It's pulling us to the moon!"""
528.266	"So saying ""Yes, and"" bypasses our inner critic."
531.286	We all have an inner critic
532.98	that kind of guards what we say,
534.221	so people don't think that we're obscene
536.144	or crazy or unoriginal,
537.259	and science is full of the fear
538.519	of appearing unoriginal.
540.076	"Saying ""Yes, and"" bypasses the critic"
542.243	and unlocks hidden voices of creativity
544.855	you didn't even know that you had,
546.38	and they often carry the answer
548.41	about the cloud.
550.815	So you see, knowing about the cloud
553.416	"and about saying ""Yes, and"""
554.82	made my lab very creative.
557.679	Students started playing off of each others' ideas,
560.207	and we made surprising discoveries
562.321	in the interface between physics and biology.
565.19	For example, we were stuck for a year
568.14	trying to understand the intricate
569.289	biochemical networks inside our cells,
571.982	"and we said, ""We are deeply in the cloud,"""
574.439	and we had a playful conversation
576.419	where my student Shai Shen Orr said,
578.207	"""Let's just draw this on a"
578.207	"piece of paper, this network,"""
581.05	and instead of saying,
582.503	"""But we've done that so many times"
584.654	"and it doesn't work,"""
585.688	"I said, ""Yes, and"
588.631	"let's use a very big piece of paper,"""
590.672	and then Ron Milo said,
591.764	"""Let's use a gigantic architect's"
593.984	"blueprint kind of paper, and I know where to print it,"""
595.78	and we printed out the network and looked at it,
598.28	and that's where we made
598.28	our most important discovery,
600.789	that this complicated network is just made
602.99	of a handful of simple, repeating interaction patterns
606.453	like motifs in a stained glass window.
609.616	We call them network motifs,
611.664	and they're the elementary circuits
613.816	that help us understand
615.201	the logic of the way cells make decisions
617.901	in all organisms, including our body.
620.75	Soon enough, after this,
622.675	I started being invited to give talks
624.295	to thousands of scientists across the world,
627.306	but the knowledge about the cloud
629.139	"and saying ""Yes, and"""
630.271	just stayed within my own lab,
632.11	because you see, in science,
632.11	we don't talk about the process,
634.241	anything subjective or emotional.
636.674	We talk about the results.
638.537	So there was no way to talk about it in conferences.
640.606	That was unthinkable.
642.53	And I saw scientists in other groups get stuck
644.606	without even having a word to describe
646.38	what they're seeing,
647.701	and their ways of thinking
649.056	narrowed down to very safe paths,
650.584	their science didn't reach its full potential,
652.244	and they were miserable.
653.997	I thought, that's the way it is.
655.936	I'll try to make my lab as creative as possible,
657.957	and if everybody else does the same,
659.637	science will eventually become
661.827	more and more better and better.
664.041	That way of thinking got turned on its head
666.961	when by chance I went to hear Evelyn Fox Keller
669.3	give a talk about her experiences
670.658	as a woman in science.
672.349	And she asked,
674.172	"""Why is it that we don't talk about the subjective"
676.12	and emotional aspects of doing science?
678.306	"It's not by chance. It's a matter of values."""
682.298	You see, science seeks knowledge
684.476	that's objective and rational.
686.271	That's the beautiful thing about science.
688.469	But we also have a cultural myth
690.425	that the doing of science,
691.679	what we do every day to get that knowledge,
693.979	is also only objective and rational,
696.419	like Mr. Spock.
698.851	And when you label something
700.265	as objective and rational,
702.078	automatically, the other side,
703.72	the subjective and emotional,
705.177	become labeled as non-science
707.279	or anti-science or threatening to science,
709.25	and we just don't talk about it.
711.061	And when I heard that,
713.015	that science has a culture,
715.182	everything clicked into place for me,
716.729	because if science has a culture,
718.393	culture can be changed,
719.649	and I can be a change agent
721.242	working to change the culture
721.242	of science wherever I could.
723.954	And so the very next lecture I gave in a conference,
727.023	I talked about my science,
728.635	and then I talked about the importance
730.147	of the subjective and emotional
730.147	aspects of doing science
732.329	and how we should talk about them,
733.449	and I looked at the audience,
734.683	and they were cold.
737.043	They couldn't hear what I was saying
740.334	in the context of a 10 back-to-back
741.585	PowerPoint presentation conference.
743.424	And I tried again and again,
743.424	conference after conference,
745.906	but I wasn't getting through.
748.279	I was in the cloud.
751.185	And eventually I managed to get out the cloud
754.699	using improvisation and music.
757.51	Since then, every conference I go to,
760.249	I give a science talk and a second, special talk
763.111	"called ""Love and fear in the lab,"""
765.104	and I start it off by doing a song
767.321	about scientists' greatest fear,
769.893	which is that we work hard,
772.805	we discover something new,
775.147	and somebody else publishes it before we do.
778.504	We call it being scooped,
781.12	and being scooped feels horrible.
784.334	It makes us afraid to talk to each other,
786.547	which is no fun,
787.38	because we came to science to share our ideas
790.14	and to learn from each other,
791.451	and so I do a blues song,
797.04	which — (Applause) —
802.544	"called ""Scooped Again,"""
805.767	and I ask the audience to be my backup singers,
808.425	"and I tell them, ""Your text is 'Scoop, Scoop.'"""
812.405	"It sounds like this: ""Scoop, scoop!"""
815.05	Sounds like this.
816.013	♪ I've been scooped again ♪
818.232	♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪
819.975	And then we go for it.
821.253	♪ I've been scooped again ♪
823.298	♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪
824.584	♪ I've been scooped again ♪
826.479	♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪
827.785	♪ I've been scooped again ♪
829.568	♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪
831.207	♪ I've been scooped again ♪
832.875	♪ Scoop! Scoop! ♪
834.637	♪ Oh mama, can't you feel my pain ♪
837.912	♪ Heavens help me, I've been scooped again ♪
842.925	(Applause)
849.735	Thank you.
850.965	Thank you for your backup singing.
852.464	So everybody starts laughing, starts breathing,
854.548	notices that there's other scientists around them
856.56	with shared issues,
857.867	and we start talking about the emotional
859.672	and subjective things that go on in research.
861.522	It feels like a huge taboo has been lifted.
863.706	Finally, we can talk about
863.706	this in a scientific conference.
866.505	And scientists have gone on to form peer groups
868.691	where they meet regularly
870.301	and create a space to talk about the emotional
871.93	and subjective things that
871.93	happen as they're mentoring,
874.231	as they're going into the unknown,
875.594	and even started courses
877.164	about the process of doing science,
878.839	about going into the unknown together,
880.734	and many other things.
882.15	So my vision is that,
883.484	"just like every scientist knows the word ""atom,"""
886.946	that matter is made out of atoms,
888.913	every scientist would know the words
890.397	"like ""the cloud,"" saying ""Yes, and,"""
892.741	and science will become much more creative,
895.82	make many, many more unexpected discoveries
898.824	for the benefit of us all,
901.36	and would also be much more playful.
903.576	And what I might ask you to remember from this talk
906.166	is that next time you face
908.862	a problem you can't solve
910.588	in work or in life,
913.18	there's a word for what you're going to see:
915.056	the cloud.
916.233	And you can go through the cloud
917.766	not alone but together
919.174	with someone who is your source of support
921.212	"to say ""Yes, and"" to your ideas,"
923.26	"to help you say ""Yes, and"" to your own ideas,"
925.577	to increase the chance that,
927.464	through the wisps of the cloud,
929.19	you'll find that moment of calmness
930.688	where you get your first glimpse
932.491	of your unexpected discovery,
935.741	your C.
938.465	Thank you.
940.785	(Applause)
