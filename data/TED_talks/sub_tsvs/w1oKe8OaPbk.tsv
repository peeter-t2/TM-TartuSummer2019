13.157	In the past few months, I've been
13.157	traveling for weeks at a time
16.532	with only one suitcase of clothes.
18.892	One day, I was invited
18.892	to an important event,
21.075	and I wanted to wear
21.075	something special and new for it.
24.14	So I looked through my suitcase
24.14	and I couldn't find anything to wear.
28.133	I was lucky to be at the technology
28.133	conference on that day,
31.087	and I had access to 3D printers.
33.705	So I quickly designed
33.705	a skirt on my computer,
35.966	and I loaded the file on the printer.
38.135	It just printed the pieces overnight.
40.629	The next morning,
40.629	I just took all the pieces,
42.783	assembled them together in my hotel room,
44.774	and this is actually the skirt
44.774	that I'm wearing right now.
47.754	(Applause)
51.678	So it wasn't the first time
51.678	that I printed clothes.
54.485	For my senior collection
54.485	at fashion design school,
56.874	I decided to try and 3D print
56.874	an entire fashion collection from my home.
61.755	The problem was that I barely knew
61.755	anything about 3D printing,
65.236	and I had only nine months to figure out
65.236	how to print five fashionable looks.
71.158	I always felt most creative
71.158	when I worked from home.
73.956	I loved experimenting with new materials,
76.368	and I always tried
76.368	to develop new techniques
78.601	to make the most unique textiles
78.601	for my fashion projects.
82.509	I loved going to old factories
82.509	and weird stores
85.129	in search of leftovers
85.129	of strange powders and weird materials,
89.843	and then bring them home to experiment on.
92.59	As you can probably imagine,
94.097	my roommates didn't like that at all.
96.136	(Laughter)
97.165	So I decided to move on
97.165	to working with big machines,
101.302	ones that didn't fit in my living room.
103.419	I love the exact
103.419	and the custom work I can do
105.57	with all kinds of fashion technologies,
107.74	like knitting machines
107.74	and laser cutting and silk printing.
112.498	One summer break, I came here
112.498	to New York for an internship
115.697	at a fashion house in Chinatown.
118.071	We worked on two incredible dresses
118.071	that were 3D printed.
122.598	They were amazing --
122.598	like you can see here.
125.504	But I had a few issues with them.
127.448	They were made from hard plastics
127.448	and that's why they were very breakable.
131.897	The models couldn't sit in them,
133.458	and they even got scratched
133.458	from the plastics under their arms.
137.444	With 3D printing, the designers
137.444	had so much freedom
140.479	to make the dresses look
140.479	exactly like they wanted,
143.785	but still, they were very dependent
143.785	on big and expensive industrial printers
149.402	that were located in a lab
149.402	far from their studio.
153.451	Later that year, a friend gave me
153.451	a 3D printed necklace,
156.913	printed using a home printer.
159.072	I knew that these printers
159.072	were much cheaper
161.242	and much more accessible
161.242	than the ones we used at my internship.
164.984	So I looked at the necklace,
166.414	"and then I thought, ""If I can"
166.414	print a necklace from home,
169.901	"why not print my clothes from home, too?"""
173.108	I really liked the idea that I wouldn't
173.108	have to go to the market
176.169	and pick fabrics that
176.169	someone else chose to sell --
178.817	I could just design them
178.817	and print them directly from home.
184.184	I found a small makerspace,
186.075	where I learned everything
186.075	I know about 3D printing.
189.036	Right away, they literally
189.036	gave me the key to the lab,
191.655	so I could experiment
191.655	into the night, every night.
195.26	The main challenge was to find the right
195.26	filament for printing clothes with.
199.182	So what is a filament?
200.362	Filament is the material
200.362	you feed the printer with.
202.818	And I spent a month or so
202.818	experimenting with PLA,
205.744	which is a hard and scratchy,
205.744	breakable material.
209.632	The breakthrough came
209.632	when I was introduced to Filaflex,
212.339	which is a new kind of filament.
213.905	It's strong, yet very flexible.
216.269	And with it, I was able to print
216.269	the first garment,
220.127	the red jacket that had
220.127	"the word ""Libert√©"" --"
223.599	"""freedom"" in French --"
224.818	embedded into it.
226.355	I chose this word because I felt
226.355	so empowered and free
229.172	when I could just design
229.172	a garment from my home
231.499	and then print it by myself.
234.328	And actually, you can easily
234.328	download this jacket,
237.766	and easily change the word
237.766	to something else.
240.418	For example, your name
240.418	or your sweetheart's name.
243.507	(Laughter)
245.04	So the printer plates are small,
246.79	so I had to piece the garment
246.79	together, just like a puzzle.
252.238	And I wanted to solve another challenge.
254.513	I wanted to print textiles
256.082	that I would use
256.082	just like regular fabrics.
258.611	That's when I found an open-source file
260.569	from an architect who designed
260.569	a pattern that I love.
263.182	And with it, I was able to print
263.182	a beautiful textile
265.925	that I would use
265.925	just like a regular fabric.
269.167	And it actually even looks
269.167	a little bit like lace.
273.247	So I took his file and I modified it,
273.247	and changed it, played with it --
276.661	many kinds of versions out of it.
279.654	And I needed to print
279.654	another 1,500 more hours
283.862	to complete printing my collection.
286.813	So I brought six printers to my home
286.813	and just printed 24-7.
291.176	And this is actually
291.176	a really slow process,
293.72	but let's remember the Internet
293.72	was significantly slower 20 years ago,
298.087	so 3D printing will also accelerate
300.436	and in no time you'll be able to print
300.436	a T-Shirt in your home
303.443	in just a couple of hours,
303.443	or even minutes.
306.826	So you guys, you want to see
306.826	what it looks like?
309.17	Audience: Yeah!
310.495	(Applause)
314.293	Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing
314.293	one of my five outfits.
317.833	Almost everything here she's wearing,
317.833	I printed from my home.
323.079	Even her shoes are printed.
325.354	Audience: Wow!
326.53	Audience: Cool!
329.766	(Applause)
331.545	Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca.
333.706	(To audience) Thank you, guys.
336.848	So I think in the future,
336.848	materials will evolve,
339.389	and they will look and feel
339.389	like fabrics we know today,
342.594	like cotton or silk.
345.349	Imagine personalized clothes
345.349	that fit exactly to your measurements.
351.537	Music was once a very physical thing.
353.538	You would have to go
353.538	to the record shop and buy CDs,
356.586	but now you can just download the music --
359.26	digital music --
360.443	directly to your phone.
362.505	Fashion is also a very physical thing.
365.3	And I wonder what our world will look like
368.206	when our clothes will be digital,
368.206	just like this skirt is.
372.056	Thank you so much.
373.453	(Applause)
374.677	[Thank You]
375.851	(Applause)
