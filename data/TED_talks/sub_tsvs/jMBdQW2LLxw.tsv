12.491	Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much
13.836	of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,
16.248	but I thought it would just be nice to recap
18.692	on how Derek got to where he is today.
22.628	It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,
25.119	but when Derek was born,
26.737	he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.
29.376	He was born three and a half months premature,
32.34	and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.
37.556	He had to have a lot of oxygen,
38.776	and that affected your eyes, Derek,
40.776	and also the way you understand language
42.604	and the way you understand the world.
45.575	But that was the end of the bad news,
47.657	because when Derek came home from the hospital,
50.648	his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny
53.83	who was going to look after you, Derek,
56.201	really for the rest of your childhood.
58.849	And Nanny's great insight, really,
61.425	was to think, here's a child who can't see.
64.11	Music must be the thing for Derek.
67.031	And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,
71.298	to him for his first few years of life.
74.843	And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice
78.894	hour after hour every day that made him think
81.878	maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,
84.896	some sort of musical gift.
87.905	Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,
90.178	when you were with your nanny.
93.852	Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,
97.371	perhaps we should get Derek something to play,
100.706	and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard
104.342	out of the loft, never thinking really
106.938	that anything much would come of it.
109.281	But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing
112.269	and actually bashed it,
113.89	bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
116.679	But out of all the bashing, after a few months,
120.671	emerged the most fantastic music,
123.84	and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,
127.206	when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world
131.721	out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.
135.321	That was the great eureka moment.
137.834	Now, not being able to see meant, of course,
140.404	that you taught yourself.
141.595	Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.
142.919	AO: You did teach yourself to play,
144.216	and as a consequence,
146.747	playing the piano for you, Derek,
147.798	was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,
150.275	and even a bit of nose going on in there.
152.731	And now, here's what Nanny did also do
156.059	was to press the record button on one of those little
159.381	early tape recorders that they had,
161.939	and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing
164.042	when you were four years old.
165.454	"DP: ""Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."""
168.152	"AO: It wasn't actually ""Cockles and Mussels."""
169.214	"This one is ""English Country Garden."""
171.364	"DP: ""English Country Garden."""
173.629	"(Music: ""English Country Garden"")"
210.521	AO: There you are.
212.319	(Applause)
219.477	I think that's just fantastic.
221.383	You know, there's this little child who can't see,
223.113	can't really understand much about the world,
225.32	has no one in the family who plays an instrument,
228.026	and yet he taught himself to play that.
230.327	And as you can see from the picture,
231.559	there was quite a lot of body action going on
233.918	while you were playing, Derek.
235.719	Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,
240.289	and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,
244.107	because when you played the piano,
245.921	you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,
248.838	and also you had this little habit
250.246	of hitting me out of the way.
252.429	So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,
254.235	I was firmly shoved off.
256.383	And having said to your dad, Nic,
259.067	that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused
261.562	as to how I might go about that
263.149	if I wasn't allowed near the piano.
265.55	But after a while, I thought, well, the only way
267.727	is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,
271.828	and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,
274.972	I could just play something very quickly
277.149	for him to learn.
279.141	And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed
280.543	that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.
284.523	As you can see, there's me in my early,
287.348	pre-marriage days with a brown beard,
289.587	and little Derek concentrating there.
293.233	I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.
295.777	(Laughter)
297.079	Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really
301.3	had taken the world by storm.
303.352	This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican
306.37	with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.
308.081	Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.
312.65	And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,
314.791	and so there was always a moment of tension
317.102	as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play
320.063	and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,
322.574	and all that kind of thing.
324.033	But the orchestra were wowed as well,
326.858	and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability
330.715	to play these fantastic pieces.
334.052	Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?
337.114	And hopefully we can show the audience now
339.685	how it is you do what you do.
342.737	I think that one of the first things that happened
344.57	when you were very little, Derek,
345.847	was that by the time you were two,
348.183	your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.
353.162	And so whenever you heard any note at all --
355.96	if I just play a random note --
357.864	(Piano notes) --
360.292	you knew instantly what it was,
362.183	and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.
366.421	Now that's called perfect pitch,
368.009	and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes
371.246	in the middle of the piano.
372.396	(Piano notes)
378.424	You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.
381.85	(Applause)
385.398	But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.
388.424	If I just put the microphone down for a bit,
389.851	I'm going to play a cluster of notes.
392.571	Those of you who can see will know how many notes,
394.887	but Derek, of course, can't.
395.896	Not only can you say how many notes,
398.798	it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.
404.222	(Chords)
414.103	Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.
416.921	And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,
421.866	not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,
424.188	Derek, you can hear every note,
426.096	and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,
429.352	reproduce those on the keyboard,
431.31	that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.
435.577	Now then.
438.18	It's no use having that kind of raw ability
441.748	without the technique,
443.509	and luckily, Derek, you decided that,
445.431	once we did start learning, you'd let me help you
448.053	learn all the scale fingerings.
449.692	So for example using your thumb under with C major.
452.639	(Piano notes)
457.752	Etc.
464.161	And in the end, you got so quick,
467.521	"that things like ""Flight of the Bumblebee"""
469.395	were no problem, were they?
470.625	DP: No.
471.903	AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,
474.532	Derek was playing things like this.
476.504	DP: This.
479.586	"(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")"
547.792	(Applause)
549.358	AO: Derek, let's have a bow.
563.408	Well done.
567.48	Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,
571.403	"you could not only play ""Flight of the Bumblebee"""
573.638	in the usual key, but any note I play,
576.304	Derek can play it on.
578.297	So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.
580.765	(Piano notes)
582.58	"Can you play ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" on that note?"
584.184	"DP: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" on that note."
586.488	"(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")"
592.178	AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?
596.251	DP: G minor.
598.522	"(Music: ""Flight of the Bumblebee"")"
603.833	AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
606.117	So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer
609.899	that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,
613.598	all the pieces in the world that are out there.
615.77	Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,
618.197	"""Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'"
620.014	"in B minor instead of A minor?"" as we went on."
623.244	In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,
626.665	you'd learned the version that you'd learned,
628.754	and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,
630.983	so while we were waiting in the two hours
633.461	before the rehearsal and the concert,
635.463	Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly
637.703	and then was able to play it with the orchestra.
640.18	Fantastic chap.
641.64	The other wonderful thing about you is memory.
645.099	DP: Memory.
645.099	AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,
648.935	we ask the audience to participate, of course,
651.765	by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.
655.529	"And people say, ""Well, that's terribly brave"
657.051	"because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"""
659.276	"And I say, ""No, it's not brave at all,"
660.288	because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,
662.94	you're invited to come and sing it first,
664.541	"and then he'll pick it up."" (Laughter)"
667.027	So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.
671.742	But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?
675.459	DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose?
675.459	AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.
679.392	Would you like to hear me play?
682.213	"(Audience: ""Theme of Paganini."")"
683.427	AO: Paganini.
683.427	"DP: ""The Theme of Paganini."""
686.389	(Laughter)
688.227	"(Music: ""Theme of Paganini"")"
783.178	(Applause)
794.409	AO: Well done.
800.223	Derek's going to L.A. soon,
802.897	and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I
806.119	will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,
809.49	which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?
812.117	DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.
815.468	AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,
817.93	but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.
820.448	(Laughter)
822.56	But in America, they've coined this term,
824.434	"""the human iPod"" for Derek,"
826.044	which I think is just missing the point, really,
828.4	because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.
831.477	You're a fantastic, creative musician,
834.264	and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,
837.215	than when we went to Slovenia,
839.412	and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,
844.809	and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.
848.463	"DP: He played ""Chopsticks."""
848.463	"AO: And played ""Chopsticks."""
850.998	"DP: ""Chopsticks."""
852.489	AO: A bit like this.
852.489	DP: Like this. Yes.
855.853	(Piano notes)
856.791	AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.
858.471	He's sitting there.
859.695	"DP: Somebody played ""Chopsticks"" like this."
859.695	AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.
862.973	"(Music: ""Chopsticks"")"
864.229	DP: Let Derek play it.
866.491	AO: What did you do with it, Derek?
868.064	DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.
869.805	AO: This is Derek the musician.
873.372	"(Music: ""Chopsticks"" improvisation)"
929.783	(Applause)
931.86	(Music) (Clapping)
935.636	Keep up with Derek.
937.777	(Music)
992.017	(Applause)
1015.131	The TED people will kill me,
1016.579	but perhaps there's time for one encore.
1018.635	DP: For one encore.
1018.635	AO: One encore, yes.
1022.46	So this is one of Derek's heroes.
1024.515	It's the great Art Tatum --
1024.515	DP: Art Tatum.
1026.687	AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,
1028.713	and also, I think, like Derek,
1029.87	thought that all the world was a piano,
1031.379	so whenever Art Tatum plays something,
1033.339	it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.
1035.974	"And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on ""Tiger Rag."""
1041.798	"DP: ""Tiger Rag."""
1045.534	"(Music: ""Tiger Rag"")"
1155.869	(Applause)
