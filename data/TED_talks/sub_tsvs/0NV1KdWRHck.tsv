15.471	Namaskar.
17.63	I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,
21.408	and I don't use Botox as yet.
23.688	(Laughter)
24.928	So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw
24.928	like a 21-year-old in my movies.
30.288	Yeah, I do that.
31.528	I sell dreams, and I peddle love
31.528	to millions of people back home in India
36.448	who assume that I'm
36.448	the best lover in the world.
38.728	(Laughter)
41.888	If you don't tell anyone,
41.888	I'm going to tell you I'm not,
44.568	but I never let that assumption go away.
46.528	(Laughter)
47.568	I've also been made to understand
49.208	there are lots of you here
49.208	who haven't seen my work,
51.688	and I feel really sad for you.
53.168	(Laughter)
55.608	(Applause)
60.648	That doesn't take away from the fact
60.648	that I'm completely self-obsessed,
64.008	as a movie star should be.
65.288	(Laughter)
66.368	That's when my friends,
66.368	Chris and Juliet called me here
70.008	"to speak about the future ""you."""
71.598	Naturally, it follows I'm going
71.598	to speak about the present me.
74.558	(Laughter)
79.088	Because I truly believe
79.088	that humanity is a lot like me.
81.888	(Laughter)
83.128	It is. It is.
84.528	It's an aging movie star,
87.248	grappling with all
87.248	the newness around itself,
89.848	wondering whether
89.848	it got it right in the first place,
92.528	and still trying to find a way
94.568	to keep on shining regardless.
97.528	I was born in a refugee colony
97.528	in the capital city of India, New Delhi.
101.768	And my father was a freedom fighter.
104.288	My mother was, well,
104.288	just a fighter like mothers are.
109.368	And much like the original homo sapiens,
112.408	we struggled to survive.
114.728	When I was in my early 20s,
116.888	I lost both my parents,
118.648	which I must admit
118.648	seems a bit careless of me now,
122.008	but --
123.328	(Laughter)
128.848	I do remember the night my father died,
130.768	and I remember the driver of a neighbor
130.768	who was driving us to the hospital.
135.688	He mumbled something
135.688	"about ""dead people don't tip so well"""
138.528	and walked away into the dark.
140.808	And I was only 14 then,
142.728	and I put my father's dead body
142.728	in the back seat of the car,
146.208	and my mother besides me,
147.448	I started driving back
147.448	from the hospital to the house.
150.048	And in the middle of her quiet crying,
150.048	my mother looked at me and she said,
153.688	"""Son, when did you learn to drive?"""
157.848	And I thought about it
157.848	and realized, and I said to my mom,
161.128	"""Just now, Mom."""
162.448	(Laughter)
164.728	So from that night onwards,
166.288	much akin to humanity in its adolescence,
169.008	I learned the crude tools of survival.
172.968	And the framework of life was
172.968	very, very simple then, to be honest.
176.648	You know, you just ate what you got
179.648	and did whatever you were told to do.
181.488	I thought celiac was a vegetable,
184.848	and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's
184.848	"lost comrade in ""Star Trek."""
189.408	(Laughter)
190.528	You married the first girl that you dated,
193.528	and you were a techie if you could fix
193.528	the carburetor in your car.
198.928	I really thought that gay was
198.928	a sophisticated English word for happy.
203.648	And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
203.648	of Portugal, as you all know.
206.928	(Laughter)
208.208	Where was I?
212.528	We relied on systems
214.888	created through the toil and sacrifice
214.888	of generations before
218.608	to protect us,
220.088	and we felt that governments
220.088	actually worked for our betterment.
223.768	Science was simple and logical,
225.728	Apple was still then just a fruit
229.128	owned by Eve first and then Newton,
231.088	not by Steve Jobs, until then.
233.448	"And ""Eureka!"" was what you screamed"
235.168	when you wanted
235.168	to run naked on the streets.
238.048	You went wherever life took you for work,
241.688	and people were mostly welcoming of you.
244.408	Migration was a term then
246.408	still reserved for Siberian cranes,
246.408	not human beings.
249.808	Most importantly, you were who you were
252.688	and you said what you thought.
255.208	Then in my late 20s,
256.488	I shifted to the sprawling
256.488	metropolis of Mumbai,
260.248	and my framework,
261.608	like the newly industrialized
261.608	aspirational humanity,
264.928	began to alter.
266.768	In the urban rush for a new,
266.768	more embellished survival,
270.207	things started to look a little different.
272.248	I met people who had descended
272.248	from all over the world,
275.968	faces, races, genders, money-lenders.
279.208	Definitions became more and more fluid.
282.088	Work began to define you at that time
285.208	in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,
287.888	and all the systems
287.888	started to feel less reliable to me,
290.768	almost too thick to hold on
293.928	to the diversity of mankind
295.928	and the human need to progress and grow.
299.328	Ideas were flowing
299.328	with more freedom and speed.
303.208	And I experienced the miracle
303.208	of human innovation and cooperation,
308.568	and my own creativity,
310.008	when supported by the resourcefulness
310.008	of this collective endeavor,
314.528	catapulted me into superstardom.
316.968	I started to feel that I had arrived,
319.408	and generally, by the time I was 40,
319.408	I was really, really flying.
322.928	I was all over the place.
324.208	You know? I'd done 50 films by then
326.248	and 200 songs,
328.608	and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.
330.888	I had been given the highest civil honor
330.888	by the French government,
334.208	the title of which for the life of me
334.208	I can't pronounce even until now.
337.568	(Laughter)
338.648	I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
338.648	France, for doing that.
342.088	But much bigger than that,
342.088	I got to meet Angelina Jolie --
345.448	(Laughter)
348.208	for two and a half seconds.
349.728	(Laughter)
351.048	And I'm sure she also remembers
351.048	that encounter somewhere.
353.768	OK, maybe not.
355.008	And I sat next to Hannah Montana
355.008	on a round dinner table
358.568	with her back towards me most of the time.
361.408	Like I said, I was flying,
361.408	from Miley to Jolie,
364.568	and humanity was soaring with me.
367.848	We were both pretty much
367.848	flying off the handle, actually.
371.088	And then you all know what happened.
373.328	The internet happened.
375.568	I was in my late 40s,
377.528	and I started tweeting
377.528	like a canary in a birdcage
381.088	and assuming that, you know,
381.088	people who peered into my world
384.088	would admire it
385.368	for the miracle I believed it to be.
387.488	But something else
387.488	awaited me and humanity.
390.568	You know, we had expected
390.568	an expansion of ideas and dreams
395.488	with the enhanced
395.488	connectivity of the world.
398.848	We had not bargained
398.848	for the village-like enclosure of thought,
406.528	of judgment, of definition
408.568	that flowed from the same place
410.728	that freedom and revolution
410.728	was taking place in.
414.328	Everything I said took a new meaning.
416.728	Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --
419.648	was there for the world
419.648	to comment upon and judge.
423.008	As a matter of fact,
423.008	everything I didn't say or do also
426.408	met with the same fate.
428.528	Four years ago,
430.768	my lovely wife Gauri and me
430.768	decided to have a third child.
435.808	It was claimed on the net
438.608	that he was the love child
440.728	of our first child
442.528	who was 15 years old.
444.608	Apparently, he had sown
444.608	his wild oats with a girl
447.728	while driving her car in Romania.
450.808	And yeah, there was
450.808	a fake video to go with it.
453.448	And we were so disturbed as a family.
455.288	My son, who is 19 now,
456.568	"even now when you say ""hello"" to him,"
458.408	he just turns around and says,
459.888	"""But bro, I didn't even have"
459.888	"a European driving license."""
462.608	(Laughter)
465.088	Yeah.
466.848	In this new world,
468.568	slowly, reality became virtual
468.568	and virtual became real,
471.968	and I started to feel
473.648	that I could not be who I wanted to be
473.648	or say what I actually thought,
477.208	and humanity at this time
480.128	completely identified with me.
482.088	I think both of us
482.088	were going through our midlife crisis,
486.128	and humanity, like me,
486.128	was becoming an overexposed prima donna.
490.248	I started to sell everything,
491.968	from hair oil to diesel generators.
494.888	Humanity was buying everything
496.928	from crude oil to nuclear reactors.
499.328	You know, I even tried
499.328	to get into a skintight superhero suit
503.328	to reinvent myself.
506.088	I must admit I failed miserably.
508.848	And just an aside I want to say
508.848	on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men
513.888	and Supermen of the world,
516.008	you have to commend them,
517.888	because it really hurts in the crotch,
517.888	that superhero suit.
520.688	(Laughter)
521.768	Yeah, I'm being honest.
521.768	I need to tell you this here.
525.768	Really.
527.008	And accidentally, I happened
527.008	to even invent a new dance form
530.568	which I didn't realize,
530.568	and it became a rage.
532.727	So if it's all right,
533.967	and you've seen a bit of me,
533.967	so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.
537.168	It was called the Lungi dance.
538.648	So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
538.648	I'm talented otherwise.
541.768	(Cheers)
543.008	So it went something like this.
545.688	Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
545.688	Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
548.128	Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
548.128	Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
550.568	Lungi dance. Lungi dance.
550.568	Lungi dance. Lungi.
553.248	That's it. It became a rage.
554.928	(Cheers)
556.248	It really did.
559.768	Like you notice, nobody could make
559.768	any sense of what was happening except me,
563.448	and I didn't give a damn, really,
565.088	because the whole world,
565.088	and whole humanity,
567.328	seemed as confused and lost as I was.
570.368	I didn't give up then.
571.648	I even tried to reconstruct
571.648	my identity on the social media
574.448	like everyone else does.
575.728	I thought if I put on
575.728	philosophical tweets out there
578.488	people will think I'm with it,
580.088	but some of the responses I got
580.088	from those tweets
582.688	were extremely confusing acronyms
582.688	which I didn't understand. You know?
586.048	ROFL, LOL.
588.128	"""Adidas,"" somebody wrote back"
588.128	to one of my more thought-provoking tweets
592.448	and I was wondering
592.448	why would you name a sneaker,
594.808	I mean, why would you write back
594.808	the name of a sneaker to me?
597.728	And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
597.728	and she enlightened me.
600.608	"""Adidas"" now means"
600.608	"""All day I dream about sex."""
604.128	(Laughter)
606.408	Really.
607.728	I didn't know if you know that.
609.248	So I wrote back,
609.248	"""WTF"" in bold to Mr. Adidas,"
613.848	thanking secretly that some acronyms
613.848	and things won't change at all.
619.008	WTF.
622.008	But here we are.
624.208	I am 51 years old, like I told you,
625.928	and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,
629.528	I just want to tell you
630.848	if there has been a momentous time
630.848	for humanity to exist,
634.088	it is now,
635.728	because the present you is brave.
639.128	The present you is hopeful.
640.488	The present you
640.488	is innovative and resourceful,
643.808	and of course, the present you
643.808	is annoyingly indefinable.
648.128	And in this spell-binding,
650.608	imperfect moment of existence,
652.568	feeling a little brave
652.568	just before I came here,
655.168	I decided to take
655.168	a good, hard look at my face.
659.488	And I realized that I'm beginning
659.488	to look more and more
663.168	like the wax statue of me
663.168	at Madame Tussaud's.
665.608	(Laughter)
667.888	Yeah, and in that moment of realization,
670.408	I asked the most central
670.408	and pertinent question to humanity and me:
676.088	Do I need to fix my face?
679.208	Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,
682.568	a modern expression of human creativity.
685.968	The land I come from
687.528	is the source of inexplicable
687.528	but very simple spirituality.
693.688	In its immense generosity,
696.208	India decided somehow
698.968	that I, the Muslim son
698.968	of a broke freedom fighter
702.968	who accidentally ventured
702.968	into the business of selling dreams,
707.728	should become its king of romance,
712.648	"the ""Badhshah of Bollywood,"""
715.688	the greatest lover
715.688	the country has ever seen ...
719.328	with this face.
721.048	Yeah.
722.288	(Laughter)
723.408	Which has alternately
723.408	been described as ugly, unconventional,
726.328	and strangely, not chocolatey enough.
728.168	(Laughter)
733.488	The people of this ancient land
735.848	embraced me in their limitless love,
738.288	and I've learned from these people
740.848	that neither power nor poverty
744.048	can make your life more magical
745.768	or less tortuous.
747.768	I've learned from the people of my country
750.408	that the dignity of a life,
752.528	a human being, a culture,
752.528	a religion, a country
757.168	actually resides in its ability
760.208	for grace and compassion.
762.328	I've learned that whatever moves you,
765.088	whatever urges you to create, to build,
767.808	whatever keeps you from failing,
769.488	whatever helps you survive,
771.768	is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
771.768	emotion known to mankind,
776.168	and that is love.
779.328	A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,
782.248	(Recites poem in Hindi)
792.928	(Poem ends)
794.608	Which loosely translates
794.608	into that whatever --
797.208	yeah, if you know Hindi,
797.208	please clap, yeah.
799.308	(Applause)
800.768	It's very difficult to remember.
803.248	Which loosely translates
803.248	into actually saying
805.848	that all the books of knowledge
805.848	that you might read
808.328	and then go ahead
808.328	and impart your knowledge
811.248	through innovation,
811.248	through creativity, through technology,
814.608	but mankind will never be
814.608	the wiser about its future
817.768	unless it is coupled with a sense of love
817.768	and compassion for their fellow beings.
824.528	The two and a half alphabets
824.528	"which form the word ""प्रेम,"""
828.128	"which means ""love,"""
829.568	if you are able to understand that
831.488	and practice it,
833.088	that itself is enough
833.088	to enlighten mankind.
837.128	"So I truly believe the future ""you"""
839.968	has to be a you that loves.
842.448	Otherwise it will cease to flourish.
845.448	It will perish in its own self-absorption.
850.328	So you may use your power
852.488	to build walls
854.208	and keep people outside,
856.968	or you may use it to break barriers
856.968	and welcome them in.
861.848	You may use your faith
863.648	to make people afraid
866.168	and terrify them into submission,
869.048	or you can use it
869.048	to give courage to people
871.528	so they rise to the greatest
871.528	heights of enlightenment.
875.288	You can use your energy
877.248	to build nuclear bombs
877.248	and spread the darkness of destruction,
880.608	or you can use it to spread
880.608	the joy of light to millions.
885.368	You may filthy up the oceans callously
885.368	and cut down all the forests.
889.408	You can destroy the ecology,
891.848	or turn to them with love
894.048	and regenerate life
894.048	from the waters and trees.
897.288	You may land on Mars
899.088	and build armed citadels,
902.488	or you may look for life-forms and species
902.488	to learn from and respect.
908.248	And you can use
908.248	all the moneys we all have earned
912.008	to wage futile wars
914.928	and give guns in the hands
914.928	of little children
917.848	to kill each other with,
920.288	or you can use it
922.248	to make more food
924.008	to fill their stomachs with.
926.488	My country has taught me
928.168	the capacity for a human being to love
928.168	is akin to godliness.
933.568	It shines forth in a world
938.048	which civilization, I think,
938.048	already has tampered too much with.
944.488	In the last few days,
944.488	the talks here, the wonderful people
947.248	coming and showing their talent,
949.008	talking about individual achievements,
949.008	the innovation, the technology,
952.368	the sciences, the knowledge
952.368	we are gaining by being here
955.728	in the presence of TED Talks
955.728	and all of you
958.528	are reasons enough
958.528	"for us to celebrate the future ""us."""
961.568	But within that celebration
964.208	the quest to cultivate
964.208	our capacity for love and compassion
969.208	has to assert itself,
969.208	has to assert itself,
972.968	just as equally.
975.768	"So I believe the future ""you"""
978.848	is an infinite you.
981.048	It's called a chakra
981.048	in India, like a circle.
984.648	It ends where it begins from
984.648	to complete itself.
988.888	A you that perceives
988.888	time and space differently
992.608	understands both
996.688	your unimaginable
1001.328	and fantastic importance
1003.768	and your complete unimportance
1003.768	in the larger context of the universe.
1010.488	A you that returns back
1012.768	to the original innocence of humanity,
1014.648	which loves from the purity of heart,
1017.568	which sees from the eyes of truth,
1021.128	which dreams from the clarity
1021.128	of an untampered mind.
1028.088	"The future ""you"" has to be"
1030.368	like an aging movie star
1032.888	who has been made to believe
1032.888	that there is a possibility
1035.848	of a world which is completely,
1038.648	wholly, self-obsessively
1041.688	in love with itself.
1043.767	A world -- really, it has to be a you
1047.088	to create a world
1049.047	which is its own best lover.
1051.848	That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,
1053.688	"should be the future ""you."""
1055.247	Thank you very much.
1056.728	Shukriya.
1057.968	(Applause)
1060.128	Thank you.
1061.368	(Applause)
1064.328	Thank you.
