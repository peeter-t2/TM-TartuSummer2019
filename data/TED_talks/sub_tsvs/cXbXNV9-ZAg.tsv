12.618	There's this fact that I love
12.618	that I read somewhere once,
15.476	that one of the things that's contributed
15.476	to homo sapiens' success
20.15	as a species
21.517	is our lack of body hair --
23.597	that our hairlessness, our nakedness
26.045	combined with our invention of clothing,
28.375	gives us the ability to modulate
28.375	our body temperature
31.693	and thus be able to survive
31.693	in any climate we choose.
35.797	And now we've evolved to the point
35.797	where we can't survive without clothing.
39.346	And it's more than just utility,
40.9	now it's a communication.
42.245	Everything that we choose
42.245	to put on is a narrative,
45.077	a story about where we've been,
47.122	what we're doing,
48.738	who we want to be.
51.048	I was a lonely kid.
52.82	I didn't have an easy time
52.82	finding friends to play with,
55.676	and I ended up making
55.676	a lot of my own play.
58.423	I made a lot of my own toys.
60.926	It began with ice cream.
62.589	There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown,
65.737	and they served ice cream
65.737	from behind the counter
68.113	in these giant, five-gallon,
68.113	cardboard tubs.
70.744	And someone told me --
70.744	I was eight years old --
73.03	someone told me that when
73.03	they were done with those tubs,
75.754	they washed them out
75.754	and kept them in the back,
77.992	and if you asked they would give you one.
79.97	It took me a couple of weeks
79.97	to work up the courage,
82.428	but I did, and they did.
83.603	They gave me one -- I went home
83.603	with this beautiful cardboard tub.
86.94	I was trying to figure out what
86.94	I could do with this exotic material --
90.36	metal ring, top and bottom.
91.769	I started turning it over in my head,
91.769	"and I realized, ""Wait a minute --"
95.178	"my head actually fits inside this thing."""
97.344	(Laughter)
98.931	Yeah, I cut a hole out,
100.648	I put some acetate in there
102.191	and I made myself a space helmet.
103.929	(Laughter)
105.106	I needed a place to wear the space helmet,
108.09	so I found a refrigerator box
108.09	a couple blocks from home.
110.818	I pushed it home,
112.129	and in my parents' guest room closet,
114.921	I turned it into a spaceship.
117.336	I started with a control panel
117.336	out of cardboard.
119.659	I cut a hole for a radar screen
121.481	and put a flashlight
121.481	underneath it to light it.
123.728	I put a view screen up,
123.728	which I offset off the back wall --
126.802	and this is where I thought
126.802	I was being really clever --
129.459	without permission, I painted
129.459	the back wall of the closet black
132.53	and put a star field,
133.713	which I lit up with some Christmas lights
133.713	I found in the attic,
138.267	and I went on some space missions.
141.214	A couple years later,
142.389	"the movie ""Jaws"" came out."
143.815	I was way too young to see it,
143.815	"but I was caught up in ""Jaws"" fever,"
147.085	like everyone else in America at the time.
149.709	There was a store in my town
149.709	"that had a ""Jaws"" costume in their window,"
153.185	and my mom must have overheard
153.185	me talking to someone
155.777	about how awesome
155.777	I thought this costume was,
157.921	because a couple days before Halloween,
159.803	she blew my freaking mind
159.803	"by giving me this ""Jaws"" costume."
164.365	Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope
166.789	for people of a certain age to complain
168.686	that kids these days have no idea
168.686	how good they have it,
172.246	but let me just show you a random sampling
174.315	of entry-level kids' costumes
174.315	you can buy online right now ...
178.037	"... and this is the ""Jaws"" costume"
178.037	my mom bought for me.
181.883	(Laughter)
184.639	This is a paper-thin shark face
187.914	and a vinyl bib with the poster
187.914	"of ""Jaws"" on it."
191.476	(Laughter)
192.548	And I loved it.
194.411	A couple years later,
195.826	my dad took me to a film
195.826	"called ""Excalibur."""
198.667	I actually got him to take me to it twice,
200.733	which is no small thing,
200.733	because it is a hard, R-rated film.
205.024	But it wasn't the blood
205.024	and guts or the boobs
207.204	that made me want to go see it again.
209.125	They helped --
210.307	(Laughter)
211.333	It was the armor.
212.522	"The armor in ""Excalibur"""
212.522	was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.
216.66	These were literally knights
216.66	in shining, mirror-polished armor.
221.301	"And moreover, the knights in ""Excalibur"""
221.301	wear their armor everywhere.
225.502	All the time -- they wear it at dinner,
225.502	they wear it to bed.
229.049	(Laughter)
230.124	"I was like, ""Are they reading my mind?"
232.018	"I want to wear armor all the time!"""
234.51	(Laughter)
235.549	So I went back to my favorite material,
237.772	the gateway drug for making,
239.345	corrugated cardboard,
240.789	and I made myself a suit of armor,
243.675	replete with the neck shields
243.675	and a white horse.
247.144	Now that I've oversold it,
248.434	here's a picture of the armor that I made.
250.484	(Laughter)
251.849	(Applause)
256.736	Now, this is only the first
256.736	suit of armor I made
259.351	"inspired by ""Excalibur."""
260.719	A couple of years later,
261.996	I convinced my dad to embark
261.996	on making me a proper suit of armor.
266.118	Over about a month,
267.787	he graduated me from cardboard
267.787	to roofing aluminum called flashing
272.105	and still, one of my all-time favorite
272.105	attachment materials,
274.945	POP rivets.
276.136	We carefully, over that month,
277.872	constructed an articulated suit
277.872	of aluminum armor
280.47	with compound curves.
281.655	We drilled holes in the helmet
281.655	so that I could breathe,
284.584	and I finished just in time
284.584	for Halloween and wore it to school.
287.655	Now, this is the one thing in this talk
289.833	that I don't have a slide to show you,
291.674	because no photo exists of this armor.
293.7	I did wear it to school,
295.087	there was a yearbook photographer
295.087	patrolling the halls,
297.715	but he never found me, for reasons
297.715	that are about to become clear.
301.129	There were things I didn't anticipate
303.231	about wearing a complete suit
303.231	of aluminum armor to school.
308.061	In third period math,
308.061	I was standing in the back of class,
310.846	and I'm standing in the back of class
312.671	because the armor did not
312.671	allow me to sit down.
314.891	(Laughter)
316.37	This is the first thing
316.37	I didn't anticipate.
319.351	And then my teacher looks at me
319.351	sort of concerned
321.89	about halfway through the class
321.89	"and says, ""Are you feeling OK?"""
324.906	"I'm thinking, ""Are you kidding?"
324.906	Am I feeling OK?
327.176	I'm wearing a suit of armor!
327.176	"I am having the time of my --"""
330.068	And I'm just about to tell her
330.068	how great I feel,
332.752	when the classroom
332.752	starts to list to the left
335.169	and disappear down this long tunnel,
337.91	and then I woke up in the nurse's office.
342.275	I had passed out from heat exhaustion,
345.293	wearing the armor.
346.743	And when I woke up,
347.918	I wasn't embarrassed about having
347.918	passed out in front of my class,
351.087	"I was wondering, ""Who took my armor?"
351.087	"Where's my armor?"""
353.71	OK, fast-forward a whole bunch of years,
355.924	some colleagues and I get hired
355.924	to make a show for Discovery Channel,
359.282	"called ""MythBusters."""
360.457	And over 14 years,
361.647	I learn on the job how to build
361.647	experimental methodologies
364.845	and how to tell stories
364.845	about them for television.
367.796	I also learn early on
369.523	that costuming can play a key role
369.523	in this storytelling.
372.406	I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color
376.465	and narrative clarity
376.465	to the stories we're telling.
379.935	And then we do an episode
379.935	"called ""Dumpster Diving,"""
382.718	and I learn a little bit more
385.009	about the deeper implications
385.009	of what costuming means to me.
388.464	"In the episode ""Dumpster Diving,"""
390.084	the question we were trying to answer is:
392.063	Is jumping into a dumpster as safe
393.73	as the movies would lead you to believe?
395.73	(Laughter)
397.528	The episode was going to have
397.528	two distinct parts to it.
400.187	One was where we get trained
400.187	to jump off buildings by a stuntman
403.266	into an air bag.
404.623	And the second was the graduation
404.623	to the experiment:
407.128	we'd fill a dumpster full of material
407.128	and we'd jump into it.
409.997	I wanted to visually separate
409.997	these two elements,
412.308	and I thought,
413.489	"""Well, for the first part we're training,"
413.489	so we should wear sweatsuits --
417.197	Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'
417.197	on the back of the sweatsuits.
420.969	"That's for the training."""
422.337	But for the second part, I wanted
422.337	something really visually striking --
425.726	"""I know! I'll dress as Neo"
425.726	"from 'The Matrix.'"""
428.228	(Laughter)
429.326	So I went to Haight Street.
430.66	I bought some beautiful
430.66	knee-high, buckle boots.
433.263	I found a long, flowing coat on eBay.
435.729	I got sunglasses, which I had to wear
435.729	contact lenses in order to wear.
439.474	The day of the experiment shoot comes up,
441.478	and I step out of my car in this costume,
443.47	and my crew takes a look at me ...
445.99	and start suppressing
445.99	their church giggles.
448.893	They're like,
448.893	"""(Laugh sound)."""
452.011	And I feel two distinct things
452.011	at this moment.
454.466	I feel total embarrassment
456.187	over the fact that
456.187	it's so nakedly clear to my crew
458.957	that I'm completely
458.957	into wearing this costume.
461.623	(Laughter)
463.328	But the producer in my mind reminds myself
466.572	that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,
469.023	that flowing coat is going to look
469.023	beautiful behind me.
472.14	(Laughter)
474.012	"Five years into the ""MythBusters"" run,"
475.907	we got invited to appear
475.907	at San Diego Comic-Con.
478.587	I'd known about Comic-Con for years
478.587	and never had time to go.
482.007	This was the big leagues --
482.007	this was costuming mecca.
485.635	People fly in from all over the world
487.699	to show their amazing creations
487.699	on the floor in San Diego.
490.845	And I wanted to participate.
492.394	I decided that I would put together
492.394	an elaborate costume
495.48	that covered me completely,
496.938	and I would walk the floor
496.938	of San Diego Comic-Con anonymously.
500.581	The costume I chose?
501.923	Hellboy.
503.493	That's not my costume,
504.668	that's actually Hellboy.
505.843	(Laughter)
506.886	But I spent months
508.068	assembling the most screen-accurate
508.068	Hellboy costume I could,
510.932	from the boots to the belt to the pants
512.891	to the right hand of doom.
514.303	I found a guy who made
514.303	a prosthetic Hellboy head and chest
517.718	and I put them on.
519.031	I even had contact lenses made
519.031	in my prescription.
522.786	I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con
525.14	and I can't even tell you
525.14	how balls hot it was in that costume.
529.793	(Laughter)
530.857	Sweating! I should've remembered this.
532.916	I'm sweating buckets
532.916	and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,
535.829	and none of it matters
535.829	because I'm totally in love.
539.402	(Laughter)
541.066	Not just with the process of putting
541.066	on this costume and walking the floor,
544.653	but also with the community
544.653	of other costumers.
548.256	It's not called costuming at Cons,
550.176	"it's called ""cosplay."""
552.026	Now ostensibly, cosplay means
552.026	people who dress up
554.574	as their favorite characters
554.574	from film and television
557.161	and especially anime,
558.369	but it is so much more than that.
561.134	These aren't just people
561.134	who find a costume and put it on --
564.219	they mash them up.
565.64	They bend them to their will.
567.124	They change them to be the characters
567.124	they want to be in those productions.
570.94	They're super clever and genius.
572.88	They let their freak flag fly
572.88	and it's beautiful.
575.567	(Laughter)
576.63	But more than that,
577.805	they rehearse their costumes.
579.282	At Comic-Con or any other Con,
580.782	you don't just take pictures
580.782	of people walking around.
583.353	You go up and say,
584.532	"""Hey, I like your costume,"
584.532	"can I take your picture?"""
587.008	And then you give them time
587.008	to get into their pose.
589.828	They've worked hard on their pose
591.522	to make their costume look
591.522	great for your camera.
594.166	And it's so beautiful to watch.
597.178	And I take this to heart.
598.633	At subsequent Cons,
600.163	I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk
600.163	"as the Joker from ""The Dark Knight."""
604.58	I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith
604.58	"from ""Lord of the Rings,"""
607.654	and I actually frighten some children.
609.739	"I learned that ""hrr hrr hrr"" --"
611.663	that head laugh that Chewbacca does.
614.625	And then I dressed up as
614.625	"No-Face from ""Spirited Away."""
617.623	"If you don't know about ""Spirited Away"""
617.623	and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,
621.098	first of all, you're welcome.
622.573	(Laughter)
624.136	This is a masterpiece,
624.136	and one of my all-time favorite films.
627.6	It's about a young girl named Chihiro
627.6	who gets lost in the spirit world
631.967	in an abandoned Japanese theme park.
634.324	And she finds her way back out again
636.244	with the help of a couple
636.244	of friends she makes --
638.584	a captured dragon named Haku
640.098	and a lonely demon named No-Face.
642.386	No-Face is lonely
642.386	and he wants to make friends,
645.28	and he thinks the way to do it
645.28	is by luring them to him
648.469	and producing gold in his hand.
650.563	But this doesn't go very well,
652.338	and so he ends up going
652.338	on kind of a rampage
655.179	until Chihiro saves him,
657.459	rescues him.
659.081	So I put together a No-Face costume,
662.731	and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.
665.012	And I very carefully practiced
665.012	No-Face's gestures.
669.757	I resolved I would not speak
669.757	in this costume at all.
673.395	When people asked to take my picture,
675.458	I would nod
677.107	and I would shyly stand next to them.
679.552	They would take the picture
681.242	and then I would secret out
681.242	from behind my robe
683.98	a chocolate gold coin.
685.526	And at the end of the photo process,
685.526	I'd make it appear for them.
688.918	Ah, ah ah! -- like that.
691.651	And people were freaking out.
693.058	"""Holy crap! Gold from No-Face!"
693.058	"Oh my god, this is so cool!"""
696.115	And I'm feeling and I'm walking
696.115	the floor and it's fantastic.
700.006	And about 15 minutes in something happens.
703.368	Somebody grabs my hand,
706.014	and they put a coin back into it.
708.116	And I think maybe they're giving me
708.116	a coin as a return gift,
711.336	but no, this is one of the coins
711.336	that I'd given away.
714.229	I don't know why.
715.704	And I keep on going,
715.704	I take some more pictures.
717.976	And then it happens again.
719.939	Understand, I can't see anything
719.939	inside this costume.
723.174	I can see through the mouth --
724.685	I can see people's shoes.
726.328	I can hear what they're saying
726.328	and I can see their feet.
729.167	But the third time someone
729.167	gives me back a coin,
731.461	I want to know what's going on.
733.612	So I sort of tilt my head back
733.612	to get a better view,
736.695	and what I see is someone walking
736.695	away from me going like this.
742.271	And then it hits me:
744.6	it's bad luck to take gold from No-Face.
748.257	"In the film ""Spirited Away,"""
750.193	bad luck befalls those
750.193	who take gold from No-Face.
754.351	This isn't a performer-audience
754.351	relationship; this is cosplay.
761.855	We are, all of us on that floor,
764.092	injecting ourselves into a narrative
764.092	that meant something to us.
767.763	And we're making it our own.
769.632	We're connecting with something
769.632	important inside of us.
774.333	And the costumes
774.333	are how we reveal ourselves
778.116	to each other.
779.984	Thank you.
781.164	(Applause)
