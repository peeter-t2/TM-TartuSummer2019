12.62	"So I've been ""futuring,"""
12.62	which is a term I made up --
16.02	(Laughter)
17.3	about three seconds ago.
18.54	I've been futuring for about 20 years,
21.38	and when I first started,
21.38	I would sit down with people,
24.74	"and say, ""Hey,"
24.74	"let's talk 10, 20 years out."""
27.66	"And they'd say, ""Great."""
29.46	And I've been seeing that time horizon
31.98	get shorter and shorter
34.06	and shorter,
35.7	so much so that I met
35.7	with a CEO two months ago
39.1	and I said -- we started
39.1	our initial conversation.
41.5	"He goes, ""I love what you do."
41.5	"I want to talk about the next six months."""
45.26	(Laughter)
47.86	We have a lot of problems
47.86	that we are facing.
51.02	These are civilizational-scale problems.
55.34	The issue though is,
57.42	we can't solve them
59.14	using the mental models
59.14	that we use right now
61.74	to try and solve these problems.
63.34	Yes, a lot of great
63.34	technical work is being done,
66.02	but there is a problem that
66.02	we need to solve for a priori, before,
71.42	if we want to really
71.42	move the needle on those big problems.
74.98	"""Short-termism."""
76.74	Right? There's no marches.
76.74	There's no bracelets.
79.22	There's no petitions that you can sign
79.22	to be against short-termism.
83.1	I tried to put one up, and no one signed.
85.94	It was weird.
87.18	(Laughter)
89.1	But it prevents us from doing so much.
92.14	Short-termism, for many reasons,
94.86	has pervaded every
94.86	nook and cranny of our reality.
97.78	I just want you to take a second
99.38	and just think about an issue
99.38	that you're thinking, working on.
103.22	It could be personal, it could be at work
105.22	or it could be
105.22	move-the-needle world stuff,
107.3	and think about
107.3	how far out you tend to think
109.66	about the solution set for that.
113.74	Because short-termism prevents the CEO
118.18	from buying really
118.18	expensive safety equipment.
121.74	It'll hurt the bottom line.
123.74	So we get the Deepwater Horizon.
126.22	Short-termism prevents teachers
128.98	from spending quality
128.98	one-on-one time with their students.
132.54	So right now in America,
134.7	a high school student
134.7	drops out every 26 seconds.
139.18	Short-termism prevents Congress --
141.94	sorry if there's anyone
141.94	in here from Congress --
144.58	(Laughter)
146.14	or not really that sorry --
148.22	(Laughter)
150.46	from putting money
150.46	into a real infrastructure bill.
153.66	So what we get
153.66	is the I-35W bridge collapse
156.3	over the Mississippi a few years ago,
160.58	It wasn't always like this.
160.58	We did the Panama Canal.
164.42	We pretty much
164.42	have eradicated global polio.
166.7	We did the transcontinental railroad,
166.7	the Marshall Plan.
170.38	And it's not just big, physical
170.38	infrastructure problems and issues.
174.74	Women's suffrage, the right to vote.
176.66	But in our short-termist time,
179.46	where everything seems to happen right now
181.98	and we can only think out
181.98	past the next tweet or timeline post,
186.5	we get hyper-reactionary.
188.54	So what do we do?
190.7	We take people who are fleeing
190.7	their war-torn country,
193.98	and we go after them.
195.26	We take low-level drug offenders,
195.26	and we put them away for life.
198.9	And then we build McMansions
198.9	without even thinking
201.3	about how people are going
201.3	to get between them and their job.
204.19	It's a quick buck.
206.58	Now, the reality is,
206.58	for a lot of these problems,
208.94	there are some technical fixes,
211.74	a lot of them.
212.98	I call these technical fixes
212.98	sandbag strategies.
216.54	So you know there's a storm coming,
218.26	the levee is broken,
218.26	no one's put any money into it,
221.02	you surround your home with sandbags.
222.86	And guess what? It works.
226.42	Storm goes away,
226.42	the water level goes down,
228.46	you get rid of the sandbags,
229.86	and you do this storm
229.86	after storm after storm.
233.74	And here's the insidious thing.
235.94	A sandbag strategy
237.86	can get you reelected.
240.14	A sandbag strategy
241.54	can help you make your quarterly numbers.
246.06	Now, if we want to move forward
249.06	into a different future
249.06	than the one we have right now,
251.86	because I don't think we've hit --
255.94	(Laughter)
257.3	There's some more we can do.
259.1	But my argument is that unless we shift
259.1	our mental models and our mental maps
263.74	on how we think about the short,
266.1	it's not going to happen.
267.82	So what I've developed
267.82	"is something called ""longpath,"""
270.82	and it's a practice.
272.58	And longpath isn't
272.58	a kind of one-and-done exercise.
276.54	I'm sure everyone here
276.54	at some point has done an off-site
279.26	with a lot of Post-It notes
279.26	and whiteboards,
281.38	and you do --
284.3	no offense to the consultants
284.3	in here who do that --
286.78	and you do a long-term plan,
288.42	and then two weeks later,
288.42	everyone forgets about it.
292.46	Right? Or a week later.
292.46	If you're lucky, three months.
296.66	It's a practice because
296.66	it's not necessarily a thing that you do.
300.26	It's a process where you have
300.26	to revisit different ways of thinking
304.06	for every major decision
304.06	that you're working on.
306.5	So I want to go through
306.5	those three ways of thinking.
309.78	So the first: transgenerational thinking.
313.18	I love the philosophers:
315.42	Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.
317.26	I was raised on them.
319.86	But they all did one thing
321.82	that didn't actually seem like a big deal
323.82	until I really started
323.82	kind of looking into this.
326.18	And they all took,
328.02	as a unit of measure
328.02	for their entire reality
330.94	of what it meant to be virtuous and good,
333.7	the single lifespan,
335.78	from birth to death.
337.46	But here's a problem with these issues:
339.54	they stack up on top of us,
340.98	because the only way we know
340.98	how to do something good in the world
344.14	is if we do it between
344.14	our birth and our death.
346.38	That's what we're programmed to do.
348.1	If you go to the self-help section
348.1	in any bookstore,
350.58	it's all about you.
353.22	Which is great,
355.1	unless you're dealing
355.1	with some of these major issues.
359.78	And so with transgenerational thinking,
363.1	which is really kind of
363.1	transgenerational ethics,
365.78	you're able to expand
365.78	how you think about these problems,
369.42	what is your role
369.42	in helping to solve them.
373.54	Now, this isn't something that just has to
373.54	be done at the Security Council chamber.
378.3	It's something that you can do
378.3	in a very kind of personal way.
381.58	So every once in a while, if I'm lucky,
381.58	my wife and I like to go out to dinner,
386.02	and we have three children
386.02	under the age of seven.
389.3	So you can imagine
389.3	it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.
391.753	(Laughter)
392.98	So we sit down and literally
392.98	all I want to do is just eat and chill,
398.58	and my kids have a completely
398.58	and totally different idea
401.26	of what we're going to be doing.
402.86	And so my first idea
405.22	is my sandbag strategy, right?
407.14	It's to go into my pocket
407.14	and take out the iPhone
409.5	"and give them ""Frozen"""
410.98	or some other bestselling game thing.
415.06	And then I stop
418.78	and I have to kind of put on
418.78	this transgenerational thinking cap.
423.38	I don't do this in the restaurant,
423.38	because it would be bizarre,
426.38	but I have to --
427.7	I did it once, and that's how
427.7	I learned it was bizarre.
430.34	(Laughter)
431.38	And you have to kind of think,
431.38	"""OK, I can do this."""
436.26	But what is this teaching them?
439.3	So what does it mean
439.3	if I actually bring some paper
441.94	or engage with them in conversation?
443.7	It's hard. It's not easy,
443.7	and I'm making this very personal.
446.58	It's actually more traumatic
447.98	than some of the big issues
447.98	that I work on in the world --
450.74	entertaining my kids at dinner.
453.38	But what it does is it connects them
453.38	here in the present with me,
456.54	but it also --
457.82	and this is the crux
457.82	of transgenerational thinking ethics --
461.3	it sets them up to how they're
461.3	going to interact with their kids
464.62	and their kids and their kids.
468.18	Second, futures thinking.
470.5	When we think about the future,
474.74	give me a vision of what the future is.
477.82	You don't have to give it to me,
477.82	but think in your head.
480.5	And what you're probably going to see
482.66	is the dominant cultural lens
484.5	that dominates our thinking
484.5	about the future right now:
487.58	technology.
489.66	So when we think about the problems,
491.42	we always put it through
491.42	a technological lens,
493.62	a tech-centric, a techno-utopia,
493.62	and there's nothing wrong with that,
496.9	but it's something that we have to
496.9	really think deeply about
500.22	if we're going to move
500.22	on these major issues,
503.1	because it wasn't always like this. Right?
505.18	The ancients had their way of thinking
508.66	about what the future was.
511.46	The Church definitely had their idea
511.46	of what the future could be,
516.38	and you could actually pay your way
516.38	into that future. Right?
519.34	And luckily for humanity,
521.3	we got the scientific revolution.
523.46	From there, we got the technology,
525.14	but what has happened --
526.82	And by the way, this is not a critique.
530.14	I love technology.
532.54	Everything in my house talks back to me,
534.499	from my children
534.499	to my speakers to everything.
536.7	(Laughter)
539.54	But we've abdicated the future
539.54	from the high priests in Rome
545.26	to the high priests of Silicon Valley.
549.7	So when we think, well,
549.7	how are we going to deal with climate
553.06	or with poverty or homelessness,
554.66	our first reaction is to think about it
554.66	through a technology lens.
558.9	And look, I'm not advocating
558.9	that we go to this guy.
563.54	I love Joel, don't get me wrong,
566.22	but I'm not saying we go to Joel.
567.9	What I'm saying is we have to rethink
569.74	our base assumption about
569.74	only looking at the future in one way,
574.54	only looking at it
574.54	through the dominant lens.
576.7	Because our problems
576.7	are so big and so vast
578.9	that we need to open ourselves up.
581.74	So that's why I do everything in my power
581.74	not to talk about the future.
586.14	I talk about futures.
588.74	It opens the conversation again.
590.5	So when you're sitting and thinking
592.98	about how do we move forward
592.98	on this major issue --
596.18	it could be at home,
597.74	it could be at work,
599.74	it could be again on the global stage --
602.62	don't cut yourself off from thinking
602.62	about something beyond technology as a fix
607.06	because we're more concerned
607.06	about technological evolution right now
610.62	than we are about moral evolution.
612.78	And unless we fix for that,
614.82	we're not going to be able
614.82	to get out of short-termism
617.42	and get to where we want to be.
619.26	The final, telos thinking.
619.26	This comes from the Greek root.
622.5	Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.
624.78	And it's really asking one question:
627.94	to what end?
630.1	When was the last time
630.1	you asked yourself: To what end?
633.14	And when you asked yourself that,
633.14	how far out did you go?
637.46	Because long isn't long enough anymore.
641.38	Three, five years doesn't cut it.
643.3	It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.
646.62	"In Homer's epic, ""The Odyssey,"""
648.86	"Odysseus had the answer to his ""what end."""
651.94	It was Ithaca.
653.7	It was this bold vision
653.7	of what he wanted --
655.82	to return to Penelope.
657.22	And I can tell you,
657.22	because of the work that I'm doing,
659.86	but also you know it intuitively --
659.86	we have lost our Ithaca.
662.74	"We have lost our ""to what end,"""
662.74	so we stay on this hamster wheel.
666.3	And yes, we're trying
666.3	to solve these problems,
668.5	but what comes after we solve the problem?
671.98	And unless you define what comes after,
671.98	people aren't going to move.
676.22	The businesses --
676.22	this isn't just about business --
678.66	but the businesses that do consistently,
678.66	who break out of short-termism
682.02	not surprisingly
682.02	are family-run businesses.
684.06	They're transgenerational. They're telos.
684.06	They think about the futures.
687.66	And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.
687.66	They're 175 years old,
691.38	and what's amazing
691.38	is that they literally embody
694.46	this kind of longpathian sense
694.46	in their brand,
697.3	because, by the way,
697.3	you never actually own a Patek Philippe,
700.22	and I definitely won't --
701.82	(Laughter)
702.86	unless somebody wants to just
702.86	throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.
705.884	You merely look after it
705.884	for the next generation.
710.66	So it's important that we remember,
713.14	the future, we treat it like a noun.
716.3	It's not. It's a verb.
718.58	It requires action.
719.86	It requires us to push into it.
721.7	It's not this thing that washes over us.
723.66	It's something that we
723.66	actually have total control over.
726.34	But in a short-term society,
726.34	we end up feeling like we don't.
729.26	We feel like we're trapped.
730.62	We can push through that.
733.82	Now I'm getting more comfortable
737.02	in the fact that at some point
740.18	in the inevitable future,
742.82	I will die.
745.06	But because of these new ways
745.06	of thinking and doing,
749.18	both in the outside world
749.18	and also with my family at home,
753.14	and what I'm leaving my kids,
753.14	I get more comfortable in that fact.
756.3	And it's something that a lot of us
756.3	are really uncomfortable with,
759.46	but I'm telling you,
761.66	think it through.
763.1	Apply this type of thinking
763.1	and you can push yourself past
765.86	what's inevitably
765.86	very, very uncomfortable.
767.94	And it all begins really
767.94	with yourself asking this question:
772.66	What is your longpath?
775.7	But I ask you, when you ask yourself that
778.62	now or tonight or behind a steering wheel
780.9	or in the boardroom or the situation room:
786.14	push past the longpath,
788.34	quick, oh, what's my longpath
788.34	the next three years or five years?
791.66	Try and push past your own life if you can
795.3	because it makes you do things
795.3	a little bit bigger
797.7	than you thought were possible.
800.62	Yes, we have huge,
800.62	huge problems out there.
805.62	With this process, with this thinking,
808.94	I think we can make a difference.
811.06	I think you can make a difference,
813.62	and I believe in you guys.
815.26	Thank you.
816.5	(Applause)
