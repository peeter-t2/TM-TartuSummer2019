12.88	"""Mom, who are these people?"""
15.48	It was an innocent question
15.48	from my young daughter Alia
18.12	around the time when she was three.
20.28	We were walking along with my husband
22.4	in one of Abu Dhabi's big fancy malls.
25.2	Alia was peering at a huge poster
25.2	standing tall in the middle of the mall.
29.52	It featured the three rulers
29.52	of the United Arab Emirates.
33.76	As she tucked in my side,
35.24	I bent down and explained
35.24	that these were the rulers of the UAE
38.48	who had worked hard
38.48	to develop their nation
40.76	and preserve its unity.
43.04	"She asked, ""Mom, why is it"
43.04	that here where we live,
46.92	and back in Lebanon,
46.92	where grandma and grandpa live,
49.6	we never see the pictures
49.6	of powerful women on the walls?
52.76	"Is it because women are not important?"""
56.04	This is probably the hardest question
56.04	I've had to answer in my years as a parent
59.88	and in my 16-plus years
59.88	of professional life, for that matter.
64.12	I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,
67.12	the younger of two daughters
67.12	to a very hard-working pilot
70.6	and director of operations
70.6	for the Lebanese Airlines
74.24	and a super-supportive
74.24	stay-at-home mom and grandma.
77.96	My father had encouraged
77.96	my sister and I to pursue our education
82.08	even though our culture
82.08	emphasized at the time
85.4	that it was sons and not daughters
85.4	who should be professionally motivated.
90.84	I was one of very few girls
90.84	of my generation
93.04	who left home at 18 to study abroad.
96.48	My father didn't have a son,
98.32	and so I, in a sense, became his.
102.88	Fast-forward a couple of decades,
102.88	and I hope I didn't do too badly
106.6	in making my father proud
106.6	of his would-be son.
110.68	As I got my Bachelor's and PhD
110.68	in electrical engineering,
113.84	did R&amp;D in the UK,
113.84	then consulting in the Middle East,
117.36	I have always been
117.36	in male-dominated environments.
120.72	Truth be told, I have never found
120.72	a role model I could truly identify with.
126.24	My mother's generation
126.24	wasn't into professional leadership.
129.88	There were some
129.88	encouraging men along the way,
132.08	but none knew the demands
132.08	and pressures I was facing,
136	pressures that got particularly acute
136	when I had my own two beautiful children.
141.759	And although Western women love to give us
141.759	poor, oppressed Arab women advice,
147.16	they live different lives
147.16	with different constraints.
151.12	So Arab women of my generation
151.12	have had to become our own role models.
155.24	We have had to juggle more than Arab men,
157.52	and we have had to face
157.52	more cultural rigidity than Western women.
161.72	As a result, I would like to think
161.72	that we poor, oppressed women
165.84	actually have some useful,
165.84	certainly hard-earned lessons to share,
170	lessons that might turn out useful
172.04	for anyone wishing to thrive
172.04	in the modern world.
175.44	Here are three of mine.
176.76	"[""Convert their sh*t into your fuel.""]"
178.64	(Laughter)
179.88	(Applause)
186.28	There is this word that everybody
186.28	is touting as the key to success:
190.68	resilience.
192.52	Well, what exactly is resilience,
192.52	and how do you develop it?
196.64	I believe resilience is simply
196.64	the ability to transform shit into fuel.
203.64	In my previous job,
203.64	well before my current firm,
206.48	I was working with a man
206.48	we will call John.
209.4	I had teamed up with John
209.4	and was working hard,
211.84	hoping he would notice how great I was
213.84	and that he would come to support
213.84	my case to make partner at the firm.
218.04	I was, in addition to delivering
218.04	on my consulting projects,
221.24	writing passionately on the topic
221.24	of women economic empowerment.
225.88	One day, I got to present my research
225.88	to a roomful of MBA students.
230.56	John was part of the audience
232.16	listening for the first time
232.16	to the details of my study.
236	As I proceeded with my presentation,
238.32	I could see John in the corner of my eye.
241	He had turned a dark shade of pink
243.56	and had slid under his chair
243.56	in apparent shame.
247.84	I finished my presentation
247.84	to an applauding audience
250.32	and we rushed out and jumped into the car.
253.48	There he exploded.
256.04	"""What you did up there was unacceptable!"
258.24	"You are a consultant, not an activist!"""
261.6	"I said, ""John, I don't understand."
264.08	I presented a couple of
264.08	gender parity indices,
267.76	and some conclusions about the Arab world.
269.839	Yes, we do happen to be today
269.839	at the bottom of the index,
272.839	but what is it that I said or presented
272.839	"that was not factual?"""
277.04	To which he replied,
277.04	"""The whole premise of your study is wrong."
281.12	What you are doing is dangerous and will
281.12	"break the social fabric of our society."""
285.72	He paused, then added,
288.12	"""When women have children,"
288.12	"their place is in the home."""
293.36	Time stood still for a long while,
295.64	and all I could think and repeat
295.64	in the chaos of my brain was:
299.36	"""You can forget about"
299.36	that partnership, Leila.
301.56	"It's just never going to happen."""
304.68	It took me a couple of days to fully
304.68	absorb this incident and its implications,
308.6	but once I did,
308.6	I reached three conclusions.
312.16	One, that these were his issues,
314.72	his complexes.
316.24	There may be many like him in our society,
318.32	but I would never let
318.32	their issues become mine.
321.4	Two, that I needed
321.4	another sponsor, and fast.
324.36	(Laughter)
325.6	I got one, by the way,
325.6	and boy, was he great.
327.84	And three, that I would get to show John
327.84	what women with children can do.
332.28	I apply this lesson equally well
332.28	to my personal life.
335.72	As I have progressed in my career,
337.52	I have received many words
337.52	of encouragement,
340	but I have also often been met
340	by women, men and couples
344.32	who have clearly had an issue
344.32	with my husband and I
347.08	having chosen the path
347.08	of a dual-career couple.
350.6	So you get this well-meaning couple
352.72	who tells you straight out
352.72	at a family gathering
355	or at a friends gathering,
356.28	that, come on, you must know
356.28	you're not a great mom,
358.733	given how much you're investing
358.733	in your career, right?
362.72	I would lie if I said
362.72	these words didn't hurt.
365.44	My children are the most
365.44	precious thing to me,
367.92	and the thought that I could be
367.92	failing them in any way is intolerable.
372.48	But just like I did with John,
374.04	I quickly reminded myself
374.04	that these were their issues,
377.68	their complexes.
379.52	So instead of replying,
380.84	I gave back one of my largest smiles
383.16	as I saw, in flashing light,
385.04	the following sign in my mind's eye.
387.2	[Be happy, it drives people crazy.]
389.28	(Applause)
394.76	You see, as a young woman
394.76	in these situations, you have two options.
398.12	You can either decide
398.12	to internalize these negative messages
401	that are being thrown at you,
402.64	to let them make you feel like a failure,
404.64	like success is way too hard
404.64	to ever achieve,
407.24	or you can choose to see that others'
407.24	negativity is their own issue,
410.68	and instead transform it
410.68	into your own personal fuel.
414.88	I have learned
414.88	to always go for option two,
418.08	and I have found that it has taken me
418.08	from strength to strength.
421.8	And it's true what they say:
423.28	success is the best revenge.
426.96	Some women in the Middle East
428.4	are lucky enough to be married
428.4	to someone supportive of their career.
431.84	"Correction: I should say ""smart enough,"""
434.32	because who you marry is your own choice,
436.72	and you'd better marry someone supportive
436.72	if you plan to have a long career.
441.24	Still today, the Arab man
441.24	is not an equal contributor in the home.
445.56	It's simply not expected by our society,
447.8	and even frowned upon as not very manly.
451.36	As for the Arab woman,
451.36	our society still assumes
454.08	that her primary source of happiness
454.08	should be the happiness and prosperity
457.84	of her children and husband.
459.8	She mostly exists for her family.
463.16	Things are changing,
463.16	but it will take time.
465.76	For now, it means
465.76	that the professional Arab woman
468.28	has to somehow maintain the perfect home,
471.64	make sure that her children's every need
471.64	is being taken care of
474.76	and manage her demanding career.
477.76	To achieve this, I have found the hard way
481.12	that you need to apply your hard-earned
481.12	professional skills to your personal life.
485.92	You need to work your life.
488	Here is how I do this in my personal life.
492.998	One thing to know about the Middle East
494.88	is that nearly every family
494.88	has access to affordable domestic help.
499.32	The challenge therefore becomes
499.32	how to recruit effectively.
503.16	Just like I would in my business life,
503.16	I have based the selection
506.48	of who would support me
506.48	with my children while I'm at work
509.56	on a strong referral.
511.28	Cristina had worked
511.28	for four years with my sister
514.24	and the quality of her work
514.24	was well-established.
517.88	She is now an integral
517.88	member of our family,
520.16	having been with us
520.16	since Alia was six months old.
523.4	She makes sure that the house
523.4	is running smoothly while I'm at work,
526.919	and I make sure to empower her
529.159	in the most optimal conditions
529.159	for her and my children,
532.36	just like I would my best talent at work.
535.559	This lesson applies
535.559	whatever your childcare situation,
539.16	whether an au pair, nursery,
541.6	part-time nanny
541.6	that you share with someone else.
543.96	Choose very carefully, and empower.
548.04	If you look at my calendar,
549.4	you will see every working day
551.4	one and a half hours
551.4	from 7pm to 8:30pm UAE time
555.12	"blocked and called ""family time."""
557.8	This is sacred time.
559.36	I have done this
559.36	ever since Alia was a baby.
563.04	I do everything in my power
563.04	to protect this time
565.48	so that I can be home by then
565.48	to spend quality time with my children,
568.92	asking them about their day,
571.36	checking up on homework,
571.36	reading them a bedtime story
574.28	and giving them
574.28	lots of kisses and cuddles.
576.88	If I'm traveling,
576.88	in whatever the time zone,
579.4	I use Skype to connect with my children
579.4	even if I am miles away.
584.2	Our son Burhan is five years old,
586.28	and he's learning to read
586.28	and do basic maths.
589.92	Here's another confession:
591.52	I have found that our daughter
591.52	is actually more successful
594.28	at teaching him these skills than I am.
596.2	(Laughter)
598.8	It started as a game, but Alia loves
598.8	playing teacher to her little brother,
602.88	and I have found that these sessions
602.88	actually improve Burhan's literacy,
608.08	increase Alia's sense of responsibility,
610.48	and strengthen the bonding between them,
612.48	a win-win all around.
615.52	The successful Arab women I know
617.76	have each found their unique approach
617.76	to working their life
620.92	as they continue to shoulder
622.32	the lion's share
622.32	of responsibility in the home.
625.04	But this is not just
625.04	about surviving in your dual role
627.68	as a career woman and mother.
629.4	This is also about being in the present.
633	When I am with my children,
634.88	I try to leave work out of our lives.
637.32	Instead of worrying about how many minutes
637.32	I can spend with them every day,
641.36	I focus on turning these minutes
641.36	into memorable moments,
645.16	moments where I'm seeing my kids,
647.4	hearing them, connecting with them.
649.24	"[""Join forces, don't compete.""]"
651.04	Arab women of my generation
651.04	have not been very visible
653.84	in the public eye as they grew up.
655.96	This explains, I think, to some extent,
657.88	why you find so few women
657.88	in politics in the Arab world.
661.32	The upside of this, however,
662.84	is that we have spent a lot of time
664.96	developing a social skill
664.96	behind the scenes,
669.04	in coffee shops, in living rooms,
670.84	on the phone,
672.08	a social skill that is
672.08	very important to success:
674.88	networking.
676.56	I would say the average Arab woman
678.24	has a large network
678.24	of friends and acquaintances.
680.8	The majority of those are also women.
684.4	In the West, it seems like ambitious women
684.4	often compare themselves to other women
688.4	hoping to be noticed as the most
688.4	successful woman in the room.
692.36	This leads to the much-spoken-about
692.36	competitive behavior
695.16	between professional women.
697.56	If there's only room
697.56	for one woman at the top,
699.76	then you can't make room for others,
699.76	much less lift them up.
703.76	Arab women, generally speaking,
705.28	have not fallen
705.28	for this psychological trap.
708.28	Faced with a patriarchal society,
710.24	they have found
710.24	that by helping each other out,
712.6	all benefit.
715.12	In my previous job, I was the most
715.12	senior woman in the Middle East,
718.32	so one could think that investing
718.32	in my network of female colleagues
722.2	couldn't bring many benefits
723.8	and that I should instead invest my time
726.08	developing my relationships
726.08	with male seniors and peers.
729.76	Yet two of my biggest breaks
729.76	came through the support of other women.
734.2	It was the head of marketing
734.2	who initially suggested
736.68	I be considered as a young global leader
736.68	to the World Economic Forum.
740	She was familiar with my media engagements
740	and my publications,
743	and when she was asked
743	to voice her opinion,
745.12	she highlighted my name.
747.28	It was a young consultant,
747.28	a Saudi lady and friend,
749.96	who helped me sell
749.96	my first project in Saudi Arabia,
752.72	a market I was finding hard
752.72	to gain traction in as a woman.
756.84	She introduced me to a client,
758.36	and that introduction led to the first
758.36	of very many projects for me in Saudi.
762.52	Today, I have two senior women on my team,
765	and I see making them successful
765	as key to my own success.
770.32	Women continue to advance in the world,
772.32	not fast enough, but we're moving.
774.72	The Arab world, too, is making progress,
774.72	despite many recent setbacks.
778.84	Just this year, the UAE appointed
778.84	five new female ministers to its cabinet,
783.48	for a total of eight female ministers.
786.36	That's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,
789.08	and more than many
789.08	developed countries can claim.
791.92	This is today my daughter
791.92	Alia's favorite picture.
795.36	This is the result,
795.36	no doubt, of great leadership,
797.88	but it is also the result
797.88	of strong Arab women
800.52	not giving up and continuously
800.52	pushing the boundaries.
803.52	It is the result of Arab women
803.52	deciding every day like me
807.68	to convert shit into fuel,
809.48	to work their life
809.48	to keep work out of their life,
812.04	and to join forces and not compete.
814.96	As I look to the future,
816.4	my hopes for my daughter
816.4	when she stands on this stage
818.96	some 20, 30 years from now
820.8	are that she be as proud
820.8	to call herself her mother's daughter
823.92	as her father's daughter.
826.04	My hopes for my son
827.52	are that by then, the expression
827.52	"""her mother's son"" or ""mama's boy"""
831.16	would have taken on
831.16	a completely different meaning.
834.12	Thank you.
835.36	(Applause)
