13.606	As you heard, I'm a physicist.
15.329	And I think the way we talk about physics
15.329	needs a little modification.
19.338	I am from just down the road here;
19.338	I don't live here anymore.
22.723	But coming from round here means
22.723	that I have a northern nana,
27.254	my mum's mom.
28.445	And Nana is very bright;
28.445	she hasn't had much formal education,
32.496	but she's sharp.
33.688	And when I was a second-year undergraduate
33.688	studying physics at Cambridge,
37.79	I remember spending an afternoon
37.79	at Nana's house in Urmston
42.657	studying quantum mechanics.
44.063	And I had these folders
44.063	open in front of me
46.378	with this, you know,
46.378	hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.
49.3	And Nana came along,
49.3	and she looked at this folder,
54.028	"and she said, ""What's that?"""
56.357	"I said, ""It's quantum mechanics, Nana."""
59.023	And I tried to explain something
59.023	about what was on the page.
63.853	It was to do with the nucleus
63.853	and Einstein A and B coefficients.
67.866	And Nana looked very impressed.
70.413	"And then she said, ""Oh."
72.873	"What can you do when you know that?"""
74.897	(Laughter)
79.315	"""Don't know, ma'am."""
80.568	(Laughter)
81.656	I think I said something about computers,
83.68	because it was all
83.68	I could think of at the time.
86.782	But you can broaden that question out,
86.782	because it's a very good question --
90.45	"""What can you do when you know that?"""
90.45	"when ""that"" is physics?"
93.376	And I've come to realize that when
93.376	we talk about physics in society
96.868	and our sort of image of it,
98.294	we don't include the things
98.294	that we can do when we know that.
101.47	Our perception of what physics is
101.47	needs a bit of a shift.
104.207	Not only does it need a bit of a shift,
106.135	but sharing this different perspective
106.135	matters for our society,
111.715	and I'm not just saying that
111.715	because I'm a physicist and I'm biased
114.947	and I think we're the most
114.947	important people in the world.
117.738	Honest.
118.913	So, the image of physics -- we've got
118.913	an image problem, let's be honest --
122.579	it hasn't moved on much from this.
124.417	This is a very famous photograph
124.417	that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.
128.573	This is when the great minds
128.573	of physics were grappling
132.842	with the nature of determinism
135.112	and what it means
135.112	only to have a probability
137.216	that a particle might be somewhere,
138.951	and whether any of it was real.
140.557	And it was all very difficult.
142.048	And you'll notice they're all
142.048	very stern-looking men in suits.
145.035	Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying,
145.035	"""Marie Antoinette,"""
147.969	which would be a turn-up for the books --
149.957	Marie Curie, third from the left
149.957	on the bottom there,
152.577	she was allowed in,
152.577	but had to dress like everybody else.
155.316	(Laughter)
156.365	So, this is what physics is like --
156.365	there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,
160.279	these are to do with waves and particles.
162.476	That is an artist's impression
162.476	of two black holes colliding,
165.68	which makes it look
165.68	worth watching, to be honest.
167.992	I'm glad I didn't have to write
167.992	the risk assessment
170.408	for whatever was going on there.
171.964	The point is: this is
171.964	the image of physics, right?
174.341	It's weird and difficult,
175.564	done by slightly strange people
175.564	dressed in a slightly strange way.
178.712	It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else
180.737	and fundamentally, why should I care?
183.07	And the problem with that
183.07	is that I'm a physicist,
187.363	and I study this.
188.86	This -- this is my job, right?
191.17	I study the interface
191.17	between the atmosphere and the ocean.
194.894	The atmosphere is massive,
194.894	the ocean is massive,
197.206	and the thin layer
197.206	that joins them together
199.331	is really important,
200.517	because that's where things go
200.517	from one huge reservoir to the other.
203.758	You can see that the sea surface --
203.758	that was me who took this video --
207.496	the average height of those waves
207.496	by the way, was 10 meters.
210.655	So this is definitely physics
210.655	happening here --
213.174	there's lots of things --
213.174	this is definitely physics.
215.746	And yet it's not included
215.746	in our cultural perception of physics,
219.32	and that bothers me.
221.17	So what is included
221.17	in our cultural perception of physics?
224.522	Because I'm a physicist,
224.522	there has to be a graph, right?
227.356	That's allowed.
228.536	We've got time along the bottom here,
228.536	from very fast things there,
232.821	to things that take a long time over here.
236.286	Small things at the bottom,
236.286	big things up there.
238.805	So, our current cultural image
238.805	of physics looks like this.
241.854	There's quantum mechanics
241.854	down in that corner,
244.399	it's very small, it's very weird,
246.423	it happens very quickly,
248.448	and it's a long way down
248.448	in the general ...
251.753	on the scale of anything that matters
251.753	for everyday life.
254.611	And then there's cosmology,
254.611	which is up there;
256.967	very large, very far away,
258.302	also very weird.
260.326	And if you go to some places
262.35	like black holes
262.35	in the beginning of the universe,
265.438	we know that these are frontiers
265.438	in physics, right?
268.464	There's lots of work being done
268.464	to discover new physics
271.243	in these places.
273.137	But the thing is, you will notice
273.137	there's a very large gap in the middle.
276.678	And in that gap, there are many things.
278.86	There are planets and toasts
278.86	and volcanoes and clouds
281.527	and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins
283.688	and all sorts of things
283.688	that make up our everyday life.
286.971	And these are also run by physics,
286.971	you'd be surprised --
290.108	there is physics in the middle,
290.108	it's just that nobody talks about it.
293.431	And the thing about all of these
293.431	is that they all run
297.426	on a relatively small number
297.426	of physical laws,
300.981	things like Newton's laws of motion,
302.883	thermodynamics,
304.07	some rotational dynamics.
305.809	The physics in the middle
305.809	applies over a huge range,
309.361	from very, very small things
309.361	to very, very big things.
312.006	You have to try very hard
312.006	to get outside of this.
314.404	And there is also a frontier
314.404	in research physics here,
318.229	it's just that nobody talks about it.
320.056	This is the world of the complex.
321.757	When these laws work together,
321.757	they bring about
324.028	the beautiful, messy,
324.028	complex world we live in.
326.882	Fundamentally, this is the bit
326.882	that really matters to me
330.579	on an everyday basis.
331.793	And this is the bit
331.793	that we don't talk about.
333.996	There's plenty of physics
333.996	research going on here.
336.354	But because it doesn't involve
336.354	pointing at stars,
338.752	people for some reason
338.752	think it's not that.
340.858	Now, the cool thing about this
340.858	is that there are so many things
344.364	in this middle bit,
346.388	all following the same physical laws,
349.246	that we can see those laws at work
351.595	almost all the time around us.
353.619	I've got a little video here.
355.058	So the game is, one of these eggs is raw
355.058	and one of them has been boiled.
359.045	I want you to tell me which one is which.
362.553	Which one's raw?
364.359	(Audience responds)
365.529	The one on the left -- yes!
367.027	And even though you might not
367.027	have tried that, you all knew.
369.891	The reason for that is,
369.891	you set them spinning,
372.465	and when you stop the cooked egg,
372.465	the one that's completely solid,
375.672	you stop the entire egg.
376.848	When you stop the other one,
376.848	you only stop the shell;
379.435	the liquid inside is still rotating
379.435	because nothing's made it stop.
382.805	And then it pushes the shell round again,
382.805	so the egg starts to rotate again.
387.111	This is brilliant, right?
389.177	It's a demonstration
389.177	of something in physics
391.466	that we call the law of conservation
391.466	of angular momentum,
394.836	which basically says
394.836	that if you set something spinning
397.582	about a fixed axis,
398.761	that it will keep spinning
398.761	unless you do something to stop it.
401.88	And that's really fundamental
401.88	in how the universe works.
405.084	And it's not just eggs that it applies to,
407.708	although it's really useful
407.708	if you're the sort of person --
410.544	and apparently, these people do exist --
412.511	who will boil eggs
412.511	and then put them back in the fridge.
415.322	Who does that? Don't admit to it --
415.322	it's OK. We won't judge you.
418.451	But it's also got much
418.451	broader applicabilities.
421.544	This is the Hubble Space Telescope.
423.54	The Hubble Ultra Deep Field,
423.54	which is a very tiny part of the sky.
426.756	Hubble has been floating
426.756	in free space for 25 years,
429.901	not touching anything.
431.493	And yet it can point
431.493	to a tiny region of sky.
434.223	For 11 and a half days,
434.223	it did it in sections,
438.549	accurately enough
438.549	to take amazing images like this.
441.227	So the question is:
442.41	How does something
442.41	that is not touching anything
444.848	know where it is?
446.033	The answer is that right in the middle
446.033	of it, it has something
449.018	that, to my great disappointment,
449.018	isn't a raw egg,
451.413	but basically does the same job.
452.976	It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,
454.879	and because of the law
454.879	of conservation of angular momentum,
457.707	they keep spinning
457.707	with the same axis, indefinitely.
460.305	Hubble kind of rotates around them,
460.305	and so it can orient itself.
463.418	So the same little physical law
463.418	we can play with in the kitchen and use,
467.586	also explains what makes possible
467.586	some of the most advanced technology
472.163	of our time.
473.938	So this is the fun bit of physics,
473.938	that you learn these patterns
477.569	and then you can apply them
477.569	again and again and again.
480.154	And it's really rewarding
480.154	when you spot them in new places.
483.054	This is the fun of physics.
484.571	I have shown that egg video
484.571	to an audience full of businesspeople once
489.049	and they were all dressed up very smartly
489.049	and trying to impress their bosses.
493.723	And I was running out of time,
493.723	so I showed the egg video and then said,
497.526	"""Well, you can work it out,"
497.526	"and ask me afterwards to check."""
500.41	Then I left the stage.
501.591	And I had, literally,
502.768	middle-aged grown men
502.768	tugging on my sleeve afterwards,
505.369	"saying, ""Is it this? Is it this?"""
507.029	"And when I said, ""Yes."" They went, ""Yes!"""
509.057	(Laughter)
510.101	The joy that you get
510.101	from spotting these patterns
512.583	doesn't go away when you're an adult.
514.724	And that's really important,
516.503	because physics is all about patterns,
519.006	and a small number of patterns
519.006	give you access
521.676	to almost all of the physics
521.676	in our everyday world.
525.167	The thing that's best about this
525.167	is it involves playing with toys.
528.762	Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed
528.762	as the mundane little things
532.277	that we just give the kids to play with
532.277	on a Saturday afternoon
535.387	to keep them quiet.
536.576	This is the stuff
536.576	that actually really matters,
538.856	because this is the laws of the universe
538.856	and it applies to eggs
541.904	and toast falling butter-side down
541.904	and all sorts of other things,
545.207	just as much as it applies
545.207	to modern technology
547.665	and anything else
547.665	that's going on in the world.
549.902	So I think we should play
549.902	with these patterns.
553.64	Basically, there are a small
553.64	number of concepts
555.879	that you can become familiar with
555.879	using things in your kitchen,
558.908	that are really useful
558.908	for life in the outside world.
561.697	If you want to learn about thermodynamics,
561.697	a duck is a good place to start,
565.278	for example, why their feet
565.278	don't get cold.
567.354	Once you've got a bit
567.354	of thermodynamics with the duck,
569.929	you can also explain fridges.
571.372	Magnets that you can play with
571.372	in your kitchen
574.157	get you to wind turbines
574.157	and modern energy generation.
578.221	Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always
578.221	a good thing to play with.
581.289	If you're at a boring party,
581.289	fish some raisins out of the bar snacks,
584.592	put them in some lemonade.
586.616	It's got three consequences.
588.227	First thing is, it's quite good
588.227	to watch; try it.
590.618	Secondly, it sends the boring people away.
593.157	Thirdly, it brings
593.157	the interesting people to you.
595.544	You win on all fronts.
596.931	And then there's spin
596.931	and gas laws and viscosity.
600.302	There's these little patterns,
600.302	and they're right around us everywhere.
603.818	And it's fundamentally democratic, right?
607.403	Everybody has access to the same physics;
607.403	you don't need a big, posh lab.
611.079	When I wrote the book,
611.079	I had the chapter on spin.
615.057	I had written a bit
615.057	about toast falling butter-side down.
617.763	I gave the chapter to a friend of mine
617.763	who's not a scientist,
620.859	for him to read and tell me
620.859	what he thought,
622.997	and he took the chapter away.
626.099	He was working overseas.
627.332	I got this text message back from him
627.332	a couple of weeks later,
630.333	"and it said, ""I'm at breakfast"
630.333	in a posh hotel in Switzerland,
634.566	and I really want
634.566	to push toast off the table,
637.322	"because I don't believe what you wrote."""
639.888	And that was the good bit --
639.888	he doesn't have to.
642.227	He can push the toast off the table
642.227	and try it for himself.
645.707	And so there's two important things
645.707	to know about science:
649.568	the fundamental laws we've learned
649.568	through experience and experimentation,
653.906	work.
655.084	The day we drop an apple and it goes up,
657.09	then we'll have a debate about gravity.
659.03	Up to that point,
659.03	we basically know how gravity works,
661.644	and we can learn the framework.
663.202	Then there's the process
663.202	of experimentation:
665.513	having confidence in things,
665.513	trying things out,
667.74	critical thinking -- how we move
667.74	science forward --
670.233	and you can learn both of those things
672.257	by playing with toys
672.257	in the everyday world.
675.376	And it's really important,
677.547	because there's all this talk
677.547	about technology,
679.786	we've heard talks about quantum computing
681.811	and all these mysterious, far-off things.
683.836	But fundamentally, we still live in bodies
683.836	that are about this size,
687.694	we still walk about,
687.694	sit on chairs that are about this size,
690.655	we still live in the physical world.
692.679	And being familiar with these concepts
692.679	means we're not helpless.
696.651	And I think it's really important
696.651	that we're not helpless,
699.526	that society feels it can look at things,
701.758	because this isn't
701.758	about knowing all the answers.
704.448	It's about having the framework
704.448	so you can ask the right questions.
707.889	And by playing with these fundamental
707.889	little things in everyday life,
711.427	we gain the confidence
711.427	to ask the right questions.
714.186	So, there's a bigger thing.
715.896	In answer to Nana's question
717.294	about what can you do
717.294	when you know that --
719.328	because there's lots of stuff
719.328	in the everyday world
721.805	that you can do when you know that,
723.526	especially if you've got
723.526	eggs in the fridge --
726.004	there's a much deeper answer.
728.35	And so there's all the fun
728.35	and the curiosity
730.538	that you could have playing with toys.
732.524	By the way -- why should kids have
732.524	all the fun, right?
736.096	All of us can have fun playing with toys,
738.12	and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
740.144	You can blame me, it's fine.
742.046	So when it comes to reasons
742.046	for studying physics, for example,
747.479	here is the best reason I can think of:
750.394	I think that each of us has
750.394	three life-support systems.
754.25	We've got our own body, we've got a planet
756.631	and we've got our civilization.
758.422	Each of those is an independent
758.422	life-support system,
761.485	keeping us alive in its own way.
763.509	And they all run
763.509	on the fundamental physical laws
766.7	that you can learn in the kitchen
766.7	with eggs and teacups and lemonade,
770.124	and everything else you can play with.
772.027	This is the reason, for example,
773.652	why something like climate change
773.652	is such a serious problem,
776.581	because It's two of these
776.581	life-support systems,
779.137	our planet and our civilization,
780.929	kind of butting up against each other;
782.908	they're in conflict,
782.908	and we need to negotiate that boundary.
785.824	And the fundamental physical laws
785.824	that we can learn
788.364	that are the way
788.364	the world around us works,
790.568	are the tools at the basis of everything;
793.012	they're the foundation.
794.398	There's lots of things
794.398	to know about in life,
796.593	but knowing the foundations
796.593	is going to get you a long way.
799.413	And I think this, if you're not interested
799.413	in having fun with physics
803.078	or anything like that -- strange,
803.078	but apparently, these people exist --
807.153	you surely are interested
807.153	in keeping yourself alive
811.264	and in how our life-support systems work.
813.339	The framework for physics
813.339	is remarkably constant;
818.138	it's the same in lots and lots
818.138	of things that we measure.
820.838	It's not going to change anytime soon.
822.7	They might discover
822.7	some new quantum mechanics,
824.987	but apples right here
824.987	are still going to fall down.
827.667	So, the question is --
829.814	I get asked sometimes: How do you start?
832.127	What's the place to start
833.372	if you're interested in the physical
833.372	world, in not being helpless,
836.652	and in finding some toys to play with?
838.513	Here is my suggestion to you:
840.941	the place to start is that moment --
840.941	and adults do this --
846.364	you're drifting along somewhere,
848.25	and you spot something
848.25	"and your brain goes, ""Oh, that's weird."""
851.865	And then your consciousness goes,
851.865	"""You're an adult. Keep going."""
855.513	And that's the point --
855.513	hold that thought --
858.376	that bit where your brain went,
858.376	"""Oh, that's a bit odd,"""
861.028	because there's something
861.028	there to play with,
863.105	and it's worth you playing with it,
864.847	so that's the place to start.
866.267	But if you don't have
866.267	any of those little moments
868.657	on your way home from this event,
870.277	here are some things to start with.
871.986	Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade;
871.986	highly entertaining.
874.172	Watch a coffee spill dry.
876.196	I know that sounds a little bit
876.196	like watching paint dry,
878.824	but it does do quite weird things;
878.824	it's worth watching.
882.313	I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties
882.313	if there are teacups around.
886.532	There are so many things you can do
886.532	to play with teacups, it's brilliant.
889.996	The most obvious one
889.996	is to get a teacup, get a spoon,
893.429	tap the teacup around the rim and listen,
895.771	and you will hear something strange.
897.59	And the other thing is,
897.59	push your toast off the table
900.914	because you can,
900.914	and you'll learn stuff from it.
903.347	And if you're feeling really ambitious,
905.323	try and push it off in such a way
905.323	that it doesn't fall butter-side down,
909.474	which is possible.
911.054	The point of all of this is that,
913.78	first of all, we should all
913.78	play with toys.
915.897	We shouldn't be afraid to investigate
915.897	the physical world for ourselves
919.345	with the tools around us,
920.619	because we all have access to them.
922.423	It matters, because if we want
922.423	to understand society,
925.066	if we want to be good citizens,
926.649	we need to understand the framework
926.649	on which everything else must be based.
931.267	Playing with toys is great.
932.794	Understanding how to keep
932.794	our life-support systems going is great.
935.931	But fundamentally, the thing
935.931	that we need to change
938.348	in the way that we talk about physics,
940.2	is we need to understand
941.383	that physics isn't out there
941.383	with weird people
943.723	and strange hieroglyphics
945.227	for somebody else in a posh lab.
946.873	Physics is right here; it's for us,
946.873	and we can all play with it.
949.947	Thank you very much.
