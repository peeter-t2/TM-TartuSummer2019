12.907	You know, it's a big privilege for me
15.335	to be working in one of the
15.335	biodiversity hotspots in the world:
19.227	the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean.
21.928	These islands — Mauritius,
21.928	Rodrigues, and Réunion —
25.673	along with the island of Madagascar,
28.811	they are blessed with unique plants
30.727	found nowhere else in the world.
32.84	And today I will tell you 
32.84	about five of them
35.529	and their particular features
37.524	and why these plants are so unique.
40.408	Take a look at this plant.
41.968	I call it benjoin in the local vernacular,
45.372	and the botanical name 
45.372	is Terminalia bentzoe,
49.298	subspecies bentzoe.
51.199	This subspecies is endemic to Mauritius,
54.507	and its particular feature
56.318	is its heterophylly.
58.792	What do I mean by heterophylly?
60.918	It's that the same plant
62.481	has got leaves that are different shapes and sizes.
65.564	Now, these plants have evolved
67.149	very far away from the mainland,
69.503	and within specific ecosystems.
72.901	Often, these particular features
75.725	have evolved as a response to the threat
78.536	presented by the local fauna,
80.973	in this case, grazing tortoises.
84.593	Tortoises are known to have poor eyesight,
87.749	and as such, they tend to avoid the plants
90.235	they don't recognize.
92.294	So this evolutionary 
92.294	foil safeguards the plant
95.668	against these rather cute animals,
98.593	and protects it and of course 
98.593	ensures its survival.
103.651	Now the question you're 
103.651	probably asking yourself is,
106.661	why is she telling us all these stories?
109.562	The reason for that is that we tend to overlook
113.248	the diversity and the variety of the natural world.
117.632	These particular habitats are unique
120.525	and they are host to a whole lot of plants.
124.753	We don't realize how valuable
126.924	and how precious these resources are,
129.534	and yet, through our insouciance,
131.729	we keep on destroying them.
133.898	We're all familiar
135.63	with the macro impact of urbanization,
138.825	climate change, resource exploitation,
142.267	but when that one last plant —
144.44	or animal for that matter —
146.649	when that very last specimen
148.848	has disappeared from the face of this Earth,
150.959	we would have lost
152.355	an entire subset of the Earth's biology,
156.261	and with it, important plants 
156.261	with medicinal potential
159.939	or which could have ingredients
161.874	that would speak to the cosmetic,
163.395	nutrition, pharma,
165.316	and even the ethno-veterinary sectors,
167.735	be gone forever.
169.478	And here we have a very prime example
171.413	of the iconic dodo, which comes from Mauritius,
174.158	and, of course, we know is 
174.158	now a symbol of extinction.
178.545	We know plants have a 
178.545	fundamental role to play.
181.165	Well, first of all, they feed us
183	and they also give us 
183	the oxygen we breathe,
185.89	but plants are also the source
188.207	of important, biologically active ingredients
191.762	that we should be studying very carefully,
194.964	because human societies over the millennia,
199.254	they have developed important knowledge,
202.302	cultural traditions,
204.12	and important plant-based medicinal resources.
208.416	Here's a data point:
210.401	1.4 percent of the entire land surface
214.563	is home to 40 percent of
214.563	the species of higher plants,
221.155	and this 1.4 percent
223.698	represents the 25 biodiversity hotspots in the world,
228.366	and this 1.4 percent of the entire land surface
231.524	already provides for 35 percent
234.406	of the ecosystem services
236.24	that vulnerable people depend on.
238.918	And as you can see,
240.266	the island of Mauritius
241.679	where I work and where I live,
243.762	belongs to one such biodiversity hotspot,
246.467	and I study the unique plants
248.681	on the island for their 
248.681	biomedical applications.
252.343	Now, let's go back again
253.68	to that first plant I showed you,
255.52	the one, of course, with 
255.52	different-shaped leaves
258.547	and different sizes, Terminalia bentzoe,
261.403	subspecies bentzoe,
263.07	a plant only found in Mauritius.
265.665	Now, the local people,
267.11	they used a decoction of the leaves
269.336	against infectious diseases.
271.867	Now our work, that is,
274.319	the scientific validation of 
274.319	this traditional information,
277.728	has shown that precisely
279.8	that leaf extract shows activity, potent activity,
284.129	against a wide range of bacteria
286.351	that could be pathogenic to humans.
289.427	Now, could this plant be the answer
291.868	to antibiotic resistance?
294.489	You know, antibiotic resistance is proving to be
296.84	a big challenge globally.
299.56	While we may not be sure, one thing is certain:
302.363	we will not want this plant to disappear.
304.972	But the harsh reality is that
307.616	this particular plant is in fact
309.6	considered to be vulnerable
311.47	in its natural habitat.
313.63	This brings me to another example.
315.778	This bush here is known as baume de l'ile plate
319.568	in the local vernacular.
321.29	The botanical name is Psiadia arguta.
323.945	It's a plant which is rare,
325.836	which is endemic to Mauritius.
328.548	It used to grow on the mainland,
329.77	but through the sheer 
329.77	pressures of urbanization
332.213	has been pushed out of the mainland,
334.492	and we've managed to bring it back
336.193	from the brink of extinction
337.669	by developing in vitro plants
339.736	which are now growing in the wild.
341.584	Now, one thing I must 
341.584	point out straightaway
343.78	is that not all plants
346.657	can be developed in vitro.
349.573	While we humans, we are 
349.573	happy in our comfort zone,
353.396	these plants also need
355.632	their ecosystem to be preserved,
358.366	and they don't react — endemic plants
360.199	don't react to very harsh 
360.199	changes in their ecosystem,
363.518	and yet we know what are the challenges
365.779	that climate change, for example,
366.867	is posing to these plants.
368.91	Now, the local people again use the leaves
371.438	in traditional medicine
373.192	against respiratory problems.
375.872	Now, our preliminary labwork
377.961	on the leaf extract has shown
379.693	that precisely these 
379.693	leaves contain ingredients
383.822	that are very close, 
383.822	in terms of structures,
386.917	chemical structures, to those medicines
389.283	which are sold in the chemist's shop
390.802	against asthma.
392.777	So who knows
394.687	what humanity will benefit from
396.773	should this plant decide 
396.773	to reveal all its secrets.
402.191	Now, I come from the developing world
404.682	where we are forever being 
404.682	challenged with this issue
407.485	of population explosion.
409.879	Africa is the continent 
409.879	which is getting younger,
412.693	and whenever one talks 
412.693	about population explosion,
416.396	one talks about the issue of food security
418.901	as being the other side of the same coin.
421.581	Now this plant here, the baobab,
423.899	could be part of the answer.
425.421	It's an underutilized, neglected food plant.
428.566	It defines the landscape of West Africa,
431.059	where it is known as the tree of life,
433.605	and later on I will tell you why
436.103	the Africans consider it to be the tree of life.
439.214	Now interestingly, there are many legends
441.132	which are associated with this plant.
443.24	Because of its sheer size,
445.012	it was meant to be lording over lesser plants,
447.914	so God didn't like this arrogance,
449.872	uprooted it, and planted it upside down,
452.66	hence its particular shape.
455.182	And if you look at this tree again
457.69	within the African context,
459.852	in West Africa, it's known 
459.852	as the palaver tree,
463.517	because it performs great social functions.
466.587	Now if you have a problem in the community,
468.806	meeting under the palaver tree
470.544	with the chiefs or the tribesmen
472.523	would be synonymous to trying to find a solution
474.685	to that particular problem,
476.13	and also to reinforce trust and respect
479.07	among members of the community.
481.591	From the scientific point of view,
483.987	there are eight species of baobab in the world.
486.682	There's one from Africa,
488.664	one from Australia,
490.333	and six are endemic
493.08	to the island of Madagascar.
494.727	The one I have showed you
496.359	is the one from Africa,
497.949	Adansonia digitata.
499.87	Now, the flower, this 
499.87	beautiful white flower,
502.19	it opens at night, is pollinated by bats,
504.314	and it gives rise to the fruit
506.913	which is curiously known
508.465	as the monkey apple.
510.2	The monkeys are not stupid animals.
511.693	They know what's good for them.
513.426	Now, if you open the fruit of the baobab,
516.227	you'll see a white, floury pulp,
518.82	which is very rich in nutrients
520.917	and has got protein,
523.291	more protein than in human milk.
527.409	Yes, you heard right:
529.197	more protein than in human milk.
532.605	And this is one of the reasons why
534.495	the nutrition companies of this world,
536.317	they are looking for this fruit to provide
538.702	what we know as reinforced food.
541.289	The seeds give an oil, a very stable oil
545.17	which is sought after 
545.17	by the cosmetic industry
548.24	to give to produce body lotions, for example.
551.502	And if you look at the trunk,
553.131	the trunk, of course, safeguards water,
556.734	which is often harvested by a thirsty traveler,
559.535	and the leaves are used in traditional medicine
561.213	against infectious disease.
563.168	Now, you can see now why the Africans consider it
565.744	to be the tree of life.
567.544	It's a complete plant,
569.209	and in fact, the sheer size of these trees
571.751	is hiding a massive potential,
573.854	not only for the pharma, nutrition,
573.854	and the cosmetic industry.
577.296	What I have showed you here
579.302	is only the species from Africa,
581.532	Adansonia digitata.
583.416	We have six species yet in Madagascar,
586.08	and we don't know what 
586.08	is the potential of this plant,
589.564	but one thing we know is that the flora
592.03	is considered to be 
592.03	threatened with extinction.
594.592	Let me take you to Africa again,
597.796	and introduce you to one of my very favorite,
600.3	the resurrection plant.
602.13	Now here you'll find
603.477	that even Jesus has competition.
605.395	(Laughter)
606.998	Now, this plant here has developed
609.991	remarkable tolerance to drought,
612.97	which enables it to withstand
615.068	up to 98 percent dehydration 
615.068	over the period of a year
619.313	without damage,
621.417	and yet it can regenerate 
621.417	itself almost completely
625.567	overnight, over 24 hours, and flower.
629.647	Now, us human beings,
631.88	we're always on the lookout for the elixir of youth.
635.106	We don't want to get old, and rightly so.
636.94	Why should we, especially if you can afford it?
640.179	And this gives you an indication
642.362	of what the plant looks like before.
645.164	Now, if you are an inexperienced gardener,
648.02	the first thing you'll do 
648.02	when you visit the garden
650.052	is to uproot this plant because it's dead.
652.776	But if you water it, this is what you get.
657.578	Absolutely amazing.
659.754	Now, if you look at our aging process,
662.25	the aging process is in fact the loss of water
664.7	from the upper epidermis, resulting in wrinkling
667.874	as we know it, especially women,
669.441	we are so conscious of this.
671.282	And this plant, in fact, is giving 
671.282	the cosmetic chemists
675.963	very important ingredients
677.953	that are actually finding ways
680.72	to slow down the aging process
683.11	and at the same time reinforce the cells
685.49	against the onslaught of environmental toxins.
689.777	Now, these four examples
692.414	I have just given you
695.321	are just a very tiny reminder
698.755	as to how our health
702.492	and our survival are closely linked
705.996	to the health and the resilience
708.808	of our ecosystem,
710.653	and why we should be very careful
712.587	about preserving biodiversity.
715.288	Every time a forest is cut down,
718.49	every time a marsh is filled in,
722.11	it is a potential lab that goes with it,
725.86	and which we will never, ever recover.
728.168	And I know what I'm talking about,
729.735	coming from Mauritius and missing the dodo.
733.067	Let me finish with just one last example.
737.425	Conservation issues are normally guided
741.24	towards rare, endemic plants,
744.208	but what we call exotic plants,
746.75	that is, the ones which grow in many
746.75	different habitats across the world,
750.227	they also need to be considered.
752.633	You know why? Because the environment plays
755.772	a very important role
757.527	in modifying the composition of that plant.
760.186	So let's take a look at this plant here,
762.817	Centella asiatica. It's a weed.
765.3	We call it a weed.
767.448	Now, Centella asiatica 
767.448	grows across the world
770.324	in many different habitats — 
770.324	in Africa, in Asia —
773.106	and this plant has been instrumental
775.125	in providing a solution 
775.125	to that dreadful disease
777.892	called leprosy in Madagascar in the 1940s.
782.338	Now, while Centella 
782.338	grows across the world —
785.868	in Africa, in Asia — 
785.868	the best quality Centella
789.159	comes from Madagascar,
791.503	because that Centella contains
791.503	the three vital ingredients
795.688	which are sought after by the pharma
797.914	and the cosmetic companies.
800.548	And the cosmetic companies 
800.548	are already using it
802.797	to make regenerating cream.
805.879	Now, there is an ancient saying
808.668	that for every disease known to mankind,
812.212	there is a plant to cure it.
814.394	Now, you may not 
814.394	believe in ancient sayings.
816.622	You may think they're obsolete
818.185	now that our science and 
818.185	technology are so powerful.
821.133	So you may look on Centella as being
823.169	an insignificant, humble weed,
826.374	which, if destroyed, won't be missed.
829.7	But you know, there is no such thing as a weed.
832.135	It's a plant.
833.889	It's a living biological lab
836.768	that may well have answers
838.669	to the question that we may have,
840.627	but we have to ensure
842.517	that it has the right to live.
845.25	Thank you.
847.128	(Applause)
