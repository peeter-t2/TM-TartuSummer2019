12.935	Today I am going to teach you
15.049	how to play my favorite game:
18.809	massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
22.292	It's the only game in the world that I know of
25.612	that allows you, the player,
27.679	the opportunity to experience
34.486	This is true, so if you play this game with me today
36.998	for just one single minute,
39.001	you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,
42.701	pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,
45.767	contentment, and creativity,
47.365	all in the span of one minute.
48.904	So this sounds pretty good, right?
48.904	Now you're willing to play.
51.236	In order to teach you this game,
52.799	I'm going to need some volunteers
54.172	to come up onstage really quickly,
56.075	and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.
57.553	While they're coming up, I should let you know,
59.594	this game was invented 10 years ago
62.056	by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.
65.353	So thank you, Monochrom.
67.098	Okay, so most people are familiar
69.141	with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.
71.133	Sunni, let's just remind them.
72.721	One, two, three, four, 
72.721	I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,
75.507	and of course Sunni beats me
75.507	because she's the best.
77.607	Now the first thing about
77.607	massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
81.411	we're the gamer generation.
82.822	There are a billion gamers on the planet now,
85.173	so we need more of a challenge.
86.727	So the first thing we need is more thumbs.
90.106	So Eric, come on over.
91.8	So we could get three thumbs together,
94.611	and Peter could join us.
97.069	We could even have four thumbs together,
98.789	and the way you win
100.316	is you're the first person
100.316	to pin someone else's thumb.
103.513	This is really important. You can't, like,
105.371	wait while they fight it out and
105.371	then swoop in at the last minute.
107.908	That is not how you win.
109.403	Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.
110.738	So Eric would have won. He was
110.738	the first person to pin my thumb.
113.54	Okay, so that's the first rule,
114.95	and we can see that three or four
116.809	is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,
119.988	but if you feel ambitious,
119.988	you don't have to hold back.
122.63	We can really go for it.
123.995	So you can see up here.
126.161	Now the only other rule you need to remember is,
129.133	gamer generation, we like a challenge.
131.4	I happen to notice you all have
133.047	some thumbs you're not using.
134.883	So I think we should kind of get some more involved.
137.89	And if we had just four people,
139.66	we would do it just like this,
141.498	and we would try and wrestle
143.184	both thumbs at the same time.
144.965	Perfect.
146.272	Now, if we had more people in the room,
148.386	instead of just wrestling in a closed node,
150.265	we might reach out and try
150.265	and grab some other people.
153.048	And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.
154.769	We're going to try and get all, something like,
157.321	I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room
160.297	connected in a single node.
161.61	And we have to connect both levels,
164.65	so if you're up there, you're going to be
167.096	reaching down and reaching up.
169.309	Now — (Laughter) —
170.983	before we get started --
172.875	This is great. You're excited to play. —
175.908	before we get started, can I have
175.908	the slides back up here really quick,
178.988	because if you get good at this game,
180.945	I want you to know there are some advanced levels.
183.581	So this is the kind of simple level, right?
186.493	But there are advanced configurations.
188.405	This is called the Death Star Configuration.
190.415	Any Star Wars fans?
192.122	And this one's called the Möbius Strip.
194.47	Any science geeks, you get that one.
196.29	This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.
199.194	So we'll stick with the normal one for now,
201.208	and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,
203.15	every thumb into the node,
205.175	connect the upper and the lower levels,
206.648	you guys go on down there.
208.15	Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.
213.178	Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.
215.932	Everybody, up up up up up!
219.871	Stand up, my friends.
223.161	All right.
224.193	Don't start wrestling yet.
227.001	If you have a free thumb, wave it around,
229.781	make sure it gets connected.
233.002	Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.
235.694	If you have a free thumb,
235.694	wave it around to make sure.
239.027	Grab that thumb!
240.52	Reach behind you. There you go.
241.863	Any other thumbs?
243.421	Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.
245.936	Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.
248.649	Okay? One, two, three, go!
251.179	(Laughter)
258.52	Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!
261.532	(Applause)
264.049	Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.
267.591	All right.
268.996	While you are basking in the glow
272.408	of having won your first
274.21	massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,
275.825	let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.
278.415	So curiosity.
280.354	"I said ""massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."""
282.326	"You were like, ""What the hell is she talking about?"""
284.126	So I provoked a little curiosity.
286.003	Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem
288.672	of getting all the thumbs into the node.
290.031	I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.
291.444	So you used creativity. That was great.
292.998	How about surprise? The actual feeling
295.25	of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once
295.25	is pretty surprising.
297.912	You heard that sound go up in the room.
299.772	We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,
301.611	maybe you're starting to win
301.611	or this person's, like, really into it,
303.816	so you kind of get the excitement going.
306.302	We have relief. You got to stand up.
308.245	You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,
310.003	getting to shake it out.
311.32	We had joy. You were laughing, smiling.
311.32	Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.
315.88	We had some contentment.
317.84	I didn't see anybody sending text messages
317.84	or checking their email while we were playing,
321.529	so you were totally content to be playing.
323.522	The most important three emotions,
325.21	awe and wonder, we had everybody
325.21	connected physically for a minute.
328.822	When was the last time you were at TED
330.421	and you got to connect physically
330.421	with every single person in the room?
333.25	And it's truly awesome and wondrous.
334.896	And speaking of physical connection,
336.74	you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,
339.743	you release oxytocin, you feel bonded
339.743	to everyone in the room.
342.92	You guys know that the best way
342.92	to release oxytocin quickly
345.436	is to hold someone else's hand
345.436	for at least six seconds.
347.935	You guys were all holding hands
347.935	for way more than six seconds,
350.487	so we are all now biochemically primed
352.267	to love each other. That is great.
354.12	And the last emotion of pride.
357.044	How many people are like me. Just admit it.
359.848	You lost both your thumbs.
360.994	It just didn't work out for you.
362.943	That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.
365.506	You learned, from scratch,
365.506	a game you never knew before.
368.27	Now you know how to play it.
368.27	You can teach other people.
369.976	So congratulations.
371.544	How many of you won just won thumb?
373.865	All right. I have very good news for you.
375.236	According to the official rules
376.368	of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,
378.364	this makes you a grandmaster of the game.
382.145	Because there aren't that many
382.145	people who know how to play,
384.377	we have to kind of accelerate the program
386.576	more than a game like chess.
388.169	So congratulations, grandmasters.
389.962	Win one thumb once, you will
389.962	become a grandmaster.
392.453	Did anybody win both their thumbs?
394.482	Yes. Awesome. Okay.
395.981	Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.
398.904	You guys, according to the rules,
400.67	are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.
404.346	I will just leave you with this tip,
404.346	if you want to play again.
407.075	The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,
408.863	you've got your two nodes going on.
410.949	Pick off the one that looks easiest.
412.671	They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.
414.652	Focus on that one and do something crazy
416.736	with this arm.
418.072	As soon as you win, suddenly stop.
420.401	Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.
422.201	That's how you become a legendary grandmaster
422.201	of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
424.767	Thank you for letting me
424.767	teach you my favorite game.
427.294	Wooo! (Applause)
429.13	Thank you. (Applause)
