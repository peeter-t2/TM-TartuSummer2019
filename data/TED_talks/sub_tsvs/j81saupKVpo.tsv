12.747	I'd like to start my performance by saying
18.923	(Laughter)
20.149	It's called Sturgeon's law,
20.149	and what that means
22.426	is that the majority of anything
22.426	is always bad.
29.447	I have a giraffe here.
31.226	I'm going to throw the giraffe
31.226	behind my back
33.51	and whoever catches it is going
33.51	to help me on this next thing.
38.474	Sir, you caught the giraffe.
41.655	I have a playing card in my hand.
44.806	Freely name any card in the deck.
49.577	Audience member: 10 of hearts.
51.229	Helder Guimar√£es: 10 of hearts.
52.916	You could have named any card in the deck,
55.019	but you said the 10 of hearts.
57.901	Ninety percent of everything is crap,
59.83	so there's this to prove that
59.83	Sturgeon was correct.
63.703	(Laughter)
65.218	(Applause)
69.011	(Laughter)
73.404	Sir, this is not your show.
76.597	(Laughter)
80.933	Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?
84.962	Jesus.
86.793	(Laughter)
88.884	Crazy people.
90.636	Well, the truth is,
94.015	why is the majority of everything bad?
98.828	And my answer is: I think we stop
98.828	thinking too soon.
103.011	I'll give you a clear little example,
105.031	something that people used to do
105.031	around the turn of the century --
109.164	not this century, the other one.
111.57	The idea was to take a piece of paper
114.574	and fold it inside out
114.574	using only your weaker hand,
119.802	in my case, the left hand.
121.657	Something that would look like this.
133.858	By the way you reacted, I can see
133.858	your lack of interest.
137.467	(Laughter)
139.105	But that's okay, I understand why.
141.116	We stop thinking too soon.
142.792	But if we give it
142.792	a little bit more thought,
144.928	like a paper clip.
146.296	A paper clip makes this a little bit
146.296	more interesting.
151.876	Not only that, if instead of using
151.876	my hand with the fingers,
154.867	I use my hand closed into a fist,
156.945	that makes this even a little
156.945	bit more interesting.
160.319	Not only that, but I will impose myself
160.319	a time limit of one second,
165.21	something that would look like this.
172.17	Now -- no, no, no.
174.231	Sturgeon may be correct.
177.698	But he doesn't have to be correct forever.
179.996	Things can always change.
181.214	Sir, what was the card?
183.291	The 10 of hearts?
185.41	There's this to prove that things
185.41	can always change --
190.573	the 10 of hearts.
192.839	(Applause)
195.998	Secrets are important.
199.846	And secrets are valuable.
202.406	And this is the best secret
202.406	I've ever experienced.
206.89	It starts with a deck of cards
206.89	onto the table,
209.981	an old man and a claim,
213.139	"""I will not touch the deck till the end."""
217.34	It doesn't matter who the man was,
219.028	all that matters was that sentence
219.028	ringing in my head:
224.642	"""I will not touch the deck till the end."""
228.476	Now, during all this time,
230.111	he was holding a small notebook
232.451	that sometimes he would open
232.451	and flip through the pages
235.262	and look at something.
236.865	But I was not really
236.865	paying attention to the book
240.489	because I was paying attention the deck
240.489	and the claim he had made before,
245.076	"""I will not touch the deck till the end."""
248.52	Now sir, you have the giraffe.
250.215	Go ahead, throw it in any direction
251.905	so that you can find
251.905	someone else at random.
255.025	Perfect. Sir, you're going to play
255.025	my role in this story.
259.157	The old man turned to me and he said,
261.281	"""You could pick a red card"
261.281	"or a black card."""
263.678	My answer was ...
265.069	Audience member 2: The black card.
266.719	HG: Indeed!
268.03	It was a black card.
270.194	"He said, ""It could be a club or a spade,"""
272.707	and my answer was ...
274.46	Audience member 2: Spade.
276.384	HG: Indeed! It was a spade.
279.819	"He said, ""It could be a high spade"
279.819	"or a low spade."""
282.954	And my answer was ...
284.819	Audience member 2: A high spade.
286.517	HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.
289.197	Since it's a high spade,
289.197	it could be a nine, a 10,
291.65	a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.
294.573	And my answer was ...
296.418	Audience member 2: The king.
298.159	HG: The king of spades, indeed.
302.275	Now sir, let's be fair.
303.417	You selected black, you selected spade,
306.421	you selected the high spade,
306.421	and you selected -- sorry?
309.011	Audience member 2: King.
309.011	HG: King of spades.
311.13	Did you feel I influenced you
311.13	in any decision?
313.801	Audience member 2: No, I just felt
313.801	your energy.
316.089	HG: But it was a free choice, correct?
317.931	Because if not, we could start
317.931	all over again.
320.094	But it was really fair?
320.094	Audience member 2: Absolutely.
322.639	HG: Now, the old man turned to me
322.639	and he asked me one more question,
325.958	a number between one and 52.
329.024	And the first number I thought of was ...
331.479	Audience member 2: 17.
332.841	HG: Indeed! It was the 17.
336.918	The old man only said one more thing:
339.977	"""This is the end."""
342.796	And I knew exactly what that meant.
346.984	I knew that he was going
346.984	to touch the deck.
350.749	Everything that you're about to see
350.749	is exactly as it looked.
357.177	He took the deck out of the box.
360.748	Nothing in the box.
363.726	"He counted, ""One, two, three, four,"
363.726	"five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."""
373.827	The tension was building.
376.092	(Laughter)
379.758	"""11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."""
389.077	And on the 17, instead of
389.077	the king of spades,
393.556	something appeared
393.556	in the middle of the deck,
397.607	that later, I would realize
397.607	was actually a secret.
403.903	The old man stood up, he left.
406.743	I never saw him again.
409.53	But he left his notebook
412.462	that was there from the beginning.
415.031	And when I picked it up,
417.566	that was the best secret
417.566	I've ever experienced.
424.23	We are defined by the secrets we keep
428.401	and by the secrets we share.
430.552	And this was his way
430.552	of sharing a secret with me.
435.417	(Applause)
444.43	Crazy shit! Now --
446.398	(Laughter)
450.166	I believe that amazing things
450.166	happen all the time.
456.575	I really do.
458.242	And the reason why we don't see
458.242	them as often,
461.42	it's because we don't
461.42	place ourselves in a position
464.366	to search for those amazing things.
467.748	But what if we decided to search
467.748	for those amazing things,
472.502	for those small coincidences
472.502	in life that are truly amazing?
478.742	So you have the giraffe,
480.355	go ahead, throw it in any direction
480.355	so you find one last person at random.
486.838	Sir, I'm going to ask you,
489.861	do you have, with you,
489.861	a United States $1 bill?
495.197	Audience member 3: I think so.
496.835	HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!
499.473	(Laughter)
502.177	Let's make sure you have it.
504.001	Do you have it?
505.291	Audience member 3: Yes.
505.291	HG: Yes! Perfect.
507.565	Now, I want you to do exactly the same
507.565	thing I am about to do.
510.539	I have a dollar bill here to explain.
512.33	I want you to take the dollar bill,
514.069	and fold the Washington part
514.069	inside, like this.
517.599	So you get this kind of big square, okay?
520.579	Now, I want you to take the bill
520.579	and fold it like this, lengthwise,
524.535	so it becomes like a rectangle,
526.054	and then again --
526.054	really fold it, really crease it --
528.573	and when you have it,
530.057	please fold the bill again
530.057	into a little square like this
533.533	and let me know when you have it.
536.708	Do you have it? Perfect.
537.936	Now, I'm going to approach,
540.301	and before we start,
541.8	I want to make sure that we do this
541.8	in very, very serious conditions.
545.097	First of all, I want to ensure that we
545.097	have a marker and we have a paper clip.
550.692	First of all, take the marker
550.692	and go ahead and sign the bill.
554.149	And this is the reason why:
555.875	later, I'm going to be doing
555.875	a bunch of stuff on stage
558.506	and I don't want you to think,
560.024	oh, while I was distracted by Helder,
562.479	someone came onstage and swapped the bill.
564.558	So I want to make sure
564.558	it's exactly the same bill.
567.033	Now not only that, I want you
567.033	to take the paper clip
569.532	and put it around the bill.
571.732	So even if nobody comes onstage
571.732	and switches the bill,
574.338	I don't have enough time
574.338	to go open the bill and close it
577.617	and see what I don't want to see.
579.28	Is that fair?
580.441	Now you can give me the marker back.
582.228	And just like that, very clearly,
584.488	I want to make sure that
584.488	we place this in full view
587.507	from the beginning of this experience
592.693	and to make sure that everyone
592.693	is going to see it,
595.174	we're going to actually have
595.174	a camera man onstage.
598.939	Yes, perfect, so that you can see.
601.249	That's your signature? Yes? Perfect.
603.579	Now, we're going to use
603.579	also the deck and a glass for this.
611.151	And we're going to put
611.151	ourselves in a position
613.969	to search for an amazing coincidence.
616.853	Do you mind, can you help me with this?
618.793	Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.
621.447	And do you mind, can you
621.447	take some cards and shuffle?
623.993	You can take some cards and shuffle.
626.024	You can shuffle cards
626.024	in a variety of ways.
628.102	You can shuffle cards like this.
629.634	You can shuffle cards
629.634	in a more messed up way,
631.815	something like this.
632.87	You can shuffle cards in the American way.
634.913	As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled
634.913	to teach you guys how to do it.
638.246	But the important part is
638.246	after shuffling the cards,
640.698	always remember
640.698	to cut and complete the cards.
642.951	Do you mind doing that for me, sir?
644.663	Please cut and complete.
645.859	And when you have it,
645.859	place the cards up in the air.
648.521	And you too, cut and complete
648.521	and up in the air.
650.784	Up in the air.
652.025	A deck of cards cut and shuffled
652.025	by one, two, three, four and five people.
656.403	Now, very clearly, I'm going
656.403	to gather the deck together.
662.494	And just like that.
666.163	I'm going to search for a coincidence
666.163	in front of everyone.
675.955	I'm going to try.
685.49	I have some cards that maybe,
689.689	maybe they don't mean anything.
692.904	But maybe that's because
692.904	we are not paying close attention.
696.734	Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.
700.317	Before we start,
700.317	sir, you gave me a dollar bill.
703.766	Is that your signature?
705.649	Audience member 3: Yes it is.
707.069	HG: I want you to see very clearly
711.174	that I'm going to open your bill
714.431	and reveal a small secret that we created.
719.228	And the secret of this dollar bill
719.228	is the serial number.
725.357	Madam, can you take the dollar bill?
729.296	In the serial number, there is a letter.
731.242	What is the first number after the letter?
734.485	Audience member 4: Seven.
735.985	HG: Seven.
737.884	Seven.
740.529	But, that's maybe just one coincidence.
743.509	What is the second number?
743.509	Audience member 4: Nine.
746.131	So after the seven, we have a nine.
751.155	And after the nine?
752.506	Audience member 4: Two.
753.613	HG: The two. And after the two?
755.633	Audience member 4: Three.
756.875	HG: Three, and after?
758.518	Audience member 4: Three.
758.518	HG: Three.
760.484	Audience member 4: Seven.
760.484	HG: Seven.
762.54	Audience member 4: Four.
762.54	HG: Four.
764.274	Audience member 4: Two.
764.274	HG: Two, and?
766.788	Audience member 4: Q.
768.718	HG: Q like in queen?
772.59	(Applause)
774.28	The queen of clubs!
775.59	All the cards in order, just for you.
779.42	And that's my show.
780.716	Thank you very much and have a nice night.
783.623	(Applause)
