12.879	The first time I stood
12.879	in the operating room
14.855	and watched a real surgery,
16.727	I had no idea what to expect.
19.302	I was a college student in engineering.
21.277	I thought it was going to be like on TV.
23.477	Ominous music playing in the background,
25.382	beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.
28.381	But it wasn't like that at all.
30.541	There was music playing on this day,
32.14	I think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)
34.862	And there was plenty of conversation,
36.989	not just about the patient's heart rate,
38.989	but about sports and weekend plans.
41.762	And since then, the more surgeries I watched,
43.698	the more I realized this is how it is.
45.525	In some weird way, it's just
45.525	another day at the office.
48.278	But every so often
50.183	the music gets turned down,
52.281	everyone stops talking,
53.711	and stares at exactly the same thing.
56.695	And that's when you know
56.695	that something absolutely critical
58.855	and dangerous is happening.
61.295	The first time I saw that
62.311	I was watching a type of surgery
63.543	called laparoscopic surgery
65.832	And for those of you who are unfamiliar,
68.39	laparoscopic surgery, instead of the large
70.783	open incision you might
70.783	be used to with surgery,
73.277	a laparoscopic surgery
73.277	is where the surgeon creates
75.485	these three or more small
75.485	incisions in the patient.
78.502	And then inserts these long, thin instruments
81.368	and a camera,
82.482	and actually does the procedure inside the patient.
86.333	This is great because there's
86.333	much less risk of infection,
88.925	much less pain, shorter recovery time.
92.085	But there is a trade-off,
94.677	because these incisions are created
96.461	with a long, pointed device
98.959	called a trocar.
100.423	And the way the surgeon uses this device
102.617	is that he takes it
104.033	and he presses it into the abdomen
106	until it punctures through.
109.255	And now the reason why 
109.255	everyone in the operating room
112.327	was staring at that device on that day
114.974	was because he had to be absolutely careful
118.205	not to plunge it through
119.672	and puncture it into the organs 
119.672	and blood vessels below.
123.613	But this problem should seem 
123.613	pretty familiar to all of you
125.452	because I'm pretty sure 
125.452	you've seen it somewhere else.
128.373	(Laughter)
130.165	Remember this?
131.821	(Applause)
135.937	You knew that at any second
137.813	that straw was going to plunge through,
139.693	and you didn't know if it was 
139.693	going to go out the other side
141.278	and straight into your hand,
142.581	or if you were going to
142.581	get juice everywhere,
144.277	but you were terrified. Right?
147.58	Every single time you did this,
149.556	you experienced the same
149.556	fundamental physics
152.112	that I was watching in the operating room that day.
155.192	And it turns out it really is a problem.
157.738	In 2003, the FDA actually came out and said
160.53	that trocar incisions might 
160.53	be the most dangerous step
163.907	in minimally invasive surgery.
165.923	Again in 2009, we see a paper that says
168.363	that trocars account for over half
170.547	of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.
174.234	And, oh by the way,
175.376	this hasn't changed for 25 years.
178.97	So when I got to graduate school,
180.5	this is what I wanted to work on.
182.368	I was trying to explain to a friend of mine
184.176	what exactly I was spending my time doing,
186.291	and I said,
188.107	"""It's like when you're drilling through a wall"
190.283	to hang something in your apartment.
193.483	There's that moment when the drill
193.483	first punctures through the wall
197.395	and there's this plunge. Right?
203.389	And he looked at me and he said,
205.43	"""You mean like when they drill "
205.43	"into people's brains?"""
208.901	"And I said, ""Excuse me?"" (Laughter)"
211.233	And then I looked it up and they
211.233	do drill into people's brains.
214.281	A lot of neurosurgical procedures
216.345	actually start with a drill
216.345	incision through the skull.
220.127	And if the surgeon isn't careful,
221.912	he can plunge directly into the brain.
225.496	So this is the moment when I started thinking,
227.662	okay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,
230.97	why not other areas of medicine?
232.634	Because think about it, when was
232.634	the last time you went to the doctor
234.578	and you didn't get stuck with something? Right?
237.325	So the truth is
238.642	in medicine puncture is everywhere.
241.194	And here are just a couple
241.194	of the procedures that I've found
243.986	that involve some tissue puncture step.
247.195	And if we take just three of them —
249.274	laparoscopic surgery, 
249.274	epidurals, and cranial drilling —
253.37	these procedures account 
253.37	for over 30,000 complications
257.349	every year in this country alone.
260.2	I call that a problem worth solving.
262.915	So let's take a look at some of the devices
265.24	that are used in these types of procedures.
267.744	I mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.
270.969	It's used to puncture through 
270.969	the ligaments in the spine
273.286	and deliver anesthesia during childbirth.
275.725	Here's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.
278.278	These are actually used
278.278	to burrow into the bone
280.214	and collect bone marrow
280.214	or sample bone lesions.
283.714	Here's a bayonette from the Civil War.
285.624	(Laughter)
288.64	If I had told you it was a 
288.64	medical puncture device
291.233	you probably would have believed me.
293.449	Because what's the difference?
295.642	So, the more I did this research
297.577	the more I thought there has to be
299.161	a better way to do this.
301.19	And for me the key to this problem
303.609	is that all these different puncture devices
306.02	share a common set of fundamental physics.
309.822	So what are those physics?
311.374	Let's go back to drilling through a wall.
312.966	So you're applying a force 
312.966	on a drill towards the wall.
316.598	And Newton says the wall
316.598	is going to apply force back,
319.942	equal and opposite.
321.207	So, as you drill through the wall,
323.17	those forces balance.
325.1	But then there's that moment
326.641	when the drill first punctures
326.641	through the other side of the wall,
328.777	and right at that moment 
328.777	the wall can't push back anymore.
331.633	But your brain hasn't reacted 
331.633	to that change in force.
335.1	So for that millisecond,
336.161	or however long it takes you 
336.161	to react, you're still pushing,
338.793	and that unbalanced force 
338.793	causes an acceleration,
341.337	and that is the plunge.
344.449	But what if right at the moment of puncture
348.353	you could pull that tip back,
349.977	actually oppose the forward acceleration?
352.99	That's what I set out to do.
355.127	So imagine you have a device
356.447	and it's got some kind of sharp tip 
356.447	to cut through tissue.
359.647	What's the simplest way 
359.647	you could pull that tip back?
362.86	I chose a spring.
364.671	So when you extend that spring, 
364.671	you extend that tip out
367.255	so it's ready to puncture tissue,
369.47	the spring wants to pull the tip back.
370.91	How do you keep the tip in place
372.663	until the moment of puncture?
375.127	I used this mechanism.
377.55	When the tip of the device
377.55	is pressed against tissue,
380.111	the mechanism expands outwards 
380.111	and wedges in place against the wall.
383.951	And the friction that's generated
385.655	locks it in place and prevents
385.655	the spring from retracting the tip.
388.847	But right at the moment of puncture,
390.734	the tissue can't push back
390.734	on the tip anymore.
392.798	So the mechanism unlocks 
392.798	and the spring retracts the tip.
395.98	Let me show you that 
395.98	happening in slow motion.
397.63	This is about 2,000 frames a second,
399.278	and I'd like you to notice the tip
401.15	that's right there on the bottom, 
401.15	about to puncture through tissue.
403.778	And you'll see that 
403.778	right at the moment of puncture,
408.59	right there, the mechanism unlocks 
408.59	and retracts that tip back.
411.892	I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.
414.236	You're going to see the sharp bladed tip,
416.428	and right when it punctures 
416.428	that rubber membrane
418.42	it's going to disappear
418.42	into this white blunt sheath.
422.572	Right there.
424.437	That happens within four 100ths 
424.437	of a second after puncture.
429.101	And because this device is designed
429.101	to address the physics of puncture
432.901	and not the specifics of cranial drilling
434.733	or laparoscopic surgery, 
434.733	or another procedure,
436.94	it's applicable across these
436.94	different medical disciplines
439.597	and across different length scales.
442.628	But it didn't always look like this.
444.741	This was my first prototype.
446.926	Yes, those are popsicle sticks,
449.568	and there's a rubber band at the top.
451.47	It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.
454.87	And it proved to me that my idea worked
456.566	and it justified the next couple
456.566	years of work on this project.
459.958	I worked on this because
461.766	this problem really fascinated me.
463.429	It kept me up at night.
465.558	But I think it should fascinate you too,
468.54	because I said puncture is everywhere.
470.442	That means at some point 
470.442	it's going to be your problem too.
474.706	That first day in the operating room
476.266	I never expected to find myself 
476.266	on the other end of a trocar.
479.25	But last year, I got appendicitis 
479.25	when I was visiting Greece.
483.14	So I was in the hospital in Athens,
484.97	and the surgeon was telling me
486.458	he was going to perform 
486.458	a laparoscopic surgery.
488.594	He was going to remove my appendix 
488.594	through these tiny incisions,
491.346	and he was talking about what
491.346	I could expect for the recovery,
494.04	and what was going to happen.
495.482	"He said, ""Do you have any questions?"""
495.482	"And I said, ""Just one, doc."
497.9	"What kind of trocar do you use?"""
501.374	So my favorite quote 
501.374	about laparoscopic surgery
504.879	comes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:
507.525	"""It is puncture itself that causes risk."""
511.189	That's my favorite quote 
511.189	because H.C. Jacobaeus
514.325	was the first person to ever perform 
514.325	laparoscopic surgery on humans,
518.365	and he wrote that in 1912.
521.797	This is a problem that's been injuring and
521.797	even killing people for over 100 years.
527.581	So it's easy to think that for
527.581	every major problem out there
529.815	there's some team of experts 
529.815	working around the clock to solve it.
533.751	The truth is that's not always the case.
537.1	We have to be better at finding those problems
539.545	and finding ways to solve them.
542.313	So if you come across a problem that grabs you,
545.569	let it keep you up at night.
547.45	Allow yourself to be fascinated,
549.593	because there are so many lives to save.
552.505	(Applause)
