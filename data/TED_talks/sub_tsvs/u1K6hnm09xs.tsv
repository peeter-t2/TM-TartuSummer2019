13.24	I come from Lebanon,
16.14	and I believe that running
16.14	can change the world.
20.08	I know what I have just said
20.08	is simply not obvious.
24.24	You know, Lebanon as a country
24.24	has been once destroyed
29.11	by a long and bloody civil war.
32.1	Honestly, I don't know
32.1	why they call it civil war
35.2	when there is nothing civil about it.
38.18	With Syria to the north,
38.18	Israel and Palestine to the south,
43.18	and our government
43.18	even up till this moment
46.24	is still fragmented and unstable.
50.14	For years, the country has been divided
50.14	between politics and religion.
57.07	However, for one day a year,
60.1	we truly stand united,
62.24	and that's when the marathon takes place.
67.05	I used to be a marathon runner.
70.17	Long distance running
70.17	was not only good for my well-being
75.05	but it helped me meditate and dream big.
79.21	So the longer distances I ran,
82.07	the bigger my dreams became.
85.05	Until one fateful morning,
88.09	and while training, I was hit by a bus.
94.16	I nearly died, was in a coma,
97.24	stayed at the hospital for two years,
101.03	and underwent 36 surgeries
101.03	to be able to walk again.
107.24	As soon as I came out of my coma,
110.15	I realized that I was no longer
110.15	the same runner I used to be,
115.19	so I decided, if I couldn't run myself,
119.24	I wanted to make sure that others could.
124.04	So out of my hospital bed,
126.09	I asked my husband to start taking notes,
129.09	and a few months later,
129.09	the marathon was born.
135.24	Organizing a marathon
135.24	as a reaction to an accident
139.24	may sound strange,
142.15	but at that time, even during
142.15	my most vulnerable condition,
147.13	I needed to dream big.
149.13	I needed something
149.13	to take me out of my pain,
152.12	an objective to look forward to.
155.18	I didn't want to pity myself,
155.18	nor to be pitied,
160.05	and I thought by organizing
160.05	such a marathon,
163.17	I'll be able to pay back to my community,
166.17	build bridges with the outside world,
169.07	and invite runners to come to Lebanon
171.24	and run under the umbrella of peace.
176.24	Organizing a marathon in Lebanon
179.1	is definitely not like organizing
179.1	one in New York.
184.18	How do you introduce
184.18	the concept of running
187.14	to a nation that is constantly
187.14	at the brink of war?
192.2	How do you ask those
192.2	who were once fighting
195.17	and killing each other
197.17	to come together and run
197.17	next to each other?
201.15	More than that, how do you convince people
201.15	to run a distance of 26.2 miles
208.08	at a time they were not even familiar
208.08	"with the word ""marathon""?"
213.14	So we had to start from scratch.
215.24	For almost two years,
215.24	we went all over the country
219.19	and even visited remote villages.
223.14	I personally met with people
223.14	from all walks of life --
227.22	mayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,
230.24	politicians, militiamen,
234.01	people from mosques, churches,
236.24	the president of the country,
236.24	even housewives.
241.13	I learned one thing:
244.07	When you walk the talk,
244.07	people believe you.
248.18	Many were touched by my personal story,
252.18	and they shared their stories in return.
255.24	It was honesty and transparency
255.24	that brought us together.
261.07	We spoke one common language
261.07	to each other,
264.24	and that was from one human to another.
269.19	Once that trust was built,
272.05	everybody wanted
272.05	to be part of the marathon
275.02	to show the world the true colors
275.02	of Lebanon and the Lebanese
280.15	and their desire to live
280.15	in peace and harmony.
285.15	In October 2003, over 6,000 runners
290.15	from 49 different nationalities
293.04	came to the start line, all determined,
297.02	and when the gunfire went off,
299.19	this time it was a signal
299.19	to run in harmony,
304.19	for a change.
306.24	The marathon grew.
308.23	So did our political problems.
311.24	But for every disaster we had,
314.17	the marathon found ways
314.17	to bring people together.
320.11	In 2005, our prime minister
320.11	was assassinated,
325.03	and the country came
325.03	to a complete standstill,
329.08	so we organized a five-kilometer
329.08	United We Run campaign.
333.24	Over 60,000 people came to the start line,
337.17	all wearing white T-shirts
337.17	with no political slogans.
343.12	That was a turning point for the marathon,
346.1	where people started
346.1	looking at it as a platform
350.01	for peace and unity.
352.19	Between 2006 up to 2009,
352.19	our country, Lebanon,
357.24	went through unstable years,
360.17	invasions, and more assassinations
363.2	that brought us close to a civil war.
366.1	The country was divided again,
368.21	so much that our parliament resigned,
372.06	we had no president for a year,
372.06	and no prime minister.
377.06	But we did have a marathon.
380.2	(Applause)
387.06	So through the marathon, we learned
387.06	that political problems can be overcome.
394.02	When the opposition party decided
394.02	to shut down part of the city center,
398.24	we negotiated alternative routes.
402.15	Government protesters
402.15	became sideline cheerleaders.
406.22	They even hosted juice stations.
409.11	(Laughter)
411.23	You know, the marathon
411.23	has really become one of its kind.
417.01	It gained credibility
418.22	from both the Lebanese
418.22	and the international community.
424.04	Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners
424.04	from 85 different nationalities
430.24	came to the start line,
432.14	but this time, they challenged
432.14	a very stormy and rainy weather.
437.18	The streets were flooded,
437.18	but people didn't want to miss out
441.18	on the opportunity of being part
441.18	of such a national day.
447.04	BMA has expanded.
448.19	We include everyone:
448.19	the young, the elderly,
452.16	the disabled, the mentally challenged,
455.16	the blind, the elite, the amateur runners,
459.03	even moms with their babies.
461.24	Themes have included
461.24	runs for the environment,
465.09	breast cancer, for the love
465.09	of Lebanon, for peace,
469	or just simply to run.
472.03	The first annual all-women-and-girls
472.03	race for empowerment,
478.14	which is one of its kind in the region,
480.24	has just taken place only a few weeks ago,
484.1	with 4,512 women,
484.1	including the first lady,
489.21	and this is only the beginning.
493.23	Thank you.
495.23	(Applause)
499.12	BMA has supported charities and volunteers
504.03	who have helped reshape Lebanon,
507.05	raising funds for their causes
509.17	and encouraging others to give.
512.22	The culture of giving and doing good
512.22	has become contagious.
517.11	Stereotypes have been broken.
519.19	Change-makers and future leaders
519.19	have been created.
524.13	I believe these are the building blocks
524.13	for future peace.
531.04	BMA has become such a respected
531.04	event in the region
537.19	that government officials in the region,
540.13	like Iraq, Egypt and Syria,
543.12	have asked the organization to help them
543.12	structure a similar sporting event.
550.03	We are now one of the largest
550.03	running events in the Middle East,
554.12	but most importantly,
556.12	it is a platform for hope and cooperation
560.24	in an ever-fragile
560.24	and unstable part of the world.
566.21	From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
572.05	(Applause)
577.24	After 10 years in Lebanon,
579.23	from national marathons
579.23	or from national events
583.15	to smaller regional races,
585.22	we've seen that people want
585.22	to run for a better future.
591.11	After all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
597.07	It is more of a marathon.
599.12	Thank you.
600.13	(Applause)
