16.327	So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones
19.05	could see the world in the same way that we do,
21.448	as we're walking around being able
23.374	to point a phone at anything,
25.573	and then have it actually recognize images and objects
27.668	like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information
30.438	from an almost infinite library of knowledge
33.437	and experiences and ideas.
35.55	Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,
37.637	but now we've moved to a world
38.787	where actually this has become possible.
41.118	So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
43.713	What you can see over here is Tamara,
45.318	who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.
47.133	So let me start with this.
49.069	What we have here is a painting
50.637	of the great poet Rabbie Burns,
52.893	and it's just a normal image,
54.71	but if we now switch inputs over to the phone,
57.101	running our technology, you can see
59.326	effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,
61.668	and when she points at this image,
63.221	something magical happens.
65.438	(Laughter) (Bagpipes)
69.8	(Bagpipes) (Applause)
72.408	(Bagpipes)
79.303	Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
81.086	Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,
82.711	there's no trickery here.
84.523	There's nothing done to this image.
87.159	And what's great about this is the technology's
90.184	actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand
92.759	much like how the human brain does.
94.889	Not only that, but as I move the object around,
97.392	it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
103.431	Again, the thing that's incredible about this is
105.468	this is how advanced these devices have become.
107.654	All the processing to do that was actually done
109.782	on the device itself.
112.248	Now, this has applications everywhere,
114.299	whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,
118.014	or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.
121.269	So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.
124.67	And here is this morning's newspaper,
126.662	and we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.
128.84	Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper
131.805	and immediately get the bulletin.
133.901	Voice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt
137.132	and you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing
139.528	to change direction at a split second,
142.049	and she does all that. She's won this title.
145.031	MM: And that linking of the digital content
148.216	to something that's physical is what we call an aura, and
150.645	I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.
153.012	So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,
156.304	more convenient way to get information in the real world,
159.124	but there are times when actually using this medium
161.643	allows you to be able to display information in a way
163.975	that was never before possible.
166.09	So what I have here is a wireless router.
168.929	My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,
172.194	so that everyone here&nbsp;understands — (Laughter) —
174.014	but nonetheless, here is the device.
177.459	So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions
180.529	for the device online, I can simply point at it,
183.135	the device is recognized, and then --
187.707	Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.
190.819	Then connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.
196.29	Congratulations. You have now completed setup.
199.646	(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.
201.812	(Applause)
204.922	The incredible work that made that possible was done
207.9	here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,
210.738	and they work in our offices,
212.523	and I've got a lovely picture of them here.
214.051	They couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to
215.81	bring their aura to the stage, so here they are.
223.215	They're not very animated. (Laughter)
225.139	This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)
229.407	Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,
232.872	let's now move on to technical advancements,
235.233	because since we started putting this technology
237.4	on mobile phones less than 12 months ago,
241.515	the speed and the processing in these devices
243.569	has grown at a really phenomenal rate,
245.969	and that means that I can now take cinema-quality
248.223	3D models and place them in the world around me,
251.433	so I have one over here.
253.617	Tamara, would you like to jump in?
259.025	(Music)
261.854	(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)
266.861	MM: I should leap in.
269.038	(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)
272.815	(Applause)
277.964	So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side
280.404	of what we do, because effectively, this technology
282.86	allows you to see the world through someone's eyes,
285.252	and for that person to be able to take a moment in time
288.165	and effectively store it and tag it to something physical
291.298	that exists in the real world.
293.275	What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.
295.796	They're open, they're available to everyone within our application,
298.924	and educators have really got on board with the classrooms.
302.606	So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,
304.98	teachers who've tagged up school classrooms,
307.02	and a great example of this is a school in the U.K.
309.193	I have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.
313.632	Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.
321.372	Child: TV. (Children react)
325.285	Child: Oh my God.
326.665	Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.
329.219	Move away from it and come back to it.
332.631	Child: Oh, that is so cool.
335.776	Teacher: And then, have you got it again?
338.663	Child: Oh my God! How did you do that?
343.071	Second child: It's magic.
345.803	(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.
349.376	It's available for everyone to do,
351.143	and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do
353.028	by doing one right now.
354.317	So, as sort of — I'm told it's called a stadium wave,
357.073	so we're going to start from this side of the room
358.39	on the count of three, and go over to here.
360.34	Tamara, are you recording?
361.723	Okay, so are you all ready?
363.607	One, two, three. Go!
365.806	Audience: Whooooooo!
369.431	MM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)
372.865	Okay. Now we're going to switch back
374.562	into the Aurasma application,
376.383	and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just
379.768	took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.
385.807	Now, we have lots of people who are doing this already,
389.112	and we've talked a little bit about the educational side.
391.37	On the emotional side, we have people who've
393.52	done things like send postcards and Christmas cards
396.592	back to their family with little messages on them.
399.818	We have people who have, for example,
402.047	taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car
404.104	and tagged up different components within an engine,
406.569	so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,
408.848	you can point and discover the information.
411.409	We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
414.479	In the last 20 years, it's really
417.329	changed the way that we live and work,
419.223	and the way that we see the world, and what's great is,
422.255	we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,
424.569	because now we can literally take the content
427.976	that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy
431.172	and make it a part of the world around us.
433.544	It's completely free to download this application.
435.37	If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,
438.104	this process is very, very quick.
439.369	Oh, there we are. We can save it now.
441.282	It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing
443.518	to convert that image that we just took
445.639	into a sort of digital fingerprint,
447.543	and the great thing is, if you're a professional user,
449.576	-- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical
452.256	to what we've just used to create this demonstration.
454.75	The only difference is that you've got the ability
456.462	to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?
459.139	Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.
460.191	MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means
462.397	we can now point at the image, and there you all are.
464.816	MM on video: One, two, three. Go!
471.211	MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.
473.56	(Applause)
