12.46	Clouds.
14.77	Have you ever noticed how much
14.77	people moan about them?
17.392	They get a bad rap.
19.639	If you think about it,
19.639	the English language
22.186	has written into it negative
22.186	associations towards the clouds.
26.479	Someone who's down or depressed,
28.946	they're under a cloud.
30.637	And when there's bad news in store,
32.328	there's a cloud on the horizon.
35.176	I saw an article the other day.
37.208	It was about problems
37.208	with computer processing
40.394	over the Internet.
42.216	"""A cloud over the cloud,"""
42.216	was the headline.
47.14	It seems like they're everyone's default
49.123	doom-and-gloom metaphor.
51.397	But I think they're beautiful, don't you?
53.55	It's just that their beauty is missed
56.663	because they're so omnipresent,
58.663	so, I don't know, commonplace,
62.012	that people don't notice them.
63.465	They don't notice the beauty,
63.465	but they don't even notice the clouds
66.68	unless they get in the way of the sun.
68.957	And so people think of clouds as
71.262	things that get in the way.
73.342	They think of them as the annoying,
73.342	frustrating obstructions,
78.413	and then they rush off and do
78.413	some blue-sky thinking.
81.333	(Laughter)
83.718	But most people, when
83.718	you stop to ask them,
85.941	will admit to harboring a strange
85.941	sort of fondness for clouds.
90.791	It's like a nostalgic fondness,
93.45	and they make them think of their youth.
96.584	Who here can't remember thinking, well,
99.82	looking and finding shapes in the clouds
102.422	when they were kids?
103.765	You know, when you were
103.765	masters of daydreaming?
110.496	Aristophanes, the ancient
110.496	Greek playwright,
113.263	he described the clouds
113.263	as the patron godesses
116.614	of idle fellows
118.398	two and a half thousand years ago,
120.042	and you can see what he means.
121.495	It's just that these days,
121.495	us adults seem reluctant
125.952	to allow ourselves the indulgence
129.312	of just allowing our imaginations
131.944	to drift along in the breeze,
131.944	and I think that's a pity.
135.614	I think we should perhaps
135.614	do a bit more of it.
138	I think we should be a bit
138	more willing, perhaps,
141.02	to look at the beautiful sight
141.02	of the sunlight bursting out
144.963	from behind the clouds
144.963	"and go, ""Wait a minute,"
148.429	"that's two cats dancing the salsa!"""
150.768	(Laughter) (Applause)
152.165	Or seeing the big, white,
152.165	puffy one up there
157.931	over the shopping center looks like
159.853	the Abominable Snowman
159.853	going to rob a bank.
163.486	(Laughter)
166.682	They're like nature's version
166.682	of those inkblot images,
170.6	you know, that shrinks used
170.6	to show their patients
173.005	in the '60s,
174.272	and I think if you consider
174.272	the shapes you see in the clouds,
177.997	you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.
181.887	Let's say you're in love. All right?
183.766	And you look up and what do you see?
185.963	Right? Or maybe the opposite.
188.589	You've just been dumped by your partner,
190.633	and everywhere you look,
190.633	it's kissing couples.
193.742	(Laughter)
195.694	Perhaps you're having a moment
195.694	of existential angst.
199.45	You know, you're thinking
199.45	about your own mortality.
201.903	And there, on the horizon,
201.903	it's the Grim Reaper.
204.899	(Laughter)
207.858	Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.
211.303	(Laughter)
212.932	What would that mean?
216.004	What would that mean? I have no idea.
221.535	But one thing I do know is this:
223.765	The bad press that clouds
223.765	get is totally unfair.
227.14	I think we should stand up for them,
228.879	which is why, a few years ago,
230.332	I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.
233.018	Tens of thousands of members now
235.59	in almost 100 countries around the world.
237.616	And all these photographs
237.616	that I'm showing,
240.617	they were sent in by members.
242.973	And the society exists
242.973	to remind people of this:
246.437	Clouds are not something to moan about.
249.484	Far from it. They are, in fact,
251.867	the most diverse, evocative,
251.867	poetic aspect of nature.
259.577	I think, if you live
259.577	with your head in the clouds
262.844	every now and then, it helps you
262.844	keep your feet on the ground.
265.821	And I want to show you
265.821	why, with the help of
267.443	some of my favorite types of clouds.
269.523	Let's start with this one.
269.523	It's the cirrus cloud,
271.88	named after the Latin for a lock of hair.
274.8	It's composed entirely of ice crystals
276.421	cascading from the upper
276.421	reaches of the troposphere,
278.937	and as these ice crystals fall,
280.438	they pass through different
280.438	layers with different winds
283.082	and they speed up and slow down,
284.766	giving the cloud these
284.766	brush-stroked appearances,
287.825	these brush-stroke forms
287.825	known as fall streaks.
290.76	And these winds up there
290.76	can be very, very fierce.
292.771	They can be 200 miles
292.771	an hour, 300 miles an hour.
295.352	These clouds are bombing along,
296.853	but from all the way down here,
298.636	they appear to be moving
298.636	gracefully, slowly,
301.784	like most clouds.
303.993	And so to tune into the clouds
303.993	is to slow down,
307.216	to calm down.
309.161	It's like a bit of everyday meditation.
311.994	Those are common clouds.
313.154	What about rarer ones,
313.154	like the lenticularis,
315.956	the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?
318.307	These clouds form
318.307	in the region of mountains.
320.827	When the wind passes, rises
320.827	to pass over the mountain,
323.712	it can take on a wave-like
323.712	path in the lee of the peak,
326.951	with these clouds hovering at the crest
329.678	of these invisible standing waves of air,
332.338	these flying saucer-like forms,
334.6	and some of the early
334.6	black-and-white UFO photos
337.264	are in fact lenticularis clouds.
337.264	It's true.
340.18	A little rarer are the fallstreak holes.
340.18	All right?
344.019	This is when a layer is made
344.019	up of very, very cold
346.424	water droplets, and in one region
346.424	they start to freeze,
349.271	and this freezing sets off a chain
349.271	reaction which spreads outwards
352.438	with the ice crystals cascading
352.438	and falling down below,
355.142	giving the appearance
355.142	of jellyfish tendrils down below.
359.981	Rarer still, the Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz cloud.
364.061	Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.
367.503	This looks like a series
367.503	of breaking waves,
371.263	and it's caused by shearing
371.263	winds -- the wind
373.957	above the cloud layer
373.957	and below the cloud layer
376.22	differ significantly,
376.22	and in the middle, in between,
378.775	you get this undulating of the air,
380.658	and if the difference in those
380.658	speeds is just right,
383.159	the tops of the undulations curl over
385.061	in these beautiful breaking
385.061	wave-like vortices.
388.623	All right. Those are rarer
388.623	clouds than the cirrus,
391.028	but they're not that rare.
392.735	If you look up, and you
392.735	pay attention to the sky,
395.583	you'll see them sooner or later,
397.456	maybe not quite as dramatic
397.456	as these, but you'll see them.
400.242	And you'll see them around where you live.
402.296	Clouds are the most egalitarian
404.857	of nature's displays,
404.857	because we all have a good,
407.531	fantastic view of the sky.
410.162	And these clouds, these rarer clouds,
412.002	remind us that the exotic can
412.002	be found in the everyday.
416.722	Nothing is more nourishing,
416.722	more stimulating
419.481	to an active, inquiring
419.481	mind than being surprised,
422.948	being amazed. It's why we're
422.948	all here at TED, right?
426.644	But you don't need to rush off
429.589	away from the familiar, across the world
431.949	to be surprised.
433.411	You just need to step outside,
436.186	pay attention to what's so
436.186	commonplace, so everyday,
438.762	so mundane that everybody else misses it.
442.749	One cloud that people
442.749	rarely miss is this one:
445.163	the cumulonimbus storm cloud.
448.131	It's what's produces thunder
448.131	and lightning and hail.
450.632	These clouds spread
450.632	out at the top in this enormous
453.74	anvil fashion stretching 10
453.74	miles up into the atmosphere.
456.562	They are an expression
456.562	of the majestic architecture
459.981	of our atmosphere.
461.866	But from down below,
461.866	they are the embodiment
465.252	of the powerful, elemental force and power
469.383	that drives our atmosphere.
471.277	To be there is to be connected
471.277	in the driving rain
475.391	and the hail, to feel
475.391	connected to our atmosphere.
478.693	It's to be reminded that we are creatures
480.991	that inhabit this ocean of air.
482.7	We don't live beneath the sky.
482.7	We live within it.
486.097	And that connection, that visceral
486.097	connection to our atmosphere
490.18	feels to me like an antidote.
492.616	It's an antidote to the growing
492.616	tendency we have
495.72	to feel that we can really
495.72	ever experience life
499.595	by watching it on a computer
499.595	screen, you know,
501.81	when we're in a wi-fi zone.
504.26	But the one cloud that best expresses
506.544	why cloudspotting is more
506.544	valuable today than ever
509.469	is this one, the cumulus cloud.
512.66	Right? It forms on a sunny day.
514.739	If you close your eyes
514.739	and think of a cloud,
516.859	it's probably one of these
516.859	that comes to mind.
519.208	All those cloud shapes at the beginning,
521.832	those were cumulus clouds.
523.975	The sharp, crisp outlines
523.975	of this formation
527.599	make it the best
527.599	one for finding shapes in.
530.755	And it reminds us
532.727	of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,
536.671	what an aimless activity it is.
538.92	You're not going to change the world
540.659	by lying on your back and gazing
540.659	up at the sky, are you?
544.711	It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,
546.934	which is precisely why it's so important.
551.79	The digital world
551.79	conspires to make us feel
555.819	eternally busy, perpetually busy.
558.59	You know, when you're not dealing with
560.424	the traditional pressures
560.424	of earning a living
563.102	and putting food on the table,
563.102	raising a family,
565.756	writing thank you letters,
567.83	you have to now contend with
570.542	answering a mountain of unanswered emails,
574.108	updating a Facebook page,
575.966	feeding your Twitter feed.
578.514	And cloudspotting
578.514	legitimizes doing nothing.
582.3	(Laughter)
584.205	And sometimes we need â€”
586.857	(Applause)
592.465	Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.
596.548	We need to be reminded by these
599.33	patron goddesses of idle fellows
602.862	that slowing down
605.837	and being in the present,
605.837	not thinking about
609.64	what you've got to do
609.64	and what you should have done,
612.494	but just being here,
612.494	letting your imagination
615.229	lift from the everyday concerns down here
617.991	and just being in the present,
617.991	it's good for you,
620.823	and it's good for the way you feel.
622.961	It's good for your ideas.
622.961	It's good for your creativity.
626.529	It's good for your soul.
629.879	So keep looking up,
632.106	marvel at the ephemeral beauty,
635.159	and always remember to live life
635.159	with your head in the clouds.
638.583	Thank you very much.
639.77	(Applause)
