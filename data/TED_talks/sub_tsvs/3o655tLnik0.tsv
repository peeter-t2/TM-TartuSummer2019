12.739	So, I had been a photographer
15.56	for 18 years
17.018	before I began the Microsculpture Project.
19.436	And in that time,
19.436	I had shot global ad campaigns,
22.838	I had the opportunity to photograph
22.838	some of my generation's icons,
27.043	and I was traveling the world.
29.248	I got to a point in my career
29.248	that I dreamed of getting to,
33.09	and yet, for some reason,
33.09	I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.
36.787	Despite the extraordinary things
36.787	I was shooting and experiencing,
41	they'd started to feel
41	a little bit ordinary to me.
43.924	I was also getting concerned
45.475	about how disposable photography
45.475	had started to feel in the digital world,
49.625	and I really wanted to produce images
49.625	that had a sense of worth again.
53.508	And I needed a subject
53.508	that felt extraordinary.
57.594	Sometimes I wish
57.594	I had the eyes of a child.
59.976	And by that I mean,
59.976	I wish I could look at the world
62.544	in the same as I did
62.544	when I was a small boy.
65.293	I think there is a danger,
65.293	as we get older,
67.386	that our curiosity becomes
67.386	slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.
73.026	And as a visual creator,
73.026	one of the challenges for me
75.769	is to present the familiar
75.769	in a new and engaging way.
80.625	Fortunately for me, though,
80.625	I've got two great kids
83.148	who are still curious about the world.
85.806	Sebastian -- he's still curious
85.806	about the world, and in 2014, in spring,
90.955	he brought in a ground beetle
90.955	from the garden.
93.836	There was nothing particularly special
93.836	about this insect --
96.658	you know, it was a common species.
98.805	But he was still curious,
100.179	and he brought it up to my office,
102.611	and we decided to look at it
102.611	under his microscope.
105.062	He had a little science kit for Christmas.
108.009	And this is what we saw.
111.03	Now, when I first saw this,
111.03	it blew me away.
113.241	Up here -- this is the back
113.241	of the ground beetle.
116.302	When I first saw it,
116.302	it reminded me of a galaxy.
118.87	And all the time, this had just
118.87	been outside our window.
122.245	You know, I was looking
122.245	for this extraordinary subject,
124.954	and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity
124.954	to bring it in to me.
129.182	So I decided to photograph it for him,
129.182	and this is what I produced.
133.083	I basically asked myself
133.083	two simple questions.
135.853	The first one:
137.043	Could I take all my knowledge and skill
137.043	of photographic lighting
140.885	and take that onto a subject
140.885	that's five millimeters long?
144.039	But also: Could I keep
144.039	creative control over that lighting
147.694	on a subject that size?
149.434	So I practiced
149.434	on some other found specimens,
152.764	and I approached the Oxford University
152.764	Museum of Natural History
156.314	to see if I could have access
156.314	to their collection,
159.15	to progress the project.
161.268	And I went up there for a meeting,
163.09	and I showed them some of the images
163.09	that I'd been shooting,
165.99	and they could see
165.99	the kind of detail I was able to get.
169.65	I don't think they'd ever really seen
169.65	anything quite like it before,
172.953	and from that point forward,
172.953	they gave me open access
175.479	to their entire collection
176.817	and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan,
176.817	their entomologist.
181.953	Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,
184.031	I shot 37 insects from their collection.
187.718	And the way I work
189.45	is that I essentially split the insect
189.45	up into multiple sections,
193.558	and I treat each one of those sections
193.558	like a small still life.
197.39	So for example, if I was photographing
197.39	the eye of the insect,
201.134	which is normally quite smooth
201.134	and dome-shaped,
203.946	then I'd use a light source
203.946	that is large and soft and diffuse,
208.349	so I don't get any harsh hot spots
208.349	on that surface.
213.023	But once my attention
213.023	turns over to a hairy leg,
215.806	that lighting setup
215.806	will change completely.
218.403	And so I make that one tiny section
218.403	look as beautiful as I possibly can,
222.064	and I work my way across the insect
223.912	until I have about 20 or 25
223.912	different sections.
228.088	The issue with photography
228.088	at high magnification
231.949	is that there is inherently
231.949	a very shallow depth of field.
235.218	So to get around that, what I do is,
238.005	I put my camera on a rail
239.471	that I can automate
239.471	to move 10 microns in between each shot.
242.838	That's about one-seventh the width
242.838	of a human hair.
245.985	And then that provides me
245.985	with a deep stack of images.
250.148	Each has a tiny sliver of focus
250.148	all the way through.
253.233	And I can squash that down
255.353	to produce one image
255.353	that is fully focused from front to back.
258.808	So essentially, that gives me
262.377	and beautifully lit.
264.966	Now, each one of my images
266.532	is made up of anywhere
266.532	between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.
271.366	They take about three-and-a-half
271.366	weeks to create,
273.967	and the file sizes on average
273.967	are about four gigabytes.
278.244	So I've got plenty of information
278.244	to play with when I'm printing.
281.387	And the prints at the exhibition
281.387	are around the three-meter mark.
285.061	In fact, I had a show
285.061	in Milan two weeks ago,
287.648	and we had some prints there
287.648	that were nine meters long.
292.025	But, you know, I realize
293.225	that these images still have to work
293.225	in the digital world.
296.157	There's no point in me putting
296.157	all my blood, sweat and tears
299.273	into these pictures
300.448	if they're only going to be showing
303.597	So with the help of Rob Chandler
303.597	and Will Cookson,
307.162	we developed a website
308.98	that enables the viewer
308.98	to immerse themselves
311.809	into the full four-gigabyte files,
313.858	and they can explore
313.858	all that microscopic detail.
317.343	So if you have the time,
317.343	and I encourage you,
319.541	please visit microsculpture.net
321.332	and go and have a play.
322.871	It's good fun.
325.902	I first showed the work at Oxford,
327.868	and since then, it's moved on
327.868	to the Middle East.
330.816	It's now back in Europe
330.816	and goes to Copenhagen this month.
333.961	And the feedback has been great.
336.746	You know, I get emails, actually,
336.746	from all over the world --
341.415	from teachers, at the moment,
341.415	who are using the website in school.
344.594	The kids are using them on the tablet.
346.446	They're zooming into the pictures
348.171	and using it for art class, biology class.
350.816	And that's not something I planned.
352.594	That's just a beautiful offshoot
352.594	of the project.
355.98	In fact, one of the things
355.98	I like to do at the exhibitions
358.862	is actually look at
358.862	the kiddies' reactions.
360.963	And, you know, standing
360.963	in front of a three-meter insect,
363.71	they could have been horrified.
365.269	But they're not. They look in wonder.
367.179	This little chap here, he stood there
367.179	for five minutes, motionless.
370.649	(Laughter)
372.135	And at the end of the day, actually,
372.135	at the end of the day at the exhibitions,
376.072	we have to wipe down
376.072	the lower third of the big prints --
379.117	(Laughter)
380.14	just to remove
380.14	all those sticky handprints,
382.339	because all they want to do
382.339	is touch those big bugs.
386.899	I do want to leave you
386.899	with one final image, if that's OK.
389.754	This has to do with Charles Darwin.
391.827	One of the recent images
391.827	that I photographed
395.368	was this one here.
397.797	I'm talking about the creature
397.797	in the box, not my cat.
400.552	And this is a shield bug
403.335	that Charles Darwin
403.335	brought back from Australia
406.532	on the HMS Beagle in 1836.
409.757	And when I got it home,
411.545	I stood in my kitchen
411.545	and stared at it for about 20 minutes.
414.438	I couldn't believe I was in possession
414.438	of this beautiful creature.
418.275	And at that moment, I kind of realized
420.568	that this validated the project for me.
422.455	The fact that the museum
422.455	was willing to risk me playing with this
425.957	kind of showed me
425.957	that my images had worth --
428.307	you know, they weren't disposable.
430.742	That's the image that I produced.
432.693	I often wonder, still,
432.693	when I look at this:
434.843	What would Charles Darwin
434.843	make of these images?
437.347	Do you think he'd like his picture
437.347	of his shield bug? I hope so.
440.969	So --
442.157	(Applause)
446.633	You know, I think it's strange in a way.
448.604	I'm a visual person,
448.604	I'm a creative person,
450.686	but I still needed the eyes of a child
450.686	to find my extraordinary subject.
455.485	That's the way it was.
456.672	So all I can say is,
456.672	thank you very much, Sebastian;
459.201	I am very, very grateful.
460.45	Thank you.
461.639	(Applause)
