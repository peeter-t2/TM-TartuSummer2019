12.74	So, imagine that you had
12.74	your smartphone miniaturized
16.443	and hooked up directly to your brain.
19.711	If you had this sort of brain chip,
21.628	you'd be able to upload
21.628	and download to the internet
24.183	at the speed of thought.
25.986	Accessing social media or Wikipedia
25.986	would be a lot like --
29.277	well, from the inside at least --
30.941	like consulting your own memory.
33.247	It would be as easy
33.247	and as intimate as thinking.
37.579	But would it make it easier
37.579	for you to know what's true?
40.76	Just because a way
40.76	of accessing information is faster
43.745	it doesn't mean it's more
43.745	reliable, of course,
46.014	and it doesn't mean that we would all
46.014	interpret it the same way.
49.269	And it doesn't mean that you would be
49.269	any better at evaluating it.
52.887	In fact, you might even be worse,
54.568	because, you know, more data,
54.568	less time for evaluation.
58.378	Something like this is already
58.378	happening to us right now.
61.797	We already carry a world of information
61.797	around in our pockets,
65.679	but it seems as if the more information
65.679	we share and access online,
69.932	the more difficult it can be for us
69.932	to tell the difference
72.758	between what's real and what's fake.
75.507	It's as if we know more
75.507	but understand less.
80.152	Now, it's a feature
80.152	of modern life, I suppose,
83.113	that large swaths of the public
83.113	live in isolated information bubbles.
87.849	We're polarized: not just over values,
87.849	but over the facts.
92.527	One reason for that is, the data
92.527	analytics that drive the internet
96.148	get us not just more information,
98.571	but more of the information that we want.
100.781	Our online life is personalized;
103.195	everything from the ads we read
104.949	to the news that comes down
104.949	our Facebook feed
107.563	is tailored to satisfy our preferences.
111.279	And so while we get more information,
113.109	a lot of that information ends up
113.109	reflecting ourselves
116.363	as much as it does reality.
119.198	It ends up, I suppose,
121.691	inflating our bubbles
121.691	rather than bursting them.
125.331	And so maybe it's no surprise
127.484	that we're in a situation,
127.484	a paradoxical situation,
130.413	of thinking that we know so much more,
132.568	and yet not agreeing
132.568	on what it is we know.
137.259	So how are we going to solve
137.259	this problem of knowledge polarization?
140.855	One obvious tactic is to try
140.855	to fix our technology,
145.047	to redesign our digital platforms,
146.98	so as to make them less
146.98	susceptible to polarization.
150.884	And I'm happy to report
152.107	that many smart people at Google
152.107	and Facebook are working on just that.
156.771	And these projects are vital.
159.837	I think that fixing technology
159.837	is obviously really important,
162.991	but I don't think technology alone,
162.991	fixing it, is going to solve the problem
167.637	of knowledge polarization.
169.015	I don't think that because I don't think,
169.015	at the end of the day,
172.114	it is a technological problem.
173.767	I think it's a human problem,
175.666	having to do with how we think
175.666	and what we value.
180.285	In order to solve it, I think
180.285	we're going to need help.
182.924	We're going to need help
182.924	from psychology and political science.
185.953	But we're also going to need help,
185.953	I think, from philosophy.
190.663	Because to solve the problem
190.663	of knowledge polarization,
195.522	we're going to need to reconnect
198.455	with one fundamental, philosophical idea:
203.219	that we live in a common reality.
206.671	The idea of a common reality
206.671	is like, I suppose,
210.722	a lot of philosophical concepts:
212.309	easy to state
213.499	but mysteriously difficult
213.499	to put into practice.
217.003	To really accept it,
218.332	I think we need to do three things,
220.573	each of which is a challenge right now.
224.749	First, we need to believe in truth.
228.267	You might have noticed
229.454	that our culture is having
229.454	something of a troubled relationship
232.493	with that concept right now.
235.061	It seems as if we disagree so much that,
238.298	as one political commentator
238.298	put it not long ago,
241.131	it's as if there are no facts anymore.
244.986	But that thought is actually an expression
249.232	of a sort of seductive line
249.232	of argument that's in the air.
253.668	It goes like this:
256.188	we just can't step outside
256.188	of our own perspectives;
259.063	we can't step outside of our biases.
261.529	Every time we try,
263.026	we just get more information
263.026	from our perspective.
267.536	So, this line of thought goes,
271.016	we might as well admit
271.016	that objective truth is an illusion,
274.802	or it doesn't matter,
275.98	because either we'll never
275.98	know what it is,
279.039	or it doesn't exist in the first place.
283.173	That's not a new philosophical thought --
286.193	skepticism about truth.
289.332	During the end of the last century,
289.332	as some of you know,
292.237	it was very popular in certain
292.237	academic circles.
295.317	But it really goes back all the way
295.317	to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,
300.474	if not farther back.
302.252	Protagoras said that objective
302.252	truth was an illusion
304.725	"because ""man is the measure"
304.725	"of all things."""
307.656	Man is the measure of all things.
310.169	That can seem like a bracing bit
310.169	of realpolitik to people,
313.016	or liberating,
314.199	because it allows each of us
314.199	to discover or make our own truth.
320.618	But actually, I think it's a bit
320.618	of self-serving rationalization
324.804	disguised as philosophy.
327.507	It confuses the difficulty
327.507	of being certain
330.339	with the impossibility of truth.
334.223	Look --
336.768	of course it's difficult
336.768	to be certain about anything;
340.908	"we might all be living in ""The Matrix."""
344.018	You might have a brain chip in your head
346.024	feeding you all the wrong information.
349.593	But in practice, we do agree
349.593	on all sorts of facts.
353.796	We agree that bullets can kill people.
357.616	We agree that you can't flap
357.616	your arms and fly.
362.023	We agree -- or we should --
365.018	that there is an external reality
367.339	and ignoring it can get you hurt.
371.205	Nonetheless, skepticism
371.205	about truth can be tempting,
375.378	because it allows us to rationalize
375.378	away our own biases.
378.716	When we do that, we're sort of like
378.716	the guy in the movie
381.727	"who knew he was living in ""The Matrix"""
384.793	but decided he liked it there, anyway.
389.031	After all, getting what you
389.031	want feels good.
392.271	Being right all the time feels good.
394.991	So, often it's easier for us
397.797	to wrap ourselves in our cozy
397.797	information bubbles,
402.049	live in bad faith,
403.614	and take those bubbles
403.614	as the measure of reality.
408.595	An example, I think, of how
408.595	this bad faith gets into our action
414.464	is our reaction
414.464	to the phenomenon of fake news.
419.874	The fake news that spread on the internet
422.828	during the American
422.828	presidential election of 2016
427.506	was designed to feed into our biases,
430.157	designed to inflate our bubbles.
432.295	But what was really striking about it
434.37	was not just that it fooled
434.37	so many people.
437.595	What was really striking to me
437.595	about fake news,
440.46	the phenomenon,
441.822	is how quickly it itself became
441.822	the subject of knowledge polarization;
447.582	so much so, that the very term --
447.582	"the very term -- ""fake news"""
451.285	"now just means: ""news story I don't like."""
455.367	That's an example of the bad faith
455.367	towards the truth that I'm talking about.
463.24	But the really, I think, dangerous thing
467.981	about skepticism with regard to truth
471.476	is that it leads to despotism.
474.35	"""Man is the measure of all things"""
477.297	"inevitably becomes ""The Man"
477.297	"is the measure of all things."""
481.852	"Just as ""every man for himself"""
484.526	always seems to turn out to be
484.526	"""only the strong survive."""
488.345	"At the end of Orwell's ""1984,"""
492.136	the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing
492.136	the protagonist Winston Smith
496.419	into believing two plus two equals five.
500.571	What O'Brien says is the point,
505.486	is that he wants to convince Smith
505.486	that whatever the party says is the truth,
509.931	and the truth is whatever the party says.
513.484	And what O'Brien knows
513.484	is that once this thought is accepted,
518.387	critical dissent is impossible.
521.857	You can't speak truth to power
524.069	if the power speaks truth by definition.
528.88	I said that in order to accept
528.88	that we really live in a common reality,
533.147	we have to do three things.
534.458	The first thing is to believe in truth.
536.467	The second thing can be summed up
538.161	by the Latin phrase that Kant took
538.161	as the motto for the Enlightenment:
543.271	"""Sapere aude,"""
544.932	"or ""dare to know."""
546.688	Or as Kant wants,
546.688	"""to dare to know for yourself."""
550.208	I think in the early days of the internet,
552.274	a lot of us thought
553.464	that information technology
553.464	was always going to make it easier
557.298	for us to know for ourselves,
559.177	and of course in many ways, it has.
561.893	But as the internet has become
561.893	more and more a part of our lives,
565.755	our reliance on it, our use of it,
567.738	has become often more passive.
570.322	Much of what we know today we Google-know.
573.299	We download prepackaged sets of facts
577.018	and sort of shuffle them along
577.018	the assembly line of social media.
581.357	Now, Google-knowing is useful
582.811	precisely because it involves
582.811	a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
586.031	We offload our effort onto a network
586.031	of others and algorithms.
591.82	And that allows us, of course,
591.82	to not clutter our minds
594.851	with all sorts of facts.
596.314	We can just download them
596.314	when we need them.
598.625	And that's awesome.
601.348	But there's a difference
601.348	between downloading a set of facts
606.809	and really understanding how or why
606.809	those facts are as they are.
613.237	Understanding why
613.237	a particular disease spreads,
617.635	or how a mathematical proof works,
619.718	or why your friend is depressed,
621.755	involves more than just downloading.
625.396	It's going to require, most likely,
627.501	doing some work for yourself:
630.503	having a little creative insight;
632.367	using your imagination;
633.657	getting out into the field;
634.999	doing the experiment;
636.205	working through the proof;
637.5	talking to someone.
643.533	Now, I'm not saying, of course,
643.533	that we should stop Google-knowing.
648.402	I'm just saying
649.577	we shouldn't overvalue it, either.
651.287	We need to find ways of encouraging
651.287	forms of knowing that are more active,
656.512	and don't always involve passing off
656.512	our effort into our bubble.
662.242	Because the thing about Google-knowing
662.242	is that too often it ends up
665.607	being bubble-knowing.
667.581	And bubble-knowing means
667.581	always being right.
671.183	But daring to know,
673.404	daring to understand,
676.151	means risking the possibility
676.151	that you could be wrong.
679.921	It means risking the possibility
682.213	that what you want and what's true
682.213	are different things.
688.07	Which brings me to the third thing
688.07	that I think we need to do
691.854	if we want to accept that we live
691.854	in a common reality.
694.91	That third thing is:
694.91	have a little humility.
698.51	By humility here, I mean
698.51	epistemic humility,
700.656	which means, in a sense,
703.701	knowing that you don't know it all.
706.128	But it also means something
706.128	more than that.
708.205	It means seeing your worldview
708.205	as open to improvement
712.679	by the evidence and experience of others.
714.834	Seeing your worldview
714.834	as open to improvement
716.907	by the evidence and experience of others.
720.084	That's more than just
720.084	being open to change.
722.147	It's more than just being open
722.147	to self-improvement.
724.569	It means seeing your knowledge
724.569	as capable of enhancing
728.878	or being enriched
728.878	by what others contribute.
732.224	That's part of what is involved
734.962	in recognizing there's a common reality
738.116	that you, too, are responsible to.
741.633	I don't think it's much
741.633	of a stretch to say
743.862	that our society is not particularly great
743.862	at enhancing or encouraging
748.841	that sort of humility.
750.08	That's partly because,
752.81	well, we tend to confuse
752.81	arrogance and confidence.
756.263	And it's partly because, well, you know,
759.341	arrogance is just easier.
760.918	It's just easier to think of yourself
760.918	as knowing it all.
763.619	It's just easier to think of yourself
763.619	as having it all figured out.
768.513	But that's another example
768.513	of the bad faith towards the truth
771.47	that I've been talking about.
775.391	So the concept of a common reality,
777.652	like a lot of philosophical concepts,
780.366	can seem so obvious,
782.785	that we can look right past it
785.945	and forget why it's important.
789.394	Democracies can't function
789.394	if their citizens don't strive,
794.362	at least some of the time,
795.756	to inhabit a common space,
797.461	a space where they can pass
797.461	ideas back and forth
802.123	when -- and especially when --
803.933	they disagree.
805.749	But you can't strive to inhabit that space
809.56	if you don't already accept
809.56	that you live in the same reality.
815.144	To accept that, we've got
815.144	to believe in truth,
817.339	we've got to encourage
817.339	more active ways of knowing.
821.394	And we've got to have the humility
824.271	to realize that we're not
824.271	the measure of all things.
829.049	We may yet one day realize the vision
832.597	of having the internet in our brains.
836.545	But if we want that to be liberating
836.545	and not terrifying,
840.488	if we want it to expand our understanding
843.274	and not just our passive knowing,
846.585	we need to remember that our perspectives,
850.248	as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,
854.171	are just that --
855.475	perspectives on one reality.
859.096	Thank you.
860.391	(Applause)
