12.372	I think we're all aware
14.085	that the world today is full of problems.
17.058	We've been hearing them
19.153	today and yesterday and every day for decades.
23.443	Serious problems, big problems, pressing problems.
27.487	Poor nutrition, access to water,
30.843	climate change, deforestation,
33.88	lack of skills, insecurity, not enough food,
37.124	not enough healthcare, pollution.
40.1	There's problem after problem,
41.845	and I think what really separates this time
44.376	from any time I can remember in my brief time
48.5	on Earth is the awareness of these problems.
50.935	We're all very aware.
53.501	Why are we having so much trouble
55.529	dealing with these problems?
57.36	That's the question I've been struggling with,
60.4	coming from my very different perspective.
64.569	I'm not a social problem guy.
67.652	I'm a guy that works with business,
70.414	helps business make money.
73.704	God forbid.
76.938	So why are we having so many problems
79.992	with these social problems,
83.135	and really is there any role for business,
85.192	and if so, what is that role?
88.725	I think that in order to address that question,
91.584	we have to step back and think about
95.45	how we've understood and pondered
99.105	both the problems and the solutions
101.103	to these great social challenges that we face.
105.267	Now, I think many have seen business
108.101	as the problem, or at least one of the problems,
110.976	in many of the social challenges we face.
113.728	You know, think of the fast food industry,
115.134	the drug industry, the banking industry.
117.109	You know, this is a low point
119.288	in the respect for business.
122.279	Business is not seen as the solution.
123.989	It's seen as the problem now, for most people.
127.73	And rightly so, in many cases.
129.704	There's a lot of bad actors out there
131.983	that have done the wrong thing,
134.16	that actually have made the problem worse.
135.961	So this perspective is perhaps justified.
139.424	How have we tended to see the solutions
142.014	to these social problems,
144.35	these many issues that we face in society?
147.512	Well, we've tended to see the solutions
149.144	in terms of NGOs,
151.296	in terms of government,
153.302	in terms of philanthropy.
155.439	Indeed, the kind of unique organizational entity
157.873	of this age is this tremendous rise of NGOs
162.63	and social organizations.
165.136	This is a unique, new organizational form
167.96	that we've seen grown up.
169.153	Enormous innovation, enormous energy,
172.56	enormous talent now has been mobilized
175.295	through this structure
177.415	to try to deal with all of these challenges.
182.268	And many of us here are deeply involved in that.
186.525	I'm a business school professor,
188.034	but I've actually founded, I think, now, four nonprofits.
192.049	Whenever I got interested and became aware
194.938	of a societal problem, that was what I did,
197.998	form a nonprofit.
199.876	That was the way we've thought about how to deal
202.939	with these issues.
203.948	Even a business school professor has thought about it that way.
208.4	But I think at this moment,
210.235	we've been at this for quite a while.
213.004	We've been aware of these problems for decades.
215.856	We have decades of experience
217.766	with our NGOs and with our government entities,
222.091	and there's an awkward reality.
223.92	The awkward reality is we're not making
225.862	fast enough progress.
228.446	We're not winning.
231.17	These problems still seem very daunting
233.254	and very intractable,
234.46	and any solutions we're achieving
237.16	are small solutions.
239.1	We're making incremental progress.
242.982	What's the fundamental problem we have
245.704	in dealing with these social problems?
248.782	If we cut all the complexity away,
252.814	we have the problem of scale.
256.193	We can't scale.
259.304	We can make progress. We can show benefits.
262.231	We can show results. We can make things better.
265.559	We're helping. We're doing better. We're doing good.
269.837	We can't scale.
272.191	We can't make a large-scale impact on these problems.
277.157	Why is that?
278.991	Because we don't have the resources.
282.581	And that's really clear now.
284.292	And that's clearer now than it's been for decades.
287.174	There's simply not enough money
290.726	to deal with any of these problems at scale
294.117	using the current model.
296.442	There's not enough tax revenue,
299.512	there's not enough philanthropic donations,
303.558	to deal with these problems the way we're dealing with them now.
306.006	We've got to confront that reality.
311.171	And the scarcity of resources
314.23	for dealing with these problems is only growing,
318.257	certainly in the advanced world today,
321.807	with all the fiscal problems we face.
326.186	So if it's fundamentally a resource problem,
330.431	where are the resources in society?
334.476	How are those resources really created,
336.861	the resources we're going to need to deal
338.568	with all these societal challenges?
342.208	Well there, I think the answer is very clear:
345.324	They're in business.
349.01	All wealth is actually created by business.
354.621	Business creates wealth
357.347	when it meets needs at a profit.
362.393	That's how all wealth is created.
364.857	It's meeting needs at a profit
367.23	that leads to taxes
369.642	and that leads to incomes
371.311	and that leads to charitable donations.
373.578	That's where all the resources come from.
376.829	Only business can actually create resources.
379.287	Other institutions can utilize them
381.241	to do important work,
382.466	but only business can create them.
385.65	And business creates them
387.171	when it's able to meet a need at a profit.
395.049	The resources are overwhelmingly
398.433	generated by business.
400.322	The question then is, how do we tap into this?
405.625	How do we tap into this?
408	Business generates those resources
410.947	when it makes a profit.
415.616	That profit is that small difference
418.99	between the price and the cost it takes to produce
423.836	whatever solution business has created
426.153	to whatever problem they're trying to solve.
429.376	But that profit is the magic.
436.136	Why? Because that profit allows whatever solution
440.89	we've created
443.109	to be infinitely scalable.
447.299	Because if we can make a profit,
449.9	we can do it for 10, 100, a million,
456.716	The solution becomes self-sustaining.
461.436	That's what business does
464.035	when it makes a profit.
467.645	Now what does this all have to do
470.029	with social problems?
473.097	Well, one line of thinking is, let's take this profit
476.379	and redeploy it into social problems.
481.928	Business should give more.
483.194	Business should be more responsible.
484.618	And that's been the path that we've been on
487.068	in business.
489.754	But again, this path that we've been on
491.618	is not getting us where we need to go.
495.958	Now, I started out as a strategy professor,
499.106	and I'm still a strategy professor.
500.612	I'm proud of that.
501.971	But I've also, over the years,
503.497	worked more and more on social issues.
506.153	I've worked on healthcare, the environment,
509.42	economic development, reducing poverty,
512.992	and as I worked more and more in the social field,
517.337	I started seeing something
518.899	that had a profound impact on me
522.169	and my whole life, in a way.
525.755	The conventional wisdom in economics
529.544	and the view in business has historically been
533.412	that actually, there's a tradeoff
537.369	between social performance and economic performance.
542.377	The conventional wisdom has been
543.861	that business actually makes a profit
546.931	by causing a social problem.
548.724	The classic example is pollution.
550.906	If business pollutes, it makes more money
553.682	than if it tried to reduce that pollution.
558.323	Reducing pollution is expensive,
560.214	therefore businesses don't want to do it.
565.697	It's profitable to have an unsafe working environment.
568.642	It's too expensive to have a safe working environment,
571.38	therefore business makes more money
572.686	if they don't have a safe working environment.
574.526	That's been the conventional wisdom.
578.023	A lot of companies have fallen into that conventional wisdom.
580.836	They resisted environmental improvement.
583.379	They resisted workplace improvement.
588.813	That thinking has led to, I think,
592.359	much of the behavior
593.879	that we have come to criticize in business,
595.815	that I come to criticize in business.
598.335	But the more deeply I got into all these social issues,
601.868	one after another,
604.88	and actually, the more I tried to address them
607.326	myself, personally, in a few cases,
609.442	through nonprofits that I was involved with,
612.171	the more I found actually that the reality
615.109	is the opposite.
617.643	Business does not profit
618.889	from causing social problems,
620.591	actually not in any fundamental sense.
624.965	That's a very simplistic view.
627.158	The deeper we get into these issues,
629.866	the more we start to understand
631.711	that actually business profits
633.612	from solving from social problems.
635.608	That's where the real profit comes.
638.152	Let's take pollution.
640.993	We've learned today that actually
643.209	reducing pollution and emissions
645.616	is generating profit.
649.122	It saves money.
651.19	It makes the business more productive and efficient.
652.888	It doesn't waste resources.
654.285	Having a safer working environment actually,
656.928	and avoiding accidents,
658.416	it makes the business more profitable,
659.788	because it's a sign of good processes.
662.996	Accidents are expensive and costly.
667.027	Issue by issue by issue, we start to learn
669.631	that actually there's no trade-off
672.597	between social progress
676.193	and economic efficiency
679.194	in any fundamental sense.
681.287	Another issue is health.
682.646	I mean, what we've found is actually
685.215	health of employees is something
687.097	that business should treasure,
688.49	because that health allows those employees
690.818	to be more productive and come to work
692.227	and not be absent.
694.543	The deeper work, the new work, the new thinking
697.967	on the interface between business and social problems
702.151	is actually showing that there's a fundamental,
705.069	deep synergy,
706.988	particularly if you're not thinking in the very short run.
710.916	In the very short run, you can sometimes
712.754	fool yourself into thinking
714.855	that there's fundamentally opposing goals,
717.15	but in the long run, ultimately, we're learning
719.963	in field after field that this is simply not true.
724.159	So how could we tap into
727.449	the power of business
730.171	to address the fundamental problems
732.374	that we face?
734.807	Imagine if we could do that, because if we could do it,
737.407	we could scale.
739.447	We could tap into this enormous resource pool
741.856	and this organizational capacity.
744.754	And guess what? That's happening now, finally,
750.244	partly because of people like you
754.257	who have raised these issues now
756.205	for year after year and decade after decade.
759.32	We see organizations like Dow Chemical
761.728	leading the revolution away from trans fat
763.646	and saturated fat with innovative new products.
766.778	This is an example of Jain Irrigation.
768.731	This is a company that's brought drip irrigation technology
771.282	to thousands and millions of farmers,
773.951	reducing substantially the use of water.
777.002	We see companies like the Brazilian forestry company Fibria
780.323	that's figured out how to avoid
781.806	tearing down old growth forest
783.685	and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield
786.461	per hectare of pulp
788.451	and making much more paper than you could make
790.419	by cutting down those old trees.
792.528	You see companies like Cisco that are training
795.408	so far four million people in I.T. skills
799.564	to actually, yes, be responsible,
801.507	but help expand the opportunity
803.938	to disseminate I.T. technology
806.211	and grow the whole business.
807.513	There's a fundamental opportunity for business today
812.134	to impact and address these social problems,
816.19	and this opportunity
817.514	is the largest business opportunity
820.782	we see in business.
824.448	And the question is, how can we get business
826.654	thinking to adapt this issue of shared value?
830.082	This is what I call shared value:
831.891	addressing a social issue with a business model.
835.646	That's shared value.
837.57	Shared value is capitalism,
839.399	but it's a higher kind of capitalism.
841.961	It's capitalism as it was ultimately meant to be,
845.321	meeting important needs,
848.734	not incrementally competing for
851.557	trivial differences in product attributes
854.82	and market share.
856.553	Shared value is when we can create social value
858.772	and economic value simultaneously.
861.375	It's finding those opportunities
863.885	that will unleash the greatest possibility we have
866.95	to actually address these social problems
868.941	because we can scale.
870.974	We can address shared value at multiple levels.
874.53	It's real. It's happening.
877.695	But in order to get this solution working,
880.588	we have to now change how business sees itself,
884.716	and this is thankfully underway.
887.23	Businesses got trapped into the conventional wisdom
890.706	that they shouldn't worry about social problems,
892.554	that this was sort of something on the side,
894.596	that somebody else was doing it.
897.177	We're now seeing companies
898.753	embrace this idea.
901.229	But we also have to recognize business
903.418	is not going to do this as effectively
906.162	as if we have NGOs and government
908.022	working in partnership with business.
911.053	The new NGOs that are really moving the needle
914.061	are the ones that have found these partnerships,
916.244	that have found these ways to collaborate.
918.061	The governments that are making the most progress
920.534	are the governments that have found ways
922.148	to enable shared value in business
925.799	rather than see government as the only player
928.92	that has to call the shots.
931.934	And government has many ways in which it could impact
934.406	the willingness and the ability of companies
936.72	to compete in this way.
938.714	I think if we can get business seeing itself differently,
941.663	and if we can get others seeing business differently,
944.206	we can change the world.
947.011	I know it. I'm seeing it.
950.216	I'm feeling it.
952.166	Young people, I think,
953.861	my Harvard Business School students, are getting it.
957.041	If we can break down this sort of divide,
961.363	this unease, this tension,
964.373	this sense that we're not
966.303	fundamentally collaborating here
968.543	in driving these social problems,
970.893	we can break this down,
972.997	and we finally, I think,
974.997	can have solutions.
977.629	Thank you.
980.429	(Applause)
