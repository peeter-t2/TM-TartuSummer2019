12.899	Intelligence -- what is it?
16.566	If we take a look back at the history
18.857	of how intelligence has been viewed,
21.481	one seminal example has been
25.099	Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that
28.576	"""the question of whether a machine can think"
31.687	is about as interesting
32.997	as the question of whether a submarine
35.968	"can swim."""
37.758	Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,
41.602	intended it as a criticism
43.656	of the early pioneers of computer science,
46.656	like Alan Turing.
48.403	However, if you take a look back
50.902	and think about what have been
52.867	the most empowering innovations
54.863	that enabled us to build
56.742	artificial machines that swim
58.976	and artificial machines that [fly],
61.549	you find that it was only through understanding
65.096	the underlying physical mechanisms
67.704	of swimming and flight
70.483	that we were able to build these machines.
73.655	And so, several years ago,
75.911	I undertook a program to try to understand
79.16	the fundamental physical mechanisms
81.794	underlying intelligence.
84.562	Let's take a step back.
86.422	Let's first begin with a thought experiment.
89.571	Pretend that you're an alien race
92.425	that doesn't know anything about Earth biology
95.466	or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,
98.582	but you have amazing telescopes
100.774	and you're able to watch the Earth,
103.136	and you have amazingly long lives,
105.468	so you're able to watch the Earth
106.967	over millions, even billions of years.
110.409	And you observe a really strange effect.
113.424	You observe that, over the course of the millennia,
117.736	Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids
122.021	up until a point,
124.108	and that at some point,
125.639	corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,
129.831	asteroids that are on
131.547	a collision course with the Earth
133.478	that otherwise would have collided
135.453	mysteriously get deflected
137.868	or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.
140.94	Now of course, as earthlings,
143.023	we know the reason would be
144.567	that we're trying to save ourselves.
146.323	We're trying to prevent an impact.
149.403	But if you're an alien race
151.114	who doesn't know any of this,
152.26	doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,
154.774	you'd be forced to put together
156.502	a physical theory that explains how,
159.42	up until a certain point in time,
161.958	asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet
166.407	mysteriously stop doing that.
169.638	And so I claim that this is the same question
173.842	as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
177.84	So in this program that I
177.84	undertook several years ago,
181.722	I looked at a variety of different threads
184.487	across science, across a variety of disciplines,
187.649	that were pointing, I think,
189.541	towards a single, underlying mechanism
192.089	for intelligence.
193.67	In cosmology, for example,
196.216	there have been a variety of
196.216	different threads of evidence
198.963	that our universe appears to be finely tuned
202.37	for the development of intelligence,
204.523	and, in particular, for the development
206.912	of universal states
208.798	that maximize the diversity of possible futures.
212.896	In game play, for example, in Go --
215.24	everyone remembers in 1997
218.265	when IBM's Deep Blue beat 
218.265	Garry Kasparov at chess --
222.216	fewer people are aware
223.739	that in the past 10 years or so,
225.757	the game of Go,
226.955	arguably a much more challenging game
228.911	because it has a much higher branching factor,
231.336	has also started to succumb
233.038	to computer game players
234.903	for the same reason:
236.476	the best techniques right now
236.476	for computers playing Go
239.276	are techniques that try to maximize future options
242.972	during game play.
244.986	Finally, in robotic motion planning,
248.567	there have been a variety of recent techniques
250.749	that have tried to take advantage
252.651	of abilities of robots to maximize
255.797	future freedom of action
257.303	in order to accomplish complex tasks.
260.4	And so, taking all of these different threads
262.755	and putting them together,
264.377	I asked, starting several years ago,
267.017	is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence
269.867	that we can factor out
271.54	of all of these different threads?
273.314	Is there a single equation for intelligence?
277.907	And the answer, I believe, is yes.
277.907	"[""F = T ∇ Sτ""]"
281.278	What you're seeing is probably
283.191	the closest equivalent to an E = mc²
286.485	for intelligence that I've seen.
289.315	So what you're seeing here
291.017	is a statement of correspondence
293.686	that intelligence is a force, F,
298.121	that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
302.771	It acts to maximize future freedom of action,
305.146	or keep options open,
306.774	with some strength T,
308.999	with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,
313.776	up to some future time horizon, tau.
316.326	In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
319.535	Intelligence tries to maximize
319.535	future freedom of action
322.59	and keep options open.
325.263	And so, given this one equation,
327.696	it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
330.228	How predictive is it?
331.579	Does it predict human-level intelligence?
333.714	Does it predict artificial intelligence?
336.532	So I'm going to show you now a video
338.574	that will, I think, demonstrate
341.994	some of the amazing applications
344.282	of just this single equation.
346.601	(Video) Narrator: Recent research in cosmology
348.58	has suggested that universes that produce
350.627	"more disorder, or ""entropy,"" over their lifetimes"
354.108	should tend to have more favorable conditions
356.586	for the existence of intelligent
356.586	beings such as ourselves.
359.602	But what if that tentative cosmological connection
362.176	between entropy and intelligence
364.019	hints at a deeper relationship?
365.79	What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate
368.354	with the production of long-term entropy,
370.198	but actually emerges directly from it?
372.516	To find out, we developed a software engine
374.922	called Entropica, designed to maximize
377.425	the production of long-term entropy
379.193	of any system that it finds itself in.
381.769	Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass
383.924	multiple animal intelligence
383.924	tests, play human games,
387.38	and even earn money trading stocks,
389.526	all without being instructed to do so.
391.637	Here are some examples of Entropica in action.
394.155	Just like a human standing
394.155	upright without falling over,
397.36	here we see Entropica
398.59	automatically balancing a pole using a cart.
401.475	This behavior is remarkable in part
403.487	because we never gave Entropica a goal.
405.818	It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.
408.975	This balancing ability will have appliactions
411.107	for humanoid robotics
412.504	and human assistive technologies.
415.019	Just as some animals can use objects
417.02	in their environments as tools
418.462	to reach into narrow spaces,
420.449	here we see that Entropica,
422.331	again on its own initiative,
424.169	was able to move a large
424.169	disk representing an animal
427.079	around so as to cause a small disk,
429.424	representing a tool, to reach into a confined space
432.195	holding a third disk
433.732	and release the third disk
433.732	from its initially fixed position.
436.704	This tool use ability will have applications
438.893	for smart manufacturing and agriculture.
441.252	In addition, just as some other animals
443.196	are able to cooperate by pulling
443.196	opposite ends of a rope
445.892	at the same time to release food,
447.945	here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish
450.24	a model version of that task.
452.228	This cooperative ability has interesting implications
454.75	for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
458.185	Entropica is broadly applicable
460.256	to a variety of domains.
462.199	For example, here we see it successfully
464.641	playing a game of pong against itself,
467.2	illustrating its potential for gaming.
469.543	Here we see Entropica orchestrating
471.462	new connections on a social network
473.301	where friends are constantly falling out of touch
476.061	and successfully keeping
476.061	the network well connected.
478.917	This same network orchestration ability
481.215	also has applications in health care,
483.543	energy, and intelligence.
486.775	Here we see Entropica directing the paths
488.86	of a fleet of ships,
490.346	successfully discovering and
490.346	utilizing the Panama Canal
493.521	to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic
495.979	to the Pacific.
497.508	By the same token, Entropica
499.235	is broadly applicable to problems
500.855	in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
506.173	Finally, here we see Entropica
508.203	spontaneously discovering and executing
510.926	a buy-low, sell-high strategy
512.993	on a simulated range traded stock,
515.171	successfully growing assets under management
517.502	exponentially.
518.926	This risk management ability
520.234	will have broad applications in finance
522.721	and insurance.
526.049	Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen
528.14	is that a variety of signature human intelligent
532.532	cognitive behaviors
534.289	such as tool use and walking upright
537.12	and social cooperation
539.149	all follow from a single equation,
542.121	which drives a system
544.053	to maximize its future freedom of action.
547.964	Now, there's a profound irony here.
550.971	Going back to the beginning
552.995	of the usage of the term robot,
556.268	"the play ""RUR,"""
559.171	there was always a concept
561.406	that if we developed machine intelligence,
564.632	there would be a cybernetic revolt.
567.659	The machines would rise up against us.
571.21	One major consequence of this work
573.529	is that maybe all of these decades,
576.298	we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt
579.274	in reverse.
581.285	It's not that machines first become intelligent
584.564	and then megalomaniacal
586.579	and try to take over the world.
588.803	It's quite the opposite,
590.237	that the urge to take control
593.143	of all possible futures
595.404	is a more fundamental principle
597.522	than that of intelligence,
598.885	that general intelligence may in fact emerge
602.585	directly from this sort of control-grabbing,
606.144	rather than vice versa.
610.329	Another important consequence is goal seeking.
614.098	I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals
618.458	follow from this sort of framework?
620.078	And the answer is, the ability to seek goals
623.106	will follow directly from this
624.988	in the following sense:
626.822	just like you would travel through a tunnel,
629.687	a bottleneck in your future path space,
632.192	in order to achieve many other
634.063	diverse objectives later on,
636.084	or just like you would invest
638.456	in a financial security,
640.243	reducing your short-term liquidity
642.48	in order to increase your wealth over the long term,
644.88	goal seeking emerges directly
647.217	from a long-term drive
648.946	to increase future freedom of action.
652.983	Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,
656.511	once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed
660.183	and you could pass only a single concept
662.076	on to our descendants
663.447	to help them rebuild civilization,
665.754	that concept should be
667.44	that all matter around us
669.292	is made out of tiny elements
671.615	that attract each other when they're far apart
674.123	but repel each other when they're close together.
677.453	My equivalent of that statement
679.234	to pass on to descendants
680.502	to help them build artificial intelligences
683.214	or to help them understand human intelligence,
686.163	is the following:
687.43	Intelligence should be viewed
689.483	as a physical process
690.896	that tries to maximize future freedom of action
693.861	and avoid constraints in its own future.
697.477	Thank you very much.
698.835	(Applause)
