12.71	Take a look at this drawing.
14.579	Can you tell what it is?
16.183	I'm a molecular biologist by training,
18.93	and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.
21.533	They're usually referred to as a model figure,
24.625	a drawing that shows how we think
26.359	a cellular or molecular process occurs.
29.023	This particular drawing is of a process
31.522	called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
35.845	It's a process by which a molecule can get
38.455	from the outside of the cell to the inside
40.693	by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle
43.23	that then gets internalized by the cell.
46.05	There's a problem with this drawing, though,
47.885	and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.
50.517	From lots of experiments,
51.982	from lots of different scientists,
53.817	we know a lot about what these molecules look like,
56.813	how they move around in the cell,
58.495	and that this is all taking place
60.32	in an incredibly dynamic environment.
63.31	So in collaboration with a clathrin
63.31	expert Tomas Kirchhausen,
66.783	we decided to create a new kind of model figure
69.102	that showed all of that.
71.126	So we start outside of the cell.
72.862	Now we're looking inside.
74.51	Clathrin are these three-legged molecules
76.59	that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.
79.878	Through connections with a membrane,
81.575	clathrin is able to deform the membrane
83.742	and form this sort of a cup
85.155	that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,
87.462	that's now capturing some of the proteins
89.246	that were outside of the cell.
90.9	Proteins are coming in now that
90.9	basically pinch off this vesicle,
94.398	making it separate from the rest of the membrane,
96.982	and now clathrin is basically done with its job,
99.374	and so proteins are coming in now —
100.612	we've covered them yellow and orange —
102.558	that are responsible for taking
102.558	apart this clathrin cage.
105.1	And so all of these proteins
105.1	can get basically recycled
108.382	and used all over again.
109.918	These processes are too small to be seen directly,
113.327	even with the best microscopes,
115.159	so animations like this provide a really powerful way
117.79	of visualizing a hypothesis.
120.808	Here's another illustration,
122.654	and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think
125.39	that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.
128.895	And again, this is a vast oversimplification
131.414	and doesn't begin to show
133.158	what we actually know about these processes.
135.64	You might be surprised to know
137.855	that these simple drawings are the only way
140.622	that most biologists visualize
140.622	their molecular hypotheses.
144.454	Why?
145.482	Because creating movies of processes
147.472	as we think they actually occur is really hard.
150.486	I spent months in Hollywood
150.486	learning 3D animation software,
154.119	and I spend months on each animation,
156.4	and that's just time that most
156.4	researchers can't afford.
159.75	The payoffs can be huge, though.
161.95	Molecular animations are unparalleled
164.334	in their ability to convey a great deal of information
167.775	to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.
171.367	And I'm working on a new project now
172.87	"called ""The Science of HIV"""
174.308	where I'll be animating the entire life cycle
176.67	of the HIV virus as accurately as possible
179.774	and all in molecular detail.
181.735	The animation will feature data
183.886	from thousands of researchers
183.886	collected over decades,
186.862	data on what this virus looks like,
189.942	how it's able to infect cells in our body,
193.03	and how therapeutics are
193.03	helping to combat infection.
197.002	Over the years, I found that animations
199.331	aren't just useful for communicating an idea,
202.15	but they're also really useful
203.646	for exploring a hypothesis.
205.958	Biologists for the most part are
205.958	still using a paper and pencil
209.152	to visualize the processes they study,
211.374	and with the data we have now,
211.374	that's just not good enough anymore.
214.854	The process of creating an animation
217.27	can act as a catalyst that allows researchers
219.927	to crystalize and refine their own ideas.
222.878	One researcher I worked with
224.662	who works on the molecular mechanisms
226.438	of neurodegenerative diseases
228.222	came up with experiments that were related
230.2	directly to the animation that
230.2	she and I worked on together,
233.183	and in this way, animation can
233.183	feed back into the research process.
237.304	I believe that animation can change biology.
240.157	It can change the way that we
240.157	communicate with one another,
242.725	how we explore our data
244.348	and how we teach our students.
245.675	But for that change to happen,
247.129	we need more researchers creating animations,
250.286	and toward that end, I brought together a team
252.541	of biologists, animators and programmers
255.678	to create a new, free, open-source software —
258.725	we call it Molecular Flipbook —
260.629	that's created just for biologists
262.525	just to create molecular animations.
266.07	From our testing, we've found
266.07	that it only takes 15 minutes
269.782	for a biologist who has never
269.782	touched animation software before
273.05	to create her first molecular animation
275.786	of her own hypothesis.
277.308	We're also building an online database
279.458	where anyone can view, download and contribute
282.233	their own animations.
283.849	We're really excited to announce
285.82	that the beta version of the molecular animation
288.282	software toolkit will be available for download today.
292.49	We are really excited to see
292.49	what biologists will create with it
295.233	and what new insights they're able to gain
297.289	from finally being able to animate
298.77	their own model figures.
300.473	Thank you.
