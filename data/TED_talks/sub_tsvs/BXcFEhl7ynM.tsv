12.834	Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.
18.026	AI researchers have always said
20.193	that we humans do not need to worry,
22.811	because only menial jobs
22.811	will be taken over by machines.
27.094	Is that really true?
30.185	They have also said
30.185	that AI will create new jobs,
34.036	so those who lose their jobs
34.036	will find a new one.
38.084	Of course.
39.463	But the real question is:
41.659	How many of those
41.659	who may lose their jobs to AI
45.788	will be able to land a new one,
48.301	especially when AI is smart enough
48.301	to learn better than most of us?
55.217	Let me ask you a question:
58.486	How many of you think
60.308	that AI will pass the entrance examination
60.308	of a top university by 2020?
67.656	Oh, so many. OK.
70.137	"So some of you may say, ""Of course, yes!"""
75.189	Now singularity is the issue.
78.41	"And some others may say, ""Maybe,"
81.529	because AI already won
81.529	"against a top Go player."""
87.033	"And others may say, ""No, never. Uh-uh."""
92.015	That means we do not know
92.015	the answer yet, right?
96.088	So that was the reason why
96.088	I started Todai Robot Project,
101.072	making an AI which passes
101.072	the entrance examination
104.968	of the University of Tokyo,
107.581	the top university in Japan.
111.284	This is our Todai Robot.
115.951	And, of course, the brain of the robot
115.951	is working in the remote server.
122.567	It is now writing a 600-word essay
126.813	on maritime trade in the 17th century.
130.956	How does that sound?
133.933	Why did I take the entrance exam
133.933	as its benchmark?
138.918	Because I thought we had to study
138.918	the performance of AI
143.683	in comparison to humans,
145.821	especially on the skills and expertise
148.705	which are believed
148.705	to be acquired only by humans
152.817	and only through education.
155.602	To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,
159.669	you have to pass
159.669	two different types of exams.
164.114	The first one is
164.114	a national standardized test
167.898	in multiple-choice style.
170.325	You have to take seven subjects
172.804	and achieve a high score --
174.783	I would say like an 84 percent
174.783	or more accuracy rate --
179.579	to be allowed to take
179.579	the second stage written test
183.69	prepared by Todai.
186.814	So let me first explain
186.814	how modern AI works,
192.155	"taking the ""Jeopardy!"" challenge"
192.155	as an example.
197.359	"Here is a typical ""Jeopardy!"" question:"
200.462	"""Mozart's last symphony"
200.462	"shares its name with this planet."""
206.015	"Interestingly, a ""Jeopardy!"""
206.015	question always asks,
210.052	"always ends with ""this"" something:"
213.404	"""this"" planet, ""this"" country,"
216.255	"""this"" rock musician, and so on."
218.887	"In other words, ""Jeopardy!"" doesn't ask"
218.887	many different types of questions,
223.21	but a single type,
225.071	"which we call ""factoid questions."""
228.795	By the way, do you know the answer?
233.8	If you do not know the answer
233.8	and if you want to know the answer,
237.879	what would you do?
239.98	You Google, right? Of course.
243.136	Why not?
244.64	But you have to pick appropriate keywords
248.256	"like ""Mozart,"" ""last"""
248.256	"and ""symphony"" to search."
253.282	The machine basically does the same.
256.277	Then this Wikipedia page
256.277	will be ranked top.
261.66	Then the machine reads the page.
263.592	No, uh-uh.
265.29	Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,
268.776	including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,
272.768	is able to read.
275.257	But they are very good
275.257	at searching and optimizing.
279.978	It will recognize
282.686	"that the keywords ""Mozart,"""
282.686	"""last"" and ""symphony"""
285.645	are appearing heavily around here.
289.61	So if it can find a word which is a planet
294.009	and which is co-occurring
294.009	with these keywords,
297.681	that must be the answer.
300.582	This is how Watson finds
300.582	"the answer ""Jupiter,"" in this case."
308.253	Our Todai Robot works similarly,
308.253	but a bit smarter
312.326	in answering history yes-no questions,
316.38	"like, ""'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'"
316.38	"Is this sentence true or false?"""
323.001	Our robot starts producing
323.001	a factoid question,
327.098	"like: ""Charlemagne repelled"
327.098	"[this person type]"" by itself."
332.815	"Then, ""Avars"" but not"
332.815	"""Magyars"" is ranked top."
338.177	This sentence is likely to be false.
342.592	Our robot does not read,
342.592	does not understand,
348.155	but it is statistically
348.155	correct in many cases.
353.967	For the second stage written test,
356.499	it is required to write
356.499	a 600-word essay like this one:
361.629	[Discuss the rise and fall
361.629	of the maritime trade
363.931	in East and Southeast Asia
363.931	in the 17th century ...]
366.377	and as I have shown earlier,
367.788	our robot took the sentences
367.788	from the textbooks and Wikipedia,
372.006	combined them together,
373.991	and optimized it to produce an essay
377.634	without understanding a thing.
379.865	(Laughter)
381.626	But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay
386.545	than most of the students.
388.13	(Laughter)
390.545	How about mathematics?
393.174	A fully automatic math-solving machine
396.356	has been a dream
398.011	since the birth of the word
398.011	"""artificial intelligence,"""
403.605	but it has stayed at the level
403.605	of arithmetic for a long, long time.
411.35	Last year, we finally succeeded
411.35	in developing a system
416.724	which solved pre-university-level
416.724	problems from end to end,
421.921	like this one.
425.468	This is the original problem
425.468	written in Japanese,
429.494	and we had to teach it
429.494	2,000 mathematical axioms
433.915	and 8,000 Japanese words
436.713	to make it accept the problems
436.713	written in natural language.
442.054	And it is now translating
442.054	the original problems
445.62	into machine-readable formulas.
450.398	Weird, but it is now ready
450.398	to solve it, I think.
456.521	Go and solve it.
458.638	Yes! It is now executing
458.638	symbolic computation.
463.85	Even more weird,
465.454	but probably this is the most
465.454	fun part for the machine.
470.303	(Laughter)
472.678	Now it outputs a perfect answer,
475.517	though its proof is impossible to read,
475.517	even for mathematicians.
482.593	Anyway, last year our robot
482.593	was among the top one percent
490.019	in the second stage written
490.019	exam in mathematics.
494.472	(Applause)
498.232	Thank you.
499.567	So, did it enter Todai?
502.801	No, not as I expected.
506.603	Why?
508.026	Because it doesn't understand any meaning.
512.128	Let me show you a typical error
512.128	it made in the English test.
516.231	[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.
516.231	Just a few more minutes.
519.232	Sunil: Wait. ______ .
519.232	Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]
522.295	Two people are talking.
523.47	For us, who can understand
523.47	the situation --
525.524	"[1. ""We walked for a long time."""
525.524	"2. ""We're almost there."""
528.321	"3. ""Your shoes look expensive."""
528.321	"4. ""Your shoelace is untied.""]"
531.377	it is obvious number four
531.377	is the correct answer, right?
534.274	But Todai Robot chose number two,
536.536	even after learning 15 billion
536.536	English sentences
541.92	using deep learning technologies.
547.42	OK, so now you might
547.42	understand what I said:
552.219	modern AIs do not read,
554.891	do not understand.
557.336	They only disguise as if they do.
564.687	This is the distribution graph
567.692	of half a million students
567.692	who took the same exam as Todai Robot.
574.378	Now our Todai Robot
574.378	is among the top 20 percent,
580.806	and it was capable to pass
583.245	more than 60 percent
583.245	of the universities in Japan --
587.21	but not Todai.
589.936	But see how it is beyond the volume zone
593.985	of to-be white-collar workers.
599.88	You might think I was delighted.
603.759	After all, my robot was surpassing
603.759	students everywhere.
608.842	Instead, I was alarmed.
612.906	How on earth could this unintelligent
612.906	machine outperform students --
618.537	our children?
619.853	Right?
621.921	I decided to investigate
621.921	what was going on in the human world.
628.362	I took hundreds of sentences
628.362	from high school textbooks
633.679	and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,
637.016	and asked thousands
637.016	of high school students to answer.
642.51	Here is an example:
643.71	[Buddhism spread to ... ,
643.71	Christianity to ... and Oceania,
646.552	and Islam to ...]
647.727	Of course, the original problems
647.727	are written in Japanese,
650.491	their mother tongue.
651.67	[ ______ has spread to Oceania.
653.209	1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
653.209	3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]
655.65	Obviously, Christianity
655.65	is the answer, isn't it?
657.973	It's written!
661.302	And Todai Robot chose
661.302	the correct answer, too.
666.578	But one-third of junior
666.578	high school students
671.481	failed to answer this question.
676.276	Do you think it is only the case in Japan?
679.459	I do not think so,
681.459	because Japan is always ranked
681.459	among the top in OECD PISA tests,
687.854	measuring 15-year-old
687.854	students' performance in mathematics,
691.805	science and reading
693.793	every three years.
699.21	We have been believing
701.287	that everybody can learn
703.354	and learn well,
705.283	as long as we provide
705.283	good learning materials
709.004	free on the web
710.483	so that they can access
710.483	through the internet.
713.576	But such wonderful materials
713.576	may benefit only those who can read well,
720.354	and the percentage
720.354	of those who can read well
724.313	may be much less than we expected.
729.86	How we humans will coexist with AI
734.125	is something we have
734.125	to think about carefully,
737.671	based on solid evidence.
740.883	At the same time,
740.883	we have to think in a hurry
744.884	because time is running out.
747.926	Thank you.
749.446	(Applause)
754.031	Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.
756.135	Noriko Arai: Thank you.
757.924	CA: In your talk, you so beautifully
757.924	give us a sense of how AIs think,
763.252	what they can do amazingly
764.84	and what they can't do.
766.559	But -- do I read you right,
768.077	that you think we really need
768.077	quite an urgent revolution in education
773.371	to help kids do the things
773.371	that humans can do better than AIs?
777.55	NA: Yes, yes, yes.
778.902	Because we humans
778.902	can understand the meaning.
782.961	That is something
782.961	which is very, very lacking in AI.
787.891	But most of the students
787.891	just pack the knowledge
792.283	without understanding
792.283	the meaning of the knowledge,
796.21	so that is not knowledge,
796.21	that is just memorizing,
799.043	and AI can do the same thing.
801.517	So we have to think about
801.517	a new type of education.
805.172	CA: A shift from knowledge,
805.172	rote knowledge, to meaning.
808.485	NA: Mm-hmm.
809.66	CA: Well, there's a challenge
809.66	for the educators. Thank you so much.
812.924	NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.
814.646	(Applause)
