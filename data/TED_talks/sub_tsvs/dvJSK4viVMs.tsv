13.64	This is a story about capitalism.
16.779	It's a system I love
18.567	because of the successes and opportunities
18.567	it's afforded me and millions of others.
23.791	I started in my 20s trading commodities,
23.791	cotton in particular, in the pits,
30.056	and if there was ever a free market
30.056	free-for-all, this was it,
33.682	where men wearing ties 
33.682	but acting like gladiators
37.3	fought literally 
37.3	and physically for a profit.
41.437	Fortunately, I was good enough
41.437	that by the time I was 30,
44.36	I was able to move into the upstairs 
44.36	world of money management,
48.02	where I spent the next three decades
48.02	as a global macro trader.
51.572	And over that time, I've seen
51.572	a lot of crazy things in the markets,
54.846	and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.
59.529	And unfortunately,
61.638	I'm sad to report that right now 
61.638	we might be in the grips
64.938	of one of the most disastrous,
64.938	certainly of my career,
68.894	and one consistent takeaway is
68.894	manias never end well.
72.775	Now, over the past 50 years,
75.581	we as a society have come to view
75.581	our companies and corporations
81.432	in a very narrow, almost
81.432	monomaniacal fashion
86.988	with regard to how we value them,
90.255	and we have put
90.255	so much emphasis on profits,
93.924	on short-term quarterly
93.924	earnings and share prices,
96.71	at the exclusion of all else.
99.55	It's like we've ripped the humanity
99.55	out of our companies.
104.319	Now, we don't do that --
104.319	conveniently reduce something
108.313	to a set of numbers that you
108.313	can play with like Lego toys --
111.521	we don't do that in our individual life.
113.869	We don't treat somebody or value them
117.072	based on their monthly income 
117.072	or their credit score,
121.213	but we have this double standard
123.02	when it comes to the way
123.02	that we value our businesses,
125.565	and you know what?
127.05	It's threatening the very
127.05	underpinnings of our society.
130.215	And here's how you'll see.
131.817	This chart is corporate profit margins
131.817	going back 40 years
136.322	as a percentage of revenues,
138.4	and you can see that we're
138.4	at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.
142.707	Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,
146.259	but if you're the other side of that,
146.259	and you're the average American worker,
150.526	then you can see it's not
150.526	such a good thing.
153.833	"[""U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs."
153.833	"CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio""]"
157.41	Now, higher profit margins
157.41	do not increase societal wealth.
160.527	What they actually do is they
160.527	exacerbate income inequality,
165.766	and that's not a good thing.
168.166	But intuitively, that makes sense, right?
170.627	Because if the top 10 percent
170.627	of American families
174.25	own 90 percent of the stocks,
176.61	as they take a greater share
176.61	of corporate profits,
179.571	then there's less wealth left
179.571	for the rest of society.
183.514	Again, income inequality
183.514	is not a good thing.
186.3	This next chart,
186.3	made by The Equality Trust,
188.761	shows 21 countries from Austria
188.761	to Japan to New Zealand.
193.614	On the horizontal axis
193.614	is income inequality.
196.818	The further to the right you go,
196.818	the greater the income inequality.
200.116	On the vertical axis
200.116	are nine social and health metrics.
203.459	The more you go up that,
203.459	the worse the problems are,
206.222	and those metrics include life expectancy,
206.222	teenage pregnancy, literacy,
211.47	social mobility, just to name a few.
214.21	Now, those of you in the audience
214.21	who are Americans may wonder,
217.391	well, where does the United States rank?
219.736	Where does it lie on that chart?
221.593	And guess what?
223.288	We're literally off the chart.
225.97	Yes, that's us,
227.793	with the greatest income inequality
229.952	and the greatest social problems,
229.952	according to those metrics.
234.248	Now, here's a macro forecast
234.248	that's easy to make,
236.802	and that's, that gap between
236.802	the wealthiest and the poorest,
240.401	it will get closed.
242.421	History always does it.
244.01	It typically happens in one of three ways:
246.159	either through revolution,
246.159	higher taxes, or wars.
252.56	None of those are on my bucket list.
254.889	(Laughter)
256.025	Now, there's another way to do it,
258.086	and that's by increasing justness
258.086	in corporate behavior,
262.226	but the way that we're
262.226	operating right now,
264.989	that would require
264.989	a tremendous change in behavior,
268.983	and like an addict trying to kick a habit,
272.93	the first step is to acknowledge
272.93	that you have a problem.
276.436	And let me just say,
276.436	this profits mania that we're on
280.337	is so deeply entrenched
282.636	that we don't even realize
282.636	how we're harming society.
285.167	Here's a small but startling example
285.167	of exactly how we're doing that:
289.184	this chart shows corporate giving
292.247	as a percentage of profits, 
292.247	not revenues, over the last 30 years.
297.632	Juxtapose that to the earlier chart
297.632	of corporate profit margins,
303.401	and I ask you, does that feel right?
308.758	In all fairness, when I
308.758	started writing this, I thought,
311.699	"""Oh wow, what does my company,"
311.699	"what does Tudor do?"""
314.16	And I realized we give one percent
314.16	of corporate profits
319.693	to charity every year.
321.423	And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.
325.324	When I realized that, I literally
325.324	wanted to throw up.
331.623	But the point is, this mania
331.623	is so deeply entrenched
334.101	that well-intentioned people like myself
334.101	don't even realize that we're part of it.
339.943	Now, we're not going
339.943	to change corporate behavior
342.274	by simply increasing corporate
342.274	philanthropy or charitable contributions.
347.591	And oh, by the way,
347.591	we've since quadrupled that,
350.725	but -- (Applause) -- Please.
354.974	But we can do it by driving
354.974	more just behavior.
358.713	And one way to do it is actually trusting
361.754	the system that got us
361.754	here in the first place,
364.169	and that's the free market system.
366.282	About a year ago,
366.282	some friends of mine and I
368.975	started a not-for-profit
368.975	called Just Capital.
372.025	Its mission is very simple:
373.493	to help companies and corporations
375.988	learn how to operate in a more just
375.988	fashion by using the public's input
381.263	to define exactly what the criteria are
381.263	for just corporate behavior.
387.574	Now, right now, there's
387.574	no widely accepted standard
389.989	that a company or corporation can follow,
389.989	and that's where Just Capital comes in,
394.331	because beginning this year and every year
394.331	we'll be conducting a nationwide survey
399.651	of a representative sample
399.651	of 20,000 Americans
403.781	to find out exactly what they think
406.701	are the criteria for justness
406.701	in corporate behavior.
410.579	Now, this is a model that's going
410.579	to start in the United States
413.591	but can be expanded
413.591	anywhere around the globe,
416.226	and maybe we'll find out
418.107	that the most important
418.107	thing for the public
420.975	is that we create living wage jobs,
420.975	or make healthy products,
426.326	or help, not harm, the environment.
429.577	At Just Capital, we don't know,
429.577	and it's not for us to decide.
433.85	We're but messengers,
435.846	but we have 100 percent confidence 
435.846	and faith in the American public
439.956	to get it right.
441.88	So we'll release the findings
441.88	this September for the first time,
445.41	and then next year, we'll poll again,
447.85	and we'll take the additive step this time
450.149	of ranking the 1,000
450.149	largest U.S. companies
453.168	from number one to number 1,000
453.168	and everything in between.
457.72	We're calling it the Just Index,
460.551	and remember, we're an independent
460.551	not-for-profit with no bias,
465.8	and we will be giving
465.8	the American public a voice.
470.953	And maybe over time, we'll find out
470.953	that as people come to know
475.156	which companies are the most just,
477.176	human and economic resources
477.176	will be driven towards them,
481.216	and they'll become the most prosperous
483.19	and help our country
483.19	be the most prosperous.
487.351	Now, capitalism has been responsible
487.351	for every major innovation
491.457	that's made this world a more inspiring
491.457	and wonderful place to live in.
496.578	Capitalism has to be based on justice.
499.443	It has to be, and now more than ever,
501.649	with economic divisions
501.649	growing wider every day.
505.48	It's estimated that 47 percent
505.48	of American workers
508.498	can be displaced in the next 20 years.
511.796	I'm not against progress.
513.769	I want the driverless car and the jet pack
513.769	just like everyone else.
518.65	But I'm pleading for recognition
518.65	that with increased wealth and profits
524.5	has to come greater
524.5	corporate social responsibility.
529.93	"""If justice is removed,"" said Adam Smith,"
529.93	the father of capitalism,
535.665	"""the great, the immense fabric"
535.665	of human society must in a moment
541.419	"crumble into atoms."""
545.626	Now, when I was young,
545.626	and there was a problem,
549.39	my mama used to always
549.39	sigh and shake her head and say,
553.573	"""Have mercy, have mercy."""
557.63	Now's not the time for us,
557.63	for the rest of us to show them mercy.
562.181	The time is now for us
562.181	to show them fairness,
565.37	and we can do that, you and I,
567.846	by starting where we work,
567.846	in the businesses that we operate in.
573.1	And when we put justness
573.1	on par with profits,
576.46	we'll get the most wonderful thing
576.46	in all the world.
580.408	We'll take back our humanity.
583.774	Thank you.
586.421	(Applause)
