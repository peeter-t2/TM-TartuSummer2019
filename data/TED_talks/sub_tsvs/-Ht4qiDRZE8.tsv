15.26	How many of you had to fill out a web form
17.284	where you've been asked to read
18.82	a distorted sequence
18.82	of characters like this?
20.98	How many of you found it really annoying?
22.957	(Laughter)
24.08	OK, outstanding. So I invented that.
25.84	(Laughter)
27.7	Or I was one of the people who did it.
29.58	That thing is called a CAPTCHA.
31.14	And it is there to make sure
31.14	you, the entity filling out the form,
34.3	are a human and not a computer program
36.18	that was written to submit
36.18	the form millions of times.
38.78	The reason it works is because humans,
38.78	at least non-visually-impaired humans,
42.46	have no trouble reading
42.46	these distorted characters,
44.9	whereas programs can't do it as well yet.
46.9	In the case of Ticketmaster,
48.42	the reason you have
48.42	to type these characters
50.54	is to prevent scalpers
50.54	from writing a program
52.7	that can buy millions
52.7	of tickets, two at a time.
54.98	CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.
56.94	And since they're used so often,
58.54	a lot of times the sequence
58.54	of random characters shown to the user
61.7	is not so fortunate.
62.94	So this is an example
62.94	from the Yahoo registration page.
65.62	The random characters
65.62	that happened to be shown to the user
68.46	were W, A, I, T,
68.46	which, of course, spell a word.
71.18	But the best part is the message
73.3	that the Yahoo help desk
73.3	got about 20 minutes later.
75.78	[Help! I've been waiting
75.78	for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]
78.94	(Laughter)
83.82	This person thought they needed to wait.
85.749	This, of course,
85.749	is not as bad as this poor person.
88.18	(Laughter)
90.58	CAPTCHA Project is something that we did
90.58	at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,
94.34	and it's been used everywhere.
95.82	Let me now tell you about a project
95.82	that we did a few years later,
98.98	which is sort of
98.98	the next evolution of CAPTCHA.
101.22	This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,
103.22	which is something that we started
103.22	here at Carnegie Mellon,
106.02	then we turned it into a start-up company.
108.052	And then about a year and a half ago,
108.052	Google actually acquired this company.
111.664	Let me tell you what this project started.
113.695	This project started
113.695	from the following realization:
116.25	It turns out that approximately
118.711	are typed everyday
118.711	by people around the world.
120.886	When I first heard this,
120.886	I was quite proud of myself.
123.394	I thought, look at the impact
123.394	my research has had.
125.759	But then I started feeling bad.
127.267	Here's the thing:
127.267	each time you type a CAPTCHA,
129.497	essentially, you waste
131.86	And if you multiply that by 200 million,
133.82	you get that humanity is wasting
133.82	about 500,000 hours every day
136.86	typing these annoying CAPTCHAs.
138.42	(Laughter)
139.46	So then I started feeling bad.
140.913	(Laughter)
142.74	And then I started thinking, of course,
142.74	we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,
146.26	because the security of the web
146.26	depends on them.
148.54	But then I started thinking,
148.54	can we use this effort
150.98	for something that is good for humanity?
152.94	So see, here's the thing.
154.46	While you're typing a CAPTCHA,
154.46	during those 10 seconds,
157.1	your brain is doing something amazing.
158.98	Your brain is doing something
158.98	that computers cannot yet do.
161.82	So can we get you to do useful work
161.82	for those 10 seconds?
164.54	Is there some humongous problem
164.54	that we cannot yet get computers to solve,
168.06	yet we can split
168.06	into tiny 10-second chunks
170.86	such that each time
170.86	somebody solves a CAPTCHA,
173.06	they solve a little bit of this problem?
175.02	"And the answer to that is ""yes,"""
175.02	and this is what we're doing now.
178.18	Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,
180.14	not only are you authenticating
180.14	yourself as a human,
182.593	but in addition you're helping us
182.593	to digitize books.
185.06	Let me explain how this works.
186.54	There's a lot of projects
186.54	trying to digitize books.
188.98	Google has one.
188.98	The Internet Archive has one.
191.14	Amazon, with the Kindle,
191.14	is trying to digitize books.
193.66	Basically, the way this works
193.66	is you start with an old book.
196.86	You've seen those things, right?
198.46	Like a book?
199.7	(Laughter)
200.98	So you start with a book
200.98	and then you scan it.
203.54	Now, scanning a book
204.78	is like taking a digital
204.78	photograph of every page.
207.18	It gives you an image for every page.
209.02	This is an image with text
209.02	for every page of the book.
211.62	The next step in the process
211.62	is that the computer needs to be able
214.78	to decipher the words in this image.
216.54	That's using a technology called OCR,
216.54	for optical character recognition,
219.98	which takes a picture of text
221.42	and tries to figure out
221.42	what text is in there.
223.62	Now, the problem
223.62	is that OCR is not perfect.
226.3	Especially for older books
227.74	where the ink has faded
227.74	and the pages have turned yellow,
230.9	OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.
232.86	For things that were written
232.86	more than 50 years ago,
235.34	the computer cannot recognize
235.34	about 30 percent of the words.
238.22	So now we're taking all of the words
238.22	that the computer cannot recognize
241.62	and we're getting people
241.62	to read them for us
243.9	while they're typing
243.9	a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
246.14	So the next time you type a CAPTCHA,
246.14	these words that you're typing
249.34	are actually words from books
249.34	that are being digitized
251.94	that the computer could not recognize.
253.82	The reason we have
253.82	two words nowadays instead of one
256.3	is because one of the words
257.74	is a word that the system
257.74	just got out of a book,
260.34	it didn't know what it was
260.34	and it's going to present it to you.
263.38	But since it doesn't know the answer,
263.38	it cannot grade it.
266.1	So we give you another word,
267.5	for which the system does know the answer.
269.524	We don't tell you which one's which
269.524	and we say, please type both.
272.62	And if you type the correct word
274.219	for the one for which
274.219	the system knows the answer,
276.62	it assumes you are human
277.9	and it also gets some confidence
277.9	that you typed the other word correctly.
281.38	And if we repeat this process
281.38	to 10 different people
283.86	and they agree on what the new word is,
285.78	then we get one more word
285.78	digitized accurately.
288.02	So this is how the system works.
289.62	And since we released it
289.62	about three or four years ago,
292.26	a lot of websites have started
292.26	switching from the old CAPTCHA,
295.22	where people wasted their time,
296.78	to the new CAPTCHA where people
296.78	are helping to digitize books.
299.74	So every time you buy
299.74	tickets on Ticketmaster,
301.94	you help to digitize a book.
303.34	Facebook: Every time
303.34	you add a friend or poke somebody,
305.98	you help to digitize a book.
307.38	Twitter and about 350,000 other sites
307.38	are all using reCAPTCHA.
310.34	And the number of sites
310.34	that are using reCAPTCHA is so high
313.18	that the number of words
313.18	we're digitizing per day is really large.
316.34	It's about 100 million a day,
317.78	which is the equivalent of about
317.78	two and a half million books a year.
321.3	And this is all being done
321.3	one word at a time
323.46	by just people typing
323.46	CAPTCHAs on the Internet.
325.7	(Applause)
332.94	Now, of course,
334.18	since we're doing so many words per day,
337.54	funny things can happen.
338.82	This is especially true
338.82	because now we're giving people
341.46	two randomly chosen English words
341.46	next to each other.
343.98	So funny things can happen.
345.34	For example, we presented this word.
347.1	"It's the word ""Christians"";"
347.1	there's nothing wrong with it.
349.86	But if you present it along
349.86	with another randomly chosen word,
352.82	bad things can happen.
354.18	So we get this.
355.42	[bad Christians]
356.66	But it's even worse, because
356.66	the website where we showed this
359.58	actually happened to be called
359.58	The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.
362.66	(Laughter)
364.38	Oops.
365.62	(Laughter)
369.5	Here's another really bad one.
371.22	JohnEdwards.com
372.54	[Damn liberal]
373.78	(Laughter)
378.3	So we keep on insulting people
378.3	left and right everyday.
381.14	Of course, we're not
381.14	just insulting people.
383.18	Here's the thing. Since we're presenting
383.18	two randomly chosen words,
386.38	interesting things can happen.
387.86	So this actually has given rise
387.86	to a really big Internet meme
392.5	that tens of thousands of people
392.5	have participated in,
395.06	which is called CAPTCHA art.
396.74	I'm sure some of you have heard about it.
398.74	Here's how it works.
400.02	Imagine you're using the Internet
400.02	and you see a CAPTCHA
402.66	that you think is somewhat peculiar,
404.42	like this CAPTCHA.
405.66	[invisible toaster]
406.9	What you're supposed to do
406.9	is you take a screenshot of it.
409.66	Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA
409.66	because you help us digitize a book.
413.34	But first you take a screenshot
414.86	and then you draw something
414.86	that is related to it.
417.26	(Laughter)
418.98	That's how it works.
420.22	(Laughter)
421.58	There are tens of thousands of these.
424.26	Some of them are very cute.
426.356	[clenched it]
427.593	(Laughter)
429.46	Some of them are funnier.
431.02	[stoned Founders]
432.26	(Laughter)
436.66	And some of them,
436.66	like paleontological shvisle ...
440.113	(Laughter)
442.06	they contain Snoop Dogg.
443.3	(Laughter)
446.46	OK, so this is my favorite
446.46	number of reCAPTCHA.
449.06	So this is the favorite thing
449.06	that I like about this whole project.
452.26	This is the number of distinct people
454.1	that have helped us digitize at least
454.1	one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:
	of the world's population,
460.94	has helped us digitize human knowledge.
462.86	And it is numbers like these
462.86	that motivate my research agenda.
465.98	So the question that motivates
465.98	my research is the following:
469.06	If you look at humanity's
469.06	large-scale achievements,
471.5	these really big things
472.74	that humanity has gotten together
472.74	and done historically --
475.479	like, for example,
475.479	building the pyramids of Egypt
477.98	or the Panama Canal
479.58	or putting a man on the Moon --
481.66	there is a curious fact about them,
483.38	and it is that they were all done
483.38	with about the same number of people.
486.74	It's weird; they were all done
486.74	with about 100,000 people.
489.46	And the reason for that is because,
489.46	before the Internet,
492.14	coordinating more than 100,000 people,
494.02	let alone paying them,
494.02	was essentially impossible.
497.06	But now with the Internet,
497.06	I've just shown you a project
499.74	where we've gotten 750 million people
499.74	to help us digitize human knowledge.
503.26	So the question
503.26	that motivates my research is,
505.46	if we can put a man
505.46	on the Moon with 100,000,
507.62	what can we do with 100 million?
509.82	So based on this question,
511.1	we've had a lot of different projects
511.1	that we've been working on.
514.18	Let me tell you about one
514.18	that I'm most excited about.
516.74	This is something that we've been
516.74	semiquietly working on
519.42	for the last year and a half or so.
521.14	It hasn't yet been launched.
521.14	It's called Duolingo.
523.54	Since it hasn't been launched, shhh!
525.3	(Laughter)
526.98	Yeah, I can trust you'll do that.
529.26	So this is the project.
529.26	Here's how it started.
531.5	It started with me posing a question
531.5	to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.
535.1	OK, that's Severin Hacker.
537.299	So I posed the question
537.299	to my graduate student.
539.54	By the way, you did hear me correctly;
539.54	his last name is Hacker.
542.54	(Laughter)
543.58	So I posed this question to him:
543.58	How can we get 100 million people
546.9	translating the web
546.9	into every major language for free?
550.5	There's a lot of things
550.5	to say about this question.
552.94	First of all, translating the web.
554.62	Right now, the web
554.62	is partitioned into multiple languages.
557.44	A large fraction of it is in English.
559.28	If you don't know English,
559.28	you can't access it.
561.52	But there's large fractions
561.52	in other different languages,
564.24	and if you don't know them,
564.24	you can't access it.
566.52	So I would like to translate
566.52	all of the web,
568.64	or at least most of it,
568.64	into every major language.
571.04	That's what I would like to do.
572.56	Now, some of you may say,
572.56	why can't we use computers to translate?
577.06	Machine translation
577.06	is starting to translate
579.18	some sentences here and there.
580.66	Why can't we use it to translate the web?
582.66	The problem with that
582.66	is it's not yet good enough
585.02	and it probably won't be
585.02	for the next 15 to 20 years.
587.54	It makes a lot of mistakes.
587.54	Even when it doesn't,
589.9	since it makes so many mistakes,
589.9	you don't know whether to trust it or not.
593.5	So let me show you an example
594.94	of something that was
594.94	translated with a machine.
597.22	Actually, it was a forum post.
598.7	It was somebody who was trying
598.7	to ask a question about JavaScript.
601.9	It was translated
601.9	from Japanese into English.
604.54	So I'll just let you read.
606.34	This person starts apologizing
608.14	for the fact that
608.14	it's translated with a computer.
610.62	So the next sentence is going to be
610.62	the preamble to the question.
614.42	So he's just explaining something.
616.1	Remember, it's a question
616.1	about JavaScript.
618.18	[At often, the goat-time
618.18	install a error is vomit.]
620.82	(Laughter)
625.94	Then comes the first part of the question.
629.5	[How many times like the wind,
629.5	a pole, and the dragon?]
632.46	(Laughter)
637.14	Then comes my favorite part
637.14	of the question.
639.22	[This insult to father's stones?]
641.18	(Laughter)
645.06	And then comes the ending,
646.38	which is my favorite part
646.38	of the whole thing.
648.54	[Please apologize for your stupidity.
648.54	There are a many thank you.]
651.7	(Laughter)
653.9	OK, so computer translation,
653.9	not yet good enough.
656.86	So back to the question.
658.14	So we need people
658.14	to translate the whole web.
661.14	So now the next question you may have is,
663.14	well, why can't we just
663.14	pay people to do this?
665.34	We could pay professional translators
665.34	to translate the whole web.
668.46	We could do that.
669.74	Unfortunately, it would be
669.74	extremely expensive.
671.98	For example, translating a tiny fraction
671.98	of the whole web, Wikipedia,
675.26	into one other language, Spanish.
677.78	OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,
679.78	but it's very small
679.78	compared to the size of English.
682.26	It's about 20 percent
682.26	of the size of English.
684.46	If we wanted to translate
684.46	the other 80 percent into Spanish,
687.34	it would cost at least
689.5	and this is even at the most exploited,
689.5	outsourcing country out there.
693.18	So it would be very expensive.
694.66	So what we want to do is,
694.66	we want to get 100 million people
697.446	translating the web
697.446	into every major language for free.
700.06	If this is what you want to do,
700.06	you quickly realize
702.5	you're going to run
702.5	into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.
705.46	The first one is a lack of bilinguals.
708.78	So I don't even know
710.98	if there exists 100 million people
710.98	out there using the web
713.74	who are bilingual enough
713.74	to help us translate.
716.06	That's a big problem.
717.3	The other problem you're going to run into
717.3	is a lack of motivation.
720.5	How are we going to motivate people
720.5	to actually translate the web for free?
724.06	Normally, you have to pay
724.06	people to do this.
726.38	So how are we going to motivate them
726.38	to do it for free?
729.02	When we were starting to think about this,
729.02	we were blocked by these two things.
732.78	But then we realized, there's a way
734.5	to solve both these problems
734.5	with the same solution.
736.98	To kill two birds with one stone.
738.62	And that is to transform
738.62	language translation
740.78	into something that millions
740.78	of people want to do
743.62	and that also helps
743.62	with the problem of lack of bilinguals,
746.78	and that is language education.
749.18	So it turns out that today,
751.18	there are over 1.2 billion people
751.18	learning a foreign language.
755.3	People really want
755.3	to learn a foreign language.
757.54	And it's not just because
757.54	they're being forced to do so in school.
760.7	In the US alone,
760.7	there are over five million people
763.14	who have paid over $500
763.14	for software to learn a new language.
766.06	So people really want
766.06	to learn a new language.
768.26	So what we've been working on
768.26	for the last year and a half
771.02	is a new website --
771.02	it's called Duolingo --
773.1	where the basic idea is
773.1	people learn a new language for free
775.98	while simultaneously translating the web.
778.06	And so basically,
778.06	they're learning by doing.
780.62	So the way this works
781.86	is whenever you're a just a beginner,
781.86	we give you very simple sentences.
785.3	There's a lot of very simple
785.3	sentences on the web.
787.7	We give you very simple sentences
787.7	along with what each word means.
790.94	And as you translate them
792.3	and as you see how other people
792.3	translate them,
794.54	you start learning the language.
796.14	And as you get more advanced,
797.58	we give you more complex
797.58	sentences to translate.
799.86	But at all times,
799.86	you're learning by doing.
801.9	Now, the crazy thing about this method
801.9	is that it actually really works.
805.62	People are really learning a language.
807.5	We're mostly done building it
807.5	and now we're testing it.
810.14	People really can
810.14	learn a language with it.
812.22	And they learn it about as well
812.22	as the leading language learning software.
815.74	So people really do learn a language.
817.58	And not only do they learn it as well,
817.58	but actually it's more interesting.
821.1	Because with Duolingo,
821.1	people are learning with real content.
824.02	As opposed to learning
824.02	with made-up sentences,
826.22	people are learning with real content,
826.22	which is inherently interesting.
829.58	So people really do learn a language.
831.42	But perhaps more surprisingly,
833.06	the translations that we get
833.06	from people using the site,
835.82	even though they're just beginners,
837.62	the translations that we get
839.02	are as accurate as those
839.02	of professional language translators,
841.98	which is very surprising.
843.22	So let me show you one example.
844.78	This is a sentence that was translated
844.78	from German into English.
847.82	The top is the German.
847.82	The middle is an English translation
850.62	that was done by a professional translator
852.9	who we paid 20 cents a word
852.9	for this translation.
855.3	And the bottom is a translation
855.3	by users of Duolingo,
858.02	none of whom knew any German
858.02	before they started using the site.
861.78	If you can see, it's pretty much perfect.
863.78	Of course, we play a trick here
865.34	to make the translations as good
865.34	as professional language translators.
868.7	We combine the translations
868.7	of multiple beginners
871.06	to get the quality
871.06	of a single professional translator.
873.98	Now, even though
873.98	we're combining the translations,
878.54	the site actually
878.54	can translate pretty fast.
881.34	So let me show you,
882.58	this is our estimates
882.58	of how fast we could translate Wikipedia
885.54	from English into Spanish.
886.86	Remember, this is
889.86	So if we wanted to translate
889.86	Wikipedia into Spanish,
892.34	we could do it in five weeks
892.34	with 100,000 active users.
895.06	And we could do it in about 80 hours
895.06	with a million active users.
898.14	Since all the projects
898.14	my group has worked on so far
900.62	have gotten millions of users,
902.1	we're hopeful that we'll be able
902.1	to translate extremely fast.
905.02	Now, the thing that
905.02	I'm most excited about with Duolingo
908.02	is I think this provides a fair
908.02	business model for language education.
911.78	So here's the thing:
913.02	The current business model
913.02	for language education
915.38	is the student pays,
916.78	and in particular, the student
916.78	pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.
919.86	(Laughter)
921.7	That's the current business model.
923.38	The problem with this business model
925.14	is that 95 percent of the world's
925.14	population doesn't have 500 dollars.
928.46	So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.
931.26	This is totally biased towards the rich.
933.22	Now, see, in Duolingo,
934.86	because while you learn,
934.86	you're actually creating value,
938.54	you're translating stuff --
939.9	which, for example, we could
939.9	charge somebody for translations,
942.86	so this is how we could monetize this.
944.74	Since people are creating value
944.74	while they're learning,
947.38	they don't have to pay with their money,
947.38	they pay with their time.
950.5	But the magical thing here
952.447	is that is time that would have had
952.447	to have been spent anyways
955.467	learning the language.
956.7	So the nice thing about Duolingo
958.3	is, I think, it provides
958.3	a fair business model --
960.66	one that doesn't discriminate
960.66	against poor people.
963.06	So here's the site. Thank you.
964.54	(Applause)
973.06	We haven't yet launched,
975.5	but if you go there, you can sign up
975.5	to be part of our private beta,
978.82	which is probably going to start
978.82	in three or four weeks.
981.5	We haven't yet launched it.
982.86	By the way, I'm the one talking here,
984.7	but Duolingo is the work
984.7	of a really awesome team,
987.1	some of whom are here. So thank you.
988.86	(Applause)
