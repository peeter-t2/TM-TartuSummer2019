12.564	So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?
17.65	Not very many of you.
19.59	Okay. And actually of those hands,
21.586	if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?
24.619	So a couple.
26.076	That's okay.
26.979	That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive --
29.454	that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving.
32.325	So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,
36.327	whether you're eight or 80.
38.579	And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,
41.303	because you have to build a small, portable robot
44.036	that's not only really affordable,
46.412	but it has to be something
47.953	that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.
51.94	This robot can't be creepy or uncanny.
55.237	He should be friendly and cute.
57.448	So meet Romo.
60.359	Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love --
64.216	your iPhone -- as his brain.
67.065	And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,
71.176	we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled
75.627	and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,
79.311	which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.
84.243	When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.
87.86	So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.
92.977	If I duck down, he'll follow me.
94.476	He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.
96.802	If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.
100.078	If I come over here -- (Laughs)
104.279	He's smart.
105.662	And if I get too close to him,
107.876	he gets scared just like any other creature.
111.009	So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.
114.459	Thanks, little guy.
116.352	(Sneezing sound)
117.734	Bless you.
119.825	And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired --
124.443	if I want to explore the world with Romo,
126.458	I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.
129.392	So here's the iPad.
130.952	And Romo will actually stream video to this device.
133.693	So I can see everything that Romo sees,
135.326	and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.
137.358	Now this is a free app on the App Store,
138.794	so if any of you guys had this app on your phones,
140.516	we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.
144.243	So I'll show you really quickly,
145.925	Romo actually -- he's streaming video,
147.771	so you can see me and the entire TED audience.
149.961	If I get in front of Romo here.
151.493	And if I want to control him, I can just drive.
154.534	So I can drive him around,
158.986	and I can take pictures of you.
160.912	I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.
163.317	So I'll snap a picture.
164.819	And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad,
167.379	I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device.
170.969	So there are all of you through Romo's eyes.
175.7	And finally, because Romo is an extension of me,
178.786	I can express myself through his emotions.
180.804	So I can go in and I can say let's make Romo excited.
186.07	But the most important thing about Romo
187.453	is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive.
192.543	You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo.
195.127	In fact, who would like to drive a robot?
198.095	Okay. Awesome.
200.627	Here you go.
202.261	Thank you, Scott.
205.115	And even cooler, you actually don't have to be
207.869	in the same geographic location as the robot to control him.
212.276	So he actually streams two-way audio and video
215.561	between any two smart devices.
217.202	So you can log in through the browser,
219.01	and it's kind of like Skype on wheels.
220.494	So we were talking before about telepresence,
222.228	and this is a really cool example.
223.66	You can imagine an eight-year-old girl, for example, who has an iPhone,
227.977	and her mom buys her a robot.
229.494	That girl can take her iPhone, put it on the robot,
232.395	send an email to Grandma, who lives on the other side of the country.
235.024	Grandma can log into that robot and play hide-and-go-seek with her granddaughter
238.378	for fifteen minutes every single night,
240.702	when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year.
244.013	Thanks, Scott.
245.545	(Applause)
251.229	So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today.
254.576	But I just want to finish by talking about something that we're working on in the future.
258.536	This is actually something that one of our engineers, Dom, built in a weekend.
262.061	It's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly.
265.429	This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code
269.525	and create any behavior for this robot you want.
271.704	You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo.
274.485	And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser,
277.345	which is what you see Romo doing on the left.
279.315	And then if you have something you like,
280.666	you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life,
283.761	run the program in real life.
285.245	And then if you have something you're proud of,
286.952	you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world.
290.493	So all of these wi-fiâ€“enabled robots actually learn from each other.
293.619	The reason we're so focused on building robots that everyone can train
297.929	is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal.
302.518	They change from person to person.
305.124	So we think that if you're going to have a robot in your home,
307.54	that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination.
311.691	So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like.
315.543	To be honest, I have no idea.
318.027	But what we do know is that it isn't 10 years or 10 billion dollars
323.13	or a large humanoid robot away.
326.457	The future of personal robotics is happening today,
329.458	and it's going to depend on small, agile robots like Romo
333.041	and the creativity of people like yourselves.
336.036	So we can't wait to get you all robots,
338.218	and we can't wait to see what you build.
339.946	Thank you.
341.128	(Applause)
