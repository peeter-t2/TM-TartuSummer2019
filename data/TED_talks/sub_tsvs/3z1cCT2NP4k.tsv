15.26	The substance of things unseen.
18.26	Cities, past and future.
21.26	In Oxford, perhaps
21.26	we can use Lewis Carroll
25.26	and look in the looking glass
25.26	that is New York City
28.26	to try and see our true selves,
31.26	or perhaps pass through to another world.
34.26	Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,
37.26	"""As the moon rose higher,"
39.26	the inessential houses began to melt away
42.26	until gradually I became
42.26	aware of the old island
44.26	here that once flowered
44.26	for Dutch sailors' eyes,
47.26	"a fresh green breast of the new world."""
50.26	My colleagues and I
50.26	have been working for 10 years
52.26	to rediscover this lost world
55.26	in a project we call
55.26	The Mannahatta Project.
58.26	We're trying to discover
58.26	what Henry Hudson would have seen
60.26	on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,
63.26	when he sailed into New York harbor.
66.26	And I'd like to tell you
66.26	the story in three acts,
68.26	and if I have time still, an epilogue.
71.26	So, Act I: A Map Found.
73.26	So, I didn't grow up in New York.
75.26	I grew up out west in the
75.26	Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,
78.26	in the Red Rock Canyon.
80.26	And from these early
80.26	experiences as a child
82.26	I learned to love landscapes.
84.26	And so when it became time
84.26	for me to do my graduate studies,
86.26	I studied this emerging field
86.26	of landscape ecology.
90.26	Landscape ecology concerns itself
92.26	with how the stream and the meadow
92.26	and the forest and the cliffs
96.26	make habitats for plants and animals.
98.26	This experience and this training
100.26	lead me to get a wonderful job
100.26	with the Wildlife Conservation Society,
103.26	which works to save wildlife
103.26	and wild places all over the world.
106.26	And over the last decade,
108.26	I traveled to over 40 countries
110.26	to see jaguars and bears and elephants
112.26	and tigers and rhinos.
114.26	But every time I would return
114.26	from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
117.26	And on my weekends I would go up,
117.26	just like all the other tourists,
120.26	to the top of the Empire State Building,
122.26	and I'd look down on this landscape,
122.26	on these ecosystems,
125.26	"and I'd wonder, ""How does this landscape"
127.26	work to make habitat
127.26	for plants and animals?
129.26	How does it work to make habitat
129.26	"for animals like me?"""
133.26	I'd go to Times Square and I'd look
133.26	at the amazing ladies on the wall,
137.26	and wonder why nobody is looking
137.26	at the historical figures just behind them.
142.26	I'd go to Central Park and see
142.26	the rolling topography of Central Park
145.26	come up against the abrupt and sheer
147.26	topography of midtown Manhattan.
151.26	I started reading about the history
151.26	and the geography in New York City.
154.26	I read that New York City
154.26	was the first mega-city,
156.26	a city of 10 million people
156.26	or more, in 1950.
160.26	I started seeing paintings like this.
162.26	For those of you who are from New York,
164.26	this is 125th street
164.26	under the West Side Highway.
167.26	(Laughter)
169.26	It was once a beach.
169.26	And this painting
171.26	has John James Audubon,
171.26	the painter, sitting on the rock.
174.26	And it's looking up on the wooded heights
174.26	of Washington Heights
176.26	to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George
176.26	Washington Bridge goes across today.
180.26	Or this painting, from the 1740s,
180.26	from Greenwich Village.
183.26	Those are two students at King's College --
183.26	later Columbia University --
186.26	sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
189.26	And so I'd go down to Greenwich
189.26	Village and I'd look for this hill,
192.26	and I couldn't find it.
192.26	And I couldn't find that palm tree.
195.26	What's that palm tree doing there?
197.26	(Laughter)
198.26	So, it was in the course of these investigations
198.26	that I ran into a map.
201.26	And it's this map you see here.
203.26	It's held in a geographic information system
205.26	which allows me to zoom in.
207.26	This map isn't from Hudson's time,
207.26	but from the American Revolution,
	British military cartographers
214.26	during the occupation of New York City.
216.26	And it's a remarkable map.
216.26	It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
220.26	And it's 10 feet long and
220.26	three and a half feet wide.
222.26	And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan
225.26	you can see the extent
225.26	of New York City as it was,
227.26	right at the end of the American Revolution.
229.26	Here's Bowling Green.
229.26	And here's Broadway.
232.26	And this is City Hall Park.
234.26	So the city basically extended
234.26	to City Hall Park.
237.26	And just beyond it you can see features
239.26	that have vanished,
239.26	things that have disappeared.
241.26	This is the Collect Pond, which was
241.26	the fresh water source for New York City
244.26	for its first 200 years,
246.26	and for the Native Americans
246.26	for thousands of years before that.
249.26	You can see the Lispenard Meadows
251.26	draining down through here,
251.26	through what is TriBeCa now,
253.26	and the beaches that
253.26	come up from the Battery,
255.26	all the way to 42nd St.
257.26	This map was made for military reasons.
260.26	They're mapping the roads,
260.26	the buildings, these fortifications
262.26	that they built.
264.26	But they're also mapping
264.26	things of ecological interest,
266.26	also military interest: the hills,
268.26	the marshes, the streams.
271.26	This is Richmond Hill,
271.26	and Minetta Water,
273.26	which used to run its way
273.26	through Greenwich Village.
276.26	Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
281.26	Or Murray Hill.
281.26	And this is the Murrays' house
283.26	on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
286.26	Here is Times Square,
289.26	the two streams that came
289.26	together to make a wetland
291.26	in Times Square, as it was
291.26	at the end of the American Revolution.
296.26	So I saw this remarkable map in a book.
298.26	"And I thought to myself, ""You know,"
298.26	if I could georeference this map,
302.26	if I could place this map
302.26	in the grid of the city today,
305.26	I could find these lost features
307.26	of the city,
309.26	in the block-by-block
309.26	geography that people know,
312.26	the geography of where people
312.26	go to work, and where they go to live,
315.26	"and where they like to eat."""
317.26	So, after some work
317.26	we were able to georeference it,
319.26	which allows us to put
319.26	the modern streets on the city,
322.26	and the buildings, and the open spaces,
327.26	so that we can zoom in
327.26	to where the Collect Pond is.
332.26	We can digitize the Collect
332.26	Pond and the streams,
336.26	and see where they actually are
336.26	in the geography of the city today.
341.26	So this is fun
341.26	for finding where things are
344.26	relative to the old topography.
349.26	But I had another idea about this map.
351.26	If we take away the streets,
351.26	and if we take away the buildings,
354.26	and if we take away the open spaces,
356.26	then we could take this map.
358.26	If we pull off the 18th century features
360.26	we could drive it back in time.
362.26	We could drive it back
362.26	to its ecological fundamentals:
366.26	to the hills, to the streams,
368.26	to the basic hydrology
368.26	and shoreline, to the beaches,
372.26	the basic aspects that
372.26	make the ecological landscape.
376.26	Then, if we added maps
376.26	like the geology, the bedrock geology,
379.26	and the surface geology,
379.26	what the glaciers leave,
382.26	if we make the soil map,
384.26	with the 17 soil classes,
387.26	that are defined by
387.26	the National Conservation Service,
390.26	if we make a digital elevation model
392.26	of the topography
392.26	that tells us how high the hills were,
395.26	then we can calculate the slopes.
398.26	We can calculate the aspect.
401.26	We can calculate the
401.26	winter wind exposure --
403.26	so, which way the winter
403.26	winds blow across the landscape.
405.26	The white areas on this map
405.26	are the places protected from the winter winds.
410.26	We compiled all the information
410.26	about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.
413.26	And we built a probability map
413.26	of where they might have been.
417.26	So, the red areas
417.26	on this map indicate the places
419.26	that are best for human
419.26	sustainability on Manhattan,
421.26	places that are close to water,
423.26	places that are near the harbor to fish,
425.26	places protected from the winter winds.
430.26	We know that there was a Lenape settlement
432.26	down here by the Collect Pond.
435.26	And we knew that they
435.26	planted a kind of horticulture,
437.26	that they grew these beautiful gardens
437.26	of corn, beans, and squash,
440.26	"the ""Three Sisters"" garden."
442.26	So, we built a model that explains
442.26	where those fields might have been.
446.26	And the old fields, the successional fields that go.
448.26	And we might think of these as abandoned.
450.26	But, in fact, they're grassland habitats
452.26	for grassland birds and plants.
454.26	And they have become
454.26	successional shrub lands,
457.26	and these then mix in
457.26	to a map of all the ecological communities.
461.26	And it turns out that Manhattan
461.26	had 55 different ecosystem types.
465.26	You can think of these as neighborhoods,
467.26	as distinctive as TriBeCa
467.26	and the Upper East Side and Inwood --
472.26	that these are the forest and the wetlands
474.26	and the marine communities, the beaches.
477.26	And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,
480.26	Manhattan had more ecological communities
482.26	per acre than Yosemite does,
484.26	than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
487.26	It was really an extraordinary landscape
489.26	that was capable of supporting
489.26	an extraordinary biodiversity.
493.26	So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
497.26	So, we studied the fish and the frogs
497.26	and the birds and the bees,
501.26	the 85 different kinds of fish
501.26	that were on Manhattan,
504.26	the Heath hens, the species
504.26	that aren't there anymore,
508.26	the beavers on all the streams,
508.26	the black bears,
511.26	and the Native Americans,
511.26	to study how they used
514.26	and thought about their landscape.
516.26	We wanted to try and map these.
516.26	And to do that what we did
519.26	was we mapped their habitat needs.
521.26	Where do they get their food?
523.26	Where do they get their water?
523.26	Where do they get their shelter?
525.26	Where do they get their
525.26	reproductive resources?
528.26	To an ecologist, the intersection
528.26	of these is habitat,
531.26	but to most people,
531.26	the intersection of these is their home.
536.26	So, we would read in field guides,
536.26	the standard field guides
538.26	that maybe you have on your shelves,
540.26	you know, what beavers need is,
540.26	"""A slowly meandering stream"
542.26	with aspen trees and alders and willows,
545.26	"near the water."""
545.26	That's the best thing for a beaver.
547.26	So we just started making a list.
549.26	Here is the beaver.
549.26	And here is the stream,
551.26	and the aspen and the alder
551.26	and the willow.
553.26	As if these were the maps
553.26	that we would need
555.26	to predict where you would find the beaver.
557.26	Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows
557.26	and insects and sunny places.
561.26	Or the bobcat, needing rabbits
561.26	and beavers and den sites.
565.26	And rapidly we started to realize
565.26	that beavers can be
568.26	something that a bobcat needs.
571.26	But a beaver also needs things.
571.26	And that having it
573.26	on either side means that
573.26	we can link it together,
575.26	that we can create the network
577.26	of the habitat relationships
577.26	for these species.
580.26	Moreover, we realized
580.26	that you can start out
582.26	as being a beaver specialist,
584.26	but you can look up what an aspen needs.
586.26	An aspen needs fire and dry soils.
589.26	And you can look at
589.26	what a wet meadow needs.
592.26	And it need beavers
592.26	to create the wetlands,
594.26	and maybe some other things.
596.26	But you can also talk
596.26	about sunny places.
598.26	So, what does a sunny place need?
598.26	Not habitat per se.
601.26	But what are the conditions
601.26	that make it possible?
603.26	Or fire. Or dry soils.
606.26	And that you can put these
606.26	on a grid that's 1,000 columns long
609.26	across the top and 1,000 rows
609.26	down the other way.
612.26	And then we can visualize
612.26	this data like a network,
615.26	like a social network.
617.26	And this is the network
617.26	of all the habitat relationships
619.26	of all the plants and animals
619.26	on Manhattan,
621.26	and everything they needed,
623.26	going back to the geology,
625.26	going back to time and space
625.26	at the very core of the web.
628.26	We call this the Muir Web.
628.26	And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
631.26	Each point is a different species
633.26	or a different stream
633.26	or a different soil type.
636.26	And those little gray lines are the connections
636.26	that connect them together.
639.26	They are the connections
639.26	that actually make nature resilient.
642.26	And the structure of this
642.26	is what makes nature work,
646.26	seen with all its parts.
648.26	We call these Muir Webs
648.26	after the Scottish-American naturalist
651.26	"John Muir, who said, ""When we try"
651.26	to pick out anything by itself,
654.26	we find that it's bound fast
654.26	by a thousand invisible cords
657.26	that cannot be broken,
657.26	"to everything in the universe."""
661.26	So then we took the Muir webs
661.26	and we took them back to the maps.
664.26	So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,
666.26	and Lex and Third,
668.26	maybe there was a stream in that block.
670.26	And these would be the kind of trees
670.26	that might have been there,
672.26	and the flowers and the lichens
672.26	and the mosses,
676.26	the butterflies, the fish in the stream,
679.26	the birds in the trees.
681.26	Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
683.26	And perhaps a black bear walked by.
683.26	And maybe Native Americans were there.
686.26	And then we took this data.
688.26	You can see this for yourself
688.26	on our website.
690.26	You can zoom into
690.26	any block on Manhattan,
692.26	and see what might have
692.26	been there 400 years ago.
695.26	And we used it to try
695.26	and reveal a landscape
698.26	here in Act III.
700.26	We used the tools they use in Hollywood
702.26	to make these fantastic landscapes
702.26	that we all see in the movies.
705.26	And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
708.26	So we would take the landscape
708.26	and we would build up the topography.
712.26	We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,
712.26	and illuminate the landscape.
716.26	We would lay on top of that
716.26	the map of the ecological communities.
719.26	And feed into that the map of the species.
722.26	So that we would actually take a photograph,
724.26	flying above Times Square,
724.26	looking toward the Hudson River,
726.26	waiting for Hudson to come.
728.26	Using this technology, we can make these
730.26	fantastic georeferenced views.
732.26	We can basically take a picture
732.26	out of any window
734.26	on Manhattan and see what that landscape
734.26	looked like 400 years ago.
737.26	This is the view from the East River,
737.26	looking up Murray Hill
740.26	at where the United Nations is today.
743.26	This is the view looking
743.26	down the Hudson River,
745.26	with Manhattan on the left,
745.26	and New Jersey out on the right,
748.26	looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
751.26	This is the view over Times Square,
753.26	with the beaver pond there,
753.26	looking out toward the east.
757.26	So we can see the Collect Pond,
757.26	and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
761.26	We can see the fields
761.26	that the Native Americans made.
764.26	And we can see this
764.26	in the geography of the city today.
768.26	"So when you're watching ""Law and Order,"""
768.26	and the lawyers walk up the steps
771.26	they could have walked
771.26	back down those steps
773.26	of the New York Court House,
773.26	right into the Collect Pond,
779.26	So these images are the work
779.26	of my friend and colleague,
782.26	Mark Boyer, who is here
782.26	in the audience today.
784.26	And I'd just like, if you would
784.26	give him a hand,
786.26	to call out for his fine work.
789.26	(Applause)
798.26	There is such power in bringing
798.26	science and visualization together,
801.26	that we can create images like this,
803.26	perhaps looking on either
803.26	side of a looking glass.
806.26	And even though I've only
806.26	had a brief time to speak,
808.26	I hope you appreciate that
808.26	Mannahatta was a very special place.
811.26	The place that you see here
811.26	on the left side
814.26	was interconnected.
814.26	It was based on this diversity.
816.26	It had this resilience that is
816.26	what we need in our modern world.
821.26	But I wouldn't have you think
821.26	that I don't like the place
824.26	on the right, which I quite do.
824.26	I've come to love the city
827.26	and its kind of diversity,
827.26	and its resilience,
829.26	and its dependence on density
829.26	and how we're connected together.
834.26	In fact, that I see them
834.26	as reflections of each other,
838.26	much as Lewis Carroll did
838.26	"in ""Through the Looking Glass."""
841.26	We can compare these two and hold them
841.26	in our minds at the same time,
845.26	that they really are the same place,
847.26	that there is no way that cities
847.26	can escape from nature.
850.26	And I think this is what we're learning
850.26	about building cities in the future.
854.26	So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,
854.26	not about the past,
857.26	but about 400 years from now,
859.26	what we're realizing is that
861.26	cities are habitats for people,
863.26	and need to supply what people need:
865.26	a sense of home, food, water, shelter,
868.26	reproductive resources,
868.26	and a sense of meaning.
872.26	This is the particular additional
872.26	habitat requirement of humanity.
875.26	And so many of the talks here
875.26	at TED are about meaning,
878.26	about bringing meaning to our lives
880.26	in all kinds of different ways, through technology,
882.26	through art, through science,
884.26	so much so that I think
884.26	we focus so much on
887.26	that side of our lives,
887.26	that we haven't given enough
889.26	attention to the food and the water
889.26	and the shelter,
892.26	and what we need to raise the kids.
895.26	So, how can we envision
895.26	the city of the future?
898.26	Well, what if we go
898.26	to Madison Square Park,
900.26	and we imagine it without all the cars,
903.26	and bicycles instead
905.26	and large forests, and streams instead
905.26	of sewers and storm drains?
910.26	What if we imagined the Upper East Side
912.26	with green roofs, and streams
912.26	winding through the city,
916.26	and windmills supplying
916.26	the power we need?
919.26	Or if we imagine the New York
919.26	City metropolitan area,
922.26	currently home to 12 million people,
924.26	but 12 million people in the future,
924.26	perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,
928.26	in only 36 percent of the area,
930.26	with the areas in between
930.26	covered by farmland,
933.26	covered by wetlands,
935.26	covered by the marshes we need.
937.26	This is the kind of future I think we need,
940.26	is a future that has the same diversity
943.26	and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,
946.26	but that learns from the
946.26	sustainability of the past,
949.26	of the ecology, the original ecology,
949.26	of nature with all its parts.
954.26	Thank you very much.
