13.016	Fresh out of college,
14.393	I went to work for a consulting firm.
16.968	During orientation,
16.968	the leaders dished out advice.
21.107	Amongst them was one pithy counsel
21.107	I will never forget.
25.189	"He told us, ""Be easy to manage."""
28.515	Considering how naïve
28.515	I really was at the time,
32.328	I took his advice to heart.
34.119	I told myself,
35.638	"""Yes, I will be the ultimate team player."
38.518	I will do everything I'm told.
40.485	"I will be easy to manage."""
43.478	It wasn't until I arrived
43.478	in graduate school
45.86	and witnessed firsthand the criminal
45.86	actions of scientists and engineers
50.8	in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan
53.553	that I realized how dangerous
53.553	and yet surprisingly common
58.135	this line of thinking really is.
60.518	Make no mistake:
61.709	the Flint water crisis is one of the most
61.709	egregious environmental injustices
66.375	of our time.
67.55	For over 18 months,
	including thousands of young children,
73.236	were exposed to contaminated
73.236	drinking water with high levels of lead.
77.86	Lead is a potent neurotoxin
79.76	which causes cognitive
79.76	and developmental disabilities
83.524	and is especially harmful
83.524	to growing fetuses and young children.
88.277	We've known about its dangers
88.277	since the Roman Empire.
92.619	Amongst a whole host of health issues,
	Legionnaires' disease.
99.361	Flint's water infrastructure --
101.187	the complex network
101.187	of underground pipes --
104.292	has been severely damaged.
106.936	And while the water quality
106.936	is slowly improving
110.12	and the pipes are being replaced now,
112.195	more than two years later,
113.919	the water is still not safe to drink.
118.096	So, people are still in shock.
121.005	They ask themselves,
122.337	"""How could this have happened?"""
124.903	The short answer is: the crisis began
124.903	when an emergency manager,
129.714	appointed by Michigan's governor,
132.163	decided to switch their water source
132.163	to a local river to save money.
137.147	But it continued for so long
139.066	because scientists and engineers
139.066	at government agencies
142.727	in the state of Michigan
142.727	and in the federal government
145.806	did not follow federal regulations
145.806	for treating the water right.
150.741	What was more,
151.963	they actively cheated on the law
151.963	and orchestrated cover-ups.
155.865	They ridiculed residents asking for help,
158.82	while publicly insisting that the brown,
158.82	smelly water coming out of the tap
163.304	was safe to drink.
165.568	The system at the local, state
165.568	and federal levels completely failed
171.257	to protect our most vulnerable,
173.273	and an entire population
173.273	was left to fend for itself.
178.02	Now, amidst this injustice,
178.02	Flint residents were rallying together.
182.804	Amongst them were some
182.804	amazing women of Flint --
185.959	mothers concerned about their kids --
187.984	who came together forming
187.984	many grassroots coalitions,
191.901	and these groups started protesting
191.901	and demanding change.
196.308	The group also reached out
196.308	to outside scientists for help,
200.07	and a few responded.
202.291	Amongst them was a guy
202.291	named Miguel Del Toral,
205.803	a water expert at the US EPA --
205.803	the Environmental Protection Agency --
210.505	who actually wrote this scientific memo
213.092	and sent it to the state of Michigan
213.092	and the federal government
216.256	to bring their attention to this problem.
219.101	"He was characterized a ""rogue employee,"""
221.691	and silenced.
224.542	In collaboration with Flint residents,
227.358	our research team here at Tech,
229.716	of students and scientists
229.716	led by professor Marc Edwards,
233.002	conducted citywide testing
235.164	to prove that Flint's water
235.164	was indeed contaminated,
238.196	even toxic in some homes.
241.355	We substantiated what Flint
241.355	had been screaming for months,
244.518	and put it on the Internet
244.518	for the world to see.
247.69	Now, when I was getting involved,
250.692	when I said yes to this,
252.11	I had no idea what I was getting into.
255.277	But every second of this journey
255.277	has been totally worth it.
259	This was science
259	in service to the public.
261.789	This is what I came
261.789	to graduate school for,
264.342	and this is how I would rather
264.342	spend my life.
267.7	And so this coalition --
269.738	this unlikely coalition of citizens,
269.738	pastors, journalists and scientists --
274.655	came together to uncover the truth
274.655	using science, advocacy and activism.
279.505	A local pediatrician figured out
281.662	that the instances of childhood
281.662	lead poisoning had indeed doubled
286.025	in Flint during the crisis.
288.944	And the state of Michigan was forced
288.944	to acknowledge the problem
292.655	and take steps to correct it.
295.199	This group and many others
295.199	got Flint's kids protected.
299.826	A few months later,
301.02	President Obama came in
301.02	and declared a federal emergency,
304.513	and now Flint is getting
304.513	more than 600 million dollars
308.045	in healthcare, nutrition, education
311.468	and overhauling
311.468	their water infrastructure.
314.95	However, the arrogance and the callous
314.95	disregard for public health
320.731	shown by scientists and engineers
320.731	at these government agencies
325.183	is beyond belief.
327.539	These unhealthy cultures
327.539	that are festering in these groups,
331.105	where the focus is on meeting
331.105	regulations and checking boxes
335.074	as opposed to protecting public health,
337.248	is just appalling.
339.416	Just consider this email
339.416	that an EPA employee wrote,
343.741	where she goes,
345.987	"""I'm not so sure Flint is a community"
345.987	"we want to go out on a limb for."""
351.81	The dehumanization of an entire population
351.81	could not be more obvious.
356.671	Now, contrast that to the first
356.671	canon of engineering,
361.604	which, in my opinion, should be
361.604	the first law of humanity:
364.889	"""To hold paramount the health,"
364.889	"safety and welfare of the public,"""
368.99	above all else.
370.684	This is the Hippocratic Oath
370.684	we've rarely acknowledged,
374.152	let alone embraced.
376.369	And so when scientists and engineers,
376.369	very much like medical doctors,
380.619	screw up,
381.892	people can get hurt --
383.757	even die.
385.152	If our professionals and even
385.152	students fail to get that,
389.721	society pays a huge price.
393.472	Buried deep in history lies
393.472	a character I deeply admire --
397.697	an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.
400.862	He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.
404.187	And Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble
404.187	for his radical honesty
409.203	and willingness to point out major flaws
409.203	in the Soviets' mindless pursuit
414.782	of rapid industrialization.
417.549	Everyone was expected to follow orders
417.549	coming from the top.
421.591	Anyone asking questions
421.591	or offering feedback was unwelcome.
426.174	The Soviets had created the largest army
426.174	of engineers the world had ever seen,
431.476	and yet most of them were mere cogs
431.476	in a gigantic machine heading for doom.
437.284	Palchinsky, on the other hand,
437.284	implored engineers
440.35	to look at the economic, political
440.35	and social consequences of their actions;
445.71	in other words, be more public-focused.
448.723	His fearless voice of reason
448.723	was seen as a threat
452.546	to the political establishment,
454.387	and Joseph Stalin
454.387	had him executed in 1929.
459.511	Palchinsky's view on technocrats
459.511	is very different
463.697	from one that is still very popular,
463.697	still very common --
469.071	that of a dispassionate researcher
469.071	working in his ivory tower lab,
474.804	or a nerdy engineer
474.804	working in his cubicle.
478.338	Brilliant, no doubt,
480.654	yet somehow cut off from the world,
482.608	shows little emotion --
484.844	kind of like Spock
484.844	"from ""Star Trek,"" you know?"
488.767	This guy.
490.027	(Laughter)
491.648	Let's try and do the Spock salute.
494.096	I don't think I'll succeed ...
496.819	See, I can't be Spock.
498.484	Thank goodness I can't be Spock.
500.646	(Laughter)
503.152	I was reminded of this distinction
503.152	because a recent article came out
507.933	in a very reputed scientific journal,
511.183	which kind of characterized our Flint work
511.183	"as driven by ""youthful idealism,"""
516.53	"and ""Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities."""
519.233	It asks scientists to protect
519.233	their research funding and institutions
524.748	at all costs, no matter
524.748	how just the cause.
528.123	And if you think you have to get
528.123	involved in something,
531.469	even if it's an emergency,
533.528	try finding an activist group or an NGO,
537.705	and obtain the full support
537.705	of the academic community --
540.725	whatever that means --
542.087	before you get involved.
544.447	Not one mention of our moral
544.447	and professional obligation
548.616	of preventing harm to the public,
550.703	or the fact that we have
550.703	all this expertise,
554.096	resources and, for some, even tenure
557.145	to, you know, accomplish this task.
560.597	I'm not saying every scientist
560.597	should be an activist.
563.349	There are real and sometimes very painful
563.349	consequences of speaking up.
568.192	But to denounce this idea,
568.192	this possibility so completely
573.047	so that you can protect research funding,
575.467	simply screams of self-serving cowardice,
578.116	and these are not the ideals
578.116	we would want to pass to our students.
584.39	And so you may think,
584.39	"""OK, all this sounds great,"
587.776	but you'll never completely change
587.776	organizational cultures,
591.423	or imbibe mindsets in students
591.423	and professionals
595.494	to look at their work as a public good --
598.155	"science in service to the public."""
600.887	Maybe so.
602.374	But could a big reason for that be
604.64	that we are not training
604.64	our students right?
607.841	Because if you look closely,
610.167	our education system today
610.167	is focused more on creating
615.103	what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz
615.103	"calls ""excellent sheep"" --"
620.182	young people who are smart and ambitious,
623.061	and yet somehow risk-averse,
623.061	timid, directionless
627.989	and, sometimes, full of themselves.
630.815	Now, kids ... you know,
632.758	we fell in love with science
632.758	when we were kids,
635.398	and yet we somehow spend most of our time
635.398	during high school and college
639.724	just jumping through hoops
641.245	and doing things
641.245	so that we can polish our résumé
644.736	instead of sitting down
646.43	and reflecting on what we want to do
646.43	and who we want to be.
652.952	And so,
655.444	the markers of empathy
655.444	in our college graduates
659.103	have been dropping dramatically
659.103	in the past two decades,
662.27	while those of narcissism are on the rise.
665.02	There is also a growing culture
665.02	of disengagement
667.715	between engineering students
667.715	and the public.
671.431	We are trained to build bridges
671.431	and solve complex problems
676.729	but not how to think or live
676.729	or be a citizen of this world.
681.767	My undergraduate years
681.767	were explicit job preparation,
686.184	and I cannot tell you how suffocating
686.184	and painful it was at times.
691.748	And so,
693.384	some people think the solution
693.384	to great engineers, to great scientists,
696.985	is more technical training.
698.813	Maybe so.
700.07	But where are the discussions
700.07	on ethical decision-making,
703.588	or building character,
705.437	or discerning right from wrong?
709.442	Consider this project
709.442	that I deeply love and admire.
713.832	"It's called, ""Heroic Imagination Project."""
716.634	A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,
719.281	famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,
722.083	this program seeks to train
722.083	school-going children around the world
727.352	to look at themselves
727.352	as heroes-in-waiting,
730.816	or heroes-in-training.
732.756	So, these young minds work over time
732.756	to develop skills and virtues
738.131	so that when the opportunity comes,
740.315	no matter what that opportunity be,
742.909	to stand up and do the right thing.
746.18	In other words,
747.491	anyone can be a hero.
750.227	Think about that idea for a second.
752.951	Why don't we teach science
752.951	and engineering like that --
756.083	where heroism and public service
756.083	are seen as key values,
760.485	because indeed, it's often heroism
763.127	that is not only the antidote
763.127	to public indifference,
766.899	but also to systemic evil
766.899	like we saw in Flint.
771.957	And so, dream with me
773.415	what a 21st-century scientist
773.415	slash engineer could look like:
777.596	individuals who are driven
777.596	to master the sciences
781.173	so that they can serve society,
783.171	and are also aware
784.389	of the tremendous power
784.389	their knowledge and decisions have;
788.36	folks who are developing
788.36	their moral courage at all times,
792.127	and who realize that conflict
792.127	and controversy
795.937	are not necessarily bad things
798.065	if our ultimate loyalty
798.065	is to the public and the planet.
802.641	These are the people who will
802.641	stand up like we did in Flint --
807.707	not to be saviors or heroes in the media,
811.466	but altruistic and fundamentally good
811.466	actors that you and I can trust.
819.537	Imagine fostering
819.537	such a public-focused mindset
824.354	in classes, on service trips
824.354	and during activities
827.833	during college or even high school,
830.199	so that these young minds
830.199	will hold onto those ideals
834.037	when they actually enter the real world,
836.533	whether that be consulting,
836.533	academia, policy making --
840.68	or even becoming
840.68	the president of a country.
845.362	Some of mankind's greatest
845.362	challenges lie ahead of us;
848.934	contaminated drinking water
848.934	is just one example.
852.411	We could definitely use more --
854.505	nay, we desperately need more --
854.505	compassionate upstanders
859.516	and public-focused
859.516	scientists and engineers
862.674	who will strive to the do right thing,
864.707	and not be easy to manage.
866.743	Thank you.
867.938	(Applause)
