16.26	I'd like to start with a short story.
20.26	It's about a little boy
22.26	whose father was a history buff
27.26	and who used to take him by the hand
29.26	to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis
33.26	on the outskirts of their camp.
36.26	They would always stop by to visit
39.26	these huge winged bulls that used to guard
42.26	the gates of that ancient metropolis,
44.26	and the boy used to be scared
46.26	of these winged bulls,
48.26	but at the same time they excited him.
50.26	And the dad used to use those bulls
52.26	to tell the boy stories about
54.26	that civilization and their work.
58.26	Let's fast-forward to the
61.26	San Francisco Bay Area many decades later,
64.26	where I started a technology company
67.26	that brought the world its first
70.26	3D laser scanning system.
72.26	Let me show you how it works.
74.26	Female Voice: Long range laser scanning
76.26	by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light.
79.26	The system measures the beam's time of flight,
81.26	recording the time it takes for the light
83.26	to hit a surface and make its return.
86.26	With two mirrors, the scanner calculates
88.26	the beam's horizontal and vertical angles,
91.26	giving accurate x, y, and z coordinates.
94.26	The point is then recorded
96.26	into a 3D visualization program.
101.26	All of this happens in seconds.
106.26	Ben Kacyra: You can see here,
108.26	these systems are extremely fast.
111.26	They collect millions of points at a time
114.26	with very high accuracy
116.26	and very high resolution.
118.26	A surveyor with traditional survey tools
121.26	would be hard-pressed to produce
123.26	maybe 500 points in a whole day.
126.26	These babies would be producing
129.26	something like ten thousand points a second.
132.26	So, as you can imagine,
134.26	this was a paradigm shift
137.26	in the survey and construction
139.26	as well as in reality capture industry.
146.26	Approximately ten years ago,
149.26	my wife and I started a foundation to do good,
152.26	and right about that time,
154.26	the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas,
157.26	hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan,
160.26	were blown up by the Taliban.
163.26	They were gone in an instant.
165.26	And unfortunately, there was
167.26	no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.
169.26	This clearly devastated me,
171.26	and I couldn't help but wonder about
173.26	the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls,
176.26	and the fate of the many, many
179.26	heritage sites all over the world.
182.26	Both my wife and I
184.26	were so touched by this
186.26	that we decided to
188.26	expand the mission of our foundation
191.26	to include digital heritage preservation
195.26	of world sites.
197.26	We called the project CyArk,
200.26	which stands for Cyber Archive.
202.26	To date, with the help of
204.26	a global network of partners,
207.26	we've completed close to fifty projects.
209.26	Let me show you some of them:
211.26	Chichen Itza,
213.26	Rapa Nui --
215.26	and what you're seeing here
217.26	are the cloud of points --
219.26	Babylon,
221.26	Rosslyn Chapel,
223.26	Pompeii,
225.26	and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore,
227.26	which happened to be one of
229.26	our most challenging projects.
231.26	As you see here, we had to develop
233.26	a special rig to bring the scanner
236.26	up close and personal.
239.26	The results of our work in the field
242.26	are used to produce
244.26	media and deliverables to be used
246.26	by conservators and researchers.
249.26	We also produce media for
253.26	dissemination to the public --
256.26	free through the CyArk website.
259.26	These would be used for education,
262.26	cultural tourism, etc.
264.26	What you're looking at in here
266.26	is a 3D viewer that we developed
269.26	that would allow the display
271.26	and manipulation of [the] cloud of points
273.26	in real time, cutting sections through them
276.26	and extracting dimensions.
278.26	This happens to be the cloud of points
280.26	for Tikal.
281.26	In here you see a traditional 2D
283.26	architectural engineering drawing
285.26	that's used for preservation, and of course
288.26	we tell the stories through fly-throughs.
291.26	And here, this is a fly-through
293.26	the cloud of points of Tikal,
295.26	and here you see it rendered
298.26	and photo-textured with the photography
300.26	that we take of the site.
303.26	And so this is not a video.
305.26	This is actual 3D points with
307.26	two to three millimeter accuracy.
311.26	And of course the data can be used
313.26	to develop 3D models that are
316.26	very accurate and very detailed.
319.26	And here you're looking at a model
321.26	that's extracted from the cloud of points
323.26	for Stirling Castle.
325.26	It's used for studies, for visualization,
328.26	as well as for education.
331.26	And finally, we produce mobile apps
333.26	that include narrated virtual tools.
337.26	The more I got involved
340.26	in the heritage field,
342.26	the more it became clear to me
345.26	that we are losing the sites
348.26	and the stories faster than we can
351.26	physically preserve them.
354.26	Of course, earthquakes
356.26	and all the natural phenomena --
358.26	floods, tornadoes, etc. --
360.26	take their toll.
363.26	However, what occurred to me was
366.26	human-caused destruction, which was
368.26	not only causing a significant portion
370.26	of the destruction, but actually
373.26	it was accelerating.
376.26	This includes arson,
378.26	urban sprawl,
380.26	acid rain, not to mention
383.26	terrorism and wars.
385.26	It was getting more and more apparent
388.26	that we're fighting a losing battle.
390.26	We're losing our sites
392.26	and the stories,
394.26	and basically we're losing
396.26	a piece -- and a significant piece --
398.26	of our collective memory.
401.26	Imagine us as a human race
403.26	not knowing where we came from.
407.26	Luckily, in the last two or three decades,
410.26	digital technologies have been developing
413.26	that have helped us to develop tools
415.26	that we've brought to bear
417.26	in the digital preservation,
419.26	in our digital preservation war.
421.26	This includes, for example,
423.26	the 3D laser scanning systems,
427.26	ever more powerful personal computers,
430.26	3D graphics,
432.26	high-definition digital photography,
435.26	not to mention the Internet.
438.26	Because of this accelerated
440.26	pace of destruction,
442.26	it became clear to us that we needed
444.26	to challenge ourselves and our partners
447.26	to accelerate our work.
449.26	And we created a project
451.26	we call the CyArk 500 Challenge --
454.26	and that is to digitally preserve
460.26	in five years.
462.26	We do have the technology
464.26	that's scaleable,
466.26	and our network of global partners
470.26	has been expanding and can be expanded
473.26	at a rapid rate,
475.26	so we're comfortable
477.26	that this task can be accomplished.
480.26	However, to me, the 500 is
483.26	really just the first 500.
487.26	In order to sustain our work into the future,
491.26	we use technology centers
494.26	where we partner with
497.26	local universities and colleges
499.26	to take the technology to them,
502.26	whereby they then can help us
505.26	with digital preservation of their heritage sites,
508.26	and at the same time, it gives them
511.26	the technology to benefit from in the future.
515.26	Let me close with another short story.
519.26	Two years ago, we were approached
521.26	by a partner of ours to digitally preserve
524.26	an important heritage site,
526.26	a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda,
529.26	the Royal Kasubi Tombs.
532.26	The work was done successfully in the field,
535.26	and the data was archived
537.26	and publicly disseminated
539.26	through the CyArk website.
542.26	Last March,
544.26	we received very sad news.
547.26	The Royal Tombs had been destroyed
550.26	by suspected arson.
553.26	A few days later, we received a call:
556.26	"""Is the data available"
559.26	"and can it be used for reconstruction?"""
563.26	Our answer, of course, was yes.
568.26	Let me leave you with a final thought.
571.26	Our heritage is much more than
574.26	our collective memory --
576.26	it's our collective treasure.
578.26	We owe it to our children,
581.26	our grandchildren and the generations
583.26	we will never meet
586.26	to keep it safe
588.26	and to pass it along.
590.26	Thank you.
592.26	(Applause)
594.26	Thank you.
596.26	Thank you.
598.26	Thank you.
609.26	Well, I'm staying here because
613.26	we wanted to demonstrate to you
616.26	the power of this technology
619.26	and so, while I've been speaking,
622.26	you have been scanned.
625.26	(Laughter)
629.26	The two wizards that I have
632.26	that are behind the curtain
634.26	will help me bring
637.26	the results on the screen.
645.26	(Applause)
652.26	This is all in 3D and of course
655.26	you can fly through the cloud of points.
658.26	You can look at it from on top,
660.26	from the ceiling.
662.26	You can look from different vantage points,
664.26	but I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in
667.26	on an individual in the crowd,
670.26	just to show the amount of detail
673.26	that we can create.
679.26	So you have been digitally preserved
682.26	in about four minutes.
684.26	(Laughter)
686.26	I'd like to thank the wizards here.
690.26	We were very lucky to have
693.26	two of our partners participate in this:
697.26	the Historic Scotland,
699.26	and the Glasgow School of Art.
702.26	I'd like to also thank personally
706.26	the efforts of David Mitchell,
710.26	who is the Director of Conservation
713.26	at Historic Scotland.
715.26	David.
717.26	(Applause)
722.26	And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of
724.26	Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.
727.26	Let's give them a hand.
729.26	(Applause)
732.26	Thank you.
