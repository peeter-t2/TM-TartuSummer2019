13.506	When I arrived in Kiev,
15.335	on February 1 this year,
17.731	Independence Square was under siege,
20.35	surrounded by police
20.35	loyal to the government.
23.988	The protesters who occupied Maidan,
26.529	as the square is known,
28.361	prepared for battle,
29.981	stockpiling homemade weapons
32.24	and mass-producing improvised body armor.
36.16	The Euromaidan protests began peacefully
36.16	at the end of 2013,
41.133	after the president of Ukraine,
41.133	Viktor Yanukovych,
44.364	rejected a far-reaching accord
44.364	with the European Union
47.85	in favor of stronger ties with Russia.
50.847	In response, tens of thousands
50.847	of dissatisfied citizens
54.204	poured into central Kiev
54.204	to demonstrate against this allegiance.
59.656	As the months passed,
61.291	confrontations between police
61.291	and civilians intensified.
65.858	I set up a makeshift portrait studio
65.858	by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.
72.248	There, I photographed
72.248	the fighters against a black curtain,
76.551	a curtain that obscured
76.551	the highly seductive and visual backdrop
80.949	of fire, ice and smoke.
84.858	In order to tell the individual
84.858	human stories here,
88.242	I felt that I needed to remove
88.242	the dramatic visuals
91.376	that had become so familiar and repetitive
91.376	within the mainstream media.
96.455	What I was witnessing
96.455	was not only news, but also history.
100.593	With this realization,
101.928	I was free from
101.928	the photojournalistic conventions
104.864	of the newspaper and the magazine.
107.869	Oleg, Vasiliy and Maxim
107.869	were all ordinary men,
112.895	with ordinary lives from ordinary towns.
116.309	But the elaborate costumes
116.309	that they had bedecked themselves in
119.623	were quite extraordinary.
120.953	"I say the word ""costume"""
122.744	because these were not clothes
122.744	that had been issued
125.194	or coordinated by anyone.
127.179	They were improvised uniforms
129.483	made up of decommissioned
129.483	military equipment,
132.363	irregular combat fatigues
132.363	and trophies taken from the police.
137.725	I became interested in the way they
137.725	were choosing to represent themselves,
142.297	this outward expression of masculinity,
145.843	the ideal of the warrior.
148.724	I worked slowly,
148.724	using an analog film camera
152.009	with a manual focusing loop
152.009	and a handheld light meter.
155.764	The process is old-fashioned.
158.279	It gives me time to speak with each person
161.268	and to look at them, in silence,
161.268	while they look back at me.
167.755	Rising tensions culminated
167.755	in the worst day of violence
170.982	on February 20,
172.711	which became known as Bloody Thursday.
175.663	Snipers, loyal to the government,
177.717	started firing on the civilians
177.717	and protesters on Institutskaya Street.
183.12	Many were killed
183.12	in a very short space of time.
187.123	The reception of the Hotel Ukraine
187.123	became a makeshift morgue.
191.236	There were lines
191.236	of bodies laid in the street.
194.282	And there was blood
194.282	all over the pavements.
197.908	The following day,
197.908	President Yanukovych fled Ukraine.
202.146	In all, three months of protests
203.929	resulted in more than 120 confirmed dead
207.398	and many more missing.
209.913	History unfolded quickly,
211.956	but celebration remained
211.956	elusive in Maidan.
215.488	As the days passed
215.488	in Kiev's central square,
218.289	streams of armed fighters
219.828	were joined by tens of thousands
219.828	of ordinary people,
223.254	filling the streets in an act
223.254	of collective mourning.
227.174	Many were women who often carried flowers
229.588	that they had brought to lay
229.588	as marks of respect for the dead.
233.768	They came day after day
235.339	and they covered the square
235.339	with millions of flowers.
240.517	Sadness enveloped Maidan.
243.281	It was quiet and I could hear
243.281	the birds singing.
245.895	I hadn't heard that before.
248.141	I stopped women
248.141	as they approached the barricades
250.639	to lay their tributes
251.807	and asked to make their picture.
254.478	Most women cried when I photographed them.
257.592	On the first day,
257.592	my fixer, Emine, and I cried
259.768	with almost every woman
259.768	who visited our studio.
264.876	There had been such a noticeable
264.876	absence of women
267.882	up until that point.
269.625	And the color of their pastel coats,
271.918	their shiny handbags,
273.656	and the bunches of red carnations,
275.746	white tulips and yellow roses
275.746	that they carried
278.977	jarred with the blackened square
281.113	and the blackened men
281.113	who were encamped there.
285.105	It is clear to me
285.105	that these two sets of pictures
287.956	don't make much sense without the other.
290.694	They are about men and women
290.694	and the way we are --
293.091	not the way we look,
293.091	but the way we are.
295.831	They speak about different
295.831	gender roles in conflict,
298.663	not only in Maidan,
298.663	and not only in Ukraine.
302.597	Men fight most wars and women mourn them.
306.399	If the men showed
306.399	the ideal of the warrior,
308.835	then the women showed
308.835	the implications of such violence.
313.256	When I made these pictures,
315.02	I believed that I was documenting
315.02	the end of violent events in Ukraine.
318.824	But now I understand
318.824	that it is a record of the beginning.
322.317	Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,
325.73	while hundreds of thousands
325.73	have been displaced.
329.847	I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.
332.547	In Maidan, the barricades
332.547	have been dismantled,
336.035	and the paving stones which were used
336.035	as weapons during the protests replaced,
339.917	so that traffic flows freely
339.917	through the center of the square.
344.129	The fighters, the women
344.129	and the flowers are gone.
348.737	A huge billboard depicting geese
348.737	flying over a wheat field
352.538	covers the burned-out shell
352.538	of the trade union's building
355.806	and proclaims,
357.234	"""Glory to Ukraine."
358.685	"Glory to heroes."""
360.383	Thank you.
361.383	(Applause).
