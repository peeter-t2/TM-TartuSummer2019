12.36	What does a working mother look like?
15.24	If you ask the Internet,
15.24	this is what you'll be told.
18.52	Never mind that this is
18.52	what you'll actually produce
22.97	if you attempt to work at a computer
22.97	with a baby on your lap.
25.88	(Laughter)
27.44	But no, this isn't a working mother.
30.36	You'll notice a theme in these photos.
30.36	We'll look at a lot of them.
33.56	That theme is amazing natural lighting,
36	which, as we all know,
39.16	is the hallmark
39.16	of every American workplace.
43.36	There are thousands of images like these.
46.84	"Just put the term ""working mother"""
46.84	into any Google image search engine,
50.28	stock photo site.
51.56	They're all over the Internet,
53.04	they're topping
53.04	blog posts and news pieces,
55.44	and I've become kind of obsessed with them
55.44	and the lie that they tell us
59.8	and the comfort that they give us,
61.8	that when it comes
61.8	to new working motherhood in America,
65.24	everything's fine.
67.04	But it's not fine.
68.64	As a country, we are sending
68.64	millions of women back to work
72.08	every year, incredibly
72.08	and kind of horrifically soon
76.04	after they give birth.
77.72	That's a moral problem
79.44	but today I'm also going to tell you
79.44	why it's an economic problem.
83.36	I got so annoyed and obsessed
83.36	with the unreality of these images,
87	which look nothing like my life,
89.04	that I recently decided to shoot and star
89.04	in a parody series of stock photos
94.24	that I hoped the world would start to use
96.4	just showing the really awkward reality
96.4	of going back to work
100.68	when your baby's food source
100.68	is attached to your body.
105.32	I'm just going to show you two of them.
107.72	(Laughter)
109.8	"Nothing says ""Give that girl a promotion"""
109.8	like leaking breast milk
112.92	through your dress during a presentation.
115.08	You'll notice that there's
115.08	no baby in this photo,
117.52	because that's not how this works,
120.16	not for most working mothers.
122.52	Did you know, and this will ruin your day,
124.6	that every time a toilet is flushed,
124.6	its contents are aerosolized
127.8	and they'll stay airborne for hours?
130.24	And yet, for many new working mothers,
133	this is the only place during the day
133	that they can find to make food
136.28	for their newborn babies.
138.88	I put these things,
138.88	a whole dozen of them, into the world.
142.36	I wanted to make a point.
144	I didn't know what I was also doing
144	was opening a door,
147.44	because now, total strangers
147.44	from all walks of life
151	write to me all the time
152.96	just to tell me what it's like
152.96	for them to go back to work
156.84	within days or weeks of having a baby.
159.88	I'm going to share
162.48	They are totally real,
162.48	some of them are very raw,
165.88	and not one of them
165.88	looks anything like this.
170.36	Here's the first.
172.16	"""I was an active duty"
172.16	service member at a federal prison.
175.88	I returned to work after the maximum
175.88	allowed eight weeks for my C-section.
180.28	A male coworker was annoyed
180.28	that I had been out on 'vacation,'
184.36	so he intentionally opened the door on me
184.36	while I was pumping breast milk
187.813	and stood in the doorway
187.813	"with inmates in the hallway."""
191.88	Most of the stories that these women,
191.88	total strangers, send to me now,
195.2	are not actually even about breastfeeding.
197.48	A woman wrote to me to say,
199.4	"""I gave birth to twins and went back"
199.4	to work after seven unpaid weeks.
204.2	Emotionally, I was a wreck.
205.88	Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage
205.88	during labor, and major tearing,
210.24	so I could barely get up, sit or walk.
213	My employer told me I wasn't allowed
213	to use my available vacation days
216.88	"because it was budget season."""
219.8	I've come to believe that we can't look
219.8	situations like these in the eye
224.44	because then we'd be horrified,
226.28	and if we get horrified
226.28	then we have to do something about it.
229.36	So we choose to look at,
229.36	and believe, this image.
233.24	I don't really know
233.24	what's going on in this picture,
235.72	because I find it weird
235.72	and slightly creepy.
238.4	(Laughter)
239.84	Like, what is she doing?
241.08	But I know what it tells us.
245.12	It tells us that everything's fine.
247.68	This working mother, all working mothers
247.68	and all of their babies, are fine.
251.44	There's nothing to see here.
253.44	And anyway, women have made a choice,
256.88	so none of it's even our problem.
259.2	I want to break this choice thing
259.2	down into two parts.
262.16	The first choice says
262.16	that women have chosen to work.
265.8	So, that's not true.
268.04	Today in America, women make up
273.279	and in 40 percent of American households
275.28	a woman is the sole
275.28	or primary breadwinner.
278.84	Our paid work is a part, a huge part,
278.84	of the engine of this economy,
283.4	and it is essential
283.4	for the engines of our families.
286.2	On a national level,
286.2	our paid work is not optional.
290.4	Choice number two says that women
290.4	are choosing to have babies,
293.36	so women alone should bear
293.36	the consequences of those choices.
298.2	You know, that's one of those things
300	that when you hear it in passing,
300	can sound correct.
302.48	I didn't make you have a baby.
303.933	I certainly wasn't there
303.933	when that happened.
306.04	But that stance
306.04	ignores a fundamental truth,
312.08	which is that our procreation
312.08	on a national scale is not optional.
317	The babies that women, many of them
317	working women, are having today,
321.52	will one day fill our workforce,
321.52	protect our shores,
324.76	make up our tax base.
326.6	Our procreation
326.6	on a national scale is not optional.
330.8	These aren't choices.
332.2	We need women to work.
332.2	We need working women to have babies.
336.04	So we should make
336.04	doing those things at the same time
338.541	at least palatable, right?
340.96	OK, this is pop quiz time:
343.68	what percentage of working
343.68	women in America do you think
346.64	have no access to paid maternity leave?
	will not get one minute of paid leave
357.04	after they have a baby.
358.68	So now you're thinking about unpaid leave.
362.32	It exists in America.
362.32	It's called FMLA. It does not work.
365.92	Because of the way it's structured,
365.92	all kinds of exceptions,
368.92	half of new mothers are ineligible for it.
372.96	Here's what that looks like.
376.32	"""We adopted our son."
378.16	When I got the call, the day he was born,
378.16	I had to take off work.
382.4	I had not been there long enough
382.4	to qualify for FMLA,
385.56	so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.
388.32	When I took time off
388.32	to meet my newborn son,
390.76	"I lost my job."""
393.84	These corporate stock photos
393.84	hide another reality, another layer.
398.76	Of those who do have access
398.76	to just that unpaid leave,
402.4	most women can't afford
402.4	to take much of it at all.
405.6	"A nurse told me, ""I didn't qualify"
405.6	for short-term disability
409.12	because my pregnancy
409.12	was considered a preexisting condition.
413.2	We used up all of our tax returns
413.2	and half of our savings
415.891	during my six unpaid weeks.
417.76	We just couldn't manage any longer.
419.52	Physically it was hard,
419.52	but emotionally it was worse.
422.08	I struggled for months
422.08	"being away from my son."""
425.08	So this decision
425.08	to go back to work so early,
428	it's a rational economic decision
428	driven by family finances,
432.2	but it's often physically horrific
434.48	because putting a human
434.48	into the world is messy.
438.04	A waitress told me,
439.48	"""With my first baby, I was back"
439.48	at work five weeks postpartum.
443.04	With my second, I had to have
443.04	major surgery after giving birth,
446.12	so I waited until six weeks to go back.
449.16	"I had third degree tears."""
	working mothers in America
455.96	will be back on the job
455.96	within two weeks of giving birth.
462.32	"""I worked as a bartender and cook,"
462.32	average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.
467	I had to return to work
467	before my baby was a month old,
469.64	working 60 hours a week.
471.68	One of my coworkers was only able
471.68	"to afford 10 days off with her baby."""
476.76	Of course, this isn't just a scenario
476.76	with economic and physical implications.
480.96	Childbirth is, and always will be,
480.96	an enormous psychological event.
486.16	A teacher told me,
488.28	"""I returned to work"
488.28	eight weeks after my son was born.
491.28	I already suffer from anxiety,
493.2	but the panic attacks I had prior
493.2	"to returning to work were unbearable."""
498.32	Statistically speaking,
500.44	the shorter a woman's leave
500.44	after having a baby,
503.16	the more likely she will be to suffer
503.16	from postpartum mood disorders
506.4	like depression and anxiety,
508.52	and among many potential
508.52	consequences of those disorders,
512.56	suicide is the second
512.56	most common cause of death
515.72	in a woman's first year postpartum.
519.24	Heads up that this next story --
520.84	I've never met this woman,
520.84	but I find it hard to get through.
525.44	"""I feel tremendous grief and rage"
525.44	that I lost an essential,
529.64	irreplaceable and formative
529.64	time with my son.
533.52	Labor and delivery
533.52	left me feeling absolutely broken.
536.96	For months, all I remember
536.96	is the screaming: colic, they said.
541.64	On the inside, I was drowning.
543.8	Every morning, I asked myself
543.8	how much longer I could do it.
547.52	I was allowed to bring my baby to work.
550.72	I closed my office door
550.72	while I rocked and shushed
553.88	and begged him to stop screaming
553.88	so I wouldn't get in trouble.
557.4	I hid behind that office door
557.4	every damn day
559.48	and cried while he screamed.
561.44	I cried in the bathroom
561.44	while I washed out the pump equipment.
565.12	Every day, I cried all the way to work
565.12	and all the way home again.
568.28	I promised my boss that the work
568.28	I didn't get done during the day,
571.44	I'd make up at night from home.
573.12	I thought, there's just something
573.12	"wrong with me that I can't swing this."""
578.52	So those are the mothers.
581.16	What of the babies?
582.96	As a country, do we care
582.96	about the millions of babies
585.48	born every year to working mothers?
587.36	I say we don't,
588.72	not until they're of working
588.72	and tax-paying and military-serving age.
592.2	We tell them we'll see them in 18 years,
594.129	and getting there is kind of on them.
597.854	One of the reasons I know this
597.854	is that babies whose mothers
600.64	have 12 or more weeks at home with them
602.96	are more likely to get their vaccinations
602.96	and their well checks in their first year,
606.96	so those babies are more protected
606.96	from deadly and disabling diseases.
611.68	But those things are hidden
611.68	behind images like this.
618.28	America has a message for new mothers
618.28	who work and for their babies.
623.8	Whatever time you get together,
623.8	you should be grateful for it,
627.6	and you're an inconvenience
630.36	to the economy and to your employers.
633.4	That narrative of gratitude
633.4	runs through a lot of the stories I hear.
637.96	A woman told me,
639.64	"""I went back at eight weeks"
639.64	after my C-section
641.84	because my husband was out of work.
643.68	Without me, my daughter
643.68	had failure to thrive.
646.44	She wouldn't take a bottle.
647.76	She started losing weight.
649.4	Thankfully, my manager
649.4	was very understanding.
652.24	He let my mom bring my baby,
653.8	who was on oxygen and a monitor,
656.12	"four times a shift so I could nurse her."""
659.96	There's a little club
659.96	of countries in the world
663.36	that offer no national
663.36	paid leave to new mothers.
667.24	Care to guess who they are?
669.72	The first eight make up eight million
669.72	in total population.
673.68	They are Papua New Guinea,
673.68	Suriname and the tiny island nations
677.2	of Micronesia, Marshall Islands,
677.2	Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.
683.44	Number nine is
683.44	the United States of America,
685.84	with 320 million people.
689.32	Oh, that's it.
691.68	That's the end of the list.
694.28	Every other economy on the planet
695.92	has found a way to make some level
695.92	of national paid leave work
699.84	for the people doing the work
699.84	of the future of those countries,
702.84	but we say,
702.84	"""We couldn't possibly do that."""
706.92	We say that the market
706.92	will solve this problem,
709.44	and then we cheer when corporations
709.44	offer even more paid leave to the women
713.8	who are already the highest-educated
713.8	and highest-paid among us.
717.08	Remember that 88 percent?
718.92	Those middle- and low-income women
718.92	are not going to participate in that.
723.88	We know that there are staggering
723.88	economic, financial, physical
729.36	and emotional costs to this approach.
731.92	We have decided --
731.92	decided, not an accident,
735.96	to pass these costs directly
735.96	on to working mothers and their babies.
739.92	We know the price tag is higher
739.92	for low-income women,
742.6	therefore disproportionately
742.6	for women of color.
745.4	We pass them on anyway.
747.88	All of this is to America's shame.
750.52	But it's also to America's risk.
754.44	Because what would happen
756.36	if all of these individual
756.36	so-called choices to have babies
760.44	started to turn into individual choices
760.44	not to have babies.
765.32	One woman told me,
767.04	"""New motherhood is hard."
767.04	It shouldn't be traumatic.
770.32	When we talk about expanding
770.32	our family now,
772.6	we focus on how much time I would have
772.6	to care for myself and a new baby.
776.92	If we were to have to do it again
776.92	the same way as with our first,
780.24	"we might stick with one kid."""
783.8	The birthrate needed in America
783.8	to keep the population stable
786.72	is 2.1 live births per woman.
788.88	In America today, we are at 1.86.
792.88	We need women to have babies,
795.2	and we are actively disincentivizing
795.2	working women from doing that.
799.76	What would happen to work force,
799.76	to innovation, to GDP,
803	if one by one, the working mothers
803	of this country were to decide
807.16	that they can't bear
807.16	to do this thing more than once?
811.68	I'm here today with only
811.68	one idea worth spreading,
815.2	and you've guessed what it is.
817.36	It is long since time
817.36	for the most powerful country on Earth
821.08	to offer national paid leave
823.16	to the people doing the work
823.16	of the future of this country
825.899	and to the babies
825.899	who represent that future.
828.8	Childbirth is a public good.
830.96	This leave should be state-subsidized.
833.52	It should have no exceptions
833.52	for small businesses,
836.04	length of employment or entrepreneurs.
838.52	It should be able
838.52	to be shared between partners.
840.92	I've talked today a lot about mothers,
842.92	but co-parents matter on so many levels.
847.52	Not one more woman
847.52	should have to go back to work
850.64	while she is hobbling and bleeding.
853.84	Not one more family should have
853.84	to drain their savings account
857.52	to buy a few days
857.52	of rest and recovery and bonding.
861.2	Not one more fragile infant
863.52	should have to go directly
863.52	from the incubator to day care
866.48	because his parents have used up
866.48	all of their meager time
869.2	sitting in the NICU.
870.84	Not one more working family
870.84	should be told that the collision
873.722	of their work, their needed work
873.722	and their needed parenthood,
878.08	is their problem alone.
880.76	The catch is that when this is happening
880.76	to a new family, it is consuming,
885.44	and a family with a new baby
885.44	is more financially vulnerable
888.24	than they've ever been before,
889.72	so that new mother cannot afford
889.72	to speak up on her own behalf.
893.68	But all of us have voices.
895.92	I am done, done having babies,
899.52	and you might be pre-baby,
901.4	you might be post-baby,
902.8	you might be no baby.
904.44	It should not matter.
906.32	We have to stop framing this
906.32	as a mother's issue,
908.76	or even a women's issue.
910.48	This is an American issue.
914.2	We need to stop buying the lie
914.2	that these images tell us.
917.72	We need to stop being comforted by them.
920	We need to question
920	why we're told that this can't work
922.68	when we see it work
922.68	everywhere all over the world.
926	We need to recognize
926	that this American reality
929.8	is to our dishonor and to our peril.
933.44	Because this is not,
935.64	this is not,
937.28	and this is not
937.28	what a working mother looks like.
942.2	(Applause)
