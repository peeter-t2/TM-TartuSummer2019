18.265	I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,
21.487	but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,
24.673	so that was a bad idea. (Laughter)
26.495	Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation
29.916	to present to you some of my music and some of my work
33.853	as a composer, presumably because it appeals
36.947	to my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)
40.93	And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just
43.538	say that and move forward. (Laughter)
46.994	So, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,
49.874	and that is that I'm really bored with music,
52.079	and I'm really bored with the role of the composer,
55.145	and so I decided to put that idea, boredom,
58.353	as the focus of my presentation to you today.
61.327	And I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope
63.615	that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,
65.85	tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst
69.259	for creativity and invention, and how boredom
71.813	actually forced me to change the fundamental question
74.974	that I was asking in my discipline,
77.055	and how boredom also, in a sense,
79.114	pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of
83.558	most traditional, narrow definition of a composer.
86.168	What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt
88.639	of a piece of music at the piano.
91.467	(Music)
100.782	Okay, I wrote that. (Laughter)
104.096	No, it's not — (Applause) Oh, why thank you.
106.003	No, no, I didn't write that.
107.634	In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,
109.906	and so I was not functioning as a composer.
112.461	Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,
115.512	and there I am, interpreter.
117.573	So, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?
120.282	"But we can ask the question, ""But is it music?"""
124.489	And I say this rhetorically, because of course
126.269	by just about any standard we would have to concede
129.09	that this is, of course, a piece of music,
131.038	but I put this here now because,
133.364	just to set it in your brains for the moment,
135.647	because we're going to return to this question.
137.488	It's going to be a kind of a refrain
139.27	as we go through the presentation.
141.081	So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,
143.309	and my problem with it is, it's boring.
146.515	I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like -- (Laughter)
153.335	It's Beethoven, how can you say that?
155.053	No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
156.788	I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So -- (Laughter)
159.819	I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,
162.542	to transform it in some ways, to personalize it,
165.186	so I might take the opening, like this idea --
167.613	(Music)
169.821	and then I might substitute -- (Music)
174.718	and then I might improvise on that melody
176.357	that goes forward from there -- (Music)
179.992	(Music)
206.014	So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.
209.126	(Applause)
212.721	That would be the kind of thing that I would do,
214.839	and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
216.936	In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is -- (Laughter) --
220.668	it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
225.967	I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have
229.137	to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly
232.709	as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head
235.911	and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations
238.116	I'm going to make to it.
239.714	So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and
242.289	I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,
246.947	and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree
249.268	that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)
252.959	But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me
255.373	for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,
257.793	I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,
260.444	it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
263.662	pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,
266.183	and if you're not doing things like listening to it
268.793	after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.
271.516	It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon
273.485	I go through other instruments, they become familiar,
275.645	and eventually I find myself designing and constructing
278.322	my own instrument, and I brought one with me today,
282.485	and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you
285.421	so you can hear what it sounds like.
287.627	(Music)
299.04	You gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)
304.803	I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)
307.911	They're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)
311.067	(Music)
320.126	I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play
322.711	with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.
325.209	So we have this sound. (Music)
333.062	And with a bank of live electronics,
335.106	I can change the sounds radically. (Music)
339.227	(Music)
348.301	Like that, and like this. (Music)
354.552	And so forth.
356.67	So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world
358.809	of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting
361.486	and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about —
365.26	This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)
368.379	and the cool thing about it is
370.643	I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)
374.211	Okay? (Applause)
375.83	So in that regard, this is one of the things,
379.006	this is one of the privileges of being,
380.866	and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,
383.872	when I told you that I'm the world's greatest,
386.05	if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism
390.054	and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.
392.058	I know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)
395.658	Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.
401.205	I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,
403.937	and it was this distinction that I was most worried about
406.187	when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.
409.124	I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.
411.61	I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.
414.567	Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises
418.383	are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them
422.118	to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,
425.47	and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so
428.497	I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.
431.015	I get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,
434.101	sometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,
437.41	and this is probably the capacity, the role creatively
441.089	for which I'm probably best known professionally.
444.251	Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this,
447.226	and others look like this,
449.299	and some look like this,
451.383	and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.
454.429	It takes a long, long time to make these scores,
456.762	and right now I'm working on a piece
458.935	that's 180 pages in length,
460.958	and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.
465.154	I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)
467.663	So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,
471.227	so after a while the process of notating is not only boring,
474.2	but I actually want the notation to be more interesting,
477.332	and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.
480.051	This is an excerpt from a score called
482.281	"""The Metaphysics of Notation."""
484.472	The full score is 72 feet wide.
487.016	It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.
489.714	Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see
492.6	it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,
496.417	with straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,
500.034	and the 72 feet was actually split
502.688	into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed
505.723	around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,
510.607	and it appeared for one year in the museum,
514.415	and during that year, it was experienced as visual art
517.273	most of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,
519.174	on Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,
522.212	various performers came and interpreted these strange
525.592	and undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)
528.871	Now this was a really exciting experience for me.
532.555	It was gratifying musically, but I think
534.158	the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on
536.854	another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,
539.75	and that is as visual artist. (Laughter)
543.026	We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)
545.526	I am multitudes. (Laughter)
547.529	So one of the things is that, I mean, some people
550.433	"would say, like, ""Oh, you're being a dilettante,"""
552.22	and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,
554.797	because I don't have a pedigree in visual art
556.956	and I don't have any training, but it's just something
558.992	that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,
561.459	as an extension of a kind of creative impulse.
564.359	"I can understand the question, though. ""But is it music?"""
567.455	I mean, there's not any traditional notation.
569.714	I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism
571.967	"in this piece, ""S-tog,"" which I made when I was living in Copenhagen."
575.339	I took the Copenhagen subway map and
577.326	I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,
580.458	and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,
583.229	follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.
586.09	So this is a case of actually adapting something,
589.151	or maybe stealing something,
591.034	and then turning it into a musical notation.
593.375	Another adaptation would be this piece.
595.53	I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.
598.876	I made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,
602.114	and the players follow these scores.
604.352	They follow the second hands, and as they pass over
606.373	the various symbols, the players respond musically.
609.359	Here's another example from another piece,
611.582	and then its realization.
613.636	So in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,
616.115	in the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,
618.502	or thief maybe, and I've also been designer,
621.02	in the case of making the wristwatches.
623.335	And once again, this is, for me, interesting.
626.915	Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.
630.234	Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,
632.921	and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip
635.075	"from a piece called ""Echolalia."""
636.839	This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,
639.91	who is an extraordinary performer.
641.215	Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.
644.647	(Music)
673.535	Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because
675.219	you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,
677.513	the intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)
679.641	Let's watch just another clip.
681.653	(Music)
692.229	You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,
694.925	there were no clarinets and trumpets
696.803	and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has
698.707	an even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.
701.262	"This is ""Tlön,"" for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)"
717.587	This was based on the experience of actually watching
719.527	two people having a virulent argument in sign language,
722.043	which produced no decibels to speak of,
723.902	but affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.
727.313	So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances
730.981	and then the total absence of conventional instruments
735.083	and this glut of conductors, people might, you know,
737.956	"wonder, yeah, ""Is this music?"""
740.859	But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,
744.706	"and that is my ""Concerto for Orchestra."""
747.193	You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments
749.191	in this clip. (Music)
752.891	(Music)
765.738	This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.
767.778	I was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,
770.333	I put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.
774.618	Let's continue with that same excerpt.
776.644	(Music)
786.937	It's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)
795.027	Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.
797.263	(Music)
811.239	So with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,
814.287	and that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.
817.11	I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?
821.597	Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right?
824.06	There was the florist, and I can understand that,
825.993	once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music
829.133	as we know it conventionally,
831.846	but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.
836.269	"This is going to be a piece called ""Aphasia,"""
838.934	and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,
842.369	and this invites yet another role, and final one
845.108	I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.
847.681	And the score for the piece looks like this,
850.159	and it instructs me, the performer, to make
854.569	various hand gestures at very specific times
857.299	synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape
859.553	is made up exclusively of vocal samples.
862.43	I recorded an awesome singer,
864.852	and I took the sound of his voice in my computer,
867.197	and I warped it in countless ways to come up with
869.796	the soundtrack that you're about to hear.
872.064	"And I'll perform just an excerpt of ""Aphasia"" for you here. Okay?"
877.029	(Music)
915.368	So that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)
921.991	Yeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.
924.275	Is it music? Here's how I want to conclude.
926.514	I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,
929.09	that this is not the important question.
931.048	"The important question is, ""Is it interesting?"""
933.781	"And I follow this question, not worrying about ""Is it music?"" --"
936.673	not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.
939.159	I allow my creativity to push me
941.612	in directions that are simply interesting to me,
943.772	and I don't worry about the likeness of the result
946.821	to some notion, some paradigm,
948.877	of what music composition is supposed to be,
951.866	and that has actually urged me, in a sense,
954.309	to take on a whole bunch of different roles,
956.044	and so what I want you to think about is,
958.179	to what extent might you change the fundamental question
961.397	in your discipline, and, okay,
964.12	I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,
966.5	because, like, I realized I mentioned
968.114	some psychological defects earlier, and we also,
971.049	along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,
974.792	and there was some delusional behavior and things like that,
976.953	and here I think we could say that this is an argument
979.934	for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,
981.913	at least in the popular use of the term,
983.849	and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)
986.083	Anyway, despite those perils, I would urge you
989.146	to think about the possibility that you might take on roles
991.721	in your own work, whether they are neighboring
993.812	or far-flung from your professional definition.
996.31	And with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)
998.087	(Applause)
