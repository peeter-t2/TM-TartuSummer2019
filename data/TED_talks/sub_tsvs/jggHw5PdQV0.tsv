12.76	It began with one question:
17.222	If Africa was a bar, what would
17.222	your country be drinking or doing?
23.68	I kicked it off with a guess
23.68	about South Africa,
26.48	which wasn't exactly
26.48	according to the rules
28.56	because South Africa's not my country.
31.64	But alluding to the country's
31.64	continual attempts
34.92	to build a postracial society
37.28	after being ravaged
37.28	for decades by apartheid,
40.6	I tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa
40.6	would be drinking all kinds of alcohol
46.96	and begging them
46.96	to get along in its stomach.
50.96	And then I waited.
52.68	And then I had that funny feeling
52.68	where I wondered if I crossed the line.
56.16	So, I sent out a few other tweets
56.16	about my own country
59.36	and a few other African countries
59.36	I'm familiar with.
62.4	And then I waited again,
63.68	but this time
65.08	I read through almost every tweet
65.08	I had ever tweeted
68.52	to convince myself,
70.28	no, to remind myself that I'm really funny
74.4	and that if nobody gets it, that's fine.
78.96	But luckily,
80.2	I didn't have to do that for very long.
82.44	Very soon, people were participating.
86.28	In fact, by the end of that week in July,
89.56	the hashtag #ifafricawasabar
92.12	would have garnered around 60,000 tweets,
95.84	lit up the continent
97.52	and made its way to publications
97.52	all over the world.
101.24	People were using the hashtag
101.24	to do many different things.
105.28	To poke fun at their stereotypes:
107.48	[#IfAfricaWasABar
107.48	Nigeria would be outside explaining
110.12	that he will pay the entrance fee,
111.92	all he needs is
111.92	the bouncer's account details.]
114.36	(Laughter)
115.6	To criticize government spending:
118	[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be
118	ordering bottles it can't pronounce
121.6	running a tab it won't be able to pay]
123.48	To make light of geopolitical tensions:
126.08	[#IfAfricaWasABar
126.08	South Sudan would be the new guy
128.48	with serious anger management issues.]
130.72	To remind us that even in Africa
132.6	there are some countries
132.6	we don't know exist:
135.08	[#IfAfricaWasABar
135.08	Lesotho would be that person
137.48	who nobody really knows
137.48	but is always in the pictures.]
140.52	And also to make fun of the countries
140.52	that don't think that they're in Africa:
144.8	[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya,
144.8	Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco
147.84	"be like ""What the hell"
147.84	"are we doing here?!!""]"
150.08	(Laughter)
152	And to note the countries
152	that had made a big turnaround:
156.12	[#ifAfricawasabar
156.12	Rwanda would be that girl
158.16	that comes with no money and no transport
158.16	but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
161.8	But most importantly,
164.36	people were using the hashtag to connect.
167.64	People were connecting
167.64	over their Africanness.
171	So for one week in July,
173.32	Twitter became a real African bar.
177.6	And I was really thrilled,
179	mainly because I realized
179	that Pan-Africanism could work,
184.2	that we had before us,
184.2	between us, at our fingertips
189.52	a platform that just needed a small spark
193	to light in us a hunger for each other.
197.12	My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,
199.32	I'm 22 years old
201.08	and I am Pan-Africanist by birth.
204.16	Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth
206.68	because my parents are
206.68	from two different African countries.
210.08	My father's from a country
210.08	called Botswana in southern Africa.
213.84	It's only slightly bigger than Germany.
216.88	This year we celebrate
216.88	our 50th year of stable democracy.
221	And it has some very progressive
221	social policies.
224.6	My mother's country
224.6	is the Kingdom of Swaziland.
228.64	It's a very, very small country,
228.64	also in southern Africa.
231.88	It is Africa's last complete monarchy.
235.52	So it's been ruled by a king
235.52	and a royal family
238.36	in line with their tradition,
239.8	for a very long time.
241.88	On paper, these countries
241.88	seem very different.
244.88	And when I was a kid,
244.88	I could see the difference.
248.44	It rained a lot in one country,
248.44	it didn't rain quite as much in the other.
252.92	But outside of that,
252.92	I didn't really realize
255.32	why it mattered that my parents
255.32	were from two different places.
259.72	But it would go on
259.72	to have a very peculiar effect on me.
263.92	You see, I was born in one country
266.68	and raised in the other.
268.76	When we moved to Botswana,
270.68	I was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati
273.64	and nothing else.
275.24	So I was being introduced to my new home,
277.96	my new cultural identity,
280.24	as a complete outsider,
282.28	incapable of comprehending
282.28	anything that was being said to me
286.56	by the family and country whose traditions
286.56	I was meant to move forward.
291	But very soon, I would shed SiSwati.
295.24	And when I would go back to Swaziland,
297.52	I would be constantly confronted
297.52	by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.
302.64	Add to that my entry
302.64	into Africa's private school system,
306.52	whose entire purpose
306.52	is to beat the Africanness out of you,
310.84	and I would have
310.84	a very peculiar adolescence.
314.24	But I think that my interest
314.24	in ideas of identity was born here,
320.12	in the strange intersection
320.12	of belonging to two places at once
324.4	but not really belonging
324.4	to either one very well
327.52	and belonging to this vast space
327.52	in between and around simultaneously.
333.4	I became obsessed with the idea
333.4	of a shared African identity.
340.56	Since then, I have continued
340.56	to read about politics
343.36	and geography and identity
343.36	and what all those things mean.
346.8	I've also held on to a deep curiosity
346.8	about African philosophies.
351.56	When I began to read,
352.84	I gravitated towards the works
352.84	of black intellectuals
356.28	like Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,
358.76	who tackled complex ideas
360.6	like decolonization
360.6	and black consciousness.
363.68	And when I thought, at 14,
363.68	that I had digested these grand ideas,
367.92	I moved on to the speeches
367.92	of iconic African statesmen
372	like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara
375.04	and Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
377.48	I read every piece of African fiction
377.48	that I could get my hands on.
381.88	So when Twitter came,
383.56	I hopped on with the enthusiasm
383.56	of a teenage girl
387.76	whose friends are super, super bored
387.76	of hearing about all this random stuff.
394.28	The year was 2011
395.64	and all over southern Africa
395.64	and the whole continent,
398.72	affordable data packages
398.72	for smartphones and Internet surfing
402.64	became much easier to get.
405.48	So my generation, we were sending
405.48	messages to each other on this platform
410.96	that just needed 140 characters
410.96	and a little bit of creativity.
415.44	On long commutes to work,
417.88	in lectures that some of us
417.88	should have been paying attention to,
421.36	on our lunch breaks,
422.96	we would communicate as much as we could
425	about the everyday realities
425	of being young and African.
428.88	But of course, this luxury
428.88	was not available to everybody.
432.4	So this meant that if you were
432.4	a teenage girl in Botswana
436.12	and you wanted
436.12	to have fun on the Internet,
438.2	one, you had to tweet in English.
440.88	Two, you had to follow more than just
440.88	the three other people you knew online.
445.68	You had to follow South Africans,
445.68	Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.
450.76	And suddenly, your whole world opened up.
453.56	And my whole world did open up.
455.92	I followed vibrant Africans
455.92	who were travelling around the continent,
459.76	taking pictures of themselves
461.24	and posting them
461.24	under the hashtag #myafrica.
464.36	Because at that time,
465.84	if you were to search Africa
465.84	on Twitter or on Google
468.92	or any kind of social media,
471.2	you would think that the entire continent
471.2	was just pictures of animals
475	and white guys drinking cocktails
475	in hotel resorts.
478.52	(Laughter)
480.8	But Africans were using this platform
483.36	to take some kind of ownership
483.36	of the tourism sectors.
487.44	It was Africans taking selfies
487.44	on the beaches of Nigeria.
491.48	It was Africans
491.48	in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
495.04	And these were the same Africans
495.04	that I began to meet
497.541	in my own travels around the continent.
500	We would discuss African literature,
500	politics, economic policy.
505	But almost invariably, every single time,
509.16	we would end up discussing Twitter.
512.16	And that's when I realized what this was.
515.12	We were standing in the middle
515.12	of something amazing,
518.44	because for the first time ever
520.76	young Africans could discuss
520.76	the future of our continent in real time,
525.84	without the restriction of borders,
525.84	finances and watchful governments.
530.72	Because the little known truth is
532.679	many Africans know a lot less
532.679	about other African countries
536.56	than some Westerners
536.56	might know about Africa as a whole.
540.16	This is by accident,
541.76	but sometimes, it's by design.
543.92	For example, in apartheid South Africa,
546.88	black South Africans
546.88	were constantly being bombarded
550.4	with this message that any country
550.4	ruled by black people
553.52	was destined for failure.
555.52	And this was done to convince them
558.08	that they were much better off
558.08	under crushing white rule
561.76	than they were living
561.76	in a black and free nation.
565.64	Add to that Africa's colonial,
565.64	archaic education system,
570.88	which has been unthinkingly
570.88	carried over from the 1920s --
574.88	and at the age of 15,
574.88	I could name all the various causes
579.2	of the wars that had happened
579.2	in Europe in the past 200 years,
583.28	but I couldn't name the president
583.28	of my neighboring country.
586.64	And to me, this doesn't make any sense
589.52	because whether we like it or not,
591.56	the fates of African people
591.56	are deeply intertwined.
595.68	When disaster hits, when turmoil hits,
599.2	we share the consequences.
601.36	When Burundians flee political turmoil,
604.36	they go to us,
605.72	to other African countries.
607.76	Africa has six of the world's
607.76	largest refugee centers.
612.32	What was once a Burundian problem
615	becomes an African problem.
617.04	So to me, there are no Sudanese problems
620.64	or South African problems
620.64	or Kenyan problems,
623.08	only African problems
624.68	because eventually, we share the turmoil.
627.6	So if we share the problems,
629.36	why aren't we doing a better job
629.36	of sharing the successes?
633.2	How can we do that?
634.44	Well, in the long term,
635.72	we can shoot towards
635.72	increasing inter-African trade,
638.6	removing borders
638.6	and putting pressure on leaders
641.16	to fulfill regional agreements
641.16	they've already signed.
645.2	But I think that the biggest way
645.2	for Africa to share its successes
650.36	is to foster something
650.36	I like to call social Pan-Africanism.
655.32	Now, political Pan-Africanism
655.32	already exists,
658.2	so I'm not inventing anything
658.2	totally new here.
661.36	But political Pan-Africanism
662.96	is usually the African unity
662.96	of the political elite.
666.52	And who does that benefit?
667.88	Well, African leaders, almost exclusively.
671.28	No, what I'm talking about
674.2	is the Pan-Africanism
674.2	of the ordinary African.
677.84	Young Africans like me,
679.92	we are bursting with creative energy,
682.92	with innovative ideas.
685.44	But with bad governance
685.44	and shaky institutions,
688.84	all of this potential could go to waste.
691.52	On a continent where more
691.52	than a handful of leaders
694.08	have been in power longer
695.96	than the majority
695.96	of the populations has been alive,
700.36	we are in desperate need of something new,
703.76	something that works.
706	And I think that thing
706	is social Pan-Africanism.
711.56	My dream is that young Africans
714.72	stop allowing borders and circumstance
714.72	to suffocate our innovation.
720.28	My dream is that when a young African
720.28	comes up with something brilliant,
724.64	"they don't say, ""Well,"
724.64	"this wouldn't work in my country,"""
728.08	and then give up.
729.52	My dream is that young Africans
729.52	begin to realize
733.2	that the entire continent
733.2	is our canvas, is our home.
738.92	Using the Internet,
738.92	we can begin to think collaboratively,
743.28	we can begin to innovate together.
745.88	In Africa, we say,
745.88	"""If you want to go fast, you go alone,"
749.48	but if you want to go far,
749.48	"you go together."""
752.36	And I believe that social Pan-Africanism
752.36	is how we can go far together.
759.48	And this is already happening.
761.52	Access to these online networks
761.52	has given young Africans
764.52	something we've always
764.52	had to violently take: a voice.
768.92	We now have a platform.
770.84	Before now, if you wanted
770.84	to hear from the youth in Africa,
774.8	you waited for the 65-year-old
774.8	minister of youth --
778.56	(Laughter)
779.88	to wake up in the morning,
781.96	take his heartburn medication
785.36	and then tell you the plans
785.36	he has for your generation
788.28	in 20 years time.
790.4	Before now, if you wanted to be heard
790.4	by your possibly tyrannical government,
796.36	you were pushed to protest,
796.36	suffer the consequences
799.76	and have your fingers crossed
801.44	that some Western paper somewhere
801.44	might make someone care.
805.56	But now we have opportunities
805.56	to back each other up
808.4	in ways we never could before.
810.64	We support South African students
812.4	who are marching against
812.4	ridiculously high tertiary fees.
816.04	We support Zimbabwean women
816.04	who are marching to parliament.
819.4	We support Angolan journalists
819.4	who are being illegally detained.
823.56	For the first time ever,
825.72	African pain and African aspiration
830.2	has the ability to be witnessed
833.52	by those who can empathize
833.52	with it the most:
837.16	other Africans.
838.92	I believe that with
838.92	a social Pan-Africanist thinking
842.88	and using the Internet as a tool,
845.92	we can begin to rescue each other,
848.8	and ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
852.4	Thank you.
853.64	(Applause)
