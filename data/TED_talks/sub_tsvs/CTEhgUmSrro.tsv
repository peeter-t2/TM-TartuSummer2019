16.101	I'm actually going to share
16.101	something with you
18.291	I haven't talked about
18.291	probably in more than 10 years.
21.212	So bear with me as I take you
21.212	through this journey.
24.882	When I was 22 years old,
26.381	I came home from work,
26.381	put a leash on my dog
29.907	and went for my usual run.
32.613	I had no idea that at that moment,
34.324	my life was going to change forever.
36.935	While I was preparing my dog for the run,
40.482	a man was finishing drinking at a bar,
43.656	picked up his car keys, got into a car
46.021	and headed south,
47.577	or wherever he was.
50.536	I was running across the street,
52.108	and the only thing
52.108	that I actually remember
54.312	is feeling like a grenade
54.312	went off in my head.
57.478	And I remember
57.478	putting my hands on the ground
61.184	and feeling my life's blood
63.07	emptying out of my neck and my mouth.
68.478	What had happened is, he ran a red light
70.682	and hit me and my dog.
72.823	She ended up underneath the car.
76.157	I flew out in front of the car,
77.742	and then he ran over my legs.
79.956	My left leg got caught up
79.956	in the wheel well --
82.202	spun it around.
86.452	The bumper of the car hit my throat,
88.539	slicing it open.
90.984	I ended up with blunt chest trauma.
93.608	Your aorta comes up behind your heart,
93.608	it's your major artery --
97.625	and it was severed, so my blood
97.625	was gurgling out of my mouth.
102.486	It foamed, and ... horrible things
102.486	were happening to me.
108.461	I had no idea what was going on,
110.175	but strangers intervened,
113.159	kept my heart moving, beating.
115.76	"I say ""moving,"" because it was quivering,"
118.07	and they were trying to put
118.07	a beat back into it.
121.07	Somebody was smart
121.07	and put a Bic pen in my neck
124.055	to open up my airway,
124.055	so I could get some air in there.
127.413	And my lung collapsed,
128.76	so somebody cut me open
128.76	and put a pen in there as well,
131.759	to stop that catastrophic
131.759	event from happening.
138.857	Somehow I ended up at the hospital.
141.077	I was wrapped in ice,
142.364	and then eventually put
142.364	into a drug-induced coma.
147.43	Eighteen months later, I woke up.
150.87	I was blind, I couldn't speak
152.76	and I couldn't walk.
154.673	I was 64 pounds.
160.545	The hospital really has no idea
160.545	what to do with people like that.
164.556	And in fact, they started
164.556	"to call me a ""gomer."""
167.76	That's another story
167.76	we won't even get into.
171.693	I had so many surgeries
171.693	to put my neck back together,
175.05	to repair my heart a few times.
176.76	Some things worked, some things didn't.
179.302	I had lots of titanium put in me;
181.217	cadaver bones,
182.653	to try to get my feet
182.653	moving the right way.
185.93	And I ended up with a plastic nose,
187.679	porcelain teeth
187.679	and all kinds of other things.
189.893	But eventually,
189.893	I started to look human again.
195.04	But ...
199.101	It's hard sometimes
199.101	to talk about these things,
201.369	so bear with me.
203.553	I had more than 50 surgeries.
205.955	But who's counting?
207.58	(Laughter)
209.387	So eventually, the hospital decided
209.387	it was time for me to go.
212.658	They needed to open up
212.658	space for somebody else
215.516	that they thought could come back
218.76	from whatever they were going through.
221.76	Everybody lost faith in me
221.76	being able to recover.
225.158	So they basically put a map
225.158	up on the wall, threw a dart,
228.221	and it landed at a senior home,
228.221	here in Colorado.
232.76	And I know all of you
232.76	are scratching your head:
235.023	"""A senior citizens' home?"
236.274	What in the world
236.274	"are you going to do there?"""
238.428	But if you think about
238.428	all of the skills and talent
240.883	that are in this room right now,
243.455	that's what a senior home has.
245.518	So there were all these skills and talents
247.604	that these seniors had.
249.56	The one advantage
249.56	they had over most of you
252.449	is wisdom,
253.624	because they had a long life.
256.37	And I needed that wisdom
256.37	at that moment in my life.
259.615	But imagine what it was like for them
261.435	when I showed up at their doorstep.
264.277	At that point, I had gained
264.277	four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.
268.261	I was bald.
270.139	I was wearing hospital scrubs.
272.17	And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.
274.861	And I had a white cane in one hand
278.054	and a suitcase full of medical
278.054	records in another hand.
281.443	So the senior citizens realized
283.658	that they needed to have
283.658	an emergency meeting.
285.974	(Laughter)
287.76	So they pulled back
287.76	and they were looking at each other,
290.76	"and they were going, ""OK,"
290.76	what skills do we have in this room?
294.855	"This kid needs a lot of work."""
297.529	So they eventually started
297.529	matching their talents and skills
302.362	to all of my needs.
304.275	But one of the first things
304.275	they needed to do
306.459	was assess what I needed right away.
308.658	I needed to figure out how to eat
308.658	like a normal human being,
311.821	since I'd been eating
311.821	through a tube in my chest
315.186	and through my veins.
316.76	So I had to go
316.76	through trying to eat again.
319.987	And they went through that process.
322.169	And then they had to figure out:
323.76	"""Well, she needs furniture."
325.535	She is sleeping in the corner
325.535	"of this apartment."""
328.64	So they went to their storage lockers
330.76	and all gathered their extra furniture --
332.76	gave me pots and pans, blankets --
336.298	everything.
338.577	And then the next thing that I needed
342.079	was a makeover.
343.556	(Laughter)
344.73	So out went the green scrubs,
346.309	and in came the polyester
346.309	and floral prints.
349.199	(Laughter)
353.514	We're not going to talk
353.514	about the hairstyles
355.646	they tried to force on me
355.646	once my hair grew back.
359.263	But I did say no to the blue hair.
361.022	(Laughter)
364.577	So eventually, what went on is,
368.277	they decided that, well,
368.277	I need to learn to speak.
371.181	You can't be an independent person
373.009	if you're not able to speak
373.009	and you can't see.
375.76	So they figured not being able
375.76	to see is one thing,
378.701	but they need to get me to talk.
380.76	So while Sally, the office manager,
383.76	was teaching me to speak in the day --
385.68	it's hard, because when you're a kid,
385.68	you take things for granted.
389.829	You learn things unconsciously.
391.55	But for me, I was an adult
391.55	and it was embarrassing,
395.041	and I had to learn how to coordinate
395.041	my new throat with my tongue
398.967	and my new teeth and my lips,
401.76	and capture the air and get the word out.
404.255	So, I acted like a two-year-old,
406.107	and refused to work.
409.412	But the men had a better idea.
411.924	They were going to make it fun for me.
414.27	So they were teaching me
414.27	cuss-word Scrabble at night.
418.069	(Laughter)
422.372	And then, secretly,
422.372	how to swear like a sailor.
426.026	(Laughter)
427.063	I'm going to just leave it
427.063	to your imagination
430.895	as to what my first words were --
433.435	(Laughter)
434.45	when Sally finally got
434.45	my confidence built.
437.451	(Laughter)
439.664	So I moved on from there.
441.688	And a former teacher
441.688	who happened to have Alzheimer's
444.888	took on the task of teaching me to write.
448.616	The redundancy was actually good for me.
450.957	So, we'll just keep moving on.
452.76	(Laughter)
459.629	One of the pivotal times for me
461.848	was actually learning
461.848	to cross the street again
464.539	as a blind person.
467.26	So close your eyes.
469.521	Now imagine you have to cross a street.
472.439	You don't know how far that street is,
476.121	and you don't know
476.121	if you're going straight.
478.76	And you hear cars whizzing back and forth,
482.168	and you had a horrible accident
483.76	that landed you in this situation.
486.553	So there were two obstacles
486.553	I had to get through.
489.76	One was post-traumatic stress disorder.
493.192	Every time I approached
493.192	the corner or the curb,
496.977	I would panic.
498.288	And the second one
500.113	was actually trying to figure out
500.113	how to cross that street.
503.76	So one of the seniors just came up to me,
506.67	and she pushed me
506.67	up to the corner and said,
510.026	"""When you think it's time to go,"
510.026	just stick the cane out there.
513.045	"If it's hit, don't cross the street."""
514.896	(Laughter)
520.415	Made perfect sense.
521.864	(Laughter)
523.025	But by the third cane
523.025	that went whizzing across the road --
526.638	(Laughter)
528.013	they realized that they needed
528.013	to put their resources together,
531.094	and they raised funds
532.588	so that I could go
532.588	to the Braille Institute
534.699	and actually gain the skills
534.699	to be a blind person,
539.32	and also to go get a guide dog,
541.342	who transformed my life.
543.215	And I was able to return to college
545.008	because of the senior citizens
545.008	who invested in me,
548.76	and also the guide dog
548.76	and skill set I had gained.
552.76	Ten years later, I gained my sight back.
555.054	Not magically --
557.125	I opted in for three surgeries,
560.118	and one of them was experimental.
562.012	It was actually robotic surgery
563.76	that removed a hematoma
563.76	from behind my eye.
568.356	The biggest change for me
568.356	was that the world moved forward,
573.209	that there were innovations
573.209	and all kinds of new things --
577.275	cellphones, laptops,
579.228	all these things
579.228	that I had never seen before.
581.899	And as a blind person,
583.575	your visual memory fades,
586.118	and is replaced with how you
586.118	feel about things
590.16	and how things sound
592.003	and how things smell.
594.76	So one day, I was in my room
597.27	and I saw this thing sitting in my room.
599.367	I thought it was a monster,
600.76	so I was walking around it.
602.899	"And I go, ""I'm just going to touch it."""
604.925	And I touched it and I went,
606.331	"""Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."""
609.592	(Laughter)
613.477	Everything is different
613.477	when you're a sighted person,
617.537	because you take that for granted.
619.223	But when you're blind,
619.223	you have the tactile memory for things.
624.075	The biggest change for me
624.075	was looking down at my hands
626.648	and seeing that I'd lost
630.561	I thought that time
630.561	had stood still for some reason
633.644	and moved on for family and friends.
635.502	But when I looked down,
637.01	I realized that time
637.01	marched on for me, too,
639.604	and that I needed to get caught up.
641.352	So I got going on it.
644.427	"We didn't have words like ""crowdsourcing"""
644.427	"and ""radical collaboration"""
648.371	when I had my accident.
650.113	But the concept held true --
651.9	people working with people to rebuild me;
654.337	people working with people
654.337	to reeducate me.
657.17	I wouldn't be standing here today
659.011	if it wasn't for extreme
659.011	radical collaboration.
662.76	Thank you so much.
664.078	(Applause)
