12.988	I've been thinking a lot about the world recently
16.045	and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
19.732	Twenty or 30 years ago,
22.151	if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died
24.681	in a remote village in East Asia,
26.65	it would have been a tragedy for the chicken
29.02	and its closest relatives,
30.217	but I don't think there was much possibility
32.425	of us fearing a global pandemic
35.1	and the deaths of millions.
37.093	Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America
39.821	lent too much money to some people
41.966	who couldn't afford to pay it back
43.987	and the bank went bust,
45.719	that was bad for the lender
46.736	and bad for the borrower,
48.368	but we didn't imagine it would bring
50.231	the global economic system to its knees
52.446	for nearly a decade.
55.248	This is globalization.
56.834	This is the miracle that has enabled us
59.32	to transship our bodies and our minds
62.414	and our words and our pictures and our ideas
64.776	and our teaching and our learning around the planet
67.961	ever faster and ever cheaper.
70.969	It's brought a lot of bad stuff,
72.457	like the stuff that I just described,
74.101	but it's also brought a lot of good stuff.
76.703	A lot of us are not aware
78.293	of the extraordinary successes of
78.293	the Millennium Development Goals,
82.27	several of which have achieved their targets
84	long before the due date.
85.687	That proves that this species of humanity
88.702	is capable of achieving extraordinary progress
91.706	if it really acts together and it really tries hard.
96.156	But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days,
98.473	I sort of feel that globalization
101.371	has taken us by surprise,
103.214	and we've been slow to respond to it.
105.994	If you look at the downside of globalization,
108.225	it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.
111.177	All of the grand challenges that we face today,
113.286	like climate change and human rights
116.443	and demographics and terrorism and pandemics
120.741	and narco-trafficking and human slavery
123.384	and species loss, I could go on,
126.104	we're not making an awful lot of progress
128.06	against an awful lot of those challenges.
130.442	So in a nutshell, that's the challenge
132.305	that we all face today
133.744	at this interesting point in history.
136.242	That's clearly what we've got to do next.
138.144	We've somehow got to get our act together
141.19	and we've got to figure out how to globalize
143.068	the solutions better
145.003	so that we don't simply become a species
147.547	which is the victim of the globalization of problems.
152.463	Why are we so slow at achieving these advances?
156.11	What's the reason for it?
158.267	Well, there are, of course, a number of reasons,
160.211	but perhaps the primary reason
162.722	is because we're still organized as a species
166.176	in the same way that we were organized
170.45	There's one superpower left on the planet
172.138	and that is the seven billion people,
174.21	the seven billion of us who cause all these problems,
176.6	the same seven billion, by the way,
178.483	who will resolve them all.
180.323	But how are those seven billion organized?
182.762	They're still organized in 200 or so nation-states,
186.452	and the nations have governments
188.949	that make rules
190.764	and cause us to behave in certain ways.
193.696	And that's a pretty efficient system,
195.586	but the problem is that the
195.586	way that those laws are made
198.567	and the way those governments think
201.132	is absolutely wrong for the
201.132	solution of global problems,
203.618	because it all looks inwards.
206.229	The politicians that we elect
207.818	and the politicians we don't elect, on the whole,
210.21	have minds that microscope.
211.709	They don't have minds that telescope.
214.409	They look in. They pretend, they behave,
217.876	as if they believed that every country was an island
222.27	that existed quite happily, independently
224.251	of all the others
225.726	on its own little planet
227.543	in its own little solar system.
229.495	This is the problem:
231.298	countries competing against each other,
233.416	countries fighting against each other.
235.218	This week, as any week you care to look at,
236.949	you'll find people actually trying to kill
236.949	each other from country to country,
240.382	but even when that's not going on,
242.203	there's competition between countries,
244.138	each one trying to shaft the next.
246.75	This is clearly not a good arrangement.
248.829	We clearly need to change it.
250.79	We clearly need to find ways
252.768	of encouraging countries to start working together
255.413	a little bit better.
257.024	And why won't they do that?
259.294	Why is it that our leaders still persist in looking inwards?
263.422	Well, the first and most obvious reason
265.138	is because that's what we ask them to do.
267.051	That's what we tell them to do.
268.735	When we elect governments
270.155	or when we tolerate unelected governments,
272.686	we're effectively telling them that what we want
275.162	is for them to deliver us in our country
277.845	a certain number of things.
279.578	We want them to deliver prosperity,
282.533	growth, competitiveness, transparency, justice
287.299	and all of those things.
288.974	So unless we start asking our governments
291.244	to think outside a little bit,
293.525	to consider the global problems that will finish us all
295.977	if we don't start considering them,
297.936	then we can hardly blame them
300.254	if what they carry on doing is looking inwards,
302.969	if they still have minds that microscope
304.781	rather than minds that telescope.
306.707	That's the first reason why
306.707	things tend not to change.
309.645	The second reason is that these governments,
312.899	just like all the rest of us,
314.725	are cultural psychopaths.
317.35	I don't mean to be rude,
318.657	but you know what a psychopath is.
320.064	A psychopath is a person who,
321.792	unfortunately for him or her,
323.329	lacks the ability to really empathize
325.368	with other human beings.
327.181	When they look around,
328.32	they don't see other human beings
329.982	with deep, rich, three-dimensional personal lives
333.096	and aims and ambitions.
334.224	What they see is cardboard cutouts,
337.221	and it's very sad and it's very lonely,
339.794	and it's very rare, fortunately.
342.532	But actually, aren't most of us
345.687	not really so very good at empathy?
347.926	Oh sure, we're very good at empathy
349.147	when it's a question of dealing with people
350.9	who kind of look like us
352.327	and kind of walk and talk and eat and pray
354.809	and wear like us,
356.491	but when it comes to people who don't do that,
358.512	who don't quite dress like us
359.929	and don't quite pray like us
361.776	and don't quite talk like us,
364.181	do we not also have a tendency to see them
366.06	ever so slightly as cardboard cutouts too?
369.486	And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.
371.194	I think constantly we have to monitor it.
373.68	Are we and our politicians to a degree
376.774	cultural psychopaths?
379.16	The third reason is hardly worth mentioning
380.808	because it's so silly,
382.259	but there's a belief amongst governments
384.199	that the domestic agenda
385.713	and the international agenda
387.22	are incompatible and always will be.
389.92	This is just nonsense.
391.83	In my day job, I'm a policy adviser.
393.308	I've spent the last 15 years or so
395.767	advising governments around the world,
397.577	and in all of that time I have never once seen
400.631	a single domestic policy issue
402.995	that could not be more imaginatively,
405.744	effectively and rapidly resolved
408.128	than by treating it as an international problem,
410.732	looking at the international context,
412.523	comparing what others have done,
414.318	bringing in others, working externally
417.277	instead of working internally.
420.644	And so you may say, well, given all of that,
423.866	why then doesn't it work?
425.535	Why can we not make our politicians change?
427.916	Why can't we demand them?
430.238	Well I, like a lot of us, spend
430.238	a lot of time complaining
433.116	about how hard it is to make people change,
435.469	and I don't think we should fuss about it.
437.248	I think we should just accept
438.844	that we are an inherently conservative species.
441.615	We don't like to change.
443.408	It exists for very sensible evolutionary reasons.
446.352	We probably wouldn't still be here today
449.119	if we weren't so resistant to change.
451.189	It's very simple: Many thousands of years ago,
453.742	we discovered that if we carried on
455.688	doing the same things, we wouldn't die,
458.118	because the things that we've done before
459.96	by definition didn't kill us,
461.538	and therefore as long as we carry on doing them,
463.615	we'll be okay,
465.022	and it's very sensible not to do anything new,
466.69	because it might kill you.
469.15	But of course, there are exceptions to that.
471.432	Otherwise, we'd never get anywhere.
473.934	And one of the exceptions, the interesting exception,
475.7	is when you can show to people
477.414	that there might be some self-interest
479.762	in them making that leap of faith
481.449	and changing a little bit.
483.716	So I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years
486.118	trying to find out what could be that self-interest
489.256	that would encourage not just politicians
491.405	but also businesses and general populations,
493.958	all of us, to start to think a little more outwardly,
496.973	to think in a bigger picture,
499.212	not always to look inwards,
499.212	sometimes to look outwards.
502.554	And this is where I discovered
504.645	something quite important.
507.12	In 2005, I launched a study
510.68	called the Nation Brands Index.
513.27	What it is, it's a very large-scale study that polls
515.778	a very large sample of the world's population,
517.865	a sample that represents about 70 percent
520.362	of the planet's population,
523.591	and I started asking them a series of questions
525.627	about how they perceive other countries.
528.511	And the Nation Brands Index over the years
530.155	has grown to be a very, very large database.
532.658	It's about 200 billion data points
535.09	tracking what ordinary people
535.09	think about other countries
537.666	and why.
539.649	Why did I do this? Well, because
539.649	the governments that I advise
542.411	are very, very keen on knowing
543.716	how they are regarded.
545.331	They've known, partly because
546.776	I've encouraged them to realize it,
548.654	that countries depend
550.252	enormously on their reputations
551.808	in order to survive and prosper in the world.
554.755	If a country has a great, positive image,
557.004	like Germany has or Sweden or Switzerland,
559.521	everything is easy and everything is cheap.
561.616	You get more tourists. You get more investors.
563.852	You sell your products more expensively.
565.899	If, on the other hand, you have a country
567.857	with a very weak or a very negative image,
569.87	everything is difficult and everything is expensive.
572.3	So governments care desperately
574.201	about the image of their country,
575.466	because it makes a direct difference
577.6	to how much money they can make,
579.241	and that's what they've promised their populations
580.95	they're going to deliver.
583.307	So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take
585.27	some time out and speak to that gigantic database
588.499	and ask it,
590.706	why do some people prefer one country
592.598	more than another?
594.361	And the answer that the database gave me
595.9	completely staggered me.
597.596	It was 6.8.
599.785	I haven't got time to explain in detail.
601.874	Basically what it told me was —
604.23	(Laughter) (Applause) —
608.452	the kinds of countries we prefer are good countries.
612.684	We don't admire countries
612.684	primarily because they're rich,
615.505	because they're powerful,
615.505	because they're successful,
617.529	because they're modern, because
617.529	they're technologically advanced.
620.893	We primarily admire countries that are good.
623.746	What do we mean by good?
625.109	We mean countries that seem to contribute
626.78	something to the world in which we live,
629.349	countries that actually make the world safer
631.908	or better or richer or fairer.
634.485	Those are the countries we like.
635.95	This is a discovery of significant importance —
638.471	you see where I'm going —
639.824	because it squares the circle.
641.691	I can now say, and often do, to any government,
644.563	in order to do well, you need to do good.
647.421	If you want to sell more products,
648.916	if you want to get more investment,
650.452	if you want to become more competitive,
653.45	then you need to start behaving,
655.115	because that's why people will respect you
656.758	and do business with you,
658.827	and therefore, the more you collaborate,
661.91	the more competitive you become.
664.755	This is quite an important discovery,
666.533	and as soon as I discovered this,
667.613	I felt another index coming on.
669.858	I swear that as I get older, my ideas become simpler
672.204	and more and more childish.
673.5	This one is called the Good Country Index,
677.468	and it does exactly what it says on the tin.
681.521	It measures, or at least it tries to measure,
683.875	exactly how much each country on Earth contributes
686.638	not to its own population but to the rest of humanity.
689.793	Bizarrely, nobody had ever thought
691.06	of measuring this before.
692.749	So my colleague Dr. Robert Govers and I have spent
694.796	the best part of the last two years,
696.539	with the help of a large number
696.539	of very serious and clever people,
700.193	cramming together all the reliable data in the world
702.879	we could find about what countries give
705.522	to the world.
707.115	And you're waiting for me to
707.115	tell you which one comes top.
709.493	And I'm going to tell you,
711.221	but first of all I want to tell you
712.751	precisely what I mean
715.456	when I say a good country.
717.515	I do not mean morally good.
719.739	When I say that Country X
721.701	is the goodest country on Earth,
723.714	and I mean goodest, I don't mean best.
725.023	Best is something different.
726.476	When you're talking about a good country,
727.77	you can be good, gooder and goodest.
729.904	It's not the same thing as good, better and best.
733.376	This is a country which simply gives more
735.877	to humanity than any other country.
738.203	I don't talk about how they behave at home
739.945	because that's measured elsewhere.
742.345	And the winner is
744.405	Ireland.
746.216	(Applause)
751.89	According to the data here,
753.795	no country on Earth, per head of population,
756.685	per dollar of GDP, contributes more
759.61	to the world that we live in than Ireland.
761.246	What does this mean?
762.341	This means that as we go to sleep at night,
764.563	all of us in the last 15 seconds
764.563	before we drift off to sleep,
767.631	our final thought should be,
769.626	godammit, I'm glad that Ireland exists.
771.943	(Laughter)
774.141	And that — (Applause) —
781.238	In the depths of a very severe economic recession,
784.238	I think that there's a really important lesson there,
786.756	that if you can remember
786.756	your international obligations
788.872	whilst you are trying to rebuild your own economy,
790.842	that's really something.
791.88	Finland ranks pretty much the same.
793.535	The only reason why it's below Ireland
794.8	is because its lowest score is
794.8	lower than Ireland's lowest score.
797.883	Now the other thing you'll
797.883	notice about the top 10 there
799.68	is, of course, they're all, apart from New Zealand,
802.54	Western European nations.
804.25	They're also all rich.
805.93	This depressed me,
807.67	because one of the things that I did not want
809.182	to discover with this index
810.76	is that it's purely the province of rich countries
813.116	to help poor countries.
814.141	This is not what it's all about.
816.197	And indeed, if you look further down the list,
817.773	I don't have the slide here, you will see
820.099	something that made me very happy indeed,
822.388	that Kenya is in the top 30,
824.919	and that demonstrates one
824.919	very, very important thing.
827.804	This is not about money.
829.667	This is about attitude.
831.064	This is about culture.
832.53	This is about a government and a people that care
835.977	about the rest of the world
837.171	and have the imagination and the courage
839.163	to think outwards instead of only thinking selfishly.
842.4	I'm going to whip through the other slides
844.18	just so you can see some
844.18	of the lower-lying countries.
847.128	There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st,
850.41	Mexico comes 66th,
852.151	and then we have some of
852.151	the big developing countries,
854.269	like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.
857.409	Countries like China and Russia and India,
860.413	which is down in the same part of the index,
862.966	well, in some ways, it's not surprising.
865.319	They've spent a great deal of time
866.858	over the last decades building their own economy,
869.021	building their own society and their own polity,
871.707	but it is to be hoped
873.373	that the second phase of their growth
874.74	will be somewhat more outward-looking
876.725	than the first phase has been so far.
879.252	And then you can break down each country
881.36	in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.
884.716	I'll allow you to do that.
885.565	From midnight tonight it's going
885.565	to be on goodcountry.org,
888.227	and you can look at the country.
889.41	You can look right down to the
889.41	level of the individual datasets.
893.278	Now that's the Good Country Index.
895.496	What's it there for?
896.865	Well, it's there really because I want to try
899.15	to introduce this word,
901.601	or reintroduce this word, into the discourse.
905.924	I've had enough hearing about competitive countries.
908.113	I've had enough hearing about
909.908	prosperous, wealthy, fast-growing countries.
913.694	I've even had enough hearing about happy countries
916.942	because in the end that's still selfish.
918.983	That's still about us,
920.487	and if we carry on thinking about us,
922.355	we are in deep, deep trouble.
924.897	I think we all know what it is
926.528	that we want to hear about.
927.651	We want to hear about good countries,
930.696	and so I want to ask you all a favor.
934.326	I'm not asking a lot.
935.922	It's something that you might find easy to do
937.875	and you might even find enjoyable
938.9	and even helpful to do,
940.503	"and that's simply to start using the word ""good"""
943.785	in this context.
945.467	When you think about your own country,
947.654	when you think about other people's countries,
949.783	when you think about companies,
951.566	when you talk about the world that we live in today,
953.777	start using that word
955.675	in the way that I've talked about this evening.
958.443	Not good, the opposite of bad,
960.347	because that's an argument that never finishes.
962.623	Good, the opposite of selfish,
964.967	good being a country that thinks about all of us.
968.15	That's what I would like you to do,
969.56	and I'd like you to use it as a stick
970.945	with which to beat your politicians.
973.588	When you elect them, when you reelect them,
975.895	when you vote for them, when you listen
977.307	to what they're offering you,
979.842	"use that word, ""good,"""
981.554	and ask yourself,
983.038	"""Is that what a good country would do?"""
985.111	And if the answer is no, be very suspicious.
988.404	Ask yourself, is that the behavior
990.829	of my country?
992.265	Do I want to come from a country
994.397	where the government, in my name,
995.964	is doing things like that?
997.826	Or do I, on the other hand,
999.582	prefer the idea of walking around the world
1001.21	"with my head held high thinking, ""Yeah,"
1003.364	"I'm proud to come from a good country""?"
1005.855	And everybody will welcome you.
1007.843	And everybody in the last 15 seconds
1009.467	before they drift off to sleep at night will say,
1012.137	"""Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."""
1015.018	Ultimately, that, I think,
1017.205	is what will make the change.
1018.959	"That word, ""good,"""
1020.676	and the number 6.8
1022.323	and the discovery that's behind it
1024.581	have changed my life.
1026.249	I think they can change your life,
1028.136	and I think we can use it to change
1029.995	the way that our politicians
1029.995	and our companies behave,
1032.415	and in doing so, we can change the world.
1036.28	I've started thinking very differently about
1037.83	my own country since I've been
1037.83	thinking about these things.
1040.523	I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country,
1042.61	and then I started thinking I
1042.61	wanted to live in a happy country,
1045.01	but I began to realize, it's not enough.
1047.624	I don't want to live in a rich country.
1049.669	I don't want to live in a fast-growing
1051.602	or competitive country.
1054.285	I want to live in a good country,
1057.403	and I so, so hope that you do too.
1060.896	Thank you.
1063.48	(Applause)
