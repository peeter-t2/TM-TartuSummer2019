25	I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,
29	asking you to join me by stepping off the land
33	and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
43	and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
48	And it's a lively and a lovely place,
51	but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --
55	not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,
60	our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,
65	but also, most recently, with climate change,
67	and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
70	Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,
73	more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating
78	will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
83	And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
86	Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,
90	and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,
95	but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi
100	is just not going to fill you up.
102	About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
107	So it may be good for the waistline,
109	but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
112	And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish
117	isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,
120	that is, unless you eat jellyfish.
123	And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack
127	on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
131	And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,
137	whose primary prey are jellyfish.
140	"This animal is in ""The Guinness World Book of Records"""
142	for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
144	It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
151	And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here
155	that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --
158	that its favorite food is the moon jelly.
162	So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,
166	even if one is eating the other.
171	Now this is typically how you see sunfish,
174	this is where they get their common name.
176	They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
178	They just lay out on the surface of the sea
181	and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,
185	they lie out and bask on the surface.
188	Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,
191	but it's actually Latin for millstone,
194	and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
200	It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
204	And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,
208	was this terribly bizarre shape.
211	You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,
216	and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --
219	they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,
223	and then you look at the sunfish.
226	(Laughter)
228	And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --
235	it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
242	So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
248	Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense
251	except in the light of evolution.
253	The Mola's no exception.
255	They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,
263	and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --
269	oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
272	Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,
275	about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction
279	that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --
281	we're going to head to the high seas.
283	And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,
288	and we turn our puffer into the Mola.
290	You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
298	They look -- maybe they look
300	kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,
304	but in fact, in fact they are the --
308	they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,
314	right up there with flat fish.
317	They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.
321	And in terms of fishes --
323	fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,
329	just 50 million years ago, so --
333	so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
338	They start as little eggs,
340	"and they're in ""The Guinness World Book of Records"" again"
342	for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
346	A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,
352	can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --
355	and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
360	And from that little egg,
362	they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,
367	and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.
370	They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
377	That's a little diver up there in the corner.
380	"They're in ""The Guinness World Book of Records"" again"
383	for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
386	From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage
390	till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
402	and you had to feed this thing.
406	That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
413	Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --
416	we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,
422	but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --
425	one of the first places to have them in captivity --
427	they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
431	I said, now, that's a true American.
434	(Laughter)
438	(Applause)
440	So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,
444	because schooling used to be salvation for fishes,
447	but it's suicide for fishes now.
450	But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,
452	they still get caught in nets as by-catch.
454	If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,
459	then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --
461	how they live their lives, like the Mola.
463	And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --
468	up to 26 percent of the drift net.
470	And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,
475	they make up up to 90 percent.
479	So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
482	And how do you do that?
484	How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
487	This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.
491	How do you get insight?
493	How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
498	Well, there's some great new technology
501	that has just recently become available,
503	and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
507	And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
511	That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,
516	which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
520	And it can record this data for up to two years,
524	and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,
528	float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,
532	to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,
535	and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --
539	we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
544	So the great thing about the Mola
546	is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --
549	that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
551	And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
555	Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
558	They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
562	I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
564	But they have 40 genera of parasites,
567	and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
571	And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
576	They don't seem to mind, so far.
579	So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
583	We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
587	And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,
590	using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
596	We'd love to tag in Monterey.
598	Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
602	Not this time of year -- it's more around October.
605	And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --
608	but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this
612	because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
616	The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,
620	rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,
625	and then tosses them back and forth.
627	And I'm not exaggerating, it is just --
630	and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
633	And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,
638	it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
643	The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,
646	so we head down south, to San Diego.
650	Not so many California sea lions down there.
652	And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,
655	and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
658	And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there
661	because it's spa time for the Molas there.
665	As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
669	And they come and give the Molas --
671	you can see they strike this funny little position that says,
674	"""I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."""
676	(Laughter)
680	And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,
684	and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --
688	because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
692	And it's also a great place to go down south
694	because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
698	I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,
701	"will say, ""Okay, scratch me right there."""
703	You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --
706	and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
712	So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;
714	we've gone over to another part of the Pacific,
716	and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
720	And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
725	And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
728	We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
733	Well, not the one we tagged!
736	And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,
739	to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
752	So the hardest part of tagging, now, is
756	after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
761	And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,
765	I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out
769	during the course that the tag is recording.
772	The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,
778	so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
781	And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
784	I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
786	And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
791	And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,
795	we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
798	Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
800	And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
805	They're not big migrators. This is their track:
807	we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month
811	kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
816	And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
820	And that's kind of their home range.
822	Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,
826	that population doesn't get replenished.
829	So that's a very important piece of data.
831	But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
837	They're super industrious.
839	And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --
842	they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up
846	and up and down, up to 40 times a day.
848	As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
853	Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
857	They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,
863	and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.
867	They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,
869	and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
872	And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --
875	which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
880	So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,
884	they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance
887	between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
892	We see the same pattern -- now with these tags
895	we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,
899	a real three-dimensional play.
904	This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,
907	where they're going to be tagging all over the world
910	and the Mola's going to enter into that.
912	And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know
915	the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,
918	and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
921	Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals
925	and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
930	It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
936	Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
940	I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
948	And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,
952	and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
956	But people would write into the site with all sorts of,
960	all sorts of stories about these animals
963	and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
967	And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --
974	a shared love and an interest in the oceans.
977	I was getting reports from Catholic nuns,
981	Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,
986	united by their love of life.
990	And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:
996	"""One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."""
1000	And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
1004	If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
