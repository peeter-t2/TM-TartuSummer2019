13.389	So when I do my job, people hate me.
16.786	In fact, the better I do my job,
19.34	the more people hate me.
21.145	And no, I'm not a meter maid,
23.096	and I'm not an undertaker.
25.13	I am a progressive, lesbian
25.13	talking head on Fox News.
29.076	(Applause)
31.163	So y'all heard that, right?
31.163	Just to make sure, right?
33.679	I am a gay talking head on Fox News.
36.906	I am going to tell you how I do it,
38.621	and the most important thing I've learned.
40.842	So I go on television.
42.544	I debate people who literally want
42.544	to obliterate everything I believe in --
46.664	in some cases, who don't want
46.664	me and people like me to even exist.
50.877	It's sort of like Thanksgiving
50.877	with your conservative uncle
54.008	on steroids,
55.537	with a live television
55.537	audience of millions.
58.933	It's totally almost just like that.
61.242	And that's just on air.
63.387	The hate mail I get is unbelievable.
65.671	Last week alone, I got 238
65.671	pieces of nasty email
70.801	and more hate tweets
70.801	than I can even count.
73.718	I was called an idiot,
73.718	a traitor, a scourge,
77.107	a cunt and an ugly man,
79.715	and that was just in one email.
81.377	(Laughter)
84.195	So what have I realized,
86.978	being on the receiving end
86.978	of all this ugliness?
89.739	Well, my biggest takeaway
91.398	is that for decades, we've been focused
91.398	on political correctness,
95.633	but what matters more
95.633	is emotional correctness.
99.993	Let me give you a small example.
101.842	I don't care if you call me a dyke.
101.842	I really don't.
104.687	I care about two things.
106.07	One, I care that you spell it right.
108.728	(Laughter) (Applause)
113.706	Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
117.358	You'd totally be surprised.
120.247	And second, I don't care about the word,
120.247	I care about how you use it.
123.518	Are you being friendly?
123.518	Are you just being naive?
125.997	Or do you really want
125.997	to hurt me personally?
129.885	Emotional correctness
129.885	is the tone, the feeling,
134.407	how we say what we say,
136.392	the respect and compassion
136.392	we show one another.
139.751	And what I've realized
139.751	is that political persuasion
142.424	doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.
146.335	Political persuasion begins
146.335	with being emotionally correct.
150.68	So when I first went
150.68	to go work at Fox News,
153.241	true confession,
154.718	I expected there to be marks in the carpet
157.384	from all the knuckle-dragging.
159.93	That, by the way, in case you're paying
159.93	attention, is not emotionally correct.
163.63	But liberals on my side,
167.033	we can be self-righteous,
167.033	we can be condescending,
170.588	we can be dismissive of anyone
170.588	who doesn't agree with us.
173.385	In other words, we can
173.385	be politically right
176.199	but emotionally wrong.
179.068	And incidentally, that means that
179.068	people don't like us. Right?
185.087	Now here's the kicker.
187.003	Conservatives are really nice.
189.611	I mean, not all of them,
191.092	and not the ones who send me hate mail,
192.977	but you would be surprised.
194.616	Sean Hannity is one of
194.616	the sweetest guys I've ever met.
198.91	He spends his free time
198.91	trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,
203.089	and I know that if I ever had a problem,
205.187	he would do anything he could to help.
207.896	Now, I think Sean Hannity
207.896	is 99 percent politically wrong,
213.057	but his emotional correctness
213.057	is strikingly impressive.
216.458	And that's why people listen to him.
218.46	Because you can't get
218.46	anyone to agree with you
221.016	if they don't even listen to you first.
223.792	We spend so much time
223.792	talking past each other
226.828	and not enough time talking
226.828	through our disagreements.
229.871	And if we can start to find
229.871	compassion for one another,
233.71	then we have a shot
233.71	at building common ground.
237.792	It actually sounds really hokey
237.792	to say it standing up here,
241.284	but when you try to put it in practice,
243.487	it's really powerful.
245.345	So someone who says they hate immigrants,
248.224	I try to imagine how scared they must be
250.687	that their community is changing
250.687	from what they've always known.
253.759	Or someone who says they
253.759	don't like teachers' unions,
257.237	I bet they're really devastated to see
257.237	their kid's school going into the gutter,
261.031	and they're just looking
261.031	for someone to blame.
263.879	Our challenge is to find
263.879	the compassion for others
268.13	that we want them to have for us.
270.69	That is emotional correctness.
273.737	I'm not saying it's easy.
275.267	An average of, like, 5.6 times per day
278.341	I have to stop myself from responding
278.341	to all of my hate mail
281.183	with a flurry of vile profanities.
283.949	This whole finding compassion
283.949	and common ground with your enemies thing
290.172	is kind of like a political-spiritual
290.172	practice for me,
293.584	and I ain't the Dalai Lama.
296.516	I'm not perfect,
296.516	but what I am is optimistic.
302.381	Because I don't just get hate mail.
304.791	I get a lot of really nice
304.791	letters, lots of them.
308.039	And one of my all-time favorites begins:
310.601	"""I am not a big fan"
310.601	of your political leanings
313.294	or your sometimes tortured logic,
315.569	(Laughter)
319.222	"but I'm a big fan of you as a person."""
322.611	Now this guy doesn't
322.611	agree with me -- yet.
325.94	(Laughter)
329.456	But he's listening --
331.719	not because of what I said,
331.719	but because of how I said it.
335.084	And somehow, even though we've never met,
335.084	we've managed to form a connection.
339.083	That's emotional correctness,
341.313	and that's how we start the conversations
344.102	that really lead to change.
345.962	Thank you.
347.14	(Applause)
