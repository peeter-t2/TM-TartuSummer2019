25.666	I would like to tell you about a project
25.666	which I started about 16 years ago.
32.69	It's about making new forms of life.
37.388	And these are made of this kind of tube --
41	electricity tube, we call it in Holland.
44	And we can start a film about that,
48	and we can see a little bit
48	backwards in time.
52.731	(Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beasts
52.731	are going to live in herds on the beaches.
57	Theo Jansen is working hard
57	on this evolution.
63.209	Theo Jansen: I want to put
63.209	these forms of life on the beaches.
69	And they should survive over there,
72	on their own, in the future.
76	Learning to live on their own --
79.928	and it'll take couple of more years
84.579	to let them walk on their own.
89.698	Narrator: The mechanical beasts
89.698	will not get their energy from food,
93.025	but from the wind.
95	The wind will move feathers on their back,
95	which will drive their feet.
98.968	The beast walks sideways
98.968	on the wet sand of the beach,
102.753	with its nose pointed into the wind.
106.904	As soon as it walks into
106.904	either the rolling surf or the dry sand,
111.736	it stops, and walks
111.736	in the opposite direction.
117.197	Evolution has generated many species.
120.848	(Music)
134	This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa.
137.229	(Music)
144.026	(Laughter)
147	(Applause)
155.77	TJ: This is a herd, and it is built
155.77	according to genetic codes.
162	And it is a sort of race,
162	and each and every animal is different,
166	and the winning codes will multiply.
169.195	This is the wave,
169.195	going from left to right.
171.973	You can see this one.
177.416	Yes, and now it goes from left to right.
180.884	This is a new generation, a new family,
183.69	which is able to store the wind.
186.888	So, the wings pump up air
186.888	in lemonade bottles,
190.339	which are on top of that.
192.213	And they can use that energy
192.213	in case the wind falls away,
198.001	and the tide is coming up,
199.516	and there is still a little bit of energy
199.516	to reach the dunes and save their lives,
205.325	because they are drowned very easily.
207.349	(Laughter)
212.797	I could show you this animal.
222.78	(Applause)
225.335	Thank you.
226.562	(Applause)
231	So, the proportion of the tubes in this
231	animal is very important for the walking.
237.466	There are 11 numbers,
237.466	which I call The 11 Holy Numbers.
241.102	These are the distances of the tubes
241.102	which make it walk that way.
246	In fact, it's a new
246	invention of the wheel.
249.429	It works the same as a wheel.
251	The axis of a wheel
251	stays on the same level,
254.491	and this hip is staying
254.491	on the same level as well.
258.333	In fact, this is better than a wheel,
260.527	because when you try to drive
260.527	your bicycle on the beach,
265	you will notice it's very hard to do.
268.776	And the feet just step over the sand,
273.689	and the wheel has to touch every piece
273.689	of the ground in-between.
278.228	So 5,000 years after
278.228	the invention of the wheel,
282.173	we have a new wheel.
284.141	I will show you, in the next video --
286	can you start it, please? --
289.498	that very heavy loads can be moved.
296.083	There's a guy pushing there, behind,
299	but it can also walk
299	on the wind very well.
302	It's 3.2 tons.
307.416	This is working on the stored
307.416	wind in the bottles.
313.817	It has a feeler, where it can
313.817	feel obstacles and turn around.
317.809	You see, it's going the other way.
331.098	Can I have the feeler here?
338.541	OK. Good.
342.826	So, they have to survive
342.826	all the dangers of the beach,
348.307	and one of the big dangers is the sea.
350.223	This is the sea.
352.113	And it must feel the water of the sea.
355.842	And this is the water feeler,
358	and what's very important is this tube.
360.693	It sucks in air normally,
365	but when it swallows water,
365	it feels the resistance of it.
369.809	So, imagine that the animal
369.809	is walking towards the sea.
377.761	As soon as it touches the water --
380.023	you should hear a sound of running air.
391.235	(Sound of running air)
392.315	Yes!
396.627	So if it doesn't feel,
396.627	it will be drowned, OK?
407.178	Here we have the brain of the animal.
410.903	In fact, it is a step counter,
410.903	and it counts the steps.
415.468	It's a binary step counter.
417.587	So as soon it has been to the sea,
420.654	it changes the pattern
420.654	of zeroes and ones here.
428.291	And it always knows
428.291	where it is on the beach.
430.918	So it's very simple brain.
433.654	It says, well, there's the sea,
433.654	there are dunes, and I'm here.
437.825	So it's a sort of imagination
437.825	of the simple world of the beach animal.
443.793	Thank you.
446.571	One of the biggest enemies are the storms.
454	This is a part of the nose
454	of the Animaris Percipiere.
462.285	When the nose of the animal
462.285	is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.
467.745	So when the storm is coming up,
472.07	it drives a pin into the ground.
476.483	(Laughter)
479.023	Audience member: Wow!
480.212	The nose is fixed,
480.212	the whole animal is fixed.
482.358	The wind may turn, but the animal
482.358	will always turn its nose into the wind.
489.308	Now, another couple of years, and these
489.308	animals will survive on their own.
495.277	I still have to help them a lot.
497.5	Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
499.531	(Applause)
