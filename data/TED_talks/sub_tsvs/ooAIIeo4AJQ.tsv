16.26	It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
18.26	And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
21.26	And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,
24.26	but what I'm going to try to say is that
26.26	even in that complexity,
28.26	there's some simple themes that I think,
30.26	if we understand, we can really move forward.
33.26	And those simple themes aren't really
35.26	themes about the complex science of what's going on,
37.26	but things that we all pretty well know.
39.26	And I'm going to start with this one:
41.26	If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
44.26	We know that, right? We've experienced that.
47.26	And if we just take that
49.26	and we build from there,
51.26	then we can go to the next step,
53.26	which is that if the ocean ain't happy,
56.26	ain't nobody happy.
58.26	That's the theme of my talk.
60.26	And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
63.26	This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
66.26	Cannery Row, at the time,
68.26	had the biggest industrial
70.26	canning operation on the west coast.
72.26	We piled enormous amounts of pollution
75.26	into the air and into the water.
77.26	Rolf Bolin, who was a professor
79.26	at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,
81.26	wrote in the 1940s that
83.26	"""The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay"
86.26	were so bad they turned
88.26	"lead-based paints black."""
90.26	People working in these canneries
92.26	could barely stay there all day because of the smell,
95.26	but you know what they came out saying?
97.26	"They say, ""You know what you smell?"
99.26	"You smell money."""
101.26	That pollution was money to that community,
104.26	and those people dealt with the pollution
106.26	and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies
109.26	because they needed the money.
111.26	We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,
114.26	and we made them unhealthy.
117.26	The connection between ocean health and human health
119.26	is actually based upon another couple simple adages,
122.26	and I want to call that
124.26	"""pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."""
126.26	The pyramid of ocean life ...
128.26	Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --
131.26	we look at the ocean in a very different way,
133.26	and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
136.26	because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,
138.26	we see all those interconnections.
140.26	We see the base of the food chain,
142.26	the plankton, the small things,
144.26	and we see how those animals
146.26	are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,
149.26	and on so up this diagram.
153.26	And that flow, that flow of life,
155.26	from the very base up to the very top,
157.26	is the flow that ecologists see.
159.26	And that's what we're trying to preserve
161.26	"when we say, ""Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."""
164.26	It's that pyramid.
166.26	Now why does that matter for human health?
169.26	Because when we jam things in the bottom
171.26	of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,
173.26	some very frightening things happen.
176.26	Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:
179.26	molecules like PCBs
181.26	that can't be broken down by our bodies.
183.26	And they go in the base of that pyramid,
185.26	and they drift up; they're passed up that way,
188.26	on to predators and on to the top predators,
190.26	and in so doing,
192.26	they accumulate.
194.26	Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
196.26	We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
198.26	It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
200.26	Imagine that when we got on this boat,
203.26	we were all given
205.26	two Styrofoam peanuts.
207.26	Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
209.26	Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,
212.26	you give them the drink,
214.26	and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
216.26	What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts
218.26	will start moving through our society here,
220.26	and they will accumulate in
222.26	the drunkest, stingiest people.
224.26	(Laughter)
229.26	There's no mechanism in this game
231.26	for them to go anywhere but into
233.26	a bigger and bigger pile
235.26	of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
237.26	And that's exactly what happens with PDBs
239.26	in this food pyramid:
241.26	They accumulate into the top of it.
244.26	Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,
246.26	we take these lovely little chocolates that we get
248.26	and we had those instead.
250.26	Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates
252.26	instead of passing them around,
254.26	and instead of accumulating,
256.26	they will just pass into our group here
259.26	and not accumulate in any one group
261.26	because they're absorbed by us.
263.26	And that's the difference between a PCB
265.26	and, say, something natural like an omega-3,
267.26	something we want out of the marine food chain.
271.26	PCBs accumulate.
273.26	We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
275.26	PCBs accumulate in dolphins
277.26	in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
280.26	They get into the food chain.
282.26	The dolphins eat the fish
284.26	that have PCBs from the plankton,
286.26	and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,
289.26	accumulate in these dolphins.
291.26	Now, a dolphin,
293.26	mother dolphin, any dolphin --
295.26	there's only one way
297.26	that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
299.26	And what's that?
301.26	In mother's milk.
303.26	Here's a diagram of the PCB load
305.26	of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
307.26	Adult males: a huge load.
309.26	Juveniles: a huge load.
311.26	Females after their first calf is already weaned:
313.26	a lower load.
315.26	Those females, they're not trying to.
317.26	Those females are passing the PCBs
319.26	in the fat of their own mother's milk
322.26	into their offspring,
324.26	and their offspring don't survive.
327.26	The death rate in these dolphins,
329.26	for the first calf born of every female dolphin,
331.26	is 60 to 80 percent.
333.26	These mothers pump their first offspring
336.26	full of this pollutant,
338.26	and most of them die.
340.26	Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,
342.26	but what a terrible price to pay
344.26	for the accumulation of this pollutant
346.26	in these animals --
348.26	the death of the first-born calf.
351.26	There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.
354.26	That top predator, of course, is us.
356.26	And we also are eating meat
358.26	that comes from some of these same places.
360.26	This is whale meat
362.26	that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --
364.26	or is it?
366.26	In fact, what we did a few years ago
368.26	was learn how to smuggle
370.26	a molecular biology lab into Tokyo
372.26	and use it to genetically test the DNA
375.26	out of whale meat samples
377.26	and identify what they really were.
379.26	And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
381.26	Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
383.26	That's another story.
385.26	But some of them were not whale meat at all.
387.26	Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
390.26	Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
393.26	And those dolphin parts
395.26	had a huge load of PCBs,
397.26	dioxins and heavy metals.
400.26	And that huge load was passing into the people
402.26	that ate this meat.
404.26	It turns out that a lot of dolphins
406.26	are being sold as meat
408.26	in the whale meat market around the world.
410.26	That's a tragedy for those populations,
412.26	but it's also a tragedy
414.26	for the people eating them
416.26	because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
419.26	We had these data a few years ago.
422.26	I remember sitting at my desk
424.26	being about the only person in the world
426.26	who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets
429.26	was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
432.26	It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads
435.26	ever allowed by the EPA.
437.26	And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,
440.26	"""Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"""
443.26	but it was so awful.
445.26	And for the very first time in my scientific career,
447.26	I broke scientific protocol,
449.26	which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals
452.26	and then begin to talk about them.
454.26	We sent a very polite letter
456.26	to the Minister of Health in Japan
459.26	and simply pointed out that
462.26	this is an intolerable situation, not for us,
464.26	but for the people of Japan
466.26	because mothers who may be breastfeeding,
469.26	who may have young children,
471.26	would be buying something that they thought was healthy,
474.26	but it was really toxic.
476.26	That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,
479.26	and I'm really proud to say that at this point,
482.26	it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan
485.26	that's labeled incorrectly,
487.26	even though they're still selling whale meat,
489.26	which I believe they shouldn't.
491.26	But at least it's labeled correctly,
493.26	and you're no longer going to be buying
495.26	toxic dolphin meat instead.
498.26	It isn't just there that this happens,
501.26	but in a natural diet of some communities
503.26	in the Canadian arctic and in the United States
505.26	and in the European arctic,
507.26	a natural diet of seals and whales
510.26	leads to an accumulation of PCBs
512.26	that have gathered up from all parts of the world
515.26	and ended up in these women.
517.26	These women have toxic breast milk.
520.26	They cannot feed their offspring, their children,
523.26	their breast milk
525.26	because of the accumulation of these toxins
527.26	in their food chain,
529.26	in their part of the world's
531.26	ocean pyramid.
533.26	That means their immune systems are compromised.
536.26	It means that their children's development
538.26	can be compromised.
540.26	And the world's attention on this over the last decade
543.26	has reduced the problem
545.26	for these women,
547.26	not by changing the pyramid,
549.26	but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
551.26	We've taken them out of their natural pyramid
553.26	in order to solve this problem.
556.26	That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,
558.26	but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
560.26	There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
563.26	The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,
566.26	can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
569.26	And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer
572.26	in the base of that food pyramid,
574.26	it can back up all through it.
576.26	We end up with things we've heard about before:
578.26	red tides, for example,
580.26	which are blooms of toxic algae
582.26	floating through the oceans
584.26	causing neurological damage.
586.26	We can also see blooms of bacteria,
588.26	blooms of viruses in the ocean.
590.26	These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here
593.26	and a bacteria
595.26	in the genus vibrio,
597.26	which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
600.26	"How many people have seen a ""beach closed"" sign?"
605.26	Why does that happen?
607.26	It happens because we have jammed so much
609.26	into the base of the natural ocean pyramid
611.26	that these bacteria clog it up
613.26	and overfill onto our beaches.
615.26	Often what jams us up is sewage.
618.26	Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park
621.26	where you had a big sign at the front saying,
623.26	"""Closed because human sewage"
625.26	is so far over this park
627.26	"that you can't use it""?"
629.26	Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
632.26	We wouldn't tolerate our parks
634.26	being swamped by human sewage,
637.26	but beaches are closed a lot in our country.
639.26	They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,
642.26	and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
645.26	It's not just a question of cleanliness;
647.26	it's also a question of
649.26	how those organisms
651.26	then turn into human disease.
653.26	These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
656.26	They can go into your skin and create skin infections.
659.26	This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,
662.26	showing the rise of the infections
665.26	by vibrio in people
668.26	over the last few years.
670.26	Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
673.26	And if you can see on some surfing sites,
676.26	in fact, not only do you see
678.26	what the waves are like or what the weather's like,
680.26	but on some surf rider sites,
682.26	you see a little flashing poo alert.
685.26	That means that the beach might have great waves,
688.26	but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be
690.26	because they can carry with them,
692.26	even after a great day of surfing,
694.26	this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
697.26	Some of these infections are actually carrying
699.26	antibiotic resistance genes now,
701.26	and that makes them even more difficult.
703.26	These same infections
705.26	create harmful algal blooms.
707.26	Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
710.26	This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons
713.26	that come out of these harmful algal blooms:
715.26	shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,
718.26	diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --
721.26	neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
724.26	These are things that are getting into our food chain
726.26	because of these blooms.
728.26	Rita Calwell very famously
730.26	traced a very interesting story
732.26	of cholera into human communities,
735.26	brought there, not by
737.26	a normal human vector,
739.26	but by a marine vector, this copepod.
742.26	Copepods are small crustaceans.
744.26	They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,
746.26	and they can carry on their little legs
748.26	some of the cholera bacteria
750.26	that then leads to human disease.
753.26	That has sparked cholera epidemics
755.26	in ports along the world
757.26	and has led to increased concentration
760.26	on trying to make sure shipping
762.26	doesn't move these
764.26	vectors of cholera around the world.
766.26	So what do you do?
768.26	We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow
771.26	that the pyramid may not be working so well,
773.26	that the flow from the base up into it
775.26	is being blocked and clogged.
777.26	What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
780.26	Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
783.26	You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
785.26	And he could come in
787.26	and fix the flow.
789.26	But in fact, if you look around the world,
792.26	not only are there hope spots
794.26	for where we may be able to fix problems,
796.26	there have been places where problems have been fixed,
798.26	where people have come to grips with these issues
800.26	and begun to turn them around.
802.26	Monterey is one of those.
804.26	I started out showing how much
806.26	we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem
809.26	with pollution and the canning industry
811.26	and all of the attendant problems.
813.26	In 1932, that's the picture.
815.26	In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
819.26	The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
822.26	But there's a greater sense here
824.26	that what the individual communities need
826.26	is working ecosystems.
828.26	They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
831.26	And that pyramid
833.26	in Monterey, right now,
835.26	because of the efforts of a lot of different people,
837.26	is functioning better than it's ever functioned
839.26	for the last 150 years.
842.26	It didn't happen accidentally.
844.26	It happened because many people put their time and effort
847.26	and their pioneering spirit into this.
849.26	On the left there, Julia Platt,
851.26	the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.
853.26	At 74 years old, became mayor
855.26	because something had to be done
857.26	to protect the ocean.
859.26	In 1931, she produced California's first
861.26	community-based marine protected area,
864.26	right next to the biggest polluting cannery,
867.26	because Julia knew
869.26	that when the canneries eventually were gone,
871.26	the ocean needed a place to grow from,
874.26	that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,
877.26	and she wanted to provide that seed.
879.26	Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,
882.26	who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium
885.26	to lock into people's notion
887.26	that the ocean
889.26	and the health of the ocean ecosystem
892.26	were just as important to the economy of this area
895.26	as eating the ecosystem would be.
897.26	That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,
900.26	not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,
903.26	but other places around the world.
905.26	Well, I want to leave you with the thought that
907.26	what we're really trying to do here
909.26	is protect this ocean pyramid,
911.26	and that ocean pyramid
913.26	connects to our own pyramid of life.
915.26	It's an ocean planet,
917.26	and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,
921.26	but the pyramid of life in the ocean
924.26	and our own lives on land
926.26	are intricately connected.
928.26	And it's only through having the ocean being healthy
930.26	that we can remain healthy ourselves.
932.26	Thank you very much.
934.26	(Applause)
