17.634	Do I look real to you?
20.133	Hope so.
21.797	I have no idea if you're seeing this,
23.624	but I'm just going to look ahead
23.624	and trust that you're there.
27.802	I've drawn a semicircle
27.802	in the sand in front of me
30.59	so I don't walk past it
30.59	and look like I'm floating in midair.
38.433	Right now I'm standing
41.132	in the open air,
42.307	on a beach under a palm tree,
45.949	in the exact spot
45.949	where your stage used to be.
50.16	I have 12 minutes with you.
52.581	I set a limit.
54.85	My wife Navid once said
56.029	that infinite possibility
56.029	is a creator's worst enemy.
60.633	For example, this dress: I'd asked
60.633	her to design something
63.534	that a priest might have worn
63.534	in 23rd-century Cairo.
66.911	But we only had three days to make it,
69.967	and the only fabric we had
71.695	was an old duvet cover
71.695	that another resident left behind.
74.44	But she did it, and it's perfect.
79.01	And she looked at it and said,
81.664	"""Proof of concept --"
81.664	"creation needs constraint."""
87.727	So with these 12 minutes,
91.072	I'm going to tell you
91.072	about my greatest discovery.
96.812	For my whole life, my obsession
96.812	has been eternal life,
101.256	as I know it is so many of yours.
105.848	You may be happy to know
105.848	that your research will pay off.
110.16	I am 318 years old.
113.486	The average human lifespan
113.486	is now 432 years,
117.281	and my work has been to extend
117.281	the human lifespan indefinitely.
121.363	And I've never questioned that someday,
123.874	we'll reach a point
123.874	where we'll be content.
128.959	But the opposite keeps happening:
130.589	the longer we live,
130.589	the longer we want to live,
133.087	the less we want to die.
135.974	Who can blame us?
138.183	The universe is so big.
142.548	There won't ever not be more to see.
144.478	Just yesterday,
145.653	I was reading about how you can
145.653	take out a boat on Europa
148.437	and sail from island to island
148.437	all over the planet,
150.875	and some of the islands have villages
150.875	that you can stay and visit
154.132	and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter.
156.945	And then there's this other island
156.945	where there's just one songwriter
161.016	who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean.
163.517	And then there are others
163.517	where there's no one
166.456	and there never has been,
167.886	and so you go just for the pleasure
167.886	of touching your foot to sand
171.735	that no foot has ever touched before.
175.309	You could spend 400 years doing just that.
183.627	Right now the Moon is rising
183.627	in the Northeast.
187.013	I can see the cities on it
187.013	with my naked eye.
189.188	They're connected like nerve clusters:
192.332	Mariapolis on the South Pole,
192.332	and Ramachandran on the Equator.
198.956	And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility.
204.334	That's where Navid and I met.
206.472	We were both artists downtown.
210.138	The day we met, we were passing
210.138	each other in Azadi Square,
213.018	and we bumped shoulders.
214.504	And I turned to apologize
216.279	and she, without saying hello
216.279	or introducing herself or anything,
220.602	"said, ""Well, why do you think"
220.602	"we didn't just pass through each other?"""
226.101	And first of all, I thought,
226.101	"""Who the hell are you?"""
230.363	But second, the question annoyed me,
232.409	because the answer is so simple.
234.898	"I said, ""We didn't pass through each other"
237.332	because elementary particles have mass
239.6	and because the space
239.6	between elementary particles
241.997	is filled with the binding energy
241.997	that also has the properties of mass,
245.393	"and we've known that for 800 years."""
249.919	She must have been in one of those moods
251.899	where she likes to mess with strangers.
253.811	Or maybe she was just flirting with me,
255.724	because she looked at me and said,
255.724	"""I thought you'd say that."
260.636	"Think deeper."""
261.811	And then she took off her belt,
263.358	this belt that I'm wearing now,
268.408	and she said,
272.607	"""Our universe is built"
272.607	so that particles have mass.
278.769	Without that basic constraint,
280.294	we'd have just passed right through
280.294	each other at the speed of light
283.801	"and never even known."""
288.239	And that's how our romance began.
298.128	Navid and I
301.239	never ran out of things to talk about.
305.31	Never.
307.1	It was incredible.
308.276	It was like we were both heroes
308.276	climbing up into a mountain range together
312.834	and we kept arriving at new vistas,
315.313	and these new, perfect
315.313	constellations of words
318.333	would come out of us to describe them.
320.214	And we'd forget them
320.214	as soon as we made them,
322.362	and throw them over our shoulder
322.362	and go on to the next thing, on and up.
325.807	Or one time, Navid said that our talk
325.807	was like we were always making bread,
329.745	and that we were always
329.745	adding in a little more flour
333.288	and a little more water,
334.761	and folding it in and turning it over
336.738	and never getting around to baking it.
344.589	If my obsession was eternal life,
344.589	Navid's obsession was touch.
350.772	She had a genius for it.
353.502	All of her work revolved around it.
357.383	My body was like a canvas for her,
359.613	and she would draw her fingertip
359.613	down over my face so slowly
364.258	that I couldn't feel it moving.
366.265	And she was obsessed with the exact moment
368.962	when I would stop being able to tell
368.962	the difference between her body and mine.
375.721	Or she would just lie across me
375.721	and dig her shoulder into mine
378.74	"and say, ""Pilar, why does"
378.74	"this feel so good?"""
383.009	"I'd say, ""I don't know!"""
387.64	And she always had a facetious answer
387.64	for her facetious question,
393.033	but the answer I remember today is,
397.399	"""It feels good"
398.574	because the universe chose
398.574	its constraints,
401.378	"and we are its art."""
413.677	It's always funny what you think
413.677	the future is going to be like
416.726	versus what it turns out to be.
420.169	In your time, scientists thought
420.169	humans could freeze themselves
423.297	and wake up in the future.
425.761	And they did -- but then they died.
431.083	In your time, scientists thought
431.083	humans could replace organs
434.867	and extend life for hundreds of years.
438.311	And they did,
439.681	but eventually, they died anyway.
443.381	In your time, Earth
443.381	is the only place people live.
449.826	In my time, Earth is the place
449.826	people come to die.
457.539	So when Navid started to show the signs,
461.083	our friends assumed I would do
461.083	what everyone does,
463.539	which is say goodbye
463.539	and send her to Earth,
466.517	so that none of us
466.517	would have to look at her
469.756	or be around her
469.756	or think about her and her ...
474.225	failure to keep living.
480.811	More than anything,
482.019	they didn't want to be around
482.019	her actual physical body.
484.82	"They kept referring to it as ""declining,"""
488.536	even though she herself
488.536	was fascinated by it,
490.825	the changes it was going through,
492.972	following the rules of its nature
492.972	day by day, independent of her will.
500.481	I did send Navid to Earth.
503.948	But I came with her.
506.6	I remember a friend of ours,
506.6	just before we left, said,
510.192	"""I just think it's arrogant,"
513.08	like the rules don't apply to you,
513.08	"like you think your love is that special."""
519.497	But I did.
524.468	So, even here on Earth,
525.882	I kept working on how to extend life.
529.198	It didn't occur to me
530.373	that there could be any other response.
532.44	I kept going back to that thing
532.44	that Navid said to me
535.003	that day in Azadi Square,
536.766	that without that basic constraint --
539.486	a universe that granted mass to matter --
541.786	we would not exist.
545.481	That's one rule.
546.676	Another rule is that all mass
546.676	is subject to entropy.
551.929	And there is no way to be
551.929	in this universe without mass.
554.724	I know. I tried everything.
556.43	I tried creating a photon box
556.43	where the Higgs field was altered.
561.043	I tried recording all
561.043	subatomic movements in my body
565.199	and replaying them on closed loop.
567.01	Nothing worked.
573.184	But my final innovation
573.184	was to create a coil dimension
578.968	with the boundaries of a body
578.968	in which time moved infinitely slower,
584.635	but whose projection would appear
584.635	to move in normal time.
589.4	That body would then appear
589.4	in our universe as a hologram --
595.215	here but not here.
601.166	When I realized I'd done it,
603.987	I ran to her room,
605.867	so happy to tell her I'd done it,
608.838	moving through space
608.838	almost normally to all eyes,
612.366	even to my own,
615.95	and went to lie down next to her,
619.262	and forgot, and fell right through her.
628.303	I'd found a way to eternal life,
632.448	at the expense of the one thing
632.448	Navid loved most,
634.782	which was to touch and be touched.
641.939	And she threw me out.
648.42	I still got to watch, though.
651.748	Humans live 400 years now,
653.504	and we still die.
654.906	And when death comes,
658.342	the dying still pick at their bedsheets,
664.319	and their arms break out
664.319	in blue and violet blooms on the insides,
668.154	and their breaths get further
668.154	and further apart,
671.692	like they're falling asleep.
681.78	I've always thought that
683.796	what gives a life meaning is adventure.
687.476	And death is just a problem
689.893	we haven't discovered the solution to yet.
696.594	But maybe a life has meaning
696.594	only because it ends.
700.221	Maybe that's the paradox:
701.568	constraints don't constrain,
701.568	they allow perfect freedom.
711.175	(Sighs)
717.963	There was a thunderstorm
717.963	here this morning.
720.011	There is another forecast for tonight,
721.868	but for now the sky is clear.
724.937	I can't feel the wind here,
726.314	but I just asked one of the caretakers
726.314	who passed by what it felt like,
729.702	and she said it felt warm,
729.702	like melted butter.
735.464	An answer worthy of my wife.
742.861	I have to find my way back to the flesh.
748.98	Until then, I take up no space
748.98	but the space you give me.
