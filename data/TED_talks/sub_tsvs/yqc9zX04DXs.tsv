16.109	First, a video.
24.657	Yes, it is a scrambled egg.
29.411	But as you look at it,
30.768	I hope you'll begin to feel
30.768	just slightly uneasy.
36.649	Because you may notice
36.649	that what's actually happening
40.011	is that the egg is unscrambling itself.
42.26	And you'll now see the yolk
42.26	and the white have separated.
44.983	And now they're going to be
44.983	poured back into the egg.
48.03	And we all know in our heart of hearts
50.522	that this is not the way
50.522	the universe works.
54.696	A scrambled egg is mush --
54.696	tasty mush -- but it's mush.
57.825	An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing
60.26	that can create even more
60.26	sophisticated things,
62.523	such as chickens.
64.332	And we know in our heart of hearts
66.26	that the universe does not travel
66.26	from mush to complexity.
70.45	In fact, this gut instinct
72.869	is reflected in one of the most
72.869	fundamental laws of physics,
75.765	the second law of thermodynamics,
75.765	or the law of entropy.
79.162	What that says basically
80.945	is that the general
80.945	tendency of the universe
84.096	is to move from order and structure
87.723	to lack of order, lack of structure --
90.411	in fact, to mush.
91.899	And that's why that video
91.899	feels a bit strange.
95.685	And yet, look around us.
99.454	What we see around us
99.454	is staggering complexity.
103.549	Eric Beinhocker estimates
103.549	that in New York City alone,
106.862	there are some 10 billion SKUs,
106.862	or distinct commodities, being traded.
110.932	That's hundreds of times
110.932	as many species as there are on Earth.
115.26	And they're being traded by a species
115.26	of almost seven billion individuals,
119.26	who are linked by trade,
119.26	travel, and the Internet
122.669	into a global system
122.669	of stupendous complexity.
127.826	So here's a great puzzle:
130.191	in a universe ruled
130.191	by the second law of thermodynamics,
134.862	how is it possible
136.69	to generate the sort
136.69	of complexity I've described,
139.26	the sort of complexity
139.26	represented by you and me
143.072	and the convention center?
146.119	Well, the answer seems to be,
148.096	the universe can create complexity,
151.26	but with great difficulty.
153.87	In pockets,
154.991	there appear
154.991	what my colleague, Fred Spier,
157.332	"calls ""Goldilocks conditions"" --"
159.498	not too hot, not too cold,
161.573	just right for the creation of complexity.
164.26	And slightly more complex things appear.
166.551	And where you have
166.551	slightly more complex things,
168.814	you can get slightly more complex things.
171.21	And in this way, complexity
171.21	builds stage by stage.
176.135	Each stage is magical
178.437	because it creates the impression
178.437	of something utterly new
182.034	appearing almost out of nowhere
182.034	in the universe.
184.861	We refer in big history to these moments
184.861	as threshold moments.
189.131	And at each threshold,
189.131	the going gets tougher.
192.26	The complex things get more fragile,
195.526	more vulnerable;
197.26	the Goldilocks conditions
197.26	get more stringent,
200.815	and it's more difficult
200.815	to create complexity.
204.728	Now, we, as extremely complex creatures,
208.056	desperately need to know this story
210.26	of how the universe creates complexity
210.26	despite the second law,
214.942	and why complexity means
214.942	vulnerability and fragility.
220.745	And that's the story
220.745	that we tell in big history.
223.689	But to do it, you have do something
225.42	that may, at first sight,
225.42	seem completely impossible.
228.149	You have to survey the whole
228.149	history of the universe.
232.748	So let's do it.
234.26	(Laughter)
236.193	Let's begin by winding the timeline back
242.583	to the beginning of time.
252.581	Around us, there's nothing.
254.986	There's not even time or space.
258.474	Imagine the darkest,
258.474	emptiest thing you can
262.196	and cube it a gazillion times
262.196	and that's where we are.
265.992	And then suddenly,
268.356	bang!
269.388	A universe appears, an entire universe.
271.619	And we've crossed our first threshold.
273.499	The universe is tiny;
273.499	it's smaller than an atom.
275.896	It's incredibly hot.
277.26	It contains everything
277.26	that's in today's universe,
279.809	so you can imagine, it's busting.
281.627	And it's expanding at incredible speed.
284.26	And at first, it's just a blur,
286.197	but very quickly distinct things
286.197	begin to appear in that blur.
289.743	Within the first second,
291.26	energy itself shatters
291.26	into distinct forces
294.26	including electromagnetism and gravity.
297.366	And energy does something
297.366	else quite magical:
299.818	it congeals to form matter --
303.074	quarks that will create protons
305.428	and leptons that include electrons.
307.59	And all of that happens
307.59	in the first second.
309.717	Now we move forward 380,000 years.
314.26	That's twice as long as humans
314.26	have been on this planet.
317.931	And now simple atoms appear
317.931	of hydrogen and helium.
323.877	Now I want to pause for a moment,
	of the universe,
328.26	because we actually know quite a lot
328.26	about the universe at this stage.
332.773	We know above all
332.773	that it was extremely simple.
335.718	It consisted of huge clouds
335.718	of hydrogen and helium atoms,
339.541	and they have no structure.
341.493	They're really a sort of cosmic mush.
344.652	But that's not completely true.
346.732	Recent studies
348.26	by satellites such as the WMAP satellite
351.145	have shown that, in fact,
352.746	there are just tiny differences
352.746	in that background.
355.519	What you see here,
357.26	the blue areas are about a thousandth
357.26	of a degree cooler
361.59	than the red areas.
363.006	These are tiny differences,
364.403	but it was enough
364.403	for the universe to move on
366.697	to the next stage of building complexity.
368.696	And this is how it works.
370.895	Gravity is more powerful
370.895	where there's more stuff.
375.817	So where you get slightly denser areas,
378.159	gravity starts compacting clouds
378.159	of hydrogen and helium atoms.
382.1	So we can imagine the early universe
382.1	breaking up into a billion clouds.
385.674	And each cloud is compacted,
387.5	gravity gets more powerful
387.5	as density increases,
390.54	the temperature begins to rise
390.54	at the center of each cloud,
393.658	and then, at the center,
394.971	the temperature crosses
394.971	the threshold temperature
397.833	of 10 million degrees,
399.423	protons start to fuse,
401.852	there's a huge release of energy,
404.26	and --
405.717	bam!
406.757	We have our first stars.
408.938	From about 200 million years
408.938	after the Big Bang,
412.82	stars begin to appear
412.82	all through the universe,
416.251	billions of them.
417.759	And the universe is now
417.759	significantly more interesting
420.639	and more complex.
423.188	Stars will create
423.188	the Goldilocks conditions
426.328	for crossing two new thresholds.
428.631	When very large stars die,
431.234	they create temperatures so high
433.579	that protons begin to fuse
433.579	in all sorts of exotic combinations,
437.236	to form all the elements
437.236	of the periodic table.
440.09	If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,
442.41	it was forged in a supernova explosion.
445.878	So now the universe
445.878	is chemically more complex.
449.101	And in a chemically more complex universe,
451.49	it's possible to make more things.
453.958	And what starts happening
453.958	is that, around young suns,
457.474	young stars,
459.26	all these elements combine,
459.26	they swirl around,
461.475	the energy of the star stirs them around,
464.279	they form particles, they form snowflakes,
464.279	they form little dust motes,
469.028	they form rocks, they form asteroids,
471.248	and eventually,
471.248	they form planets and moons.
473.867	And that is how our
473.867	solar system was formed,
476.841	four and a half billion years ago.
480.453	Rocky planets like our Earth
480.453	are significantly more complex than stars
485.85	because they contain
485.85	a much greater diversity of materials.
488.636	So we've crossed a fourth
488.636	threshold of complexity.
492.931	Now, the going gets tougher.
496.411	The next stage introduces entities
496.411	that are significantly more fragile,
500.713	significantly more vulnerable,
502.649	but they're also much more creative
505.26	and much more capable
505.26	of generating further complexity.
508.606	I'm talking, of course,
508.606	about living organisms.
512.734	Living organisms are created by chemistry.
514.901	We are huge packages of chemicals.
518.115	So, chemistry is dominated
518.115	by the electromagnetic force.
521.26	That operates over smaller
521.26	scales than gravity,
523.523	which explains why you and I
523.523	are smaller than stars or planets.
528.033	Now, what are the ideal
528.033	conditions for chemistry?
530.874	What are the Goldilocks conditions?
532.668	Well, first, you need energy,
535.049	but not too much.
536.665	In the center of a star,
536.665	there's so much energy
538.944	that any atoms that combine
538.944	will just get busted apart again.
542.11	But not too little.
543.642	In intergalactic space,
544.897	there's so little energy
544.897	that atoms can't combine.
548.378	What you want is just the right amount,
550.26	and planets, it turns out, are just right,
552.284	because they're close to stars,
552.284	but not too close.
555.394	You also need a great diversity
555.394	of chemical elements,
559.013	and you need liquids, such as water.
562.045	Why?
563.116	Well, in gases, atoms move
563.116	past each other so fast
567.012	that they can't hitch up.
568.95	In solids,
570.696	atoms are stuck together, they can't move.
573.26	In liquids,
575.002	they can cruise and cuddle
578.064	and link up to form molecules.
581.04	Now, where do you find
581.04	such Goldilocks conditions?
583.934	Well, planets are great,
585.95	and our early Earth was almost perfect.
590.037	It was just the right
590.037	distance from its star
592.109	to contain huge oceans of liquid water.
594.26	And deep beneath those oceans,
596.26	at cracks in the Earth's crust,
598.26	you've got heat seeping up
598.26	from inside the Earth,
601.26	and you've got a great
601.26	diversity of elements.
603.411	So at those deep oceanic vents,
605.981	fantastic chemistry began to happen,
608.26	and atoms combined in all sorts
608.26	of exotic combinations.
612.26	But of course, life is more
612.26	than just exotic chemistry.
617.054	How do you stabilize those huge molecules
620.835	that seem to be viable?
622.95	Well, it's here that life introduces
622.95	an entirely new trick.
628.22	You don't stabilize the individual;
630.779	you stabilize the template,
632.906	the thing that carries information,
635.035	and you allow the template to copy itself.
637.276	And DNA, of course,
637.276	is the beautiful molecule
640.451	that contains that information.
642.801	You'll be familiar
642.801	with the double helix of DNA.
645.64	Each rung contains information.
648.18	So, DNA contains information
648.18	about how to make living organisms.
653.315	And DNA also copies itself.
655.263	So, it copies itself
656.493	and scatters the templates
656.493	through the ocean.
659.199	So the information spreads.
661.017	Notice that information
661.017	has become part of our story.
664.137	The real beauty of DNA though
664.137	is in its imperfections.
667.806	As it copies itself,
667.806	once in every billion rungs,
671.758	there tends to be an error.
673.527	And what that means
673.527	is that DNA is, in effect, learning.
678.26	It's accumulating new ways
678.26	of making living organisms
681.604	because some of those errors work.
683.248	So DNA's learning
684.47	and it's building greater
684.47	diversity and greater complexity.
687.728	And we can see this happening
687.728	over the last four billion years.
690.934	For most of that time of life on Earth,
693.133	living organisms have been
693.133	relatively simple --
695.394	single cells.
696.806	But they had great diversity,
696.806	and, inside, great complexity.
700.671	Then from about 600
700.671	to 800 million years ago,
703.599	multi-celled organisms appear.
705.714	You get fungi, you get fish,
708.239	you get plants,
709.778	you get amphibia, you get reptiles,
712.513	and then, of course,
712.513	you get the dinosaurs.
715.999	And occasionally, there are disasters.
719.586	Sixty-five million years ago,
721.999	an asteroid landed on Earth
723.987	near the Yucatan Peninsula,
725.801	creating conditions equivalent
725.801	to those of a nuclear war,
728.793	and the dinosaurs were wiped out.
731.166	Terrible news for the dinosaurs,
734.26	but great news
734.26	for our mammalian ancestors,
738.039	who flourished
739.26	in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.
742.941	And we human beings are part
742.941	of that creative evolutionary pulse
748.02	that began 65 million years ago
750.38	with the landing of an asteroid.
753.796	Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
756.534	And I believe we count
756.534	as a threshold in this great story.
760.906	Let me explain why.
762.7	We've seen that DNA learns in a sense,
765.755	it accumulates information.
767.566	But it is so slow.
770.128	DNA accumulates information
770.128	through random errors,
773.624	some of which just happen to work.
776.49	But DNA had actually generated
776.49	a faster way of learning:
779.148	it had produced organisms with brains,
781.95	and those organisms
781.95	can learn in real time.
785.193	They accumulate information, they learn.
787.543	The sad thing is, when they die,
790.392	the information dies with them.
792.479	Now what makes humans different
792.479	is human language.
796.49	We are blessed with a language,
796.49	a system of communication,
799.277	so powerful and so precise
801.922	that we can share what we've learned
801.922	with such precision
805.104	that it can accumulate
805.104	in the collective memory.
808.017	And that means
809.26	it can outlast the individuals
809.26	who learned that information,
813.063	and it can accumulate
813.063	from generation to generation.
816.26	And that's why, as a species,
816.26	we're so creative and so powerful,
820.34	and that's why we have a history.
823.015	We seem to be the only species
823.015	in four billion years
826.34	to have this gift.
828.057	I call this ability collective learning.
831.995	It's what makes us different.
833.686	We can see it at work
833.686	in the earliest stages of human history.
837.949	We evolved as a species
837.949	in the savanna lands of Africa,
841.26	but then you see humans migrating
841.26	into new environments,
844.744	into desert lands, into jungles,
846.918	into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia --
849.378	tough, tough environment --
850.847	into the Americas, into Australasia.
853.204	Each migration involved learning --
855.265	learning new ways of exploiting
855.265	the environment,
857.772	new ways of dealing
857.772	with their surroundings.
859.97	Then 10,000 years ago,
861.81	exploiting a sudden
861.81	change in global climate
864.829	with the end of the last ice age,
866.425	humans learned to farm.
868.623	Farming was an energy bonanza.
871.083	And exploiting that energy,
871.083	human populations multiplied.
874.934	Human societies got larger,
874.934	denser, more interconnected.
879.101	And then from about 500 years ago,
882.476	humans began to link up globally
884.539	through shipping, through trains,
886.944	through telegraph, through the Internet,
889.26	until now we seem to form
889.26	a single global brain
894.475	of almost seven billion individuals.
896.631	And that brain is learning at warp speed.
900.572	And in the last 200 years,
900.572	something else has happened.
903.168	We've stumbled on another energy bonanza
905.858	in fossil fuels.
907.009	So fossil fuels and collective
907.009	learning together
909.736	explain the staggering complexity
909.736	we see around us.
916.505	So --
918.668	Here we are,
920.009	back at the convention center.
921.557	We've been on a journey,
921.557	a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.
926.967	I hope you agree this is a powerful story.
929.46	And it's a story in which humans
929.46	play an astonishing and creative role.
934.466	But it also contains warnings.
937.474	Collective learning is a very,
937.474	very powerful force,
941.831	and it's not clear
941.831	that we humans are in charge of it.
947.123	I remember very vividly
947.123	as a child growing up in England,
950.216	living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
952.847	For a few days, the entire biosphere
956.482	seemed to be on the verge of destruction.
959.474	And the same weapons are still here,
962.663	and they are still armed.
965.004	If we avoid that trap,
965.004	others are waiting for us.
968.647	We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate
971.26	that we seem to be undermining
971.26	the Goldilocks conditions
974.695	that made it possible
974.695	for human civilizations
976.947	to flourish over the last 10,000 years.
980.633	So what big history can do
982.933	is show us the nature
982.933	of our complexity and fragility
986.278	and the dangers that face us,
988.226	but it can also show us
988.226	our power with collective learning.
992.586	And now, finally --
995.657	this is what I want.
999.448	I want my grandson, Daniel,
1002.504	and his friends and his generation,
1005.285	throughout the world,
1007.102	to know the story of big history,
1009.966	and to know it so well
1012.029	that they understand
1012.029	both the challenges that face us
1015.719	and the opportunities that face us.
1018.26	And that's why a group of us
1020.164	are building a free, online syllabus
1023.2	in big history
1024.542	for high-school students
1024.542	throughout the world.
1027.225	We believe that big history
1029.685	will be a vital
1029.685	intellectual tool for them,
1032.26	as Daniel and his generation
1035.127	face the huge challenges
1037.499	and also the huge opportunities
1039.578	ahead of them at this threshold moment
1043.057	in the history of our beautiful planet.
1046.993	I thank you for your attention.
