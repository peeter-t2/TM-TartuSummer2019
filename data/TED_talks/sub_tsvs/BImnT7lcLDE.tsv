13.615	So I grew up in East Los Angeles,
16.115	not even realizing I was poor.
18.286	My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.
22.403	Everyone knew who I was,
23.702	so I thought I was a pretty big deal, and I was protected,
27.152	and even though my dad spent most of my life
29.721	in and out of jail,
31.07	I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.
35.571	She worked at the local high school
37.08	as a secretary in the dean's office,
39.635	so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class,
42.325	for whatever reason, who were waiting to be disciplined.
45.163	Man, her office was packed.
48.954	So, see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with
52.751	outside of school,
54.309	and sometimes we're just not ready to focus.
57.226	But that doesn't mean that we can't.
59.556	It just takes a little bit more.
61.743	Like, I remember one day I found my dad
64.848	convulsing, foaming at the mouth,
67.192	OD-ing on the bathroom floor.
69.406	Really, do you think that doing my homework that night
71.879	was at the top of my priority list?
74.391	Not so much.
75.858	But I really needed a support network,
78.991	a group of people who were going to help me
81.316	make sure that I wasn't going to be
83.536	a victim of my own circumstance,
86.191	that they were going to push me
87.805	beyond what I even thought I could do.
90.37	I needed teachers, in the classroom, every day,
93.839	"who were going to say, ""You can move beyond that."""
97.584	And unfortunately, the local junior high
100.862	was not going to offer that.
102.971	It was gang-infested, huge teacher turnover rate.
106.805	"So my mom said, ""You're going on a bus"
109.978	"an hour and a half away from where we live every day."""
115.191	So for the next two years, that's what I did.
117.553	I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.
122.04	And eventually, I ended up at a school
124.965	where there was a mixture.
126.529	There were some people who were really gang-affiliated,
129.207	and then there were those of us
130.672	really trying to make it to high school.
132.666	Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.
136.169	You had to survive.
137.883	You just had to do things sometimes.
140.536	So there were a lot of teachers who were like,
142.889	"""She's never going to make it."
144.315	She has an issue with authority.
145.906	"She's not going to go anywhere."""
147.549	Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.
151.642	But then, they were very surprised
154.809	when I graduated from high school.
158	I was accepted to Pepperdine University,
160.862	and I came back to the same school that I attended
163.985	to be a special ed assistant.
165.896	"And then I told them, ""I want to be a teacher."""
170.449	"And boy, they were like, ""What? Why?"
173.673	"Why would you want to do that?"""
175.193	So I began my teaching career
177.479	at the exact same middle school that I attended,
181.007	and I really wanted to try to save more kids
184.438	who were just like me.
186.515	And so every year, I share my background with my kids,
189.715	because they need to know that everyone has a story,
192.772	everyone has a struggle,
195.139	and everyone needs help along the way.
198.893	And I am going to be their help along the way.
203.021	So as a rookie teacher, I created opportunity.
209.089	I had a kid one day come into my class
211.735	having been stabbed the night before.
214.943	"I was like, ""You need to go to a hospital,"
217.439	"the school nurse, something."""
220.714	"He's like, ""No, Miss, I'm not going."
222.875	"I need to be in class because I need to graduate."""
225.643	So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim
229.035	of his circumstance,
230.812	but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.
234.85	And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids
238.74	and getting to know exactly what they're going through,
242.856	getting to know their families -- I wanted that,
246.112	but I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids,
251.592	and teachers turning over year after year after year.
255.066	How do you get to build those relationships?
259.118	So we created a new school.
262.705	And we created
264.184	the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.
267.722	And we made sure that we were still attached
271.194	to our school district for funding, for support.
275.232	But with that, we were going to gain freedom:
278.349	freedom to hire the teachers
280.602	that we knew were going to be effective;
283.924	freedom to control the curriculum
286.664	so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no;
292.302	and freedom to control a budget,
295.022	to spend money where it matters,
297.606	not how a district or a state says you have to do it.
301.847	We wanted those freedoms.
304.15	But now, shifting an entire paradigm,
306.726	it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.
310.871	But we had to do it.
313.221	Our community deserved a new way of doing things.
317.342	And as the very first pilot middle school
320.868	in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,
324.093	you better believe there was some opposition.
327.069	And it was out of fear --
329.192	fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?
332.415	Yeah, what if we get it wrong?
334.6	But what if we get it right?
336.854	And we did.
338.929	So even though teachers were against it
341.54	because we employ one-year contracts --
344.121	you can't teach, or you don't want to teach,
348.19	you don't get to be at my school with my kids.
351.25	(Applause)
358.014	So in our third year, how did we do it?
361.686	Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.
365.117	We make our kids feel like they matter to us.
367.878	We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them,
371.766	and they use all the technology that they're used to.
374.351	Laptops, computers, tablets -- you name it, they have it.
377.278	Animation, software, moviemaking software, they have it all.
381.196	And because we connect it to what they're doing â€”
385.009	For example, they made public service announcements
388.211	for the Cancer Society.
389.837	These were played in the local trolley system.
392.661	Teaching elements of persuasion,
394.668	it doesn't get any more real than that.
397.588	Our state test scores have gone up
399.749	more than 80 points since we've become our own school.
402.738	But it's taken all stakeholders, working together --
405.833	teachers and principals on one-year contracts,
409.017	working over and above and beyond their contract hours
412.841	without compensation.
415.877	And it takes a school board member
418.096	who is going to lobby for you and say,
420.048	"""Know, the district is trying to impose this,"
422.476	"but you have the freedom to do otherwise."""
425.509	And it takes an active parent center
428.073	who is not only there, showing a presence every day,
432.153	but who is part of our governance,
435.02	making decisions for their kids, our kids.
440.024	Because why should our students have to go
442.629	so far away from where they live?
445.608	They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood,
449.332	a school that they can be proud to say they attend,
452.505	and a school that the community can be proud of as well,
456.173	and they need teachers to fight for them every day
460.371	and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.
465.704	Because it's time that kids like me
468.42	stop being the exception, and we become the norm.
473.142	Thank you.
474.451	(Applause)
