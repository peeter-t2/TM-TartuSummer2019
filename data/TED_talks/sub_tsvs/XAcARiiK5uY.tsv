12.72	There are a few things
12.72	that all of us need.
17.8	We all need air to breathe.
21.32	We need clean water to drink.
23.72	We need food to eat.
23.72	We need shelter and love.
26.76	You know. Love is great, too.
30.36	And we all need a safe place to pee.
33.88	(Laughter) Yeah?
35.68	As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly
35.68	into the gender binary,
39.64	if I could change the world tomorrow
43.04	to make it easier for me to navigate,
45.08	the very first thing I would do
47.32	is blink and create single stall,
47.32	gender-neutral bathrooms
52.28	in all public places.
54.96	(Applause)
61.6	Trans people and trans issues,
63.68	they've been getting a lot
63.68	of mainstream media attention lately.
67.64	And this is a great and necessary thing,
70.4	but most of that attention
70.4	has been focused
72.88	on a very few individuals,
75.32	most of whom are kinda rich
77.76	and pretty famous,
79.4	and probably don't have to worry that much
79.4	anymore about where they're going to pee
83.36	in between classes
83.36	at their community college,
85.56	or where they're going to get changed
85.56	into their gym strip
88.32	at their public high school.
89.72	Fame and money insulates
89.72	these television star trans people
96.4	from most of the everyday challenges
99.28	that the rest of us
99.28	have to tackle on a daily basis.
106.2	Public bathrooms.
109.2	They've been a problem for me
109.2	since as far back as I can remember,
113.72	first when I was just a little baby tomboy
117.44	and then later as a masculine-appearing,
117.44	predominantly estrogen-based organism.
123.16	(Laughter)
124.24	Now, today as a trans person,
124.24	public bathrooms and change rooms
129.16	are where I am most likely
129.16	to be questioned or harassed.
134.08	I've often been verbally
134.08	attacked behind their doors.
137.6	I've been hauled out by security guards
137.6	with my pants still halfway pulled up.
142.36	I've been stared at,
142.36	screamed at, whispered about,
144.76	and one time I got smacked in the face
144.76	by a little old lady's purse
149.52	that from the looks of the shiner
149.52	I took home that day
152.12	I am pretty certain contained at least
155.92	and a large hard candy collection.
157.92	(Laughter)
160.8	And I know what some of you are thinking,
164.8	and you're mostly right.
167.6	I can and do just use the men's room
167.6	most of the time these days.
174.84	But that doesn't solve
174.84	my change room dilemmas, does it?
179.52	And I shouldn't have to use the men's room
179.52	because I'm not a man.
185.96	I'm a trans person.
188.2	And now we've got
188.2	these fearmongering politicians
192.08	that keep trying to pass
192.08	these bathroom bills.
194.28	Have you heard about these?
195.64	They try to legislate
195.64	to try and force people like myself
198.44	to use the bathroom
198.44	that they deem most appropriate
203.16	according to the gender
203.16	I was assigned at birth.
205.72	And if these politicians
205.72	ever get their way,
209.24	in Arizona or California or Florida
212.76	or just last week in Houston, Texas,
215.16	or Ottawa,
216.88	well then, using the men's room
216.88	will not be a legal option for me either.
223.88	And every time one of these politicians
223.88	brings one of these bills to the table,
227.619	I can't help but wonder, you know,
229.68	just who will and exactly how would we
229.68	go about enforcing laws like these. Right?
236.24	Panty checks?
237.92	Really.
239.6	Genital inspections outside
239.6	of bath change rooms at public pools?
246.2	There's no legal
246.2	or ethical or plausible way
250.2	to enforce laws like these anyway.
254.6	They exist only to foster fear
257.16	and promote transphobia.
261.32	They don't make anyone safer.
264.4	But they do for sure make the world
264.4	more dangerous for some of us.
268.48	And meanwhile, our trans children suffer.
271.88	They drop out of school,
271.88	or they opt out of life altogether.
276.44	Trans people, especially trans
276.44	and gender-nonconforming youth
281.4	face additional challenges
281.4	when accessing pools and gyms,
285.88	but also universities,
288.6	hospitals, libraries.
292.16	Don't even get me started
292.16	on how they treat us in airports.
297.92	If we don't move now
300.8	to make sure that these places
303.44	are truly open and accessible to everyone,
306.52	then we just need to get honest
309.64	and quit calling them public places.
313.8	We need to just admit
316.68	that they are really only open for people
319.52	who fit neatly
319.52	into one of two gender boxes,
325.6	which I do not.
328.72	I never have.
332.24	And this starts very early.
335.4	I know a little girl.
335.4	She's the daughter of a friend of mine.
339.44	She's a self-identified tomboy.
342.84	I'm talking about cowboy boots
344.96	and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks
344.96	and bug jars, the whole nine yards.
349.76	One time I asked her
349.76	what her favorite color was.
352.24	"She told me, ""Camouflage."""
354.56	(Laughter)
357.68	So that awesome little kid,
359.84	she came home from school last October
362.68	from her half day of preschool
364.96	with soggy pants on because the other kids
364.96	at school were harassing her
369.04	when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
372	And the teacher had already instructed her
372	to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
377.32	And she had drank two glasses
377.32	of that red juice
380.88	at the Halloween party,
382.36	and I mean, who can resist
382.36	that red juice, right? It's so good.
387.68	And she couldn't hold her pee any longer.
391.4	Her and her classmates
391.4	were four years old.
394.64	They already felt empowered enough
397.72	to police her use
397.72	of the so-called public bathrooms.
404.44	She was four years old.
405.76	She had already been taught
405.76	the brutal lesson
408.88	that there was
408.88	no bathroom door at preschool
413.24	with a sign on it
413.24	that welcomed people like her.
418.4	She'd already learned that bathrooms
418.4	were going to be a problem,
422.76	and that problem started with her
426.56	and was hers alone.
430.84	So my friend asked me
430.84	to talk to her little daughter,
434.52	and I did.
436.56	I wanted to tell her
439.08	that me and her mom
439.08	were going to march on down
441.29	and talk to that school,
441.29	and the problem was going to go away,
444.24	but I knew that wasn't true.
445.64	I wanted to tell her that it was all
445.64	going to get better when she got older,
449.48	but I couldn't.
452.24	So I asked her to tell me
452.24	the story of what had happened,
457.6	asked her to tell me how it made her feel.
461.4	"""Mad and sad,"""
464.76	she told me.
466.88	So I told her
468.76	that she wasn't alone
471	and that it wasn't right
471	what had happened to her,
473.4	and then she asked me
473.4	if I had ever peed in my pants before.
479.04	I said yes, I had,
481.76	but not for a really long time.
483.44	(Laughter)
484.68	Which of course was a lie,
487.04	because you know
487.04	how you hit, like, 42 or 43,
489.8	and sometimes you just,
489.8	I don't know, you pee a little bit
492.8	when you cough or sneeze,
494.08	when you're running upstairs,
494.08	or you're stretching.
497.28	Don't lie.
498.84	It happens. Right?
500.6	She doesn't need to know that, I figure.
502.8	(Laughter)
505.72	I told her, when you get older,
505.72	your bladder is going to grow bigger, too.
511.16	When you get old like me,
512.44	you're going to be able
512.44	to hold your pee for way longer,
516.4	I promised her.
519.16	"""Until you can get home?"""
522.2	she asked me.
524.72	"I said, ""Yes,"
528.24	"until you can get home."""
532.28	She seemed to take some comfort in that.
538.8	So let's just build some single stall,
538.8	gender-neutral bathrooms
544.6	with a little bench for getting changed
544.6	into your gym clothes.
548.88	We can't change the world overnight
552.4	for our children,
553.64	but we can give them
553.64	a safe and private place
556.12	to escape that world,
557.6	if only for just a minute.
562.2	This we can do.
565.28	So let's just do it.
567.84	And if you are one of those people
567.84	who is sitting out there right now
571.16	already coming up with a list of reasons
571.16	in your head why this is not a priority,
575.2	or it's too expensive,
577.36	or telling yourself that giving
577.36	a trans person a safe place to pee
581	or get changed in
582.68	supports a lifestyle choice
582.68	that you feel offends your morality,
588.6	or your masculinity,
590.8	or your religious beliefs,
592.28	then let me just appeal
594.56	to the part of your heart
594.56	that probably, hopefully,
599	does care about
599	the rest of the population.
603.76	If you can't bring yourself
603.76	to care enough about people like me,
609.92	then what about women and girls
612.24	with body image issues?
614.8	What about anyone
614.8	with body image stuff going on?
619.36	What about that boy at school
619.36	who is a foot shorter than his classmates,
625	whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey?
628.88	Oh, grade eight,
630.84	what a cruel master you can be.
634.04	Right?
635.8	What about people with anxiety issues?
639.96	What about people with disabilities
639.96	or who need assistance in there?
643.56	What about folks with bodies
643.56	who, for whatever reason,
647.08	don't fit into the mainstream idea
647.08	of what a body should look like?
651.52	How many of us still feel shy
654.64	or afraid to disrobe
654.64	in front of our peers,
658.2	and how many of us allow that fear
660.8	to keep us from something as important
664.08	as physical exercise?
669.2	Would all those people not benefit
672.72	from these single stall facilities?
677.04	We can't change
677.04	transphobic minds overnight,
683.24	but we can give everybody
686.24	a place to get changed in
690.08	so that we can all get to work
693.88	making the world safer
696.8	for all of us.
699.64	Thank you for listening.
700.88	(Applause)
703.16	Thank you.
704.4	(Applause)
