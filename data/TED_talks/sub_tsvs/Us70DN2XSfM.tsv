12.89	Growing up, I didn't always understand
15.19	why my parents made me
15.19	follow the rules that they did.
17.885	Like, why did I really 
17.885	have to mow the lawn?
20.675	Why was homework really that important?
23.343	Why couldn't I put jelly beans 
23.343	in my oatmeal?
27.267	My childhood was abound
27.267	with questions like this.
30.123	Normal things about being a kid
30.123	and realizing that sometimes,
34.396	it was best to listen to my parents
34.396	even when I didn't exactly understand why.
38.479	And it's not that they didn't want
38.479	me to think critically.
41.495	Their parenting always sought 
41.495	to reconcile the tension
44.096	between having my siblings and I
44.096	understand the realities of the world,
47.547	while ensuring that we never accepted
47.547	the status quo as inevitable.
51.654	I came to realize that this,
51.654	in and of itself,
54.964	was a very purposeful form of education.
58.05	One of my favorite educators,
58.05	Brazilian author and scholar Paulo Freire,
62.17	speaks quite explicitly
62.17	about the need for education
65.269	to be used as a tool for critical 
65.269	awakening and shared humanity.
69.857	In his most famous book,
69.857	"""Pedagogy of the Oppressed,"""
72.642	"he states, ""No one can be "
72.642	authentically human
77.156	"while he prevents others from being so."""
80.167	I've been thinking a lot about this 
80.167	lately, this idea of humanity,
83.987	and specifically, who in this world
83.987	is afforded the privilege
87.264	of being perceived as fully human.
90.28	Over the course of 
90.28	the past several months,
92.61	the world has watched
92.61	as unarmed black men, and women,
95.818	have had their lives taken
95.818	at the hands of police and vigilante.
99.755	These events and all that 
99.755	has transpired after them
102.648	have brought me back to my own childhood
104.756	and the decisions that my parents made
104.756	about raising a black boy in America
109.1	that growing up, I didn't always
109.1	understand in the way that I do now.
113.977	I think of how hard it must have been,
113.977	how profoundly unfair it must have felt
118.212	for them to feel like they had 
118.212	to strip away parts of my childhood
122.409	just so that I could come home at night.
125.21	For example, I think of how one night,
127.311	when I was around 12 years old, on an
127.311	overnight field trip to another city,
131.213	my friends and I bought Super Soakers
133.559	and turned the hotel parking lot
133.559	into our own water-filled battle zone.
138.102	We hid behind cars,
139.805	running through the darkness that
139.805	lay between the streetlights,
142.973	boundless laughter ubiquitous 
142.973	across the pavement.
146.384	But within 10 minutes,
148.467	my father came outside, 
148.467	grabbed me by my forearm
151.48	and led me into our room
151.48	with an unfamiliar grip.
154.505	Before I could say anything,
156.369	tell him how foolish he had 
156.369	made me look in front of my friends,
159.727	he derided me for being so naive.
162.842	Looked me in the eye, 
162.842	fear consuming his face,
167.385	"and said, ""Son, I'm sorry,"
169.93	but you can't act the same 
169.93	as your white friends.
172.967	You can't pretend to shoot guns.
175.202	You can't run around in the dark.
177.088	You can't hide behind anything
177.088	"other than your own teeth."""
180.132	I know now how scared he must have been,
183.135	how easily I could have fallen
183.135	into the empty of the night,
187.148	that some man would mistake this water
189.907	for a good reason to wash
189.907	all of this away.
193.134	These are the sorts of messages I've been
193.134	inundated with my entire life:
196.546	Always keep your hands where they 
196.546	can see them, don't move too quickly,
200.045	take off your hood when the sun goes down.
202.116	My parents raised me and my siblings
202.116	in an armor of advice,
205.223	an ocean of alarm bells so someone
205.223	wouldn't steal the breath from our lungs,
208.854	so that they wouldn't make
208.854	a memory of this skin.
211.166	So that we could be kids, 
211.166	not casket or concrete.
213.674	And it's not because they thought it
213.674	would make us better than anyone else
217.154	it's simply because they wanted 
217.154	to keep us alive.
219.672	All of my black friends were raised
219.672	with the same message,
222.402	the talk, given to us 
222.402	when we became old enough
224.679	to be mistaken for a nail ready
224.679	to be hammered to the ground,
227.624	when people made our melanin
227.624	synonymous with something to be feared.
232.118	But what does it do to a child
234.591	to grow up knowing that you
234.591	cannot simply be a child?
238.041	That the whims of adolescence
238.041	are too dangerous for your breath,
241.19	that you cannot simply be curious,
242.854	that you are not afforded the luxury
242.854	of making a mistake,
245.548	that someone's implicit bias
247.316	might be the reason you don't
247.316	wake up in the morning.
250.156	But this cannot be what defines us.
251.871	Because we have parents
251.871	who raised us to understand
254.462	that our bodies weren't meant
254.462	for the backside of a bullet,
257.238	but for flying kites and jumping rope,
257.238	and laughing until our stomachs burst.
260.872	We had teachers who taught us 
260.872	how to raise our hands in class,
263.856	and not just to signal surrender,
265.424	and that the only thing we should give up
267.39	is the idea that we 
267.39	aren't worthy of this world.
269.763	So when we say that black lives matter,
269.763	it's not because others don't,
273.043	it's simply because we must affirm that we
273.043	are worthy of existing without fear,
276.751	when so many things tell us we are not.
278.877	I want to live in a world where my son
280.839	will not be presumed guilty
280.839	the moment he is born,
283.327	where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken
283.327	for anything other than a toy.
287.178	And I refuse to accept that we can't
287.178	build this world into something new,
290.613	some place where a child's name
292.11	doesn't have to be written 
292.11	on a t-shirt, or a tombstone,
294.857	where the value of someone's life
296.474	isn't determined by anything other 
296.474	than the fact that they had lungs,
300.273	a place where every single 
300.273	one of us can breathe.
304.491	Thank you.
305.445	(Applause)
