12.685	The youthful perspective on the future,
16.948	the present perspective on the future
19.506	and the future, mature
19.506	perspective on the future --
24.62	I'd like to try and bring
24.62	all those three tenses together
28.622	in one identity tonight.
31.337	And you could say
31.337	that the poet, in many ways,
34.606	looks at what I call
34.606	"""the conversational nature of reality."""
38.976	And you ask yourself:
40.702	What is the conversational
40.702	nature of reality?
43.526	The conversational nature
43.526	of reality is the fact
46.299	that whatever you desire of the world --
50.11	whatever you desire of your partner
50.11	in a marriage or a love relationship,
53.921	whatever you desire of your children,
55.952	whatever you desire of the people
55.952	who work for you or with you,
59.789	or your world --
61.161	will not happen exactly
61.161	as you would like it to happen.
66.651	But equally,
68.432	whatever the world desires of us --
70.179	whatever our partner,
70.179	our child, our colleague,
74.178	our industry,
75.391	our future demands of us,
78.102	will also not happen.
79.82	And what actually happens
81.797	is this frontier
81.797	between what you think is you
86.201	and what you think is not you.
88.607	And this frontier of actual meeting
91.222	between what we call a self
91.222	and what we call the world
94.34	is the only place, actually,
94.34	where things are real.
97.484	But it's quite astonishing,
99.094	how little time we spend
99.094	at this conversational frontier,
103.577	and not abstracted away from it
103.577	in one strategy or another.
109.456	I was coming through immigration,
114.221	which is quite a dramatic
114.221	border at the moment,
117.745	into the US last year,
120.755	and, you know, you get off
120.755	an international flight
123.215	across the Atlantic,
124.391	and you're not in the best place;
126.11	you're not at your most
126.11	spiritually mature.
128.687	You're quite impatient
128.687	with the rest of humanity, in fact.
131.976	So when you get up to immigration
131.976	with your shirt collar out
136.375	and a day's growth of beard,
137.888	and you have very little patience,
141.251	and the immigration officer
141.251	looked at my passport
144.003	"and said, ""What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"""
146.135	"I said, ""I work with the conversational"
146.135	"nature of reality."""
151.301	(Laughter)
156.784	And he leaned forward over his podium
159.077	"and he said, ""I needed you last night."""
162.031	(Laughter)
164.443	(Applause)
168.183	"And I said, ""I'm sorry,"
169.357	my powers as a poet
169.357	and philosopher only go so far.
172.464	"I'm not sure I can --"""
173.701	But before we knew it,
175.262	we were into a conversation
175.262	about his marriage.
178.716	Here he was in his uniform,
180.413	and the interesting thing was,
181.905	he was looking up and down
181.905	the row of officers
184.142	to make sure his supervisor didn't see
187.195	that we was having a real conversation.
191.048	But all of us live
191.048	at this conversational frontier
193.917	with the future.
196.029	I'd like to put you in the shoes
196.029	of my Irish niece,
199.807	Marlene McCormack,
201.582	standing on a cliff edge
201.582	on the western coast of Spain,
205.05	overlooking the broad Atlantic.
207.081	Twenty-three years old,
207.081	she's just walked 500 miles
210.862	from Saint Jean Pied de Port
210.862	on the French side of the Pyrenees,
214.468	all the way across Northern Spain,
216.269	on this very famous,
216.269	old and contemporary pilgrimage
220.304	called the Camino de Santiago
220.304	de Compostela --
223.863	the Path to Santiago of Compostela.
227.413	And when you get to Santiago, actually,
231.275	it can be something of an anticlimax,
233.074	because there are 100,000
233.074	people living there
235.42	who are not necessarily applauding you
235.42	as you're coming into town.
238.635	(Laughter)
239.66	And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you
239.66	a memento of your journey.
244.539	But you do have the possibility
244.539	of going on for three more days
250.15	to this place where Marlene stood,
250.15	called, in Spanish, Finisterre,
256.569	in English, Finisterre,
258.57	from the Latin,
258.57	"meaning ""the ends of the earth,"""
262.011	the place where ground turns to ocean;
265.082	the place where your present
265.082	turns into the future.
270.418	And Marlene had walked this way --
272.1	she just graduated as a 23-year-old
272.1	from the University of Sligo
275.818	with a degree in Irish drama.
278.219	"And she said to me, ""I don't think"
278.219	the major corporations of the world
281.635	"will be knocking on my door."""
283.064	"I said, ""Listen, I've worked"
283.064	in corporations all over the world
286.16	for decades;
287.337	a degree in drama is what would most
287.337	prepare you for the adult --
291.088	(Laughter)
292.129	"corporate world."""
293.308	(Applause)
295.56	"But she said, ""I'm not"
295.56	interested in that, anyway.
297.955	I don't want to teach drama,
297.955	I want to become a dramatist.
301.602	I want to write plays.
303.952	So I walked the Camino
303.952	in order to give myself some courage,
308.467	"in order to walk into my future."""
310.67	"And I said, ""What was the most powerful"
310.67	moment you had on the whole Camino,
314.34	"the very most powerful moment?"""
315.908	"She said, ""I had many powerful moments,"
317.84	but you know, the most powerful
317.84	moment was post-Camino,
321.884	was the three days you go on from Santiago
321.884	and come to this cliff edge.
326.16	And you go through three rituals.
327.8	The first ritual is to eat
327.8	"a tapas plate of scallops"" --"
332.445	or if you're vegetarian,
334.034	to contemplate the scallop shell.
336.511	(Laughter)
337.986	Because the scallop shell has been
337.986	the icon and badge of your walk,
342.298	and every arrow
342.298	that you have seen along that way
345.099	has been pointing underneath
345.099	a scallop shell.
349.188	So really, this first ritual is saying:
351.297	How did you get to this place?
353.229	How did you follow the path to get here?
356.783	How do you hold the conversation of life
356.783	when you feel unbesieged,
361.929	when you're unbullied,
363.111	when you're left to yourself?
364.543	How do you hold the conversation of life
364.543	that brings you to this place?
370.037	And the second ritual is that you burn
370.037	something that you've brought.
374.988	"I said, ""What did you burn, Marlene?"""
377.454	"She said, ""I burned a letter"
377.454	"and two postcards."""
380.459	"I said, ""Astonishing."
381.656	Twenty-three years old and you have paper.
383.724	"I can't believe it."""
384.924	(Laughter)
386.258	I'm sure there's a Camino app
387.933	where you can just delete
387.933	a traumatic text, you know?
392.365	(Laughter)
393.921	It will engage the flashlight,
395.961	imbue it with color
397.617	and disappear in a firework of flames.
401.977	But you either bring a letter
401.977	or you write one there,
405.184	and you burn it.
406.381	And of course we know intuitively
406.381	what is on those letters and postcards.
410.749	It's a form of affection and love
410.749	that is now no longer extant, yeah?
418.254	And then the third ritual:
421.014	between all these fires
421.014	are large piles of clothes.
426.225	And you leave an item of clothing
428.702	that has helped you to get to this place.
431.999	And I said to Marlene,
431.999	"""What did you leave at the cliff edge?"""
434.987	"She said, ""I left my boots --"
436.436	the very things
436.436	that I walked in, actually.
438.611	They were beautiful boots,
438.611	I loved those boots,
441.11	but they were finished
441.11	after seven weeks of walking.
444.12	So I walked away in my trainers,
445.669	"but I left my boots there."""
446.98	"She said, ""It was really incredible."
449.353	The most powerful moment was,
449.353	the sun was going down,
453.293	but the full moon was coming up behind me.
457.01	And the full moon was illuminated
457.01	by the dying sun in such a powerful way
462.45	that even after the sun
462.45	had dropped below the horizon,
465.152	the moon could still see that sun.
469.477	And I had a moon shadow,
471.91	and I was looking at my moon shadow
471.91	walking across the Atlantic,
477.052	across this ocean.
479.434	And I thought,
480.609	'Oh! That's my new self
480.609	going into the future.'
483.759	But suddenly I realized
483.759	the sun was falling further.
489.238	The moon was losing its reflection,
493.383	and my shadow was disappearing.
495.671	The most powerful moment
495.671	I had on the whole Camino
498.807	was when I realized I myself
498.807	had to walk across that unknown sea
504.819	"into my future."""
507.651	Well, I was so taken by this story,
509.497	I wrote this piece for her.
510.846	We were driving at the time;
512.375	we got home, I sat on the couch,
514.072	I wrote until two in the morning --
515.873	everyone had gone to bed --
517.291	and I gave it to Marlene
517.291	at breakfast time.
520.162	"It's called, ""Finisterre,"""
520.162	for Marlene McCormack.
526.142	"""The road in the end"
527.572	the road in the end
527.572	taking the path the sun had taken
532.328	the road in the end
532.328	taking the path the run had taken
536.043	into the western sea
538.461	the road in the end
538.461	taking the path the sun had taken
541.45	into the western sea
543.332	and the moon
544.523	the moon rising behind you
546.833	as you stood where ground turned to ocean:
551.215	no way to your future now
553.147	no way to your future now
554.363	except the way your shadow could take,
557.15	walking before you across water,
557.15	going where shadows go,
560.487	no way to make sense of a world
560.487	that wouldn't let you pass
565.337	except to call an end
565.337	to the way you had come,
570.262	to take out each letter you had brought
575.405	and light their illumined corners;
577.894	and to read them as they drifted
577.894	on the late western light;
583.002	to empty your bags
584.231	to empty your bags;
585.808	to sort this and to leave that
588.561	to sort this and to leave that;
591.941	to promise what you needed
591.941	to promise all along
596.189	to promise what you needed
596.189	to promise all along,
599.049	and to abandon the shoes
599.049	that brought you here
603.757	right at the water's edge,
605.63	not because you had given up
607.215	not because you had given up
608.86	but because now,
610.725	you would find a different way to tread,
612.932	and because, through it all,
614.699	part of you would still walk on,
617.124	no matter how,
618.632	"over the waves."""
622.331	"""Finisterre."""
623.79	For Marlene McCormack --
625.168	(Applause)
634.872	who has already had
634.872	her third play performed
637.681	in off-off-off-off-Broadway --
640.82	in Dublin.
642.009	(Laughter)
643.046	But she's on her way.
645.28	This is the last piece.
647.209	This is about the supposed arrival
647.209	at the sum of all of our endeavors.
653.742	In Santiago itself --
655.178	it could be Santiago,
656.44	it could be Mecca,
657.769	it could be Varanasi,
658.961	it could be Kyoto,
660.547	it could be that threshold
660.547	you've set for yourself,
665.408	the disturbing approach
665.408	to the consummation of all your goals.
672.941	And one of the difficulties
672.941	about walking into your life,
677.525	about coming into this body,
678.982	into this world fully,
681.877	is you start to realize
683.842	that you have manufactured
683.842	three abiding illusions
690.173	that the rest of humanity has shared
690.173	with you since the beginning of time.
694.219	And the first illusion
694.219	is that you can somehow construct a life
699.051	in which you are not vulnerable.
702.475	You can somehow be immune
702.475	to all of the difficulties
707.315	and ill health and losses
711.523	that humanity has been subject to
711.523	since the beginning of time.
715.895	If we look out at the natural world,
717.635	there's no part of that world
719.163	that doesn't go through cycles
719.163	of, first, incipience,
723.139	or hiddenness,
724.365	but then growth, fullness,
727.533	but then a beautiful,
727.533	to begin with, disappearance,
731.079	and then a very austere,
731.079	full disappearance.
734.126	We look at that, we say,
734.126	"""That's beautiful,"
736.257	but can I just have the first half
736.257	of the equation, please?
740.554	And when the disappearance is happening,
742.573	I'll close my eyes and wait
742.573	"for the new cycle to come around."""
745.649	Which means most human beings
745.649	are at war with reality
752.624	The mature identity
757.445	is able to live in the full cycle.
760.703	The second illusion is,
762.38	I can construct a life
762.38	in which I will not have my heart broken.
766.922	Romance is the first place
766.922	we start to do it.
769.594	When you're at the beginning
769.594	of a new romance or a new marriage,
773.042	"you say, ""I have found the person"
773.042	"who will not break my heart."""
777.625	I'm sorry;
778.994	you have chosen them out unconsciously
778.994	for that exact core competency.
784.416	(Laughter)
785.75	They will break your heart.
787.111	Why?
788.291	Because you care about them.
789.925	You look at parenting, yeah?
792.115	"Parenting: ""I will be"
792.115	"the perfect mother and father."""
795.869	Your children will break your heart.
798.206	And they don't even have to do
798.206	anything spectacular or dramatic.
802.897	But usually, they do do something
802.897	spectacular or dramatic --
806.83	(Laughter)
807.875	to break your heart.
809.915	And then they live with you
809.915	as spies and saboteurs for years,
813.315	watching your every psychological move,
816.177	and spotting your every weakness.
818.899	And one day,
820.089	when they're about 14 years old,
822.241	with your back turned to them,
823.735	in the kitchen,
825.003	while you're making something for them --
827.19	(Laughter)
828.222	the psychological stiletto goes in.
830.753	(Laughter)
833.812	(Applause)
838.502	"And you say, ""How did you know"
838.502	"exactly where to place it?"""
842.596	(Laughter)
843.635	And they say,
844.818	"""I've been watching you for --"
846.367	(Laughter)
847.402	"a good few years."""
851.487	And then we hope that our armored,
851.487	professional personalities
856.916	will prevent us from having our
856.916	heart broken in work.
860.685	But if you're sincere about your work,
863.797	it should break your heart.
865.993	You should get to thresholds
867.805	where you do not know how to proceed.
871.852	You do not know how to get
871.852	from here to there.
876.619	What does that do?
877.807	It puts you into a proper
877.807	relationship with reality.
881.083	Why?
882.257	Because you have to ask for help.
890.779	Heartbreak.
892.191	We don't have a choice about heartbreak,
894.327	we only have a choice
894.327	of having our hearts broken
898.326	over people and things and projects
898.326	that we deeply care about.
905.224	And the last illusion is,
907.316	I can somehow plan enough
907.316	and arrange things
911.777	that I will be able to see
911.777	the path to the end
915.416	right from where I'm standing,
917.114	right to the horizon.
920.041	But when you think about it,
921.868	the only environment
921.868	in which that would be true
925.291	would be a flat desert,
928.668	empty of any other life.
932.881	But even in a flat desert,
934.502	the curvature of the earth
934.502	would take the path away from you.
938.584	So, no;
940.162	you see the path,
941.801	and then you don't
943.707	and then you see it again.
945.666	"So this is ""Santiago,"""
948.688	the supposed arrival,
951.225	which is a kind of return
951.225	to the beginning all at the same time.
955.608	We have this experience of the journey,
957.978	which is in all of our great
957.978	spiritual traditions,
960.708	of pilgrimage.
961.885	But just by actually standing
961.885	in the ground of your life fully,
966.179	not trying to abstract yourself
966.179	into a strategic future
970.293	that's actually just an escape
970.293	from present heartbreak;
973.974	the ability to stand
973.974	in the ground of your life
976.807	and to look at the horizon
976.807	that is pulling you --
980.22	in that moment,
981.562	you are the whole journey.
983.064	You are the whole conversation.
987.563	"""Santiago."""
988.737	"""The road seen, then not seen"
991.743	the road seen, then not seen
995.84	the hillside hiding then revealing
995.84	the way you should take
1000.598	the road seen, then not seen
1003.372	the hillside hiding then revealing
1003.372	the way you should take,
1008.472	the road dropping away from you
1012.146	as if leaving you to walk on thin air,
1016.92	then catching you,
1018.119	catching you,
1019.383	holding you up,
1019.383	when you thought you would fall,

1032.541	the way forward always in the end
1034.442	the way that you came,
1035.622	the way that you followed,
1035.622	the way that carried you into your future,
1038.98	that brought you to this place,
1040.724	that brought you to this place,
1043.211	no matter that it sometimes
1043.211	had to take your promise from you,
1048.493	no matter that it always
1048.493	had to break your heart along the way:
1054.517	the sense
1055.722	the sense of having walked
1055.722	from deep inside yourself
1060.345	out into the revelation,
1063.302	to have risked yourself
1065.068	for something that seemed to stand
1065.068	both inside you and far beyond you,
1071.062	and that called you back in the end
1073.583	to the only road you could follow,
1076.247	walking as you did, in your rags of love
1080.624	walking as you did, in your rags of love
1083.54	and speaking in the voice that by night
1083.54	became a prayer for safe arrival,
1090.485	so that one day
1092.236	one day you realized
1094.377	that what you wanted
1094.377	had actually already happened
1097.884	one day you realized
1099.86	that what you wanted
1099.86	had actually already happened
1102.241	and long ago
1103.416	and in the dwelling place
1103.416	in which you lived before you began,
1107.417	and that
1108.597	and that every step along the way,
1111.237	every step along the way,
1112.908	you had carried the heart
1112.908	and the mind and the promise
1116.759	that first set you off
1116.759	and then drew you on,
1119.67	and that
1120.857	and that you were more marvelous
1125.754	in your simple wish to find a way
1128.042	you were more marvelous
1128.042	in your simple wish to find a way
1132.043	than the gilded roofs
1132.043	of any destination you could reach
1136.304	you were more marvelous
1136.304	in that simple wish to find a way
1140.065	than the gilded roofs
1140.065	of any destination you could reach:
1142.995	as if, all along,
1144.196	you had thought the end point
1144.196	might be a city with golden domes,
1147.313	and cheering crowds,
1148.792	and turning the corner
1150.763	at what you thought
1150.763	was the end of the road,
1155.134	you found just a simple reflection,
1159.215	and a clear revelation
1159.215	beneath the face looking back
1162.816	and beneath it another invitation,
1167.168	all in one glimpse
1169.591	all in one glimpse:
1171.262	like a person
1173.549	like a person or a place
1173.549	you had sought forever
1176.99	like a person or a place
1176.99	you had sought forever,
1180.501	like a bold field of freedom
1180.501	that beckoned you beyond;
1184.852	like another life
1186.233	like another life,
1188.042	and the road
1189.333	"the road still stretching on."""
