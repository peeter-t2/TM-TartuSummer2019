12.48	Over our lifetimes,
14.16	we've all contributed to climate change.
17.92	Actions, choices and behaviors
21.48	will have led to an increase
21.48	in greenhouse gas emissions.
26.12	And I think that that's
26.12	quite a powerful thought.
29.2	But it does have the potential
29.2	to make us feel guilty
32.64	when we think about decisions
32.64	we might have made
35.44	around where to travel to,
37.96	how often and how,
40.72	about the energy that we choose to use
43.32	in our homes or in our workplaces,
46.48	or quite simply the lifestyles
46.48	that we lead and enjoy.
51.8	But we can also turn
51.8	that thought on its head,
55.16	and think that if we've had
55.16	such a profound
57.72	but a negative impact
57.72	on our climate already,
61	then we have an opportunity to influence
61	the amount of future climate change
66.32	that we will need to adapt to.
69.32	So we have a choice.
70.8	We can either choose to start
70.8	to take climate change seriously,
75.24	and significantly cut and mitigate
75.24	our greenhouse gas emissions,
79.92	and then we will have to adapt to less
79.92	of the climate change impacts in future.
85.12	Alternatively, we can continue to really
85.12	ignore the climate change problem.
90.72	But if we do that, we are also choosing
93.36	to adapt to very much more powerful
93.36	climate impacts in future.
98.32	And not only that.
99.56	As people who live in countries
99.56	with high per capita emissions,
102.96	we're making that choice
102.96	on behalf of others as well.
107.12	But the choice that we don't have
109.12	is a no climate change future.
113.28	Over the last two decades,
115.28	our government negotiators
115.28	and policymakers have been coming together
119.16	to discuss climate change,
121.44	and they've been focused on
121.44	avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming
125.88	above pre-industrial levels.
128.52	That's the temperature that's associated
128.52	with dangerous impacts
132.12	across a range of different indicators,
135.12	to humans and to the environment.
137.76	So two degrees centigrade
137.76	constitutes dangerous climate change.
142.544	But dangerous climate change
142.544	can be subjective.
144.76	So if we think about
144.76	an extreme weather event
147.08	that might happen
147.08	in some part of the world,
149.44	and if that happens in a part of the world
149.44	where there is good infrastructure,
153.44	where there are people
153.44	that are well-insured and so on,
156.52	then that impact can be disruptive.
160.16	It can cause upset, it could cause cost.
163.44	It could even cause some deaths.
165.6	But if that exact same weather event
165.6	happens in a part of the world
169.12	where there is poor infrastructure,
171.16	or where people are not well-insured,
173.4	or they're not having
173.4	good support networks,
175.84	then that same climate change impact
175.84	could be devastating.
180.32	It could cause a significant loss of home,
183.88	but it could also cause
183.88	significant amounts of death.
187.8	So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions
187.8	at the left-hand side
191.8	from fossil fuel and industry,
193.64	and time from before
193.64	the Industrial Revolution
196.64	out towards the present day.
198.84	And what's immediately striking about this
201.32	is that emissions
201.32	have been growing exponentially.
205.16	If we focus in on a shorter
205.16	period of time from 1950,
209.4	we have established in 1988
212.52	the Intergovernmental Panel
212.52	on Climate Change,
215.92	the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,
219.32	then rolling on a few years,
219.32	in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,
224	where it established avoiding
224	a two-degree temperature rise
228.48	in keeping with the science
228.48	and on the basis of equity.
232.68	And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.
236.64	And all the way through,
236.64	during all of these meetings
239.48	and many others as well,
241.44	emissions have continued to rise.
244.92	And if we focus on our historical
244.92	emission trend in recent years,
250.16	and we put that together
250.16	with our understanding
252.4	of the direction of travel
252.4	in our global economy,
255.28	then we are much more on track
257.04	for a four-degree centigrade
257.04	global warming
260.44	than we are for the two-degree centigrade.
264.4	Now, let's just pause for a moment
266.16	and think about this four-degree
266.16	global average temperature.
270.6	Most of our planet
270.6	is actually made up of the sea.
274.56	Now, because the sea has a greater
274.56	thermal inertia than the land,
278.56	the average temperatures over land
278.56	are actually going to be higher
281.68	than they are over the sea.
283.64	The second thing is that we
283.64	as human beings don't experience
287.28	global average temperatures.
289.2	We experience hot days, cold days,
292.04	rainy days, especially if you live
292.04	in Manchester like me.
295.8	So now put yourself in a city center.
298.48	Imagine somewhere in the world:
300.08	Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London.
303.48	It's the hottest day
303.48	that you've ever experienced.
307.04	There's sun beating down,
308.52	there's concrete and glass all around you.
311.64	Now imagine that same day --
313.84	but it's six, eight,
313.84	maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer
318.76	on that day during that heat wave.
320.92	That's the kind of thing
320.92	we're going to experience
323.278	under a four-degree global
323.278	average temperature scenario.
327.96	And the problem with these extremes,
329.76	and not just the temperature extremes,
331.6	but also the extremes in terms of storms
331.6	and other climate impacts,
335.68	is our infrastructure is just not set up
335.68	to deal with these sorts of events.
340.52	So our roads and our rail networks
342.44	have been designed to last for a long time
344.64	and withstand only
344.64	certain amounts of impacts
347.32	in different parts of the world.
348.96	And this is going to be
348.96	extremely challenged.
351.24	Our power stations
351.24	are expected to be cooled by water
354.8	to a certain temperature
354.8	to remain effective and resilient.
358.88	And our buildings
358.88	are designed to be comfortable
361.16	within a particular temperature range.
363.4	And this is all going to be
363.4	significantly challenged
366.56	under a four-degree-type scenario.
368.84	Our infrastructure has not been
368.84	designed to cope with this.
374.44	So if we go back, also thinking
374.44	about four degrees,
378.32	it's not just the direct impacts,
380.32	but also some indirect impacts.
382.64	So if we take food security, for example.
385.92	Maize and wheat yields
388.16	in some parts of the world
389.84	are expected to be up to 40 percent lower
393.2	under a four-degree scenario,
395.24	rice up to 30 percent lower.
398.16	This will be absolutely devastating
398.16	for global food security.
402.68	So all in all, the kinds
402.68	of impacts anticipated
405.64	under this four-degree centigrade scenario
409	are going to be incompatible
409	with global organized living.
415.84	So back to our trajectories and our graphs
415.84	of four degrees and two degrees.
420.96	Is it reasonable still
420.96	to focus on the two-degree path?
424.92	There are quite a lot of my colleagues
424.92	and other scientists
427.76	who would say that it's now too late
427.76	to avoid a two-degree warming.
431.857	But I would just like
431.857	to draw on my own research
434.12	on energy systems, on food systems,
437.2	aviation and also shipping,
439.6	just to say that I think there is still
439.6	a small fighting chance
443.68	of avoiding this two-degree
443.68	dangerous climate change.
447.32	But we really need
447.32	to get to grips with the numbers
449.725	to work out how to do it.
451.84	So if you focus in on this trajectory
451.84	and these graphs,
455.08	the yellow circle there
455.08	highlights that the departure
458.08	from the red four-degree pathway
460.6	to the two-degree
460.6	green pathway is immediate.
465.04	And that's because
465.04	of cumulative emissions,
468.04	or the carbon budget.
469.64	So in other words, because
469.64	of the lights and the projectors
473.32	that are on in this room right now,
475.04	the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere
477.017	as a result of that
477.017	electricity consumption
479.68	lasts a very long time.
481.2	Some of it will be in our atmosphere
481.2	for a century, maybe much longer.
485.24	It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases
485.24	tend to be cumulative.
489.76	And that tells us something
489.76	about these trajectories.
492.6	First of all, it tells us that it's
492.6	the area under these curves that matter,
496.64	not where we reach
496.64	at a particular date in future.
499.64	And that's important,
499.64	because it doesn't matter
501.855	if we come up with some amazing
501.855	whiz-bang technology
504.68	to sort out our energy problem
504.68	on the last day of 2049,
508.56	just in the nick of time
508.56	to sort things out.
510.88	Because in the meantime,
510.88	emissions will have accumulated.
514.72	So if we continue on this red,
514.72	four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,
520.32	the longer we continue on it,
522.24	that will need to be
522.24	made up for in later years
525.64	to keep the same carbon budget,
525.64	to keep the same area under the curve,
529.96	which means that that trajectory,
529.96	the red one there, becomes steeper.
534.08	So in other words, if we don't reduce
534.08	emissions in the short to medium term,
537.84	then we'll have to make more significant
537.84	year-on-year emission reductions.
542.6	We also know that we have
542.6	to decarbonize our energy system.
546.2	But if we don't start to cut
546.2	emissions in the short to medium term,
550.12	then we will have to do that even sooner.
553.08	So this poses really big
553.08	challenges for us.
558.08	The other thing it does is tells us
558.08	something about energy policy.
561.76	If you live in a part of the world where
561.76	per capita emissions are already high,
565.72	it points us towards
565.72	reducing energy demand.
569.8	And that's because
569.8	with all the will in the world,
572.16	the large-scale engineering infrastructure
574.72	that we need to roll out rapidly
576.88	to decarbonize the supply side
576.88	of our energy system
580	is just simply not going
580	to happen in time.
582.68	So it doesn't matter
582.68	whether we choose nuclear power
585.16	or carbon capture and storage,
587.04	upscale our biofuel production,
589.4	or go for a much bigger roll-out
589.4	of wind turbines and wave turbines.
593.64	All of that will take time.
595.72	So because it's the area
595.72	under the curve that matters,
598.28	we need to focus on energy efficiency,
600.24	but also on energy conservation --
600.24	in other words, using less energy.
605.2	And if we do that, that also means
607.44	that as we continue to roll out
607.44	the supply-side technology,
611.381	we will have less of a job to do
611.381	if we've actually managed
614.12	to reduce our energy consumption,
616.44	because we will then need
616.44	less infrastructure on the supply side.
621.72	Another issue that we really
621.72	need to grapple with
624.32	is the issue of well-being and equity.
627.96	There are many parts of the world where
627.96	the standard of living needs to rise.
633.44	Bbut with energy systems
633.44	currently reliant on fossil fuel,
638.2	as those economies grow
638.2	so will emissions.
641.32	And now, if we're all constrained
641.32	by the same amount of carbon budget,
644.92	that means that if some parts of
644.92	the world's emissions are needing to rise,
648.48	then other parts of the world's
648.48	emissions need to reduce.
653	So that poses very significant challenges
653	for wealthy nations.
657.92	Because according to our research,
660.705	if you're in a country where per capita
660.705	emissions are really high --
663.92	so North America, Europe, Australia --
667.88	emissions reductions of the order
667.88	of 10 percent per year,
671.16	and starting immediately,
671.16	will be required for a good chance
675.24	of avoiding the two-degree target.
678.12	Let me just put that into context.
679.92	The economist Nicholas Stern
681.76	said that emission reductions
681.76	of more than one percent per year
685	had only ever been associated
685	with economic recession or upheaval.
691	So this poses huge challenges
691	for the issue of economic growth,
697.36	because if we have our
697.36	high carbon infrastructure in place,
701.28	it means that if our economies grow,
704.04	then so do our emissions.
706.24	So I'd just like to take
706.24	a quote from a paper
708.36	by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011
712.24	where we said that to avoid the two-degree
712.24	framing of dangerous climate change,
718	economic growth needs to be exchanged
718	at least temporarily
722.24	for a period of planned austerity
722.24	in wealthy nations.
728.36	This is a really difficult
728.36	message to take,
732.2	because what it suggests is that
732.2	we really need to do things differently.
737.44	This is not about just incremental change.
741.96	This is about doing things differently,
741.96	about whole system change,
746.28	and sometimes
746.28	it's about doing less things.
750	And this applies to all of us,
752.44	whatever sphere of influence we have.
755.04	So it could be from writing
755.04	to our local politician
758.16	to talking to our boss at work
758.16	or being the boss at work,
761.68	or talking with our friends and family,
761.68	or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.
767.28	Because we really need
767.28	to make significant change.
770.92	At the moment, we're choosing
770.92	a four-degree scenario.
775.16	If we really want to avoid
775.16	the two-degree scenario,
778.52	there really is no time
778.52	like the present to act.
782.12	Thank you.
783.36	(Applause)
792.827	Bruno Giussani: Alice,
792.827	basically what you're saying,
795.28	the talk is, unless wealthy nations
795.28	start cutting 10 percent per year
798.76	the emissions now, this year,
798.76	not in 2020 or '25,
803.64	we are going to go straight
803.64	to the four-plus-degree scenario.
808.16	I am wondering what's your take
808.16	on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.
811.92	Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just
811.92	nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.
815.52	One of the things that often --
817.028	when there are these modeling studies
817.028	that look at what we need to do,
820.6	is they tend to hugely overestimate
820.6	how quickly other countries in the world
825.12	can start to reduce emissions.
826.72	So they make kind of
826.72	heroic assumptions about that.
830.08	The more we do that,
830.08	because it's the cumulative emissions,
832.866	the short-term stuff that really matters.
834.832	So it does make a huge difference.
836.491	If a big country like China, for example,
838.48	continues to grow
838.48	even for just a few extra years,
840.92	that will make a big difference
840.92	to when we need to decarbonize.
843.96	So I don't think we can even say
843.96	when it will be,
846.48	because it all depends
846.48	on what we have to do in the short term.
849.464	But I think we've just got huge scope,
849.464	and we don't pull those levers
852.76	that allow us to reduce
852.76	the energy demand, which is a shame.
855.998	BG: Alice, thank you for coming
855.998	to TED and sharing this data.
858.88	ABL: Thank you.
860.12	(Applause)
