13.674	A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,
18.038	Einstein published
18.038	his theory of general relativity,
21.77	which is sort of a strange name,
24.028	but it's a theory that explains gravity.
27.395	It states that mass -- all matter,
27.395	the planets -- attracts mass,
31.737	not because of an instantaneous force,
31.737	as Newton claimed,
36.375	but because all matter --
36.375	all of us, all the planets --
40.362	wrinkles the flexible fabric
40.362	of space-time.
45.128	Space-time is this thing in which we live
45.128	and that connects us all.
49.905	It's like when we lie down on a mattress
49.905	and distort its contour.
55.938	The masses move -- again,
55.938	not according to Newton's laws,
60.894	but because they see
60.894	this space-time curvature
64.825	and follow the little curves,
67.672	just like when our bedmate
67.672	nestles up to us
71.26	because of the mattress curvature.
73.596	(Laughter)
76.841	A year later, in 1916,
79.809	Einstein derived from his theory
84.224	that gravitational waves existed,
88.061	and that these waves were produced
88.061	when masses move,
91.22	like, for example, when two stars
91.22	revolve around one another
96.049	and create folds in space-time
96.049	which carry energy from the system,
101.033	and the stars move toward each other.
104.148	However, he also estimated
107.103	that these effects were so minute,
111.879	that it would never be possible
111.879	to measure them.
115.323	I'm going to tell you the story of how,
117.653	with the work of hundreds of scientists
117.653	working in many countries
124.137	over the course of many decades,
125.947	just recently, in 2015,
129.58	we discovered those gravitational
129.58	waves for the first time.
135.542	It's a rather long story.
138.598	It started 1.3 billion years ago.
145.017	A long, long time ago,
147.574	in a galaxy far, far away --
150.789	(Laughter)
152.606	two black holes were revolving
152.606	around one another --
158.249	"""dancing the tango,"" I like to say."
161.161	It started slowly,
162.736	but as they emitted gravitational waves,
165.862	they grew closer together,
165.862	accelerating in speed,
168.825	until, when they were revolving
168.825	at almost the speed of light,
172.448	they fused into a single black hole
175.667	that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,
179.325	but compressed
179.325	into the space of 360 kilometers.
183.851	That's the size of the state of Louisiana,
186.886	where I live.
188.669	This incredible effect
188.669	produced gravitational waves
194.289	that carried the news of this cosmic hug
194.289	to the rest of the universe.
201.893	It took us a long time to figure out
201.893	the effects of these gravitational waves,
208.827	because the way we measure them
208.827	is by looking for effects in distances.
215.59	We want to measure longitudes, distances.
218.73	When these gravitational waves
218.73	passed by Earth,
221.887	which was in 2015,
224.76	they produced changes in all distances --
228.815	the distances between all of you,
228.815	the distances between you and me,
232.455	our heights --
233.675	every one of us
233.675	stretched and shrank a tiny bit.
238.303	The prediction is that the effect
238.303	is proportional to the distance.
242.904	But it's very small:
244.718	even for distances much greater
244.718	than my slight height,
249.6	the effect is infinitesimal.
253.443	For example, the distance
253.443	between the Earth and the Sun
257.965	changed by one atomic diameter.
263	How can that be measured?
264.902	How could we measure it?
268.571	Fifty years ago,
270.953	some visionary physicists
270.953	at Caltech and MIT --
275.181	Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --
277.91	thought they could precisely
277.91	measure distances
281.98	using lasers that measured
281.98	distances between mirrors
287.187	kilometers apart.
290.478	It took many years, a lot of work
290.478	and many scientists
294.522	to develop the technology
294.522	and develop the ideas.
297.781	And 20 years later,
300.112	almost 30 years ago,
303.164	they started to build two gravitational
303.164	wave detectors, two interferometers,
309.201	in the United States.
311.307	Each one is four kilometers long;
315.014	one is in Livingston, Louisiana,
319.636	in the middle of a beautiful forest,
322.592	and the other is in Hanford, Washington,
326.444	in the middle of the desert.
329.094	The interferometers have lasers
332.203	that travel from the center
332.203	through four kilometers in-vacuum,
336.153	are reflected in mirrors
336.153	and then they return.
339.018	We measure the difference in the distances
341.686	between this arm and this arm.
344.546	These detectors are very,
344.546	very, very sensitive;
348.771	they're the most precise
348.771	instruments in the world.
353.115	Why did we make two?
354.73	It's because the signals
354.73	that we want to measure come from space,
360.353	but the mirrors are moving all the time,
362.842	so in order to distinguish
362.842	the gravitational wave effects --
366.869	which are astrophysical effects
366.869	and should show up on the two detectors --
371.237	we can distinguish them
371.237	from the local effects,
374.102	which appear separately,
374.102	either on one or the other.
379.323	In September of 2015,
382.099	we were finishing installing
382.099	the second-generation technology
387.092	in the detectors,
389.333	and we still weren't at the optimal
389.333	sensitivity that we wanted --
393.732	we're still not, even now,
393.732	two years later --
397.128	but we wanted to gather data.
399.679	We didn't think we'd see anything,
401.719	but we were getting ready to start
401.719	collecting a few months' worth of data.
405.924	And then nature surprised us.
409.454	On September 14, 2015,
413.761	we saw, in both detectors,
416.847	a gravitational wave.
419.05	In both detectors, we saw a signal
421.546	with cycles that increased
421.546	in amplitude and frequency
424.582	and then go back down.
425.859	And they were the same in both detectors.
429.315	They were gravitational waves.
432.028	And not only that --
432.028	in decoding this type of wave,
437.249	we were able to deduce
437.249	that they came from black holes
441.281	fusing together to make one,
443.298	more than a billion years ago.
447.613	And that was --
448.82	(Applause)
456.339	that was fantastic.
458.994	At first, we couldn't believe it.
462.497	We didn't imagine
462.497	this would happen until much later;
466.101	it was a surprise for all of us.
468.577	It took us months to convince
468.577	ourselves that it was true,
471.282	because we didn't want to leave
471.282	any room for error.
474.818	But it was true, and to clear up any doubt
477.835	that the detectors
477.835	really could measure these things,
480.891	in December of that same year,
482.809	we measured another gravitational wave,
485.713	smaller than the first one.
487.152	The first gravitational wave
487.152	produced a difference in the distance
490.989	of four-thousandths of a proton
494.651	over four kilometers.
496.01	Yes, the second detection was smaller,
498.528	but still very convincing
498.528	by our standards.
505.064	Despite the fact that these are space-time
505.064	waves and not sound waves,
509.612	we like to put them into loudspeakers
509.612	and listen to them.
514.315	"We call this ""the music of the universe."""
517.834	I'd like you to listen
517.834	to the first two notes of that music.
523.102	(Chirping sound)
526.448	(Chirping sound)
528.6	The second, shorter sound
528.6	was the last fraction of a second
533.49	of the two black holes which,
535.308	in that fraction of a second,
535.308	emitted vast amounts of energy --
540.262	so much energy, it was like three Suns
540.262	converting into energy,
546.937	following that famous formula,
548.537	E = mc2.
550.318	Remember that one?
552.473	We love this music so much
552.473	we actually dance to it.
558.031	I'm going to have you listen again.
562.546	(Chirping sound)
566.558	(Chirping sound)
569.303	It's the music of the universe!
571.327	(Applause)
575.017	People frequently ask me now:
578.163	"""What can gravitational waves"
578.163	be used for?
581.455	And now that you've discovered them,
581.455	"what else is there left to do?"""
586.39	What can gravitational waves
586.39	be used for?
590.034	When they asked Borges,
590.034	"""What is the purpose of poetry?"""
594.376	he, in turn, answered,
596.241	"""What's the purpose of dawn?"
597.961	What's the purpose of caresses?
599.985	What's the purpose
599.985	"of the smell of coffee?"""
602.58	He answered,
604.448	"""The purpose of poetry is pleasure;"
604.448	"it's for emotion, it's for living."""
611.769	And understanding the universe,
613.457	this human curiosity for knowing
613.457	how everything works,
617.131	is similar.
619.177	Since time immemorial, humanity --
619.177	all of us, everyone, as kids --
624.66	when we look up at the sky
624.66	for the first time and see the stars,
628.553	we wonder,
629.74	"""What are stars?"""
631.847	That curiosity is what makes us human.
635.174	And that's what we do with science.
639.856	We like to say that gravitational waves
639.856	now have a purpose,
645.64	because we're opening up
645.64	a new way to explore the universe.
649.847	Until now, we were able to see
649.847	the light of the stars
654.15	via electromagnetic waves.
657.168	Now we can listen
657.168	to the sound of the universe,
661.768	even of things that don't emit light,
661.768	like gravitational waves.
667.667	(Applause)
668.955	Thank you.
670.131	(Applause)
673.556	But are they useful?
676.325	Can't we derive any technology
676.325	from gravitational waves?
681.507	Yes, probably.
683.04	But it will probably take a lot of time.
685.652	We've developed
685.652	the technology to detect them,
688.34	but in terms of the waves themselves,
690.401	maybe we'll discover 100 years from now
690.401	that they are useful.
694.685	But it takes a lot of time
694.685	to derive technology from science,
698.763	and that's not why we do it.
700.373	All technology is derived from science,
702.672	but we practice science for the enjoyment.
706.64	What's left to do?
709.386	A lot.
710.851	A lot; this is only the beginning.
714.613	As we make the detectors
714.613	more and more sensitive --
717.731	and we have lots of work to do there --
719.672	not only are we going to see
719.672	more black holes
721.941	and be able to catalog
721.941	how many there are, where they are
726.269	and how big they are,
727.865	we'll also be able to see other objects.
731.296	We'll see neutron stars fuse
731.296	and turn into black holes.
736.913	We'll see a black holes being born.
739.536	We'll be able to see
739.536	rotating stars in our galaxy
742.698	produce sinusoidal waves.
744.93	We'll be able to see
744.93	explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.
750.792	We'll be seeing
750.792	a whole spectrum of new sources.
755.641	We like to say
757.637	that we've added a new sense
757.637	to the human body:
761.262	now, in addition to seeing,
762.984	we're able to hear.
765.101	This is a revolution in astronomy,
768.672	like when Galileo invented the telescope.
772.859	It's like when they added sound
772.859	to silent movies.
777.11	This is just the beginning.
781.12	We like to think
783.5	that the road to science is very long --
783.5	very fun, but very long --
789.791	and that we, this large,
789.791	international community of scientists,
796.178	working from many countries,
796.178	together as a team,
798.762	are helping to build that road;
802.048	that we're shedding light --
802.048	sometimes encountering detours --
806.488	and building, perhaps,
808.915	a highway to the universe.
811.931	Thank you.
813.13	(Applause)
