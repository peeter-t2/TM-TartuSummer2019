13.25	This will not be a speech
14.516	like any one I have ever given.
17.807	I will talk to you today about
21.297	the failure of leadership in global politics
26.187	and in our globalizing economy.
29.185	And I won't provide some feel-good, ready-made solutions.
36.138	But I will in the end urge you
38.672	to rethink, actually take risks, and get involved
44.115	in what I see as a global evolution
47.52	of democracy.
50.33	Failure of leadership.
52.585	What is the failure of leadership today?
55.346	And why is our democracy not working?
58.813	Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact
61.444	that we have taken you out of the process.
65.997	So let me, from my personal experiences,
68.513	give you an insight, so that you can step back
72.742	and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope
76.414	with the challenges of today and why politics
78.489	is going down a blind alley.
82.133	Let's start from the beginning.
84.63	Let's start from democracy.
88.426	Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,
90.451	it was a revelation, a discovery,
93.64	that we had the potential, together,
98.157	to be masters of our own fate,
101.878	to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,
104.75	and then to design a better life.
108.083	And democracy was the political innovation
113.269	which protected this freedom,
115.771	because we were liberated from fear
121.086	so that our minds in fact,
122.739	whether they be despots or dogmas,
125.461	could be the protagonists.
129.864	Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us
132.853	to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants
136.241	or of high priests,
138.988	their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.
143.826	Well, I first began to understand this
145.436	when I was 14 years old.
147.558	I used to, to try to avoid homework,
149.668	sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents
154.844	and their friends debate heatedly.
156.544	You see, then Greece was
158.922	under control of a very powerful establishment
163.159	which was strangling the country,
164.906	and my father was heading a promising movement
167.599	to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece
170.419	where freedom reigned and where, maybe,
172.862	the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.
176.573	I used to join him in many of the campaigns,
178.869	and you can see me here next to him.
180.808	I'm the younger one there, to the side.
183.276	You may not recognize me because
186.384	I used to part my hair differently there.
188.612	(Laughter)
190.489	So in 1967, elections were coming,
194.636	things were going well in the campaign,
196.48	the house was electric.
198.491	We really could sense that there was going to be
200.779	a major progressive change in Greece.
204.776	Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.
209.728	Soldiers storm the door.
212.106	They find me up on the top terrace.
216.276	A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun,
218.231	puts it to my head, and says,
220.19	"""Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."""
224.542	My father, hiding nearby, reveals himself,
228.724	and was summarily taken to prison.
232.889	Well, we survived, but democracy did not.
236.625	Seven brutal years of dictatorship
239.137	which we spent in exile.
242.929	Now, today, our democracies are again
245.153	facing a moment of truth.
247.432	Let me tell you a story.
249.259	Sunday evening,
251.543	Brussels, April 2010.
254.662	I'm sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.
258.215	I had just been elected prime minister,
261.698	but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
265.291	that our deficit was not 6 percent,
268.712	as had been officially reported only a few days earlier
272.258	before the elections by the previous government,
275.227	but actually 15.6 percent.
280.115	But the deficit was only the symptom
282.547	of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,
284.863	and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,
288.794	to tackle these problems,
290.039	whether it was lack of transparency
292.773	and accountability in governance,
295.074	or whether it was a clientelistic state
297.74	offering favors to the powerful -- tax avoidance
302.293	abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,
307.02	politics and media captured by special interests.
310.452	But despite our electoral mandate,
313.452	the markets mistrusted us.
316.667	Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,
319.433	and we were facing possible default.
322.34	So I went to Brussels on a mission
325.62	to make the case for a united European response,
329.634	one that would calm the markets and give us the time
332.934	to make the necessary reforms.
335.94	But time we didn't get.
338.844	Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.
341.98	Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,
344.871	progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,
347.748	a prime minister shouts out,
349.32	"""We have to finish in 10 minutes."""
351.84	"I said, ""Why? These are important decisions."
354.473	"Let's deliberate a little bit longer."""
356.628	Another prime minister comes in and says,
359.711	"""No, we have to have an agreement now,"
363.043	because in 10 minutes,
365.395	the markets are opening up in Japan,
368.96	"and there will be havoc in the global economy."""
373.409	We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.
376.822	This time it was not the military,
379.098	but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.
385.586	What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,
389.769	painful to me, painful to my countrymen,
393.996	imposing cuts, austerity,
397.018	often on those not to blame for the crisis.
400.244	With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy
403.371	and the eurozone avoided a collapse.
406.523	Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,
409.171	and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.
412.289	But I think today that most would agree
415.336	that Greece was only a symptom
417.702	of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,
421.379	vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,
425.571	vulnerabilities of our democracies.
428.217	Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,
432.554	or, more accurately, too big to control.
435.923	Our democracies are weakened in the global economy
438.252	with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,
441.723	evade environmental or labor standards.
445.044	Our democracies are undermined
447.926	by the growing inequality
450.084	and the growing concentration of power and wealth,
453.864	lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets
457.518	or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,
462.357	have constrained our democracies,
465.077	and they have constrained our capacity
467.965	to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,
471.963	in finding solutions.
474.478	Greece, you see, was only a preview
476.933	of what is in store for us all.
479.31	I, overly optimistically, had hoped
481	that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,
484.791	for the world, to make radical democratic transformations
489.266	in our institutions.
491.143	Instead, I had a very humbling experience.
495.04	In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again
499.521	to find common solutions,
501.43	I realized that not one, not one of us,
505.103	had ever dealt with a similar crisis.
508.574	But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.
512.57	We were led by our fears.
516.038	And our fears led to a blind faith
520.591	in the orthodoxy of austerity.
523.756	Instead of reaching out to the common
527.559	or the collective wisdom in our societies,
530.939	investing in it to find more creative solutions,
534.251	we reverted to political posturing.
536.811	And then we were surprised when every
538.417	ad hoc new measure didn't bring an end to the crisis,
541.715	and of course that made it very easy
544.644	to look for a whipping boy
546.491	for our collective European failure,
548.289	and of course that was Greece.
551.643	Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,
556.815	they are the problem. Punish them!
559.88	Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype
563.09	that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.
567.823	But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.
571.135	This could be the pattern
574.087	that leaders follow again and again
576.593	when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,
580.255	whether it's climate change, whether it's migration,
583.975	whether it's the financial system.
587.039	That is, abandoning our collective power
589.625	to imagine our potential,
591.504	falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,
595.683	taking our citizens out of the process
597.943	rather than building the process around our citizens.
602.115	And doing so will only test the faith
604.587	of our citizens, of our peoples, even more
606.995	in the democratic process.
609.557	It's no wonder that many political leaders,
611.255	and I don't exclude myself,
613.773	have lost the trust of our people.
616.851	When riot police have to protect parliaments,
620.414	a scene which is increasingly common around the world,
624.611	then there's something deeply wrong with our democracies.
629.361	That's why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people
633.266	own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.
637.502	My European counterparts, some of them, at least,
639.405	"said, ""You can't do this."
641.39	"There will be havoc in the markets again."""
645.938	"I said, ""We need to, before we restore confidence in the markets,"
650.194	"we need to restore confidence and trust amongst our people."""
655.782	Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.
658.55	We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,
663.67	but we remain challenged.
666.243	If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,
669.702	well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,
673.846	and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination
676.816	if not a lack of compassion.
679.282	So far, we've thrown economics at the problem,
681.823	actually mostly austerity,
684.134	and certainly we could have designed alternatives,
687.364	a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,
690.686	or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would
694.138	support countries in need from market pressures,
697.262	these would have been much more viable alternatives.
700.134	Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much
702.8	one of economics as it is one of democracy.
706.759	So let's try something else.
708.347	Let's see how we can bring people back to the process.
711.243	Let's throw democracy at the problem.
714.346	Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,
717.331	believed in the wisdom of the crowd
720.375	at their best moments. In people we trust.
723.266	Democracy could not work without the citizens
726.609	deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities
730.982	for public affairs.
732.916	Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries
735.65	to decide on critical matters of the day.
739.877	Science, theater, research, philosophy,
742.954	games of the mind and the body,
745.037	they were daily exercises.
746.765	Actually they were an education for participation,
750.917	for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.
754.457	And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.
758.993	You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,
762.237	that term originated there.
764.508	"""Idiot"" comes from the root ""idio,"" oneself."
769.301	A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,
772.544	someone who doesn't participate or even examine public affairs.
777.259	And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,
780.991	both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.
787.368	You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,
791.424	accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.
794.63	They serve the demos, democracy.
799.593	Above government, above markets
802.217	was the direct rule of the people.
804.746	Today we have globalized the markets
807.73	but we have not globalized our democratic institutions.
812.193	So our politicians are limited to local politics,
816.626	while our citizens, even though they see a great potential,
820.386	are prey to forces beyond their control.
824.866	So how then do we reunite the two halves of the agora?
827.697	How do we democratize globalization?
829.937	And I'm not talking about the necessary reforms
832.506	of the United Nations or the G20.
835.16	I'm talking about, how do we secure the space,
837.641	the demos, the platform of values,
840.142	so that we can tap into all of your potential?
845.702	Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.
849.577	Europe, despite its recent failures,
851.977	is the world's most successful cross-border peace experiment.
856.545	So let's see if it can't be an experiment
859.792	in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.
863.972	Let's see if we can't design a European agora,
867.082	not simply for products and services,
869.614	but for our citizens, where they can work together,
872.857	deliberate, learn from each other,
874.62	exchange between art and cultures,
877.836	where they can come up with creative solutions.
881.535	Let's imagine that European citizens
884.705	actually have the power to vote directly
886.999	for a European president,
889.999	or citizen juries chosen by lottery
893.483	which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,
897.709	a European-wide referendum where our citizens,
900.877	as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.
905.279	And here's an idea:
907.759	Why not have the first truly European citizens
910.683	by giving our immigrants,
912.703	not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,
916.815	but a European citizenship?
920.438	And make sure we actually empower
923.325	the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship
926.104	where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.
929.573	Where our common identity is democracy,
934.054	where our education is through participation,
939.018	and where participation builds trust
942.491	and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.
946.462	Europe of and by the people,
948.124	a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening
952.222	democracy beyond borders.
955.238	Now, some might accuse me of being naive,
959.076	putting my faith in the power and the wisdom of the people.
963.947	Well, after decades in politics, I am also a pragmatist.
968.716	Believe me, I have been,
971.272	I am, part of today's political system,
974.932	and I know things must change.
979.569	We must revive politics as the power to imagine,
983.857	reimagine, and redesign for a better world.
989.08	But I also know that this disruptive force of change
991.894	won't be driven by the politics of today.
994.958	The revival of democratic politics
997.254	will come from you, and I mean all of you.
1001.674	Everyone who participates in this global exchange of ideas,
1005.66	whether it's here in this room
1006.709	or just outside this room
1008.922	or online or locally, where everybody lives,
1012.756	everyone who stands up to injustice and inequality,
1016.076	everybody who stands up to those who preach
1018.796	racism rather than empathy,
1021.06	dogma rather than critical thinking,
1023.876	technocracy rather than democracy,
1026.192	everyone who stands up to the unchecked power,
1029.167	whether it's authoritarian leaders,
1031.288	plutocrats hiding their assets in tax havens,
1034.724	or powerful lobbies protecting the powerful few.
1038.644	It is in their interest that all of us are idiots.
1044.077	Let's not be.
1045.563	Thank you.
1046.803	(Applause)
1058.713	Bruno Giussani: You seem to describe a political leadership
1060.626	that is kind of unprepared
1062.811	and a prisoner of the whims of the financial markets,
1065.593	and that scene in Brussels that you describe, to me,
1067.953	as a citizen, is terrifying.
1070.456	Help us understand how you felt after the decision.
1074.755	It was not a good decision, clearly,
1076.323	but how do you feel after that, not as the prime minister,
1078.907	but as George?
1081.096	George Papandreou: Well, obviously there were constraints
1083.638	which didn't allow me or others to make
1087.564	the types of decisions we would have wanted,
1089.004	and obviously I had hoped that we would have the time
1091.769	to make the reforms which would have dealt
1093.476	with the deficit rather than trying to cut the deficit
1095.969	which was the symptom of the problem.
1097.684	And that hurt. That hurt because that, first of all,
1099.883	hurt the younger generation, and not only,
1103.387	many of them are demonstrating outside,
1105.324	but I think this is one of our problems.
1106.948	When we face these crises, we have kept the potential,
1112.18	the huge potential of our society out of this process,
1115.315	and we are closing in on ourselves in politics,
1118.139	and I think we need to change that, to really find
1120.885	new participatory ways using the great capabilities
1125.058	that now exist even in technology but not only in technology,
1128.208	the minds that we have, and I think we can find solutions
1131.349	which are much better, but we have to be open.
1133.156	BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward
1134.816	is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse
1138.427	right now in most European countries.
1140.15	It's rather the other way -- more closed borders
1143.877	and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out
1146.307	of some of the different parts of the European construction.
1150.012	How do you reconcile that?
1151.951	GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened
1154.38	during this crisis is that we started a blame game.
1156.612	And the fundamental idea of Europe is that
1160.17	we can cooperate beyond borders,
1162.276	go beyond our conflicts and work together.
1164.577	And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,
1170.546	we have less the potential to convince our citizens
1173.726	that we should work together,
1175.437	while now is the time when we really need
1177.51	to bring our powers together.
1179.278	Now, more Europe for me is not simply
1182.232	giving more power to Brussels.
1183.687	It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,
1187.56	that is, really making Europe a project of the people.
1191.408	So that, I think, would be a way to answer
1193.976	some of the fears that we have in our society.
1196.849	BG: George, thank you for coming to TED.
1198.372	GP: Thank you very much.BG: Thank you.(Applause)
