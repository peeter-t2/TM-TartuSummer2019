13.043	What an intriguing
13.043	group of individuals you are ...
17.505	to a psychologist.
18.977	(Laughter)
20.44	I've had the opportunity
20.44	over the last couple of days
23.57	of listening in on some
23.57	of your conversations
26.984	and watching you interact with each other.
29.174	And I think it's fair to say, already,
31.723	that there are 47 people in this audience,
37.494	at this moment,
39.414	displaying psychological symptoms
39.414	I would like to discuss today.
43.571	(Laughter)
44.942	And I thought you might
44.942	like to know who you are.
47.968	(Laughter)
49.415	But instead of pointing at you,
51.126	which would be gratuitous and intrusive,
54.865	I thought I would tell you
54.865	a few facts and stories,
57.89	in which you may catch
57.89	a glimpse of yourself.
62.089	I'm in the field of research
62.089	known as personality psychology,
66.349	which is part of a larger
66.349	personality science
69.813	which spans the full spectrum,
69.813	from neurons to narratives.
75.337	And what we try to do,
77.601	in our own way,
79.188	is to make sense of how each of us --
82.793	each of you --
84.467	is, in certain respects,
86.569	like all other people,
88.993	like some other people
91.243	and like no other person.
94.579	Now, already you may
94.579	be saying of yourself,
97.77	"""I'm not intriguing."
101.597	I am the 46th most boring person
101.597	"in the Western Hemisphere."""
107.895	Or you may say of yourself,
110.208	"""I am intriguing,"
113.252	even if I am regarded by most people
113.252	"as a great, thundering twit."""
117.227	(Laughter)
118.441	But it is your self-diagnosed boringness
118.441	"and your inherent ""twitiness"""
124.325	that makes me, as a psychologist,
124.325	really fascinated by you.
129.172	So let me explain why this is so.
132.284	One of the most influential approaches
132.284	in personality science
136.469	is known as trait psychology,
138.083	and it aligns you along five dimensions
138.083	which are normally distributed,
143.476	and that describe universally held aspects
143.476	of difference between people.
151.379	They spell out the acronym OCEAN.
154.105	"So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"""
157.18	versus those who are more closed.
159.555	"""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"""
162.754	in contrast to those with a more
162.754	lackadaisical approach to life.
166.422	"""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast"
166.422	to more introverted people.
171.089	"""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"""
173.805	in contrast to those
173.805	decidedly not agreeable.
177.599	"And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"""
180.267	in contrast to those who are more stable.
184.268	All of these dimensions have
184.268	implications for our well-being,
187.682	for how our life goes.
190.762	And so we know that, for example,
193.135	openness and conscientiousness
193.135	are very good predictors of life success,
198.829	but the open people achieve that success
198.829	through being audacious
203.23	and, occasionally, odd.
206.077	The conscientious people
206.077	achieve it through sticking to deadlines,
210.466	to persevering, as well as
210.466	having some passion.
215.662	Extroversion and agreeableness
215.662	are both conducive
219.572	to working well with people.
222.866	Extroverts, for example,
222.866	I find intriguing.
225.878	With my classes, I sometimes
225.878	give them a basic fact
228.885	that might be revealing
228.885	with respect to their personality:
232.356	I tell them that it is virtually
232.356	impossible for adults
237.426	to lick the outside of their own elbow.
241.287	(Laughter)
242.565	Did you know that?
245.505	Already, some of you have tried
245.505	to lick the outside of your own elbow.
249.718	But extroverts amongst you
251.518	are probably those
251.518	who have not only tried,
254.153	but they have successfully
254.153	licked the elbow
256.667	of the person sitting next to them.
258.382	(Laughter)
259.408	Those are the extroverts.
261.117	Let me deal in a bit more detail
261.117	with extroversion,
264.56	because it's consequential
264.56	and it's intriguing,
267.543	and it helps us understand
267.543	what I call our three natures.
271.048	First, our biogenic nature --
271.048	our neurophysiology.
274.743	Second, our sociogenic or second nature,
278.279	which has to do with the cultural
278.279	and social aspects of our lives.
282.744	And third, what makes you
282.744	individually you -- idiosyncratic --
290.19	"what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature."
293.26	Let me explain.
296.901	One of the things that characterizes
296.901	extroverts is they need stimulation.
300.971	And that stimulation can be achieved
300.971	by finding things that are exciting:
305.719	loud noises, parties
305.719	and social events here at TED --
309.78	you see the extroverts
309.78	forming a magnetic core.
313.031	They all gather together.
314.714	And I've seen you.
316.153	The introverts are more likely
316.153	to spend time in the quiet spaces
319.5	up on the second floor,
321.347	where they are able
321.347	to reduce stimulation --
325.163	and may be misconstrued
325.163	as being antisocial,
329.122	but you're not necessarily antisocial.
333.31	It may be that you simply realize
333.31	that you do better
337.436	when you have a chance
337.436	to lower that level of stimulation.
342.998	Sometimes it's an internal
342.998	stimulant, from your body.
347.17	Caffeine, for example, works much better
347.17	with extroverts than it does introverts.
352.109	When extroverts come into the office
352.109	at nine o'clock in the morning
355.312	"and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"""
358.221	they're not kidding --
359.396	they really do.
361.531	Introverts do not do as well,
363.361	particularly if the tasks
363.361	they're engaged in --
366.913	and they've had some coffee --
368.482	if those tasks are speeded,
370.644	and if they're quantitative,
372.547	introverts may give the appearance
372.547	of not being particularly quantitative.
377.58	But it's a misconstrual.
379.244	So here are the consequences
379.244	that are really quite intriguing:
382.312	we're not always what seem to be,
384.419	and that takes me to my next point.
388.196	I should say, before getting to this,
390.776	something about sexual intercourse,
393.48	although I may not have time.
395.605	And so, if you would like me to --
398.501	yes, you would?
399.676	OK.
400.851	(Laughter)
401.96	There are studies done
403.144	on the frequency with which
403.144	individuals engage in the conjugal act,
409.406	as broken down by male, female;
409.406	introvert, extrovert.
413.1	So I ask you:
414.275	How many times per minute --
417.162	oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study --
419.07	(Laughter)
422.151	How many times per month
426.715	do introverted men engage in the act?
430.486	3.0.
431.9	Extroverted men?
433.556	More or less?
435.616	Yes, more.
437.607	5.5 -- almost twice as much.
441.264	Introverted women: 3.1.
443.856	Extroverted women?
445.476	Frankly, speaking as an introverted male,
448.846	which I will explain later --
450.607	they are heroic.
452.973	7.5.
455.782	They not only handle
455.782	all the male extroverts,
458.158	they pick up a few introverts as well.
460.275	(Laughter)
462.195	(Applause)
468.796	We communicate differently,
468.796	extroverts and introverts.
474.576	Extroverts, when they interact,
476.106	want to have lots of social encounter
476.106	punctuated by closeness.
480.595	They'd like to stand close
480.595	for comfortable communication.
484.547	They like to have a lot of eye contact,
486.77	or mutual gaze.
489.241	We found in some research
490.472	that they use more diminutive terms
490.472	when they meet somebody.
493.873	So when an extrovert meets a Charles,
496.61	"it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,"""
496.61	"and then ""Chuck,"""
499.519	"and then ""Chuckles Baby."""
501.222	(Laughter)
503.032	Whereas for introverts,
504.461	"it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given"
504.461	a pass to be more intimate
509.39	by the person he's talking to.
512.044	We speak differently.
516.934	Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
516.934	concrete, simple language.
523.854	Introverts prefer --
523.854	and I must again tell you
527.672	that I am as extreme an introvert
527.672	as you could possibly imagine --
532.853	we speak differently.
534.594	We prefer contextually complex,
538.613	contingent,
540.569	weasel-word sentences --
542.609	(Laughter)
543.656	More or less.
545.385	(Laughter)
546.845	As it were.
548.069	(Laughter)
549.108	Not to put too fine a point upon it --
551.848	like that.
553.955	When we talk,
555.381	we sometimes talk past each other.
557.724	I had a consulting contract
557.724	I shared with a colleague
560.376	who's as different from me
560.376	as two people can possibly be.
563.739	First, his name is Tom.
566.499	Mine isn't.
567.737	(Laughter)
569.032	Secondly, he's six foot five.
570.987	I have a tendency not to be.
572.963	(Laughter)
574.03	And thirdly, he's as extroverted
574.03	a person as you could find.
577.777	I am seriously introverted.
580.67	I overload so much,
582.389	I can't even have a cup of coffee
582.389	after three in the afternoon
587.227	and expect to sleep in the evening.
590.178	We had seconded to this project
590.178	a fellow called Michael.
595.32	And Michael almost brought
595.32	the project to a crashing halt.
600.528	So the person who seconded him
600.528	asked Tom and me,
605.244	"""What do you make of Michael?"""
606.727	Well, I'll tell you
606.727	what Tom said in a minute.
609.021	"He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."""
611.955	And here is how extroverted ears
611.955	heard what I said,
615.554	which is actually pretty accurate.
617.531	"I said, ""Well Michael does have"
617.531	a tendency at times
622.385	of behaving in a way
622.385	that some of us might see
626.489	as perhaps more assertive
626.489	"than is normally called for."""
630.941	(Laughter)
633.611	Tom rolled his eyes and he said,
635.412	"""Brian, that's what I said:"
638.629	"he's an asshole!"""
640.053	(Laughter)
642.254	(Applause)
645.509	Now, as an introvert,
646.8	I might gently allude to certain
646.8	"""assholic"" qualities"
652.005	in this man's behavior,
653.324	but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.
656.152	(Laughter)
659.228	But the extrovert says,
660.518	"""If he walks like one, if he talks"
660.518	"like one, I call him one."""
663.416	And we go past each other.
665.498	Now is this something
665.498	that we should be heedful of?
669.488	Of course.
670.678	It's important that we know this.
672.286	Is that all we are?
674.67	Are we just a bunch of traits?
677.563	No, we're not.
680.116	Remember, you're like some other people
683.266	and like no other person.
685.487	How about that idiosyncratic you?
688.485	As Elizabeth or as George,
691.76	you may share your extroversion
691.76	or your neuroticism.
696.251	But are there some distinctively
696.251	Elizabethan features of your behavior,
700.282	or Georgian of yours,
703.732	that make us understand you
703.732	better than just a bunch of traits?
708.24	That make us love you?
711.461	Not just because you're
711.461	a certain type of person.
715.188	I'm uncomfortable putting
715.188	people in pigeonholes.
719.081	I don't even think pigeons
719.081	belong in pigeonholes.
723.235	So what is it that makes us different?
726.004	It's the doings that we have
726.004	in our life -- the personal projects.
731.403	You have a personal project right now,
733.248	but nobody may know it here.
737.504	It relates to your kid --
739.336	you've been back three times
739.336	to the hospital,
741.56	and they still don't know what's wrong.
745.373	Or it could be your mom.
748.092	And you'd been acting out of character.
750.218	These are free traits.
753.521	You're very agreeable,
753.521	but you act disagreeably
756.625	in order to break down those barriers
756.625	of administrative torpor
760.522	in the hospital,
761.697	to get something
761.697	for your mom or your child.
765.814	What are these free traits?
767.345	They're where we enact a script
769.939	in order to advance
769.939	a core project in our lives.
773.744	And they are what matters.
775.826	Don't ask people what type you are;
778.742	"ask them, ""What are your core"
778.742	"projects in your life?"""
781.52	And we enact those free traits.
783.328	I'm an introvert,
784.667	but I have a core project,
784.667	which is to profess.
789.64	I'm a professor.
791.798	And I adore my students,
795.08	and I adore my field.
796.691	And I can't wait to tell them
796.691	about what's new, what's exciting,
803.366	what I can't wait to tell them about.
805.642	And so I act in an extroverted way,
807.486	because at eight in the morning,
809.038	the students need a little bit of humor,
811.406	a little bit of engagement
811.406	to keep them going
814.152	in arduous days of study.
816.277	But we need to be very careful
818.456	when we act protractedly out of character.
822.679	Sometimes we may find
822.679	that we don't take care of ourselves.
829.309	I find, for example, after a period
829.309	of pseudo-extroverted behavior,
833.947	I need to repair somewhere on my own.
837.916	"As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book,"
841.059	in a chapter that featured
841.059	the strange Canadian professor
844.055	who was teaching at the time at Harvard,
847.145	I sometimes go to the men's room
848.829	to escape the slings and arrows
848.829	of outrageous extroverts.
853.069	(Laughter)
854.177	I remember one particular day
854.177	when I was retired to a cubicle,
860.573	trying to avoid overstimulation.
863.117	And a real extrovert came
863.117	in beside me -- not right in my cubicle,
868.388	but in the next cubicle over --
870.367	and I could hear various
870.367	evacuatory noises,
872.714	which we hate -- even our own,
875.007	that's why we flush
875.007	during as well as after.
877.761	(Laughter)
880.36	And then I heard
880.36	this gravelly voice saying,
884.974	"""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"""
887.433	(Laughter)
890.664	If anything is guaranteed
890.664	to constipate an introvert for six months,
897.055	it's talking on the john.
898.84	(Laughter)
900.094	That's where I'm going now.
902.696	Don't follow me.
904.564	Thank you.
905.767	(Applause)
