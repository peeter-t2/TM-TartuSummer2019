12.751	Chis Anderson: Christiane,
12.751	great to have you here.
15.112	So you've had this amazing viewpoint,
16.979	and perhaps it's fair to say
16.979	that in the last few years,
20.063	there have been some alarming
20.063	developments that you're seeing.
23.84	What's alarmed you most?
25.428	Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listening
25.428	to the earlier speakers,
28.644	I can frame it
28.644	in what they've been saying:
31.14	climate change, for instance --
31.14	cities, the threat to our environment
34.586	and our lives.
36.26	It basically also boils down to
36.26	understanding the truth
40.178	and to be able to get to the truth
40.178	of what we're talking about
43.213	in order to really be able to solve it.
45.329	So if 99.9 percent
45.329	of the science on climate
49.28	is empirical, scientific evidence,
52.361	but it's competing almost equally
52.361	with a handful of deniers,
57.28	that is not the truth;
58.531	that is the epitome of fake news.
61.053	And so for me, the last few years --
61.053	certainly this last year --
66.179	has crystallized the notion of fake news
66.179	in a way that's truly alarming
70.463	and not just some slogan
70.463	to be thrown around.
73.146	Because when you can't distinguish
73.146	between the truth and fake news,
76.981	you have a very much more
76.981	difficult time trying to solve
80.896	some of the great issues that we face.
84.332	CA: Well, you've been involved
84.332	in this question of,
87.777	what is balance, what is truth,
87.777	what is impartiality,
90.713	for a long time.
91.992	You were on the front lines
91.992	reporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago.
97.886	And back then, you famously said,
101.322	by calling out human right abuses,
103.967	"you said, ""Look, there are some situations"
103.967	one simply cannot be neutral about,
108.32	because when you're neutral,
109.724	"you are an accomplice."""
113.063	So, do you feel that today's journalists
113.063	aren't heeding that advice
117.984	about balance?
119.48	CA: Well, look, I think for journalists,
119.48	objectivity is the golden rule.
123.61	But I think sometimes we don't understand
123.61	what objectivity means.
128.05	And I actually learned this very,
128.05	very young in my career,
131.068	which was during the Balkan Wars.
132.664	I was young then.
133.904	It was about 25 years ago.
136.467	And what we faced was the wholesale
136.467	violation, not just of human rights,
142.272	but all the way to ethnic
142.272	cleansing and genocide,
145.275	and that has been adjudicated
145.275	in the highest war crimes court
149.305	in the world.
150.493	So, we know what we were seeing.
152.17	Trying to tell the world
152.17	what we were seeing
154.731	brought us accusations of bias,
157.53	of siding with one side,
159.443	of not seeing the whole side,
161.329	and just, you know,
161.329	trying to tell one story.
163.65	I particularly and personally
163.65	was accused of siding with,
167.981	for instance, the citizens of Sarajevo --
169.987	"""siding with the Muslims,"""
171.438	because they were the minority
171.438	who were being attacked
174.514	by Christians on the Serb side
178.276	in this area.
180.019	And it worried me.
181.385	It worried me that I was being
181.385	accused of this.
183.6	I thought maybe I was wrong,
184.966	maybe I'd forgotten what objectivity was.
187.338	But then I started to understand
187.338	that what people wanted
190.369	was actually not to do anything --
192.191	not to step in,
193.632	not to change the situation,
195.226	not to find a solution.
196.699	And so, their fake news at that time,
199.076	their lie at that time --
200.482	including our government's,
200.482	our democratically elected government's,
204.036	with values and principles
204.036	of human rights --
206.332	their lie was to say
206.332	that all sides are equally guilty,
209.863	that this has been centuries
209.863	of ethnic hatred,
212.68	whereas we knew that wasn't true,
214.586	that one side had decided to kill,
214.586	slaughter and ethnically cleanse
218.257	another side.
219.438	So that is where, for me,
220.958	I understood that objectivity means
220.958	giving all sides an equal hearing
226.288	and talking to all sides,
228.417	but not treating all sides equally,
232.063	not creating a forced moral equivalence
232.063	or a factual equivalence.
236.875	And when you come up against
236.875	that crisis point
241.378	in situations of grave violations
241.378	of international and humanitarian law,
247.073	if you don't understand
247.073	what you're seeing,
249.439	if you don't understand the truth
251.623	and if you get trapped
251.623	in the fake news paradigm,
255.16	then you are an accomplice.
257.478	And I refuse to be
257.478	an accomplice to genocide.
260.499	(Applause)
266.222	CH: So there have always been
266.222	these propaganda battles,
269.024	and you were courageous in taking
269.024	the stand you took back then.
273.472	Today, there's a whole new way, though,
277.223	in which news seems to be becoming fake.
279.451	How would you characterize that?
281.109	CA: Well, look -- I am really alarmed.
283.217	And everywhere I look,
285.443	you know, we're buffeted by it.
287.304	Obviously, when the leader
287.304	of the free world,
289.53	when the most powerful person
289.53	in the entire world,
292.027	which is the president
292.027	of the United States --
294.297	this is the most important, most powerful
294.297	country in the whole world,
299.14	economically, militarily, politically
299.14	in every which way --
304.235	and it seeks to, obviously, promote
304.235	its values and power around the world.
309.276	So we journalists,
309.276	who only seek the truth --
313.276	I mean, that is our mission --
314.821	we go around the world
314.821	looking for the truth
316.962	in order to be everybody's eyes and ears,
318.959	people who can't go out
318.959	in various parts of the world
321.502	to figure out what's going on
321.502	about things that are vitally important
324.895	to everybody's health and security.
326.875	So when you have a major world leader
326.875	accusing you of fake news,
333.585	it has an exponential ripple effect.
337.452	And what it does is,
337.452	it starts to chip away
342.292	at not just our credibility,
345.204	but at people's minds --
348.192	people who look at us,
348.192	and maybe they're thinking,
350.58	"""Well, if the president"
350.58	of the United States says that,
353.273	"maybe somewhere there's a truth in there."""
355.968	CH: Presidents have always
355.968	been critical of the media --
360.176	CA: Not in this way.
361.801	CH: So, to what extent --
363.33	(Laughter)
364.418	(Applause)
367.562	CH: I mean, someone a couple years ago
367.562	looking at the avalanche of information
374.482	pouring through Twitter
374.482	and Facebook and so forth,
377.742	might have said,
378.924	"""Look, our democracies are healthier"
378.924	than they've ever been.
381.789	There's more news than ever.
383.334	Of course presidents
383.334	will say what they'll say,
385.569	but everyone else can say
385.569	what they will say.
387.826	What's not to like?
387.826	"How is there an extra danger?"""
392.005	CA: So, I wish that was true.
394.812	I wish that the proliferation of platforms
394.812	upon which we get our information
400.929	meant that there was a proliferation
400.929	of truth and transparency
404.831	and depth and accuracy.
406.723	But I think the opposite has happened.
409.202	You know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite,
411.316	I will confess.
412.967	Even when we started to talk about
412.967	the information superhighway,
416.375	which was a long time ago,
418.027	before social media, Twitter
418.027	and all the rest of it,
420.702	I was actually really afraid
422.55	that that would put people
422.55	into certain lanes and tunnels
426.595	and have them just focusing
426.595	on areas of their own interest
430.961	instead of seeing the broad picture.
433.318	And I'm afraid to say
433.318	that with algorithms, with logarithms,
437.928	"with whatever the ""-ithms"" are"
439.6	that direct us into all these particular
439.6	channels of information,
443.89	that seems to be happening right now.
445.784	I mean, people have written
445.784	about this phenomenon.
448.352	People have said that yes,
448.352	the internet came,
450.574	its promise was to exponentially explode
450.574	our access to more democracy,
456.341	more information,
458.079	less bias,
459.995	more varied information.
462.408	And, in fact, the opposite has happened.
464.757	And so that, for me,
464.757	is incredibly dangerous.
468.799	And again, when you are the president
468.799	of this country and you say things,
473.338	it also gives leaders in other
473.338	undemocratic countries the cover
479.829	to affront us even worse,
482.159	and to really whack us --
482.159	and their own journalists --
485.043	with this bludgeon of fake news.
487.82	CH: To what extent
487.82	is what happened, though,
490.028	in part, just an unintended consequence,
492.118	that the traditional
492.118	media that you worked in
494.944	had this curation-mediation role,
497.048	where certain norms were observed,
499.098	certain stories would be rejected
499.098	because they weren't credible,
502.275	but now that the standard
502.275	for publication and for amplification
508.798	is just interest, attention,
508.798	excitement, click,
512.15	"""Did it get clicked on?"""
513.337	"""Send it out there!"""
514.516	and that's what's --
514.516	is that part of what's caused the problem?
518.044	CA: I think it's a big problem,
518.044	and we saw this in the election of 2016,
521.663	"where the idea of ""clickbait"""
521.663	was very sexy and very attractive,
526.794	and so all these fake news sites
526.794	and fake news items
531.124	were not just haphazardly
531.124	and by happenstance being put out there,
535.27	there's been a whole industry
535.27	in the creation of fake news
539.745	in parts of Eastern Europe, wherever,
542.759	and you know, it's planted
542.759	in real space and in cyberspace.
546.043	So I think that, also,
548.426	the ability of our technology
548.426	to proliferate this stuff
553.571	at the speed of sound
553.571	or light, just about --
557.106	we've never faced that before.
559.113	And we've never faced
559.113	such a massive amount of information
564.004	which is not curated
565.593	by those whose profession
565.593	leads them to abide by the truth,
570.913	to fact-check
572.139	and to maintain a code of conduct
572.139	and a code of professional ethics.
576.997	CH: Many people here may know
576.997	people who work at Facebook
580.364	or Twitter and Google and so on.
582.712	They all seem like great people
582.712	with good intention --
585.868	let's assume that.
587.272	If you could speak with the leaders
587.272	of those companies,
590.971	what would you say to them?
592.286	CA: Well, you know what --
594.079	I'm sure they are
594.079	incredibly well-intentioned,
596.447	and they certainly developed
596.447	an unbelievable, game-changing system,
601.689	where everybody's connected
601.689	on this thing called Facebook.
604.924	And they've created a massive
604.924	economy for themselves
608.749	and an amazing amount of income.
611.453	I would just say,
612.657	"""Guys, you know, it's time"
612.657	to wake up and smell the coffee
616.915	and look at what's happening
616.915	"to us right now."""
619.641	Mark Zuckerberg wants to create
619.641	a global community.
622.597	I want to know: What is that global
622.597	community going to look like?
625.84	I want to know where the codes
625.84	of conduct actually are.
629.931	Mark Zuckerberg said --
631.78	and I don't blame him,
631.78	he probably believed this --
634.522	that it was crazy to think
636.902	that the Russians or anybody else
636.902	could be tinkering and messing around
641.035	with this avenue.
642.302	And what have we just learned
642.302	in the last few weeks?
644.808	That, actually, there has been
644.808	a major problem in that regard,
647.79	and now they're having to investigate it
647.79	and figure it out.
650.932	Yes, they're trying to do
650.932	what they can now
654.235	to prevent the rise of fake news,
656.417	but, you know,
657.824	it went pretty unrestricted
657.824	for a long, long time.
662.939	So I guess I would say, you know,
664.863	you guys are brilliant at technology;
666.986	let's figure out another algorithm.
668.901	Can we not?
670.096	CH: An algorithm that includes
670.096	journalistic investigation --
673.007	CA: I don't really know how they do it,
673.007	but somehow, you know --
676.387	filter out the crap!
678.23	(Laughter)
679.404	And not just the unintentional --
681.43	(Applause)
684.708	but the deliberate lies that are planted
686.938	by people who've been doing this
686.938	as a matter of warfare
691.287	for decades.
692.613	The Soviets, the Russians --
694.57	they are the masters of war
694.57	by other means, of hybrid warfare.
700.438	And this is a --
702.509	this is what they've decided to do.
705.517	It worked in the United States,
707.146	it didn't work in France,
708.491	it hasn't worked in Germany.
710.188	During the elections there,
710.188	where they've tried to interfere,
713.153	the president of France
713.153	right now, Emmanuel Macron,
715.779	took a very tough stand
715.779	and confronted it head on,
718.326	as did Angela Merkel.
719.508	CH: There's some hope to be had
719.508	from some of this, isn't there?
722.517	That the world learns.
723.692	We get fooled once,
725.034	maybe we get fooled again,
726.39	but maybe not the third time.
727.869	Is that true?
729.061	CA: I mean, let's hope.
730.241	But I think in this regard that so much
730.241	of it is also about technology,
733.652	that the technology has to also be given
733.652	some kind of moral compass.
737.121	I know I'm talking nonsense,
737.121	but you know what I mean.
739.961	CH: We need a filter-the-crap algorithm
739.961	with a moral compass --
743.693	CA: There you go.
744.874	CH: I think that's good.
746.05	"CA: No -- ""moral technology."""
747.745	We all have moral compasses --
747.745	moral technology.
750.875	CH: I think that's a great challenge.
750.875	CA: You know what I mean.
753.878	CH: Talk just a minute about leadership.
755.846	You've had a chance to speak
755.846	with so many people across the world.
759.006	I think for some of us --
760.269	I speak for myself,
760.269	I don't know if others feel this --
762.985	there's kind of been a disappointment of:
765.005	Where are the leaders?
766.888	So many of us have been disappointed --
769.226	Aung San Suu Kyi,
769.226	what's happened recently,
771.266	"it's like, ""No! Another one"
771.266	"bites the dust."""
773.375	You know, it's heartbreaking.
774.998	(Laughter)
776.257	Who have you met
778.302	who you have been
778.302	impressed by, inspired by?
781.196	CA: Well, you talk about
781.196	the world in crisis,
783.724	which is absolutely true,
785.102	and those of us who spend our whole lives
785.102	immersed in this crisis --
789.613	I mean, we're all on the verge
789.613	of a nervous breakdown.
792.63	So it's pretty stressful right now.
795.33	And you're right --
796.513	there is this perceived and actual
796.513	vacuum of leadership,
799.647	and it's not me saying it,
799.647	I ask all these --
802.521	whoever I'm talking to,
802.521	I ask about leadership.
804.998	I was speaking to the outgoing
804.998	president of Liberia today,
809.532	[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,]
811.366	who --
812.544	(Applause)
814.783	in three weeks' time,
816.349	will be one of the very rare
816.349	heads of an African country
820.317	who actually abides by the constitution
822.519	and gives up power
822.519	after her prescribed term.
826.155	She has said she wants
826.155	to do that as a lesson.
830.036	But when I asked her about leadership,
832.092	and I gave a quick-fire round
832.092	of certain names,
834.799	I presented her with the name
834.799	of the new French president,
837.8	Emmanuel Macron.
839.257	And she said --
840.617	"I said, ""So what do you think"
840.617	"when I say his name?"""
843.147	And she said,
845.398	"""Shaping up potentially to be"
847.747	a leader to fill our current
847.747	"leadership vacuum."""
851.837	I thought that was really interesting.
853.694	Yesterday, I happened to have
853.694	an interview with him.
856.174	I'm very proud to say,
857.356	I got his first international interview.
857.356	It was great. It was yesterday.
860.799	And I was really impressed.
862.115	I don't know whether I should be
862.115	saying that in an open forum,
865.067	but I was really impressed.
866.546	(Laughter)
868.687	And it could be just because
868.687	it was his first interview,
871.386	but -- I asked questions,
871.386	and you know what?
873.505	He answered them!
874.737	(Laughter)
876.694	(Applause)
879.987	There was no spin,
881.604	there was no wiggle and waggle,
884.019	there was no spend-five-minutes-
884.019	to-come-back-to-the-point.
886.872	I didn't have to keep interrupting,
888.564	which I've become rather
888.564	renowned for doing,
890.671	because I want people
890.671	to answer the question.
893.227	And he answered me,
895.302	and it was pretty interesting.
897.94	And he said --
899.395	CH: Tell me what he said.
901.197	CA: No, no, you go ahead.
902.441	CH: You're the interrupter,
902.441	I'm the listener.
904.693	CA: No, no, go ahead.
905.875	CH: What'd he say?
907.054	CA: OK. You've talked about
907.054	nationalism and tribalism here today.
910.156	"I asked him, ""How did you have the guts"
910.156	to confront the prevailing winds
913.942	of anti-globalization,
913.942	nationalism, populism
918.501	when you can see what happened in Brexit,
920.487	when you could see what happened
920.487	in the United States
923.066	and what might have happened
923.066	in many European elections
925.685	"at the beginning of 2017?"""
927.426	And he said,
929.417	"""For me, nationalism means war."
933.306	We have seen it before,
935.003	we have lived through it before
935.003	on my continent,
937.285	"and I am very clear about that."""
939.995	So he was not going to,
939.995	just for political expediency,
943.98	embrace the, kind of, lowest
943.98	common denominator
947.446	that had been embraced
947.446	in other political elections.
951.475	And he stood against Marine Le Pen,
951.475	who is a very dangerous woman.
956.748	CH: Last question for you, Christiane.
959.913	Tell us about ideas worth spreading.
961.935	If you could plant one idea
961.935	into the minds of everyone here,
966.606	what would that be?
967.827	CA: I would say really be careful
967.827	where you get your information from;
972.965	really take responsibility
972.965	for what you read, listen to and watch;
978.311	make sure that you go to the trusted
978.311	brands to get your main information,
983.222	no matter whether you have
983.222	a wide, eclectic intake,
987.935	really stick with the brand
987.935	names that you know,
990.954	because in this world right now,
990.954	at this moment right now,
994.57	our crises, our challenges,
994.57	our problems are so severe,
998.933	that unless we are all engaged
998.933	as global citizens
1002.508	who appreciate the truth,
1004.435	who understand science,
1004.435	empirical evidence and facts,
1008.804	then we are just simply
1008.804	going to be wandering along
1012.327	to a potential catastrophe.
1014.312	So I would say, the truth,
1015.7	and then I would come back
1015.7	to Emmanuel Macron
1017.98	and talk about love.
1019.842	I would say that there's not
1019.842	enough love going around.
1024.335	And I asked him to tell me about love.
1027.051	"I said, ""You know, your marriage"
1027.051	"is the subject of global obsession."""
1030.667	(Laughter)
1032.326	"""Can you tell me about love?"
1033.763	"What does it mean to you?"""
1035.101	I've never asked a president
1035.101	or an elected leader about love.
1038.066	I thought I'd try it.
1039.248	And he said -- you know,
1039.248	he actually answered it.
1043.187	"And he said, ""I love my wife,"
1043.187	she is part of me,
1047.372	"we've been together for decades."""
1049.023	But here's where it really counted,
1050.732	what really stuck with me.
1052.259	He said,
1053.524	"""It is so important for me"
1053.524	to have somebody at home
1057.068	"who tells me the truth."""
1060.438	So you see, I brought it home.
1060.438	It's all about the truth.
1063.174	(Laughter)
1064.204	CH: So there you go. Truth and love.
1064.204	Ideas worth spreading.
1067.035	Christiane Amanpour, thank you
1067.035	so much. That was great.
1069.722	(Applause)
1070.814	CA: Thank you.
1070.814	CH: That was really lovely.
1073.172	(Applause)
1074.411	CA: Thank you.
