15.926	One of my favorite words in the whole
15.926	of the Oxford English Dictionary
19.531	"is ""snollygoster,"""
21.398	just because it sounds so good.
23.068	And what snollygoster means
23.068	"is ""a dishonest politician."""
27.376	Although there was a 19th-century
27.376	newspaper editor
29.93	who defined it rather better when he said,
31.987	"""A snollygoster is a fellow"
31.987	who seeks office
34.527	regardless of party,
34.527	platform or principle,
38.134	and who, when he wins,
39.666	gets there by the sheer force
39.666	"of monumental talknophical assumnancy."""
44.914	(Laughter)
46.467	Now, I have no idea
46.467	"what ""talknophical"" is."
48.589	Something to do with words, I assume.
50.415	But it's very important that words
50.415	are at the center of politics,
53.714	and all politicians know
53.714	they have to try and control language.
56.943	It wasn't until, for example, 1771
59.995	that the British Parliament
59.995	allowed newspapers to report
64.442	the exact words that were said
64.442	in the debating chamber.
67.714	And this was actually
67.714	all down to the bravery
70.035	of a guy with the extraordinary
70.035	name of Brass Crosby,
73.368	who took on Parliament.
75.118	And he was thrown into the Tower of London
77.22	and imprisoned,
79.338	but he was brave enough,
82.171	he was brave enough
82.171	to take them on, and in the end,
84.674	he had such popular support
84.674	in London that he won.
87.133	And it was only a few years later
88.92	that we have the first recorded use
88.92	"of the phrase ""as bold as brass."""
94.321	Most people think
94.321	that's down to the metal.
96.369	It's not; it's down to a campaigner
96.369	for the freedom of the press.
100.811	But to really show you
100.811	how words and politics interact,
105.021	I want to take you back
105.021	to the United States of America,
107.665	just after they'd achieved independence.
110.469	And they had to face the question
112.241	of what to call
112.241	George Washington, their leader.
114.97	They didn't know.
116.25	What do you call the leader
116.25	of a republican country?
119.595	And this was debated
119.595	in Congress for ages and ages.
122.486	And there were all sorts
122.486	of suggestions on the table,
125.042	which might have made it.
126.261	I mean, some people
126.261	wanted him to be called
128.522	"""Chief Magistrate Washington,"""
130.336	and other people,
130.336	"""His Highness, George Washington,"""
132.849	and other people,
134.107	"""Protector of the Liberties"
136.889	of the People of the United States
136.889	"of America Washington."""
139.964	Not that catchy.
141.607	Some people just wanted
141.607	to call him king --
144.065	it was tried and tested.
145.595	They weren't even being monarchical,
147.349	they had the idea that you could
147.349	be elected king for a fixed term.
150.587	And, you know, it could have worked.
152.875	And everybody got insanely bored,
154.757	because this debate
154.757	went on for three weeks.
156.855	I read a diary of this poor senator
156.855	who just keeps coming back,
159.869	"""Still on this subject."""
161.141	And the reason for the delay
161.141	and the boredom
163.694	was that the House of Representatives
163.694	were against the Senate.
167.333	The House of Representatives didn't want
167.333	Washington to get drunk on power.
171.574	"They didn't want to call him ""king,"""
171.574	in case that gave him ideas,
174.685	or his successor ideas.
176.049	So they wanted to give him
176.049	the humblest, meagerest,
179.22	most pathetic title
179.22	that they could think of.
182.616	And that title ...
184.704	"was ""President."""
186.123	(Laughter)
188.211	"""President."" They didn't invent the title."
190.262	I mean, it existed before,
191.608	but it just meant somebody
191.608	who presides over a meeting.
194.297	It was like the foreman of the jury.
196.204	And it didn't have much more grandeur
198.064	"than the term ""foreman"" or ""overseer."""
199.942	There were occasional presidents
199.942	of little colonial councils
202.839	and bits of government,
204.035	but it was really a nothing title.
206.25	And that's why the Senate objected to it.
208.284	"They said, ""That's ridiculous!"
208.284	You can't call him 'President.'
212.057	This guy has to go and sign treaties
212.057	and meet foreign dignitaries.
215.5	Who's going to take him seriously
215.5	if he's got a silly little title
219.079	like 'President of the United
219.079	"States of America'?"""
221.744	(Laughter)
222.779	And after three weeks
222.779	of debate, in the end,
226.547	the Senate did not cave in.
230.626	Instead, they agreed to use
230.626	"the title ""President"" for now."
236.316	But they also wanted
236.316	it absolutely set down
239.124	that they didn't agree with it,
242.229	from a decent respect for the opinions
242.229	and practice of civilized nations,
247.702	whether under republican
247.702	or monarchical forms of government,
251.53	whose custom it is to annex,
253.668	through the office
253.668	of the Chief Magistrate,
255.708	titles of respectability --
258.512	"not bloody ""President."""
260.642	And that, in the intercourse
260.642	with foreign nations,
264.27	the majesty of the people
264.27	of the United States
267.541	may not be hazarded
267.541	by an appearance of singularity --
271.548	i.e., we don't want to look
271.548	like bloody weirdos.
275.745	Now, you can learn
275.745	three interesting things from this.
278.374	First of all -- and this is my favorite --
280.595	is that, so far as I've ever
280.595	been able to find out,
283.055	the Senate has never formally
283.055	endorsed the title of President.
288.351	Barack Obama, President Obama,
288.351	is there on borrowed time,
291.294	just waiting for the Senate
291.294	to spring into action.
294.458	(Laughter)
295.728	The second thing you can learn
297.204	is that, when a government says
297.204	that this is a temporary measure --
300.448	(Laughter)
302.84	you can still be waiting 223 years later.
308.114	But the third thing you can learn --
308.114	and this is the really important one,
311.654	the point I want to leave you on --
313.402	"is that the title, ""President"
313.402	"of the United States of America,"""
317.358	doesn't sound that humble
317.358	at all these days, does it?
321.504	Something to do
321.504	with the slightly over 5,000
324.727	nuclear warheads he has at his disposal
327.001	and the largest economy in the world
329.198	and a fleet of drones
329.198	and all that sort of stuff.
332.797	Reality and history
332.797	have endowed that title with grandeur.
339.751	And so the Senate won in the end.
341.393	They got their title of respectability.
343.845	And also, the Senate's other worry,
343.845	the appearance of singularity --
347.405	well, it was a singularity back then.
349.553	But now, do you know
349.553	how many nations have a president?
352.426	A hundred and forty-seven.
354.772	All because they want
354.772	to sound like the guy
356.807	who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
361.415	And so, in the end, the Senate won
364.318	and the House of Representatives lost ...
367.823	because nobody's going to feel that humble
370.363	when they're told that they are now
372.074	the President of the United
372.074	States of America.
376.503	And that's the important lesson
376.503	I think you can take away,
379.293	and the one I want to leave you with.
381.092	Politicians try to pick and use words
381.092	to shape and control reality,
384.91	but in fact,
386.592	reality changes words far more
386.592	than words can ever change reality.
392.502	Thank you very much.
