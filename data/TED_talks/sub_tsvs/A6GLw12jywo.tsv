26	A public, Dewey long ago observed,
29	is constituted through discussion and debate.
33	If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,
39	and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,
43	then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions
46	to debate and discussion.
50	It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion
55	of one of the critical issues of our time,
58	namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital
62	for the project of state building.
64	To put the assumptions very clearly:
67	capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,
72	and so has democracy.
74	If we looked in the world of 1945
78	and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,
83	they were the rare exception, not the norm.
88	The question now, however,
90	is both about which form of capitalism
95	and which type of democratic participation.
99	But we must acknowledge
101	that this moment has brought about
103	a rare consensus of assumptions.
106	And that provides the ground
109	for a type of action,
111	because consensus of each moment
113	allows us to act.
115	And it is necessary, no matter how fragile
118	or how provisional our consensus,
121	to be able to move forward.
123	But the majority of the world
126	neither benefits from capitalism
128	nor from democratic systems.
134	Most of the globe
136	experiences the state as repressive,
140	as an organization that is concerned
143	about denial of rights,
145	about denial of justice,
147	rather than provision of it.
151	And in terms of experience of capitalism,
154	there are two aspects
156	that the rest of the globe experiences.
158	First, extractive industry.
160	Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds,
163	timber,
166	that is cut right from under the poorest.
169	Second is technical assistance.
172	And technical assistance might shock you,
174	but it's the worst form
176	of -- today -- of the ugly face
179	of the developed world to the developing countries.
183	Tens of billions of dollars
185	are supposedly spent on building capacity
187	with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,
191	who are incapable
193	of thinking creatively,
195	or organically.
201	Next assumption --
203	and of course the events of July 7,
205	I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --
208	have reminded us
210	we do not live in three different worlds.
213	We live in one world.
217	But that's easily said.
220	But we are not dealing with the implications
223	of the one world that we are living in.
227	And that is that if we want to have one world,
230	this one world cannot be based
232	on huge pockets of exclusion,
235	and then inclusion for some.
237	We must now finally come
239	to think about the premises
241	of a truly global world,
243	in relationship to the regime of rights
245	and responsibilities and accountabilities
248	that are truly global in scope.
250	Otherwise we will be missing
253	this open moment in history,
255	where we have a consensus
257	on both the form of politics
259	and the form of economics.
262	What is one of these organizations to pick?
264	We have three critical terms:
266	economy,
268	civil society
270	and the state.
272	I will not deal with those first two, except to say
275	that uncritical transfer of assumptions,
278	from one context to another,
280	can only make for disaster.
283	Economics
286	taught in most of the elite universities
289	are practically useless in my context.
292	My country is dominated
294	by drug economy and a mafia.
297	Textbook economics does not work in my context,
299	and I have very few recommendations from anybody
302	as to how to put together a legal economy.
305	The poverty of our knowledge
307	must become the first basis
309	of moving forward,
311	and not imposition of the framework
314	that works on the basis of mathematical modeling,
317	for which I have enormous respect.
319	My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.
323	Second,
325	instead of debating endlessly
328	about what is the structure of the state,
330	why don't we simplify
332	and say, what are a series of functions
334	that the state in the 21st century must perform?
337	Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;
340	we hope to share that much widely with --
342	and third is that we could actually construct an index
345	to measure comparatively
348	how well these functions that we would agree on
351	are being performed in different places.
353	So what are these functions?
355	We propose 10.
357	And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,
360	administrative control, management of public finances,
363	investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,
366	provision of infrastructure,
368	management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state
371	through regulation, creation of the market,
373	international agreements, including public borrowing,
376	and then, most importantly, rule of law.
379	I won't elaborate.
381	I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
384	This is a feasible goal,
386	basically because, contrary to widespread assumption,
389	I would argue that we know how to do this.
392	Who would have imagined that Germany
394	would be either united or democratic today,
397	if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?
402	But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany
405	and engaged in planning.
408	And there are lots of other examples.
412	Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group --
416	we have to rethink the notion of capital.
419	The least important form of capital, in this project,
423	is financial capital -- money.
427	Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
430	It's just cash.
432	Because it lacks the institutional,
434	organizational, managerial forms
437	to turn it into capital.
440	And what is required
443	is a combination of physical capital,
445	institutional capital, human capital --
447	and security, of course, is critical,
450	but so is information.
452	Now, the issue that should concern us here --
455	and that's the challenge
457	that I would like to pose to this group --
461	is again, it takes 16 years
464	in your countries
467	to produce somebody with a B.S. degree.
470	It takes 20 years
472	to produce somebody with a Ph.D.
474	The first challenge is to rethink,
477	fundamentally,
480	the issue of the time.
483	Do we need to repeat
487	the modalities that we have inherited?
489	Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.
495	What is it that we need to do fundamentally
498	to re-engage in a project,
500	that capital formation is rapid?
503	The absolute majority of the world's population
506	are below 20,
508	and they are growing larger and faster.
512	They need different ways
514	of being approached,
516	different ways of being enfranchised,
519	different ways of being skilled.
521	And that's the first thing.
523	Second is, you're problem solvers,
526	but you're not engaging your global responsibility.
531	You've stayed away
533	from the problems of corruption.
535	You only want clean environments in which to function.
538	But if you don't think through the problems of corruption,
541	who will?
544	You stay away from design for development.
547	You're great designers,
550	but your designs are selfish.
553	It's for your own immediate use.
556	The world in which I operate
559	operates with designs
561	regarding roads, or dams,
563	or provision of electricity
565	that have not been revisited in 60 years.
569	This is not right. It requires thinking.
572	But, particularly, what we need
574	more than anything else from this group
576	is your imagination
578	to be brought to bear on problems
580	the way a meme is supposed to work.
584	As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed --
587	Thomas Kuhn's work --
589	it's in the intersection of ideas
591	that new developments --
593	true breakthroughs -- occur.
595	And I hope that this group
597	would be able to deal with the issue of state and development
600	and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,
602	through this means.
604	Thank you.
606	(Applause)
615	Chris Anderson: So, Ashraf, until recently,
618	you were the finance minister of Afghanistan,
620	a country right at the middle
622	of much of the world's agenda.
624	Is the country gonna make it?
626	Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?
630	Ashraf Ghani: What scares me most is -- is you,
633	lack of your engagement.
636	(Laughter)
640	You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.
643	No. But seriously,
645	the issue of Afghanistan
647	first has to be seen as,
649	at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.
653	Today the world of globalization
655	is on speed.
657	Time has been compressed.
659	And space does not exist for most people.
662	But in my world --
664	you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,
667	space had expanded.
669	Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
672	I rode -- traveled --
674	travel between two cities that used to take three hours
677	now took 12.
679	So the first is when the scale is that,
682	we need to recognize
684	that just the simple things that are infrastructure --
687	it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.
689	In our world.
691	Any meaningful sort of thing.
694	But the modality of attention,
697	or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.
700	Second is,
702	when a country has been subjected
705	to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power --
708	we had the Red Army
710	for 10 continuous years,
715	literally terrorizing.
718	The sky:
720	every Afghan
723	sees the sky as a source of fear.
727	We were bombed
729	practically out of existence.
734	Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --
739	from all sides.
741	The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,
743	Egyptian intelligence service
745	to train thousands of people
747	in resistance and urban terrorism.
751	How to turn a bicycle
753	into an instrument of terror.
756	How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.
759	And the Russians, equally.
761	So, when violence erupts
763	in a country like Afghanistan,
765	it's because of that legacy.
767	But we have to understand
769	that we've been incredibly lucky.
771	I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,
774	standing in front of you, speaking.
777	When I joined as finance minister,
781	I thought that the chances of my living more than three years
784	would not be more than five percent.
788	Those were the risks. They were worth it.
791	I think we can make it,
793	and the reason we can make it
795	is because of the people.
797	You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.
804	listen to at least three radio stations a day.
808	In terms of their discourse,
811	in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,
814	I think that I would dare say,
817	they're much more sophisticated
819	than rural Americans with college degrees
824	and the bulk of Europeans --
828	because the world matters to them.
831	And what is their predominant concern?
833	Abandonment.
835	Afghans have become deeply internationalist.
839	You know, when I went back in December of 2001,
841	I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
844	because I'd lived as a nationalist.
846	And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here --
849	separate.
851	Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.
854	I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.
856	And everybody was telling me it was a different world.
859	You know, they engage.
861	They see engagement, global engagement,
864	as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
867	And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --
870	Clare Lockhart is here,
872	so I'll recite a discussion she had
874	with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.
877	And that woman said she didn't care
879	whether she had food on her table.
881	What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,
884	where her children could really have a different life.
887	That gives me hope.
891	CA: How is Afghanistan
893	going to provide alternative income
895	to the many people
897	who are making their living off the drugs trade?
899	AG: Certainly. Well, the first is,
901	instead of sending a billion dollars
904	on drug eradication
906	and paying it to a couple of security companies,
909	they should give this hundred billion dollars
911	to 50
914	of the most critically innovative companies in the world
918	to ask them to create one million jobs.
921	The key to the drug eradication is jobs.
923	Look, there's a very little known fact:
925	countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars
928	don't produce drugs.
932	Second, textile.
935	Trade is the key, not aid.
938	The U.S. and Europe
940	should give us a zero percent tariff.
942	The textile industry is incredibly mobile.
945	If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,
948	we could probably attract
950	four to six billion dollars
952	quite easily in the textile sector,
954	if there was zero tariffs --
956	would create the type of job.
959	Cotton does not compete with opium;
962	a t-shirt does.
965	And we need to understand, it's the value chain.
968	Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired
971	of hearing about microcredit.
974	It is important,
976	but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want
979	is global access.
982	They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars
986	that are only for foreigners --
988	and the same bloody shirt
991	embroidered time and again.
993	What we want is a partnership
995	with the Italian design firms.
999	Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!
1003	Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?
1005	With the Put Out system?
1009	So I think economically,
1011	the critical issue really is to now think through.
1014	And what I will say here is that aid doesn't work.
1017	You know, the aid system is broken.
1020	The aid system does not have the knowledge,
1022	the vision, the ability.
1024	I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.
1027	Yeah, to be exact, you know,
1029	I managed to persuade the world that
1031	they had to give my country 27.5 billion.
1033	They didn't want to give us the money.
1035	CA: And it still didn't work?
1037	AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
1039	It's that a dollar of private investment,
1041	in my judgment,
1043	is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,
1046	in terms of the dynamic that it generates.
1049	Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;
1052	it could be 20 cents;
1054	or it could be four dollars.
1056	It depends on what form it comes,
1058	what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
1061	You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit
1064	entrepreneurs of the developed countries,
1066	not to generate growth in the poor countries.
1071	And this is, again, one of those assumptions --
1073	the way car seats are an assumption
1076	that we've inherited in governments, and doors.
1079	You would think that the US government
1081	would not think that American firms needed subsidizing
1084	to function in developing countries, provide advice,
1087	but they do.
1089	There's an entire weight of history
1091	vis-a-vis aid
1093	that now needs to be reexamined.
1095	If the goal is to build states
1098	that can credibly take care of themselves --
1101	and I'm putting that proposition equally;
1104	you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts --
1107	aid must end
1110	in each country in a definable period.
1113	And every year there must be progress
1116	on mobilization of domestic revenue
1119	and generation of the economy.
1122	Unless that kind of compact is entered into,
1125	you will not be able to sustain the consensus.
