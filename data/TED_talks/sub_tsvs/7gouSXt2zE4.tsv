16.418	This is the ocean as I used to know it.
19.085	And I find that since I've been
19.085	in the Gulf a couple of times,
23.322	I really kind of am traumatized
23.322	because whenever I look at the ocean now,
27.846	no matter where I am,
30.331	even where I know
30.331	that none of the oil has gone,
34.26	I sort of see slicks,
36.26	and I'm finding that I'm very much
36.26	haunted by it.
41.926	But what I want to talk to you about today
44.146	is a lot of things that try
44.146	to put all of this in context,
47.7	not just about the oil eruption,
47.7	but what it means and why it has happened.
53.698	First, just a little bit about me.
55.357	I'm basically just a guy
55.357	that likes to go fishing
57.893	ever since I was a little kid,
57.893	and because I did,
60.873	I wound up studying sea birds
62.964	to try to stay in the coastal habitats
62.964	that I so loved.
66.41	And now I mainly write books
66.41	about how the ocean is changing,
71.02	and the ocean is certainly
71.02	changing very rapidly.
73.944	Now we saw this graphic earlier on,
73.944	that we really live on a hard marble
79.781	that has just a slight bit
79.781	of wetness to it.
83.26	It's like you dipped a marble in water.
85.526	And the same thing with the atmosphere:
87.617	If you took all the atmosphere
87.617	and rolled it up in a ball,
90.866	you would get that little sphere
90.866	of gas on the right.
93.808	So we live on the most fragile
93.808	little soap bubble you can imagine,
99.061	a very sacred soap bubble,
99.061	but one that is very, very easy to affect.
103.848	And all the burning of oil and coal
103.848	and gas, all the fossil fuels,
108.719	have changed the atmosphere greatly.
110.912	Carbon dioxide level
110.912	has gone up and up and up.
113.857	We're warming the climate.
116.198	So the blowout in the Gulf
118.233	is just a little piece
118.233	of a much larger problem
122.402	that we have with the energy
122.402	that we use to run civilization.
126.5	Beyond warming,
127.955	we have the problem
127.955	of the oceans getting more acidified --
131.673	and already measurably so,
131.673	and already affecting animals.
136.46	Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam
136.46	and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,
142.912	which is the normal pH
142.912	of seawater, but 7.5,
146.663	it dissolves in about three days.
149.293	If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,
153.112	put it in a pH of 7.7 --
153.112	not a huge change --
157.428	it becomes deformed and dies.
160.105	Already, commercial oyster larvae
160.105	are dying at large scales in some places.
167.507	Coral reefs are growing slower
167.507	in some places because of this problem.
171.866	So this really matters.
173.502	Now, let's take a little tour
173.502	around the Gulf a little bit.
177.883	One of the things that really impresses me
177.883	about the people in the Gulf:
181.296	They are really, really aquatic people.
183.608	And they can handle water.
185.26	They can handle a hurricane
185.26	that comes and goes.
187.916	When the water goes down,
187.916	they know what to do.
190.26	But when it's something other than water,
190.26	and their water habitat changes,
195.04	they don't have many options.
196.713	In fact, those entire communities
196.713	really don't have many options.
200.795	They don't have another thing they can do.
203.455	They can't go and work
203.455	in the local hotel business
207.552	because there isn't one
207.552	in their community.
211.782	If you go to the Gulf and you look around,
211.782	you do see a lot of oil.
216.264	You see a lot of oil on the ocean.
218.137	You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.
220.26	If you go to the site of the blowout,
220.26	it looks pretty unbelievable.
224.26	It looks like you just emptied
224.26	the oil pan in your car,
227.26	and you just dumped it in the ocean.
229.555	And one of the really
229.555	most incredible things, I think,
232.444	is that there's nobody out there
232.444	trying to collect it
236.04	at the site where it is densest.
239.657	Parts of the ocean there
239.657	look just absolutely apocalyptic.
245.817	You go in along the shore,
245.817	you can find it everywhere.
250.316	It's really messy.
251.496	If you go to the places
251.496	where it's just arriving,
253.891	like the eastern part
253.891	of the Gulf, in Alabama,
256.35	there's still people using the beach
258.26	while there are people
258.26	cleaning up the beach.
260.427	And they have a very strange
260.427	way of cleaning up the beach.
263.173	They're not allowed to put
263.173	more than 10 pounds of sand
265.856	in a 50-gallon plastic bag.
267.588	They have thousands
267.588	and thousands of plastic bags.
269.968	I don't know what they'll do
269.968	with all that stuff.
272.282	Meanwhile, there are still
272.282	people trying to use the beach.
275.027	They don't see the sign
275.027	"that says: ""Stay out of the water."""
277.829	Their kids are in the water;
279.282	they're getting tar all over
279.282	their clothes and their sandals--
282.235	It's a mess.
283.47	If you go to where the oil has been
283.47	for a while, it's an even bigger mess.
286.998	And there's basically
286.998	nobody there anymore,
289.406	a few people trying to keep using it.
293.018	You see people who are really
293.018	shell-shocked.
295.38	They are very hardworking people.
297.393	All they know about life
297.393	is they get up in the morning,
300.027	and if their engine starts,
300.027	they go to work.
302.347	They always felt that
302.347	they could rely on the assurances
306.66	that nature brought them
306.66	through the ecosystem of the Gulf.
309.974	They're finding that their world
309.974	is really collapsing.
312.79	And so you can see, literally,
312.79	signs of their shock ...
320.26	signs of their outrage ...
325.882	signs of their anger ...
332.581	and signs of their grief.
336.094	These are the things that you can see.
340.26	There's a lot you can't see,
340.26	also, underwater.
344.886	What's going on underwater?
346.779	Well, some people say
346.779	there are oil plumes.
350.412	Some people say there are not oil plumes.
354.083	And Congressman Markey asks, you know,
356.458	"""Is it going to take a submarine ride"
356.458	"to see if there are really oil plumes?"""
361.987	But I couldn't take a submarine ride --
363.922	especially between the time I knew
363.922	I was coming here and today --
368.035	so I had to do a little experiment myself
371.26	to see if there was oil
371.26	in the Gulf of Mexico.
373.67	So this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
376.596	sparkling place full of fish.
379.671	And I created a little oil spill
379.671	in the Gulf of Mexico.
383.134	And I learned, in fact,
383.134	I confirmed the hypothesis
385.858	that oil and water don't mix ...
389.569	until you add a dispersant ...
393.348	and then ...
396.15	they start mixing.
398.669	And you add a little energy
398.669	from the wind and the waves,
402.914	and you get a big mess,
406.233	a big mess that you can't possibly clean,
409.392	you can't touch, you can't extract
412.437	and, I think most importantly --
412.437	this is what I think --
415.726	you can't see it.
417.26	I think it's being hidden on purpose.
420.618	Now this is such a catastrophe
420.618	and such a mess
423.26	that lots of stuff is leaking out
423.26	on the edges of the information stream.
426.954	But as many people have said,
428.635	there's a large attempt
428.635	to suppress what's going on.
431.769	Personally, I think that the dispersants
431.769	are a major strategy to hide the body,
438.765	because we put the murderer
438.765	in charge of the crime scene.
442.83	But you can see it.
444.26	You can see where the oil
444.26	is concentrated at the surface,
448.472	and then it is attacked,
451.127	because they don't want
451.127	the evidence, in my opinion.
454.637	OK.
456.158	We heard that bacteria eat oil?
458.679	So do sea turtles.
460.785	When it breaks up,
462.217	it has a long way to go
462.217	before it gets down to bacteria.
466.156	Turtles eat it.
466.156	It gets in the gills of fish.
469.26	These guys have to swim around through it.
471.541	I heard the most incredible story today
471.541	when I was on the train coming here.
476.959	A writer named Ted Williams called me,
479.783	and he was asking me
479.783	a couple of questions about what I saw,
482.691	because he's writing an article
482.691	for Audubon magazine.
485.858	He said that he had been in the Gulf
485.858	a little while ago; like about a week ago,
489.629	and a guy who had
489.629	been a recreational fishing guide
493.567	took him out to show him what's going on.
496.26	That guide's entire calendar year
496.26	is canceled bookings.
501.26	He has no bookings left.
503.197	Everybody wanted their deposit back,
503.197	everybody is fleeing.
506.26	That's the story of thousands of people.
508.251	But he told Ted
508.251	that on the last day he went out,
513.885	a bottlenose dolphin
513.885	suddenly appeared next to the boat,
518.027	and it was splattering oil
518.027	out its blowhole.
523.198	And he moved away
523.198	because it was his last fishing trip,
529.059	and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
531.26	So he moved away from it,
531.26	turned around a few minutes later,
535.168	it was right next to the side
535.168	of the boat again.
537.439	He said that in 30 years of fishing
537.439	he had never seen a dolphin do that.
540.884	And he felt that --
542.953	(Sigh)
544.18	he felt that it was
544.18	coming to ask for help.
548.198	Sorry.
550.652	Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill,
555.12	about 30 percent of the killer whales
555.12	died in the first few months.
559.898	Their numbers have never recovered.
561.842	So the recovery rate of all this stuff
561.842	is going to be variable.
566.731	It's going to take longer for some things.
569.58	And some things, I think,
569.58	will probably come back a little faster.
573.533	The other thing about the Gulf
573.533	that is important
576.26	is that there are a lot of animals
576.26	that concentrate in the Gulf
579.749	at certain parts of the year.
583.082	So the Gulf is a really
583.082	important piece of water --
585.713	more important than a similar volume
585.713	of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.
591.26	These tuna swim the entire ocean.
593.26	They get in the Gulf Stream,
593.26	they go all the way to Europe.
596.057	When it comes time to spawn,
596.057	they come inside,
598.249	and these two tuna that were tagged,
599.998	you can see them on the spawning grounds
602.122	very much right in the area of the slick.
604.851	They're probably having,
604.851	at the very least,
607.36	a catastrophic spawning season this year.
610.137	I'm hoping that maybe the adults
610.137	are avoiding that dirty water.
613.977	They don't usually like to go into water
613.977	that is very cloudy anyway.
618.408	But these are really
618.408	high-performance athletic animals.
622.224	I don't know what this kind of stuff
622.224	will do in their gills.
625.49	I don't know if it'll affect the adults.
627.46	If it's not, it's certainly affecting
627.46	their eggs and larvae,
630.301	I would certainly think.
631.512	But if you look at that graph
631.512	that goes down and down and down,
634.879	that's what we've done to this species
634.879	through overfishing over many decades.
639.624	So while the oil spill, the leak,
639.624	the eruption, is a catastrophe,
644.805	I think it's important to keep in mind
647.562	that we've done a lot to affect
647.562	what's in the ocean, for a very long time.
651.702	It's not like we're starting
651.702	with something that's been OK.
655.064	We're starting with something
655.064	that's had a lot of stresses
657.824	and a lot of problems to begin with.
659.71	If you look around at the birds,
659.71	there are a lot of birds in the Gulf
663.76	that concentrate in the Gulf
663.76	at certain times of the year,
666.551	but then leave.
667.859	And they populate much larger areas.
672.647	For instance, most of the birds
672.647	in this picture are migratory birds.
676.861	They were all on the Gulf in May,
678.727	while oil was starting
678.727	to come ashore in certain places.
681.868	Down on the lower left there
681.868	are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.
686.447	They breed in the High Arctic,
688.194	and they winter
688.194	down in southern South America.
690.78	But they concentrate in the Gulf
690.78	and then fan out all across the Arctic.
695.615	I saw birds that breed
695.615	in Greenland, in the Gulf.
700.112	So this is a hemispheric issue.
703.547	The economic effects
703.547	go at least nationally in many ways.
708.367	The biological effects
708.367	are certainly hemispheric.
714.127	I think that this is one of the most
714.127	absolutely mind-boggling examples
719.344	of total unpreparedness
719.344	that I can even think of.
722.18	Even when the Japanese
722.18	bombed Pearl Harbor,
726.102	at least they shot back.
727.533	And we just seem to be unable
727.533	to figure out what to do.
731.64	There was nothing ready,
735.3	and, you know, as we can see
735.3	by what they're doing.
738.714	Mainly what they're doing
738.714	is booms and dispersants.
741.502	The booms are absolutely
741.502	not made for open water.
745.278	They don't even attempt to corral
745.278	the oil where it is most concentrated.
750.143	They get near shore --
750.143	Look at these two boats.
752.401	That one on the right
752.401	is called Fishing Fool.
755.049	And I think, you know, that's a great name
757.083	for boats that think
757.083	that they're going to do anything
760.165	to make a dent in this,
760.165	by dragging a boom between them
763.261	when there are literally
763.261	hundreds of thousands of square miles
766.249	in the Gulf right now
766.249	with oil at the surface.
769.154	The dispersants make the oil
769.154	go right under the booms.
772.928	The booms are only
772.928	about 13 inches in diameter.
777.127	So it's just absolutely crazy.
780.177	Here are shrimp boats employed.
781.895	There are hundreds of shrimp boats
781.895	employed to drag booms instead of nets.
785.86	Here they are working.
787.207	You can see easily
789.028	that all the oily water
789.028	just goes over the back of the boom.
792.947	All they're doing is stirring it.
794.921	It's just ridiculous.
798.364	Also, for all the shoreline
798.364	that has booms --
800.493	hundreds and hundreds
800.493	of miles of shoreline --
802.688	all of the shoreline that has booms,
804.493	there's adjacent shoreline
804.493	that doesn't have any booms.
807.203	There is ample opportunity for oil
807.203	and dirty water to get in behind them.
812.26	And that lower photo,
812.26	that's a bird colony that has been boomed.
816.107	Everybody's trying to protect
816.107	the bird colonies there.
820.7	Well, as an ornithologist,
820.7	I can tell you that birds fly, and that --
825.955	(Laughter)
830.931	and that booming a bird colony
830.931	doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.
836.26	These birds make a living
836.26	by diving into the water.
840.883	In fact ...
843.4	really what I think
843.4	they should do, if anything --
846.567	they're trying so hard
846.567	to protect those nests --
849.728	actually, if they destroyed
849.728	every single nest,
852.425	some of the birds would leave,
854.485	and that would be better
854.485	for them this year.
857.675	As far as cleaning them ...
860.261	I don't mean to cast any aspersion
860.261	on people cleaning birds.
865.218	It's really, really important
865.218	that we express our compassion.
869.142	I think that's the most important
869.142	thing that people have, is compassion.
873.286	It's really important
873.286	to get those images and to show it.
877.26	But really, where are those birds
877.26	going to get released to?
880.659	It's like taking somebody
880.659	out of a burning building,
883.128	treating them for smoke inhalation
884.792	and sending them back into the building,
884.792	because the oil is still gushing.
888.946	I refuse to acknowledge this
888.946	as anything like an accident.
892.862	I think that this is the result
892.862	of gross negligence.
896.473	(Applause)
901.608	Not just BP.
903.915	BP operated very sloppily
903.915	and very recklessly because they could.
910.596	And they were allowed to do so
912.567	because of the absolute failure
912.567	of oversight of the government
916.984	that is supposed to be
916.984	our government, protecting us.
923.565	It turns out that --
925.098	you see this sign on every commercial
925.098	vessel in the United States --
928.353	you know, if you spilled
928.353	a couple of gallons of oil,
930.979	you would be in big trouble.
932.382	And you have to really wonder
932.382	who are the laws made for,
937.013	and who has gotten above the laws.
940.709	And there are things
940.709	that we can do in the future.
943.084	We could have the kinds of equipment
943.084	that we would really need.
946.16	It would not take
946.16	an awful lot to anticipate
949.136	that after making 30,000 holes
951.555	in the sea floor of the Gulf
951.555	of Mexico looking for oil,
954.404	oil might start coming out of one of them.
956.821	And you'd have some idea of what to do.
960.005	That's certainly
960.005	one of the things we need to do.
962.32	But I think we have to understand
962.32	where this leak really started from.
967.26	It really started from the destruction
967.26	of the idea that the government is there
972.631	because it's our government,
974.37	meant to protect
974.37	the larger public interest.
981.26	So I think that the oil blowout,
981.26	the bank bailout,
985.9	the mortgage crisis and all these things
985.9	are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.
993.496	We still seem to understand that at least,
996.389	we need the police to protect us
996.389	from a few bad people.
1000.803	And even though the police
1000.803	can be a little annoying at times --
1003.83	giving us tickets and stuff like that --
1005.765	nobody says that we should
1005.765	just get rid of them.
1008.314	But in the entire rest
1008.314	of government right now
1011.26	and for the last at least 30 years,
1013.146	there has been a culture of deregulation
1016.26	that is caused directly by the people
1016.26	who we need to be protected from,
1022.214	buying the government out from under us.
1025.523	(Applause)
1035.181	Now this has been a problem
1035.181	for a very, very long time.
1038.425	You can see that corporations were illegal
1038.425	at the founding of America,
1043.808	and even Thomas Jefferson complained
1046.54	that they were already bidding defiance
1046.54	to the laws of our country.
1053.422	OK, people who say they're conservative,
1056.951	if they really wanted to be
1056.951	really conservative and patriotic,
1061.788	they would tell
1061.788	these corporations to go to hell.
1065.443	That's what it would really mean
1065.443	to be conservative.
1069.067	So what we really need to do
1069.067	is regain the idea
1073.789	that it's our government
1073.789	safeguarding our interests,
1077.028	and regain a sense of unity
1077.028	and common cause in our country
1081.26	that really has been lost.
1084.192	I think there are signs of hope.
1086.146	We seem to be waking up a little bit.
1088.675	The Glass-Steagall Act --
1088.675	which was really to protect us
1091.711	from the kind of thing
1091.711	that caused the recession to happen,
1094.761	and the bank meltdown and all that stuff
1094.761	that required the bailouts --
1098.477	that was put in effect in 1933,
1098.477	was systematically destroyed.
1103.197	Now there's a mood to put
1103.197	some of that stuff back in place,
1106.958	but the lobbyists are already there
1106.958	trying to weaken the regulations
1111.503	after the legislation has just passed.
1114.26	So it's a continued fight.
1116.26	It's a historic moment right now.
1118.332	We're either going to have an absolutely
1118.332	unmitigated catastrophe
1122.369	of this oil leak in the Gulf,
1124.03	or we will make the moment
1124.03	we need out of this,
1126.7	as many people have noted today.
1128.391	There's certainly a common theme
1130.071	about needing to make
1130.071	the moment out of this.
1132.502	We've been through this before
1132.502	with other ways of offshore drilling.
1136.541	The first offshore wells
1136.541	were called whales.
1139.565	The first offshore drills
1139.565	were called harpoons.
1142.447	We emptied the ocean
1142.447	of the whales at that time.
1145.995	Now are we stuck with this?
1147.715	Ever since we lived in caves,
1147.715	every time we wanted any energy,
1151.651	we lit something on fire,
1151.651	and that is still what we're doing.
1155.226	We're still lighting something on fire
1155.226	every time we want energy.
1159.85	And people say we can't have clean energy
1163.359	because it's too expensive.
1166.26	Who says it's too expensive?
1168.056	People who sell us fossil fuels.
1170.338	We've been here before with energy,
1173.26	and people saying the economy
1173.26	cannot withstand a switch,
1177.385	because the cheapest energy was slavery.
1180.621	Energy is always a moral issue.
1183.402	It's an issue that is moral right now.
1185.691	It's a matter of right and wrong.
1188.258	Thank you very much.
1189.45	(Applause)
