13.087	So whenever I visit a school
13.087	and talk to students,
15.604	I always ask them the same thing:
18.754	Why do you Google?
20.624	Why is Google the search engine
20.624	of choice for you?
24.855	Strangely enough, I always get
24.855	the same three answers.
27.431	"One, ""Because it works,"""
29.494	which is a great answer;
29.494	that's why I Google, too.
32.424	Two, somebody will say,
34.481	"""I really don't know of any alternatives."""
37.708	It's not an equally great answer
37.708	and my reply to that is usually,
40.86	"""Try to Google the word 'search engine,'"
42.805	you may find a couple
42.805	"of interesting alternatives."""
45.231	And last but not least, thirdly,
47.35	inevitably, one student will raise
47.35	her or his hand and say,
50.684	"""With Google, I'm certain to always get"
50.684	"the best, unbiased search result."""
57.157	Certain to always get the best,
57.157	unbiased search result.
65.091	Now, as a man of the humanities,
67.505	albeit a digital humanities man,
69.71	that just makes my skin curl,
71.472	even if I, too, realize that that trust,
71.472	that idea of the unbiased search result
76.382	is a cornerstone in our collective love
76.382	for and appreciation of Google.
80.658	I will show you why that, philosophically,
80.658	is almost an impossibility.
84.94	But let me first elaborate,
84.94	just a little bit, on a basic principle
88.218	behind each search query
88.218	that we sometimes seem to forget.
91.851	So whenever you set out
91.851	to Google something,
93.955	start by asking yourself this:
93.955	"""Am I looking for an isolated fact?"""
98.334	What is the capital of France?
101.519	What are the building blocks
101.519	of a water molecule?
103.968	Great -- Google away.
106.333	There's not a group of scientists
106.333	who are this close to proving
109.477	that it's actually London and H30.
111.498	You don't see a big conspiracy
111.498	among those things.
113.893	We agree, on a global scale,
115.45	what the answers are
115.45	to these isolated facts.
118.199	But if you complicate your question
118.199	just a little bit and ask something like,
123.525	"""Why is there"
123.525	"an Israeli-Palestine conflict?"""
126.978	You're not exactly looking
126.978	for a singular fact anymore,
129.642	you're looking for knowledge,
131.499	which is something way more
131.499	complicated and delicate.
134.6	And to get to knowledge,
136.173	you have to bring 10 or 20
136.173	or 100 facts to the table
139.228	and acknowledge them and say,
139.228	"""Yes, these are all true."""
142.228	But because of who I am,
143.926	young or old, black or white,
143.926	gay or straight,
146.22	I will value them differently.
147.855	"And I will say, ""Yes, this is true,"
149.567	but this is more important
149.567	"to me than that."""
151.705	And this is where it becomes interesting,
153.719	because this is where we become human.
155.889	This is when we start
155.889	to argue, to form society.
158.909	And to really get somewhere,
158.909	we need to filter all our facts here,
162.29	through friends and neighbors
162.29	and parents and children
164.87	and coworkers and newspapers
164.87	and magazines,
166.926	to finally be grounded in real knowledge,
170.03	which is something that a search engine
170.03	is a poor help to achieve.
175.284	So, I promised you an example
175.284	just to show you why it's so hard
181.636	to get to the point of true, clean,
181.636	objective knowledge --
185.064	as food for thought.
186.556	I will conduct a couple of simple
186.556	queries, search queries.
190.473	"We'll start with ""Michelle Obama,"""
194.537	the First Lady of the United States.
196.365	And we'll click for pictures.
199.007	It works really well, as you can see.
201.303	It's a perfect search
201.303	result, more or less.
204.355	It's just her in the picture,
204.355	not even the President.
207.664	How does this work?
209.837	Quite simple.
211.233	Google uses a lot of smartness
211.233	to achieve this, but quite simply,
214.472	they look at two things
214.472	more than anything.
216.556	First, what does it say in the caption
216.556	under the picture on each website?
221.736	"Does it say ""Michelle Obama"""
221.736	under the picture?
223.975	Pretty good indication
223.975	it's actually her on there.
226.355	Second, Google looks at the picture file,
228.765	the name of the file as such
228.765	uploaded to the website.
231.821	"Again, is it called ""MichelleObama.jpeg""?"
234.839	Pretty good indication it's not
234.839	Clint Eastwood in the picture.
237.785	So, you've got those two and you get
237.785	a search result like this -- almost.
242.074	Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama
242.074	was the victim of a racist campaign,
248.701	where people set out to insult her
248.701	through her search results.
253.43	There was a picture distributed
253.43	widely over the Internet
256.156	where her face was distorted
256.156	to look like a monkey.
258.824	And that picture was published all over.
262.017	And people published it
262.017	very, very purposefully,
265.802	to get it up there in the search results.
267.797	They made sure to write
267.797	"""Michelle Obama"" in the caption"
270.776	and they made sure to upload the picture
270.776	"as ""MichelleObama.jpeg,"" or the like."
274.977	You get why -- to manipulate
274.977	the search result.
277.368	And it worked, too.
278.687	So when you picture-Googled
278.687	"for ""Michelle Obama"" in 2009,"
281.431	that distorted monkey picture
281.431	showed up among the first results.
284.842	Now, the results are self-cleansing,
288.432	and that's sort of the beauty of it,
290.209	because Google measures relevance
290.209	every hour, every day.
293.636	However, Google didn't settle
293.636	for that this time,
296.374	"they just thought, ""That's racist"
296.374	and it's a bad search result
299.522	and we're going to go back
299.522	and clean that up manually.
302.681	We are going to write
302.681	"some code and fix it,"""
305.637	which they did.
307.454	And I don't think anyone in this room
307.454	thinks that was a bad idea.
311.789	Me neither.
314.802	But then, a couple of years go by,
317.858	and the world's most-Googled Anders,
320.866	Anders Behring Breivik,
323.169	did what he did.
324.899	This is July 22 in 2011,
326.924	and a terrible day in Norwegian history.
329.597	This man, a terrorist, blew up
329.597	a couple of government buildings
333.408	walking distance from where we are
333.408	right now in Oslo, Norway
336.315	and then he traveled
336.315	to the island of Ut√∏ya
338.39	and shot and killed a group of kids.
341.113	Almost 80 people died that day.
344.397	And a lot of people would describe
344.397	this act of terror as two steps,
348.98	that he did two things: he blew up
348.98	the buildings and he shot those kids.
352.415	It's not true.
354.326	It was three steps.
356.493	He blew up those buildings,
356.493	he shot those kids,
358.731	and he sat down and waited
358.731	for the world to Google him.
363.227	And he prepared
363.227	all three steps equally well.
366.544	And if there was somebody
366.544	who immediately understood this,
369.358	it was a Swedish web developer,
370.906	a search engine optimization expert
370.906	in Stockholm, named Nikke Lindqvist.
374.553	He's also a very political guy
376.165	and he was right out there
376.165	in social media, on his blog and Facebook.
379.465	And he told everybody,
380.695	"""If there's something that"
380.695	this guy wants right now,
383.174	it's to control the image of himself.
386.76	Let's see if we can distort that.
389.49	Let's see if we, in the civilized world,
389.49	can protest against what he did
393.491	through insulting him
393.491	"in his search results."""
396.832	And how?
398.797	He told all of his readers the following,
400.877	"""Go out there on the Internet,"
402.765	find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --
406.708	find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks --
408.906	publish them in your feeds,
408.906	on your websites, on your blogs.
412.4	Make sure to write the terrorist's
412.4	name in the caption,
415.345	make sure to name
415.345	"the picture file ""Breivik.jpeg."""
419.856	Let's teach Google that that's
419.856	"the face of the terrorist."""
425.552	And it worked.
427.853	Two years after that campaign
427.853	against Michelle Obama,
430.775	this manipulation campaign
430.775	against Anders Behring Breivik worked.
434.065	If you picture-Googled for him weeks after
434.065	the July 22 events from Sweden,
438.551	you'd see that picture of dog poop
438.551	high up in the search results,
442.902	as a little protest.
445.425	Strangely enough, Google
445.425	didn't intervene this time.
450.494	They did not step in and manually
450.494	clean those search results up.
455.964	So the million-dollar question,
457.704	is there anything different
457.704	between these two happenings here?
461.096	Is there anything different between
461.096	what happened to Michelle Obama
464.313	and what happened
464.313	to Anders Behring Breivik?
466.402	Of course not.
468.861	It's the exact same thing,
470.356	yet Google intervened in one case
470.356	and not in the other.
473.244	Why?
475.283	Because Michelle Obama
475.283	is an honorable person, that's why,
478.607	and Anders Behring Breivik
478.607	is a despicable person.
482.142	See what happens there?
483.701	An evaluation of a person takes place
486.98	and there's only one
486.98	power-player in the world
490.79	with the authority to say who's who.
493.882	"""We like you, we dislike you."
495.647	We believe in you,
495.647	we don't believe in you.
497.71	You're right, you're wrong.
497.71	You're true, you're false.
500.281	"You're Obama, and you're Breivik."""
502.791	That's power if I ever saw it.
507.206	So I'm asking you to remember
507.206	that behind every algorithm
510.882	is always a person,
512.683	a person with a set of personal beliefs
515.202	that no code can ever
515.202	completely eradicate.
517.751	And my message goes
517.751	out not only to Google,
520.209	but to all believers in the faith
520.209	of code around the world.
523.043	You need to identify
523.043	your own personal bias.
526.043	You need to understand that you are human
528.08	and take responsibility accordingly.
531.891	And I say this because I believe
531.891	we've reached a point in time
534.853	when it's absolutely imperative
536.432	that we tie those bonds
536.432	together again, tighter:
539.673	the humanities and the technology.
542.483	Tighter than ever.
544.312	And, if nothing else, to remind us
544.312	that that wonderfully seductive idea
547.675	of the unbiased, clean search result
550.367	is, and is likely to remain, a myth.
553.984	Thank you for your time.
555.167	(Applause)
