12.711	Six thousand miles of road,
19.378	and a half a mile of tram track,
21.199	if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.
23.152	These are the numbers that make up
23.152	the infrastructure of New York City.
26.486	These are the statistics
26.486	of our infrastructure.
29.105	They're the kind of numbers you can find
29.105	released in reports by city agencies.
32.811	For example, the Department
32.811	of Transportation will probably tell you
36.01	how many miles of road they maintain.
37.791	The MTA will boast how many miles
37.791	of subway track there are.
40.612	Most city agencies give us statistics.
42.419	This is from a report this year
43.902	from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,
45.794	where we learn that there's about
49.07	Pretty interesting, right?
50.36	But did you ever think about
50.36	where these numbers came from?
53.144	Because for these numbers to exist,
53.144	someone at the city agency
56.047	had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number
56.047	that somebody might want want to know.
59.927	Here's a number 
59.927	that our citizens want to know.
62.177	So they go back to their raw data,
64.007	they count, they add, they calculate,
65.804	and then they put out reports,
67.271	and those reports
67.271	will have numbers like this.
69.448	The problem is, how do they know
69.448	all of our questions?
71.988	We have lots of questions.
73.231	In fact, in some ways there's literally
73.231	an infinite number of questions
76.571	that we can ask about our city.
78.22	The agencies can never keep up.
79.695	So the paradigm isn't exactly working,
79.695	and I think our policymakers realize that,
83.751	because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg
83.751	signed into law what he called
87.71	the most ambitious and comprehensive
87.71	open data legislation in the country.
91.547	In a lot of ways, he's right.
93.12	In the last two years, 
93.12	the city has released 1,000 datasets
95.981	on our open data portal,
97.591	and it's pretty awesome.
99.355	So you go and look at data like this,
101.323	and instead of just counting
101.323	the number of cabs,
103.612	we can start to ask different questions.
105.555	So I had a question.
106.755	When's rush hour in New York City?
108.456	It can be pretty bothersome.
108.456	When is rush hour exactly?
111.037	And I thought to myself,
111.037	these cabs aren't just numbers,
113.662	these are GPS recorders
113.662	driving around in our city streets
116.373	recording each and every ride they take.
118.286	There's data there,
118.286	and I looked at that data,
120.608	and I made a plot of the average speed of
120.608	taxis in New York City throughout the day.
124.569	You can see that from about midnight
124.569	to around 5:18 in the morning,
127.981	speed increases, and at that point,
127.981	things turn around,
131.544	and they get slower and slower and slower
131.544	until about 8:35 in the morning,
135.506	when they end up at around
138.199	The average taxi is going 11 and a half
138.199	miles per hour on our city streets,
141.761	and it turns out it stays that way
143.748	for the entire day.
147.116	(Laughter)
148.489	So I said to myself, I guess
148.489	there's no rush hour in New York City.
151.669	There's just a rush day.
153.206	Makes sense. And this is important
153.206	for a couple of reasons.
156.056	If you're a transportation planner,
156.056	this might be pretty interesting to know.
159.693	But if you want to get somewhere quickly,
161.668	you now know to set your alarm for
161.668	4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
165.136	New York, right?
166.18	But there's a story behind this data.
167.942	This data wasn't
167.942	just available, it turns out.
170.127	It actually came from something called
170.127	a Freedom of Information Law Request,
173.746	or a FOIL Request.
174.822	This is a form you can find on the
174.822	Taxi and Limousine Commission website.
178.288	In order to access this data,
178.288	you need to go get this form,
181.114	fill it out, and they will notify you,
182.96	and a guy named Chris Whong
182.96	did exactly that.
185.09	Chris went down, and they told him,
186.98	"""Just bring a brand new hard drive "
186.98	down to our office,
189.807	leave it here for five hours,
189.807	"we'll copy the data and you take it back."""
193.231	And that's where this data came from.
195.263	Now, Chris is the kind of guy
195.263	who wants to make the data public,
198.268	and so it ended up online for all to use,
198.268	and that's where this graph came from.
202.052	And the fact that it exists is amazing.
202.052	These GPS recorders -- really cool.
205.57	But the fact that we have citizens
205.57	walking around with hard drives
208.688	picking up data from city agencies
208.688	to make it public --
211.27	it was already kind of public,
211.27	you could get to it,
213.66	"but it was ""public,"" it wasn't public."
215.472	And we can do better than that as a city.
217.434	We don't need our citizens
217.434	walking around with hard drives.
220.19	Now, not every dataset
220.19	is behind a FOIL Request.
222.527	Here is a map I made with the most
222.527	dangerous intersections in New York City
226.329	based on cyclist accidents.
228.207	So the red areas are more dangerous.
230.146	And what it shows is first
230.146	the East side of Manhattan,
232.699	especially in the lower area of Manhattan,
232.699	has more cyclist accidents.
236.31	That might make sense
237.329	because there are more cyclists
237.329	coming off the bridges there.
240.225	But there's other hotspots worth studying.
242.239	There's Williamsburg.
242.239	There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.
244.908	And this is exactly the kind of data
244.908	we need for Vision Zero.
247.76	This is exactly what we're looking for.
249.75	But there's a story
249.75	behind this data as well.
251.885	This data didn't just appear.
253.952	How many of you guys know this logo?
256.343	Yeah, I see some shakes.
257.695	Have you ever tried to copy
257.695	and paste data out of a PDF
260.35	and make sense of it?
261.707	I see more shakes.
262.767	More of you tried copying and pasting
262.767	than knew the logo. I like that.
266.112	So what happened is, the data
266.112	that you just saw was actually on a PDF.
269.622	In fact, hundreds and hundreds
269.622	and hundreds of pages of PDF
272.727	put out by our very own NYPD,
274.886	and in order to access it,
274.886	you would either have to copy and paste
278.038	for hundreds and hundreds of hours,
279.764	or you could be John Krauss.
281.108	John Krauss was like,
282.151	I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
282.151	I'm going to write a program.
285.564	It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,
287.852	and it goes to the NYPD's website
287.852	and it would download PDFs.
290.884	Every day it would search;
290.884	if it found a PDF, it would download it
294.01	and then it would run
294.01	some PDF-scraping program,
296.26	and out would come the text,
297.596	and it would go on the Internet,
297.596	and then people could make maps like that.
301.161	And the fact that the data's here,
301.161	the fact that we have access to it --
304.59	Every accident, by the way,
304.59	is a row in this table.
307.04	You can imagine how many PDFs that is.
308.876	The fact that we
308.876	have access to that is great,
311.083	but let's not release it in PDF form,
313.193	because then we're having our citizens
313.193	write PDF scrapers.
315.932	It's not the best use
315.932	of our citizens' time,
318.008	and we as a city can do better than that.
320.012	Now, the good news is that
320.012	the de Blasio administration
322.748	actually recently released this data
322.748	a few months ago,
325.28	and so now we can
325.28	actually have access to it,
327.438	but there's a lot of data
327.438	still entombed in PDF.
329.974	For example, our crime data
329.974	is still only available in PDF.
333.171	And not just our crime data,
333.171	our own city budget.
336.926	Our city budget is only readable
336.926	right now in PDF form.
340.655	And it's not just us
340.655	that can't analyze it --
342.796	our own legislators
342.796	who vote for the budget
345.751	also only get it in PDF.
347.694	So our legislators cannot analyze 
347.694	the budget that they are voting for.
351.538	And I think as a city we can do
351.538	a little better than that as well.
355.146	Now, there's a lot of data
355.146	that's not hidden in PDFs.
357.634	This is an example of a map I made,
359.334	and this is the dirtiest waterways
359.334	in New York City.
362.26	Now, how do I measure dirty?
363.769	Well, it's kind of a little weird,
365.626	but I looked at the level
365.626	of fecal coliform,
367.739	which is a measurement of fecal matter
367.739	in each of our waterways.
371.245	The larger the circle,
371.245	the dirtier the water,
374.519	so the large circles are dirty water,
374.519	the small circles are cleaner.
377.876	What you see is inland waterways.
379.52	This is all data that was sampled
379.52	by the city over the last five years.
382.924	And inland waterways are,
382.924	in general, dirtier.
385.618	That makes sense, right?
386.836	And the bigger circles are dirty.
386.836	And I learned a few things from this.
390.21	Number one: Never swim in anything
390.21	"that ends in ""creek"" or ""canal."""
393.374	But number two: I also found
393.374	the dirtiest waterway in New York City,
397.692	by this measure, one measure.
399.526	In Coney Island Creek, which is not
399.526	the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.
403.174	It's on the other side.
404.332	But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent
404.332	of samples taken over the last five years
408.21	have had fecal levels so high
410.367	that it would be against state law
410.367	to swim in the water.
413.46	And this is not the kind of fact
413.46	that you're going to see
416.189	boasted in a city report, right?
417.726	It's not going to be 
417.726	the front page on nyc.gov.
419.976	You're not going to see it there,
421.556	but the fact that we can get 
421.556	to that data is awesome.
424.074	But once again, it wasn't super easy,
425.847	because this data was not
425.847	on the open data portal.
428.205	If you were to go to the open data portal,
430.218	you'd see just a snippet of it, 
430.218	a year or a few months.
432.831	It was actually on the Department
432.831	of Environmental Protection's website.
436.221	And each one of these links is an Excel 
436.221	sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.
440.099	Every heading is different:
440.099	you copy, paste, reorganize.
442.729	When you do you can make maps
442.729	and that's great, but once again,
445.681	we can do better than that 
445.681	as a city, we can normalize things.
448.65	And we're getting there, because
448.65	there's this website that Socrata makes
452.034	called the Open Data Portal NYC.
453.575	This is where 1,100 data sets 
453.575	that don't suffer
455.832	from the things I just told you live,
457.613	and that number is growing,
457.613	and that's great.
459.761	You can download data in any format,
459.761	be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
463.173	Whatever you want,
463.173	you can download the data that way.
465.72	The problem is, once you do,
467.072	you will find that each agency
467.072	codes their addresses differently.
470.758	So one is street name, 
470.758	intersection street,
472.899	street, borough, address, building,
472.899	building address.
475.39	So once again, you're spending time,
475.39	even when we have this portal,
478.57	you're spending time
478.57	normalizing our address fields.
481.176	And that's not the best use 
481.176	of our citizens' time.
483.599	We can do better than that as a city.
485.395	We can standardize our addresses,
487.04	and if we do, 
487.04	we can get more maps like this.
489.225	This is a map of fire hydrants
489.225	in New York City,
491.51	but not just any fire hydrants.
493.041	These are the top 250 grossing fire
493.041	hydrants in terms of parking tickets.
497.767	(Laughter)
499.753	So I learned a few things from this map,
499.753	and I really like this map.
503.111	Number one, just don't park
503.111	on the Upper East Side.
505.513	Just don't. It doesn't matter where
505.513	you park, you will get a hydrant ticket.
509.1	Number two, I found the two highest
509.1	grossing hydrants in all of New York City,
513.253	and they're on the Lower East Side,
515.139	and they were bringing in over
520.237	And that seemed a little strange
520.237	to me when I noticed it,
522.975	so I did a little digging and it turns out
522.975	what you had is a hydrant
526.244	and then something called
526.244	a curb extension,
528.24	which is like a seven-foot
528.24	space to walk on,
530.299	and then a parking spot.
531.455	And so these cars came along,
531.455	and the hydrant --
533.709	"""It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"""
535.62	and there was actually a parking spot
535.62	painted there beautifully for them.
539.094	They would park there, and the NYPD
539.094	disagreed with this designation
542.249	and would ticket them.
543.307	And it wasn't just me 
543.307	who found a parking ticket.
545.651	This is the Google 
545.651	Street View car driving by
547.797	finding the same parking ticket.
549.414	So I wrote about this on my blog,
549.414	on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,
553.918	and they said,
554.938	"""While the DOT has not received"
554.938	any complaints about this location,
558.348	we will review the roadway markings
558.348	"and make any appropriate alterations."""
562.89	And I thought to myself,
562.89	typical government response,
565.849	all right, moved on with my life.
567.73	But then, a few weeks later,
567.73	something incredible happened.
571.7	They repainted the spot,
574.22	and for a second I thought I saw
574.22	the future of open data,
576.91	because think about what happened here.
578.91	For five years, this spot was being 
578.91	ticketed, and it was confusing,
584.01	and then a citizen found something,
584.01	they told the city, and within a few weeks
588.316	the problem was fixed.
589.61	It's amazing. And a lot of people
589.61	see open data as being a watchdog.
592.81	It's not, it's about being a partner.
594.582	We can empower our citizens
594.582	to be better partners for government,
597.72	and it's not that hard.
599.601	All we need are a few changes.
601.06	If you're FOILing data,
602.167	if you're seeing your data 
602.167	being FOILed over and over again,
605.034	let's release it to the public, that's
605.034	a sign that it should be made public.
608.608	And if you're a government agency
608.608	releasing a PDF,
611.09	let's pass legislation that requires you
611.09	to post it with the underlying data,
614.739	because that data
614.739	is coming from somewhere.
616.767	I don't know where, but it's
616.767	coming from somewhere,
619.249	and you can release it with the PDF.
620.974	And let's adopt and share
620.974	some open data standards.
623.385	Let's start with our addresses
623.385	here in New York City.
625.866	Let's just start
625.866	normalizing our addresses.
627.94	Because New York is a leader in open data.
630.002	Despite all this, we are absolutely
630.002	a leader in open data,
632.791	and if we start normalizing things,
632.791	and set an open data standard,
635.912	others will follow. The state will follow,
635.912	and maybe the federal government,
639.546	Other countries could follow,
640.991	and we're not that far off from a time
640.991	where you could write one program
644.402	and map information from 100 countries.
646.292	It's not science fiction.
646.292	We're actually quite close.
648.779	And by the way, who are we
648.779	empowering with this?
651.019	Because it's not just John Krauss
651.019	and it's not just Chris Whong.
654.024	There are hundreds of meetups
654.024	going on in New York City right now,
657.119	active meetups.
658.144	There are thousands of people
658.144	attending these meetups.
660.716	These people are going after work
660.716	and on weekends,
663.084	and they're attending these meetups
663.084	to look at open data
665.72	and make our city a better place.
667.36	Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week 
667.36	released something called citygram.nyc
671.433	that allows you to subscribe
671.433	to 311 complaints
673.58	around your own home,
673.58	or around your office.
675.648	You put in your address,
675.648	you get local complaints.
678.075	And it's not just the tech community
678.075	that are after these things.
681.449	It's urban planners like 
681.449	the students I teach at Pratt.
684.071	It's policy advocates, it's everyone,
685.99	it's citizens from a diverse
685.99	set of backgrounds.
688.553	And with some small, incremental changes,
691.339	we can unlock the passion
691.339	and the ability of our citizens
694.564	to harness open data
694.564	and make our city even better,
697.72	whether it's one dataset,
697.72	or one parking spot at a time.
701.346	Thank you.
703.668	(Applause)
