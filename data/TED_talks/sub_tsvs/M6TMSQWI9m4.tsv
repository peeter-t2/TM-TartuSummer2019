12.995	Pat Mitchell: That day,
14.682	January 8, 2011, began like all others.
18.555	You were both doing the work that you love.
21.704	You were meeting with constituents,
23.885	which is something that you loved doing
26.05	as a congresswoman,
27.217	and Mark, you were happily preparing
29.622	for your next space shuttle.
32.901	And suddenly, everything 
32.901	that you had planned
37.08	or expected in your lives
39.031	was irrevocably changed forever.
42.88	Mark Kelly: Yeah, it's amazing,
43.879	it's amazing how 
43.879	everything can change
45.653	for any of us in an instant.
47.86	People don't realize that.
49.508	I certainly didn't.
50.698	Gabby Giffords: Yes.
51.356	MK: And on that Saturday morning,
52.606	I got this horrible phone call
55.57	from Gabby's chief of staff.
57.628	She didn't have much other information.
59.648	"She just said, ""Gabby was shot."""
61.977	A few minutes later, I called her back
63.194	and I actually thought for a second,
65.575	well, maybe I just imagined 
65.575	getting this phone call.
68.314	I called her back, and 
68.314	that's when she told me
70.016	that Gabby had been shot in the head.
72.319	And from that point on,
74.144	I knew that our lives were 
74.144	going to be a lot different.
77.756	PM: And when you arrived at the hospital,
79.733	what was the prognosis that they gave you
82.457	about Gabby's condition 
82.457	and what recovery, if any,
85.705	you could expect?
87.196	MK: Well, for a gunshot wound to the head
89.136	and a traumatic brain injury,
90.338	they typically can't tell you much.
93.449	Every injury is different. It's not predictable
96.198	like often a stroke might be predictable,
98.012	which is another TBI kind of injury.
100.746	So they didn't know how long
100.746	Gabby would be in a coma,
103.738	didn't know when that would change
106.533	and what the prognosis would be.
109.696	PM: Gabby, has your recovery
113.502	been an effort to create 
113.502	a new Gabby Giffords
118.004	or reclaim the old Gabby Giffords?
121.287	GG: The new one -- better, stronger, tougher.
125.853	(Applause)
130.21	MK: That to say,
132.57	when you look at the picture behind us,
135.976	to come back from that kind of injury
137.62	and come back strong 
137.62	and stronger than ever
139.848	is a really tough thing to do.
141.684	I don't know anybody
143.178	that's as tough as my 
143.178	wonderful wife right here.
145.8	(Applause)
149.052	PM: And what were the first signs
151.98	that recovery was not 
151.98	only going to be possible
155.445	but you were going to have some semblance
158.096	of the life that you and Gabby had planned?
160.701	MK: Well, the first thing, for me, was
162.979	Gabby was still kind of almost unconscious,
166.439	but she did something when she
166.439	was in the ICU hospital bed
171.965	that she used to do when we might
173.75	be out to dinner at a restaurant,
175.685	in that she pulled my ring off
177.568	and she flipped it from one finger to the next,
180.667	and at that point I knew
182.812	that she was still in there.
184.396	PM: And there were certain words, too.
186.062	Didn't she surprise you with 
186.062	words in the beginning?
189.113	MK: Well, it was tough in the beginning.
189.113	GG: What? What? Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.
195.05	MK: Yeah, that was it.
196.43	For the first month, that was the extent
199.67	of Gabby's vocabulary.
201.146	For some reason, she has aphasia,
203.782	which is difficulty with communication.
205.778	"She latched on to the word ""chicken,"""
208.22	which isn't the best but 
208.22	certainly is not the worst.
211.496	(Laughter)
212.981	And we were actually worried
214.344	it could have been a lot worse than that.
218.585	PM: Gabby, what's been 
218.585	the toughest challenge
220.945	for you during this recovery?
223.737	GG: Talking. Really hard. Really.
228.041	MK: Yeah, with aphasia, Gabby
228.041	knows what she wants to say,
231.139	she just can't get it out.
233.013	She understands everything,
234.425	but the communication is just very difficult
236.775	because when you look at the picture,
239.017	the part of your brain where
239.017	those communication centers are
243.653	are on the left side of your head,
245.433	which is where the bullet passed through.
247.22	PM: So you have to do 
247.22	a very dangerous thing:
249.433	speak for your wife.
251.079	MK: I do.
252.684	It might be some of the most
252.684	dangerous things I've ever done.
257.02	PM: Gabby, are you optimistic
258.92	about your continuing recovery --
262.183	walking, talking,
264.407	being able to move your arm and leg?
266.911	GG: I'm optimistic. It will be a long, hard haul,
271.265	but I'm optimistic.
274.113	PM: That seems to be the number one 
274.113	characteristic of Gabby Giffords,
277.317	wouldn't you say? (Applause)
278.596	MK: Gabby's always been really optimistic.
280.026	She works incredibly hard every day.
282.804	GG: On the treadmill, 
282.804	walked on my treadmill,
285.808	Spanish lessons, French horn.
289.285	MK: It's only my wife who could be --
291.93	and if you knew her before she was injured,
293.678	you would kind of understand this --
295.59	somebody who could be injured
297.3	and have such a hard time communicating
300.22	and meets with a speech therapist,
302.13	and then about a month ago, she says,
304.165	"""I want to learn Spanish again."""
307.867	PM: Well, let's take a little closer look
309.901	at the wife, and this was even before
312.799	you met Gabby Giffords.
314.525	And she's on a motor scooter there,
316.565	but it's my understanding that's a very tame image
320.085	of what Gabby Giffords was like growing up.
322.581	MK: Yeah, Gabby, she 
322.581	used to race motorcycles.
325.333	So that's a scooter, but she had --
327.253	well, she still has a BMW motorcycle.
330.739	PM: Does she ride it?
330.739	MK: Well, that's a challenge
333.415	with not being able to move her right arm,
336.063	but I think with something
336.063	I know about, Velcro,
340.249	we might be able to get her back on the bike,
342.505	Velcro her right hand up onto the handlebar.
347.119	PM: I have a feeling we might 
347.119	see that picture next,
349.417	Gabby.
351.05	But you meet, you're already decided
353.495	that you're going to dedicate 
353.495	your life to service.
356.485	You're going into the military
358.492	and eventually to become an astronaut.
360.773	So you meet.
363.293	What attracts you to Gabby?
366.07	MK: Well, when we met, oddly enough,
369.674	it was the last time we were in Vancouver,
372.28	about 10 years ago. We met in Vancouver,
374.726	at the airport, on a trip 
374.726	that we were both taking
378.675	to China,
380.53	that I would actually, from my background,
382.574	I would call it a boondoggle.
384.802	Gabby would —
384.802	GG: Fact-finding mission.
387.624	MK: She would call it an
387.624	important fact-finding mission.
391.194	She was a state senator at the time,
393.58	and we met here, at the airport,
396.614	before a trip to China.
398.132	PM: Would you describe it 
398.132	as a whirlwind romance?
400.738	GG: No, no, no.
402.786	(Laughter)
405.486	A good friend.
407.252	MK: Yeah, we were friends for a long time.
409.83	GG: Yes. (Laughter)
414.711	MK: And then she invited me
414.711	on, about a year or so later,
420.567	she invited me on a date.
423.267	Where'd we go, Gabby?
424.701	GG: Death row.
425.899	MK: Yes. Our first date was to death row
430.245	at the Florence state prison in Arizona,
433.549	which was just outside 
433.549	Gabby's state senate district.
438.959	They were working on some legislation
440.856	that had to do with crime and punishment
443.691	and capital punishment 
443.691	in the state of Arizona.
445.625	So she couldn't get anybody 
445.625	else to go with her,
448.449	"and I'm like, ""Of course I "
448.449	"want to go to death row."""
452.248	So that was our first date.
454.637	We've been together ever since.
454.637	GG: Yes.
457.367	PM: Well, that might have contributed to the reason
459.457	that Gabby decided to marry you.
462.009	You were willing to go to death row, after all.
464.781	MK: I guess.
465.865	PM: Gabby, what did make you want to marry Mark?
469.545	GG: Um, good friends. Best friends. Best friends.
475.781	MK: I thought we always
479.271	had a very special relationship.
481.503	We've gone through some tough times
483.395	and it's only made it stronger.
483.395	GG: Stronger.
487.421	PM: After you got married, however,
489.967	you continued very independent lives.
492.89	Actually, you didn't even live together.
495.211	MK: We had one of those commuter marriages.
497.045	In our case, it was Washington, D.C., Houston,
500.1	Tucson.
501.223	Sometimes we'd go clockwise,
502.903	sometimes counterclockwise,
504.457	to all those different places,
506.072	and we didn't really live together
509.949	until that Saturday morning.
512.249	Within an hour of Gabby being shot,
514.547	I was on an airplane to Tucson,
516.129	and that was the moment
518.01	where that had changed things.
520.753	PM: And also, Gabby, you had run for Congress
523.245	after being a state senator
525.517	and served in Congress for six years.
528.541	What did you like best
530.067	about being in Congress?
532.439	GG: Fast pace. Fast pace.
536.231	PM: Well it was the way you did it.
536.231	GG: Yes, yes. Fast pace.
538.639	PM: I'm not sure people would
538.639	describe it entirely that way.
541.483	(Laughter)
543.196	MK: Yeah, you know, legislation is often
545.296	at a colossally slow pace,
547.683	but my wife, and I have to admit,
550.111	a lot of other members of Congress that I know,
551.78	work incredibly hard.
553.188	I mean, Gabby would run 
553.188	around like a crazy person,
555.463	never take a day off,
557.317	maybe a half a day off a month,
559.443	and whenever she was awake she was working,
561.923	and she really, really thrived on that,
564.308	and still does today.
564.308	GG: Yes. Yes.
566.689	PM: Installing solar panels on the top of her house,
569.067	I have to say.
570.349	So after the tragic incident, Mark,
573.927	you decided to resign
575.656	your position as an astronaut,
577.356	even though you were supposed to take
578.91	the next space mission.
580.651	Everybody, including Gabby,
582.332	talked you into going back,
583.912	and you did end up taking.
585.785	MK: Kind of. The day after Gabby was injured,
588.953	I called my boss, the chief astronaut,
591.057	Dr. Peggy Whitson, and I said,
593.009	"""Peggy, I know I'm launching in space"
594.674	in three months from now.
596.967	Gabby's in a coma. I'm in Tucson.
599.418	"You've got to find a replacement for me."""
601.233	So I didn't actually resign from being an astronaut,
602.953	but I gave up my job and they found a replacement.
605.875	Months later, maybe about two months later,
608.865	I started about getting my job back,
611.075	which is something,
612.74	when you become this primary caregiver person,
615.153	which some people in the audience here
617.545	have certainly been in that position,
620.093	it's a challenging role but at some point
621.87	you've got to figure out when
621.87	you're going to get your life back,
624.591	and at the time, I couldn't ask Gabby
626.364	if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again.
630.045	But I knew she was—
630.045	GG: Yes. Yes. Yes.
632.607	MK: She was the biggest 
632.607	supporter of my career,
634.647	and I knew it was the right thing to do.
636.843	PM: And yet I'm trying to imagine, Mark,
638.848	what that was like, going off onto a mission,
642.126	one presumes safely, 
642.126	but it's never a guarantee,
645.623	and knowing that Gabby is —
648.66	MK: Well not only was 
648.66	she still in the hospital,
652.128	on the third day of that flight,
654.488	literally while I was
655.75	rendezvousing with the space station,
657.323	and you've got two vehicles
657.323	moving at 17,500 miles an hour,
660.874	I'm actually flying it, looking out the window,
663.489	a bunch of computers,
665.168	Gabby was in brain surgery,
667.992	literally at that time having the final surgery
670.676	to replace the piece of skull
673.618	that they took out on the day she was injured
675.367	with a prosthetic, yeah, which
675.367	is the whole side of her head.
679.06	Now if any of you guys would ever come
681.04	to our house in Tucson for the first time,
684.276	Gabby would usually go up to the freezer
686.012	and pull out the piece of Tupperware
688.08	that has the real skull. (Laughter)
691.14	GG: The real skull.
691.14	MK: Which freaks people out, sometimes.
694.244	PM: Is that for appetizer or dessert, Mark?
697.936	MK: Well, it just gets the conversation going.
702.034	PM: But there was a lot 
702.034	of conversation about
704.062	something you did, Gabby, after Mark's flight.
707.14	You had to make another 
707.14	step of courage too,
710.578	because here was 
710.578	Congress deadlocked again,
714.38	and you got out of the rehabilitation center,
720.302	got yourself to Washington
722.773	so that you could walk 
722.773	on the floor of the House --
725.67	I can barely talk about this
725.67	without getting emotional —
728.322	and cast a vote which could have been
731.281	the deciding vote.
733.116	GG: The debt ceiling. The debt ceiling.
736.365	MK: Yeah, we had that vote,
738.924	I guess about five months after Gabby was injured,
740.874	and she made this bold decision to go back.
743.372	A very controversial vote,
745.525	but she wanted to be there
747.034	to have her voice heard one more time.
749.631	PM: And after that, resigned
751.406	and began what has been a very slow
755.36	and challenging recovery.
757.848	What's life like, day to day?
760.986	MK: Well, that's Gabby's service dog Nelson.
763.973	GG: Nelson.
764.936	MK: New member of our family.
764.936	GG: Yes, yes.
767.479	MK: And we got him from a—
770.271	GG: Prison. Murder.
770.271	MK: We have a lot of connections
772.134	with prisons, apparently. (Laughter)
774.786	Nelson came from a prison,
776.175	raised by a murderer in Massachusetts.
780.719	But she did a great job with this dog.
785.049	He's a fabulous service dog.
787.436	PM: So Gabby, what have you learned
790.379	from your experiences the past few years?
794.513	MK: Yeah, what have you learned?
794.513	GG: Deeper. Deeper.
800.521	PM: Your relationship is deeper.
802.383	It has to be. You're together all the time now.
805.582	MK: I imagine being grateful, too, right?
808.04	GG: Grateful.
809.422	PM: This is a picture of 
809.422	family and friends gathering,
811.489	but I love these pictures because they show
815.822	the Gabby and Mark relationship now.
819.357	And you describe it, Gabby, over and over,
821.885	as deeper on so many levels. Yes?
827.71	MK: I think when something tragic happens
829.262	in a family, it can pull people together.
831.916	Here's us watching the space shuttle
834.08	fly over Tucson,
836.13	the Space Shuttle Endeavour,
837.276	the one that I was the 
837.276	commander on its last flight,
839.847	on its final flight on top of an airplane
843.353	on a 747 on its way to L.A.,
846.473	NASA was kind enough 
846.473	to have it fly over Tucson.
851.083	PM: And of course, the two of you
854.559	go through these challenges
856.141	of a slow and difficult recovery,
858.533	and yet, Gabby, how do you maintain
861.214	your optimism and positive outlook?
864.941	GG: I want to make the world a better place.
868.086	(Applause)
875.508	PM: And you're doing that
877.366	even though your recovery has to remain
879.56	front and center for both of you.
881.462	You are people who have done service
883.74	to your country and you 
883.74	are continuing to do that
887.442	with a new initiative, a new purpose.
890.461	And Gabby, what's on the agenda now?
893.868	GG: Americans for Responsible Solutions.
897.223	MK: That's our political action committee,
901.362	where we are trying to 
901.362	get members of Congress
904.759	to take a more serious look at
904.759	gun violence in this country,
908.11	and to try to
909.16	pass some reasonable legislation.
911.21	GG: Yes. Yes. (Applause)
919.213	MK: You know, this affected 
919.213	us very personally,
921.69	but it wasn't what happened
921.69	to Gabby that got us involved.
924.412	It was really the 20 murdered first graders
928.24	and kindergartners in Newtown, Connecticut,
931.178	and the response that we saw afterwards
933.732	where -- well, look what's happened so far.
937.157	So far the national response has been
939.182	pretty much to do nothing.
940.51	We're trying to change that.
942.322	PM: There have been 11 mass shootings
943.814	since Newtown,
944.972	a school a week in the first 
944.972	two months of last year.
948.186	What are you doing that's different
949.91	than other efforts to balance
952.14	rights for gun ownership and responsibilities?
954.962	MK: We're gun owners, 
954.962	we support gun rights.
957.304	At the same time, we've 
957.304	got to do everything we can
959.546	to keep guns out of the hands of criminals
962.083	and the dangerously mentally ill.
963.976	It's not too difficult to do that.
966.494	This issue, like many others,
968.17	has become very polarizing and political,
972.159	and we're trying to bring some balance
974.46	to the debate in Washington.
975.924	PM: Thank you both for that effort.
977.962	And not surprisingly for 
977.962	this woman of courage
981.196	and of a sense of adventure,
982.992	you just keep challenging yourself,
985.351	and the sky seems to be the limit.
987.154	I have to share this video
988.898	of your most recent adventure.
991.446	Take a look at Gabby.
994.38	MK: This is a couple months ago.
1001.879	(Video) MK: You okay? You did great.
1001.879	GG: Yes, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

1021.071	MK: Let me just say
1023.913	one of the guys that Gabby jumped with
1025.948	that day was a Navy SEAL
1028.018	who she met in Afghanistan
1030.286	who was injured in combat,
1031.835	had a really rough time.
1033.327	Gabby visited him
1034.861	when he was at Bethesda
1036.539	and went through a really tough period.
1038.94	He started doing better.
1040.447	Months later, Gabby was shot in the head,
1042.697	and then he supported her
1043.971	while she was in the hospital in Houston.
1045.973	So they have a very, very nice connection.
1048.178	GG: Yes.
1049.42	PM: What a wonderful moment.
1050.576	Because this is the TED stage,
1052.533	Gabby, I know you worked very hard
1055.956	to think of the ideas that you wanted to leave
1059.27	with this audience.

1083.901	physical therapy, and yoga too.
1087.166	But my spirit is strong as ever.
1089.68	I'm still fighting to make 
1089.68	the world a better place,
1093.88	and you can too.
