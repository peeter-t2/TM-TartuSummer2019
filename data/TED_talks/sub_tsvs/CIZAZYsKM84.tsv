25	I'd like to speak about technology trends,
29	which is something that many of you follow --
33	but we also follow, for related reasons.
37	Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends
40	are something that we write about and need to know about.
44	But also it's part of being any monthly magazine --
47	you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
50	We have to plan issues many months in advance;
52	we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,
55	nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
60	We also, like a lot of companies, create a product
62	that's based on technology trends.
63	In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,
68	some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
72	And so we have to understand
74	not only why tech's important, where it's going,
76	but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
82	And it's interesting, when you look at the predictions made
86	during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,
91	or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,
96	they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
100	Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
103	But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations
107	is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
112	You've probably seen something like this before.
114	This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about
116	kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
119	And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,
121	to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,
125	or whether they were about to crash
126	into the trough of disillusionment,
129	or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
134	And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense
137	of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
141	We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important;
144	we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
148	We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,
151	we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
153	You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
157	But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies
161	are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
163	And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
168	And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
172	I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends
175	"that I call my ""grand unified theory of predicting the future,"""
179	but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
185	It's based on the presumption, the observation even,
188	that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --
193	at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
197	And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --
202	a collision with something else --
205	for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology
209	and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
213	And these are the inflection points that tell you
216	what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
220	and maybe how you can do something about it.
224	The first is the critical price.
226	The first stage in a technology's advance
228	is that it'll fall below a critical price.
232	After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,
234	if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
239	Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,
245	and that's another important point.
249	And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
252	Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
255	Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it;
258	it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
260	And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --
264	you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,
268	but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --
271	there's still more opportunity in that.
273	I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this
275	by telling the story of the DVD,
277	which is a technology which has done all of these.
280	The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s
283	and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,
288	it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
293	And it started to take off. And you can see that the units
297	started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
303	The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case,
312	And what's interesting here
314	is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
319	Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;
321	you've got high-quality digital video;
323	you have a reason to have a big-screen television;
325	you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
329	And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,
331	and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
333	What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
337	Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,
342	that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
346	The next phase it hit was displacement.
348	You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
352	And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
358	Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD
362	in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
365	Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;
368	you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
371	That gave an advantage; that was an implication
375	of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
379	And then finally, DVDs are approaching free.
382	There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,
384	who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one
388	DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
395	You're aware of the
397	perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede
401	over the 30-dollar DVD.
405	But they're getting very, very cheap,
407	and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,
411	the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,
414	and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
416	They're being commodified, and that's what happens
418	when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
423	(Laughter)
426	Now they've introduced these four ways of looking at technology,
429	these four stages of technology's life.
431	I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,
434	just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,
437	these four, as a way to kind of tell you
439	where each one of those technologies is in its development.
442	They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --
445	they're just examples of technologies
446	that are in each one of these periods.
449	But I think that the implications of them approaching
452	these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
455	Start with gene sequencing.
457	As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,
460	because it's built on computers -- is falling in price
463	at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
465	It is now possible -- will be possible,
468	and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,
471	he may tell you something about this --
472	to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
477	That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
482	You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation
487	is getting closer and closer.
489	What's interesting is that at the same time, the number of genes
492	that we're discovering is rising very quickly.
494	Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
497	There will come a day
499	when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,
503	if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
508	Here's another technology that's approaching a critical price.
511	This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect
515	of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
522	In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
528	The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,
531	and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
535	Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
540	And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,
545	if you look at the correlation between these two,
548	as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat
551	goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO
557	believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --
561	two million in sub-Saharan Africa.
563	And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
566	Linux is another good example.
568	Now we've switched to critical mass.
570	These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
572	If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
578	Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,
580	but not the crossovers that matter.
582	The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
585	But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,
587	you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
590	It's not just for the geeks any more.
594	That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond
596	wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
598	(Laughter)
600	Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars.
604	I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
607	And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --
611	and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --
613	they'll be two percent of auto sales.
615	Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,
618	which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
624	At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
627	And what's interesting about the hybrids taking off
631	is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
635	It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
639	And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:
642	you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
645	You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;
648	you can have replaceable body shapes --
650	it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,
652	but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
655	Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
658	Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;
659	it's a little hard to use right now.
661	There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
665	Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;
668	they already have nearly four million registered users --
673	that's critical mass.
676	And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
679	You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional
683	telecom standards. This is a tipping point --
687	if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,
691	and the speed, and the players in the industry.
695	It's going to look a little bit like that.
701	And finally, free. Free is really, really interesting.
707	Free is something that comes with digital, because
713	the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,
719	because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,
722	because there's so much bandwidth.
723	Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
728	It's an economic force; it's a technical force.
731	It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
735	It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
738	Free is probably the most interesting thing.
740	And here you have just the number of songs
743	that can be stored on a hard drive.
745	You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,
749	but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored
752	on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,
759	the physical element, of songs off the table.
763	And you've seen the numbers.
764	I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding
768	in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
771	They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
776	And their response is draconian, and not necessarily
783	the one that's going to get them out of this.
787	And finally, I'll give you one last example of free --
790	perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --
793	their abundance tends to make things free.
795	This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
799	And what's interesting is that it was just 1990
802	when it was more than two dollars a minute.
805	India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
813	It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,
818	but then there was just so much fiber out there,
821	you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
825	It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
829	And the consequence of cheap phone calling, free phone calling,
834	to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
839	It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization
843	and one of the most powerful economic tools
846	that we're seeing in our world today.
847	The force of India, and then China, and any other country
852	that can contact our markets
854	and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --
859	is just beginning to be felt.
861	And I think that's probably one
862	of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
864	Thank you.
