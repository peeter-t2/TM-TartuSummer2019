12.86	I was born in Taiwan.
14.595	I grew up surrounded by
16.419	different types of hardware stores,
19.119	and I like going to night markets.
21.467	I love the energy of the night markets,
23.307	the colors, the lights, the toys,
25.859	and all the unexpected things I find every time I go,
29.302	things like watermelon with straw antennas
32.672	or puppies with mohawks.
36.494	When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart,
39.304	any kind of toys I'd find around the house,
41.328	like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.
43.562	I also liked to make environments
45.58	for people to explore and play.
47.668	In these early installations,
49.618	I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags,
52.146	and things I would find in the hardware store
53.986	or around the house.
55.202	I would take things like highlighter pen,
57.938	mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing,
61.39	creating these glowing circulatory systems
63.902	for people to walk through and enjoy.
66.286	I like these materials because of the way they look,
68.794	the way they feel, and they're very affordable.
72.09	I also liked to make devices
72.09	that work with body parts.
74.916	I would take camera LED lights
77.094	and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist
79.235	and I would videotape my belly button,
81.394	get a different perspective,
82.416	and see what it does.
84.778	(Laughter)
86.94	I also like to modify household appliances.
89.522	This is an automatic night light.
90.82	Some of you might have them at home.
92.434	I would cut out the light sensor,
94.066	add an extension line,
95.97	and use modeling clay,
97.466	stick it onto the television,
99.242	and then I would videotape my eye,
101.254	and using the dark part of my eye
103.122	tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time,
105.002	so you turn on the lightbulb.
106.754	The white of the eye and the eyelid
108.674	will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime,
110.866	and it will shut off the light.
113.632	I wanted to collect more different types of eyes,
115.72	so I built this device using bicycle helmets,
118.464	some lightbulbs and television sets.
120.88	It would be easier for other
120.88	people to wear the helmet
123.271	and record their eyes.
125.596	This device allows me to symbolically
128.718	extract other people's eyes,
130.262	so I have a diversity of eyes to use
132.159	for my other sculptures.
140.829	This sculpture has four eyes.
142.589	Each eye is controlling a different device.
144.757	This eye is turning itself around in a television.
148.237	This eye is inflating a plastic tube.
150.653	This eye is watching a video
150.653	of another piece being made.
154.229	And these two eyes are activating glowing water.
158.191	Many of these pieces are later on shown
160.173	in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions
162.517	around the world.
164.867	I love science and biology.
167.23	In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship
169.717	at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum
171.765	looking at bioluminous organisms in the oean.
174.573	I love these creatures. I love the
174.573	way they look, the way they feel.
177.677	They're soft, they're slimy,
180.535	and I was fascinated by the way they use light
182.725	in their environment,
183.95	either to attract mates, for self-defense,
186.02	or to attract food.
188.818	This research inspired my
188.818	work in many different ways,
191.237	things like movement or different light patterns.
198.184	So I started gathering a lot of
199.621	different types of material in my studio
202.352	and just experimenting
203.547	and trying this out, trying that out,
205.371	and seeing what types of creatures I can come up with.
207.995	I used a lot of computer cooling fans
210.259	and just kind of put them
210.259	together and see what happens.
213.755	This is an 8,000-square-foot installation
215.955	composed of many different creatures,
217.363	some hanging from the ceiling
217.363	and some resting on the floor.
220.846	From afar, they look alien-like,
222.134	but when you look closer,
223.802	they're all made out of black garbage bags
225.33	or Tupperware containers.
226.95	I'd like to share with you how ordinary things
229.91	can become something magical and wondrous.
246.71	(Applause)
304.879	Thank you.
306.735	(Applause)
