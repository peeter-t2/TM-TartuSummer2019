15.141	I grew up with my identical twin,
18.461	who was an incredibly loving brother.
21.477	Now, one thing about being a twin is,
24.573	it makes you an expert
24.573	at spotting favoritism.
28.642	If his cookie was even
28.642	slightly bigger than my cookie,
33.723	I had questions.
35.099	And clearly, I wasn't starving.
38.3	(Laughter)
40.873	When I became a psychologist,
40.873	I began to notice favoritism
45.02	of a different kind;
46.758	and that is, how much more we value
46.758	the body than we do the mind.
52.187	I spent nine years at university
52.187	earning my doctorate in psychology,
58.245	and I can't tell you how many people
58.245	look at my business card and say,
62.523	"""Oh -- a psychologist."
62.523	"So, not a real doctor,"""
68.209	as if it should say that on my card.
70.031	[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist
70.031	(Not a Real Doctor)]
72.84	(Laughter)
74.952	This favoritism we show the body
74.952	over the mind --
79.36	I see it everywhere.
81.718	I recently was at a friend's house,
83.409	and their five-year-old
83.409	was getting ready for bed.
85.955	He was standing on a stool
85.955	by the sink, brushing his teeth,
89.584	when he slipped and scratched his leg
89.584	on the stool when he fell.
93.996	He cried for a minute,
93.996	but then he got back up,
96.992	got back on the stool, and reached out
96.992	for a box of Band-Aids
100.53	to put one on his cut.
103.05	Now, this kid could barely
103.05	tie his shoelaces,
107.011	but he knew you have to cover a cut
107.011	so it doesn't become infected,
111.462	and you have to care for your teeth
111.462	by brushing twice a day.
115.425	We all know how to maintain
115.425	our physical health
118.369	and how to practice dental hygiene, right?
120.908	We've known it since
120.908	we were five years old.
124.442	But what do we know about maintaining
124.442	our psychological health?
130.07	Well, nothing.
131.778	What do we teach our children
131.778	about emotional hygiene?
136.74	Nothing.
138.767	How is it that we spend more time
138.767	taking care of our teeth
143.595	than we do our minds?
146.202	Why is it that our physical health
146.202	is so much more important to us
151.036	than our psychological health?
153.393	We sustain psychological injuries
153.393	even more often than we do physical ones,
158.807	injuries like failure
158.807	or rejection or loneliness.
163.037	And they can also get worse
163.037	if we ignore them,
165.832	and they can impact our lives
165.832	in dramatic ways.
169.285	And yet, even though there are
169.285	scientifically proven techniques
173.489	we could use to treat these
173.489	kinds of psychological injuries,
177.803	we don't.
179.374	It doesn't even occur to us
179.374	that we should.
182.434	"""Oh, you're feeling depressed?"
182.434	"Just shake it off; it's all in your head."""
187.19	Can you imagine saying that
187.19	to somebody with a broken leg:
190.091	"""Oh, just walk it off;"
190.091	"it's all in your leg."""
192.907	(Laughter)
195.249	It is time we closed the gap
198.131	between our physical
198.131	and our psychological health.
201.243	It's time we made them more equal,
204.385	more like twins.
207.148	Speaking of which,
207.148	my brother is also a psychologist.
210.945	So he's not a real doctor, either.
213.4	(Laughter)
215.708	We didn't study together, though.
217.704	In fact, the hardest thing
217.704	I've ever done in my life
222.119	is move across the Atlantic
222.119	to New York City
224.889	to get my doctorate in psychology.
227.698	We were apart then
227.698	for the first time in our lives,
230.685	and the separation was brutal
230.685	for both of us.
234.295	But while he remained
234.295	among family and friends,
237.566	I was alone in a new country.
240.251	We missed each other terribly,
241.995	but international phone calls
241.995	were really expensive then,
245.172	and we could only afford to speak
245.172	for five minutes a week.
250.459	When our birthday rolled around,
252.009	it was the first
252.009	we wouldn't be spending together.
254.585	We decided to splurge,
255.938	and that week,
255.938	we would talk for 10 minutes.
258.128	(Laughter)
259.445	I spent the morning pacing around my room,
259.445	waiting for him to call --
264.154	and waiting ...
266.103	and waiting.
267.817	But the phone didn't ring.
270.125	Given the time difference, I assumed,
272.167	"""OK, he's out with friends,"
272.167	"he'll call later."""
274.489	There were no cell phones then.
276.805	But he didn't.
279.171	And I began to realize
279.171	that after being away for over 10 months,
284.253	he no longer missed me
284.253	the way I missed him.
288.028	I knew he would call in the morning,
290.555	but that night was one of the saddest
290.555	and longest nights of my life.
296.717	I woke up the next morning.
298.688	I glanced down at the phone,
300.359	and I realized
300.359	I had kicked it off the hook
303.137	when pacing the day before.
306.612	I stumbled out of bed,
308.287	I put the phone back on the receiver,
308.287	and it rang a second later.
311.764	And it was my brother,
313.448	and boy, was he pissed.
315.14	(Laughter)
317.368	It was the saddest and longest
317.368	night of his life as well.
321.126	Now, I tried to explain
321.126	what happened, but he said,
323.561	"""I don't understand."
324.804	If you saw I wasn't calling you,
326.743	why didn't you just pick up
326.743	"the phone and call me?"""
331.057	He was right.
332.841	Why didn't I call him?
335.187	I didn't have an answer then.
337.608	But I do today,
339.083	and it's a simple one:
341.688	loneliness.
343.948	Loneliness creates a deep
343.948	psychological wound,
348.021	one that distorts our perceptions
348.021	and scrambles our thinking.
352.228	It makes us believe that those around us
352.228	care much less than they actually do.
358.034	It make us really afraid to reach out,
360.352	because why set yourself up
360.352	for rejection and heartache
364.466	when your heart is already aching
364.466	more than you can stand?
368.432	I was in the grips
368.432	of real loneliness back then,
371.539	but I was surrounded by people all day,
371.539	so it never occurred to me.
376.273	But loneliness is defined
376.273	purely subjectively.
380.415	It depends solely on whether you feel
380.415	emotionally or socially disconnected
386.203	from those around you.
387.385	And I did.
389.249	There is a lot of research on loneliness,
389.249	and all of it is horrifying.
395.499	Loneliness won't just make you miserable;
398.307	it will kill you.
399.79	I'm not kidding.
400.984	Chronic loneliness increases
400.984	your likelihood of an early death
404.599	by 14 percent.
406.902	Fourteen percent!
408.78	Loneliness causes high blood pressure,
411.619	high cholesterol.
412.808	It even suppress the functioning
412.808	of your immune system,
416.557	making you vulnerable to all kinds
416.557	of illnesses and diseases.
420.613	In fact, scientists have concluded
420.613	that taken together,
424.175	chronic loneliness
424.175	poses as significant a risk
427.855	for your long-term health and longevity
430.648	as cigarette smoking.
432.464	Now, cigarette packs come with warnings
432.464	"saying, ""This could kill you."""
437.033	But loneliness doesn't.
439.405	And that's why it's so important
441.284	that we prioritize
441.284	our psychological health,
444.371	that we practice emotional hygiene.
447.525	Because you can't treat
447.525	a psychological wound
450.382	if you don't even know you're injured.
454.076	Loneliness isn't the only
454.076	psychological wound
456.944	that distorts our perceptions
456.944	and misleads us.
460.54	Failure does that as well.
463.818	I once visited a day care center,
466.105	where I saw three toddlers
466.105	play with identical plastic toys.
471.14	You had to slide the red button,
471.14	and a cute doggie would pop out.
475.817	One little girl tried pulling
475.817	the purple button, then pushing it,
480.412	and then she just sat back
480.412	and looked at the box
483.23	with her lower lip trembling.
485.029	The little boy next to her
485.029	watched this happen,
488.104	then turned to his box and burst
488.104	into tears without even touching it.
493.141	Meanwhile, another little girl
493.141	tried everything she could think of
496.607	until she slid the red button,
498.415	the cute doggie popped out,
498.415	and she squealed with delight.
502.421	So: three toddlers
502.421	with identical plastic toys,
506.233	but with very different
506.233	reactions to failure.
509.893	The first two toddlers were perfectly
509.893	capable of sliding a red button.
514.455	The only thing that prevented
514.455	them from succeeding
517.59	was that their mind tricked them
517.59	into believing they could not.
521.92	Now, adults get tricked this way
521.92	as well, all the time.
526.028	In fact, we all have a default set
526.028	of feelings and beliefs
531.205	that gets triggered whenever
531.205	we encounter frustrations and setbacks.
535.324	Are you aware of how
535.324	your mind reacts to failure?
538.783	You need to be.
540.033	Because if your mind tries to convince you
540.033	you're incapable of something,
544.43	and you believe it,
545.963	then like those two toddlers,
545.963	you'll begin to feel helpless
549.261	and you'll stop trying too soon,
549.261	or you won't even try at all.
552.859	And then you'll be even more
552.859	convinced you can't succeed.
555.967	You see, that's why so many people
555.967	function below their actual potential.
560.951	Because somewhere along the way,
560.951	sometimes a single failure
564.259	convinced them that they couldn't
564.259	succeed, and they believed it.
568.9	Once we become convinced of something,
568.9	it's very difficult to change our mind.
573.831	I learned that lesson the hard way
573.831	when I was a teenager with my brother.
578.031	We were driving with friends
578.031	down a dark road at night,
581.39	when a police car stopped us.
583.094	There had been a robbery in the area
583.094	and they were looking for suspects.
586.681	The officer approached the car,
586.681	and shined his flashlight on the driver,
590.839	then on my brother in the front seat,
593.285	and then on me.
594.475	And his eyes opened wide and he said,
597.283	"""Where have I seen your face before?"""
599.148	(Laughter)
602.075	And I said,
603.683	"""In the front seat."""
605.382	(Laughter)
608.405	But that made no sense to him whatsoever,
610.549	so now he thought I was on drugs.
612.512	(Laughter)
614.096	So he drags me out of the car,
614.096	he searches me,
616.691	he marches me over to the police car,
618.542	and only when he verified
618.542	I didn't have a police record,
622.066	could I show him
622.066	I had a twin in the front seat.
626.417	But even as we were driving away,
628.213	you could see by the look
628.213	on his face he was convinced
631.225	that I was getting away with something.
633.293	(Laughter)
635.293	Our mind is hard to change
635.293	once we become convinced.
638.669	So it might be very natural
638.669	to feel demoralized
642.133	and defeated after you fail.
643.844	But you cannot allow yourself
643.844	to become convinced you can't succeed.
648.242	You have to fight
648.242	feelings of helplessness.
651.114	You have to gain control
651.114	over the situation.
654.393	And you have to break
654.393	this kind of negative cycle
657.009	before it begins.
658.252	[Stop Emotional Bleeding]
660.191	Our minds and our feelings --
662.626	they're not the trustworthy friends
662.626	we thought they were.
665.991	They're more like a really moody friend,
668.857	who can be totally supportive one minute,
668.857	and really unpleasant the next.
674.175	I once worked with this woman
674.175	who, after 20 years marriage
677.882	and an extremely ugly divorce,
680.311	was finally ready for her first date.
682.572	She had met this guy online,
684.619	and he seemed nice
684.619	and he seemed successful,
687.073	and most importantly,
687.073	he seemed really into her.
690.629	So she was very excited,
690.629	she bought a new dress,
693.411	and they met at an upscale
693.411	New York City bar for a drink.
697.667	Ten minutes into the date,
697.667	the man stands up and says,
701.471	"""I'm not interested,"" and walks out."
705.798	Rejection is extremely painful.
709.5	The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.
712.037	All she could do was call a friend.
714.198	Here's what the friend said:
714.198	"""Well, what do you expect?"
718.816	You have big hips,
718.816	you have nothing interesting to say.
722.493	Why would a handsome,
722.493	successful man like that
725.051	"ever go out with a loser like you?"""
729.092	Shocking, right, that a friend
729.092	could be so cruel?
732.531	But it would be much less shocking
735.157	if I told you it wasn't
735.157	the friend who said that.
737.957	It's what the woman said to herself.
740.893	And that's something we all do,
743.334	especially after a rejection.
745.251	We all start thinking of all our faults
745.251	and all our shortcomings,
748.72	what we wish we were,
748.72	what we wish we weren't.
750.91	We call ourselves names.
752.289	Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.
755.274	And it's interesting that we do,
756.92	because our self-esteem
756.92	is already hurting.
760.189	Why would we want to go
760.189	and damage it even further?
763.236	We wouldn't make a physical injury
763.236	worse on purpose.
765.882	You wouldn't get a cut on your arm
765.882	"and decide, ""Oh! I know --"
768.808	I'm going to take a knife and see
768.808	"how much deeper I can make it."""
772.368	But we do that with psychological
772.368	injuries all the time.
775.973	Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.
779.442	Because we don't prioritize
779.442	our psychological health.
782.862	We know from dozens of studies
782.862	that when your self-esteem is lower,
786.446	you are more vulnerable
786.446	to stress and to anxiety;
789.931	that failures and rejections hurt more,
792.629	and it takes longer to recover from them.
795.507	So when you get rejected,
795.507	the first thing you should be doing
798.783	is to revive your self-esteem,
800.868	not join Fight Club
800.868	and beat it into a pulp.
805.18	When you're in emotional pain,
807.459	treat yourself with the same compassion
810.521	you would expect from a truly good friend.
813.361	[Protect Your Self-Esteem]
815.273	We have to catch our unhealthy
815.273	psychological habits and change them.
819.598	And one of unhealthiest and most common
819.598	is called rumination.
824.228	To ruminate means to chew over.
826.752	It's when your boss yells at you
828.965	or your professor
828.965	makes you feel stupid in class,
831.61	or you have big fight with a friend
833.883	and you just can't stop replaying
833.883	the scene in your head for days,
837.968	sometimes for weeks on end.
840.494	Now, ruminating about upsetting events
840.494	in this way can easily become a habit,
845.517	and it's a very costly one,
847.431	because by spending so much time focused
847.431	on upsetting and negative thoughts,
852.175	you are actually putting yourself
852.175	at significant risk
855.148	for developing clinical depression,
857.37	alcoholism,
858.66	eating disorders,
859.846	and even cardiovascular disease.
862.682	The problem is,
863.898	the urge to ruminate can feel
863.898	really strong and really important,
867.863	so it's a difficult habit to stop.
870.804	I know this for a fact,
872.451	because a little over a year ago,
872.451	I developed the habit myself.
876.54	You see, my twin brother was diagnosed
876.54	with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
882.965	His cancer was extremely aggressive.
885.133	He had visible tumors all over his body.
888.904	And he had to start a harsh course
888.904	of chemotherapy.
893.627	And I couldn't stop thinking
893.627	about what he was going through.
898.586	I couldn't stop thinking
898.586	about how much he was suffering,
902.322	even though he never complained, not once.
906.07	He had this incredibly positive attitude.
909.021	His psychological health was amazing.
912.212	I was physically healthy,
912.212	but psychologically, I was a mess.
917.303	But I knew what to do.
918.568	Studies tell us that even a two-minute
918.568	distraction is sufficient
923.243	to break the urge to ruminate
923.243	in that moment.
926.11	And so each time I had a worrying,
926.11	upsetting, negative thought,
929.782	I forced myself to concentrate
929.782	on something else until the urge passed.
934.161	And within one week,
934.161	my whole outlook changed
938.65	and became more positive and more hopeful.
941.509	[Battle Negative Thinking]
943.267	Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,
943.267	my brother had a CAT scan,
948.167	and I was by his side
948.167	when he got the results.
951.125	All the tumors were gone.
954.297	He still had three more rounds
954.297	of chemotherapy to go,
957.295	but we knew he would recover.
959.659	This picture was taken two weeks ago.
965.807	By taking action when you're lonely,
968.978	by changing your responses to failure,
972.225	by protecting your self-esteem,
974.645	by battling negative thinking,
976.951	you won't just heal
976.951	your psychological wounds,
980.204	you will build emotional resilience,
982.787	you will thrive.
984.664	A hundred years ago, people began
984.664	practicing personal hygiene,
989.267	and life expectancy rates
989.267	rose by over 50 percent
993.542	in just a matter of decades.
995.947	I believe our quality of life
995.947	could rise just as dramatically
1000.06	if we all began practicing
1000.06	emotional hygiene.
1004.194	Can you imagine
1004.194	what the world would be like
1006.281	if everyone was psychologically healthier?
1008.841	If there were less loneliness
1008.841	and less depression?
1012.24	If people knew how to overcome failure?
1015.224	If they felt better about themselves
1015.224	and more empowered?
1018.513	If they were happier and more fulfilled?
1021.76	I can, because that's the world
1021.76	I want to live in.
1026.021	And that's the world
1026.021	my brother wants to live in as well.
1030.371	And if you just become informed
1030.371	and change a few simple habits, well --
1036.001	that's the world we can all live in.
1039.373	Thank you very much.
