12.9	When I turned 19, I started my career
15.555	as the first female photojournalist
17.985	in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.
21.18	My work as a woman photographer
23.294	was considered a serious insult
25.398	to local traditions,
27.153	and created a lasting stigma
29.201	for me and my family.
32.01	The male-dominated field made my presence
35.022	unwelcome by all possible means.
38.092	They made clear that a woman
39.81	must not do a man's job.
42.407	Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me
44.747	because of my gender.
47.21	"The ""No"" sign was pretty clear."
49.933	Three of my colleagues
51.304	went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area
56.18	where the explosion sounds
58.156	were the only thing I could hear.
60.451	Dust was flying in the air,
62.566	and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.
66.525	I only realized we weren't
66.525	there to document the event
69.878	when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep
72.848	and drove away, waving and laughing,
75.502	leaving me behind in the open air strike zone.
80.351	For a moment, I felt terrified,
83.388	humiliated, and sorry for myself.
87.623	My colleagues' action was not
89.687	the only death threat I have received,
92.354	but it was the most dangerous one.
96.392	The perception of women's life in Gaza
99.407	is passive.
101.387	Until a recent time, a lot of 
101.387	women were not allowed
104.747	to work or pursue education.
107.717	At times of such doubled war including
110.788	both social restrictions on women
112.97	and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
115.954	women's dark and bright stories were fading away.
119.972	To men, women's stories were seen
122.3	as inconsequential.
124.257	I started paying closer attention
127.329	to women's lives in Gaza.
129.366	Because of my gender, I had access
132.065	to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.
136.643	Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,
139.077	there was a healthy dose
140.862	of laughter and accomplishments.
143.682	In front of a police compound in Gaza City
147.201	during the first war in Gaza,
150.24	an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound
153.593	and break my nose.
155.74	For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,
160.351	like these lights.
162.848	I thought to myself I either got blind
166.211	or I was in heaven.
169.1	By the time I managed to open my eyes,
172.32	I had documented this moment.
176.531	Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker
178.874	who spent two decades in Israel,
182.043	as his retirement plan,
183.936	he decided to build a four-floor house,
187.266	only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,
191.563	the house was flattened to the ground.
194.995	Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised
198.544	and a jacuzzi, a bathtub
201.709	that he got from Tel Aviv.
203.953	Mohammed got the bathtub
205.75	on the top of the rubble
207.516	and started giving his kids
210.14	an every morning bubble bath.
214.198	My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,
217.46	but to show the full frame
219.541	of unseen stories of Gazans.
222.748	As a Palestinian female photographer,
226.122	the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life
230.83	has inspired me to overcome the community taboo
234.151	and see a different side of war and its aftermath.
239.318	I became a witness with a choice:
243.39	to run away or stand still.
247.17	Thank you.
249.408	(Applause)
