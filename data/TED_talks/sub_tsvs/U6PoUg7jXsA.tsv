16.299	I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
21.323	Imagine yourself standing
21.323	outside the front door of your home.
27.239	I'd like you to notice
27.239	the color of the door,
30.052	the material that it's made out of.
34.501	Now visualize a pack
34.501	of overweight nudists on bicycles.
40.32	(Laughter)
41.775	They are competing
41.775	in a naked bicycle race,
44.473	and they are headed straight
44.473	for your front door.
47.718	I need you to actually see this.
49.583	They are pedaling
49.583	really hard, they're sweaty,
53.344	they're bouncing around a lot.
56.519	And they crash straight
56.519	into the front door of your home.
60.778	Bicycles fly everywhere,
60.778	wheels roll past you,
64.031	spokes end up in awkward places.
67.826	Step over the threshold of your door
67.826	into your foyer, your hallway,
72.159	whatever's on the other side,
73.762	and appreciate the quality of the light.
77.514	The light is shining
77.514	down on Cookie Monster.
84.097	Cookie Monster is waving at you
84.097	from his perch on top of a tan horse.
88.756	It's a talking horse.
90.564	You can practically feel
90.564	his blue fur tickling your nose.
95.404	You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie
95.404	that he's about to shovel into his mouth.
99.374	Walk past him.
101	Walk past him into your living room.
103.498	In your living room,
103.498	in full imaginative broadband,
106.601	picture Britney Spears.
109.633	She is scantily clad, she's dancing
109.633	on your coffee table,
114.756	and she's singing
114.756	"""Hit Me Baby One More Time."""
117.621	And then, follow me into your kitchen.
120.351	In your kitchen, the floor has been
120.351	paved over with a yellow brick road,
124.645	and out of your oven are coming
124.645	towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,
130.052	the Scarecrow and the Lion
130.052	"from ""The Wizard of Oz,"""
132.997	hand-in-hand, skipping
132.997	straight towards you.
135.26	Okay. Open your eyes.
140.346	I want to tell you
140.346	about a very bizarre contest
143.473	that is held every spring
143.473	in New York City.
146.735	It's called the United States
146.735	Memory Championship.
149.782	And I had gone to cover
149.782	this contest a few years back
152.52	as a science journalist,
154.409	expecting, I guess, that this was going
154.409	to be like the Superbowl of savants.
160.648	This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,
163.916	widely varying in both age
163.916	and hygienic upkeep.
168.129	(Laughter)
171.259	They were memorizing
171.259	hundreds of random numbers,
174.619	looking at them just once.
176.031	They were memorizing the names of dozens
176.031	and dozens and dozens of strangers.
181.229	They were memorizing
181.229	entire poems in just a few minutes.
184.411	They were competing
184.411	to see who could memorize
186.664	the order of a shuffled pack
186.664	of playing cards the fastest.
190.149	I was like, this is unbelievable.
192.133	These people must be freaks of nature.
195.664	And I started talking
195.664	to a few of the competitors.
198.578	This is a guy called Ed Cook,
198.578	who had come over from England,
201.942	where he had one
201.942	of the best-trained memories.
204.18	And I said to him,
204.18	"""Ed, when did you realize"
207.784	"that you were a savant?"""
210.07	"And Ed was like, ""I'm not a savant."
212.58	In fact, I have just an average memory.
214.912	Everybody who competes
214.912	in this contest will tell you
217.945	that they have just an average memory.
220.089	We've all trained ourselves to perform
220.089	these utterly miraculous feats of memory
226.982	using a set of ancient techniques,
228.973	techniques invented
228.973	2,500 years ago in Greece,
231.795	the same techniques that Cicero
231.795	had used to memorize his speeches,
236.787	that medieval scholars had used
236.787	"to memorize entire books."""
241.33	"And I said, ""Whoa. How come"
241.33	"I never heard of this before?"""
245.465	And we were standing
245.465	outside the competition hall,
247.925	and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant,
247.925	but somewhat eccentric English guy,
254.315	"says to me, ""Josh, you're"
254.315	an American journalist.
258.806	"Do you know Britney Spears?"""
261.283	"I'm like, ""What? No. Why?"""
266.023	"""Because I really want"
266.023	to teach Britney Spears
268.477	how to memorize the order
268.477	of a shuffled pack of playing cards
271.381	on U.S. national television.
273.191	It will prove to the world
273.191	"that anybody can do this."""
276.294	(Laughter)
281.523	"I was like, ""Well, I'm not Britney Spears,"
285	but maybe you could teach me.
287.715	I mean, you've got to start
287.715	"somewhere, right?"""
290	And that was the beginning
290	of a very strange journey for me.
294.005	I ended up spending
294.005	the better part of the next year
296.973	not only training my memory,
298.791	but also investigating it,
300.751	trying to understand how it works,
302.759	why it sometimes doesn't work,
304.762	and what its potential might be.
307.436	And I met a host
307.436	of really interesting people.
309.653	This is a guy called E.P.
311.547	He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,
313.843	the worst memory in the world.
316.552	His memory was so bad,
318.345	that he didn't even remember
318.345	he had a memory problem,
321.29	which is amazing.
322.848	And he was this incredibly tragic figure,
324.826	but he was a window into the extent
324.826	to which our memories make us who we are.
331.306	At the other end
331.306	of the spectrum, I met this guy.
333.957	This is Kim Peek, he was the basis
333.957	for Dustin Hoffman's character
337.608	"in the movie ""Rain Man."""
339.282	We spent an afternoon together
339.282	in the Salt Lake City Public Library
343.472	memorizing phone books,
345.627	which was scintillating.
348.23	(Laughter)
350.987	And I went back and I read
350.987	a whole host of memory treatises,
355.169	treatises written 2,000-plus
355.169	years ago in Latin,
359.581	in antiquity, and then later,
359.581	in the Middle Ages.
362.716	And I learned a whole bunch
362.716	of really interesting stuff.
365.93	One of the really interesting
365.93	things that I learned
368.5	is that once upon a time,
370.774	this idea of having a trained,
370.774	disciplined, cultivated memory
377.066	was not nearly so alien
377.066	as it would seem to us to be today.
382.042	Once upon a time,
382.042	people invested in their memories,
386.331	in laboriously furnishing their minds.
391.976	Over the last few millenia,
393.479	we've invented a series of technologies --
396.225	from the alphabet, to the scroll,
398.635	to the codex, the printing
398.635	press, photography,
400.954	the computer, the smartphone --
403.245	that have made it progressively
403.245	easier and easier
405.8	for us to externalize our memories,
408.63	for us to essentially outsource
408.63	this fundamental human capacity.
414.997	These technologies have made
414.997	our modern world possible,
418.276	but they've also changed us.
420.307	They've changed us culturally,
422.018	and I would argue that they've
422.018	changed us cognitively.
425.176	Having little need to remember anymore,
427.906	it sometimes seems
427.906	like we've forgotten how.
430.994	One of the last places on Earth
430.994	where you still find
433.573	people passionate about this idea of
433.573	a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,
438.99	is at this totally singular
438.99	memory contest.
441.637	It's actually not that singular,
443.305	there are contests held
443.305	all over the world.
445.35	And I was fascinated,
445.35	I wanted to know how do these guys do it.
450.264	A few years back a group of researchers
450.264	at University College London
454.319	brought a bunch of memory
454.319	champions into the lab.
457.069	They wanted to know:
458.349	Do these guys have brains
458.349	that are somehow structurally,
461.308	anatomically different
461.308	from the rest of ours?
464.506	The answer was no.
467.821	Are they smarter than the rest of us?
470.567	They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests,
470.567	and the answer was: not really.
474.329	There was, however, one really
474.329	interesting and telling difference
477.575	between the brains of the memory champions
479.683	and the control subjects
479.683	that they were comparing them to.
482.942	When they put these guys
482.942	in an fMRI machine,
485.959	scanned their brains
485.959	while they were memorizing numbers
489.32	and people's faces
489.32	and pictures of snowflakes,
491.977	they found that the memory champions were
491.977	lighting up different parts of the brain
496.857	than everyone else.
498.548	Of note, they were using,
498.548	or they seemed to be using,
501.833	a part of the brain that's involved
501.833	in spatial memory and navigation.
506.79	Why?
507.973	And is there something
507.973	that the rest of us can learn from this?
513.107	The sport of competitive memorizing
513.107	is driven by a kind of arms race where,
519.83	every year, somebody comes up with a new
519.83	way to remember more stuff more quickly,
524.913	and then the rest of the field
524.913	has to play catch-up.
527.389	This is my friend Ben Pridmore,
529.032	three-time world memory champion.
531.198	On his desk in front of him
531.198	are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards
536.38	that he is about to try
536.38	to memorize in one hour,
539.468	using a technique that he invented
539.468	and he alone has mastered.
543.547	He used a similar technique
546.292	to memorize the precise order
546.292	of 4,140 random binary digits
553.114	in half an hour.
555.189	(Laughter)
556.737	Yeah.
558.833	And while there are a whole host of ways
561.683	of remembering stuff
561.683	in these competitions,
565.718	everything, all of the techniques
565.718	that are being used,
568.4	ultimately come down to a concept
570.76	that psychologists refer to
570.76	"as ""elaborative encoding."""
574.577	And it's well-illustrated
574.577	by a nifty paradox
577.089	known as the Baker/baker paradox,
577.089	which goes like this:
580.697	If I tell two people
580.697	to remember the same word,
583.593	if I say to you,
585.16	"""Remember that"
585.16	"there is a guy named Baker."""
588.787	That's his name.
590.293	"And I say to you, ""Remember"
590.293	"that there is a guy who is a baker."""
595.081	Okay?
596.714	And I come back to you
596.714	at some point later on,
599.92	"and I say, ""Do you remember that word"
599.92	that I told you a while back?
603.639	"Do you remember what it was?"""
605.535	The person who was told his name is Baker
608.802	is less likely to remember the same word
611.887	than the person was told
611.887	his job is a baker.
615.498	Same word, different amount
615.498	of remembering; that's weird.
618.609	What's going on here?
620.276	Well, the name Baker
620.276	doesn't actually mean anything to you.
625.294	It is entirely untethered
625.294	from all of the other memories
629.531	floating around in your skull.
631.046	"But the common noun ""baker"" --"
631.046	we know bakers.
634.558	Bakers wear funny white hats.
636.383	Bakers have flour on their hands.
638.01	Bakers smell good
638.01	when they come home from work.
640.61	Maybe we even know a baker.
642.349	And when we first hear that word,
644.102	we start putting these
644.102	associational hooks into it,
646.642	that make it easier to fish it
646.642	back out at some later date.
651.101	The entire art of what is going on
651.101	in these memory contests,
655.612	and the entire art of remembering
655.612	stuff better in everyday life,
659.448	is figuring out ways
659.448	to transform capital B Bakers
663.233	into lower-case B bakers --
665.122	to take information
665.122	that is lacking in context,
668.434	in significance, in meaning,
670.514	and transform it in some way,
672.064	so that it becomes meaningful
672.064	in the light of all the other things
676.286	that you have in your mind.
679.88	One of the more elaborate
679.88	techniques for doing this
683.147	dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.
686.84	It came to be known as the memory palace.
689.228	The story behind its creation
689.228	goes like this:
692.687	There was a poet called Simonides,
692.687	who was attending a banquet.
697.118	He was actually the hired entertainment,
699.206	because back then, if you wanted
699.206	to throw a really slamming party,
702.326	you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.
705.497	And he stands up, delivers his poem
705.497	from memory, walks out the door,
710.956	and at the moment he does,
713.084	the banquet hall collapses.
716.155	Kills everybody inside.
719.013	It doesn't just kill everybody,
720.959	it mangles the bodies
720.959	beyond all recognition.
725.053	Nobody can say who was inside,
727.426	nobody can say where they were sitting.
730.014	The bodies can't be properly buried.
732.253	It's one tragedy compounding another.
736.873	Simonides, standing outside,
738.8	the sole survivor amid the wreckage,
740.931	closes his eyes and has this realization,
745.348	which is that in his mind's eye,
747.313	he can see where each of the guests
747.313	at the banquet had been sitting.
752.71	And he takes the relatives by the hand,
754.846	and guides them each
754.846	to their loved ones amid the wreckage.
759.258	What Simonides figured out at that moment,
762.28	is something that I think
762.28	we all kind of intuitively know,
765.503	which is that, as bad as we are
765.503	at remembering names and phone numbers,
770.654	and word-for-word instructions
770.654	from our colleagues,
773.677	we have really exceptional
773.677	visual and spatial memories.
779.12	If I asked you to recount
779.12	the first 10 words of the story
782.867	that I just told you about Simonides,
785.493	chances are you would have
785.493	a tough time with it.
788.087	But, I would wager
788.087	that if I asked you to recall
792.53	who is sitting on top
792.53	of a talking tan horse
797.251	in your foyer right now,
799.291	you would be able to see that.
801.758	The idea behind the memory palace
803.958	is to create this imagined edifice
803.958	in your mind's eye,
808.545	and populate it with images
808.545	of the things that you want to remember --
812.632	the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,
815.901	funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,
819.772	the more unforgettable it's likely to be.
822.439	This is advice that goes
822.439	back 2,000-plus years
825.209	to the earliest Latin memory treatises.
827.766	So how does this work?
829.733	Let's say that you've been invited
829.733	to TED center stage to give a speech,
836.54	and you want to do it from memory,
839.202	and you want to do it the way
839.202	that Cicero would have done it,
843.81	if he had been invited
843.81	to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
847.722	(Laughter)
848.944	What you might do
850.739	is picture yourself
850.739	at the front door of your house.
856.344	And you'd come up with some sort
856.344	of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,
861.593	to remind you that the first thing
861.593	you want to talk about
864.385	is this totally bizarre contest.
866.667	(Laughter)
867.825	And then you'd go inside your house,
869.814	and you would see an image
869.814	of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.
874.553	And that would remind you
875.822	that you would want to then
875.822	introduce your friend Ed Cook.
879.193	And then you'd see
879.193	an image of Britney Spears
881.66	to remind you of this funny
881.66	anecdote you want to tell.
884.472	And you'd go into your kitchen,
886.001	and the fourth topic
886.001	you were going to talk about
888.357	was this strange journey
888.357	that you went on for a year,
890.927	and you'd have some friends
890.927	to help you remember that.
896.308	This is how Roman orators
896.308	memorized their speeches --
900.11	not word-for-word, which is just
900.11	going to screw you up,
903.431	but topic-for-topic.
906.137	"In fact, the phrase ""topic sentence"" --"
909.993	"that comes from the Greek word ""topos,"""
912.462	"which means ""place."""
913.843	That's a vestige of when people used
913.843	to think about oratory and rhetoric
918.054	in these sorts of spatial terms.
919.968	"The phrase ""in the first place,"""
922.298	"that's like ""in the first place"
922.298	"of your memory palace."""
925.871	I thought this was just fascinating,
927.617	and I got really into it.
929.174	And I went to a few more
929.174	of these memory contests,
931.956	and I had this notion
931.956	that I might write something longer
934.695	about this subculture
934.695	of competitive memorizers.
938.02	But there was a problem.
939.837	The problem was that a memory contest
942.909	is a pathologically boring event.
946.165	(Laughter)
949.348	Truly, it is like a bunch of people
949.348	sitting around taking the SATs --
953.893	I mean, the most dramatic it gets
955.624	is when somebody
955.624	starts massaging their temples.
957.957	And I'm a journalist,
957.957	I need something to write about.
960.528	I know that there's incredible stuff
960.528	happening in these people's minds,
963.98	but I don't have access to it.
965.749	And I realized, if I was going
965.749	to tell this story,
968.924	I needed to walk
968.924	in their shoes a little bit.
971.742	And so I started trying
971.742	to spend 15 or 20 minutes
974.857	every morning, before I sat
974.857	down with my New York Times,
977.619	just trying to remember something.
980.189	Maybe it was a poem,
981.814	maybe it was names from an old yearbook
981.814	that I bought at a flea market.
986.504	And I found that this was shockingly fun.
991.999	I never would have expected that.
993.912	It was fun because this is actually
993.912	not about training your memory.
997.159	What you're doing, is you're trying
997.159	to get better and better
1000.179	at creating, at dreaming up,
1002.235	these utterly ludicrous,
1002.235	raunchy, hilarious,
1005.645	and hopefully unforgettable
1005.645	images in your mind's eye.
1009.254	And I got pretty into it.
1010.837	This is me wearing my standard
1010.837	competitive memorizer's training kit.
1016.798	(Laughter)
1018.035	It's a pair of earmuffs
1019.46	and a set of safety goggles
1019.46	that have been masked over
1023.436	except for two small pinholes,
1025.542	because distraction is the competitive
1025.542	memorizer's greatest enemy.
1031.944	I ended up coming back
1031.944	to that same contest
1034.933	that I had covered a year earlier,
1036.798	and I had this notion
1036.798	that I might enter it,
1038.948	sort of as an experiment
1038.948	in participatory journalism.
1042.797	It'd make, I thought, maybe
1042.797	a nice epilogue to all my research.
1046.365	Problem was, the experiment went haywire.
1050.508	I won the contest --
1051.707	(Laughter)
1052.835	which really wasn't supposed to happen.
1055.731	(Applause)
1061.991	Now, it is nice to be able
1061.991	to memorize speeches
1066.523	and phone numbers and shopping lists,
1070.646	but it's actually kind
1070.646	of beside the point.
1073.162	These are just tricks.
1075.006	They work because they're based
1075.006	on some pretty basic principles
1079.776	about how our brains work.
1082.063	And you don't have to be
1082.063	building memory palaces
1085.504	or memorizing packs of playing cards
1087.766	to benefit from a little bit of insight
1087.766	about how your mind works.
1092.167	We often talk about people
1092.167	with great memories
1094.382	as though it were some sort
1094.382	of an innate gift,
1096.555	but that is not the case.
1098.865	Great memories are learned.
1102.095	At the most basic level,
1102.095	we remember when we pay attention.
1106.021	We remember when we are deeply engaged.
1108.719	We remember when we are able to take
1108.719	a piece of information and experience,
1112.885	and figure out why it is meaningful to us,
1114.991	why it is significant, why it's colorful,
1117.429	when we're able to transform it
1117.429	in some way that makes sense
1121.417	in the light of all of the other
1121.417	things floating around in our minds,
1124.781	when we're able to transform
1124.781	Bakers into bakers.
1130.376	The memory palace,
1130.376	these memory techniques --
1132.543	they're just shortcuts.
1133.979	In fact, they're not
1133.979	even really shortcuts.
1136.944	They work because they make you work.
1140.277	They force a kind of depth of processing,
1143.543	a kind of mindfulness,
1145.064	that most of us don't normally
1145.064	walk around exercising.
1149.754	But there actually are no shortcuts.
1152.508	This is how stuff is made memorable.
1155.365	And I think if there's one thing
1155.365	that I want to leave you with,
1159.015	it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't
1159.015	even remember he had a memory problem,
1165.567	left me with,
1166.788	which is the notion that our lives
1166.788	are the sum of our memories.
1174.123	How much are we willing to lose
1180.113	from our already short lives,
1183.786	by losing ourselves
1183.786	in our Blackberries, our iPhones,
1189.382	by not paying attention
1189.382	to the human being across from us
1194.268	who is talking with us,
1195.843	by being so lazy that we're not
1195.843	willing to process deeply?
1202.723	I learned firsthand
1204.467	that there are incredible
1204.467	memory capacities
1207.96	latent in all of us.
1210.619	But if you want to live a memorable life,
1213.466	you have to be the kind of person
1215.799	who remembers to remember.
1218.196	Thank you.
1219.372	(Applause)
