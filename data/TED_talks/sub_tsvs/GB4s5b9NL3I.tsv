13.2	Democracy.
14.96	In the West,
16.32	we make a colossal mistake
16.32	taking it for granted.
20.28	We see democracy
21.6	not as the most fragile
21.6	of flowers that it really is,
26.12	but we see it as part
26.12	of our society's furniture.
29.96	We tend to think of it
29.96	as an intransigent given.
34.68	We mistakenly believe that capitalism
34.68	begets inevitably democracy.
39.92	It doesn't.
41.28	Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew
41.28	and his great imitators in Beijing
45.68	have demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
48.64	that it is perfectly possible
48.64	to have a flourishing capitalism,
52.56	spectacular growth,
54.96	while politics remains democracy-free.
58.04	Indeed, democracy is receding
58.04	in our neck of the woods,
62.48	here in Europe.
64.08	Earlier this year,
64.08	while I was representing Greece --
67.48	the newly elected Greek government --
70.24	in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister,
72.96	I was told in no uncertain terms
72.96	that our nation's democratic process --
77.92	our elections --
79.36	could not be allowed to interfere
81.16	with economic policies
81.16	that were being implemented in Greece.
85.12	At that moment,
86.36	I felt that there could be no greater
86.36	vindication of Lee Kuan Yew,
90.68	or the Chinese Communist Party,
92.24	indeed of some recalcitrant
92.24	friends of mine who kept telling me
96	that democracy would be banned
96	if it ever threatened to change anything.
101.64	Tonight, here, I want to present to you
104.92	an economic case
104.92	for an authentic democracy.
108.6	I want to ask you
108.6	to join me in believing again
113.48	that Lee Kuan Yew,
116.48	the Chinese Communist Party
117.88	and indeed the Eurogroup
119.28	are wrong in believing
119.28	that we can dispense with democracy --
123.6	that we need an authentic,
123.6	boisterous democracy.
127.36	And without democracy,
130.36	our societies will be nastier,
133.24	our future bleak
135.4	and our great, new technologies wasted.
138.24	Speaking of waste,
139.52	allow me to point out
139.52	an interesting paradox
142.32	that is threatening
142.32	our economies as we speak.
145.12	I call it the twin peaks paradox.
147.44	One peak you understand --
148.76	you know it, you recognize it --
150.4	is the mountain of debts
150.4	that has been casting a long shadow
155.48	over the United States,
155.48	Europe, the whole world.
158.32	We all recognize the mountain of debts.
160.88	But few people discern its twin.
165.64	A mountain of idle cash
168.84	belonging to rich savers
168.84	and to corporations,
173.12	too terrified to invest it
175.72	into the productive activities
175.72	that can generate the incomes
179.04	from which you can extinguish
179.04	the mountain of debts
182.12	and which can produce all those things
182.12	that humanity desperately needs,
186.12	like green energy.
187.8	Now let me give you two numbers.
190.16	Over the last three months,
191.52	in the United States,
191.52	in Britain and in the Eurozone,
194.32	we have invested, collectively,
194.32	3.4 trillion dollars
198.76	on all the wealth-producing goods --
201.44	things like industrial plants, machinery,
204.48	office blocks, schools,
206.72	roads, railways, machinery,
206.72	and so on and so forth.
209.88	$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money
212.64	until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion
216.52	that has been slushing around
216.52	in the same countries,
219.24	in our financial institutions,
221.08	doing absolutely nothing
221.08	during the same period
225.44	except inflating stock exchanges
225.44	and bidding up house prices.
230.32	So a mountain of debt
230.32	and a mountain of idle cash
235.6	form twin peaks, 
235.6	failing to cancel each other out
239.32	through the normal
239.32	operation of the markets.
242.16	The result is stagnant wages,
245.36	more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds
245.36	in America, in Japan and in Europe
251.04	out of work.
252.56	And consequently, low aggregate demand,
254.92	which in a never-ending cycle,
257.16	reinforces the pessimism of the investors,
260.88	who, fearing low demand,
260.88	reproduce it by not investing --
264.72	exactly like Oedipus' father,
267.44	who, terrified
267.44	by the prophecy of the oracle
269.959	that his son would grow up to kill him,
272.72	unwittingly engineered the conditions
274.68	that ensured that Oedipus,
274.68	his son, would kill him.
278.56	This is my quarrel with capitalism.
281.2	Its gross wastefulness,
283.24	all this idle cash,
284.88	should be energized to improve lives,
289	to develop human talents,
290.36	and indeed to finance
290.36	all these technologies,
293.24	green technologies,
294.52	which are absolutely essential
294.52	for saving planet Earth.
298.28	Am I right in believing
298.28	that democracy might be the answer?
301.56	I believe so,
302.8	but before we move on,
304.04	what do we mean by democracy?
306.52	Aristotle defined democracy
308.96	as the constitution
308.96	in which the free and the poor,
313.92	being in the majority, control government.
317	Now, of course Athenian democracy
317	excluded too many.
320.32	Women, migrants and,
320.32	of course, the slaves.
324.04	But it would be a mistake
325.32	to dismiss the significance
325.32	of ancient Athenian democracy
328.92	on the basis of whom it excluded.
331.68	What was more pertinent,
332.96	and continues to be so
332.96	about ancient Athenian democracy,
336.84	was the inclusion of the working poor,
340.36	who not only acquired
340.36	the right to free speech,
345.08	but more importantly, crucially,
347.36	they acquired the rights
347.36	to political judgments
350	that were afforded equal weight
352.4	in the decision-making
352.4	concerning matters of state.
356.08	Now, of course, Athenian
356.08	democracy didn't last long.
359.16	Like a candle that burns brightly,
359.16	it burned out quickly.
363.6	And indeed,
364.84	our liberal democracies today
364.84	do not have their roots in ancient Athens.
369.12	They have their roots in the Magna Carta,
371.48	in the 1688 Glorious Revolution,
374.76	indeed in the American constitution.
377	Whereas Athenian democracy
377	was focusing on the masterless citizen
382.04	and empowering the working poor,
385.24	our liberal democracies are founded
385.24	on the Magna Carta tradition,
389.44	which was, after all,
389.44	a charter for masters.
392.56	And indeed, liberal democracy
392.56	only surfaced when it was possible
396.88	to separate fully the political sphere
396.88	from the economic sphere,
400.76	so as to confine the democratic process
400.76	fully in the political sphere,
405.84	leaving the economic sphere --
407.72	the corporate world, if you want --
409.68	as a democracy-free zone.
413.72	Now, in our democracies today,
416.72	this separation of the economic
416.72	from the political sphere,
420.24	the moment it started happening,
422.52	it gave rise to an inexorable,
422.52	epic struggle between the two,
426.84	with the economic sphere
426.84	colonizing the political sphere,
430.08	eating into its power.
432.48	Have you wondered why politicians
432.48	are not what they used to be?
436.56	It's not because their DNA
436.56	has degenerated.
439	(Laughter)
440.64	It is rather because one can be
440.64	in government today and not in power,
445.28	because power has migrated
445.28	from the political to the economic sphere,
448.6	which is separate.
451.16	Indeed,
452.76	I spoke about my quarrel
452.76	with capitalism.
455.08	If you think about it,
456.84	it is a little bit like
456.84	a population of predators,
461.08	that are so successful in decimating
461.08	the prey that they must feed on,
466.56	that in the end they starve.
468.72	Similarly,
469.96	the economic sphere has been colonizing
469.96	and cannibalizing the political sphere
473.68	to such an extent
473.68	that it is undermining itself,
477.08	causing economic crisis.
478.84	Corporate power is increasing,
480.96	political goods are devaluing,
483.2	inequality is rising,
485.04	aggregate demand is falling
486.64	and CEOs of corporations are too scared
486.64	to invest the cash of their corporations.
493.52	So the more capitalism succeeds
493.52	in taking the demos out of democracy,
500.2	the taller the twin peaks
501.56	and the greater the waste
501.56	of human resources
505.12	and humanity's wealth.
507.64	Clearly, if this is right,
510.52	we must reunite the political
510.52	and economic spheres
513.6	and better do it
513.6	with a demos being in control,
517.12	like in ancient Athens
517.12	except without the slaves
520.08	or the exclusion of women and migrants.
524.12	Now, this is not an original idea.
525.88	The Marxist left
525.88	had that idea 100 years ago
528.679	and it didn't go very well, did it?
530.84	The lesson that we learned
530.84	from the Soviet debacle
534.28	is that only by a miracle
534.28	will the working poor be reempowered,
540.64	as they were in ancient Athens,
542.64	without creating new forms
542.64	of brutality and waste.
546.96	But there is a solution:
548.88	eliminate the working poor.
551.36	Capitalism's doing it
552.64	by replacing low-wage workers
552.64	with automata, androids, robots.
559.08	The problem is
560.32	that as long as the economic
560.32	and the political spheres are separate,
563.56	automation makes the twin peaks taller,
568.64	the waste loftier
570.4	and the social conflicts deeper,
572.48	including --
574.32	soon, I believe --
575.88	in places like China.
578.72	So we need to reconfigure,
581.16	we need to reunite the economic
581.16	and the political spheres,
584.84	but we'd better do it
584.84	by democratizing the reunified sphere,
590.24	lest we end up with
590.24	a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy
595.96	that makes The Matrix, the movie,
595.96	look like a documentary.
600	(Laughter)
601.6	So the question is not
601.6	whether capitalism will survive
605.04	the technological innovations
605.04	it is spawning.
607.96	The more interesting question
609.6	is whether capitalism will be succeeded
609.6	by something resembling a Matrix dystopia
615.36	or something much closer
615.36	to a Star Trek-like society,
619.8	where machines serve the humans
622.2	and the humans expend their energies
622.2	exploring the universe
626.64	and indulging in long debates
626.64	about the meaning of life
630.96	in some ancient, Athenian-like,
630.96	high tech agora.
636.36	I think we can afford to be optimistic.
641.4	But what would it take,
642.72	what would it look like
644.72	to have this Star Trek-like utopia,
644.72	instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
650.24	In practical terms,
651.52	allow me to share just briefly,
653.28	a couple of examples.
655.08	At the level of the enterprise,
656.88	imagine a capital market,
659.24	where you earn capital as you work,
662.88	and where your capital follows you
662.88	from one job to another,
668.24	from one company to another,
669.76	and the company --
671.04	whichever one you happen
671.04	to work at at that time --
674.52	is solely owned by those who happen
674.52	to work in it at that moment.
679.4	Then all income stems
679.4	from capital, from profits,
684.12	and the very concept
684.12	of wage labor becomes obsolete.
688.52	No more separation between those
688.52	who own but do not work in the company
695.16	and those who work
695.16	but do not own the company;
698.44	no more tug-of-war
698.44	between capital and labor;
702.44	no great gap between
702.44	investment and saving;
706.6	indeed, no towering twin peaks.
710.6	At the level of the global
710.6	political economy,
713	imagine for a moment
714.96	that our national currencies
714.96	have a free-floating exchange rate,
719.96	with a universal,
719.96	global, digital currency,
723.76	one that is issued
723.76	by the International Monetary Fund,
727.8	the G-20,
729.04	on behalf of all humanity.
731.6	And imagine further
732.84	that all international trade
732.84	is denominated in this currency --
737.2	"let's call it ""the cosmos,"""
739.04	in units of cosmos --
741.72	with every government agreeing
741.72	to be paying into a common fund
746.12	a sum of cosmos units proportional
746.12	to the country's trade deficit,
751.68	or indeed to a country's trade surplus.
755.72	And imagine that that fund is utilized
755.72	to invest in green technologies,
760.96	especially in parts of the world
760.96	where investment funding is scarce.
766.84	This is not a new idea.
768.44	It's what, effectively,
768.44	John Maynard Keynes proposed
771.8	in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference.
776.08	The problem is
777.32	that back then, they didn't have
777.32	the technology to implement it.
780.64	Now we do,
781.88	especially in the context
781.88	of a reunified political-economic sphere.
788.64	The world that I am describing to you
791.08	is simultaneously libertarian,
793.56	in that it prioritizes
793.56	empowered individuals,
798.16	Marxist,
799.4	since it will have confined
799.4	to the dustbin of history
802.64	the division between capital and labor,
805.12	and Keynesian,
807.32	global Keynesian.
810.32	But above all else,
811.92	it is a world in which we will be able
811.92	to imagine an authentic democracy.
817.76	Will such a world dawn?
820.4	Or shall we descend
820.4	into a Matrix-like dystopia?
824.92	The answer lies in the political choice
824.92	that we shall be making collectively.
829.72	It is our choice,
831.36	and we'd better make it democratically.
834.28	Thank you.
835.56	(Applause)
841.48	Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
843.88	It was you who described yourself
843.88	in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.
850.4	What is the relevance
850.4	of Marx's analysis today?
854	Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was
854	any relevance in what I just said,
857.36	then Marx is relevant.
858.6	Because the whole point of reunifying
858.6	the political and economic is --
862.12	if we don't do it,
863.36	then technological innovation
863.36	is going to create
865.64	such a massive fall in aggregate demand,
867.96	what Larry Summers
867.96	refers to as secular stagnation.
872.76	With this crisis migrating
872.76	from one part of the world,
875.64	as it is now,
877.2	it will destabilize
877.2	not only our democracies,
879.92	but even the emerging world that is not
879.92	that keen on liberal democracy.
884.16	So if this analysis holds water,
884.16	then Marx is absolutely relevant.
888	But so is Hayek,
889.76	that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist,
891.6	and so is Keynes,
892.84	so that's why I'm totally confused.
894.76	(Laughter)
896	BG: Indeed, and possibly we are too, now.
898.08	(Laughter)
899.4	(Applause)
901.4	YV: If you are not confused,
901.4	you are not thinking, OK?
904.2	BG: That's a very, very Greek
904.2	philosopher kind of thing to say --
907.32	YV: That was Einstein, actually --
909	BG: During your talk
909	you mentioned Singapore and China,
911.64	and last night at the speaker dinner,
913.72	you expressed a pretty strong opinion
913.72	about how the West looks at China.
918.92	Would you like to share that?
920.52	YV: Well, there's a great
920.52	degree of hypocrisy.
923.4	In our liberal democracies,
923.4	we have a semblance of democracy.
927.72	It's because we have confined,
927.72	as I was saying in my talk,
930.48	democracy to the political sphere,
932.16	while leaving the one sphere
932.16	where all the action is --
935.64	the economic sphere --
936.88	a completely democracy-free zone.
939.28	In a sense,
940.56	if I am allowed to be provocative,
943.88	China today is closer to Britain
943.88	in the 19th century.
948.32	Because remember,
949.6	we tend to associate
949.6	liberalism with democracy --
951.96	that's a mistake, historically.
953.48	Liberalism, liberal,
953.48	it's like John Stuart Mill.
956.04	John Stuart Mill was particularly
956.04	skeptical about the democratic process.
960.76	So what you are seeing now in China
960.76	is a very similar process
966.16	to the one that we had in Britain
966.16	during the Industrial Revolution,
969.36	especially the transition
969.36	from the first to the second.
972.36	And to be castigating China
975.68	for doing that which the West did
975.68	in the 19th century,
978.84	smacks of hypocrisy.
981.52	BG: I am sure that many people here
981.52	are wondering about your experience
985.2	as the Finance Minister of Greece
985.2	earlier this year.
987.96	YV: I knew this was coming.
989.365	BG: Yes.
990.64	BG: Six months after,
992	how do you look back
992	at the first half of the year?
995.92	YV: Extremely exciting,
995.92	from a personal point of view,
998.56	and very disappointing,
999.84	because we had an opportunity
999.84	to reboot the Eurozone.
1003.76	Not just Greece, the Eurozone.
1005.88	To move away from the complacency
1008.84	and the constant denial
1008.84	that there was a massive --
1011.32	and there is a massive
1011.32	architectural fault line
1014.2	going through the Eurozone,
1016.4	which is threatening, massively,
1016.4	the whole of the European Union process.
1020.84	We had an opportunity
1020.84	on the basis of the Greek program --
1024.04	which by the way,
1025.4	was the first program
1025.4	to manifest that denial --
1029.8	to put it right.
1031.04	And, unfortunately,
1032.28	the powers in the Eurozone,
1034.12	in the Eurogroup,
1036.079	chose to maintain denial.
1038.079	But you know what happens.
1039.359	This is the experience
1039.359	of the Soviet Union.
1041.44	When you try to keep alive
1043.96	an economic system
1043.96	that architecturally cannot survive,
1048.52	through political will
1048.52	and through authoritarianism,
1051.2	you may succeed in prolonging it,
1052.88	but when change happens
1054.48	it happens very abruptly
1054.48	and catastrophically.
1057	BG: What kind of change
1057	are you foreseeing?
1059.031	YV: Well, there's no doubt
1060.309	that if we don't change
1060.309	the architecture of the Eurozone,
1063.001	the Eurozone has no future.
1064.92	BG: Did you make any mistakes
1064.92	when you were Finance Minister?
1067.84	YV: Every day.
1069.08	BG: For example?
1069.08	YV: Anybody who looks back --
1071.64	(Applause)
1076.12	No, but seriously.
1077.52	If there's any Minister of Finance,
1077.52	or of anything else for that matter,
1081.12	who tells you after six months in a job,
1083.36	especially in such a stressful situation,
1087.08	that they have made no mistake,
1087.08	they're dangerous people.
1089.8	Of course I made mistakes.
1091.12	The greatest mistake
1091.12	was to sign the application
1093.96	for the extension of a loan agreement
1096.08	in the end of February.
1097.72	I was imagining
1098.96	that there was a genuine interest
1098.96	on the side of the creditors
1101.96	to find common ground.
1103.24	And there wasn't.
1104.48	They were simply interested
1104.48	in crushing our government,
1107.12	just because they did not want
1108.6	to have to deal with
1108.6	the architectural fault lines
1111.76	that were running through the Eurozone.
1113.8	And because they didn't want to admit
1115.64	that for five years they were implementing
1115.64	a catastrophic program in Greece.
1119.28	We lost one-third of our nominal GDP.
1122.2	This is worse than the Great Depression.
1124.16	And no one has come clean
1125.44	from the troika of lenders
1125.44	that have been imposing this policy
1128.4	"to say, ""This was a colossal mistake."""
1131.4	BG: Despite all this,
1132.64	and despite the aggressiveness
1132.64	of the discussion,
1135	you seem to be remaining
1135	quite pro-European.
1137.44	YV: Absolutely.
1138.68	Look, my criticism
1138.68	of the European Union and the Eurozone
1142.84	comes from a person
1142.84	who lives and breathes Europe.
1147.68	My greatest fear is that
1147.68	the Eurozone will not survive.
1151.28	Because if it doesn't,
1152.76	the centrifugal forces
1152.76	that will be unleashed
1155.64	will be demonic,
1157.36	and they will destroy the European Union.
1159.36	And that will be catastrophic
1159.36	not just for Europe
1161.8	but for the whole global economy.
1163.44	We are probably the largest
1163.44	economy in the world.
1167.56	And if we allow ourselves
1169.32	to fall into a route
1169.32	of the postmodern 1930's,
1172.16	which seems to me to be what we are doing,
1174.84	then that will be detrimental
1176.68	to the future of Europeans
1176.68	and non-Europeans alike.
1180.12	BG: We definitely hope
1180.12	you are wrong on that point.
1182.56	Yanis, thank you for coming to TED.
1184.28	YV: Thank you.
1185.52	(Applause)
