16.26	So I work in marketing, which I love,
18.26	but my first passion was physics,
21.26	a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,
24.26	when I had a little less gray hair.
27.26	So he taught me
29.26	that physics is cool
31.26	because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
33.26	And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you
36.26	that physics can teach us something about marketing.
39.26	So quick show of hands --
41.26	who studied some marketing in university?
43.26	Who studied some physics in university?
45.26	Pretty good. And at school?
47.26	Okay, lots of you.
49.26	So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,
51.26	or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
54.26	So, physics and marketing.
58.26	We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:
60.26	"""The force equals mass times acceleration."""
63.26	This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines
65.26	should have studied a bit more carefully
68.26	before they ran this campaign.
70.26	(Laughter)
73.26	But if we rearrange this formula quickly,
76.26	we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,
79.26	which means
81.26	that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --
84.26	it requires more force to change its direction.
88.26	It's the same with brands:
90.26	the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,
93.26	the more force is needed to change its positioning.
96.26	And that's one of the reasons why
98.26	Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture
101.26	rather than try to persuade the world
103.26	that Andersen's could stand for something
105.26	other than accountancy.
107.26	It explains why Hoover
109.26	found it very difficult to persuade the world
111.26	that it was more than vacuum cleaners,
113.26	and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G
116.26	keep brands separate,
118.26	like Ariel and Pringles and Dove
121.26	rather than having one giant parent brand.
125.26	So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object
128.26	the more force is needed
130.26	to change its direction.
132.26	The marketing is, the bigger a brand,
134.26	the more difficult it is to reposition it.
136.26	So think about a portfolio of brands
138.26	or maybe new brands for new ventures.
141.26	Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
144.26	Getting a little more technical now.
146.26	So this says that
148.26	it's impossible, by definition,
150.26	to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --
152.26	and the momentum of a particle,
154.26	because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
157.26	So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle
159.26	and you shine a light on it,
161.26	then the photon of light has momentum,
164.26	which knocks the particle,
167.26	so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
170.26	By measuring it,
172.26	the act of measurement changes it.
174.26	The act of observation changes it.
176.26	It's the same in marketing.
178.26	So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
181.26	Think about the group of moms
184.26	who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,
187.26	and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
190.26	And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
193.26	Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,
196.26	who stuff their trolleys
198.26	full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,
200.26	but don't shop like that any other day.
203.26	And if you think about the number of people
205.26	who claim in surveys
207.26	to regularly look for porn on the Web,
209.26	it's very few.
211.26	Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
215.26	So luckily, the science --
217.26	no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
220.26	Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,
223.26	more digital media consumption,
225.26	you can measure more what consumers actually do,
228.26	rather than what they say they do.
230.26	So the physics is
232.26	you can never accurately and exactly
234.26	measure a particle,
236.26	because the observation changes it.
238.26	The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --
241.26	that try to measure what consumers actually do,
244.26	rather than what they say they'll do
246.26	or anticipate they'll do.
249.26	So next, the scientific method --
252.26	an axiom of physics, of all science --
254.26	says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,
256.26	you can only disprove it.
258.26	What this means is you can gather more and more data
261.26	around a hypothesis or a positioning,
263.26	and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
266.26	And only one contrary data point
268.26	can blow your theory out of the water.
271.26	So if we take an example --
273.26	Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory
276.26	that the planets would rotate around the Earth.
279.26	It only took one robust observation from Copernicus
282.26	to blow that idea out of the water.
285.26	And there are parallels for marketing --
287.26	you can invest for a long time in a brand,
290.26	but a single contrary observation of that positioning
292.26	will destroy consumers' belief.
295.26	Take BP --
297.26	they spent millions of pounds over many years
299.26	building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,
302.26	but then one little accident.
305.26	Think about Toyota.
307.26	It was, for a long time, revered
309.26	as the most reliable of cars,
311.26	and then they had the big recall incident.
314.26	And Tiger Woods, for a long time,
316.26	the perfect brand ambassador.
318.26	Well, you know the story.
320.26	(Laughter)
326.26	So the physics is
328.26	that you cannot prove a hypothesis,
330.26	but it's easy to disprove it --
332.26	any hypothesis is shaky.
334.26	And the marketing is
336.26	that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,
339.26	one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
342.26	So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups
344.26	that can undermine your brand.
347.26	And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --
350.26	the second law of thermodynamics.
352.26	This says that entropy,
354.26	which is a measure of the disorder of a system,
356.26	will always increase.
358.26	The same is true of marketing.
360.26	If we go back 20 years,
362.26	the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager
365.26	could pretty much define a brand.
368.26	But where we are today, things have changed.
371.26	You can get a strong brand image
373.26	or a message
375.26	and put it out there like the Conservative Party did
377.26	earlier this year with their election poster.
380.26	But then you lose control of it.
383.26	With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools
386.26	that are available now to every consumer,
389.26	it's impossible to control where it goes.
392.26	Your brand starts being dispersed,
394.26	(Laughter)
396.26	it gets more chaotic.
398.26	(Laughter)
400.26	It's out of your control.
402.26	(Laughter)
407.26	I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
409.26	But while this may be unsettling for marketers,
411.26	it's actually a good thing.
413.26	This distribution of brand energy
415.26	gets your brand closer to the people,
417.26	more in with the people.
419.26	It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,
422.26	which is ultimately good for your brand.
425.26	So, the lesson from physics is
427.26	that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
430.26	The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
433.26	You can't fight it, so embrace it
435.26	and find a way to work with it.
438.26	So to close,
440.26	my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me
442.26	that physics is cool,
444.26	and hopefully, I've convinced you
446.26	that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
449.26	Thank you.
451.26	(Applause)
