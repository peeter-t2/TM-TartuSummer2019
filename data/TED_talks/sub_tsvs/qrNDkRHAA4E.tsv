14.468	I want to discuss with you this afternoon
18.15	why you're going to fail
18.15	to have a great career.
20.612	(Laughter)
22.011	I'm an economist.
24.706	I do dismal.
26.823	End of the day, it's ready
26.823	for dismal remarks.
31.204	I only want to talk to those of you
31.204	who want a great career.
35.185	I know some of you have already decided
35.185	you want a good career.
38.931	You're going to fail, too.
40.345	(Laughter)
41.44	Because -- goodness,
41.44	you're all cheery about failing.
44.073	(Laughter)
45.106	Canadian group, undoubtedly.
46.932	(Laughter)
50.082	Those trying to have good careers
50.082	are going to fail,
52.924	because, really, good jobs
52.924	are now disappearing.
56.297	There are great jobs and great careers,
59.658	and then there are the high-workload,
62.314	high-stress, bloodsucking,
62.314	soul-destroying kinds of jobs,
66.814	and practically nothing in-between.
68.539	So people looking for good jobs
68.539	are going to fail.
70.964	I want to talk about those
70.964	looking for great jobs, great careers,
74.17	and why you're going to fail.
77.937	First reason is that no matter
77.937	how many times people tell you,
83.923	"""If you want a great career,"
83.923	you have to pursue your passion,
87.177	you have to pursue your dreams,
87.177	you have to pursue
90.446	"the greatest fascination in your life,"""
93.438	you hear it again and again,
93.438	and then you decide not to do it.
96.717	It doesn't matter
96.717	how many times you download
100.065	Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address,
104.264	you still look at it
104.264	and decide not to do it.
107.1	I'm not quite sure
107.1	why you decide not to do it.
109.814	You're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.
111.915	You're afraid if you look
111.915	for your passion and don't find it,
114.806	you'll feel like you're an idiot,
114.806	so then you make excuses
117.56	about why you're not going
117.56	to look for your passion.
120.306	They are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.
122.226	We're going to go through
122.226	a whole long list --
124.425	your creativity in thinking of excuses
124.425	not to do what you really need to do
128.715	if you want to have a great career.
130.961	So, for example,
130.961	one of your great excuses is:
136.609	(Sigh)
137.99	"""Well, great careers are"
137.99	really and truly, for most people,
141.769	just a matter of luck.
143.92	So I'm going to stand around,
143.92	I'm going to try to be lucky,
147.016	and if I'm lucky,
147.016	I'll have a great career.
149.286	"If not, I'll have a good career."""
150.92	But a good career is an impossibility,
150.92	so that's not going to work.
154.547	Then, your other excuse is,
156.222	"""Yes, there are special people"
156.222	who pursue their passions,
160.808	but they are geniuses.
162.166	They are Steven J.
163.744	I'm not a genius.
165.371	When I was five, I thought I was a genius,
168.002	but my professors have beaten that idea
168.002	"out of my head long since."""
171.946	(Laughter)
173.325	"""And now I know"
173.325	"I am completely competent."""
177.841	Now, you see, if this was 1950,
180.547	being completely competent --
183.587	that would have given you a great career.
185.653	But guess what?
186.83	This is almost 2012,
186.83	and saying to the world,
190.575	"""I am totally, completely competent,"""
193.914	is damning yourself
193.914	with the faintest of praise.
198.424	And then, of course, another excuse:
200.416	"""Well, I would do this,"
200.416	I would do this, but, but --
203.996	well, after all, I'm not weird.
207.963	Everybody knows that people
207.963	who pursue their passions
210.677	are somewhat obsessive.
212.104	A little strange.
213.597	Hmm? Hmm? Okay?
215.256	You know, a fine line
215.256	between madness and genius.
218.502	"""I'm not weird. I've read"
218.502	Steven J.'s biography.
222.811	Oh my goodness --
222.811	I'm not that person. I am nice.
226.694	I am normal.
228.052	I'm a nice, normal person,
228.052	and nice, normal people --
233.003	"don't have passion."""
234.574	(Laughter)
235.622	"""Ah, but I still want a great career."
238.147	I'm not prepared to pursue my passion,
240.1	so I know what I'm going to do,
241.655	because I have a solution.
243.543	I have a strategy.
245.019	It's the one Mommy
245.019	and Daddy told me about.
247.457	Mommy and Daddy told me
247.457	that if I worked hard,
250.536	I'd have a good career.
252.877	So, if you work hard
252.877	and have a good career,
255.639	if you work really, really, really hard,
257.671	you'll have a great career.
259.016	Doesn't that, like,
259.016	"mathematically make sense?"""
261.456	Hmm. Not.
262.964	But you've managed
262.964	to talk yourself into that.
265.453	You know what? Here's a little secret:
267.553	You want to work? You want to work
267.553	really, really, really hard?
270.647	You know what? You'll succeed.
272.124	The world will give you the opportunity
274.054	to work really, really,
274.054	really, really hard.
277.693	But, are you so sure
280.657	that that's going to give you
280.657	a great career,
283.601	when all the evidence is to the contrary?
286.443	So let's deal with those of you
286.443	who are trying to find your passion.
291.97	You actually understand
291.97	that you really had better do it,
294.667	never mind the excuses.
296.017	You're trying to find your passion --
298.658	(Sigh)
299.683	and you're so happy.
301.842	You found something you're interested in.
304.125	"""I have an interest! I have an interest!"""
306.19	You tell me.
307.372	"You say, ""I have an interest!"""
307.372	"I say, ""That's wonderful!"
310.419	"And what are you trying to tell me?"""
312.69	"""Well, I have an interest."""
314.229	"I say, ""Do you have passion?"""
315.813	"""I have an interest,"" you say."
318.022	"""Your interest is compared to what?"""
319.768	"""Well, I'm interested in this."""
322.879	"""And what about the rest"
322.879	"of humanity's activities?"""
326.001	"""I'm not interested in them."""
327.82	"""You've looked at them all, have you?"""
329.947	"""No. Not exactly."""
332.693	Passion is your greatest love.
335.327	Passion is the thing
337.605	that will help you create
337.605	the highest expression of your talent.
342.649	Passion, interest --
342.649	it's not the same thing.
345.244	Are you really going to go
345.244	to your sweetie and say,
347.799	"""Marry me! You're interesting."""
350.682	(Laughter)
353.816	Won't happen.
355.776	Won't happen, and you will die alone.
357.894	(Laughter)
359.26	What you want,
360.569	what you want, what you want,
363.101	is passion.
364.513	It is beyond interest.
366.347	You need 20 interests,
366.347	and then one of them,
369.997	one of them might grab you,
371.767	one of them might engage you
371.767	more than anything else,
374.371	and then you may have found
374.371	your greatest love,
376.989	in comparison to all the other things
376.989	that interest you,
381.204	and that's what passion is.
382.945	I have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.
386	He was an economically rational person.
389.315	"He said to his sweetie, ""Let us marry."
393.355	"Let us merge our interests."""
395.625	(Laughter)
397.521	Yes, he did.
399.259	"""I love you truly,"" he said."
399.259	"""I love you deeply."
403.014	I love you more than any other woman
403.014	I've ever encountered.
407.314	I love you more than Mary,
407.314	Jane, Susie, Penelope,
411.891	Ingrid, Gertrude, Gretel --
413.931	I was on a German exchange program then.
416.407	"I love you more than --"""
419.47	All right.
421.043	She left the room
422.448	halfway through his enumeration
422.448	of his love for her.
427.82	After he got over his surprise
427.82	at being, you know, turned down,
431.976	he concluded he'd had a narrow escape
435.745	from marrying an irrational person.
439.512	Although, he did make a note to himself
439.512	that the next time he proposed,
442.925	it was perhaps not necessary
444.608	to enumerate all of the women
444.608	he had auditioned for the part.
449.791	(Laughter)
451.906	But the point stands.
453.37	You must look for alternatives
453.37	so that you find your destiny,
457.035	"or are you afraid of the word ""destiny""?"
459.694	"Does the word ""destiny"" scare you?"
462.554	That's what we're talking about.
464.14	And if you don't find
464.14	the highest expression of your talent,
467.109	"if you settle for ""interesting,"""
467.109	what the hell ever that means,
470.307	do you know what will happen
470.307	at the end of your long life?
473.49	Your friends and family will be
473.49	gathered in the cemetery,
476.728	and there beside your gravesite
476.728	will be a tombstone,
480.244	and inscribed on that tombstone
481.87	"it will say, ""Here lies"
481.87	a distinguished engineer,
485.745	"who invented Velcro."""
490.505	But what that tombstone should have said,
494.498	in an alternative lifetime,
497.196	what it should have said if it was
497.196	your highest expression of talent,
501.672	"was, ""Here lies the last"
501.672	Nobel Laureate in Physics,
506.248	who formulated
506.248	the Grand Unified Field Theory
509.613	and demonstrated
509.613	"the practicality of warp drive."""
513.602	(Laughter)
515.805	Velcro, indeed!
517.576	(Laughter)
520.686	One was a great career.
523.694	One was a missed opportunity.
527.652	But then, there are some of you who,
530.066	in spite of all these
530.066	excuses, you will find,
533.446	you will find your passion.
536.997	And you'll still fail.
540.176	You're going to fail, because --
544.041	because you're not going to do it,
546.643	because you will have
546.643	invented a new excuse,
550.651	any excuse to fail to take action,
554.452	and this excuse, I've heard so many times:
558.57	"""Yes, I would pursue a great career,"
565.496	but, I value human relationships --
572.257	(Laughter)
573.282	more than accomplishment.
575.394	I want to be a great friend.
577.776	I want to be a great spouse.
580.044	I want to be a great parent,
581.917	and I will not sacrifice them
584.06	"on the altar of great accomplishment."""
588.586	(Laughter)
589.727	What do you want me to say?
591.251	Now, do you really want
591.251	me to say now, tell you,
594.037	"""Really, I swear I don't kick children."""
596.56	(Laughter)
599.227	Look at the worldview
599.227	you've given yourself.
602.013	You're a hero no matter what.
605.42	And I, by suggesting ever so delicately
608.246	that you might want a great career,
608.246	must hate children.
611.444	I don't hate children. I don't kick them.
613.477	Yes, there was a little kid
613.477	wandering through this building
616.396	when I came here, and no,
616.396	I didn't kick him.
618.844	(Laughter)
620.311	Course, I had to tell him
620.311	the building was for adults only,
623.447	and to get out.
625.073	He mumbled something about his mother,
626.993	and I told him she'd probably
626.993	find him outside anyway.
630.541	Last time I saw him,
630.541	he was on the stairs crying.
633.249	(Laughter)
634.361	What a wimp.
635.542	(Laughter)
636.573	But what do you mean?
636.573	That's what you expect me to say.
639.189	Do you really think it's appropriate
641.19	that you should actually take
641.19	children and use them as a shield?
647.827	You know what will happen someday,
650.065	you ideal parent, you?
654.071	The kid will come to you someday and say,
657.112	"""I know what I want to be."
659.548	"I know what I'm going to do with my life."""
661.587	You are so happy.
662.786	It's the conversation
662.786	a parent wants to hear,
665.032	because your kid's good in math,
666.913	and you know you're going to like
666.913	what comes next.
669.73	Says your kid,
671.212	"""I have decided I want to be a magician."
674.639	I want to perform
674.639	"magic tricks on the stage."""
679.322	(Laughter)
680.783	And what do you say?
683.156	You say, you say,
685.655	"""That's risky, kid."
689.002	Might fail, kid. Don't make
689.002	a lot of money at that, kid.
691.825	I don't know, kid, you should
691.825	think about that again, kid.
694.817	"You're so good at math, why don't you --"""
696.816	The kid interrupts you and says,
698.374	"""But it is my dream."
698.374	"It is my dream to do this."""
702.286	And what are you going to say?
704.335	You know what you're going to say?
706.001	"""Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but --"
710.595	"But --"""
711.793	So how are you going to finish
711.793	"the sentence with your ""but""?"
714.717	"""But. I had a dream too, once,"
714.717	"kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."""
720.781	Or are you going to tell him this:
723.384	"""I had a dream once, kid."
727.161	"But then, you were born."""
728.727	(Laughter)
731.061	(Applause)
733.727	Do you really want to use your family,
738.798	do you really ever want to look
738.798	at your spouse and your kid,
743.369	and see your jailers?
746.601	There was something
746.601	you could have said to your kid,
750.236	"when he or she said, ""I have a dream."""
754.012	You could have said --
755.972	looked the kid in the face and said,
760.017	"""Go for it, kid!"
763.162	"Just like I did."""
766.58	But you won't be able to say that,
769.175	because you didn't.
770.857	So you can't.
772.456	(Laughter)
777.086	And so the sins of the parents
780.277	are visited on the poor children.
784.277	Why will you seek refuge
784.277	in human relationships
789.824	as your excuse not to find
789.824	and pursue your passion?
796.53	You know why.
798.363	In your heart of hearts, you know why,
800.903	and I'm being deadly serious.
803.149	You know why you would get
803.149	all warm and fuzzy
805.861	and wrap yourself
805.861	up in human relationships.
809.543	It is because you are --
812.969	you know what you are.
814.761	You're afraid to pursue your passion.
818.18	You're afraid to look ridiculous.
820.236	You're afraid to try.
821.768	You're afraid you may fail.
827.043	Great friend, great spouse,
827.043	great parent, great career.
834.083	Is that not a package?
834.083	Is that not who you are?
838.253	How can you be one without the other?
841.412	But you're afraid.
844.166	And that's why you're not
844.166	going to have a great career.
851.401	Unless --
853.792	"""unless,"" that most evocative"
853.792	of all English words --
859.003	"""unless."""
861.371	"But the ""unless"" word is also attached"
865.828	to that other, most terrifying phrase,
870.804	"""If only I had ..."""
873.463	"""If only I had ..."""
876.191	If you ever have that thought
876.191	ricocheting in your brain,
881.461	it will hurt a lot.
885.007	So, those are the many reasons
887.659	why you are going to fail
889.659	to have a great career.
893.198	Unless --
898.698	Unless.
901.912	Thank you.
903.088	(Applause)
