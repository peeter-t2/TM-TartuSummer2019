12.76	Today I stand before you
12.76	as a man who lives life to the full
16.8	in the here and now.
19.28	But for a long time,
20.96	I lived for death.
23.92	I was a young man who believed
25.56	that jihad is to be understood
25.56	in the language of force and violence.
32.76	I tried to right wrongs
32.76	through power and aggression.
37.44	I had deep concerns
37.44	for the suffering of others
42.76	and a strong desire
42.76	to help and bring relief to them.
49.12	I thought violent jihad was noble,
52.48	chivalrous
53.84	and the best way to help.
57.64	At a time when so many of our people --
59.56	young people especially --
60.84	are at risk of radicalization
63.4	through groups like al-Qaeda,
65.12	Islamic State and others,
67.88	when these groups are claiming
69.36	that their horrific brutality
69.36	and violence are true jihad,
74.44	I want to say that their idea
74.44	of jihad is wrong --
78.64	completely wrong --
80	as was mine, then.
83.2	Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.
86.44	It includes exertion and spirituality,
89.48	self-purification
91	and devotion.
94.48	It refers to positive transformation
97.28	through learning, wisdom
97.28	and remembrance of God.
101.4	The word jihad stands
101.4	for all those meanings as a whole.
106.92	Jihad may at times
106.92	take the form of fighting,
111.36	but only sometimes,
113.2	under strict conditions,
116.2	within rules and limits.
119.84	In Islam,
121.08	the benefit of an act must outweigh
121.08	the harm or hardship it entails.
127.24	More importantly,
129	the verses in the Koran
129	that are connected to jihad or fighting
133.76	do not cancel out the verses
133.76	that talk about forgiveness,
139.36	benevolence
140.68	or patience.
145.32	But now I believe that there are
145.32	no circumstances on earth
149.92	where violent jihad is permissible,
152.52	because it will lead to greater harm.
157.8	But now the idea of jihad
157.8	has been hijacked.
160.32	It has been perverted
160.32	to mean violent struggle
163.68	wherever Muslims
163.68	are undergoing difficulties,
166.68	and turned into terrorism
168.6	by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,
171.68	Islamic State and others.
174.28	But I have come to understand
176.28	that true jihad
176.28	means striving to the utmost
180.24	to strengthen and live
180.24	those qualities which God loves:
184.44	honesty, trustworthiness,
186.8	compassion, benevolence,
188.92	reliability, respect,
190.84	truthfulness --
192.24	human values that so many of us share.
198.36	I was born in Bangladesh,
200.24	but grew up mostly in England.
202.48	And I went to school here.
204.48	My father was an academic,
206.8	and we were in the UK through his work.
210.36	In 1971 we were in Bangladesh
210.36	when everything changed.
216.24	The War of Independence
216.24	impacted upon us terribly,
219.8	pitting family against family,
221.68	neighbor against neighbor.
223.4	And at the age of 12 I experienced war,
226.28	destitution in my family,
228.72	the deaths of 22
228.72	of my relatives in horrible ways,
232.96	as well as the murder of my elder brother.
239.04	I witnessed killing ...
243	animals feeding on corpses in the streets,
245.84	starvation all around me,
247.6	wanton, horrific violence --
249.76	senseless violence.
254.28	I was a young man,
256.04	teenager, fascinated by ideas.
259	I wanted to learn,
260.84	but I could not go to school
260.84	for four years.
264.76	After the War of Independence,
266.24	my father was put in prison
266.24	for two and a half years,
269.839	and I used to visit him
269.839	every week in prison,
273.12	and homeschooled myself.
276.08	My father was released in 1973
279.52	and he fled to England as a refugee,
282.12	and we soon followed him.
284.72	I was 17.
286.4	So these experiences gave me
288.88	a sharp awareness of the atrocities
288.88	and injustices in the world.
294.32	And I had a strong desire --
296.16	a very keen, deep desire --
298.2	to right wrongs
299.44	and help the victims of oppression.
302.6	While studying at college in the UK,
304.56	I met others who showed me
304.56	how I could channel that desire
310.72	and help through my religion.
313.72	And I was radicalized --
315.04	enough to consider violence correct,
319.64	even a virtue under certain circumstances.
324.32	So I became involved
324.32	in the jihad in Afghanistan.
327.56	I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan
327.56	population against the Soviet army.
332.96	And I thought that was jihad:
335.36	my sacred duty,
336.88	which would be rewarded by God.
343.88	I became a preacher.
347.96	I was one of the pioneers
347.96	of violent jihad in the UK.
353.08	I recruited,
354.6	I raised funds, I trained.
357.36	I confused true jihad
359.92	with this perversion
359.92	as presented by the fascist Islamists --
365.68	these people who use the idea of jihad
368.76	to justify their lust for power,
368.76	authority and control on earth:
373.745	a perversion perpetuated today
373.745	by fascist Islamist groups
378.08	like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.
382.44	For a period of around 15 years,
385.48	I fought for short periods of time
390.24	in Kashmir and Burma,
392	besides Afghanistan.
397	Our aim was to remove the invaders,
400.76	to bring relief to the oppressed victims
404.88	and of course to establish
404.88	an Islamic state,
408.04	a caliphate for God's rule.
410.72	And I did this openly.
413.48	I didn't break any laws.
416.44	I was proud and grateful to be British --
419.56	I still am.
421.16	And I bore no hostility
421.16	against this, my country,
425.96	nor enmity towards
425.96	the non-Muslim citizens,
429.52	and I still don't.
433.84	During one battle in Afghanistan,
436.24	some British men and I
436.24	formed a special bond
439.96	with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,
442.72	Abdullah,
444.84	an innocent, loving and lovable kid
447.2	who was always eager to please.
450.96	He was poor.
452.76	And boys like him
452.76	did menial tasks in the camp.
456.48	And he seemed happy enough,
458.48	but I couldn't help wonder --
459.92	his parents must have missed him dearly.
463.56	And they must have dreamt
463.56	about a better future for him.
469.56	A victim of circumstance
469.56	caught up in a war,
472.4	cruelly thrust upon him
474.72	by the cruel circumstances of the time.
480.68	One day I picked up this unexploded
480.68	mortar shell in a trench,
486.32	and I had it deposited
486.32	in a makeshift mud hut lab.
491.28	And I went out on a short,
491.28	pointless skirmish --
494.24	always pointless,
496.44	And I came back a few hours later
496.44	to discover he was dead.
501.16	He had tried to recover
501.16	explosives from that shell.
503.96	It exploded, and he died a violent death,
507.44	blown to bits by the very same device
507.44	that had proved harmless to me.
513.08	So I started to question.
516.6	How did his death serve any purpose?
522.28	Why did he die and I lived?
525.559	I carried on.
527.08	I fought in Kashmir.
528.72	I also recruited for the Philippines,
531.44	Bosnia and Chechnya.
534.559	And the questions grew.
537.88	Later in Burma,
539.8	I came across Rohingya fighters,
542.16	who were barely teenagers,
544.44	born and brought up in the jungle,
546.12	carrying machine guns
546.12	and grenade launchers.
552	I met two 13-year-olds
552	with soft manners and gentle voices.
558.92	Looking at me,
560.16	they begged me
560.16	to take them away to England.
568.72	They simply wanted to go to school --
571.68	that was their dream.
576.36	My family --
577.6	my children of the same age --
579.08	were living at home in the UK,
582.04	going to school,
583.36	living a safe life.
585.88	And I couldn't help wonder
587.16	how much these young boys
587.16	must have spoken to one another
590.64	about their dreams for such a life.
594.92	Victims of circumstances:
598.36	these two young boys,
600.32	sleeping rough on the ground,
600.32	looking up at the stars,
603.4	cynically exploited by their leaders
605.92	for their personal lust
605.92	for glory and power.
609.92	I soon witnessed boys like them
609.92	killing one another
613.16	in conflicts between rival groups.
617.4	And it was the same everywhere ...
621.28	Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,
623.8	Philippines, Chechnya;
626.24	petty warlords got the young
626.24	and vulnerable to kill one another
630.88	in the name of jihad.
634.24	Muslims against Muslims.
637.64	Not protecting anyone
637.64	against invaders or occupiers;
642.04	not bringing relief to the oppressed.
646.24	Children being used,
647.64	cynically exploited;
649.28	people dying in conflicts
651.24	which I was supporting
651.24	in the name of jihad.
656.92	And it still carries on today.
663.8	Realizing that the violent jihad
667.44	I had engaged in abroad
673.44	was so different --
677.28	such a chasm between
677.28	what I had experienced
682.04	and what I thought was sacred duty --
684.64	I had to reflect
684.64	on my activities here in the UK.
690.24	I had to consider my preaching,
692.32	recruiting, fund-raising,
693.88	training,
695.48	but most importantly, radicalizing --
698.64	sending young people to fight and die
700.88	as I was doing --
702.12	all totally wrong.
707.68	So I got involved
707.68	in violent jihad in the mid '80s,
711.96	starting with Afghanistan.
714.6	And by the time I finished
714.6	it was in the year 2000.
719.04	I was completely immersed in it.
720.64	All around me people supported,
722.6	applauded,
723.84	even celebrated what
723.84	we were doing in their name.
728.16	But by the time I learned to get out,
730	completely disillusioned in the year 2000,
737.2	So what goes wrong?
740.72	We were so busy talking about virtue,
745.16	and we were blinded by a cause.
752.24	And we did not give ourselves a chance
752.24	to develop a virtuous character.
757.68	We told ourselves
757.68	we were fighting for the oppressed,
761.84	but these were unwinnable wars.
765.72	We became the very instrument
765.72	through which more deaths occurred,
769.36	complicit in causing further misery
773.12	for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.
784.28	So over time,
785.52	a very long time,
788.6	I opened my eyes.
791.96	I began to dare
795.04	to face the truth,
796.72	to think,
799.36	to face the hard questions.
801.52	I got in touch with my soul.
814.08	What have I learned?
816.64	That people who engage
816.64	in violent jihadism,
822.96	that people who are drawn
822.96	to these types of extremisms,
826.6	are not that different to everyone else.
829.88	But I believe such people can change.
834.12	They can regain their hearts
834.12	and restore them
837	by filling them
837	with human values that heal.
847	When we ignore the realities,
849.24	we discover that we accept what
849.24	we are told without critical reflection.
857.64	And we ignore the gifts and advantages
857.64	that many of us would cherish
861.44	even for a single moment in their lives.
868.4	I engaged in actions
868.4	I thought were correct.
873.76	But now I began to question
873.76	how I knew what I knew.
879.84	I endlessly told others
879.84	to accept the truth,
883.56	but I failed to give doubt
883.56	its rightful place.
892.92	This conviction that people can change
892.92	is rooted in my experience,
897.8	my own journey.
900.52	Through wide reading,
902.44	reflecting,
904.16	contemplation, self-knowledge,
906.08	I discovered,
907.32	I realized that Islamists' world
907.32	of us and them is false and unjust.
916.8	Through considering the uncertainties
916.8	in all that we had asserted,
921.4	to the inviolable truths,
923.04	incontestable truths,
926.96	I developed a more nuanced understanding.
936.48	I realized that in a world crowded
936.48	with variation and contradiction,
941.92	foolish preachers,
943.16	only foolish preachers
943.16	like I used to be,
946.2	see no paradox in the myths and fictions
946.2	they use to assert authenticity.
953.12	So I understood the vital
953.12	importance of self-knowledge,
957.68	political awareness
960	and the necessity
960	for a deep and wide understanding
964.68	of our commitments and our actions,
967.16	how they affect others.
970.52	So my plea today to everyone,
972	especially those who sincerely
972	believe in Islamist jihadism ...
978.48	refuse dogmatic authority;
982.36	let go of anger, hatred and violence;
987.12	learn to right wrongs
988.8	without even attempting to justify
988.8	cruel, unjust and futile behavior.
996.84	Instead create a few
996.84	beautiful and useful things
1000.2	that outlive us.
1005.2	Approach the world, life,
1007.08	with love.
1010	Learn to develop
1011.24	or cultivate your hearts
1012.52	to see goodness, beauty and truth
1012.52	in others and in the world.
1017	That way we do matter
1017	more to ourselves ...
1021.24	to each other,
1023.16	to our communities
1024.4	and, for me, to God.
1027	This is jihad --
1028.64	my true jihad.
1030.92	Thank you.
1032.16	(Applause)
