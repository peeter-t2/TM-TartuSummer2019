16.235	The Kraken, a beast so terrifying
19.271	it was said to devour men and ships and whales,
22.368	and so enormous it could be mistaken for an island.
26.295	In assessing the merits of such tales,
28.551	it's probably wise to keep in mind that old sailor's saw
31.436	that the only difference between a fairytale and a sea story
35.059	"is a fairytale begins, ""Once upon a time,"""
37.696	"and a sea story begins, ""This ain't no shit."" (Laughter)"
42.929	Every fish that gets away
44.707	grows with every telling of the tale.
46.855	Nevertheless, there are giants in the ocean,
49.342	and we now have video proof,
51.371	as those of you that saw the Discovery Channel documentary are no doubt aware.
55.993	I was one of the three scientists on this expedition
58.63	that took place last summer off Japan.
60.826	I'm the short one.
63.322	The other two are Dr. Tsunemi Kubodera and Dr. Steve O'Shea.
67.38	I owe my participation in this now-historic event
70.91	to TED.
72.716	In 2010, there was a TED event called Mission Blue
75.791	held aboard the Lindblad Explorer in the Galapagos
78.525	as part of the fulfillment of Sylvia Earle's TED wish.
82.367	I spoke about a new way of exploring the ocean,
85.156	one that focuses on attracting animals instead of scaring them away.
89.933	Mike deGruy was also invited,
92.229	and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,
95.784	and he also talked to me about applying my approach
98.197	to something he's been involved with for a very long time,
100.853	which is the hunt for the giant squid.
104.287	It was Mike that got me invited to the squid summit,
108.167	a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel
112.292	that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter)
117.081	I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing
119.497	and optical luring of deep sea squid
122.04	in which I emphasized the importance
123.817	of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.
129.067	This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,
131.792	farting around in the dark
134.118	using these platforms,
136.896	and my impression that I saw more animals
140.479	working from the submersible
142.36	than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.
145.28	But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.
148.65	But I also felt like I saw more animals
150.339	working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,
152.19	two vehicles with the same field of view
154.375	but different propulsion systems.
156.413	So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.
160.444	So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,
162.7	and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance
165.86	and recorded the sound they made.
168.292	The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --
169.929	which you can probably just barely hear here,
172.524	uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.
176.124	The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.
179.479	It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)
184.558	But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics
187.761	and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise)
191.199	I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
194.625	So for the deep sea squid hunt,
197.118	I proposed using an optical lure
199.275	attached to a camera platform
201.435	with no thrusters, no motors,
206.203	just a battery-powered camera,
208.812	and the only illumination coming from red light
211.832	that's invisible to most deep-sea animals
214.324	that are adapted to see primarily blue.
217.016	That's visible to our eye,
218.278	but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
221.619	So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,
224.46	could just be thrown off the back of the ship,
226.589	attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,
232.175	it would just float around passively carried by the currents,
236.254	and the only light visible to the animals in the deep
240.651	would be the blue light of the optical lure,
244.638	which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,
248.418	because it was designed to imitate
251.278	the bioluminescent display
253.534	of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
256.879	Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces
260.44	is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm
263.423	and is a form of defense.
265.701	The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure
268.882	is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,
271.785	but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light
276.214	when it's being chewed on by a predator
278.591	and its only hope for escape
281.27	may be to attract the attention of a larger predator
284.245	that will attack its attacker
286.307	and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
288.85	It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,
292.742	and a common form of defense in the deep sea.
296.15	The approach worked.
298.263	Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner
301.774	a single video glimpse of the giant,
304.222	we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.
308.887	Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.
322.105	EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --
325.241	now you see me, now you don't --
327.286	and we had four such teasing appearances,
330.289	and then on the fifth, it came in and totally wowed us.
335.698	(Music) Narrator: (Speaking in Japanese)
339.971	Scientists: Ooh. Bang! Oh my God! Whoa!
352.259	(Applause)
354.513	EW: The full monty.
359.367	What really wowed me about that
360.712	was the way it came in up over the e-jelly
362.886	and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,
365.206	which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.
368.512	But even more incredible was the footage shot
370.931	from the Triton submersible.
373.576	What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary
376.36	was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,
379.806	a one-meter long diamondback squid
383.408	had a light attached to it, a squid jig
386.12	of the type that longline fishermen use,
388.704	and I think it was this light
390.742	that brought the giant in.
393.291	Now, what you're seeing
394.756	is the intensified camera's view under red light,
399.854	and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
403.976	And then he got so excited,
406.431	he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,
409.926	and the giant didn't run away,
412.11	so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,
415.351	bringing a creature of legend
417.887	from the misty history into high-resolution video.
422.858	It was absolutely breathtaking,
426.126	and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact
429.055	and fully extended,
430.52	it would have been as tall as a two-story house.
433.772	How could something that big
436.431	live in our ocean and yet remain unfilmed until now?
441.031	We've only explored about five percent of our ocean.
444.655	There are great discoveries yet to be made down there,
447.791	fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution
452.413	and possibly bioactive compounds
454.51	that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.
458.325	Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction
461.373	of the money on ocean exploration
464.742	that we've spent on space exploration.
467.149	We need a NASA-like organization for ocean exploration,
470.794	because we need to be exploring and protecting
473.629	our life support systems here on Earth.
476.221	We need â€” thank you. (Applause)
482.453	Exploration is the engine that drives innovation.
485.307	Innovation drives economic growth.
488.278	So let's all go exploring,
489.801	but let's do it in a way that doesn't scare the animals away,
492.902	or, as Mike deGruy once said,
495.235	"""If you want to get away from it all"
497.021	and see something you've never seen,
498.635	or have an excellent chance of seeing something that no one's ever seen,
502.22	"get in a sub."""
503.75	He should have been with us for this adventure.
505.956	We miss him.
507.763	(Applause)
