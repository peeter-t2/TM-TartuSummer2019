12.891	Is there a real you?
13.988	This might seem to you 
13.988	like a very odd question.
16.338	Because, you might ask,
18.897	how do we find the real you,
21.225	how do you know what the real you is?
23.259	And so forth.
24.223	But the idea that there must be a real you,
27.591	surely that's obvious.
28.634	If there's anything real 
28.634	in the world, it's you.
31.895	Well, I'm not quite sure.
33.84	At least we have to understand 
33.84	a bit better what that means.
36.457	Now certainly, I think there are
36.457	lots of things in our culture around us
40.291	which sort of reinforce the idea
42.498	that for each one of us,
42.498	we have a kind of a core, an essence.
46.249	There is something about what it means
46.249	to be you which defines you,
49.683	and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.
52.003	The most kind of crude way
52.003	in which we have it,
53.813	are things like horoscopes.
55.107	You know, people are very wedded
55.107	to these, actually.
58.147	People put them on their Facebook profile
60.111	as though they are meaningul,
61.594	you even know 
61.594	your Chinese horoscope as well.
64.271	There are also 
64.271	more scientific versions of this,
66.724	all sorts of ways of profiling
66.724	personality type,
69.781	such as the Myers-Briggs tests,
69.781	for example.
72.454	I don't know if you've done those.
73.835	A lot of companies 
73.835	use these for recruitment.
75.739	You answer a lot of questions,
79.036	and this is supposed to reveal
79.036	something about your core personality.
82.792	And of course, the popular fascination 
82.792	with this is enormous.
86.093	In magazines like this, you'll see,
87.761	in the bottom left corner,
87.761	they'll advertise in virtually every issue
91.223	some kind of personality thing.
93.333	And if you pick up one of those magazines,
95.113	it's hard to resist, isn't it?
96.361	Doing the test to find
96.361	what is your learning style,
99.226	what is your loving style,
99.226	or what is your working style?
102.354	Are you this kind of person or that?
104.954	So I think that we have a common-sense idea
108.987	that there is a kind of core 
108.987	or essence of ourselves
111.634	to be discovered.
113.168	And that this is kind of a permanent truth
113.168	about ourselves,
116.424	something that's the same throughout life.
118.864	Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.
122.615	And I have to say now,
122.615	I'll say it a bit later,
124.457	but I'm not challenging this
124.457	just because I'm weird,
127.285	the challenge actually has a very,
127.285	very long and distinguished history.
131.082	Here's the common-sense idea.
133.251	There is you.
134.287	You are the individuals you are,
134.287	and you have this kind of core.
137.595	Now in your life, what happens
137.595	is that you, of course,
142.227	accumulate different experiences
142.227	and so forth.
144.446	So you have memories,
146.716	and these memories help 
146.716	to create what you are.
148.966	You have desires, maybe for a cookie,
151.623	maybe for something
151.623	that we don't want to talk about
154.418	at 11 o'clock in the morning
154.418	in a school.
156.293	You will have beliefs.
158.274	This is a number plate
158.274	from someone in America.
160.187	I don't know whether this number plate,
160.187	"which says ""messiah 1,"""
162.959	indicates that the driver
162.959	believes in the messiah,
165.251	or that they are the messiah.
167.445	Either way, they have beliefs 
167.445	about messiahs.
170.158	We have knowledge.
171.62	We have sensations and experiences as well.
173.878	It's not just intellectual things.
176.395	So this is kind of 
176.395	the common-sense model, I think,
178.998	of what a person is.
180.15	There is a person who has all the things
180.15	that make up our life experiences.
186.441	But the suggestion 
186.441	I want to put to you today
188.96	is that there's something 
188.96	fundamentally wrong with this model.
192.395	And I can show you what's wrong
192.395	with one click.
194.853	"Which is there isn't actually a ""you"""
194.853	at the heart of all these experiences.
201.708	Strange thought?
201.708	Well, maybe not.
203.321	What is there, then?
205.079	Well, clearly there are memories,
205.079	desires, intentions, sensations,
208.348	and so forth.
210.291	But what happens is
210.291	these things exist,
212.549	and they're kind of all integrated,
214.618	they're overlapped, they're connected
214.618	in various different ways.
218.407	They're connecting partly,
218.407	and perhaps even mainly,
220.997	because they all belong to one body
220.997	and one brain.
224.324	But there's also a narrative, 
224.324	a story we tell about ourselves,
227.387	the experiences we have
227.387	when we remember past things.
230.282	We do things because of other things.
232.514	So what we desire
232.514	is partly a result of what we believe,
236.126	and what we remember is also
236.126	informing us what we know.
239.692	And so really, there are all these things,
242.354	like beliefs, desires, 
242.354	sensations, experiences,
245.393	they're all related to each other,
247.823	and that just is you.
251.371	In some ways, it's a small difference
251.371	from the common-sense understanding.
256.208	In some ways, it's a massive one.
258.462	It's the shift between thinking of yourself
260.638	as a thing which has 
260.638	all the experiences of life,
264.034	and thinking of yourself
264.034	as simply that collection
266.977	of all experiences in life.
268.999	You are the sum of your parts.
271.847	Now those parts are also physical parts, 
271.847	of course,
273.969	brains, bodies and legs and things,
275.871	but they aren't so important, actually.
278.174	If you have a heart transplant,
278.174	you're still the same person.
280.847	If you have a memory transplant,
280.847	are you the same person?
283.227	If you have a belief transplant, 
283.227	would you be the same person?
286.602	Now this idea, that what we are, 
286.602	the way to understand ourselves,
291.501	is as not of some permanent being,
291.501	which has experiences,
295.962	but is kind of a collection of experiences,
298.36	might strike you as kind of weird.
300.971	But actually, I don't think 
300.971	it should be weird.
303.055	In a way, it's common sense.
304.914	Because I just invite you 
304.914	to think about, by comparison,
309.215	think about pretty much anything else
309.215	in the universe,
312.172	maybe apart from the 
312.172	very most fundamental forces or powers.
314.922	Let's take something like water.
317.657	Now my science isn't very good.
320.198	We might say something like 
320.198	water has two parts hydrogen
323.213	and one parts oxygen, right?
325.099	We all know that.
326.747	I hope no one in this room
326.747	thinks that what that means
330.212	is there is a thing called water, 
330.212	and attached to it 
334.414	are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,
337.051	and that's what water is.
338.244	Of course we don't.
339.099	We understand, very easily,
339.099	very straightforwardly,
342.351	that water is nothing more
344.083	than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules
344.083	suitably arranged.
349.117	Everything else in the universe is the same.
351.03	There's no mystery about my watch,
351.03	for example.
355.199	We say the watch has a face, and hands,
358.562	and a mechanism and a battery,
360.362	But what we really mean is,
361.523	we don't think 
361.523	there is a thing called the watch
363.128	to which we then attach all these bits.
365.861	We understand very clearly 
365.861	that you get the parts of the watch,
368.897	you put them together,
368.897	and you create a watch.
370.994	Now if everything else 
370.994	in the universe is like this,
373.638	why are we different?
375.944	Why think of ourselves
377.508	as somehow not just being 
377.508	a collection of all our parts,
381.46	but somehow being a separate,
381.46	permanent entity which has those parts?
386.328	Now this view is not particularly new, 
386.328	actually.
389.438	It has quite a long lineage.
391.113	You find it in Buddhism,
392.463	you find it in 17th, 
395.009	going through to the current day,
395.009	people like Locke and Hume.
398.604	But interestingly, it's also a view
400.687	increasingly being heard reinforced
400.687	by neuroscience.
404.731	This is Paul Broks, 
404.731	he's a clinical neuropsychologist,
408.375	and he says this:
409.574	"""We have a deep intuition"
409.574	that there is a core,
411.956	an essence there, 
411.956	and it's hard to shake off,
414.505	probably impossible to shake off, 
414.505	I suspect.
417.516	But it's true that neuroscience shows
417.516	that there is no centre in the brain
421.443	"where things do all come together."""
423.733	So when you look at the brain,
426.203	and you look at how the brain
426.203	makes possible a sense of self,
430.22	you find that there isn't 
430.22	a central control spot in the brain.
434.004	There is no kind of center
434.004	where everything happens.
437.303	There are lots of different processes
437.303	in the brain,
439.888	all of which operate, in a way,
439.888	quite independently.
442.987	But it's because of the way 
442.987	that they relate
446.097	that we get this sense of self.
448.958	The term I use in the book, 
448.958	I call it the ego trick.
452.447	It's like a mechanical trick.
457.106	It's not that we don't exist,
459.586	it's just that the trick is 
459.586	to make us feel that inside of us
462.87	is something more unified
462.87	than is really there.
466.356	Now you might think
466.356	this is a worrying idea.
469.493	You might think that if it's true,
471.825	that for each one of us there is
471.825	no abiding core of self,
475.576	no permanent essence,
477.561	does that mean that really,
477.561	the self is an illusion?
481.493	Does it mean that we really don't exist?
483.807	There is no real you.
485.615	Well, a lot of people actually do use 
485.615	this talk of illusion and so forth.
488.696	These are three psychologists,
488.696	Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,
492.674	Susan Blackmore,
494.978	a lot of these people do talk 
494.978	the language of illusion,
497.963	the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.
500.029	But I don't think this is 
500.029	a very helpful way of looking at it.
503.075	Go back to the watch.
503.852	The watch isn't an illusion, 
503.852	because there is nothing to the watch
507.904	other than a collection of its parts.
510.152	In the same way, 
510.152	we're not illusions either.
512.109	The fact that we are, in some ways,
512.109	just this very, very complex collection,
517.552	ordered collection of things,
519.137	does not mean we're not real.
521.012	I can give you 
521.012	a very sort of rough metaphor for this.
523.911	Let's take something like a waterfall.
526.516	These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.
530.123	Now if you take something like this,
532.625	you can appreciate the fact 
532.625	that in lots of ways,
535.919	there's nothing permanent about this.
538.029	For one thing, it's always changing.
539.462	The waters 
539.462	are always carving new channels.
542.309	with changes and tides and the weather,
544.6	some things dry up, 
544.6	new things are created.
549.024	Of course the water that flows 
549.024	through the waterfall
552.511	is different every single instance.
555.413	But it doesn't mean that 
555.413	the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.
558.165	It doesn't mean it's not real.
559.798	What it means is we have 
559.798	to understand what it is
563.132	as something which has a history,
565.361	has certain things that keep it together,
568.003	but it's a process, it's fluid, 
568.003	it's forever changing.
570.799	Now that, I think, is a model
570.799	for understanding ourselves,
574.531	and I think it's a liberating model.
576.195	Because if you think that you have
576.195	this fixed, permanent essence,
579.231	which is always the same,
579.231	throughout your life, no matter what,
582.237	in a sense you're kind of trapped.
584.807	You're born with an essence,
587.418	that's what you are until you die,
590.101	if you believe in an afterlife, 
590.101	maybe you continue.
593.13	But if you think of yourself
593.13	as being, in a way,
596.1	not a thing as such, 
596.1	but a kind of a process,
599.88	something that is changing,
601.407	then I think that's quite liberating.
602.944	Because unlike the the waterfalls,
605.812	we actually have the capacity to channel
608.307	the direction of our development for ourselves
608.307	to a certain degree.
611.929	Now we've got to be careful here, right?
614.302	If you watch the X-Factor too much,
614.302	you might buy into this idea
617.392	that we can all be whatever we want to be.
619.721	That's not true.
621.039	I've heard some fantastic musicians
621.039	this morning,
623.209	and I am very confident
623.209	that I could in no way be as good as them.
626.927	I could practice hard 
626.927	and maybe be good,
629.324	but I don't have
629.324	that really natural ability.
632.328	There are limits to what we can achieve.
634.985	There are limits to what 
634.985	we can make of ourselves.
637.46	But nevertheless, we do have 
637.46	this capacity
640.122	to, in a sense, shape ourselves.
644.112	The true self, as it were then,
646.368	is not something that is just there
646.368	for you to discover,
650.429	you don't sort of look into your soul
650.429	and find your true self,
654.078	What you are partly doing, at least,
655.899	is actually creating your true self.
658.29	And this, I think, is very,
658.29	very significant,
660.213	particularly at this stage of life you're at.
662.179	You'll be aware of the fact
663.578	how much of you changed over recent years.
666.132	If you have any videos of yourself, 
666.132	three or four years ago,
669.371	you probably feel embarrassed 
669.371	because you don't recognize yourself.
672.651	So I want to get that message over,
672.651	that what we need to do
675.532	is think about ourselves as things
675.532	that we can shape,
678.592	and channel and change.
679.645	This is the Buddha, again:
680.941	"""Well-makers lead the water,"
683.36	fletchers bend the arrow,
684.761	carpenters bend a log of wood,
687.226	"wise people fashion themselves."""
691	And that's the idea 
691	I want to leave you with,
692.461	that your true self is not something 
692.461	that you will have to go searching for,
699.668	as a mystery, and maybe never ever find.
702.873	To the extent you have a true self,
704.574	it's something that you in part discover,
707.308	but in part create.
709.701	and that, I think, 
709.701	is a liberating and exciting prospect.
714.197	Thank you very much.
