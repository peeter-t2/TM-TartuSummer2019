13.283	The FBI is responsible
13.283	for more terrorism plots
15.504	in the United States
17.175	than any other organization.
19.771	More than al Qaeda,
21.625	more than al Shabaab,
23.01	more than the Islamic State,
24.56	more than all of them combined.
27.354	This isn't likely how you
27.354	think about the FBI.
30.011	You probably think of FBI agents
30.011	gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,
34.066	or arresting corrupt politicians.
37.207	After the 9/11 terrorist attacks,
38.858	the FBI became less concerned 
40.331	with gangsters and 
40.331	crooked elected officials.
42.94	The new target became terrorists,
45.402	and the pursuit of terrorists 
45.402	has consumed the FBI.
48.823	Every year, the Bureau spends
48.823	3.3 billion dollars
51.618	on domestic counterterrorism activities.
54.222	Compare than to just 2.6 billion dollars
54.222	combined for organized crime,
57.823	financial fraud, public corruption
59.999	and all other types of traditional
59.999	criminal activity.
62.777	I've spent years pouring through
62.777	the case files
64.973	of terrorism prosecutions in 
64.973	the United States,
67.805	and I've come to 
67.805	the conclusion that the FBI
70.074	is much better at creating terrorists
70.074	than it is at catching terrorists.
75.083	In the 14 years since 9/11,
77.097	you can count about six real 
77.097	terrorist attacks in the United States.
80.681	These include the Boston Marathon 
80.681	bombings in 2013,
83.751	as well as failed attacks,
85.04	such as the time when 
85.04	a man named Faisal Shahzad
87.505	tried to deliver a car bomb
87.505	to Times Square.
90.507	In those same 14 years,
92.122	the Bureau, however, has bragged
93.754	about how it's foiled dozens
93.754	of terrorism plots.
96.945	In all, the FBI has arrested
96.945	more than 175 people
101.183	in aggressive, undercover 
101.183	conterterrorism stings.
104.629	These operations, which are usually
104.629	led by an informant,
107.467	provide the means and opportunity,
109.293	and sometimes even the idea,
111.225	for mentally ill and 
111.225	economically desperate people
114.081	to become what we now term terrorists.
118.061	After 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:
120.368	never again.
121.586	Never another attack on American soil.
124.707	FBI agents were told to find terrorists
124.707	before they struck.
127.667	To do this, agents recruited a network
127.667	of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,
132.507	all looking for anyone who 
132.507	might be dangerous.
135.276	An informant can earn 
137.647	for every terrorism case 
137.647	they bring to the FBI.
140.752	That's right, the FBI is paying
140.752	mostly criminals and con men
144.025	six figures to spy on communities
144.025	in the United States,
146.926	but mostly Muslim American communities.
150.103	These informants nab people like 
150.103	Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif
153.277	and Walli Mujahidh.
155.148	Both are mentally ill.
156.653	Abdul-Latif had a history of huffing
156.653	gasoline and attempting suicide.
160.016	Mujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,
162.537	he had trouble distinguishing between
162.537	reality and fantasy.
165.745	In 2012, the FBI arrested these two men
168.227	for conspiring to attack a military
168.227	recruiting station outside Seattle
172.039	with weapons provided, 
172.039	of course, by the FBI.
176.363	The FBI's informant was Robert Childs,
179.068	a convicted rapist and child molester
181.027	who was paid 90,000 dollars 
181.027	for his work on the case.
184.361	This isn't an outlier.
185.849	In 2009, an FBI informant
185.849	who had fled Pakistan on murder charges
189.671	led four men in a plot to bomb 
189.671	synagogues in the Bronx.
193.575	The lead defendant was James Cromitie,
195.526	a broke Walmart employee
195.526	with a history of mental problems.
198.476	And the informant had offered 
198.476	him 250,000 dollars
201.201	if he participated in that plot.
203.587	There are many more examples.
206.232	Today, The Intercept
206.232	published my new story
208.35	about a counterterrorism sting in Tampa
208.35	involving Sami Osmakac,
212.065	a young man who was living 
212.065	near Tampa, Florida.
215.218	Osmakac also had 
215.218	schizoaffective disorder.
217.89	He too was broke,
218.895	and he had no connections to 
218.895	international terrorist groups.
221.932	Nonetheless,
222.773	an FBI informant gave him a job,
222.773	handed him money,
226.617	introduced him to an undercover agent
226.617	posing as a terrorist,
229.438	and lured him in a plot
229.438	to bomb an Irish bar.
232.727	But here's what's interesting:
234.684	The lead undercover agent --
236.138	you can see him in this picture
236.138	with his face blurred --
238.776	would go back to the Tampa field office
238.776	with his recording equipment on.
242.287	Behind closed doors,
243.608	FBI agents admitted that what
243.608	they were doing was farcical.
246.987	A federal judge doesn't want you
246.987	to hear about these conversations.
250.216	He sealed the transcripts and placed
250.216	them under a protective order
253.367	in an attempt to prevent someone like me
253.367	from doing something like this.
257.574	Behind closed doors, the lead agent,
259.585	the squad supervisor,
260.916	described their would-be terrorist
262.551	"as a ""retarded fool who didn't have"
262.551	"a pot to piss in."""
265.182	They described his terrorist ambitions
267.009	as wishy-washy and
267.009	a pipe dream scenario.
270.998	But that didn't stop the FBI.
272.756	They provided Sami Osmakac 
272.756	everything he needed.
276.092	They gave him a car bomb,
276.092	they gave him an AK-47,
279.804	they helped him make a so-called
279.804	martyrdom video,
282.386	and they even gave 
282.386	him money for a taxi cab
284.48	so that he could get to where
284.48	they wanted him to go.
288.004	As they were working the sting,
289.814	the squad supervisor tells his agents
289.814	he wanted a Hollywood ending.
294.527	And he got a Hollywood ending.
297.048	When Sami Osmakac attempted
297.048	to deliver what he thought
299.609	was a car bomb,
300.905	he was arrested, convicted and 
300.905	sentenced to 40 years in prison.
305.604	Sami Osmakac isn't alone.
308.223	He's one of more than 
310.825	for whom the FBI has created 
310.825	Hollywood endings.
315.813	U.S. government officials call this
315.813	the War on Terror.
318.982	It's really just theater,
320.759	a national security theater,
323.089	with mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac
325.574	unwitting actors in a 
325.574	carefully choreographed production
328.621	brought to you by the FBI.
330.829	Thank you.
331.956	(Applause)
341.09	Tom Rielly: So, those are some
341.09	pretty strong accusations,
344.421	pretty strong charges.
347.098	How can you back this up?
348.711	Trevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010
350.727	when I received a grant from the 
350.727	Investigative Reporting Program
353.795	at U.C. Berkeley,
354.73	and a research assistant and I
356.162	put together a database
356.162	of all terrorism prosecutions
358.635	at the time during 
358.635	the first decade after 9/11.
361.651	And we used the court file
361.651	to find out whether
364.458	the defendants had any connections
364.458	to international terrorist groups,
367.881	whether an informant was used,
369.364	and whether the informant
369.364	played the role of an agent provocateur
372.506	by providing the means and opportunity.
374.373	And we submitted that to the FBI
375.95	and we asked them to respond
375.95	to our database.
378.064	If they believed there were any errors,
380.021	we asked them to tell us what they were
380.021	and we'd go back and check
383.154	and they never challenged any
383.154	of our findings.
385.382	Later, I used that data 
385.382	in a magazine article
387.58	and later in my book,
388.629	and on appearances on places
388.629	like CBS and NPR,
391.176	they were offered that opportunity again
393.083	"to say, ""Trevor Aaronson's "
393.083	"findings are wrong."""
395.333	And they've never
395.333	come forward and said,
397.193	"""These are the problems"
397.193	"with those findings."""
399.314	So the data has since been used 
399.314	by groups like Human Rights Watch
402.455	on its recent report on 
402.455	these types of sting operations.
405.157	And so far, the FBI has never 
405.157	really responded
407.796	to these charges that it's really
407.796	not catching terrorists
411.022	so much as it's catching
411.022	mentally ill people
413.167	that it can dress up as terrorists 
413.167	in these types of sting operations.
417.849	TR: So The Intercept is that new
417.849	investigative journalism website,
421.327	that's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.
423.095	Tell us about your article 
423.095	and why there.
426.674	TA: The Intercept seemed to be
426.674	the most logical place for this
429.654	because my article is 
429.654	really leveraging the fact that
432.723	a source had leaked to me
432.723	transcripts of these
435.208	private FBI conversations
435.208	that a federal judge had sealed
438.155	based on the government's claim 
438.155	that their release
440.556	would irreparably damage 
440.556	the U.S. government's
442.748	law enforcement strategy.
444.852	So a place like The Intercept
444.852	was set up to protect journalists
447.831	and publish their work
448.89	when they're dealing with 
448.89	very sensitive matters like this.
451.719	So my story in The Intercept, 
451.719	which was just published today,
454.618	tells the story of how Sami Osmakac
454.618	was set up in this FBI sting
457.953	and goes into much greater detail.
459.633	In this talk, I could only
459.633	highlight the things that they said,
462.597	"such as calling him a ""retarded fool."""
464.434	But it was much more elaborate,
465.916	they went to great lengths
465.916	to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,
469.012	which he then used to purchase weapons
469.012	from the undercover agent.
472.068	When he went to trial,
473.208	the central piece of evidence 
473.208	was that he paid for these weapons,
476.339	when in truth, these transcripts show
476.339	how the FBI orchestrated
479.26	someone who was essentially
479.26	mentally ill and broke
481.66	to get money to then 
481.66	pay for weapons
483.879	that they could then charge him
483.879	in a conspiracy for.
486.387	TR: One final question.
488.514	Less than 10 days ago,
490.035	the FBI arrested some potential 
490.035	ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,
493.187	saying that they might
493.187	be headed to Syria,
496.725	and were those real,
496.725	or examples of more of the same?
499.622	TA: Well so far, we only know
499.622	what's come out in the court file,
502.636	but they seem to suggest it's another
502.636	example of the same.
505.641	These types of sting operations 
505.641	have moved from flavor to flavor.
508.823	So initially it was al Qaeda plots,
510.991	and now the Islamic State
510.991	is the current flavor.
513.305	What's worth noting about that case
513.305	is that the three men that were charged
516.874	only began the plot to go to Syria
518.724	after the introduction
518.724	of the FBI informant,
520.801	and in fact, the FBI informant had helped
520.801	them with the travel documents
524.251	that they needed.
525.167	In kind of a comical turn 
525.167	in that particular case,
527.784	one of the defendant's mother
527.784	had found out
529.85	that he was interested in going to Syria
529.85	and had hid his passport.
533.016	So it's unclear that even if he had
533.016	showed up at the airport,
535.949	that he ever could have gone anywhere.
537.777	So yes, there are people who might
537.777	be interested in joining the Islamic State
541.42	in the United States,
542.428	and those are people that the United 
542.428	States government should be looking at
546.05	to see if they're interested
546.05	in violence here.
548.329	In this particular case, given
548.329	the evidence that's so far come out,
551.509	it suggests the FBI made
551.509	it possible for these guys
553.904	to move along in a plan to go to Syria
555.984	when they were never close 
555.984	to that in the first place.
558.592	TR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing.
558.592	TA: Thank you.
560.825	(Applause)
