13.058	Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle
16.636	that weighs less than a bicycle,
20.542	that you can carry with you anywhere,
23.888	that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,
28.38	and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers
30.628	on about a dollar of electricity.
32.98	But when I say the word electric vehicle,
35.268	people think about vehicles. They think about cars
38.156	and motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.
41.874	But if you come about it from a different perspective,
44.17	you can create some more interesting,
46.472	more novel concepts.
49.152	So we built something.
51.408	I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.
54.102	So this is the motor.
56.192	This motor has enough power to take you
57.801	up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,
61.608	about 30 kilometers an hour,
63.434	and this battery, this battery right here
67.524	has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,
71.472	which is enough to cover about half of the car trips
74.275	in the U.S. alone.
76.672	But the best part about these components
78.451	is that we bought them at a toy store.
80.648	These are from remote control airplanes.
83.072	And the performance of these things has gotten so good
85.216	that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,
87.512	you can really change things.
89.015	So today we're going to show you one example
91.012	of how you can use this.
93.089	Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is,
95.888	but also how the portability that comes with this
98.966	can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

176.517	(Cheers)
180.829	So we're going to show you what this thing can do.
184.122	It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,
186.815	so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,
190.394	go in reverse if you like, also have braking.
201.431	It's incredible just how light this thing is.
203.488	I mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you
205.617	anywhere you go.
208.553	So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts
211.729	about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.
214.585	This uses 20 times less energy
217.977	for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,
221.344	which means not only is this thing fast to charge
224.977	and really cheap to build,
226.666	but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use
230.017	in terms of your transportation.
231.652	So instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed
234.411	for each person in this room to get around in a city,
237.345	now you can look at much smaller amounts
239.465	and more sustainable transportation.
241.905	So next time you think about a vehicle,
243.267	I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.
246.573	Thank you.
247.711	(Applause)
