14.048	I'm going to tell you a little bit
14.048	about my TEDxHouston Talk.
17.841	I woke up the morning
17.841	after I gave that talk
21.404	with the worst vulnerability
21.404	hangover of my life.
26.346	And I actually didn't leave my house
26.346	for about three days.
32.092	The first time I left
32.092	was to meet a friend for lunch.
35.787	And when I walked in,
35.787	she was already at the table.
38.233	I sat down, and she said,
38.233	"""God, you look like hell."""
41.541	"I said, ""Thanks. I feel really --"
44.54	"I'm not functioning."""
46.152	"And she said, ""What's going on?"""
48.35	"And I said, ""I just told 500 people"
53.967	that I became a researcher
53.967	to avoid vulnerability.
57.586	And that when being vulnerable
57.586	emerged from my data,
62.066	as absolutely essential
62.066	to whole-hearted living,
66.669	I told these 500 people
66.669	that I had a breakdown.
70.716	I had a slide that said 'Breakdown.'
72.502	At what point did I think
72.502	"that was a good idea?"""
75	(Laughter)
78.145	"And she said, ""I saw"
78.145	your talk live-streamed.
80.327	It was not really you.
82.643	It was a little different
82.643	than what you usually do.
85.049	"But it was great."""
86.885	And I said,
88.401	"""This can't happen."
90	YouTube, they're putting
90	this thing on YouTube.
92.765	And we're going to be talking
92.765	"about 600, 700 people."""
96.936	(Laughter)
100.746	And she said,
100.746	"""Well, I think it's too late."""
103.897	"And I said, ""Let me ask you something."""
106.201	"And she said, ""Yeah."""
107.677	"I said, ""Do you remember"
107.677	when we were in college,
109.994	"really wild and kind of dumb?"""
112.059	"She said, ""Yeah."""
113.089	"I said, ""Remember when"
113.089	we'd leave a really bad message
115.739	on our ex-boyfriend's answering machine?
118.137	Then we'd have to break into his dorm room
118.137	"and then erase the tape?"""
121.769	(Laughter)
124.19	"And she goes, ""Uh... no."""
126.92	(Laughter)
129.154	Of course, the only thing
129.154	I could say at that point was,
131.804	"""Yeah, me neither."
134.133	"Yeah -- me neither."""
136.849	And I'm thinking to myself,
140.158	"""Bren√©, what are you doing?"
142	Why did you bring this up?
144.249	Have you lost your mind?
145.874	"Your sisters would be perfect for this."""
148.183	(Laughter)
149.612	So I looked back up and she said,
152.766	"""Are you really going to try"
152.766	to break in and steal the video
157.544	"before they put it on YouTube?"""
159.144	(Laughter)
160.656	"And I said, ""I'm just thinking"
160.656	"about it a little bit."""
163.64	(Laughter)
165.426	"She said, ""You're like the worst"
165.426	"vulnerability role model ever."""
170.003	(Laughter)
172.937	Then I looked at her and I said something
174.929	that at the time felt a little dramatic,
176.881	but ended up being
176.881	more prophetic than dramatic.
180.793	"""If 500 turns into 1,000"
184.762	or 2,000,
186.246	"my life is over."""
188.594	(Laughter)
190.856	I had no contingency plan
190.856	for four million.
193.341	(Laughter)
197.883	And my life did end when that happened.
200.875	And maybe the hardest part
200.875	about my life ending
204	is that I learned something
204	hard about myself,
208.971	and that was that,
211.439	as much as I would be frustrated
213	about not being able to get
213	my work out to the world,
215.548	there was a part of me
215.548	that was working very hard
218	to engineer staying small,
221.56	staying right under the radar.
225.761	But I want to talk
225.761	about what I've learned.
227.918	There's two things
227.918	that I've learned in the last year.
231.287	The first is:
234.468	vulnerability is not weakness.
239.295	And that myth is profoundly dangerous.
244.283	Let me ask you honestly --
246.029	and I'll give you this warning,
247.861	I'm trained as a therapist,
249.171	so I can out-wait you uncomfortably --
252	so if you could just raise your hand
252	that would be awesome --
255.469	how many of you honestly,
257	when you're thinking about doing
257	or saying something vulnerable
260.858	"think, ""God, vulnerability is weakness."""
263.311	How many of you think of vulnerability
263.311	and weakness synonymously?
267.319	The majority of people.
269.136	Now let me ask you this question:
270.775	This past week at TED,
273.374	how many of you,
273.374	when you saw vulnerability up here,
276	thought it was pure courage?
280.708	Vulnerability is not weakness.
283.43	I define vulnerability as emotional risk,
288.234	exposure, uncertainty.
291.425	It fuels our daily lives.
293.611	And I've come to the belief --
295.183	this is my 12th year
295.183	doing this research --
297.452	that vulnerability is our most accurate
297.452	measurement of courage --
305.929	to be vulnerable,
305.929	to let ourselves be seen,
308.461	to be honest.
310.663	One of the weird things that's happened
310.663	is, after the TED explosion,
314.342	I got a lot of offers to speak
314.342	all over the country --
317.999	everyone from schools and parent meetings
320.385	to Fortune 500 companies.
323	And so many of the calls went like this,
325.441	"""Dr. Brown, we loved your TED talk."
327.215	We'd like you to come in and speak.
329.557	We'd appreciate it
331	if you wouldn't mention
331	"vulnerability or shame."""
333.356	(Laughter)
338.739	What would you like for me to talk about?
342.089	There's three big answers.
343.517	This is mostly, to be honest with you,
343.517	from the business sector:
346.667	innovation, creativity and change.
350.482	(Laughter)
352.514	So let me go on the record and say,
356.458	vulnerability is the birthplace
356.458	of innovation, creativity and change.
361.652	(Applause)
369.855	To create is to make something
369.855	that has never existed before.
375.704	There's nothing more vulnerable than that.
378.681	Adaptability to change
378.681	is all about vulnerability.
383.466	The second thing,
384.579	in addition to really
384.579	finally understanding
388.409	the relationship between
388.409	vulnerability and courage,
390.836	the second thing I learned, is this:
393.972	We have to talk about shame.
398.285	And I'm going to be
398.285	really honest with you.
400.817	"When I became a ""vulnerability researcher"""
404.365	and that became the focus
404.365	because of the TED talk --
407.124	and I'm not kidding.
408.92	I'll give you an example.
411.132	About three months ago,
411.132	I was in a sporting goods store
414.069	buying goggles and shin guards
415.522	and all the things that parents buy
415.522	at the sporting goods store.
419.121	About from a hundred feet away,
419.121	this is what I hear:
421.994	"""Vulnerability TED! Vulnerability TED!"""
424.649	(Laughter)
430.545	(Laughter ends)
431.57	I'm a fifth-generation Texan.
434.669	"Our family motto is ""Lock and load."""
437.248	I am not a natural
437.248	vulnerability researcher.
442.43	So I'm like,
444	just keep walking, she's on my six.
446.978	(Laughter)
448.422	"And then I hear, ""Vulnerability TED!"""
452.684	"I turn around, I go, ""Hi."""
455.255	She's right here and she said,
457.909	"""You're the shame researcher"
457.909	"who had the breakdown."""
460.719	(Laughter)
464.557	At this point, parents are, like,
464.557	pulling their children close.
469.303	(Laughter)
470.428	"""Look away."""
474.612	And I'm so worn out
474.612	at this point in my life,
476.992	I look at her and I actually say,
478.727	"""It was a fricking spiritual awakening."""
481.385	(Laughter)
483	(Applause)
485.345	And she looks back and does this,
488.226	"""I know."""
489.274	(Laughter)
490.299	And she said,
492.114	"""We watched your TED talk in my book club."
495.116	Then we read your book
495.116	and we renamed ourselves
498.489	"'The Breakdown Babes.'"""
500.49	(Laughter)
501.753	"And she said, ""Our tagline is:"
503.789	'We're falling apart
503.789	"and it feels fantastic.'"""
507	(Laughter)
510.853	You can only imagine what it's like
510.853	for me in a faculty meeting.
514.925	(Sighs)
517.433	So when I became Vulnerability TED,
520.359	like an action figure --
522.922	Like Ninja Barbie,
522.922	but I'm Vulnerability TED --
526.938	I thought, I'm going to leave
526.938	that shame stuff behind,
529.641	because I spent six years studying shame
532.609	before I started writing
532.609	and talking about vulnerability.
535.474	And I thought, thank God,
535.474	because shame is this horrible topic,
538.566	no one wants to talk about it.
540.156	It's the best way to shut
540.156	people down on an airplane.
542.658	"""What do you do?"" ""I study shame."" ""Oh."""
544.621	(Laughter)
546.868	And I see you.
548	(Laughter)
554.268	But in surviving this last year,
558.278	I was reminded of a cardinal rule --
560.953	not a research rule,
563	but a moral imperative
563	from my upbringing --
567.249	"""you've got to dance"
567.249	"with the one who brung ya""."
571.329	And I did not learn about vulnerability
573.827	and courage and creativity and innovation
576.918	from studying vulnerability.
579.744	I learned about these things
579.744	from studying shame.
583.532	And so I want to walk you in to shame.
587.77	Jungian analysts call shame
587.77	the swampland of the soul.
593.386	And we're going to walk in.
595.1	And the purpose is not to walk in
597	and construct a home and live there.
600.124	It is to put on some galoshes --
603.848	and walk through and find our way around.
609.023	Here's why.
612.387	We heard the most compelling call ever
612.387	to have a conversation in this country,
617.617	and I think globally, around race, right?
622.184	Yes? We heard that.
623.696	Yes?
625.347	Cannot have that conversation
625.347	without shame.
628.791	Because you cannot talk about race
628.791	without talking about privilege.
632.281	And when people start
632.281	talking about privilege,
634.448	they get paralyzed by shame.
636.812	We heard a brilliant simple solution
636.812	to not killing people in surgery,
640.986	which is, have a checklist.
643.24	You can't fix that problem
643.24	without addressing shame,
646.006	because when they teach
646.006	those folks how to suture,
649	they also teach them
649	how to stitch their self-worth
652.38	to being all-powerful.
654.507	And all-powerful folks
654.507	don't need checklists.
659.577	And I had to write down
659.577	the name of this TED Fellow
661.982	so I didn't mess it up here.
664.212	Myshkin Ingawale,
666.045	I hope I did right by you.
667.807	(Applause)
670.919	I saw the TED Fellows my first day here.
672.875	And he got up and he explained
672.875	how he was driven to create
676.265	some technology to help test for anemia,
678.463	because people were dying unnecessarily.
681.408	"And he said, ""I saw this need."
682.929	"So you know what I did? I made it."""
684.92	And everybody just burst into applause,
684.92	"and they were like ""Yes!"""
688.199	"And he said, ""And it didn't work."
689.918	(Laughter)
691.071	And then I made it 32 more times,
694.826	"and then it worked."""
696.715	You know what the big secret about TED is?
699.033	I can't wait to tell people this.
700.63	I guess I'm doing it right now.
702.348	(Laughter)
704.476	This is like the failure conference.
706.523	(Laughter)
707.801	No, it is.
708.97	(Applause)
711.753	You know why this place is amazing?
714.978	Because very few people here
714.978	are afraid to fail.
719.185	And no one who gets on the stage,
719.185	so far that I've seen, has not failed.
722.927	I've failed miserably, many times.
725.768	I don't think the world understands that,
728.379	because of shame.
730.718	There's a great quote
730.718	that saved me this past year
733.101	by Theodore Roosevelt.
734.518	A lot of people refer to it
734.518	"as the ""Man in the Arena"" quote."
738.604	And it goes like this:
740	"""It is not the critic who counts."
742.835	It is not the man who sits and points out
745.43	how the doer of deeds
745.43	could have done things better
747.933	and how he falls and stumbles.
749.948	The credit goes to the man in the arena
753.039	whose face is marred
753.039	with dust and blood and sweat.
757.888	But when he's in the arena,
761.3	at best, he wins,
763.49	and at worst, he loses,
765.374	but when he fails, when he loses,
767.643	"he does so daring greatly."""
771.228	And that's what this conference,
771.228	to me, is about.
773.873	Life is about daring greatly,
773.873	about being in the arena.
777.46	When you walk up to that arena
777.46	and you put your hand on the door,
780.533	"and you think, ""I'm going in"
780.533	"and I'm going to try this,"""
783.208	shame is the gremlin
784.607	"who says, ""Uh, uh."
786.853	You're not good enough.
788.583	You never finished that MBA.
788.583	Your wife left you.
791.948	I know your dad really
791.948	wasn't in Luxembourg,
794.02	he was in Sing Sing.
797.461	I know those things
797.461	that happened to you growing up.
800.986	I know you don't think
802.471	that you're pretty, smart,
802.471	talented or powerful enough.
805.352	I know your dad never paid attention,
805.352	"even when you made CFO."""
809.884	Shame is that thing.
812.417	And if we can quiet it down and walk in
815.861	"and say, ""I'm going to do this,"""
819.449	we look up and the critic
819.449	that we see pointing and laughing,
826.635	Us.
829.302	Shame drives two big tapes --
831	"""never good enough"" --"
833.846	and, if you can talk it out of that one,
835.973	"""who do you think you are?"""
839.339	The thing to understand
839.339	about shame is, it's not guilt.
842.147	Shame is a focus on self,
842.147	guilt is a focus on behavior.
844.982	"Shame is ""I am bad."""
846.687	"Guilt is ""I did something bad."""
849.767	How many of you,
851	if you did something
851	that was hurtful to me,
853.259	would be willing to say,
853.259	"""I'm sorry. I made a mistake?"""
856.124	How many of you would be
856.124	willing to say that?
858.641	Guilt: I'm sorry. I made a mistake.
861.387	Shame: I'm sorry. I am a mistake.
865.387	There's a huge difference
865.387	between shame and guilt.
867.974	And here's what you need to know.
869.966	Shame is highly, highly correlated
872.434	with addiction, depression,
872.434	violence, aggression,
875.685	bullying, suicide, eating disorders.
879.375	And here's what you even
879.375	need to know more.
881.604	Guilt, inversely correlated
881.604	with those things.
886.623	The ability to hold something
886.623	we've done or failed to do
890.083	up against who we want to be
890.083	is incredibly adaptive.
893.495	It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
899.499	The other thing you need
899.499	to know about shame
901.571	is it's absolutely organized by gender.
905.214	If shame washes over me
905.214	and washes over Chris,
908.06	it's going to feel the same.
910.338	Everyone sitting in here knows
910.338	the warm wash of shame.
913.553	We're pretty sure that the only people
913.553	who don't experience shame
916.625	are people who have no capacity
916.625	for connection or empathy.
920.125	Which means, yes, I have a little shame;
922.054	no, I'm a sociopath.
923.57	So I would opt for, yes,
923.57	you have a little shame.
929.574	Shame feels the same for men and women,
931.613	but it's organized by gender.
934.105	For women,
936.2	the best example I can give you
936.2	is Enjoli, the commercial.
941.91	"""I can put the wash on the line,"
941.91	pack the lunches, hand out the kisses
945.22	and be at work at five to nine.
948.037	I can bring home the bacon,
948.037	fry it up in the pan
950.373	"and never let you forget you're a man."""
953.483	For women, shame is, do it all,
955.995	do it perfectly
957.111	and never let them see you sweat.
960.504	I don't know how much perfume
960.504	that commercial sold,
963	but I guarantee you,
964.68	it moved a lot of antidepressants
964.68	and anti-anxiety meds.
967.691	(Laughter)
971.654	Shame, for women, is this web
974.376	of unobtainable, conflicting,
974.376	competing expectations
978.268	about who we're supposed to be.
981.506	And it's a straight-jacket.
983.784	For men,
985	shame is not a bunch of competing,
985	conflicting expectations.
988.449	Shame is one,
990.158	do not be perceived as what?
993.213	Weak.
995.168	I did not interview men
995.168	for the first four years of my study.
998.442	It wasn't until a man looked at me
998.442	after a book signing, and said,
1001.724	"""I love what say about shame,"
1003.276	"I'm curious why you didn't mention men."""
1005.253	"And I said, ""I don't study men."""
1007.258	"And he said, ""That's convenient."""
1010.313	(Laughter)
1013.304	"And I said, ""Why?"""
1014.471	"And he said, ""Because"
1014.471	you say to reach out,
1017.326	tell our story,
1019.717	be vulnerable.
1022.278	But you see those books you just signed
1022.278	"for my wife and my three daughters?"""
1027.139	"I said, ""Yeah."""
1029.084	"""They'd rather me die"
1029.084	on top of my white horse
1031.305	than watch me fall down.
1035.235	When we reach out and be vulnerable,
1037	we get the shit beat out of us.
1040.29	And don't tell me
1041.632	it's from the guys
1041.632	and the coaches and the dads.
1046.033	Because the women in my life
1046.033	"are harder on me than anyone else."""
1050.36	So I started interviewing men
1050.36	and asking questions.
1053.864	And what I learned is this:
1056.566	You show me a woman
1056.566	who can actually sit with a man
1058.971	in real vulnerability and fear,
1061.031	I'll show you a woman
1061.031	who's done incredible work.
1064.388	You show me a man who can sit with a woman
1066.873	who's just had it,
1068.68	she can't do it all anymore,
1072.156	and his first response is not,
1074.029	"""I unloaded the dishwasher!"""
1076.497	(Laughter)
1077.536	But he really listens --
1079.521	because that's all we need --
1081	I'll show you a guy
1081	who's done a lot of work.
1084.006	Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
1088.696	And to get out from underneath it --
1093.44	to find our way back to each other,
1095.797	we have to understand how it affects us
1097.702	and how it affects
1097.702	the way we're parenting,
1100.429	the way we're working,
1100.429	the way we're looking at each other.
1104.851	Very quickly, some research
1104.851	by Mahalik at Boston College.
1108.279	He asked, what do women need to do
1108.279	to conform to female norms?
1111.624	The top answers in this country:
1115.532	nice, thin, modest
1117	and use all available
1117	resources for appearance.
1119.266	(Laughter)
1121.083	When he asked about men,
1122.42	what do men in this country need to do
1122.42	to conform with male norms,
1126.872	the answers were:
1128.453	always show emotional control,
1130.493	work is first,
1132.071	pursue status and violence.
1135.42	If we're going to find
1135.42	our way back to each other,
1137.877	we have to understand and know empathy,
1140	because empathy's the antidote to shame.
1142.619	If you put shame in a Petri dish,
1144.936	it needs three things
1144.936	to grow exponentially:
1147.269	secrecy, silence and judgment.
1149.661	If you put the same amount in a Petri dish
1149.661	and douse it with empathy,
1152.939	it can't survive.
1154.343	The two most powerful words
1154.343	when we're in struggle:
1157.675	me too.
1159.707	And so I'll leave you with this thought.
1163.008	If we're going to find our way
1163.008	back to each other,
1167.414	vulnerability is going to be that path.
1171.401	And I know it's seductive
1171.401	to stand outside the arena,
1173.938	because I think I did it my whole life,
1175.823	and think to myself,
1177.1	I'm going to go in there and kick some ass
1179.587	when I'm bulletproof and when I'm perfect.
1184.102	And that is seductive.
1185.436	But the truth is, that never happens.
1188.859	And even if you got
1188.859	as perfect as you could
1191.041	and as bulletproof as you
1191.041	could possibly muster
1193.653	when you got in there,
1194.772	that's not what we want to see.
1198.743	We want you to go in.
1201.743	We want to be with you
1201.743	and across from you.
1205.116	And we just want,
1206.832	for ourselves and the people we care about
1209.232	and the people we work with,
1211.082	to dare greatly.
1212.463	So thank you all very much.
1212.463	I really appreciate it.
1215	(Applause)
