15.767	My big idea is a very, very small idea
19.682	that can unlock billions of big ideas
24.459	that are at the moment dormant inside us.
27.849	And my little idea
27.849	that will do that is sleep.
31.697	(Laughter)
33.26	(Applause)
37.497	This is a room of type A women.
42.029	This is a room of sleep-deprived women.
46.991	And I learned the hard way
46.991	the value of sleep.
51.204	Two-and-a-half years ago,
51.204	I fainted from exhaustion.
54.338	I hit my head on my desk.
56.148	I broke my cheekbone,
56.148	I got five stitches on my right eye.
60.363	And I began the journey
60.363	of rediscovering the value of sleep.
66.221	And in the course of that, I studied,
69.151	I met with medical doctors, scientists,
71.753	and I'm here to tell you
73.656	that the way to a more productive,
73.656	more inspired, more joyful life
79.216	is getting enough sleep.
81.656	(Applause)
86.872	And we women are going to lead the way
89.462	in this new revolution,
89.462	this new feminist issue.
93.26	We are literally going to sleep
93.26	our way to the top -- literally --
97.168	(Laughter)
98.653	(Applause)
104.028	because unfortunately, for men,
107.363	sleep deprivation has become
107.363	a virility symbol.
111.471	I was recently having dinner with a guy
113.685	who bragged that he had only gotten
113.685	four hours sleep the night before.
118.182	And I felt like saying to him --
118.182	but I didn't say --
120.779	"I felt like saying, ""You know what?"
120.779	if you had gotten five,
123.93	this dinner would have been
123.93	"a lot more interesting."""
126.503	(Laughter)
130.487	There is now a kind
130.487	of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.
134.561	Especially here in Washington,
134.561	if you try to make a breakfast date,
137.733	"and you say, ""How about eight o'clock?"""
139.63	they're likely to tell you,
139.63	"""Eight o'clock is too late for me,"
142.617	but that's OK, I can get
142.617	a game of tennis in
144.706	and do a few conference calls
144.706	"and meet you at eight."""
147.241	And they think that means they are
147.241	so incredibly busy and productive,
152.088	but the truth is, they're not,
154.634	because we, at the moment,
156.26	have had brilliant leaders
156.26	in business, in finance, in politics,
162.145	making terrible decisions.
165.125	So a high IQ does not mean
165.125	that you're a good leader,
169.511	because the essence of leadership
169.511	is being able to see the iceberg
173.759	before it hits the Titanic.
175.639	(Laughter)
177.406	And we've had far too many icebergs
177.406	hitting our Titanics.
181.701	In fact, I have a feeling
183.927	that if Lehman Brothers
183.927	was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,
187.412	they might still be around.
188.897	(Laughter)
190.349	(Applause)
192.45	While all the brothers were busy
192.45	just being hyper-connected 24/7,
198.035	maybe a sister would have
198.035	noticed the iceberg,
200.396	because she would have woken up
201.959	from a seven-and-a-half-
201.959	or eight-hour sleep,
204.959	and have been able to see the big picture.
208.897	So as we are facing
208.897	all the multiple crises
213.099	in our world at the moment,
215.528	what is good for us on a personal level,
218.369	what's going to bring more joy,
218.369	gratitude, effectiveness in our lives
223.93	and be the best for our own careers,
226.434	is also what is best for the world.
229.744	So I urge you to shut your eyes,
234.57	and discover the great ideas
234.57	that lie inside us;
238.54	to shut your engines
238.54	and discover the power of sleep.
241.974	Thank you.
243.26	(Applause)
