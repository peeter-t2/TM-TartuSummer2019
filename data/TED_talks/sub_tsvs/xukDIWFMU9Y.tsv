15.692	Now, I don't usually like cartoons,
18.414	I don't think many of them are funny,
20.924	I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.
26.147	(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)
28.759	So, the guy is telling the cat,
31.228	don't you dare think outside the box.
36.599	Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.
39.906	I always wanted to be outside the box.
42.964	And it's partly because I came to this field
46.446	from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.
51.659	So, what people were saying to me
54.261	about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,
57.452	or, for that matter, why you are who you are,
60.533	didn't make sense.
62.407	So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that
65.454	and how I went about it.
68.055	So, to begin with, however,
70.487	I have to give you a very, very quick lesson
74.913	in developmental biology,
76.68	with apologies to those of you who know some biology.
80.742	So, when your mom and dad met,
83.756	there is a fertilized egg,
86.43	that round thing with that little blip.
88.551	It grows and then it grows,
91.606	and then it makes this handsome man.
95.759	(Applause)
97.174	So, this guy, with all the cells in his body,
102.832	all have the same genetic information.
107.044	So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,
111.419	and why doesn't he get up one morning
113.595	and have his nose turn into his foot?
116.155	It could. It has the genetic information.
119.395	You all remember, dolly,
120.603	it came from a single mammary cell.
123.284	So, why doesn't it do it?
125.218	So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.
130.721	Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.
138.123	Trillion!
139.763	Now, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,
144.401	make all those tissues?
146.609	And so, the question I raised before
149.753	becomes even more interesting if you thought about
153.367	the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.
157.953	Now, the dominant cancer theory would say
160.953	that there is a single oncogene
163.265	in a single cancer cell, and it would make you
166.969	a cancer victim.
169.618	Well, this did not make sense to me.
173.284	Do you even know how a trillion looks?
176.466	Now, let's look at it.
178.185	There it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.
183.226	Now, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,
190.044	and .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.
195.301	You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.
197.597	Why not?
199.906	So, I decided over the years,
203.628	because of a series of experiments
205.556	that this is because of context and architecture.
210.436	And let me quickly tell you
212.613	some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.
216.54	To begin with, I came to work with this virus
220.451	that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.
223.844	Rous discovered this in 1911.
227.204	It was the first cancer virus discovered,
230.769	"and when I call it ""oncogene,"" meaning ""cancer gene."""
235.66	So, he made a filtrate, he took this filter
238.572	which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,
242.828	and he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.
246.829	So, scientists were very excited,
249.54	and they said, a single oncogene can do it.
251.708	All you need is a single oncogene.
254.004	So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,
256.899	dumped the virus on it,
258.934	and it would pile up,
260.383	and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
263.404	And again this didn't make sense to me.
265.422	So for various reasons, we took this oncogene,
268.708	attached it to a blue marker,
271.02	and we injected it into the embryos.
274.028	Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
278.221	Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene
282.5	inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
286.916	So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,
291.516	we got a mass of blue cells.
294.228	So, in the chicken you get a tumor,
295.694	in the embryo you don't,
297.398	you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.
301.39	What does that mean?
302.613	That means that microenvironment
305.597	and the context which surrounds those cells
309.606	actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.
316.533	Now, let's take a normal example.
319.845	The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
323.03	I work on breast cancer.
324.51	So, here is a lovely human breast.
327.517	And many of you know how it looks,
329.465	except that inside that breast, there are all these
332.318	pretty, developing, tree-like structures.
335.695	So, we decided that what we like to do
338.593	is take just a bit of that mammary gland,
341.553	"which is called an ""acinus,"""
343.585	where there are all these little things inside the breast
347.226	where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple
350.769	comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.
354.313	And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.
357.72	We want to make this a structure, and ask the question,
361.489	how do the cells do that?
363.193	So, we took the red cells --
364.985	you see the red cells are surrounded by blue,
368.233	other cells that squeeze them, and behind it
371.562	is material that people thought was mainly inert,
375.28	and it was just having a structure to keep the shape,
378.877	and so we first photographed it
381.805	with the electron microscope years and years ago,
384.573	and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
387.629	It has a bottom, it has a top,
390.092	it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,
392.773	because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.
395.965	You take these cells, you put them in a dish,
398.292	and within three days, they look like that.
401.637	They completely forget.
404.797	So you take them out, you put them in a dish,
407.597	they don't make milk. They completely forget.
410.26	For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk
415.159	on the left, there is nothing on the right.
417.414	Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left
421.143	is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.
424.639	They are completely different from each other.
427.375	So, what does this tell you?
429.4	This tells you that here also, context overrides.
434.367	In different contexts, cells do different things.
437.752	But how does context signal?
440.497	So, Einstein said that
443.039	"""For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."""
449.692	So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism
455.652	I received -- couldn't get money,
458.053	couldn't do a whole lot of other things,
459.996	but I'm so glad it all worked out.
461.725	So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,
465.54	and all those lovely acini are there,
468.723	every one of those with the red around them are an acinus,
472.934	and we said okay, we are going to try and make this,
476.628	and I said, maybe that red stuff
479.86	around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,
484.985	maybe it has information,
486.925	maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.
491.491	So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff
495.774	called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.
500.165	So, we decided to make things that would look like that.
503.932	We found some gooey material
506.812	that had the right extracellular matrix in it,
509.687	we put the cells in it, and lo and behold,
512.226	in about four days, they got reorganized
515.047	and on the right, is what we can make in culture.
518.455	On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,
522.951	and the one in culture was full of milk,
525.535	the lovely red there is full of milk.
528.335	So, we Got Milk, for the American audience.
531.751	All right. And here is this beautiful human cell,
537.095	and you can imagine that here also, context goes.
542.041	So, what do we do now?
544.757	I made a radical hypothesis.
546.981	I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,
553.644	architecture restored to a cancer cell
558.13	should make the cancer cell think it's normal.
561.119	Could this be done?
562.603	So, we tried it.
565.131	In order to do that, however,
567.169	we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,
572.054	and on the left is the single normal cell,
576.051	human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel
580.014	that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.
583.878	On the right, you see it looks very ugly,
586.766	the cells continue to grow,
588.414	the normal ones stop.
589.99	And you see here in higher magnification
592.822	the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.
597.174	So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?
601.398	Could we calm them down --
603.566	they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up --
608.486	and make them to the level of the normal?
611.55	Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.
616.27	This is what we got.
618.431	We can revert the malignant phenotype.
622.11	(Applause)
624.678	And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype
627.79	I didn't just choose one,
629.508	here are little movies, sort of fuzzy,
632.278	but you see that on the left are the malignant cells,
635.934	all of them are malignant,
637.278	we add one single inhibitor in the beginning,
642.078	and look what happens, they all look like that.
645.535	We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,
648.982	and none of them would make tumors.
651.222	We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.
654.758	So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,
657.43	it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.
659.83	We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,
663.806	and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior
669.718	is regulated at the level of tissue organization
673.59	and that the tissue organization is dependent
677.582	on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.
681.278	All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.
688.909	And here is another five seconds of repose,
693.029	is my mantra. Form and function.
697.451	And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?
701.097	We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.
704.092	But before we do that, I'd like you to think
708.016	that at any given time when you're sitting there,
711.604	in your 70 trillion cells,
714.617	the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,
718.09	the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix
721.168	and this is how your balance is kept and restored.
727.162	We have made a lot of discoveries,
729.377	we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.
732.465	We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA
735.912	on the specific genes of the mammary gland
739.735	that actually respond to extracellular matrix.
742.599	It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.
746.296	And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you
750.687	that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.
755.799	There is so much mystery we don't know.
758.327	And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,
762.688	don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
768.351	Curiosity and passion.
770.543	You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
774.44	And maybe my discovery needs to be added to
777.415	or maybe it needs to be changed.
779.207	So, we have now made an amazing discovery,
782.711	a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,
785.815	what do the cells do when you put them in?
787.992	What do they do in the beginning when they do?
791.286	I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.
792.767	We didn't have high images in the old days.
795.36	So she, being an imager and a physicist,
798.055	did this incredible thing.
799.799	This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.
804.175	Look at it. It's constantly doing this.
806.703	Has a coherent movement.
808.799	You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,
813.133	they do this. They don't do this.
815.037	And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.
819.045	Absolutely boggles my mind.
821.229	So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.
826.573	So I'd like to finish with a poem.
829.429	Well I used to love English literature,
832.493	and I debated in college, which one should I do?
835.1	And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
839.712	But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
845.436	"It's called ""Among the School Children."""
848.095	"""O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /"
852.616	"How [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"""
855.766	And here is Merce Cunningham,
857.677	I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,
860.661	and here he is a dancer,
862.854	and while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.
866.158	The minute he stops, we have neither.
869.859	So it's like form and function.
873.333	Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.
879.112	I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant
882.64	students and post-docs who have taught me so much,
885.864	and I have had many of these groups come and go.
889.127	They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid
893.704	of being the cat and being told,
897.407	don't think outside the box.
899	And I'd like to leave you with this thought.
901.495	On the left is water coming through the shore,
906.24	taken from a NASA satellite.
908.135	On the right, there is a coral.
911.184	Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it
915.186	and take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.
918.631	Do they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?
921.983	Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?
925.935	And I'd like to submit to you
928.295	that we have sequenced the human genome,
930.472	we know everything about the sequence of the gene,
933.352	the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,
935.783	But we know nothing, but nothing,
939.022	about the language and alphabet of form.
943.685	So, it's a wonderful new horizon,
946.729	it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young
950.479	and the passionate old, and that's me.
952.959	So go to it!
955.007	(Applause)
