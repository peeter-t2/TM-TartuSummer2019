12.643	Once upon a time,
15.535	there was a place called Lesterland.
18.975	Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.
21.93	Like the United States, it has about 311 million people,
26.667	and of that 311 million people,
29.005	it turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
33.888	If Matt's in the audience,
35.016	I just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,
37.706	this character from your series.
40.371	So 144,000 are called Lester,
42.794	which means about .05 percent is named Lester.
47.074	Now, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.
50.802	There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.
53.965	One is called the general election.
56.178	The other is called the Lester election.
59.519	And in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
62.504	but in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.
65.776	And here's the trick.
66.91	In order to run in the general election,
70.561	you must do extremely well
73.107	in the Lester election.
74.48	You don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
77.581	Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?
81.531	What we can say, number one,
82.924	as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
85.56	that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,
89.838	because, after all, there is a general election,
92.486	but only after the Lesters have had their way
95.438	with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
98.94	And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters
102.543	is going to produce a subtle, understated,
105.305	we could say camouflaged, bending
107.734	to keep the Lesters happy.
110.925	Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,
114.194	but it's dependent upon the Lesters
115.87	and dependent upon the people.
117.88	It has competing dependencies,
120.522	we could say conflicting dependencies,
122.932	depending upon who the Lesters are.
127.202	Okay. That's Lesterland.
129.546	Now there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.
132.305	Number one, the United States is Lesterland.
135.546	The United States is Lesterland.
137.422	The United States also looks like this, also has two elections,
139.803	one we called the general election,
142.942	the second we should call the money election.
146.186	In the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
148.352	if you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.
150.946	In the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,
154.162	the funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,
156.922	the trick is, to run in the general election,
159.081	you must do extremely well in the money election.
161.901	You don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.
164.522	But you must do extremely well.
167.074	And here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders
171.602	in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.
177.091	Now you say, really?
178.995	Really .05 percent?
182.138	Well, here are the numbers from 2010:
184.354	.26 percent of America
186.65	gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,
189.386	.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,
193.85	.01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent --
197.282	gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,
200.49	and in this election cycle, my favorite statistic
203.566	is .000042 percent
207.421	— for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans —
211.458	gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent
215.418	in the cycle we have just seen ending.
218.168	So I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,
220.898	and I say it's fair for me to say
222.607	it's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.
226.858	In this sense, the funders are our Lesters.
230.16	Now, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?
233.66	Well, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
236.002	we could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence
238.839	over the elected officials. We have a general election,
242.868	but only after the funders have had their way
246.077	with the candidates who wish to run in that general election.
250.24	And number two, obviously,
252.763	this dependence upon the funders
255.035	produces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending
258.967	to keep the funders happy.
261.604	Candidates for Congress and members of Congress
264.648	spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time
268.931	raising money to get back to Congress
271.107	or to get their party back into power,
272.882	and the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,
276.307	these humans, as they spend their time
278.424	behind the telephone, calling people they've never met,
281.843	but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
285.311	As anyone would, as they do this,
287.679	they develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness
291.527	about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.
294.867	"They become, in the words of ""The X-Files,"""
296.283	shape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views
299.727	in light of what they know will help them to raise money,
302.589	not on issues one to 10,
304.158	but on issues 11 to 1,000.
307.253	Leslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,
308.967	describes that when she went to Congress,
310.577	"she was told by a colleague, ""Always lean to the green."""
314.502	Then to clarify, she went on,
316.138	"""He was not an environmentalist."" (Laughter)"
320.832	So here too we have a democracy,
322.912	a democracy dependent upon the funders
324.927	and dependent upon the people,
326.714	competing dependencies,
328.851	possibly conflicting dependencies
330.87	depending upon who the funders are.
334.481	Okay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.
337.242	Here's point number two.
339.253	The United States is worse than Lesterland,
342.035	worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland
344.916	if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,
347.268	"""Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"""
350.532	we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.
354.683	You know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.
356.972	There are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,
359.62	not many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.
362.348	We have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,
364.476	"""What could we do to make Lesterland better?"""
367.484	It's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.
372.259	But in our land, in this land, in USA-land,
375.502	there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,
378.125	many of them in this room here today,
380.097	but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,
384.581	because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent
388.969	are not comprising it for the public interest.
391.094	It's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.
395.486	And finally, point number three:
397.907	Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland,
400.854	against the background of its history, its traditions,
403.158	in our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,
408.101	a corruption.
409.574	Now, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash
413.597	secreted among members of Congress.
415.465	I don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.
418.525	I don't mean any criminal act.
420.43	The corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.
423.821	It's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.
428.874	The framers gave us what they called a republic,
432.369	but by a republic they meant a representative democracy,
436.551	and by a representative democracy, they meant a government,
439.738	as Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch
442.717	that would be dependent upon the people alone.
447.662	So here's the model of government.
448.677	They have the people and the government
451.282	with this exclusive dependency,
453.715	but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,
457.818	no longer a dependence upon the people alone,
460.491	increasingly a dependence upon the funders.
462.92	Now this is a dependence too,
466.058	but it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone
469.922	so long as the funders are not the people.
474.228	This is a corruption.
476.491	Now, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.
478.991	One bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,
481.355	equal-opportunity corruption.
483.525	It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.
488.178	It blocks the right too, as it makes
490.65	principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.
494.57	So the right wants smaller government.
496.762	When Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea
499.458	for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.
503.37	The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,
506.05	and as he reported back to me,
508.083	"the response was, ""Hell no!"
510.282	If we deregulate these guys,
512.058	"how are we going to raise money from them?"""
515.816	This is a system that's designed to save the status quo,
519.623	including the status quo of big and invasive government.
523.256	It works against the left and the right,
525.706	and that, you might say, is good news.
527.252	But here's the bad news.
529.041	It's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,
532.944	because in any system
535.2	where the members are dependent upon
537.1	the tiniest fraction of us for their election,
540.272	that means the tiniest number of us,
543.064	the tiniest, tiniest number of us,
545.344	can block reform.
547.055	I know that should have been, like, a rock or something.
549.953	I can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.
551.99	Block reform.
554.384	Because there is an economy here, an economy of influence,
558.36	an economy with lobbyists at the center
560.914	which feeds on polarization.
563.568	It feeds on dysfunction.
565.417	The worse that it is for us,
568.056	the better that it is for this fundraising.
571.992	"Henry David Thoreau: ""There are a thousand hacking"
575.104	"at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."""
579.976	This is the root.
583.369	Okay, now, every single one of you knows this.
587.512	You couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.
591.141	You ignore it. This is an impossible problem.
594.725	You focus on the possible problems,
597.273	like eradicating polio from the world,
600.536	or taking an image of every single street across the globe,
603.67	or building the first real universal translator,
606.976	or building a fusion factory in your garage.
610.578	These are the manageable problems, so you ignore —
613.496	(Laughter) (Applause) —
619.128	so you ignore this corruption.
621.577	But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.
627.047	(Applause)
630.152	We need a government that works.
633.735	And not works for the left or the right,
636.6	but works for the left and the right,
639.064	the citizens of the left and right,
641.096	because there is no sensible reform possible
644.688	until we end this corruption.
647.217	So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
651.402	Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform
653.962	or a simpler tax system or inequality.
656.33	Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you,
658.518	look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
662.359	There will never be a Christmas.
664.185	We will never get your issue solved
666.897	until we fix this issue first.
669.863	So it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.
673.193	Yours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,
677.369	the issue we have to solve before we get to fix
680.09	the issues you care about.
682.063	No sensible reform, and we cannot afford
685.361	a world, a future, with no sensible reform.
689.282	Okay. So how do we do it?
692.153	Turns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.
695.641	If the problem is members spending an extraordinary
698.491	amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,
701.651	the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising
705.911	but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,
708.579	to spread it out,
709.752	to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea
713.033	of dependence upon the people alone.
716.225	And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,
719.655	changing the First Amendment.
720.914	To do this would require a single statute,
724.273	a statute establishing what we think of
726.465	as small dollar funded elections,
729.161	a statute of citizen-funded campaigns,
731.369	and there's any number of these proposals out there:
733.465	Fair Elections Now Act,
734.911	the American Anti-Corruption Act,
737.337	an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project
740.427	to give vouchers to people to fund elections,
742.761	an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.
745.956	Each of these would fix this corruption
750.06	by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.
754.409	The analytics are easy here.
757.067	It's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,
762.58	because this reform would shrink K Street,
768.939	and Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,
773.799	a Democrat from Tennessee, put it,
776.779	has become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.
781.599	Members and staffers and bureaucrats have
783.564	an increasingly common business model in their head,
785.775	a business model focused on their life after government,
788.843	their life as lobbyists.
791.164	Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004
794.71	left to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.
797.368	Those numbers have only gone up,
798.844	and as United Republic calculated last April,
801.19	the average increase in salary for those who they tracked
804.403	was 1,452 percent.
809.765	So it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?
816.131	Now I get this skepticism.
820.195	I get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.
825.131	But I don't buy it.
827.459	This is a solvable issue.
831.307	If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve
834.467	in the 20th century,
836.306	issues like racism, or sexism,
839.587	or the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,
842.7	those are hard issues.
845.187	You don't wake up one day no longer a racist.
848.107	It takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,
852.418	out of the soul of a people.
854.863	But this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.
858.108	Change the incentives, and the behavior changes,
860.651	and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems
863.338	have seen overnight a change in the practice.
866.468	When Connecticut adopted this system,
868.449	in the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives
872.639	gave up large contributions and took small contributions only.
876.886	It's solvable,
878.865	not by being a Democrat,
881.675	not by being a Republican.
883.47	It's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,
887.122	by being TEDizens.
890.105	Because if you want to kickstart reform,
894.442	look, I could kickstart reform
897.893	at half the price of fixing energy policy,
901.481	I could give you back a republic.
904.263	Okay. But even if you're not yet with me,
907.907	even if you believe this is impossible,
911.492	what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me
914.929	as I've spoken about this issue again and again is,
917.527	even if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.
921.353	Irrelevant.
923.341	I spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,
926.909	I write in my book, and she said to me,
928.752	"""Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless."
934.445	"There's nothing we can do."""
937.295	When she said that, I scrambled.
939.22	"I tried to think, ""How do I respond to that hopelessness?"
941.362	"What is that sense of hopelessness?"""
943.025	And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.
947.887	And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,
951.072	"""Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do."
958.381	"Nothing you can do."""
960.635	So would I do nothing?
963.73	Would I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?
966.102	I'm going off to build Google Glass.
969.925	Of course not. I would do everything I could,
973.571	and I would do everything I could because this is what love means,
977.151	that the odds are irrelevant and that you do
979.467	whatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.
983.046	And then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals
986.887	love this country.
989.146	(Laughter)
992.119	And so when the pundits and the politicians
994.379	say that change is impossible,
996.689	what this love of country says back is,
999.751	"""That's just irrelevant."""
1002.487	We lose something dear,
1004.527	something everyone in this room loves and cherishes,
1007.734	if we lose this republic, and so we act
1011.682	with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.
1016.976	So here's my question:
1019.412	Do you have that love?
1024.023	Do you have that love?
1026.848	Because if you do,
1028.531	then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
1033.92	When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention
1038.46	in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,
1042.466	"""Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"""
1045.924	"Franklin said, ""A republic, madam, if you can keep it."""
1053.685	A republic. A representative democracy.
1058.584	A government dependent upon the people alone.
1065.793	We have lost that republic.
1070.378	All of us have to act to get it back.
1074.726	Thank you very much.
1076.37	(Applause)
1082.423	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
