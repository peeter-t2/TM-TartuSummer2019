18.26	(Music)
32.26	Text: BeatJazz.
54.26	BeatJazz is:
56.26	1. Live looping,
60.26	2. Jazz improvisation
62.26	And
65.26	"3. ""Gestural"" sound design."
147.26	Accelerometers
149.26	on each hand
151.26	read hand position.
172.26	The color of the lights
176.26	indicates which sound I am playing.
182.26	Red = Drums,
186.26	Blue = Bass,
197.26	Green = Chords,
202.26	Orange = Leads,
204.26	Purple = Pads
218.26	The mouthpiece
221.26	consists of ...
223.26	a button,
225.26	two guitar picks
229.26	and lots of hot glue.
280.26	The heads-up display
283.26	is a smartphone that displays system parameters.
297.26	Why?
300.26	To atomize music culture
303.26	so that ALL past, present and future genres
305.26	can be studied and abstracted, live.
308.26	And
310.26	"""BeatJazzers"""
313.26	become as common as D.J.'s.
321.26	But mostly ...
326.26	to MAKE the future
331.26	rather than wait for it.
373.26	(Applause)
