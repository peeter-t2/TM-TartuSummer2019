17.357	The murder happened a little over 21 years ago,
21.829	January the 18th, 1991,
26.108	in a small
28.369	bedroom community
30.743	of Lynwood, California, just a few miles
33.578	southeast of Los Angeles.
36.076	A father came out of his house
38.911	to tell his teenage son and his five friends
42.318	that it was time for them to stop horsing around
45.097	on the front lawn and on the sidewalk,
48.007	to get home, finish their schoolwork,
50.915	and prepare themselves for bed.
53.661	And as the father was administering these instructions,
57.231	a car drove by, slowly,
60.569	and just after it passed the father and the teenagers,
63.471	a hand went out from the front passenger window,
67.459	"and -- ""Bam, Bam!"" -- killing the father."
72.721	And the car sped off.
75.88	The police,
77.721	investigating officers, were amazingly efficient.
81.551	They considered all the usual culprits,
83.981	and in less than 24 hours, they had selected their suspect:
88.548	Francisco Carrillo, a 17-year-old kid
92.126	who lived about two or three blocks away
94.163	from where the shooting occurred.
96.898	They found photos of him. They prepared a photo array,
101.546	and the day after the shooting,
105.13	they showed it to one of the teenagers, and he said,
108.023	"""That's the picture."
110.342	"That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."""
115.729	That was all a preliminary hearing judge had
118.306	to listen to, to bind Mr. Carrillo over to stand trial
123.415	for a first-degree murder.
126.102	In the investigation that followed before the actual trial,
129.309	each of the other five teenagers was shown
132.72	photographs, the same photo array.
136.768	The picture that we best can determine was probably
139.592	the one that they were shown in the photo array
141.864	is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots.
145.561	The reason we're not sure absolutely is because
148.997	of the nature of evidence preservation
153.43	in our judicial system,
155.714	but that's another whole TEDx talk for later. (Laughter)
160.462	So at the actual trial,
163.368	all six of the teenagers testified,
166.368	and indicated the identifications they had made
170.126	in the photo array.
173.602	He was convicted. He was sentenced to life imprisonment,
178.383	and transported to Folsom Prison.
183.842	So what's wrong?
185.931	Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.
190.697	Oh yes, no gun was ever found.
194.238	No vehicle was ever identified as being the one
198.392	in which the shooter had extended his arm,
201.616	and no person was ever charged with being the driver
204.901	of the shooter's vehicle.
208.143	And Mr. Carrillo's alibi?
212.024	Which of those parents here in the room might not lie
217.318	concerning the whereabouts of your son or daughter
220.137	in an investigation of a killing?
226.134	Sent to prison,
228.856	adamantly insisting on his innocence,
232.354	which he has consistently for 21 years.
237.091	So what's the problem?
240.562	The problems, actually, for this kind of case
243.286	come manyfold from decades of scientific research
247.195	involving human memory.
251.097	First of all, we have all the statistical analyses
253.911	from the Innocence Project work,
256.118	where we know that we have, what,
262.596	been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated,
266.668	some from death row, on the basis of later DNA analysis,
273.014	and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases
276.675	of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification
282.946	testimony during the trial that convicted them.
286.593	We know that eyewitness identifications are fallible.
291.768	The other comes from an interesting aspect
293.988	of human memory that's related to various brain functions
297.191	but I can sum up for the sake of brevity here
299.757	in a simple line:
302.141	The brain abhors a vacuum.
306.889	Under the best of observation conditions,
310.799	the absolute best,
312.671	we only detect, encode and store in our brains
316.384	bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us,
320.079	and they're stored in different parts of the brain.
322.408	So now, when it's important for us to be able to recall
326.563	what it was that we experienced,
329.584	we have an incomplete, we have a partial store,
334.862	and what happens?
337.315	Below awareness, with no requirement for any kind of
340.139	motivated processing, the brain fills in information
345.31	that was not there,
347.735	not originally stored,
350.185	from inference, from speculation,
352.729	from sources of information that came to you,
355.541	as the observer, after the observation.
358.676	But it happens without awareness such that
360.75	you don't, aren't even cognizant of it occurring.
364.384	It's called reconstructed memories.
366.651	It happens to us in all the aspects of our life, all the time.
370.95	It was those two considerations, among others --
374.214	reconstructed memory, the fact about the eyewitness fallibility --
378.719	that was part of the instigation
381.775	for a group of appeal attorneys
384.224	led by an amazing lawyer named Ellen Eggers
387.696	to pool their experience and their talents together
391.824	and petition a superior court
393.661	for a retrial for Francisco Carrillo.
398.731	They retained me, as a forensic neurophysiologist,
403.119	because I had expertise
405.261	in eyewitness memory identification,
407.381	which obviously makes sense for this case, right?
410.576	But also because I have expertise and testify about
413.92	the nature of human night vision.
418.297	Well, what's that got to do with this?
421.33	Well, when you read through the case materials
424.632	in this Carrillo case,
427.354	one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that
430.184	the investigating officers said the lighting was good
433.674	at the crime scene, at the shooting.
437.208	All the teenagers testified during the trial
440.665	that they could see very well.
444.144	But this occurred in mid-January,
446.984	in the Northern Hemisphere, at 7 p.m. at night.
452.983	So when I did the calculations
456.008	for the lunar data and the solar data
458.22	at that location on Earth at the time of the incident
461.399	of the shooting, all right,
463.447	it was well past the end of civil twilight
466.064	and there was no moon up that night.
468.32	So all the light in this area from the sun and the moon
470.599	is what you see on the screen right here.
473.183	The only lighting in that area had to come
476.097	from artificial sources,
479.367	and that's where I go out and I do the actual reconstruction
482.135	of the scene with photometers, with various measures
484.932	of illumination and various other measures of
486.906	color perception, along with special cameras
491.373	and high-speed film, right?
493.502	Take all the measurements and record them, right?
496.431	And then take photographs, and this is what the scene
498.588	looked like at the time of the shooting
500.023	from the position of the teenagers
502.489	looking at the car going by and shooting.
506.311	This is looking directly across the street
508.616	from where they were standing.
510.944	Remember, the investigating officers' report said
513.297	the lighting was good.
515.53	The teenagers said they could see very well.
517.964	This is looking down to the east,
521.215	where the shooting vehicle sped off,
524.911	and this is the lighting directly behind the father
529.803	and the teenagers.
532.144	As you can see, it is at best poor.
536.055	No one's going to call this well-lit, good lighting,
539.928	and in fact, as nice as these pictures are,
543.122	and the reason we take them is I knew I was going to have to testify in court,
546.583	and a picture is worth more than a thousand words
549.775	when you're trying to communicate numbers,
552.175	abstract concepts like lux, the international measurement
555.447	of illumination, the Ishihara color perception test values.
560.623	When you present those to people who are not well-versed
563.784	in those aspects of science and that, they become
566.9	salamanders in the noonday sun. It's like
569.279	talking about the tangent of the visual angle, all right?
572.193	Their eyes just glaze over, all right?
574.978	A good forensic expert also has to be a good educator,
579.337	a good communicator, and that's part of the reason
581.496	why we take the pictures, to show not only
583.791	where the light sources are, and what we call the spill,
586.591	the distribution, but also so that it's easier
589.22	for the trier of fact to understand the circumstances.
593.255	So these are some of the pictures that, in fact,
596.128	I used when I testified,
598.543	but more importantly were, to me as a scientist,
600.408	are those readings, the photometer readings,
602.391	which I can then convert into actual predictions
606.991	of the visual capability of the human eye
610.511	under those circumstances,
612.887	and from my readings that I recorded at the scene
616.535	under the same solar and lunar conditions
618.775	at the same time, so on and so forth, right,
621.767	I could predict
623.173	that there would be no reliable color perception,
625.365	which is crucial for face recognition,
627.679	and that there would be only scotopic vision,
629.991	which means there would be very little resolution,
631.951	what we call boundary or edge detection,
634.199	and that furthermore, because the eyes would have been
636.514	totally dilated under this light, the depth of field,
640.319	the distance at which you can focus and see details,
643.477	would have been less than 18 inches away.
648.871	I testified to that to the court,
651.375	and while the judge was very attentive,
653.808	it had been a very, very long hearing
656.415	for this petition for a retrial, and as a result,
661.159	I noticed out of the corner of my eye
662.919	that I thought that maybe the judge was going to need
667.064	a little more of a nudge
669.127	than just more numbers.
671.635	And here I became a bit audacious,
673.927	and I turned
675.447	and I asked the judge,
677.839	"I said, ""Your Honor, I think you should go out"
680.247	"and look at the scene yourself."""
682.951	Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare
686.092	than a request — (Laughter) —
688.496	but nonetheless, it's to this man's credit and his courage
692.943	"that he said, ""Yes, I will."""
696.559	A shocker in American jurisprudence.
700.551	So in fact, we found the same identical conditions,
703.023	we reconstructed the entire thing again,
705.064	he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers
709.074	to protect him in this community, all right? (Laughter)
714.231	We had him stand actually slightly in the street,
719.285	so closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle,
722.465	than the actual teenagers were,
725.207	so he stood a few feet from the curb
727.431	toward the middle of the street.
730.043	We had a car that came by,
732.96	same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?
737.911	It had a driver and a passenger,
739.848	and after the car had passed the judge by,
743.671	the passenger extended his hand,
747.185	pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on,
751.759	just as the teenagers had described it, right?
753.978	Now, he didn't use a real gun in his hand,
756.831	so he had a black object in his hand that was similar
759.249	to the gun that was described.
761.228	He pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.
764.074	This is the car 30 feet away from the judge.
771.173	There's an arm sticking out of the passenger side
774.085	and pointed back at you.
776.458	That's 30 feet away.
778.423	Some of the teenagers said that in fact the car
780.615	was 15 feet away when it shot.
783.191	Okay. There's 15 feet.
786.855	At this point, I became a little concerned.
791.025	This judge is someone you'd never want to play poker with.
795.759	He was totally stoic. I couldn't see a twitch of his eyebrow.
800.047	I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.
803.316	I had no sense of how he was reacting to this,
806.817	and after he looked at this reenactment,
809.857	he turned to me and he says,
810.937	"""Is there anything else you want me to look at?"""
814.195	"I said, ""Your honor,"" and I don't know whether I was"
818.69	emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had
821.647	in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate,
825.343	or whether it was just sheer stupidity,
827.598	which is what the defense lawyers thought — (Laughter) —
830.423	when they heard me say,
832.175	"""Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there"
834.879	and I want the car to go around the block again
839.215	and I want it to come and I want it to stop
842.569	right in front of you, three to four feet away,
846.759	and I want the passenger to extend his hand
850.215	with a black object and point it right at you,
852.231	"and you can look at it as long as you want."""
857.951	And that's what he saw. (Laughter)
862.378	You'll notice, which was also in my test report,
866.218	all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side,
868.863	which means that the shooter's face would
870.606	have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.
873.222	Furthermore, the roof of the car
875.124	is causing what we call a shadow cloud inside the car
879.398	which is making it darker.
882.728	And this is three to four feet away.
886.84	Why did I take the risk?
889.968	I knew that the depth of field was 18 inches or less.
894.197	Three to four feet, it might as well have been
895.864	a football field away.
900.336	This is what he saw.
902.544	He went back, there was a few more days of evidence
906.344	that was heard. At the end of it,
908.648	he made the judgment that he was going to grant
911.276	the petition for a retrial.
914.354	And furthermore, he released Mr. Carrillo
916.832	so that he could aid in the preparation of his own defense
919.819	if the prosecution decided to retry him.
925.838	Which they decided not to.
928.148	He is now a freed man. (Applause)
933.209	(Applause)
937.152	This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.
942.256	He -- His girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial,
946.331	right? And she had a little baby boy.
950.416	He and his son are both attending Cal State, Long Beach
953.097	right now taking classes. (Applause)
959.285	And what does this example --
963.248	what's important to keep in mind for ourselves?
967.592	First of all, there's a long history of antipathy
971.288	between science and the law
973.368	in American jurisprudence.
975.768	I could regale you with horror stories of ignorance
979.216	over decades of experience as a forensic expert
983.552	of just trying to get science into the courtroom.
988.058	The opposing council always fight it and oppose it.
992.992	One suggestion is that all of us become much more
996.379	attuned to the necessity, through policy,
999.248	through procedures,
1001.304	to get more science in the courtroom,
1004.488	and I think one large step toward that
1006.799	is more requirements,
1008.641	with all due respect to the law schools,
1011.2	of science, technology, engineering, mathematics
1016.311	for anyone going into the law,
1018.288	because they become the judges.
1021.912	Think about how we select our judges in this country.
1024.96	It's very different than most other cultures. All right?
1028.32	The other one that I want to suggest,
1030.73	the caution that all of us have to have,
1033.16	I constantly have to remind myself,
1035	about just how accurate are the memories
1038.103	that we know are true, that we believe in?
1043.472	There is decades of research,
1046.856	examples and examples of cases like this,
1051.024	where individuals
1052.992	really, really believe. None of those teenagers
1056.504	who identified him
1058.336	thought that they were picking the wrong person.
1061.612	None of them thought they couldn't see the person's face.
1064.966	We all have to be very careful.
1067.098	All our memories are reconstructed memories.
1070.738	They are the product of what we originally experienced
1073.136	and everything that's happened afterwards.
1075.869	They're dynamic.
1077.92	They're malleable. They're volatile,
1080.408	and as a result, we all need to remember to be cautious,
1084.432	that the accuracy of our memories
1087.752	is not measured in how vivid they are
1091.256	nor how certain you are that they're correct.
1096.387	Thank you. (Applause)
