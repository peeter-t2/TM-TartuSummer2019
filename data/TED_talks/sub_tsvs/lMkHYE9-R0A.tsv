25	So, where are the robots?
27	We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.
30	Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.
33	They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.
38	Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,
42	but we don't have any robots.
44	So what can we do about that? What can we say?
48	So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective
52	of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
58	And this is an x-ray picture
60	of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that --
65	what was true then is certainly true today.
67	We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.
70	We can make the circuitry of the right computational power,
73	but we can't actually put them together to make something
76	that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.
81	So let's try to look at it from a different perspective.
83	Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.
87	Let's see what evolution can do for us.
90	So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup
94	with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.
98	Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,
102	under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
106	A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.
112	So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines
115	come out of this. They all move around.
117	They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,
121	that we actually made a couple of these things,
123	and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,
126	but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:
130	for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,
133	but we can also do that on a real machine.
135	Here's a physical robot that we actually
140	have a population of brains,
143	competing, or evolving on the machine.
145	It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,
148	and they get rewarded for how fast or how far
151	they can make the machine move forward.
153	And you can see these robots are not ready
155	to take over the world yet, but
158	they gradually learn how to move forward,
160	and they do this autonomously.
163	So in these two examples, we had basically
167	machines that learned how to walk in simulation,
170	and also machines that learned how to walk in reality.
172	But I want to show you a different approach,
174	and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.
180	It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
182	It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine
185	which way it's tilting.
188	But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
190	You look at it and you see it has four legs,
192	the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,
194	it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,
197	but it's going to try to find that out.
199	Initially, it does some random motion,
201	and then it tries to figure out what it might look like.
204	And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,
206	a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship
210	between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do
213	a second action that creates the most disagreement
217	among predictions of these alternative models,
219	like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that
221	and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.
225	This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much
228	figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,
232	it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.
236	So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines --
238	a pattern of locomotion.
240	We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,
244	but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
248	But when you look at that, you have to remember
251	that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,
257	nor did it have a model of itself.
259	It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,
262	and then actually tried that out.
266	(Applause)
271	So, we'll move forward to a different idea.
275	So that was what happened when we had a couple of --
280	that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --
284	(Laughter)
286	-- they don't like each other. So
288	there's a different robot.
291	That's what happened when the robots actually
293	are rewarded for doing something.
295	What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?
298	So we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.
301	The cube can swivel, or flip on its side,
304	and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup --
308	this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything,
310	we just let them flip. We pump energy into this
313	and see what happens in a couple of mutations.
316	So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.
319	But after a very short while, you can see these blue things
323	on the right there begin to take over.
325	They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,
329	the intrinsic reward is self-replication.
332	And we've actually built a couple of these,
333	and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.
337	It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually
340	carrying out some of its replication process.
342	So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case --
346	and more energy, and it can make another robot.
349	So of course, this is a very crude machine,
352	but we're working on a micro-scale version of these,
354	and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.
357	OK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course
362	not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something
365	about how we can build better robots,
368	and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.
373	And one of the things that I think is important
375	is that we have to get away from this idea
377	of designing the machines manually,
379	but actually let them evolve and learn, like children,
382	and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.
384	(Applause)
