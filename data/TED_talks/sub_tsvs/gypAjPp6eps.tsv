12.76	Extraordinary claims
12.76	require extraordinary evidence,
17.28	and it is my job,
17.28	my responsibility, as an astronomer
22	to remind people that alien hypotheses
22	should always be a last resort.
29.44	Now, I want to tell you
29.44	a story about that.
31.6	It involves data from a NASA mission,
35.2	ordinary people and one of the most
35.2	extraordinary stars in our galaxy.
41.8	It began in 2009 with the launch
41.8	of NASA's Kepler mission.
46	Kepler's main scientific objective
48.08	was to find planets
48.08	outside of our solar system.
51.08	It did this by staring
51.08	at a single field in the sky,
54.68	this one, with all the tiny boxes.
57.48	And in this one field,
58.92	it monitored the brightness
58.92	of over 150,000 stars
63.36	continuously for four years,
65.8	taking a data point every 30 minutes.
70.48	It was looking for what
70.48	astronomers call a transit.
73.52	This is when the planet's orbit
73.52	is aligned in our line of sight,
78.56	just so that the planet
78.56	crosses in front of a star.
82.72	And when this happens,
82.72	it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,
87.12	which you can see as a dip in this curve.
91.6	And so the team at NASA
91.6	had developed very sophisticated computers
96.04	to search for transits
96.04	in all the Kepler data.
100.16	At the same time
100.16	of the first data release,
104.08	astronomers at Yale
104.08	were wondering an interesting thing:
108.24	What if computers missed something?
113.04	And so we launched the citizen
113.04	science project called Planet Hunters
117.76	to have people look at the same data.
121.6	The human brain has an amazing ability
121.6	for pattern recognition,
125.4	sometimes even better than a computer.
127.64	However, there was a lot
127.64	of skepticism around this.
130.2	My colleague, Debra Fischer,
130.2	founder of the Planet Hunters project,
133.76	said that people at the time were saying,
135.76	"""You're crazy. There's no way"
135.76	"that a computer will miss a signal."""
139.56	And so it was on, the classic
139.56	human versus machine gamble.
143.8	And if we found one planet,
143.8	we would be thrilled.
147	When I joined the team four years ago,
149.48	we had already found a couple.
152.36	And today, with the help
152.36	of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,
157.04	we have found dozens,
158.84	and we've also found
158.84	one of the most mysterious stars
162.12	in our galaxy.
165.04	So to understand this,
166.52	let me show you what a normal transit
166.52	in Kepler data looks like.
170.68	On this graph on the left-hand side
170.68	you have the amount of light,
174.08	and on the bottom is time.
175.96	The white line
175.96	is light just from the star,
179.04	what astronomers call a light curve.
181.44	Now, when a planet transits a star,
181.44	it blocks out a little bit of this light,
185.32	and the depth of this transit
185.32	reflects the size of the object itself.
190.8	And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.
193.44	Planets don't get
193.44	much bigger than Jupiter.
195.6	Jupiter will make a one percent drop
195.6	in a star's brightness.
199.4	Earth, on the other hand,
199.4	is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,
203.6	and the signal
203.6	is barely visible in the data.
206.44	So back to our mystery.
208.52	A few years ago, Planet Hunters were
208.52	sifting through data looking for transits,
213.2	and they spotted a mysterious signal
213.2	coming from the star KIC 8462852.
219.92	The observations in May of 2009
219.92	were the first they spotted,
223.96	and they started talking about this
223.96	in the discussion forums.
227.32	They said and object like Jupiter
229.44	would make a drop like this
229.44	in the star's light,
232.36	but they were also saying it was giant.
235.72	You see, transits normally
235.72	only last for a few hours,
238.96	and this one lasted for almost a week.
241.88	They were also saying
241.88	that it looks asymmetric,
245.44	meaning that instead of the clean,
245.44	U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,
249.72	it had this strange slope
249.72	that you can see on the left side.
253.24	This seemed to indicate
254.6	that whatever was getting in the way
254.6	and blocking the starlight
258	was not circular like a planet.
261.24	There are few more dips that happened,
263.16	but for a couple of years,
263.16	it was pretty quiet.
266.4	And then in March of 2011, we see this.
271.12	The star's light drops
271.12	by a whole 15 percent,
275.24	and this is huge compared to a planet,
277.44	which would only make a one percent drop.
280.48	We described this feature
280.48	as both smooth and clean.
284.04	It also is asymmetric,
286.08	having a gradual dimming
286.08	that lasts almost a week,
288.76	and then it snaps right back up to normal
288.76	in just a matter of days.
292.92	And again, after this, not much happens
297.2	until February of 2013.
300.92	Things start to get really crazy.
303.56	There is a huge complex of dips
303.56	in the light curve that appear,
308.08	and they last for like a hundred days,
310.24	all the way up
310.24	into the Kepler mission's end.
313.28	These dips have variable shapes.
315.28	Some are very sharp, and some are broad,
317.52	and they also have variable durations.
319.8	Some last just for a day or two,
319.8	and some for more than a week.
324.12	And there's also up and down trends
324.12	within some of these dips,
327.48	almost like several independent events
327.48	were superimposed on top of each other.
332.92	And at this time, this star drops
332.92	in its brightness over 20 percent.
339.16	This means that whatever
339.16	is blocking its light
341.327	has an area of over 1,000 times
341.327	the area of our planet Earth.
346.2	This is truly remarkable.
349.36	And so the citizen scientists,
349.36	when they saw this,
351.76	they notified the science team
351.76	that they found something weird enough
355.48	that it might be worth following up.
358.68	And so when the science team looked at it,
360.76	"we're like, ""Yeah, there's probably"
360.76	"just something wrong with the data."""
364.165	But we looked really, really, really hard,
366.72	and the data were good.
370.68	And so what was happening
370.68	had to be astrophysical,
373.8	meaning that something in space
373.8	was getting in the way
377.48	and blocking starlight.
380.24	And so at this point,
381.48	we set out to learn
381.48	everything we could about the star
384.08	to see if we could find any clues
384.08	to what was going on.
387.72	And the citizen scientists
387.72	who helped us in this discovery,
390.92	they joined along for the ride
392.48	watching science in action firsthand.
397	First, somebody said, you know,
397	what if this star was very young
402.48	and it still had the cloud of material
402.48	it was born from surrounding it.
407.04	And then somebody else said,
408.48	well, what if the star
408.48	had already formed planets,
411.28	and two of these planets had collided,
413.52	similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.
416.44	Well, both of these theories
416.44	could explain part of the data,
420	but the difficulties were that the star
420	showed no signs of being young,
423.44	and there was no glow
423.44	from any of the material
426.4	that was heated up by the star's light,
428.52	and you would expect this
428.52	if the star was young
431.4	or if there was a collision
431.4	and a lot of dust was produced.
435.8	And so somebody else said,
437.44	well, how about a huge swarm of comets
442.44	that are passing by this star
442.44	in a very elliptical orbit?
446.12	Well, it ends up that this is actually
446.12	consistent with our observations.
452	But I agree, it does feel
452	a little contrived.
455.28	You see, it would take hundreds of comets
458.6	to reproduce what we're observing.
461.2	And these are only the comets
462.8	that happen to pass
462.8	between us and the star.
465.44	And so in reality, we're talking
465.44	thousands to tens of thousands of comets.
471.92	But of all the bad ideas we had,
475.4	this one was the best.
477.56	And so we went ahead
477.56	and published our findings.
480.52	Now, let me tell you, this was one
480.52	of the hardest papers I ever wrote.
484.76	Scientists are meant to publish results,
487.12	and this situation was far from that.
489.96	And so we decided
489.96	to give it a catchy title,
493.12	"and we called it: ""Where's The Flux?"""
495.32	I will let you work out the acronym.
498.16	(Laughter)
502.84	So this isn't the end of the story.
504.56	Around the same time
504.56	I was writing this paper,
506.76	I met with a colleague
506.76	of mine, Jason Wright,
508.92	and he was also writing a paper
508.92	on Kepler data.
511.16	And he was saying that with Kepler's
511.16	extreme precision,
515.36	it could actually detect
515.36	alien megastructures around stars,
520.24	but it didn't.
522.52	And then I showed him this weird data
522.52	that our citizen scientists had found,
527.559	and he said to me,
528.799	"""Aw crap, Tabby."
530.6	"Now I have to rewrite my paper."""
534.44	So yes, the natural
534.44	explanations were weak,
538.48	and we were curious now.
540.08	So we had to find a way
540.08	to rule out aliens.
543.28	So together, we convinced
543.28	a colleague of ours
546.16	who works on SETI, the Search
546.16	for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,
549.44	that this would be
549.44	an extraordinary target to pursue.
554.48	We wrote a proposal to observe the star
556.88	with the world's largest radio telescope
556.88	at the Green Bank Observatory.
561.08	A couple months later,
562.48	news of this proposal
562.48	got leaked to the press
567.76	and now there are thousands of articles,
571.24	over 10,000 articles, on this star alone.
574.4	And if you search Google Images,
576.92	this is what you'll find.
579.6	Now, you may be wondering,
579.6	OK, Tabby, well,
582.12	how do aliens actually explain
582.12	this light curve?
586	OK, well, imagine a civilization
586	that's much more advanced than our own.
591.32	In this hypothetical circumstance,
594.68	this civilization would have exhausted
594.68	the energy supply of their home planet,
599.36	so where could they get more energy?
601.56	Well, they have a host star
601.56	just like we have a sun,
605.24	and so if they were able
605.24	to capture more energy from this star,
609.32	then that would solve their energy needs.
611.8	So they would go
611.8	and build huge structures.
615.24	These giant megastructures,
618.04	like ginormous solar panels,
618.04	are called Dyson spheres.
622.44	This image above
623.76	are lots of artists' impressions
623.76	of Dyson spheres.
626.96	It's really hard to provide perspective
626.96	on the vastness of these things,
632	but you can think of it this way.
633.84	The Earth-Moon distance
633.84	is a quarter of a million miles.
638.04	The simplest element
638.04	on one of these structures
641.96	is 100 times that size.
645.4	They're enormous.
648.08	And now imagine one of these structures
648.08	in motion around a star.
652.52	You can see how it would produce
652.52	anomalies in the data
655.64	such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.
658.88	But it remains that even
658.88	alien megastructures
662.88	cannot defy the laws of physics.
665.32	You see, anything that uses
665.32	a lot of energy
669.8	is going to produce heat,
672.84	and we don't observe this.
674.84	But it could be something as simple
676.56	as they're just reradiating it away
676.56	in another direction,
680.04	just not at Earth.
683	Another idea that's one
683	of my personal favorites
686.32	is that we had just witnessed
686.32	an interplanetary space battle
690.12	and the catastrophic
690.12	destruction of a planet.
694.52	Now, I admit that this
694.52	would produce a lot of dust
697.8	that we don't observe.
699.72	But if we're already invoking aliens
699.72	in this explanation,
704.08	then who is to say they didn't
704.08	efficiently clean up all this mess
707.8	for recycling purposes?
709.36	(Laughter)
710.4	You can see how this quickly
710.4	captures your imagination.
715.76	Well, there you have it.
717.04	We're in a situation that could unfold
720.28	to be a natural phenomenon
720.28	we don't understand
723.72	or an alien technology
723.72	we don't understand.
727.6	Personally, as a scientist,
727.6	my money is on the natural explanation.
734.04	But don't get me wrong, I do think
734.04	it would be awesome to find aliens.
738.8	Either way, there is something new
738.8	and really interesting to discover.
744.04	So what happens next?
745.92	We need to continue to observe this star
748.6	to learn more about what's happening.
751.04	But professional astronomers, like me,
753.64	we have limited resources
753.64	for this kind of thing,
756.48	and Kepler is on to a different mission.
759.4	And I'm happy to say that once again,
763.64	citizen scientists have come in
763.64	and saved the day.
767.88	You see, this time,
770.36	amateur astronomers
770.36	with their backyard telescopes
774.12	stepped up immediately
774.12	and started observing this star nightly
778.12	at their own facilities,
779.64	and I am so excited to see what they find.
783.52	What's amazing to me is that this star
783.52	would have never been found by computers
787.72	because we just weren't looking
787.72	for something like this.
791.4	And what's more exciting
795.68	is that there's more data to come.
798.2	There are new missions that are coming up
800.2	that are observing millions more stars
803.84	all over the sky.
806.28	And just think: What will it mean
806.28	when we find another star like this?
812.52	And what will it mean
812.52	if we don't find another star like this?
817.28	Thank you.
818.52	(Applause)
