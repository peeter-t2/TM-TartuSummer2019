15.317	"Interpreter: Piano, ""p,"""
15.317	is my favorite musical symbol.
19.504	It means to play softly.
22.007	If you're playing a musical instrument
22.007	"and you notice a ""p"" in the score,"
26.194	you need to play softer.
28.12	Two p's -- even softer.
30.804	Four p's -- extremely soft.
38.353	This is my drawing of a p-tree,
41.78	which demonstrates
43.114	no matter how many thousands
43.114	upon thousands of p's there may be,
47.627	you'll never reach complete silence.
50.477	That's my current definition of silence:
53.279	a very obscure sound.
56.976	I'd like to share a little bit
58.483	about the history
58.483	of American Sign Language, ASL,
61.673	plus a bit of my own background.
65.851	French sign language was brought
65.851	to America during the early 1800s,
71.091	and as time went by,
71.091	mixed with local signs,
75.19	it evolved into the language
75.19	we know today as ASL.
79.168	So it has a history of about 200 years.
83.8	I was born deaf,
87.244	and I was taught to believe
87.244	that sound wasn't a part of my life.
92.662	And I believed it to be true.
97.318	Yet, I realize now
97.318	that that wasn't the case at all.
101.272	Sound was very much a part of my life,
104.081	really, on my mind every day.
110.483	As a Deaf person living
110.483	in a world of sound,
114.494	it's as if I was living
114.494	in a foreign country,
117.438	blindly following its rules,
117.438	customs, behaviors and norms
121.704	without ever questioning them.
133.46	So how is it that I understand sound?
138.282	Well, I watch how people
138.282	behave and respond to sound.
142.654	You people are like my loudspeakers,
142.654	and amplify sound.
146.3	I learn and mirror that behavior.
148.782	At the same time,
148.782	I've learned that I create sound,
151.757	and I've seen how people respond to me.
154.6	Thus I've learned, for example ...
156.48	"""Don't slam the door!"""
160.35	"""Don't make too much noise when"
160.35	"you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"""
163.771	(Laughter)
164.795	"""Don't burp,"
166.087	and when you're eating,
167.292	make sure you don't scrape
167.292	"your utensils on the plate."""
170.158	All of these things
170.158	"I term ""sound etiquette."""
175.927	Maybe I think about sound etiquette
178.382	more than the average hearing person does.
181.963	I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.
187.463	And I'm always waiting
187.463	in eager nervous anticipation
191.353	around sound, about what's to come next.
193.459	Hence, this drawing.
196.28	TBD, to be decided.
199.724	TBC, to be continued.
202.819	TBA, to be announced.
208.793	And you notice the staff --
210.683	there are no notes contained in the lines.
212.898	That's because the lines
212.898	already contain sound
216.57	through the subtle smudges and smears.
220.863	In Deaf culture,
220.863	movement is equivalent to sound.
229.617	"This is a sign for ""staff"" in ASL."
232.325	A typical staff contains five lines.
235.904	Yet for me, signing it
235.904	with my thumb sticking up like that
238.702	doesn't feel natural.
240.053	That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
240.053	I stick to four lines on paper.
245.199	In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
245.199	to travel to Berlin, Germany,
249.212	for an artist residency there.
252.041	Prior to this time,
252.041	I had been working as a painter.
257.02	During this summer, I visited
257.02	different museums and gallery spaces,
261.099	and as I went from one place to the next,
263.105	I noticed there was no visual art there.
266.618	At that time, sound was trending,
266.618	and this struck me ...
271.909	there was no visual art,
273.911	everything was auditory.
277.482	Now sound has come into my art territory.
281.168	Is it going to further
281.168	distance me from art?
285.8	I realized that doesn't
285.8	have to be the case at all.
288.52	I actually know sound.
289.695	I know it so well
292.361	that it doesn't have to be something
292.361	just experienced through the ears.
295.723	It could be felt tactually,
298.732	or experienced as a visual,
300.639	or even as an idea.
305.048	So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound
308.333	and to put it into my art practice.
313.016	And everything that I had been
313.016	taught regarding sound,
316.619	I decided to do away with and unlearn.
321.099	I started creating a new body of work.
324.961	And when I presented this
324.961	to the art community,
327.539	I was blown away with the amount
327.539	of support and attention I received.
332.676	I realized:
335.669	sound is like money,
339.179	power, control --
342.375	social currency.
347.782	In the back of my mind, I've always felt
347.782	that sound was your thing,
351.67	a hearing person's thing.
356.014	And sound is so powerful
358.513	that it could either
358.513	disempower me and my artwork,
362.293	or it could empower me.
365.138	I chose to be empowered.
368.969	There's a massive culture
368.969	around spoken language.
373.233	And just because I don't use
373.233	my literal voice to communicate,
378.524	in society's eyes
378.524	it's as if I don't have a voice at all.
384.945	So I need to work with individuals
384.945	who can support me as an equal
388.887	and become my voice.
392.523	And that way, I'm able to maintain
392.523	relevancy in society today.
396.789	So at school, at work and institutions,
399.235	I work with many
399.235	different ASL interpreters.
403.254	And their voice becomes
403.254	my voice and identity.
408.365	They help me to be heard.
414.38	And their voices hold value and currency.
424.178	Ironically, by borrowing out their voices,
426.54	I'm able to maintain
426.54	a temporary form of currency,
430.385	kind of like taking out a loan
430.385	with a very high interest rate.
438.052	If I didn't continue this practice,
440.173	I feel that I could just
440.173	fade off into oblivion
443.03	and not maintain
443.03	any form of social currency.
449.488	So with sound as my new art medium,
452.167	I delved into the world of music.
455.089	And I was surprised to see
455.089	the similarities between music and ASL.
461.186	For example,
462.727	a musical note
465.103	cannot be fully captured
465.103	and expressed on paper.
468.783	And the same holds true
468.783	for a concept in ASL.
473.61	They're both highly spatial
473.61	and highly inflected --
482.213	meaning that subtle changes
484.394	can affect the entire meaning
486.927	of both signs and sounds.
491.898	I'd like to share with you
491.898	a piano metaphor,
494.144	to have you have a better
494.144	understanding of how ASL works.
497.153	So, envision a piano.
500.299	ASL is broken down into
500.299	many different grammatical parameters.
504.771	If you assign a different parameter
504.771	to each finger as you play the piano --
508.855	such as facial expression, body movement,
513.884	speed, hand shape and so on,
517.68	as you play the piano --
519.912	English is a linear language,
521.773	as if one key is being pressed at a time.
524.602	However, ASL is more like a chord --
528.274	all 10 fingers need
528.274	to come down simultaneously
531.682	to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.
537.548	If just one of those keys
537.548	were to change the chord,
541.598	it would create a completely
541.598	different meaning.
544.152	The same applies to music
544.152	in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
552.518	In ASL, by playing around with these
552.518	different grammatical parameters,
556.12	you can express different ideas.
557.837	For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
560.24	This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT.
564.699	I'm looking at you.
568.056	Staring at you.
569.38	(Laughter)
573.103	(Laughter)
575.733	Oh -- busted.
578.423	(Laughter)
581.608	Uh-oh.
585.521	What are you looking at?
589.41	Aw, stop.
590.762	(Laughter)
592.455	I then started thinking,
593.663	"""What if I was to look at ASL"
593.663	"through a musical lens?"""
597.011	If I was to create a sign
597.011	and repeat it over and over,
600.242	it could become
600.242	like a piece of visual music.
604.016	"For example, this is the sign for ""day,"""
607.676	as the sun rises and sets.
611.789	"This is ""all day."""
616.416	If I was to repeat it and slow it down,
619.641	visually it looks like a piece of music.
624.023	All ... day.
627.186	I feel the same holds true
627.186	"for ""all night."""
633.776	"""All night."""
635.89	This is ALL-NIGHT,
635.89	represented in this drawing.
642.501	And this led me to thinking
642.501	about three different kinds of nights:
649.827	"""last night,"""
652.747	"""overnight,"""
657.549	"(Sings) ""all night long."""
660.327	(Laughter)
667.861	I feel like the third one has
667.861	a lot more musicality than the other two.
671.23	(Laughter)
673.413	This represents how time
673.413	is expressed in ASL
676.472	and how the distance from your body
676.472	can express the changes in time.
680.955	For example,
682.618	1H is one hand, 2H is two hand,
685.781	present tense happens closest
685.781	and in front of the body,
689.035	future is in front of the body
689.035	and the past is to your back.
696.209	So, the first example
696.209	"is ""a long time ago."""
700.209	"Then ""past,"""
704.538	"""used to"""
706.255	and the last one, which is my favorite,
708.314	with the very romantic
708.314	and dramatic notion to it,
710.964	"""once upon a time."""
712.577	(Laughter)
717.962	"""Common time"""
720.703	is a musical term
722.495	with a specific time signature
722.495	of four beats per measure.
727.614	"Yet when I see the word ""common time,"""
729.45	what automatically comes to mind for me
729.45	"is ""at the same time."""
733.645	So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.
737.578	We have the staff
737.578	across the head and the chest.
740.221	[Head: RH, Flash claw]
741.427	[Common time]
742.701	[Chest: LH, Flash claw]
745.712	I'm now going to demonstrate
745.712	"a hand shape called the ""flash claw."""
750.722	Can you please follow along with me?
753.723	Everybody, hands up.
758.776	Now we're going to do it
758.776	in both the head and the chest,
761.498	"kind of like ""common time"""
761.498	or at the same time.
767.595	Yes, got it.
769.329	"That means ""to fall in love"""
769.329	in International [Sign].
772.168	(Laughter)
774.069	International [Sign], as a note,
775.996	is a visual tool to help communicate
778.765	across cultures and sign languages
778.765	around the world.
781.997	The second one I'd like
781.997	to demonstrate is this --
784.307	please follow along with me again.
790.891	And now this.
797.358	"This is ""colonization"" in ASL."
800.082	(Laughter)
803.407	Now the third --
804.702	please follow along again.
811.072	And again.
816.97	"This is ""enlightenment"" in ASL."
819.502	So let's do all three together.
823.732	"""Fall in love,"""
825.897	"""colonization"""
827.845	"and ""enlightenment."""
830.767	Good job, everyone.
831.941	(Laughter)
833.183	Notice how all three signs
833.183	are very similar,
835.445	they all happen at the head and the chest,
837.566	but they convey quite different meanings.
839.812	So it's amazing to see
839.812	how ASL is alive and thriving,
843.16	just like music is.
846.152	However, in this day and age,
849.002	we live in a very audio-centric world.
851.628	And just because ASL has no sound to it,
855.033	it automatically holds no social currency.
859.271	We need to start thinking harder
859.271	about what defines social currency
864.033	and allow ASL to develop
864.033	its own form of currency --
867.899	without sound.
870.262	And this could possibly be a step
870.262	to lead to a more inclusive society.
878.291	And maybe people will understand
880.447	that you don't need
880.447	to be deaf to learn ASL,
884.007	nor do you have to be hearing
884.007	to learn music.
888.891	ASL is such a rich treasure
891.61	that I'd like you
891.61	to have the same experience.
894.419	And I'd like to invite you
894.419	to open your ears,
897.219	to open your eyes,
899.134	take part in our culture
900.869	and experience our visual language.
903.412	And you never know,
904.871	you might just fall in love with us.
906.635	(Applause)
908.717	Thank you.
910.508	Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me.
912.433	(Applause)
