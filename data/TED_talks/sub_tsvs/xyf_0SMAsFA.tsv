16.26	I want to talk about
18.26	what we learn from conservatives.
21.26	And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,
24.26	so I want to confess to you
26.26	that when I was a kid,
30.26	indeed, I was a conservative.
33.26	I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,
35.26	a leader in the Teenage Republicans.
37.26	Indeed, I was the youngest member
39.26	of any delegation
41.26	in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan
43.26	to be the Republican nominee for president.
47.26	Now, I know what you're thinking.
49.26	(Laughter)
51.26	"You're thinking, ""That's not what the Internets say."""
55.26	"You're thinking, ""Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."""
58.26	And indeed, this is just one of the examples
61.26	of the junk that flows across the tubes
63.26	in these Internets here.
66.26	Wikipedia reports that this guy,
68.26	this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania
71.26	was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people
73.26	at the Republican National Convention,
75.26	but it's just not true.
78.26	(Laughter)
80.26	Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
83.26	(Laughter)
86.26	(Applause)
90.26	All right. Okay, so ... perfect.
93.26	Perfect.
95.26	(Laughter)
99.26	Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
102.26	Okay.
104.26	Finally, truth will be brought here.
106.26	Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.
109.26	"""... Youngest Republican,"" okay, we're finished."
113.26	That's it. Please save this.
116.26	Great, here we go.
119.26	And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
122.26	Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.
125.26	(Applause)
129.26	But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives --
132.26	not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --
134.26	the thing to think about is this:
136.26	They go to church.
138.26	Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
140.26	I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
143.26	And I'm not talking about the God thing.
145.26	I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.
147.26	They go to church, by which I mean,
149.26	they do lots of things for free for each other.
153.26	They hold potluck dinners.
155.26	Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
158.26	They serve food to poor people.
161.26	They share, they give,
163.26	they give away for free.
165.26	And it's the very same people
169.26	leading Wall Street firms
172.26	who, on Sundays, show up
175.26	and share.
177.26	And not only food, right.
179.26	These very same people
181.26	are strong believers, in lots of contexts,
184.26	in the limits on the markets.
187.26	They are in many important places
190.26	against markets.
192.26	Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
195.26	But they're very keen that we don't
197.26	let money drop into that relationship,
199.26	else it turns into something like this.
202.26	They want to regulate us, those conservatives,
205.26	to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
208.26	Because they understand:
211.26	There are places for the market
213.26	and places where the market should not exist,
216.26	where we should be free
219.26	to enjoy the fellowship of others.
222.26	They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.
226.26	And the second great thing about conservatives:
229.26	they get ecology.
231.26	Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century
234.26	who taught us about
236.26	environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.
238.26	They first taught us about ecology
240.26	in the context of natural resources.
243.26	And then they began to teach us in the context of
245.26	innovation, economics.
247.26	They understand, in that context,
249.26	"""free."" They understand ""free"" is an important"
252.26	essential part of the
254.26	cultural ecology as well.
256.26	That's the thing I want you to think about them.
261.26	Now, I know
263.26	you don't believe me, really, here.
268.26	So here's exhibit number one.
270.26	I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,
273.26	a libertarian who works at the, for many people,
276.26	"""evil"" Cato Institute."
279.26	Okay, so Julian made this video.
281.26	He's a terrible producer of videos,
283.26	but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
285.26	So here he is beginning.
287.26	Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way
289.26	remix culture seems to be evolving ...
291.26	Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us
293.26	about these three videos.
296.26	This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix
299.26	set to Lisztomania.
303.26	Which, of course, spread virally.
305.26	Hugely successful.
307.26	(Music)
311.26	And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
313.26	They decided they wanted to do the same.
320.26	(Music)
337.26	And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
339.26	And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.
342.26	(Music)
363.26	And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian
366.26	has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.
368.26	Here's lesson number one.
371.26	JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.
375.26	They are acting in the sense that they're
378.26	emulating the original mashup.
380.26	And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye
383.26	and some experience with video editing.
385.26	But this is also basically just a group of friends
388.26	having an authentic social moment
390.26	and screwing around together.
392.26	It should feel familiar and kind of resonate
394.26	for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party
396.26	with a group of good friends.
398.26	LL: Or ...
400.26	JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at
403.26	because here, remix isn't just about
405.26	an individual doing something alone in his basement;
408.26	it becomes an act of social creativity.
411.26	And it's not just that it yields
413.26	a different kind of product at the end,
416.26	it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.
420.26	All of our normal social interactions
423.26	become a kind of invitation
425.26	to this sort of collective expression.
427.26	It's our real social lives themselves
429.26	that are transmuted into art.
432.26	LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
435.26	JS: One remix is about
437.26	individuals using our shared culture
439.26	as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
442.26	Stage two, social remix,
444.26	is really about using it to mediate
446.26	people's relationships to each other.
449.26	First, within each video,
451.26	the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template
454.26	for performing the social reality of each group.
457.26	But there's also a dialogue between the videos,
460.26	where, once the basic structure is established,
463.26	it becomes a kind of platform
465.26	for articulating the similarities and differences
468.26	between the groups' social and physical worlds.
471.26	LL: And then, here's for me,
473.26	the critical key to what
475.26	Julian has to say ...
477.26	JS: Copyright policy isn't just about
479.26	how to incentivize the production
481.26	of a certain kind of artistic commodity;
483.26	it's about what level of control
485.26	we're going to permit to be exercised
487.26	over our social realities --
489.26	social realities that are now inevitably
492.26	permeated by pop culture.
494.26	I think it's important that we
496.26	keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.
499.26	If we're only focused on how to maximize
502.26	the supply of one,
504.26	I think we risk suppressing
506.26	this different and richer
508.26	and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.
511.26	LL: Right. Bingo. Point.
514.26	Freedom needs this opportunity
517.26	to both have the commercial success
520.26	of the great commercial works
522.26	and the opportunity
524.26	to build this different kind of culture.
526.26	And for that to happen, you need
528.26	ideas like fair use to be central and protected,
531.26	to enable this kind of innovation,
534.26	as this libertarian tells us,
536.26	between these two creative cultures,
539.26	a commercial and a sharing culture.
542.26	The point is they, he, here,
544.26	gets that culture.
546.26	Now, my concern is, we Dems,
549.26	too often, not so much.
552.26	All right, take for example this great company.
556.26	In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,
559.26	their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.
562.26	All of the great Disney works
565.26	were works that took works that
567.26	were in the public domain and remixed them,
569.26	or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,
572.26	to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
575.26	Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,
578.26	"as ""Steamboat Willie,"""
580.26	is a remix of the then, very dominant,
583.26	"very popular ""Steamboat Bill"""
585.26	by Buster Keaton.
587.26	This man was a remixer extraordinaire.
590.26	He is the celebration and ideal
592.26	of exactly this kind of creativity.
595.26	But then the company passes
597.26	through this dark stage
600.26	to this Democrat.
602.26	Wildly different.
604.26	This is the mastermind behind
606.26	the eventual passage of what we call
608.26	the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
611.26	extending the term of existing copyrights
613.26	by 20 years,
615.26	so that no one could do to Disney
617.26	what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
620.26	Now, when we tried to challenge this,
622.26	going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --
625.26	if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,
628.26	we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners
631.26	including this right-wing
634.26	Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,
636.26	who said he would join our brief
638.26	"only if the word ""no brainer"""
640.26	was in the brief somewhere.
642.26	(Laughter)
644.26	But apparently, no brains
646.26	existed in this place
648.26	when Democrats passed and signed
650.26	this bill into law.
652.26	Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:
654.26	Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,
657.26	but I don't buy it.
659.26	This guy is no Republican.
662.26	Okay, for a second example,
664.26	think about this cultural hero,
666.26	icon on the Left,
669.26	creator of this character.
671.26	"Look at the site that he built: ""Star Wars"" MashUps,"
673.26	inviting people to come and use their creative energy
676.26	to produce a new generation of attention
678.26	towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.
681.26	Read the license.
683.26	The license for these remixers
685.26	assigns all of the rights
687.26	to the remix back to Lucas.
689.26	The mashup is owned by Lucas.
692.26	Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,
694.26	music you might add,
696.26	Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right
698.26	to exploit that for free.
700.26	There is no creator here to be recognized.
703.26	The creator doesn't have any rights.
705.26	The creator is a sharecropper in this story.
708.26	And we should remember
710.26	who employed the sharecroppers:
712.26	the Democrats, right?
714.26	So the point is the Republicans here
717.26	recognize that there's a certain need
719.26	of ownership,
721.26	a respect for ownership,
723.26	the respect we should give the creator,
725.26	the remixer, the owner, the property owner,
728.26	the copyright owner
730.26	of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,
733.26	and not a generation of sharecroppers.
739.26	Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,
742.26	lessons about openness.
744.26	Our lives are sharing activities,
747.26	at least in part.
749.26	Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,
751.26	at least in part.
754.26	And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have
756.26	well-protected spaces of fair use.
759.26	That's number one. Number two:
761.26	This ecology of sharing
763.26	needs freedom
765.26	within which to create.
768.26	Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,
771.26	the ability to create.
773.26	And number three: We need to
775.26	respect the creator,
777.26	the creator of these remixes
779.26	through rights that are
781.26	directly tied to them.
785.26	Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit
788.26	Creative Commons.
790.26	Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,
792.26	but of course -- let me just tie it here --
794.26	the Creative Commons, which is
796.26	offering authors this simple way to mark their content
799.26	with the freedoms
801.26	they intended to carry.
803.26	"So that we go from a ""all rights reserved"" world"
805.26	"to a ""some rights reserved"" world"
808.26	so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,
811.26	building and creating
813.26	on the basis of this
815.26	creative copyrighted work.
817.26	These tools that we built
819.26	enable this sharing in parts
822.26	through licenses that make it clear
824.26	and a freedom to create
826.26	without requiring permission first
828.26	because the permission has already been granted
830.26	and a respect for the creator because it builds upon
833.26	a copyright the creator
835.26	has licensed freely.
837.26	And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
840.26	that's obviously developed around these licenses,
843.26	as now more than 350 million digital objects
846.26	are out there, licensed freely
848.26	in this way.
850.26	Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,
853.26	the picture of an ecology
855.26	of balanced creativity,
857.26	is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
860.26	Well, as you all know,
863.26	not many of us believe we do.
865.26	I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity
868.26	just last week.
870.26	I created a video which was based
872.26	on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,
874.26	and I uploaded it to YouTube.
877.26	I then got this email from YouTube
879.26	weirdly notifying me
881.26	that there was content in that
883.26	owned by the mysterious WMG
886.26	that matched their content ID.
888.26	So I didn't think much about it.
890.26	And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,
892.26	"""Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"""
895.26	imagining that I had this deep conspiracy
897.26	to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
900.26	"I answered, ""No."" I didn't even think about it."
902.26	But then I went to the site
905.26	and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
909.26	My whole 45-minute video
911.26	had been silenced
913.26	because there were snippets in that video,
915.26	a video about fair use,
918.26	that included Warner Music Group music.
921.26	Now, interestingly,
923.26	they still sold ads for that music,
925.26	if you played the silent video.
927.26	You could still buy the music,
929.26	but you couldn't hear anything
931.26	because it had been silenced.
933.26	So I did what the current regime
935.26	says I must do
937.26	to be free to use
939.26	YouTube to talk about fair use.
942.26	I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
945.26	And then in an extraordinarily
947.26	Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way
950.26	you've actually got to type out these words
953.26	and get them right
955.26	to reassert your freedom to speak.
957.26	And I felt like I was in third grade again.
960.26	"""I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
963.26	"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."""
967.26	This is absurd.
969.26	It is outrageous.
971.26	It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom
973.26	we should be encouraging.
975.26	And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?
977.26	Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,
980.26	who was the number one, active
982.26	opponent of this system of regulation
985.26	in online speech?
987.26	John McCain.
989.26	Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal
992.26	to be more respectful of fair use
995.26	with their extraordinary notice and take down system,
997.26	that led his campaign so many times
999.26	to be thrown off the Internet.
1002.26	Now, that was the story of me then,
1005.26	my good old days of right-wing lunacy.
1008.26	Let me come back to now,
1010.26	now when I'm a little leftist --
1012.26	I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --
1015.26	And I wonder, can we on the Left
1018.26	expect to build this
1021.26	ecology of freedom, now,
1023.26	in a world where
1026.26	we know the extraordinarily powerful
1028.26	influences against it,
1030.26	where even icons of the Left like this
1033.26	entertain and push bills
1036.26	that would effectively ban the requirement
1039.26	of open access for government-funded research?
1043.26	The president, who has supported
1046.26	a process that secretly negotiates agreements,
1049.26	which effectively lock us into the insane system
1052.26	of DMCA
1054.26	that we have adopted
1056.26	and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out
1059.26	that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.
1062.26	Not a single example of reform
1065.26	has been produced yet.
1069.26	And we're not going to see this change
1071.26	in this system
1073.26	anytime soon.
1075.26	So here's the lessons of openness
1078.26	that I think we need to learn.
1081.26	Openness is a commitment
1083.26	to a certain set of values.
1085.26	We need to speak of those values.
1087.26	The value of freedom. It's a value of community.
1090.26	It's a value of the limits in regulation.
1092.26	It's a value respecting the creator.
1096.26	Now, if we can learn those values
1098.26	from at least some influences on the Right,
1100.26	if we can take them and incorporate them,
1102.26	maybe we could do a little trade.
1104.26	We learn those values on the Left,
1107.26	and maybe they'll do health care
1109.26	or global warming legislation or something in the Right.
1111.26	Anyway, please join me
1113.26	in teaching these values.
1115.26	Thank you very much.
1117.26	(Applause)
