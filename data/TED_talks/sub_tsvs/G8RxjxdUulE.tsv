13.015	You may never have heard
13.015	of Kenema, Sierra Leone
15.801	or Arua, Nigeria.
17.357	But I know them as two of the most
17.357	extraordinary places on earth.
21.956	In hospitals there, there's a community
21.956	of nurses, physicians and scientists
27.033	that have been quietly battling
28.614	one of the deadliest threats
28.614	to humanity for years:
31.338	Lassa virus.
33.118	Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola.
35.28	It can cause a severe fever
35.28	and can often be fatal.
39.053	But these individuals,
39.053	they risk their lives every day
43.016	to protect the individuals
43.016	in their communities,
45.957	and by doing so, protect us all.
49.093	But one of the most extraordinary things
49.093	I learned about them
52.025	on one of my first visits
52.025	out there many years ago
54.616	was that they start each morning --
56.349	these challenging, extraordinary days
56.349	on the front lines -- by singing.
61.731	They gather together,
61.731	and they show their joy.
65.094	They show their spirit.
66.64	And over the years,
67.823	from year after year as I've visited them
67.823	and they've visited me,
70.96	I get to gather with them and I sing
72.977	and we write and we love it,
75.175	because it reminds us that we're not
75.175	just there to pursue science together;
78.742	we're bonded through a shared humanity.
81.586	And that of course, as you can imagine,
81.586	becomes extremely important,
85.933	even essential, as things begin to change.
88.73	And that changed a great deal
88.73	in March of 2014,
93.543	when the Ebola outbreak
93.543	was declared in Guinea.
96.426	This is the first outbreak in West Africa,
98.582	near the border
98.582	of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
102.074	And it was frightening,
102.074	frightening for us all.
104.62	We had actually suspected for some time
106.556	that Lassa and Ebola were more
106.556	widespread than thought,
109.222	and we thought it could
109.222	one day come to Kenema.
111.896	And so members of my team
111.896	immediately went out
114.33	and joined Dr. Humarr Khan
114.33	and his team there,
116.751	and we set up diagnostics to be able
116.751	to have sensitive molecular tests
120.452	to pick up Ebola if it came
120.452	across the border
122.629	and into Sierra Leone.
123.916	We'd already set up this kind
123.916	of capacity for Lassa virus,
126.936	we knew how to do it,
128.117	the team is outstanding.
129.571	We just had to give them
129.571	the tools and place to survey for Ebola.
133.34	And unfortunately, that day came.
134.992	On May 23, 2014, a woman checked
134.992	into the maternity ward at the hospital,
139.997	and the team ran
139.997	those important molecular tests
143.747	and they identified the first
143.747	confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
148.107	This was an exceptional
148.107	work that was done.
150.18	They were able to diagnose
150.18	the case immediately,
152.464	to safely treat the patient
154.801	and to begin to do contact tracing
154.801	to follow what was going on.
157.843	It could've stopped something.
159.839	But by the time that day came,
162.71	the outbreak had already
162.71	been breeding for months.
165.092	With hundreds of cases, it had already
165.092	eclipsed all previous outbreaks.
168.756	And it came into Sierra Leone
168.756	not as that singular case,
172.424	but as a tidal wave.
174.12	We had to work
174.12	with the international community,
176.419	with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema,
176.419	to begin to deal with the cases,
180.149	as the next week brought 31,
182.244	then 92, then 147 cases --
182.244	all coming to Kenema,
185.942	one of the only places in Sierra Leone
185.942	that could deal with this.
189.61	And we worked around the clock
189.61	trying to do everything we could,
193.033	trying to help the individuals,
193.033	trying to get attention,
196.018	but we also did one other simple thing.
198.544	From that specimen that we take
198.544	from a patient's blood to detect Ebola,
202.357	we can discard it, obviously.
204.436	The other thing we can do is, actually,
204.436	put in a chemical and deactivate it,
208.076	so just place it into a box
208.076	and ship it across the ocean,
210.83	and that's what we did.
212.005	We sent it to Boston, where my team works.
214.724	And we also worked around the clock
214.724	doing shift work, day after day,
218.585	and we quickly generated 99 genomes
218.585	of the Ebola virus.
222.478	This is the blueprint -- the genome
222.478	of a virus is the blueprint.
225.559	We all have one.
226.742	It says everything that makes up us,
228.711	and it tells us so much information.
230.644	The results of this kind of work
230.644	are simple and they're powerful.
234.396	We could actually take
234.396	these 99 different viruses,
236.89	look at them and compare them,
238.361	and we could see, actually,
238.361	compared to three genomes
241.231	that had been previously
241.231	published from Guinea,
244.091	we could show that the outbreak
244.091	emerged in Guinea months before,
247.826	once into the human population,
249.692	and from there had been transmitting
249.692	from human to human.
252.388	Now, that's incredibly important
253.956	when you're trying to figure out
253.956	how to intervene,
256.348	but the important thing
256.348	is contact tracing.
258.438	We also could see that as the virus
258.438	was moving between humans,
261.864	it was mutating.
263.145	And each of those mutations
263.145	are so important,
265.32	because the diagnostics, the vaccines,
267.664	the therapies that we're using,
269.173	are all based on that genome
269.173	sequence, fundamentally --
272.555	that's what drives it.
273.8	And so global health experts
273.8	would need to respond,
276.706	would have to develop,
277.927	to recalibrate everything
277.927	that they were doing.
281.079	But the way that science works,
281.079	the position I was in at that point
284.284	is, I had the data,
285.459	and I could have worked
285.459	in a silo for many, many months,
288.119	analyzed the data carefully, slowly,
290.342	submitted the paper for publication,
290.342	gone through a few back-and-forths,
293.826	and then finally when the paper came out,
293.826	might release that data.
296.979	That's the way the status quo works.
299.207	Well, that was not going to work
299.207	at this point, right?
301.802	We had friends on the front lines
303.434	and to us it was just obvious
303.434	that what we needed is help,
306.712	lots of help.
307.892	So the first thing we did is,
309.313	as soon as the sequences
309.313	came off the machines,
312.022	we published it to the web.
313.475	We just released it to the whole world
313.475	"and said, ""Help us."""
316.335	And help came.
317.694	Before we knew it,
318.88	we were being contacted
318.88	from people all over,
321.24	surprised to see the data
321.24	out there and released.
323.708	Some of the greatest
323.708	viral trackers in the world
325.984	were suddenly part of our community.
328.087	We were working together
328.087	in this virtual way,
330.441	sharing, regular calls, communications,
333.446	trying to follow the virus
333.446	minute by minute,
336.221	to see ways that we could stop it.
339.027	And there are so many ways
339.027	that we can form communities like that.
343.182	Everybody, particularly when the outbreak
343.182	started to expand globally,
347.531	was reaching out to learn,
347.531	to participate, to engage.
351.788	Everybody wants to play a part.
353.406	The amount of human capacity
353.406	out there is just amazing,
356.21	and the Internet connects us all.
357.957	And could you imagine that instead
357.957	of being frightened of each other,
361.232	"that we all just said, ""Let's do this."
363.113	Let's work together,
363.113	"and let's make this happen."""
365.66	But the problem is that the data
365.66	that all of us are using,
368.426	Googling on the web, is just too limited
368.426	to do what we need to do.
372.487	And so many opportunities
372.487	get missed when that happens.
375.162	So in the early part
375.162	of the epidemic from Kenema,
377.667	we'd had 106 clinical records
377.667	from patients,
380.433	and we once again made that
380.433	publicly available to the world.
383.291	And in our own lab, we could show
383.291	that you could take those 106 records,
386.985	we could train computers to predict
386.985	the prognosis for Ebola patients
390.627	to near 100 percent accuracy.
392.428	And we made an app
392.428	that could release that,
394.549	to make that available
394.549	to health-care workers in the field.
397.343	But 106 is just not enough
397.343	to make it powerful,
400.626	to validate it.
401.801	So we were waiting for more data
401.801	to release that.
404.479	and the data has still not come.
406.547	We are still waiting, tweaking away,
409.103	in silos rather than working together.
411.965	And this just -- we can't accept that.
414.221	Right? You, all of you,
414.221	cannot accept that.
418.049	It's our lives on the line.
419.755	And in fact, actually,
421.49	many lives were lost,
421.49	many health-care workers,
424.057	including beloved colleagues of mine,
425.975	five colleagues:
425.975	Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi,
429.746	Dr. Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma
429.746	and Mohamed Fullah.
433.781	These are just five
433.781	of many health-care workers
436.331	at Kenema and beyond
438.119	that died while the world waited
438.119	and while we all worked,
441.179	quietly and separately.
443.063	See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity,
445.12	it's fueled by mistrust
445.12	and distraction and division.
449.028	When we build barriers amongst ourselves
449.028	and we fight amongst ourselves,
452.825	the virus thrives.
454.669	But unlike all threats to humanity,
456.485	Ebola is one where
456.485	we're actually all the same.
459.155	We're all in this fight together.
461.059	Ebola on one person's doorstep
461.059	could soon be on ours.
464.177	And so in this place
464.177	with the same vulnerabilities,
467.003	the same strengths,
467.003	the same fears, the same hopes,
469.44	I hope that we work together with joy.
474.427	A graduate student of mine
474.427	was reading a book about Sierra Leone,
477.521	"and she discovered that the word ""Kenema,"""
479.879	the hospital that we work at and the city
479.879	where we work in Sierra Leone,
483.346	is named after the Mende word
483.346	"for ""clear like a river, translucent"
487.551	"and open to the public gaze."""
489.439	That was really profound for us,
491.008	because without knowing it,
491.008	we'd always felt
493.126	that in order to honor the individuals
493.126	in Kenema where we worked,
496.334	we had to work openly, we had to share
496.334	and we had to work together.
501.074	And we have to do that.
502.275	We all have to demand that
502.275	of ourselves and others --
506.06	to be open to each other
506.06	when an outbreak happens,
508.958	to fight in this fight together.
510.632	Because this is not the first
510.632	outbreak of Ebola,
513.565	it will not be the last,
515.037	and there are many other microbes
515.037	out there that are lying in wait,
518.216	like Lassa virus and others.
519.665	And the next time this happens,
521.198	it could happen in a city of millions,
521.198	it could start there.
524.418	It could be something
524.418	that's transmitted through the air.
527.141	It could even be
527.141	disseminated intentionally.
529.312	And I know that that is frightening,
529.312	I understand that,
532.317	but I know also,
532.317	and this experience shows us,
534.995	that we have the technology
534.995	and we have the capacity
538.339	to win this thing,
539.958	to win this and have
539.958	the upper hand over viruses.
542.828	But we can only do it if we do it together
545.124	and we do it with joy.
546.871	So for Dr. Khan
548.416	and for all of those who sacrificed
548.416	their lives on the front lines
552.606	in this fight with us always,
555.03	let us be in this fight with them always.
557.861	And let us not let the world be defined
559.76	by the destruction wrought by one virus,
561.903	but illuminated by billions
561.903	of hearts and minds
564.708	working in unity.
565.94	Thank you.
567.138	(Applause)
