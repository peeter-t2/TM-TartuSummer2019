18.861	By day, I'm a venture capitalist.
20.489	On weekends, I love rockets.
22.06	I love photography, I love rockets.
23.833	I'm going to talk
23.833	about a hobby that can scale
26.015	and show you photos
26.015	I've taken over the years
28.147	with kids like these, that hopefully
28.147	will grow up to love rocketry
31.276	and eventually become
31.276	a Richard Branson or Diamandis.
33.798	My son designed a rocket
33.798	that became stable, a golf ball rocket.
36.831	I thought it was quite
36.831	an interesting experiment
39.108	in the principles of rocket science.
40.874	And it flies straight as an arrow.
42.624	Baking soda and vinegar.
44.001	Night shots are beautiful,
45.335	piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.
48.886	2-stage rockets
48.886	with video cameras on them,
51.109	onboard computers logging their flights,
51.109	rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.
54.911	I use RockSim to simulate
54.911	flights before they go
57.178	to see if they'll break supersonic,
58.877	then fly them with onboard computers
58.877	to verify performance.
61.722	To launch the big stuff,
61.722	you go to the middle of nowhere:
64.423	Black Rock Desert,
64.423	where dangerous things happen.
66.782	The boys and the rockets get bigger.
68.545	They use motors
68.545	used on cruise-missile boosters.
71.18	They rumble the belly and leave
71.18	even photographers in awe,
73.933	watching the spectacle.
75.108	These rockets use
75.108	experimental motors like nitrous oxide.
77.918	They use solid propellant most frequently.
79.943	It's a strange kind of love.
81.306	RocketMavericks.com with my photos,
81.306	if you want to learn about this,
84.538	participate, be a spectator.
85.898	We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.
87.899	This one was great, went to 100,000 feet
87.899	-- but didn't quite.
90.797	Actually, it went 11 feet into solid clay
90.797	and became a bunker-buster.
94.098	It had to be dug out.
95.546	Rockets often spiral out of control
95.546	if you put too much propellant in them.
99.322	Here was a drag race.
100.505	At night you can see
100.505	what happened in a second;
102.769	in daytime, we call them land sharks.
104.565	Sometimes they just explode
104.565	before your eyes or come down supersonic.
107.876	(Laughter)
108.909	To take this shot, I did what I often do,
108.909	which is go way beyond the pads,
112.41	where none of the spectators are.
114.034	And if we can run the video,
114.034	I'll show you what it took
116.638	to get this DreamWorks shot.
118.69	(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.
120.69	Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computer
120.69	"failed, they're yelling ""Deploy!"""
124.6	(Video) Man: Oh, shit.
125.775	SJ: This is when they realize
125.775	everything's gone haywire.
128.428	(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.
130.073	SJ: I'll just be quiet.
131.248	(Video) Woman: No!
132.423	Come on, come on, come on.
138.33	SJ: And that's me over there,
138.33	taking photos the whole way.
142.321	Things often go wrong.
143.496	Some people watch this
143.496	because of a NASCAR-like fascination
146.793	with things bumping and grinding.
148.452	Burning the parachute as it fell.
148.452	That was last weekend.
151.193	This guy went up, went supersonic,
151.193	ripped the fin can off.
153.947	The art sale in the sky.
155.122	A burning metal hunk coming back.
156.725	These things dropped
156.725	down from above all through the weekend
159.567	of rocket launch after rocket launch.
161.381	It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.
163.299	I try to capture the mishaps;
163.299	it's a challenge in photography
166.199	when these things take place
166.199	in a fraction of a second.
168.817	Why do it? For things like this:
170.372	Gene from Alabama drives out there
172.543	with this rocket he's built
172.543	with X-ray sensors, video cameras,
175.639	festooned with electronics.
176.954	He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,
178.699	leaving the atmosphere,
178.699	seeing a thin blue line of space.
181.403	It is this breathtaking image --
181.403	success, of course -- that motivates us
184.819	and motivates kids to follow
184.819	and understand rocket science,
187.63	understand the importance
187.63	of physics and math
189.758	and, in many ways,
189.758	to have that awe at exploration
192.117	of the frontiers of the unknown.
193.675	Thank you.
194.85	(Applause)
