12.95	"The Olympic motto is ""Citius, Altius, Fortius."""
16.081	Faster, Higher, Stronger.
18.85	And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.
22.79	The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon
25.946	ran two hours and eight minutes.
28.262	Had he been racing against the winner
29.882	of the 1904 Olympic marathon,
32.348	he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.
35.681	Now we all have this feeling
37.453	that we're somehow just getting better
39.043	as a human race, inexorably progressing,
41.383	but it's not like we've evolved into a new species
43.524	in a century.
44.99	So what's going on here?
47.598	I want to take a look at what's really behind
48.959	this march of athletic progress.
51.649	In 1936, Jesse Owens
53.946	held the world record in the 100 meters.
56.283	Had Jesse Owens been racing last year
58.99	in the world championships of the 100 meters,
61.436	when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,
63.91	Owens would have still had 14 feet to go.
67.318	That's a lot in sprinter land.
69.197	To give you a sense of how much it is,
70.7	I want to share with you a demonstration
72.658	conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.
75.67	Now picture the stadium last year
77.835	at the world championships of the 100 meters:
80.464	thousands of fans waiting with baited breath
82.563	to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;
86.037	flashbulbs popping as the
86.037	nine fastest men in the world
88.912	coil themselves into their blocks.
91.475	And I want you to pretend
92.606	that Jesse Owens is in that race.
94.945	Now close your eyes for a
94.945	second and picture the race.
98.19	Bang! The gun goes off.
99.882	An American sprinter jumps out to the front.
101.95	Usain Bolt starts to catch him.
103.9	Usain Bolt passes him, and as
103.9	the runners come to the finish,
105.521	you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.
108.198	(Beeps)
109.875	That's the entire finish of the race.
112.98	You can open your eyes now.
114.36	That first beep was Usain Bolt.
116.97	That last beep was Jesse Owens.
119.284	Listen to it again.
121.461	(Beeps)
123.179	When you think of it like that,
124.279	it's not that big a difference, is it?
126.55	And then consider that Usain Bolt started
128.407	by propelling himself out of blocks
131.17	down a specially fabricated carpet
133.509	designed to allow him to travel
135.265	as fast as humanly possible.
137.381	Jesse Owens, on the other hand,
139.052	ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,
142.643	and that soft surface stole far more energy
144.88	from his legs as he ran.
146.657	Rather than blocks, Jesse
146.657	Owens had a gardening trowel
149.62	that he had to use to dig holes
149.62	in the cinders to start from.
153.447	Biomechanical analysis of the speed
155.551	of Owens' joints shows that had been running
158.095	on the same surface as Bolt,
159.609	he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,
162.12	he would have been within one stride.
164.439	Rather than the last beep,
166.181	Owens would have been the second beep.
169.121	Listen to it again.
171.172	(Beeps)
172.91	That's the difference track
172.91	surface technology has made,
175.293	and it's done it throughout the running world.
177.572	Consider a longer event.
179.303	In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister
182.266	became the first man to run
182.266	under four minutes in the mile.
185.443	Nowadays, college kids do that every year.
188.493	On rare occasions, a high school kid does it.
191.046	As of the end of last year,
192.788	1,314 men
195.155	had run under four minutes in the mile,
197.37	but like Jesse Owens,
198.82	Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders
201.562	that stole far more energy from his legs
203.386	than the synthetic tracks of today.
205.749	So I consulted biomechanics experts
207.249	to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders
209.813	than synthetic tracks,
211.071	and their consensus that it's
211.071	one and a half percent slower.
214.471	So if you apply a one and a half
214.471	percent slowdown conversion
217.758	to every man who ran his sub-four mile
219.944	on a synthetic track,
221.388	this is what happens.
223.084	Only 530 are left.
225.413	If you look at it from that perspective,
226.81	fewer than ten new men per [year]
229.13	have joined the sub-four mile club
230.613	since Sir Roger Bannister.
232.915	Now, 530 is a lot more than one,
235.982	and that's partly because
235.982	there are many more people
237.498	training today and they're training more intelligently.
240.012	Even college kids are professional in their training
242.24	compared to Sir Roger Bannister,
243.766	who trained for 45 minutes at a time
245.225	while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.
248.315	And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon
250.718	in three in a half hours,
252.429	that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy
254.566	while he ran along the course.
256.598	That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.
259.221	(Laughter)
261.284	Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy
262.972	about performance-enhancing drugs as well,
265.446	and that's made a difference
265.446	in some sports at some times,
267.717	but technology has made a difference in all sports,
270.004	from faster skis to lighter shoes.
272.553	Take a look at the record for
272.553	the 100-meter freestyle swim.
275.693	The record is always trending downward,
278.34	but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.
281.09	This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction
284.011	of the flip turn.
285.24	Rather than stopping and turning around,
287.269	athletes could somersault under the water
289.113	and get going right away in the opposite direction.
291.631	This second cliff, the introduction of gutters
294.423	on the side of the pool
295.955	that allows water to splash off,
297.512	rather than becoming turbulence
298.799	that impedes the swimmers as they race.
301.046	This final cliff,
302.685	the introduction of full-body
303.871	and low-friction swimsuits.
305.768	Throughout sports, technology has
305.768	changed the face of performance.
309.457	In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record
312.233	for the longest distance cycled in one hour
314.557	at 30 miles, 3,774 feet.
318.605	Now that record improved and improved
320.853	as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic
323.872	all the way until 1996,
325.486	when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,
329.921	nearly five miles farther
332.15	than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.
335.295	But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union
338.718	decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record
341.226	had to do so with essentially the same equipment
344.298	that Eddy Merckx used in 1972.
346.963	Where does the record stand today?
352.84	a grand total of 883 feet
355.95	farther than Eddy Merckx cycled
357.726	more than four decades ago.
359.427	Essentially the entire improvement in this record
361.808	was due to technology.
363.86	Still, technology isn't the only
363.86	thing pushing athletes forward.
367.03	While indeed we haven't evolved
368.481	into a new species in a century,
370.198	the gene pool within competitive sports
372.158	most certainly has changed.
374.55	In the early half of the 20th century,
376.459	physical education instructors and coaches
378.144	had the idea that the average body type
380.416	was the best for all athletic endeavors:
382.787	medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.
386.11	And this showed in athletes' bodies.
388.082	In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper
390.335	and average elite shot-putter
390.335	were the same exact size.
394.05	But as that idea started to fade away,
395.96	as sports scientists and coaches realized that
398.036	rather than the average body type,
399.628	you want highly specialized bodies
401.54	that fit into certain athletic niches,
403.87	a form of artificial selection took place,
406.175	a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,
408.798	and athletes' bodies became
408.798	more different from one another.
411.458	Today, rather than the same size
411.458	as the average elite high jumper,
415.414	the average elite shot-putter
416.428	is two and a half inches taller
418.079	and 130 pounds heavier.
421.168	And this happened throughout the sports world.
423.087	In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph
425.752	one data point for each of two dozen sports
428.28	in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.
431.565	There's some dispersal,
433.05	but it's kind of grouped
433.05	around that average body type.
436.06	Then that idea started to go away,
437.639	and at the same time, digital technology --
439.34	first radio, then television and the Internet --
441.547	gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people
443.924	a ticket to consume elite sports performance.
447.103	The financial incentives and fame and glory
447.103	afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,
450.976	and it tipped toward the tiny
450.976	upper echelon of performance.
455.169	It accelerated the artificial
455.169	selection for specialized bodies.
458.596	And if you plot a data point for these same
460.224	two dozen sports today, it looks like this.
464.106	The athletes' bodies have gotten
465.533	much more different from one another.
467.727	And because this chart looks like the charts
469.836	that show the expanding universe,
471.567	with the galaxies flying away from one another,
474.027	the scientists who discovered it call it
475.671	"""The Big Bang of Body Types."""
478.96	In sports where height is prized, like basketball,
481.368	the tall athletes got taller.
483.158	In 1983, the National Basketball Association
486.264	signed a groundbreaking agreement
487.587	making players partners in the league,
489.639	entitled to shares of ticket revenues
491.189	and television contracts.
493.096	Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player
495.299	wanted to be,
496.495	and teams started scouring the globe
498.341	for the bodies that could
498.341	help them win championships.
500.621	Almost overnight,
502.364	the proportion of men in the NBA
503.742	who are at least seven feet tall doubled
505.634	to 10 percent.
507.399	Today, one in 10 men in the NBA
509.422	is at least seven feet tall,
511.604	but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare
513.753	in the general population --
515.272	so rare that if you know an American man
517.922	between the ages of 20 and 40
519.327	who is at least seven feet tall,
521.463	there's a 17 percent chance
523.235	he's in the NBA right now.
525.04	(Laughter)
527.978	That is, find six honest seven footers,
530.854	one is in the NBA right now.
534.084	And that's not the only way that
534.084	NBA players' bodies are unique.
536.913	"This is Leonardo da Vinci's ""Vitruvian Man,"""
539.528	the ideal proportions,
540.951	with arm span equal to height.
542.95	My arm span is exactly equal to my height.
545.458	Yours is probably very nearly so.
547.594	But not the average NBA player.
549.756	"The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7"","
552.563	with arms that are seven feet long.
554.874	Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall,
557.672	they are ludicrously long.
559.95	Had Leonardo wanted to draw
560.955	the Vitruvian NBA Player,
562.93	he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,
564.903	not a circle and a square.
567.685	So in sports where large size is prized,
569.85	the large athletes have gotten larger.
571.921	Conversely, in sports where
571.921	diminutive stature is an advantage,
574.9	the small athletes got smaller.
577.117	The average elite female gymnast
578.78	"shrunk from 5'3"" to 4'9"" on average"
581.543	over the last 30 years,
582.88	all the better for their power-to-weight ratio
584.995	and for spinning in the air.
586.765	And while the large got larger
588.127	and the small got smaller,
589.491	the weird got weirder.
591.919	The average length of the forearm
593.469	of a water polo player in relation
595.22	to their total arm got longer,
597.077	all the better for a forceful throwing whip.
599.206	And as the large got larger,
600.933	small got smaller, and the weird weirder.
603.303	In swimming, the ideal body type
605.496	is a long torso and short legs.
607.391	It's like the long hull of a canoe
609.33	for speed over the water.
611.036	And the opposite is advantageous in running.
612.801	You want long legs and a short torso.
614.816	And this shows in athletes' bodies today.
617.012	Here you see Michael Phelps,
618.607	the greatest swimmer in history,
620.071	standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj,
622.94	the world record holder in the mile.
624.927	These men are seven inches different in height,
627.744	but because of the body types
628.946	advantaged in their sports,
630.809	they wear the same length pants.
633.197	Seven inches difference in height,
634.691	these men have the same length legs.
637.211	Now in some cases, the search for bodies
639.169	that could push athletic performance forward
641.142	ended up introducing into the competitive world
643.785	populations of people that weren't
643.785	previously competing at all,
646.924	like Kenyan distance runners.
649.676	We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.
653.006	Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe
655.384	as being great marathoners.
657.484	The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent
659.579	of the Kenyan population
661.376	but the vast majority of elite runners.
663.545	And they happen, on average,
664.851	to have a certain unique physiology:
666.955	legs that are very long
668.036	and very thin at their extremity,
670.574	and this is because they have their ancestry
671.992	at very low latitude
673.427	in a very hot and dry climate,
675.842	and an evolutionary adaptation to that
677.732	is limbs that are very long
678.69	and very thin at the extremity
680.209	for cooling purposes.
681.983	It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,
685.012	to increase surface area compared to volume
686.854	to let heat out,
688.796	and because the leg is like a pendulum,
690.309	the longer and thinner it is at the extremity,
691.966	the more energy-efficient it is to swing.
694.745	To put Kalenjin running success in perspective,
697.339	consider that 17 American men in history
700.066	have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes
702.695	in the marathon.
703.984	That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.
707.031	Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.
709.966	(Laughter)
712.06	That's from a source population the size
713.881	of metropolitan Atlanta.
716.708	Still, even changing technology
718.282	and the changing gene pool in sports
719.888	don't account for all of the changes in performance.
722.361	Athletes have a different mindset than they once did.
725.251	Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets
726.62	an electrical shock
727.892	and they're thrown across a room?
730.215	There's no explosion there.
731.786	What's happening when that happens is that
733.024	the electrical impulse is causing
734.486	all their muscle fibers to twitch at once,
736.616	and they're throwing themselves across the room.
739.21	They're essentially jumping.
741.107	That's the power
742.284	that's contained in the human body.
744.233	But normally we can't access nearly all of it.
746.46	Our brain acts as a limiter,
748.479	preventing us from accessing
748.479	all of our physical resources,
750.774	because we might hurt ourselves,
752.015	tearing tendons or ligaments.
753.707	But the more we learn about
753.707	how that limiter functions,
756.73	the more we learn how we can push it back
758.61	just a bit,
760.05	in some cases by convincing the brain
762.482	that the body won't be in mortal danger
764.256	by pushing harder.
766.066	Endurance and ultra-endurance sports
767.685	serve as a great example.
769.257	Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful
771.379	to human health,
772.794	but now we realize
774.212	that we have all these traits
775.308	that are perfect for ultra-endurance:
778.412	no body fur and a glut of sweat glands
781.336	that keep us cool while running;
782.952	narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;
786.352	large surface area of joints for shock absorption.
789.27	We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,
792.004	short toes that are better for pushing off
794.107	than for grasping tree limbs,
795.781	and when we run,
796.908	we can turn our torso and our shoulders
798.433	like this while keeping our heads straight.
800.477	Our primate cousins can't do that.
801.96	They have to run like this.
804.27	And we have big old butt muscles
806.336	that keep us upright while running.
808.423	Have you ever looked at an ape's butt?
810.141	They have no buns because they don't run upright.
813.146	And as athletes have realized
814.533	that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,
817.09	they've taken on feats
818.137	that would have been unthinkable before,
820.546	athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.
824.449	Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.
826.449	(Laughter)
827.961	With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.
830.57	It's so steep he can't even run here.
832.292	He's pulling up on a rope.
833.945	This is a vertical ascent
835.282	of more than 8,000 feet,
837.391	and Kílian went up and down
839.058	in under three hours.
841.439	Amazing.
843.358	And talented though he is,
844.547	Kílian is not a physiological freak.
847.371	Now that he has done this,
849.05	other athletes will follow,
850.961	just as other athletes followed
852.478	after Sir Roger Bannister
854.052	ran under four minutes in the mile.
856.19	Changing technology, changing genes,
857.817	and a changing mindset.
860.215	Innovation in sports,
861.999	whether that's new track surfaces
863.656	or new swimming techniques,
865.12	the democratization of sport,
866.99	the spread to new bodies
868.331	and to new populations around the world,
870.916	and imagination in sport,
872.969	an understanding of what the human body
874.405	is truly capable of,
876.186	have conspired to make athletes stronger,
878.078	faster, bolder,
880.601	and better than ever.
882.578	Thank you very much.
884.934	(Applause)
