15.26	I was one of the founding members
15.26	of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
19.76	The other founding members
19.76	included Ahmed Ahmed,
22.355	who is an Egyptian-American,
22.355	who actually had the idea
25.33	to go to the Middle East and try it out
25.33	before we went out as a tour.
28.633	He went out solo and did it first.
30.311	Then there was Aron Kader,
30.311	who was the Palestinian-American.
33.26	And then there was me,
33.26	the Iranian-American of the group.
36.26	Now, being Iranian-American
36.26	presents its own set of problems,
39.28	as you know.
40.475	Those two countries
40.475	aren't getting along these days.
42.976	So it causes a lot of inner
42.976	conflict, you know,
45.26	like part of me likes me,
45.26	part of me hates me.
47.466	(Laughter)
48.49	Part of me thinks I should
48.49	have a nuclear program,
50.871	the other part thinks
50.871	I can't be trusted with one.
53.326	These are dilemmas I have every day.
55.962	But I was born in Iran;
55.962	I'm now an American citizen,
58.713	which means I have the American passport,
60.713	which means I can travel.
63.26	Because if you only have
63.26	the Iranian passport,
65.475	you're kind of limited to the countries
65.475	you can go to with open arms,
69	you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.
71.3	(Laughter)
74.147	So, anyone who's gotten their passport
74.147	in America will tell you,
77.528	when you get it, it still says
77.528	what country you were born in.
80.459	So I remember getting
80.459	my American passport.
82.518	"I was like, ""Woo-hoo!"
82.518	"I'm going to travel."""
84.602	"And I opened it up, it said, ""Born"
84.602	"in Iran."" I'm like, ""Oh, come on, man!"""
88.152	(Laughter)
89.201	"""I'm trying to go places."""
90.495	(Laughter)
91.579	But what's interesting is,
92.845	I've never had trouble in any Western
92.845	countries with my American passport,
96.381	even though it says,
96.381	"""Born in Iran"" -- no problems."
98.815	Where I've had problems
98.815	is in some of the Arab countries.
101.518	I guess some of the Arab countries
101.518	aren't getting along with Iran either.
105.023	So I was in Kuwait recently,
105.023	doing a comedy show
107.343	with some other American comedians.
109.062	They all went through.
110.239	Then the border patrol saw my American
110.239	"passport: ""Ah-ha! American, great."""
113.861	Then he opened it up.
113.861	"""Born in Iran? Wait."""
115.934	(Laughter)
117.494	And he started asking me questions.
119.214	"He said, ""What is your father's name?"""
121.684	"I said, ""Well, he's passed away,"
121.684	"but his name was Khosro."""
124.777	"He goes, ""What"
124.777	"is your grandfather's name?"""
127.206	"I said, ""He passed away a long time ago."
129.274	"His name was Jabbar."""
130.842	"He says, ""You wait. I'll be back,"""
130.842	and he walked away.
133.422	And I started freaking out,
134.739	because I don't know what kind
134.739	of crap my grandfather was into.
137.783	(Laughter)
140.015	Thought the guy was going
140.015	to come back and be like,
142.459	"""We've been looking"
142.459	"for you for 200 years."""
144.532	(Laughter)
147.458	"""Your grandfather has"
147.458	a parking violation. It's way overdue.
151.021	"You owe us two billion dollars."""
152.838	(Laughter)
154.534	But as you can see, when I talk,
154.534	I speak with an American accent,
157.711	which you would think,
157.711	as an Iranian-American actor,
160.362	I should be able to play any part,
160.362	good, bad, what have you.
163.261	But a lot of times in Hollywood,
164.866	when casting directors find out
164.866	you're of Middle Eastern descent,
167.956	"they go, ""Oh, you're Iranian. Great!"
169.699	Can you say 'I will kill you
169.699	"in the name of Allah?'"""
172.402	"I go, ""I could say that,"
172.402	but what if I were to say,
174.845	"'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"""
176.26	"They go, ""Great! And then"
176.26	"you hijack the hospital."""
178.915	(Laughter)
184.356	Like, I think you're
184.356	missing the point here.
187.156	Don't get me wrong,
187.156	I don't mind playing bad guys.
189.554	I want to play a bad guy.
189.554	I want to rob a bank.
191.777	I want to rob a bank in a film,
193.607	but do it with a gun, not with a bomb
193.607	strapped around me, right?
196.904	(Laughter)
198.144	Because I imagine the director:
198.144	"""Maz, I think your character"
201.142	would rob the bank
201.142	"with a bomb around him."""
203.767	"""Why would I do that?"
205.83	If I want the money,
205.83	"why would I kill myself?"""
208.26	(Laughter)
211.375	Right?
212.575	(Applause)
215.534	"""Gimme all your money,"
215.534	"or I'll blow myself up!"""
217.945	(Laughter)
221.815	"""Well, then blow yourself up."
223.564	(Laughter)
224.844	"Just do it outside, please."""
226.416	(Laughter)
230.28	But the fact is, there's good
230.28	people everywhere.
232.546	That's what I try and show in my stand-up,
232.546	good people everywhere.
235.686	All it takes in one person to mess it up.
237.671	Like a couple months ago
237.671	in Times Square in New York,
240.173	there was a Pakistani Muslim guy
240.173	who tried to blow up a car bomb.
243.257	Now, I happened to be in Times Square
243.257	that night doing a comedy show.
246.523	And a few months before that, there
246.523	was a white American guy in Austin, Texas
250.173	who flew his airplane
250.173	into the IRS building,
252.887	and I happened to be in Austin that day
252.887	doing a stand-up comedy show.
257.26	Now I'll tell you,
257.26	as a Middle-Eastern male,
259.38	when you show up around a lot
259.38	of these activities,
262.148	you start feeling guilty at one point.
264.118	(Laughter)
265.143	I was watching the news. I'm like,
265.143	"""Am I involved in this crap?"""
268.256	(Laughter)
273.18	"""I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"""
275.386	(Laughter)
277.335	But what was interesting was,
278.752	the Pakistani Muslim guy --
278.752	see, he gives a bad name to Muslims
281.787	and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis
281.787	from all over the world.
284.721	And one thing that happened there
284.721	was also the Pakistani Taliban
287.842	took credit for that failed car bombing.
290.26	My question is: Why would you take credit
290.26	for a failed car bombing?
294.558	"""We just want to say:"
296.79	"we tried."""
298.003	(Laughter)
302.412	"""And furthermore ..."
303.912	(Laughter)
305.085	"it is the thought that counts."""
306.708	(Laughter)
308.43	(Applause)
315.26	"""And in conclusion, win some, lose some."""
317.394	(Laughter)
319.459	But what happened was, when the white guy
319.459	flew his plane into the building,
323.033	I know all my Middle Eastern
323.033	and Muslim friends in the States
325.922	were watching TV, going,
327.102	"""Please, don't be Middle Eastern."
327.102	"Don't be Hassan or Hussein."""
330.186	And the name came out: Jack.
330.186	"I'm like, ""Woooo! That's not one of us!"""
334.501	But I kept watching the news
334.501	in case they came back,
337.069	"and were like, ""Before he did it,"
337.069	"he converted to Islam."""
339.879	"""Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"""
343.881	But the fact is, I've been lucky
345.53	to get a chance to perform
345.53	all over the world,
347.722	and I did a lot of shows
347.722	in the Middle East.
349.855	I just did a seven-country solo tour.
351.672	I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.
354.014	I was in Dubai.
355.26	And it's great, there's good
355.26	people everywhere.
357.483	And you learn great things
357.483	about these places.
359.658	I encourage people always
359.658	to go visit these places.
362.106	For example, Dubai -- cool place.
363.708	They're obsessed with having the biggest,
363.708	tallest, longest, as we all know.
367.292	They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.
369.238	It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
371.928	"I was walking. I heard, ""Beep! Beep!"""
371.928	"I'm like, ""What are you doing here?"""
375.587	"He goes, ""I'm going to the Zara store."
375.587	It's three miles away.
378.507	Out of my way. Out of my way.
378.507	"Out of my way."""
380.835	(Laughter)
382.109	And what's crazy -- there's a recession
382.109	going on, even in Dubai,
385.201	but you wouldn't know by the prices.
386.999	Like in the Dubai Mall,
386.999	they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.
391.301	It's like a drug deal.
393.26	I was walking by. The guy goes,
393.26	"""Psst! Habibi, my friend."""
396.26	(Laughter)
398.424	"""You want some frozen yogurt?"
400.077	(Laughter)
401.648	Come here. Come here. Come here.
403.765	I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram.
403.765	"How many gram do you want?"""
406.873	(Laughter)
407.937	I bought five grams. 10 dollars.
411.26	"He's like, ""Good stuff, man."
411.26	"Colombian. Top of the line."""
414.024	(Laughter)
415.086	The other thing you learn
415.086	when you travel in these countries,
417.988	in the Middle East, Latin American,
417.988	South American countries,
420.888	a lot of times when they build stuff,
420.888	there's no rules and regulations.
424.26	For example, I took my two-year-old son
424.26	to the playground at the Dubai Mall.
427.92	And I've taken him to playgrounds
427.92	all over the United States.
430.855	And when you put your two-year-old
430.855	on a slide in the United States,
434.076	they put something on the slide
436.015	to slow the kid down
436.015	as he comes down the slide.
439.103	Not in the Middle East.
440.717	(Laughter)
443.188	I put my two-year-old on the slide,
443.188	he went whoosh! He took off!
446.437	(Laughter)
447.563	"I went down and, ""Where's my son?"""
447.563	"""On the third floor, sir. Third floor."""
451.202	(Laughter)
453.14	"""You take a taxi."
453.14	"You go to Zara. Make a left."""
455.523	(Laughter)
458.083	"""Try the yogurt. It's very good."
458.083	"Little expensive."""
460.824	(Laughter)
462.931	But one thing I try to do
462.931	with my stand-up is break stereotypes.
466.001	And I've been guilty
466.001	of stereotyping as well.
468.138	I was in Dubai. And there's a lot
468.138	of Indians who work in Dubai.
471.126	And they don't get paid that well.
472.781	And I got it in my head that all
472.781	the Indians must be workers.
475.682	I forgot there's obviously
475.682	successful Indians in Dubai too.
478.52	I was doing a show, and they said,
478.52	"""We'll send a driver to pick you up."""
481.961	I went down to the lobby,
481.961	and saw this Indian guy.
484.355	"I go, ""He must be my driver,"""
485.772	since he's standing there in a cheap
485.772	suit, thin mustache, staring at me.
489.205	"I say, ""Excuse me, are you my driver?"""
491.083	"He goes, ""No, sir. I own the hotel."""
492.884	(Laughter)
497.354	"I go, ""I'm sorry!"
497.354	"Why were you staring at me?"""
499.596	"He goes, ""I thought you were my driver."""
501.662	(Laughter)
504.196	(Applause)
512.473	(Laughter)
515.422	I'll leave you with this: I try,
515.422	with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,
518.827	present Middle Easterners
518.827	and Muslims in a positive light.
521.611	I hope that in the coming years,
523.21	more film and television programs
523.21	come out of Hollywood,
525.915	presenting us in a positive light.
527.717	Who knows? Maybe one day,
527.717	we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?
531.669	"""My name is Bond."
532.854	"Jamal Bond."""
534.039	(Laughter)
535.506	Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
535.506	Hope you keep laughing.
538.253	Have a good day. Thank you.
539.574	(Applause)
