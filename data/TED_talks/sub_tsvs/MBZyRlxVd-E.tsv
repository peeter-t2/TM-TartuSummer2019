12	I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,
16	just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century
21	also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
25	"He said, ""A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --"
30	a part limited in time and space.
33	He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,
36	as something separated from the rest,
39	a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
43	This delusion is a kind of prison for us,
46	restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
52	Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,
58	"to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."""
62	This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,
67	"wherein compassion -- ""karuna,"" it is called --"
71	"is defined as, ""the sensitivity to another's suffering"
74	"and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."""
79	It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,
83	which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself
87	and wishes to share it.
90	This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness
93	and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,
97	and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern
102	suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free
106	and, implicitly, more happy.
108	The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
113	It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
116	Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering
120	as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had
125	and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,
128	even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
133	In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,
136	his own becomes less and less monumental.
139	And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.
145	And this immediately cheers him up,
147	as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.
151	Thus, he uses his own suffering
153	as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
157	He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.
161	Now, I want to tell a story,
163	which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,
166	of the great Saint Asanga
168	who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West
171	and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.
173	And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.
177	And he was discontented with the state of people's practice
180	of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
182	"And so he said, ""I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine."
186	They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,
189	but they are acting selfish and pathetic.
192	So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
195	I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,
198	"but exists currently in a certain heaven"" -- that's Maitreya --"
202	"""so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate"
205	and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,
209	and gives me a teaching or something
211	"to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."""
215	So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years
218	and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
220	And he left in disgust.
223	And as he was leaving, he saw a man --
226	a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.
229	And he had a lump of iron.
232	And he was rubbing it with a cloth.
234	And he became interested in that.
236	"He said, ""Well what are you doing?"""
238	"And the man said, ""I'm making a needle."""
243	"And he said, ""That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle"
245	"by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."""
247	"And the man said, ""Really?"" And he showed him a dish full of needles."
250	"So he said, ""Okay, I get the point."""
252	He went back to his cave. He meditated again.
255	Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.
258	This time, he comes down.
260	And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
264	And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,
268	its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock
272	six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock
275	by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
278	"So he said, ""All right. I get the point."" He went back."
280	Another three years.
282	Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
284	And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,
287	making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
291	And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.
295	And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right
297	to see any encouraging vision.
299	And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
302	And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog
305	who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,
310	even in America, I think, in some areas --
312	and he's looking just terrible.
314	And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,
317	and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
320	And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
325	Some of it is like gangrenous,
327	and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.
330	"He thinks, ""What can I do to fix up this dog?"
333	"Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."""
336	So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,
338	but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.
342	And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.
345	And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
348	"""Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?"
352	That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,
355	and everything is all hopeless.
357	"And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"""
360	So, he had a brilliant idea.
362	And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,
367	and he placed it on ground.
369	He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.
373	He was just immediately caught with the situation.
375	"So he thought, ""I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,"
378	then clean the dog's wounds, and then
381	"I'll figure out what to do with the maggots."""
384	So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.
386	Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.
390	"So he says, ""Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh."
394	"And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue"" --"
396	the dog is kind of used up --
398	"""and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."""
401	So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.
404	And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
409	And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.
411	He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya
415	in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,
422	an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.
424	"And he says, ""Oh."" He bows."
426	But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
430	So as he comes up from his first bow he says,
432	"""My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?"
436	"What is this?"""
438	"And Maitreya says, ""I was with you. Who do you think was making needles"
441	"and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"""
445	(Laughter)
447	"""Looking for the Buddha in person,"" he said."
450	"And he said, ""You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion."
456	"And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."""
459	"""Maitreya"" means love, ""the loving one,"" in Sanskrit."
463	And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.
465	"And he said, ""If you don't believe me, just take me with you."""
468	And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --
473	took him on his shoulder.
475	"And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, ""Rejoice! Rejoice!"
479	"The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."""
483	And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --
486	it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --
489	because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,
493	like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,
498	shouting that the future Buddha had come.
500	So, naturally, they chased him out of town.
502	But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,
507	saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,
511	but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.
515	So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
518	Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven,
520	which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
523	And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,
525	dictating to him five complicated tomes
529	of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
532	And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.
535	"A famous one, it's called the ""Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."""
540	And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --
547	even animals too, but everyone is in human form.
551	The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.
554	And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.
559	And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.
562	"And then you try to say, ""Well, the loved ones I love."
566	But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
568	I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
570	I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.
573	So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.
577	While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.
581	And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
585	"But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."""
588	And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,
592	we've all been each other's relatives, actually.
596	Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,
598	in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,
602	have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
607	And also, actually, I've been your mother.
610	I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,
613	the way the Buddhists reflect.
615	So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way
618	are part of the eternal mother.
621	"You gave me that expression; ""the eternal mama,"" you said. That's wonderful."
625	So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
627	A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.
632	So, in that sense, we're related.
634	So, they first create this foundation of equality.
637	So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --
641	just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.
645	"And we definitely reduce the hostility and the ""I don't want to be compassionate to them"""
649	to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.
654	And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
657	"And then the next thing we do is what is called ""mother recognition."""
661	And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.
666	We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,
671	and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
675	And we see the mother in every being.
677	We see that look that the mother has on her face,
680	looking at this child that is a miracle
682	that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,
685	where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.
689	Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.
693	And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.
696	The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,
700	in spiritual traditions.
703	And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
709	People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that
712	I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,
716	when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.
721	I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
724	He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.
727	And you think of him as nursing you.
730	And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,
733	but you think of him as a mom.
736	And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,
738	and you see how they could be familiar to you.
742	And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.
746	You can feel the familiarity of all beings.
748	"Nobody seems alien. They're not ""other."""
750	You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
753	Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,
758	if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,
760	if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,
762	or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
765	And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
770	You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.
773	And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.
777	Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.
782	"And then, third, you step from there to what is called ""a feeling of gratitude."""
786	You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.
790	"And then the fourth step, you go to what is called ""lovely love."""
794	In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days
796	depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.
800	And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,
805	when they are satisfied.
807	And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.
811	Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,
815	but when they're happy they look beautiful.
817	And so you see beings in their potential happiness.
820	And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
823	We think Jesus is being unrealistic
825	"when he says, ""Love thine enemy."""
829	He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic
832	"and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. ""Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."""
835	But, actually, that's practical.
837	If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
840	If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
844	How boring to run around chasing you.
846	They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.
849	So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,
851	because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
854	"But anyway, that's the ""lovely love. """
856	"And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, ""universal compassion."""
860	And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.
866	And you look at them, and you see how they are.
868	And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
872	You see that furrowed brow in people.
874	And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.
877	They're driven by this duty and this obligation.
879	"""I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."""
883	And they're rushing around all stressed out.
885	And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
889	But actually they are cruel to themselves.
892	And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
894	And they, then, never get any positive feedback.
896	And the more they succeed and the more power they have,
898	the more unhappy they are.
900	And this is where you feel real compassion for them.
903	And you then feel you must act.
906	And the choice of the action, of course,
908	hopefully will be more practical
912	than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog
916	because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,
919	he wanted to help.
921	But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town
925	and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.
928	And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.
934	"And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond ""universal compassion"" --"
938	is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,
942	and you have compassion for yourself also,
945	and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
948	Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy
951	being more and more mean to other people
953	and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.
956	And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
959	Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.
962	And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,
964	by dying, but they don't.
967	And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
970	Never mind. I won't get into that.
972	"But the next step is called ""universal responsibility."""
975	And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion
978	must lead us to develop through true compassion,
981	"what is called ""universal responsibility."""
983	In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama
987	that he always teaches everywhere, he says
989	that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.
992	"But ""kindness"" means ""universal responsibility."""
994	And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:
998	we are responsible for that, and we should take it
1002	and do whatever we can at whatever little level
1004	and small level that we can do it.
1006	We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.
1010	And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life
1014	where we live equally for ourselves and for others
1018	and we are
1022	joyful and happy.
1024	One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.
1027	Compassion makes you happy.
1029	The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,
1033	even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.
1035	Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:
1040	they can sense this new quality in yourself,
1043	and it helps them already, and gives them an example.
1045	And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.
1049	So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it
1054	and develop it within yourself.
1056	"Don't just think, ""Well, I'm compassionate,"" or ""I'm not compassionate,"""
1059	and sort of think you're stuck there.
1061	You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,
1064	the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,
1068	and take universal responsibility for them.
1070	And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,
1075	but Karen Armstrong will smile.
1077	Thank you very much. (Applause)
