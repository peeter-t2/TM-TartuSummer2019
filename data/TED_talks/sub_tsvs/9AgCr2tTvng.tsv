12.841	So I know TED is about a lot
12.841	of things that are big,
16.596	but I want to talk to you
16.596	about something very small.
20.15	So small, it's a single word.
23.093	"The word is ""misfit."""
25.347	It's one of my favorite words,
25.347	because it's so literal.
29.403	I mean, it's a person
29.403	who sort of missed fitting in.
33.752	Or a person who fits in badly.
36.658	"Or this: ""a person who is poorly adapted"
39.605	"to new situations and environments."""
43.298	I'm a card-carrying misfit.
46.307	And I'm here for the other
46.307	misfits in the room,
49.164	because I'm never the only one.
51.995	I'm going to tell you a misfit story.
55.237	Somewhere in my early 30s,
57.793	the dream of becoming a writer
57.793	came right to my doorstep.
62.198	Actually, it came to my mailbox
63.826	in the form of a letter that said
63.826	I'd won a giant literary prize
67.509	for a short story I had written.
70.183	The short story was about my life
70.183	as a competitive swimmer
74.632	and about my crappy home life,
77.258	and a little bit about how grief
77.258	and loss can make you insane.
83.829	The prize was a trip to New York City
83.829	to meet big-time editors and agents
88.526	and other authors.
90.278	So kind of it was the wannabe
90.278	writer's dream, right?
94.573	You know what I did the day
94.573	the letter came to my house?
98.037	Because I'm me,
99.859	I put the letter on my kitchen table,
102.08	I poured myself a giant glass of vodka
105.922	with ice and lime,
108.722	and I sat there in my underwear
108.722	for an entire day,
112.95	just staring at the letter.
116.608	I was thinking about all the ways
116.608	I'd already screwed my life up.
119.777	Who the hell was I to go to New York City
122.975	and pretend to be a writer?
125.681	Who was I?
127.07	I'll tell you.
128.745	I was a misfit.
130.625	Like legions of other children,
133.908	I came from an abusive household
136.3	that I narrowly escaped with my life.
139.727	I already had two epically
139.727	failed marriages underneath my belt.
144.242	I'd flunked out of college
144.242	not once but twice
147.232	and maybe even a third time
147.232	that I'm not going to tell you about.
150.448	(Laughter)
152.582	And I'd done an episode
152.582	of rehab for drug use.
156.795	And I'd had two lovely
156.795	staycations in jail.
162.228	So I'm on the right stage.
165.68	(Laughter)
168.744	But the real reason,
168.744	I think, I was a misfit,
172.261	is that my daughter died
172.261	the day she was born,
175.547	and I hadn't figured out
175.547	how to live with that story yet.
180.233	After my daughter died
180.233	I also spent a long time homeless,
185.384	living under an overpass
187.352	in a kind of profound state
187.352	of zombie grief and loss
191.594	that some of us encounter along the way.
194.132	Maybe all of us, if you live long enough.
198.24	You know, homeless people
198.24	are some of our most heroic misfits,
202.261	because they start out as us.
206.67	So you see, I'd missed fitting in
206.67	to just about every category out there:
212.112	daughter, wife, mother, scholar.
217.474	And the dream of being a writer
219.997	was really kind of like a small,
219.997	sad stone in my throat.
226.906	It was pretty much in spite of myself
226.906	that I got on that plane
230.399	and flew to New York City,
232.81	where the writers are.
235.168	Fellow misfits, I can almost
235.168	see your heads glowing.
238.867	I can pick you out of a room.
240.803	At first, you would've loved it.
243.265	You got to choose the three
243.265	famous writers you wanted to meet,
246.241	and these guys went
246.241	and found them for you.
248.623	You got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,
251.437	where you got to drink Scotch
251.437	late in the night
254.095	with cool, smart, swank people.
256.61	And you got to pretend you were cool
256.61	and smart and swank, too.
261.143	And you got to meet a bunch
261.143	of editors and authors and agents
264.355	at very, very fancy lunches and dinners.
269.377	Ask me how fancy.
271.735	Audience: How fancy?
274.077	Lidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession:
274.077	I stole three linen napkins --
278.419	(Laughter)
280.014	from three different restaurants.
282.43	And I shoved a menu down my pants.
284.72	(Laughter)
286.82	I just wanted some keepsakes
286.82	so that when I got home,
290.55	I could believe it had really
290.55	happened to me.
293.241	You know?
295.467	The three writers I wanted to meet
297.155	were Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman
297.155	and Peggy Phelan.
300.496	These were not famous,
300.496	best-selling authors,
303.574	but to me, they were women-writer titans.
307.7	Carole Maso wrote the book
307.7	that later became my art bible.
312.056	Lynne Tillman gave me
312.056	permission to believe
314.581	that there was a chance
314.581	my stories could be part of the world.
318.839	And Peggy Phelan reminded me
320.817	that maybe my brains
320.817	could be more important than my boobs.
327.5	They weren't mainstream women writers,
330.208	but they were cutting a path
330.208	through the mainstream
334.009	with their body stories,
336.294	I like to think, kind of the way
336.294	water cut the Grand Canyon.
341.371	It nearly killed me with joy
343.106	to hang out with these three
343.106	over-50-year-old women writers.
346.971	And the reason it nearly
346.971	killed me with joy
349.921	is that I'd never known a joy like that.
352.014	I'd never been in a room like that.
354.35	My mother never went to college.
356.747	And my creative career to that point
359.26	was a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.
365.394	So kind of in those first nights
365.394	in New York I wanted to die there.
368.697	"I was just like, ""Kill me now."
368.697	"I'm good. This is beautiful."""
373.187	Some of you in the room
373.187	will understand what happened next.
376.935	First, they took me to the offices
376.935	of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
381.863	Farrar, Straus and Giroux
381.863	was like my mega-dream press.
385.062	I mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor
385.062	were published there.
389.418	The main editor guy sat me down
389.418	and talked to me for a long time,
393.817	trying to convince me I had a book in me
396.159	about my life as a swimmer.
398.498	You know, like a memoir.
400.63	The whole time he was talking to me,
402.89	I sat there smiling and nodding
402.89	like a numb idiot,
407.509	with my arms crossed over my chest,
409.385	while nothing, nothing, nothing
409.385	came out of my throat.
415.875	So in the end, he patted me
415.875	on the shoulder
419.266	like a swim coach might.
421.58	And he wished me luck
423.439	and he gave me some free books
425.901	and he showed me out the door.
429.588	Next, they took me
429.588	to the offices of W.W. Norton,
432.879	where I was pretty sure
432.879	I'd be escorted from the building
435.603	just for wearing Doc Martens.
438.19	But that didn't happen.
440.512	Being at the Norton offices
442.965	felt like reaching up into the night sky
442.965	and touching the moon
447.461	while the stars stitched your name
447.461	across the cosmos.
451.599	I mean, that's how big
451.599	a deal it was to me.
453.768	You get it?
455.567	Their lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,
458.089	leaned over right in my face
458.089	with these beady, bright, fierce eyes
462.456	"and said, ""Well, send me"
462.456	"something then, immediately!"""
466.328	See, now most people,
466.328	especially TED people,
468.644	would have run to the mailbox, right?
471.651	It took me over a decade to even imagine
474.953	putting something in an envelope
474.953	and licking a stamp.
480.741	On the last night,
482.339	I gave a big reading
482.339	at the National Poetry Club.
486.342	And at the end of the reading,
488.313	Katharine Kidde of Kidde,
488.313	Hoyt &amp; Picard Literary Agency,
492.64	walked straight up to me and shook my hand
495.251	and offered me representation,
495.251	like, on the spot.
500.558	I stood there and I kind of went deaf.
503.569	Has this ever happened to you?
505.703	And I almost started crying
507.839	because all the people in the room
507.839	were dressed so beautifully,
511.788	and all that came out of my mouth was:
514.965	"""I don't know. I have to think about it."""
518.805	"And she said, ""OK, then,"" and walked away."
524.884	All those open hands out to me,
524.884	that small, sad stone in my throat ...
531.427	You see, I'm trying to tell you something
531.427	about people like me.
535.389	Misfit people -- we don't always know
535.389	how to hope or say yes
539.466	or choose the big thing,
541.101	even when it's right in front of us.
543.271	It's a shame we carry.
544.914	It's the shame of wanting something good.
546.929	It's the shame of feeling something good.
548.945	It's the shame of not really believing
548.945	we deserve to be in the room
553.351	with the people we admire.
556.472	If I could, I'd go back
556.472	and I'd coach myself.
559.422	I'd be exactly like those
559.422	over-50-year-old women who helped me.
563.789	I'd teach myself how to want things,
565.714	how to stand up, how to ask for them.
568.078	"I'd say, ""You! Yeah, you!"
568.078	"You belong in the room, too."""
572.408	The radiance falls on all of us,
574.704	and we are nothing without each other.
579.041	Instead, I flew back to Oregon,
582.337	and as I watched the evergreens
582.337	and rain come back into view,
588.053	I just drank many tiny bottles
588.053	"of airplane ""feel sorry for yourself."""
593.491	I thought about how, if I was a writer,
593.491	I was some kind of misfit writer.
599.244	What I'm saying is,
600.427	I flew back to Oregon without a book deal,
602.455	without an agent,
603.63	and with only a headful
603.63	and heart-ful of memories
606.139	of having sat so near
609.311	the beautiful writers.
612.278	Memory was the only prize
612.278	I allowed myself.
617.175	And yet, at home in the dark,
621.272	back in my underwear,
623.788	I could still hear their voices.
626.264	"They said, ""Don't listen to anyone"
626.264	who tries to get you to shut up
630.329	"or change your story."""
632.861	"They said, ""Give voice to the story"
632.861	"only you know how to tell."""
636.564	"They said, ""Sometimes telling the story"
639.018	"is the thing that saves your life."""
643.703	Now I am, as you can see,
643.703	the woman over 50.
648.278	And I'm a writer.
650.516	And I'm a mother.
652.441	And I became a teacher.
654.97	Guess who my favorite students are.
658.604	Although it didn't happen the day
660.256	that dream letter came through my mailbox,
662.534	I did write a memoir,
664.231	"called ""The Chronology of Water."""
666.889	In it are the stories of how many times
666.889	I've had to reinvent a self
671.612	from the ruins of my choices,
674.575	the stories of how my seeming failures
674.575	were really just weird-ass portals
680.009	to something beautiful.
682.309	All I had to do
682.309	was give voice to the story.
687.552	There's a myth in most cultures
687.552	about following your dreams.
692.664	It's called the hero's journey.
695.679	But I prefer a different myth,
697.527	that's slightly to the side of that
699.33	or underneath it.
701.089	It's called the misfit's myth.
703.763	And it goes like this:
705.623	even at the moment of your failure,
707.902	right then, you are beautiful.
711.585	You don't know it yet,
712.761	but you have the ability
712.761	to reinvent yourself
715.962	endlessly.
717.184	That's your beauty.
719.694	You can be a drunk,
721.234	you can be a survivor of abuse,
723.607	you can be an ex-con,
725.067	you can be a homeless person,
726.589	you can lose all your money
726.589	or your job or your husband
729.891	or your wife, or the worst thing of all,
732.329	a child.
733.864	You can even lose your marbles.
735.941	You can be standing dead center
735.941	in the middle of your failure
740.034	and still, I'm only here to tell you,
742.936	you are so beautiful.
745.073	Your story deserves to be heard,
747.396	because you, you rare
747.396	and phenomenal misfit,
751.693	you new species,
754.568	are the only one in the room
756.561	who can tell the story
758.201	the way only you would.
761.71	And I'd be listening.
764.863	Thank you.
766.063	(Applause)
