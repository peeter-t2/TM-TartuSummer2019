13.344	(Aquatic noises)
20.811	So this video was taken
22.714	at Aquarius undersea laboratory
25.146	four miles off the coast of Key Largo,
26.999	about 60 feet below the surface.
29.577	NASA uses this extreme environment
31.301	to train astronauts and aquanauts,
33.725	and last year, they invited us along for the ride.
37.087	All the footage was taken from our open ROV,
39.971	which is a robot that we built in our garage.
44.458	So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,
48.026	which in our case means our little robot
49.553	sends live video
51.817	across that ultra-thin tether
53.735	back to the computer topside.
56.163	It's open source, meaning we publish
58.141	and share all of our design files
60.186	and all of our code online,
61.694	allowing anyone to modify
63.728	or improve or change the design.
66.077	It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts
68.38	and costs about 1,000 times cheaper
70.215	than the ROVs James Cameron used
72.094	to explore the Titanic.
75.699	So ROVs aren't new.
77.909	They've been around for decades.
79.617	Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.
82.653	Oil and gas companies use them for exploration
85.472	and construction.
87.019	What we've built isn't unique.
89.781	It's how we've built it that's really unique.
92.655	So I want to give you a quick story
92.655	of how it got started.
95.636	So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I
97.907	decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave
100.107	in the foothills of the Sierras.
101.965	We had heard this story about lost gold
103.868	from a Gold Rush-era robbery,
103.868	and we wanted to go up there.
106.386	Unfortunately, we didn't have any money
108.044	and we didn't have any tools to do it.
109.867	So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,
113.067	but we didn't have all the parts figured out,
115.84	so we did what anybody would do in our situation:
118.052	we asked the Internet for help.
120.09	More specifically, we created this website,
122.622	openROV.com, and shared 
122.622	our intentions and our plans
125.517	For the first few months, it was just Eric and I
127.907	talking back to each other on the forums,
130.437	but pretty soon, we started to get feedback
132.525	from makers and hobbyists,
134.368	and then actually professional ocean engineers
136.362	who had some suggestions for what we should do.
139.894	We kept working on it. We learned a lot.
141.658	We kept prototyping, and eventually,
143.683	we decided we wanted to go 
143.683	to the cave. We were ready.
146.402	So about that time, our little expedition
146.402	became quite a story,
149.842	and it got picked up in The New York Times.
151.863	And we were pretty much just overwhelmed
153.675	with interest from people who wanted a kit
155.458	that they could build this open ROV themselves.
157.979	So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,
161.268	and when we did,
162.5	we raised our funding goal in about two hours,
164.575	and all of a sudden, 
164.575	had this money to make these kits.
167.78	But then we had to learn how to make them.
169.975	I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.
172.14	So we quickly learned that our garage
175.4	was not big enough to hold our growing operation.
178.079	But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,
180.235	thanks a lot to TechShop,
180.235	which was a big help to us,
182.942	and we shipped these kits all over the world
185.927	just before Christmas of last year,
187.756	so it was just a few months ago.
189.538	But we're already starting to get video
191.446	and photos back from all over the world,
193.044	including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.
196.074	We've also learned the penguins love robots.
199.474	(Laughter)
201.487	So we're still publishing all the designs online,
204.655	encouraging anyone to build these themselves.
206.773	That's the only way that we could have done this.
209.176	By being open source, we've created
210.835	this distributed R&amp;D network,
213.099	and we're moving faster than
213.099	any venture-backed counterpart.
216.895	But the actual robot is really only half the story.
220.1	The real potential, the long term potential,
222.596	is with this community of DIY ocean explorers
225.273	that are forming all over the globe.
227.669	What can we discover
229.203	when there's thousands of these devices
231.107	roaming the seas?
233.153	So you're probably all wondering: the cave.
235.429	Did you find the gold?
237.255	Well, we didn't find any gold,
238.807	but we decided that what we found
238.807	was much more valuable.
242.036	It was the glimpse into a potential future
244.508	for ocean exploration.
246.183	It's something that's not limited to
246.183	the James Camerons of the world,
249.093	but something that we're all participating in.
251.688	It's an underwater world
253.021	we're all exploring together.
255.532	Thank you.
257.707	(Applause)
