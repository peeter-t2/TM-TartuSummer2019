12.8	There are times when I feel
12.8	really quite ashamed
16.28	to be a European.
18.2	In the last year,
20.08	more than a million people
20.08	arrived in Europe in need of our help,
24.68	and our response,
24.68	frankly, has been pathetic.
29	There are just so many contradictions.
32.36	We mourn the tragic death
34.84	of two-year-old Alan Kurdi,
38	and yet, since then,
38	more than 200 children
41.88	have subsequently drowned
41.88	in the Mediterranean.
45.96	We have international treaties
47.44	that recognize that refugees
47.44	are a shared responsibility,
50.68	and yet we accept that tiny Lebanon
53.76	hosts more Syrians
53.76	than the whole of Europe combined.
58.32	We lament the existence
58.32	of human smugglers,
62.36	and yet we make that the only viable route
65.8	to seek asylum in Europe.
68.84	We have labor shortages,
70.72	and yet we exclude people who fit
70.72	our economic and demographic needs
76.2	from coming to Europe.
79	We proclaim our liberal values
79	in opposition to fundamentalist Islam,
84.96	and yet --
87.56	we have repressive policies
90.24	that detain child asylum seekers,
93.16	that separate children
93.16	from their families,
96.8	and that seize property from refugees.
100.96	What are we doing?
102.64	How has the situation come to this,
105.08	that we've adopted such an inhumane
105.08	response to a humanitarian crisis?
111.28	I don't believe
111.28	it's because people don't care,
113.72	or at least I don't want to believe
113.72	it's because people don't care.
116.92	I believe it's because
116.92	our politicians lack a vision,
120.76	a vision for how to adapt
120.76	an international refugee system
124.4	created over 50 years ago
126.56	for a changing and globalized world.
129.8	And so what I want to do
129.8	is take a step back
132.36	and ask two really fundamental questions,
135.8	the two questions we all need to ask.
138.28	First, why is the current
138.28	system not working?
141.6	And second, what can we do to fix it?
146.76	So the modern refugee regime
148.84	was created in the aftermath
148.84	of the Second World War by these guys.
154	Its basic aim is to ensure
157.16	that when a state fails,
157.16	or worse, turns against its own people,
161.4	people have somewhere to go,
163	to live in safety and dignity
163	until they can go home.
166.68	It was created precisely for situations
166.68	like the situation we see in Syria today.
172.68	Through an international convention
172.68	signed by 147 governments,
177.56	the 1951 Convention
177.56	on the Status of Refugees,
180.6	and an international organization, UNHCR,
183.8	states committed to reciprocally
183.8	admit people onto their territory
188.6	who flee conflict and persecution.
191.68	But today, that system is failing.
194.92	In theory, refugees
194.92	have a right to seek asylum.
198.88	In practice, our immigration policies
198.88	block the path to safety.
203.28	In theory, refugees have a right
203.28	to a pathway to integration,
207.64	or return to the country
207.64	they've come from.
210.36	But in practice, they get stuck
210.36	in almost indefinite limbo.
214.24	In theory, refugees
214.24	are a shared global responsibility.
218.04	In practice, geography means
218.04	that countries proximate the conflict
222.4	take the overwhelming majority
222.4	of the world's refugees.
226.72	The system isn't broken
226.72	because the rules are wrong.
229.48	It's that we're not applying them
229.48	adequately to a changing world,
233.84	and that's what we need to reconsider.
236.44	So I want to explain to you a little bit
236.44	about how the current system works.
240.96	How does the refugee regime actually work?
243.56	But not from a top-down
243.56	institutional perspective,
246.36	rather from the perspective of a refugee.
250.24	So imagine a Syrian woman.
252.72	Let's call her Amira.
254.88	And Amira to me represents
254.88	many of the people I've met in the region.
259.56	Amira, like around 25 percent
259.56	of the world's refugees,
262.92	is a woman with children,
264.84	and she can't go home
264.84	because she comes from this city
268.12	that you see before you, Homs,
270.16	a once beautiful and historic city
272.92	now under rubble.
274.44	And so Amira can't go back there.
277.12	But Amira also has no hope
277.12	of resettlement to a third country,
281.36	because that's a lottery ticket
282.88	only available to less than one percent
282.88	of the world's refugees.
286.88	So Amira and her family
289.16	face an almost impossible choice.
291.36	They have three basic options.
294.56	The first option is that Amira
294.56	can take her family to a camp.
300.52	In the camp, she might get assistance,
303.16	but there are very few prospects
303.16	for Amira and her family.
306.88	Camps are in bleak, arid locations,
310.16	often in the desert.
312.04	In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,
314.76	you can hear the shells
314.76	across the border in Syria at nighttime.
320.6	There's restricted economic activity.
323.2	Education is often of poor quality.
325.96	And around the world,
327.32	some 80 percent of refugees
327.32	who are in camps
330.44	have to stay for at least five years.
333	It's a miserable existence,
334.92	and that's probably why, in reality,
337.32	only nine percent of Syrians
337.32	choose that option.
341	Alternatively, Amira can head
341	to an urban area
345	in a neighboring country,
345	like Amman or Beirut.
349	That's an option that about 75 percent
349	of Syrian refugees have taken.
354.2	But there, there's
354.2	great difficulty as well.
357.72	Refugees in such urban areas
357.72	don't usually have the right to work.
362.04	They don't usually get
362.04	significant access to assistance.
365.44	And so when Amira and her family
365.44	have used up their basic savings,
369.16	they're left with very little
369.16	and likely to face urban destitution.
374.28	So there's a third alternative,
376.92	and it's one that increasing
376.92	numbers of Syrians are taking.
381.84	Amira can seek some hope for her family
386.04	by risking their lives
386.04	on a dangerous and perilous journey
389.8	to another country,
391.32	and it's that which we're seeing
391.32	in Europe today.
395.44	Around the world, we present refugees
395.44	with an almost impossible choice
400.72	between three options:
402.56	encampment, urban destitution
402.56	and dangerous journeys.
407.52	For refugees, that choice is
407.52	the global refugee regime today.
412.6	But I think it's a false choice.
414.76	I think we can reconsider that choice.
417.44	The reason why we limit those options
422.04	is because we think
425.08	that those are the only options
425.08	that are available to refugees,
429.48	and they're not.
431.12	Politicians frame the issue
431.12	as a zero-sum issue,
434.64	that if we benefit refugees,
434.64	we're imposing costs on citizens.
438.6	We tend to have a collective assumption
440.68	that refugees are an inevitable cost
440.68	or burden to society.
444.36	But they don't have to.
444.36	They can contribute.
446.88	So what I want to argue
448.32	is there are ways in which we can
448.32	expand that choice set
451.32	and still benefit everyone else:
453.36	the host states and communities,
455.24	our societies and refugees themselves.
459.08	And I want to suggest four ways
461.08	we can transform the paradigm
461.08	of how we think about refugees.
465.52	All four ways have one thing in common:
468.44	they're all ways in which we take
468.44	the opportunities of globalization,
472.24	mobility and markets,
474.32	and update the way we think
474.32	about the refugee issue.
478.28	The first one I want to think about
480	is the idea of enabling environments,
482.72	and it starts from
482.72	a very basic recognition
485.6	that refugees are human beings
485.6	like everyone else,
488.32	but they're just
488.32	in extraordinary circumstances.
491.28	Together with my colleagues in Oxford,
493.28	we've embarked on
493.28	a research project in Uganda
495.96	looking at the economic lives of refugees.
499.84	We chose Uganda not because
499.84	it's representative of all host countries.
503.92	It's not. It's exceptional.
505.96	Unlike most host countries
505.96	around the world,
508.36	what Uganda has done
509.84	is give refugees economic opportunity.
512.24	It gives them the right to work.
512.24	It gives them freedom of movement.
516.2	And the results of that are extraordinary
519.12	both for refugees and the host community.
522.48	In the capital city, Kampala,
524.48	we found that 21 percent of refugees
524.48	own a business that employs other people,
529.919	and 40 percent of those employees
532.4	are nationals of the host country.
534.4	In other words, refugees are making jobs
536.6	for citizens of the host country.
539.92	Even in the camps,
539.92	we found extraordinary examples
543.28	of vibrant, flourishing
543.28	and entrepreneurial businesses.
547.8	For example, in a settlement
547.8	called Nakivale,
551.16	we found examples of Congolese refugees
554.16	running digital music exchange businesses.
556.72	We found a Rwandan
556.72	who runs a business that's available
560.52	to allow the youth to play computer games
563.28	on recycled games consoles
563.28	and recycled televisions.
568.44	Against the odds of extreme constraint,
571.28	refugees are innovating,
573.32	and the gentleman you see before you
573.32	is a Congolese guy called Demou-Kay.
577.2	Demou-Kay arrived
577.2	in the settlement with very little,
580.88	but he wanted to be a filmmaker.
583.2	So with friends and colleagues,
583.2	he started a community radio station,
587.16	he rented a video camera,
588.92	and he's now making films.
590.44	He made two documentary films
592.44	with and for our team,
594.44	and he's making a successful business
594.44	out of very little.
598.64	It's those kinds of examples
600.64	that should guide
600.64	our response to refugees.
603.4	Rather than seeing refugees
604.76	as inevitably dependent
604.76	upon humanitarian assistance,
608.04	we need to provide them
608.04	with opportunities for human flourishing.
612.2	Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food
616.438	are all important in the emergency phase,
619.24	but we need to also look beyond that.
622.2	We need to provide opportunities
622.2	to connectivity, electricity,
626.56	education, the right to work,
629.4	access to capital and banking.
631.56	All the ways in which we take for granted
633.72	that we are plugged in
633.72	to the global economy
635.88	can and should apply to refugees.
639.28	The second idea I want to discuss
639.28	is economic zones.
643.32	Unfortunately, not every
643.32	host country in the world
646.08	takes the approach Uganda has taken.
648.48	Most host countries don't open up
648.48	their economies to refugees
651.84	in the same way.
653.36	But there are still pragmatic
653.36	alternative options that we can use.
659.16	Last April, I traveled to Jordan
659.16	with my colleague,
661.72	the development economist Paul Collier,
664.4	and we brainstormed an idea
664.4	while we were there
667.28	with the international community
667.28	and the government,
669.76	an idea to bring jobs to Syrians
672.12	while supporting Jordan's
672.12	national development strategy.
675.76	The idea is for an economic zone,
679.08	one in which we could potentially
679.08	integrate the employment of refugees
682.64	alongside the employment
682.64	of Jordanian host nationals.
686.84	And just 15 minutes away
686.84	from the Zaatari refugee camp,
690.28	home to 83,000 refugees,
692.44	is an existing economic zone
694.48	called the King Hussein
694.48	Bin Talal Development Area.
697.92	The government has spent
697.92	over a hundred million dollars
700.72	connecting it to the electricity grid,
700.72	connecting it to the road network,
704.56	but it lacked two things:
706.2	access to labor and inward investment.
708.96	So what if refugees
708.96	were able to work there
711.88	rather than being stuck in camps,
713.72	able to support their families and develop
713.72	skills through vocational training
717.76	before they go back to Syria?
719.84	We recognized that
719.84	that could benefit Jordan,
722.16	whose development strategy
722.16	requires it to make the leap
724.96	as a middle income country
724.96	to manufacturing.
727.8	It could benefit refugees,
727.8	but it could also contribute
731.52	to the postconflict
731.52	reconstruction of Syria
733.92	by recognizing that we need
733.92	to incubate refugees
736.72	as the best source
736.72	of eventually rebuilding Syria.
740.76	We published the idea
740.76	in the journal Foreign Affairs.
743.84	King Abdullah has picked up on the idea.
746.08	It was announced at the London
746.08	Syria Conference two weeks ago,
749.08	and a pilot will begin in the summer.
752.12	(Applause)
757.12	The third idea that I want to put to you
759.84	is preference matching
759.84	between states and refugees
763.48	to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes
763.48	you see here in the selfie
766.64	featuring Angela Merkel
766.64	and a Syrian refugee.
770.44	What we rarely do is ask refugees
770.44	what they want, where they want to go,
774.96	but I'd argue we can do that
776.84	and still make everyone better off.
779.64	The economist Alvin Roth has developed
779.64	the idea of matching markets,
783.8	ways in which the preference ranking
783.8	of the parties shapes an eventual match.
789.72	My colleagues Will Jones
789.72	and Alex Teytelboym
792.8	have explored ways in which that idea
792.8	could be applied to refugees,
796.96	to ask refugees to rank
796.96	their preferred destinations,
800.52	but also allow states to rank
800.52	the types of refugees they want
804.32	on skills criteria or language criteria
807.16	and allow those to match.
808.88	Now, of course
808.88	you'd need to build in quotas
811	on things like diversity
811	and vulnerability,
814.28	but it's a way of increasing
814.28	the possibilities of matching.
817.84	The matching idea
817.84	has been successfully used
820.36	to match, for instance,
820.36	students with university places,
825.52	to match kidney donors with patients,
828.04	and it underlies the kind of algorithms
828.04	that exist on dating websites.
832.2	So why not apply that
832.2	to give refugees greater choice?
835.32	It could also be used
835.32	at the national level,
837.392	where one of the great challenges we face
839.4	is to persuade local communities
839.4	to accept refugees.
843.16	And at the moment,
843.16	in my country, for instance,
845.64	we often send engineers to rural areas
845.64	and farmers to the cities,
849.84	which makes no sense at all.
851.72	So matching markets offer a potential way
851.72	to bring those preferences together
856.32	and listen to the needs and demands
856.32	of the populations that host
860.28	and the refugees themselves.
862.84	The fourth idea I want to put to you
862.84	is of humanitarian visas.
867.24	Much of the tragedy and chaos
867.24	we've seen in Europe
869.96	was entirely avoidable.
872.4	It stems from a fundamental contradiction
872.4	in Europe's asylum policy,
876.52	which is the following:
877.92	that in order to seek asylum in Europe,
880.44	you have to arrive spontaneously
880.44	by embarking on those dangerous journeys
885.48	that I described.
887.52	But why should those journeys be necessary
887.52	in an era of the budget airline
892.28	and modern consular capabilities?
894.72	They're completely unnecessary journeys,
897.08	and last year, they led to the deaths
897.08	of over 3,000 people
900.88	on Europe's borders
900.88	and within European territory.
905.36	If refugees were simply allowed
907	to travel directly
907	and seek asylum in Europe,
909.8	we would avoid that,
911.12	and there's a way of doing that
912.68	through something
912.68	called a humanitarian visa,
915	that allows people
915	to collect a visa at an embassy
918.56	or a consulate in a neighboring country
920.72	and then simply pay their own way
922.64	through a ferry or a flight to Europe.
926	It costs around a thousand euros
928	to take a smuggler
928	from Turkey to the Greek islands.
931.44	It costs 200 euros to take a budget
931.44	airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
936.92	If we allowed refugees to do that,
936.92	it would have major advantages.
940.72	It would save lives,
942.76	it would undercut
942.76	the entire market for smugglers,
946.72	and it would remove the chaos
946.72	we see from Europe's front line
950.08	in areas like the Greek islands.
952.16	It's politics that prevents us doing that
952.16	rather than a rational solution.
956.88	And this is an idea that has been applied.
959.24	Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach
961.92	where over 2,000 Syrians
961.92	have been able to get humanitarian visas,
966.24	enter Brazil, and claim refugee status
966.24	on arrival in Brazil.
970.64	And in that scheme,
970.64	every Syrian who has gone through it
973.56	has received refugee status
973.56	and been recognized as a genuine refugee.
978.16	There is a historical precedent
978.16	for it as well.
980.92	Between 1922 and 1942,
984.28	these Nansen passports
984.28	were used as travel documents
988.08	to allow 450,000 Assyrians,
988.08	Turks and Chechens
993.64	to travel across Europe
995.16	and claim refugee status
995.16	elsewhere in Europe.
998.52	And the Nansen
998.52	International Refugee Office
1001.28	received the Nobel Peace Prize
1003.16	in recognition of this
1003.16	being a viable strategy.
1007	So all four of these ideas
1007	that I've presented you
1010.24	are ways in which we can expand
1010.24	Amira's choice set.
1013.92	They're ways in which we can have
1013.92	greater choice for refugees
1017.2	beyond those basic,
1017.2	impossible three options
1021.04	I explained to you
1022.28	and still leave others better off.
1024.96	In conclusion,
1024.96	we really need a new vision,
1028.36	a vision that enlarges
1028.36	the choices of refugees
1031.16	but recognizes that they
1031.16	don't have to be a burden.
1033.72	There's nothing inevitable
1033.72	about refugees being a cost.
1037.2	Yes, they are a humanitarian
1037.2	responsibility,
1040.48	but they're human beings
1040.48	with skills, talents, aspirations,
1044.119	with the ability to make
1044.119	contributions -- if we let them.
1048.52	In the new world,
1050.319	migration is not going to go away.
1052.599	What we've seen in Europe
1052.599	will be with us for many years.
1055.599	People will continue to travel,
1057.44	they'll continue to be displaced,
1059.319	and we need to find rational,
1059.319	realistic ways of managing this --
1062.84	not based on the old logics
1062.84	of humanitarian assistance,
1065.88	not based on logics of charity,
1068	but building on the opportunities
