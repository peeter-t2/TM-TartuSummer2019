12.92	The great philosopher Aristotle said
16.84	if something doesn't exist,
16.84	there's no word for it,
21.32	and if there's no word for something,
23.8	that something doesn't exist.
26.2	So when we talk about elections,
28.36	we in established democracies,
28.36	we know what we're talking about.
31.96	We've got the words.
31.96	We have the vocabulary.
34.08	We know what a polling station is.
36	We know what a ballot paper is.
38.84	But what about countries
38.84	where democracy doesn't exist,
43.76	countries where there are
43.76	no words to describe the concepts
48.08	that underpin a democratic society?
51.56	I work in the field
51.56	of electoral assistance,
53.88	so that's to say we assist
56.04	emerging democracies to organize
58.2	what is often their first elections.
61.48	When people ask me what I do,
62.92	quite often I get this answer.
65.36	"""Oh, so you're one of these people"
65.36	who goes around the world
69.2	imposing Western democracy
69.2	"on countries that can't handle it."""
74.48	Well, the United Nations
74.48	does not impose anything on anybody.
79.6	It really doesn't,
80.84	and also, what we do
83.24	is firmly anchored in the 1948
83.24	Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
89.56	Article 21, that says
91.68	that everybody should have the right
91.68	to choose who governs them.
96	So that's the basis of the work.
97.56	I specialize in public outreach.
100.48	What does that mean? Another jargon.
102.92	It actually means
102.92	designing information campaigns
106.72	so that candidates and voters
109.16	who have never had the opportunity
109.16	to participate or to vote
113.48	understand where, when, how to register;
117.24	where, when, how to vote;
119.48	why, why it is important to take part.
122.56	So I'll probably devise a specific
122.56	campaign to reach out to women
127.04	to make sure that they can take part,
129.08	that they can be part of the process.
131.4	Young people as well.
133.28	All sorts of people.
134.52	Handicapped people.
135.96	We try to reach everybody.
138.8	And it's not always easy,
138.8	because very often in this work,
142.28	I've noticed now over the years
142.28	that I've been doing it
145.44	that words are lacking,
147.88	and so what do you do?
150.12	Afghanistan.
152.2	It's a country with
152.2	high levels of illiteracy,
154.72	and the thing about that was,
154.72	it was in 2005,
158.6	and we organized two elections
158.6	on the same day.
162.6	The reason was because the logistics
162.6	are so incredibly difficult,
166.84	it seemed to be more efficient to do that.
169.12	It was,
170.36	but on the other hand,
170.36	explaining two elections instead of one
174.84	was even more complicated.
176.36	So we used a lot of images,
178.72	and when it came to the actual ballot,
182.36	we had problems, because
182.36	so many people wanted to take part,
185.48	we had 300 candidates for 52 seats
190.44	in the Wolesi Jirga,
190.44	which is the parliamentary elections.
194	And for the Provincial Council,
194	we had even more candidates.
197.24	We had 330 for 54 seats.
200.24	So talking about ballot design,
203.32	this is what the ballot looked like.
207.6	It's the size of a newspaper.
209.24	This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --
211.426	(Laughter)
212.6	Yeah, and --
215.08	this was the Provincial Council ballot.
219.4	Even more.
220.72	So you see, we did use
220.72	a lot of symbols and things like that.
225.68	And we had other problems
225.68	in Southern Sudan.
230.48	Southern Sudan was a very different story.
233.24	We had so many people
233.24	who had never, of course, voted,
236.36	but we had extremely, extremely
236.36	high levels of illiteracy,
241.12	very, very poor infrastructure.
242.92	For example -- I mean, it's a country
242.92	the size of Texas, more or less.
247.52	We had seven kilometers of paved roads,
251.28	seven kilometers in the whole country,
253.36	and that includes the tarmac
253.36	where we landed the planes
256.52	in Juba Airport.
258.08	So transporting electoral materials, etc.,
261.24	is exceedingly difficult.
263.52	People had no idea
263.52	about what a box looked like.
268.519	It was very complicated,
270.839	so using verbal communication
270.839	was obviously the way to go,
274.96	but there were 132 languages.
278.8	So that was extremely challenging.
282.48	Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.
286.36	It was the Arab Spring.
288.04	A huge amount of hope was generated
288.04	by that enormous movement
292.36	that was going on in the region.
293.96	There was Libya,
293.96	there was Egypt, there was Yemen.
297.12	It was an enormous, enormous
297.12	historical moment.
300.16	And I was sitting
300.16	with the election commission,
302.76	and we were talking
302.76	about various aspects of the election,
306.52	and I was hearing them using words
306.52	that I hadn't actually heard before,
309.88	and I'd worked with Iraqis,
309.88	I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,
314.12	and suddenly they were using these words,
316.56	"and I just thought, ""This is strange."""
318.44	And what really gave rise to it
318.44	"was this word ""observer."""
321.36	We were discussing election observers,
323.64	and the election commissioner
323.64	"was talking about ""mulahiz"" in Arabic."
328.48	"This means ""to notice"""
328.48	in a passive sort of sense,
332.6	"as in, ""I noticed"
332.6	"he was wearing a light blue shirt."""
336.24	Did I go and check whether
336.24	the shirt was light blue or not?
339.96	That is the role of an election observer.
341.96	It's very active, it's governed
341.96	by all kinds of treaties,
346.04	and it has got
346.04	that control function in it.
348.84	And then I got wind
348.84	of the fact that in Egypt,
351.04	"they were using this term ""mutabiâ€™,"""
351.04	"which means ""to follow."""
354.4	So we were now having
354.4	followers of an election.
356.72	So that's not quite right either,
359.32	because there is a term
359.32	that's already accepted and in use,
362.106	"which was the word ""muraqib"""
362.106	"which means ""a controller."""
365.4	It's got that notion of control.
367.56	So I thought, three words
367.56	for one concept. This is not good.
371.32	And with our colleagues,
371.32	we thought perhaps it's our role
374.44	to actually help make sure
374.44	that the words are understood
378.52	and actually create a work of reference
381.68	that could be used across the Arab region.
384.36	And that's what we did.
385.64	So together with these colleagues,
387.32	"we launched the ""Arabic Lexicon"
387.32	"of Electoral Terminology,"""
391.32	and we worked
391.32	in eight different countries.
394.6	It meant actually defining 481 terms
399.2	which formed the basis
399.2	of everything you need to know
402.08	if you're going to organize
402.08	a democratic election.
404.88	And we defined these terms,
406.24	and we worked with the Arab colleagues
408.24	and came to an agreement
408.24	about what would be the appropriate word
412.04	to use in Arabic.
413.64	Because the Arabic language is very rich,
413.64	and that's part of the problem.
417.92	But there are 22 countries
417.92	that speak Arabic,
420.92	and they use modern standard Arabic,
425.64	which is the Arabic
425.64	that is used across the whole region
428.52	in newspapers and broadcasts,
431.04	but of course, then from one country
431.04	to the next in day to day language and use
435.97	it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.
439.32	So that was another
439.32	added layer of complication.
441.92	So in one sense you had the problem
444.44	that language wasn't
444.44	fully ripe, if you like,
448.12	neologisms were coming up,
448.12	new expressions.
451.4	And so we defined all these terms,
453.08	and then we had
453.08	eight correspondents in the region.
456.4	We submitted the draft to them,
458.32	they responded back to us.
459.92	"""Yes, we understand the definition."
462.56	We agree with it,
464.28	"but this is what we say in our country."""
467.48	Because we were not going
467.48	to harmonize or force harmonization.
471.12	We were trying to facilitate
471.12	understanding among people.
474.64	So in yellow, you see
474.64	the different expressions in use
479.72	in the various countries.
482	So this, I'm happy to say,
482	it took three years to produce this
485.96	because we also finalized the draft
485.96	and took it actually into the field,
490.32	sat with the election commissions
490.32	in all these different countries,
493.487	debated and defined and refined the draft,
496.4	and finally published it
496.4	in November 2014 in Cairo.
501.44	And it's gone a long way.
501.44	We published 10,000 copies.
504.72	To date, there's about 3,000 downloads
504.72	off the internet in PDF form.
509.96	I heard just recently from a colleague
509.96	that they've taken it up in Somalia.
513.88	They're going to produce
513.88	a version of this in Somalia,
516.8	because there's nothing in Somalia at all.
518.84	So that's very good to know.
521.88	And this newly formed Arab Organization
521.88	for Electoral Management Bodies,
526.159	which is trying to professionalize
529.12	how elections are run in the region,
531.44	they're using it as well.
533.559	And the Arab League have now
533.559	built up a pan-Arab observation unit,
539.52	and they're using it.
540.8	So that's all really good.
543.44	However, this work of reference
543.44	is quite high-pitched.
547.28	It's complex, and a lot of the terms
547.28	are quite technical,
550.2	so the average person probably doesn't
550.2	need to know at least a third of it.
554.96	But the people of the Middle East
557.04	have been deprived of any form
557.04	of what we know as civic education.
561.56	It's part of our curriculum at school.
564.36	It doesn't really exist
564.36	in that part of the world,
567.48	and I feel it's really
567.48	the right of everybody
569.92	to know how these things work.
572.04	And it's a good thing to think about
572.04	producing a work of reference
576.68	for the average person,
578.36	and bearing in mind that now
580.52	we have a basis to work with,
582.72	but also we have technology,
584.88	so we can reach out using telephone apps,
589.28	video, animation.
591.44	There's all sorts of tools
591.44	that can be used now
593.76	to communicate these ideas to people
596.28	for the first time in their own language.
600.2	We hear a lot of misery
600.2	about the Middle East.
602.48	We hear the chaos of war.
602.48	We hear terrorism.
605.68	We hear about sectarianism
605.68	and all this horrible negative news
611.24	that comes to us all the time.
612.92	What we're not hearing is what are
612.92	the people, the everyday people, thinking?
617.8	What are they aspiring to?
619.96	Let's give them the means,
619.96	let's give them the words.
624.48	The silent majority is silent
626.72	because they don't have the words.
629.2	The silent majority needs to know.
632.44	It is time to provide people
632.44	with the knowledge tools
635.48	that they can inform themselves with.
638.92	The silent majority
638.92	does not need to be silent.
642.08	Let's help them have a voice.
644.4	Thank you very much.
645.68	(Applause)
