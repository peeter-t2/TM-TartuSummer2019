13.346	(Arabic) I seek refuge in Allah from cursed Satan.
13.346	In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful.
16.999	(English) I was born
16.999	in a middle class family.
20.642	My father was five years old
20.642	when he lost his father,
25.233	but by the time I was born,
28.336	he was already a businessman.
31.32	But it didn't make a difference to him
33.772	if his children were going to be
33.772	a boy or a girl:
36.704	they were going to go to school.
38.879	So I guess I was the lucky one.
42.482	My mother had 16 pregnancies.
45.926	From 16 pregnancies, five of us are alive.
51.418	You can imagine as a child
51.418	what I went through.
56.008	Day to day, I watched women
58.881	being carried to a graveyard,
62.151	or watched children going to a graveyard.
67.555	At that time, when I
67.555	finished my high school,
70.603	I really wanted to be a doctor.
73.371	I wanted to be a doctor
73.371	to help women and children.
78.053	So I completed my education,
80.522	but I wanted to go to university.
83.29	Unfortunately, in my country,
83.29	there wasn't a dormitory for girls,
88.585	so I was accepted in medical school,
88.585	but I could not go there.
93.606	So as a result, my father
93.606	sent me to America.
98.999	I came to America.
100.932	I completed my education.
103.355	While I was completing my education,
105.799	my country was invaded by Russia.
110.299	And do you know that at the time
110.299	I was completing my education,
114.406	I didn't know what was going on
114.406	with my family or with my country.
118.454	There were months, years,
118.454	I didn't know about it.
122.358	My family was in a refugee camp.
126.789	So as soon as I completed my education,
130.844	I brought my family to America.
133.4	I wanted them to be safe.
136.046	But where was my heart?
138.11	My heart was in Afghanistan.
140.522	Day after day,
140.522	when I listened to the news,
143.8	when I followed what was
143.8	going on with my country,
146.498	my heart was breaking up.
148.442	I really wanted to go back to my country,
151.014	but at the same time I knew
151.014	I could not go there,
153.807	because there was no place for me.
156.577	I had a good job.
158.371	I was a professor at a university.
160.68	I earned good money.
162.506	I had a good life.
164.196	My family was here.
166.007	I could live with them.
168.022	But I wasn't happy.
169.904	I wanted to go back home.
172	So I went to the refugee camp.
174.912	And when I went
174.912	to the refugee camp in Pakistan,
178.126	there were 7.5 million refugees.
181.745	7.5 million refugees.
184.898	About 90 percent of them
184.898	were women and children.
189.811	Most of the men have been killed
189.811	or they were in war.
193.85	And you know, in the refugee camp,
196.698	when I went day-to-day to do a survey,
199.674	I found things you never could imagine.
204.174	I saw a widow with five to eight children
206.873	sitting there and weeping
209.435	and not knowing what to do.
211.396	I saw a young woman
211.396	have no way to go anywhere,
215.07	no education, no entertainment,
215.07	no place to even live.
220.736	I saw young men that had lost
220.736	their father and their home,
225.538	and they are supporting the family
225.538	as a 10-to-12-year old boy --
230.455	being the head of the household,
232.169	trying to protect their sister
232.169	and their mother and their children.
236.113	So it was a very devastating situation.
239.176	My heart was beating for my people,
242.128	and I didn't know what to do.
244.533	At that moment, we talk about momentum.
247.636	At that moment, I felt,
247.636	what can I do for these people?
251.801	How could I help these people?
253.628	I am one individual.
253.628	What can I do for them?
257.205	But at that moment, I knew
259.872	that education changed my life.
262.745	It transformed me. It gave me status.
266.483	It gave me confidence.
266.483	It gave me a career.
270.138	It helped me to support my family,
272.376	to bring my family to another country,
274.855	to be safe.
276.853	And I knew that at that moment
279.614	that what I should give to my people
279.614	is education and health,
283.932	and that's what I went after.
285.942	But do you think it was easy?
288.695	No, because at that time, education
288.695	was banned for girls, completely.
296.346	And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan,
300.058	people were not trusting anyone.
303.058	It was very hard to come and say,
303.058	"""I want to do this."""
306.804	Who am I?
308.249	Somebody who comes from the United States.
310.399	Somebody who got educated here.
312.321	Did they trust me? Of course not.
315.622	So I really needed to build
315.622	the trust in this community.
319.96	How am I going to do that?
322.372	I went and surveyed and looked and looked.
325.626	I asked.
326.959	Finally, I found one man.
329.674	He was 80 years old.
331.412	He was a mullah.
333.435	I went to his tent in the camp,
336.451	and I asked him,
338.07	"""I want to make you a teacher."""
341.117	And he looked at me,
342.792	"and he said, ""Crazy woman,"
345.157	crazy woman, how do you think
345.157	"I can be a teacher?"""
349.911	And I told him,
349.911	"""I will make you a teacher."""
352.705	Finally, he accepted my offer,
355.554	and once I started a class
355.554	in his compound,
358.935	the word spread all over.
361.657	In a matter of one year,
363.823	we had 25 schools set up,
369.736	and it was amazing.
371.856	(Applause)
374.117	Thank you.
376.236	Thank you.
378.252	But of course, we're doing all our work,
378.252	we were giving teacher training.
383.818	We were training women's rights,
383.818	human rights, democracy, rule of law.
388.611	We were giving all kinds of training.
391.064	And one day, I tell you,
394.087	one day I was in the office
394.087	in Peshawar, Pakistan.
398.556	All of a sudden, I saw my staff
398.556	running to rooms and locking the doors
403.49	"and telling me, ""Run away, hide!"""
407.268	And you know, as a leader, what do you do?
410.419	You're scared. You know it's dangerous.
414.317	You know your life is on the line.
416.111	But as a leader,
416.111	you have to hold it together.
419.309	You have to hold it together
419.309	and show strength.
422.412	"So I said, ""What's going on?"""
424.642	And these people were pouring
424.642	into my office.
427.88	So I invited them to the office.
429.563	They came, and there were
429.563	nine of them -- nine Taliban.
434.753	They were the ugliest looking men
434.753	you can ever see.
437.499	(Laughter)
439.564	Very mean-looking people,
441.586	black clothes, black turban,
443.857	and they pour into my office.
446.046	And I invited them
446.046	to have a seat and have tea.
449.641	They said no. They are not
449.641	going to drink tea.
452.934	And of course, with the tone
452.934	of voice they were using,
456.41	it was very scary,
457.83	but I was really shaking up.
460.441	But also I was strong, holding myself up.
464.424	And, of course, by that time,
464.424	you know how I dress --
467.378	I dress from head to toe in a black hijab.
469.973	The only thing you could see, my eyes.
473.464	"They asked me, ""What are you doing?"
475.942	Don't you know that school
475.942	is banned for girls?
479.776	"What are you doing here?"""
481.926	And you know, I just looked at them,
484.547	"and I said, ""What school?"
484.547	"Where is the school?"""
487.507	(Laughter)
490.332	(Applause)
493.452	And they look at my face, and they said,
493.452	"""You are teaching girls here."""
497.237	"I said, ""This is a house of somebody."
500.428	We have some students coming,
502.356	and they are all learning
502.356	Koran, Holy Book.
505.792	And you know, Koran says that
505.792	if you learn the Holy Book, the woman,
510.086	they can be a good wife,
512.363	"and they can obey their husband."""
514.768	(Laughter)
518.936	And I tell you one thing:
520.777	that's the way you work with those people,
520.777	and you know --
523.524	(Laughter)
524.999	So by that time,
524.999	they started speaking Pashto.
529.046	They talked to each other,
530.999	"and they said, ""Let's go,"
530.999	"leave her alone, she's OK."""
534.904	And you know, this time,
534.904	I offered them tea again,
538.832	and they took a sip and they left.
542.141	By that time, my staff
542.141	poured into my office.
546.292	They were scared to death.
548.331	They didn't know why they didn't kill me.
550.426	They didn't know why
550.426	they didn't take me away.
552.887	But everybody was happy to see me.
556.164	Very happy, and I was happy
556.164	to be alive, of course.
559.181	(Laughter)
560.356	Of course, I was happy to be alive.
562.394	But also, as we continuously gave
562.394	training during the fall of the Taliban --
568.294	of course during the Taliban
568.294	there is another story.
570.755	We went underground and we provided
570.755	education for 80 schoolgirls,
574.938	3,000 students underground,
574.938	and continuously we trained.
578.802	With the fall of the Taliban,
578.802	we went into the country,
581.743	and we opened school after school.
584.227	We opened women's learning center.
586.656	We continuously opened clinics.
588.616	We worked with mothers and children.
590.624	We had reproductive health training.
592.371	We had all kinds of training
592.371	that you can imagine.
595.489	I was very happy. I was delighted
595.489	with the outcome of my work.
600.155	And one day, with four trainers
600.155	and one bodyguard,
603.771	I was going up north of Kabul,
606.692	and all of a sudden, again,
609.239	I was stopped in the middle of the road
611.541	by 19 young men.
613.836	Rifles on their shoulders,
613.836	they blocked the road.
617.646	"And I told my driver, ""What's going on?"""
620.575	"And the driver said, ""I don't know."""
622.322	He asked them. They said,
622.322	"""We have nothing to do with you."""
625.115	They called my name.
625.115	"They said, ""We want her."""
628.828	My bodyguard got out, said,
628.828	"""I can answer you."
631.755	"What do you want?"""
633.073	"They said, ""Nothing."" They called my name."
635.104	And by that time, the women
635.104	are yelling and screaming inside the car.
639.999	I am very shaken up,
639.999	and I told myself, this is it.
642.578	This time, we all are going to be killed.
645.119	There is no doubt in my mind.
647.721	But still, the moment comes,
647.721	and you take strength
652.657	from whatever you believe
652.657	and whatever you do.
655.555	It's in your heart.
656.944	You believe in your worth,
656.944	and you can walk on it.
659.843	So I just hold myself
659.843	on the side of the car.
663.406	My leg was shaking, and I got outside.
666.985	"And I asked them, ""What can I do for you?"""
669.509	You know what they said to me?
671.12	"They said, ""We know who you are."
674.286	We know where you are going.
676.232	Every day you go up north here and there.
678.937	You train women, you teach them
682.009	and also you give them an
682.009	opportunity to have a job.
685.08	"You build their skills. How about us?"""
687.904	(Laughter)
690.779	(Applause)
693.771	"""And you know, how about us?"
698.159	"What are we going to do?"""
699.769	I looked at them, and I said,
699.769	"""I don't know."""
702.165	(Laughter)
705.007	"They said, ""It's OK."
706.602	The only thing we can do, what we know,
708.786	from the time we're born,
708.786	we just hold the gun and kill.
711.889	"That's all we know."""
713.713	And you know what that means.
715.206	It's a trap to me, of course.
717.522	So I walk out of there.
717.522	"They said, ""We'll let you go, go."""
721.435	And so I walked into the car,
721.435	I sit in the car,
724.363	and I told the driver,
724.363	"""Turn around and go back to the office."""
727.999	At that time, we only
727.999	were supporting girls.
731.436	We only had money for women to train them,
734.921	to send them to school, and nothing else.
737.881	By the time I came to the office,
740.722	of course my trainers were gone.
742.999	They ran away home. Nobody stayed there.
746.414	My bodyguard was the only one there,
749.39	and my voice was completely gone.
752.12	I was shaken up, and I sat on my table,
755.279	"and I said, ""What am I going to do?"""
757.827	How am I going to solve this problem?
760.327	Because we had training
760.327	going on up north already.
764.08	Hundreds of women were there
764.08	coming to get training.
768.295	So I was sitting there,
768.295	all of a sudden, at this moment,
772.072	talking about momentum, we are,
774.501	at that moment,
776.406	one of my wonderful donors
776.406	called me about a report.
781.207	"And she asked me, ""Sakena?"""
781.207	And I answered her.
784.764	"She said, ""It's not you."
784.764	"What's wrong with you?"""
787.136	"I said, ""Nothing."" I tried to cover."
790.461	No matter what I tried to do,
790.461	she didn't believe me,
793.341	and she asked me again.
795.016	"""OK, tell me what's going on?"""
796.882	I told her the whole story.
798.944	"At that time, she said, ""OK,"
798.944	you go next time, and you will help them.
804.222	"You will help them."""
806.142	And when, two days later,
806.142	I went the same route,
810.364	and do you know, they were not in here,
812.881	they were a little back further,
815.078	the same young men, standing up there
815.078	and holding the rifle
819.651	and pointing to us to stop the car.
821.981	So we stopped the car.
823.729	"I got out. I said, ""OK, let's go with me."""
826.999	"And they said, ""Yes."""
828.301	"I said, ""On one condition,"
828.301	"that whatever I say, you accept it."""
833.046	And they said, yes, they do.
834.649	So I took them to the mosque,
836.863	and to make a long story short,
839.999	I told them I'd give them teachers.
842.763	Today, they are the best trainers.
846.739	They learn English,
848.422	they learn how to be teachers,
850.882	they learn computers,
852.644	and they are my guides.
854.518	Every area that is unknown to us
854.518	in the mountain areas,
858.379	they go with me.
858.379	They are ahead, and we go.
860.65	And they protect us.
863.275	And --
864.45	(Applause)
865.625	Thank you.
866.8	(Applause)
870.33	That tells you that education
870.33	transforms people.
875.513	When you educate people,
877.671	they are going to be different,
879.663	and today all over,
881.37	we need to work for gender equality.
883.766	We cannot only train women
883.766	but forget about the men,
887.496	because the men are the real people
887.496	who are giving women the hardest time.
892.974	(Laughter)
894.577	So we started training men
894.577	because the men should know
898.362	the potential of women,
899.853	know how much these potential men has,
902.378	and how much these women
902.378	can do the same job they are doing.
906.997	So we are continuously giving
906.997	training to men,
910.401	and I really believe strongly.
913.711	I live in a country
913.711	that was a beautiful country.
916.855	I just want to share this with you.
919.006	It was a beautiful country,
920.848	beautiful, peaceful country.
923.276	We were going everywhere.
925.252	Women were getting education:
927.349	lawyer, engineer, teacher,
930.205	and we were going from house to house.
932.396	We never locked our doors.
934.912	But you know what happened to my country.
936.898	Today, people cannot walk
936.898	out of their door without security issues.
943.297	But we want the same
943.297	Afghanistan we had before.
948.254	And I want to tell you the other side.
950.222	Today, the women of Afghanistan
950.222	are working very, very hard.
954.166	They are earning degrees.
954.166	They are training to be lawyers.
958.65	They are training to be
958.65	doctors, back again.
960.904	They are training to be teachers,
962.578	and they are running businesses.
964.927	So it is so wonderful
967.389	to see people like that
967.389	reach their complete potential,
972.109	and all of this is going to happen.
974.712	I want to share this with you,
976.578	because of love,
978.292	because of compassion,
980.109	and because of trust and honesty.
983.22	If you have these few things with you,
986.939	you will accomplish.
989.019	We have one poet, Mawlānā Rūmī.
992.59	He said that by having compassion
997.424	and having love,
997.424	you can conquer the world.
1000.671	And I tell you, we could.
1002.265	And if we could do it in Afghanistan,
1004.55	I am sure 100 percent that everyone
1004.55	can do it in any part of the world.
1008.916	Thank you very, very much.
1010.679	(Applause)
1013.548	Thank you. Thank you.
1018.999	(Applause)
