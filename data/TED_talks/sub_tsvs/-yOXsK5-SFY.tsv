519.686	(Applause)
537.463	(Applause ends)
538.488	Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.
540.572	I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
542.755	(Audience cheers)
546.356	(Applause)
550.506	Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.
555.1	(Laughter)
557.308	I mean, what does this have to do
557.308	with technology, entertainment and design?
563.784	Well, I count my iPod,
563.784	cellphone and computer as technology,
568.159	but this has nothing to do with that.
571.683	So I did a little research on it.
574.659	Well, this is what I found.
576.342	Of course, I hope I can memorize it.
578.401	(Clears throat)
580.229	The violin is made of a wood box
580.229	and four metal strings.
582.916	By pulling a string, it vibrates
582.916	and produces a sound wave,
585.775	which passes through
585.775	a piece of wood called a bridge,
588.347	and goes down to the wood box
588.347	and gets amplified, but ... let me think.
591.862	(Laughter)
595.586	Placing your finger
595.586	at different places on the fingerboard
598.499	changes the string length, and that
598.499	changes the frequency of the sound wave.
602.112	(Sighs) Oh, my gosh!
603.511	(Laughter)
605.89	OK, this is sort of technology,
609.521	but I can call it
609.521	a 16th-century technology.
614.302	But actually, the most
614.302	fascinating thing that I found
617.437	was that even the audio system
617.437	or wave transmission nowadays
621.696	are still based on the same principle
621.696	of producing and projecting sound.
627	Isn't that cool?
628.185	(Laughter)
632	(Applause)
638.883	Design -- I love its design.
641.858	I remember when I was little,
641.858	my mom asked me,
644.674	"""Would you like to play"
644.674	"the violin or the piano?"""
647	I looked at that giant monster
647	and said to myself --
651.256	"""I am not going to lock myself"
651.256	"on that bench the whole day!"""
656.433	(Laughter)
657.567	This is small and lightweight.
659.397	I can play from standing,
659.397	sitting or walking.
661.88	And, you know what?
663.316	The best of all is that
663.316	if I don't want to practice,
668	(Whispering) I can hide it.
669.84	(Laughter)
674.189	The violin is very beautiful.
675.841	Some people relate it
675.841	as the shape of a lady.
679.094	But whether you like it or not,
679.094	it's been so for more than 400 years,
683.844	unlike modern stuff
683.844	[that] easily looks dated.
687.597	But I think it's very personal
687.597	and unique that,
690.121	although each violin looks pretty similar,
692.683	no two violins sound the same --
695.129	even from the same maker
695.129	or based on the same model.
699.418	Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.
703.057	But actually, the instrument itself
703.057	isn't very entertaining.
708.563	I mean, when I first got my violin
708.563	and tried to play around on it,
712.336	it was actually really bad,
715.688	because it didn't sound the way
715.688	I'd heard from other kids --
719.699	it was so horrible and so scratchy.
722.189	So, it wasn't entertaining at all.
725.418	But besides, my brother
725.418	found this very funny:
731.263	Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!
733.654	(Laughter)
740	A few years later, I heard a joke
741.818	about the greatest violinist,
741.818	Jascha Heifetz.
744.167	After Mr. Heifetz's concert,
745.838	a lady came over and complimented him:
747.871	"""Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin"
747.871	"sounded so great tonight!"""
751.577	And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,
754	so he picked up his violin and said,
755.893	"""Funny -- I don't hear anything."""
757.612	(Laughter)
760.325	Now I realize that as the musician,
763.316	we human beings, with our great mind,
763.316	artistic heart and skill,
768.723	can change this 16th-century technology
768.723	and a legendary design
773.604	to a wonderful entertainment.
775.54	Now I know why I'm here.
778.445	(Music)
991.946	(Music ends)
995.926	(Applause)
1004.315	At first, I thought I was just
1004.315	going to be here to perform,
1007.444	but unexpectedly, I learned
1007.444	and enjoyed much more.
1013.09	But ... although some of the talks
1013.09	were quite up there for me.
1018.747	(Laughter)
1022.007	Like the multi-dimension stuff.
1026.322	I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough
1028.868	if I could actually get
1028.868	my two dimensions correct in school.
1032	(Laughter)
1035.306	But actually, the most
1035.306	impressive thing to me is that --
1039.81	well, actually, I would also like
1039.81	to say this for all children
1043.61	is to say thank you to all adults,
1043.61	for actually caring for us a lot,
1049.54	and to make our future world much better.
1052.77	Thank you.
