15.814	It's wonderful to be here
18.045	to talk about my journey,
20.131	to talk about the wheelchair
21.865	and the freedom it has bought me.
24.505	I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago
27.142	when an extended illness
29.276	changed the way I could access the world.
32.862	When I started using the wheelchair,
35.239	it was a tremendous new freedom.
37.824	I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.
40.91	It was like having an enormous new toy.
43.48	I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.
47.51	Just being out on the street was exhilarating.
51.018	But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,
55.42	people's reaction completely changed towards me.
58.972	It was as if they couldn't see me anymore,
61.452	as if an invisibility cloak had descended.
65.451	They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions
68.672	of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.
72.9	When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,
77.812	"they used words like ""limitation,"" ""fear,"""
81.366	"""pity"" and ""restriction."""
84.391	I realized I'd internalized these responses
89.16	and it had changed who I was on a core level.
92.697	A part of me had become alienated from myself.
96.887	I was seeing myself not from my perspective,
100.472	but vividly and continuously from the perspective
104.634	of other people's responses to me.
107.531	As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories
112.656	about this experience,
114.895	new narratives to reclaim my identity.
117.671	"[""Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' â€” Davis 2009, TEDx Women""]"
120.775	I started making work
122.853	that aimed to communicate something
125.669	of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair --
130.787	a power chair -- to negotiate the world.
135.401	I was working to transform these internalized responses,
141.986	to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped
145.781	my identity when I started using a wheelchair,
148.962	by creating unexpected images.
152.726	The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.
158.947	When I literally started leaving
160.988	traces of my joy and freedom,
164.554	it was exciting to see
166.502	the interested and surprised responses from people.
171.004	It seemed to open up new perspectives,
173.893	and therein lay the paradigm shift.
176.788	It showed that an arts practice
178.862	can remake one's identity
181.205	and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.
185.989	So when I began to dive, in 2005,
189.902	I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity
193.428	in just the same way as a wheelchair does,
196.087	but the associations attached to scuba gear
198.679	are ones of excitement and adventure,
201.279	completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.
205.103	"So I thought, ""I wonder what'll happen"
208.247	"if I put the two together?"" (Laughter) (Applause)"
212.559	And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted
216.751	has taken me on the most amazing journey
219.458	over the last seven years.
221.727	So to give you an idea of what that's like,
225.215	I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes
228.101	from creating this spectacle,
230.197	and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.
233.998	(Music)
443.695	(Applause)
450.496	It is the most amazing experience,
453.475	beyond most other things I've experienced in life.
457.116	I literally have the freedom to move
460.213	in 360 degrees of space
462.852	and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.
466.612	And the incredibly unexpected thing
469.229	is that other people seem to see and feel that too.
473.419	Their eyes literally light up,
475.797	"and they say things like, ""I want one of those,"""
479.051	"or, ""If you can do that, I can do anything."""
482.733	And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment
486.355	of them seeing an object
488.908	they have no frame of reference for,
490.819	or so transcends the frames of reference
493.619	they have with the wheelchair,
495.364	they have to think in a completely new way.
498.396	And I think that moment of completely new thought
502.74	perhaps creates a freedom
505.238	that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
509.264	For me, this means that they're seeing
512.456	the value of difference,
514.806	the joy it brings
516.726	when instead of focusing on loss or limitation,
520.546	we see and discover the power and joy
524.95	of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
529.357	For me, the wheelchair becomes
531.056	a vehicle for transformation.
533.401	"In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair ""Portal,"""
537.181	because it's literally pushed me through
539.385	into a new way of being,
541.263	into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
544.997	And the other thing is,
546.542	that because nobody's seen or heard
549.014	of an underwater wheelchair before,
551.509	and creating this spectacle is about creating
554.352	new ways of seeing, being and knowing,
557.189	now you have this concept in your mind.
560.137	You're all part of the artwork too.
563.936	(Applause)
