25	How many Creationists do we have in the room?
28	Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians.
31	And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy --
38	would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.
43	It's all right.
45	You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.
49	The World Wide Web? Not so sure.
53	Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.
55	What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity
61	from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,
64	and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?
70	And yet people are interestingly resistant
74	to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.
81	And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
85	keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
89	So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,
93	and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
96	It climbs up to the top, and it falls,
99	and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --
102	trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.
106	What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?
111	What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?
118	What's in it for the ant?
120	And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
126	Well then, why is it doing this?
129	Is it just a fluke?
131	Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.
138	It's a little brain worm.
140	It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow
145	in order to continue its life cycle.
148	Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,
153	and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,
157	crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.
162	So there's nothing in it for the ant.
166	The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,
174	inducing suicidal behavior.
178	Pretty scary.
180	Well, does anything like that happen with human beings?
185	This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.
190	Well, it may already have occurred to you
195	"that Islam means ""surrender,"" or ""submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."""
205	Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.
211	Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population
216	has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?
223	No, it's worse than that.
225	Most people have.
229	(Laughter)
233	There are a lot of ideas to die for.
235	Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.
238	(Laughter)
242	Justice. Truth. Communism.
246	Many people have laid down their lives for communism,
249	and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.
252	And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.
256	These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.
261	They're infectious.
264	"Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about ""infectious repititis."""
268	It was a term of abuse, in effect.
271	This is unthinking engineering.
273	Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on
277	is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.
281	"It's ""infectious repetitis,"""
283	and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens
288	so that we can understand the conditions of infection.
294	Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.
301	I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards
307	is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.
311	And you have to have a bumper sticker,
314	you know. You have to have a statement.
317	So, this is mine.
319	The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are
323	and dedicate your life to it.
325	"Most of us -- now that the ""Me Decade"" is well in the past --"
329	now we actually do this.
331	One set of ideas or another
334	have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.
338	This is what our summum bonum is.
341	It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.
344	Now, this is a profound biological effect.
348	It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.
351	And no other species does anything at all like it.
355	Well, how are we going to think about this?
357	It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.
361	Unmistakable.
363	Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?
366	Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together?
369	The idea of replicating ideas;
372	ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.
377	"Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term ""memes,"""
382	and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea
387	"in his book ""The Selfish Gene."""
389	Now here am I talking about his idea.
392	Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.
398	But it's everybody's idea now.
401	And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.
405	I'm responsible for what I say about memes.
410	Actually, I think we're all responsible
413	for not just the intended effects of our ideas,
419	but for their likely misuses.
423	So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,
427	that these ideas not be abused and misused.
431	They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.
434	And it's just about a full-time job
437	trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas
440	from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.
448	So we have to keep plugging away,
451	trying to correct the misapprehensions
453	so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.
461	But it is a problem.
465	We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,
470	because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.
473	So let me just point out: memes are like viruses.
478	That's what Richard said, back in '93.
480	"And you might think, ""Well, how can that be?"
482	"I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"""
489	Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications
494	but -- what's a virus?
495	A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.
499	(Laughter)
500	That is, there is something about it
502	that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.
506	And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.
510	What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?
516	Not silicon.
518	They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.
522	What's a word made of?
524	"Sometimes when people say, ""Do memes exist?"""
529	"I say, ""Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"""
533	If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.
538	Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.
541	There are different species of memes.
549	Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?
553	Simple, beautiful furniture?
556	And, of course, they're basically extinct now.
559	And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom
565	is that one should be celibate.
567	Not just the priests. Everybody.
569	Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)
577	But in fact that's not why they went extinct.
582	They survived as long as they did
585	at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.
587	And there were lots of widows and orphans,
590	people like that, who needed a foster home.
593	And so they had a ready supply of converts.
596	And they could keep it going.
598	And, in principle, it could've gone on forever,
600	with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.
603	The idea being passed on through proselytizing,
608	instead of through the gene line.
613	So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact
617	that they're not being passed on genetically.
620	A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.
624	After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.
633	There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.
640	It's part of their plan.
642	They don't have to have minds to have a plan.
647	I'm just going to draw your attention to just one
652	of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.
661	I've not time to go into more of it.
663	"In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, ""Guns, Germs and Steel,"""
667	he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,
673	that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --
678	that conquered the rest of the world.
680	When European explorers and travelers spread out,
687	they brought with them the germs
689	that they had become essentially immune to,
692	that they had learned how to tolerate over
695	hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,
698	of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.
703	And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,
708	who had no immunity to them at all.
711	And we're doing it again.
715	We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.
720	Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --
724	spoke about all the wonderful things
726	that are happening when our ideas get spread out,
729	thanks to all the new technology all over the world.
731	And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.
737	But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world
745	thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.
750	Now, this has been realized for some time.
753	Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,
759	one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.
764	"""One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,"
769	"ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations."" Memes."
775	These memes are spreading around the world
779	and they are wiping out whole cultures.
784	They are wiping out languages.
786	They are wiping out traditions and practices.
791	And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste
799	to people that haven't developed the immunity.
802	We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.
808	We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.
814	They're like a mild cold.
816	They're not a big deal for us.
818	But we should recognize that for many people in the world,
822	they are a big deal.
826	And we should be very alert to this.
829	As we spread our education and our technology,
832	one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes
840	that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes
846	as a dire threat to their favorite memes --
849	the memes that they are prepared to die for.
852	Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?
856	That is not the job of the science of memetics.
861	Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.
867	This is not the place for hate and anger.
871	If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.
876	But the way to deal with that is to do science,
880	and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.
887	Get the facts.
889	Work out the implications.
893	There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts
897	and can figure out the best thing to do.
899	And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
904	You will never annihilate the germs.
907	What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like
913	that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.
919	That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations
926	of the most toxic varieties.
929	That's all the time I have,
932	so thank you very much for your attention.
