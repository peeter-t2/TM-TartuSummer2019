12.86	I'm here to offer you
12.86	a new way to think about my field,
16.635	artificial intelligence.
18.427	I think the purpose of AI
20.465	is to empower humans
20.465	with machine intelligence.
25.106	And as machines get smarter,
27.58	we get smarter.
29.727	"I call this ""humanistic AI"" --"
32.263	artificial intelligence
32.263	designed to meet human needs
35.958	by collaborating and augmenting people.
39.969	Now, today I'm happy to see
41.903	that the idea of an intelligent assistant
44.104	is mainstream.
45.597	It's the well-accepted metaphor
45.597	for the interface between humans and AI.
51.376	And the one I helped create
51.376	is called Siri.
54.777	You know Siri.
55.953	Siri is the thing that knows your intent
58.622	and helps you do it for you,
60.688	helps you get things done.
62.213	But what you might not know
62.213	is that we designed Siri
65.465	as humanistic AI,
67.455	to augment people
67.455	with a conversational interface
70.65	that made it possible for them
70.65	to use mobile computing,
74.127	regardless of who they were
74.127	and their abilities.
78.634	Now for most of us,
80.235	the impact of this technology
83.04	is to make things
83.04	a little bit easier to use.
85.736	But for my friend Daniel,
89.172	the impact of the AI
89.172	in these systems is a life changer.
93.037	You see, Daniel is a really social guy,
97.894	and he's blind and quadriplegic,
100.434	which makes it hard to use those devices
100.434	that we all take for granted.
104.317	The last time I was at his house,
104.317	his brother said,
106.783	"""Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready."
108.665	He's on the phone with a woman
108.665	"he met online."""
112.07	"I'm like, ""That's cool, how'd he do it?"""
114.104	Well, Daniel uses Siri
114.104	to manage his own social life --
118.551	his email, text and phone --
120.515	without depending on his caregivers.
124.321	This is kind of interesting, right?
126.083	The irony here is great.
127.424	Here's the man whose relationship with AI
130.344	helps him have relationships
130.344	with genuine human beings.
134.625	And this is humanistic AI.
139.224	Another example with
139.224	life-changing consequences
141.646	is diagnosing cancer.
144.615	When a doctor suspects cancer,
146.794	they take a sample
146.794	and send it to a pathologist,
149.521	who looks at it under a microscope.
151.965	Now, pathologists look at
151.965	hundreds of slides
154.514	and millions of cells every day.
157.45	So to support this task,
158.861	some researchers made an AI classifier.
163.368	Now, the classifier says,
163.368	"""Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"""
167.945	looking at the pictures.
170.175	The classifier was pretty good,
172.787	but not as good as the person,
175.765	who got it right most of the time.
178.247	But when they combine the ability
178.247	of the machine and the human together,
184.451	accuracy went to 99.5 percent.
188.97	Adding that AI to a partnership
188.97	eliminated 85 percent of the errors
193.995	that the human pathologist
193.995	would have made working alone.
198.64	That's a lot of cancer
198.64	that would have otherwise gone untreated.
202.917	Now, for the curious, it turns out
204.871	that the human was better
204.871	at rejecting false positives,
208.369	and the machine was better
208.369	at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.
211.965	But the lesson here isn't about
211.965	which agent is better
215.226	at this image-classification task.
217.708	Those things are changing every day.
219.571	The lesson here
221.163	is that by combining the abilities
221.163	of the human and machine,
224.547	it created a partnership
224.547	that had superhuman performance.
230.363	And that is humanistic AI.
234.607	Now let's look at another example
236.617	with turbocharging performance.
238.928	This is design.
240.355	Now, let's say you're an engineer.
242.42	You want to design
242.42	a new frame for a drone.
244.561	You get out your favorite
244.561	software tools, CAD tools,
247.649	and you enter the form and the materials,
247.649	and then you analyze performance.
251.888	That gives you one design.
253.982	If you give those same tools to an AI,
257.683	it can generate thousands of designs.
262.013	This video by Autodesk is amazing.
263.971	This is real stuff.
265.912	So this transforms how we do design.
269.007	The human engineer now
270.459	says what the design should achieve,
273.798	and the machine says,
274.978	"""Here's the possibilities."""
277.578	Now in her job, the engineer's job
280.542	is to pick the one that best meets
280.542	the goals of the design,
283.666	which she knows as a human
283.666	better than anyone else,
287.029	using human judgment and expertise.
289.234	In this case, the winning form
290.838	looks kind of like something
290.838	nature would have designed,
293.573	minus a few million years of evolution
295.712	and all that unnecessary fur.
300.244	Now let's see where this idea
300.244	of humanistic AI might lead us
304.94	if we follow it into
304.94	the speculative beyond.
307.938	What's a kind of augmentation
307.938	that we would all like to have?
311.349	Well, how about cognitive enhancement?
315.724	Instead of asking,
317.227	"""How smart can we make our machines?"""
319.312	let's ask
320.509	"""How smart can our machines make us?"""
324.925	I mean, take memory for example.
327.331	Memory is the foundation
327.331	of human intelligence.
331.587	But human memory is famously flawed.
335.361	We're great at telling stories,
337.459	but not getting the details right.
339.434	And our memories -- they decay over time.
342.664	I mean, like, where did the '60s go,
342.664	and can I go there, too?
345.92	(Laughter)
348.468	But what if you could have a memory
348.468	that was as good as computer memory,
353.978	and was about your life?
357.534	What if you could remember
357.534	every person you ever met,
360.347	how to pronounce their name,
362.317	their family details,
362.317	their favorite sports,
364.433	the last conversation you had with them?
366.42	If you had this memory all your life,
369.099	you could have the AI look
369.099	at all the interactions
372.421	you had with people over time
373.862	and help you reflect on the long arc
373.862	of your relationships.
378.35	What if you could have the AI read
378.35	everything you've ever read
383.44	and listen to every song
383.44	you've ever heard?
387.164	From the tiniest clue,
387.164	it could help you retrieve
390.927	anything you've ever seen or heard before.
393.751	Imagine what that would do
393.751	for the ability to make new connections
397.025	and form new ideas.
398.629	And what about our bodies?
401.552	What if we could remember the consequences
401.552	of every food we eat,
405.854	every pill we take,
408.305	every all-nighter we pull?
410.868	We could do our own science
410.868	on our own data
413.602	about what makes us feel
413.602	good and stay healthy.
417.486	And imagine how this could revolutionize
419.986	the way we manage
419.986	allergies and chronic disease.
424.729	I believe that AI will make
424.729	personal memory enhancement a reality.
430.942	I can't say when or what
430.942	form factors are involved,
434.447	but I think it's inevitable,
437.743	because the very things
437.743	that make AI successful today --
442.594	the availability of comprehensive data
445.111	and the ability for machines
445.111	to make sense of that data --
448.683	can be applied to the data of our lives.
452.325	And those data are here today,
452.325	available for all of us,
455.836	because we lead digitally mediated lives,
460.39	in mobile and online.
463.653	In my view, a personal memory
463.653	is a private memory.
467.567	We get to choose what is and is not
467.567	recalled and retained.
472.337	It's absolutely essential
472.337	that this be kept very secure.
477.114	Now for most of us,
478.6	the impact of augmented personal memory
481.517	will be a more improved mental gain,
484.276	maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.
488.478	But for the millions who suffer
488.478	from Alzheimer's and dementia,
495.029	the difference that augmented
495.029	memory could make
497.256	is a difference
497.256	between a life of isolation
500.836	and a life of dignity and connection.
503.986	We are in the middle of a renaissance
503.986	in artificial intelligence right now.
510.472	I mean, in just the past few years,
512.467	we're beginning to see
512.467	solutions to AI problems
516.122	that we have struggled
516.122	with literally for decades:
521.046	speech understanding, text understanding,
523.737	image understanding.
525.997	We have a choice in how we use
525.997	this powerful technology.
531.088	We can choose to use AI
531.088	to automate and compete with us,
535.976	or we can use AI to augment
535.976	and collaborate with us,
539.977	to overcome our cognitive limitations
543.072	and to help us do what we want to do,
546.258	only better.
548.159	And as we discover new ways
548.159	to give machines intelligence,
554.687	we can distribute that intelligence
557.78	to all of the AI assistants in the world,
560.185	and therefore to every person,
560.185	regardless of circumstance.
565.009	And that is why,
566.562	every time a machine gets smarter,
570.448	we get smarter.
572.848	That is an AI worth spreading.
576.605	Thank you.
577.811	(Applause)
