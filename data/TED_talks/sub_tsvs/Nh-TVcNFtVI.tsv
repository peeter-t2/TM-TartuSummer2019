13.436	One hot October morning,
16.667	I got off the all-night train
19.401	in Mandalay,
20.583	the old royal capital of Burma,
23.725	now Myanmar.
25.66	And out on the street, I ran into
25.66	a group of rough men
29.882	standing beside their bicycle rickshaws.
33.799	And one of them came up
35.193	and offered to show me around.
38.615	The price he quoted was outrageous.
41.832	It was less than I would pay
41.832	for a bar of chocolate at home.
45.844	So I clambered into his trishaw,
49.009	and he began pedaling us slowly
49.009	between palaces and pagodas.
55.972	And as he did, he told me how
55.972	he had come to the city from his village.
61.295	He'd earned a degree in mathematics.
63.698	His dream was to be a teacher.
66.445	But of course, life is hard
66.445	under a military dictatorship,
71.281	and so for now, this was the only way
71.281	he could make a living.
76.796	Many nights, he told me,
76.796	he actually slept in his trishaw
80.761	so he could catch the first visitors
80.761	off the all-night train.
87.543	And very soon, we found
87.543	that in certain ways,
91.416	we had so much in common --
93.106	we were both in our 20s,
94.991	we were both fascinated
94.991	by foreign cultures --
98.734	that he invited me home.
102.056	So we turned off the wide,
102.056	crowded streets,
105.887	and we began bumping
105.887	down rough, wild alleyways.
110.121	There were broken shacks all around.
112.493	I really lost the sense of where I was,
116.136	and I realized that anything
116.136	could happen to me now.
119.842	I could get mugged or drugged
122.308	or something worse.
123.648	Nobody would know.
126.309	Finally, he stopped and led me into a hut,
130.03	which consisted of just one tiny room.
134.228	And then he leaned down,
136.429	and reached under his bed.
139.608	And something in me froze.
144.046	I waited to see what he would pull out.
147.361	And finally he extracted a box.
151.295	Inside it was every single letter
151.295	he had ever received
156.25	from visitors from abroad,
159.001	and on some of them he had pasted
161.127	little black-and-white worn snapshots
164.542	of his new foreign friends.
168.387	So when we said goodbye that night,
172.038	I realized he had also shown me
174.649	the secret point of travel,
176.983	which is to take a plunge,
179.063	to go inwardly as well as outwardly
181.779	to places you would never go otherwise,
184.99	to venture into uncertainty,
187.928	ambiguity,
189.498	even fear.
192.298	At home, it's dangerously easy
194.761	to assume we're on top of things.
197.81	Out in the world, you are reminded
197.81	every moment that you're not,
202.309	and you can't get to the bottom
202.309	of things, either.
206.235	"Everywhere, ""People wish to be settled,"""
209.161	Ralph Waldo Emerson reminded us,
211.464	"""but only insofar"
211.464	as we are unsettled
214.164	"is there any hope for us."""
216.891	At this conference,
216.891	we've been lucky enough
219.342	to hear some exhilarating
219.342	new ideas and discoveries
222.819	and, really, about all the ways
224.599	in which knowledge is being
224.599	pushed excitingly forwards.
228.797	But at some point, knowledge gives out.
232.802	And that is the moment
234.05	when your life is truly decided:
237.825	you fall in love;
240.093	you lose a friend;
242.893	the lights go out.
245	And it's then, when you're lost
245	or uneasy or carried out of yourself,
250.038	that you find out who you are.
254.224	I don't believe that ignorance is bliss.
258.193	Science has unquestionably made our lives
261.348	brighter and longer and healthier.
264.825	And I am forever grateful to the teachers
264.825	who showed me the laws of physics
269.676	and pointed out that
269.676	three times three makes nine.
273.678	I can count that out on my fingers
276.527	any time of night or day.
280.802	But when a mathematician tells me
282.438	that minus three times
282.438	minus three makes nine,
285.985	that's a kind of logic
285.985	that almost feels like trust.
292.674	The opposite of knowledge, in other words,
292.674	isn't always ignorance.
296.948	It can be wonder.
298.482	Or mystery.
299.964	Possibility.
301.894	And in my life, I've found
301.894	it's the things I don't know
305.755	that have lifted me up
305.755	and pushed me forwards
308.458	much more than the things I do know.
312.222	It's also the things I don't know
314.045	that have often brought me closer
314.045	to everybody around me.
318.549	For eight straight Novembers, recently,
320.573	I traveled every year across Japan
320.573	with the Dalai Lama.
326.001	And the one thing he said every day
329.125	that most seemed to give people
329.125	reassurance and confidence
332.696	"was, ""I don't know."""
336.325	"""What's going to happen to Tibet?"""
339.226	"""When are we ever"
339.226	"going to get world peace?"""
342.765	"""What's the best way to raise children?"""
346.134	"""Frankly,"" says this very wise man,"
349.229	"""I don't know."""
352.117	The Nobel Prize-winning
352.117	economist Daniel Kahneman
355.842	has spent more than 60 years now
355.842	researching human behavior,
360.369	and his conclusion is
362.425	that we are always much more confident
362.425	of what we think we know
367.063	than we should be.
368.812	We have, as he memorably puts it,
371.495	"an ""unlimited ability"
371.495	"to ignore our ignorance."""
376.849	We know -- quote, unquote -- our team
376.849	is going to win this weekend,
381.96	and we only remember that knowledge
384.153	on the rare occasions when we're right.
387.582	Most of the time, we're in the dark.
391.319	And that's where real intimacy lies.
396.58	Do you know what your lover
396.58	is going to do tomorrow?
400.673	Do you want to know?
403.621	The parents of us all,
403.621	as some people call them,
406.458	Adam and Eve,
407.641	could never die, so long as they
407.641	were eating from the tree of life.
412.631	But the minute they began nibbling
414.853	from the tree of the knowledge
414.853	of good and evil,
417.459	they fell from their innocence.
419.808	They grew embarrassed and fretful,
422.857	self-conscious.
424.865	And they learned,
424.865	a little too late, perhaps,
427.257	that there are certainly some things
427.257	that we need to know,
430.021	but there are many, many more
430.021	that are better left unexplored.
435.999	Now, when I was a kid,
437.948	I knew it all, of course.
441.29	I had been spending 20 years
441.29	in classrooms collecting facts,
445.526	and I was actually
445.526	in the information business,
448.269	writing articles for Time Magazine.
451.129	And I took my first real trip to Japan
451.129	for two-and-a-half weeks,
456.329	and I came back with a 40-page essay
459.633	explaining every last detail
459.633	about Japan's temples,
463.221	its fashions, its baseball games,
466.49	its soul.
469.276	But underneath all that,
471.63	something that I couldn't understand
474.831	so moved me for reasons
474.831	I couldn't explain to you yet,
480.087	that I decided to go and live in Japan.
484.45	And now that I've been there for 28 years,
487.225	I really couldn't tell you
487.225	very much at all
489.649	about my adopted home.
492.222	Which is wonderful,
493.593	because it means every day
493.593	I'm making some new discovery,
496.497	and in the process,
498.012	looking around the corner
498.012	and seeing the hundred thousand things
501.93	I'll never know.
504.964	Knowledge is a priceless gift.
508.452	But the illusion of knowledge
508.452	can be more dangerous than ignorance.
513.895	Thinking that you know your lover
517.115	or your enemy
518.621	can be more treacherous
520.1	than acknowledging you'll never know them.
523.937	Every morning in Japan, as the sun
523.937	is flooding into our little apartment,
528.433	I take great pains not to consult
528.433	the weather forecast,
532.815	because if I do,
534.477	my mind will be overclouded, distracted,
537.764	even when the day is bright.
542.16	I've been a full-time
542.16	writer now for 34 years.
546.816	And the one thing that I have learned
549.72	is that transformation comes
549.72	when I'm not in charge,
553.28	when I don't know what's coming next,
555.481	when I can't assume I am bigger
555.481	than everything around me.
561.191	And the same is true in love
563.643	or in moments of crisis.
566.929	Suddenly, we're back in that trishaw again
570.395	and we're bumping off the broad,
570.395	well-lit streets;
574.454	and we're reminded, really,
574.454	of the first law of travel
578.142	and, therefore, of life:
581.09	you're only as strong
581.09	as your readiness to surrender.
587.512	In the end, perhaps,
589.545	being human
591.262	is much more important
593.039	than being fully in the know.
596.763	Thank you.
597.973	(Applause)
