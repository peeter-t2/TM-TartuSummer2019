27.063	That splendid music, the coming-in music,
30	"""The Elephant March"" from ""Aida,"""
30	is the music I've chosen for my funeral.
35.905	(Laughter)
37	And you can see why. It's triumphal.
42	I won't feel anything, but if I could,
46	I would feel triumphal
46	at having lived at all,
50	and at having lived
50	on this splendid planet,
52.12	and having been given
52.12	the opportunity to understand
55.257	something about why I was here
55.257	in the first place, before not being here.
62.448	Can you understand
62.448	my quaint English accent?
66.891	(Laughter)
69.651	Like everybody else, I was entranced
69.651	yesterday by the animal session.
74.75	Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;
80.213	the beauty of the things that they showed.
82.463	The only slight jarring note was when
82.463	Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,
88	"""the most splendid creatures"
88	"that God put on this earth."""
91.855	Now of course, we know
91.855	that he didn't really mean that,
95.48	but in this country at the moment,
95.48	you can't be too careful.
98.657	(Laughter)
100	I'm a biologist, and the central theorem
100	of our subject: the theory of design,
107	Darwin's theory of evolution
107	by natural selection.
111.723	In professional circles everywhere,
111.723	it's of course universally accepted.
116	In non-professional circles
116	outside America, it's largely ignored.
122	But in non-professional
122	circles within America,
126	it arouses so much hostility --
129	(Laughter)
130.1	it's fair to say that American biologists
130.1	are in a state of war.
136	The war is so worrying at present,
137.999	with court cases coming
137.999	up in one state after another,
140.596	that I felt I had to say
140.596	something about it.
143	If you want to know what I have
143	to say about Darwinism itself,
147	I'm afraid you're going
147	to have to look at my books,
150	which you won't find
150	in the bookstore outside.
153	(Laughter)
156.467	Contemporary court cases
158	often concern an allegedly
158	new version of creationism,
162	"called ""Intelligent Design,"" or ID."
166	Don't be fooled.
166	There's nothing new about ID.
170.149	It's just creationism under another name,
173.523	rechristened --
173.523	I choose the word advisedly --
176.905	(Laughter)
178	for tactical, political reasons.
180	The arguments of so-called ID theorists
182	are the same old arguments
182	that had been refuted again and again,
185.396	since Darwin down to the present day.
188.908	There is an effective evolution lobby
192	coordinating the fight
192	on behalf of science,
194.12	and I try to do all I can to help them,
197	but they get quite upset
197	when people like me dare to mention
201	that we happen to be atheists
201	as well as evolutionists.
205.302	They see us as rocking the boat,
205.302	and you can understand why.
210.689	Creationists, lacking any coherent
210.689	scientific argument for their case,
215.442	fall back on the popular
215.442	phobia against atheism:
220.42	Teach your children
220.42	evolution in biology class,
224	and they'll soon move on to drugs,
224	"grand larceny and sexual ""pre-version."""
229	(Laughter)
234	In fact, of course, educated
234	theologians from the Pope down
237	are firm in their support of evolution.
239.886	"This book, ""Finding"
239.886	"Darwin's God,"" by Kenneth Miller,"
242.829	is one of the most effective attacks
242.829	on Intelligent Design that I know
246.916	and it's all the more effective because
246.916	it's written by a devout Christian.
251	People like Kenneth Miller could be called
251	"a ""godsend"" to the evolution lobby,"
255.606	(Laughter)
257	because they expose the lie
257	that evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,
261.751	tantamount to atheism.
263.398	People like me, on the other
263.398	hand, rock the boat.
268.175	But here, I want to say something
268.175	nice about creationists.
271	It's not a thing I often do,
271	so listen carefully.
273.7	(Laughter)
275	I think they're right about one thing.
278	I think they're right that evolution
280	is fundamentally hostile to religion.
283.643	I've already said that many individual
283.643	evolutionists, like the Pope,
286.881	are also religious, but I think
286.881	they're deluding themselves.
290.46	I believe a true
290.46	understanding of Darwinism
293.428	is deeply corrosive to religious faith.
298.349	Now, it may sound as though
298.349	I'm about to preach atheism,
303.596	and I want to reassure you
303.596	that that's not what I'm going to do.
307.452	In an audience
307.452	as sophisticated as this one,
311	that would be preaching to the choir.
313.853	No, what I want to urge upon you --
316.497	(Laughter)
320.264	Instead, what I want to urge
320.264	upon you is militant atheism.
325	(Laughter)
327	(Applause)
330.222	But that's putting it too negatively.
333.001	If I was a person who were interested
333.001	in preserving religious faith,
337.674	I would be very afraid of the positive
337.674	power of evolutionary science,
342.847	and indeed science generally,
342.847	but evolution in particular,
345.72	to inspire and enthrall,
345.72	precisely because it is atheistic.
353.337	Now, the difficult problem
353.337	for any theory of biological design
357.114	is to explain the massive statistical
357.114	improbability of living things.
363	Statistical improbability
363	in the direction of good design --
367.796	"""complexity"" is another word for this."
370.269	The standard creationist argument --
372.04	there is only one;
372.04	they're all reduced to this one --
375	takes off from
375	a statistical improbability.
377.404	Living creatures are too complex
377.404	to have come about by chance;
380.714	therefore, they must have had a designer.
383.594	This argument of course,
383.594	shoots itself in the foot.
386.062	Any designer capable of designing
386.062	something really complex
389.401	has to be even more complex himself,
392.006	and that's before we even start
392.006	on the other things he's expected to do,
396	like forgive sins, bless
396	marriages, listen to prayers --
399.938	favor our side in a war --
402	(Laughter)
404.41	disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.
407	(Laughter)
409	Complexity is the problem
409	that any theory of biology has to solve,
414	and you can't solve it by postulating
414	an agent that is even more complex,
418.731	thereby simply compounding the problem.
421.928	Darwinian natural selection
421.928	is so stunningly elegant
426.349	because it solves the problem
426.349	of explaining complexity
430.198	in terms of nothing but simplicity.
434.094	Essentially, it does it
434.094	by providing a smooth ramp
437.387	of gradual, step-by-step increment.
441.757	But here, I only want to make the point
443.654	that the elegance of Darwinism
443.654	is corrosive to religion,
447.368	precisely because it is so elegant,
447.368	so parsimonious, so powerful,
452	so economically powerful.
456.285	It has the sinewy economy
456.285	of a beautiful suspension bridge.
463	The God theory is not just a bad theory.
465.615	It turns out to be -- in principle --
467.409	incapable of doing the job required of it.
471.464	So, returning to tactics
471.464	and the evolution lobby,
474.599	I want to argue that rocking the boat
477.745	may be just the right thing to do.
483.452	My approach to attacking creationism is --
486.072	unlike the evolution lobby --
488.579	my approach to attacking creationism
488.579	is to attack religion as a whole.
494.356	And at this point I need
494.356	to acknowledge the remarkable taboo
498.642	against speaking ill of religion,
501.152	and I'm going to do so in the words
501.152	of the late Douglas Adams,
504.525	a dear friend who,
504.525	if he never came to TED,
506.788	certainly should have been invited.
508.794	(Richard Saul Wurman: He was.)
510.285	Richard Dawkins: He was. Good.
510.285	I thought he must have been.
513.332	He begins this speech,
513.332	which was tape recorded in Cambridge
516.2	shortly before he died --
518	he begins by explaining how science
518	works through the testing of hypotheses
522.597	that are framed to be vulnerable
522.597	to disproof, and then he goes on.
526.224	"I quote, ""Religion doesn't"
526.224	seem to work like that.
530	It has certain ideas at the heart of it,
530	which we call 'sacred' or 'holy.'
534	What it means is:
534	here is an idea or a notion
537	that you're not allowed
537	to say anything bad about.
540.679	You're just not. Why not?
540.679	"Because you're not."""
545	(Laughter)
548.928	"""Why should it be"
548.928	that it's perfectly legitimate
551.373	to support the Republicans or Democrats,
553.386	this model of economics versus that,
555.77	Macintosh instead of Windows,
557.759	but to have an opinion
557.759	about how the universe began,
560.744	about who created the universe --
562.404	no, that's holy.
564.784	So, we're used to not
564.784	challenging religious ideas,
568.174	and it's very interesting how much
568.174	of a furor Richard creates
571.388	"when he does it."" --"
572.571	He meant me, not that one.
575.578	"""Everybody gets absolutely"
575.578	frantic about it,
578	because you're not allowed
578	to say these things.
580.612	Yet when you look at it rationally,
582.333	there's no reason why those ideas
584.453	shouldn't be as open
584.453	to debate as any other,
587.152	except that we've agreed
587.152	somehow between us
590.245	"that they shouldn't be."""
591.983	And that's the end
591.983	of the quote from Douglas.
596.864	In my view, not only is science
596.864	corrosive to religion;
601	religion is corrosive to science.
604.698	It teaches people
604.698	to be satisfied with trivial,
608.595	supernatural non-explanations,
611.642	and blinds them to the wonderful,
611.642	real explanations
615.397	that we have within our grasp.
617.595	It teaches them to accept
617.595	authority, revelation and faith,
623.66	instead of always insisting on evidence.
629.081	There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picture
629.081	"from his book, ""Last Chance to See."""
635	Now, there's a typical scientific journal,
637.684	The Quarterly Review of Biology.
639.341	And I'm going to put
639.341	together, as guest editor,
642.221	a special issue on the question,
642.221	"""Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?"""
647.49	And the first paper
647.49	is a standard scientific paper,
651.611	presenting evidence,
653.51	"""Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,"
655.269	and potassium argon dated
655.269	crater in Yucatan,
657.714	indicate that an asteroid
657.714	"killed the dinosaurs."""
660.349	Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.
663	Now, the next one.
664.557	"""The President of the Royal Society"
667.246	has been vouchsafed
667.246	a strong inner conviction
671.758	"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."""
674.285	(Laughter)
678.53	"""It has been privately"
678.53	revealed to Professor Huxtane
684.356	"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."""
686.301	(Laughter)
689.96	"""Professor Hordley was brought up"
692.285	"to have total and unquestioning faith"" --"
695	(Laughter) --
696.056	"""that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."""
703.459	"""Professor Hawkins has"
703.459	promulgated an official dogma
708	binding on all loyal Hawkinsians
711.468	"that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs."""
714.361	(Laughter)
717.523	That's inconceivable, of course.
721.848	But suppose --
723.102	[Supporters of the Asteroid Theory
723.102	cannot be patriotic citizens]
726.172	(Laughter)
727.911	(Applause)
732.774	In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.
736	whether he recognized
736	the equal citizenship and patriotism
739.842	of Americans who are atheists.
742	Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.
745	"""No, I don't know that atheists"
745	should be considered citizens,
749	nor should they be considered patriots.
751	"This is one nation under God."""
754.571	Bush's bigotry
754.571	was not an isolated mistake,
757.214	blurted out in the heat
757.214	of the moment and later retracted.
760.523	He stood by it in the face of repeated
760.523	calls for clarification or withdrawal.
765.394	He really meant it.
766.648	More to the point, he knew
766.648	it posed no threat to his election --
771.227	quite the contrary.
772.433	Democrats as well as Republicans
772.433	parade their religiousness
776.187	if they want to get elected.
777.935	Both parties invoke
777.935	"""one nation under God."""
782.119	What would Thomas Jefferson have said?
784.455	[In every country and in every age,
784.455	the priest has been hostile to liberty]
788.105	Incidentally, I'm not usually
788.105	very proud of being British,
792	but you can't help making the comparison.
796	(Applause)
804.485	In practice, what is an atheist?
807	An atheist is just somebody
807	who feels about Yahweh
811.332	the way any decent Christian feels
811.332	about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.
817.619	As has been said before, we are
817.619	all atheists about most of the gods
822	that humanity has ever believed in.
824.329	Some of us just go one god further.
827	(Laughter)
830	(Applause)
837	And however we define atheism,
837	it's surely the kind of academic belief
840.358	that a person is entitled
840.358	to hold without being vilified
844	as an unpatriotic,
844	unelectable non-citizen.
849.045	Nevertheless, it's an undeniable fact
849.045	that to own up to being an atheist
852.453	is tantamount to introducing yourself
852.453	as Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.
857.583	And that all stems
857.583	from the perception of atheists
861.309	as some kind of weird, way-out minority.
865.889	Natalie Angier wrote a rather
865.889	sad piece in the New Yorker,
869	saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.
871.42	She clearly feels
871.42	in a beleaguered minority.
873.882	But actually, how do American atheists
873.882	stack up numerically?
880	The latest survey makes
880	surprisingly encouraging reading.
883.296	Christianity, of course, takes a massive
883.296	lion's share of the population,
886.75	with nearly 160 million.
889.256	But what would you think
889.256	was the second largest group,
892.757	convincingly outnumbering Jews
892.757	with 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,
898.217	Hindus, Buddhists and all other
898.217	religions put together?
901.891	The second largest group,
901.891	with nearly 30 million,
904.558	is the one described
904.558	as non-religious or secular.
908.701	You can't help wondering
908.701	why vote-seeking politicians
912	are so proverbially overawed by the power
912	of, for example, the Jewish lobby --
917.206	the state of Israel seems to owe its very
917.206	existence to the American Jewish vote --
921.547	while at the same time,
923	consigning the non-religious
923	to political oblivion.
928.344	This secular non-religious vote,
928.344	if properly mobilized,
932	is nine times as numerous
932	as the Jewish vote.
936	Why does this far more
936	substantial minority
939	not make a move to exercise
939	its political muscle?
943.285	Well, so much for quantity.
943.285	How about quality?
946.539	Is there any correlation,
946.539	positive or negative,
949.666	between intelligence
949.666	and tendency to be religious?
953.701	[Them folks misunderestimated me]
955.962	(Laughter)
960.582	The survey that I quoted,
960.582	which is the ARIS survey,
964	didn't break down its data
964	by socio-economic class or education,
967.072	IQ or anything else.
968.818	But a recent article by Paul G. Bell
968.818	in the Mensa magazine
973	provides some straws in the wind.
975	Mensa, as you know,
975	is an international organization
977.501	for people with very high IQ.
980.835	And from a meta-analysis
980.835	of the literature,
985.794	Bell concludes that, I quote --
985.794	"""Of 43 studies carried out since 1927"
991	on the relationship
991	between religious belief,
993.319	and one's intelligence
993.319	or educational level,
995.809	all but four found an inverse connection.
1000	That is, the higher one's intelligence
1000	or educational level,
1003.641	"the less one is likely to be religious."""
1006	Well, I haven't seen
1006	the original 42 studies,
1008.199	and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,
1011.231	but I would like to see more
1011.231	studies done along those lines.
1014.968	And I know that there are --
1014.968	if I could put a little plug here --
1018.055	there are people in this audience
1019.675	easily capable of financing a massive
1019.675	research survey to settle the question,
1025	and I put the suggestion up,
1025	for what it's worth.
1027.609	But let me know show you some data
1029.283	that have been properly
1029.283	published and analyzed,
1031.536	on one special group --
1031.536	namely, top scientists.
1036.444	In 1998, Larson and Witham
1036.444	polled the cream of American scientists,
1042	those who'd been honored by election
1042	to the National Academy of Sciences,
1045.715	and among this select group,
1048.37	belief in a personal God dropped
1048.37	to a shattering seven percent.
1055	About 20 percent are agnostic;
1055	the rest could fairly be called atheists.
1059.771	Similar figures obtained
1059.771	for belief in personal immortality.
1063	Among biological scientists,
1063	the figure is even lower:
1066	5.5 percent, only, believe in God.
1069.779	Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.
1073	I've not seen corresponding
1073	figures for elite scholars
1076	in other fields,
1076	such as history or philosophy,
1079	but I'd be surprised
1079	if they were different.
1082.491	So, we've reached a truly
1082.491	remarkable situation,
1085.738	a grotesque mismatch
1085.738	between the American intelligentsia
1090.777	and the American electorate.
1093.364	A philosophical opinion
1093.364	about the nature of the universe,
1097	which is held by the vast majority
1097	of top American scientists
1101	and probably the majority
1101	of the intelligentsia generally,
1104.88	is so abhorrent to the American electorate
1107.704	that no candidate for popular election
1107.704	dare affirm it in public.
1113.077	If I'm right, this means that high office
1116	in the greatest country in the world
1118.67	is barred to the very people
1118.67	best qualified to hold it --
1122.781	the intelligentsia --
1124	unless they are prepared
1124	to lie about their beliefs.
1127	To put it bluntly:
1127	American political opportunities
1130.518	are heavily loaded against those
1133	who are simultaneously
1133	intelligent and honest.
1135.809	(Laughter)
1137.039	(Applause)
1143.374	I'm not a citizen of this country,
1143.374	so I hope it won't be thought unbecoming
1147	if I suggest that something
1147	needs to be done.
1150	(Laughter)
1152.524	And I've already hinted
1152.524	what that something is.
1155	From what I've seen of TED, I think this
1155	may be the ideal place to launch it.
1159.479	Again, I fear it will cost money.
1161.654	We need a consciousness-raising,
1164.225	coming-out campaign for American atheists.
1168	(Laughter)
1170	This could be similar to the campaign
1170	organized by homosexuals
1173.744	a few years ago,
1175	although heaven forbid
1175	that we should stoop to public outing
1178.357	of people against their will.
1180	In most cases, people who out themselves
1183	will help to destroy the myth that
1183	there is something wrong with atheists.
1187	On the contrary,
1188.177	they'll demonstrate that atheists
1188.177	are often the kinds of people
1191.271	who could serve as decent
1191.271	role models for your children,
1194	the kinds of people an advertising agent
1194	could use to recommend a product,
1198.791	the kinds of people
1198.791	who are sitting in this room.
1203	There should be a snowball effect,
1203	a positive feedback,
1206	such that the more names
1206	we have, the more we get.
1209.59	There could be non-linearities,
1209.59	threshold effects.
1212.383	When a critical mass has been obtained,
1214.486	there's an abrupt
1214.486	acceleration in recruitment.
1217.415	And again, it will need money.
1220.494	"I suspect that the word ""atheist"" itself"
1224	contains or remains a stumbling block
1227.491	far out of proportion
1227.491	to what it actually means,
1230.191	and a stumbling block to people
1231.788	who otherwise might be
1231.788	happy to out themselves.
1234.869	So, what other words might
1234.869	be used to smooth the path,
1237.618	oil the wheels, sugar the pill?
1241.382	"Darwin himself preferred ""agnostic"" --"
1244.404	and not only out of loyalty
1244.404	to his friend Huxley,
1247.532	who coined the term.
1249.733	"Darwin said, ""I have never been an atheist"
1252.59	in the same sense of denying
1252.59	the existence of a God.
1255.796	I think that generally an 'agnostic'
1258	would be the most correct
1258	"description of my state of mind."""
1261.846	He even became uncharacteristically
1261.846	tetchy with Edward Aveling.
1267.259	Aveling was a militant atheist
1269	who failed to persuade Darwin
1271	to accept the dedication
1271	of his book on atheism --
1274	incidentally, giving rise
1274	to a fascinating myth
1276.714	that Karl Marx tried to dedicate
1276.714	"""Das Kapital"" to Darwin,"
1280.135	which he didn't, it was
1280.135	actually Edward Aveling.
1282.527	What happened was that Aveling's
1282.527	mistress was Marx's daughter,
1287	and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,
1290.305	Marx's papers became muddled
1290.305	up with Aveling's papers,
1294.543	and a letter from Darwin saying,
1294.543	"""My dear sir, thank you very much"
1298.874	but I don't want you
1298.874	"to dedicate your book to me,"""
1301.261	was mistakenly supposed
1301.261	to be addressed to Marx,
1304.538	and that gave rise to this whole
1304.538	myth, which you've probably heard.
1307.879	It's a sort of urban myth, that Marx
1307.879	"tried to dedicate ""Kapital"" to Darwin."
1312.442	Anyway, it was Aveling, and when
1312.442	they met, Darwin challenged Aveling.
1319.682	"""Why do you call yourselves atheists?"""
1327.148	"""'Agnostic, '"" retorted Aveling, ""was"
1327.148	simply 'atheist' writ respectable,
1331.459	and 'atheist' was simply
1331.459	"'agnostic' writ aggressive."""
1335.292	"Darwin complained, ""But why"
1335.292	"should you be so aggressive?"""
1339.141	Darwin thought that atheism might be
1339.141	well and good for the intelligentsia,
1342.761	but that ordinary people were
1342.761	"not, quote, ""ripe for it."""
1346.857	Which is, of course, our old friend,
1346.857	"the ""don't rock the boat"" argument."
1351	It's not recorded whether Aveling told
1351	Darwin to come down off his high horse.
1356	(Laughter)
1357.851	But in any case,
1357.851	that was more than 100 years ago.
1360.225	You'd think we might have
1360.225	grown up since then.
1363.129	Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,
1368.417	who, incidentally, observes the Sabbath
1368.417	for reasons of cultural solidarity,
1372.566	describes himself
1372.566	"as a ""tooth-fairy agnostic."""
1377.066	He won't call himself an atheist
1378.653	because it's, in principle,
1378.653	impossible to prove a negative,
1382	"but ""agnostic"" on its own might"
1382	suggest that God's existence
1385	was therefore on equal terms
1385	of likelihood as his non-existence.
1390.166	So, my friend is strictly
1390.166	agnostic about the tooth fairy,
1394.507	but it isn't very likely, is it?
1397.524	Like God.
1399	"Hence the phrase, ""tooth-fairy agnostic."""
1401.329	Bertrand Russell made the same point
1403.115	using a hypothetical teapot
1403.115	in orbit about Mars.
1407.138	You would strictly have to be agnostic
1409	about whether there is a teapot
1409	in orbit about Mars,
1411.453	but that doesn't mean you treat
1411.453	the likelihood of its existence
1414.477	as on all fours with its non-existence.
1417.305	The list of things which we strictly
1417.305	have to be agnostic about
1420.634	doesn't stop at tooth fairies
1420.634	and teapots; it's infinite.
1424	If you want to believe
1424	one particular one of them --
1426.501	unicorns or tooth fairies
1426.501	or teapots or Yahweh --
1430.605	the onus is on you to say why.
1433	The onus is not on the rest
1433	of us to say why not.
1437	We, who are atheists,
1438.406	are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists.
1441.821	(Laughter)
1444.486	But we don't bother to say so.
1446.843	And this is why my friend
1446.843	"uses ""tooth-fairy agnostic"""
1450.693	as a label for what most people
1450.693	would call atheist.
1453.679	Nonetheless, if we want to attract
1453.679	deep-down atheists to come out publicly,
1459.122	we're going to have find
1459.122	something better to stick on our banner
1462.235	"than ""tooth-fairy"" or ""teapot agnostic."""
1465.643	"So, how about ""humanist""?"
1469.58	This has the advantage of a worldwide
1469.58	network of well-organized associations
1474	and journals and things already in place.
1476	My problem with it is only
1476	its apparent anthropocentrism.
1478.972	One of the things
1478.972	we've learned from Darwin
1481.002	is that the human species is only one
1483.502	among millions of cousins,
1483.502	some close, some distant.
1487.33	And there are other possibilities,
1487.33	"like ""naturalist,"""
1489.887	but that also has problems of confusion,
1492.346	because Darwin would have
1492.346	thought naturalist --
1494.576	"""Naturalist"" means, of course,"
1494.576	"as opposed to ""supernaturalist"" --"
1497.735	and it is used sometimes --
1499.123	Darwin would have been confused
1499.123	"by the other sense of ""naturalist,"""
1502.541	which he was, of course,
1503.756	and I suppose there might be others
1503.756	"who would confuse it with ""nudism""."
1508.772	(Laughter)
1510.014	Such people might be those
1510.014	belonging to the British lynch mob,
1516.936	which last year attacked a pediatrician
1516.936	in mistake for a pedophile.
1522	(Laughter)
1527.549	I think the best of the available
1527.549	"alternatives for ""atheist"""
1530.733	"is simply ""non-theist."""
1532	It lacks the strong connotation
1532	that there's definitely no God,
1535.024	and it could therefore easily be embraced
1535.024	by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.
1540.907	It's completely compatible
1540.907	with the God of the physicists.
1546.462	When atheists like Stephen Hawking
1546.462	"and Albert Einstein use the word ""God,"""
1553	they use it of course
1553	as a metaphorical shorthand
1556.737	for that deep, mysterious part of physics
1556.737	which we don't yet understand.
1562.221	"""Non-theist"" will do for all that,"
1562.221	"yet unlike ""atheist,"""
1567.261	it doesn't have the same
1567.261	phobic, hysterical responses.
1574.558	But I think, actually, the alternative
1576.436	is to grasp the nettle
1576.436	"of the word ""atheism"" itself,"
1579.309	precisely because it is a taboo word,
1582	carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.
1586.214	Critical mass may be harder
1586.214	"to achieve with the word ""atheist"""
1589.67	"than with the word ""non-theist,"""
1591.249	or some other non-confrontational word.
1593.685	But if we did achieve it
1593.685	"with that dread word ""atheist"" itself,"
1597.471	the political impact
1597.471	would be even greater.
1601.343	Now, I said that if I were religious,
1601.343	I'd be very afraid of evolution --
1604.772	I'd go further: I would fear science
1604.772	in general, if properly understood.
1608.43	And this is because
1608.43	the scientific worldview
1611.667	is so much more exciting, more poetic,
1614.756	more filled with sheer wonder
1617.257	than anything in the poverty-stricken
1617.257	arsenals of the religious imagination.
1624.237	As Carl Sagan, another recently
1624.237	dead hero, put it,
1629	"""How is it that hardly any major"
1629	religion has looked at science
1633.59	and concluded, 'This
1633.59	is better than we thought!
1637.909	The universe is much bigger
1637.909	than our prophet said,
1640.405	grander, more subtle, more elegant'?
1643.636	Instead they say, 'No, no, no!
1646	My god is a little god,
1646	and I want him to stay that way.'
1651.179	A religion, old or new,
1653.333	that stressed the magnificence
1653.333	of the universe
1656	as revealed by modern science,
1658	might be able to draw forth
1658	reserves of reverence and awe
1661.688	"hardly tapped by the conventional faiths."""
1666.22	Now, this is an elite audience,
1669.38	and I would therefore expect
1669.38	about 10 percent of you to be religious.
1675.904	Many of you probably subscribe
1675.904	to our polite cultural belief
1680.407	that we should respect religion.
1683.303	But I also suspect
1683.303	that a fair number of those
1687	secretly despise religion as much as I do.
1690.769	(Laughter)
1692.052	If you're one of them, and of course
1692.052	many of you may not be,
1694.929	but if you are one of them,
1696.261	I'm asking you to stop being polite,
1698.353	come out, and say so.
1701.113	And if you happen to be rich,
1703.136	give some thought to ways
1703.136	in which you might make a difference.
1707.369	The religious lobby in this country
1709.763	is massively financed by foundations --
1709.763	to say nothing of all the tax benefits --
1715.317	by foundations, such as the Templeton
1715.317	Foundation and the Discovery Institute.
1720.515	We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
1725.793	If my books sold as well
1725.793	as Stephen Hawking's books,
1729	instead of only as well as
1729	Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.
1736.454	People are always going on about,
1736.454	"""How did September the 11th change you?"""
1743.871	Well, here's how it changed me.
1746.469	Let's all stop being so damned respectful.
1751.38	Thank you very much.
1753	(Applause)
