13.202	Scientific breakthrough,
14.711	the kind that can potentially save lives,
17.324	can sometimes be lying right out in the open
19.388	for us to discover,
20.95	in the evolved, accumulated body
23.156	of human anecdote, for example,
25.748	or in the time-tested adaptations
27.774	that we observe in the natural world around us.
31.236	Science starts with observation,
33.856	but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures
37.252	that we might otherwise dismiss
39.197	as myth or coincidence,
41.064	isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor.
44.917	And when we do, the results will often surprise.
48.975	Western Australia has had a particular problem
50.855	with shark attacks over the last three years,
54.07	unfortunately and tragically culminating
56.251	in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period
59.331	during that time.
61.091	But Western Australia is not alone in this.
63.22	The incident of shark engagements on humans
66.125	is escalating worldwide.
68.469	And so it's not surprising, perhaps,
70.213	that in July of this year,
71.856	Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration
74.335	with the University of Western
74.335	Australia Oceans Institute
77.399	made an announcement which captured the attention
80.173	of the worldwide media and of ocean users
82.409	worldwide,
84.2	and that was around the development of technology
85.931	to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack
88.572	based on the science of what sharks can see.
91.72	And I have for you today
93.309	the story of that journey,
95.176	but also the notion that science can be
97.516	as powerful as a translator
99.981	as it can be for invention.
103.34	When we began this process,
105.046	we were looking, it was about three years ago,
108.228	and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks
111.65	in Western Australia,
113.421	and by chance, in a previous role,
115.628	I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler.
118.551	Now Harry Butler, who most Australians
118.551	would know is a famous naturalist,
122.258	had spent a lot of time in the marine environment.
124.593	Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like,
126.699	to the late Steve Irwin.
128.61	When I asked him about
129.921	what the solution to the problem might be,
133.219	the answer was quite surprising.
134.731	"He said, ""Take a black wetsuit,"
136.606	band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee,
139.371	and you'll be mimicking the warning systems
141.659	"of most marine species."""
143.968	I didn't think about that much at the time,
145.866	and it wasn't until the next three
145.866	fatal shark attacks happened,
149.456	and it caused me to think,
150.89	maybe there's some merit to this idea.
153.021	And I turned to the web
154.486	to see if there might be some clues.
156.741	And it turns out the web is awash
159.018	with this sort of evidence that supports
161.414	this sort of thinking.
162.976	So biologically, there are plenty of species
164.96	that display banding or patterns, warning patterns,
167.556	to either be cryptical in the water
169.258	or warn against being attacked,
171.842	not the least of which is the pilot fish
173.955	which spends a big slab of its life
176.111	around the business end of a shark.
178.39	On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer,
181.481	has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s,
184.343	and anthropologically,
185.965	Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands
189.595	in a sea snake ceremony
191.376	to ward off the shark god.
193.97	So what's going on here?
195.412	Is this an idea lying wide out in the open
198.29	for us to consider and define?
201.421	We know that sharks use a range of sensors
205.79	when they engage, particularly for attack,
209.162	but the sight sensor is the one that they use
211.122	to identify the target, and particularly
212.686	in the last number of meters before the attack.
216.42	It makes sense to pay attention
216.42	to the biological anecdote
219.378	because that's time-tested evolution
221.23	over many millennia.
223.703	But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts,
227.18	the idea that there's a kernel of truth
228.911	thought to be important,
230.503	passed down from generation to generation,
233.788	so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior?
237.103	I wanted to test this idea.
238.763	I wanted to put some science
239.981	to this anecdotal evidence,
242.317	because if science could support this concept,
244.273	then we might have at least part of the solution
246.368	to shark attack right under our very nose.
249.426	To do that, I needed some experts
251.221	in shark vision and shark neurology,
253.074	and a worldwide search, again,
254.883	led to the University of W.A.
256.322	on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute.
258.725	And professor Nathan Hart and his team
261.322	had just written a paper which tells us,
263.982	confirms that predatory sharks see
266.334	in black and white, or grayscale.
269.197	So I called up Nathan,
271	a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea
272.866	that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes
274.747	to produce a wetsuit to try and
274.747	mitigate the risk of shark attack,
278.253	and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea.
280.425	So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research
282.887	supported by the West Australian State Government.
285.511	And we did three key things.
288.07	The first is that we mapped the characteristics,
290.79	the physical characteristics of the eyes
292.81	of the three main predatory sharks,
294.748	so the great white, tiger and bull shark.
298.466	We did that genetically
300.02	and we did that anatomically.
302.92	The next thing we did was to understand,
304.762	using complex computer modeling,
306.197	what that eye can see
308.251	at different depths, distances,
310.02	light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean.
314.261	And from there, we were able to pinpoint
315.451	two key characteristics:
317.251	what patterns and shapes would present the wearer
320.284	as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic,
323.516	and what patterns and shapes might provide
325.012	the greatest contrast but provide the greatest
327.933	breakup of profile
329.39	so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey
333.034	or shark food.
335.387	The next thing we needed to do was to convert this
337.579	into wetsuits that people might actually wear,
340.328	and to that end, I invited Ray Smith,
342.95	a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer,
346.18	and in fact the guy that designed
346.18	the original Quiksilver logo,
348.542	to come over and sit with the science team
350.827	and interpret that science
354.423	into aesthetic wetsuits that
354.423	people might actually wear.
357.565	And here's an example of one of the first drawings.
360.021	"So this is what I call a ""don't eat me"" wetsuit."
363.025	So this takes that banding idea,
367.294	takes that banding idea, it's highly visible,
369.88	provides a highly disruptive profile,
371.885	and is intended to prevent the shark
373.712	from considering that you would be ordinary food,
376.38	and potentially even create confusion for the shark.
379.726	And this one's configured to go with a surfboard.
383.501	You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front,
386.114	and it's particularly better for the surface,
388.841	where being backlit and providing a silhouette
391.689	is problematic.
393.301	Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit,
396.209	or the one which attempts to hide the wearer
397.82	in the water column.
399.31	There are three panels on this suit,
401	and in any given conditions,
402.624	one or more of those panels
403.979	will match the reflective spectra of the water
406.569	so as to disappear fully or partially,
409.168	leaving the last panel or panels
411.36	to create a disruptive profile in the water column.
414.247	And this one's particularly well-suited
416.412	to the dive configuration,
418.859	so when you're deeper under the water.
421.927	So we knew that we had
423.637	some really solid science here.
425.407	We knew, if you wanted to stand out,
427.033	you needed to look stripy,
428.205	and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic,
429.629	you needed to look like this.
431.181	But the acid test is always going to be,
433.007	how would sharks really behave
434.339	in the context of these patterns and shapes.
437.07	And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit
440.381	in the water with a predatory shark
441.929	in a natural environment
443.295	is actually a lot harder than you might think.
445.247	(Laughter)
448.598	So we have to bait the rig,
451.164	because we need to get the statistical number
452.708	of samples through to get the scientific evidence,
455.732	and by baiting the rig,
456.521	we're obviously changing shark behavior.
458.75	We can't put humans in the water.
460.567	We're ethically precluded from even using
463.453	humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water.
466.1	But nevertheless, we started the testing process
468.372	in January of this year,
470.22	initially with tiger sharks
471.356	and subsequently with great white sharks.
474.695	The way we did that
476.13	was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait,
480.885	wrap it in a neoprene skin,
482.781	and then run two stereo underwater cameras
485.344	to watch how the shark
485.344	actually engages with that rig.
488.693	And because we use stereo,
490.381	we can capture all the statistics
490.381	on how big the shark is,
493.173	what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves,
495.429	and what its behavior is
497.285	in an empirical rather than a subjective way.
500.491	Because we needed to
500.491	preserve the scientific method,
502.979	we ran a control rig
504.677	which was a black neoprene rig
508.389	just like a normal black wetsuit
510.198	against the, what we call,
511.677	SAMS technology rig.
513.805	And the results were not just exciting,
516.533	but very encouraging,
517.971	and today I would like to just give you a snapshot
520.519	of two of those engagements.
524.181	So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark
526.301	engaging the black control rig,
529.388	which it had encountered about
530.729	a minute and a half before.
551.78	Now that exact same shark had engaged,
554.21	or encountered this SAMS rig,
556.04	which is the Elude SAMS rig,
557.652	about eight minutes before,
558.831	and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it,
561.974	looking for what it could
561.974	smell and sense but not see,
564.779	and this was the final engagement.
569.734	Great white sharks are more
569.734	confident than the tigers,
572.687	and here you see great white shark
574.735	engaging a control rig,
576.142	so a black neoprene wetsuit,
577.975	and going straight to the bottom,
579.559	coming up
582.11	and engaging.
586.257	In contrast to the SAMS technology rig,
588.94	this is the banded one,
590.409	where it's more tactile,
592.35	it's more investigative,
593.86	it's more apprehensive,
595.494	and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go.
608.297	(Applause)
618.601	So, it's important for us that all 
618.601	the testing is done independently,
622.877	and the University of W.A. is doing the testing.
625.195	It'll be an ongoing process.
626.947	It's subject to peer review and subject to publication.
629.356	It's so important that this concept
631.699	is led with the science.
633.497	From the perspective of Shark 
633.497	Attack Mitigation Systems,
635.741	we're a biotechnology licensing company,
638.146	so we don't make wetsuits ourselves.
640.433	We'll license others to do that.
642.713	But I thought you might be interested
643.672	in seeing what SAMS technology looks like
645.673	embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end,
648.672	for the first time, live, worldwide --
651.888	(Laughter) —
653.862	I can show you what biological adaptation,
656.758	science and design looks like in real life.
660.285	So I can welcome Sam, the surfer,
662.182	from this side. Where are you, Sam?
664.89	(Applause)
666.686	And Eduardo.
668.356	(Applause)
670.172	Cheers, mate.
672.866	Cheers.
674.956	Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause)
681.656	So what have we done here?
682.943	Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet
685.96	and use science as a tool for invention,
689.28	we've paid attention to the biological evidence,
692.136	we've put importance to the
693.826	human anecdotal evidence,
695.536	and we've used science as a tool
698.618	for translation,
700.021	translation of something that was already there
702.248	into something that we can 
702.248	use for the benefit of mankind.
705.819	And it strikes me that this idea of science
707.743	as a tool for translation rather than invention
710.799	is one that we can apply much more widely than this
713.463	in the pursuit of innovation.
715.41	After all, did the Wright brothers
717.735	discover manned flight,
719.787	or did they observe the biological fact of flight
722.976	and translate that mechanically, replicate it
726.168	in a way that humans could use?
728.685	As for the humble wetsuit,
730.219	who knows what oceanwear will look like
732.16	in two years' time, in five years' time
735.111	or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking,
738.203	I'm guessing there's a fair chance
739.469	it won't be pure black.
741.19	Thank you.
743.359	(Applause)
