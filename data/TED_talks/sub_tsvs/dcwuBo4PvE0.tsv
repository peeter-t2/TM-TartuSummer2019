13.6	I am British.
15.56	(Laughter)
17.72	(Applause)
20.88	Never before has the phrase
20.88	"""I am British"" elicited so much pity."
24.68	(Laughter)
26.8	I come from an island
26.8	where many of us like to believe
29.56	there's been a lot of continuity
29.56	over the last thousand years.
33.4	We tend to have historically
33.4	imposed change on others
36.16	but done much less of it ourselves.
39.36	So it came as an immense shock to me
41.84	when I woke up on the morning of June 24
44.64	to discover that my country
44.64	had voted to leave the European Union,
48.52	my Prime Minister had resigned,
50.4	and Scotland was considering a referendum
53	that could bring to an end
53	the very existence of the United Kingdom.
58.92	So that was an immense shock for me,
61.88	and it was an immense
61.88	shock for many people,
65.08	but it was also something
65.08	that, over the following several days,
68.56	created a complete political meltdown
71.32	in my country.
72.8	There were calls for a second referendum,
75.04	almost as if, following a sports match,
77.6	we could ask the opposition for a replay.
80.88	Everybody was blaming everybody else.
83.36	People blamed the Prime Minister
84.96	for calling the referendum
84.96	in the first place.
87.16	They blamed the leader of the opposition
87.16	for not fighting it hard enough.
90.64	The young accused the old.
91.92	The educated blamed
91.92	the less well-educated.
95.44	That complete meltdown was made even worse
98.56	by the most tragic element of it:
100.68	levels of xenophobia and racist abuse
100.68	in the streets of Britain
104.56	at a level that I have never seen before
106.84	in my lifetime.
109.8	People are now talking about whether
109.8	my country is becoming a Little England,
114.2	or, as one of my colleagues put it,
116.32	whether we're about to become
116.32	a 1950s nostalgia theme park
120.52	floating in the Atlantic Ocean.
122.56	(Laughter)
125.84	But my question is really,
128.4	should we have the degree of shock
128.4	that we've experienced since?
133.44	Was it something
133.44	that took place overnight?
135.84	Or are there deeper structural factors
135.84	that have led us to where we are today?
140.36	So I want to take a step back
140.36	and ask two very basic questions.
144.96	First, what does Brexit represent,
147.88	not just for my country,
149.44	but for all of us around the world?
152.2	And second, what can we do about it?
155.4	How should we all respond?
157.76	So first, what does Brexit represent?
160.96	Hindsight is a wonderful thing.
163.84	Brexit teaches us many things
163.84	about our society
167.92	and about societies around the world.
171.4	It highlights in ways
171.4	that we seem embarrassingly unaware of
174.64	how divided our societies are.
176.84	The vote split along lines of age,
176.84	education, class and geography.
183.2	Young people didn't turn out
183.2	to vote in great numbers,
186.12	but those that did wanted to remain.
188.36	Older people really wanted
188.36	to leave the European Union.
192.12	Geographically, it was London and Scotland
192.12	that most strongly committed
195.64	to being part of the European Union,
197.68	while in other parts of the country
197.68	there was very strong ambivalence.
203	Those divisions are things we really
203	need to recognize and take seriously.
207.4	But more profoundly,
207.4	the vote teaches us something
210.28	about the nature of politics today.
212.64	Contemporary politics
212.64	is no longer just about right and left.
216.92	It's no longer just about tax and spend.
219.68	It's about globalization.
221.64	The fault line of contemporary politics is
221.64	between those that embrace globalization
226.48	and those that fear globalization.
230.32	(Applause)
235.68	If we look at why
235.68	those who wanted to leave --
238.36	"we call them ""Leavers,"""
238.36	"as opposed to ""Remainers"" --"
240.92	we see two factors in the opinion polls
243.16	that really mattered.
244.56	The first was immigration,
244.56	and the second sovereignty,
247.92	and these represent a desire for people
247.92	to take back control of their own lives
253.4	and the feeling that they
253.4	are unrepresented by politicians.
258.56	But those ideas are ones
258.56	that signify fear and alienation.
263.96	They represent a retreat
263.96	back towards nationalism and borders
269	in ways that many of us would reject.
271.6	What I want to suggest is the picture
271.6	is more complicated than that,
274.84	that liberal internationalists,
276.4	like myself, and I firmly
276.4	include myself in that picture,
279.64	need to write ourselves
279.64	back into the picture
282.2	in order to understand
282.2	how we've got to where we are today.
287.2	When we look at the voting patterns
287.2	across the United Kingdom,
290.32	we can visibly see the divisions.
293.24	The blue areas show Remain
295.6	and the red areas Leave.
297.72	When I looked at this,
299	what personally struck me
299	was the very little time in my life
302.88	I've actually spent
302.88	in many of the red areas.
306.12	I suddenly realized that,
306.12	looking at the top 50 areas in the UK
311.28	that have the strongest Leave vote,
313.16	I've spent a combined total
313.16	of four days of my life in those areas.
319.56	In some of those places,
321.08	I didn't even know the names
321.08	of the voting districts.
324.68	It was a real shock to me,
326.56	and it suggested that people like me
328.64	who think of ourselves
328.64	as inclusive, open and tolerant,
332.76	perhaps don't know
332.76	our own countries and societies
335.48	nearly as well as we like to believe.
338.12	(Applause)
348.2	And the challenge that comes from that
348.2	is we need to find a new way
352	to narrate globalization to those people,
355.12	to recognize that for those people who
355.12	have not necessarily been to university,
359.52	who haven't necessarily
359.52	grown up with the Internet,
361.96	that don't get opportunities to travel,
364	they may be unpersuaded
364	by the narrative that we find persuasive
367.88	in our often liberal bubbles.
370.52	(Applause)
375.88	It means that we need to reach out
375.88	more broadly and understand.
379.52	In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled
379.52	the politics of fear and hatred,
385.56	creating lies and mistrust
388.08	around, for instance,
388.08	the idea that the vote on Europe
391.04	could reduce the number of refugees
391.04	and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,
395.2	when the vote on leaving
395.2	had nothing to do with immigration
398.48	from outside the European Union.
401.12	But for a significant majority
401.12	of the Leave voters
404.68	the concern was disillusionment
404.68	with the political establishment.
408.36	This was a protest vote for many,
410.56	a sense that nobody represented them,
413.04	that they couldn't find
413.04	a political party that spoke for them,
416.48	and so they rejected
416.48	that political establishment.
421.44	This replicates around Europe
421.44	and much of the liberal democratic world.
426.52	We see it with the rise in popularity
426.52	of Donald Trump in the United States,
431.44	with the growing nationalism
431.44	of Viktor Orb√°n in Hungary,
435.52	with the increase in popularity
435.52	of Marine Le Pen in France.
440.24	The specter of Brexit
440.24	is in all of our societies.
445.08	So the question I think we need to ask
445.08	is my second question,
448.12	which is how should we
448.12	collectively respond?
451.28	For all of us who care about creating
451.28	liberal, open, tolerant societies,
457.28	we urgently need a new vision,
459.96	a vision of a more tolerant,
459.96	inclusive globalization,
463.68	one that brings people with us
463.68	rather than leaving them behind.
468.64	That vision of globalization
470.6	is one that has to start by a recognition
470.6	of the positive benefits of globalization.
475.44	The consensus amongst economists
478.04	is that free trade,
478.04	the movement of capital,
480.84	the movement of people across borders
482.8	benefit everyone on aggregate.
485.56	The consensus amongst
485.56	international relations scholars
488.28	is that globalization
488.28	brings interdependence,
490.92	which brings cooperation and peace.
493.88	But globalization
493.88	also has redistributive effects.
498.36	It creates winners and losers.
501.12	To take the example of migration,
503.28	we know that immigration is a net positive
503.28	for the economy as a whole
506.96	under almost all circumstances.
510.36	But we also have to be very aware
513.16	that there are
513.16	redistributive consequences,
516.24	that importantly, low-skilled immigration
519.72	can lead to a reduction in wages
519.72	for the most impoverished in our societies
524.159	and also put pressure on house prices.
526.32	That doesn't detract
526.32	from the fact that it's positive,
528.88	but it means more people
528.88	have to share in those benefits
531.799	and recognize them.
535.2	In 2002, the former Secretary-General
535.2	of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,
540.12	gave a speech at Yale University,
543.04	and that speech was on the topic
543.04	of inclusive globalization.
547.04	That was the speech
547.04	in which he coined that term.
550.12	And he said, and I paraphrase,
552.92	"""The glass house of globalization"
552.92	has to be open to all
558.28	if it is to remain secure.
561.28	Bigotry and ignorance
564.56	are the ugly face of exclusionary
564.56	"and antagonistic globalization."""
571.16	That idea of inclusive globalization
571.16	was briefly revived in 2008
576.36	in a conference on progressive governance
578.96	involving many of the leaders
578.96	of European countries.
583.16	But amid austerity
583.16	and the financial crisis of 2008,
587.16	the concept disappeared
587.16	almost without a trace.
590.28	Globalization has been taken
590.28	to support a neoliberal agenda.
594.76	It's perceived to be
594.76	part of an elite agenda
597.72	rather than something that benefits all.
600.32	And it needs to be reclaimed
600.32	on a far more inclusive basis
603.96	than it is today.
605.72	So the question is,
605.72	how can we achieve that goal?
609.48	How can we balance on the one hand
609.48	addressing fear and alienation
614.24	while on the other hand
614.24	refusing vehemently
617.68	to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?
621.48	That is the question for all of us.
623.64	And I think, as a social scientist,
625.48	that social science
625.48	offers some places to start.
629	Our transformation has to be about
629	both ideas and about material change,
634.24	and I want to give you four ideas
634.24	as a starting point.
637.88	The first relates to the idea
637.88	of civic education.
642.44	What stands out from Brexit
644.24	is the gap between public perception
644.24	and empirical reality.
648.32	It's been suggested that we've moved
648.32	to a postfactual society,
652.04	where evidence and truth no longer matter,
654.72	and lies have equal status
654.72	to the clarity of evidence.
658.84	So how can we --
660.12	(Applause)
662.84	How can we rebuild respect for truth
662.84	and evidence into our liberal democracies?
668.04	It has to begin with education,
670	but it has to start with the recognition
670	that there are huge gaps.
674.44	In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI
678.64	published a survey
678.64	on attitudes to immigration,
681.96	and it showed that as numbers
681.96	of immigrants increase,
686	so public concern
686	with immigration also increases,
689.24	although it obviously
689.24	didn't unpack causality,
691.68	because this could equally be to do
691.68	not so much with numbers
694.84	but the political
694.84	and media narrative around it.
697.8	But the same survey also revealed
701.6	huge public misinformation
703.76	and misunderstanding
703.76	about the nature of immigration.
707.52	For example, in these attitudes
707.52	in the United Kingdom,
710.76	the public believed that levels of asylum
713.52	were a greater proportion
713.52	of immigration than they were,
716.96	but they also believed
716.96	the levels of educational migration
720.44	were far lower as a proportion
720.44	of overall migration
723.56	than they actually are.
725.08	So we have to address this misinformation,
727.76	the gap between perception and reality
727.76	on key aspects of globalization.
732.28	And that can't just be something
732.28	that's left to our schools,
735.12	although that's important
735.12	to begin at an early age.
737.56	It has to be about lifelong
737.56	civic participation
740.64	and public engagement
740.64	that we all encourage as societies.
746	The second thing
746	that I think is an opportunity
748.8	is the idea to encourage more interaction
748.8	across diverse communities.
753.44	(Applause)
757.76	One of the things that stands out
757.76	for me very strikingly,
760.76	looking at immigration attitudes
760.76	in the United Kingdom,
763.64	is that ironically,
763.64	the regions of my country
766.44	that are the most tolerant of immigrants
768.369	have the highest numbers of immigrants.
771.16	So for instance, London and the Southeast
771.16	have the highest numbers of immigrants,
775.52	and they are also by far
775.52	the most tolerant areas.
778.68	It's those areas of the country
778.68	that have the lowest levels of immigration
782.32	that actually are the most exclusionary
782.32	and intolerant towards migrants.
787.4	So we need to encourage exchange programs.
789.76	We need to ensure that older generations
789.76	who maybe can't travel
793.24	get access to the Internet.
795.4	We need to encourage,
795.4	even on a local and national level,
798.12	more movement, more participation,
800	more interaction
800	with people who we don't know
802.72	and whose views we might
802.72	not necessarily agree with.
806.88	The third thing that I think
806.88	is crucial, though,
809.24	and this is really fundamental,
811.04	is we have to ensure that everybody shares
813.36	in the benefits of globalization.
816.52	This illustration from the Financial Times
816.52	post-Brexit is really striking.
821.28	It shows tragically that those people
821.28	who voted to leave the European Union
825.04	were those who actually
825.04	benefited the most materially
827.88	from trade with the European Union.
831.08	But the problem is
831.08	that those people in those areas
833.64	didn't perceive themselves
833.64	to be beneficiaries.
836.32	They didn't believe that they
836.32	were actually getting access
839.12	to material benefits of increased trade
839.12	and increased mobility around the world.
845.8	I work on questions
845.8	predominantly to do with refugees,
849.6	and one of the ideas
849.6	I spent a lot of my time preaching,
852.28	mainly to developing countries
852.28	around the world,
855.08	is that in order to encourage
855.08	the integration of refugees,
858.68	we can't just benefit
858.68	the refugee populations,
861.04	we also have to address the concerns
861.04	of the host communities in local areas.
867.48	But in looking at that,
868.84	one of the policy prescriptions
868.84	is that we have to provide
871.88	disproportionately better
871.88	education facilities, health facilities,
875.52	access to social services
877.32	in those regions of high immigration
879.6	to address the concerns
879.6	of those local populations.
882.44	But while we encourage that
882.44	around the developing world,
885.12	we don't take those lessons home
886.72	and incorporate them in our own societies.
890.52	Furthermore, if we're going
890.52	to really take seriously
893.56	the need to ensure people share
893.56	in the economic benefits,
896.92	our businesses and corporations
896.92	need a model of globalization
900.6	that recognizes that they, too,
900.6	have to take people with them.
905.44	The fourth and final idea
905.44	I want to put forward
908.52	is an idea that we need
908.52	more responsible politics.
912.08	There's very little
912.08	social science evidence
915.24	that compares attitudes on globalization.
918.08	But from the surveys that do exist,
920.64	what we can see is there's huge variation
920.64	across different countries
925.4	and time periods in those countries
927.72	for attitudes and tolerance
929.12	of questions like migration
929.12	and mobility on the one hand
932.84	and free trade on the other.
934.92	But one hypothesis that I think emerges
934.92	from a cursory look at that data
940.2	is the idea that polarized societies
940.2	are far less tolerant of globalization.
946.32	It's the societies
946.32	like Sweden in the past,
949.16	like Canada today,
950.6	where there is a centrist politics,
952.44	where right and left work together,
954.52	that we encourage supportive attitudes
954.52	towards globalization.
958.56	And what we see around the world today
958.56	is a tragic polarization,
962.4	a failure to have dialogue
962.4	between the extremes in politics,
965.44	and a gap in terms
965.44	of that liberal center ground
968.24	that can encourage communication
968.24	and a shared understanding.
972.08	We might not achieve that today,
973.72	but at the very least we have to call
973.72	upon our politicians and our media
977.56	to drop a language of fear
977.56	and be far more tolerant of one another.
981.36	(Applause)
989.8	These ideas are very tentative,
992.6	and that's in part because this needs
992.6	to be an inclusive and shared project.
998	I am still British.
1000.92	I am still European.
1003.64	I am still a global citizen.
1007.2	For those of us who believe
1009.24	that our identities
1009.24	are not mutually exclusive,
1013.36	we have to all work together
1016.4	to ensure that globalization
1016.4	takes everyone with us
1020.12	and doesn't leave people behind.
1022.36	Only then will we truly reconcile
1022.36	democracy and globalization.
1027.96	Thank you.
1029.2	(Applause)
