12.809	I once had this nightmare:
15.007	I'm standing in the middle
15.007	of a deserted field full of land mines.
19.571	In real life, I love to hike,
22.06	but every time I want to go on a hike,
22.06	it makes me nervous.
26.327	I have this thought in the back of my mind
28.875	that I might lose a limb.
31.402	This underlying fear started 10 years ago,
34.125	after I met Mohammed,
34.125	a cluster bomb survivor
37.447	of the summer 2006
37.447	Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.
42.303	Mohammed, like so many
42.303	other survivors all around the world,
45.581	had to live through the horrifying
45.581	repercussions of cluster munitions
50.592	on a daily basis.
53.122	When the one-month conflict
53.122	started in Lebanon,
55.785	I was still working
55.785	at Agence France-Presse in Paris.
59.837	I remember how I was glued to the screens,
62.463	anxiously following the news.
65.155	I wanted to reassure myself
66.862	that the falling bombs
66.862	missed my parents' home.
70.773	When I arrived in Beirut
70.773	on assignment to cover that war,
74.335	I was relieved to be united
74.335	with my family,
76.827	after they had finally managed
76.827	to escape southern Lebanon.
80.744	The day the war was over,
82.567	I remember seeing this image --
84.742	one of blocked roads,
86.209	of displaced people eagerly rushing
86.209	south, back to their homes,
90.362	regardless of what they would find.
93.374	An estimated four million
93.374	cluster submunitions
96.468	were spread in Lebanon during
96.468	the 34-day conflict.
102.462	Mohammed lost both legs
102.462	during the last week of the conflict.
106.826	The fact that he lives a five-minute
106.826	drive from my parents' home
109.901	made it easier to follow
109.901	him through the years.
112.68	It was now almost 10 years
112.68	since we first met.
116.309	I saw the young boy
117.884	who had to endure
117.884	physical and emotional trauma.
122.277	I saw the teenager who tried
122.277	to offer his friends tattoos,
125.633	in return for a set fee of five dollars.
129.17	And I know the young, jobless man
129.17	who spends hours surfing the Internet
133.337	trying to meet a girl who might
133.337	become his girlfriend.
137.408	His fate and the effects
137.408	of losing his legs
140.946	are now his daily reality.
143.578	Survivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed
145.991	have to deal with so many details
145.991	that never occur to us.
149.817	Who would have imagined
151.017	that so many daily tasks we do
151.017	or take for granted,
153.776	such as going to the beach or even
153.776	picking up something from the floor,
158.053	would become sources
158.053	of stress and anxiety?
161.886	Well, that's what eventually
161.886	became of Mohammed,
164.221	due to his inflexible prosthetic legs.
168.465	Ten years ago, I had no clue
168.465	what a cluster bomb was,
172.159	nor its horrifying implications.
174.835	I learned that this indiscriminate
174.835	weapon was used
177.296	in so many parts of the world
178.835	and continues to kill on a regular basis,
181.131	without distinguishing
181.131	between a military target
184.194	or a child.
186.141	I naively asked myself,
188.006	"""But seriously, who made those weapons?"
191.847	"And what for?"""
193.687	Let me explain to you
193.687	what a cluster bomb is.
196.179	It's a large canister
196.179	filled with bomblets.
199.377	When it's dropped from the air,
201.064	it opens up in midair to release
201.064	hundreds of bomblets.
205.632	They scatter around wide areas
207.774	and on impact,
208.951	many fail to explode.
211.348	Those unexploded ones end up
211.348	just like landmines --
214.593	sitting on the ground,
215.85	waiting for their next target.
218.56	If someone steps on them by accident
221.038	or picks them up,
222.22	they can explode.
224.283	These weapons are extremely unpredictable,
227.19	which makes the threat even bigger.
229.243	One day, a farmer can work
229.243	his land without a problem.
232.366	The next day, he can make fire
232.366	and burn some branches,
236.345	and the submunitions close by
236.345	could be set off because of the heat.
240.762	The problem is children mistake
240.762	those bomblets for toys,
244.335	because they can look like
244.335	bouncy balls or soda cans.
248.943	Being a documentary photographer,
250.833	I decided to go back to Lebanon
250.833	a few months after the conflict ended
254.996	to meet cluster bomb survivors.
256.993	And I met a few --
258.168	Hussein and Rasha,
259.765	who both lost a leg to submunitions.
262.143	Their stories are similar to so many
262.143	other kids' stories across the world
266.383	and are a testimony
266.383	to the horrifying implications
269.456	of the continuous use of such weapons.
273.332	That's when I met Mohammed,
273.332	in January 2007.
277.427	He was 11 years old,
278.731	and I met him exactly four months
278.731	after his accident.
282.777	When I first saw him,
283.952	he was going through painful physiotherapy
286.095	to recover from his fresh wounds.
288.547	Still in shock at such a young age,
290.843	Mohammed was struggling
290.843	to get used to his new body.
294.65	He would even wake up sometimes
294.65	at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.
300.187	What drew me closer to his story
300.187	was my instant realization
303.9	of the difficulties Mohammed
303.9	was likely to face in the future --
307.997	that what he has been suffering
307.997	while adjusting to his injury
311.346	at the age of 11,
313.04	would increase manyfold.
315.771	Even before his disability,
317.385	Mohammed's life wasn't easy.
319.626	He was born in the Rashidieh Camp
319.626	for Palestinian refugees,
322.93	and this is where he still lives.
325.103	Lebanon holds some 400,000
325.103	Palestinian refugees,
328.849	and they suffer from discriminatory laws.
331.662	They're not allowed to work
331.662	in the public sector
334.259	or practice certain professions
336.266	and are denied the right to own property.
339.278	This is one of the reasons
340.557	why Mohammed doesn't really
340.557	regret dropping out of school
343.324	right after his injury.
345.397	"He said, ""What's the point"
345.397	of a university degree
348.96	"when I can't find a job to start with?"""
353.046	Cluster bomb use creates a vicious circle
353.046	of impact on communities,
357.284	and not only the lives of their victims.
359.993	Many who get injured by this weapon
359.993	drop out of school,
363.832	can't find jobs or even lose their jobs,
366.293	therefore losing the ability
366.293	to provide for their families.
369.887	This is not to mention
369.887	the continuous physical pain
373.238	and the experience of feeling isolated.
377.512	These weapons affect
377.512	the poorest of the poor.
380.624	The high medical cost
380.624	is a burden to the families.
383.884	They end up relying
383.884	on humanitarian agencies,
386.955	which is insufficient and unsustainable,
389.508	especially when injuries require
389.508	lifelong support to the injured.
393.704	Ten years after Mohammed's injury,
395.566	he is still unable to afford
395.566	proper prosthetic legs.
399.856	He's very cautious with his steps,
401.685	as a couple of falls over the years
403.727	brought him embarrassment
403.727	among his friends.
407.218	He joked that since he doesn't have legs,
409.321	some days he tries to walk on his hands.
413.054	One of the worst yet invisible
413.054	impacts of the weapon
416.436	is the psychological scars it leaves.
419.348	In one of Mohammed's
419.348	early medical reports,
421.688	he was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.
424.755	He suffered from anxiety,
424.755	poor appetite, sleep disturbance
430.011	and showed signs of anger.
433.197	The reality is Mohammed never received
433.197	proper help to fully recover.
438.271	His current obsession
438.271	is to leave Lebanon at any cost --
442.511	even if it meant embarking
442.511	on a hazardous journey
445.4	along with refugees drifting towards
445.4	Europe today through the Mediterranean.
451.034	Knowing how risky such a journey would be,
453.319	"he said, ""If I were to die on the way,"
456.463	"it doesn't matter."""
457.747	To Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.
462.294	Cluster bombs are a world problem,
465.326	as this munition keeps destroying
465.326	and hurting whole communities
470.011	for generations to come.
472.618	In an online interview with the director
472.618	of the Mines Advisory Group,
476.156	Jamie Franklin,
477.331	he said,
478.511	"""The US forces dropped over two million"
478.511	tons of munitions over Laos.
483.57	If they couldn't find
483.57	their targets in Vietnam,
486.279	there were free-drop areas in Laos
486.279	where planes would drop their loads
490.6	before going back to base,
492.619	because it's dangerous to land
492.619	"with loaded planes."""
496.653	According to the International
496.653	Committee of the Red Cross,
499.439	in Laos alone -- one of the poorest
499.439	countries in the world --
502.819	nine to 27 million unexploded
502.819	submunitions remain.
508.238	Some 11,000 people have been killed
508.238	or injured since 1973.
514.691	This lethal weapon has been used
514.691	by over 20 states during armed conflicts
519.603	in over 35 countries,
521.785	such as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.
526.403	So far, 119 states have joined
526.403	an international treaty
530.713	banning cluster bombs,
532.448	which is officially called
532.448	the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
536.417	But some of the biggest producers
536.417	of cluster munitions --
539.891	namely, the United States,
539.891	Russia and China --
543.254	remain outside of this lifesaving treaty
545.748	and continue to produce them,
547.709	reserve the right to produce
547.709	them in the future,
550.552	keep those harmful weapons
550.552	in their stockpiles
553.302	and even possibly use them in the future.
557.52	Cluster bombs have reportedly
557.52	been used most recently
561.736	in the ongoing conflicts
561.736	in Yemen and Syria.
566.122	According to research
566.122	on the worldwide investments
568.909	in cluster munitions producers
570.559	by Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,
573.38	financial institutions invested
573.38	billions of US dollars
577.28	into companies that make
577.28	cluster munitions.
580.66	The majority of these institutions
580.66	are based in countries
584.532	that have not yet signed
584.532	the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
589.114	Getting back to Mohammed,
591.165	one of the few jobs he was able
591.165	to find was picking lemons.
595.505	When I ask him if it's safe
595.505	to work in the field he said,
599.091	"""I'm not sure."""
601.021	Research shows that cluster munitions
601.021	often contaminate areas
605.715	where agriculture is the main
605.715	source of income.
610.014	According to Handicap
610.014	International's research,
	by cluster munitions are civilians.
619.479	Eighty-four percent
619.479	of casualties are males.
623.074	In countries where
623.074	these people have no choice
625.831	but to work in those fields,
627.911	they simply do it
629.591	and risk it.
631.914	Mohammed is the only male
631.914	to three sisters.
635.006	Culturally, he's expected
635.006	to provide for his family,
638.356	but he simply can't.
640.117	He tried to have so many different jobs,
642.225	but he couldn't keep any
642.225	due to his physical disability
645.815	and the less-than-friendly environment
645.815	to people with disabilities,
649.304	to say the least.
651.583	It hurts him a lot when he goes
651.583	out looking for a job,
654.935	and he's turned away
656.152	with a small amount of money
656.152	paid to him out of pity.
659.65	"He said, ""I'm not here to beg for money,"
662.405	"I just want to earn it."""
665.764	Mohammed today is 21 years old.
668.206	He's illiterate,
669.428	and he communicates with voice messages.
672.521	Here is one of his messages.
675.234	(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)
683.325	Laura Boushnak:
683.325	"He said, ""My dream is to run,"
685.924	and I'm pretty sure once I start running,
688.125	"I would never stop."""
689.659	Thank you.
690.866	(Applause)
