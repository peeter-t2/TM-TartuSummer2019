12.76	It has been 128 years
16.84	since the last country
16.84	in the world abolished slavery
21.24	and 53 years
23.68	since Martin Luther King pronounced
23.68	"his ""I Have A Dream"" speech."
29.8	But we still live in a world
32	where the color of our skin
32	not only gives a first impression,
37.88	but a lasting one that remains.
43.12	I was born in a family full of colors.
47.4	My father is the son of a maid
50.44	from whom he inherited
50.44	an intense dark chocolate tone.
56.28	He was adopted by those
56.28	who I know as my grandparents.
61	The matriarch, my grandma,
63.28	has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.
67.56	My grandpa was somewhere between
67.56	a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,
73.32	like my uncle and my cousin.
76.68	My mother is a cinnamon-skin
76.68	daughter of a native Brazilian,
83.56	with a pinch of hazel and honey,
86.92	and a man [who is]
86.92	a mix of coffee with milk,
89.88	but with a lot of coffee.
92.4	She has two sisters.
94.68	One in a toasted-peanut skin
97.6	and the other,
99.04	also adopted,
100.6	more on the beige side,
102.52	like a pancake.
103.84	(Laughter)
105.24	Growing up in this family,
108.12	color was never important for me.
111.6	Outside home, however,
111.6	things were different soon.
117.56	Color had many other meanings.
122.16	I remember my first
122.16	drawing lessons in school
125.96	as a bunch of contradictory feelings.
128.92	It was exciting and creative
131.88	but I never understood
131.88	the unique flesh-colored pencil.
137.36	I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.
140.759	My skin was brown,
140.759	and people said I was black.
144.56	I was seven years old
144.56	with a mess of colors in my head.
149.96	Later,
151.88	when I took my cousin to school,
154.4	I was usually taken for the nanny.
157.32	By helping in the kitchen
157.32	at a friend's party,
161	people thought I was the maid.
163.68	I was even treated like a prostitute
166.72	just because I was walking alone
166.72	on the beach with European friends.
171.76	And many times,
173.28	visiting my grandma or friends
173.28	in upper class buildings,
177.88	I was invited not to use
177.88	the main elevator.
182.84	Because in the end,
185.24	with this color and this hair,
187.96	I cannot belong to some places.
192.4	In some way,
193.64	I get to used to it and accept part of it.
197.2	However, something inside of me
197.2	keeps revolving and struggling.
203.2	Years later I married a Spaniard.
207.44	But not any Spaniard.
209.64	I chose one with the skin color
209.64	of a lobster when sunburnt.
213.56	(Laughter)
215.6	Since then, a new question
215.6	started to chase me.
219.96	What will be the color of your children?
223.04	As you can understand,
223.04	this is my last concern.
226.28	But thinking about it,
229	with my previous background,
230.96	my story led me to make
230.96	my personal exercise as a photographer.
237.08	And that is how Humanae was born.
240.64	Humanae is a pursuit
240.64	to highlight our true colors,
245.6	rather than the untrue
247.28	white, red, black or yellow
247.28	associated with race.
252.72	It's a kind of game to question our codes.
257.08	It's a work in progress
257.08	from a personal story to a global history.
262.16	I portray the subjects
262.16	in a white background.
267.88	Then I choose an 11-pixel
267.88	square from the nose,
272.8	paint the background,
275.2	and look for the corresponding color
275.2	in the industrial palette, Pantone.
280.48	I started with my family and friends,
283.48	then more and more people
283.48	joined the adventure,
287.4	thanks to public calls
287.4	coming through the social media.
292.44	I thought that the main space
292.44	to show my work was the Internet
297.04	because I want an open concept
297.04	that invites everybody
301.6	to push the share button
301.6	in both the computer and their brain.
308.28	The snowball started to roll.
311.88	The project had a great welcome --
315.76	invitations, exhibitions,
319.24	physical formats,
321	galleries and museums ...
323.8	just happened.
325.56	And among them, my favorite:
329.24	when Humanae occupies public spaces
333.28	and appears in the street,
336.44	it fosters a popular debate
339.84	and creates a feeling of community.
346.8	I have portrayed more than 3,000 people
350.92	in 13 different countries,
356.64	Just to mention some of them --
359.2	from someone included in the Forbes list,
361.76	to refugees who crossed
361.76	the Mediterranean by boat.
365.24	In Paris, from the UNESCO
365.24	Headquarters to a shelter.
369.68	And students both in Switzerland
369.68	and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
375.36	All kinds of beliefs,
377.36	gender identities
378.92	or physical impairments,
381.16	a newborn or terminally ill.
384.16	We all together build Humanae.
389.04	Those portraits make us rethink
389.04	how we see each other.
394.12	When modern science
394.12	is questioning the race concept,
398	what does it mean for us
398	to be black, white, yellow, red?
404.56	Is it the eye, the nose,
404.56	the mouth, the hair?
409.72	Or does it have to do with our origin,
413.08	nationality
414.36	or bank account?
418.88	This personal exercise
418.88	turned out to be a discovery.
423.64	Suddenly I realized that Humanae
423.64	was useful for many people.
429.88	It represents a sort of mirror
432.16	for those who cannot find
432.16	themselves reflected in any label.
437.32	It was amazing
438.64	that people started to share
438.64	their thoughts about the work with me.
443.08	I have hundreds of that,
445.08	I will share with you, too.
447.88	A mother of 11 years --
450.76	A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,
455.08	"""Very good for me as a tool"
455.08	to work on her confidence,
458.88	as this past weekend
460.96	one of her girlfriends argued with her
460.96	that she does not belong
465.92	and should not be allowed
465.92	to live in Norway.
470	So your work has
470	a very special place in my heart
473.96	"and it's very important for me."""
478.88	A woman shared her portrait
478.88	on Facebook and wrote,
483.64	"""All my life,"
484.88	people from across the globe
484.88	had difficulties to place me in a group,
490	a stereotype,
491.48	a box.
492.8	Perhaps we should stop.
495	Instead of framing, ask the individual,
498.16	'How would you label yourself?'
500.48	Then I would say,
502.32	'Hi. I'm Massiel.
504.36	I'm a Dominican-Dutch,
505.92	I grew up in a mixed family
507.96	"and I'm a bisexual woman.' """
511.88	Besides these unexpected
511.88	and touching reactions,
516	Humanae finds a new life
516	in a different variety of fields.
520.68	Just to show you some examples,
523.68	illustrators and art students
525.919	using it as a reference
525.919	for their sketches and their studies.
530.039	It's a collection of faces.
532.84	Researchers in the fields of anthropology,
536.8	physics and neuroscience
539.12	use Humanae with different
539.12	scientific approaches
543.28	related to human ethnicity,
545.92	optophysiology,
547.68	face recognition
549.44	or Alzheimer's.
552	One of the most important
552	impacts of the project
555.44	is that Humanae was chosen
555.44	to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,
560.12	one of the most relevant
560.12	political publications.
564.76	And talking about foreign affairs,
568.28	I found the perfect
568.28	ambassadors for my project ...
572.68	teachers.
573.92	They are the ones that use Humanae
573.92	as a tool for educational purposes.
580.88	Their passion encourages me
580.88	to go back to drawing classes,
586.36	but this time as a teacher myself.
590.2	My students,
591.68	both adults and kids,
593.96	paint their self-portraits,
596.76	trying to discover
596.76	their own unique color.
608.72	As a photographer,
610.76	I realize that I can be a channel
610.76	for others to communicate.
617.04	As an individual,
618.88	as Ang√©lica,
621.08	every time I take a picture,
624.28	I feel that I am sitting
624.28	in front of a therapist.
629.48	All the frustration, fear and loneliness
634.44	that I once felt ...
636.36	becomes love.
641.4	The last country --
644	the last country in the world
644	who abolished slavery
649.04	is the country where I was born,
651.92	Brazil.
654.44	We still have to work hard
654.44	to abolish discrimination.
660.08	That remains a common practice worldwide,
664.08	and that will not disappear by itself.
668.48	Thank you.
669.76	(Applause)
683.88	Thank you.
