25	Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
29	You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.
33	How about this word?
35	Here, I'll show it to you.
36	Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
39	"Notice -- we're very specific -- that word ""compile."""
42	The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,
45	out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
48	It's little discrete --
49	that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
53	And those bits are words.
55	Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --
59	besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,
62	like lexicographical.
65	Lexicographical has this great pattern:
67	it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,
69	I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)
72	"But ""lexicographical"" is the same pattern as ""higgledy-piggledy."""
76	Right? It's a fun word to say,
78	and I get to say it a lot.
81	Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer
84	is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
89	Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
92	But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
99	Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
102	But people think that my job is to let the good words
104	make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,
107	and keep the bad words out.
109	But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.
112	For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
116	And for another, deciding what words are good
120	and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
122	And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,
126	you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
129	So if I had to think of some kind of occupation
134	as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
140	I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English
143	and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
147	But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
152	Well, I blame the Queen.
154	Why do I blame the Queen?
156	Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
158	But secondly, I blame the Queen because
161	dictionaries have really not changed.
163	Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.
165	The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries
171	is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened
174	in American dictionaries since 1965.
176	So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
179	James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
181	I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
184	So he's really responsible for a lot of
188	what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
190	When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,
193	is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
200	And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
202	There'd be virtually no learning curve.
205	And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!
207	Computers! What about computers?
209	The thing about computers is, I love computers.
211	I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
213	I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
217	But computers don't do much else other than
219	speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
223	They don't change the end result.
227	Because what a dictionary is,
230	is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
233	It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
239	You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
242	The design has not changed.
245	And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
247	Online dictionaries must be different.
250	This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
252	This is my favorite word, by the way.
253	Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
258	Very useful word. So, look at that.
264	Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
266	This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
271	Right? Those little buttons,
273	I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
276	So there's not very much going on here.
278	There's not a lot of clickiness.
280	And in fact, online dictionaries replicate
283	almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
286	And when you improve searchability,
288	you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
291	Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,
294	because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
297	So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,
306	what we have here is a ham butt problem.
309	Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
311	Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
313	She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,
315	and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,
316	"""This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"""
318	"She thought, ""Well, my mom always did this."""
320	So she calls up mom, and she says,
321	"""Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"""
323	"She says, ""I don't know, my mom always did it!"""
326	So they call grandma, and grandma says,
328	"""My pan was too small!"" (Laughter)"
332	So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
336	We have a pan that's too small!
339	You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
341	The bad words -- see, when people think about a place
344	and they don't find a place on the map,
346	"they think, ""This map sucks!"""
348	When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,
350	"they're like, ""Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."""
353	When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,
356	"""This must be a bad word."" Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary."
361	Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
366	So, you can't get a smaller ham.
369	The English language is as big as it is.
372	So, if you have a ham butt problem,
374	and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,
376	the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:
381	paper is the enemy of words.
384	How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
388	Some of my best friends are books.
390	But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
395	"Now they're going to think ""Oh, boy."
397	"People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"""
400	No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
402	When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,
406	we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
409	You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,
411	but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
414	The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape
417	dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be
419	the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
423	So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,
427	artificial constraints lead to
431	arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
435	What if biologists could only study animals
438	"that made people go, ""Aww."" Right?"
440	What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,
442	and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
447	We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,
451	and not very much about much else.
453	And I think this is a problem.
455	I think we should study all the words,
457	because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions
462	from very humble parts.
466	Lexicography is really more about material science.
470	We are studying the tolerances of the materials
473	that you use to build the structure of your expression:
476	your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,
483	"""Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"""
488	"They think, ""OK, if we think words are the tools"
495	that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,
497	how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
500	"How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"""
503	They're just the right tools for the job.
506	"And so people say to me, ""How do I know if a word is real?"""
509	You know, anybody who's read a children's book
512	knows that love makes things real.
516	If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
521	Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
524	It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
527	If you love a word, it becomes real.
531	So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,
534	if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less
539	about control and more about description,
543	then we can think of the English language
545	as being this beautiful mobile.
548	And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,
550	is touched, any time you touch a word,
553	you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,
555	you verb it, you make the mobile move.
558	You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,
562	and that new position can be just as beautiful.
565	Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --
569	the problem with being a traffic cop is
571	there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,
574	or the cars get confused. Right?
577	But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,
580	but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
584	You can ask for help!
586	If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
590	Library of Congress: 17 million books,
593	of which half are in English.
596	If only one out of every 10 of those books
600	had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,
602	that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
605	And I find an un-dictionaried word --
608	"a word like ""un-dictionaried,"" for example --"
610	in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
615	Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,
625	of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,
628	it would be an entire other OED.
631	That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
636	And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --
639	and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week
641	than I do Newsweek or Time.
643	There's a lot going on there.
645	And I'm not even talking about polysemy,
647	which is the greedy habit some words have of taking
650	more than one meaning for themselves.
655	"So if you think of the word ""set,"" a set can be a badger's burrow,"
659	a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,
662	and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
664	The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
667	Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
670	"One of them is just labeled ""miscellaneous technical senses."""
675	Do you know what that says to me?
676	That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)
681	That's a lexicographical cop out,
683	"to say, ""miscellaneous technical senses."""
685	So, we have all these words, and we really need help!
689	And the thing is, we could ask for help --
692	asking for help's not that hard.
693	I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
696	See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,
699	and this is more of a visual explanation.
701	If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,
704	these bright spots are what we know about,
706	and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
709	If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
714	And we don't even know the shape of the language.
717	If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --
720	look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,
723	but there's no California!
726	We're missing California from American English.
729	We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
734	We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
736	So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
739	But even if it were, rocket science is being done
742	by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
746	It can't be that hard to find some words!
750	So, enough scientists in other disciplines
753	are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
756	For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers
758	can upload information about their bird sightings.
760	And then, ornithologists can go
762	and help track populations, migrations, etc.
765	And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
768	He's a director of an electroplating company.
772	He's found more than 140 comets.
775	He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
778	It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
779	I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
781	But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
785	He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,
788	and that's how he found them.
790	If we can find comets without a telescope,
794	shouldn't we be able to find words?
796	Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
798	Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
801	And the Internet is great for collecting words,
803	because the Internet's full of collectors.
804	And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,
807	but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
810	And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be
815	the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
818	So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,
822	but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
824	They show the word, but they don't show any context.
827	Where did it come from? Who said it?
829	What newspaper was it in? What book?
831	Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.
835	If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,
838	it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
841	So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
844	You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
848	It dies too fast.
849	So, this whole time I've been saying,
853	"""The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."""
855	"Not ""a dictionary,"" or ""dictionaries."" And that's because,"
858	well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
861	They use it synecdochically.
864	"And one of the problems of knowing a word like ""synecdochically"""
867	"is that you really want an excuse to say ""synecdochically."""
870	This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point
872	"where I could say ""synecdochically"" to all of you."
874	So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --
877	like the dictionary is a part of the language,
879	or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --
884	then you're using it synecdochically.
888	But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
892	If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
896	We can put in all the meanings.
900	Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
904	And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --
908	we can make it be the whole language.
911	You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,
913	who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember
916	that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
921	This is what dictionaries used to look like.
923	I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
925	It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
929	It wasn't really what people needed.
932	And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,
935	no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,
939	we can really describe the language like scientists.
942	We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
944	If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,
948	and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
953	Thank you very much for your kind attention.
