12.738	If you remember that first decade of the web,
14.735	it was really a static place.
16.99	You could go online, you could look at pages,
19.235	and they were put up either by organizations
21.748	who had teams to do it
23.269	or by individuals who were really tech-savvy
25.498	for the time.
27.235	And with the rise of social media
28.81	and social networks in the early 2000s,
31.209	the web was completely changed
33.358	to a place where now the vast majority of content
36.966	we interact with is put up by average users,
40.278	either in YouTube videos or blog posts
42.975	or product reviews or social media postings.
46.29	And it's also become a much more interactive place,
48.637	where people are interacting with others,
51.274	they're commenting, they're sharing,
52.97	they're not just reading.
54.584	So Facebook is not the only place you can do this,
56.45	but it's the biggest,
57.548	and it serves to illustrate the numbers.
59.332	Facebook has 1.2 billion users per month.
62.809	So half the Earth's Internet population
64.739	is using Facebook.
66.392	They are a site, along with others,
68.324	that has allowed people to create an online persona
71.543	with very little technical skill,
73.325	and people responded by putting huge amounts
75.801	of personal data online.
77.784	So the result is that we have behavioral,
80.327	preference, demographic data
82.313	for hundreds of millions of people,
84.414	which is unprecedented in history.
86.44	And as a computer scientist, 
86.44	what this means is that
89	I've been able to build models
90.664	that can predict all sorts of hidden attributes
92.986	for all of you that you don't even know
95.27	you're sharing information about.
97.472	As scientists, we use that to help
99.854	the way people interact online,
101.968	but there's less altruistic applications,
104.467	and there's a problem in that users don't really
106.848	understand these techniques and how they work,
109.318	and even if they did, they don't
109.318	have a lot of control over it.
112.446	So what I want to talk to you about today
113.936	is some of these things that we're able to do,
116.638	and then give us some ideas
116.638	of how we might go forward
119.401	to move some control back into the hands of users.
122.17	So this is Target, the company.
123.756	I didn't just put that logo
125.08	on this poor, pregnant woman's belly.
127.25	You may have seen this anecdote that was printed
129.09	in Forbes magazine where Target
131.151	sent a flyer to this 15-year-old girl
133.512	with advertisements and coupons
135.222	for baby bottles and diapers and cribs
137.776	two weeks before she told her parents
139.46	that she was pregnant.
141.324	Yeah, the dad was really upset.
144.028	"He said, ""How did Target figure out"
145.744	that this high school girl was pregnant
147.568	"before she told her parents?"""
149.528	It turns out that they have the purchase history
152.149	for hundreds of thousands of customers
154.45	and they compute what they 
154.45	call a pregnancy score,
157.18	which is not just whether or 
157.18	not a woman's pregnant,
159.512	but what her due date is.
161.242	And they compute that
162.546	not by looking at the obvious things,
164.314	like, she's buying a crib or baby clothes,
166.826	but things like, she bought more vitamins
169.769	than she normally had,
171.486	or she bought a handbag
172.95	that's big enough to hold diapers.
174.661	And by themselves, those purchases don't seem
176.571	like they might reveal a lot,
179.04	but it's a pattern of behavior that,
181.018	when you take it in the context 
181.018	of thousands of other people,
184.135	starts to actually reveal some insights.
186.892	So that's the kind of thing that we do
188.685	when we're predicting stuff
188.685	about you on social media.
191.252	We're looking for little
191.252	patterns of behavior that,
194.048	when you detect them among millions of people,
196.73	lets us find out all kinds of things.
199.436	So in my lab and with colleagues,
201.183	we've developed mechanisms where we can
202.96	quite accurately predict things
204.52	like your political preference,
206.245	your personality score, gender, sexual orientation,
209.997	religion, age, intelligence,
212.87	along with things like
214.264	how much you trust the people you know
216.201	and how strong those relationships are.
218.005	We can do all of this really well.
219.79	And again, it doesn't come from what you might
221.987	think of as obvious information.
224.089	So my favorite example is from this study
226.37	that was published this year
227.61	in the Proceedings of the National Academies.
229.405	If you Google this, you'll find it.
230.69	It's four pages, easy to read.
232.562	And they looked at just people's Facebook likes,
235.565	so just the things you like on Facebook,
237.485	and used that to predict all these attributes,
239.623	along with some other ones.
241.268	And in their paper they listed the five likes
244.229	that were most indicative of high intelligence.
247.016	And among those was liking a page
249.34	for curly fries. (Laughter)
251.245	Curly fries are delicious,
253.338	but liking them does not necessarily mean
255.868	that you're smarter than the average person.
257.948	So how is it that one of the strongest indicators
261.155	of your intelligence
262.725	is liking this page
264.172	when the content is totally irrelevant
266.424	to the attribute that's being predicted?
268.951	And it turns out that we have to look at
270.535	a whole bunch of underlying theories
272.153	to see why we're able to do this.
274.722	One of them is a sociological
274.722	theory called homophily,
277.635	which basically says people are
277.635	friends with people like them.
280.727	So if you're smart, you tend to
280.727	be friends with smart people,
282.741	and if you're young, you tend
282.741	to be friends with young people,
285.371	and this is well established
286.998	for hundreds of years.
288.743	We also know a lot
289.975	about how information spreads through networks.
292.525	It turns out things like viral videos
294.279	or Facebook likes or other information
296.685	spreads in exactly the same way
298.573	that diseases spread through social networks.
301.027	So this is something we've studied for a long time.
302.818	We have good models of it.
304.394	And so you can put those things together
306.551	and start seeing why things like this happen.
309.639	So if I were to give you a hypothesis,
311.453	it would be that a smart guy started this page,
314.68	or maybe one of the first people who liked it
316.619	would have scored high on that test.
318.355	And they liked it, and their friends saw it,
320.643	and by homophily, we know that
320.643	he probably had smart friends,
323.765	and so it spread to them, 
323.765	and some of them liked it,
326.821	and they had smart friends,
328.01	and so it spread to them,
328.817	and so it propagated through the network
330.79	to a host of smart people,
333.359	so that by the end, the action
335.415	of liking the curly fries page
337.959	is indicative of high intelligence,
339.574	not because of the content,
341.377	but because the actual action of liking
343.899	reflects back the common attributes
345.799	of other people who have done it.
348.267	So this is pretty complicated stuff, right?
351.164	It's a hard thing to sit down and explain
353.363	to an average user, and even if you do,
356.211	what can the average user do about it?
358.399	How do you know that 
358.399	you've liked something
360.447	that indicates a trait for you
361.939	that's totally irrelevant to the
361.939	content of what you've liked?
365.484	There's a lot of power that users don't have
368.03	to control how this data is used.
370.26	And I see that as a real 
370.26	problem going forward.
373.372	So I think there's a couple paths
375.349	that we want to look at
376.35	if we want to give users some control
378.26	over how this data is used,
380	because it's not always going to be used
381.94	for their benefit.
383.321	An example I often give is that,
384.743	if I ever get bored being a professor,
386.389	I'm going to go start a company
388.042	that predicts all of these attributes
389.496	and things like how well you work in teams
391.098	and if you're a drug user, if you're an alcoholic.
393.769	We know how to predict all that.
395.209	And I'm going to sell reports
396.97	to H.R. companies and big businesses
399.07	that want to hire you.
401.343	We totally can do that now.
402.52	I could start that business tomorrow,
404.308	and you would have
404.308	absolutely no control
406.36	over me using your data like that.
408.498	That seems to me to be a problem.
410.79	So one of the paths we can go down
412.7	is the policy and law path.
414.732	And in some respects, I think
414.732	that that would be most effective,
417.778	but the problem is we'd
417.778	actually have to do it.
420.534	Observing our political process in action
423.314	makes me think it's highly unlikely
425.693	that we're going to get a bunch of representatives
427.29	to sit down, learn about this,
429.276	and then enact sweeping changes
431.382	to intellectual property law in the U.S.
433.539	so users control their data.
436	We could go the policy route,
437.304	where social media companies say,
438.783	you know what? You own your data.
440.185	You have total control over how it's used.
442.674	The problem is that the revenue models
444.522	for most social media companies
446.246	rely on sharing or exploiting 
446.246	users' data in some way.
450.277	It's sometimes said of Facebook that the users
452.11	aren't the customer, they're the product.
454.638	And so how do you get a company
457.352	to cede control of their main asset
459.91	back to the users?
461.159	It's possible, but I don't think it's something
462.86	that we're going to see change quickly.
465.18	So I think the other path
466.68	that we can go down that's
466.68	going to be more effective
468.968	is one of more science.
470.476	It's doing science that allowed us to develop
472.986	all these mechanisms for computing
474.736	this personal data in the first place.
476.788	And it's actually very similar research
478.894	that we'd have to do
480.332	if we want to develop mechanisms
482.718	that can say to a user,
484.139	"""Here's the risk of that action you just took."""
486.368	By liking that Facebook page,
488.448	or by sharing this piece of personal information,
490.983	you've now improved my ability
492.485	to predict whether or not you're using drugs
494.571	or whether or not you get
494.571	along well in the workplace.
497.433	And that, I think, can affect whether or not
499.281	people want to share something,
500.791	keep it private, or just keep it offline altogether.
504.03	We can also look at things like
505.593	allowing people to encrypt data that they upload,
508.321	so it's kind of invisible and worthless
510.176	to sites like Facebook
511.607	or third party services that access it,
514.236	but that select users who the person who posted it
517.483	want to see it have access to see it.
520.153	This is all super exciting research
522.319	from an intellectual perspective,
523.939	and so scientists are going to be willing to do it.
525.798	So that gives us an advantage over the law side.
529.408	One of the problems that people bring up
531.133	when I talk about this is, they say,
532.728	you know, if people start
532.728	keeping all this data private,
535.374	all those methods that you've been developing
537.487	to predict their traits are going to fail.
540.14	And I say, absolutely, and for me, that's success,
543.66	because as a scientist,
545.446	my goal is not to infer information about users,
549.134	it's to improve the way people interact online.
551.901	And sometimes that involves
551.901	inferring things about them,
555.119	but if users don't want me to use that data,
558.141	I think they should have the right to do that.
560.179	I want users to be informed and consenting
562.83	users of the tools that we develop.
564.942	And so I think encouraging this kind of science
567.894	and supporting researchers
569.24	who want to cede some of that control back to users
572.263	and away from the social media companies
574.574	means that going forward, as these tools evolve
577.245	and advance,
578.721	means that we're going to have an educated
580.135	and empowered user base,
581.829	and I think all of us can agree
582.929	that that's a pretty ideal way to go forward.
585.493	Thank you.
587.677	(Applause)
