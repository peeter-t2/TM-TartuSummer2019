12	I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,
17	and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of
20	as being one that is grounded in compassion.
24	The truth of the matter is otherwise.
26	Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,
32	and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,
36	"the saying of ""In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"""
42	or, as Sir Richard Burton --
44	not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,
47	but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that
50	and who was a worldwide traveler
52	and translator of many works of literature --
56	"translates it. ""In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."""
63	And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,
70	God says to his prophet Muhammad --
73	whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,
76	beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,
82	including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --
86	"that, ""We have not sent you, O Muhammad,"
89	"except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."""
95	For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,
99	whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
104	is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.
108	And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,
110	"""Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."""
115	And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --
121	"in fact, the Koran says that ""God decreed upon himself compassion,"""
126	"or, ""reigned himself in by compassion"" --"
130	therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
137	activators of compassion, actors of compassion
141	and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.
145	That is all well and good,
148	but where do we go wrong,
151	and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
156	For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.
161	In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,
168	or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
173	"The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or ""tasawwuf"" in Arabic."
181	And these doctors or these masters,
184	these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,
188	refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
192	that teach us where the source of our problems lies.
196	In one of the battles that the prophet waged,
200	"he told his followers, ""We are returning from the lesser war"
205	"to the greater war, to the greater battle."""
209	"And they said, ""Messenger of God, we are battle-weary."
214	"How can we go to a greater battle?"""
217	"He said, ""That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."""
225	"The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, ""I."""
234	The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,
240	has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,
246	and he knocks on the door,
249	"and a voice answers, ""Who's there?"""
252	"""It's me,"" or, more grammatically correctly, ""It is I,"""
257	as we might say in English.
259	"The voice says, ""Go away."""
262	After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,
270	he comes back.
272	With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.
276	"The voice asks, ""Who is there?"""
279	"He said, ""It is you, O heartbreaker."""
283	The door swings open, and the voice says,
287	"""Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"""
294	"-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- ""for two egos."""
298	And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.
307	"In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one ""I,"""
313	"and that is the ""I"" of divinity."
318	"In a teaching -- called a ""hadith qudsi"" in our tradition --"
322	"God says that, ""My servant,"" or ""My creature, my human creature,"
328	does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me
334	"than what I have asked them to do."""
337	And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
341	You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,
345	and if they've done that, then they can do extra.
347	But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
350	"""And,"" God says, ""my servant continues to get nearer to me,"
356	"by doing more of what I've asked them to do"" --"
359	extra credit, we might call it --
361	"""until I love him or love her."
365	"And when I love my servant,"" God says,"
368	"""I become the eyes by which he or she sees,"
374	the ears by which he or she listens,
380	the hand by which he or she grasps,
385	and the foot by which he or she walks,
389	"and the heart by which he or she understands."""
394	It is this merging of our self with divinity
399	that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
407	Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,
413	the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
420	"When he says, ""I am the spirit, and I am the way,"""
424	"and when the prophet Muhammad said, ""Whoever has seen me has seen God,"""
429	it is because they became so much an instrument of God,
434	they became part of God's team --
436	so that God's will was manifest through them,
440	and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
444	Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
451	All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,
456	get our egotism out of the way.
459	I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,
467	have had what you might call a spiritual experience,
471	a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,
478	the boundaries of your ego dissolved.
484	And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --
491	one with that jug of water, one with every human being,
497	one with the Creator --
501	and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,
506	of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy
510	that you have ever experienced in your lives.
514	That is a moment which is a gift of God to us --
520	a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary
524	"which makes us insist on ""I, I, I, me, me, me,"""
530	and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,
534	"we say, ""Oh, this is all you."
540	This is all you. And this is all us.
542	And us, and I, and us are all part of you.
548	O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being
554	and the end of our journey,
556	you are also the breaker of our hearts.
561	You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,
567	and for whose purpose we shall die,
571	and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
575	"to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."""
582	Our message today, and our purpose today,
586	and those of you who are here today,
589	and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
594	For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,
602	because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
610	We know it all.
613	We have access to it all.
615	"Jung may have called it ""the subconscious."""
619	Through our subconscious, in your dreams --
623	"the Koran calls our state of sleep ""the lesser death,"""
631	"""the temporary death"" --"
635	in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,
640	we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,
646	and we see wonderful things.
649	We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,
654	and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
658	But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator
668	whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
674	God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,
681	whatever the name might be through which you name
684	or access the presence of divinity,
688	it is the locus of absolute being,
694	absolute love and mercy and compassion,
698	and absolute knowledge and wisdom,
701	"what Hindus call ""satchidananda."""
704	The language differs,
707	but the objective is the same.
711	Rumi has another story
713	about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --
716	and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
720	One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --
723	one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
728	And they have a fight and an argument because
731	"-- ""I want grapes."" ""I want eneb. ""I want angur."" --"
735	not knowing that the word that they're using
738	refers to the same reality in different languages.
741	There's only one absolute reality by definition,
747	one absolute being by definition,
750	because absolute is, by definition, single,
753	and absolute and singular.
756	There's this absolute concentration of being,
759	the absolute concentration of consciousness,
762	awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love
772	that defines the primary attributes of divinity.
776	And these should also be
779	the primary attributes of what it means to be human.
784	For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,
790	is our physiology,
793	but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
801	And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,
805	"""When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,"
809	and breathed into him of my spirit,
813	"then, fall in prostration to him."""
817	The angels prostrate, not before the human body,
825	but before the human soul.
828	Why? Because the soul, the human soul,
832	embodies a piece of the divine breath,
838	a piece of the divine soul.
841	This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary
846	when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
852	What is the imagery of God?
854	The imagery of God is absolute being,
858	absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom
861	and absolute compassion and love.
864	And therefore, for us to be human --
868	in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,
872	in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --
875	means that we too have to be proper stewards
881	of the breath of divinity within us,
885	and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,
890	of being alive, of beingness;
893	the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;
898	and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.
903	This is what I understand from my faith tradition,
909	and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,
916	and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,
922	and when we stand on this platform as such,
925	I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
931	And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge
937	and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,
941	we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
947	For he foretold of a period
951	when people shall transform their swords into plowshares
958	and will not learn war or make war anymore.
964	We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:
970	we must, we must lower our egos,
979	control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,
984	family ego, national ego --
990	and let all be for the glorification of the one.
995	Thank you, and God bless you.
997	(Applause)
