12.965	I could never have imagined
15.531	that a 19-year-old suicide bomber
19.507	would actually teach me a valuable lesson.
24.64	But he did.
26.64	He taught me to never presume anything
31.283	about anyone you don't know.
36.414	On a Thursday morning in July 2005,
40.567	the bomber and I, unknowingly,
43.649	boarded the same train carriage
43.649	at the same time,
48.22	standing, apparently, just feet apart.
54.345	I didn't see him.
56.185	Actually, I didn't see anyone.
58	You know not to look
58	at anyone on the Tube,
60.611	but I guess he saw me.
64.916	I guess he looked at all of us,
68.687	as his hand hovered
68.687	over the detonation switch.
74.439	I've often wondered: What was he thinking?
78.908	Especially in those final seconds.
84.765	I know it wasn't personal.
86.977	He didn't set out to kill
86.977	or maim me, Gill Hicks.
91.018	I mean -- he didn't know me.
93.758	No.
95.666	Instead, he gave me
98.636	an unwarranted and an unwanted label.
104.272	I had become the enemy.
109.39	"To him, I was the ""other,"""
112.99	"the ""them,"" as opposed to ""us."""
117.581	"The label ""enemy"" allowed him"
117.581	to dehumanize us.
123.674	It allowed him to push that button.
127.339	And he wasn't selective.
130.875	Twenty-six precious lives were taken
130.875	in my carriage alone,
137.042	and I was almost one of them.
140.855	In the time it takes to draw a breath,
143.62	we were plunged into a darkness so immense
147.314	that it was almost tangible;
149.72	what I imagine wading
149.72	through tar might be like.
155.398	We didn't know we were the enemy.
158.321	We were just a bunch of commuters
158.321	who, minutes earlier,
162.403	had followed the Tube etiquette:
164.911	no direct eye contact,
167.141	no talking
168.894	and absolutely no conversation.
173.948	But in the lifting of the darkness,
177.776	we were reaching out.
180.179	We were helping each other.
182.808	We were calling out our names,
185.293	a little bit like a roll call,
188.389	waiting for responses.
192.559	"""I'm Gill. I'm here."
197.111	I'm alive.
200.279	"OK."""
203.697	"""I'm Gill."
205.679	Here.
208.318	Alive.
211.329	"OK."""
215.096	I didn't know Alison.
218.399	But I listened for her check-ins
218.399	every few minutes.
223.34	I didn't know Richard.
225.839	But it mattered to me that he survived.
230.752	All I shared with them
232.57	was my first name.
235.013	They didn't know
236.188	that I was a head of a department
236.188	at the Design Council.
241.185	And here is my beloved briefcase,
244.766	also rescued from that morning.
248.479	They didn't know that I published
248.479	architecture and design journals,
252.469	that I was a Fellow
252.469	of the Royal Society of Arts,
255.809	that I wore black --
258.695	still do --
260.566	that I smoked cigarillos.
263.888	I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.
266.215	I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,
270.423	of course, never dreaming
270.423	that one day I would be standing,
277.593	balancing on prosthetic legs,
280.512	giving a talk.
282.651	I was a young Australian woman
282.651	doing extraordinary things in London.
288.319	And I wasn't ready for that all to end.
292.882	I was so determined to survive
296.064	that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets
296.064	around the tops of my legs,
301.29	and I just shut everything
301.29	and everyone out,
307.345	to focus, to listen to myself,
310.629	to be guided by instinct alone.
315.085	I lowered my breathing rate.
317.847	I elevated my thighs.
319.651	I held myself upright
321.343	and I fought the urge to close my eyes.
326.681	I held on for almost an hour,
331.03	an hour to contemplate
331.03	the whole of my life
335.435	up until this point.
339.199	Perhaps I should have done more.
343.223	Perhaps I could have
343.223	lived more, seen more.
346.451	Maybe I should have gone running,
346.451	dancing, taken up yoga.
352.317	But my priority and my focus
352.317	was always my work.
357.279	I lived to work.
359.73	Who I was on my business card
362.561	mattered to me.
365.688	But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.
371.226	By the time I felt that first touch
375.72	from one of my rescuers,
378.472	I was unable to speak,
380.613	unable to say even
380.613	"a small word, like ""Gill."""
387.183	I surrendered my body to them.
389.942	I had done all I possibly could,
392.839	and now I was in their hands.
399.091	I understood
401.283	just who and what humanity really is,
407.972	when I first saw the ID tag
411.195	that was given to me
411.195	when I was admitted to hospital.
414.478	And it read:
416.218	"""One unknown estimated female."""
423.162	One unknown estimated female.
429.004	Those four words were my gift.
433.125	What they told me very clearly
435.896	was that my life was saved,
438.625	purely because I was a human being.
442.61	Difference of any kind made no difference
446.818	to the extraordinary lengths
446.818	that the rescuers were prepared to go
452.129	to save my life,
454.458	to save as many unknowns as they could,
457.205	and putting their own lives at risk.
460.405	To them, it didn't matter
460.405	if I was rich or poor,
465.298	the color of my skin,
467.463	whether I was male or female,
469.049	my sexual orientation,
471.613	who I voted for,
473.24	whether I was educated,
474.782	if I had a faith or no faith at all.
479.409	Nothing mattered
481.377	other than I was a precious human life.
487.881	I see myself as a living fact.
492.223	I am proof
494.276	that unconditional love and respect
494.276	can not only save,
501.028	but it can transform lives.
505.226	Here is a wonderful image
505.226	of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I
509.718	taken just last year.
512.08	Ten years after the event,
514.665	and here we are, arm in arm.
519.559	Throughout all the chaos,
521.701	my hand was held tightly.
525.2	My face was stroked gently.
529.161	What did I feel?
531.541	I felt loved.
533.685	What's shielded me from hatred
533.685	and wanting retribution,
538.526	what's given me the courage to say:
541.539	this ends with me
546.006	is love.
548.585	I was loved.
553.234	I believe the potential
553.234	for widespread positive change
559.523	is absolutely enormous
561.127	because I know what we're capable of.
564.055	I know the brilliance of humanity.
567.93	So this leaves me with some
567.93	pretty big things to ponder
571.864	and some questions for us all to consider:
576.512	Is what unites us not far greater
576.512	than what can ever divide?
583.663	Does it have to take
583.663	a tragedy or a disaster
587.477	for us to feel deeply
587.477	connected as one species,
592.902	as human beings?
595.755	And when will we embrace
595.755	the wisdom of our era
601.764	to rise above mere tolerance
605.931	and move to an acceptance
608.892	for all who are only a label
608.892	until we know them?
615.55	Thank you.
616.734	(Applause)
