12.68	Today I wanted to --
12.68	well, this morning --
15.929	I want to talk about the future
15.929	of human-driven transportation;
21.56	about how we can cut congestion,
21.56	pollution and parking
27.64	by getting more people into fewer cars;
31.84	and how we can do it
31.84	with the technology that's in our pockets.
37.84	And yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...
40.72	not self-driving cars.
43.12	But to get started we've got
43.12	to go back over 100 years.
48.8	Because it turns out
48.8	there was an Uber way before Uber.
55.48	And if it had survived,
57.36	the future of transportation
57.36	would probably already be here.
63.48	So let me introduce you to the jitney.
66.96	In 1914 it was created or invented
66.96	by a guy named LP Draper.
72.88	He was a car salesman from LA,
72.88	and he had an idea.
76.16	Well, he was cruising around
76.16	downtown Los Angeles,
78.68	my hometown,
80.08	and he saw trolleys
81.44	with long lines of people trying
81.44	to get to where they wanted to go.
86.4	He said, well, why don't
86.4	I just put a sign on my car
89.72	that takes people wherever
89.72	they want to go for a jitney --
92.68	that was slang for a nickel.
94.88	And so people jumped on board,
97.28	and not just in Los Angeles
97.28	but across the country.
100.68	And within one year,
101.92	by 1915,
104.2	there were 50,000
104.2	rides per day in Seattle,
111	and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
114.72	To give you some perspective,
117.36	Uber in Los Angeles
119.76	is doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...
129.56	And so these are the trolley guys,
131.68	the existing transportation
131.68	monopoly at the time.
134.44	They were clearly not happy
134.44	about the jitney juggernaut.
138.44	And so they got to work
140.479	and they went to cities across the country
143.12	and got regulations put in place
143.12	to slow down the growth of the jitney.
148.52	And there were all kinds of regulations.
151.04	There were licenses --
151.04	often they were pricey.
153.32	In some cities,
154.76	if you were a jitney driver,
156.16	you were required to be
156.16	in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
160.88	In other cities,
162.28	they required two jitney
162.28	drivers for one jitney.
165.76	But there was a really
165.76	interesting regulation
168.04	which was they had to
168.04	put a backseat light --
171.92	install it in every Jitney --
173.84	to stop a new pernicious innovation
173.84	which they called spooning.
177.8	(Laughter)
179.04	All right. So what happened?
181.24	Well, within a year
181.24	this thing had taken off.
184.36	But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated
184.36	completely out of existence.
190.88	That's unfortunate ...
193.2	because, well, when you can't share a car,
193.2	then you have to own one.
197.72	And car ownership skyrocketed
199.76	and it's no wonder that by 2007,
203.32	there was a car for every man,
203.32	woman and child in the United States.
207.48	And that phenomenon had gone global.
210.28	In China by 2011,
213.48	there were more car sales
213.48	happening in China than in the US.
217.4	Now, all this private ownership
217.4	of course had a public cost.
221.28	In the US, we spend
221.28	7 billion hours a year,
226.16	wasted, sitting in traffic.
232.24	of course also sitting in traffic,
234	and one-fifth of all
234	of our carbon footprint
237.96	is spewed out in the air
237.96	by those cars that we're sitting in.
242.24	Now, that's only four percent
242.24	of our problem though.
245.24	Because if you have to own a car
247.48	then that means 96 percent of the time
247.48	your car is sitting idle.
251.36	And so, up to 30 percent
251.36	of our land and our space
255.6	is used storing these hunks of steel.
258.92	We even have skyscrapers built for cars.
263.88	That's the world we live in today.
267.72	Now, cities have been dealing
267.72	with this problem for decades.
271.399	It's called mass transit.
273.079	And even in a city like New York City,
275.64	one of the most densely
275.64	populated in the world
277.88	and one of the most sophisticated
277.88	mass transit systems in the world,
281.56	there are still 2.5 million cars
281.56	that go over those bridges every day.
288.48	Why is that?
290.44	Well, it's because mass transit
290.44	hasn't yet figured out
295.32	how to get to everybody's doorstep.
298.92	And so back in San Francisco,
298.92	where I live,
301.52	the situation's much worse,
302.88	in fact, much worse around the world.
306	And so the beginning
306	of Uber in 2010 was --
309.48	well, we just wanted
309.48	to push a button and get a ride.
312	We didn't have any grand ambitions.
314.32	But it just turned out
315.68	that lots of people wanted
315.68	to push a button and get a ride,
318.6	and ultimately what we started to see
318.6	was a lot of duplicate rides.
324.36	We saw a lot of people
326.16	pushing the same button at the same time
329.2	going essentially to the same place.
331.68	And so we started thinking about,
333.28	well, how do we make those two trips
333.28	and turn them into one.
337.84	Because if we did,
337.84	that ride would be a lot cheaper --
341.2	up to 50 percent cheaper --
343.16	and of course for the city
344.44	you've got a lot more people
344.44	and a lot fewer cars.
347.52	And so the big question for us was:
349.92	would it work?
351.24	Could you have a cheaper ride
354.64	cheap enough that people
354.64	would be willing to share it?
358.36	And the answer, fortunately,
358.36	is a resounding yes.
362.08	In San Francisco,
363.8	before uberPOOL, we had --
366.48	well, everybody would take their car
366.48	wherever the heck they wanted.
369.88	And the bright colors
369.88	is where we have the most cars.
372.88	And once we introduced uberPOOL,
375.04	well, you see there's not
375.04	as many bright colors.
378.4	More people getting around
378.4	the city in fewer cars,
382.36	taking cars off the road.
384.44	It looks like uberPOOL is working.
387.24	And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles
390.64	eight months ago.
392.56	And since then, we've taken
392.56	7.9 million miles off the roads
398.12	and we've taken 1.4 thousand
398.12	metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
405.4	But the part that I'm really --
407.24	(Applause)
411.52	But my favorite statistic --
414	remember, I'm from LA,
415.28	I spent years of my life
416.56	sitting behind the wheel,
416.56	"going, ""How do we fix this?"" --"
419.92	my favorite part
419.92	is that eight months later,
423.68	we have added 100,000 new people
423.68	that are carpooling every week.
430.2	Now, in China everything is supersized,
433.72	and so we're doing 15 million
433.72	uberPOOL trips per month,
438.12	that's 500,000 per day.
440.2	And of course we're seeing
440.2	that exponential growth happen.
443.2	In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.
445.32	And when I talk to my team,
445.32	we don't talk about,
447.72	"""Hey, well, 100,000 people"
447.72	"carpooling every week and we're done."""
454.4	How do we get that to a million?
456.68	And in China, well,
456.68	that could be several million.
459.8	And so uberPOOL is a very great
459.8	solution for urban carpooling.
465.96	But what about the suburbs?
467.92	This is the street
467.92	where I grew up in Los Angeles,
470.32	it's actually a suburb
470.32	called Northridge, California,
472.85	and, well --
474.16	look, those mailboxes,
474.16	they kind of just go on forever.
478.6	And every morning at about the same time,
481.84	cars roll of out their driveway,
483.76	most of them, one person in the car,
487.96	and they go to work,
487.96	they go to their place of work.
491.6	So the question for us is:
492.88	well, how do we turn
495.32	all of these commuter cars --
497.16	and literally there's
497.16	tens of millions of them --
501.08	how do we turn all these
501.08	commuter cars into shared cars?
505.04	Well, we have something for this that we
505.04	recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.
509.64	You get up in the morning,
509.64	get ready for work, get your coffee,
512.617	go to your car
513.92	and you light up the Uber app,
515.96	and all of a sudden,
517.48	you become an Uber driver.
520.36	And we'll match you up
520.36	with one of your neighbors
522.76	on your way to work
524.679	and it's a really great thing.
527	There's just one hitch ...
530.08	it's called regulation.
532.44	So 54 cents a mile, what is that?
534.679	Well, that is what the US government
536.76	has determined that the cost
536.76	of owning a car is per mile.
541.72	You can pick up anybody
541.72	in the United States
544.72	and take them wherever they want to go
544.72	at a moment's notice,
548.32	for 54 cents a mile or less.
550.84	But if you charge 60 cents a mile,
550.84	you're a criminal.
554.96	But what if for 60 cents a mile
557.08	we could get half a million more people
557.08	carpooling in Los Angeles?
561.68	And what if at 60 cents a mile
564.24	we could get 50 million people
564.24	carpooling in the United States?
568.96	If we could,
570.24	it's obviously something we should do.
573.12	And so it goes back
573.12	to the lesson of the jitney.
576.32	If by 1915 this thing was taking off,
580.08	imagine without
580.08	the regulations that happened,
583.6	if that thing could just keep going.
586.16	How would our cities be different today?
589.04	Would we have parks
589.04	in the place of parking lots?
592.76	Well, we lost that chance.
594.68	But technology has given us
594.68	another opportunity.
597.76	Now, I'm as excited as anybody else
597.76	about self-driving cars
602.96	but do we have to really wait
602.96	five, 10 or even 20 years
607.4	to make our new cities a reality?
611.4	With the technology in our pockets today,
614.4	and a little smart regulation,
616.92	we can turn every car into a shared car,
621.36	and we can reclaim our cities
621.36	starting today.
625.56	Thank you.
626.8	(Applause)
635.916	Chris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
637.56	Travis Kalanick: Thank you.
638.87	CA: You know -- I mean the company
638.87	you've built is absolutely astounding.
643.44	You only just talked
643.44	about a small part of it here --
646.32	a powerful part --
647.56	the idea of turning cars
647.56	into public transport like that,
650.28	it's cool.
651.52	But I've got a couple other questions
653.36	because I know they're
653.36	out there on people's minds.
655.8	So first of all, last week I think it was,
658.16	I switched on my phone
658.16	and tried to book an Uber
661	and I couldn't find the app.
663.08	You had this very radical,
663.08	very bold, brave redesign.
667.52	TK: Sure.
668.96	CA: How did it go?
670.2	Did you notice other people
670.2	not finding the app that day?
672.92	Are you going to win people over
672.92	for this redesign?
675.64	TK: Well, first I should
675.64	probably just say,
677.72	well, what we were trying to accomplish.
679.92	And I think if you know
679.92	a little bit about our history,
682.84	it makes a lot more sense.
684.8	Which is, when we first got started,
687.04	it was just black cars.
688.44	It was literally you push a button
688.44	and get an S-Class.
691.12	And so what we did
692.76	was almost what I would call
692.76	an immature version of a luxury brand
698.12	that looked like a badge on a luxury car.
701	And as we've gone worldwide
702.84	and gone from S-Classes
702.84	to auto rickshaws in India,
707.2	it became something
707.2	that was important for us
709.36	to be more accessible,
711.76	to be more hyperlocal,
713.32	to be about the cities we were in
715.68	and that's what you see
715.68	with the patterns and colors.
718.2	And to be more iconic,
719.48	because a U doesn't mean
719.48	anything in Sanskrit,
722.12	and a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.
724.6	And so that was
724.6	a little bit what it was about.
726.84	Now, when you first
726.84	roll out something like that,
729.76	I mean, your hands are sweating,
731.32	you've got --
732.56	you know, you're a little worried.
734.24	What we saw is a lot of people --
735.88	actually, at the beginning,
735.88	we saw a lot more people opening the app
739.2	because they were curious
739.2	what they would find when they opened it.
743.6	And our numbers were slightly up
743.6	from what we expected.
748.44	CA: OK, that's cool.
749.72	Now, so you, yourself,
749.72	are something of an enigma, I would say.
754.56	Your supporters and investors,
754.56	who have been with you the whole way,
759.36	believe that the only chance
760.76	of sort of taking on
760.76	the powerful, entrenched interests
764	of taxi industry and so forth,
766.12	is to have someone who is
766.12	a fierce, relentless competitor,
769.8	which you've certainly proved to be.
772.04	Some people feel you've almost
772.04	taken that culture too far,
775.4	and you know --
775.4	like a year or two ago
777.4	there was a huge controversy
777.4	where a lot of women got upset.
781.24	How did it feel like
781.24	inside the company during that period?
786.2	Did you notice a loss of business?
788.4	Did you learn anything from that?
790.96	TK: Well, look, I think --
792.24	I've been an entrepreneur
792.24	since I've been in high school
794.88	and you have --
797.72	In various different ways
797.72	an entrepreneur will see hard times
801.24	and for us,
802.52	it was about a year and a half ago,
804.6	and for us it was hard times, too.
807	Now, inside, we felt like --
810.12	I guess at the end of the day
811.56	we felt like we were
811.56	good people doing good work,
815.84	but on the outside that wasn't evident.
818.52	And so there was a lot that we had to do
821.16	to sort of --
823.04	We'd gone from a very small company --
824.92	I mean if you go literally
824.92	two and a half years ago,
828.04	our company was 400 people,
830.2	and today it's 6,500.
832.88	And so when you go through that growth,
834.8	you have to sort of cement
834.8	your cultural values
837.84	and talk about them all of the time.
840.2	And make sure that people
840.2	are constantly checking
843.4	"to say, ""Are we good people"
843.4	"doing good work?"""
845.92	And if you check those boxes,
847.6	the next part of that
847.6	is making sure you're telling your story.
851.36	And I think we learned a lot of lessons
853.32	but I think at the end of it
853.32	we came out stronger.
856.52	But it was certainly a difficult period.
860.151	CA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,
862.08	you're facing people
862.08	who occasionally give you a hard time.
865.84	Some Uber drivers
865.84	in New York and elsewhere
868.64	are mad as hell now
868.64	because you changed the fees
870.92	and they can barely -- they claim --
870.92	barely afford the deal anymore.
875.8	How --
877.24	You know, you said
877.24	that you started this originally --
880.56	just the coolness of pressing a button
880.56	and summoning a ride.
883.84	This thing's taken off,
885.12	you're affecting the whole global
885.12	economy, basically, at this point.
888.36	You're being forced to be,
888.36	whether you want it or not,
891.68	a kind of global visionary
891.68	who's changing the world.
894.16	I mean -- who are you?
895.84	Do you want that?
897.08	Are you ready to go with that
897.08	and be what that takes?
900.88	TK: Well, there's a few things
900.88	packed in that question, so --
904.24	(Laughter)
906.04	First is on the pricing side --
909.56	I mean, keep in mind, right?
911.2	UberX, when we first started,
913.12	was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper
913.12	than our black car product.
917.4	It's now
919.52	in many cities, half the price of a taxi.
923.32	And we have all the data to show
925.48	that the divers are making more per hour
925.48	than they would as taxi drivers.
929.68	What happens is when the price goes down,
932.72	people are more likely to take Uber
935.28	at different times of the day
935.28	than they otherwise would have,
938.162	and they're more likely to use it
938.162	in places they wouldn't have before.
941.48	And what that means for a driver
941.48	is wherever he or she drops somebody off,
945.64	they're much more likely
945.64	to get a pickup and get back in.
948.92	And so what that means
948.92	is more trips per hour,
951.48	more minutes of the hour
951.48	where they're productive
953.92	and actually, earnings come up.
955.84	And we have cities where we've done
955.84	literally five or six price cuts
959.92	and have seen those price cuts
959.92	go up over time.
962.72	So even in New York --
964.28	We have a blog post
964.28	"we call ""4 Septembers"" --"
967.28	compare the earnings
968.52	September after September after September.
970.68	Same month every year.
972.76	And we see the earnings going up over time
975.52	as the price comes down.
978.24	And there's a perfect price point --
978.24	you can't go down forever.
981.56	And in those places
981.56	where we bring the price down
983.92	but we don't see those earnings pop,
985.68	we bring the prices back up.
987.08	So that addresses that first part.
989.24	And then the enigma and all of this --
992.92	I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am
995.56	is one that gets really excited
995.56	about solving hard problems.
999.6	And the way I like to describe it
999.6	is it's kind of like a math professor.
1004.08	You know? If a math professor
1004.08	doesn't have hard problems to solve,
1007.56	that's a really sad math professor.
1010.6	And so at Uber we like the hard problems
1014.8	and we like getting excited
1014.8	about those and solving them.
1019.04	But we don't want just any math problem,
1021	we want the hardest ones
1021	that we can possibly find,
1023.44	and we want the one that if you solve it,
1025.44	there's a little bit of a wow factor.
1028.04	CA: In a couple years' time --
1029.52	say five years' time, I don't know when --
1031.544	you roll out your incredible
1031.544	self-driving cars,
1034.76	at probably a lower cost
1034.76	than you currently pay for an Uber ride.
1039.28	What do you say to your army
1039.28	of a million drivers plus at that time?
1044.4	TK: Explain that again --
1044.4	at which time?
1046.319	CA: At the time when
1046.319	self-driving cars are coming --
1048.8	TK: Sure, sure, sure.
1048.8	Sorry, I missed that.
1051.28	CA: What do you say to a driver?
1052.96	TK: Well, look, I think
1052.96	the first part is it's going to take --
1055.96	it's likely going to take a lot longer
1057.839	than I think some of the hype
1057.839	or media might expect.
1061.16	That's part one.
1062.4	Part two is it's going to also take --
1064.64	there's going to be a long transition.
1066.52	These cars will work
1066.52	in certain places and not in others.
1070.76	For us it's an interesting
1070.76	challenge, right?
1073.96	Because, well --
1076.28	Google's been investing
1076.28	in this since 2007,
1079.52	Tesla's going to be doing it,
1079.52	Apple's going to be doing it,
1082.36	the manufacturers
1082.36	are going to be doing it.
1084.44	This is a world that's going to exist,
1084.44	and for good reason.
1088.04	A million people die a year in cars.
1090.96	And we already looked at the billions
1090.96	or even trillions of hours worldwide
1094.52	that people are spending sitting in them,
1094.52	driving frustrated, anxious.
1098.8	And think about the quality
1098.8	of life that improves
1102.76	when you give people their time back
1105.72	and it's not so anxiety-ridden.
1107.32	So I think there's a lot of good.
1109.76	And so the way we think about it
1109.76	is that it's a challenge,
1112.64	but one for optimistic leadership,
1115.12	Where instead of resisting --
1117.96	resisting technology,
1119.2	maybe like the taxi industry,
1119.2	or the trolley industry --
1123.64	we have to embrace it
1123.64	or be a part of the future.
1127.28	But how do we optimistically
1127.28	lead through it?
1129.44	Are there ways to partner with cities?
1131.4	Are there ways to have education systems,
1131.4	vocational training, etc.,
1135.16	for that transition period.
1136.6	It will take a lot longer
1136.6	than I think we all expect,
1139.12	especially that transition period.
1140.8	But it is a world that's going to exist,
1143.24	and it is going to be a better world.
1146	CA: Travis, what you're building
1146	is absolutely incredible
1148.8	and I'm hugely grateful to you
1148.8	for coming to TED and sharing so openly.
1152.16	Thank you so much.
1152.16	TK: Thank you very much.
1154.24	(Applause)
