14.063	I opened a blind man's head.
17.363	I didn't make him think or reflect --
17.363	I cracked his head open, literally.
22.564	We were walking with him
22.564	holding onto my shoulder,
24.993	I miscalculated how much space
24.993	there was between us,
27.857	and I knocked him into a gate.
29.646	(Laughter)
30.837	Five stitches in his forehead.
33.863	At that moment, I felt like
33.863	the worst teacher in the world.
36.96	I really didn't know how to apologize.
39.845	Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people
39.845	who takes things quite well.
46.228	And to this day, he says
46.228	that I was the coach
48.776	who left the most important
48.776	mark on his career.
51.244	(Laughter)
53.441	The truth is, when I started working
53.441	at the institute for the blind,
56.747	I was surprised by a lot of things.
58.926	A lot of the things they did,
58.926	I never imagined they could:
62.474	they swam, did exercise, played cards.
66.97	They drank mate, and could pour it
68.648	without burning themselves in the process.
70.736	But when I saw them playing soccer --
72.553	that was amazing.
74.672	They had a dirt field,
74.672	rusty goalposts and broken nets.
79.054	The blind who attended the institute
79.054	would play their games there,
82.225	just like I did at a field near my house.
84.824	But they played without being able to see.
87.534	The ball made a sound
87.534	so they could locate it.
91.039	They had a guide
91.039	behind the rival team's goal
94.074	to know where to kick the ball.
96.102	And they used eye masks.
98.004	There were guys
98.004	who could still see a little,
100.264	and they wore eye masks
100.264	so everyone was equal.
104.524	When I was more at ease with them,
104.524	I asked for a mask myself.
109.2	I put it on and tried to play.
111.87	I had played soccer all my life.
114.272	This is where it got even more amazing:
116.342	within two seconds, I didn't know
116.342	where I was standing.
122.126	I had studied physical education
122.126	because I loved high performance.
125.904	I started working
125.904	at the institute by chance.
128.143	My other job was with the Argentinian
128.143	National Rowing Team,
131.014	and I felt that was my thing.
133.262	Here, everything was twice as hard.
135.785	I'll never forget the first day
135.785	I did the warm-up with the team.
139.564	I lined them up in front of me --
141.3	I used to do that with the rowing team --
144.193	"and I said, ""OK, everyone"
144.193	"bend down,"" going like this."
147.472	When I looked up, two guys were seated,
149.438	three were lying down
149.438	and others were squatting.
151.771	(Laughter)
153.161	How could I do here
153.161	the same things I was doing there?
158.907	It took me a while.
160.314	I started looking for tools
160.314	to learn from them,
163.802	from the teachers who worked with them.
166.394	I learned I couldn't explain a play
166.394	on a chalkboard like a coach does,
171.064	but I could use a plastic tray
171.064	and some bottle caps
173.868	so they could follow me by way of touch.
176.779	I also learned they could run on a track
179.956	if I ran with them, holding a rope.
182.656	So we started looking for volunteers
182.656	to help us run with them.
186.312	I was enjoying it,
189.764	and finding purpose and meaning
189.764	in what we were doing.
193.805	It was hard at first,
193.805	it was uncomfortable,
195.931	but I decided to overcome the discomfort.
198.098	And there came a time
199.544	when it became the most
199.544	fascinating job I'd ever had.
203.249	I think that's when I wondered:
205.63	Why couldn't we be
205.63	a high-performance team as well?
210.966	Of course, one thing was missing:
212.723	I needed to find out what they wanted,
214.817	the real protagonists of this story.
218.823	Three hours of training,
218.823	playing soccer on that field,
222.349	were not going to be enough.
223.984	We would have to train differently.
226.143	We started to train harder,
226.143	and the results were great;
229.906	they asked for more.
231.733	I came to understand
231.733	that they, too, wondered
233.879	why they couldn't do high-performance.
237.151	When we felt ready,
237.151	we knocked at CENARD's door.
241.174	CENARD is the National Center
241.174	for High-Performance Sports
243.938	here in Argentina.
245.306	It was hard to get them
245.306	to hear what we had to say.
247.747	But it was considerably more difficult
250.227	to get the other athletes training there
250.227	to consider us their equals.
254.662	In fact, they would let us use the field
256.622	only when no other teams were using it.
259.367	"And we were known as ""the blind ones."""
261.724	Not everyone knew
261.724	exactly what we were doing there.
265.622	The 2006 World Championship
265.622	was a turning point in the team's history.
270.449	It was held in Buenos Aires
270.449	for the first time.
273.257	It was our chance to show everyone
276.08	what we had been doing all that time.
278.947	We made it to the finals.
281.02	We were growing as a team.
283.374	It was us against Brazil in the finals.
286.406	They were the best team in the tournament.
289.033	They won every game by a landslide.
292.264	Hardly anyone believed
292.264	we could win that game.
297.942	Hardly anyone -- except for us.
300.935	During pre-game meetings,
302.833	in the locker room,
304.5	during each warm-up,
306.592	it smelled of victory.
310.079	I swear that smell exists.
312.433	I smelled it several times with the team,
315.079	but I remember it in particular,
315.079	the day before we played that final.
319.328	The Argentine Football Association
319.328	had opened their doors to us.
322.464	We were training at AFA,
323.954	where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.
326.472	For the first time ever,
329.081	we felt like a true national team.
332.214	At 7:30pm, the day before the game,
334.695	we were in the lounge discussing strategy,
338.547	and a waiter knocks on the door,
338.547	interrupting our conversation.
342.646	He suggested we go to church.
344.354	He came to invite us to church.
347.253	I tried to get rid of him,
347.253	saying it wasn't a good time,
351.139	that we better leave it for another day.
353.992	He kept insisting, asking me to please
353.992	let him take the guys to church,
359.507	because that day, a pastor
359.507	who performed miracles would be there.
364.4	I was slightly afraid to ask
364.4	what type of miracles he meant,
367.816	and he replied nonchalantly,
370.076	"""Coach, let me take"
370.076	the team to the church,
372.3	and when we return, I guarantee
372.3	"that half of them will be able to see."""
376.129	(Laughter)
380.655	Some of the guys laughed,
382.125	but imagine being a blind person
382.125	and someone says that to you.
385.299	I didn't know what to say.
386.708	I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.
389.376	I didn't want to make him feel bad,
391.144	because he truly believed
391.144	this could happen.
394.032	One of the players saved me,
396.694	when he stood up and confidently said,
398.664	"""Juan,"" -- that was the kid's name --"
400.572	Gonza already told you
400.572	it's not the best time to go to church.
403.549	Besides, let me make this clear:
405.354	if we go to that church, and I end up
405.354	being able to see when we return,
409.26	I will beat you so hard
409.26	"if I can't play tomorrow."""
412.302	(Laughter)
414.03	(Applause)
424.998	Juan left, laughing in resignation,
428.966	and we continued with our pregame talk.
431.687	That night when I went to sleep,
434.604	I began to dream
434.604	about the next day's game,
437.949	imagining what could happen,
437.949	how we would play.
440.652	And that's when I noticed
440.652	that smell of victory
443.132	I mentioned a while ago.
444.806	And it's because
444.806	at that moment, I thought:
446.993	if the other players had the same desire
446.993	as Diego going into the game,
452.261	it was impossible for us not to win.
455.779	The next day was going to be wonderful.
458.446	We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,
461.526	and we were already eager to play.
464.227	We left AFA, and the bus was full
464.227	of flags that people had given to us.
470.608	We were talking about the game,
472.791	and we could hear people
472.791	honking and cheering,
475.355	"""Go Murciélagos! Today's the day!"
475.355	"The final challenge!"""
478.689	"The guys asked me, ""Do they know us?"
478.689	"Do they know we're playing?"""
483.134	Some people followed the bus to CENARD.
487.237	We arrived and found an amazing scene.
491.247	In the corridor leading
491.247	from the locker room to the game field,
494.337	I was walking with Silvio,
496.313	who was holding onto my shoulder,
496.313	so I could guide him.
499.425	Fortunately, there were
499.425	no gates along the way.
501.712	(Laughter)
502.736	When we reached the field,
502.736	he asked me about everything.
505.872	He didn't want to miss a single detail.
507.832	"He said, ""Tell me what you see,"
507.832	"tell me who's playing the drums."""
511.675	I tried to explain what was happening
511.675	with as much detail as possible.
515.594	"I told him, ""The stands are packed,"
515.594	a lot of people couldn't get in,
520.418	there are blue and white balloons
520.418	all over the field,
523.036	they're opening a giant Argentine flag
523.036	"that covers the entire grandstand."""
527.201	Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,
529.322	"""Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"""
534.674	That's the city where he lives.
536.641	I started looking into the stands
538.48	and I spotted a little white flag
541.013	with lettering done
541.013	in black spray paint, that read:
544.087	"""Silvio, your family"
544.087	"and all of San Pedro are here."""
548.227	I told him that and he replied,
550.983	"""That's my mom, tell me where"
550.983	"she is, I want to I wave at her."""
555.564	I pointed him toward the flag
557.02	and showed him with his arm
557.02	where they were sitting,
559.59	and he waved his arms in that direction.
561.598	About 20 or 30 people stood up
561.598	and gave him an ovation.
565.341	When that happened,
566.754	I saw how his face changed,
566.754	how moved he was.
569.615	It was moving for me, too;
572.106	two seconds later,
572.106	I had a lump in my throat.
575.318	It was strange -- I felt both
575.318	the excitement of what was happening,
578.628	and the anger and the anguish
578.628	that he could not see it.
583.457	A few days later when I told him
583.457	what I had experienced,
589.266	he tried to reassure me, saying,
592.534	"""Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them."
595.135	Differently, but I swear to you
595.135	"that I saw them all."""
599.248	The game started.
600.668	We could not fail; it was the final.
603.53	The audience was quiet, like here,
605.979	because in soccer for the blind,
607.647	the public has to be quiet
607.647	so the players can hear the ball.
611.064	They're only allowed to cheer
611.064	when the game is over.
614.265	And when there were eight minutes to go,
617.747	the crowd did all the cheering
617.747	they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.
621.218	When pigeon-toed Silvio
621.218	nailed the ball at an angle,
624.871	they cheered with all their heart,
626.983	in an incredible way.
630.848	Today, if you go to CENARD,
630.848	you'll see a huge poster on the door,
635.49	with a photo of our team,
635.49	Los Murciélagos.
638.227	They're a model national team,
638.227	everyone in CENARD knows who they are,
642.895	and after having won
642.895	two World Championships
645.502	and two Paralympic medals,
646.923	no one doubts they are
646.923	high-performance athletes.
649.406	(Applause)
664.001	(Applause ends)
667.148	I was lucky to train
667.148	this team for 10 years,
670.86	first as a trainer
670.86	and later as their coach.
675.11	I feel that they've given me much more
679.993	than what I've given them.
682.209	Last year, they asked me to coach
682.209	another national team, Power Soccer.
689.394	It's a national team of young men
689.394	who play soccer in wheelchairs.
693.824	They use motorized wheelchairs
693.824	that they drive with a joystick,
696.895	because they don't have
696.895	enough strength in their arms
699.477	to use conventional chairs.
700.794	They added a bumper to the chair,
700.794	a safeguard that protects their feet,
704.528	while allowing them to kick the ball.
707.548	It's the first time that, instead
707.548	of being the spectators,
711.739	they're now the main characters.
713.58	It's the first time their parents,
713.58	friends and siblings can see them play.
719.76	For me, it's a new challenge,
722.127	with the same discomfort,
722.127	insecurity, and fear I had
725.395	when I started working with the blind.
727.86	But I approach it all
727.86	from a more experienced position.
730.601	That's why from day one,
730.601	I treat them as athletes on the field,
735.827	and off the field, I try
735.827	to put myself in their shoes
738.461	and behave without prejudice,
739.912	because treating them naturally
739.912	feels best to them.
745.326	Both teams play soccer;
745.326	something once unthinkable for them.
750.303	They had to adapt the rules to do so.
755.129	And both teams broke the same rule --
757.677	the one that said
757.677	they couldn't play soccer.
761.589	When you see them play,
761.589	you see competition, not disability.
766.568	The problem starts when the game is over,
769.746	and they leave the field.
771.245	Then they step in to play our game,
773.765	in a society whose rules
773.765	don't really take them into account
777.743	or care for them.
779.52	I learned from sports
781.364	that disability greatly depends on
781.364	the rules of the game.
785.512	I believe that if we change
785.512	some of the rules of our game,
789.6	we can make life a little easier for them.
793.209	We all know there are people
793.209	with disabilities; we see them daily.
798.644	But by having no direct contact with them,
801.629	we're not aware of the problems
801.629	they face every day,
805.203	like how hard it is for them
805.203	to get on a bus,
807.334	find a job,
809.009	take the subway
810.186	or cross the street.
812.367	It's true that there is an increasing
812.367	social responsibility
815.562	regarding the inclusion
815.562	of people with disabilities.
820.466	But I think it's still not enough.
822.983	I think change needs to come
822.983	from every one of us.
826.046	First, by leaving behind
826.046	our indifference toward the disabled,
829.716	and then by respecting the rules
829.716	that do take them into account.
833.091	They are few, but they do exist.
837.158	I cracked a blind man's head
837.158	open -- El Pulga's head.
840.669	I can assure you these two teams
840.669	opened mine as well.
844.547	They taught me that above all,
846.008	you have to get out there
846.008	and play every game
848.156	in this beautiful tournament
848.156	that we call life.
850.41	Thank you.
851.59	(Applause)
