12.389	This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
15.629	where I work as a curator.
18.189	It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,
21.237	and that it grows,
23.213	and basically it means I collect dead animals.
28.565	Back in 1995,
30.956	we got a new wing next to the museum.
35.452	It was made of glass,
37.593	and this building really helped me to do my job good.
43.099	The building was a true bird-killer.
47.225	You may know that birds don't understand
49.803	the concept of glass. They don't see it,
52.965	so they fly into the windows and get killed.
56.571	The only thing I had to do was go out,
58.811	pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.
62.868	(Laughter)
65.986	And in those days,
67.765	I developed an ear to identify birds
71.203	just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.
76.789	And it was on June 5, 1995,
80.771	that I heard a loud bang against the glass
84.537	that changed my life and ended that of a duck.
89.147	And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.
94.942	This is the dead duck. It flew against the window.
98.126	It's laying dead on its belly.
99.82	But next to the dead duck is a live duck,
103.175	and please pay attention.
105.489	Both are of the male sex.
110.41	And then this happened.
113.083	The live duck mounted the dead duck,
115.789	and started to copulate.
118.452	Well, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.
121.177	"I said, ""Something's wrong here."""
123.925	One is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.
129.897	I look. Both are of the male sex.
132.779	Homosexual necrophilia.
137.418	So I -- (Laughter)
142.463	I took my camera, I took my notebook,
145.407	took a chair, and started to observe this behavior.
150.818	After 75 minutes — (Laughter) —
156.435	I had seen enough, and I got hungry,
161.244	and I wanted to go home.
163.883	So I went out, collected the duck,
167.443	and before I put it in the freezer,
169.399	I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.
174.275	And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,
177.883	so it was indeed of the male sex.
180.924	It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds
184.219	and only 300 possess a penis.
188.81	[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]
191.197	I knew I'd seen something special,
195.131	but it took me six years to decide to publish it.
200.553	(Laughter)
203.408	I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party
206.939	or at the coffee machine,
208.678	but to share this among your peers is something different.
211.988	I didn't have the framework.
213.806	So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,
216.851	"so I published ""The first case of homosexual necrophilia"
220.155	"in the mallard."""
221.75	And here's the situation again.
224.299	A is my office,
226.851	B is the place where the duck hit the glass,
229.315	and C is from where I watched it.
232.373	And here are the ducks again.
235.07	As you probably know, in science,
237.077	when you write a kind of special paper,
239.26	only six or seven people read it.
242.259	(Laughter)
248.844	But then something good happened.
251.444	I got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,
255.952	"and he told me, ""You've won a prize with your duck paper:"
260.805	"the Ig Nobel Prize."""
264.488	And the Ig Nobel Prize —
266.402	(Laughter) (Applause) —
270.819	the Ig Nobel Prize honors research
272.838	that first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,
275.915	with the ultimate goal to make more people
278.699	interested in science.
281.763	That's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.
285.899	(Laughter)
288.588	I went -- let me remind you that Marc Abrahams
292.344	didn't call me from Stockholm.
293.917	He called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
296.07	So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,
299.017	and I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony
302.472	held at Harvard University, and this ceremony
304.825	is a very nice experience.
310.065	Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.
313.346	That's the first thing.
314.759	And there are nine other winners who get prizes.
317.793	Here's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton
321.169	who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,
326.23	"""Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans"
330.209	"under farming conditions in Britain."""
332.645	(Laughter)
336.925	And I think there are one or two more
340.081	Ig Nobel Prize winners in this room.
343.002	Dan, where are you? Dan Ariely?
346.729	Applause for Dan.
348.651	(Applause)
351.953	Dan won his prize in medicine
355.697	for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine
359.872	works better than low-priced fake medicine.
362.729	(Laughter)
367	So here's my one minute of fame,
369.818	my acceptance speech,
374.295	and here's the duck.
376.508	This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
381.43	I'm going to pass it around.
384.104	(Laughter)
389.393	Yeah?
390.87	You can pass it around.
392.179	Please note it's a museum specimen,
394.56	but there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.
399.978	After winning this prize, my life changed.
403.984	In the first place, people started to send me
406.114	all kinds of duck-related things,
409.661	and I got a real nice collection.
412.713	(Laughter)
415.04	More importantly,
421.704	people started to send me their observations
425.776	of remarkable animal behavior,
428.31	and believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,
431.482	I know about it.
433.183	(Laughter)
437.531	This is a moose.
442.313	It's a moose trying to copulate
443.84	with a bronze statue of a bison.
447.329	This is in Montana, 2008.
451.122	This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.
455.202	This is the Netherlands, 2011.
458.433	These are cane toads in Australia.
462.709	This is roadkill.
463.964	Please note that this is necrophilia.
467.208	It's remarkable: the position.
468.916	The missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.
473.348	These are pigeons in Rotterdam.
479.895	Barn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.
483.373	This is a turkey in Wisconsin
487.137	on the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.
493.216	It took all day,
495.664	and the prisoners had a great time.
500.795	So what does this mean?
502.727	I mean, the question I ask myself,
505.975	why does this happen in nature?
507.676	Well, what I concluded
509.487	from reviewing all these cases
511.946	is that it is important that this happens
515.914	only when death is instant
519.961	and in a dramatic way
522.176	and in the right position for copulation.
525.113	At least, I thought it was till I got these slides.
530.771	And here you see a dead duck.
533.194	It's been there for three days,
535.786	and it's laying on its back.
537.84	So there goes my theory of necrophilia.
543.698	Another example of the impact
545.088	of glass buildings on the life of birds.
547.081	This is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.
550.426	The only thing this bird did was fly against this window
556.312	from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.
561.264	Here he goes, and here's a short video.
564.213	(Music) (Clunk)
572.073	(Clunk)
586.377	(Clunk)
596.905	(Clunk)
599.128	So what this bird does
601.175	is fight his own image.
605.273	He sees an intruder in his territory,
607.551	and it's coming all the time and he's there,
610.623	so there is no end to it.
612.466	And I thought, in the beginning -- I studied this bird for a couple of years --
615.649	that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?
618.895	It's not. I show you here some slides,
621.943	some frames from the video,
623.994	and at the last moment before he hits the glass,
627.241	he puts his feet in front,
629.252	and then he bangs against the glass.
634.071	So I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.
638.715	That's on June 5 every year.
641.417	At five minutes to six in the afternoon,
644.649	we come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
648.563	the duck comes out of the museum,
651.202	and we try to discuss new ways
653.697	to prevent birds from colliding with windows.
657.551	And as you know, or as you may not know,
659.986	this is one of the major causes of death
662.585	for birds in the world.
664.09	In the U.S. alone, a billion birds die
666.961	in collision with glass buildings.
670.186	And when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant
676.113	and we have a six-course duck dinner.
680.871	So I hope to see you
683.721	next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
686.776	for Dead Duck Day.
688.123	Thank you.
689.394	(Applause)
691.412	Oh, sorry.
697.124	May I have my duck back, please?
699.233	(Laughter) (Applause)
702.341	Thank you.
