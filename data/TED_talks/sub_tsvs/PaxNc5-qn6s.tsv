12.58	No one will ever pay you
12.58	what you're worth.
17.7	No one will ever pay you
20.06	what you're worth.
23.66	They'll only ever pay you
25.62	what they think you're worth.
28.26	And you control their thinking,
31.42	not like this,
33.34	although that would be cool.
34.7	(Laughter)
36.34	That would be really cool.
39.22	Instead, like this:
41.22	clearly defining and communicating
41.22	your value are essential
45.98	to being paid well for your excellence.
48.62	Anyone here want to be paid well?
51.18	OK, good,
52.5	then this talk is for everyone.
54.82	It's got universal applicability.
56.82	It's true if you're a business owner,
56.82	if you're an employee,
60.34	if you're a job seeker.
61.82	It's true if you're a man or a woman.
64.42	Now, I approach this today through
64.42	the lens of the woman business owner,
67.98	because in my work I've observed
67.98	that women underprice more so than men.
72.38	The gender wage gap is
72.38	a well-traveled narrative in this country.
75.58	According to the Bureau
75.58	of Labor Statistics,
77.7	a woman employee earns just 83 cents
77.7	for every dollar a man earns.
82.98	What may surprise you
84.42	is that this trend continues
84.42	even into the entrepreneurial sphere.
88.06	A woman business owner earns just
93.18	In my work, I've often heard women express
95.54	that they're uncomfortable
95.54	communicating their value,
98.34	especially early on in business ownership.
101.78	They say things like,
103.34	"""I don't like to toot my own horn."""
105.86	"""I'd rather let the work"
105.86	"speak for itself."""
108.82	"""I don't like to sing my own praises."""
111.42	I hear very different narratives
111.42	in working with male business owners,
114.94	and I think this difference
114.94	is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.
119.5	I'd like to tell you the story
119.5	of a consulting firm
121.94	that helps their clients
121.94	dramatically improve their profitability.
125.18	That company is my company.
127.7	After my first year in business,
127.7	I saw the profit increases
130.9	that my clients were realizing
130.9	in working with me,
134.3	and I realized that I needed
134.3	to reevaluate my pricing.
137.78	I was really underpriced
137.78	relative to the value I was delivering.
141.5	It's hard for me to admit to you,
141.5	because I'm a pricing consultant.
145.18	(Laughter)
146.9	It's what I do.
148.14	I help companies price for value.
150.98	But nonetheless, it's what I saw,
152.62	and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing,
152.62	evaluate my value,
157.26	and I did that
157.26	by asking key value questions.
160.9	What are my clients' needs
160.9	and how do I meet them?
163.62	What is my unique skill set that makes me
163.62	better qualified to serve my clients?
168.5	What do I do that no one else does?
171.06	What problems do I solve for clients?
173.66	What value do I add?
176.7	I answered these questions
178.5	and defined the value that my clients
178.5	get from working with me,
182.14	calculated their return on investment,
184.02	and what I saw was
184.02	that I needed to double my price,
187.78	double it.
189.02	Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.
194.18	I'm supposed to be the expert in this,
194.18	but I'm not cured.
197.66	I knew the value was there.
199.22	I was convinced the value was there,
201.26	and I was still scared out of my wits.
203.82	What if nobody would pay me that?
205.82	"What if clients said, ""That's ridiculous."
208.1	"You're ridiculous."""
210.3	Was I really worth that?
213.02	Not my work, mind you, but me.
216.38	Was I worth that?
218.5	I'm the mother of two beautiful
218.5	little girls who depend upon me.
221.58	I'm a single mom.
223.1	What if my business fails?
225.18	What if I fail?
228.06	But I know how to take my own medicine,
230.86	the medicine that I
230.86	prescribe to my clients.
233.42	I had done the homework.
235.14	I knew the value was there.
237.5	So when prospects came,
240.18	I prepared the proposals
240.18	with the new higher pricing
243.22	and sent them out
244.54	and communicated the value.
247.3	How's the story end?
249.66	Clients continued to hire me
251.66	and refer me and recommend me,
251.66	and I'm still here.
255.86	And I share this story
257.14	because doubts and fears
257.14	are natural and normal.
260.22	But they don't define our value,
262.7	and they shouldn't limit
262.7	our earning potential.
267.38	I'd like to share another story,
269.18	about a woman who learned
269.18	to communicate her value
272.02	and found her own voice.
274.78	She runs a successful
274.78	web development company
277.18	and employs several people.
279.42	When she first started her firm
279.42	and for several years thereafter,
282.66	"she would say, ""I have"
282.66	"a little web design company."""
286.66	She'd actually use
286.66	those words with clients.
289.22	"""I have a little web design company."""
292.18	In this and in many other small ways,
294.02	she was diminishing her company
294.02	in the eyes of prospects and clients,
297.94	and diminishing herself.
300.86	It was really impacting her ability
300.86	to earn what she was worth.
304.9	I believe her language and her style
307.82	communicated that she didn't believe
310.1	she had much value to offer.
313.62	In her own words, she was practically
313.62	giving her services away.
317.86	And so she began her journey
320.18	to take responsibility
320.18	for communicating value to clients
323.38	and changing her message.
326.38	One thing I shared with her
327.9	is that it's so important
329.98	to find your own voice,
331.5	a voice that's authentic and true to you.
333.58	Don't try to channel your sister-in-law
333.58	just because she's a great salesperson
337.3	or your neighbor who tells a great joke
337.3	if that's not who you are.
341.5	Give up this notion
341.5	that it's tooting your own horn.
343.98	Make it about the other party.
345.74	Focus on serving and adding value,
345.74	and it won't feel like bragging.
350.26	What do you love about what you do?
352.9	What excites you
352.9	about the work that you do?
355.02	If you connect with that, communicating
355.02	your value will come naturally.
360.34	So she embraced her natural style,
362.62	found her voice and changed her message.
365.94	For one thing, she stopped calling herself
365.94	a little web design company.
369.94	She really found a lot of strength
369.94	and power in communicating her message.
375.1	She's now charging three times
375.1	as much for web design,
378.06	and her business is growing.
380.7	She told me about a recent meeting
382.38	with a gruff and sometimes
382.38	difficult client
384.58	who had called a meeting questioning
384.58	progress on search engine optimization.
389.3	She said in the old days,
390.54	that would have been
390.54	a really intimidating meeting for her,
393.34	but her mindset was different.
394.82	She said, she prepared the information,
394.82	sat down with the client,
398.54	said this isn't about me,
398.54	it's not personal,
401.34	it's about the client.
402.7	She took them through the data,
402.7	through the numbers,
406.26	laid out the trends and the progress
406.26	in her own voice and in her own way,
410.22	but very directly said,
410.22	"""Here's what we've done for you."""
412.94	The client sat up and took notice,
412.94	"and said, ""OK, I got it."""
417.78	And she said in describing that meeting,
419.74	"""I didn't feel scared or panicky"
423.38	or small,
425.62	which is how I used to feel.
427.62	Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.
432.1	"I know what I'm doing. I'm confident.'"""
437.62	Being properly valued is so important.
440.26	You can hear in this story
441.94	that the implications
441.94	range far beyond just finances
445.18	into the realm of self-respect
445.18	and self-confidence.
450.18	Today I've told two stories,
450.18	one about defining our value
453.74	and the other about
453.74	communicating our value,
456.58	and these are the two elements
456.58	to realizing our full earning potential.
460.38	That's the equation.
462.66	And if you're sitting
462.66	in the audience today
465.38	and you're not being paid
465.38	what you're worth,
467.86	I'd like to welcome you
467.86	into this equation.
470.42	Just imagine what life could be like,
472.82	how much more we could do,
474.7	how much more we could give back,
476.82	how much more we could
476.82	plan for the future,
479.38	how validated and respected we would feel
482.58	if we could earn our full potential,
485.3	realize our full value.
488.54	No one will ever pay you
488.54	what you're worth.
491.14	They'll only ever pay you
491.14	what they think you're worth,
493.78	and you control their thinking.
496.06	Thank you.
497.46	(Applause)
