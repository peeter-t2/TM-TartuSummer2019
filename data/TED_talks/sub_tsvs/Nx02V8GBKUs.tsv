16.26	(Music)
31.26	♫ I don't understand myself, ♫
34.26	♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫
39.26	♫ if they come near me, ♫
42.26	♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫
48.26	♫ I don't understand myself, ♫
51.26	♫ why they talk of magic, ♫
56.26	♫ that no one withstands, ♫
58.26	♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫
67.26	♫ But if the red light is on ♫
73.26	♫ in the middle of the night ♫
76.26	♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫
80.26	♫ then it is plain to see. ♫
90.26	♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫
99.26	♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫
108.26	♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫
115.26	♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫
122.26	♫ My feet, they glide and float, ♫
128.26	♫ my eyes, they lure and glow. ♫
137.26	♫ And I dance as if entranced, 'cause I know, ♫
147.26	♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫
196.26	♫ In my veins, ♫
199.26	♫ runs a dancer's blood, ♫
203.26	♫ because my beautiful mother ♫
206.26	♫ was the Queen of dance ♫
209.26	♫ in the gilded Alcazar. ♫
213.26	♫ She was so very beautiful, ♫
216.26	♫ I often saw her in my dreams. ♫
221.26	♫ If she beat the tambourine ♫
224.26	♫ to her beguiling dance,
224.26	all eyes were glowing admiringly. ♫
234.26	♫ She reawakened in me, ♫
239.26	♫ mine is the same lot. ♫
242.26	♫ I dance like her at midnight ♫
245.26	♫ and from deep within I feel: ♫
255.26	♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫
264.26	♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫
273.26	♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫
281.26	♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫
301.26	♫ And I dance as if entranced, 
301.26	'cause I know, ♫
313.26	♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss. ♫
330.26	(Applause)
