12.602	The first patient to ever be 
12.602	treated with an antibiotic
16.16	was a policeman in Oxford.
17.693	On his day off from work,
19.8	he was scratched by a rose thorn
19.8	while working in the garden.
23.173	That small scratch became infected.
26.848	Over the next few days, 
26.848	his head was swollen
29.163	with abscesses,
30.884	and in fact his eye was so infected
33.167	that they had to take it out,
35.07	and by February of 1941,
38.05	this poor man was on the verge of dying.
40.487	He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,
43.685	and fortunately for him,
45.991	a small team of doctors
47.041	led by a Dr. Howard Florey
48.93	had managed to synthesize
50.997	a very small amount of penicillin,
53.82	a drug that had been discovered
58.223	but had never actually been 
58.223	used to treat a human,
61.93	and indeed no one even 
61.93	knew if the drug would work,
64.34	if it was full of impurities 
64.34	that would kill the patient,
67.98	but Florey and his team figured
69.894	if they had to use it, 
69.894	they might as well use it
71.616	on someone who was going to die anyway.
74.181	So they gave Albert Alexander,
77.836	this Oxford policeman, the drug,
80.715	and within 24 hours,
83.132	he started getting better.
85.394	His fever went down, 
85.394	his appetite came back.
89.37	Second day, he was doing much better.
91.683	They were starting to 
91.683	run out of penicillin,
93.921	so what they would do 
93.921	was run with his urine
95.983	across the road to re-synthesize 
95.983	the penicillin from his urine
98.833	and give it back to him,
100.768	and that worked.
102.016	Day four, well on the way to recovery.
104.496	This was a miracle.
106.134	Day five, they ran out of penicillin,
110.37	and the poor man died.
112.637	So that story didn't end that well,
115.35	but fortunately for 
115.35	millions of other people,
119.7	like this child who was treated 
119.7	again in the early 1940s,
122.706	who was again dying of a sepsis,
125.74	and within just six days, you can see,
128.89	recovered thanks to this 
128.89	wonder drug, penicillin.
132.243	Millions have lived,
134.201	and global health has been transformed.
137.785	Now, antibiotics have been used
140.578	for patients like this,
143.705	but they've also been 
143.705	used rather frivolously
145.842	in some instances,
147.586	for treating someone 
147.586	with just a cold or the flu,
149.949	which they might not have 
149.949	responded to an antibiotic,
152.423	and they've also been 
152.423	used in large quantities
156.161	sub-therapeutically, which
156.161	means in small concentrations,
159.803	to make chicken and hogs grow faster.
162.986	Just to save a few pennies
162.986	on the price of meat,
166.552	we've spent a lot of 
166.552	antibiotics on animals,
169.252	not for treatment, not for sick animals,
171.614	but primarily for growth promotion.
174.73	Now, what did that lead us to?
177.587	Basically, the massive use of antibiotics
180.298	around the world
181.783	has imposed such large
181.783	selection pressure on bacteria
185.587	that resistance is now a problem,
188.24	because we've now selected for just
190.01	the resistant bacteria.
191.985	And I'm sure you've all read
191.985	about this in the newspapers,
194.825	you've seen this in every magazine
196.629	that you come across,
198.528	but I really want you to appreciate
200.328	the significance of this problem.
202.499	This is serious.
203.95	The next slide I'm about to show you is 
203.95	of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.
208.766	Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,
211.154	and carbapenem is pretty much
212.487	the strongest class of antibiotics
214.265	that we can throw at this bug.
216.721	And you can see in 1999
219.99	this is the pattern of resistance,
222.185	mostly under about 10 percent
222.185	across the United States.
225.218	Now watch what happens 
225.218	when we play the video.
238.461	So I don't know where you live,
240.516	but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now
243.418	than it was in 1999,
245.915	and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.
249.886	It's a global issue
251.573	affecting both rich and poor countries,
254.001	and at the heart of it, 
254.001	you might say, well,
256.242	isn't this really just a medical issue?
258.17	If we taught doctors how not 
258.17	to use antibiotics as much,
260.731	if we taught patients how 
260.731	not to demand antibiotics,
263.676	perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,
265.131	and maybe the pharmaceutical companies
267.12	should be working harder to develop
268.875	more antibiotics.
270.511	Now, it turns out that there's something 
270.511	fundamental about antibiotics
273.89	which makes it different from other drugs,
275.673	which is that if I misuse antibiotics
277.694	or I use antibiotics,
279.431	not only am I affected but 
279.431	others are affected as well,
283.291	in the same way as if I 
283.291	choose to drive to work
285.629	or take a plane to go somewhere,
288.268	that the costs I impose on others
290.242	through global climate change go everywhere,
292.682	and I don't necessarily take
292.682	these costs into consideration.
295.455	This is what economists might 
295.455	call a problem of the commons,
298.334	and the problem of the commons is exactly
300.314	what we face in the case 
300.314	of antibiotics as well:
302.739	that we don't consider —
304.889	and we, including individuals, patients,
307.891	hospitals, entire health systems —
311.05	do not consider the costs 
311.05	that they impose on others
313.198	by the way antibiotics are actually used.
315.554	Now, that's a problem that's similar
317.959	to another area that we all know about,
319.941	which is of fuel use and energy,
321.87	and of course energy use
323.369	both depletes energy as well as
326.451	leads to local pollution 
326.451	and climate change.
329.713	And typically, in the case of energy,
331.523	there are two ways in which
331.523	you can deal with the problem.
333.831	One is, we can make better
333.831	use of the oil that we have,
337.576	and that's analogous to making better use
339.691	of existing antibiotics,
341.239	and we can do this in a number of ways
342.93	that we'll talk about in a second,
345.16	but the other option is the 
345.16	"""drill, baby, drill"" option,"
348.847	which in the case of antibiotics 
348.847	is to go find new antibiotics.
353.05	Now, these are not separate.
355.1	They're related, because if we invest heavily
358.522	in new oil wells,
360.806	we reduce the incentives 
360.806	for conservation of oil
363.76	in the same way that's going 
363.76	to happen for antibiotics.
366.286	The reverse is also going 
366.286	to happen, which is that
368.454	if we use our antibiotics appropriately,
370.792	we don't necessarily have 
370.792	to make the investments
373.573	in new drug development.
375.75	And if you thought that these two were entirely,
378.466	fully balanced between these two options,
380.288	you might consider the fact that
382.471	this is really a game that we're playing.
384.743	The game is really one of coevolution,
387.184	and coevolution is, in 
387.184	this particular picture,
390.116	between cheetahs and gazelles.
392.472	Cheetahs have evolved to run faster,
394.09	because if they didn't run faster,
395.667	they wouldn't get any lunch.
397.613	Gazelles have evolved to run faster because
400.3	if they don't run faster, they would be lunch.
403.509	Now, this is the game we're
403.509	playing against the bacteria,
406.395	except we're not the cheetahs,
408.452	we're the gazelles,
409.929	and the bacteria would,
412.716	just in the course of this little talk,
414.549	would have had kids and grandkids
415.975	and figured out how to be resistant
418.36	just by selection and trial and error,
420.834	trying it over and over again.
422.746	Whereas how do we stay 
422.746	ahead of the bacteria?
426.518	We have drug discovery processes,
428.572	screening molecules,
430.202	we have clinical trials,
431.93	and then, when we think we have a drug,
434.078	then we have the FDA regulatory process.
437.823	And once we go through all of that,
440.001	then we try to stay one step ahead
442.266	of the bacteria.
444.562	Now, this is clearly not a 
444.562	game that can be sustained,
447.339	or one that we can win
448.476	by simply innovating to stay ahead.
450.313	We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,
453.618	and there are ideas that we 
453.618	can borrow from energy
457.3	that are helpful in thinking about
459.07	how we might want to do this in the case
460.607	of antibiotics as well.
462.153	Now, if you think about how we deal with
464.393	energy pricing, for instance,
465.816	we consider emissions taxes,
467.665	which means we're imposing 
467.665	the costs of pollution
470.249	on people who actually use that energy.
473.08	We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,
476.06	and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics
478.771	actually get used appropriately.
481.172	There are clean energy subsidies,
483.2	which are to switch to fuels
483.2	which don't pollute as much
486.255	or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.
489.1	Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need
491.96	to move away from using antibiotics,
494.22	and if you think about it, what are 
494.22	good substitutes for antibiotics?
497.936	Well, turns out that anything that reduces
500.1	the need for the antibiotic would really work,
502.343	so that could include improving
502.343	hospital infection control
505.485	or vaccinating people,
508.38	particularly against 
508.38	the seasonal influenza.
510.677	And the seasonal flu is probably
513.208	the biggest driver of antibiotic use,
516.212	both in this country as well
516.212	as in many other countries,
519.131	and that could really help.
521.151	A third option might include
521.151	something like tradeable permits.
525.254	And these seem like faraway scenarios,
529.5	but if you consider the 
529.5	fact that we might not
531.927	have antibiotics for many 
531.927	people who have infections,
535.31	we might consider the fact that we might
537.547	want to allocate who actually gets to use
539.858	some of these antibiotics over others,
542.572	and some of these might have to
542.572	be on the basis of clinical need,
545.898	but also on the basis of pricing.
547.833	And certainly consumer education works.
549.743	Very often, people overuse antibiotics
552.344	or prescribe too much without necessarily
554.621	knowing that they do so,
556.227	and feedback mechanisms
557.658	have been found to be useful,
559.56	both on energy —
561.489	When you tell someone that they're using
563.029	a lot of energy during peak hour,
564.946	they tend to cut back,
566.416	and the same sort of example has been performed
568.183	even in the case of antibiotics.
569.993	A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up
571.974	on a chart the names of surgeons
576.166	in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used
578.385	in the previous month,
580.329	and this was purely an 
580.329	informational feedback,
582.671	there was no shaming,
583.854	but essentially that provided 
583.854	some information back
585.989	to surgeons that maybe they could rethink
587.943	how they were using antibiotics.
590.172	Now, there's a lot that can be done
592.186	on the supply side as well.
594.335	If you look at the price of penicillin,
596.112	the cost per day is about 10 cents.
597.763	It's a fairly cheap drug.
599.521	If you take drugs that have
599.521	been introduced since then —
601.658	linezolid or daptomycin —
604.302	those are significantly more expensive,
606.18	so to a world that has been used to
606.18	paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,
611.633	the idea of paying 180 dollars per day
614.163	seems like a lot.
615.73	But what is that really telling us?
617.717	That price is telling us
619.682	that we should no longer
621.58	take cheap, effective 
621.58	antibiotics as a given
625.697	into the foreseeable future,
627.464	and that price is a signal to us
629.994	that perhaps we need to be paying
631.603	much more attention to conservation.
634.156	That price is also a signal
636.86	that maybe we need to start
636.86	looking at other technologies,
639.735	in the same way that 
639.735	gasoline prices are a signal
642.387	and an impetus, to, say,
644.977	the development of electric cars.
646.845	Prices are important signals
648.622	and we need to pay attention,
650.208	but we also need to consider the fact that
652.66	although these high prices
652.66	seem unusual for antibiotics,
656.912	they're nothing compared to the price per day
659.151	of some cancer drugs,
660.535	which might save a patient's life only
660.535	for a few months or perhaps a year,
663.905	whereas antibiotics would potentially
665.675	save a patient's life forever.
667.501	So this is going to involve
668.82	a whole new paradigm shift,
670.782	and it's also a scary shift because
672.638	in many parts of this country,
674.967	in many parts of the world,
676.711	the idea of paying 200 dollars
678.78	for a day of antibiotic treatment
681.671	is simply unimaginable.
684.213	So we need to think about that.
685.947	Now, there are backstop options,
687.76	which is other alternative technologies
690.436	that people are working on.
691.63	It includes bacteriophages, probiotics,
694.282	quorum sensing, synbiotics.
698.33	Now, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,
701.369	and they will become even more lucrative
703.979	when the price of new 
703.979	antibiotics starts going higher,
707.06	and we've seen that the
707.06	market does actually respond,
709.957	and the government is now considering
711.965	ways of subsidizing new 
711.965	antibiotics and development.
715.732	But there are challenges here.
717.455	We don't want to just throw money at a problem.
719.03	What we want to be able to do
720.549	is invest in new antibiotics
722.828	in ways that actually encourage
725.804	appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,
728.824	and that really is the challenge here.
731.287	Now, going back to these technologies,
733.616	you all remember the line from that famous
735.979	"dinosaur film, ""Nature will find a way."""
738.205	So it's not as if these are 
738.205	permanent solutions.
741.524	We really have to remember that,
741.524	whatever the technology might be,
745.61	that nature will find some 
745.61	way to work around it.
748.486	You might think, well, 
748.486	this is just a problem
750.557	just with antibiotics and with bacteria,
753.301	but it turns out that we 
753.301	have the exact same
755.247	identical problem in 
755.247	many other fields as well,
757.981	with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,
760.933	which is a serious problem 
760.933	in India and South Africa.
764.495	Thousands of patients are dying because
766.282	the second-line drugs are so expensive,
768.116	and in some instances, even those don't work
770.343	and you have XDR TB.
772.413	Viruses are becoming resistant.
774.224	Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.
777.39	Right now, much of the world depends on
779.173	one drug, artemisinin drugs,
782.87	essentially to treat malaria.
784.826	Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,
787.413	and if this were to become widespread,
789.767	that puts at risk
791.115	the single drug that we have to 
791.115	treat malaria around the world
794.006	in a way that's currently 
794.006	safe and efficacious.
797.22	Mosquitos develop resistance.
799.018	If you have kids, you probably 
799.018	know about head lice,
801.255	and if you're from New York City,
802.968	I understand that the 
802.968	specialty there is bedbugs.
805.701	So those are also resistant.
807.956	And we have to bring an
807.956	example from across the pond.
810.835	Turns out that rats are 
810.835	also resistant to poisons.
813.19	Now, what's common 
813.19	to all of these things is
815.891	the idea that we've had these technologies
818.597	to control nature only for 
818.597	the last 70, 80 or 100 years
823.218	and essentially in a blink,
826.246	we have squandered our ability to control,
828.797	because we have not recognized
831.288	that natural selection and 
831.288	evolution was going to find
834.1	a way to get back,
835.274	and we need to completely rethink
837.323	how we're going to use
839.666	measures to control biological organisms,
842.76	and rethink how we incentivize
846.224	the development, introduction,
848.45	in the case of antibiotics prescription,
851.118	and use of these valuable resources.
854.89	And we really now need to 
854.89	start thinking about them
857.27	as natural resources.
859.228	And so we stand at a crossroads.
861.466	An option is to go through that rethinking
864.625	and carefully consider incentives
866.438	to change how we do business.
868.992	The alternative is
871.253	a world in which even a blade of grass
874.336	is a potentially lethal weapon.
876.765	Thank you.
878.565	(Applause)
