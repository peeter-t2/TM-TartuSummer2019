16.371	Everyone, please think
16.371	of your biggest personal goal.
20.117	For real -- you can take a second.
20.117	You've got to feel this to learn it.
23.689	Take a few seconds and think
23.689	of your personal biggest goal, okay?
27.427	Imagine deciding right now
27.427	that you're going to do it.
30.132	Imagine telling someone that you
30.132	meet today what you're going to do.
33.425	Imagine their congratulations,
35.684	and their high image of you.
37.26	Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
39.633	Don't you feel one step closer already,
42.123	like it's already becoming
42.123	part of your identity?
44.601	Well, bad news: you should
44.601	have kept your mouth shut,
48.621	because that good feeling
50.074	now will make you less likely to do it.
52.755	The repeated psychology tests have proven
55.105	that telling someone your goal
55.105	makes it less likely to happen.
59.366	Any time you have a goal,
60.695	there are some steps that need to be done,
62.743	some work that needs to be done
62.743	in order to achieve it.
65.348	Ideally you would not be satisfied
65.348	until you'd actually done the work.
68.668	But when you tell someone your goal
68.668	and they acknowledge it,
71.564	psychologists have found
71.564	"that it's called a ""social reality."""
74.491	The mind is kind of tricked
74.491	into feeling that it's already done.
77.525	And then because you've felt
77.525	that satisfaction,
79.804	you're less motivated to do
79.804	the actual hard work necessary.
82.776	(Laughter)
84.109	So this goes against conventional wisdom
86.165	that we should tell our friends
86.165	our goals, right?
88.578	So they hold us to it.
91.127	So, let's look at the proof.
	founder of social psychology,
96.11	"called this ""substitution."""
	when it was acknowledged by others,
101.003	it felt real in the mind.
	wrote a whole book about this,
105.26	and in 2009,
106.827	he did some new tests that were published.
109.398	It goes like this:
114.476	Everyone wrote down their personal goal.
116.794	Then half of them announced
116.794	their commitment to this goal to the room,
120.705	and half didn't.
122.76	Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work
124.815	that would directly lead them
124.815	towards their goal,
127.134	but they were told
127.134	that they could stop at any time.
129.602	Now, those who kept their mouths shut
131.509	worked the entire 45 minutes on average,
134.26	and when asked afterward,
135.821	said that they felt
135.821	that they had a long way to go still
138.509	to achieve their goal.
139.686	But those who had announced it
141.26	quit after only 33 minutes, on average,
144.126	and when asked afterward,
145.88	said that they felt much closer
145.88	to achieving their goal.
148.615	So if this is true, what can we do?
151.899	Well, you could resist the temptation
151.899	to announce your goal.
156.26	You can delay the gratification
156.26	that the social acknowledgment brings,
160.568	and you can understand that your mind
160.568	mistakes the talking for the doing.
164.959	But if you do need
164.959	to talk about something,
167.332	you can state it in a way
167.332	that gives you no satisfaction,
171.703	"such as, ""I really want"
171.703	to run this marathon,
173.846	so I need to train five times a week
175.6	"and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"""
177.97	So audience, next time you're
177.97	tempted to tell someone your goal,
181.095	what will you say?
182.269	(Silence)
183.294	Exactly! Well done.
184.57	(Laughter)
186.26	(Applause)
