12.88	I remember the very first time
12.88	I went to a nice restaurant,
15.719	a really nice restaurant.
17.36	It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,
19.52	and I remember beforehand
19.52	the waitress walked around
22	and asked whether we wanted some wine,
23.88	"so I said, ""Sure,"
23.88	"I'll take some white wine."""
26.8	And she immediately said,
28.56	"""Would you like sauvignon blanc"
28.56	"or chardonnay?"""
31.68	And I remember thinking,
33.64	"""Come on, lady,"
33.64	stop with the fancy French words
36.52	"and just give me some white wine."""
39.4	But I used my powers of deduction
41.04	and recognized that chardonnay
41.04	and sauvignon blanc
43.48	were two separate types of white wine,
45.4	and so I told her
45.4	that I would take the chardonnay,
47.84	because frankly that was
47.84	the easiest one to pronounce for me.
51.96	So I had a lot of experiences like that
54.08	during my first couple of years
54.08	as a law student at Yale,
57.48	because, despite all outward appearances,
57.48	I'm a cultural outsider.
61.24	I didn't come from the elites.
62.84	I didn't come from the Northeast
62.84	or from San Francisco.
67.2	I came from a southern Ohio steel town,
69.32	and it's a town that's really
69.32	struggling in a lot of ways,
72.08	ways that are indicative
72.08	of the broader struggles
74.56	of America's working class.
76.72	Heroin has moved in,
78.08	killing a lot of people, people I know.
80.68	Family violence, domestic violence,
80.68	and divorce have torn apart families.
85.4	And there's a very unique
85.4	sense of pessimism that's moved in.
89.6	Think about rising mortality rates
89.6	in these communities
92.24	and recognize that
92.24	for a lot of these folks,
94.44	the problems that they're seeing
96.04	are actually causing rising death rates
96.04	in their own communities,
99.76	so there's a very real sense of struggle.
103.16	I had a very front-row seat
103.16	to that struggle.
105.72	My family has been part of that struggle
105.72	for a very long time.
111.08	I come from a family
111.08	that doesn't have a whole lot of money.
115.44	The addiction that plagued my community
117.88	also plagued my family,
117.88	and even, sadly, my own mom.
121.76	There were a lot of problems
121.76	that I saw in my own family,
125.92	problems caused sometimes
125.92	by a lack of money,
128.8	problems caused sometimes by a lack
128.8	of access to resources and social capital
133.16	that really affected my life.
136.4	If you had looked at my life
136.4	when I was 14 years old
139.2	"and said, ""Well, what's going"
139.2	"to happen to this kid?"""
142.28	you would have concluded
142.28	that I would have struggled
145.16	with what academics call upward mobility.
148.56	So upward mobility is an abstract term,
151.56	but it strikes at something
151.56	that's very core
154.32	at the heart of the American Dream.
156.04	It's the sense,
157.28	and it measures whether kids like me
159.08	who grow up in poor communities
159.08	are going to live a better life,
162.12	whether they're going to have a chance
162.12	to live a materially better existence,
167.52	or whether they're going to stay
167.52	in the circumstances where they came from.
171.08	And one of the things
171.08	we've learned, unfortunately,
173.52	is that upward mobility isn't as high
173.52	as we'd like it to be in this country,
177.48	and interestingly,
177.48	it's very geographically distributed.
182.08	So take Utah, for instance.
184.84	In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,
188.4	very likely to live their share
188.4	and their part in the American Dream.
192.56	But if you think of where I'm from,
194.44	in the South, in Appalachia,
194.44	in southern Ohio,
198.4	it's very unlikely
198.4	that kids like that will rise.
202.64	The American Dream
202.64	in those parts of the country
204.92	is in a very real sense just a dream.
207.96	So why is that happening?
210.12	So one reason is obviously
210.12	economic or structural.
212.96	So you think of these areas.
214.52	They're beset by these
214.52	terrible economic trends,
217.16	built around industries
217.16	like coal and steel
219.8	that make it harder
219.8	for folks to get ahead.
222.32	That's certainly one problem.
223.92	There's also the problem of brain drain,
223.92	where the really talented people,
227.44	because they can't find
227.44	high-skilled work at home,
229.84	end up moving elsewhere,
231.12	so they don't build a business
231.12	or non-profit where they're from,
234.16	they end up going elsewhere
234.16	and taking their talents with them.
237.16	There are failing schools
237.16	in a lot of these communities,
239.84	failing to give kids
239.84	the educational leg up
241.92	that really makes it possible for kids
241.92	to have opportunities later in life.
245.48	These things are all important.
247.04	I don't mean to discount
247.04	these structural barriers.
249.48	But when I look back at my life
249.48	and my community,
251.84	something else was going on,
251.84	something else mattered.
255.84	It's difficult to quantify,
255.84	but it was no less real.
260.12	So for starters, there was
260.12	a very real sense of hopelessness
263.8	in the community that I grew up in.
265.6	There was a sense that kids had
265.6	that their choices didn't matter.
268.76	No matter what happened,
268.76	no matter how hard they worked,
271.44	no matter how hard
271.44	they tried to get ahead,
273.56	nothing good would happen.
276.16	So that's a tough feeling
276.16	to grow up around.
279.24	That's a tough mindset to penetrate,
282.44	and it leads sometimes
282.44	to very conspiratorial places.
287.24	So let's just take one
287.24	political issue that's pretty hot,
291.2	affirmative action.
292.72	So depending on your politics,
292.72	you might think that affirmative action
296.04	is either a wise or an unwise way
296.04	to promote diversity in the workplace
299.44	or the classroom.
300.76	But if you grow up in an area like this,
302.8	you see affirmative action
302.8	as a tool to hold people like you back.
306.56	That's especially true if you're
306.56	a member of the white working class.
309.84	You see it as something
309.84	that isn't just about good or bad policy.
313.28	You see it as something
313.28	that's actively conspiring,
316	where people with political
316	and financial power
318.28	are working against you.
319.92	And there are a lot of ways that you see
319.92	that conspiracy against you --
325.52	perceived, real, but it's there,
328.44	and it warps expectations.
331.04	So if you think about what do you do
331.04	when you grow up in that world,
334.28	you can respond in a couple of ways.
336.04	One, you can say,
336.04	"""I'm not going to work hard,"
338.24	because no matter how hard I work,
338.24	"it's not going to matter."""
341.16	Another thing you might do is say,
342.84	"""Well, I'm not going to go"
342.84	after the traditional markers of success,
346.08	like a university education
346.08	or a prestigious job,
348.44	because the people who care
348.44	about those things are unlike me.
351.36	"They're never going to let me in."""
353.004	When I got admitted to Yale,
353.004	a family member asked me
355.505	if I had pretended to be a liberal
355.505	to get by the admissions committee.
358.84	Seriously.
360.64	And it's obviously not the case
360.64	that there was a liberal box to check
364.68	on the application,
366.2	but it speaks to a very real
366.2	insecurity in these places
369.88	that you have to pretend
369.88	to be somebody you're not
372.28	to get past these various social barriers.
375.08	It's a very significant problem.
377.64	Even if you don't give in
377.64	to that hopelessness,
380.08	even if you think, let's say,
381.92	that your choices matter
381.92	and you want to make the good choices,
385.56	you want to do better
385.56	for yourself and for your family,
388.48	it's sometimes hard
388.48	to even know what those choices are
391.68	when you grow up
391.68	in a community like I did.
393.8	I didn't know, for example,
395.44	that you had to go
395.44	to law school to be a lawyer.
398.36	I didn't know that elite universities,
398.36	as research consistently tells us,
402.32	are cheaper for low-income kids
404.12	because these universities
404.12	have bigger endowments,
406.72	can offer more generous financial aid.
408.92	I remember I learned this
410.2	when I got the financial aid letter
410.2	from Yale for myself,
413.04	tens of thousands of dollars
413.04	in need-based aid,
415.76	which is a term I had never heard before.
417.92	But I turned to my aunt
417.92	when I got that letter and said,
420.6	"""You know, I think this just means"
420.6	that for the first time in my life,
423.92	"being poor has paid really well."""
427.36	So I didn't have access
427.36	to that information
430.2	because the social networks around me
430.2	didn't have access to that information.
433.88	I learned from my community
433.88	how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.
437.56	I learned how to make
437.56	a damn good biscuit recipe.
440.04	The trick, by the way,
440.04	is frozen butter, not warm butter.
444.08	But I didn't learn how to get ahead.
446	I didn't learn how to make
446	the good decisions
448.6	about education and opportunity
450.48	that you need to make
453.2	to actually have a chance
453.2	in this 21st century knowledge economy.
456.4	Economists call the value
456.4	that we gain from our informal networks,
460.56	from our friends and colleagues
460.56	"and family ""social capital."""
464.2	The social capital that I had
464.2	wasn't built for 21st century America,
468.04	and it showed.
470.36	There's something else
470.36	that's really important that's going on
473.32	that our community
473.32	doesn't like to talk about,
475.52	but it's very real.
477.12	Working-class kids are much more likely
479.04	to face what's called
479.04	adverse childhood experiences,
481.8	which is just a fancy word
481.8	for childhood trauma:
486.28	getting hit or yelled at,
486.28	put down by a parent repeatedly,
489.88	watching someone hit or beat your parent,
492.32	watching someone do drugs
492.32	or abuse alcohol.
495.72	These are all instances
495.72	of childhood trauma,
498.28	and they're pretty
498.28	commonplace in my family.
500.96	Importantly, they're not just
500.96	commonplace in my family right now.
504.4	They're also multigenerational.
506.44	So my grandparents,
508.64	the very first time that they had kids,
511.44	they expected that they
511.44	were going to raise them in a way
514.16	that was uniquely good.
515.8	They were middle class,
517.08	they were able to earn
517.08	a good wage in a steel mill.
519.485	But what ended up happening
520.84	is that they exposed their kids
520.84	to a lot of the childhood trauma
523.88	that had gone back many generations.
526.6	My mom was 12 when she saw
526.6	my grandma set my grandfather on fire.
532.12	His crime was that he came home drunk
534.96	after she told him,
536.2	"""If you come home drunk,"
536.2	"I'm gonna kill you."""
539.24	And she tried to do it.
541.44	Think about the way
541.44	that that affects a child's mind.
545.52	And we think of these things
545.52	as especially rare,
548.48	but a study by the Wisconsin
548.48	Children's Trust Fund found
552.48	that 40 percent of low-income kids face
552.48	multiple instances of childhood trauma,
558.8	compared to only 29 percent
558.8	for upper-income kids.
562.12	And think about what that really means.
564.8	If you're a low-income kid,
566.56	almost half of you face multiple
566.56	instances of childhood trauma.
571.04	This is not an isolated problem.
572.88	This is a very significant issue.
575.8	We know what happens
575.8	to the kids who experience that life.
579.92	They're more likely to do drugs,
579.92	more likely to go to jail,
583.24	more likely to drop out of high school,
585.56	and most importantly,
587	they're more likely
587	to do to their children
589.24	what their parents did to them.
591.64	This trauma, this chaos in the home,
594.76	is our culture's
594.76	very worst gift to our children,
598.24	and it's a gift that keeps on giving.
602.28	So you combine all that,
604.12	the hopelessness, the despair,
606.84	the cynicism about the future,
609.2	the childhood trauma,
611.44	the low social capital,
613.36	and you begin to understand why me,
615.68	at the age of 14,
617.28	was ready to become
617.28	just another statistic,
619.64	another kid who failed to beat the odds.
622.64	But something unexpected happened.
625.36	I did beat the odds.
627.12	Things turned up for me.
629.28	I graduated from high school,
629.28	from college, I went to law school,
633.04	and I have a pretty good job now.
635.32	So what happened?
637.32	Well, one thing that happened
637.32	is that my grandparents,
639.88	the same grandparents
639.88	of setting someone on fire fame,
642.44	they really shaped up
642.44	by the time I came around.
645.32	They provided me a stable home,
648.4	a stable family.
649.72	They made sure
650.96	that when my parents weren't able
650.96	to do the things that kids need,
654.12	they stepped in and filled that role.
656.88	My grandma especially
656.88	did two things that really matter.
659.56	One, she provided that peaceful home
659.56	that allowed me to focus on homework
663.08	and the things that kids
663.08	should be focused on.
665.72	But she was also
665.72	this incredibly perceptive woman,
668.12	despite not even having
668.12	a middle school education.
670.52	She recognized the message
670.52	that my community had for me,
673.2	that my choices didn't matter,
675.28	that the deck was stacked against me.
677.12	She once told me,
678.36	"""JD, never be like those losers who think"
678.36	the deck is stacked against them.
682.36	"You can do anything you want to."""
684.72	And yet she recognized
684.72	that life wasn't fair.
687.96	It's hard to strike that balance,
689.6	to tell a kid that life isn't fair,
691.64	but also recognize and enforce in them
691.64	the reality that their choices matter.
696.92	But mamaw was able
696.92	to strike that balance.
701.04	The other thing that really helped
701.04	was the United States Marine Corps.
704.36	So we think of the Marine Corps
704.36	as a military outfit, and of course it is,
707.88	but for me, the US Marine Corps
707.88	was a four-year crash course
710.76	in character education.
712	It taught me how to make a bed,
712	how to do laundry,
714.4	how to wake up early,
714.4	how to manage my finances.
716.68	These are things
716.68	my community didn't teach me.
718.88	I remember when I went
718.88	to go buy a car for the very first time,
721.857	I was offered a dealer's
721.857	low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent,
726.2	and I was ready
726.2	to sign on the dotted line.
729.68	But I didn't take that deal,
731.56	because I went and took it to my officer
733.6	"who told me, ""Stop being an idiot,"
735.76	go to the local credit union,
735.76	"and get a better deal."""
738.28	And so that's what I did.
739.76	But without the Marine Corps,
741.2	I would have never had access
741.2	to that knowledge.
743.48	I would have had
743.48	a financial calamity, frankly.
746.72	The last thing I want to say
746.72	is that I had a lot of good fortune
749.88	in the mentors and people
751.48	who have played
751.48	an important role in my life.
753.64	From the Marines,
753.64	from Ohio State, from Yale,
756.72	from other places,
758	people have really stepped in
759.68	and ensured that they filled
759.68	that social capital gap
762.52	that it was pretty obvious,
762.52	apparently, that I had.
765.48	That comes from good fortune,
767.84	but a lot of children
767.84	aren't going to have that good fortune,
771.16	and I think that raises
771.16	really important questions for all of us
774.88	about how we're going to change that.
777.6	We need to ask questions about
777.6	how we're going to give low-income kids
781.6	who come from a broken home
781.6	access to a loving home.
785.16	We need to ask questions
786.44	about how we're going
786.44	to teach low-income parents
788.8	how to better interact
788.8	with their children,
790.96	with their partners.
792.48	We need to ask questions
792.48	about how we give social capital,
796.96	mentorship to low-income kids
796.96	who don't have it.
800.36	We need to think about
800.36	how we teach working class children
803.44	about not just hard skills,
805.96	like reading, mathematics,
808.08	but also soft skills,
809.44	like conflict resolution
809.44	and financial management.
813.44	Now, I don't have all of the answers.
816.68	I don't know all of the solutions
816.68	to this problem,
820.36	but I do know this:
822.6	in southern Ohio right now,
824.36	there's a kid who is
824.36	anxiously awaiting their dad,
828.16	wondering whether,
828.16	when he comes through the door,
830.56	he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.
834	There's a kid
836.56	whose mom sticks a needle in her arm
838.92	and passes out,
840.44	and he doesn't know
840.44	why she doesn't cook him dinner,
843.36	and he goes to bed hungry that night.
846.4	There's a kid who has
846.4	no hope for the future
850.36	but desperately
850.36	wants to live a better life.
853.64	They just want somebody
853.64	to show it to them.
856.68	I don't have all the answers,
858.56	but I know that unless our society
858.56	starts asking better questions
863.52	about why I was so lucky
865.64	and about how to get that luck
865.64	to more of our communities
868.72	and our country's children,
870.4	we're going to continue
870.4	to have a very significant problem.
873.68	Thank you.
874.92	(Applause)
