12.52	I'm here to talk to you today
14.659	about a story that we have all
14.659	been conditioned to believe
17.795	is not possible.
19.359	It's a story about a living,
19.359	breathing start-up
21.681	flourishing in an unlikely environment:
24.1	the United States government.
25.95	Now, this start-up is fundamentally
25.95	beginning to disrupt
28.608	the way government does
28.608	business from the inside out.
31.12	But before I get there,
31.12	let's start with the problem.
33.644	For me, the problem begins
33.644	with a number: 137.
41.441	a veteran has to wait to have benefits
41.441	processed by the VA.
47.032	Now, in order to file that application
47.032	in the first place,
49.811	she has to navigate
49.811	over 1,000 different websites
53.423	and over 900 different call-in numbers,
56.24	all owned and operated
56.24	by the United States government.
60.073	Now, we live in times
60.073	of incredible change.
63.266	The private sector is constantly changing
65.74	and improving itself all the time.
67.529	For that matter, it's removing
67.529	every single inconvenience in my life
70.991	that I could possibly think of.
72.808	I could be sitting on my couch
72.808	in my apartment,
75.387	and from my phone, I can order
75.387	a warm, gluten-free meal
78.453	that can arrive at my door
78.453	in less than 10 minutes.
81.456	But meanwhile, a working mother
81.456	who depends on food stamps
85.703	to support her family
87.788	has to complete an arduous,
87.788	complicated application
90.951	which she might not even
90.951	be able to do online.
93.436	And the inability of her to do that same
93.436	work from her couch means
97.602	that she might be having to take
97.602	days or hours off of work
100.706	that she can't spare.
103.173	And this growing dichotomy
105.713	between the beneficiaries
105.713	of the tech revolution
108.031	and those it's left behind
109.45	is one of the greatest
109.45	challenges of our time --
111.996	(Applause)
117.607	Because government's failure
117.607	to deliver digital services that work
121.886	is disproportionately impacting
121.886	the very people who need it most.
126.464	It's impacting the students
126.464	trying to go to college,
129.107	the single mothers
129.107	trying to get health care,
131.185	the veterans coming home from battle.
132.986	They can't get what they need
132.986	when they need it.
136.082	And for these Americans,
137.492	government is more than just
137.492	a presidential election every four years.
141.171	Government is a lifeline
141.171	that provides services they need
144.261	and depend on and deserve.
146.61	Which is, quite frankly,
147.801	why government needs to get
147.801	its shit together and catch up.
151.008	Just saying.
152.191	(Applause)
155.95	Now, this wasn't always a problem
155.95	I was passionate about.
158.895	When I joined President Obama's
158.895	campaign in 2008,
161.679	we brought the tech industry's
161.679	best practices into politics.
164.86	We earned more money,
166.615	we engaged more volunteers
168.36	and we earned more votes
168.36	than any political campaign in history.
172.058	We were a cutting-edge start-up
172.058	that changed the game of politics forever.
175.864	So when the President asked
175.864	a small group of us
178.147	to bring that very same disruption
178.147	directly into government,
181.022	I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,
182.913	but I was eager and showed up
182.913	ready to get to work.
186.791	Now, on my first day in DC,
189.465	my first day in government,
191.999	I walked into the office
191.999	and they handed me a laptop.
194.964	And the laptop was running Windows 98.
197.448	(Laughter)
198.846	I mean, three entire presidential
198.846	elections had come and gone
202.562	since the government had updated
202.562	the operating system on that computer.
205.943	Three elections!
208.093	Which is when we realized
209.662	this problem was a whole lot bigger
209.662	than we ever could have imagined.
213.75	Let me paint the picture for you.
216.29	The federal government is the largest
216.29	institution in the world.
220.097	It spends over 86 billion dollars
220.097	a year -- 86 billion --
224.693	on federal IT projects.
226.763	For context:
227.938	that is more than the entire
227.938	venture capital industry spends
230.883	annually -- on everything.
233.547	Now, the problem here
235.413	is that we the taxpayers
235.413	are not getting what we pay for,
239.548	because 94 percent of federal IT projects
243.389	are over budget or behind schedule.
247.088	For those of you keeping score,
248.601	yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
250.934	(Laughter)
253.045	There's another problem:
	seeing the light of day.
258.412	They are completely scrapped or abandoned.
261.014	Now, this is a very existentially
261.014	painful moment for any organization,
265.796	because it means as government
265.796	continues to operate
268.217	as it's programmed to do,
269.456	failure is nearly inevitable.
271.482	And when the status quo
271.482	is the riskiest option,
274.97	that means there is simply no other choice
277.042	than radical disruption.
280.039	So, what do we do about it?
282.733	How do we fix this?
285.065	Well, the irony of all of this
287.706	is that we actually don't have to look
287.706	any further than our backyard,
291.003	because right here in America
291.003	are the very ideas, the very people,
294.892	who have swept our world
294.892	into a radically different place
297.586	than it was two decades ago.
299.276	So what would it look like
301.581	if it was actually as easy to get
301.581	student loans or veterans' benefits
304.945	as it is to order cat food to my house?
308.358	What would it look like
310.628	if there was an easy pathway
310.628	for the very entrepreneurs and innovators
314.585	who have disrupted our tech sector
316.372	to come and disrupt their government?
318.989	Well, my friends,
318.989	here's where we get to talk
321.143	about some of the exciting
321.143	new formulas we've discovered
323.814	for creating change in government.
325.511	Enter the United States Digital Service.
328.329	The United States Digital Service
328.329	is a new network of start-ups,
331.823	a team of teams,
333.402	organizing themselves across government
333.402	to create radical change.
338.352	The mission of the United States
338.352	Digital Service is to help government
341.699	deliver world-class digital services
343.811	for students, immigrants,
343.811	children, the elderly -- everybody --
348.364	at dramatically lower costs.
351.664	We are essentially trying to build
351.664	a more awesome government,
355.163	for the people, by the people, today.
357.288	We don't care -- (Applause) Thank you.
359.162	(Applause)
361.378	Who doesn't want a more
361.378	awesome government, right?
364.632	We don't care about politics.
367.154	We care about making
367.154	government work better,
369.368	because it's the only one we've got.
371.454	(Applause)
373.883	Now, you can think of our team --
373.883	well, it's pretty funny --
377.13	you can think
377.13	of our team a little bit like
379.206	the Peace Corps meets DARPA
379.206	meets SEAL Team 6.
382.316	We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,
384.103	but instead of traveling to crazy,
384.103	interesting, far-off places,
387.1	you spend a lot of time indoors,
387.1	behind computers,
389.513	helping restore the fabric
389.513	of our democracy.
391.782	(Laughter)
393.859	Now, this team -- our playbook
393.859	for the United States Digital Service
398.197	is pretty simple.
400.053	The first play is we recruit
400.053	the very best talent
403.681	our country has to offer,
405.418	and recruit them for short tours
405.418	of duty inside government.
408.447	These are the very people who have helped
408.447	build the products and companies
411.973	that have made our tech sector amongst
411.973	the most innovative in the world.
415.38	Second, we pair these incredible
415.38	people from the tech core
418.573	with the dedicated civil servants
418.573	already inside government
421.463	on the ground creating change.
423.605	Third, we strategically deploy them
423.605	in a targeted formation
427.515	at the most mission-critical,
427.515	life-changing, important services
430.699	that government offers.
432.23	And finally, we give them
432.23	massive air cover,
434.897	from the leadership inside the agencies
436.796	all the way up to the President himself,
439.186	to transform these services
439.186	for the better.
442.437	Now, this team is beginning to disrupt
445.276	how government does business
445.276	from the inside out.
448.538	If you study classic
448.538	patterns of disruption,
451.569	one very common pattern is rather simple.
454.252	It's to take something that has become
454.252	routine and standard in one industry
457.879	and apply it to another
457.879	where it's a radical departure
460.443	from the status quo.
461.736	Think about what Airbnb took
461.736	that was normal from hospitality
465.076	and revolutionized my apartment.
468.058	The United States Digital Service
468.058	is doing exactly that.
470.948	We are taking what Silicon Valley
470.948	and the private sector has learned
474.266	through a ton of hard work
475.592	about how to build
475.592	planetary-scale digital services
478.227	that delight users at lower cost,
480.115	and we're applying that to government,
481.979	where it is a radical departure
481.979	from the status quo.
484.899	Now, the good news is:
487.416	it's starting to work.
489.768	We know this because we can
489.768	already see the results
492.222	from some of our early projects,
492.222	like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,
495.883	when that went off the rails.
497.497	Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place
497.497	that we ran this play,
501.225	and today we are taking that same play
503.106	and scaling it across a large number
504.876	of government's most important
504.876	citizen-facing services.
509.077	Now, if I can take a moment
511.348	and brag about the team for a second --
513.475	it is the highest
513.475	concentration of badasses
516.086	I could have ever dreamed of.
518.314	We have top talent from Google,
518.314	Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,
522.166	all on staff today,
524.351	all choosing to join their government.
527.699	And what's incredible is,
528.963	everybody is as eager and kind
528.963	as they are intelligent.
532.922	And I might add, by the way,
532.922	over half of us are women.
536.406	(Applause)
543.244	The best way to understand this strategy
545.607	is actually to walk through
545.607	a couple of examples
547.891	of how it's working out in the wild.
549.645	I'm going to give you
549.645	two examples quickly.
551.681	The first one is about immigration.
553.986	This, my friends, is your typical
553.986	immigration application.
557.625	Yes, you guessed it --
558.812	it's almost entirely paper-based.
561.31	In the best case,
562.485	the application takes about six
562.485	to eight months to process.
565.317	It is physically shipped thousands
565.317	of miles -- thousands of miles! --
569.174	between no less than six
569.174	processing centers.
572.188	Now, little story:
574.168	about a decade ago,
575.343	the government thought
575.343	that if it brought this system online,
578.244	it could save taxpayer dollars
578.244	and provide a better service,
581.142	which was a great idea.
582.317	So, the typical government process began.
585.922	Six years and 1.2 billion dollars later,
590.287	no working product was delivered --
592.592	"1.2 billion with a ""B."""
595.48	Now at this point, the agency responsible,
598.046	US Citizenship and Immigration Services,
599.993	could have kept pouring money
599.993	into the failing program.
602.781	Sadly, that's what often happens.
604.448	That's the status quo today.
606.075	But they didn't.
607.26	The dedicated civil servants
607.26	inside the agency
609.502	decided to stand up and call for change.
611.825	We deployed a small team
611.825	of just six people,
614.497	and what many people don't know is
616.203	that's the same size as the rescue
616.203	effort of Healthcare.gov --
619.158	just six people.
620.403	And that team jumped in, side-by-side,
622.258	to support the agency
622.258	in transitioning this project
624.996	into more modern business practices,
624.996	more modern development practices.
629.216	Now, in non-tech speak,
630.405	what that basically means
630.405	is taking big, multi-year projects
634.411	and breaking them up
634.411	into bite-sized chunks,
636.75	so that way we can reduce the risk
638.41	and actually start to see results
638.41	every couple of weeks,
641.071	instead of waiting
641.071	in a black box for years.
643.256	So within less than three months
643.256	of our team being on the ground,
646.486	we were already able to push
646.486	our first products to production.
650.152	The first one, this is the form I-90.
652.788	This is used to file
652.788	for your replacement green card.
656.208	Now, for immigrant visa holders,
657.797	a replacement green card is a big deal.
660.709	Your green card is your proof
660.709	of identification,
662.991	it's your work authorization,
664.404	it's the proof that you can
664.404	be here in this country.
666.877	So waiting six months while the government
666.877	processes the replacement
670.122	is not cool.
671.346	I'm excited to tell you that today,
673.061	you can now, for the first time,
673.061	file for a replacement green card
676.242	entirely online without anyone
676.242	touching a piece of paper.
679.469	It is faster, it is cheaper,
681.511	and it's a better user experience
681.511	for the applicant
683.932	and the government employees alike.
685.844	(Applause)
692.677	Another one, quickly.
693.852	Last fall, we just released
693.852	a brand-new practice civics test.
697.123	So as part of becoming a US citizen,
699.387	you have to pass a civics test.
701.761	For anyone who has taken this test,
701.761	it can be quite the stressful process.
706.123	So our team released a very easy,
706.123	simple-to-use tool in plain language
710.734	to help people prepare,
712.914	to help ease their nerves,
714.612	to help them feel more confident
716.366	in taking the next step
716.366	in pursuing their American dream.
719.821	Because all of this work,
719.821	all of this work on immigration,
722.756	is about taking complicated processes
722.756	and making them more human.
727.527	The other day, one of the dedicated
727.527	civil servants on the ground
730.581	said something incredibly profound.
733.483	She said that she's never been
733.483	this hopeful or optimistic
736.73	about a project in her entire
736.73	time in government.
740.101	And she's been doing this for 30 years.
743.285	That is exactly the kind of hope
743.285	and culture change
745.73	we are trying to create.
747.435	For my second example, I want to bring
747.435	it back to veterans for a second,
750.943	and what we are doing to build them a VA
752.917	that is worthy of their service
752.917	and their sacrifice.
756.129	I'm proud to say
756.129	that just a few months ago,
758.321	we released a brand-new beta
760.241	of a new website, Vets.gov.
762.92	Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website
764.929	that brings all of the online services
764.929	a veteran needs into one place.
768.689	One website, not thousands.
772.166	The site is a work in progress,
772.166	but it's significant progress,
775.189	because it's designed
775.189	with the users who matter most:
777.8	the veterans themselves.
779.729	This might sound incredibly obvious,
779.729	because it should be,
782.546	but sadly, this isn't
782.546	normal for government.
784.792	Far too often, product decisions
784.792	are made by committees of stakeholders
788.26	who do their best to represent
788.26	the interests of the user,
790.966	but they're not necessarily
790.966	the users themselves.
793.294	So our team at the VA went out,
793.294	we looked at the data,
795.859	we talked to veterans themselves
797.547	and we started simple and small,
799.159	with the two most important services
799.159	that matter most to them:
802.567	education benefits
802.567	and disability benefits.
805.873	I'm proud to say that they are
805.873	live on the site today,
808.541	and as the team continues
808.541	to streamline more services,
811.103	they will be ported over here,
811.103	and the old sites, shut down.
813.978	(Applause)
819.596	To me, this is what change
819.596	looks like in 2016.
824.493	When you walk out of the Oval Office,
826.291	the first time I was ever
826.291	there, I noticed a quote
828.656	the President had embroidered on the rug.
830.647	It's the classic JFK quote.
832.576	"It says, ""No problem of human destiny"
832.576	"is beyond human beings."""
837.882	It's true.
839.256	We have the tools to solve these problems.
842.423	We have the tools to come together
842.423	as a society, as a country,
845.732	and to fix this together.
848.073	Yes, it's hard.
850.034	It's particularly hard
850.034	when we have to fight,
852.161	when we have to refuse to succumb
852.161	to the belief that things won't change.
856.626	But in my experience,
858.38	it's often the hardest things
858.38	that are the most worth doing,
861.864	because if we don't do them,
863.693	who will?
865.13	This is on us,
867.162	all of us, together,
869.082	because government is not
869.082	an abstract institution or a concept.
872.686	Our government is us.
875.79	(Applause)
880.541	Today, it is no longer a question
882.614	of if change is possible.
885.422	"The question is not, ""Can we?"""
