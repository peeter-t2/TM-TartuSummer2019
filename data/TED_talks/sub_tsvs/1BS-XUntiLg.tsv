16.26	Trees epitomize stasis.
19.26	Trees are rooted in the ground in one place
21.26	for many human generations,
24.26	but if we shift our perspective
26.26	from the trunk to the twigs,
28.26	trees become very dynamic entities,
30.26	moving and growing.
32.26	And I decided to explore this movement
34.26	by turning trees into artists.
36.26	I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
39.26	I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,
42.26	and that produced art.
44.26	The piece of art you see on your left
46.26	is painted by a western red cedar
48.26	and that on your right by a Douglas fir,
50.26	and what I learned was that different species
52.26	have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
55.26	But I was also interested in the movement of trees
57.26	and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,
61.26	so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --
64.26	which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,
67.26	I simply measured and summed
69.26	each of those lines.
71.26	I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch
74.26	and the number of branches per tree
76.26	and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
79.26	And so I was able to calculate
81.26	how far a single tree moved in a single year.
84.26	You might have a guess.
86.26	The answer is actually 186,540 miles,
89.26	or seven times around the globe.
92.26	And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk
95.26	to the many dynamic twigs,
97.26	we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,
100.26	but rather extremely dynamic.
103.26	And I began to think about ways that
105.26	we might consider this lesson of trees,
107.26	to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,
110.26	but which cry for change and dynamicism,
113.26	and one of those entities is our prisons.
116.26	Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws
118.26	are stuck, confined behind bars.
121.26	And our prison system itself is stuck.
124.26	The United States has over 2.3 million
126.26	incarcerated men and women.
128.26	That number is rising.
130.26	Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,
135.26	Funds for education, for training
137.26	and for rehabilitation are declining,
139.26	so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
143.26	I decided to ask whether the lesson
145.26	I had learned from trees as artists
147.26	could be applied to a static institution
149.26	such as our prisons,
151.26	and I think the answer is yes.
153.26	In the year 2007,
155.26	I started a partnership
157.26	with the Washington State Department of Corrections.
160.26	Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,
163.26	sustainability and conservation projects
166.26	to four state prisons.
168.26	We give science lectures,
170.26	and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures
172.26	instead of watching television or weightlifting.
176.26	That, I think, is movement.
178.26	We partnered with the Nature Conservancy
180.26	for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center
183.26	to grow endangered prairie plants
185.26	for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
188.26	That, I think, is movement.
190.26	We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife
193.26	to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --
195.26	for later release into protected wetlands.
198.26	That, I think, is movement.
201.26	And just recently, we've begun to work with
203.26	those men who are segregated
205.26	in what we call Supermax facilities.
207.26	They've incurred violent infractions
209.26	by becoming violent with guards
211.26	and with other prisoners.
213.26	They're kept in bare cells like this
215.26	for 23 hours a day.
217.26	When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,
220.26	they're placed in immobile booths like this.
223.26	For one hour a day
225.26	they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
228.26	Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants
230.26	and frogs into these environments,
232.26	we are bringing images of nature
234.26	into these exercise yards,
236.26	putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact
238.26	with visual images of nature.
241.26	This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,
244.26	and he's providing input on the types of images
247.26	that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates
249.26	more serene, more calm,
252.26	less apt to violence.
255.26	And so what we see, I think,
257.26	is that small, collective movements of change
260.26	can perhaps move
262.26	an entity such as our own prison system
265.26	in a direction of hope.
267.26	We know that trees are static entities
270.26	when we look at their trunks.
272.26	But if trees can create art,
274.26	if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,
277.26	if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,
280.26	then perhaps there are other static entities
283.26	that we hold inside ourselves,
286.26	like grief, like addictions,
288.26	like racism,
290.26	that can also change.
292.26	Thank you very much.
294.26	(Applause)
