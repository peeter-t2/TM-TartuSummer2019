16.069	So the first robot
16.069	to talk about is called STriDER.
19.267	It stands for Self-excited
19.267	Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.
22.76	It's a robot that has three legs,
22.76	which is inspired by nature.
27.76	But have you seen anything in nature,
27.76	an animal that has three legs?
31.195	Probably not. So why do I call this
31.195	a biologically inspired robot?
35.089	How would it work?
36.275	But before that,
36.275	let's look at pop culture.
38.461	So, you know H.G. Wells's
38.461	"""War of the Worlds,"" novel and movie."
41.953	And what you see over here
41.953	is a very popular video game,
45.298	and in this fiction, they describe
45.298	these alien creatures and robots
49.022	that have three legs that terrorize Earth.
51.308	But my robot, STriDER,
51.308	does not move like this.
54.867	This is an actual dynamic
54.867	simulation animation.
57.942	I'm going to show you how the robot works.
60.023	It flips its body 180 degrees
62.439	and it swings its leg between the two legs
64.521	and catches the fall.
65.704	So that's how it walks.
66.89	But when you look at us
66.89	human beings, bipedal walking,
69.626	what you're doing is,
70.808	you're not really using muscle
70.808	to lift your leg and walk like a robot.
74.919	What you're doing is,
74.919	you swing your leg and catch the fall,
78.28	stand up again, swing your leg
78.28	and catch the fall.
80.76	You're using your built-in dynamics,
80.76	the physics of your body,
83.951	just like a pendulum.
85.726	We call that the concept
85.726	of passive dynamic locomotion.
89.108	What you're doing is, when you stand up,
91.27	potential energy to kinetic energy,
93.375	potential energy to kinetic energy.
95.376	It's a constantly falling process.
97.377	So even though there is nothing
97.377	in nature that looks like this,
100.45	really, we're inspired by biology
100.45	and applying the principles of walking
104.603	to this robot.
105.784	Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.
107.785	What you see here,
107.785	this is what we want to do next.
110.222	We want to fold up the legs
110.222	and shoot it up for long-range motion.
113.76	And it deploys legs --
113.76	"it looks almost like ""Star Wars"" --"
116.578	so when it lands, it absorbs
116.578	the shock and starts walking.
119.466	What you see over here, this yellow thing,
119.466	this is not a death ray.
122.695	(Laughter)
123.731	This is just to show you
124.914	that if you have cameras
124.914	or different types of sensors,
127.625	because it's 1.8 meters tall,
129.166	you can see over obstacles like bushes
129.166	and those kinds of things.
132.276	So we have two prototypes.
133.647	The first version,
133.647	in the back, that's STriDER I.
136.614	The one in front,
136.614	the smaller, is STriDER II.
138.805	The problem we had with STriDER I is,
138.805	it was just too heavy in the body.
142.337	We had so many motors aligning the joints
144.945	and those kinds of things.
146.223	So we decided to synthesize
146.223	a mechanical mechanism
149.447	so we could get rid of all the motors,
149.447	and with a single motor,
152.54	we can coordinate all the motions.
154.241	It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
154.241	instead of using mechatronics.
157.642	So with this, now the top body
157.642	is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.
161.078	This was the very first successful step.
163.161	It's still not perfected,
163.161	its coffee falls down,
165.853	so we still have a lot of work to do.
168.685	The second robot I want
168.685	to talk about is called IMPASS.
171.405	It stands for Intelligent Mobility
171.405	Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
175.888	It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
178.507	So think of a rimless wheel
178.507	or a spoke wheel,
182.388	but the spokes individually
182.388	move in and out of the hub;
185.389	so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
187.5	We're literally reinventing
187.5	the wheel here.
189.766	Let me demonstrate how it works.
192.253	So in this video we're using an approach
192.253	called the reactive approach.
196.126	Just simply using
196.126	the tactile sensors on the feet,
199.127	it's trying to walk
199.127	over a changing terrain,
201.961	a soft terrain where it pushes
201.961	down and changes.
204.685	And just by the tactile information,
206.906	it successfully crosses
206.906	over these types of terrains.
209.685	But, when it encounters
209.685	a very extreme terrain --
213.514	in this case, this obstacle
213.514	is more than three times the height
217.451	of the robot --
218.645	then it switches to a deliberate mode,
220.543	where it uses a laser range finder
220.543	and camera systems
223.381	to identify the obstacle and the size.
225.231	And it carefully plans
225.231	the motion of the spokes
228.239	and coordinates it so it can show
228.239	this very impressive mobility.
231.972	You probably haven't seen
231.972	anything like this out there.
234.637	This is a very high-mobility robot
234.637	that we developed called IMPASS.
239.873	Ah, isn't that cool?
241.685	When you drive your car,
245.003	when you steer your car, you use
245.003	a method called Ackermann steering.
248.949	The front wheels rotate like this.
250.824	For most small-wheeled robots,
253.363	they use a method
253.363	called differential steering
255.636	where the left and right wheel
255.636	turn the opposite direction.
258.517	For IMPASS, we can do many,
258.517	many different types of motion.
261.439	For example, in this case,
262.732	even though the left and right
262.732	wheels are connected
265.156	with a single axle rotating
265.156	at the same angle of velocity,
267.946	we simply change the length
267.946	of the spoke, it affects the diameter,
271.104	then can turn to the left
271.104	and to the right.
273.215	These are just some examples
273.215	of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.
276.592	This robot is called CLIMBeR:
278.39	Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
278.39	Matching Behavior Robot.
281.814	I've been talking
281.814	to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --
284.965	at JPL, they are famous
284.965	for the Mars rovers --
287.139	and the scientists,
287.139	geologists always tell me
289.534	that the real interesting science,
289.534	the science-rich sites,
292.685	are always at the cliffs.
294.22	But the current rovers cannot get there.
296.194	So, inspired by that,
296.194	we wanted to build a robot
298.701	that can climb
298.701	a structured cliff environment.
301.842	So this is CLIMBeR.
303.09	It has three legs.
304.625	It's probably difficult to see, but it has
304.625	a winch and a cable at the top.
308.232	It tries to figure out
308.232	the best place to put its foot.
310.837	And then once it figures that out,
312.496	in real time, it calculates
312.496	the force distribution:
315.497	how much force it needs
315.497	to exert to the surface
318.044	so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
320.045	Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,
322.21	and then with the winch,
322.21	it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.
326.045	Also for search and rescue
326.045	applications as well.
328.685	Five years ago,
328.685	I actually worked at NASA JPL
331.128	during the summer as a faculty fellow.
333.002	And they already had
333.002	a six-legged robot called LEMUR.
336.476	So this is actually based on that.
338.14	This robot is called MARS:
339.455	Multi-Appendage Robotic System.
341.096	It's a hexapod robot.
342.358	We developed our adaptive gait planner.
344.359	We actually have a very interesting
344.359	payload on there.
346.908	The students like to have fun.
348.379	And here you can see that it's walking
348.379	over unstructured terrain.
351.498	(Motor sound)
352.639	It's trying to walk
352.639	on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,
355.46	but depending on the moisture content
355.46	or the grain size of the sand,
360.132	the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
360.132	so it tries to adapt its gait
364	to successfully cross
364	over these kind of things.
366.264	It also does some fun stuff.
367.795	As you can imagine,
367.795	we get so many visitors visiting our lab.
371.304	So when the visitors come,
371.304	MARS walks up to the computer,
374.06	"starts typing, ""Hello, my name is MARS."
376.132	Welcome to RoMeLa,
377.685	the Robotics Mechanisms
377.685	"Laboratory at Virginia Tech."""
380.322	(Laughter)
381.816	This robot is an amoeba robot.
383.965	Now, we don't have enough time
383.965	to go into technical details,
386.877	I'll just show you
386.877	some of the experiments.
388.958	These are some of the early
388.958	feasibility experiments.
391.494	We store potential energy
391.494	to the elastic skin to make it move,
394.603	or use active tension cords
394.603	to make it move forward and backward.
398.43	It's called ChIMERA.
399.611	We also have been working
399.611	with some scientists and engineers
402.647	from UPenn
403.822	to come up with a chemically actuated
403.822	version of this amoeba robot.
407.679	We do something to something,
409.586	and just like magic, it moves.
412.886	"""The Blob."""
415.193	This robot is a very recent project.
416.994	It's called RAPHaEL:
418.169	Robotic Air-Powered Hand
418.169	with Elastic Ligaments.
420.88	There are a lot of really neat,
420.88	very good robotic hands
423.903	out there on the market.
425.09	The problem is,
425.09	they're just too expensive --
427.294	tens of thousands of dollars.
428.723	So for prosthesis applications
428.723	it's probably not too practical,
431.768	because it's not affordable.
433.137	We wanted to tackle this problem
433.137	in a very different direction.
436.635	Instead of using electrical motors,
436.635	electromechanical actuators,
439.708	we're using compressed air.
441.488	We developed these novel actuators
441.488	for the joints, so it's compliant.
444.959	You can actually change the force,
446.685	simply just changing the air pressure.
448.535	And it can actually crush
448.535	an empty soda can.
450.749	It can pick up very delicate
450.749	objects like a raw egg,
453.823	or in this case, a lightbulb.
456.05	The best part: it took only 200 dollars
456.05	to make the first prototype.
461.166	This robot is actually
461.166	a family of snake robots
463.938	that we call HyDRAS,
465.33	Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
465.33	Articulated Serpentine.
468.065	This is a robot that can climb structures.
470.26	This is a HyDRAS's arm.
472.367	It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.
474.4	But the cool part is the user interface.
476.772	The cable over there,
476.772	that's an optical fiber.
479.539	This student, it's probably
479.539	her first time using it,
481.999	but she can articulate it
481.999	in many different ways.
484.38	So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
484.38	there are roadside bombs.
487.867	Currently, you send these remotely
487.867	controlled vehicles that are armed.
491.902	It takes really a lot of time
491.902	and it's expensive to train the operator
495.465	to operate this complex arm.
497.227	In this case, it's very intuitive;
499.218	this student, probably
499.218	his first time using it,
501.51	is doing very complex manipulation tasks,
503.512	picking up objects and doing
503.512	manipulation, just like that.
506.897	Very intuitive.
510.025	Now, this robot
510.025	is currently our star robot.
512.646	We actually have a fan club
512.646	for the robot, DARwIn:
515.655	Dynamic Anthropomorphic
515.655	Robot with Intelligence.
518.58	As you know, we're very interested
518.58	in human walking,
522.487	so we decided to build
522.487	a small humanoid robot.
524.703	This was in 2004; at that time,
526.489	this was something really,
526.489	really revolutionary.
528.783	This was more of a feasibility study:
530.608	What kind of motors should we use?
530.608	Is it even possible?
533.283	What kinds of controls should we do?
535.041	This does not have any sensors,
535.041	so it's an open-loop control.
538.585	For those who probably know,
538.585	if you don't have any sensors
541.379	and there's any disturbances,
541.379	you know what happens.
543.976	(Laughter)
546.113	Based on that success, the following year
546.113	we did the proper mechanical design,
551.361	starting from kinematics.
552.609	And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
555.543	It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.
557.878	However, still, as you can see,
557.878	it has a cord, an umbilical cord.
561.259	So we're still using
561.259	an external power source
563.455	and external computation.
566.002	So in 2006, now it's really
566.002	time to have fun.
569.337	Let's give it intelligence.
570.82	We give it all the computing
570.82	power it needs:
572.965	a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
572.965	two FireWire cameras,
575.519	rate gyros, accelerometers,
575.519	four forced sensors on the foot,
578.389	lithium polymer batteries --
579.763	and now DARwIn II
579.763	is completely autonomous.
583.406	It is not remote controlled.
583.406	There's no tethers.
586.121	It looks around, searches for the ball ...
586.121	looks around, searches for the ball,
589.878	and it tries to play a game of soccer
589.878	autonomously -- artificial intelligence.
594.831	Let's see how it does.
596.009	This was our very first trial, and ...
597.98	(Video) Spectators: Goal!
603.498	Dennis Hong: There is actually
603.498	a competition called RoboCup.
606.472	I don't know how many of you
606.472	have heard about RoboCup.
609.083	It's an international autonomous
609.083	robot soccer competition.
613.481	And the actual goal of RoboCup is,
616.253	by the year 2050,
618.47	we want to have full-size,
618.47	autonomous humanoid robots
622.225	play soccer against the human
622.225	World Cup champions
625.323	and win.
626.5	(Laughter)
627.556	It's a true, actual goal.
628.798	It's a very ambitious goal,
628.798	but we truly believe we can do it.
632.719	This is last year in China.
634.477	We were the very first team
634.477	in the United States that qualified
637.514	in the humanoid RoboCup competition.
639.338	This is this year in Austria.
641.542	You're going to see the action
641.542	is three against three,
644.133	completely autonomous.
645.348	(Video) (Crowd groans)
646.463	DH: There you go. Yes!
648.591	The robots track and they team-play
648.591	amongst themselves.
653.194	It's very impressive.
654.369	It's really a research event,
655.869	packaged in a more exciting
655.869	competition event.
660.133	What you see here is the beautiful
660.133	Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.
663.685	This is for the best humanoid.
665.228	We'd like to bring this, for the first
665.228	time, to the United States next year,
668.921	so wish us luck.
670.1	(Applause)
671.16	Thank you.
672.336	(Applause)
674.441	DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.
676.533	Last year, it actually conducted
676.533	the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra
680.273	for the holiday concert.
682.685	This is the next generation
682.685	robot, DARwIn IV,
685.685	much smarter, faster, stronger.
688.685	And it's trying to show off its ability:
690.686	"""I'm macho, I'm strong."""
692.507	(Laughter)
693.975	"""I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,"
693.975	"martial art movements."""
698.224	(Laughter)
701.685	And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.
703.644	Again, you'll be able
703.644	to see it in the lobby.
705.803	We truly believe this will be
705.803	the very first running humanoid robot
709.019	in the United States.
710.194	So stay tuned.
711.372	All right. So I showed you
711.372	some of our exciting robots at work.
714.397	So, what is the secret of our success?
716.609	Where do we come up with these ideas?
718.45	How do we develop these kinds of ideas?
720.367	We have a fully autonomous vehicle
722.181	that can drive into urban environments.
724.081	We won a half a million dollars
724.081	in the DARPA Urban Challenge.
727.004	We also have the world's very first
727.004	vehicle that can be driven by the blind.
730.685	We call it the Blind Driver
730.685	Challenge, very exciting.
733.233	And many, many other robotics
733.233	projects I want to talk about.
736.429	These are just the awards
736.429	that we won in 2007 fall
739.09	from robotics competitions
739.09	and those kinds of things.
741.685	So really, we have five secrets.
743.602	First is: Where do we get inspiration?
746.062	Where do we get this spark of imagination?
748.165	This is a true story, my personal story.
750.21	At night, when I go to bed,
750.21	at three, four in the morning,
753.011	I lie down, close my eyes,
753.011	and I see these lines and circles
755.924	and different shapes floating around.
757.742	And they assemble, and they form
757.742	these kinds of mechanisms.
760.529	"And I think, ""Ah, this is cool."""
762.161	So right next to my bed
762.161	I keep a notebook, a journal,
765.062	with a special pen
765.062	that has an LED light on it,
767.442	because I don't want to turn on the light
767.442	and wake up my wife.
770.503	So I see this, scribble everything down,
770.503	draw things, and go to bed.
773.796	Every day in the morning,
773.796	the first thing I do,
776.21	before my first cup of coffee,
776.21	before I brush my teeth,
778.841	I open my notebook.
780.027	Many times it's empty;
780.027	sometimes I have something there.
782.714	If something's there, sometimes it's junk.
784.804	But most of the time,
784.804	I can't read my handwriting.
787.185	Four in the morning --
787.185	what do you expect, right?
789.533	So I need to decipher what I wrote.
791.461	But sometimes I see
791.461	this ingenious idea in there,
794.685	and I have this eureka moment.
796.194	I directly run to my home office,
796.194	sit at my computer,
798.734	I type in the ideas, I sketch things out
800.735	and I keep a database of ideas.
803.288	So when we have these calls for proposals,
805.673	I try to find a match
805.673	between my potential ideas
809.267	and the problem.
810.451	If there's a match,
810.451	we write a research proposal,
812.792	get the research funding in,
814.163	and that's how we start
814.163	our research programs.
816.347	But just a spark of imagination
816.347	is not good enough.
818.864	How do we develop these kinds of ideas?
820.768	At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
820.768	and Mechanisms Laboratory,
823.572	we have these fantastic
823.572	brainstorming sessions.
826.208	So we gather around, we discuss problems
826.208	and solutions and talk about it.
830.567	But before we start,
830.567	we set this golden rule.
833.568	The rule is:
835.241	nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.
838.242	Nobody criticizes any opinion.
840.685	This is important, because many times,
840.685	students fear or feel uncomfortable
844.256	about how others might think
844.256	about their opinions and thoughts.
847.549	So once you do this, it is amazing
847.549	how the students open up.
851.363	They have these wacky, cool,
851.363	crazy, brilliant ideas,
854.685	and the whole room is just electrified
854.685	with creative energy.
858.138	And this is how we develop our ideas.
860.998	Well, we're running out of time.
862.579	One more thing I want to talk about is,
864.505	you know, just a spark of idea
864.505	and development is not good enough.
867.685	There was a great TED moment --
867.685	I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?
872.42	He gave a talk about how education
872.42	and school kill creativity.
876.882	Well, actually,
876.882	there's two sides to the story.
879.685	So there is only so much one can do
879.685	with just ingenious ideas
884.922	and creativity
884.922	and good engineering intuition.
887.962	If you want to go beyond a tinkering,
889.78	if you want to go
889.78	beyond a hobby of robotics
891.954	and really tackle
891.954	the grand challenges of robotics
895.419	through rigorous research,
896.685	we need more than that.
897.864	This is where school comes in.
899.902	Batman, fighting against the bad guys,
902.42	he has his utility belt,
902.42	he has his grappling hook,
904.837	he has all different kinds of gadgets.
906.685	For us roboticists,
906.685	engineers and scientists,
909.122	these tools are the courses
909.122	and classes you take in class.
913.303	Math, differential equations.
915.329	I have linear algebra, science, physics --
918.093	even, nowadays, chemistry
918.093	and biology, as you've seen.
921.085	These are all the tools we need.
922.867	So the more tools you have, for Batman,
924.767	more effective at fighting the bad guys,
926.768	for us, more tools to attack
926.768	these kinds of big problems.
930.842	So education is very important.
933.828	Also -- it's not only about that.
936.449	You also have to work really, really hard.
938.541	So I always tell my students,
940.018	"""Work smart, then work hard."""
942.093	This picture in the back --
942.093	this is three in the morning.
944.841	I guarantee if you come
944.841	to our lab at 3, 4am,
947.194	we have students working there,
948.774	not because I tell them to,
948.774	but because we are having too much fun.
952.007	Which leads to the last topic:
953.685	do not forget to have fun.
955.578	That's really the secret of our success,
955.578	we're having too much fun.
958.815	I truly believe that highest productivity
958.815	comes when you're having fun,
962.305	and that's what we're doing.
963.685	And there you go.
964.863	Thank you so much.
966.054	(Applause)
