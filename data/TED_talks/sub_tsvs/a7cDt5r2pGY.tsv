12.823	So I come from the tallest
12.823	people on the planet --
15.215	the Dutch.
17.383	It hasn't always been this way.
19.093	In fact, all across the globe,
19.093	people have been gaining height.
22.331	In the last 150 years,
23.918	in developed countries,
25.103	on average, we have gotten
28.139	And scientists have a lot
28.139	of theories about why this is,
30.942	but almost all of them involve nutrition,
33.386	namely the increase of dairy and meat.
36.432	In the last 50 years,
37.964	global meat consumption
37.964	has more than quadrupled,
40.862	from 71 million tons to 310 million tons.
44.705	Something similar has been going on
44.705	with milk and eggs.
48.46	In every society where incomes have risen,
48.46	so has protein consumption.
53.053	And we know that globally,
53.053	we are getting richer.
56.006	And as the middle class is on the rise,
56.006	so is our global population,
59.235	from 7 billion of us today
59.235	to 9.7 billion by 2050,
64.21	which means that by 2050,
65.697	we are going to need at least
68.248	than what is available to humankind today.
71.322	And the latest prediction of the UN
71.322	puts that population number,
74.365	by the end of this century, at 11 billion,
76.849	which means that we are going
76.849	to need a lot more protein.
81.027	This challenge is staggering --
82.59	so much so, that recently,
84.421	a team at Anglia Ruskin
84.421	Global Sustainability Institute suggested
87.563	that if we don't change
87.563	our global policies
89.723	and food production systems,
91.295	our societies might actually collapse
91.295	in the next 30 years.
96.143	Currently, our ocean serves
96.143	as the main source of animal protein.
100.487	Over 2.6 billion people
100.487	depend on it every single day.
105.177	At the same time,
106.384	our global fisheries
106.384	are two-and-a-half times larger
109.059	than what our oceans
109.059	can sustainably support,
111.607	meaning that humans take
111.607	far more fish from the ocean
114.353	than the oceans can naturally replace.
116.681	WWF recently published a report
116.681	showing that just in the last 40 years,
121.497	our global marine life
121.497	has been slashed in half.
124.595	And another recent report suggests
124.595	that of our largest predatory species,
129.322	such as swordfish and bluefin tuna,
131.694	over 90 percent has disappeared
131.694	since the 1950s.
135.653	And there are a lot of great, sustainable
135.653	fishing initiatives across the planet
139.45	working towards better practices
139.45	and better-managed fisheries.
143.08	But ultimately,
144.255	all of these initiatives are working
144.255	towards keeping current catch constant.
148.564	It's unlikely,
149.739	even with the best-managed fisheries,
151.553	that we are going to be able to take
151.553	much more from the ocean
154.54	than we do today.
155.719	We have to stop plundering
155.719	our oceans the way we have.
158.488	We need to alleviate the pressure on it.
160.67	And we are at a point
162.012	where if we push much harder
162.012	for more produce,
164.801	we might face total collapse.
167.226	Our current systems are not going to feed
167.226	a growing global population.
172.86	So how do we fix this?
174.153	What's the world going to look like
174.153	in just 35 short years
176.915	when there's 2.7 billion more of us
176.915	sharing the same resources?
181.059	We could all become vegan.
182.955	Sounds like a great idea,
184.732	but it's not realistic
186.06	and it's impossibly hard
186.06	to mandate globally.
188.977	People are eating animal protein
188.977	whether we like it or not.
192.564	And suppose we fail to change our ways
194.42	and continue on the current path,
196.57	failing to meet demands.
198.428	The World Health Organization
198.428	recently reported
200.674	that 800 million people are suffering
200.674	from malnutrition and food shortage,
204.86	which is due to that same
204.86	growing, global population
208.295	and the declining access to resources
208.295	like water, energy and land.
213.212	It takes very little imagination
215.296	to picture a world of global unrest,
215.296	riots and further malnutrition.
220.27	People are hungry,
221.92	and we are running dangerously low
221.92	on natural resources.
225.328	For so, so many reasons,
226.908	we need to change our global
226.908	food production systems.
230.255	We must do better
231.703	and there is a solution.
232.892	And that solution lies in aquaculture --
235.501	the farming of fish, plants like seaweed,
235.501	shellfish and crustaceans.
239.861	As the great ocean hero
239.861	Jacques Cousteau once said,
242.314	"""We must start using the ocean"
242.314	as farmers instead of hunters.
245.212	That's what civilization is all about --
245.212	"farming instead of hunting."""
249.402	Fish is the last food that we hunt.
252.374	And why is it that we keep
252.374	hearing phrases like,
255.706	"""Life's too short for farmed fish,"""
257.413	"or, ""Wild-caught, of course!"""
259.025	over fish that we know
259.025	virtually nothing about?
261.398	We don't know what it ate
261.398	during its lifetime,
263.633	and we don't know what
263.633	pollution it encounters.
265.829	And if it was a large predatory species,
267.773	it might have gone through the coast
267.773	of Fukushima yesterday.
270.626	We don't know.
271.994	Very few people realize
273.361	the traceability in fisheries
273.361	never goes beyond the hunter
277.027	that caught the wild animal.
278.566	But let's back up for a second
280.027	and talk about why fish
280.027	is the best food choice.
282.638	It's healthy,
283.813	it prevents heart disease,
285.093	it provides key amino acids
286.56	and key fatty acids like Omega-3s,
289.337	which is very different from almost
289.337	any other type of meat.
292.238	And aside from being healthy,
293.872	it's also a lot more exciting and diverse.
296.493	Think about it -- most animal farming
296.493	is pretty monotonous.
299.7	Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig,
302.375	and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken --
302.375	pretty much sums it up.
306.476	And then there's 500 species of fish
306.476	being farmed currently.
311.315	not that Western supermarkets
311.315	reflect that on their shelves,
314.267	but that's beside that point.
315.688	And you can farm fish
315.688	in a very healthy manner
318.479	that's good for us, good for the planet
318.479	and good for the fish.
322.062	I know I sound fish-obsessed --
324.022	(Laughter)
326.172	Let me explain:
327.347	My brilliant partner and wife,
327.347	Amy Novograntz, and I got involved
330.53	in aquaculture a couple of years ago.
332.505	We were inspired by Sylvia Earle,
334.801	who won the TED Prize in 2009.
337.121	We actually met on Mission Blue I
337.121	in the Galapagos.
341.157	Amy was there as the TED Prize Director;
343.118	me, an entrepreneur from the Netherlands
343.118	and concerned citizen,
346.332	love to dive, passion for the oceans.
349.292	Mission Blue truly changed our lives.
351.65	We fell in love,
352.825	got married
354.325	and we came away really inspired,
356.59	thinking we really want to do something
356.59	about ocean conservation --
359.823	something that was meant to last,
361.582	that could make a real difference
364.162	and something that we could do together.
367.741	Little did we expect that that would
367.741	lead us to fish farming.
371.741	But a few months after
371.741	we got off the boat,
373.863	we got to a meeting
373.863	at Conservation International,
376.421	where the Director General of WorldFish
376.421	was talking about aquaculture,
380.472	asking a room full of environmentalists
380.472	to stop turning from it,
384.242	realize what was going on
386.027	and to really get involved
387.472	because aquaculture has the potential
389.608	to be just what our oceans
389.608	and populations need.
393.184	We were stunned when we heard the stats
395.091	that we didn't know more
395.091	about this industry already
397.651	and excited about the chance
397.651	to help get it right.
401.042	And to talk about stats --
402.813	right now, the amount of fish
402.813	consumed globally,
405.613	wild catch and farmed combined,
407.693	is twice the tonnage
407.693	of the total amount of beef
410.049	produced on planet earth last year.
412.439	Every single fishing vessel combined,
414.77	small and large, across the globe,
416.725	together produce about 65 million tons
416.725	of wild-caught seafood
420.626	for human consumption.
422.623	Aquaculture this year,
423.953	for the first time in history,
425.556	actually produces more
425.556	than what we catch from the wild.
428.874	But now this:
430.049	Demand is going to go up.
432.157	In the next 35 years,
433.69	we are going to need an additional
438.709	which is one-and-a-half times
438.709	as much, almost,
441.328	as what we catch globally
441.328	out of our oceans.
445.14	An enormous number.
446.812	It's safe to assume that that's not
446.812	going to come from the ocean.
449.935	It needs to come from farming.
452.163	And talk about farming --
453.502	for farming you need resources.
456.313	As a human needs to eat
456.313	to grow and stay alive,
459.266	so does an animal.
460.763	A cow needs to eat
460.763	eight to nine pounds of feed
463.682	and drink almost 8,000 liters of water
466.157	to create just one pound of meat.
468.535	Experts agree that it's impossible
470.602	to farm cows for every
470.602	inhabitant on this planet.
473.778	We just don't have enough feed or water.
476.54	And we can't keep cutting down
476.54	rain forests for it.
479.318	And fresh water -- planet earth
479.318	has a very limited supply.
482.851	We need something more efficient
484.986	to keep humankind alive on this planet.
488.517	And now let's compare
488.517	that with fish farming.
491.164	You can farm one pound of fish
491.164	with just one pound of feed,
495.126	and depending on species, even less.
497.845	And why is that?
500.099	Well, that's because fish,
500.099	first of all, float.
502.892	They don't need to stand around all day
502.892	resisting gravity like we do.
506.806	And most fish are cold-blooded --
508.584	they don't need to heat themselves.
510.288	Fish chills.
511.48	(Laughter)
513.125	And it needs very little water,
514.689	which is counterintuitive,
515.991	but as we say,
517.402	it swims in it but it hardly drinks it.
519.82	Fish are the most resource-efficient
519.82	animal protein available to humankind,
524.257	aside from insects.
527.297	How much we've learned since.
529.482	For example, on top of that
532.943	for human consumption,
534.577	there's an additional 30 million tons
534.577	caught for animal feed,
538.588	mostly sardines and anchovies
538.588	for the aquaculture industry
542.153	that's turned into fish meal and fish oil.
544.602	This is madness.
546.548	Sixty-five percent of these fisheries,
546.548	globally, are badly managed.
550.144	Some of the worst issues
550.144	of our time are connected to it.
552.878	It's destroying our oceans.
554.2	The worst slavery issues
554.2	imaginable are connected to it.
557.702	Recently, an article came out of Stanford
560.536	saying that if 50 percent
560.536	of the world's aquaculture industry
563.433	would stop using fish meal,
564.759	our oceans would be saved.
566.837	Now think about that for a minute.
568.516	Now, we know that the oceans
568.516	have far more problems --
571.56	they have pollution,
571.56	there's acidification,
574.369	coral reef destruction and so on.
575.976	But it underlines the impact
575.976	of our fisheries,
578.537	and it underlines how
578.537	interconnected everything is.
581.608	Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation,
585.248	climate change, food security and so on.
588.834	In the search for alternatives,
590.36	the industry, on a massive scale,
592.439	has reverted to plant-based alternatives
594.626	like soy, industrial chicken waste,
597.503	blood meal from slaughterhouses
599.369	and so on.
600.648	And we understand where
600.648	these choices come from,
603.136	but this is not the right approach.
605.289	It's not sustainable,
606.568	it's not healthy.
607.766	Have you ever seen a chicken
607.766	at the bottom of the ocean?
610.453	Of course not.
611.828	If you feed salmon soy with nothing else,
614.048	it literally explodes.
616.463	Salmon is a carnivore,
617.639	it has no way to digest soy.
621.049	Now, fish farming is by far
623.195	the best animal farming
623.195	available to humankind.
625.536	But it's had a really bad reputation.
628.373	There's been excessive use of chemicals,
630.576	there's been virus and disease
630.576	transfered to wild populations,
633.78	ecosystem destruction and pollution,
636.133	escaped fish breeding
636.133	with wild populations,
638.371	altering the overall genetic pool,
640.395	and then of course, as just mentioned,
642.885	the unsustainable feed ingredients.
645.396	How blessed were the days
646.663	when we could just enjoy
646.663	food that was on our plate,
649.134	whatever it was.
650.825	Once you know, you know.
652.388	You can't go back.
653.618	It's not fun.
654.793	We really need a transparent food
654.793	system that we can trust,
658.006	that produces healthy food.
660.726	But the good news is
661.949	that decades of development and research
664.886	have led to a lot of new
664.886	technologies and knowledge
667.372	that allow us to do a lot better.
669.208	We can now farm fish
669.208	without any of these issues.
672.548	I think of agriculture
672.548	before the green revolution --
675.453	we are at aquaculture
675.453	and the blue revolution.
679.817	New technologies means
681.078	that we can now produce a feed
681.078	that's perfectly natural,
684.67	with a minimal footprint
685.878	that consists of microbes, insects,
685.878	seaweeds and micro-algae.
690.689	Healthy for the people,
692.016	healthy for the fish,
693.191	healthy for the planet.
695.293	Microbes, for example,
696.467	can be a perfect alternative
696.467	for high-grade fish meal --
699.34	at scale.
700.801	Insects are the --
702.908	well, first of all, the perfect recycling
704.893	because they're grown on food waste;
706.647	but second,
707.823	think of fly-fishing,
708.998	and you know how logical
708.998	it actually is to use it as fish feed.
712.712	You don't need large tracts of land for it
714.759	and you don't need
714.759	to cut down rain forests for it.
717.87	And microbes and insects are actually
717.87	net water producers.
721.509	This revolution is starting as we speak,
723.762	it just needs scale.
726.492	We can now farm far more
726.492	species than ever before
729.583	in controlled, natural conditions,
729.583	creating happy fish.
733.897	I imagine, for example,
735.205	a closed system that's performing
735.205	more efficiently than insect farming,
740.837	where you can produce
740.837	healthy, happy, delicious fish
744.105	with little or no effluent,
745.501	almost no energy and almost no water
747.985	and a natural feed
747.985	with a minimal footprint.
751.084	Or a system where you grow
751.084	up to 10 species next to each other --
754.335	off of each other,
755.735	mimicking nature.
757.918	You need very little feed,
759.312	very little footprint.
760.558	I think of seaweed growing
760.558	off the effluent of fish, for example.
766.453	There's great technologies
766.453	popping up all over the globe.
769.574	From alternatives to battle disease
771.777	so we don't need antibiotics
771.777	and chemicals anymore,
774.666	to automated feeders that feel
774.666	when the fish are hungry,
778.346	so we can save on feed
778.346	and create less pollution.
782.016	Software systems that gather
782.016	data across farms,
784.643	so we can improve farm practices.
787.127	There's really cool stuff
787.127	happening all over the globe.
790.67	And make no mistake --
790.67	all of these things are possible
793.337	at a cost that's competitive
793.337	to what a farmer spends today.
797.024	Tomorrow, there will be no excuse
797.024	for anyone to not do the right thing.
802.164	So somebody needs to connect the dots
804.447	and give these developments
804.447	a big kick in the butt.
807.054	And that's what we've been working on
807.054	the last couple of years,
810.095	and that's what we need
810.095	to be working on together --
813.049	rethinking everything from the ground up,
815.424	with a holistic view
815.424	across the value chain,
817.967	connecting all these things
817.967	across the globe,
820.125	alongside great entrepreneurs
822.197	that are willing to share
822.197	a collective vision.
825.474	Now is the time to create
825.474	change in this industry
828.331	and to push it into
828.331	a sustainable direction.
830.566	This industry is still young,
832.012	much of its growth is still ahead.
834.041	It's a big task, but not
834.041	as far-fetched as you might think.
836.899	It's possible.
839.032	So we need to take pressure off the ocean.
841.233	We want to eat good and healthy.
842.804	And if we eat an animal,
842.804	it needs to be one
844.9	that had a happy and healthy life.
846.582	We need to have a meal that we can trust,
848.813	live long lives.
850.577	And this is not just for people
850.577	in San Francisco or Northern Europe --
854.5	this is for all of us.
856.37	Even in the poorest countries,
858.054	it's not just about money.
859.588	People prefer something fresh
859.588	and healthy that they can trust
863.428	over something that comes from far away
863.428	that they know nothing about.
867.244	We're all the same.
870.267	The day will come
871.442	where people will realize -- no, demand --
871.442	farmed fish on their plate
874.727	that's farmed well
874.727	and that's farmed healthy --
878.204	and refuse anything less.
879.482	You can help speed this up.
881.163	Ask questions when you order seafood.
883.545	Where does my fish come from?
885.426	Who raised it,
886.965	and what did it eat?
889.008	Information about where your fish
889.008	comes from and how it was produced
892.691	needs to be much more readily available.
895.663	And consumers need to put pressure
895.663	on the aquaculture industry
898.871	to do the right thing.
900.653	So every time you order,
902.72	ask for detail
904.711	and show that you really care
904.711	about what you eat
907.217	and what's been given to you.
908.999	And eventually, they will listen.
911.367	And all of us will benefit.
913.575	Thank you.
