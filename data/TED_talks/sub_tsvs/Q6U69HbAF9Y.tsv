13.312	Michael Browning: engineer,
15.978	innovator --
17.562	inventor, really --
18.775	and inspiring father.
20.594	He had a passion for flight,
20.594	as you can kind of sense
23.166	from that rather dubious
27.691	And some 40 years after that was created,
30.526	a small group of us got together
33.14	to have a go,
34.321	a run at the whole challenge of flight
34.321	that inspired people for years,
38.702	and do it in a very different kind of way.
40.783	And that's the journey I'd like
40.783	to share with you now.
43.492	The starting hypothesis was one
43.492	of the human mind and body,
46.734	which, as you've seen
46.734	for the last few days here,
49.152	is an amazing construct.
50.995	What if you augmented
50.995	that wonderful machine
54.685	with just the right technology?
56.187	If you approach flight
56.187	in that kind of real way,
58.546	where could you get to?
59.822	So my training partner here
59.822	back in London, Denton,
63.213	is doing a much better job
63.213	of that kind of stuff than me.
66.241	Guess what? It's London.
67.925	The idea was that you augment that.
70.613	And so, how do you augment that?
72.191	Well, we bought one of these.
75.216	This is a micro gas turbine.
77.67	This was ground zero,
79.792	so that little piece of kit
79.792	proved really quite impressive,
82.965	so we got two in a field.
86.75	The real hero here, by the way,
86.75	is, right in the background,
89.875	there's a lady tending some vegetables,
91.808	who does a brilliant job
91.808	of trying to ignore us for a while --
94.849	(Laughter)
97.829	I think the only thing
97.829	less happy is the grass,
100.258	that we did probably damage quite badly.
102.734	You get an idea of the thrust here,
104.444	when I try to hold them horizontally
104.444	and somewhat fail.
107.094	That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.
109.402	We were quite impressed with that.
111.095	We thought we were getting somewhere.
112.961	So there's only one sensible way
112.961	to go from there:
116.393	you get four.
117.587	(Laughter)
122.798	I have to say, I still like
122.798	watching these back.
125.078	So then we thought well, let's try
125.078	and spread the load a bit.
128.107	The legs are designed to take the load,
130.023	so why don't we spread it out a bit?
132.975	That bit was good.
135.014	The harness --
136.421	a nice idea but it didn't really work,
138.346	as you'll see now.
140.112	This whole journey was very much
140.112	about trying things --
142.898	(Laughter)
143.996	Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?
145.819	Trying things and learning
145.819	by failing at them most of the time.
149.595	And that included failing by falling over.
154.742	If you notice, we've got
154.742	five engines here --
157.051	not to be put off by the fact
157.051	one was in maintenance,
159.638	still had a go.
160.817	(Laughter)
161.848	And then I pinched a fuel line.
164.535	So again, good learning.
164.535	We learned not to do that again.
167.285	This was a blind alley.
168.509	(Laughter)
169.56	This was three on each arm --
171.145	that was ridiculous.
172.335	That was 70 kilos on each arm.
174.32	Again, struck that one off.
175.937	(Laughter)
177.608	But we were starting to make
177.608	some really quite convincing progress,
181.094	just enough to make you
181.094	believe that maybe --
183.452	maybe we could get there.
185.398	You can see, look -- tantalizing.
187.587	The model of one on each leg
187.587	and two on each arm,
191.46	on paper, that was enough thrust.
193.711	And then we did what
193.711	I'm about to show you now,
196.868	and I still love watching this one.
201.612	This was our first six-second,
201.612	reasonably coherent flight.
207.3	(Applause)
211.983	That was the point where
211.983	this endeavor went from:
215.029	"""I'm really not sure"
215.029	"this is going to work,"""
217.139	"to: ""Oh my god, it does work!"""
218.664	From there on we then refined it,
220.283	but we carried on falling over a lot.
223.093	Falling over, like I say, is definitely
223.093	the best way to learn.
226.204	After a while, we starting
226.204	really refining the layout of all of this.
229.926	And you'll see,
229.926	that's stability and control --
232.283	there's no wires there or anything --
234.137	that's a combination of us
234.137	refining the technology,
236.595	including with a Tupperware box
236.595	on the back for the electronics
239.822	and actually learning
239.822	the balance and control.
244.073	I'm now going to save your ears
244.073	for the next short piece
246.75	and talk over it.
247.933	After a while, the jet engine
247.933	noise is a bit annoying.
250.54	This is only a few weeks ago.
251.966	You can see the stability and control
251.966	is really quite nice,
254.915	and I'd like to think this somewhat
254.915	validates that starting hypothesis,
258.389	that the human mind and body,
258.389	if properly augmented in that way,
263.125	can achieve some pretty cool stuff.
264.935	I mean, like I said:
266.532	I'm not thinking about where
266.532	I'm moving my arms at that stage.
269.52	I'm looking at the objective
269.52	of where I want to get to,
272.578	and a bit like riding a bike,
274.401	my arms are just doing their thing.
276.227	It's a very strange experience.
277.816	So where is all this headed?
279.516	I'll talk over this landing --
281.276	I think I land in this one.
283.662	Well, I don't think anybody's going
283.662	to go down to Walmart
286.61	or take the kids to school
286.61	in any of this stuff for a while,
289.519	but the team at Gravity are building
289.519	some awesome technology
292.409	that's going to make
292.409	this look like child's play.
294.749	We're working on some things
296.122	that will seek to bring
296.122	this unusual experience of flight
298.88	to a wider audience, beyond the events
298.88	and displays we're doing.
301.946	We're even starting to look
301.946	for pilots two and three,
304.452	if there's any volunteers.
305.721	I've got this vision.
306.943	It sounds audacious,
306.943	but let's just stick it out there,
309.595	that one day maybe we can
309.595	rise up above a beach,
311.897	fly up and down the coastline
311.897	of it, rise up a bit higher,
314.643	with some of the safety kit
314.643	we're working on to make this achievable.
317.935	Then over the horizon comes
317.935	a Hercules with the ramp down.
320.685	As it comes past,
320.685	you start picking up speed
322.774	and see if we can intercept --
324.253	from the rear, not the front,
324.253	that would be a mistake --
326.927	and then try and land in the back.
328.585	And as I say, that's a little
328.585	way off at the moment.
331.594	But this is also, if I take
331.594	a big step back from this,
335.538	this is also a very
335.538	personal journey for me.
339.352	Back to that lovely photo,
341.173	or photo in a picture.
343.362	Sadly, my father took
343.362	his own life when I was 15,
346.279	and left an awful lot
346.279	of unfulfilled ambition.
349.271	He was a wonderful inventor,
350.919	a maverick creator.
352.324	And I'd just like to think,
352.324	if it was possible,
355.29	if he was looking down,
356.63	he would be --
357.835	he'd certainly be smiling at some
357.835	of the things we've done here,
360.876	I think.
362.058	So, it's a tribute to him.
363.363	Thank you very much.
364.56	(Applause)
368.088	(Voice-over) Richard Browning:
368.088	I'm probably more nervous
370.795	about doing the demo after this.
372.357	I've got a lot of things
372.357	to get done today.
374.401	Worst-case scenario,
374.401	we don't get a clean start.
376.714	Or we get an unplanned failure
376.714	while I'm actually flying around.
379.958	This is why we keep it very low,
381.584	so the worst is I just look like an idiot
381.584	and fall on my rear, as I said.
385.095	So you can all enjoy that if that happens.
387.13	(Music)
408.174	(Jet engine accelerates)
426.399	(Cheers)
