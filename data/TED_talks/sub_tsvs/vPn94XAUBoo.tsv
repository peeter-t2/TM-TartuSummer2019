12.836	What was the most
12.836	difficult job you ever did?
15.882	Was it working in the sun?
17.564	Was it working to provide food
17.564	for a family or a community?
21.134	Was it working days and nights
21.134	trying to protect lives and property?
25.661	Was it working alone
26.876	or working on a project
26.876	that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,
30.28	but that might improve
30.28	human health or save a life?
33.667	Was it working to build something,
33.667	create something, make a work of art?
38.991	Was it work for which you were never sure
41.002	you were fully understood or appreciated?
45.113	The people in our communities
45.113	who do these jobs
47.393	deserve our attention, our love
47.393	and our deepest support.
51.417	But people aren't the only ones
51.417	in our communities
53.884	who do these difficult jobs.
56.114	These jobs are also done
56.114	by the plants, the animals
58.9	and the ecosystems on our planet,
61.356	including the ecosystems I study:
61.356	the tropical coral reefs.
65.64	Coral reefs are farmers.
67.626	They provide food, income
67.626	and food security
70.86	for hundreds of millions
70.86	of people around the world.
73.447	Coral reefs are security guards.
76.181	The structures that they build
76.181	protect our shorelines
78.962	from storm surge and waves,
80.843	and the biological systems
80.843	that they house filter the water
84.533	and make it safer for us to work and play.
87.552	Coral reefs are chemists.
90.138	The molecules that we're discovering
90.138	on coral reefs are increasingly important
93.931	in the search for new antibiotics
93.931	and new cancer drugs.
97.528	And coral reefs are artists.
99.707	The structures that they build
101.226	are some of the most
101.226	beautiful things on planet Earth.
103.8	And this beauty is the foundation
103.8	of the tourism industry
106.61	in many countries with few
106.61	or little other natural resources.
111.877	So for all of these reasons,
111.877	all of these ecosystem services,
115.161	economists estimate the value
115.161	of the world's coral reefs
117.87	in the hundreds of billions
117.87	of dollars per year.
121.271	And yet despite all that hard work
121.271	being done for us
124.402	and all that wealth that we gain,
126.622	we have done almost everything
126.622	we possibly could to destroy that.
131.091	We have taken the fish out of the oceans
133.068	and we have added in fertilizer, sewage,
135.69	diseases, oil, pollution, sediments.
139.613	We have trampled the reefs physically
139.613	with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,
143.51	and we have changed the chemistry
143.51	of the entire sea,
146.041	warmed the waters and made storms worse.
148.693	And these would all be bad on their own,
150.868	but these threats magnify each other
152.65	and compound one another
152.65	and make each other worse.
155.63	I'll give you an example.
157.047	Where I live and work, in Curaçao,
157.047	a tropical storm went by a few years ago.
161.396	And on the eastern end of the island,
163.309	where the reefs are intact and thriving,
165.277	you could barely tell
165.277	a tropical storm had passed.
168.26	But in town, where corals had died
168.26	from overfishing, from pollution,
173.609	the tropical storm picked up
173.609	the dead corals
175.736	and used them as bludgeons
175.736	to kill the corals that were left.
179.361	This is a coral that I studied
179.361	during my PhD --
181.702	I got to know it quite well.
183.295	And after this storm
183.295	took off half of its tissue,
186.398	it became infested with algae,
188.091	the algae overgrew the tissue
188.091	and that coral died.
191.416	This magnification of threats,
191.416	this compounding of factors
195.402	is what Jeremy Jackson describes
195.402	"as the ""slippery slope to slime."""
200.699	It's hardly even a metaphor
200.699	because many of our reefs now
204.276	are literally bacteria
204.276	and algae and slime.
208.954	Now, this is the part of the talk
210.59	where you may expect me
210.59	to launch into my plea
213.503	for us to all save the coral reefs.
216.835	But I have a confession to make:
219.744	that phrase drives me nuts.
222.363	Whether I see it in a tweet,
222.363	in a news headline
226.078	or the glossy pages
226.078	of a conservation brochure,
229.689	that phrase bothers me,
231.536	because we as conservationists
231.536	have been sounding the alarms
234.488	about the death
234.488	of coral reefs for decades.
236.916	And yet, almost everyone I meet,
236.916	no matter how educated,
241	is not sure what a coral is
241	or where they come from.
245.489	How would we get someone to care
245.489	about the world's coral reefs
248.838	when it's an abstract thing
248.838	they can barely understand?
253.371	If they don't understand
253.371	what a coral is or where it comes from,
256.467	or how funny or interesting
256.467	or beautiful it is,
259.158	why would we expect them
259.158	to care about saving them?
262.51	So let's change that.
263.852	What is a coral
263.852	and where does it come from?
267.287	Corals are born
267.287	in a number of different ways,
269.479	but most often by mass spawning:
269.479	all of the individuals of a single species
273.726	on one night a year,
275.086	releasing all the eggs
275.086	they've made that year
277.823	into the water column,
279.041	packaged into bundles with sperm cells.
281.509	And those bundles go to the surface
281.509	of the ocean and break apart.
285.009	And hopefully -- hopefully --
285.009	at the surface of the ocean,
287.779	they meet the eggs and sperm
287.779	from other corals.
290.024	And that is why you need
290.024	lots of corals on a coral reef --
293.156	so that all of their eggs can
293.156	meet their match at the surface.
297.254	When they're fertilized, they do
297.254	what any other animal egg does:
300.386	divides in half again and again and again.
303.059	Taking these photos
303.059	under the microscope every year
305.561	is one of my favorite and most
305.561	magical moments of the year.
308.753	At the end of all this cell division,
308.753	they turn into a swimming larva --
312.73	a little tiny blob of fat
312.73	the size of a poppy seed,
316.488	but with all of the sensory
316.488	systems that we have.
319.182	They can sense color and light,
319.182	textures, chemicals, pH.
324.862	They can even feel pressure waves;
324.862	they can hear sound.
328.253	And they use those talents
329.571	to search the bottom of the reef
329.571	for a place to attach
332.428	and live the rest of their lives.
334.051	So imagine finding a place
334.051	where you would live the rest of your life
337.451	when you were just two days old.
339.78	They attach in the place
339.78	they find most suitable,
342.571	they build a skeleton
342.571	underneath themselves,
344.674	they build a mouth and tentacles,
346.287	and then they begin the difficult work
346.287	of building the world's coral reefs.
351.124	One coral polyp will divide itself
351.124	again and again and again,
354.993	leaving a limestone skeleton
354.993	underneath itself
357.358	and growing up toward the sun.
359.906	Given hundreds of years and many species,
362.652	what you get is a massive
362.652	limestone structure
365.014	that can be seen from space in many cases,
367.55	covered by a thin skin
367.55	of these hardworking animals.
371.625	Now, there are only a few hundred species
371.625	of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.
376.435	But these systems house millions
376.435	and millions of other species,
381.193	and that diversity is what
381.193	stabilizes the systems,
383.701	and it's where we're finding
383.701	our new medicines.
385.939	It's how we find new sources of food.
389.841	I'm lucky enough to work
389.841	on the island of Curaçao,
392.206	where we still have reefs
392.206	that look like this.
394.486	But, indeed, much of the Caribbean
394.486	and much of our world
398.821	is much more like this.
400.711	Scientists have studied
400.711	in increasing detail
403.758	the loss of the world's coral reefs,
405.564	and they have documented
405.564	with increasing certainty the causes.
409.149	But in my research, I'm not
409.149	interested in looking backward.
412.165	My colleagues and I in Curaçao
412.165	are interested in looking forward
415.25	at what might be.
416.631	And we have the tiniest reason
416.631	to be optimistic.
420.824	Because even in some of these reefs
422.625	that we probably could have
422.625	written off long ago,
426.298	we sometimes see baby corals
426.298	arrive and survive anyway.
431.193	And we're starting to think
431.193	that baby corals may have the ability
434.492	to adjust to some of the conditions
434.492	that the adults couldn't.
438.119	They may be able to adjust
440.159	ever so slightly more readily
440.159	to this human planet.
444.89	So in the research I do
444.89	with my colleagues in Curaçao,
448.957	we try to figure out
448.957	what a baby coral needs
451.494	in that critical early stage,
453.042	what it's looking for
454.233	and how we can try to help it
454.233	through that process.
456.797	I'm going to show you three examples
456.797	of the work we've done
459.662	to try to answer those questions.
462.575	A few years ago we took a 3D printer
462.575	and we made coral choice surveys --
467.374	different colors and different textures,
469.334	and we simply asked the coral
469.334	where they preferred to settle.
472.228	And we found that corals,
472.228	even without the biology involved,
475.237	still prefer white and pink,
475.237	the colors of a healthy reef.
478.42	And they prefer crevices
478.42	and grooves and holes,
481.579	where they will be safe
481.579	from being trampled
483.627	or eaten by a predator.
485.276	So we can use this knowledge,
486.756	we can go back and say
486.756	we need to restore those factors --
489.799	that pink, that white, those crevices,
489.799	those hard surfaces --
493.002	in our conservation projects.
494.769	We can also use that knowledge
496.254	if we're going to put something
496.254	underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.
499.817	We can choose to use the materials
499.817	and colors and textures
502.881	that might bias the system
502.881	back toward those corals.
507.487	Now in addition to the surfaces,
509.488	we also study the chemical
509.488	and microbial signals
512.009	that attract corals to reefs.
514.061	Starting about six years ago,
514.061	I began culturing bacteria
516.985	from surfaces where corals had settled.
519.101	And I tried those one by one by one,
521.958	looking for the bacteria that would
521.958	convince corals to settle and attach.
526.748	And we now have many
526.748	bacterial strains in our freezer
529.922	that will reliably cause corals
531.455	to go through that settlement
531.455	and attachment process.
534.448	So as we speak,
535.671	my colleagues in Curaçao
535.671	are testing those bacteria
538.115	to see if they'll help us raise
538.115	more coral settlers in the lab,
541.463	and to see if those coral settlers
541.463	will survive better
544.074	when we put them back underwater.
546.304	Now in addition to these tools,
546.304	we also try to uncover the mysteries
549.553	of species that are under-studied.
552.839	This is one of my favorite corals,
552.839	and always has been:
556.152	dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.
559.073	I love it because it makes
559.073	this ridiculous shape,
562.004	because its tentacles
562.004	are fat and look fuzzy
565.171	and because it's rare.
566.635	Finding one of these on a reef is a treat.
569.695	In fact, it's so rare,
570.871	that last year it was listed
570.871	as a threatened species
573.411	on the endangered species list.
575.29	And this was in part because
575.29	in over 30 years of research surveys,
578.621	scientists had never found
578.621	a baby pillar coral.
582.803	We weren't even sure
582.803	if they could still reproduce,
585.241	or if they were still reproducing.
587.76	So four years ago, we started
587.76	following these at night
590.453	and watching to see if we could
590.453	figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.
595.992	We got some good tips
595.992	from our colleagues in Florida,
598.704	who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,
602.786	and eventually we figured out
602.786	when they spawn in Curaçao
605.483	and we caught it.
606.866	Here's a female on the left
606.866	with some eggs in her tissue,
609.588	about to release them into the seawater.
611.532	And here's a male
611.532	on the right, releasing sperm.
614.783	We collected this, we got it
614.783	back to the lab, we got it to fertilize
618.491	and we got baby pillar corals
618.491	swimming in our lab.
622.52	Thanks to the work
622.52	of our scientific aunts and uncles,
625.084	and thanks to the 10 years of practice
625.084	we've had in Curaçao
627.965	at raising other coral species,
630.182	we got some of those larvae
630.182	to go through the rest of the process
634.081	and settle and attach,
635.757	and turn into metamorphosed corals.
638.492	So this is the first pillar coral baby
638.492	that anyone ever saw.
643.786	(Applause)
649.23	And I have to say --
649.23	if you think baby pandas are cute,
652.428	this is cuter.
653.69	(Laughter)
656.236	So we're starting to figure out
656.236	the secrets to this process,
659.384	the secrets of coral reproduction
659.384	and how we might help them.
663.089	And this is true all around the world;
664.961	scientists are figuring out new ways
664.961	to handle their embryos,
667.877	to get them to settle,
669.059	maybe even figuring out the methods
669.059	to preserve them at low temperatures,
673.617	so that we can preserve
673.617	their genetic diversity
676.757	and work with them more often.
678.984	But this is still so low-tech.
682.26	We are limited by the space on our bench,
682.26	the number of hands in the lab
687.299	and the number of coffees
687.299	we can drink in any given hour.
692.105	Now, compare that to our other crises
694.622	and our other areas
694.622	of concern as a society.
698.265	We have advanced medical technology,
698.265	we have defense technology,
701.941	we have scientific technology,
703.562	we even have advanced technology for art.
706.012	But our technology
706.012	for conservation is behind.
713.022	Think back to the most
713.022	difficult job you ever did.
716.662	Many of you would say
716.662	it was being a parent.
720.314	My mother described being a parent
721.995	as something that makes your life
721.995	far more amazing and far more difficult
726.23	than you could've ever possibly imagined.
728.784	I've been trying to help corals
728.784	become parents for over 10 years now.
733.563	And watching the wonder of life
735.757	has certainly filled me with amazement
735.757	to the core of my soul.
739.808	But I've also seen how difficult
739.808	it is for them to become parents.
744.45	The pillar corals spawned
744.45	again two weeks ago,
746.654	and we collected their eggs
746.654	and brought them back to the lab.
749.567	And here you see one embryo dividing,
751.649	alongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize
754.547	and will blow up.
756.532	They'll be infected with bacteria,
756.532	they will explode
759.291	and those bacteria will threaten
759.291	the life of this one embryo
763.057	that has a chance.
765.576	We don't know if it was our handling
765.576	methods that went wrong
768.563	and we don't know
770.214	if it was just this coral on this reef,
770.214	always suffering from low fertility.
775.582	Whatever the cause,
776.911	we have much more work to do
776.911	before we can use baby corals
781.452	to grow or fix or, yes,
781.452	maybe save coral reefs.
787.45	So never mind that they're worth
787.45	hundreds of billions of dollars.
790.545	Coral reefs are hardworking animals
790.545	and plants and microbes and fungi.
795.996	They're providing us with art
795.996	and food and medicine.
800.012	And we almost took out
800.012	an entire generation of corals.
803.975	But a few made it anyway,
803.975	despite our best efforts,
808.04	and now it's time for us to thank them
808.04	for the work they did
811.196	and give them every chance they have
811.196	to raise the coral reefs of the future,
816.045	their coral babies.
817.557	Thank you so much.
818.776	(Applause)
