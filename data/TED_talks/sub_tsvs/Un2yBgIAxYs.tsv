12.68	Imagine you're walking through a forest.
15.96	I'm guessing you're thinking
15.96	of a collection of trees,
19.12	what we foresters call a stand,
21.88	with their rugged stems
21.88	and their beautiful crowns.
25.36	Yes, trees are the foundation of forests,
28.48	but a forest is much more
28.48	than what you see,
31.56	and today I want to change
31.56	the way you think about forests.
35.88	You see, underground
35.88	there is this other world,
39.28	a world of infinite biological pathways
42.36	that connect trees
42.36	and allow them to communicate
45.8	and allow the forest to behave
45.8	as though it's a single organism.
50.04	It might remind you
50.04	of a sort of intelligence.
53.6	How do I know this?
55.28	Here's my story.
57.56	I grew up in the forests
57.56	of British Columbia.
61.08	I used to lay on the forest floor
61.08	and stare up at the tree crowns.
64.28	They were giants.
66.32	My grandfather was a giant, too.
67.92	He was a horse logger,
69.4	and he used to selectively cut
69.4	cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
73.76	Grandpa taught me about the quiet
73.76	and cohesive ways of the woods,
77.76	and how my family was knit into it.
81.08	So I followed in grandpa's footsteps.
83.24	He and I had this curiosity about forests,
86.8	"and my first big ""aha"" moment"
88.96	was at the outhouse by our lake.
91.64	Our poor dog Jigs
91.64	had slipped and fallen into the pit.
96.08	So grandpa ran up with his shovel
96.08	to rescue the poor dog.
99.24	He was down there, swimming in the muck.
103	But as grandpa dug
103	through that forest floor,
105.72	I became fascinated with the roots,
108.36	and under that, what I learned later
108.36	was the white mycelium
111.48	and under that the red
111.48	and yellow mineral horizons.
115.24	Eventually, grandpa and I
115.24	rescued the poor dog,
118.44	but it was at that moment that I realized
120.8	that that palette of roots and soil
123.4	was really the foundation of the forest.
126.64	And I wanted to know more.
128.68	So I studied forestry.
131.44	But soon I found myself working
131.44	alongside the powerful people
135.08	in charge of the commercial harvest.
137.96	The extent of the clear-cutting
140.56	was alarming,
141.84	and I soon found myself
141.84	conflicted by my part in it.
145.6	Not only that, the spraying
145.6	and hacking of the aspens and birches
150.72	to make way for the more commercially
150.72	valuable planted pines and firs
155.04	was astounding.
157.04	It seemed that nothing could stop
157.04	this relentless industrial machine.
161.64	So I went back to school,
164.36	and I studied my other world.
167.48	You see, scientists had just discovered
167.48	in the laboratory in vitro
171.76	that one pine seedling root
173.92	could transmit carbon
173.92	to another pine seedling root.
178.16	But this was in the laboratory,
179.96	and I wondered,
179.96	could this happen in real forests?
183.04	I thought yes.
185.12	Trees in real forests might also
185.12	share information below ground.
190.12	But this was really controversial,
191.92	and some people thought I was crazy,
194.56	and I had a really hard time
194.56	getting research funding.
197.64	But I persevered,
200.2	and I eventually conducted
200.2	some experiments deep in the forest,
206.12	I grew 80 replicates of three species:
209.04	paper birch, Douglas fir,
209.04	and western red cedar.
212.24	I figured the birch and the fir
212.24	would be connected in a belowground web,
216.32	but not the cedar.
217.6	It was in its own other world.
220.44	And I gathered my apparatus,
222.32	and I had no money,
222.32	so I had to do it on the cheap.
225.52	So I went to Canadian Tire --
227.16	(Laughter)
228.6	and I bought some plastic bags
228.6	and duct tape and shade cloth,
232.04	a timer, a paper suit, a respirator.
236.16	And then I borrowed some
236.16	high-tech stuff from my university:
239.36	a Geiger counter, a scintillation counter,
239.36	a mass spectrometer, microscopes.
244	And then I got some
244	really dangerous stuff:
246.48	syringes full of radioactive
246.48	carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas
251.28	and some high pressure bottles
253.32	of the stable isotope
253.32	carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
257.56	But I was legally permitted.
259.16	(Laughter)
260.88	Oh, and I forgot some stuff,
263.08	important stuff: the bug spray,
265.6	the bear spray,
265.6	the filters for my respirator.
269.16	Oh well.
271.56	The first day of the experiment,
271.56	we got out to our plot
274.36	and a grizzly bear and her cub
274.36	chased us off.
277.92	And I had no bear spray.
281.12	But you know, this is how
281.12	forest research in Canada goes.
284.32	(Laughter)
285.8	So I came back the next day,
287.36	and mama grizzly and her cub were gone.
289.64	So this time, we really got started,
291.68	and I pulled on my white paper suit,
294.48	I put on my respirator,
298.16	and then
299.4	I put the plastic bags over my trees.
303.08	I got my giant syringes,
305.2	and I injected the bags
306.88	with my tracer isotope
306.88	carbon dioxide gases,
310.32	first the birch.
311.56	I injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,
314.56	into the bag of birch.
316.16	And then for fir,
317.44	I injected the stable isotope
317.44	carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
321.28	I used two isotopes,
323.04	because I was wondering
324.32	whether there was two-way communication
324.32	going on between these species.
329.64	I got to the final bag,
332.24	the 80th replicate,
333.76	and all of a sudden
333.76	mama grizzly showed up again.
336.2	And she started to chase me,
337.64	and I had my syringes above my head,
340.08	and I was swatting the mosquitos,
340.08	and I jumped into the truck,
343.04	and I thought,
344.28	"""This is why people do lab studies."""
346.04	(Laughter)
349.12	I waited an hour.
350.64	I figured it would take this long
352.28	for the trees to suck up
352.28	the CO2 through photosynthesis,
355.08	turn it into sugars,
355.08	send it down into their roots,
358.24	and maybe, I hypothesized,
360.96	shuttle that carbon belowground
360.96	to their neighbors.
364.92	After the hour was up,
366.8	I rolled down my window,
368.4	and I checked for mama grizzly.
370.6	Oh good, she's over there
370.6	eating her huckleberries.
373.72	So I got out of the truck
373.72	and I got to work.
376.36	I went to my first bag with the birch.
376.36	I pulled the bag off.
380.28	I ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.
383.28	Kkhh!
385.4	Perfect.
386.64	The birch had taken up
386.64	the radioactive gas.
389.6	Then the moment of truth.
391.2	I went over to the fir tree.
393.32	I pulled off its bag.
395.12	I ran the Geiger counter up its needles,
397.48	and I heard the most beautiful sound.
400.44	Kkhh!
402.76	It was the sound of birch talking to fir,
405.52	and birch was saying,
405.52	"""Hey, can I help you?"""
409	"And fir was saying, ""Yeah,"
409	can you send me some of your carbon?
412.64	Because somebody
412.64	"threw a shade cloth over me."""
416.36	I went up to cedar, and I ran
416.36	the Geiger counter over its leaves,
420.08	and as I suspected,
422.52	silence.
424.56	Cedar was in its own world.
426.8	It was not connected into the web
426.8	interlinking birch and fir.
431.84	I was so excited,
434	I ran from plot to plot
434	and I checked all 80 replicates.
438	The evidence was clear.
440.16	The C-13 and C-14 was showing me
443.12	that paper birch and Douglas fir
443.12	were in a lively two-way conversation.
447.96	It turns out at that time of the year,
449.84	in the summer,
451.08	that birch was sending more carbon to fir
451.08	than fir was sending back to birch,
454.76	especially when the fir was shaded.
457.08	And then in later experiments,
457.08	we found the opposite,
460.08	that fir was sending more carbon to birch
460.08	than birch was sending to fir,
463.64	and this was because the fir was still
463.64	growing while the birch was leafless.
467.88	So it turns out the two species
467.88	were interdependent,
470.56	like yin and yang.
472.96	And at that moment,
472.96	everything came into focus for me.
475.96	I knew I had found something big,
478.24	something that would change the way
478.24	we look at how trees interact in forests,
483	from not just competitors
485.04	but to cooperators.
487.8	And I had found solid evidence
490.28	of this massive belowground
490.28	communications network,
493.68	the other world.
495.96	Now, I truly hoped and believed
497.88	that my discovery would change
497.88	how we practice forestry,
501.52	from clear-cutting and herbiciding
503.32	to more holistic and sustainable methods,
506.28	methods that were less expensive
506.28	and more practical.
509.52	What was I thinking?
511.92	I'll come back to that.
515.76	So how do we do science
515.76	in complex systems like forests?
520.72	Well, as forest scientists,
520.72	we have to do our research in the forests,
524.08	and that's really tough,
524.08	as I've shown you.
526.12	And we have to be really good
526.12	at running from bears.
530.76	But mostly, we have to persevere
532.36	in spite of all the stuff
532.36	stacked against us.
535.28	And we have to follow our intuition
535.28	and our experiences
537.92	and ask really good questions.
540.08	And then we've got to gather our data
540.08	and then go verify.
543.28	For me, I've conducted and published
543.28	hundreds of experiments in the forest.
549.08	Some of my oldest experimental plantations
549.08	are now over 30 years old.
554.04	You can check them out.
555.48	That's how forest science works.
558.2	So now I want to talk about the science.
560.56	How were paper birch
560.56	and Douglas fir communicating?
563.64	Well, it turns out they were conversing
563.64	not only in the language of carbon
568.16	but also nitrogen and phosphorus
571.2	and water and defense signals
571.2	and allele chemicals and hormones --
575.96	information.
578.16	And you know, I have to tell you,
578.16	before me, scientists had thought
581.36	that this belowground
581.36	mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza
584.96	was involved.
586.48	"Mycorrhiza literally means ""fungus root."""
590.36	You see their reproductive organs
590.36	when you walk through the forest.
594.28	They're the mushrooms.
596.12	The mushrooms, though,
596.12	are just the tip of the iceberg,
599.16	because coming out of those stems
599.16	are fungal threads that form a mycelium,
603.44	and that mycelium
603.44	infects and colonizes the roots
606.16	of all the trees and plants.
608.32	And where the fungal cells
608.32	interact with the root cells,
611	there's a trade of carbon for nutrients,
613.8	and that fungus gets those nutrients
613.8	by growing through the soil
616.88	and coating every soil particle.
619.84	The web is so dense that there can be
619.84	hundreds of kilometers of mycelium
624.16	under a single footstep.
626.72	And not only that, that mycelium connects
626.72	different individuals in the forest,
632.32	individuals not only of the same species
632.32	but between species, like birch and fir,
637.96	and it works kind of like the Internet.
641.76	You see, like all networks,
643.68	mycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.
646.52	We made this map by examining
646.52	the short sequences of DNA
650.6	of every tree and every fungal individual
650.6	in a patch of Douglas fir forest.
656.12	In this picture, the circles represent
656.12	the Douglas fir, or the nodes,
659.96	and the lines represent the interlinking
659.96	fungal highways, or the links.
665.12	The biggest, darkest nodes
665.12	are the busiest nodes.
669.48	We call those hub trees,
671.44	or more fondly, mother trees,
673.88	because it turns out
673.88	that those hub trees nurture their young,
678.52	the ones growing in the understory.
681.08	And if you can see those yellow dots,
683.24	those are the young seedlings
683.24	that have established within the network
686.56	of the old mother trees.
688.4	In a single forest, a mother tree can be
688.4	connected to hundreds of other trees.
693.8	And using our isotope tracers,
696.12	we have found that mother trees
697.64	will send their excess carbon
697.64	through the mycorrhizal network
700.6	to the understory seedlings,
702.56	and we've associated this
702.56	with increased seedling survival
705.72	by four times.
707.88	Now, we know we all
707.88	favor our own children,
711.12	and I wondered, could Douglas fir
711.12	recognize its own kin,
715.76	like mama grizzly and her cub?
718.56	So we set about an experiment,
720.4	and we grew mother trees
720.4	with kin and stranger's seedlings.
724.32	And it turns out
724.32	they do recognize their kin.
727.24	Mother trees colonize their kin
727.24	with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
732.24	They send them more carbon below ground.
734.68	They even reduce
734.68	their own root competition
737.28	to make elbow room for their kids.
740.16	When mother trees are injured or dying,
743.84	they also send messages of wisdom
743.84	on to the next generation of seedlings.
749.12	So we've used isotope tracing
750.68	to trace carbon moving
750.68	from an injured mother tree
753.28	down her trunk
753.28	into the mycorrhizal network
755.64	and into her neighboring seedlings,
758.64	not only carbon but also defense signals.
761.44	And these two compounds
763.28	have increased the resistance
763.28	of those seedlings to future stresses.
767.4	So trees talk.
770.56	(Applause)
772.6	Thank you.
777.44	Through back and forth conversations,
779.76	they increase the resilience
779.76	of the whole community.
783.36	It probably reminds you
783.36	of our own social communities,
786.28	and our families,
787.88	well, at least some families.
789.285	(Laughter)
791.52	So let's come back to the initial point.
794.48	Forests aren't simply
794.48	collections of trees,
796.96	they're complex systems
796.96	with hubs and networks
800.52	that overlap and connect trees
800.52	and allow them to communicate,
804.04	and they provide avenues
804.04	for feedbacks and adaptation,
807.84	and this makes the forest resilient.
810.28	That's because there are many hub trees
810.28	and many overlapping networks.
814.68	But they're also vulnerable,
816.68	vulnerable not only
816.68	to natural disturbances
820.2	like bark beetles that preferentially
820.2	attack big old trees
823.92	but high-grade logging
823.92	and clear-cut logging.
827.24	You see, you can take out
827.24	one or two hub trees,
830.08	but there comes a tipping point,
832.92	because hub trees are not
832.92	unlike rivets in an airplane.
835.88	You can take out one or two
835.88	and the plane still flies,
839.44	but you take out one too many,
841.04	or maybe that one holding on the wings,
843.68	and the whole system collapses.
847	So now how are you thinking
847	about forests? Differently?
849.92	(Audience) Yes.
851.16	Cool.
853.04	I'm glad.
854.92	So, remember I said earlier
854.92	that I hoped that my research,
858.8	my discoveries would change
858.8	the way we practice forestry.
862.2	Well, I want to take a check on that
874.84	This is about 100 kilometers
874.84	to the west of us,
877.4	just on the border of Banff National Park.
881.12	That's a lot of clear-cuts.
883.02	It's not so pristine.
885.98	In 2014, the World Resources Institute
885.98	reported that Canada in the past decade
891.06	has had the highest forest disturbance
891.06	rate of any country worldwide,
895.62	and I bet you thought it was Brazil.
899.14	In Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.
902.7	Now, by my estimation, that's about
902.7	four times the rate that is sustainable.
909.1	Now, massive disturbance at this scale
909.1	is known to affect hydrological cycles,
913.46	degrade wildlife habitat,
915.46	and emit greenhouse gases
915.46	back into the atmosphere,
918.38	which creates more disturbance
918.38	and more tree diebacks.
923.3	Not only that, we're continuing
923.3	to plant one or two species
926.3	and weed out the aspens and birches.
929.26	These simplified forests lack complexity,
931.86	and they're really vulnerable
931.86	to infections and bugs.
935.3	And as climate changes,
937.22	this is creating a perfect storm
941.42	for extreme events, like the massive
941.42	mountain pine beetle outbreak
945.02	that just swept across North America,
947.82	or that megafire in the last
947.82	couple months in Alberta.
952.98	So I want to come back
952.98	to my final question:
956.98	instead of weakening our forests,
958.78	how can we reinforce them
958.78	and help them deal with climate change?
963.7	Well, you know, the great thing
963.7	about forests as complex systems
967.74	is they have enormous
967.74	capacity to self-heal.
971.7	In our recent experiments,
973.14	we found with patch-cutting
973.14	and retention of hub trees
976.62	and regeneration to a diversity
976.62	of species and genes and genotypes
980.78	that these mycorrhizal networks,
980.78	they recover really rapidly.
985.94	So with this in mind, I want to leave you
985.94	with four simple solutions.
990.3	And we can't kid ourselves
990.3	that these are too complicated to act on.
995.18	First, we all need
995.18	to get out in the forest.
999.5	We need to reestablish
999.5	local involvement in our own forests.
1004.06	You see, most of our forests now
1005.7	are managed using
1005.7	a one-size-fits-all approach,
1008.94	but good forest stewardship
1008.94	requires knowledge of local conditions.
1014.42	Second, we need to save
1014.42	our old-growth forests.
1019.02	These are the repositories of genes
1019.02	and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.
1026.62	So this means less cutting.
1028.9	I don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.
1031.98	And third, when we do cut,
1034.66	we need to save the legacies,
1037.18	the mother trees and networks,
1038.74	and the wood, the genes,
1040.9	so they can pass their wisdom
1040.9	onto the next generation of trees
1044.819	so they can withstand
1044.819	the future stresses coming down the road.
1048.62	We need to be conservationists.
1051.819	And finally, fourthly and finally,
1055.34	we need to regenerate our forests
1055.34	with a diversity of species
1058.82	and genotypes and structures
1061.06	by planting and allowing
1061.06	natural regeneration.
1064.62	We have to give Mother Nature
1064.62	the tools she needs
1067.54	to use her intelligence to self-heal.
1071.18	And we need to remember
1071.18	that forests aren't just a bunch of trees
1074.26	competing with each other,
1075.54	they're supercooperators.

1080.38	Jigs's fall into the outhouse

1087.58	how you think about forests.
1090.94	Thank you.
