12.879	Have you ever experienced
12.879	a moment in your life
16.849	that was so painful and confusing,
20.276	that all you wanted to do
22.098	was learn as much as you could
22.098	to make sense of it all?
25.818	When I was 13, a close family friend
25.818	who was like an uncle to me
30.465	passed away from pancreatic cancer.
33.398	When the disease hit so close to home,
35.766	I knew I needed to learn more.
37.849	So I went online to find answers.
40.716	Using the Internet, I found a variety
40.716	of statistics on pancreatic cancer,
45.485	and what I had found shocked me.
48.41	Over 85 percent of all pancreatic cancers
48.41	are diagnosed late,
53.411	when someone has less
53.411	than a two percent chance of survival.
57.772	Why are we so bad at detecting
57.772	pancreatic cancer?
61.885	The reason?
63.677	"Today's current ""modern"" medicine"
63.677	is a 60-year-old technique.
67.522	That's older than my dad.
69.516	(Laughter)
73.563	But also, it's extremely expensive,
73.563	costing 800 dollars per test,
79.564	and it's grossly inaccurate, missing
85.519	Your doctor would have to be ridiculously
85.519	suspicious that you have the cancer
89.56	in order to give you this test.
91.958	Learning this, I knew there
91.958	had to be a better way.
95.714	So, I set up scientific criteria
97.859	as to what a sensor
97.859	would have to look like
99.969	in order to effectively
99.969	diagnose pancreatic cancer.
103.357	The sensor would have to be:
104.953	inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive,
109.819	selective, and minimally invasive.
114.352	Now, there's a reason why this test
114.352	hasn't been updated in over six decades.
119.396	And that's because when
119.396	we're looking for pancreatic cancer,
122.377	we're looking at your bloodstream,
124.089	which is already abundant in all these
124.089	tons and tons of protein,
128.839	and you're looking for this miniscule
128.839	difference in this tiny amount of protein.
132.638	Just this one protein.
134.135	That's next to impossible.
136.044	However, undeterred
136.044	due to my teenage optimism --
139.799	(Laughter)
141.008	(Applause)
145.604	I went online to a teenager's
145.604	two best friends, Google and Wikipedia.
150.859	I got everything for my homework
150.859	from those two sources.
153.799	(Laughter)
155.08	And what I had found was an article
157.653	that listed a database
157.653	of over 8,000 different proteins
161.524	that are found when you have
161.524	pancreatic cancer.
163.967	So, I decided to go
163.967	and make it my new mission
167.448	to go through all these proteins,
169.205	and see which ones could serve
169.205	as a bio-marker for pancreatic cancer.
173.087	And to make it a bit simpler for myself,
175.387	I decided to map out
175.387	scientific criteria, and here it is.
179.799	Essentially, first, the protein would have
179.799	to be found in all pancreatic cancers,
183.769	at high levels in the bloodstream,
185.536	in the earliest stages,
185.536	but also only in cancer.
189.553	And so I'm just plugging and chugging
189.553	through this gargantuan task,
192.936	and finally, on the 4,000th try,
195.819	when I'm close to losing my sanity,
197.759	I find the protein.
199.408	And the name of the protein
199.408	I'd located was called mesothelin,
203.389	and it's just your ordinary,
203.389	run-of-the-mill type protein,
206.278	unless, of course, you have
206.278	pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer,
209.566	in which case it's found at these
209.566	very high levels in your bloodstream.
212.925	But also, the key is that it's found
212.925	in the earliest stages of the disease,
217.608	when someone has close
217.608	to 100 percent chance of survival.
221.144	So now that I'd found
221.144	a reliable protein I could detect,
224.489	I then shifted my focus
224.489	to actually detecting that protein,
227.45	and thus, pancreatic cancer.
230.103	Now, my breakthrough
230.103	came in a very unlikely place,
233.104	possibly the most unlikely
233.104	place for innovation --
236.135	my high school biology class,
236.135	the absolute stifler of innovation.
240.282	(Laughter)
242.839	(Applause)
246.101	And I had snuck in this article
246.101	on these things called carbon nanotubes,
249.813	and that's just a long,
249.813	thin pipe of carbon
252.294	that's an atom thick, and one
256.092	And despite their extremely small sizes,
258.552	they have these incredible properties.
260.523	They're kind of like the superheroes
260.523	of material science.
263.266	And while I was sneakily reading this
263.266	article under my desk in my biology class,
267.337	we were supposed to be paying attention
267.337	to these other kind of cool molecules,
271.123	called antibodies.
272.517	And these are pretty cool
272.517	because they only react
274.829	with one specific protein,
276.39	but they're not nearly
276.39	as interesting as carbon nanotubes.
279.42	And so then, I was sitting in class,
279.42	and suddenly it hit me:
284.849	I could combine what I was
284.849	reading about, carbon nanotubes,
288.829	with what I was supposed to be
288.829	thinking about, antibodies.
291.869	Essentially, I could weave
291.869	a bunch of these antibodies
294.554	into a network of carbon nanotubes,
296.789	such that you have a network
296.789	that only reacts with one protein,
300.439	but also, due to the properties
300.439	of these nanotubes,
303.819	it will change its electrical properties,
305.819	based on the amount of protein present.
308.252	However, there's a catch.
310.364	These networks of carbon
310.364	nanotubes are extremely flimsy.
314.037	And since they're so delicate,
314.037	they need to be supported.
317.211	So that's why I chose to use paper.
319.532	Making a cancer sensor
319.532	out of paper is about as simple
322.523	as making chocolate chip
322.523	cookies, which I love.
324.964	(Laughs)
327.869	You start with some water,
327.869	pour in some nanotubes,
330.869	add antibodies, mix it up,
330.869	take some paper, dip it, dry it,
335.869	and you can detect cancer.
339.267	(Applause)
345.729	Then, suddenly, a thought occurred
348.859	that kind of put a blemish
348.859	on my amazing plan here.
353.278	I can't really do cancer research
353.278	on my kitchen countertop.
356.239	My mom wouldn't really like that.
358.516	So instead, I decided to go for a lab.
361.611	So I typed up a budget, a materials list,
361.611	a timeline, and a procedure,
366.237	and I emailed it
366.237	to 200 different professors
368.933	at Johns Hopkins University
368.933	and the National Institutes of Health --
372.232	essentially, anyone that had anything
372.232	to do with pancreatic cancer.
375.486	I sat back waiting for these
375.486	positive emails to be pouring in,
378.635	"saying, ""You're a genius!"
378.635	"You're going to save us all!"""
381.456	And --
382.751	(Laughter)
385.651	Then reality took hold,
385.651	and over the course of a month,
389.655	I got 199 rejections
389.655	out of those 200 emails.
394.235	One professor even went
394.235	through my entire procedure,
396.775	painstakingly -- I'm not really
396.775	sure where he got all this time --
399.896	and he went through and said
399.896	why each and every step
403.508	was like the worst mistake
403.508	I could ever make.
406.458	Clearly, the professors did not have
406.458	as high of an opinion of my work as I did.
412.367	However, there is a silver lining.
414.348	"One professor said, ""Maybe I might"
414.348	"be able to help you, kid."""
417.339	So, I went in that direction.
419.678	(Laughter)
423.762	As you can never say no to a kid.
426.157	And so then, three months later,
428.769	I finally nailed down
428.769	a harsh deadline with this guy,
431.664	and I get into his lab, I get
431.664	all excited, and then I sit down,
435.258	I start opening my mouth and talking,
437.162	and five seconds later,
437.162	he calls in another Ph.D.
439.634	Ph.D.s just flock into this little room,
443.392	and they're just firing
443.392	these questions at me,
445.56	and by the end, I kind of felt
445.56	like I was in a clown car.
448.384	There were 20 Ph.D.s,
448.384	plus me and the professor
450.6	crammed into this tiny office space,
452.466	with them firing these
452.466	rapid-fire questions at me,
455.467	trying to sink my procedure.
457.651	How unlikely is that? I mean, pshhh.
459.962	(Laughter)
464.419	However, subjecting myself
464.419	to that interrogation --
467.38	I answered all their questions,
467.38	and I guessed on quite a few
470.351	but I got them right --
471.622	and I finally landed
471.622	the lab space I needed.
475.819	But it was shortly afterwards that
475.819	I discovered my once brilliant procedure
479.639	had something like a million holes in it,
481.789	and over the course of seven months,
483.574	I painstakingly filled
483.574	each and every one of those holes.
486.533	The result?
487.784	One small paper sensor that costs
487.784	three cents and takes five minutes to run.
492.981	This makes it 168 times faster,
496.43	over 26,000 times less expensive,
499.253	and over 400 times more sensitive
499.253	than our current standard
502.799	for pancreatic cancer detection.
505.745	(Applause)
514.738	One of the best parts
514.738	of the sensor, though,
517.079	is that it has close
517.079	to 100 percent accuracy,
519.604	and can detect the cancer
519.604	in the earliest stages,
522.314	when someone has close
522.314	to 100 percent chance of survival.
525.496	And so in the next two to five years,
527.467	this sensor could potentially lift
527.467	the pancreatic cancer survival rates
530.826	from a dismal 5.5 percent
530.826	to close to 100 percent,
534.948	and it would do similar
534.948	for ovarian and lung cancer.
538.091	But it wouldn't stop there.
540.245	By switching out that antibody,
541.923	you can look at a different protein,
541.923	thus, a different disease --
545.453	potentially any disease
545.453	in the entire world.
548.869	So that ranges from heart disease,
548.869	to malaria, HIV, AIDS,
553.517	as well as other forms
553.517	of cancer -- anything.
556.462	And so, hopefully one day,
558.433	we can all have that one extra uncle,
560.869	that one mother, that one brother, sister,
564.127	we can have that one more
564.127	family member to love.
567.023	And that our hearts will be rid
567.023	of that one disease burden
571.809	that comes from pancreatic,
571.809	ovarian and lung cancer,
574.759	and potentially any disease.
576.859	But through the Internet,
576.859	anything is possible.
579.684	Theories can be shared,
580.988	and you don't have to be
580.988	a professor with multiple degrees
583.739	to have your ideas valued.
585.269	It's a neutral space, where
585.269	what you look like, age or gender --
589.334	it doesn't matter.
590.594	It's just your ideas that count.
593.113	For me, it's all about looking
593.113	at the Internet in an entirely new way,
597.839	to realize that there's so much more to it
599.959	than just posting duck-face
599.959	pictures of yourself online.
603.464	(Laughter)
605.277	You could be changing the world.
608.202	So if a 15 year-old who didn't even know
608.202	what a pancreas was
613.488	could find a new way
613.488	to detect pancreatic cancer --
617.451	just imagine what you could do.
619.376	Thank you.
620.638	(Applause)
