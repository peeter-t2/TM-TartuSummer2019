12.888	There's a big question
12.888	at the center of life
15.046	in our democracies today:
16.984	How do we fight terror
16.984	without destroying democracies,
20.353	without trampling human rights?
23.594	I've spent much of my career
23.594	working with journalists,
28.213	with bloggers,
29.395	with activists,
30.733	with human rights researchers
30.733	all around the world,
33.372	and I've come to the conclusion
35.506	that if our democratic societies
35.506	do not double down
40.175	on protecting and defending human rights,
43.182	freedom of the press
44.606	and a free and open internet,
47.932	radical extremist ideologies
47.932	are much more likely to persist.
54.537	(Applause)
57.006	OK, all done. Thank you very much.
58.714	No, just joking.
59.897	(Laughter)
61.716	I actually want to drill down
61.716	on this a little bit.
64.965	So, one of the countries that has been
64.965	on the frontlines of this issue
70.736	is Tunisia,
72.325	which was the only country
72.325	to come out of the Arab Spring
75.865	with a successful democratic revolution.
78.967	Five years later,
80.256	they're struggling
80.256	with serious terror attacks
83.116	and rampant ISIS recruitment.
85.853	And many Tunisians
85.853	are calling on their government
88.661	to do whatever it takes to keep them safe.
92.686	Tunisian cartoonist Nadia Khiari
95.738	has summed up the situation
95.738	with this character who says,
100.037	"""I don't give a damn about human rights."
102.64	I don't give a damn about the revolution.
105.515	I don't give a damn
105.515	about democracy and liberty.
109.587	"I just want to be safe."""
113.672	"""Satisfied?"" asked his jailer."
116.896	"""You're safe now."""
118.941	If the Tunisian people can figure out
121.72	how to deal with their terrorism problem
123.807	without ending up in this place,
126.771	they will be a model
126.771	not only for their region,
129.478	but for all of us.
132.402	The reality is that civil society,
132.402	journalists and activists
136.462	are coming under attack
136.462	from extremist groups on the one hand,
141.315	and, in many countries,
143.069	also from their own governments.
145.528	We're seeing bloggers
145.528	and journalists being jailed,
148.944	charged and intimidated
150.406	by their own governments,
151.948	many of which are allies
151.948	with the West in the war on terror.
155.785	Just three examples.
157.446	A friend and former colleague of mine,
159.326	Hisham Almiraat,
160.582	has been charged
160.582	with threatening state security,
163.65	along with six other activists in Morocco.
167.144	The Saudi blogger Raif Badawi
167.144	has been jailed and flogged
171.641	for insulting Islam and criticizing
171.641	the Saudi regime on his blog.
177.437	More recently, the Turkish representative
177.437	for Reporters Without Borders,
182.951	Erol Ã–nderoglu,
184.822	has been detained and charged
184.822	with spreading terrorist propaganda,
189.59	because he and some other activists
189.59	have been supporting Kurdish media.
195.025	Anti-terror measures
195.025	quickly turn into state repression
198.736	without strong protection
198.736	for minority communities
202.297	and for peaceful debate;
204.729	this needs to be supported
204.729	by a robust, independent local media.
209.749	But while that's not really happening,
212.077	Washington is teaming up
212.077	with Silicon Valley and with Hollywood
216.701	to pour millions -- hundreds
216.701	of millions of dollars --
221.101	"into what's called ""counter-messaging,"""
223.712	a fancy word for propaganda.
226.154	To counter the terrorist propaganda
226.154	spreading all over the internet,
232.614	in Europe, Internet Referral
232.614	Units are being set up,
236.384	so that people can report
236.384	on extremist content that they find
240.385	and get it censored.
242.191	The problem is,
243.575	that all of this propaganda,
243.575	monitoring and censorship
248.204	completely fails to make up for the fact
253.236	that the people who are
253.236	the most credible voices,
258.334	who can present credible ideas
258.334	and alternative solutions
262.443	to real economic, social and political
262.443	problems in their community
266.568	that are causing people to turn
266.568	to extremism in the first place,
270.875	are being silenced
270.875	by their own governments.
274.214	This is all adding up to a decrease
274.214	in freedom across the world.
279.801	Freedom House,
281.001	the human rights organization,
283.055	reports that 2015 marks
283.055	the 10th straight year in a row
287.415	of decline in freedom worldwide.
290.495	And this is not just
290.495	because of the actions
292.915	of authoritarian governments.
294.97	It's also because democratic governments
297.491	are increasingly cracking
297.491	down on dissenters,
301.818	whistle-blowers
303.01	and investigative journalists.
304.947	UN Secretary General
304.947	Ban Ki-Moon has warned
307.405	"that ""preventing extremism and promoting"
307.405	"human rights go hand-in-hand."""
311.866	It's not to say that governments
311.866	shouldn't keep us safe --
314.694	of course they should --
315.869	but we need public oversight, transparency
318.488	and accountability to the rule of law.
320.753	Meanwhile,
321.929	extremists are literally killing off
321.929	civil society in some countries.
326.198	Since 2013 in Bangladesh,
328.756	over a dozen secular bloggers
328.756	and community activists
333.296	have been literally
333.296	slaughtered by extremists
336.253	while the government has done very little.
339.008	From the city of Raqqa in Syria,
341.979	people like Ruqia Hassan and Naji Jerf
341.979	have been assassinated
346.579	for their reporting
346.579	out of ISIS-controlled territory.
350.315	The citizen media group called
350.315	Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently
355.923	relies on strong encryption
355.923	to send out their reports
360.166	and shield themselves
360.166	from interception and surveillance.
364.057	Yet authorities in countries
364.057	like the United States,
366.831	the United Kingdom
366.831	and many other democracies
369.398	are seeking to use the law
371.275	to either weaken or outright ban
371.275	strong encryption,
375.756	because the bad guys are using it, too.
378.465	We have got to fight for the right
378.465	of citizens to use strong encryption.
382.749	Otherwise, dissent
382.749	and investigative journalism
386.403	are going to become even more difficult
388.826	in even more places.
390.654	And the bad guys -- the criminals
390.654	and terrorists --
393.149	are still going to find
393.149	ways to communicate.
395.433	Kudos to the companies
395.433	that are standing up
398.096	for their users' right to use encryption.
401.595	But when it comes to censorship,
403.885	the picture is much more troubling.
406.61	Yes, there's a real problem
408.452	of extremist content
408.452	spreading all over the internet.
411.739	And Facebook, YouTube and Twitter
411.739	are among the many companies
415.296	who report having taken down hundreds
415.296	of thousands of pieces of content
419.747	and deactivating accounts
421.351	that are connected
421.351	to the extremist's speech.
423.855	The problem is their enforcement
423.855	mechanisms are a complete black box,
428.199	and there is collateral damage.
430.211	Take, for example, Iyad el-Baghdadi,
433.516	an activist who makes fun
433.516	of ISIS on Twitter.
436.176	He had his account deactivated,
438.016	because he shares a surname
438.016	with a prominent ISIS leader.
442.22	Last December,
443.395	a number of women named Isis,
445.038	which also happens to be
445.038	the name of an Egyptian goddess,
448.514	had their accounts deactivated.
450.742	And this woman,
452.382	who lives in the United States
452.382	and is a computer programmer,
455.511	reported on Twitter
455.511	about her deactivation on Facebook,
459.261	managed to get enough media attention
459.261	to have her account reinstated.
462.978	But that's the thing --
462.978	she had to get media attention.
466.02	And journalists aren't immune.
467.553	David Thomson,
468.751	an expert on terrorism and reporter
468.751	for Radio France International,
472.173	had reports deleted
472.173	from his Facebook account
475.76	and had his account
475.76	deactivated for several days,
478.573	because they contained
478.573	pictures of ISIS flags,
482.498	even though he was just reporting on ISIS,
484.578	not promoting it.
486.253	And then we have stories from people
486.253	like this Egyptian man,
489.266	Ahmed Abdellahy,
490.907	who reported recently in an event
490.907	in Washington DC
496.074	that some of his arguments
496.074	with extremists --
498.272	he now spends his time on social media
498.272	arguing with ISIS followers,
504.609	trying to get them to turn away --
507.141	some of his arguments
507.141	with these extremists get deleted,
512.16	which he believes has the effect
512.16	of shielding them
515.231	from alternative points of view.
518.217	It's unclear whether Facebook
518.217	even knows the extent
522.626	of the collateral damage,
524.162	or the other companies as well.
526.558	But we do know that journalism,
526.558	activism and public debate
530.196	are being silenced in the effort
530.196	to stamp out extremist speech.
535.398	So with these companies having so much
535.398	power over the public discourse,
539.663	they need to be held accountable.
541.281	They need to carry out impact assessment
544.186	to identify and fix the problems
544.186	that we're clearly seeing.
548.727	They need to be more transparent
548.727	about their enforcement mechanisms,
552.527	and they need to have clear
552.527	appeal and grievance mechanisms,
555.953	so people can get
555.953	their content reinstated.
558.64	Now, I've been talking
558.64	for the last 10 minutes
561.857	about how governments and companies
561.857	are making it more difficult
565.996	for people like these.
567.356	This is a picture of members
567.356	of the citizen media network,
570.863	Global Voices,
572.038	that I helped to cofound over 10 years ago
574.155	with my friend, Ethan Zuckerman.
576.175	Interestingly, about 5 years ago,
576.175	right after the Arab Spring,
580.669	the data scientist Gilad Lotan
583.35	created a network map
583.35	of the people in Global Voices
588.291	who were heavy users of Twitter
588.291	during the Arab Spring.
591.237	And he found that many of these people
591.237	served as key information nodes
596.479	between activists and journalists
598.367	throughout the Tunisian
598.367	and Egyptian revolution.
601.416	We've got to make sure
601.416	that these people not only survive,
606.706	but are able to continue to thrive.
609.216	Many of them are still active,
610.894	other than the ones who have gone to jail
612.994	or have been driven into hiding or exile.
616.668	All around the world,
618.51	people who are sick and tired
618.51	of fear and oppression
621.851	are linking up in their communities
621.851	and across borders.
625.325	We've got to do everything we can
625.325	to push our governments and companies
629.612	to do a better job
629.612	of protecting their rights.
632.572	We've also got to be more mindful
634.581	about how our own personal, political,
634.581	consumer and business choices
639.45	affect people like these around the world.
643.112	Also, if you follow the news,
645.568	it's pretty clear that that alone
645.568	isn't going to be enough.
649.694	We've got to take personal
649.694	responsibility by joining --
653.478	or at very least, actively supporting --
656.919	the growing ecosystem
656.919	of individuals and groups
660.464	who are fighting for social justice,
662.574	environmental sustainability,
664.661	government accountability,
666.248	human rights, freedom of the press
668.149	and a free and open internet,
669.729	all around the world.
671.509	I believe that, ultimately,
671.509	we can overcome
676.244	the digitally empowered networks
676.244	of extremism, demagoguery and hate.
683.379	But ...
685.104	we've got to do this by really
685.104	beefing up the global networks
691.852	of citizens around the world,
693.664	powered by people
693.664	who are working hard every day,
697.468	and taking personal risk
699.714	for a future world that is more
699.714	peaceful, just, open and free.
705.541	Thanks very much for listening.
707.094	(Applause)
