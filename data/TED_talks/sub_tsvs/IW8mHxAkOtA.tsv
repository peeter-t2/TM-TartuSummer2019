12.944	When I was 14 years old,
12.944	I was interested in science --
17.339	fascinated by it,
17.339	excited to learn about it.
20.479	And I had a high school science teacher
20.479	who would say to the class,
24.562	"""The girls don't have to listen to this."""
28.8	Encouraging, yes.
30.229	(Laughter)
31.34	I chose not to listen --
31.34	but to that statement alone.
36.71	So let me take you
36.71	to the Andes mountains in Chile,
	northeast of Santiago.
45.284	It's very remote, it's very dry
45.284	and it's very beautiful.
50.087	And there's not much there.
51.486	There are condors, there are tarantulas,
54.15	and at night, when the light dims,
56.671	it reveals one of the darkest
56.671	skies on Earth.
60.906	It's kind of a magic place, the mountain.
63.48	It's a wonderful combination
63.48	of very remote mountaintop
67.841	with exquisitely sophisticated technology.
71.508	And our ancestors, for as long
71.508	as there's been recorded history,
75.124	have looked at the night sky
75.124	and pondered the nature of our existence.
80.506	And we're no exception, our generation.
83.536	The only difficulty is
83.536	that the night sky now is blocked
86.656	by the glare of city lights.
89.058	And so astronomers go
89.058	to these very remote mountaintops
92.696	to view and to study the cosmos.
94.981	So telescopes
94.981	are our window to the cosmos.
100.042	It's no exaggeration to say that
100.042	the Southern Hemisphere is going to be
104.089	the future of astronomy
104.089	for the 21st century.
108.135	We have an array
108.135	of existing telescopes already,
111.391	in the Andes mountains in Chile,
113.447	and that's soon to be joined by a really
113.447	sensational array of new capability.
118.608	There will be two international groups
118.608	that are going to be building
121.831	giant telescopes, sensitive
121.831	to optical radiation, as our eyes are.
127.669	There will be a survey telescope
129.564	that will be scanning the sky
129.564	every few nights.
133.366	There will be radio telescopes,
134.916	sensitive to long-wavelength
134.916	radio radiation.
138.448	And then there will be
138.448	telescopes in space.
141.587	There'll be a successor
141.587	to the Hubble Space Telescope;
144.508	it's called the James Webb Telescope,
146.569	and it will be launched in 2018.
149.078	There'll be a satellite called TESS
150.808	that will discover planets
150.808	outside of our solar system.
156.259	For the last decade,
156.259	I've been leading a group --
158.913	a consortium -- international group,
161.154	to build what will be, when it's finished,
164.161	the largest optical
164.161	telescope in existence.
167.489	It's called the Giant
167.489	Magellan Telescope, or GMT.
171.748	This telescope is going to have mirrors
171.748	that are 8.4 meters in diameter --
176.505	each of the mirrors.
177.691	That's almost 27 feet.
179.354	So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe
179.354	out to the fourth row in this audience.
183.85	Each of the seven mirrors
183.85	in this telescope
186.898	will be almost 27 feet in diameter.
190.706	Together, the seven mirrors
190.706	in this telescope will comprise
196.723	So, essentially the size
196.723	of this entire auditorium.
200.448	The whole telescope will stand
200.448	about 43 meters high,
204.118	and again, being in Rio,
206.832	some of you have been to see
206.832	the statue of the giant Christ.
210.475	The scale is comparable in height;
212.328	in fact, it's smaller
212.328	than this telescope will be.
216.192	It's comparable to the size
216.192	of the Statue of Liberty.
219.721	And it's going to be housed
219.721	in an enclosure that's 22 stories --
225.717	But it's an unusual building
225.717	to protect this telescope.
228.743	It will have open windows to the sky,
230.553	be able to point and look at the sky,
232.925	and it will actually rotate on a base --
235.577	2,000 tons of rotating building.
239.719	The Giant Magellan Telescope
239.719	will have 10 times the resolution
244.576	of the Hubble Space Telescope.
246.934	It will be 20 million times
246.934	more sensitive than the human eye.
251.593	And it may, for the first time ever,
251.593	be capable of finding life on planets
257.753	outside of our solar system.
260.469	It's going to allow us to look back
260.469	at the first light in the universe --
264.866	literally, the dawn of the cosmos.
267.257	The cosmic dawn.
269.763	It's a telescope that's
269.763	going to allow us to peer back,
273.541	witness galaxies as they were
273.541	when they were actually assembling,
277.35	the first black holes in the universe,
277.35	the first galaxies.
281.69	Now, for thousands of years,
281.69	we have been studying the cosmos,
286.322	we've been wondering
286.322	about our place in the universe.
289	The ancient Greeks told us
290.689	that the Earth was the center
290.689	of the universe.
293.195	Five hundred years ago,
293.195	Copernicus displaced the Earth,
296.845	and put the Sun
296.845	at the heart of the cosmos.
300.785	And as we've learned over the centuries,
302.863	since Galileo Galilei,
302.863	the Italian scientist,
305.605	first turned, in that time, a two-inch,
305.605	very small telescope, to the sky,
310.879	every time we have built
310.879	larger telescopes,
313.918	we have learned something
313.918	about the universe;
316.141	we've made discoveries, without exception.
320.908	We've learned in the 20th century
320.908	that the universe is expanding
324.669	and that our own solar system
324.669	is not at the center of that expansion.
329.757	We know now that the universe
329.757	is made of about 100 billion galaxies
335.06	that are visible to us,
336.734	and each one of those galaxies
336.734	has 100 billion stars within it.
343.234	So we're looking now
343.234	at the deepest image of the cosmos
346.12	that's ever been taken.
348.015	It was taken using
348.015	the Hubble Space Telescope,
350.857	and by pointing the telescope at what
350.857	was previously a blank region of sky,
355.771	before the launch of Hubble.
357.394	And if you can imagine this tiny area,
359.681	it's only one-fiftieth
359.681	of the size of the full moon.
363.035	So, if you can imagine the full moon.
365.099	And there are now 10,000 galaxies
365.099	visible within that image.
369.782	And the faintness of those images
369.782	and the tiny size is only a result
374.484	of the fact that those galaxies
374.484	are so far away, the vast distances.
378.915	And each of those galaxies
378.915	may contain within it
381.872	a few billion or even hundreds
381.872	of billions of individual stars.
387.591	Telescopes are like time machines.
389.634	So the farther back we look in space,
389.634	the further back we see in time.
394.47	And they're like light buckets --
394.47	literally, they collect light.
397.68	So larger the bucket,
397.68	the larger the mirror we have,
400.938	the more light we can see,
400.938	and the farther back we can view.
405.61	So, we've learned in the last century
407.905	that there are exotic objects
407.905	in the universe -- black holes.
410.863	We've even learned
410.863	that there's dark matter and dark energy
413.664	that we can't see.
415.218	So you're looking now
415.218	at an actual image of dark matter.
418.8	(Laughter)
419.974	You got it. Not all audiences get that.
422.641	(Laughter)
424.43	So the way we infer
424.43	the presence of dark matter --
427.178	we can't see it -- but there's
427.178	an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.
433.302	We now can look out,
433.302	we see this sea of galaxies
436.704	in a universe that's expanding.
438.862	What I do myself is to measure
438.862	the expansion of the universe,
442.189	and one of the projects
442.189	that I carried out in the 1990s
445.354	used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure
445.354	how fast the universe is expanding.
451.356	We can now trace back to 14 billion years.
455.731	We've learned over time
455.731	that stars have individual histories;
460.091	that is, they have birth,
460.091	they have middle ages
463.044	and some of them
463.044	even have dramatic deaths.
465.829	So the embers from those stars actually
465.829	then form the new stars that we see,
471.968	most of which turn out to have
471.968	planets going around them.
476.272	And one of the really surprising results
476.272	in the last 20 years
480.331	has been the discovery
480.331	of other planets going around other stars.
484.481	These are called exoplanets.
486.411	And until 1995, we didn't even know
486.411	the existence of any other planets,
491.431	other than going around our own sun.
494.36	But now, there are almost 2,000
494.36	other planets orbiting other stars
500.805	that we can now detect,
500.805	measure masses for.
503.389	There are 500 of those
503.389	that are multiple-planet systems.
507.085	And there are 4,000 --
507.085	and still counting -- other candidates
511.069	for planets orbiting other stars.
513.79	They come in a bewildering variety
513.79	of different kinds.
517.134	There are Jupiter-like
517.134	planets that are hot,
520.444	there are other planets that are icy,
520.444	there are water worlds
524.726	and there are rocky planets
524.726	"like the Earth, so-called ""super-Earths,"""
528.004	and there have even been planets
528.004	that have been speculated diamond worlds.
533.794	So we know there's at least one planet,
533.794	our own Earth, in which there is life.
538.773	We've even found planets
538.773	that are orbiting two stars.
542.957	That's no longer the province
542.957	of science fiction.
547.211	So around our own planet,
547.211	we know there's life,
549.449	we've developed a complex life,
549.449	we now can question our own origins.
555.728	And given all that we've discovered,
555.728	the overwhelming numbers now suggest
559.972	that there may be millions, perhaps --
559.972	maybe even hundreds of millions --
564.068	of other [planets]
564.068	that are close enough --
566.871	just the right distance from their stars
566.871	that they're orbiting --
570.185	to have the existence of liquid water
570.185	and maybe could potentially support life.
576.121	So we marvel now at those odds,
576.121	the overwhelming odds,
580.319	and the amazing thing
580.319	is that within the next decade,
583.286	the GMT may be able to take spectra
583.286	of the atmospheres of those planets,
588.54	and determine whether or not
588.54	they have the potential for life.
593.702	So, what is the GMT project?
595.506	It's an international project.
597.404	It includes Australia, South Korea,
597.404	and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,
603.277	that the newest partner
603.277	in our telescope is Brazil.
606.825	(Applause)
611.308	It also includes a number of institutions
611.308	across the United States,
616.122	including Harvard University,
619.242	the Smithsonian
619.242	and the Carnegie Institutions,
622.21	and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago,
622.21	Texas-Austin and Texas A&amp;M University.
629.074	It also involves Chile.
632.723	So, the making of the mirrors
632.723	in this telescope is also fascinating
635.959	in its own right.
637.348	Take chunks of glass, melt them
637.348	in a furnace that is itself rotating.
642.751	This happens underneath
642.751	the football stadium
644.866	at the University of Arizona.
646.932	It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.
649.892	Nobody know it's happening.
651.738	And there's essentially
651.738	a rotating cauldron.
655.086	The mirrors are cast
655.086	and they're cooled very slowly,
658.145	and then they're polished
658.145	to an exquisite precision.
661.637	And so, if you think
661.637	about the precision of these mirrors,
664.738	the bumps on the mirror,
664.738	over the entire 27 feet,
669.315	amount to less
669.315	than one-millionth of an inch.
673.018	So, can you visualize that?
675.089	Ow!
676.264	(Laughter)
677.612	That's one five-thousandths
677.612	of the width of one of my hairs,
683.907	over this entire 27 feet.
686.068	It's a spectacular achievement.
687.962	It's what allows us to have
687.962	the precision that we will have.
692.876	So, what does that precision buy us?
695.843	So the GMT, if you can imagine --
698.606	if I were to hold up a coin,
698.606	which I just happen to have,
703.079	and I look at the face of that coin,
703.079	I can see from here
708.094	the writing on the coin;
708.094	I can see the face on that coin.
712.103	My guess that even in the front row,
712.103	you can't see that.
715.645	But if we were to turn
715.645	the Giant Magellan Telescope,
718.531	all 80-feet diameter
718.531	that we see in this auditorium,
721.928	and point it 200 miles away,
725.021	if I were standing in São Paulo,
725.021	we could resolve the face of this coin.
730.913	That's the extraordinary resolution
730.913	and power of this telescope.
735.761	And if we were --
738.483	(Applause)
742.377	If an astronaut went up to the Moon,
742.377	a quarter of a million miles away,
747.002	and lit a candle -- a single candle --
749.942	then we would be able
749.942	to detect it, using the GMT.
753.347	Quite extraordinary.
757.334	This is a simulated image
757.334	of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.
763.039	"""Nearby"" is astronomical,"
763.039	it's all relative.
765.648	It's tens of millions of light-years away.
768.175	This is what this cluster would look like.
770.213	So look at those four bright objects,
772.405	and now lets compare it with a camera
772.405	on the Hubble Space Telescope.
776.436	You can see faint detail
776.436	that starts to come through.
779.639	And now finally -- and look how dramatic
779.639	this is -- this is what the GMT will see.
785.958	So, keep your eyes on those
785.958	bright images again.
788.352	This is what we see on one of the most
788.352	powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,
792.794	and this, again, what the GMT will see.
796.554	Extraordinary precision.
798.975	So, where are we?
800.321	We have now leveled the top
800.321	of the mountaintop in Chile.
803.527	We blasted that off.
805.314	We've tested and polished
805.314	the first mirror.
808.057	We've cast the second
808.057	and the third mirrors.
810.67	And we're about to cast the fourth mirror.
812.963	We had a series of reviews this year,
814.874	international panels
814.874	that came in and reviewed us,
817.44	"and said, ""You're ready"
817.44	"to go to construction."""
819.995	And so we plan on building this telescope
819.995	with the first four mirrors.
823.368	We want to get on the air quickly,
823.368	and be taking science data --
827.521	what we astronomers call
827.521	"""first light,"" in 2021."
833.031	And the full telescope will be finished
833.031	in the middle of the next decade,
836.501	with all seven mirrors.
838.542	So we're now poised to look back
838.542	at the distant universe,
842.124	the cosmic dawn.
843.804	We'll be able to study other planets
843.804	in exquisite detail.
848.424	But for me, one of the most
848.424	exciting things about building the GMT
852.185	is the opportunity
852.185	to actually discover something
855.039	that we don't know about --
855.039	that we can't even imagine at this point,
858.333	something completely new.
860.713	And my hope is that with the construction
860.713	of this and other facilities,
864.367	that many young women and men
864.367	will be inspired to reach for the stars.
870.036	Thank you very much.
871.332	Obrigado.
872.831	(Applause)
878.748	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.
880.374	Stay with me, because
880.374	I have a question for you.
882.665	You mentioned different facilities.
885.086	So the Magellan Telescope is going up,
885.086	but also ALMA and others in Chile
889.963	and elsewhere, including in Hawaii.
892.772	Is it about cooperation
892.772	and complementarity, or about competition?
896.872	I know there's competition in terms
896.872	of funding, but what about the science?
900.618	Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science,
900.618	they're very complementary.
903.859	The telescopes that are in space,
903.859	the telescopes on the ground,
906.91	telescopes with different
906.91	wavelength capability,
909.364	telescopes even that are similar,
909.364	but different instruments --
912.331	they will all look at different parts
912.331	of the questions that we're asking.
916.101	So when we discover other planets,
916.101	we'll be able to test those observations,
919.752	we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,
921.864	be able to look in space
921.864	with very high resolution.
924.763	So, they're very complementary.
926.264	You're right about
926.264	the funding, we compete;
928.525	but scientifically,
928.525	it's very complementary.
931.214	BG: Wendy, thank you very much
931.214	for coming to TEDGlobal.
933.891	WF: Thank you.
935.066	(Applause)
