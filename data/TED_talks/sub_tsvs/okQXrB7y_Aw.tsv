15.26	This cell phone
18.26	started its trajectory
21.26	in an artisanal mine
23.26	in the Eastern Congo.
25.26	It's mined by armed gangs
27.26	using slaves, child slaves,
29.26	what the U.N. Security Council
31.26	"calls ""blood minerals,"""
33.26	then traveled into some components
35.26	and ended up in a factory
37.26	in Shinjin in China.
39.26	That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide
42.26	already this year.
44.26	One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
48.26	We all love chocolate.
50.26	We buy it for our kids.
52.26	Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana
55.26	and it's harvested by children.
58.26	Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.
60.26	Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones
63.26	to come and work on the coffee plantations.
66.26	Heparin -- a blood thinner,
68.26	a pharmaceutical product --
70.26	starts out in artisanal workshops
73.26	like this in China,
75.26	because the active ingredient
77.26	comes from pigs' intestines.
80.26	"Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie ""Blood Diamond."""
83.26	This is a mine in Zimbabwe
85.26	right now.
87.26	Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest
89.26	exporter of cotton on Earth.
91.26	Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,
94.26	the government shuts down the schools,
96.26	puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields
99.26	to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.
102.26	It's forced child labor
104.26	on an institutional scale.
107.26	And all of those products probably end their lives
110.26	in a dump like this one in Manila.
112.26	These places, these origins,
115.26	represent governance gaps.
117.26	That's the politest description
119.26	I have for them.
122.26	These are the dark pools
124.26	where global supply chains begin --
127.26	the global supply chains,
129.26	which bring us our favorite brand name products.
132.26	Some of these governance gaps
135.26	are run by rogue states.
138.26	Some of them are not states anymore at all.
140.26	They're failed states.
142.26	Some of them
144.26	are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation
147.26	is the best way to attract investment,
150.26	promote trade.
152.26	Either way, they present us
154.26	with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.
158.26	I know that none of us want to be accessories
160.26	after the fact
163.26	of a human rights abuse
165.26	in a global supply chain.
167.26	But right now,
169.26	most of the companies involved in these supply chains
172.26	don't have any way
174.26	of assuring us
176.26	that nobody had to mortgage their future,
178.26	nobody had to sacrifice their rights
181.26	to bring us our favorite
183.26	brand name product.
186.26	Now, I didn't come here to depress you
188.26	about the state of the global supply chain.
191.26	We need a reality check.
193.26	We need to recognize just how serious
196.26	a deficit of rights we have.
199.26	This is an independent republic,
201.26	probably a failed state.
203.26	It's definitely not a democratic state.
207.26	And right now,
209.26	that independent republic of the supply chain
211.26	is not being governed
213.26	in a way that would satisfy us,
216.26	that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.
220.26	Now, that's not a new story.
222.26	You've seen the documentaries
224.26	of sweatshops making garments
226.26	all over the world, even in developed countries.
229.26	You want to see the classic sweatshop,
231.26	meet me at Madison Square Garden,
233.26	I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.
236.26	But take the example of heparin.
239.26	It's a pharmaceutical product.
241.26	You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,
244.26	probably squeaky clean.
248.26	The problem is that the active ingredient in there --
250.26	as I mentioned earlier --
252.26	comes from pigs.
254.26	The main American manufacturer
257.26	of that active ingredient
259.26	decided a few years ago to relocate to China
262.26	because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.
265.26	And their factory in China --
267.26	which probably is pretty clean --
270.26	is getting all of the ingredients
272.26	from backyard abattoirs,
274.26	where families slaughter pigs
276.26	and extract the ingredient.
279.26	So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal
281.26	which killed about 80 people around the world,
283.26	because of contaminants
285.26	that crept into the heparin supply chain.
288.26	Worse, some of the suppliers
290.26	realized that they could substitute a product
294.26	which mimicked heparin in tests.
298.26	This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,
301.26	whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,
304.26	cost 900 dollars a pound.
307.26	A no-brainer.
309.26	The problem was that it killed more people.
312.26	And so you're asking yourself,
314.26	"""How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration"
316.26	allowed this to happen?
318.26	How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs
320.26	"allow this to happen?"""
322.26	And the answer is quite simple:
325.26	the Chinese define these facilities
327.26	as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,
330.26	so they don't audit them.
332.26	And the USFDA
334.26	has a jurisdictional problem.
336.26	This is offshore.
338.26	They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --
340.26	about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.
343.26	There are 500
345.26	of these facilities
347.26	producing active ingredients in China alone.
350.26	In fact, about 80 percent
353.26	of the active ingredients in medicines now
355.26	come from offshore,
357.26	particularly China and India,
359.26	and we don't have a governance system.
362.26	We don't have a regulatory system
364.26	able to ensure
366.26	that that production is safe.
370.26	We don't have a system to ensure
372.26	that human rights, basic dignity,
374.26	are ensured.
377.26	So at a national level --
380.26	and we work in about 60 different countries --
382.26	at a national level
384.26	we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments
386.26	to regulate production
389.26	on their own soil.
392.26	And the real problem with the global supply chain
394.26	is that it's supranational.
396.26	So governments who are failing,
398.26	who are dropping the ball
400.26	at a national level,
402.26	have even less ability to get their arms around the problem
404.26	at an international level.
407.26	And you can just look at the headlines.
409.26	Take Copenhagen last year --
412.26	complete failure of governments
414.26	to do the right thing
416.26	in the face of an international challenge.
419.26	Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --
422.26	stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.
427.26	You can take any one
429.26	of the major global challenges we've discussed this week
432.26	and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments
435.26	to step up and come up with solutions,
438.26	responses,
440.26	to those international problems?
443.26	And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.
447.26	Their voters are local.
449.26	They have parochial interests.
451.26	They can't subordinate those interests
453.26	to the greater global public good.
456.26	So, if we're going to ensure the delivery
458.26	of the key public goods
460.26	at an international level --
462.26	in this case, in the global supply chain --
465.26	we have to come up with a different mechanism.
468.26	We need a different machine.
472.26	Fortunately, we have some examples.
476.26	In the 1990s,
478.26	there were a whole series of scandals
480.26	concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --
482.26	child labor, forced labor,
484.26	serious health and safety abuses.
487.26	And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,
489.26	convened a meeting at the White House,
492.26	invited industry, human rights NGOs,
495.26	trade unions, the Department of Labor,
497.26	got them all in a room
499.26	"and said, ""Look,"
501.26	I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.
503.26	I don't know how to prevent that,
505.26	but I'm at least going to use my good offices
507.26	to get you folks together
509.26	"to come up with a response."""
512.26	So they formed a White House task force,
514.26	and they spent about three years arguing
517.26	about who takes how much responsibility
520.26	in the global supply chain.
523.26	Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.
526.26	They don't own those facilities.
528.26	They don't employ those workers.
530.26	They're not legally liable.
533.26	Everybody else at the table
535.26	"said, ""Folks, that doesn't cut it."
537.26	You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,
540.26	to make sure that that product
542.26	gets from wherever to the store
545.26	in a way that allows us to consume it,
548.26	without fear of our safety,
551.26	or without having to sacrifice our conscience
555.26	"to consume that product."""
557.26	"So they agreed, ""Okay, what we'll do"
560.26	is we agree on a common set of standards,
562.26	code of conduct.
564.26	We'll apply that throughout
566.26	our global supply chain
568.26	regardless of ownership or control.
570.26	"We'll make it part of the contract."""
573.26	And that was a stroke of absolute genius,
576.26	because what they did
578.26	was they harnessed the power of the contract,
581.26	private power,
583.26	to deliver public goods.
585.26	And let's face it,
587.26	the contract from a major multinational brand
589.26	to a supplier in India or China
592.26	has much more persuasive value
594.26	than the local labor law,
596.26	the local environmental regulations,
598.26	the local human rights standards.
601.26	Those factories will probably never see an inspector.
604.26	If the inspector did come along,
607.26	it would be amazing if they were able
609.26	to resist the bribe.
613.26	Even if they did their jobs,
615.26	and they cited those facilities for their violations,
619.26	the fine would be derisory.
621.26	But you lose that contract
623.26	for a major brand name,
625.26	that's the difference
627.26	between staying in business or going bankrupt.
630.26	That makes a difference.
632.26	So what we've been able to do
634.26	is we've been able to harness
636.26	the power and the influence
638.26	of the only truly transnational institution
641.26	in the global supply chain,
643.26	that of the multinational company,
646.26	and get them to do the right thing,
648.26	get them to use that power for good,
651.26	to deliver the key public goods.
655.26	Now of course, this doesn't come naturally
657.26	to multinational companies.
659.26	They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.
662.26	But they are extremely efficient organizations.
665.26	They have resources,
667.26	and if we can add the will, the commitment,
670.26	they know how to deliver that product.
675.26	Now, getting there is not easy.
678.26	Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,
681.26	they're not there.
683.26	You need a safe space.
685.26	You need a place where people can come together,
688.26	sit down without fear of judgment,
690.26	without recrimination,
692.26	to actually face the problem,
694.26	agree on the problem and come up with solutions.
697.26	We can do it. The technical solutions are there.
700.26	The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,
703.26	the lack of partnership
705.26	between NGOs, campaign groups,
707.26	civil society organizations
710.26	and multinational companies.
713.26	If we can put those two together in a safe space,
716.26	get them to work together,
718.26	we can deliver public goods right now,
721.26	or in extremely short supply.
724.26	This is a radical proposition,
726.26	and it's crazy to think
728.26	that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl
731.26	leaving your rural village
734.26	to go and work in a factory in Dhaka --
742.26	your best chance of enjoying rights at work
745.26	is if that factory is producing
747.26	for a brand name company
749.26	which has got a code of conduct
751.26	and made that code of conduct part of the contract.
755.26	It's crazy.
757.26	Multinationals are protecting human rights.
759.26	I know there's going to be disbelief.
761.26	"You'll say, ""How can we trust them?"""
763.26	Well, we don't.
765.26	It's the old arms control phrase:
767.26	"""Trust, but verify."""
769.26	So we audit.
771.26	We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,
774.26	we do a random sample,
776.26	we send inspectors on an unannounced basis
779.26	to inspect those facilities,
781.26	and then we publish the results.
783.26	Transparency is absolutely critical to this.
787.26	You can call yourself responsible,
790.26	but responsibility without accountability
793.26	often doesn't work.
795.26	So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,
798.26	we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --
801.26	respect for human rights --
803.26	and we're checking.
805.26	You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.
807.26	Go to the website. Look at the audit results.
810.26	Ask yourself, is this company behaving
812.26	in a socially responsible way?
815.26	Can I buy that product
817.26	without compromising my ethics?
820.26	That's the way the system works.
825.26	I hate the idea
827.26	that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.
830.26	I hate the idea
832.26	that governments have dropped this ball
834.26	and I can't get used to the idea
837.26	that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.
840.26	I've been at this for 30 years,
842.26	and in that time I've seen
844.26	the ability, the commitment, the will of government
847.26	to do this decline,
849.26	and I don't see them making a comeback right now.
852.26	So we started out thinking
854.26	this was a stopgap measure.
856.26	We're now thinking that, in fact,
859.26	this is probably the start
861.26	of a new way of regulating and addressing
864.26	international challenges.
866.26	Call it network governance. Call it what you will.
869.26	The private actors,
872.26	companies and NGOs,
874.26	are going to have to get together
876.26	to face the major challenges we are going to face.
878.26	Just look at pandemics --
880.26	swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.
883.26	Look at the health systems in so many countries.
885.26	Do they have the resources
887.26	to face up to a serious pandemic?
890.26	No.
892.26	Could the private sector and NGOs
895.26	get together and marshal a response?
897.26	Absolutely.
899.26	What they lack is that safe space
901.26	to come together, agree
903.26	and move to action.
905.26	That's what we're trying to provide.
909.26	I know as well
911.26	that this often seems
913.26	like an overwhelming level of responsibility
915.26	for people to assume.
917.26	"""You want me to deliver human rights"
919.26	throughout my global supply chain.
921.26	"There are thousands of suppliers in there."""
924.26	It seems too daunting, too dangerous,
927.26	for any company to take on.
929.26	But there are companies.
931.26	We have 4,000 companies who are members.
934.26	Some of them are very, very large companies.
936.26	The sporting goods industry, in particular,
938.26	stepped up to the plate and have done it.
941.26	The example, the role model, is there.
945.26	And whenever we discuss
947.26	one of these problems that we have to address --
949.26	child labor in cottonseed farms in India --
952.26	this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.
956.26	It seems overwhelming.
958.26	The numbers just make you want to zone out.
961.26	But we break it down to some basic realities.
964.26	And human rights
966.26	comes down to a very simple proposition:
969.26	can I give this person their dignity back?
972.26	Poor people,
974.26	people whose human rights have been violated --
976.26	the crux of that
978.26	is the loss of dignity,
980.26	the lack of dignity.
982.26	It starts with just giving people back their dignity.
985.26	I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon
988.26	just next to Delhi,
990.26	one of the flashiest, brightest new cities
993.26	popping up in India right now,
996.26	and I was talking to workers
998.26	who worked in garment sweatshops down the road,
1000.26	and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.
1004.26	They didn't say money.
1007.26	"They said, ""The people who employ us"
1010.26	treat us like we are less than human,
1013.26	like we don't exist.
1015.26	"Please ask them to treat us like human beings."""
1019.26	That's my simple understanding of human rights.
1021.26	That's my simple proposition to you,
1024.26	my simple plea to every decision-maker
1027.26	in this room, everybody out there.
1029.26	We can all make a decision
1031.26	to come together
1033.26	and pick up the balls and run with the balls
1036.26	that governments have dropped.
1038.26	If we don't do it,
1040.26	we're abandoning hope,
1042.26	we're abandoning our essential humanity,
1045.26	and I know that's not a place we want to be,
1047.26	and we don't have to be there.
1049.26	So I appeal to you.
1051.26	Join us, come into that safe space,
1053.26	and let's start to make this happen.
1055.26	Thank you very much.
1057.26	(Applause)
