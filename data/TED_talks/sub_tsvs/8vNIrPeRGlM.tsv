13.089	Oliver was an extremely dashing,
17.153	handsome, charming and largely unstable male
21.974	that I completely lost my heart to.
25.159	(Laughter)
28.08	He was a Bernese mountain dog,
29.746	and my ex-husband and I adopted him,
32.929	and about six months in,
34.618	we realized that he was a mess.
37.182	He had such paralyzing separation anxiety
39.962	that we couldn't leave him alone.
41.498	Once, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.
44.626	He ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.
49.047	He hunted flies that didn't exist.
50.952	He suffered from hallucinations.
52.681	He was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder
55.985	and that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
59.331	But like with humans,
63.432	sometimes it's six months in
66.543	before you realize that
68.58	the person that you love has some issues.
71.527	(Laughter)
72.938	And most of us do not take the person we're dating
76.872	back to the bar where we met them
79.008	or give them back to the friend that introduced us,
83.344	or sign them back up on Match.com.
86.098	(Laughter)
88.928	We love them anyway,
90.727	and we stick to it,
92.723	and that is what I did with my dog.
96.955	And I was a — I'd studied biology.
100.757	I have a Ph.D. in history of science
103.377	from MIT,
104.882	and had you asked me 10 years ago
106.58	if a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,
108.989	had emotions, I would have said yes,
110.825	but I'm not sure that I would have told you
112.289	that they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,
114.587	a Prozac prescription and a therapist.
118.678	But then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,
122.624	and actually trying to help my own dog
125.25	overcome his panic and his anxiety,
127.864	it just changed my life.
130.227	It cracked open my world.
132.764	And I spent the last seven years, actually,
135.131	looking into this topic of
135.131	mental illness in other animals.
137.73	Can they be mentally ill like people,
139.075	and if so, what does it mean about us?
142.08	And what I discovered is that I do believe
144.879	they can suffer from mental illness,
146.819	and actually looking and trying
146.819	to identify mental illness in them
151.295	often helps us be better friends to them
153.377	and also can help us better understand ourselves.
157.431	So let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.
160.877	Many of us think that we can't know
163.558	what another animal is thinking,
166.021	and that is true,
167.299	but any of you in relationships —
169.891	at least this is my case —
171.747	just because you ask someone that you're with
173.547	or your parent or your child how they feel
175.741	doesn't mean that they can tell you.
177.551	They may not have words to explain
179.869	what it is that they're feeling,
180.932	and they may not know.
182.775	It's actually a pretty recent phenomenon
184.64	that we feel that we have to talk to someone
186.386	to understand their emotional distress.
188.79	Before the early 20th century,
191.217	physicians often diagnosed emotional distress
193.737	in their patients just by observation.
197.235	It also turns out that thinking about
198.918	mental illness in other animals
200.513	isn't actually that much of a stretch.
202.706	Most mental disorders in the United States
204.619	are fear and anxiety disorders,
207.339	and when you think about it, fear and anxiety
209.308	are actually really extremely
209.308	helpful animal emotions.
213.5	Usually we feel fear and anxiety
213.5	in situations that are dangerous,
216.6	and once we feel them,
217.897	we then are motivated to move away
219.526	from whatever is dangerous.
221.357	The problem is when we begin to feel fear
221.357	and anxiety in situations that don't call for it.
226.326	Mood disorders, too, may actually just be
229.536	the unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,
233.042	and obsessive compulsive disorders also
236.207	are often manifestations of
236.207	a really healthy animal thing
239.616	which is keeping yourself clean and groomed.
242.396	This tips into the territory of mental illness
244.544	when you do things like
245.69	compulsively over-wash your hands or paws,
248.293	or you develop a ritual that's so extreme
250.359	that you can't sit down to a bowl of food
252.451	unless you engage in that ritual.
255.443	So for humans, we have the
255.443	"""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,"""
259.774	which is basically an atlas
261.901	of the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.
264.634	In other animals, we have YouTube.
267.885	(Laughter)
269.491	"This is just one search I did for ""OCD dog"""
272.138	but I encourage all of you
273.926	"to look at ""OCD cat."""
276.877	You will be shocked by what you see.
280.271	I'm going to show you just a couple examples.
284.77	This is an example of shadow-chasing.
287.492	I know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.
290.568	The issue, though, is that dogs
290.568	can develop compulsions like this
294.063	that they then engage in all day.
296.965	So they won't go for a walk,
298.237	they won't hang out with their friends,
299.891	they won't eat.
301.477	They'll develop fixations
303.01	like chasing their tails compulsively.
306.127	Here's an example of a cat named Gizmo.
309.528	He looks like he's on a stakeout
312.74	but he does this for many, many, many hours a day.
316.054	He just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw
319.558	at the screen.
321.092	This is another example of what's considered
323.569	a stereotypic behavior.
325.353	This is a sun bear at the
325.353	Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting.
328.06	And if you just sort of happened upon this scene,
329.825	you might think that Ting Ting
330.776	is just playing with a stick,
332.49	but Ting Ting does this all day,
334.536	and if you pay close attention
336.132	and if I showed you guys
336.132	the full half-hour of this clip,
339.803	you'd see that he does the exact same thing
341.829	in the exact same order, and he spins the stick
343.978	in the exact same way every time.
346.328	Other super common behaviors that you may see,
348.82	particularly in captive animals,
350.644	are pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,
355.204	and actually, humans do this too,
356.88	and in us, we'll sway,
358.624	we'll move from side to side.
360.211	Many of us do this, and sometimes
362.482	it's an effort to soothe ourselves,
364.028	and I think in other animals
364.028	that is often the case too.
366.678	But it's not just stereotypic behaviors
368.364	that other animals engage in.
370.13	This is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives
372.258	at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.
373.919	She actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,
376.127	and she's been treated for a mood disorder
377.849	among other things.
379.432	Many animals develop mood disorders.
382.427	Lots of creatures —
383.855	this horse is just one example —
385.39	develop self-destructive behaviors.
387.072	They'll gnaw on things
388.357	or do other things that may also soothe them,
390.503	even if they're self-destructive,
392.201	which could be considered similar
393.508	to the ways that some humans cut themselves.
397.249	Plucking.
398.562	Turns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,
402.319	you can pluck yourself compulsively,
404.294	and some parrots actually have been studied
406.616	to better understand trichotillomania,
406.616	or compulsive plucking in humans,
409.714	something that affects
413.441	Lab rats pluck themselves too.
415.509	In them, it's called barbering.
417.742	Canine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan
420.819	are coming back with what's
420.819	considered canine PTSD,
423.8	and they're having a hard time reentering civilian life
426.512	when they come back from deployments.
427.797	They can be too scared to
427.797	approach men with beards
430.403	or to hop into cars.
433.116	I want to be careful and be clear, though.
435.882	I do not think that canine PTSD
438.559	is the same as human PTSD.
441.36	But I also do not think that my PTSD
443.835	is like your PTSD,
444.93	or that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.
448.632	We are all different.
450.337	We also all have very different susceptibilities.
453.172	So two dogs, raised in the same household,
456.913	exposed to the very same things,
459.26	one may develop, say, a
459.26	debilitating fear of motorcycles,
463.159	or a phobia of the beep of the microwave,
465.907	and another one is going to be just fine.
467.762	So one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:
470.595	Is this just an instance of humans
472.538	driving other animals crazy?
474.167	Or, is animal mental illness just
474.167	a result of mistreatment or abuse?
478.09	And it turns out we're actually
479.619	so much more complicated than that.
483.174	So one great thing that has happened to me
486.161	is recently I published a book on this,
489.41	and every day now that I open my email
493.355	or when I go to a reading
494.809	or even when I go to a cocktail party,
496.921	people tell me their stories
498.822	of the animals that they have met.
500.576	And recently, I did a reading in California,
503.02	and a woman raised her hand
503.02	after the talk and she said,
505.45	"""Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."""
509.126	"And I said, ""Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."""
512.49	So, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,
515.909	and she used to live with an elderly man,
518.631	and one day the man was vacuuming
520.902	and he suffered a heart attack, and he died.
523.727	A week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment
526.661	alongside the body of her owner,
528.655	and the vacuum had been running the entire time.
532.042	For many months, up to I think
532.042	two years after that incident,
537.35	she was so scared she couldn't be in
537.35	the house when anyone was cleaning.
539.96	She was quite literally a scaredy cat.
541.75	She would hide in the closet.
544.19	She was un-self-confident and shaky,
545.992	but with the loving support of her family,
548.33	a lot of a time, and their patience,
550.726	now, three years later,
551.98	she's actually a happy, confident cat.
555.225	Another story of trauma and
555.225	recovery that I came across
558.18	was actually a few years ago.
559.676	I was in Thailand to do some research.
561.916	I met a monkey named Boonlua,
565.01	and when Boonlua was a baby,
567.282	he was attacked by a pack of dogs,
569.296	and they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,
574.14	and Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,
577.283	where the monks took him in.
578.834	They called in a veterinarian,
578.834	who treated his wounds.
581.445	Eventually, Boonlua wound up
583.66	at an elephant facility,
585.453	and the keepers really decided
585.453	to take him under their wing,
588.422	and they figured out what he liked,
589.785	which, it turned out, was mint Mentos
591.804	and Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.
595.281	But they worried, because he
595.281	was social, that he was lonely,
598.453	and they didn't want to put
598.453	him in with another monkey,
600.22	because they thought with just one arm,
601.423	he wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.
604.218	And so they gave him a rabbit,
606.704	and Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.
609.517	He was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.
611.499	They groomed each other,
611.499	they become close friends,
613.779	and then the rabbit had bunnies,
616.482	and Boonlua was even happier than he was before,
619.339	and it had in a way given him
621.589	a reason to wake up in the morning,
623.434	and in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up
625.188	that he decided not to sleep.
627.191	He became extremely protective of these bunnies,
630.81	and he stopped sleeping,
632.058	and he would sort of nod off
633.499	while trying to take care of them.
635.39	In fact, he was so protective and so affectionate
637.833	with these babies that the sanctuary
639.588	eventually had to take them away from him
641.95	because he was so protective, he was worried
643.885	that their mother might hurt them.
645.764	So after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff
647.608	worried that he would fall into a depression,
649.217	and so to avoid that,
650.449	they gave him another rabbit friend.
653.447	(Laughter)
656.804	My official opinion is that
656.804	he does not look depressed.
659.509	(Laughter)
661.459	So one thing that I would really like people to feel
665.821	is that you really should feel empowered
668.9	to make some assumptions
671.373	about the creatures that you know well.
673.196	So when it comes to your dog
674.996	or your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey
677.314	that you happen to know,
678.742	if you think that they are traumatized or depressed,
682.537	you're probably right.
684.663	This is extremely anthropomorphic,
687.471	or the assignation of human characteristics
690.464	onto non-human animals or things.
694.116	I don't think, though, that that's a problem.
696.257	I don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.
698.349	It's not as if you can take your
698.349	human brain out of your head
701.251	and put it in a jar and then use it
703.355	to think about another animal thinking.
705.56	We will always be one animal wondering
708.158	about the emotional experience of another animal.
710.678	So then the choice becomes, how
710.678	do you anthropomorphize well?
713.671	Or do you anthropomorphize poorly?
715.931	And anthropomorphizing poorly
718.215	is all too common.
720.38	(Laughter)
722.012	It may include dressing your corgis
722.012	up and throwing them a wedding,
724.616	or getting too close to exotic wildlife because
727.272	you believe that you had a spiritual connection.
729.228	There's all manner of things.
731.206	Anthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based
735.112	on accepting our animal
735.112	similarities with other species
737.83	and using them to make assumptions
740.637	that are informed about other 
740.637	animals' minds and experiences,
744.276	and there's actually an entire industry
746.822	that is in some ways based
746.822	on anthropomorphizing well,
749.792	and that is the psychopharmaceutical industry.
752.953	One in five Americans is currently
752.953	taking a psychopharmaceutical drug,
757.473	from the antidepressants
757.473	and antianxiety medications
760.128	to the antipsychotics.
761.95	It turns out that we owe this
763.784	entire psychopharmaceutical arsenal
766.157	to other animals.
767.889	These drugs were tested in non-human animals first,
770.399	and not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.
774.335	The very popular antipsychotic Thorazine
777.519	first relaxed rats before it relaxed people.
781.265	The antianxiety medication Librium
783.426	was given to cats selected for
783.426	their meanness in the 1950s
787.249	and made them into peaceable felines.
789.64	And even antidepressants
789.64	were first tested in rabbits.
794.2	Today, however, we are not just giving these drugs
797.104	to other animals as test subjects,
799.455	but they're giving them these drugs as patients,
801.946	both in ethical and much less ethical ways.
806.429	SeaWorld gives mother orcas
806.429	antianxiety medications
810.299	when their calves are taken away.
812.943	Many zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics
815.226	and antianxiety medications.
817.292	But dogs like my own Oliver
820.165	are given antidepressants and
820.165	some antianxiety medications
823.404	to keep them from jumping out of buildings
825.14	or jumping into traffic.
827.203	"Just recently, actually, a study came out in ""Science"""
830.402	that showed that even crawdads
832.231	responded to antianxiety medication.
834.455	It made them braver, less skittish,
836.73	and more likely to explore their environment.
841.78	It's hard to know how many
841.78	animals are on these drugs,
844.138	but I can tell you that the
844.138	animal pharmaceutical industry
847.602	is immense and growing,
849.39	from seven billion dollars in 2011
852.113	to a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015.
857.692	Some animals are on these drugs indefinitely.
861.539	Others, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee
865.774	at the zoo there was on them
867.36	until he started to save his Paxil prescription
869.511	and then distribute it among the other bonobos.
871.907	(Laughter) (Applause)
876.916	More than psychopharmaceuticals, though,
879.805	there are many, many, many other
882.32	therapeutic interventions that help other creatures.
884.968	And here is a place where I think actually
887.33	that veterinary medicine can teach something
889.772	to human medicine,
891.458	which is, if you take your dog, who is, say,
893.348	compulsively chasing his tail,
895.148	into the veterinary behaviorist,
896.926	their first action isn't to reach
896.926	for the prescription pad;
899.73	it's to ask you about your dog's life.
902.686	They want to know how often your dog gets outside.
905.622	They want to know how much
905.622	exercise your dog is getting.
908.276	They want to know how much social time
909.761	with other dogs and other humans.
912.18	They want to talk to you
912.18	about what sorts of therapies,
914.39	largely behavior therapies,
916.905	you've tried with that animal.
919.165	Those are the things that
919.165	often tend to help the most,
921.562	especially when combined with
921.562	psychopharmaceuticals.
924.891	The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,
927.344	particularly with social animals,
929.301	is time with other social animals.
932.439	In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal
936.347	to my own dog,
938.851	and I have seen parrots do it for people
942.878	and people do it for parrots
944.588	and dogs do it for elephants
946.126	and elephants do it for other elephants.
949.304	I don't know about you;
950.637	I get a lot of Internet forwards
953.217	of unlikely animal friendships.
955.433	I also think it's a huge part of Facebook,
958.72	the monkey that adopts the cat
961.597	or the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,
966.233	or the cow that makes friends with the pig,
969.237	and had you asked me eight,
969.237	nine years ago, about these,
973.173	I would have told you that they
973.173	were hopelessly sentimental
975.663	and maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way
978.786	and maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now
981.565	is that there is actually something to this.
984.517	This is legit. In fact, some interesting studies
988.112	have pointed to oxytocin levels,
990.038	which are a kind of bonding hormone
992.634	that we release when we're having sex or nursing
995.04	or around someone that we care for extremely,
997.629	oxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs
1000.121	who care about each other
1001.515	or who enjoy each other's company,
1003.175	and beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin
1005.484	raised even in other pairs of animals,
1007.62	so, say, in goats and dogs who were
1007.62	friends and played with each other,
1011.225	their levels spiked afterwards.
1015.684	I have a friend who really showed me that
1018.451	mental health is in fact a two-way street.
1020.875	His name is Lonnie Hodge,
1020.875	and he's a veteran of Vietnam.
1024.874	When he returned, he started working
1027.496	with survivors of genocide and a lot of people
1030.139	who had gone through war trauma.
1031.667	And he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,
1034.151	because in Vietnam, he had been
1036.05	rappelling backwards out of helicopters
1038.295	over the skids,
1039.73	and he was givena service dog
1039.73	named Gander, a labradoodle,
1042.799	to help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.
1046.25	This is them actually on the first day that they met,
1048.91	which is amazing, and since then,
1051.502	they've spent a lot of time together
1053.267	visiting with other veterans
1053.267	suffering from similar issues.
1057.517	But what's so interesting to me about
1057.517	Lonnie and Gander's relationship
1060.579	is about a few months in,
1062.357	Gander actually developed a fear of heights,
1065.684	probably because he was
1065.684	watching Lonnie so closely.
1069.981	What's pretty great about this, though,
1069.981	is that he's still a fantastic service dog,
1073.45	because now, when they're both at a great height,
1075.985	Lonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being
1079.343	that he forgets to be scared of the heights himself.
1085.317	Since I've spent so much time with these stories,
1088.598	digging into archives,
1090.002	I literally spent years doing this research,
1092.456	and it's changed me.
1094.756	I no longer look at animals at the species level.
1098.692	I look at them as individuals,
1100.92	and I think about them as creatures
1102.492	with their own individual weather systems
1105.251	guiding their behavior and informing
1106.963	how they respond to the world.
1109.272	And I really believe that this has made me
1112.16	a more curious and a more empathetic person,
1114.524	both to the animals that share my bed
1117.967	and occasionally wind up on my plate,
1120.093	but also to the people that I know
1122.943	who are suffering from anxiety
1125.894	and from phobias and all manner of other things,
1128.521	and I really do believe that
1130.496	even though you can't know exactly
1132.744	what's going on in the mind of a pig
1136.131	or your pug or your partner,
1138.248	that that shouldn't stop you
1138.248	from empathizing with them.
1142.055	The best thing that we could do for our loved ones
1144.544	is, perhaps, to anthropomorphize them.
1148.84	Charles Darwin's father once told him
1152.341	that everybody could lose their mind at some point.
1157.56	Thankfully, we can often find them again,
1160.391	but only with each other's help.
1162.562	Thank you.
1164.618	(Applause)
