12.96	I published this article
14.44	in the New York Times Modern Love column
14.44	in January of this year.
18.84	"""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."""
21.2	And the article
21.2	is about a psychological study
23.52	designed to create romantic love
23.52	in the laboratory,
26.96	and my own experience
26.96	trying the study myself
29.72	one night last summer.
31.6	So the procedure is fairly simple:
34.36	two strangers take turns asking each other
41.24	and then they stare into each other's eyes
44.159	without speaking for four minutes.
47.36	So here are a couple of sample questions.
50.76	Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow
50.76	having gained any one quality or ability,
56.04	what would it be?
58.24	Number 28: When did you last cry
58.24	in front of another person?
62.96	By yourself?
64.2	As you can see, they really do
64.2	get more personal as they go along.
68.48	Number 30, I really like this one:
70.88	Tell your partner
70.88	what you like about them;
73.76	be very honest this time,
75.64	saying things you might not say
75.64	to someone you just met.
80.84	So when I first came across this study
80.84	a few years earlier,
85.4	one detail really stuck out to me,
87.52	and that was the rumor
87.52	that two of the participants
90.6	had gotten married six months later,
93.12	and they'd invited the entire lab
93.12	to the ceremony.
97.32	So I was of course very skeptical
100.2	about this process of just
100.2	manufacturing romantic love,
103.88	but of course I was intrigued.
106.76	And when I got the chance
106.76	to try this study myself,
110.2	with someone I knew
110.2	but not particularly well,
113.36	I wasn't expecting to fall in love.
116.52	But then we did, and --
119.24	(Laughter)
121.16	And I thought it made a good story,
121.16	so I sent it to the Modern Love column
125.56	a few months later.
127.4	Now, this was published in January,
131.88	and now it is August,
133.6	so I'm guessing that some of you
133.6	are probably wondering,
137.24	are we still together?
139.64	And the reason I think
139.64	you might be wondering this
142.039	is because I have been asked this question
144.72	again and again and again
144.72	for the past seven months.
148.68	And this question is really
148.68	what I want to talk about today.
152.4	But let's come back to it.
153.88	(Laughter)
156.88	So the week before the article came out,
158.88	I was very nervous.
161.6	I had been working
161.6	on a book about love stories
164.2	for the past few years,
166.04	so I had gotten used to writing
166.04	about my own experiences
168.88	with romantic love on my blog.
171.92	But a blog post might get
171.92	a couple hundred views at the most,
176.52	and those were usually
176.52	just my Facebook friends,
179.64	and I figured my article
179.64	in the New York Times
182.24	would probably get a few thousand views.
186.08	And that felt like a lot of attention
188.88	on a relatively new relationship.
192.08	But as it turned out, I had no idea.
196.24	So the article was published online
198.16	on a Friday evening,
200.24	and by Saturday, this had happened
200.24	to the traffic on my blog.
206.4	And by Sunday, both the Today Show
206.4	and Good Morning America had called.
212.72	Within a month, the article
212.72	would receive over 8 million views,
217.28	and I was, to say the least,
219.6	underprepared for this sort of attention.
223.52	It's one thing to work up
223.52	the confidence to write honestly
226.52	about your experiences with love,
228.64	but it is another thing to discover
231.12	that your love life
231.12	has made international news --
234.12	(Laughter)
235.36	and to realize
235.36	that people across the world
239.2	are genuinely invested
239.2	in the status of your new relationship.
244.2	(Laughter)
246.4	And when people called or emailed,
246.4	which they did every day for weeks,
251.24	they always asked the same question first:
254.6	are you guys still together?
257.28	In fact, as I was preparing this talk,
259.64	I did a quick search of my email inbox
261.92	"for the phrase ""Are you still together?"""
263.88	and several messages
263.88	popped up immediately.
266.6	They were from students and journalists
269.279	and friendly strangers like this one.
272.32	I did radio interviews and they asked.
274.8	I even gave a talk, and one woman
274.8	shouted up to the stage,
278.76	"""Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"""
282.12	And I promptly turned bright red.
285.44	I understand that this
285.44	is part of the deal.
288.28	If you write about your relationship
288.28	in an international newspaper,
291.84	you should expect people
291.84	to feel comfortable asking about it.
295.52	But I just wasn't prepared
295.52	for the scope of the response.
300.48	The 36 questions seem
300.48	to have taken on a life of their own.
304.36	In fact, the New York Times
304.36	published a follow-up article
307.8	for Valentine's Day,
309.04	which featured readers' experiences
309.04	of trying the study themselves,
313.56	with varying degrees of success.
316.96	So my first impulse
316.96	in the face of all of this attention
321.2	was to become very protective
321.2	of my own relationship.
325.92	I said no to every request
325.92	for the two of us
328.96	to do a media appearance together.
331.32	I turned down TV interviews,
333.04	and I said no to every request
333.04	for photos of the two us.
337.2	I think I was afraid that we would become
339.8	inadvertent icons
339.8	for the process of falling in love,
343.96	a position I did not at all
343.96	feel qualified for.
348.76	And I get it:
351.24	people didn't just want to know
351.24	if the study worked,
354.04	they wanted to know if it really worked:
357	that is, if it was capable
357	of producing love that would last,
361.72	not just a fling, but real love,
361.72	sustainable love.
367.12	But this was a question
367.12	I didn't feel capable of answering.
371.24	My own relationship
371.24	was only a few months old,
373.96	and I felt like people were asking
373.96	the wrong question in the first place.
380.04	What would knowing whether or not
380.04	we were still together really tell them?
384.2	If the answer was no,
385.88	would it make the experience
385.88	of doing these 36 questions
389.88	any less worthwhile?
392.8	Dr. Arthur Aron first wrote
392.8	about these questions
395.6	in this study here in 1997,
400	and here, the researcher's goal
400	was not to produce romantic love.
404.76	Instead, they wanted to foster
406.72	interpersonal closeness
406.72	among college students,
410.2	by using what Aron called
412.96	"""sustained, escalating, reciprocal,"
412.96	"personalistic self-disclosure."""
417.88	Sounds romantic, doesn't it?
421.6	But the study did work.
423.28	The participants
423.28	did feel closer after doing it,
426.36	and several subsequent studies have also
426.36	used Aron's fast friends protocol
431.68	as a way to quickly create
431.68	trust and intimacy between strangers.
435.84	They've used it between members
435.84	of the police and members of community,
439.293	and they've used it between people
439.293	of opposing political ideologies.
443.8	The original version of the story,
445.6	the one that I tried last summer,
448.12	that pairs the personal questions
448.12	with four minutes of eye contact,
452.36	was referenced in this article,
454.48	but unfortunately it was never published.
458.64	So a few months ago, I was giving a talk
461.68	at a small liberal arts college,
464	and a student came up to me afterwards
466.72	and he said, kind of shyly,
469.36	"""So, I tried your study,"
469.36	"and it didn't work."""
474.4	He seemed a little mystified by this.
477.68	"""You mean, you didn't fall in love"
477.68	"with the person you did it with?"" I asked."
482.48	"""Well..."" He paused."
484.92	"""I think she just wants to be friends."""
489.48	"""But did you become"
489.48	"better friends?"" I asked."
493.24	"""Did you feel like you got to really"
493.24	"know each other after doing the study?"""
496.92	He nodded.
498.24	"""So, then it worked,"" I said."
501.2	I don't think this is the answer
501.2	he was looking for.
505.44	In fact, I don't think this is the answer
505.44	that any of us are looking for
509.8	when it comes to love.
512.08	I first came across this study
513.84	when I was 29
515.32	and I was going through
515.32	a really difficult breakup.
518.76	I had been in the relationship
518.76	since I was 20,
521.4	which was basically my entire adult life,
524.2	and he was my first real love,
526.32	and I had no idea how or if
526.32	I could make a life without him.
531.44	So I turned to science.
533.84	I researched everything I could find
533.84	about the science of romantic love,
538.44	and I think I was hoping that it might
538.44	somehow inoculate me from heartache.
543.56	I don't know if I realized
543.56	this at the time --
547.12	I thought I was just doing research
547.12	for this book I was writing --
550.44	but it seems really obvious in retrospect.
553.88	I hoped that if I armed myself
553.88	with the knowledge of romantic love,
558.32	I might never have to feel
558.32	as terrible and lonely as I did then.
564.32	And all this knowledge
564.32	has been useful in some ways.
568.64	I am more patient with love.
568.64	I am more relaxed.
571.96	I am more confident
571.96	about asking for what I want.
575.56	But I can also see myself more clearly,
579.32	and I can see that what I want
579.32	is sometimes more
583.6	than can reasonably be asked for.
586.68	What I want from love is a guarantee,
590.16	not just that I am loved today
592.4	and that I will be loved tomorrow,
594.84	but that I will continue to be loved
594.84	by the person I love indefinitely.
601.24	Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee
604.76	that people were really asking about
606.76	when they wanted to know
606.76	if we were still together.
610.8	So the story that the media told
610.8	about the 36 questions
614.76	was that there might be
614.76	a shortcut to falling in love.
618.08	There might be a way to somehow
618.08	mitigate some of the risk involved,
621.84	and this is a very appealing story,
624.48	because falling in love feels amazing,
627.68	but it's also terrifying.
630.44	The moment you admit to loving someone,
633.04	you admit to having a lot to lose,
636.64	and it's true that these questions
636.64	do provide a mechanism
640.88	for getting to know someone quickly,
643.2	which is also a mechanism for being known,
645.76	and I think this is the thing
645.76	that most of us really want from love:
650.24	to be known, to be seen, to be understood.
655.2	But I think when it comes to love,
657.16	we are too willing to accept
657.16	the short version of the story.
661.68	The version of the story that asks,
661.68	"""Are you still together?"""
665.28	and is content with a yes or no answer.
669.56	So rather than that question,
671.52	I would propose we ask
671.52	some more difficult questions,
675.2	questions like:
677.08	How do you decide who deserves your love
680.12	and who does not?
682.84	How do you stay in love
682.84	when things get difficult,
686.12	and how do you know
686.12	when to just cut and run?
689.88	How do you live with the doubt
691.8	that inevitably creeps
691.8	into every relationship,
694.84	or even harder,
696.48	how do you live with your partner's doubt?
699.8	I don't necessarily know
699.8	the answers to these questions,
703.44	but I think they're an important start
703.44	at having a more thoughtful conversation
708.6	about what it means to love someone.
712.08	So, if you want it,
714.44	the short version of the story
714.44	of my relationship is this:
718.76	a year ago, an acquaintance
718.76	and I did a study
721.88	designed to create romantic love,
724.6	and we fell in love,
726.32	and we are still together,
728.2	and I am so glad.
731.04	But falling in love is not
731.04	the same thing as staying in love.
736.44	Falling in love is the easy part.
740.36	So at the end of my article, I wrote,
740.36	"""Love didn't happen to us."
744.76	We're in love because we each
744.76	"made the choice to be."""
748.08	And I cringe a little
748.08	when I read that now,
752.28	not because it isn't true,
754.6	but because at the time,
754.6	I really hadn't considered
757.84	everything that was contained
757.84	in that choice.
761.48	I didn't consider how many times
761.48	we would each have to make that choice,
766.72	and how many times I will continue
766.72	to have to make that choice
770.32	without knowing whether or not
770.32	he will always choose me.
774.16	I want it to be enough to have asked
774.16	and answered 36 questions,
779.68	and to have chosen to love someone
779.68	so generous and kind and fun
784.92	and to have broadcast that choice
784.92	in the biggest newspaper in America.
790.88	But what I have done instead
790.88	is turn my relationship
794	into the kind of myth
794	I don't quite believe in.
798.2	And what I want, what perhaps
798.2	I will spend my life wanting,
802.48	is for that myth to be true.
805.2	I want the happy ending
805.2	implied by the title to my article,
810	which is, incidentally,
811.52	the only part of the article
811.52	that I didn't actually write.
815.2	(Laughter)
818.52	But what I have instead is the chance
818.52	to make the choice to love someone,
823.24	and the hope that he will choose
823.24	to love me back,
826.72	and it is terrifying,
829.44	but that's the deal with love.
831.2	Thank you.
