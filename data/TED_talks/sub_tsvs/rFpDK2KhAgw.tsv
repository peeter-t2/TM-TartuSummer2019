12.959	There are things we say
14.261	when we catch the eye of a stranger
16.681	or a neighbor walking by.
19.53	"We say, ""Hello, how are you?"
22.08	It's a beautiful day.
23.812	"How do you feel?"""
25.552	These sound kind of meaningless, right?
25.552	And, in some ways, they are.
29.21	They have no semantic meaning.
32.5	It doesn't matter how you are
32.5	or what the day is like.
35.934	They have something else.
37.425	They have social meaning.
40.051	What we mean when we say those things is:
42.554	I see you there.
45.764	I'm obsessed with talking to strangers.
49.122	I make eye contact, say hello,
51.499	I offer help, I listen.
54.699	I get all kinds of stories.
57.773	About seven years ago, I started
57.773	documenting my experiences
61.064	to try to figure out why.
63.9	What I found was that something
63.9	really beautiful was going on.
67.963	This is almost poetic.
70.184	These were really profound experiences.
73.478	They were unexpected pleasures.
75.382	They were genuine emotional connections.
78.37	They were liberating moments.
82.098	So one day, I was standing on a corner
82.098	waiting for the light to change,
86.226	which, I'm a New Yorker,
87.559	so that means I was actually standing
87.559	in the street on the storm drain,
91.667	as if that could get me across faster.
94.038	And there's an old man
94.038	standing next to me.
96.063	So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat
96.063	and sort of an old-man hat,
100.914	and he looked like somebody from a movie.
103.064	And he says to me,
104.286	"""Don't stand there. You might disappear."""
108.095	So this is absurd, right?
109.386	But I did what he said.
109.386	I stepped back onto the sidewalk.
112.697	And he smiled, and he said,
114.613	"""Good. You never know."
116.518	I might have turned around,
117.969	"and zoop, you're gone."""
121.553	This was weird,
123.638	and also really wonderful.
126.091	He was so warm, and he was
126.091	so happy that he'd saved me.
129.977	We had this little bond.
131.987	For a minute, I felt like
131.987	my existence as a person
136.174	had been noticed,
138.335	and I was worth saving.
143.058	The really sad thing is,
144.709	in many parts of the world,
146.406	we're raised to believe
146.406	that strangers are dangerous by default,
150.36	that we can't trust them,
150.36	that they might hurt us.
154.389	But most strangers aren't dangerous.
156.991	We're uneasy around them
156.991	because we have no context.
160.807	We don't know what their intentions are.
163.028	So instead of using our perceptions
163.028	and making choices,
166.835	"we rely on this category of ""stranger."""
171.012	I have a four-year-old.
172.862	When I say hello to people on the street,
174.861	she asks me why.
176.82	"She says, ""Do we know them?"""
180.324	"I say, ""No, they're our neighbor."""
182.895	"""Are they our friend?"""
184.941	"""No, it's just good to be friendly."""
187.773	I think twice every time
187.773	I say that to her,
191.126	because I mean it,
191.126	but as a woman, particularly,
194.658	I know that not every stranger
194.658	on the street has the best intentions.
198.873	It is good to be friendly,
198.873	and it's good to learn when not to be,
202.751	but none of that means
202.751	we have to be afraid.
206.451	There are two huge benefits
209.348	to using our senses instead of our fears.
213.015	The first one is that it liberates us.
217.97	When you think about it,
219.867	using perception instead of categories
222.103	is much easier said than done.
224.859	Categories are something our brains use.
227.693	When it comes to people,
229.354	it's sort of a shortcut
229.354	for learning about them.
232.9	We see male, female, young, old,
236.562	black, brown, white, stranger, friend,
240.948	and we use the information in that box.
244.112	It's quick, it's easy
245.854	and it's a road to bias.
248.052	And it means we're not thinking
248.052	about people as individuals.
253.774	I know an American researcher
253.774	who travels frequently
257.135	in Central Asia and Africa, alone.
260.91	She's entering into towns and cities
263.473	as a complete stranger.
265.937	She has no bonds, no connections.
268.126	She's a foreigner.
269.957	Her survival strategy is this:
272.357	get one stranger to see you
272.357	as a real, individual person.
276.839	If you can do that, it'll help
276.839	other people see you that way, too.
280.817	The second benefit of using our senses
280.817	has to do with intimacy.
286.003	I know it sounds
286.003	a little counterintuitive,
288.422	intimacy and strangers,
290.543	but these quick interactions
290.543	can lead to a feeling
294.619	that sociologists call
294.619	"""fleeting intimacy."""
297.785	So, it's a brief experience
297.785	that has emotional resonance and meaning.
303.452	It's the good feeling I got
305.484	from being saved from the death trap
305.484	of the storm drain by the old man,
310.61	or how I feel like part of a community
313.134	when I talk to somebody
313.134	on my train on the way to work.
317.665	Sometimes it goes further.
319.713	Researchers have found
319.713	that people often feel more comfortable
324.85	being honest and open
324.85	about their inner selves with strangers
328.118	than they do with their friends
328.118	and their families --
332.11	that they often feel
332.11	more understood by strangers.
337.022	This gets reported in the media
337.022	with great lament.
341.125	"""Strangers communicate"
341.125	"better than spouses!"""
344.901	It's a good headline, right?
347.547	I think it entirely misses the point.
351.24	The important thing about these studies
353.177	is just how significant
353.177	these interactions can be;
356.795	how this special form of closeness
359.923	gives us something we need
359.923	as much as we need our friends
362.725	and our families.
364.933	So how is it possible that we communicate
364.933	so well with strangers?
370.585	There are two reasons.
372.245	The first one is that
372.245	it's a quick interaction.
375.183	It has no consequences.
377.034	It's easy to be honest with someone
377.034	you're never going to see again, right?
380.643	That makes sense.
382.177	The second reason is where
382.177	it gets more interesting.
385.085	We have a bias when it comes
385.085	to people we're close to.
389.359	We expect them to understand us.
392.55	We assume they do,
393.803	and we expect them to read our minds.
396.717	So imagine you're at a party,
399.045	and you can't believe
399.045	that your friend or your spouse
402.671	isn't picking up on it
402.671	that you want to leave early.
405.498	And you're thinking,
406.896	"""I gave you the look."""
410.696	With a stranger, we have
410.696	to start from scratch.
413.235	We tell the whole story,
415.376	we explain who the people are,
415.376	how we feel about them;
418.488	we spell out all the inside jokes.
420.68	And guess what?
422.18	Sometimes they do
422.18	understand us a little better.
426.087	OK.
427.271	So now that we know
427.271	that talking to strangers matters,
430.791	how does it work?
432.721	There are unwritten rules
432.721	we tend to follow.
435.495	The rules are very different
435.495	depending on what country you're in,
439.315	what culture you're in.
441.032	In most parts of the US,
443.185	the baseline expectation in public
445.464	is that we maintain a balance
445.464	between civility and privacy.
450.18	This is known as civil inattention.
453.263	So, imagine two people are walking
453.263	towards each other on the street.
457.047	They'll glance at each other
457.047	from a distance.
459.369	That's the civility, the acknowledgment.
461.375	And then as they get closer,
461.375	they'll look away,
463.606	to give each other some space.
467.151	In other cultures,
468.437	people go to extraordinary lengths
468.437	not to interact at all.
474.533	People from Denmark tell me
476.791	that many Danes are so averse
476.791	to talking to strangers,
480.423	that they would rather
480.423	miss their stop on the bus
483.665	"than say ""excuse me"" to someone"
483.665	that they need to get around.
487.04	Instead, there's this elaborate
487.04	shuffling of bags
490.353	and using your body to say
490.353	that you need to get past,
493.86	instead of using two words.
498.178	In Egypt, I'm told,
500.731	it's rude to ignore a stranger,
503.047	and there's a remarkable
503.047	culture of hospitality.
507.312	Strangers might ask each other
507.312	for a sip of water.
510.392	Or, if you ask someone for directions,
513.12	they're very likely
513.12	to invite you home for coffee.
517.441	We see these unwritten rules
517.441	most clearly when they're broken,
521.563	or when you're in a new place
523.67	and you're trying to figure out
523.67	what the right thing to do is.
527.332	Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit
527.332	is where the action is.
534.551	In case it's not clear,
534.551	I really want you to do this. OK?
539.79	So here's how it's going to go.
541.703	Find somebody who is making eye contact.
543.753	That's a good signal.
545.466	The first thing is a simple smile.
548.402	If you're passing somebody on the street
548.402	or in the hallway here, smile.
552.342	See what happens.
554.113	Another is triangulation.
556.552	There's you, there's a stranger,
558.255	there's some third thing
558.255	that you both might see and comment on,
563.134	like a piece of public art
565.145	or somebody preaching in the street
567.659	or somebody wearing funny clothes.
570.689	Give it a try.
571.864	Make a comment about that third thing,
571.864	and see if starts a conversation.
576.621	Another is what I call noticing.
578.369	This is usually giving a compliment.
581.003	I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.
584.283	I'm actually not wearing
584.283	fabulous shoes right now,
587.063	but shoes are fabulous in general.
589.817	And they're pretty neutral
589.817	as far as giving compliments goes.
593.967	People always want to tell you things
593.967	about their awesome shoes.
597.599	You may have already experienced
597.599	the dogs and babies principle.
601.52	It can be awkward
601.52	to talk to someone on the street;
603.962	you don't know how
603.962	they're going to respond.
606.057	But you can always talk
606.057	to their dog or their baby.
608.623	The dog or the baby
609.996	is a social conduit to the person,
613.095	and you can tell by how they respond
615.156	whether they're open to talking more.
618.156	The last one I want to challenge you to
620.345	is disclosure.
622.548	This is a very vulnerable thing to do,
624.914	and it can be very rewarding.
627.068	So next time you're talking to a stranger
629.726	and you feel comfortable,
631.966	tell them something true about yourself,
634.34	something really personal.
636.103	You might have that experience
636.103	I talked about of feeling understood.
641.854	Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,
643.824	"people ask me, ""What does your dad do?"""
643.824	"or, ""Where does he live?"""
647.205	And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,
649.451	which is that he died when I was a kid.
653.386	Always in those moments,
655.427	they share their own experiences of loss.
658.407	We tend to meet
658.407	disclosure with disclosure,
661.567	even with strangers.
664.453	So, here it is.
667.425	When you talk to strangers,
667.425	you're making beautiful interruptions
671.303	into the expected narrative
671.303	of your daily life
674.813	and theirs.
676.79	You're making unexpected connections.
679.42	If you don't talk to strangers,
679.42	you're missing out on all of that.
685.544	We spend a lot of time
687.846	teaching our children about strangers.
690.764	What would happen if we spent
690.764	more time teaching ourselves?
695.441	We could reject all the ideas
695.441	that make us so suspicious of each other.
700.649	We could make a space for change.
704.141	Thank you.
705.316	(Applause)
