14.963	It's said that to be a poet
18.948	you have to go to hell and back.
24.173	The first time I visited the prison,
27.349	I was not surprised by the noise
27.349	of the padlocks,
32.025	or the closing doors,
32.025	or the cell bars,
36.243	or by any of the things
36.243	I had imagined.
40.246	Maybe because the prison
40.246	is in a quite open space.
45.559	You can see the sky.
47.689	Seagulls fly overhead,
47.689	and you feel like you're next to the sea,
51.332	that you're really close to the beach.
54.375	But in fact, the gulls are looking
54.375	for food in the dump near the prison.
61.25	I went farther inside and I suddenly saw
61.25	inmates moving across the corridors.
67.886	Then it was as if I stepped back
67.886	and thought
71.966	that I could have very well been
71.966	one of them.
75.775	If I had another story,
75.775	another context, different luck.
82.457	Because nobody - nobody -
82.457	can choose where they're born.
89.79	In 2009, I was invited to join a project
94.453	that San Martín National University
94.453	conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,
99.865	to coordinate a writing workshop.
103.08	The prison service ceded some land
103.08	at the end of the prison,
109.525	which is where they constructed
109.525	the University Center building.
116.152	The first time I met with the prisoners,
118.57	I asked them why they were asking
118.57	for a writing workshop
122.245	and they told me they wanted 
122.245	to put on paper
125.896	all that they couldn't say and do.
131.062	Right then I decided that I wanted poetry
131.062	to enter the prison.
137.434	So I said to them
137.434	why don't we work with poetry,
141.044	if they knew what poetry was.
143.375	But nobody had a clue
143.375	what poetry really was.
150.622	They also suggested to me
152.256	that the workshop should be
152.256	not just for the inmates
154.775	taking university classes, 
154.775	but for all the inmates.
160.641	And so I said
160.641	that to start this workshop,
163.808	I needed to find a tool
163.808	that we all had in common.
167.65	That tool was language.
170.756	We had language, we had the workshop.
170.756	We could have poetry.
176.948	But what I hadn't considered
176.948	was that inequality exists in prison, too.
182.774	Many of the prisoners hadn't even
182.774	completed grammar school.
187.895	Many couldn't use cursive,
187.895	could barely print.
195.41	They didn't write fluently, either.
199.082	So we started looking for short poems.
203.693	Very short, but very powerful.
206.759	And we started to read, and we'd read
206.759	one author, then another author,
210.507	and by reading such short poems,
210.507	they all began to realize
215.982	that what the poetic language did
215.982	was to break a certain logic,
220.639	and create another system.
222.394	Breaking the logic of language
222.394	also breaks the logic of the system
225.988	under which they've learned to respond.
230.55	So a new system appeared,
234.043	new rules that made them
234.043	understand very quickly,
239.202	- very quickly -
241.081	that with poetic language
243.23	they would be able to say
243.23	absolutely whatever they wanted.
251.479	It's said that to be a poet
251.479	you have to go to hell and back.
257.475	And they have plenty of hell.
257.475	Plenty of hell.
261.974	One of them once said:
261.974	"""In prison you never sleep."
266.589	You can never sleep in jail.
266.589	"You can never close your eyelids."""
272.351	And so, like I’m doing now,
272.351	I gave them a moment of silence,
278.707	then said,
278.707	“That's what poetry is, you guys.
284.309	It's in this prison universe
284.309	that you have all around you.
289.494	Everything you say
289.494	about how you never sleep,
291.774	it exudes fear.
293.464	All the things that go unwritten --
293.464	"all of that is poetry."""
299.469	So we started appropriating that hell;
303.676	we plunged ourselves, headfirst,
303.676	into the seventh circle.
307.184	And in that seventh circle of hell,
307.184	our very own, beloved circle,
311.222	they learned that they could
311.222	make the walls invisible,
315.434	that they could make the windows yell,
317.604	and that we could hide inside the shadows.
323.504	When the first year
323.504	of the workshop had ended,
327.464	we organized a little closing party,
329.872	like you do when a job is done
329.872	with so much love,
333.562	and you want to celebrate with a party.
336.512	We called family, friends, 
336.512	the university authorities.
340.979	The only thing the inmates
340.979	had to do was read a poem,
345.321	and receive their diplomas and applause.
347.558	That was our simple party.
352.105	The only thing I want to leave you with
358.694	is the moment in which those men,
363.019	some of them just huge
363.019	when standing next to me,
365.519	or the young boys - so young,
365.519	but with an enormous pride,
371.23	held their papers and trembled
371.23	like little kids and sweated,
377.078	and read their poems with their
377.078	voices completely broken.
384.042	That moment made me think a lot
388.959	that for most of them,
388.959	it was surely the very first time
393.066	that someone applauded them
393.066	for something they had done.
400.809	In prison there are things
400.809	that can't be done.
404.262	In prison, you can't dream.
404.262	In prison, you can't cry.
409.118	There are words that are virtually
409.118	"forbidden, like the word ""time,"""
414.147	"the word ""future,"" the word ""wish""."
419.016	But we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.
424.322	We decided
424.322	that they were going to write a book.
429.126	Not only did they write a book,
429.126	but they also bound it themselves.
433.546	That was at the end of 2010.
436.642	Then, we doubled the bet
436.642	and wrote another book.
441.051	And we bound that one, too.
442.685	That was a short time ago,
442.685	at the end of last year.
448.474	What I see week after week,
452	is how they're turning
452	into different people;
456.357	how they're being transformed.
458.904	How words are empowering them
458.904	with a dignity they had never known,
463.251	that they couldn't even imagine.
465.334	They had no idea such dignity
465.334	could come from them.
471.13	At the workshop, in that beloved hell
471.13	we share, we all give something.
478.397	We open our hands and hearts and give
478.397	what we have, what we can.
482.997	All of us;
482.997	all of us equally.
485.151	And so you feel that at least
485.151	in a small way
489.766	you're repairing
489.766	that huge social fracture
493.416	which makes it so that for many of them,
498.634	prison is their only destination.
504.172	I remember a verse
504.172	by a tremendous poet, a great poet,
510.586	from our Unit 48 workshop,
510.586	Nicolás Dorado:
520.395	"""I will need an infinite thread"
520.395	"to sew up this huge wound."""
527.485	Poetry does that; it sews up
527.485	the wounds of exclusion.
533.004	It opens doors. 
533.004	Poetry works as a mirror.
538.417	It creates a mirror, which is the poem.
541.762	They recognize themselves,
541.762	they look at themselves in the poem
545.745	and write from who they are,
545.745	and are from what they write.
550.808	In order to write,
553.513	they need to appropriate
553.513	the moment of writing
557.704	which is a moment
557.704	of extraordinary freedom.
561.155	They have to get into their heads,
561.155	search for that bit of freedom
564.098	that can never be taken away
564.098	when they write
569.124	and that is also useful
569.124	to realize that freedom is possible
572.635	even inside a prison,
574.973	and that the only bars we have
574.973	in our wonderful space
580.235	"is the word ""bars,"""
582.097	and that all of us in our hell
582.097	burn with happiness
585.959	when we light the wick of the word.
589.669	(Applause)
617.143	I told you a lot about the prison,
617.143	a lot about what I experience
623.597	every week, and how I enjoy it
623.597	and transform myself with the inmates.
628.178	But you don't know how much I'd like it
631.593	if you could feel, live, experience,
631.593	even for a few seconds,
637.159	what I enjoy every week
637.159	and what makes me who I am.
644.151	(Applause)
653.228	Martín Bustamante: 
653.228	The heart chews tears of time;
657.464	blinded by that light,
660.346	it hides the speed of existence
663.721	where the images go rowing by.
665.874	It fights; it hangs on.
668.847	The heart cracks under sad gazes,
672.554	rides on storms that spread fire,
676.327	lifts chests lowered by shame,
679.451	knows that it's not just reading
679.451	and going on,
682.627	it also wishes to see the infinite blue.
686.457	The heart sits down to think about things,
690.185	fights to avoid being ordinary,
692.897	tries to love without hurting,
696.32	breathes the sun,
696.32	giving courage to itself,
700.023	surrenders, travels toward reason.
704.391	The heart fights among the swamps,
707.294	skirts the edge of the underworld,
710.819	falls exhausted, but won't give in
710.819	to what's easy,
715.101	while irregular steps of intoxication
717.59	wake up,
719.167	wake the stillness.
721.057	I'm Martín Bustamante,
723.756	I'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,
727.254	today is my day of temporary release.
730.112	And for me, poetry and literature
730.112	have changed my life.
733.784	Thank you very much!
734.905	Cristina Domenech: Thank you!
736.325	(Applause)
