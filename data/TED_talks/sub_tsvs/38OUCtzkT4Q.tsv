12.74	So it all came to life
14.448	in a dark bar in Madrid.
16.843	I encountered my colleague
16.843	from McGill, Michael Meaney.
21.091	And we were drinking a few beers,
23.42	and like scientists do,
25.497	he told me about his work.
28.124	And he told me that he is interested
28.124	in how mother rats lick their pups
35.102	after they were born.
37.476	And I was sitting there and saying,
39.919	"""This is where my tax"
39.919	dollars are wasted --
42.943	(Laughter)
44.001	"on this kind of soft science."""
47.655	And he started telling me
50.176	that the rats, like humans,
53.6	lick their pups in very different ways.
56.07	Some mothers do a lot of that,
58.829	some mothers do very little,
61.058	and most are in between.
63.687	But what's interesting about it
65.612	is when he follows these pups
65.612	when they become adults --
70.554	like, years in human life,
70.554	long after their mother died.
74.757	They are completely different animals.
76.849	The animals that were licked
76.849	and groomed heavily,
81.246	the high-licking and grooming,
83.879	are not stressed.
85.842	They have different sexual behavior.
88.115	They have a different way of living
91.094	than those that were not treated
91.094	as intensively by their mothers.
97.754	So then I was thinking to myself:
100.942	Is this magic?
102.822	How does this work?
104.215	As geneticists would like you to think,
107.21	perhaps the mother had
107.21	"the ""bad mother"" gene"
111.206	that caused her pups to be stressful,
114.867	and then it was passed
114.867	from generation to generation;
117.438	it's all determined by genetics.
120.162	Or is it possible that something
120.162	else is going on here?
123.68	In rats, we can ask
123.68	this question and answer it.
127.275	So what we did is
127.275	a cross-fostering experiment.
130.904	You essentially separate the litter,
130.904	the babies of this rat, at birth,
135.683	to two kinds of fostering mothers --
137.574	not the real mothers,
137.574	but mothers that will take care of them:
140.926	high-licking mothers
140.926	and low-licking mothers.
143.204	And you can do the opposite
143.204	with the low-licking pups.
147.528	And the remarkable answer was,
149.925	it wasn't important
149.925	what gene you got from your mother.
153.988	It was not the biological mother
153.988	that defined this property of these rats.
159.76	It is the mother that
159.76	took care of the pups.
164.591	So how can this work?
168.741	I am an a epigeneticist.
170.568	I am interested in how genes are marked
174.264	by a chemical mark
176.004	during embryogenesis, during the time
176.004	we're in the womb of our mothers,
180.833	and decide which gene will be expressed
183.336	in what tissue.
184.542	Different genes are expressed in the brain
184.542	than in the liver and the eye.
189.538	And we thought: Is it possible
192.401	that the mother is somehow
192.401	reprogramming the gene of her offspring
199.372	through her behavior?
200.945	And we spent 10 years,
202.58	and we found that there is a cascade
202.58	of biochemical events
206.645	by which the licking and grooming
206.645	of the mother, the care of the mother,
210.112	is translated to biochemical signals
212.619	that go into the nucleus and into the DNA
215.954	and program it differently.
218.056	So now the animal can prepare
218.056	itself for life:
222.976	Is life going to be harsh?
225.621	Is there going to be a lot of food?
227.407	Are there going to be a lot of cats
227.407	and snakes around,
229.956	or will I live
229.956	in an upper-class neighborhood
232.303	where all I have to do
232.303	is behave well and proper,
235.034	and that will gain me social acceptance?
238.798	And now one can think about
238.798	how important that process can be
244.413	for our lives.
245.612	We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.
249.231	The DNA is old.
251.184	It evolved during evolution.
253.758	But it doesn't tell us
253.758	if you are going to be born in Stockholm,
258.115	where the days are long in the summer
258.115	and short in the winter,
261.525	or in Ecuador,
262.854	where there's an equal number of hours
262.854	for day and night all year round.
266.411	And that has such an enormous [effect]
266.411	on our physiology.
271.309	So what we suggest is,
271.309	perhaps what happens early in life,
275.569	those signals that come
275.569	through the mother,
277.76	tell the child what kind of social world
277.76	you're going to be living in.
282.299	It will be harsh, and you'd better
282.299	be anxious and be stressful,
285.723	or it's going to be an easy world,
285.723	and you have to be different.
288.87	Is it going to be a world
288.87	with a lot of light or little light?
292.084	Is it going to be a world
292.084	with a lot of food or little food?
296.093	If there's no food around,
297.641	you'd better develop your brain to binge
297.641	whenever you see a meal,
302.281	or store every piece of food
302.281	that you have as fat.
308.639	So this is good.
310.093	Evolution has selected this
311.974	to allow our fixed, old DNA
311.974	to function in a dynamic way
316.894	in new environments.
319.197	But sometimes things can go wrong;
322.526	for example, if you're born
322.526	to a poor family
326.412	"and the signals are, ""You better binge,"
329.365	you better eat every piece of food
329.365	"you're going to encounter."""
332.604	But now we humans
332.604	and our brain have evolved,
334.88	have changed evolution even faster.
337	Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.
340.388	And therefore, the preparation
340.388	that we had by our mothers
346.822	is turning out to be maladaptive.
350.171	The same preparation that was supposed
350.171	to protect us from hunger and famine
354.408	is going to cause obesity,
356.889	cardiovascular problems
356.889	and metabolic disease.
360.486	So this concept that genes
360.486	could be marked by our experience,
363.982	and especially the early life experience,
366.307	can provide us a unifying explanation
369.145	of both health and disease.
372.432	But is true only for rats?
374.814	The problem is, we cannot
374.814	test this in humans,
377.79	because ethically, we cannot administer
377.79	child adversity in a random way.
381.926	So if a poor child develops
381.926	a certain property,
385.254	we don't know whether
385.254	this is caused by poverty
389.017	or whether poor people have bad genes.
391.865	So geneticists will try to tell you
391.865	that poor people are poor
395.004	because their genes make them poor.
397.084	Epigeneticists will tell you
399.068	poor people are in a bad environment
399.068	or an impoverished environment
403.202	that creates that phenotype,
403.202	that property.
407.396	So we moved to look
407.396	into our cousins, the monkeys.
413.907	My colleague, Stephen Suomi,
413.907	has been rearing monkeys
417.625	in two different ways:
418.81	randomly separated the monkey
418.81	from the mother
421.735	and reared her with a nurse
424.351	and surrogate motherhood conditions.
427.334	So these monkeys didn't have
427.334	a mother; they had a nurse.
430.029	And other monkeys were reared
430.029	with their normal, natural mothers.
434.673	And when they were old,
434.673	they were completely different animals.
439.393	The monkeys that had a mother
439.393	did not care about alcohol,
442.51	they were not sexually aggressive.
444.213	The monkeys that didn't have a mother
444.213	were aggressive, were stressed
448.004	and were alcoholics.
450.302	So we looked at their DNA
450.302	early after birth, to see:
455.808	Is it possible that the mother is marking?
458.599	Is there a signature of the mother
458.599	in the DNA of the offspring?
463.981	These are Day-14 monkeys,
466.257	and what you see here is the modern way
466.257	by which we study epigenetics.
470.357	We can now map those chemical marks,
470.357	which we call methylation marks,
475.044	on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.
478.326	We can map the entire genome.
480.227	We can now compare the monkey
480.227	that had a mother or not.
483.318	And here's a visual presentation of this.
485.296	What you see is the genes
485.296	that got more methylated are red.
490.057	The genes that got
490.057	less methylated are green.
493.095	You can see many genes are changing,
495.603	because not having a mother
495.603	is not just one thing --
498.341	it affects the whole way;
499.896	it sends signals about the whole way
499.896	your world is going to look
503.428	when you become an adult.
505.211	And you can see the two groups of monkeys
507.656	extremely well-separated from each other.
511.212	How early does this develop?
513.898	These monkeys already
513.898	didn't see their mothers,
516.135	so they had a social experience.
517.858	Do we sense our social status,
517.858	even at the moment of birth?
522.951	So in this experiment,
522.951	we took placentas of monkeys
527.024	that had different social status.
529.518	What's interesting about social rank
529.518	is that across all living beings,
534.916	they will structure
534.916	themselves by hierarchy.
538.165	Monkey number one is the boss;
540.377	monkey number four is the peon.
542.739	You put four monkeys in a cage,
545.202	there will always be a boss
545.202	and always be a peon.
549.268	And what's interesting
549.268	is that the monkey number one
553.14	is much healthier than monkey number four.
556.596	And if you put them in a cage,
558.424	monkey number one will not eat as much.
563.145	Monkey number four will eat [a lot].
565.949	And what you see here
565.949	in this methylation mapping,
570.246	a dramatic separation at birth
573.045	of the animals that had
573.045	a high social status
575.783	versus the animals
575.783	that did not have a high status.
579.169	So we are born already knowing
579.169	the social information,
583.424	and that social information
583.424	is not bad or good,
586.501	it just prepares us for life,
587.944	because we have to program
587.944	our biology differently
592.209	if we are in the high
592.209	or the low social status.
596.146	But how can you study this in humans?
598.53	We can't do experiments,
598.53	we can't administer adversity to humans.
602.002	But God does experiments with humans,
604.619	and it's called natural disasters.
606.931	One of the hardest natural disasters
606.931	in Canadian history
611.215	happened in my province of Quebec.
613.649	It's the ice storm of 1998.
616.076	We lost our entire electrical grid
616.076	because of an ice storm
619.9	when the temperatures
619.9	were, in the dead of winter in Quebec,
622.921	minus 20 to minus 30.
624.894	And there were pregnant
624.894	mothers during that time.
627.902	And my colleague Suzanne King
627.902	followed the children of these mothers
633.958	for 15 years.
636.385	And what happened was,
636.385	that as the stress increased --
640.655	and here we had objective
640.655	measures of stress:
643.287	How long were you without power?
643.287	Where did you spend your time?
647.749	Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment
647.749	or in some posh country home?
652.776	So all of these added up
652.776	to a social stress scale,
655.458	and you can ask the question:
656.864	How did the children look?
659.932	And it appears that as stress increases,
662.59	the children develop more autism,
664.672	they develop more metabolic diseases
667.235	and they develop more autoimmune diseases.
670.607	We would map the methylation state,
673.055	and again, you see the green genes
673.055	becoming red as stress increases,
678.617	the red genes becoming green
678.617	as stress increases,
682.133	an entire rearrangement
682.133	of the genome in response to stress.
689.262	So if we can program genes,
692.495	if we are not just the slaves
692.495	of the history of our genes,
696.492	that they could be programmed,
696.492	can we deprogram them?
699.913	Because epigenetic causes
699.913	can cause diseases like cancer,
705.479	metabolic disease
707.306	and mental health diseases.
709.94	Let's talk about cocaine addiction.
713.395	Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation
716.475	that can lead to death
716.475	and to loss of human life.
721.365	We asked the question:
723.314	Can we reprogram the addicted brain
726.577	to make that animal not addicted anymore?
732.197	We used a cocaine addiction model
736.501	that recapitulates what happens in humans.
738.614	In humans, you're in high school,
741.306	some friends suggest you use some cocaine,
743.41	you take cocaine, nothing happens.
745.24	Months pass by, something reminds you
745.24	of what happened the first time,
749.465	a pusher pushes cocaine,
751.129	and you become addicted
751.129	and your life has changed.
753.985	In rats, we do the same thing.
755.655	My colleague, Gal Yadid,
757.254	he trains the animals
757.254	to get used to cocaine,
760.278	then for one month, no cocaine.
763.43	Then he reminds them of the party
763.43	when they saw the cocaine the first time
767.13	by cue, the colors of the cage
767.13	when they saw cocaine.
769.97	And they go crazy.
771.646	They will press the lever to get cocaine
774.117	until they die.
775.867	We first determined that the difference
775.867	between these animals
780.334	is that during that time
780.334	when nothing happens,
783.059	there's no cocaine around,
784.855	their epigenome is rearranged.
786.8	Their genes are re-marked
786.8	in a different way,
789.713	and when the cue comes,
789.713	their genome is ready
793.479	to develop this addictive phenotype.
796.385	So we treated these animals with drugs
796.385	that either increase DNA methylation,
803.179	which was the epigenetic
803.179	marker to look at,
805.427	or decrease epigenetic markings.
808.934	And we found that
808.934	if we increased methylation,
812.213	these animals go even crazier.
814.12	They become more craving for cocaine.
816.628	But if we reduce the DNA methylation,
820.078	the animals are not addicted anymore.
822.206	We have reprogrammed them.
823.849	And a fundamental difference
823.849	between an epigenetic drug
827.179	and any other drug
828.509	is that with epigenetic drugs,
830.705	we essentially remove
830.705	the signs of experience,
834.861	and once they're gone,
837.012	they will not come back
837.012	unless you have the same experience.
840.057	The animal now is reprogrammed.
841.735	So when we visited the animals
845.98	which is in human terms
845.98	many years of life,
848.923	they were still not addicted --
848.923	by a single epigenetic treatment.
856.292	So what did we learn about DNA?
859.587	DNA is not just a sequence of letters;
862.736	it's not just a script.
864.879	DNA is a dynamic movie.
868.187	Our experiences are being written
868.187	into this movie, which is interactive.
873.122	You're, like, watching a movie
873.122	of your life, with the DNA,
876.699	with your remote control.
878.505	You can remove an actor and add an actor.
882.692	And so you have, in spite
882.692	of the deterministic nature of genetics,
888.611	you have control of the way
888.611	your genes look,
892.324	and this has a tremendous
892.324	optimistic message
895.618	for the ability to now encounter
895.618	some of the deadly diseases
899.15	like cancer, mental health,
902.078	with a new approach,
905.03	looking at them as maladaptation.
907.588	And if we can epigenetically intervene,
910.686	[we can] reverse the movie
910.686	by removing an actor
914.206	and setting up a new narrative.
917.848	So what I told you today is,
920.369	our DNA is really combined
920.369	of two components,
925.485	two layers of information.
927.926	One layer of information is old,
931.625	evolved from millions
931.625	of years of evolution.
935.154	It is fixed and very hard to change.
939.231	The other layer of information
939.231	is the epigenetic layer,
943.105	which is open and dynamic
947.024	and sets up a narrative
947.024	that is interactive,
951.64	that allows us to control,
951.64	to a large extent, our destiny,
959.515	to help the destiny of our children
962.995	and to hopefully conquer disease
967.174	and serious health challenges
971.614	that have plagued humankind
971.614	for a long time.
975.249	So even though we are determined
978.666	by our genes,
980.445	we have a degree of freedom
983.536	that can set up our life
983.536	to a life of responsibility.
987.693	Thank you.
988.937	(Applause)
