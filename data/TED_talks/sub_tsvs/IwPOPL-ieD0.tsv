27.126	I was just thinking
32.118	that I have been missing you way too long
37.526	There's something inside this weary head
42.718	that wants us to love just instead
47.768	But I was just thinking,
52.801	merely thinking
60.345	I've got loads of pictures,
65.912	I've got the one of you
65.912	in that dancing dress
71.079	But man I feel silly in that dim light
76.221	Just after doing you
76.221	by the sight of my Kodak delights,
81.678	I am sinking,
86.074	merely sinking
93.535	I think about long distance rates
93.535	instead of kissing you babe
99.892	I'm a singer without a song
104.834	If I wait for you longer
107.369	my affection is stronger
110.823	and I ... I was just thinking,
119.28	merely thinking
124.203	that this boat is sinking
139.493	I'm tired of postcards,
145.089	especially the ones
145.089	with cute dogs and cupids
150.527	I'm tired of calling you and missing you
154.934	and dreaming I slept with you
157.839	Don't get me wrong
157.839	I still desperately love you
162.123	inside this weary head
165.9	I just want us to love just instead
170.584	But I was just thinking and thinking,
176.437	merely thinking
184.079	I think about long distance rates
184.079	instead of kissing you babe
190.314	and time is running me still
195.064	If I wait for you longer
197.668	my affection is stronger
201.626	I ... I was just thinking
210.873	I ... I was just thinking
219.315	that I'm tired of calling you once a week
223.655	thinking of long distance rates
223.655	instead of kissing you
230.005	So baby I'm sinking,
235.928	merely sinking
239.788	(Guitar music ends)
242.55	(Applause)
249.865	Thank you.
252.403	Singing is sharing.
256.314	When you sing, you have to know
256.314	what you're talking about intimately,
260.632	and you have to be willing
260.632	to share this insight
263.942	and give away a piece of yourself.
266.055	I look for this intention
266.055	to share in everything,
270.592	and I ask: what are the intentions
270.592	behind this architecture or this product
276.223	or this restaurant or this meal?
278.896	And if your intentions
278.896	are to impress people
282.004	or to get the big applause at the end,
284.634	then you are taking, not giving.
288.193	And this is a song that's about --
290.686	it's the kind of song that everyone
290.686	has their version of.
293.408	"This song is called ""Home,"""
295.596	"and it's sort of a ""This is where"
295.596	"I'm from, nice to meet you all,"""
299.366	kind of song.
300.542	(Laughter)
302.763	(Applause)
309.186	(Piano music)
355.179	Home is the sound of birds
355.179	early in the morning
361.865	Home is a song I've always remembered
366.569	Home is the memory
366.569	of my first day in school
371.588	Home is the books that I carry around
376.251	Home is an alley in a faraway town
380.756	Home is the places I’ve been
380.756	and where I’d like to go
390.742	Home
392.981	I'm always gonna feel at home
397.275	No matter where I may roam
401.909	I'm always gonna find my way back home
406.25	No matter how far I’m gone
410.075	I’m always gonna feel this longing
417.027	No matter where I might stay
427.84	Home is a feather twirling in the air
432.719	Home is flowers in a windowsill
437.852	Home is all the things she said to me
442.751	Home is a photo I never threw away
447.481	Home is the smile on my face when I die
452.775	Home is the taste of an apple pie
464.175	I met a woman, she always lived
464.175	in the same place
471.929	And she said home is where
471.929	you’re born and raised
480.72	And I met a man, he sat
480.72	looking out to the sea
487.716	And he said home is where you want to be
496.72	I met a girl in some downtown bar
503.877	And she said I'll have
503.877	whatever he's having
512.231	And I asked her how come
512.231	we never met before?
518.487	And she said all my life I’ve been trying
525.37	to get a place of my own
529.582	I’m always gonna feel at home
533.85	No matter where I may roam
538.519	Always gonna find my way back home
542.801	No matter how far I’m gone
546.816	I'm always gonna feel this longing
553.517	No matter where I might stay
