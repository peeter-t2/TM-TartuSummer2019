12.815	In the next six minutes
12.815	that you will listen to me,
16.788	the world will have lost three mothers
19.349	while delivering their babies:
22.411	one, because of a severe complication;
26.321	second, because she will be a teenager
28.863	and her body will not
28.863	be prepared for birth;
32.672	but the third, only because of lack
32.672	of access to basic clean tools
38.702	at the time of childbirth.
41.496	She will not be alone.
43.803	Over one million mothers and babies
43.803	die every single year
47.502	in the developing world,
49.055	only because of lack of access
49.055	to basic cleanliness
52.823	while giving birth to their babies.
56.601	My journey began on a hot summer afternoon
59.103	in India in 2008,
61.295	when after a day of meeting women
61.295	and listening to their needs,
64.992	I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.
68.855	As a mother, I was very curious
68.855	on how she delivered babies in her house.
73.629	After a deep and engaging
73.629	conversation with her
76.356	on how she considered it a profound
76.356	calling to do what she was doing,
80.726	I asked her a parting question:
83.401	Do you have the tools that you need
83.401	to deliver the babies?
87.761	I got to see her tool.
90.419	"""This is what I use to separate"
90.419	"the mother and the baby,"" she said."
95.62	Unsure of how to react, I held this
95.62	agricultural tool in my hand in shock.
101.464	I took a picture of this,
101.464	hugged her and walked away.
105.46	My mind was flooded with reflections
105.46	of my own infection
108.453	that I had to struggle with
108.453	for a year past childbirth
111.509	despite having access
111.509	to the best medical care,
115.083	and memories of my conversation
115.083	with my father,
117.489	who had lost his mom to childbirth,
119.678	on how he thought his life
119.678	would be so different
122.144	if she would have been
122.144	just next to him growing up.
125.632	As a product developer,
125.632	I started my process of research.
129.413	I was very excited to find
129.413	that there was a product out there
132.612	called the Clean Birth Kit.
134.65	But I just couldn't buy one for months.
138.031	They were only assembled
138.031	based on availability of funding.
142.818	Finally, when I got my hands on one,
142.818	I was in shock again.
146.783	I would never use these tools
146.783	to deliver my baby, I thought.
150.473	But to confirm my instincts,
150.473	I went back to the women,
153.408	some of whom had the experience
153.408	of using this product.
157.316	Lo and behold, they had
157.316	the same reaction and more.
160.842	The women said they would rather
160.842	deliver on a floor
163.376	than on a plastic sheet
163.376	that smeared blood all over.
165.998	They were absolutely right --
165.998	it would cause more infection.
169.437	The thread provided was a highway
169.437	to bacterial infection
172.47	through the baby's umbilical cord,
174.193	and the blade used was the kind
174.193	that men used for shaving,
177.061	and they did not want it
177.061	anywhere close to them.
180.449	There was no incentive for anybody
180.449	to redesign this product,
183.427	because it was based on charity.
185.362	The women were never
185.362	consulted in this process.
188.704	And to my surprise, the need
188.704	was not only in homes
191.227	but also in institutional settings
191.227	with high-volume births.
194.58	Situations in remote areas
194.58	were even more daunting.
198.449	This had to change.
200.049	I made this my area of focus.
202.335	I started the design process
202.335	by collecting feedback,
206.411	developing prototypes
207.85	and engaging with various stakeholders
207.85	researching global protocols.
212.126	With every single prototype,
212.126	we went back to the women
214.792	to ensure that we had a product for them.
217.869	What I learned through this process
217.869	was that these women,
220.619	despite their extreme poverty,
222.082	placed great value
222.082	on their health and well-being.
224.483	They were absolutely not poor in mind.
226.957	As with all of us, they would appreciate
226.957	a well-designed product
229.982	developed for their needs.
232.07	After many iterations
232.07	working with experts,
234.591	medical health professionals
236.096	and the women themselves,
237.955	I should say it was not
237.955	an easy process at all,
241.347	but we had a simple and beautiful design.
245.507	For a dollar more than what
245.507	the existing product was offered for,
250.301	at three dollars, we were able
250.301	"to deliver ""janma,"""
253.076	a clean birth kit in a purse.
255.878	"Janma, meaning ""birth,"" contained"
255.878	a blood-absorbing sheet
258.722	for the woman to give birth on,
260.473	a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp,
260.473	a bar of soap, a pair of gloves
264.502	and the first cloth
264.502	to wipe the baby clean.
267.189	All this came packaged
267.189	in a beautiful purse
269.401	that was given to the mother
269.401	as a gift after all her hard work,
272.64	that she carried home with pride
272.64	as a symbol of prosperity.
277.685	One woman reacted to this gift.
280.167	"She said, ""Is this really mine?"
280.167	"Can I keep it?"""
283.915	The other one said,
283.915	"""Will you give me a different color"
286.548	"when I have my next baby?"""
288.051	(Laughter)
289.829	Better yet, a woman expressed
289.829	that this was the first purse
292.77	that she had ever owned in her life.
294.871	The kit, aside from its symbolism
294.871	and its simplicity,
297.679	is designed to follow
297.679	globally recommended medical protocol
301.015	and serves as a behavior-change tool
301.015	to follow steps one after the other.
305.918	It can not only be used in homes,
305.918	but also in institutional settings.
310.476	To date, our kit has impacted
310.476	over 600,000 mothers and babies
314.449	around the world.
316.221	It's a humbling experience
316.221	to watch these numbers grow,
319.488	and I cannot wait until
319.488	we reach a hundred million.
324.699	But women's health issues do not end here.
327.597	There are thousands of simple issues
327.597	that require low-cost interventions.
331.631	We have facts to prove
331.631	that if we invest in women and girls
334.571	and provide them with better
334.571	health and well-being,
337.004	they will deliver healthier and wealthier
337.004	and prosperous communities.
342.039	We have to start by bringing simplicity
342.039	and dignity to women's health issues:
346.047	from reducing maternal mortality,
346.047	to breaking taboos,
349.143	to empowering women
349.143	to take control of their own lives.
352.677	This is my dream.
355.137	But it is not possible to achieve it
355.137	without engaging men and women alike
359.617	from around the world --
361.082	yes, all of you.
364.593	I recently heard this lyric
364.593	by Leonard Cohen:
368.782	"""Ring the bells that still can ring."
372.029	Forget your perfect offering.
375.193	There is a crack in everything.
378.118	"That's how the light gets in."""
380.89	This is my bit of light.
383.361	But we need more light.
385.029	In fact, we need huge spotlights
385.029	placed in the world of women's health
388.497	if we need a better tomorrow.
390.819	We should never forget that women
390.819	are at the center of a sustainable world,
395.336	and we do not exist without them.
397.887	Thank you.
399.07	(Applause)
