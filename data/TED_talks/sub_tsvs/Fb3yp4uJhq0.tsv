17.415	Hi.
19.622	Thank you.
20.983	[Jennifer Brea is sound-sensitive.
22.704	The live audience was asked
22.704	to applaud ASL-style, in silence.]
25.873	So, five years ago, this was me.
29.747	I was a PhD student at Harvard,
31.776	and I loved to travel.
34.472	I had just gotten engaged
34.472	to marry the love of my life.
39.072	I was 28, and like so many of us
39.072	when we are in good health,
43.071	I felt like I was invincible.
46.477	Then one day I had
46.477	a fever of 104.7 degrees.
50.758	I probably should have gone to the doctor,
52.831	but I'd never really been sick in my life,
55.419	and I knew that usually,
55.419	if you have a virus,
57.796	you stay home and you make
57.796	some chicken soup,
60.953	and in a few days,
60.953	everything will be fine.
64.499	But this time it wasn't fine.
67.56	After the fever broke,
69.121	for three weeks I was so dizzy,
69.121	I couldn't leave my house.
73.467	I would walk straight into door frames.
76.335	I had to hug the walls
76.335	just to make it to the bathroom.
80.613	That spring I got infection
80.613	after infection,
83.825	and every time I went to the doctor,
85.676	he said there was absolutely
85.676	nothing wrong.
89.533	He had his laboratory tests,
91.182	which always came back normal.
93.875	All I had were my symptoms,
95.866	which I could describe,
97.82	but no one else can see.
101.37	I know it sounds silly,
102.617	but you have to find a way
102.617	to explain things like this to yourself,
105.909	and so I thought maybe I was just aging.
110.114	Maybe this is what it's like
110.114	to be on the other side of 25.
113.691	(Laughter)
116.808	Then the neurological symptoms started.
119.59	Sometimes I would find that I couldn't
119.59	draw the right side of a circle.
124.325	Other times I wouldn't be able
124.325	to speak or move at all.
130.33	I saw every kind of specialist:
132.088	infectious disease doctors,
132.088	dermatologists, endocrinologists,
135.184	cardiologists.
136.945	I even saw a psychiatrist.
139.679	My psychiatrist said,
139.679	"""It's clear you're really sick,"
142.947	but not with anything psychiatric.
146.045	I hope they can find out
146.045	"what's wrong with you."""
150.094	The next day, my neurologist
150.094	diagnosed me with conversion disorder.
154.842	He told me that everything --
157.255	the fevers, the sore throats,
157.255	the sinus infection,
160.916	all of the gastrointestinal,
160.916	neurological and cardiac symptoms --
164.715	were being caused
164.715	by some distant emotional trauma
167.457	that I could not remember.
170.069	The symptoms were real, he said,
172.546	but they had no biological cause.
176.527	I was training to be a social scientist.
179.16	I had studied statistics,
179.16	probability theory,
182.416	mathematical modeling,
182.416	experimental design.
187.058	I felt like I couldn't just reject
187.058	my neurologist's diagnosis.
191.599	It didn't feel true,
193.215	but I knew from my training
193.215	that the truth is often counterintuitive,
197.356	so easily obscured
197.356	by what we want to believe.
200.514	So I had to consider the possibility
200.514	that he was right.
205.603	That day, I ran a small experiment.
208.919	I walked back the two miles
208.919	from my neurologist's office to my house,
213.229	my legs wrapped in this strange,
213.229	almost electric kind of pain.
218.475	I meditated on that pain,
220.102	contemplating how my mind
220.102	could have possibly generated all this.
225.32	As soon as I walked through the door,
227.219	I collapsed.
228.837	My brain and my spinal cord were burning.
232.696	My neck was so stiff
232.696	I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,
237.324	and the slightest sound --
239.099	the rustling of the sheets,
240.958	my husband walking barefoot
240.958	in the next room --
243.737	could cause excruciating pain.
247.832	I would spend most
247.832	of the next two years in bed.
251.235	How could my doctor
251.235	have gotten it so wrong?
254.939	I thought I had a rare disease,
257.144	something doctors had never seen.
259.926	And then I went online
261.145	and found thousands of people
261.145	all over the world
263.98	living with the same symptoms,
266.087	similarly isolated,
267.675	similarly disbelieved.
269.854	Some could still work,
271.161	but had to spend their evenings
271.161	and weekends in bed,
273.67	just so they could show up
273.67	the next Monday.
276.364	On the other end of the spectrum,
278.468	some were so sick
280.23	they had to live in complete darkness,
282.56	unable to tolerate
282.56	the sound of a human voice
285.956	or the touch of a loved one.
289.469	I was diagnosed
289.469	with myalgic encephalomyelitis.
294.554	You've probably heard it called
294.554	"""chronic fatigue syndrome."""
298.987	For decades, that's a name
300.933	that's meant that this
303.578	has been the dominant image
304.985	of a disease that can be
304.985	as serious as this.
309.468	The key symptom we all share
311.016	is that whenever we exert ourselves --
311.016	physically, mentally --
315.296	we pay and we pay hard.
317.807	If my husband goes for a run,
317.807	he might be sore for a couple of days.
321.325	If I try to walk half a block,
321.325	I might be bedridden for a week.
325.323	It is a perfect custom prison.
328.261	I know ballet dancers who can't dance,
331.033	accountants who can't add,
333.23	medical students who never became doctors.
336.421	It doesn't matter what you once were;
339.056	you can't do it anymore.
341.475	It's been four years,
343.389	and I've still never been as well as I was
346.009	the minute before I walked home
346.009	from my neurologist's office.
350.683	It's estimated that about 15 to 30 million
350.683	people around the world
353.902	have this disease.
355.604	In the US, where I'm from,
355.604	it's about one million people.
358.891	That makes it roughly twice as common
358.891	as multiple sclerosis.
363.797	Patients can live for decades
363.797	with the physical function
366.563	of someone with congestive heart failure.
369.31	Twenty-five percent of us
369.31	are homebound or bedridden,
372.927	and 75 to 85 percent of us
372.927	can't even work part-time.
377.385	Yet doctors do not treat us
380.064	and science does not study us.
383.116	How could a disease this common
383.116	and this devastating
387.325	have been forgotten by medicine?
391.264	When my doctor diagnosed me
391.264	with conversion disorder,
393.812	he was invoking a lineage
393.812	of ideas about women's bodies
396.524	that are over 2,500 years old.
399.215	The Roman physician Galen thought
400.972	that hysteria was caused
400.972	by sexual deprivation
403.967	in particularly passionate women.
407.125	The Greeks thought the uterus
407.125	would literally dry up
409.913	and wander around the body
409.913	in search of moisture,
412.364	pressing on internal organs --
414.284	yes --
416.648	causing symptoms from extreme emotions
419.367	to dizziness and paralysis.
422.715	The cure was marriage and motherhood.
426.898	These ideas went largely unchanged
426.898	for several millennia until the 1880s,
431.482	when neurologists tried to modernize
431.482	the theory of hysteria.
435.764	Sigmund Freud developed a theory
437.441	that the unconscious mind
437.441	could produce physical symptoms
440.261	when dealing with memories or emotions
442.3	too painful for the conscious
442.3	mind to handle.
444.635	It converted these emotions
444.635	into physical symptoms.
449.46	This meant that men
449.46	could now get hysteria,
451.68	but of course women were still
451.68	the most susceptible.
455.448	When I began investigating
455.448	the history of my own disease,
459.089	I was amazed to find how deep
459.089	these ideas still run.
463.011	In 1934,
	at the Los Angeles County General Hospital
469.02	became seriously ill.
470.585	They had muscle weakness, stiffness
470.585	in the neck and back, fevers --
475.02	all of the same symptoms
475.02	I had when I first got diagnosed.
478.928	Doctors thought
478.928	it was a new form of polio.
482.133	Since then, there have been more
482.133	than 70 outbreaks documented
485.088	around the world,
486.273	of a strikingly similar
486.273	post-infectious disease.
489.419	All of these outbreaks have tended
489.419	to disproportionately affect women,
493.482	and in time, when doctors failed to find
493.482	the one cause of the disease,
497.433	they thought that these outbreaks
497.433	were mass hysteria.
501.115	Why has this idea had such staying power?
505.567	I do think it has to do with sexism,
507.387	but I also think that fundamentally,
507.387	doctors want to help.
510.852	They want to know the answer,
512.646	and this category allows doctors to treat
512.646	what would otherwise be untreatable,
517.561	to explain illnesses
517.561	that have no explanation.
521.079	The problem is that this
521.079	can cause real harm.
524.382	In the 1950s, a psychiatrist
524.382	named Eliot Slater
528.002	studied a cohort of 85 patients
528.002	who had been diagnosed with hysteria.
532.766	Nine years later, 12 of them were dead
532.766	and 30 had become disabled.
536.787	Many had undiagnosed conditions
536.787	like multiple sclerosis,
540.244	epilepsy, brain tumors.
543.259	In 1980, hysteria was officially
543.259	"renamed ""conversion disorder."""
547.563	When my neurologist gave me
547.563	that diagnosis in 2012,
550.911	he was echoing Freud's words verbatim,
553.552	and even today,
554.727	women are 2 to 10 times more likely
554.727	to receive that diagnosis.
560.487	The problem with the theory of hysteria
560.487	or psychogenic illness
564.51	is that it can never be proven.
566.568	It is by definition
566.568	the absence of evidence,
570.192	and in the case of ME,
571.591	psychological explanations
571.591	have held back biological research.
575.62	All around the world, ME is one
575.62	of the least funded diseases.
579.321	In the US, we spend each year
579.321	roughly 2,500 dollars per AIDS patient,
590.1	and just 5 dollars per year
590.1	per ME patient.
594.125	This was not just lightning.
596.23	I was not just unlucky.
598.494	The ignorance surrounding my disease
598.494	has been a choice,
601.609	a choice made by the institutions
601.609	that were supposed to protect us.
607.535	We don't know why ME
607.535	sometimes runs in families,
610.43	why you can get it
610.43	after almost any infection,
612.919	from enteroviruses
612.919	to Epstein-Barr virus to Q fever,
617.123	or why it affects women
617.123	at two to three times the rate of men.
621.058	This issue is much bigger
621.058	than just my disease.
624.356	When I first got sick,
625.563	old friends were reaching out to me.
628.18	I soon found myself a part
628.18	of a cohort of women in their late 20s
631.333	whose bodies were falling apart.
634.012	What was striking was just how
634.012	much trouble we were having
636.891	being taken seriously.
638.577	I learned of one woman with scleroderma,
640.559	an autoimmune connective tissue disease,
642.683	who was told for years
642.683	that it was all in her head.
645.417	Between the time of onset and diagnosis,
647.953	her esophagus was so thoroughly damaged,
650.404	she will never be able to eat again.
652.673	Another woman with ovarian cancer,
655.376	who for years was told
655.376	that it was just early menopause.
659.188	A friend from college,
660.78	whose brain tumor was misdiagnosed
660.78	for years as anxiety.
666.222	Here's why this worries me:
669.125	since the 1950s, rates of many
669.125	autoimmune diseases
672.6	have doubled to tripled.
674.818	Forty-five percent of patients
674.818	who are eventually diagnosed
677.782	with a recognized autoimmune disease
679.8	are initially told they're hypochondriacs.
682.783	Like the hysteria of old,
682.783	this has everything to do with gender
685.957	and with whose stories we believe.
688.974	Seventy-five percent
688.974	of autoimmune disease patients are women,
692.649	and in some diseases,
692.649	it's as high as 90 percent.
697.076	Even though these diseases
697.076	disproportionately affect women,
699.957	they are not women's diseases.
701.633	ME affects children
701.633	and ME affects millions of men.
705.345	And as one patient told me,
707.154	we get it coming and going --
708.686	if you're a woman, you're told
708.686	you're exaggerating your symptoms,
712.318	but if you're a guy, you're told
712.318	to be strong, to buck up.
716.676	And men may even have
716.676	a more difficult time getting diagnosed.
729.419	My brain is not what it used to be.
745.914	Here's the good part:
748.645	despite everything, I still have hope.
751.903	So many diseases were once
751.903	thought of as psychological
755.827	until science uncovered
755.827	their biological mechanisms.
759.323	Patients with epilepsy
759.323	could be forcibly institutionalized
762.441	until the EEG was able to measure
762.441	abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
767.5	Multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed
767.5	as hysterical paralysis
771.8	until the CAT scan and the MRI
771.8	discovered brain lesions.
775.945	And recently, we used to think
777.484	that stomach ulcers
777.484	were just caused by stress,
780.328	until we discovered
780.328	that H. pylori was the culprit.
784.801	ME has never benefited
784.801	from the kind of science
787.719	that other diseases have had,
790.053	but that's starting to change.
792.661	In Germany, scientists are starting
792.661	to find evidence of autoimmunity,
796.226	and in Japan, of brain inflammation.
799.406	In the US, scientists at Stanford
799.406	are finding abnormalities
802.484	in energy metabolism
804.404	that are 16 standard deviations
804.404	away from normal.
808.64	And in Norway, researchers
808.64	are running a phase-3 clinical trial
812.709	on a cancer drug that in some patients
812.709	causes complete remission.
817.798	What also gives me hope
820.316	is the resilience of patients.
823.968	Online we came together,
826.251	and we shared our stories.
829.449	We devoured what research there was.
832.743	We experimented on ourselves.
835.496	We became our own scientists
835.496	and our own doctors
837.893	because we had to be.
840.378	And slowly I added five percent here,
840.378	five percent there,
844.141	until eventually, on a good day,
846.398	I was able to leave my home.
849.815	I still had to make ridiculous choices:
852.568	Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,
852.568	or will I wash my hair today?
856.924	But it gave me hope
856.924	that I could be treated.
859.693	I had a sick body; that was all.
862.789	And with the right kind of help,
862.789	maybe one day I could get better.
867.74	I came together with patients
867.74	around the world,
871.466	and we started to fight.
873.863	We have filled the void
873.863	with something wonderful,
877.698	but it is not enough.
880.662	I still don't know if I will ever
880.662	be able to run again,
884.723	or walk at any distance,
886.644	or do any of those kinetic things
886.644	that I now only get to do in my dreams.
891.143	But I am so grateful
891.143	for how far I have come.
895.955	Progress is slow,
897.464	and it is up
899.31	and it is down,
901.222	but I am getting a little better each day.
906.013	I remember what it was like
906.013	when I was stuck in that bedroom,
910.548	when it had been months
910.548	since I had seen the sun.
915.226	I thought that I would die there.
918.961	But here I am today,
921.255	with you,
923.513	and that is a miracle.
928.606	I don't know what would have happened
928.606	had I not been one of the lucky ones,
932.377	had I gotten sick before the internet,
934.995	had I not found my community.
937.777	I probably would have already
937.777	taken my own life,
941.028	as so many others have done.
944.094	How many lives could
944.094	we have saved, decades ago,
947.957	if we had asked the right questions?
950.626	How many lives could we save today
953.592	if we decide to make a real start?
957.205	Even once the true cause
957.205	of my disease is discovered,
960.881	if we don't change
960.881	our institutions and our culture,
964.38	we will do this again to another disease.
967.658	Living with this illness has taught me
969.676	that science and medicine
969.676	are profoundly human endeavors.
973.153	Doctors, scientists and policy makers
975.768	are not immune to the same biases
979.568	that affect all of us.
983.377	We need to think in more nuanced ways
983.377	about women's health.
987.119	Our immune systems are just as much
987.119	a battleground for equality
991.245	as the rest of our bodies.
993.253	We need to listen to patients' stories,
996.542	and we need to be willing
996.542	"to say, ""I don't know."""
1000.024	"""I don't know"" is a beautiful thing."
1003.235	"""I don't know"" is where discovery starts."
1007.365	And if we can do that,
1009.447	if we can approach the great vastness
1009.447	of all that we do not know,
1013.166	and then, rather than fear uncertainty,
1015.142	maybe we can greet it
1015.142	with a sense of wonder.
1018.342	Thank you.
1024.096	Thank you.
