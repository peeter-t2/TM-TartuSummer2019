12.185	[His Holiness Pope Francis
12.185	Filmed in Vatican City
14.625	First shown at TED2017]
16.72	Good evening – or, good morning,
16.72	I am not sure what time it is there.
24.52	Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled
24.52	to be participating in your conference.
32.516	I very much like its title
32.516	"– ""The Future You"" –"
37.64	because, while looking at tomorrow,
37.64	it invites us to open a dialogue today,
45.32	"to look at the future through a ""you."""
51.104	"""The Future You:"""
53.64	the future is made of yous,
53.64	it is made of encounters,
61.48	because life flows
61.48	through our relations with others.
66.28	Quite a few years of life
68.2	have strengthened my conviction
71.72	that each and everyone's existence
71.72	is deeply tied to that of others:
79.539	life is not time merely passing by,
79.539	life is about interactions.
88.2	As I meet, or lend an ear
88.2	to those who are sick,
93.44	to the migrants
93.44	who face terrible hardships
98.2	in search of a brighter future,
101.04	to prison inmates who carry
101.04	a hell of pain inside their hearts,
105.64	and to those, many of them young,
105.64	who cannot find a job,
110.76	I often find myself wondering:
115.28	"""Why them and not me?"""
120.875	I, myself, was born
120.875	in a family of migrants;
126.36	my father, my grandparents,
126.36	like many other Italians,
131.8	left for Argentina
133.88	and met the fate of those
133.88	who are left with nothing.
140.04	I could have very well ended up
140.04	"among today's ""discarded"" people."
145.72	And that's why I always ask myself,
145.72	deep in my heart:
150.461	"""Why them and not me?"""
156.04	First and foremost, I would love it
156.04	if this meeting could help to remind us
160.56	that we all need each other,
165.238	none of us is an island,
168.92	"an autonomous and independent ""I,"""
168.92	separated from the other,
173.84	and we can only build the future
173.84	by standing together, including everyone.
181.96	We don’t think about it often,
181.96	but everything is connected,
188	and we need to restore
188	our connections to a healthy state.
193.545	Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart
196.546	against my brother or my sister,
199.64	the open wound that was never cured,
199.64	the offense that was never forgiven,
203.72	the rancor that is only going to hurt me,
206.76	are all instances of a fight
206.76	that I carry within me,
210.086	a flare deep in my heart
210.086	that needs to be extinguished
212.8	before it goes up in flames,
212.8	leaving only ashes behind.
219.04	Many of us, nowadays,
222	seem to believe that a happy future
222	is something impossible to achieve.
227.56	While such concerns
227.56	must be taken very seriously,
231.12	they are not invincible.
234.44	They can be overcome when we don't lock
234.44	our door to the outside world.
241.6	Happiness can only be discovered
245.12	as a gift of harmony between the whole
245.12	and each single component.
250.92	Even science – and you know it
250.92	better than I do –
254.52	points to an understanding of reality
259.6	as a place where every element connects
259.6	and interacts with everything else.
268.64	And this brings me to my second message.
274.6	How wonderful would it be
277.679	if the growth of scientific
277.679	and technological innovation
283.4	would come along with more equality
283.4	and social inclusion.
290.6	How wonderful would it be,
290.6	while we discover faraway planets,
296.76	to rediscover the needs of the brothers
296.76	and sisters orbiting around us.
304.08	How wonderful would it be if solidarity,
307.32	this beautiful and, at times,
307.32	inconvenient word,
311.76	were not simply reduced to social work,
315.76	and became, instead, the default attitude
319.44	in political, economic
319.44	and scientific choices,
325.04	as well as in the relationships
325.04	among individuals, peoples and countries.
331.08	Only by educating people
331.08	to a true solidarity
335.112	will we be able to overcome
338.812	"the ""culture of waste,"""
343.43	which doesn't concern only food and goods
349.24	but, first and foremost, the people
351.92	who are cast aside
351.92	by our techno-economic systems
357.76	which, without even realizing it,
362.16	are now putting products
362.16	at their core, instead of people.
369.16	Solidarity is a term that many wish
369.16	to erase from the dictionary.
377.2	Solidarity, however,
377.2	is not an automatic mechanism.
382.2	It cannot be programmed or controlled.
385.48	It is a free response born
385.48	from the heart of each and everyone.
390.52	Yes, a free response!
394.04	When one realizes
395.28	that life, even in the middle
395.28	of so many contradictions, is a gift,
400.04	that love is the source
400.04	and the meaning of life,
404.52	how can they withhold their urge
404.52	to do good to another fellow being?
410.88	In order to do good,
412.68	we need memory, we need courage
412.68	and we need creativity.
420.12	And I know that TED
420.12	gathers many creative minds.
429	Yes, love does require
429	a creative, concrete
436.012	and ingenious attitude.
439.57	Good intentions and conventional formulas,
444.685	so often used to appease
444.685	our conscience, are not enough.
450.856	Let us help each other,
450.856	all together, to remember
454.72	that the other is not
454.72	a statistic or a number.
459.817	The other has a face.
462.166	"The ""you"" is always a real presence,"
466.413	a person to take care of.
473.274	There is a parable Jesus told
473.274	to help us understand the difference
478.68	between those who'd rather not be bothered
478.68	and those who take care of the other.
487.2	I am sure you have heard it before.
487.2	It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
493.92	When Jesus was asked:
493.92	"""Who is my neighbor?"" -"
498	"namely, ""Who should I take care of?"" -"
502.84	he told this story, the story of a man
506.881	who had been assaulted, robbed,
506.881	beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.
514.16	Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
514.16	two very influential people of the time,
521	walked past him without stopping to help.
525.4	After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
525.4	despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.
532.593	Seeing the injured man
532.593	lying on the ground,
538	he did not ignore him
538	as if he weren't even there.
543.392	Instead, he felt compassion for this man,
547.595	which compelled him to act
547.595	in a very concrete manner.
556.04	He poured oil and wine
556.04	on the wounds of the helpless man,
560.872	brought him to a hostel
562.8	and paid out of his pocket
562.8	for him to be assisted.
567.72	The story of the Good Samaritan
567.72	is the story of today’s humanity.
572.56	People's paths are riddled with suffering,
577.52	as everything is centered around money,
577.52	and things, instead of people.
584.76	And often there is this habit, by people
584.76	"who call themselves ""respectable,"""
590.48	of not taking care of the others,
593.702	thus leaving behind thousands
593.702	of human beings, or entire populations,
600.892	on the side of the road.
605.44	Fortunately, there are also those
605.44	who are creating a new world
610.092	by taking care of the other,
610.092	even out of their own pockets.
616.28	Mother Teresa actually said:
620.265	"""One cannot love,"
620.265	"unless it is at their own expense."""
626.96	We have so much to do,
626.96	and we must do it together.
632.92	But how can we do that
632.92	with all the evil we breathe every day?
638.777	Thank God,
640.252	no system can nullify our desire
640.252	to open up to the good,
644.61	to compassion and to our capacity
644.61	to react against evil,
648.653	all of which stem
648.653	from deep within our hearts.
651.113	Now you might tell me,
652.561	"""Sure, these are beautiful words,"
654.28	but I am not the Good Samaritan,
654.28	"nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta."""
659.653	On the contrary: we are precious,
659.653	each and every one of us.
664.481	Each and every one of us
664.481	is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.
670.8	Through the darkness of today's conflicts,
675.08	each and every one of us
675.08	can become a bright candle,
679.64	a reminder that light
679.64	will overcome darkness,
684.72	and never the other way around.
688.377	To Christians,
688.377	the future does have a name,
693.697	and its name is Hope.
697.04	Feeling hopeful does not mean
697.04	to be optimistically naïve
702.92	and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.
709.76	Hope is the virtue of a heart
712.76	that doesn't lock itself into darkness,
712.76	that doesn't dwell on the past,
717.84	does not simply get by in the present,
717.84	but is able to see a tomorrow.
724.32	Hope is the door
724.32	that opens onto the future.
727	Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life
732.28	that, with time,
732.28	will develop into a large tree.
737.6	It is like some invisible yeast
737.6	that allows the whole dough to grow,
743.8	that brings flavor to all aspects of life.
747.04	And it can do so much,
749.76	because a tiny flicker of light
749.76	that feeds on hope
757.351	is enough to shatter
757.351	the shield of darkness.
762.537	A single individual
762.537	is enough for hope to exist,
767.24	and that individual can be you.
771.8	"And then there will be another ""you,"""
771.8	"and another ""you,"""
778.102	"and it turns into an ""us."""
781.058	And so, does hope begin
781.058	"when we have an ""us?"""
785.339	No.
786.507	"Hope began with one ""you."""
789.4	"When there is an ""us,"""
789.4	there begins a revolution.
797.06	The third message
797.06	I would like to share today
800.52	is, indeed, about revolution:
800.52	the revolution of tenderness.
807.04	And what is tenderness?
809.8	It is the love that comes close
809.8	and becomes real.
813	It is a movement
813	that starts from our heart
815.2	and reaches the eyes,
815.2	the ears and the hands.
819.4	Tenderness means to use
819.4	our eyes to see the other,
824.36	our ears to hear the other,
827.165	to listen to the children, the poor,
827.165	those who are afraid of the future.
833.473	To listen also to the silent cry
833.473	of our common home,
839.24	of our sick and polluted earth.
842.56	Tenderness means to use
842.56	our hands and our heart
848.28	to comfort the other,
851.08	to take care of those in need.
854.72	Tenderness is the language
854.72	of the young children,
859.931	of those who need the other.
863.436	A child’s love for mom and dad
868.8	grows through their touch, their gaze,
868.8	their voice, their tenderness.
876.56	I like when I hear parents
878.88	talk to their babies,
878.88	adapting to the little child,
885.16	sharing the same level of communication.
893.16	This is tenderness:
893.16	being on the same level as the other.
899.92	God himself descended into Jesus
899.92	to be on our level.
907.36	This is the same path
907.36	the Good Samaritan took.
911.08	This is the path that Jesus himself took.
914.92	He lowered himself,
916.64	he lived his entire human existence
919.2	practicing the real,
919.2	concrete language of love.
924.12	Yes, tenderness is the path of choice
927.6	for the strongest,
927.6	most courageous men and women.
934.8	Tenderness is not weakness;
934.8	it is fortitude.
938.92	It is the path of solidarity,
938.92	the path of humility.
944.72	Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:
947.84	the more powerful you are,
950.52	the more your actions
950.52	will have an impact on people,
955.28	the more responsible you are
955.28	to act humbly.
960.2	If you don’t, your power will ruin you,
960.2	and you will ruin the other.
969.68	There is a saying in Argentina:
971.927	"""Power is like drinking gin"
971.927	"on an empty stomach."""
979.56	You feel dizzy, you get drunk,
979.56	you lose your balance,
986.72	and you will end up hurting yourself
986.72	and those around you,
992.2	if you don’t connect your power
992.2	with humility and tenderness.
999.4	Through humility and concrete love,
999.4	on the other hand,
1004.112	power – the highest, the strongest one –
1004.112	becomes a service, a force for good.
1013.56	The future of humankind isn't exclusively
1013.56	in the hands of politicians,
1019.16	of great leaders, of big companies.
1023.28	Yes, they do hold
1023.28	an enormous responsibility.
1026.08	But the future is, most of all,
1026.08	in the hands of those people
1030.92	"who recognize the other as a ""you"""
1034.906	"and themselves as part of an ""us."""
1039.839	We all need each other.
1042.839	And so, please, think of me
1042.839	as well with tenderness,
1047.973	so that I can fulfill the task
1047.973	I have been given
1051.371	for the good of the other,
1053.818	of each and every one, of all of you,
1057.559	of all of us.
1059.9	Thank you.
