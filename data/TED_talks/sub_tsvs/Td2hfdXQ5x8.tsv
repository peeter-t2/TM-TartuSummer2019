13.957	Let me tell you a story
15.518	about a little girl named Naghma.
18.724	Naghma lived in a refugee camp
20.546	with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.
23.425	Every morning, her father would wake up
25.361	in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,
27.801	and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.
31.367	The winter was very harsh,
32.755	and unfortunately, Naghma's brother died
35.439	and her mother became very ill.
37.359	In desperation, her father went to a neighbor
39.939	to borrow 2,500 dollars.
42.336	After several months of waiting,
44.25	the neighbor became very impatient,
45.767	and he demanded that he be paid back.
48.485	Unfortunately, Naghma's
48.485	father didn't have the money,
50.929	and so the two men agreed to a jirga.
53.764	So simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation
56.294	that's used in Afghanistan's 
56.294	informal justice system.
59.534	It's usually presided over by religious leaders
62.988	and village elders,
64.686	and jirgas are often used in
64.686	rural countries like Afghanistan,
67.886	where there's deep-seated resentment
69.737	against the formal system.
71.999	At the jirga, the men sat together
74.337	and they decided that the 
74.337	best way to satisfy the debt
77.251	would be if Naghma married
77.251	the neighbor's 21-year-old son.
81.84	She was six.
84.5	Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately
86.565	are all too common,
88.253	and from the comforts of our home,
89.748	we may look at these stories as another
91.503	crushing blow to women's rights.
93.763	And if you watched Afghanistan on the news,
96.294	you may have this view that it's a failed state.
99.993	However, Afghanistan does have a legal system,
103.809	and while jirgas are built on
103.809	long-standing tribal customs,
107.671	even in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,
111.034	and it goes without saying
112.962	that giving a child to satisfy a debt
115.583	is not only grossly immoral, it's illegal.
119.649	In 2008, I went to Afghanistan
122.176	for a justice funded program,
124.496	and I went there originally 
124.496	on this nine-month program
127.203	to train Afghan lawyers.
129.115	In that nine months, I went around the country
131.376	and I talked to hundreds of
131.376	people that were locked up,
134.312	and I talked to many businesses
135.91	that were also operating in Afghanistan.
138.44	And within these conversations,
139.784	I started hearing the connections
141.655	between the businesses and the people,
143.645	and how laws that were meant to protect them
145.715	were being underused,
147.416	while gross and illegal punitive
147.416	measures were overused.
151.474	And so this put me on a quest for justness,
154.298	and what justness means to me
157.02	is using laws for their intended purpose,
160.715	which is to protect.
163.04	The role of laws is to protect.
166.543	So as a result, I decided to 
166.543	open up a private practice,
170.258	and I became the first foreigner to litigate
172.599	in Afghan courts.
174.815	Throughout this time, I also studied many laws,
177.672	I talked to many people,
179.202	I read up on many cases,
180.373	and I found that the lack of justness
182.763	is not just a problem in Afghanistan,
184.749	but it's a global problem.
187.07	And while I originally shied away from
188.821	representing human rights cases
190.938	because I was really concerned about how it would
193.117	affect me both professionally and personally,
195.76	I decided that the need for justness was so great
198.513	that I couldn't continue to ignore it.
200.384	And so I started representing people like Naghma
202.701	pro bono also.
205.157	Now, since I've been in Afghanistan
206.863	and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,
209.326	I've represented from CEOs 
209.326	of Fortune 500 companies
213.04	to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,
215.368	and with much success.
216.918	And the reason for my success is very simple:
219.833	I work the system from the inside out
221.843	and use the laws in the ways
223.262	that they're intended to be used.
225.998	I find that
228.12	achieving justness in places like Afghanistan
231.536	is difficult, and there's three reasons.
233.684	The first reason is that simply put,
236.24	people are very uneducated as
236.24	to what their legal rights were,
239.339	and I find that this is a global problem.
241.93	The second issue
243.144	is that even with laws on the books,
246.583	it's often superseded or ignored
248.848	by tribal customs, like in the first jirga
251.17	that sold Naghma off.
252.702	And the third problem with achieving justness
255.404	is that even with good, existing laws on the books,
258.216	there aren't people or lawyers 
258.216	that are willing to fight
260.862	for those laws.
262.558	And that's what I do: I use existing laws,
265.432	often unused laws,
267.231	and I work those to the benefits of my clients.
270.865	We all need to create a global culture
273.413	of human rights
275.241	and be investors in a global 
275.241	human rights economy,
277.99	and by working in this mindset,
279.757	we can significantly improve justice globally.
282.474	Now let's get back to Naghma.
284.866	Several people heard about this story,
287.265	and so they contacted me because they wanted
288.79	to pay the $2,500 debt.
291.355	And it's not just that simple;
293.216	you can't just throw money at this problem
294.998	and think that it's going to disappear.
296.151	That's not how it works in Afghanistan.
298.632	So I told them I'd get involved,
302.03	but in order to get involved, 
302.03	what needed to happen
304.318	is a second jirga needed to be called,
307.141	a jirga of appeals.
309.25	And so in order for that to happen,
311.501	we needed to get the village elders together,
314.206	we needed to get the tribal leaders together,
316.467	the religious leaders.
318.056	Naghma's father needed to agree,
319.63	the neighbor needed to agree,
320.881	and also his son needed to agree.
323.085	And I thought, if I'm going to 
323.085	get involved in this thing,
327.11	then they also need to agree 
327.11	that I preside over it.
330.765	So, after hours of talking
333.735	and tracking them down,
334.943	and about 30 cups of tea,
337.806	they finally agreed that we could sit down
339.718	for a second jirga, and we did.
343.05	And what was different about the second jirga
345.134	is this time, we put the law at the center of it,
347.709	and it was very important for me
349.053	that they all understood that Naghma
350.811	had a right to be protected.
353.15	And at the end of this jirga,
354.696	it was ordered by the judge
356.989	that the first decision was erased,
360.825	and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,
364.257	and we all signed a written order
366.09	where all the men acknowledged
367.481	that what they did was illegal,
369.601	and if they did it again, that 
369.601	they would go to prison.
374.399	Most —
376.168	(Applause)
377.636	Thanks.
379.483	And most importantly,
381.299	the engagement was terminated
382.8	and Naghma was free.
384.809	Protecting Naghma and her right to be free
387.666	protects us.
390.3	Now, with my job, there's above-average
393.762	amount of risks that are involved.
396.505	I've been temporarily detained.
399.212	I've been accused of running a brothel,
401.805	accused of being a spy.
404.11	I've had a grenade thrown at my office.
406.238	It didn't go off, though.
408.937	But I find that with my job,
410.537	that the rewards far outweigh the risks,
413.503	and as many risks as I take,
415.877	my clients take far greater risks,
417.846	because they have a lot more to lose
419.349	if their cases go unheard,
420.839	or worse, if they're penalized
420.839	for having me as their lawyer.
423.962	With every case that I take,
425.736	I realize that as much as
425.736	I'm standing behind my clients,
428.656	that they're also standing behind me,
430.669	and that's what keeps me going.
434.462	Law as a point of leverage
436.359	is crucial in protecting all of us.
438.881	Journalists are very vital in making sure
441.517	that that information is given to the public.
444.791	Too often, we receive information from journalists
447.277	but we forget how that information was given.
450.921	This picture is a picture of the
453.507	British press corps in Afghanistan.
455.5	It was taken a couple of years
455.5	ago by my friend David Gill.
458.649	According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,
460.517	since 2010, there have been 
460.517	thousands of journalists
463.363	who have been threatened, injured,
465.241	killed, detained.
467.873	Too often, when we get this information,
470.112	we forget who it affects
471.336	or how that information is given to us.
474.634	What many journalists do, 
474.634	both foreign and domestic,
477.244	is very remarkable, especially
477.244	in places like Afghanistan,
481.315	and it's important that we never forget that,
482.887	because what they're protecting
484.243	is not only our right to receive that information
486.525	but also the freedom of the press, which is vital
488.582	to a democratic society.
491.458	Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.
495.343	He works for The New York Times,
497.233	and unfortunately, a few months ago
498.85	he wrote an article that displeased
500.99	people in the government.
502.296	As a result, he was temporarily detained
505.546	and he was illegally exiled out of the country.
509.859	I represent Matt,
511.911	and after dealing with the government,
514.039	I was able to get legal acknowledgment
515.719	that in fact he was illegally exiled,
518.78	and that freedom of the
518.78	press does exist in Afghanistan,
521.84	and there's consequences if that's not followed.
524.372	And I'm happy to say that
526.118	as of a few days ago,
528.206	the Afghan government
529.532	formally invited him back into the country
531.744	and they reversed their exile order of him.
535.377	(Applause)
540.049	If you censor one journalist, 
540.049	then it intimidates others,
543.252	and soon nations are silenced.
545.224	It's important that we protect our journalists
547.942	and freedom of the press,
549.719	because that makes governments
549.719	more accountable to us
551.778	and more transparent.
553.763	Protecting journalists and our right
555.67	to receive information protects us.
559.844	Our world is changing. We live
559.844	in a different world now,
562.86	and what were once individual problems
565.243	are really now global problems for all of us.
568.061	Two weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first
571.7	democratic transfer of power
573.691	and elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,
576.943	and I'm very optimistic about him,
579.44	and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan
581.419	the changes that it needs,
582.69	especially within the legal sector.
585.187	We live in a different world.
587.09	We live in a world where my 
587.09	eight-year-old daughter
589.439	only knows a black president.
592.153	There's a great possibility that our next president
594.861	will be a woman,
596.197	and as she gets older, she may question,
599.1	can a white guy be president?
600.845	(Laughter)
602.619	(Applause)
605.73	Our world is changing, and 
605.73	we need to change with it,
608.91	and what were once individual problems
610.542	are problems for all of us.
613.39	According to UNICEF,
615.468	there are currently over 280 million
621.509	boys and girls who are married
623.394	under the age of 15.
625.176	Two hundred and eighty million.
627.219	Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle
629.761	of poverty, poor health, lack of education.
634.181	At the age of 12, Sahar was married.
638.868	She was forced into this marriage
640.717	and sold by her brother.
642.417	When she went to her in-laws' house,
644.485	they forced her into prostitution.
647.173	Because she refused, she was tortured.
650.986	She was severely beaten with metal rods.
655.011	They burned her body.
657.803	They tied her up in a basement and starved her.
661.293	They used pliers to take out her fingernails.
665.503	At one point,
667.332	she managed to escape from this torture chamber
670.537	to a neighbor's house,
672.91	and when she went there, instead of protecting her,
676.206	they dragged her back
678.221	to her husband's house,
679.857	and she was tortured even worse.
685.864	When I met first Sahar, thankfully,
688.975	Women for Afghan Women
690.206	gave her a safe haven to go to.
693.534	As a lawyer, I try to be very strong
696.72	for all my clients,
698.379	because that's very important to me,
702.193	but seeing her,
705.122	how broken and very weak as she was,
709.024	was very difficult.
712.321	It took weeks for us to really get to
715.808	what happened to her
719.164	when she was in that house,
721.12	but finally she started opening up to me,
723.76	and when she opened up,
726.08	what I heard was
727.552	she didn't know what her rights were,
730.152	but she did know she had 
730.152	a certain level of protection
732.355	by her government that failed her,
734.982	and so we were able to talk about
736.584	what her legal options were.
739.126	And so we decided to take this case
741.134	to the Supreme Court.
742.89	Now, this is extremely significant,
744.76	because this is the first time
746.673	that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan
749.509	was being represented by a lawyer,
752.302	a law that's been on the 
752.302	books for years and years,
755.037	but until Sahar, had never been used.
758.443	In addition to this, we also decided
760.655	to sue for civil damages,
762.378	again using a law that's never been used,
765.325	but we used it for her case.
768.353	So there we were at the Supreme Court
770.615	arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,
773.857	me as an American female lawyer,
776.493	and Sahar, a young woman
779.98	who when I met her couldn't 
779.98	speak above a whisper.
785.163	She stood up,
786.834	she found her voice,
789.12	and my girl told them that she wanted justice,
791.917	and she got it.
794.556	At the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed
797.385	that her in-laws should be
797.385	arrested for what they did to her,
801.568	her fucking brother should also be arrested
804.177	for selling her —
806.123	(Applause) —
810.543	and they agreed that she did have a right
812.546	to civil compensation.
814.964	What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack
817.743	existing bad practices by using the laws
820.521	in the ways that they're intended to be used,
823.459	and by protecting Sahar,
825.94	we are protecting ourselves.
829.52	After having worked in Afghanistan
831.152	for over six years now,
833.15	a lot of my family and friends think
835.201	that what I do looks like this.
837.993	(Laughter)
840.499	But in all actuality, what I do looks like this.
845.137	Now, we can all do something.
847.01	I'm not saying we should all buy a
847.01	plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,
849.79	but we can all be contributors
852.812	to a global human rights economy.
854.871	We can create a culture of transparency
857.139	and accountability to the laws,
858.463	and make governments more accountable to us,
860.874	as we are to them.
863.897	A few months ago, a South African lawyer
865.889	visited me in my office
867.644	"and he said, ""I wanted to meet you."
869.569	"I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."""
873.563	The laws are ours,
875.542	and no matter what your ethnicity,
877.575	nationality, gender, race,
880.466	they belong to us,
882.585	and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.
887.374	Businesses also need to get with the program.
889.615	A corporate investment in human rights
891.336	is a capital gain on your businesses,
893.214	and whether you're a business, an NGO,
895.34	or a private citizen, rule 
895.34	of law benefits all of us.
899.435	And by working together with a concerted mindset,
901.75	through the people, public and private sector,
905.206	we can create a global human rights economy
907.503	and all become global investors in human rights.
911.036	And by doing this,
912.82	we can achieve justness together.
915.48	Thank you.
917.573	(Applause)
