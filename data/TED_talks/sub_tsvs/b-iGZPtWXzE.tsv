15.482	Running: it's basically just
15.482	right, left, right, left, yeah?
18.855	I mean, we've been doing it
18.855	for two million years,
21.308	so it's kind of arrogant to assume
21.308	that I've got something to say
24.878	that hasn't been said and performed
24.878	better a long time ago.
28.494	But the cool thing about running,
28.494	as I've discovered,
31.076	is that something bizarre happens
31.076	in this activity all the time.
34.685	Case in point: A couple months ago,
34.685	if you saw the New York City Marathon,
38.284	I guarantee you, you saw something
38.284	that no one has ever seen before.
42.487	An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
42.487	turns up at the starting line.
47.022	She's 37 years old.
48.398	She hasn't won a marathon
48.398	of any kind in eight years,
51.108	and a few months previously,
52.56	she had almost died in childbirth.
54.56	Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up
54.56	and retire from the sport,
58.075	but she decided she'd go for broke
59.971	and try for one last big payday
59.971	in the marquee event,
63.783	the New York City Marathon.
65.422	Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --
65.422	some other people had the same idea,
69.16	including the Olympic gold medalist,
71.038	and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,
74.16	the fastest woman marathoner
74.16	in history by far.
77.756	Only 10 minutes
77.756	off the men's world record,
80.057	Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.
83.603	That's her competition.
85.16	The gun goes off, and -- I mean,
85.16	she's not even an underdog;
88.132	she's, like, under the underdogs.
89.971	But the under-underdog hangs tough,
92.04	and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,
94.875	there is Derartu Tulu,
94.875	up there with the lead pack.
98.564	Now, this is when something
98.564	really bizarre happens.
101.279	Paula Radcliffe, the one person
101.279	who is sure to snatch the big paycheck
105.065	from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,
108.16	suddenly grabs her leg
108.16	and starts to fall back.
110.581	So we all know what to do
110.581	in this situation, right?
113.016	You give her a quick crack
113.016	in the teeth with your elbow
115.726	and blaze for the finish line.
117.549	Derartu Tulu ruins the script.
119.763	Instead of taking off,
121.236	she falls back and she grabs
121.236	Paula Radcliffe,
123.509	"and says, ""Come on."
123.509	"Come with us. You can do it."""
125.871	So Paula Radcliffe,
125.871	unfortunately, does it.
128.306	She catches up with the lead pack
129.943	and is pushing toward the finish line.
131.83	But then she falls back again.
133.373	The second time, Derartu Tulu
133.373	grabs her and tries to pull her.
136.389	And Paula Radcliffe, at that point,
136.389	"says, ""I'm done. Go."""
139.771	So that's a fantastic story,
139.771	and we all know how it ends.
142.551	She loses the check,
143.865	but she goes home with something
143.865	bigger and more important.
146.814	Except Derartu Tulu
146.814	ruins the script again.
149.334	Instead of losing, she blazes
149.334	past the lead pack and wins.
152.858	Wins the New York City Marathon,
154.544	goes home with a big fat check.
156.937	It's a heartwarming story,
158.497	but if you drill a little bit deeper,
160.498	you've got to sort of wonder
160.498	about what exactly was going on there.
163.93	When you have two outliers
163.93	in one organism,
166.089	it's not a coincidence.
167.487	When you have someone who is more
167.487	competitive and more compassionate
171.002	than anybody else in the race,
171.002	again, it's not a coincidence.
174.003	You show me a creature
174.003	with webbed feet and gills;
176.47	somehow water's involved.
178.142	Someone with that kind of heart,
178.142	there's some kind of connection there.
181.548	And the answer to it,
181.548	I think, can be found
184.139	down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,
186.572	where there's a reclusive tribe,
186.572	called the Tarahumara Indians.
190.473	Now, the Tarahumara
190.473	are remarkable for three things.
194.056	Number one is:
195.555	they have been living essentially
195.555	unchanged for the past 400 years.
199.785	When the conquistadors arrived
199.785	in North America you had two choices:
203.423	you either fight back and engage
203.423	or you could take off.
206.16	The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,
208.042	which is why there are very few
208.042	Mayans and Aztecs.
210.512	The Tarahumara had a different strategy.
212.521	They took off and hid
214.409	in this labyrinthine, networking,
214.409	spider-webbing system of canyons
219.288	called the Copper Canyons.
220.713	And there they've remained
220.713	since the 1600s,
224.16	essentially the same way
224.16	they've always been.
227.581	The second thing remarkable
227.581	about the Tarahumara is:
230.762	deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --
233.914	these guys aren't running marathons;
235.915	they're running mega-marathons.
237.786	They're not doing 26 miles,
239.455	they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,
242.101	and apparently without injury,
242.101	without problems.
245.216	The last thing that's remarkable
245.216	about the Tarahumara is:
247.956	all the things we're going
247.956	to be talking about today,
250.497	all the things we're trying to use
250.497	all of our technology
253.326	and brain power to solve --
254.688	things like heart disease
254.688	and cholesterol and cancer;
257.262	crime, warfare and violence;
257.262	clinical depression -- all this stuff --
260.884	the Tarahumara don't know
260.884	what you're talking about.
263.38	They are free from all
263.38	of these modern ailments.
267.988	So what's the connection?
269.241	Again, we're talking about outliers;
271.003	there's got to be some kind
271.003	of cause and effect.
273.318	Well, there are teams of scientists
273.318	at Harvard and the University of Utah
277.16	that are bending their brains
277.16	and trying to figure out
279.764	what the Tarahumara have known forever.
281.731	They're trying to solve
281.731	those same kinds of mysteries.
284.419	And once again, a mystery
284.419	wrapped inside of a mystery --
287.866	perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu
287.866	and the Tarahumara
291.009	is wrapped in three other
291.009	mysteries, which go like this:
293.67	Three things -- if you have the answer,
293.67	come up and take the microphone,
297.103	because nobody else knows the answer.
298.956	If you know it, you're smarter
298.956	than anybody on planet Earth.
301.865	Mystery number one is this:
303.312	Two million years ago,
303.312	the human brain exploded in size.
306.09	Australopithecus
306.09	had a tiny little pea brain.
308.225	Suddenly humans show up,
308.225	Homo erectus, big old melon head.
311.295	To have a brain of that size,
312.842	you need to have a source
312.842	of condensed caloric energy.
316.469	In other words, early humans
316.469	are eating dead animals --
319.114	no argument, that's a fact.
321.16	The only problem is,
322.401	the first edged weapons only appeared
322.401	about 200,000 years ago.
326.015	So somehow, for nearly two million years,
328.734	we are killing animals
328.734	without any weapons.
331.429	Now, we're not using our strength,
333.153	because we are the biggest
333.153	sissies in the jungle.
335.535	Every other animal
335.535	is stronger than we are,
337.601	they have fangs, they have claws,
337.601	they have nimbleness, they have speed.
341.055	We think Usain Bolt is fast.
342.45	Usain Bolt can get
342.45	his ass kicked by a squirrel.
344.818	We're not fast.
345.993	That would be an Olympic event:
347.508	turn a squirrel loose,
347.508	whoever catches it gets a gold medal.
350.369	(Laughter)
351.408	So no weapons, no speed,
351.408	no strength, no fangs, no claws.
354.15	How were we killing these animals?
354.15	Mystery number one.
356.816	Mystery number two:
358.281	Women have been in the Olympics
358.281	for quite some time now,
361.358	but one thing that's remarkable
361.358	about all women sprinters:
364.19	they all suck; they're terrible.
365.969	There's not a fast woman on the planet
365.969	and there never has been.
369.721	The fastest woman
369.721	to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.
372.722	I could throw a rock
372.722	and hit a high-school boy
374.964	who can run faster than 4:15.
376.484	For some reason,
376.484	you guys are just really slow.
378.699	But --
379.881	(Laughter)
380.964	But, you get to the marathon
380.964	we were just talking about --
383.734	you've only been allowed to run
383.734	the marathon for 20 years,
386.536	because prior to the 1980s,
386.536	medical science said
388.831	if a woman tried to run 26 miles --
388.831	does anyone know what would happen
392.219	if you tried to run 26 miles?
393.676	Why you were banned
393.676	from the marathon before the 1980s?
396.316	Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn.
398.426	Christopher McDougall:
398.426	Her uterus would be torn, yes.
400.978	Torn reproductive organs.
402.242	The uterus would literally
402.242	fall out of the body.
404.525	(Laughter)
405.57	Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,
407.413	and I've yet to see any ...
409.078	(Laughter)
412.011	So it's only been 20 years
413.402	that women have been allowed
413.402	to run the marathon.
415.805	In that very short learning curve,
415.805	you've gone from broken organs
419.85	up to the fact that you're only 10 minutes
419.85	off the male world record.
423.675	Then you go beyond 26 miles,
423.675	into the distance
426.004	that medical science also told us
426.004	would be fatal to humans --
428.961	remember Pheidippides died
428.961	when he ran 26 miles --
431.351	you get to 50 and 100 miles,
431.351	and suddenly, it's a different game.
434.643	You take a runner like Ann Trason
434.643	or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,
437.91	put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles
437.91	against anybody in the world,
441.361	and it's a coin toss who's going to win.
443.362	I'll give you an example.
444.732	A couple years ago,
444.732	Emily Baer signed up for a race
447.271	called the Hardrock 100,
448.985	which tells you all you need
448.985	to know about the race.
451.571	They give you 48 hours
451.571	to finish this race.
453.634	Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --
455.563	she finishes in eighth place,
455.563	in the top 10,
457.934	even though she stopped
457.934	at all the aid stations
460.212	to breastfeed her baby during the race.
462.131	(Laughter)
463.169	And yet, she beat 492 other people.
465.391	The last mystery:
466.572	Why is it that women get stronger
466.572	as distances get longer?
469.38	The third mystery is this:
470.74	At the University of Utah,
470.74	they started tracking finishing times
474.232	for people running the marathon.
475.916	What they found is that if you start
475.916	running the marathon at age 19,
479.747	you'll get progressively
479.747	faster, year by year,
482.024	until you reach your peak at age 27.
484.025	And then after that,
484.025	you succumb to the rigors of time.
488.025	And you'll get slower and slower,
489.641	until eventually you're back to running
489.641	the same speed you were at age 19.
493.254	So about seven, eight years
493.254	to reach your peak,
495.519	and then gradually you fall off your peak,
497.619	until you go back to the starting point.
499.921	You'd think it might take eight years
499.921	to go back to the same speed,
503.165	maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.
507.922	are running as fast
507.922	as they were at age 19.
510.985	Now, I defy you to come
510.985	up with any other physical activity --
513.997	and please don't say golf --
513.997	something that's actually hard --
516.983	(Laughter)
518.055	where geriatrics are performing
518.055	as well as they did as teenagers.
522.626	So you have these three mysteries.
524.921	Is there one piece in the puzzle
524.921	which might wrap all these things up?
529.201	You've got to be careful anytime
529.201	someone looks back in prehistory
532.313	and tries to give you
532.313	a global answer because,
534.643	it being prehistory, you can say
534.643	whatever the hell you want
537.454	and get away with it.
538.637	But I'll submit this to you:
540.027	If you put one piece in the middle
540.027	of this jigsaw puzzle,
542.752	suddenly it all starts
542.752	to form a coherent picture.
545.154	If you're wondering
545.154	why the Tarahumara don't fight
547.566	and don't die of heart disease,
549.114	why a poor Ethiopian
549.114	woman named Derartu Tulu
551.898	can be the most compassionate
551.898	and yet the most competitive,
554.751	and why we somehow were able
554.751	to find food without weapons,
558.598	perhaps it's because humans,
560.599	as much as we like to think of ourselves
560.599	as masters of the universe,
563.845	actually evolved as nothing more
563.845	than a pack of hunting dogs.
567.668	Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.
571.493	Because the one advantage
571.493	we have in the wilderness --
574.093	again, it's not our fangs,
574.093	our claws or our speed --
576.573	the only thing we do really well is sweat.
578.922	We're really good
578.922	at being sweaty and smelly.
581.724	Better than any other mammal
581.724	on Earth, we can sweat really well.
584.986	But the advantage of that little bit
584.986	of social discomfort
588.874	is the fact that, when it comes to running
588.874	under hot heat for long distances,
594.005	we're superb -- the best on the planet.
596.273	You take a horse on a hot day,
598.382	and after about five or six miles,
598.382	that horse has a choice:
601.294	it's either going to breathe
601.294	or it's going to cool off.
603.971	But it ain't doing both. We can.
605.938	So what if we evolved
605.938	as hunting pack animals?
608.939	What if the only natural advantage
608.939	we had in the world
612.588	was the fact that we could
612.588	get together as a group,
615.009	go out there on that African savanna,
615.009	pick out an antelope,
618.021	go out as a pack,
618.021	and run that thing to death?
621.276	That's all we could do.
622.756	We could run really far on a hot day.
624.757	Well, if that's true, a couple
624.757	other things had to be true as well.
627.981	The key to being part
627.981	"of a hunting pack is the word ""pack."""
630.834	If you go out by yourself
630.834	and try to chase an antelope,
633.466	I guarantee there will be two cadavers
633.466	out in the savanna.
636.347	You need a pack to pull together.
638.014	You need to have
638.014	those 64- and 65-year-olds
640.266	who have been doing this for a long time
642.269	to understand which antelope
642.269	you're trying to catch.
644.785	The herd explodes
644.785	and it gathers back again.
646.91	Those expert trackers
646.91	have to be part of the pack.
649.302	They can't be 10 miles behind.
650.79	You need the women
650.79	and the adolescents there,
652.998	because the two times in your life
652.998	you most benefit from animal protein
656.414	is when you're a nursing mother
656.414	and a developing adolescent.
659.309	It makes no sense to have
659.309	the antelope over there, dead,
661.983	and the people who want
661.983	to eat it 50 miles away.
664.26	They need to be part of the pack.
665.867	You need those 27-year-old studs
665.867	at the peak of their powers
668.728	ready to drop the kill,
669.908	and you need those teenagers
669.908	who are learning the whole thing involved.
673.363	The pack stays together.
674.543	Another thing that has to be true:
674.543	this pack cannot be materialistic.
677.923	You can't be hauling all your crap around,
677.923	trying to chase the antelope.
681.376	You can't be a pissed-off pack.
682.886	You can't be bearing grudges, like,
682.886	"""I'm not chasing that guy's antelope."
686.349	He pissed me off.
686.349	"Let him go chase his own antelope."""
688.895	The pack has got to be able
688.895	to swallow its ego,
691.16	be cooperative, and pull together.
693.279	What you end up with, in other words,
695.931	is a culture remarkably similar
695.931	to the Tarahumara,
699.728	a tribe that has remained
699.728	unchanged since the Stone Age.
703.944	It's a really compelling argument
705.595	that maybe the Tarahumara are doing
705.595	exactly what all of us had done
709.267	for two million years,
710.449	that it's us in modern times
710.449	who have sort of gone off the path.
713.517	You know, we look at running
713.517	as this kind of alien, foreign thing,
716.822	this punishment you've got to do
716.822	because you ate pizza the night before.
720.315	But maybe it's something different.
722.031	Maybe we're the ones who have taken
722.031	this natural advantage we had
725.152	and we spoiled it.
727.064	How do we spoil it?
727.064	Well, how do we spoil anything?
729.632	We try to cash in on it. Right?
731.22	We try to can it and package it
731.22	"and make it ""better"""
734.01	and then sell it to people.
735.423	And then what happened was,
735.423	we started creating
737.941	these fancy cushioned things
737.941	"which can make running ""better,"""
741.399	called running shoes.
742.839	The reason I get personally
742.839	pissed-off about running shoes
745.795	is because I bought a million of them
745.795	and I kept getting hurt.
748.796	And I think if anybody in here runs --
750.797	I just had a conversation with Carol.
752.601	We talked for two minutes backstage,
752.601	and she talked about plantar fasciitis.
756.256	You talk to a runner,
756.256	I guarantee within 30 seconds,
758.831	the conversation turns to injury.
760.484	So if humans evolved as runners,
760.484	if that's our one natural advantage,
763.795	then why are we so bad at it?
765.292	Why do we keep getting hurt?
766.927	A curious thing about running
766.927	and running injuries
769.323	is that the running injury
769.323	is new to our time.
771.835	If you read folklore and mythology,
773.683	any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,
775.708	running is always associated
775.708	with freedom and vitality
779.34	and youthfulness and eternal vigor.
781.16	It's only in our lifetime
781.16	that running has become associated
784.078	with fear and pain.
785.257	"Geronimo used to say, ""My only friends"
785.257	"are my legs. I only trust my legs."""
789.392	That's because an Apache triathlon
789.392	used to be you'd run 50 miles
793.035	across the desert,
794.21	engage in hand-to-hand combat,
794.21	steal a bunch of horses,
796.846	and slap leather for home.
798.2	"Geronimo was never saying, ""You know"
798.2	something, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.
801.949	"I've got to take this week off."""
803.533	"Or, ""I need to cross-train."
803.533	"I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."""
806.574	(Laughter)
808.001	Humans ran and ran all the time.
809.85	We are here today.
809.85	We have our digital technology.
812.371	All of our science comes from the fact
814.306	that our ancestors were able to do
814.306	something extraordinary every day,
818.16	which was just rely
818.16	on their naked feet and legs
820.613	to run long distances.
822.083	So how do we get back to that again?
823.906	Well, I would submit
823.906	to you the first thing is:
826.142	get rid of all packaging,
826.142	all the sales, all the marketing.
828.991	Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.
831.087	Stop focusing on urban marathons,
833.064	which, if you do four hours, you suck,
835.884	and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,
837.861	because you qualified for another race.
840.16	We need to get back to that sense
840.16	of playfulness and joyfulness
843.184	and, I would say, nakedness,
846.078	that has made the Tarahumara
848.004	one of the healthiest and serene
848.004	cultures in our time.
851.384	So what's the benefit? So what?
853.029	So you burn off the Häagen-Dazs
853.029	from the night before.
855.922	But maybe there's another
855.922	benefit there as well.
858.368	Without getting too extreme about this,
861.525	imagine a world where everybody
861.525	could go out the door
866.16	and engage in the kind of exercise
868.16	that's going to make them
868.16	more relaxed, more serene,
871.16	more healthy,
872.489	burn off stress --
873.825	where you don't come back into your office
873.825	a raging maniac anymore,
877.038	or go home with a lot of stress
877.038	on top of you again.
879.546	Maybe there's something
879.546	between what we are today
881.901	and what the Tarahumara have always been.
884.433	I don't say let's go back
884.433	to the Copper Canyons
886.686	and live on corn and maize,
886.686	which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,
890.095	but maybe there's somewhere in between.
892.199	And if we find that thing,
893.89	maybe there is a big fat
893.89	Nobel Prize out there.
896.494	Because if somebody could find a way
896.494	to restore that natural ability
901.405	that we all enjoyed
901.405	for most of our existence
903.601	up until the 1970s or so,
905.196	the benefits -- social and physical
905.196	and political and mental --
910.611	could be astounding.
911.908	What I've been seeing today
911.908	is there is a growing subculture
916.001	of barefoot runners,
916.001	people who've gotten rid of their shoes.
918.944	And what they have found uniformly is,
920.854	you get rid of the shoes,
920.854	you get rid of the stress,
923.405	you get rid of the injuries
923.405	and the ailments.
925.897	And what you find is something
925.897	the Tarahumara have known
928.711	for a very long time:
929.9	that this can be a whole lot of fun.
931.686	I've experienced it personally myself.
933.537	I was injured all my life; then
933.537	in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes
936.917	and my running ailments
936.917	have gone away, too.
939.16	So hopefully it's something
939.16	we can all benefit from.
941.742	I appreciate your listening to this story.
943.808	Thanks very much.
944.983	(Applause)
