25.261	I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
27.944	I got to see the last case
27.944	of killer smallpox in the world.
33.182	I was in India this past year,
35.127	and I may have seen
35.127	the last cases of polio in the world.
40.395	There's nothing that makes
40.395	you feel more --
43.44	the blessing and the honor
43.44	of working in a program like that --
48.007	than to know that something
48.007	that horrible no longer exists.
52.401	So I'm going to tell you --
53.752	(Applause)
56.481	so I'm going to show you
56.481	some dirty pictures.
59.314	They are difficult to watch,
59.314	but you should look at them with optimism,
65.688	because the horror
65.688	of these pictures will be matched
70.783	by the uplifting quality of knowing
70.783	that they no longer exist.
75.839	But first, I'm going to tell you
75.839	a little bit about my own journey.
80.455	My background is not exactly
80.455	the conventional medical education
83.764	that you might expect.
86.23	When I was an intern in San Francisco,
91.163	I heard about a group of Native Americans
91.163	who had taken over Alcatraz Island,
94.999	and a Native American
94.999	who wanted to give birth on that island,
98	and no other doctor wanted
98	to go and help her give birth.
102.165	I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived
102.165	on the island for several weeks.
106.588	She gave birth; I caught
106.588	the baby; I got off the island;
109.333	I landed in San Francisco;
111.213	and all the press wanted to talk to me,
113.125	because my three weeks on the island
113.125	made me an expert in Indian affairs.
117.25	(Laughter)
118.278	I wound up on every television show.
120.341	Someone saw me on television;
120.341	they called me up; and they asked me
123.477	if I'd like to be in a movie
123.477	and to play a young doctor
126.106	for a bunch of rock and roll stars
126.106	who were traveling in a bus ride
129.28	from San Francisco to England.
131.378	And I said, yes, I would do that,
133	so I became the doctor
133	in an absolutely awful movie
137.28	"called ""Medicine Ball Caravan."""
139.202	(Laughter)
140.272	Now, you know from the '60s,
141.768	you're either on the bus
141.768	or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.
144.869	My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.
147.89	Our bus ride took us
147.89	from San Francisco to London,
150.594	then we switched buses at the big pond.
152.817	We then got on two more buses
156.269	and we drove through Turkey
156.269	and Iran, Afghanistan,
159.365	over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,
159.365	like every other young doctor.
163	This is us at the Khyber Pass,
163	and that's our bus.
165.691	We had some difficulty getting
165.691	over the Khyber Pass.
169.529	But we wound up in India.
171.465	And then, like everyone else
171.465	in our generation,
173.738	we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.
176.047	(Laughter)
179.42	This is just like a residency program,
181.255	for those of you
181.255	that are in medical school.
183.435	(Laughter)
185.092	And we studied with a wise man,
185.092	a guru named Karoli Baba,
190.316	who then told me to get rid of the dress,
193.982	put on a three-piece suit,
195.749	go join the United Nations as a diplomat
199.027	and work for the World
199.027	Health Organization.
201.111	And he made an outrageous prediction
201.111	that smallpox would be eradicated,
205.503	and that this was God's gift to humanity,
208.549	because of the hard work
208.549	of dedicated scientists.
211.66	And that prediction came true.
214.504	This little girl is Rahima Banu,
216.838	and she was the last case
216.838	of killer smallpox in the world.
220.232	And this document is the certificate
220.232	that the global commission signed,
225.232	certifying the world to have eradicated
225.232	the first disease in history.
231.336	The key to eradicating smallpox
231.336	was early detection, early response.
237.661	I'm going to ask you to repeat that:
237.661	early detection, early response.
241.692	Can you say that?
242.868	Audience: Early detection, early response.
245.962	Larry Brilliant: Smallpox
245.962	was the worst disease in history.
248.895	It killed more people
248.895	than all the wars in history.
251.437	In the last century,
251.437	it killed 500 million people.
257.943	You're reading about Larry Page already.
259.873	Somebody reads very fast.
261.469	(Laughter)
263.047	In the year that Larry Page
263.047	and Sergey Brin --
265.245	with whom I have a certain affection
265.245	and a new affiliation --
268.885	in the year in which they were born,
271.089	two million people died of smallpox.
274.059	We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.
278.76	This is the most important slide
278.76	that I've ever seen in public health,
282.08	[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]
282.08	because it shows you
284.588	to be the richest and the strongest,
286.483	and to be kings and queens of the world,
288.432	did not protect you
288.432	from dying of smallpox.
290.53	Never can you doubt
290.53	that we are all in this together.
295.469	But to see smallpox
295.469	from the perspective of a sovereign
299.403	is the wrong perspective.
301.302	You should see it
301.302	from the perspective of a mother,
304	watching her child develop
304	this disease and standing by helplessly.
307.841	Day one, day two, day three,
313.596	day four, day five, day six.
319.701	You're a mother and you're
319.701	watching your child,
322.638	and on day six, you see
322.638	pustules that become hard.
328.4	Day seven, they show the classic scars
328.4	of smallpox umbilication.
333.148	Day eight.
334.482	And Al Gore said earlier
336.234	that the most photographed
336.234	image in the world,
339.147	the most printed image in the world,
340.918	was that of the Earth.
342.516	But this was in 1974,
342.516	and as of that moment,
345.737	this photograph was the photograph
345.737	that was the most widely printed,
349.384	because we printed two billion copies
349.384	of this photograph,
352.893	and we took them
352.893	hand to hand, door to door,
356.071	to show people and ask them
356.071	if there was smallpox in their house,
360.976	because that was our surveillance system.
363.106	We didn't have Google,
363.106	we didn't have web crawlers,
365.685	we didn't have computers.
368.867	By day nine -- you look at this picture
368.867	and you're horrified;
372.748	I look at this picture
372.748	"and I say, ""Thank God,"""
375.305	because it's clear that this is only
375.305	an ordinary case of smallpox,
379.29	and I know this child will live.
382.487	And by day 13, the lesions
382.487	are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,
387.854	but you know this child has
387.854	no other secondary infection.
392.064	And by day 20, while he will be
392.064	scarred for life, he will live.
397.175	There are other kinds of smallpox
397.175	that are not like that.
400.248	This is confluent smallpox,
402.66	in which there isn't a single place
402.66	on the body where you could put a finger
406.469	and not be covered by lesions.
409.302	Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent
409.302	of people who got it.
413.612	And hemorrhagic smallpox,
413.612	the most cruel of all,
416.605	which had a predilection
416.605	for pregnant women.
419.897	I've probably had 50 women die.
422.31	They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.
424.436	I've never seen anybody die from it
424.436	who wasn't a pregnant woman.
428.458	In 1967, the WHO embarked
428.458	on what was an outrageous program
432.403	to eradicate a disease.
434.204	In that year, there were 34 countries
434.204	affected with smallpox.
438.363	By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.
444.848	But in that year,
444.848	smallpox exploded throughout India.
450.154	And India was the place
450.154	where smallpox made its last stand.
454.548	In 1974, India had
454.548	a population of 600 million.
457.611	There are 21 linguistic states in India,
460.653	which is like saying
463.242	There are 20 million people
463.242	on the road at any time,
466.163	in buses and trains, walking;
472.206	and none of them wanted to report
474.534	if they had a case
474.534	of smallpox in their house,
477	because they thought that smallpox
477	was the visitation of a deity,
480.388	Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,
482.435	and it was wrong to bring
482.435	strangers into your house
486.635	when the deity was in the house.
489.048	No incentive to report smallpox.
491.686	It wasn't just India
491.686	that had smallpox deities;
494.315	smallpox deities were
494.315	prevalent all over the world.
498	So, how we eradicated smallpox was --
501.436	mass vaccination wouldn't work.
503.734	You could vaccinate everybody in India,
505.661	but one year later there'd be
508.185	which was then the population of Canada.
510.693	It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.
512.905	You had to find every single
512.905	case of smallpox in the world
516	at the same time, and draw
516	a circle of immunity around it.
519.545	And that's what we did.
522.315	In India alone, my 150,000 best friends
522.315	and I went door to door,
527.534	with that same picture,
529.632	to every single house in India.
531.227	We made over one billion house calls.
534.541	And in the process,
534.541	I learned something very important.
538.763	Every time we did a house-to-house search,
543.045	we had a spike in the number
543.045	of reports of smallpox.
547.793	When we didn't search, we had
547.793	the illusion that there was no disease.
552.952	When we did search, we had the illusion
552.952	that there was more disease.
557.18	A surveillance system was necessary,
559.443	because what we needed
559.443	was early detection, early response.
566.722	So we searched and we searched,
568.945	and we found every case
568.945	of smallpox in India.
571.819	We had a reward. We raised the reward.
574.804	We continued to increase the reward.
576.884	We had a scorecard
576.884	that we wrote on every house.
580.426	And as we did that,
582.181	the number of reported cases
582.181	in the world dropped to zero.
586.963	And in 1980, we declared the globe
586.963	free of smallpox.
591.667	It was the largest campaign
591.667	in United Nations history,
596.196	until the Iraq war.
602	doctors of every race,
602	religion, culture and nation,
604.94	who fought side by side,
604.94	brothers and sisters,
609.859	with each other, not against each other,
613.121	in a common cause
613.121	to make the world better.
616.248	But smallpox was the fourth disease
616.248	that was intended for eradication.
620.068	We failed three other times.
622.345	We failed against malaria,
622.345	yellow fever and yaws.
625.648	But soon we may see polio eradicated.
629	But the key to eradicating polio
629	is early detection, early response.
635.61	This may be the year we eradicate polio.
638.483	That will make it
638.483	the second disease in history.
641.197	And David Heymann, who's watching
641.197	this on the webcast --
645.36	David, keep on going. We're close!
648.344	We're down to four countries.
650	(Applause)
656.431	I feel like Hank Aaron.
657.67	Barry Bonds can replace me any time.
659.697	Let's get another disease off the list
659.697	of terrible things to worry about.
664.815	I was just in India working on
664.815	the polio program.
668.088	The polio surveillance program
668.088	is four million people going door to door.
673.875	That is the surveillance system.
676	But we need to have
676	early detection, early response.
680.15	Blindness, the same thing.
681.801	The key to discovering blindness
681.801	is doing epidemiological surveys
686.777	and finding out the causes of blindness,
689	so you can mount the correct response.
692.261	The Seva Foundation
692.261	was started by a group of alumni
696.898	of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,
699.814	who, having climbed the highest mountain,
702.529	tasted the elixir of the success
702.529	of eradicating a disease,
707	wanted to do it again.
709	And over the last 27 years,
709	Seva's programs in 15 countries
713.892	have given back sight
713.892	to more than two million blind people.
717.982	Seva got started because we wanted
717.982	to apply these lessons
721.137	of surveillance and epidemiology
723.756	to something which nobody else
723.756	was looking at as a public health issue:
727.705	blindness, which heretofore had been
727.705	thought of only as a clinical disease.
732.834	In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me
732.834	that computer, which is Apple number 12,
739.13	and it's still in Kathmandu,
739.13	and it's still working,
741.607	and we ought to go get it and auction
741.607	it off and make more money for Seva.
746.214	And we conducted the first Nepal survey
746.214	ever done for health,
750.274	and the first nationwide
750.274	blindness survey ever done,
753.155	and we had astonishing results.
755.562	Instead of finding out
755.562	what we thought was the case --
758.297	that blindness was caused mostly
758.297	by glaucoma and trachoma --
762	we were astounded to find out
764.488	that blindness was caused
764.488	instead by cataract.
769.092	You can't cure or prevent
769.092	what you don't know is there.
775.145	In your TED packages
775.145	"there's a DVD, ""Infinite Vision,"""
779.365	about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.
782	I hope that you will take a look at it.
784.056	Aravind, which started as a Seva project,
786.254	is now the world's largest
786.254	and best eye hospital.
789.226	This year, that one hospital
789.226	will give back sight
792.647	to more than 300,000 people
792.647	in Tamil Nadu, India.
796.222	(Applause)
800.52	Bird flu.
801.696	I stand here as a representative
801.696	of all terrible things --
804.541	this might be the worst.
806.791	The key to preventing
806.791	or mitigating pandemic bird flu
811.569	is early detection and rapid response.
814	We will not have a vaccine
814	or adequate supplies of an antiviral
819.827	to combat bird flu if it occurs
819.827	in the next three years.
823.342	WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.
827.346	We are now at stage three
827.346	on the pandemic alert stage,
831.763	with just a little bit
831.763	of human-to-human transmission,
835.342	but no human-to-human-to-human
835.342	sustained transmission.
839	The moment WHO says
839	we've moved to category four --
843.252	this will not be like Katrina.
845.439	The world as we know it will stop.
847.542	There'll be no airplanes flying.
850	Would you get in an airplane
850	with 250 people you didn't know,
853.173	coughing and sneezing,
854.349	when you knew that some of them
854.349	might carry a disease that could kill you,
857.866	for which you had
857.866	no antivirals or vaccine?
861.877	I did a study of the top epidemiologists
861.877	in the world in October.
865.918	I asked them -- these are all fluologists
865.918	and specialists in influenza --
870	and I asked them the questions
870	you'd like to ask them:
872.86	What do you think the likelihood
872.86	is that there'll be a pandemic?
876.072	If it happens, how bad
876.072	do you think it will be?
879.622	Fifteen percent said they thought
879.622	there'd be a pandemic within three years.
883.737	But much worse than that,
	there'd be a pandemic
889.183	within your children
889.183	or your grandchildren's lifetime.
893.247	And they thought
893.247	that if there was a pandemic,
896.795	a billion people would get sick.
899.723	As many as 165 million people would die.
903.85	There would be a global
903.85	recession and depression
906.39	as our just-in-time inventory system
908.592	and the tight rubber band
908.592	of globalization broke,
912.434	and the cost to our economy
912.434	of one to three trillion dollars
916.402	would be far worse for everyone
916.402	than merely 100 million people dying,
922.048	because so many more people
922.048	would lose their job
924.374	and their healthcare benefits,
926	that the consequences
926	are almost unthinkable.
930.169	And it's getting worse,
930.169	because travel is getting so much better.
936.21	Let me show you a simulation
936.21	of what a pandemic looks like.
942.746	So we know what we're talking about.
945.393	Let's assume, for example,
945.393	that the first case occurs in South Asia.
950.4	It initially goes quite slowly.
952.774	You get two or three discrete locations.
957.128	Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,
957.128	and the disease will spread
961.765	from country to country so fast
961.765	that you won't know what hit you.
966.51	Within three weeks
966.51	it will be everywhere in the world.
970.786	"Now, if we had an ""undo"" button,"
970.786	and we could go back and isolate it
976.161	and grab it when it first started --
976.161	if we could find it early,
979.542	and we had early detection
979.542	and early response,
982	and we could put each one
982	of those viruses in jail --
985.714	that's the only way to deal with
985.714	something like a pandemic.
992.349	And let me show you why that is.
995.095	We have a joke.
996.279	This is an epidemic curve,
996.279	and everyone in medicine,
999.127	I think, ultimately gets
999.127	to know what it is.
1001.574	But the joke is,
1002.752	an epidemiologist likes to arrive
1002.752	at an epidemic right here
1005.885	and ride to glory on the downhill curve.
1008.047	(Laughter)
1009.174	But you don't get to do that usually.
1011	You usually arrive right about here.
1013.525	What we really want is to arrive
1013.525	right here, so we can stop the epidemic.
1019.325	But you can't always do that.
1021.192	But there's an organization
1021.192	that has been able to find a way
1024.773	to learn when the first cases occur,
1027	and that is called GPHIN;
1029.373	it's the Global Public Health
1029.373	Information Network.
1032.246	And that simulation that I showed you
1034.358	that you thought
1034.358	was bird flu -- that was SARS.
1036.963	And SARS is the pandemic
1036.963	that did not occur.
1040.332	And it didn't occur
1041.755	because GPHIN found
1041.755	the pandemic-to-be of SARS
1048.09	three months before WHO actually
1048.09	announced it, and because of that,
1054.152	we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.
1057.342	And I think we owe
1057.342	a great debt of gratitude
1059.447	to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,
1061.628	who I hope is in the audience
1061.628	some place -- over there --
1065.103	who's the founder of GPHIN.
1067	(Applause)
1068.507	Hello, Ron!
1070	(Applause)
1078.61	And TED has flown Ron here
1078.61	from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,
1083.248	because not only
1083.248	did GPHIN find SARS early,
1087.709	but you may have seen last week
1089.85	that Iran announced
1089.85	that they had bird flu in Iran,
1094.205	but GPHIN found the bird flu
1094.205	in Iran not February 14 --
1097.921	but last September.
1099.802	We need an early-warning system
1102.486	to protect us against the things
1102.486	that are humanity's worst nightmare.
1107.639	And so my TED wish is based on
1107.639	the common denominator
1111.465	of these experiences.
1112.855	Smallpox -- early detection,
1112.855	early response.
1115.765	Blindness, polio --
1115.765	early detection, early response.
1119.249	Pandemic bird flu --
1119.249	early detection, early response.
1123.265	It is a litany.
1124.676	It is so obvious that our only way
1124.676	of dealing with these new diseases
1129.714	is to find them early
1129.714	and to kill them before they spread.
1134.065	So, my TED wish is for you
1134.065	to help build a global system --
1138.497	an early-warning system --
1140	to protect us against
1140	humanity's worst nightmares.
1144.381	And what I thought I would call it
1144.381	"is ""Early Detection,"""
1151.724	But it should really be called ...
1155.223	"""Total Early Detection."""
1155.223	[TED]
1156.896	(Laughter)
1158.003	What?
1159.178	(Applause)
1166.593	What?
1167.767	(Applause)
1171.219	But in all seriousness,
1173.086	because this idea is birthed in TED,
1176.633	I would like it to be
1176.633	a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it
1182	"the ""International System for Total"
1182	"Early Disease Detection."""
1187.245	[INSTEDD]
1190.8	And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.
1198.235	So instead of a hidden
1198.235	pandemic of bird flu,
1200.764	we find it and immediately contain it.
1203.723	Instead of a novel virus
1203.723	caused by bio-terror or bio-error,
1208.622	or shift or drift,
1208.622	we find it and we contain it.
1213.268	Instead of industrial
1213.268	accidents like oil spills
1215.778	or the catastrophe in Bhopal,
1218	we find them, and we respond to them.
1221.79	Instead of famine,
1221.79	hidden until it is too late,
1224.937	we detect it, and we respond.
1229.061	And instead of a system
1229.061	which is owned by a government,
1232.252	and hidden in the bowels of government,
1234.697	let's build an early detection system
1237.323	that's freely available to anyone
1237.323	in the world in their own language.
1241.858	Let's make it transparent,
1241.858	non-governmental,
1246.65	not owned by any single
1246.65	country or company,
1249.73	housed in a neutral country,
1249.73	with redundant backup
1253.174	in a different time zone
1253.174	and a different continent.
1257.135	And let's build it on GPHIN.
1259.152	Let's start with GPHIN.
1261.05	Let's increase the websites
1261.05	that they crawl
1263.988	from 20,000 to 20 million.
1266.498	Let's increase the languages they crawl
1269.031	from seven to 70, or more.
1272.173	Let's build in outbound
1272.173	confirmation messages,
1275.737	using text messages or SMS
1275.737	or instant messaging
1279.025	to find out from people
1279.025	who are within 100 meters
1281.859	of the rumor that you hear,
1283.634	if it is, in fact, valid.
1285	And let's add satellite confirmation.
1287.614	And we'll add Gapminder's
1287.614	amazing graphics to the front end.
1291.545	And we'll grow it
1291.545	as a moral force in the world,
1295.487	finding out those terrible things
1297.603	before anybody else knows about them,
1299.714	and sending our response to them,
1302.164	so that next year,
1302.164	instead of us meeting here,
1305.702	lamenting how many terrible things
1305.702	there are in the world,
1309.28	we will have pulled together,
1311.042	used the unique skills
1311.042	and the magic of this community,
1315.945	and be proud that we have done
1315.945	everything we can to stop pandemics,
1319.391	other catastrophes, and change
1319.391	the world, beginning right now.
1325.083	(Applause)
1343.991	Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.
1346.2	First of all, just so
1346.2	everyone understands:
1349.007	you're saying that
1349.007	by creating web crawlers,
1353.547	looking on the Internet for patterns,
1356.452	they can detect something suspicious
1360.881	before WHO, before anyone else can see it?
1364.478	Give an example of how
1364.478	that could possibly be true.
1368.174	Larry Brilliant: You're not mad
1368.174	about the copyright violation?
1371.135	CA: No. I love it.
1372.318	(Laughter)
1373.544	LB: Well, as Ron St. John --
1375.121	I hope you'll go and meet him
1375.121	in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.
1378.565	When he started GPHIN --
1381.142	In 1997, there was an outbreak
1381.142	of bird flu -- H5N1.
1385.562	It was in Hong Kong.
1386.873	And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong
1386.873	responded immediately,
1390.079	by slaughtering 1.5 million
1390.079	chickens and birds,
1394.92	and they stopped
1394.92	that outbreak in its tracks.
1397.832	Immediate detection, immediate response.
1401.068	Then a number of years went by,
1402.586	and there were a lot
1402.586	of rumors about bird flu.
1405.584	Ron and his team in Ottawa
1405.584	began to crawl the web --
1409.396	only crawling 20,000 different websites,
1409.396	mostly periodicals --
1414.61	and they read about
1414.61	and heard about a concern,
1417.857	of a lot of children who had high fever
1417.857	and symptoms of bird flu.
1422.613	They reported this to WHO.
1425.161	WHO took a little while taking action,
1427.197	because WHO will only receive
1427.197	a report from a government,
1431.88	because it's the United Nations.
1434.396	But they were able to point
1434.396	to WHO and let them know
1437.822	that there was this surprising
1437.822	and unexplained cluster of illnesses
1442.311	that looked like bird flu.
1444.08	That turned out to be SARS.
1445.838	That's how the world found out about SARS.
1448.805	And because of that,
1448.805	we were able to stop SARS.
1451.739	Now, what's really important is that,
1451.739	before there was GPHIN,
	reports of bad things --
1459.58	whether you're talking about famine
1461.272	or you're talking about bird flu
1461.272	or you're talking about Ebola --
	came from nations.
1467.526	The moment these guys in Ottawa --
1469.209	on a budget of 800,000 dollars
1469.209	a year -- got cracking,
	in the world came from GPHIN,
1480.158	came from all the other 180 nations.
1483.516	Now, here's what's really interesting:
1485.508	after they'd been working
1485.508	for a couple years,
1488.175	what do you think happened
1488.175	to those nations?
1490.297	They felt pretty stupid.
1491.504	So they started sending in
1491.504	their reports early.
1493.741	And now, their reporting percentage
1493.741	is down to 50 percent,
1497.621	because other nations
1497.621	have started to report.
1500.063	So, can you find diseases
1500.063	early by crawling the web?
1504.253	Of course you can.
1505.825	Can you find it even earlier
1505.825	than GPHIN does now?
1508.697	Of course you can.
1509.872	You saw that they found SARS
1509.872	using their Chinese web crawler
1514.501	a full six weeks before they found it
1514.501	using their English web crawler.
1519.793	Well, they're only crawling
1519.793	in seven languages.
1522.206	These bad viruses really
1522.206	don't have any intention
1524.736	of showing up first in English
1524.736	or Spanish or French.
1527.218	(Laughter)
1529.241	So yes, I want to take GPHIN,
1529.241	I want to build on it.
1534.312	I want to add all the languages
1534.312	of the world that we possibly can.
1537.688	I want to make this open to everybody,
1540	so that the health officer
1540	in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar
1543	will have as much access to it
1543	as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.
1547.724	And I want to make it part of our culture
1550.152	that there is a community of people
1550.152	who are watching out
1553.763	for the worst nightmares of humanity,
1556	and that it's accessible to everyone.
