23.544	So what does it mean
23.544	for a machine to be athletic?
27.059	We will demonstrate the concept
27.059	of machine athleticism
29.908	and the research to achieve it
31.628	with the help of these flying machines
31.628	called quadrocopters,
34.51	or quads, for short.
38.291	Quads have been around for a long time.
40.501	They're so popular these days
40.501	because they're mechanically simple.
44.255	By controlling
44.255	the speeds of these four propellers,
46.668	these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,
49.437	and accelerate
49.437	along their common orientation.
52.179	On board are also a battery, a computer,
55.401	various sensors and wireless radios.
59.298	Quads are extremely agile,
59.298	but this agility comes at a cost.
63.762	They are inherently unstable,
65.874	and they need some form
65.874	of automatic feedback control
68.469	in order to be able to fly.
76.259	So, how did it just do that?
79.497	Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop
81.315	serve as an indoor
81.315	global positioning system.
84.301	It's used to locate objects in the space
86.364	that have these reflective
86.364	markers on them.
88.476	This data is then sent to another laptop
90.538	that is running estimation
90.538	and control algorithms,
92.92	which in turn sends commands to the quad,
94.898	which is also running estimation
94.898	and control algorithms.
101.864	The bulk of our research is algorithms.
104.13	It's the magic that brings
104.13	these machines to life.
108.291	So how does one design the algorithms
108.291	that create a machine athlete?
112.792	We use something broadly
112.792	called model-based design.
115.839	We first capture the physics
117.229	with a mathematical model
117.229	of how the machines behave.
120.636	We then use a branch of mathematics
120.636	called control theory
124.61	to analyze these models
126.291	and also to synthesize
126.291	algorithms for controlling them.
129.82	For example, that's how we can
129.82	make the quad hover.
132.868	We first captured the dynamics
132.868	with a set of differential equations.
136.182	We then manipulate these equations
136.182	with the help of control theory
139.658	to create algorithms
139.658	that stabilize the quad.
143.13	Let me demonstrate
143.13	the strength of this approach.
149.198	Suppose that we want
149.198	this quad to not only hover
151.855	but to also balance this pole.
154.52	With a little bit of practice,
156.318	it's pretty straightforward
156.318	for a human being to do this,
159.025	although we do have the advantage
159.025	of having two feet on the ground
162.24	and the use of our very versatile hands.
164.804	It becomes a little bit more difficult
167.566	when I only have one foot on the ground
169.569	and when I don't use my hands.
172.733	Notice how this pole has
172.733	a reflective marker on top,
175.319	which means that it can
175.319	be located in the space.
184.276	(Audience) Oh!
185.367	(Applause)
189.695	(Applause ends)
191.387	You can notice that this quad
191.387	is making fine adjustments
194.052	to keep the pole balanced.
196.417	How did we design
196.417	the algorithms to do this?
199.027	We added the mathematical
199.027	model of the pole
201.132	to that of the quad.
202.603	Once we have a model
202.603	of the combined quad-pole system,
205.605	we can use control theory to create
205.605	algorithms for controlling it.
210.538	Here, you see that it's stable,
212.126	and even if I give it little nudges,
214.819	it goes back --
217.589	to the nice, balanced position.
220.087	We can also augment the model
221.501	to include where we want
221.501	the quad to be in space.
224.428	Using this pointer,
224.428	made out of reflective markers,
227.395	I can point to where I want
227.395	the quad to be in space
229.848	a fixed distance away from me.
239.785	(Laughter)
247.763	The key to these acrobatic
247.763	maneuvers is algorithms,
250.913	designed with the help
250.913	of mathematical models
253.23	and control theory.
255.246	Let's tell the quad to come back here
257.255	and let the pole drop,
258.943	and I will next demonstrate the importance
261.098	of understanding physical models
263.111	and the workings of the physical world.
277.462	Notice how the quad lost altitude
277.462	when I put this glass of water on it.
281.314	Unlike the balancing pole,
282.741	I did not include the mathematical
282.741	model of the glass
285.78	in the system.
287.111	In fact, the system doesn't even know
287.111	that the glass is there.
290.148	Like before, I could use
290.148	the pointer to tell the quad
292.91	where I want it to be in space.
297.684	(Applause)
303.531	(Applause ends)
305.515	Okay, you should be asking yourself,
307.278	why doesn't the water
307.278	fall out of the glass?
309.888	Two facts.
310.942	The first is that gravity acts
310.942	on all objects in the same way.
315.051	The second is that the propellers
316.854	are all pointing in the same direction
316.854	of the glass, pointing up.
320.642	You put these two things together,
322.313	the net result is that all side forces
322.313	on the glass are small
325.892	and are mainly dominated
325.892	by aerodynamic effects,
328.193	which at these speeds are negligible.
335.336	And that's why you don't need
335.336	to model the glass.
337.694	It naturally doesn't spill,
337.694	no matter what the quad does.
344.5	(Audience) Oh!
350.34	(Applause)
355.159	(Applause ends)
357.94	The lesson here
359.078	is that some high-performance tasks
359.078	are easier than others,
363.115	and that understanding
363.115	the physics of the problem
365.476	tells you which ones are easy
365.476	and which ones are hard.
368.194	In this instance, carrying
368.194	a glass of water is easy.
370.728	Balancing a pole is hard.
374.171	We've all heard stories of athletes
374.171	performing feats while physically injured.
378.466	Can a machine also perform
378.466	with extreme physical damage?
382.636	Conventional wisdom says
384.145	that you need at least four fixed motor
384.145	propeller pairs in order to fly,
388.052	because there are four degrees
388.052	of freedom to control:
390.6	roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.
393.192	Hexacopters and octocopters,
393.192	with six and eight propellers,
396.437	can provide redundancy,
397.92	but quadrocopters are much more popular
399.909	because they have the minimum number
399.909	of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.
404.168	Or do they?
412.827	(Audience) Oh!
414.407	(Laughter)
421.334	If we analyze the mathematical
421.334	model of this machine
424.076	with only two working propellers,
426.252	we discover that there's
426.252	an unconventional way to fly it.
439.98	We relinquish control of yaw,
441.686	but roll, pitch and acceleration
441.686	can still be controlled
444.756	with algorithms that exploit
444.756	this new configuration.
453.668	Mathematical models tell us
453.668	exactly when and why this is possible.
457.981	In this instance, this knowledge
457.981	allows us to design
460.783	novel machine architectures
463.28	or to design clever algorithms
463.28	that gracefully handle damage,
466.972	just like human athletes do,
468.696	instead of building
468.696	machines with redundancy.
472.688	We can't help but hold our breath
474.369	when we watch a diver
474.369	somersaulting into the water,
477.068	or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,
479.045	the ground fast approaching.
480.576	Will the diver be able
480.576	to pull off a rip entry?
483.144	Will the vaulter stick the landing?
485.292	Suppose we want this quad here
485.292	to perform a triple flip
488.496	and finish off at the exact same
488.496	spot that it started.
491.736	This maneuver is going
491.736	to happen so quickly
493.879	that we can't use position feedback
493.879	to correct the motion during execution.
497.748	There simply isn't enough time.
499.782	Instead, what the quad can do
499.782	is perform the maneuver blindly,
503.476	observe how it finishes the maneuver,
505.708	and then use that information
505.708	to modify its behavior
508.209	so that the next flip is better.
510.421	Similar to the diver and the vaulter,
512.233	it is only through repeated practice
514.152	that the maneuver can
514.152	be learned and executed
516.319	to the highest standard.
525.1	(Laughter)
526.393	(Applause)
531.164	Striking a moving ball
531.164	is a necessary skill in many sports.
535.127	How do we make a machine do
536.643	what an athlete does
536.643	seemingly without effort?
549.547	(Laughter)
556.143	(Applause)
560.5	(Applause ends)
562.542	This quad has a racket
562.542	strapped onto its head
565.192	with a sweet spot roughly the size
565.192	of an apple, so not too large.
569.017	The following calculations
569.017	are made every 20 milliseconds,
571.846	or 50 times per second.
573.602	We first figure out where
573.602	the ball is going.
576.414	We then next calculate
576.414	how the quad should hit the ball
579.059	so that it flies
579.059	to where it was thrown from.
581.95	Third, a trajectory is planned
581.95	that carries the quad
586.406	from its current state
586.406	to the impact point with the ball.
589.43	Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds'
589.43	worth of that strategy.
593.366	Twenty milliseconds later,
593.366	the whole process is repeated
596.183	until the quad strikes the ball.
607.29	(Applause)
610.131	Machines can not only perform
610.131	dynamic maneuvers on their own,
613.578	they can do it collectively.
615.441	These three quads are cooperatively
615.441	carrying a sky net.
627.589	(Applause)
632.372	(Applause ends)
633.985	They perform an extremely dynamic
633.985	and collective maneuver
638.35	to launch the ball back to me.
640.042	Notice that, at full extension,
640.042	these quads are vertical.
648.486	(Applause)
650.258	In fact, when fully extended,
652.425	this is roughly five times greater
652.425	than what a bungee jumper feels
655.712	at the end of their launch.
663.203	The algorithms to do this are very similar
665.686	to what the single quad used
665.686	to hit the ball back to me.
669.07	Mathematical models are used
669.07	to continuously re-plan
671.934	a cooperative strategy
676.506	Everything we have seen so far has been
676.506	about the machines and their capabilities.
680.789	What happens when we couple
680.789	this machine athleticism
683.805	with that of a human being?
685.765	What I have in front of me
685.765	is a commercial gesture sensor
689.385	mainly used in gaming.
690.694	It can recognize
690.694	what my various body parts
692.766	are doing in real time.
694.71	Similar to the pointer
694.71	that I used earlier,
696.813	we can use this as inputs to the system.
699.454	We now have a natural way of interacting
701.85	with the raw athleticism
701.85	of these quads with my gestures.
742.715	(Applause)
756.354	Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.
758.394	It can be physical.
759.989	Take this quad, for example.
761.893	It's trying to stay
761.893	at a fixed point in space.
764.933	If I try to move it
764.933	out of the way, it fights me,
768.646	and moves back to where it wants to be.
772.254	We can change this behavior, however.
775.373	We can use mathematical models
777.072	to estimate the force
777.072	that I'm applying to the quad.
780.205	Once we know this force,
780.205	we can also change the laws of physics,
783.443	as far as the quad
783.443	is concerned, of course.
787.942	Here, the quad is behaving
787.942	as if it were in a viscous fluid.
794.57	We now have an intimate way
794.57	of interacting with a machine.
798.593	I will use this new capability to position
801.099	this camera-carrying quad
801.099	to the appropriate location
803.676	for filming the remainder
803.676	of this demonstration.
816.583	So we can physically interact
816.583	with these quads
818.99	and we can change the laws of physics.
821.393	Let's have a little bit of fun with this.
823.539	For what you will see next,
824.932	these quads will initially behave
824.932	as if they were on Pluto.
828.906	As time goes on, gravity will be increased
831.218	until we're all back on planet Earth,
833.267	but I assure you we won't get there.
835.462	Okay, here goes.
844.897	(Laughter)
874.778	(Laughter)
877.858	(Applause)
881.76	Whew!
887.045	You're all thinking now,
888.296	these guys are having way too much fun,
890.271	and you're probably also asking yourself,
892.35	why exactly are they building
892.35	machine athletes?
896.286	Some conjecture that the role
896.286	of play in the animal kingdom
899.12	is to hone skills
899.12	and develop capabilities.
901.69	Others think that it has
901.69	more of a social role,
903.929	that it's used to bind the group.
905.603	Similarly, we use the analogy
905.603	of sports and athleticism
908.963	to create new algorithms for machines
911.042	to push them to their limits.
913.35	What impact will the speed
913.35	of machines have on our way of life?
916.866	Like all our past creations
916.866	and innovations,
919.255	they may be used to improve
919.255	the human condition
922.082	or they may be misused and abused.
924.595	This is not a technical choice
924.595	we are faced with;
926.921	it's a social one.
928.332	Let's make the right choice,
929.707	the choice that brings out the best
929.707	in the future of machines,
932.643	just like athleticism in sports
932.643	can bring out the best in us.
936.38	Let me introduce you to the wizards
936.38	behind the green curtain.
939.479	They're the current members
939.479	of the Flying Machine Arena research team.
942.837	(Applause)
947.267	Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,
949.569	Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin,
949.569	Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.
953.018	Look out for them.
953.018	They're destined for great things.
955.566	Thank you.
956.644	(Applause)
