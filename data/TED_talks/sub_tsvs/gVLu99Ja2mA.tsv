16.259	(Applause)
23.101	Thank you very much.
24.298	I have a few pictures,
26.26	and I'll talk a little bit
26.26	about how I'm able to do what I do.
30.405	All these houses are built
32.791	from between 70 and 80 percent
32.791	recycled material,
35.664	stuff that was headed to the mulcher,
35.664	the landfill, the burn pile.
38.839	It was all just gone.
40.26	This is the first house I built.
42.572	This double front door here
42.572	with the three-light transom,
45.987	that was headed to the landfill.
48.151	Have a little turret there.
50.007	And then these buttons
50.007	on the corbels here --
54.08	right there --
55.265	those are hickory nuts.
56.645	And these buttons there --
58.776	those are chicken eggs.
60.127	(Laughter)
61.32	Of course, first you have breakfast,
63.105	and then you fill the shell full
63.105	of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,
67.044	and you have an architectural button
67.044	in just a fraction of the time.
71.186	This is a look at the inside.
73.447	You can see the three-light transom
73.447	there with the eyebrow windows.
76.736	Certainly an architectural antique
76.736	headed to the landfill --
79.814	even the lockset
79.814	is probably worth 200 dollars.
82.998	Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.
84.909	There's a 1952 O'Keefe &amp; Merritt stove,
86.93	if you like to cook -- cool stove.
89.842	This is going up into the turret.
91.983	I got that staircase for 20 dollars,
94.931	including delivery to my lot.
97.26	(Laughter)
99.774	Then, looking up in the turret,
102.1	you see there are bulges
102.1	and pokes and sags and so forth.
105.743	Well, if that ruins your life,
107.409	well, then, you shouldn't live there.
109.26	(Laughter)
111.161	This is a laundry chute.
113.984	And this right here is a shoe last --
116.423	those are those cast-iron things
116.423	you see at antique shops.
119.279	So I had one of those,
120.592	so I made some low-tech gadgetry,
120.592	where you just stomp on the shoe last,
124.362	and then the door flies open
124.362	and you throw your laundry down.
127.26	And then if you're smart enough,
127.26	it goes on a basket on top of the washer.
131.07	If not, it goes into the toilet.
133.708	(Laughter)
135.781	This is a bathtub I made,
137.488	made out of scrap two-by-four.
139.569	Started with the rim, and then glued
139.569	and nailed it up into a flat,
143.827	corbeled it up and flipped it over,
145.545	then did the two profiles on this side.
147.546	It's a two-person tub.
149.435	After all, it's not just
149.435	a question of hygiene,
152.402	but there's a possibility
152.402	of recreation as well.
154.918	(Laughter)
157.711	Then, this faucet here
157.711	is just a piece of Osage orange.
163.602	It looks a little phallic,
165.198	but after all, it's a bathroom.
166.923	(Laughter)
169.892	This is a house based on a Budweiser can.
171.889	It doesn't look like a can of beer,
173.605	but the design take-offs
173.605	are absolutely unmistakable:
176.133	the barley hops design
176.133	worked up into the eaves,
178.489	then the dentil work comes directly
178.489	off the can's red, white, blue and silver.
182.261	Then, these corbels going
182.261	down underneath the eaves
184.723	are that little design
184.723	that comes off the can.
186.925	I just put a can on a copier
186.925	and kept enlarging it
189.568	until I got the size I want.
191.108	Then, on the can it says,
193.679	"""This is the famous Budweiser beer,"
195.41	we know of no other beer,
195.41	"blah, blah, blah."""
197.492	So we changed that and put,
198.809	"""This is the famous Budweiser house."
198.809	"We don't know of any other house ..."""
202.332	and so forth and so on.
203.508	This is a deadbolt.
204.689	It's a fence from a 1930s shaper,
204.689	which is a very angry woodworking machine.
208.455	And they gave me the fence,
208.455	but they didn't give me the shaper,
211.455	so we made a deadbolt out of it.
213.15	That'll keep bull elephants
213.15	out, I promise.
215.415	(Laughter)
216.444	And sure enough, we've had
216.444	no problems with bull elephants.
219.322	(Laughter)
220.508	The shower is intended
220.508	to simulate a glass of beer.
223.445	We've got bubbles going up there,
223.445	then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.
226.94	Where do you get lumpy tiles?
226.94	Well, of course, you don't.
229.653	But I get a lot of toilets, and so you
229.653	just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,
233.378	and then you have lumpy tiles.
235.26	And then the faucet is a beer tap.
238.807	(Laughter)
241.557	Then, this panel of glass
241.557	is the same panel of glass
245.983	that occurs in every middle-class
245.983	front door in America.
248.854	We're getting tired of it.
248.854	It's kind of clich√©d now.
251.386	If you put it in the front door,
251.386	your design fails.
254.835	So don't put it in the front door;
254.835	put it somewhere else.
257.585	It's a pretty panel of glass.
259.135	But if you put it in the front door,
260.9	"people say, ""Oh, you're trying"
260.9	to be like those guys,
263.432	"and you didn't make it."""
264.607	So don't put it there.
266.439	Then, another bathroom upstairs.
268.26	This light up here
269.521	is the same light that occurs
269.521	in every middle-class foyer in America.
273.32	Don't put it in the foyer.
275.26	Put it in the shower, or in the closet,
278.021	but not in the foyer.
281.162	Then, somebody gave me
281.162	a bidet, so it got a bidet.
283.872	(Laughter)
286.318	This little house here,
287.97	those branches there are made
287.97	out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.
291.923	These pictures will keep scrolling
291.923	as I talk a little bit.
295.415	In order to do what I do,
297.705	you have to understand what causes
297.705	waste in the building industry.
301.484	Our housing has become a commodity,
304.141	and I'll talk a little bit about that.
306.458	But the first cause of waste
306.458	is probably even buried in our DNA.
309.593	Human beings have a need
309.593	for maintaining consistency
312.085	of the apperceptive mass.
314.042	What does that mean?
315.217	What it means is,
315.217	for every perception we have,
317.523	it needs to tally
317.523	with the one like it before,
320.137	or we don't have continuity,
320.137	and we become a little bit disoriented.
323.555	So I can show you an object
323.555	you've never seen before.
326.26	Oh, that's a cell phone.
328.636	But you've never seen this one before.
331.269	What you're doing
332.451	is sizing up the pattern
332.451	of structural features,
335.475	and then you go through your databanks:
338.063	Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.
340.819	If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,
342.925	"""Wait a second."
344.439	(Laughter)
345.618	"""That's not a cell phone."
346.991	That's one of those new
346.991	"chocolate cell phones."""
349.915	(Laughter)
351.653	You'd have to start a new category,
353.364	right between cell phones and chocolate.
355.45	(Laughter)
357.285	That's how we process information.
358.975	You translate that
358.975	to the building industry.
361.131	If we have a wall of windowpanes
361.131	and one pane is cracked, we go,
364.185	"""Oh, dear. That's cracked."
364.185	Let's repair it.
366.234	Let's take it out and throw it away
366.234	so nobody can use it
368.894	"and put a new one in."""
370.078	Because that's what you do
370.078	with a cracked pane.
372.324	Never mind that it doesn't
372.324	affect our lives at all.
374.808	It only rattles that expected pattern
374.808	and unity of structural features.
379.616	However, if we took a small hammer,
382.068	and we added cracks
382.068	to all the other windows --
384.658	(Laughter)
386.683	then we have a pattern.
387.921	Because Gestalt psychology
387.921	emphasizes recognition of pattern
391.012	over parts that comprise a pattern.
393.067	"We'll go, ""Ooh, that's nice."""
394.87	So, that serves me every day.
398.04	Repetition creates pattern.
399.81	If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,
401.633	it makes no difference
401.633	what these and those are.
403.931	If I can repeat anything,
403.931	I have the possibility of a pattern,
406.877	from hickory nuts and chicken eggs,
406.877	shards of glass, branches.
409.824	It doesn't make any difference.
411.362	That causes a lot of waste
411.362	in the building industry.
413.914	The second cause is,
415.089	Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,
417.014	wrote a book titled
417.014	"""The Birth of Tragedy."""
419.345	And in there,
420.953	he said cultures tend to swing
420.953	between one of two perspectives:
423.991	on the one hand,
423.991	we have an Apollonian perspective,
427.235	which is very crisp and premeditated
427.235	and intellectualized
431.038	and perfect.
433.741	On the other end of the spectrum,
433.741	we have a Dionysian perspective,
436.977	which is more given
436.977	to the passions and intuition,
439.384	tolerant of organic texture
439.384	and human gesture.
442.187	So the way the Apollonian personality
442.187	takes a picture or hangs a picture is,
447.53	they'll get out a transit
449.43	and a laser level
451.106	and a micrometer.
452.81	"""OK, honey. A thousandth"
452.81	of an inch to the left.
455.104	That's where we want
455.104	"the picture. Right. Perfect!"""
457.511	Predicated on plumb level,
457.511	square and centered.
460.142	The Dionysian personality
460.142	takes the picture and goes:
464.04	(Laughter)
469.131	That's the difference.
471.1	I feature blemish.
472.885	I feature organic process.
474.965	Dead center John Dewey.
476.876	Apollonian mindset
476.876	creates mountains of waste.
481.144	If something isn't perfect,
482.81	if it doesn't line up
482.81	with that premeditated model?
485.664	Dumpster.
486.839	"""Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."""
488.127	"""Oops"" this, ""oops"" that."
488.127	Landfill, landfill, landfill.
490.778	The third thing is arguably --
493.909	The Industrial Revolution
493.909	started in the Renaissance
496.386	with the rise of humanism,
497.664	then got a little jump start
497.664	along about the French Revolution.
500.653	By the middle of the 19th century,
500.653	it's in full flower.
503.305	And we have dumaflaches and gizmos
505.936	and contraptions that will do anything
509.205	that we, up to that point,
511.069	had to do by hand.
512.844	So now we have standardized materials.
514.943	Well, trees don't grow
514.943	two inches by four inches,
517.825	eight, ten and twelve feet tall.
519.531	(Laughter)
520.58	We create mountains of waste.
522.027	And they're doing a pretty good job
522.027	there in the forest,
525.592	working all the byproduct
525.592	of their industry --
528.108	with OSB and particle board
528.108	and so forth and so on --
530.894	but it does no good
532.713	to be responsible at the point
532.713	of harvest in the forest
535.81	if consumers are wasting the harvest
535.81	at the point of consumption.
539.193	And that's what's happening.
541.074	And so if something isn't standard,
542.81	"""Oops, dumpster."" ""Oops"" this."
542.81	"""Oops, warped."""
545.767	If you buy a two-by-four
545.767	and it's not straight,
548.02	you can take it back.
549.304	"""Oh, I'm so sorry, sir."
549.304	"We'll get you a straight one."""
551.939	Well, I feature all those warped things
555.255	because repetition creates pattern,
557.094	and it's from a Dionysian perspective.
559.123	The fourth thing
560.429	is labor is disproportionately
560.429	more expensive than materials.
564.179	Well, that's just a myth.
565.693	And there's a story:
566.879	Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained --
566.879	"I said, ""Jim, it's time now."
570.462	I got a job for you as a foreman
570.462	"on a framing crew. Time for you to go."""
573.901	"""Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."""
575.676	"""Jim, now it's time."
575.676	"You're the down -- oh!"""
578.666	So we hired on.
580.041	And he was out there with a tape measure,
580.041	going through the trash heap,
583.542	looking for header material,
583.542	or the board that goes over a door,
586.666	thinking he'd impress his boss --
586.666	that's how we taught him to do it.
589.911	The superintendent walked up
589.911	"and said, ""What are you doing?"""
592.786	"""Oh, just looking for header material,"""
594.73	waiting for that kudos.
595.915	"He said, ""I'm not paying you to go"
595.915	"through the trash. Get back to work."""
599.397	And Jim had the wherewithal to say,
601.129	"""You know, if you were paying me"
604.527	I can see how you might say that.
606.568	But right now, I'm saving you
606.568	five dollars a minute.
609.669	"Do the math."""
611.041	(Laughter)
613.389	"""Good call, Tulles. From now on,"
613.389	"you guys hit this pile first."""
616.627	And the irony is that he wasn't
616.627	very good at math.
619.126	(Laughter)
622.556	But once in a while,
622.556	you get access to the control room,
625.231	and then you can
625.231	kind of mess with the dials.
627.364	And that's what happened there.
629.698	The fifth thing is that maybe,
629.698	after 2,500 years,
632.121	Plato is still having his way with us
632.121	in his notion of perfect forms.
635.463	He said that we have in our noggin
635.463	the perfect idea of what we want,
639.659	and we force environmental
639.659	resources to accommodate that.
642.66	So we all have in our head
642.66	the perfect house,
645.142	the American dream, which is a house,
647.396	the dream house.
649.007	The problem is we can't afford it.
650.81	So we have the American dream look-alike,
652.81	which is a mobile home.
654.146	Now there's a blight on the planet.
656.46	(Laughter)
657.738	It's a chattel mortgage,
659.482	just like furniture, just like a car.
661.483	You write the check,
661.483	and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.
664.639	After a year, you can't get insurance
664.639	on everything you have in it,
667.87	only on 70 percent.
669.165	Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.
670.938	Nothing wrong with that,
672.13	unless you ask it to do
672.13	what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,
675	and that's what happens.
676.227	It out-gasses formaldehyde --
677.732	so much so that there is
677.732	a federal law in place
681.897	to warn new mobile home buyers
681.897	of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.
686.485	Are we just being numbingly stupid?
688.555	The walls are this thick.
690.386	The whole thing has
690.386	the structural value of corn.
693.387	(Laughter)
695.294	"""So ... I thought Palm Harbor"
695.294	"Village was over there."""
697.89	"""No, no. We had a wind last night."
699.952	"It's gone now."""
701.548	(Laughter)
704.81	Then when they degrade,
704.81	what do you do with them?
707.619	Now, all that --
709.886	that Apollonian, Platonic model --
712.658	is what the building industry
712.658	is predicated on,
715.245	and there are a number of things
715.245	that exacerbate that.
717.945	One is that all the professionals,
720.487	all the tradesmen, vendors,
722.178	inspectors, engineers, architects
724.58	all think like this.
726.698	And then it works its way
726.698	back to the consumer,
728.928	who demands the same model.
730.396	It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
730.396	We can't get out of it.
733.531	Then here come the marketeers
733.531	and the advertisers.
736.131	"""Woo. Woo-hoo."""
738.579	We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.
741.81	All we have to do
741.81	is look at what one company did
744.366	with carbonated prune juice.
746.381	How disgusting.
747.81	(Laughter)
749.626	But you know what they did?
750.958	They hooked a metaphor into it
750.958	"and said, ""I drink Dr. Pepper ..."""
754.058	And pretty soon, we're swilling
754.058	that stuff by the lake-ful,
757.076	by the billions of gallons.
758.811	It doesn't even have real prunes!
758.811	Doesn't even keep you regular.
761.972	(Laughter)
763.756	My oh my, that makes it worse.
765.81	And we get sucked
765.81	into that faster than anything.
769.03	Then, a man named
769.03	Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book
771.763	"titled ""Being and Nothingness."""
773.272	It's a pretty quick read.
773.272	You can snap through it in maybe --
776.218	(Laughter)
777.306	maybe two years,
778.482	if you read eight hours a day.
780.81	In there, he talked
780.81	about the divided self.
783.147	He said human beings act differently
783.147	when they know they're alone
786.249	than when they know
786.249	somebody else is around.
788.333	So if I'm eating spaghetti,
788.333	and I know I'm alone,
790.659	I can eat like a backhoe.
792.151	I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,
792.151	napkin on the table,
795.389	chew with my mouth open,
795.389	make little noises,
798.73	scratch wherever I want.
800.731	(Laughter)
802.615	But as soon as you walk in,
804.086	"I go, ""Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."""
806.588	Napkin in my lap, half-bites,
808.465	chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.
810.722	Now, what I'm doing
810.722	is fulfilling your expectations
815.681	of how I should live my life.
819.079	I feel that expectation,
820.885	and so I accommodate it,
822.325	and I'm living my life according
822.325	to what you expect me to do.
825.595	That happens in the building
825.595	industry as well.
827.89	That's why all subdivisions look the same.
830.769	Sometimes, we even have
830.769	these formalized cultural expectations.
834.909	I'll bet all your shoes match.
836.81	Sure enough, we all buy into that ...
839.019	(Laughter)
840.693	And with gated communities,
843.142	we have a formalized expectation,
845.542	with a homeowners' association.
847.144	Sometimes those guys are Nazis,
848.866	my oh my.
851.19	That exacerbates and continues this model.
854.972	The last thing is gregariousness.
857.668	Human beings are a social species.
859.605	We like to hang together in groups,
862.327	just like wildebeests, just like lions.
864.231	Wildebeests don't hang with lions,
865.911	because lions eat wildebeests.
867.95	Human beings are like that.
869.42	We do what that group does
871.54	that we're trying to identify with.
873.942	You see this in junior high a lot.
876.551	Those kids, they'll work
876.551	all summer long -- kill themselves --
880.946	so that they can afford
880.946	one pair of designer jeans.
885.178	So along about September,
887.46	they can stride in and go,
889.461	"""I'm important today. See?"
889.461	Don't touch my designer jeans!
893.699	I see you don't have designer jeans.
896.56	You're not one of the beautiful --
896.56	See, I'm one of the beautiful people.
900.28	"See my jeans?"""
901.492	Right there is reason
901.492	enough to have uniforms.
904.445	And so that happens
904.445	in the building industry as well.
907.938	We have confused
907.938	Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
912.181	just a little bit.
913.81	On the bottom tier, we have basic needs:
917.188	shelter, clothing, food,
917.188	water, mating and so forth.
920.746	Second: security. Third: relationships.
923.108	Fourth: status, self-esteem --
923.108	that is, vanity --
926.15	and we're taking vanity
926.15	and shoving it down here.
929.603	And so we end up
932.087	with vain decisions,
934.865	and we can't even afford our mortgage.
937.081	We can't afford to eat
937.081	anything except beans;
939.859	that is, our housing
939.859	has become a commodity.
944.073	And it takes a little bit of nerve
947.383	to dive into those primal,
949.81	terrifying parts of ourselves
952.81	and make our own decisions
955.262	and not make our housing a commodity,
957.263	but make it something
957.263	that bubbles up from seminal sources.
960.81	That takes a little bit of nerve,
962.611	and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.
966.233	But that's okay.
968.44	If failure destroys you,
970.252	then you can't do this.
971.506	I fail all the time, every day,
974.036	and I've had some whopping
974.036	failures, I promise --
977.772	big, public, humiliating,
977.772	embarrassing failures.
980.81	Everybody points and laughs,
982.274	"and they say, ""He tried it a fifth time,"
982.274	and it still didn't work!
985.394	"What a moron!"""
986.798	Early on, contractors come by and say,
988.81	"""Dan, you're a cute little bunny,"
990.597	but you know,
990.597	this just isn't going to work.
992.779	What don't you do this?
992.779	"Why don't you do that?"""
995.134	And your instinct is to say,
997.664	"""Well, why don't you suck an egg?"""
999.355	(Laughter)
1000.81	But you don't say that,
1002.498	because they're the guys you're targeting.
1005.451	And so what we've done --
1008.454	and this isn't just in housing;
1008.454	it's in clothing and food
1011.871	and our transportation
1011.871	needs, our energy --
1014.748	we sprawl just a little bit.
1018.256	And when I get a little bit of press,
1020.81	I hear from people all over the world.
1023.119	And we may have invented excess,
1025.962	but the problem of waste is worldwide.
1030.444	We're in trouble.
1033.445	And I don't wear ammo belts
1033.445	crisscrossing my chest
1036.523	and a red bandana.
1038.635	But we're clearly in trouble.
1040.858	And what we need to do is reconnect
1044.81	with those really primal
1044.81	parts of ourselves
1048.471	and make some decisions and say,
1050.541	"""You know, I think I would like to put"
1050.541	CDs across the wall there.
1055.294	"What do you think, honey?"""
1057.271	If it doesn't work, take it down.
1060.119	What we need to do is reconnect
1060.119	with who we really are,
1063.722	and that's thrilling indeed.
1066.743	Thank you very much.
1067.95	(Applause)
