12.346	What do you guys think?
14.706	For those who watched
14.706	Sir Ken's memorable TED Talk,
19.18	I am a typical example 
19.18	of what he describes
22.322	"as ""the body as a form"
22.322	"of transport for the head,"""
25.346	a university professor.
27.737	You might think it was not fair
31.217	that I've been lined up to speak
31.217	after these first two talks
34.18	to speak about science.
36.774	I can't move my body to the beat,
40.272	and after a scientist
40.272	who became a philosopher,
43.184	I have to talk about hard science.
45.126	It could be a very dry subject.
48.154	Yet, I feel honored.
51.679	Never in my career,
53.462	and it's been a long career,
55.023	have I had the opportunity to start a talk
57.256	feeling so inspired, like this one.
60.264	Usually, talking about science
64.144	is like exercising in a dry place.
68.284	However, I've had the pleasure
71.516	of being invited to come here
71.516	to talk about water.
75.885	"The words ""water"" and ""dry"""
75.885	do not match, right?
79.426	It is even better to talk about
79.426	water in the Amazon,
82.916	which is the splendid cradle 
82.916	of life. Fresh life.
87.95	So this is what inspired me.
90.028	That's why I'm here,
90.028	although I'm carrying
92.23	my head over here.
94.143	I am trying, or will try to convey
94.143	this inspiration.
98.237	I hope this story will inspire you
98.237	and that you'll spread the word.
103.317	We know that there is controversy.
107.637	"The Amazon is the ""lung of the world,"""
110.94	because of its massive power
110.94	to have vital gases exchanged
116.426	between the forest and the atmosphere.
118.245	We also hear about
118.245	the storehouse of biodiversity.
122.345	While many believe it,
126.651	few know it.
128.197	If you go out there, in this marsh,
130.075	you'll be amazed at the --
133.913	You can barely see the animals.
135.957	"The Indians say, ""The forest"
135.957	"has more eyes than leaves."""
140.011	That is true, and I will try
140.011	to show you something.
142.987	But today, I'm going to use
142.987	a different approach,
146.168	one that is inspired by these
146.168	two initiatives here,
149.188	a harmonic one and a philosophical one.
151.869	I'll try to use an approach
151.869	that's slightly materialistic,
155.998	but it also attempts to convey
155.998	that, in nature, there is
159.216	extraordinary philosophy and harmony.
162.31	There'll be no music in my presentation,
164.271	but I hope you'll all notice the music
164.271	of the reality I'm going to show you.
168.494	I'm going to talk about physiology —
168.494	not about lungs,
171.107	but other analogies with human physiology,
174.635	especially the heart.
176.744	We'll start
181.132	by thinking that water is like blood.
186.5	The circulation in our body
186.5	distributes fresh blood,
191.349	which feeds, nurtures and supports us,
193.959	and brings the used blood back
193.959	to be renewed.
198.337	In the Amazon, things happen similarly.
202.659	We'll start by talking about
202.659	the power of all these processes.
207.766	This is an image
212.387	of rain in motion.
215.198	What you see there
215.198	is the years passing in seconds.
219.211	Rains all over the world.
219.211	What do you see?
222.159	The equatorial region, in general,
224.019	and the Amazon specifically,
225.882	is extremely important
225.882	for the world's climate.
228.751	It's a powerful engine.
230.916	There is a frantic evaporation
230.916	taking place here.
236.212	If we take a look at this other image,
238.834	which shows the water vapor flow,
241.616	you have dry air in black,
241.616	moist air in gray,
244.801	and clouds in white.
246.232	What you see there is an extraordinary
246.232	resurgence in the Amazon.
251.908	What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert,
254.031	what phenomenon makes water
254.031	gush from the ground into the atmosphere
259.277	with such power 
259.277	that it can be seen from space?
262.36	What phenomenon is this?
263.902	It could be a geyser.
266.77	A geyser is underground water
266.77	heated by magma,
270.558	exploding into the atmosphere
271.998	and transferring this water 
271.998	into the atmosphere.
275.668	There are no geysers in the Amazon,
275.668	unless I am wrong.
278.534	I don't know of any.
280.502	But we have something
280.502	that plays the same role,
284.906	with much more elegance though:
288.298	the trees, our good old friends
291.194	that, like geysers,
294.008	can transfer an enormous amount of water
294.008	from the ground into the atmosphere.
299.086	There are 600 billion trees
299.086	in the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.
304.783	That is done with
304.783	an extraordinary sophistication.
308.646	They don't need the heat of magma.
310.291	They use sunlight to do this process.
313.262	So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,
316.793	a big tree manages
316.793	to transfer 1,000 liters of water
319.723	through its transpiration --
322.032	1,000 liters.
323.447	If we take all the Amazon,
328.642	which is a very large area,
330.505	and add it up to all that water
330.505	that is released by transpiration,
333.785	which is the sweat of the forest,
336.291	we'll get to an incredible number:
341.781	In one day.
343.375	Do you know how much that is?
345.562	The Amazon River,
345.562	the largest river on Earth,
348.122	one fifth of all the fresh water
349.703	that leaves the continents of the
349.703	whole world and ends up in the oceans,
353.152	dumps 17 billion metric tons
353.152	of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.
357.562	This river of vapor
358.811	that comes up from the forest
358.811	and goes into the atmosphere
361.706	is greater than the Amazon River.
363.31	Just to give you an idea.
365.187	If we could take a gigantic kettle,
368.743	the kind you could plug into
368.743	a power socket, an electric one,
371.642	and put those 20 billion
371.642	metric tons of water in it,
374.14	how much power would you need
374.14	to have this water evaporated?
377.49	Any idea? A really big kettle.
380.247	A gigantic kettle, right?
384.518	Itaipu is still the largest
384.518	hydroelectric plant in the world.
388.264	and Brazil is very proud of it
389.937	because it provides more 
389.937	than 30 percent of the power
392.136	that is consumed in Brazil.
394.093	And the Amazon is here,
394.093	doing this for free.
398.785	It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,
398.785	providing environmental services.
406.047	Related to this subject,
407.608	we are going to talk about
407.608	what I call the paradox of chance,
410.596	which is curious.
412.764	If you look at the world map --
414.476	it's easy to see this --
415.835	you'll see that there are forests
415.835	in the equatorial zone,
418.904	and deserts are organized
418.904	at 30 degrees north latitude,
425.199	Look over there, in the southern
425.199	hemisphere, the Atacama;
428.243	Namibia and Kalahari in Africa;
428.243	the Australian desert.
430.84	In the northern hemisphere,
430.84	the Sahara, Sonoran, etc.
433.994	There is an exception, and it's curious:
438.433	It's the quadrangle that ranges from
438.433	Cuiabá to Buenos Aires,
441.52	and from São Paulo to the Andes.
443.323	This quadrangle
443.323	was supposed to be a desert.
446.437	It's on the line of deserts.
448.746	Why isn't it? That's why
448.746	I call it the paradox of chance.
452.01	What do we have in South America
452.01	that is different?
456.279	If we could use the analogy
458.448	of the blood circulating in our bodies,
462.58	like the water
462.58	circulating in the landscape,
465.662	we see that rivers are veins,
469.788	they drain the landscape,
469.788	they drain the tissue of nature.
474.333	Where are the arteries?
476.288	Any guess?
478.323	What takes --
480.139	How does water get to irrigate
480.139	the tissues of nature
485.402	and bring everything back through rivers?
488.585	There is a new type of river,
491.606	which originates in the blue sea,
494.897	which flows through the green ocean --
498.247	it not only flows, but it is also
498.247	pumped by the green ocean --
501.244	and then it falls on our land.
504.299	All our economy, that quadrangle,
	GDP comes from that area.
511.037	It depends on this river.
512.675	This river flows invisibly above us.
514.727	We are floating here
514.727	on this floating hotel,
516.915	on one of the largest rivers on Earth,
516.915	the Negro River.
519.87	It's a bit dry and rough,
519.87	but we are floating here,
523.259	and there is this
523.259	invisible river running above us.
526.349	This river has a pulse.
529.516	Here it is, pulsing.
531.939	That's why we also talk about the heart.
534.327	You can see the different seasons there.
536.462	There's the rainy season. In the Amazon,
536.462	we used to have two seasons,
539.823	the humid season
539.823	and the even more humid season.
542.306	Now we have a dry season.
543.962	You can see the river covering that region
546.671	which, otherwise, would be a desert.
546.671	And it is not.
553.633	We, scientists --
553.633	You see that I'm struggling here
557.151	to move my head
557.151	from one side to the other.
559.634	Scientists study how it works, why, etc.
565.031	and these studies
565.031	are generating a series of discoveries,
569.718	which are absolutely fabulous,
571.29	to raise our awareness of the wealth,
574.283	the complexity,
574.283	and the wonder that we have,
576.668	the symphony we have in this process.
579.649	One of them is: How is rain formed?
581.997	Above the Amazon, there is clean air,
585.522	as there is clean air above the ocean.
587.44	The blue sea has clean air above it
587.44	and forms pretty few clouds;
590.493	there's almost no rain there.
591.952	The green ocean has the same clean air,
591.952	but forms a lot of rain.
596.366	What is happening here that is different?
598.753	The forest emits smells,
600.423	and these smells are condensation nuclei,
603.361	which form drops in the atmosphere.
605.625	Then, clouds are formed
605.625	and there is torrential rain.
610.503	The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.
613.9	This relation between a living thing,
613.9	which is the forest,
618.712	and a nonliving thing,
618.712	which is the atmosphere,
621.856	is ingenious in the Amazon,
624.133	because the forest provides
624.133	water and seeds,
629.464	and the atmosphere forms the rain
629.464	and gives water back,
632.449	guaranteeing the forest's survival.
636.421	There are other factors as well.
637.95	We've talked a little about the heart,
639.764	and let's now talk about
639.764	another function: the liver!
642.654	When humid air, high humidity
642.654	and radiation are combined
647.715	with these organic compounds,
649.775	which I call exogenous vitamin C,
649.775	generous vitamin C in the form of gas,
655.487	the plants release antioxidants
658.317	which react with pollutants.
660.637	You can rest assured
662.041	that you are breathing the purest air
662.041	on Earth, here in the Amazon,
665.538	because the plants take care
665.538	of this characteristic as well.
669.045	This benefits the very way plants work,
671.662	which is another ingenious cycle.
673.715	Speaking of fractals,
677.569	and their relation with the way we work,
679.905	we can establish other comparisons.
682.493	As in the upper airways of our lungs,
686.024	the air in the Amazon
686.024	gets cleaned up from the excess of dust.
689.736	The dust in the air that we breathe
689.736	is cleaned by our airways.
693.714	This keeps the excess of dust
693.714	from affecting the rainfall.
697.533	When there are fires in the Amazon,
699.38	the smoke stops the rain, 
699.38	it stops raining,
702.224	the forest dries up and catches fire.
704.426	There is another fractal analogy.
707.057	Like in the veins and arteries,
709.009	the rain water is a feedback.
711.805	It returns to the atmosphere.
713.834	Like endocrinal glands and hormones,
718.12	there are those gases
718.12	which I told you about before,
720.863	that are formed and released
720.863	into the atmosphere, like hormones,
724.495	which help in the formation of rain.
727.49	Like the liver and the kidneys,
727.49	as I've said, cleaning the air.
731.435	And, finally, like the heart:
733.234	pumping water from outside, from the sea,
738.307	into the forest.
740.179	We call it the biotic moisture pump,
743.581	a new theory that is explained
743.581	in a very simple way.
747.731	If there is a desert in the continent
750.389	with a nearby sea,
752.477	evaporation's greater on the sea,
754.311	and it sucks the air above the desert.
757.28	The desert is trapped in this condition.
757.28	It will always be dry.
760.762	If you have
760.762	the opposite situation, a forest,
763.528	the evaporation, as we showed,
763.528	is much greater, because of the trees,
767.266	and this relation is reversed.
768.978	The air above the sea
768.978	is sucked into the continent
771.331	and humidity is imported.
774.179	This satellite image
774.179	was taken one month ago —
778.676	that's Manaus down there,
778.676	we're down there —
781.063	and it shows this process.
782.418	It's not a common little river
782.418	that flows into a canal.
785.462	It's a mighty river
785.462	that irrigates South America,
790.192	among other things.
792.016	This image shows those paths,
794.333	all the hurricanes
794.333	that have been recorded.
797.638	You can see that, in the red square,
797.638	there hardly are any hurricanes.
802.208	That is no accident.
803.786	This pump that sucks
803.786	the moisture into the continent
807.25	also speeds up the air above the sea,
809.485	and this prevents hurricane formations.
813.053	To close this part and sum up,
817.645	I'd like to talk about
817.645	something a little different.
820.265	I have several colleagues
822.225	who worked in the development
822.225	of these theories.
824.71	They think, and so do I,
828.341	that we can save planet Earth.
830.939	I'm not talking only about the Amazon.
833.684	The Amazon teaches us a lesson
835.809	on how pristine nature works.
839.845	We didn't understand
839.845	these processes before
842.251	because the rest of the world
842.251	is messed up.
845.086	We could understand it here, though.
846.993	These colleagues propose
846.993	that, yes, we can
850.37	save other areas,
852.077	including deserts.
854.172	If we could establish forests
854.172	in those other areas,
857.597	we can reverse climate change,
859.709	including global warming.
862.324	I have a dear colleague in India,
864.54	whose name is Suprabha Seshan,
864.54	and she has a motto.
867.614	Her motto is,
867.614	"""Gardening back the biosphere,"""
871.928	"""Reajardinando a biosfera"" in Portuguese."
874.286	She does a wonderful job
874.286	rebuilding ecosystems.
877.284	We need to do this.
879.851	Having closed this quick introduction,
884.036	we see the reality that we have out here,
887.622	which is drought, this climate change,
890.632	things that we already knew.
892.515	I'd like to tell you a short story.
896.649	Once, about four years ago,
900.282	I attended a declamation,
900.282	of a text by Davi Kopenawa,
904.169	a wise representative
904.169	of the Yanomami people,
907.267	and it went more or less like this:
909.462	"""Doesn't the white man know"
912.087	that, if he destroys the forest,
912.087	there will be no more rain?
915.478	And that, if there's no more rain,
917.241	"there'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?"""
920.464	I heard that, and my eyes welled up
923.145	"and I went, ""Oh, my!"
924.588	I've been studying this for 20 years,
924.588	with a super computer,
928.904	dozens, thousands of scientists,
931.034	and we are starting to get to this
931.034	"conclusion, which he already knows!"""
934.712	A critical point is the Yanomami
934.712	have never deforested.
939.746	How could they know the rain would end?
942.385	This bugged me and I was befuddled.
946.327	How could he know that?
947.773	Some months later,
947.773	I met him at another event and said,
951.536	"""Davi, how did you know that if the forest"
951.536	"was destroyed, there'd be no more rain?"""
957.342	He replied:
957.342	"""The spirit of the forest told us."""
962.157	For me, this was a game changer,
966.744	a radical change.
968.447	"I said, ""Gosh!"
969.866	Why am I doing all this science
974.105	to get to a conclusion
974.105	"that he already knows?"""
977.167	Then, something 
977.167	absolutely critical hit me,
983.174	which is,
987.697	seeing is believing.
991.932	Out of sight, out of mind.
995.14	This is a need the previous speaker
995.14	pointed out:
999.928	We need to see things --
1002.712	I mean, we, Western society,
1004.9	which is becoming global, civilized --
1007.262	we need to see.
1008.665	If we don't see,
1008.665	we don't register the information.
1011.188	We live in ignorance.
1012.932	So, I propose the following --
1014.822	of course, the astronomer
1014.822	wouldn't like the idea --
1017.274	but let's turn the Hubble telescope
1017.274	upside down.
1020.13	And let's make it look down here,
1022.547	rather than to the far reaches
1022.547	of the universe.
1024.797	The universe is wonderful,
1026.539	but we have a practical reality,
1028.914	which is we live in an unknown cosmos,
1032.734	and we're ignorant about it.
1034.117	We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos
1037.787	that shelters us and houses us.
1039.826	Talk to any astrophysicist.
1041.492	The Earth is a statistical improbability.
1044.778	The stability and comfort that we enjoy,
1044.778	despite the droughts of the Negro River,
1048.976	and all the heat and cold
1048.976	and typhoons, etc.,
1051.939	there is nothing like it in the universe,
1051.939	that we know of.
1054.673	Then, let's turn Hubble in our direction,
1056.922	and let's look at the Earth.
1061.431	Let's start with the Amazon!
1063.541	Let's dive,
1064.92	let's reach out the reality
1064.92	we live in every day,
1069.466	and look carefully at it,
1069.466	since that's what we need.
1072.693	Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this.
1074.624	He has something already
1074.624	that I think I missed.
1077.003	I was educated by television.
1078.678	I think that I missed this,
1080.589	an ancestral record,
1082.484	a valuation of what I don't know,
1082.484	what I haven't seen.
1086.864	He is not a doubting Thomas.
1088.986	He believes, 
1088.986	with veneration and reverence,
1092.192	in what his ancestors
1092.192	and the spirits taught him.
1095.563	We can't do it,
1095.563	so let's look into the forest.
1098.337	Even with Hubble up there --
1101.543	this is a bird's-eye view, right?
1103.888	Even when this happens,
1105.758	we also see something that we don't know.
1108.862	The Spanish called it the green inferno.
1111.148	If you go out there
1111.148	into the bushes and get lost,
1114.018	and, let's say, if you head west,
1116.256	it's 900 kilometers to Colombia,
1118.225	and another 1,000 to somewhere else.
1120.162	So, you can figure out
1120.162	why they called it the green inferno.
1123.309	But go and look at what is in there.
1126.563	It is a live carpet.
1128.054	Each color you see is a tree species.
1130.35	Each tree, each tree top,
1132.135	has up to 10,000 species of insects in it,
1136.691	let alone the millions of species
1136.691	of fungi, bacteria, etc.
1140.749	All invisible.
1142.401	All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us
1145.645	than the galaxies billions
1145.645	of light years away from the Earth,
1148.554	which Hubble brings
1148.554	to our newspapers everyday.
1152.983	I'm going to end my talk here --
1154.853	I have a few seconds left --
1156.664	by showing you this wonderful being.
1158.708	When we see the morpho butterfly
1158.708	in the forest,
1161.596	we feel like someone's left open
1161.596	the door to heaven,
1164.431	and this creature escaped from there,
1164.431	because it's so beautiful.
1167.632	However, I cannot finish
1170.017	without showing you a tech side.
1172.548	We are tech-arrogant.
1175.758	We deprive nature of its technology.
1179.049	A robotic hand is technological,
1180.773	mine is biological,
1182.15	and we don't think about it anymore.
1183.913	Let's then look at the morpho butterfly,
1186.015	an example of an invisible
1186.015	technological competence of life,
1191.456	which is at the very heart of our
1191.456	possibility of surviving on this planet,
1196.083	and let's zoom in on it.
1196.083	Again, Hubble is there.
1198.348	Let's get into the butterfly's wings.
1200.262	Scholars have tried to explain:
1200.262	Why is it blue?
1204.465	Let's zoom in on it.
1205.935	What you see is that the architecture
1205.935	of the invisible humiliates
1211.011	the best architects in the world.
1214.043	All of this on a tiny scale.
1216.44	Besides its beauty and functioning,
1216.44	there is another side to it.
1219.968	In nature,
1222.166	all that is organized in extraordinary
1222.166	structures has a function.
1226.529	This function of the morpho butterfly —
1226.529	it is not blue;
1231.019	it does not have blue pigments.
1232.673	It has photonic crystals on its surface,
1232.673	according to people who studied it,
1236.717	which are extremely 
1236.717	sophisticated crystals.
1238.968	Our technology had
1238.968	nothing like that at the time.
1242.427	Hitachi has now made a monitor
1245.208	that uses this technology,
1246.563	and it is used in optical fibers
1246.563	to transmit --
1248.94	Janine Benyus, who's been here several
1248.94	times, talks about it: biomimetics.
1253.35	My time's up.
1254.702	Then, I'll wrap it up with
1254.702	what is at the base of this capacity,
1260.012	of this competence of biodiversity,
1262.584	producing all these wonderful services:
1265.006	the living cell.
1266.913	It is a structure with a few microns,
1266.913	which is an internal wonder.
1270.427	There are TED Talks about it.
1270.427	I won't talk much longer,
1273.454	but each person in this room,
1273.454	including myself,
1276.628	has 100 trillion of these
1276.628	micromachines in their body,
1280.319	so that we can enjoy well-being.
1283.159	Imagine what is out there
1283.159	in the Amazon forest:
	than the number of stars in the sky.
1289.927	And we are not aware of it.
1291.985	Thank you so much. (Applause)
