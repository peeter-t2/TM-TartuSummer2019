12.58	I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,
15.74	and through a combination
15.74	of accidents and cosmic justice,
20.78	became a chef in the US.
22.7	(Laughter)
24.5	When I first arrived in New York,
26.94	I began working in these restaurants --
26.94	different types of restaurants --
30.42	from French bistro to Italian,
33.14	global ethnic to modern American.
36.1	At the time,
37.38	New York was already well-established
37.38	as a food capital of the world.
41.9	However ...
44.62	with the exception of a few West African
44.62	and Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,
50.38	there was no such thing
50.38	as African cuisine in the entire city.
55.58	Early in my life,
57.1	I was influenced
57.1	by Senegal's first president,
60.1	Léopold Sédar Senghor,
62.82	"nicknamed, ""the poet president,"""
65.06	who talked about a new humanism,
67.42	a universal civilization,
68.82	in which all cultures would come together
68.82	around a communal table as equals,
74.86	each bringing its own beautiful
74.86	contribution to share.
79.5	"He called it ""the rendezvous"
79.5	"of giving and receiving."""
84.02	That concept resonated with me,
86.34	and it has guided my career path.
89.3	After years of working in restaurants,
92.42	I yearned for my work
92.42	to have a deeper impact
95.58	that would go beyond
95.58	the last meal I had served.
100.42	I wanted to give back, both to New York --
103.38	the city that allowed me
103.38	the opportunity to follow my calling --
107.46	but also to my origins
107.46	and ancestors in Senegal.
112.46	I wanted to contribute
112.46	to that universal civilization
115.42	Senghor had described.
117.7	But I didn't know how to make
117.7	a measurable impact
120.3	as a cook and writer.
123.5	While I was writing my first cookbook,
126.82	I often traveled to different regions
126.82	of Senegal for research.
132.38	During one of those trips,
134.54	in the remote, southeast
134.54	region of Kédougou
138.26	I rediscovered
138.26	an ancient grain called fonio
142.5	that had all but disappeared
142.5	from the urban Senegalese diet.
148.5	It turns out that fonio
148.5	had been cultivated
151.38	for more than five thousand years
153.98	and is probably the oldest
153.98	cultivated cereal in Africa.
158.58	Once a popular grain
158.58	on much of the continent,
162.82	fonio was grown
162.82	all the way to ancient Egypt,
166.5	where archaeologists found grains
166.5	inside pyramids' burial grounds.
172.7	Today it is mostly cultivated
172.7	in the western part of the Sahel region,
178.46	from Senegal to Mali,
180.78	Burkina Faso,
182.1	Togo, Nigeria.
184.9	The Sahel region is that semiarid area
184.9	south of the Sahara desert
190.78	that extends from the Atlantic
190.78	in the west to the Red Sea in the east.
197.38	I became more interested in this grain
201.1	that was deemed worth taking
201.1	to the afterlife by early Egyptians.
206.94	As I continued my research,
209.1	I found out that fonio was actually --
213.98	wherever it was cultivated --
215.98	there was always some myth,
215.98	or some superstition connected to it.
220.58	The Dogon,
222.06	another great culture in Mali,
223.94	"called it ""po,"""
225.62	"or, ""the seed of the universe."""
228.3	In that ancient culture's mythology,
230.66	the entire universe
230.66	sprouted from a seed of fonio.
236.26	Aside from its purported
236.26	mystical properties,
239.3	fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.
243.34	It is nutritious,
244.9	particularly rich
244.9	in methionine and cysteine,
248.7	two amino acids that are deficient
248.7	in most other major grains:
253.1	barley, rice or wheat to name a few.
257.34	In addition,
258.66	fonio cultivation
258.66	is great for the environment.
262.58	It tolerates poor soil
264.62	and needs very little water,
266.38	surviving where nothing else will grow.
271.5	As a chef,
272.98	what first struck me was
272.98	its delicate taste and its versatility.
279.78	Similar to couscous,
282.82	fonio has a delicious,
282.82	nutty and earthy flavor.
287.9	It can be turned into salad,
290.22	served as noodles,
292.34	used in baking
293.98	or simply as a substitute for any
293.98	other grains in your favorite recipes.
299.7	I am happy to share some of my
299.7	fonio sushi and sweet potato sushi
306.1	with some of you right now.
308.22	(Audience) Oh!
310.14	(Applause)
312.66	And okra.
319.3	(Audience murmurs)
323.42	In Kédougou
325.14	"it is also nicknamed ""ñamu buur,"""
328.46	"which means ""food for royalty,"""
330.98	and it's served for guests of honor.
333.98	Located at the border
333.98	with Guinea and Mali,
338.46	Kédougou first strikes visitors
338.46	with its stunning vistas
341.9	and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.
345.02	Sadly, it is also one of the poorest
345.02	regions of Senegal.
352.14	Because of desertification
352.14	and lack of job prospects,
355.98	much of Kédougou's
355.98	young population has left.
360.06	They chose the deadly path of migration
363.02	"in search of ""better"" opportunities."
366.74	Often,
368.86	they risk their lives
368.86	trying to reach Europe.
372.9	Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.
376.38	Others end up on inadequate wooden canoes
379.78	in desperate attempts to reach Spain.
384.1	"According to a recent ""Guardian"" article,"
386.74	by 2020 more that 60 million people
386.74	from sub-Saharan Africa
392.58	are expected to migrate
394.94	due to desertification.
396.9	This is the biggest global wave
396.9	of migration since the Second World War,
402.78	and it's only set to grow.
405.9	So far this year,
407.98	more that 2,100 migrants
407.98	have lost their lives
412.1	on their way to Europe.
414.9	This is the reality of Kédougou
417.9	and of much of the Sahel today.
421.34	Scary future,
423.22	scarce food
425.02	and no opportunities
425.02	to change their situation.
429.86	If life in your village
429.86	weren't so precarious,
434.26	if there was a way
434.26	to having enough food to get by,
437.66	or having a paying job --
440.62	if you and your sisters
441.98	didn't have to spend
447.34	fetching water,
450.06	if conditions were just
450.06	a little more hospitable ...
455.62	could the solution
455.62	be right here in our soil?
460.1	Could bringing fonio
460.1	to the rest of the world
463.02	be the answer?
466.34	Ancient grains are getting more popular,
468.5	and sales of gluten-free items
468.5	are growing in the US --
476.54	making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.
482.78	How could fonio
482.78	partake in this market share?
487.78	There are many challenges
487.78	in turning fonio into food.
491.18	Traditional processing
491.18	is laborious and time-consuming,
494.66	especially when compared to other grains.
500.54	Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.
505.34	And there are now machines
507.98	that can process fonio
507.98	in a more efficient way.
511.62	And as a matter of fact,
514.02	a few years ago,
515.66	Sanoussi Diakité,
517.14	a Senegalese engineer,
518.42	won a Rolex prize
520.66	for his invention of the first
520.66	mechanized fonio processor.
525.58	Today, such machines are making life
525.58	much easier for producers
530.499	around the whole Sahel region.
534.66	Another challenge
534.66	is the colonial mentality
538.94	that what comes from the west is best.
543.18	This tendency to look down
543.18	on our own products
546.22	and to see crops like fonio
546.22	"as simply ""country peoples' food,"""
550.58	therefore substandard,
552.46	explains why even though we don't
552.46	produce wheat in Senegal traditionally,
557.62	it is far easier to find baguettes
557.62	or croissants in the streets of Dakar
562.1	than it is to find any fonio products.
566.82	This same mindset popularized
566.82	the overprocessed, leftover rice debris
573.22	"known as ""broken rice,"""
576.94	which was imported to Senegal
576.94	from Indochina
580.5	and introduced by the colonial French.
585.42	Soon, broken rice became
585.42	a key ingredient in our national dish,
590.18	thiéboudienne,
591.46	replacing our own traditional,
591.46	more nutritious African rice,
596.94	Oryza glaberrima.
599.9	Ironically, the same African rice
599.9	despised at home
603.82	was hailed abroad.
605.26	Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,
609.3	this rice became
609.3	a major crop in the Americas ...
614.38	particularly in the Carolinas
615.94	"where it was nicknamed, ""Carolina gold."""
620.46	But let's return to fonio.
623.66	How can we turn its current status
623.66	"of ""country-people food"""
628.18	into a world-class crop?
632.38	Last year,
633.98	a business partner and I secured
633.98	a commitment from Whole Foods Market,
638.42	the US's largest natural food store chain,
641.82	to carry fonio.
643.82	And we got a large
643.82	American ingredient importer
648.74	interested enough
648.74	to send a team of executives
651.78	to West Africa with us
653.62	to explore the supply chain's viability.
658.02	We found ourselves
658.02	observing manual operations
663.18	in remote locations
665.54	with few controls over quality.
668.62	So we started focusing
668.62	on processing issues.
672.78	We drew up a vision
674.5	with a beneficial and commercially
674.5	sustainable supply chain for fonio,
679.3	and we connected ourselves
679.3	with organizations
682.18	that can help us achieve it.
685.18	Walking backwards from the market,
685.18	here is what it looks like.
689.46	Imagine that fonio
689.46	is consumed all across the globe
695.74	as other popular ancient grains.
701.14	Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,
704.22	breads,
705.86	nutrition bars,
708.22	cookies, pastas,
709.94	snacks -- why not?
712.38	It's easier to say than quinoa.
714.42	(Laughter)
717.66	(Applause)
723.9	To get there,
725.42	fonio needs to be readily available
727.86	at a consistent quality
727.86	for commercial users,
730.62	such as food manufacturers
730.62	and restaurant chains.
734.46	That's the part we're missing.
736.86	To make fonio available
736.86	at a consistent quality
739.94	for commercial use,
741.7	you need a commercial-scale fonio mill
745.14	that adheres to international
745.14	quality standards.
749.18	Currently, there is no such mill
749.18	in the whole world,
753.06	so in our vision,
754.74	there is an African-owned
754.74	and operated fonio mill
759.3	that processes efficiently
761.82	and in compliance with the requirements
761.82	of multinational food companies.
768.18	It is very difficult
768.18	for the fonio producers today
773.5	to sell and use fonio
776.06	unless they devote
776.06	a huge amount of time and energy
779.94	in threshing, winnowing and husking it.
783.26	In our vision,
784.58	the mill will take on those tasks,
787.3	allowing the producers to focus
787.3	on farming rather than processing.
794.22	There is untapped
794.22	agricultural capacity in the Sahel,
799.82	and all it takes
799.82	is changing market conditions
803.9	to activate that capacity.
806.86	By relieving fonio producers
806.86	of manual operations,
811.7	the mill will free up their time
814.02	and remove the production bottleneck
814.02	that limits their output.
819.1	And there are other benefits as well
821.34	in using Sahel land for agriculture.
827.66	More benefits,
829.7	higher employment,
832.1	climate change mitigation
832.1	by reversing desertification
837.18	and greater food security.
839.5	Nice vision, right?
841.94	Well, we are working
841.94	towards getting it done.
845.06	Last month we introduced fonio
845.06	to shoppers in New York City
849.34	and online,
850.58	in a package that makes it attractive
850.58	and desirable and accessible.
856.26	(Applause)
863.82	We are talking with operators
863.82	and investors in West Africa
868.54	about building a fonio mill.
871.26	And most importantly,
872.9	we have teamed with an NGO
872.9	called SOS SAHEL
876.1	to recruit, train and equip
876.1	smallholders in the Sahel
881.02	to increase their fonio production.
884.42	Hunger levels are higher
884.42	in sub-Saharan Africa
887.58	than any other place in the world.
891.34	The Sahel population is set to grow
894.78	from 135 million to 340 million people.
900.14	However, in that drought-
900.14	and famine-prone region,
904.78	fonio grows freely.
908.18	This tiny grain may provide big answers,
911.78	reasserting its Dogon name,
914.26	"""po,"" the seed of the universe,"
917.06	and taking us one step closer
919.26	to the universal civilization.
922.34	Thank you.
923.94	(Applause)
