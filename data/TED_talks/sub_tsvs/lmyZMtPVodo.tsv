12.98	There's a man by the name of Captain
15.24	William Swenson
17.57	who recently was awarded the
17.57	congressional Medal of Honor
20.772	for his actions on September 8, 2009.
25.63	On that day, a column of American
27.995	and Afghan troops
29.279	were making their way
30.756	through a part of Afghanistan
33.64	to help protect
36.913	a group of government officials,
38.008	a group of Afghan government officials,
39.854	who would be meeting with some local
42.22	village elders.
43.723	The column came under ambush,
45.99	and was surrounded on three sides,
48.497	and amongst many other things,
51.437	Captain Swenson was recognized
52.843	for running into live fire
55.06	to rescue the wounded
56.241	and pull out the dead.
60.464	One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,
63.32	and he and a comrade were making their way
65.758	to a medevac helicopter.
68.048	And what was remarkable about this day
70.236	is, by sheer coincidence,
72.227	one of the medevac medics
73.907	happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet
76.295	and captured the whole scene on camera.
81.057	It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade
84.263	bringing this wounded soldier
85.489	who had received a gunshot to the neck.
90.039	They put him in the helicopter,
93.532	and then you see Captain Swenson bend over
97.86	and give him a kiss
100.043	before he turns around to rescue more.
104.881	I saw this, and I thought to myself,
108.088	where do people like that come from?
110.86	What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,
113.903	when you would want to do that.
115.604	There's a love there,
117.644	and I wanted to know why is it that
119.778	I don't have people that I work with like that?
122.462	You know, in the military, they give medals
123.88	to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves
126.502	so that others may gain.
128.34	In business, we give bonuses to people
130.268	who are willing to sacrifice others
131.976	so that we may gain.
133.47	We have it backwards. Right?
137.134	So I asked myself, where do
137.134	people like this come from?
139.013	And my initial conclusion was
139.013	that they're just better people.
142.236	That's why they're attracted to the military.
143.756	These better people are attracted
145.217	to this concept of service.
147.963	But that's completely wrong.
149.063	What I learned was that it's the environment,
151.9	and if you get the environment right,
154.07	every single one of us has the capacity
155.793	to do these remarkable things,
157.311	and more importantly, others have that capacity too.
160.142	I've had the great honor of getting to meet
162.587	some of these, who we would call heroes,
165.702	who have put themselves and put their lives
167.604	at risk to save others,
169.203	"and I asked them, ""Why would you do it?"
171.706	"Why did you do it?"""
173.759	And they all say the same thing:
176.66	"""Because they would have done it for me."""
178.76	It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.
181.667	So trust and cooperation are really important here.
184.266	The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation
187.425	is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.
189.73	"I can't simply say to you, ""Trust me,"" and you will."
192.765	I can't simply instruct two people 
192.765	to cooperate, and they will.
196	It's not how it works. It's a feeling.
198.434	So where does that feeling come from?
200.848	If you go back 50,000 years
202.93	to the Paleolithic era,
204.109	to the early days of Homo sapiens,
206.265	what we find is that the world
207.88	was filled with danger,
210.215	all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.
214.607	Nothing personal.
216.106	Whether it was the weather,
218.548	lack of resources,
220.188	maybe a saber-toothed tiger,
221.67	all of these things working
223.005	to reduce our lifespan.
225.141	And so we evolved into social animals,
227.442	where we lived together and worked together
229.417	in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,
232.841	where we felt like we belonged.
234.864	And when we felt safe amongst our own,
237.595	the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
240.803	There are inherent benefits to this.
241.905	It means I can fall asleep at night
243.793	and trust that someone from within
243.793	my tribe will watch for danger.
247.665	If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,
249.997	that means you won't watch for danger.
251.381	Bad system of survival.
253.252	The modern day is exactly the same thing.
255.591	The world is filled with danger,
257.212	things that are trying to frustrate our lives
258.967	or reduce our success,
260.136	reduce our opportunity for success.
261.86	It could be the ups and downs in the economy,
264.229	the uncertainty of the stock market.
266.569	It could be a new technology that renders
268.313	your business model obsolete overnight.
270.47	Or it could be your competition
272.119	that is sometimes trying to kill you.
274.119	It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,
276.004	but at the very minimum
277.715	is working hard to frustrate your growth
280.378	and steal your business from you.
282.508	We have no control over these forces.
284.253	These are a constant,
285.77	and they're not going away.
287.748	The only variable are the conditions
289.794	inside the organization,
292.357	and that's where leadership matters,
294.282	because it's the leader that sets the tone.
296.961	When a leader makes the choice
299.4	to put the safety and lives
300.929	of the people inside the organization first,
303.19	to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice
306.068	the tangible results, so that the people remain
309.573	and feel safe and feel like they belong,
311	remarkable things happen.
313.894	I was flying on a trip,
317.013	and I was witness to an incident
319.128	where a passenger attempted to board
321.016	before their number was called,
324.627	and I watched the gate agent
327.196	treat this man like he had broken the law,
329.62	like a criminal.
331.029	He was yelled at for attempting to board
332.875	one group too soon.
335.246	So I said something.
336.69	"I said, ""Why do you have treat us like cattle?"
339.36	"Why can't you treat us like human beings?"""
342.451	And this is exactly what she said to me.
344.572	"She said, ""Sir, if I don't follow the rules,"
347.258	"I could get in trouble or lose my job."""
350.408	All she was telling me
351.99	is that she doesn't feel safe.
353.646	All she was telling me is that
355.987	she doesn't trust her leaders.
359.206	The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines
361.928	is not because they necessarily hire better people.
364.395	It's because they don't fear their leaders.
367.434	You see, if the conditions are wrong,
369.356	we are forced to expend our own time and energy
371.615	to protect ourselves from each other,
374.479	and that inherently weakens the organization.
377.778	When we feel safe inside the organization,
379.409	we will naturally combine our talents
381.603	and our strengths and work tirelessly
383.749	to face the dangers outside
385.431	and seize the opportunities.
388.566	The closest analogy I can give
389.887	to what a great leader is, is like being a parent.
393.099	If you think about what being a great parent is,
394.758	what do you want? What makes a great parent?
396.588	We want to give our child opportunities,
397.94	education, discipline them when necessary,
400.658	all so that they can grow up and achieve more
402.694	than we could for ourselves.
405.259	Great leaders want exactly the same thing.
407	They want to provide their people opportunity,
408.501	education, discipline when necessary,
410.288	build their self-confidence, give
410.288	them the opportunity to try and fail,
413.45	all so that they could achieve more
415.161	than we could ever imagine for ourselves.
419.591	Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of
419.591	a company called Next Jump
422.728	in New York City, a tech company,
425.478	he makes the point that
426.97	if you had hard times in your family,
429.099	would you ever consider laying
429.099	off one of your children?
432.148	We would never do it.
433.65	Then why do we consider laying off people
435.677	inside our organization?
437.254	Charlie implemented a policy
440.054	of lifetime employment.
441.99	If you get a job at Next Jump,
443.62	you cannot get fired for performance issues.
447.08	In fact, if you have issues,
449.063	they will coach you and they will give you support,
452.11	just like we would with one of our children
453.571	who happens to come home with a C from school.
456.41	It's the complete opposite.
457.363	This is the reason so many people
458.98	have such a visceral hatred, anger,
463.244	at some of these banking CEOs
464.912	with their disproportionate
464.912	salaries and bonus structures.
467.74	It's not the numbers.
469.71	It's that they have violated the
469.71	very definition of leadership.
472.548	They have violated this deep-seated social contract.
475.442	We know that they allowed their people
477.045	to be sacrificed so they could
477.045	protect their own interests,
479.56	or worse, they sacrificed their people
482.752	to protect their own interests.
484.212	This is what so offends us, not the numbers.
487.023	Would anybody be offended if we gave
488.62	a $150 million bonus to Gandhi?
491.193	How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?
494.232	Do we have an issue with that? None at all.
496.966	None at all.
498.298	Great leaders would never sacrifice
500.509	the people to save the numbers.
501.87	They would sooner sacrifice the numbers
503.549	to save the people.
506.528	Bob Chapman, who runs
508.651	a large manufacturing company in the Midwest
510.964	called Barry-Wehmiller,
513.04	in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,
518.397	and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.
522.398	Now in a large manufacturing company,
523.784	this is a big deal,
525.325	and they could no longer afford their labor pool.
528.172	They needed to save 10 million dollars,
529.875	so, like so many companies today,
531.898	the board got together and discussed layoffs.
535.292	And Bob refused.
536.916	You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.
541.168	Bob believes in heart counts,
544.609	and it's much more difficult to simply reduce
547.117	the heart count.
548.847	And so they came up with a furlough program.
551.854	Every employee, from secretary to CEO,
553.945	was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.
557.411	They could take it any time they wanted,
559.322	and they did not have to take it consecutively.
562.303	But it was how Bob announced the program
563.635	that mattered so much.
565.532	He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little
568.18	than any of us should have to suffer a lot,
570.965	and morale went up.
574.083	They saved 20 million dollars,
577.01	and most importantly, as would be expected,
579.447	when the people feel safe and protected
579.447	by the leadership in the organization,
582.676	the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.
585.183	And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,
587.94	people started trading with each other.
589.856	Those who could afford it more
591.352	would trade with those who could afford it less.
593.429	People would take five weeks
594.918	so that somebody else only had to take three.
599.08	Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.
602.014	I know many people at the seniormost
603.722	levels of organizations
604.88	who are absolutely not leaders.
606.484	They are authorities, and we do what they say
609.037	because they have authority over us,
612.08	but we would not follow them.
613.94	And I know many people
615.974	who are at the bottoms of organizations
617.336	who have no authority
618.599	and they are absolutely leaders,
620.662	and this is because they have chosen to look after
622.447	the person to the left of them,
623.965	and they have chosen to look after
625.243	the person to the right of them.
627.037	This is what a leader is.
631.77	I heard a story
634.8	of some Marines
636.39	who were out in theater,
639.711	and as is the Marine custom,
641.757	the officer ate last,
644.082	and he let his men eat first,
647.258	and when they were done,
649.11	there was no food left for him.
653.2	And when they went back out in the field,
655.933	his men brought him some of their food
658.877	so that he may eat,
660.734	because that's what happens.
662.873	We call them leaders because they go first.
665.562	We call them leaders because they take the risk
667.305	before anybody else does.
668.96	We call them leaders because they will choose
670.99	to sacrifice so that their people
672.999	may be safe and protected
674.118	and so their people may gain,
676.254	and when we do, the natural response
679.308	is that our people will sacrifice for us.
683.155	They will give us their blood and sweat and tears
685.653	to see that their leader's vision comes to life,
689.092	"and when we ask them, ""Why would you do that?"
691.864	Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears
694.251	"for that person?"" they all say the same thing:"
698.735	"""Because they would have done it for me."""
701.233	And isn't that the organization
703.383	we would all like to work in?
705.704	Thank you very much.
708.261	Thank you. (Applause)
711.862	Thank you. (Applause)
