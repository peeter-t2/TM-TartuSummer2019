12.737	I would like to show you how
15.646	architecture has helped
18.523	to change the life of my community
21.618	and has opened opportunities to hope.
26.433	I am a native of Burkina Faso.
29.392	According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso
32.61	is one of the poorest countries in the world,
35.659	but what does it look like
38.506	to grow up in a place like that?
41.925	I am an example of that.
44.485	I was born in a little village called Gando.
48.393	In Gando, there was no electricity,
52.885	no access to clean drinking water, and no school.
57.099	But my father wanted me
59.923	to learn how to read and write.
61.972	For this reason, I had to leave my family
66.02	when I was seven and to stay in a city
69.914	far away from my village
71.902	with no contact with my family.
75.579	In this place I sat
79	in a class like that
81.226	with more than 150 other kids,
84.978	and for six years.
87.47	In this time, it just happened to me to come to school
91.55	to realize that my classmate died.
97.245	Today, not so much has changed.
101.758	There is still no electricity in my village.
106.211	People still are dying in Burkina Faso,
108.673	and access to clean drinking water
112.276	is still a big problem.
116.499	I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life
124.051	when you grow up in a place like that.
126.803	But I was lucky.
129.172	I had a scholarship.
131.256	I could go to Germany to study.
135.466	So now, I suppose,
139.371	I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege
144.045	it is for me to be standing before you today.
148.502	From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,
152.874	to Berlin in Germany to become an architect
157.18	is a big, big step.
162.345	But what to do with this privilege?
167.997	Since I was a student, I wanted to open up
171.952	better opportunities to other kids in Gando.
174.595	I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.
177.51	But how do you do it when you're still a student
180.494	and you don't have money?
182.576	Oh yes, I started to make drawings
185.078	and asked for money.
187.06	Fundraising was not an easy task.
191.039	I even asked my classmates
193.838	to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,
197.016	but to sponsor my school project.
200.984	In real wonder, two years later,
204	I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.
210.534	When I came home to Gando
213.497	to bring the good news,
215.022	my people were over the moon,
219.171	but when they realized
221.792	that I was planning to use clay,
224.636	they were shocked.
226.719	"""A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,"
230.262	and Francis wants us to use it and build a school.
235.371	Is this the reason why he spent so much time
238.135	in Europe studying
240.148	"instead of working in the field with us?"""
244.247	My people build all the time with clay,
248.54	but they don't see any innovation with mud.
253.461	So I had to convince everybody.
255.65	I started to speak with the community,
259.033	and I could convince everybody,
261.496	and we could start to work.
264.506	And the women, the men,
266.27	everybody from the village,
268.315	was part of this building process.
270.332	I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.
274.041	So clay floor for example,
276.204	the young men come and stand like that, beating,
280.6	hours for hours,
282.196	and then their mothers came,
283.908	and they are beating in this position,
287.642	for hours, giving water and beating.
292.258	And then the polishers come.
293.886	They start polishing it with a stone for hours.
298.944	And then you have this result,
303.901	very fine, like a baby bottom.
307.21	(Laughter)
308.983	It's not photoshopped. (Laughter)
314.248	This is the school, built with the community.
317.232	The walls are totally made out
319.022	of compressed clay blocks from Gando.
323.122	The roof structure is made
326.276	with cheap steel bars
329.098	normally hiding inside concrete.
332.994	And the classroom, the ceiling is made
336.062	out of both of them used together.
338.817	In this school, there was a simple idea:
341.727	to create comfort in a classroom.
345.437	Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,
350.608	so with simple ventilation,
352.542	I wanted to make the classroom
354.592	good for teaching and learning.
357.201	And this is the project today,
363.68	And the kids, they love it.
369.936	And for me and my community,
372.791	this project was a huge success.
376.446	It has opened up opportunities
379.348	to do more projects in Gando.
381.939	So I could do a lot of projects,
384.877	and here I am going to share with you
387.201	only three of them.
389.381	The first one is the school extension, of course.
393.177	How do you explain drawings and engineering
396.492	to people who are neither able to read nor write?
400.144	I started to build a prototype like that.
403.091	The innovation was to build a clay vault.
406.077	So then, I jumped on the top like that,
409.408	with my team, and it works.
411.72	The community is looking. It still works.
413.947	So we can build. (Laughter)
416.805	And we kept building, and that is the result.
420.688	The kids are happy, and they love it.
424.322	The community is very proud. We made it.
428.483	And even animals, like these donkeys,
432.624	love our buildings.
434.384	(Laughter)
438.031	The next project is the library in Gando.
442.698	And see now, we tried to introduce
446.361	different ideas in our buildings,
448.876	but we often don't have so much material.
452.707	Something we have in Gando are clay pots.
456.11	We wanted to use them to create openings.
459.431	So we just bring them like you can see
461.541	to the building site.
463.967	we start cutting them,
466.133	and then we place them on top of the roof
469.064	before we pour the concrete,
471.643	and you have this result.
473.654	The openings are letting the hot air out
476.564	and light in.
478.403	Very simple.
480.476	My most recent project in Gando
483.314	is a high school project.
485.332	I would like to share with you this.
487.265	The innovation in this project
489.51	is to cast mud like you cast concrete.
494.253	How do you cast mud?
496.378	We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,
499.644	and when everything is ready,
501.767	when you know what is the best recipe
503.904	and the best form,
505.098	you start working with the community.
507.749	And sometimes I can leave.
509.895	They will do it themselves.
511.654	I came to speak to you like that.
515.206	Another factor in Gando is rain.
517.897	When the rains come,
519.721	we hurry up to protect our fragile walls
522.009	against the rain.
525.061	Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
528.573	It is simply how we protect our walls.
531.138	(Laughter)
532.607	The rain in Burkina comes very fast,
535.485	and after that, you have floods
538.05	everywhere in the country.
540.995	But for us, the rain is good.
544.045	It brings sand and gravel to the river
547.95	we need to use to build.
550.221	We just wait for the rain to go.
552.122	We take the sand, we mix it with clay,
555.716	and we keep building.
558.502	That is it.
560.307	The Gando project was always
560.307	connected to training the people,
563.401	because I just wanted, one day
566.893	when I fall down and die,
569.796	that at least one person from Gando
572.48	keeps doing this work.
576.222	But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.
579.065	(Laughter)
580.615	And my people now can use their skills
583.792	to earn money themselves.
588.83	Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,
592.793	you have to leave the country
594.889	to the city, sometimes leave the country
598.132	and some never come back,
600.124	making the community weaker.
603.568	But now they can stay in the country
607.245	and work on different building sites
609.437	and earn money to feed their family.
611.324	There's a new quality in this work.
616.278	Yes, you know it.
618.474	I have won a lot of awards through this work.
623.128	For sure, it has opened opportunities.
626.809	I have become myself known.
629.201	But the reason why I do what I do
634.091	is my community.
637.566	When I was a kid,
639.68	I was going to school,
641.463	I was coming back every holiday to Gando.
645.494	By the end of every holidays,
647.637	I had to say goodbye to the community,
650.681	going from one compound to another one.
654.427	All women in Gando will open their clothes like that
659.658	and give me the last penny.
663.593	In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.
668.714	As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.
671.897	I just asked my mother one day,
674.487	"""Why do all these women love me so much?"""
677.23	(Laughter)
678.979	She just answered,
681.314	"""They are contributing to pay for your education"
685.095	hoping that you will be successful
688.44	and one day come back and help
691.538	"improve the quality of life of the community."""
695.57	I hope now that I was able
695.57	to make my community proud
700.448	through this work,
702.321	and I hope I was able to prove you the power
706.133	of community,
707.772	and to show you that architecture
711.499	can be inspiring for communities
716.188	to shape their own future.
718.441	Merci beaucoup. (Applause)
720.828	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
725.169	Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
