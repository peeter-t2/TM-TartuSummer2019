15.807	I thought I'd talk a little bit
15.807	about how nature makes materials.
18.998	I brought along with me an abalone shell.
21.212	This abalone shell
21.212	is a biocomposite material
23.811	that's 98 percent by mass
23.811	calcium carbonate
26.684	and two percent by mass protein.
29.239	Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher
29.239	than its geological counterpart.
32.959	And a lot of people might use
32.959	structures like abalone shells,
36.422	like chalk.
37.598	I've been fascinated
37.598	by how nature makes materials,
40.413	and there's a lot of secrets
40.413	to how they do such an exquisite job.
43.792	Part of it is that these materials
43.792	are macroscopic in structure,
48.084	but they're formed at the nano scale.
49.967	They're formed at the nano scale,
51.659	and they use proteins
51.659	that are coded by the genetic level
55.316	that allow them to build
55.316	these really exquisite structures.
58.149	So something I think
58.149	is very fascinating is:
60.405	What if you could give life
60.405	to non-living structures,
64.686	like batteries and like solar cells?
66.96	What if they had
66.96	some of the same capabilities
69.268	that an abalone shell did,
70.96	in terms of being able
70.96	to build really exquisite structures
74.666	at room temperature and room pressure,
76.523	using nontoxic chemicals
78.592	and adding no toxic materials
78.592	back into the environment?
81.315	So that's kind of the vision
81.315	that I've been thinking about.
84.597	And so what if you could grow
84.597	a battery in a Petri dish?
87.287	Or what if you could give
87.287	genetic information to a battery
90.201	so that it could actually become
90.201	better as a function of time, and do so
94.027	in an environmentally friendly way?
96.195	And so, going back to this abalone shell,
99.29	besides being nanostructured,
99.29	one thing that's fascinating is,
102.379	when a male and female
102.379	abalone get together,
104.871	they pass on the genetic
104.871	information that says,
107.1	"""This is how to build"
107.1	an exquisite material.
109.56	Here's how to do it at room
109.56	temperature and pressure,
112.084	"using nontoxic materials."""
113.414	Same with diatoms,
113.414	which are shown right here,
115.602	which are glasseous structures.
117.249	Every time the diatoms replicate,
118.96	they give the genetic
118.96	information that says,
121.05	"""Here's how to build glass in the ocean"
121.05	"that's perfectly nanostructured."""
124.738	And you can do it the same,
124.738	"over and over again."""
127.055	So what if you could do the same thing
127.055	with a solar cell or a battery?
130.399	I like to say my favorite
130.399	biomaterial is my four year old.
133.96	But anyone who's ever had
133.96	or knows small children knows,
137.221	they're incredibly complex organisms.
139.261	If you wanted to convince them to do
139.261	something they don't want to do,
142.981	it's very difficult.
144.163	So when we think
144.163	about future technologies,
146.203	we actually think of using
146.203	bacteria and viruses --
149.445	simple organisms.
150.677	Can you convince them
150.677	to work with a new toolbox,
153.357	so they can build a structure
153.357	that will be important to me?
156.631	Also, when we think
156.631	about future technologies,
158.956	we start with the beginning of Earth.
161.193	Basically, it took a billion years
161.193	to have life on Earth.
164.96	And very rapidly,
164.96	they became multi-cellular,
167.095	they could replicate,
167.095	they could use photosynthesis
169.696	as a way of getting their energy source.
171.657	But it wasn't until about 500
171.657	million years ago --
174.023	during the Cambrian
174.023	geologic time period --
176.079	that organisms in the ocean
176.079	started making hard materials.
179.148	Before that, they were all
179.148	soft, fluffy structures.
182.736	It was during this time
182.736	that there was increased calcium,
185.448	iron and silicon in the environment,
187.328	and organisms learned
187.328	how to make hard materials.
190.594	So that's what I would like
190.594	to be able to do,
192.809	convince biology to work
192.809	with the rest of the periodic table.
196.46	Now, if you look at biology,
198.672	there's many structures like DNA,
198.672	antibodies, proteins and ribosomes
202.514	you've heard about,
203.738	that are nanostructured --
205.208	nature already gives us really exquisite
205.208	structures on the nano scale.
208.74	What if we could harness them
210.463	and convince them to not be an antibody
210.463	that does something like HIV?
215.185	What if we could convince them
215.185	to build a solar cell for us?
219.334	Here are some examples.
220.708	Natural shells,
220.708	natural biological materials.
222.889	The abalone shell here.
224.105	If you fracture it, you can look
224.105	at the fact that it's nanostructured.
227.516	There's diatoms made out of SiO2,
229.668	and there are magnetotactic bacteria
231.55	that make small, single-domain
231.55	magnets used for navigation.
234.96	What all these have in common
236.652	is these materials
236.652	are structured at the nano scale,
239.233	and they have a DNA sequence
239.233	that codes for a protein sequence
242.583	that gives them the blueprint
244.113	to be able to build
244.113	these really wonderful structures.
246.96	Now, going back to the abalone shell,
249.166	the abalone makes this shell
249.166	by having these proteins.
251.77	These proteins
251.77	are very negatively charged.
253.818	They can pull calcium
253.818	out of the environment,
256.017	and put down a layer of calcium
256.017	and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
259.58	It has the chemical sequences
259.58	of amino acids which says,
262.497	"""This is how to build the structure."
264.244	Here's the DNA sequence,
264.244	here's the protein sequence
266.712	"in order to do it."""
267.887	So an interesting idea is,
269.158	what if you could take
269.158	any material you wanted,
271.435	or any element on the periodic table,
273.237	and find its corresponding DNA sequence,
275.619	then code it for a corresponding
275.619	protein sequence to build a structure,
279.33	but not build an abalone shell --
280.99	build something that nature has never had
280.99	the opportunity to work with yet.
286.214	And so here's the periodic table.
288.556	I absolutely love the periodic table.
290.367	Every year for the incoming
290.367	freshman class at MIT,
293.016	I have a periodic table made that says,
294.967	"""Welcome to MIT."
294.967	"Now you're in your element."""
297.128	(Laughter)
298.161	And you flip it over,
298.161	and it's the amino acids
300.474	with the pH at which they have
300.474	different charges.
302.96	And so I give this out
302.96	to thousands of people.
305.96	And I know it says MIT
305.96	and this is Caltech,
308.08	but I have a couple extra
308.08	if people want it.
310.168	I was really fortunate to have
310.168	President Obama visit my lab this year
314.511	on his visit to MIT,
315.924	and I really wanted to give
315.924	him a periodic table.
318.246	So I stayed up at night
318.246	and talked to my husband,
320.612	"""How do I give President Obama"
320.612	a periodic table?
322.892	What if he says,
322.892	'Oh, I already have one,'
324.984	"or, 'I've already memorized it?'"""
326.648	(Laughter)
327.68	So he came to visit my lab and looked
327.68	around -- it was a great visit.
330.984	And then afterward, I said,
332.342	"""Sir, I want to give you"
332.342	the periodic table,
334.729	in case you're ever in a bind
334.729	"and need to calculate molecular weight."""
338.116	(Laughter)
339.226	"I thought ""molecular weight"" sounded"
339.226	"much less nerdy than ""molar mass."""
342.764	(Laughter)
343.859	And he looked at it and said,
346.782	"""Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."""
348.82	(Laughter)
350.96	(Applause)
354.96	Later in a lecture
354.96	that he gave on clean energy,
357.96	he pulled it out and said,
359.284	"""And people at MIT,"
359.284	"they give out periodic tables."" So ..."
362.046	So basically what I didn't tell you
364.378	is that about 500 million years ago,
364.378	the organisms started making materials,
368.003	but it took them about 50 million years
368.003	to get good at it --
	how to make that abalone shell.
374.332	And that's a hard sell
374.332	to a graduate student:
376.48	"""I have this great project ..."
379.041	So we had to develop a way
379.041	of trying to do this more rapidly.
382.569	And so we use a nontoxic virus
382.569	called M13 bacteriophage,
387.346	whose job is to infect bacteria.
389.327	Well, it has a simple DNA structure
391.057	that you can go in and cut and paste
391.057	additional DNA sequences into it,
395.209	and by doing that, it allows the virus
395.209	to express random protein sequences.
399.726	This is pretty easy biotechnology,
401.663	and you could basically
401.663	do this a billion times.
403.934	So you can have
403.934	a billion different viruses
406.268	that are all genetically identical,
407.999	but they differ from each other
407.999	based on their tips,
410.461	on one sequence,
412.086	that codes for one protein.
413.599	Now if you take all billion viruses,
413.599	and put them in one drop of liquid,
417.377	you can force them to interact
417.377	with anything you want
419.91	on the periodic table.
421.115	And through a process
421.115	of selection evolution,
423.256	you can pull one of a billion
423.256	that does something you'd like it to do,
426.584	like grow a battery or a solar cell.
428.362	Basically, viruses can't replicate
428.362	themselves; they need a host.
431.422	Once you find that one out of a billion,
433.41	you infect it into a bacteria,
433.41	and make millions and billions of copies
436.871	of that particular sequence.
438.283	The other thing
438.283	that's beautiful about biology
440.485	is that biology gives you
440.485	really exquisite structures
443.651	with nice link scales.
444.96	These viruses are long and skinny,
446.795	and we can get them to express the ability
448.984	to grow something like semiconductors
450.96	or materials for batteries.
453.09	Now, this is a high-powered
453.09	battery that we grew in my lab.
455.96	We engineered a virus
455.96	to pick up carbon nanotubes.
458.697	One part of the virus
458.697	grabs a carbon nanotube,
460.96	the other part of the virus has a sequence
463.069	that can grow an electrode
463.069	material for a battery,
465.717	and then it wires itself
465.717	to the current collector.
468.44	And so through a process
468.44	of selection evolution,
470.96	we went from being able to have
470.96	a virus that made a crummy battery
474.126	to a virus that made a good battery
475.831	to a virus that made a record-breaking,
475.831	high-powered battery
478.727	that's all made at room temperature,
478.727	basically at the benchtop.
481.918	That battery went to the White House
481.918	for a press conference,
485.412	and I brought it here.
486.847	You can see it in this case
486.847	that's lighting this LED.
489.65	Now if we could scale this,
491.729	you could actually use it
491.729	to run your Prius,
495.713	which is kind of my dream --
495.713	to be able to drive a virus-powered car.
499.081	(Laughter)
500.222	But basically you can pull
500.222	one out of a billion,
504.96	and make lots of amplifications to it.
506.902	Basically, you make
506.902	an amplification in the lab,
509.199	and then you get it to self-assemble
509.199	into a structure like a battery.
512.517	We're able to do this also with catalysis.
514.807	This is the example
514.807	of a photocatalytic splitting of water.
518.762	And what we've been able to do
518.762	is engineer a virus
521.774	to basically take dye-absorbing molecules
524.084	and line them up
524.084	on the surface of the virus
526.163	so it acts as an antenna,
527.498	and you get an energy transfer
527.498	across the virus.
530.195	And then we give it a second gene
530.195	to grow an inorganic material
533.482	that can be used to split water
533.482	into oxygen and hydrogen,
537.498	that can be used for clean fuels.
539.736	I brought an example
539.736	of that with me today.
541.836	My students promised me it would work.
543.678	These are virus-assembled nanowires.
546.129	When you shine light on them,
546.129	you can see them bubbling.
548.96	In this case, you're seeing
548.96	oxygen bubbles come out.
551.919	(Applause)
553.252	Basically, by controlling the genes,
555.96	you can control multiple materials
555.96	to improve your device performance.
559.318	The last example are solar cells.
561.048	You can also do this with solar cells.
562.887	We've been able to engineer viruses
562.887	to pick up carbon nanotubes
566.173	and then grow titanium
566.173	dioxide around them,
570.3	and use it as a way of getting
570.3	electrons through the device.
574.343	And what we've found
574.343	is through genetic engineering,
576.831	we can actually increase
576.831	the efficiencies of these solar cells
581.658	to record numbers
583.659	for these types of dye-sensitized systems.
586.96	And I brought one of those as well,
588.96	that you can play around
588.96	with outside afterward.
592.162	So this is a virus-based solar cell.
594.051	Through evolution and selection,
595.96	we took it from an eight percent
595.96	efficiency solar cell
599.48	to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.
601.588	So I hope that I've convinced you
603.445	that there's a lot of great,
603.445	interesting things to be learned
607.336	about how nature makes materials,
608.96	and about taking it the next step,
610.635	to see if you can force or take advantage
610.635	of how nature makes materials,
615.156	to make things that nature
615.156	hasn't yet dreamed of making.
617.861	Thank you.
619.036	(Applause)
