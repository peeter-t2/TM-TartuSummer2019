12.62	When we think about mapping cities,
14.395	we tend to think about roads
14.395	and streets and buildings,
17.2	and the settlement narrative
17.2	that led to their creation,
20	or you might think about
20	the bold vision of an urban designer,
22.984	but there's other ways
22.984	to think about mapping cities
25.487	and how they got to be made.
27.653	Today, I want to show you
27.653	a new kind of map.
29.746	This is not a geographic map.
31.242	This is a map of the relationships 
31.242	between people in my hometown
34.373	of Baltimore, Maryland,
35.713	and what you can see here is that
35.713	each dot represents a person,
40.13	each line represents a relationship
40.13	between those people,
43.424	and each color represents a community
43.424	within the network.
46.87	Now, I'm here on the green side,
46.87	down on the far right where the geeks are,
51.732	and TEDx also is down 
51.732	on the far right. (Laughter)
55.58	Now, on the other side of the network,
58.157	you tend to have primarily
58.157	African-American and Latino folks
61.117	who are really concerned about somewhat
61.117	different things than the geeks are,
64.707	but just to give some sense,
66.148	the green part of the network 
66.148	we call Smalltimore,
68.554	for those of us that inhabit it,
70.099	because it seems as though
70.099	we're living in a very small town.
73.014	We see the same people
73.014	over and over again,
75.048	but that's because
75.048	we're not really exploring
77.219	the full depth and breadth of the city.
80.081	On the other end of the network,
81.833	you have folks who are interested
81.833	in things like hip-hop music
84.77	and they even identify with living
84.77	in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area
88.574	over, say, the Baltimore city
88.574	designation proper.
92.99	But in the middle, you see that there's
95.09	something that connects
95.09	the two communities together,
97.573	and that's sports.
98.452	We have the Baltimore Orioles,
98.452	the Baltimore Ravens football team,
101.54	Michael Phelps, the Olympian.
102.986	Under Armour, you may have heard of,
102.986	is a Baltimore company,
105.824	and that community of sports
105.824	acts as the only bridge
108.257	between these two ends of the network.
110.528	Let's take a look at San Francisco.
112.423	You see something a little bit
112.423	different happening in San Francisco.
115.609	On the one hand, you do have
115.609	the media, politics and news lobe
120.002	that tends to exist
120.002	in Baltimore and other cities,
122.537	but you also have this
122.537	very predominant group
124.892	of geeks and techies that are sort of
124.892	taking over the top half of the network,
129.285	and there's even a group
129.285	that's so distinct and clear
131.787	that we can identify it
131.787	as Twitter employees,
134.137	next to the geeks, in between
134.137	the gamers and the geeks,
137.504	at the opposite end
137.504	of the hip-hop spectrum.
140.445	So you can see, though,
142.162	that the tensions that we've
142.162	heard about in San Francisco
144.843	in terms of people being
144.843	concerned about gentrification
147.764	and all the new tech companies
147.764	that are bringing new wealth
150.523	and settlement into the city are real,
152.62	and you can actually see
152.62	that documented here.
154.849	You can see the LGBT community
156.869	is not really getting along
156.869	with the geek community that well,
160.165	the arts community, the music community.
162.297	And so it leads to things like this.
164.07	"[""Evict Twitter""]"
165.043	Somebody sent me this photo
165.043	a few weeks ago,
166.867	and it shows what is happening
166.867	on the ground in San Francisco,
169.774	and I think you can
169.774	actually try to understand that
172.158	through looking at a map like this.
173.86	Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.
175.62	I spent the last few weeks
175.62	gathering data about Rio,
178.074	and one of the things
178.074	that stood out to me about this city
180.881	is that everything's
180.881	really kind of mixed up.
183.003	It's a very heterogenous city in a way 
183.003	that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.
187.107	You still have the lobe of people involved
189.562	with government, newspapers,
189.562	politics, columnists.
191.946	TEDxRio is down in the lower right,
191.946	right next to bloggers and writers.
195.35	But then you also have this
195.35	tremendous diversity of people
198.059	that are interested
198.059	in different kinds of music.
200.333	Even Justin Bieber fans
200.333	are represented here.
202.537	Other boy bands, country singers,
205.429	gospel music, funk and rap
205.429	and stand-up comedy,
208.337	and there's even a whole section
208.337	around drugs and jokes.
211.376	How cool is that?
212.862	And then the Flamengo football team
212.862	is also represented here.
215.996	So you have that same kind of spread
218.156	of sports and civics
218.156	and the arts and music,
220.871	but it's represented
220.871	in a very different way,
223.032	and I think that maybe fits
223.032	with our understanding of Rio
226.352	as being a very multicultural,
226.352	musically diverse city.
230.366	So we have all this data.
233.984	It's an incredibly rich set of data
233.984	that we have about cities now,
237.102	maybe even richer than any data set
237.102	that we've ever had before.
240.348	So what can we do with it?
242.272	Well, I think the first thing
242.272	that we can try to understand
245.142	is that segregation is a social construct.
247.48	It's something that we choose to do,
247.48	and we could choose not to do it,
250.824	and if you kind of think about it,
252.756	what we're doing with this data
252.756	is aiming a space telescope at a city
256.167	and looking at it as if was
256.167	a giant high school cafeteria,
259.199	and seeing how everybody arranged
259.199	themselves in a seating chart.
262.937	Well maybe it's time to shake up
262.937	the seating chart a little bit.
266.25	The other thing that we start to realize
268.79	is that race is a really
268.79	poor proxy for diversity.
271.428	We've got people represented
271.428	from all different types of races
274.365	across the entire map here --
276.691	only looking at race
279.067	doesn't really contribute to
279.067	our development of diversity.
281.785	So if we're trying to use diversity
283.524	as a way to tackle some of our
283.524	more intractable problems,
286.605	we need to start to think 
286.605	about diversity in a new way.
289.899	And lastly, we have the ability to create
293.426	interventions to start to reshape
293.426	our cities in a new way,
296.52	and I believe that if
296.52	we have that capability,
299.12	we may even bear some
299.12	responsibility to do so.
302.185	So what is a city?
303.95	I think some might say that it is
306.156	a geographical area or a collection
306.156	of streets and buildings,
309.316	but I believe that a city 
309.316	is the sum of the relationships
312.068	of the people that live there,
313.629	and I believe that if we can start to
313.629	document those relationships in a real way
319.68	then maybe we have a real shot
321.413	at creating those kinds of cities
321.413	that we'd like to have.
324.088	Thank you.
325.445	(Applause)
