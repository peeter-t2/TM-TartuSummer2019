12.921	This is my great uncle,
14.918	my father's father's younger brother.
17.936	His name was Joe McKenna.
20.142	He was a young husband
20.142	and a semi-pro basketball player
25.089	and a fireman in New York City.
29.407	Family history says
29.407	he loved being a fireman,
32.007	and so in 1938, on one of his days off,
35.542	he elected to hang out at the firehouse.
39.019	To make himself useful that day,
39.019	he started polishing all the brass,
43.218	the railings on the fire truck,
43.218	the fittings on the walls,
46.612	and one of the fire hose nozzles,
48.957	a giant, heavy piece of metal,
51.465	toppled off a shelf and hit him.
55.574	A few days later,
55.574	his shoulder started to hurt.
59.382	Two days after that, he spiked a fever.
62.656	The fever climbed and climbed.
65.141	His wife was taking care of him,
67.091	but nothing she did made a difference,
67.091	and when they got the local doctor in,
71.393	nothing he did mattered either.
74.149	They flagged down a cab
74.149	and took him to the hospital.
77.911	The nurses there recognized right away
77.911	that he had an infection,
81.905	what at the time they would
81.905	"have called ""blood poisoning,"""
86.061	and though they probably didn't say it,
88.174	they would have known right away
90.031	that there was nothing they could do.
93.77	There was nothing they could do
93.77	because the things we use now
96.788	to cure infections didn't exist yet.
99.737	The first test of penicillin,
99.737	the first antibiotic,
103.173	was three years in the future.
105.843	People who got infections
105.843	either recovered, if they were lucky,
110.547	or they died.
112.322	My great uncle was not lucky.
114.411	He was in the hospital for a week,
114.411	shaking with chills,
117.708	dehydrated and delirious,
119.566	sinking into a coma as his organs failed.
122.468	His condition grew so desperate
124.604	that the people from his firehouse
124.604	lined up to give him transfusions
129.234	hoping to dilute the infection
129.234	surging through his blood.
133.497	Nothing worked. He died.
137.143	He was 30 years old.
140.115	If you look back through history,
142.088	most people died the way
142.088	my great uncle died.
145.362	Most people didn't die
145.362	of cancer or heart disease,
148.032	the lifestyle diseases that afflict us
148.032	in the West today.
152.49	They didn't die of those diseases
152.49	because they didn't live long enough
156.229	to develop them.
158.225	They died of injuries --
160.338	being gored by an ox,
162.823	shot on a battlefield,
164.727	crushed in one of the new factories
164.727	of the Industrial Revolution --
168.465	and most of the time from infection,
171.846	which finished what those injuries began.
176.492	All of that changed
176.492	when antibiotics arrived.
180.599	Suddenly, infections that had
180.599	been a death sentence
184.198	became something
184.198	you recovered from in days.
187.588	It seemed like a miracle,
190.63	and ever since, we have been living inside
190.63	the golden epoch of the miracle drugs.
197.294	And now, we are coming to an end of it.
201.241	My great uncle died in the last days
201.241	of the pre-antibiotic era.
206.303	We stand today on the threshold
206.303	of the post-antibiotic era,
211.457	in the earliest days of a time
211.457	when simple infections
215.219	such as the one Joe had
215.219	will kill people once again.
220.884	In fact, they already are.
224.785	People are dying of infections again
224.785	because of a phenomenon
227.618	called antibiotic resistance.
230.381	Briefly, it works like this.
232.119	Bacteria compete against each other
232.119	for resources, for food,
237.091	by manufacturing lethal compounds
237.091	that they direct against each other.
241.758	Other bacteria, to protect themselves,
244.103	evolve defenses against
244.103	that chemical attack.
247.354	When we first made antibiotics,
249.676	we took those compounds into the lab
249.676	and made our own versions of them,
253.878	and bacteria responded to our attack
253.878	the way they always had.
259.674	Here is what happened next:
262.098	Penicillin was distributed in 1943,
265.488	and widespread penicillin resistance
265.488	arrived by 1945.
270.619	Vancomycin arrived in 1972,
273.568	vancomycin resistance in 1988.
277.028	Imipenem in 1985,
279.15	and resistance to in 1998.
282.192	Daptomycin, one of
282.192	the most recent drugs, in 2003,
285.86	and resistance to it
285.86	just a year later in 2004.
290.575	For 70 years, we played
290.575	a game of leapfrog --
294.335	our drug and their resistance,
297.261	and then another drug,
297.261	and then resistance again --
300.906	and now the game is ending.
303.437	Bacteria develop resistance so quickly
303.437	that pharmaceutical companies
307.477	have decided making antibiotics
307.477	is not in their best interest,
311.842	so there are infections
311.842	moving across the world
314.652	for which, out of the more
314.652	than 100 antibiotics
318.111	available on the market,
320.34	two drugs might work with side effects,
323.754	or one drug,
326.238	or none.
328.096	This is what that looks like.
330.278	In 2000, the Centers for Disease
330.278	Control and Prevention, the CDC,
334.458	identified a single case
336.501	in a hospital in North Carolina
338.753	of an infection resistant
338.753	to all but two drugs.
342.886	Today, that infection, known as KPC,
347.205	has spread to every state but three,
349.805	and to South America, Europe
352.15	and the Middle East.
354.867	In 2008, doctors in Sweden
357.189	diagnosed a man from India
357.189	with a different infection
359.975	resistant to all but one drug that time.
363.69	The gene that creates that resistance,
365.919	known as NDM, has now spread
365.919	from India into China, Asia, Africa,
372.444	Europe and Canada, and the United States.
377.129	It would be natural to hope
379.688	that these infections
379.688	are extraordinary cases,
383.287	but in fact,
385.145	in the United States and Europe,
390.322	die of infections which no drugs can help.
394.966	A project chartered
394.966	by the British government
398.008	known as the Review
398.008	on Antimicrobial Resistance
401.746	estimates that the worldwide toll
401.746	right now is 700,000 deaths a year.
410.291	That is a lot of deaths,
414.655	and yet, the chances are good
414.655	that you don't feel at risk,
417.767	that you imagine these people
417.767	were hospital patients
420.995	in intensive care units
422.713	or nursing home residents
422.713	near the ends of their lives,
426.66	people whose infections
426.66	are remote from us,
429.841	in situations we can't identify with.
434.455	What you didn't think about,
434.455	none of us do,
437.852	is that antibiotics support
437.852	almost all of modern life.
443.721	If we lost antibiotics,
445.932	here's what else we'd lose:
447.836	First, any protection for people
447.836	with weakened immune systems --
452.015	cancer patients, AIDS patients,
455.475	transplant recipients, premature babies.
459.979	Next, any treatment that installs
459.979	foreign objects in the body:
464.391	stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes,
468.269	dialysis, joint replacements.
472.193	How many athletic baby boomers
472.193	need new hips and knees?
475.908	A recent study estimates
475.908	that without antibiotics,
478.717	one out of ever six would die.
482.664	Next, we'd probably lose surgery.
485.869	Many operations are preceded
488.191	by prophylactic doses of antibiotics.
491.139	Without that protection,
492.811	we'd lose the ability to open
492.811	the hidden spaces of the body.
497.015	So no heart operations,
499.848	no prostate biopsies,
502.68	no Cesarean sections.
505.792	We'd have to learn to fear infections
505.792	that now seem minor.
510.784	Strep throat used to cause heart failure.
514.592	Skin infections led to amputations.
517.819	Giving birth killed,
517.819	in the cleanest hospitals,
520.722	almost one woman out of every 100.
523.717	Pneumonia took three children
523.717	out of every 10.
529.22	More than anything else,
531.333	we'd lose the confident way
531.333	we live our everyday lives.
536.836	If you knew that any injury
536.836	could kill you,
541.043	would you ride a motorcycle,
544.289	bomb down a ski slope,
547.5	climb a ladder to hang
547.5	your Christmas lights,
550.976	let your kid slide into home plate?
555.573	After all, the first person
555.573	to receive penicillin,
558.638	a British policeman named
558.638	Albert Alexander,
562.516	who was so ravaged by infection
562.516	that his scalp oozed pus
566.858	and doctors had to take out an eye,
569.783	was infected by doing
569.783	something very simple.
574.172	He walked into his garden
574.172	and scratched his face on a thorn.
580.831	That British project I mentioned
580.831	which estimates that the worldwide toll
584.481	right now is 700,000 deaths a year
588.358	also predicts that if we can't
588.358	get this under control by 2050,
594.535	not long, the worldwide toll
594.535	will be 10 million deaths a year.
602.127	How did we get to this point
604.829	where what we have to look forward to
606.864	is those terrifying numbers?
610.347	The difficult answer is,
610.347	we did it to ourselves.
614.875	Resistance is an inevitable
614.875	biological process,
617.847	but we bear the responsibility
617.847	for accelerating it.
622.49	We did this by squandering antibiotics
626.043	with a heedlessness
626.043	that now seems shocking.
631.408	Penicillin was sold
631.408	over the counter until the 1950s.
635.494	In much of the developing world,
635.494	most antibiotics still are.
639.209	In the United States, 50 percent
642.971	of the antibiotics given
642.971	in hospitals are unnecessary.
646.663	Forty-five percent of the prescriptions
646.663	written in doctor's offices
651.037	are for conditions
651.037	that antibiotics cannot help.
656.577	And that's just in healthcare.
659.247	On much of the planet, most meat animals
659.247	get antibiotics every day of their lives,
664.1	not to cure illnesses,
666.376	but to fatten them up
666.376	and to protect them against
669.835	the factory farm conditions
669.835	they are raised in.
673.806	In the United States, possibly 80 percent
676.824	of the antibiotics sold every year
676.824	go to farm animals, not to humans,
683.527	creating resistant bacteria
683.527	that move off the farm
687.203	in water, in dust,
689.827	in the meat the animals become.
692.985	Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too,
695.91	particularly in Asia,
697.559	and fruit growing relies on antibiotics
700.902	to protect apples, pears,
700.902	citrus, against disease.
706.491	And because bacteria can pass
706.491	their DNA to each other
712.117	like a traveler handing off
712.117	a suitcase at an airport,
716.552	once we have encouraged
716.552	that resistance into existence,
721.36	there is no knowing where it will spread.
725.723	This was predictable.
727.674	In fact, it was predicted
730.506	by Alexander Fleming,
730.506	the man who discovered penicillin.
734.941	He was given the Nobel Prize
734.941	in 1945 in recognition,
738.935	and in an interview shortly after,
738.935	this is what he said:
743.282	"""The thoughtless person playing"
743.282	with penicillin treatment
747.549	is morally responsible
747.549	for the death of a man
750.823	who succumbs to infection
753.147	"with a pencillin-resistant organism."""
756.05	"He added, ""I hope this evil"
756.05	"can be averted."""
760.986	Can we avert it?
763.842	There are companies working
763.842	on novel antibiotics,
767.51	things the superbugs
767.51	have never seen before.
771.086	We need those new drugs badly,
773.803	and we need incentives:
776.055	discovery grants, extended patents,
778.586	prizes, to lure other companies
778.586	into making antibiotics again.
785.343	But that probably won't be enough.
788.059	Here's why: Evolution always wins.
792.703	Bacteria birth a new generation
792.703	every 20 minutes.
796.627	It takes pharmaceutical chemistry
801.41	Every time we use an antibiotic,
804.266	we give the bacteria billions of chances
807.54	to crack the codes
809.281	of the defenses we've constructed.
812.486	There has never yet been a drug
814.877	they could not defeat.
817.431	This is asymmetric warfare,
820.961	but we can change the outcome.
825.929	We could build systems to harvest data
825.929	to tell us automatically and specifically
832.334	how antibiotics are being used.
835.263	We could build gatekeeping
835.263	into drug order systems
838.096	so that every prescription
838.096	gets a second look.
841.811	We could require agriculture
841.811	to give up antibiotic use.
848.243	We could build surveillance systems
851.275	to tell us where resistance
851.275	is emerging next.
855.501	Those are the tech solutions.
858.264	They probably aren't enough either,
860.888	unless we help.
867.785	Antibiotic resistance is a habit.
870.479	We all know how hard it is
870.479	to change a habit.
873.567	But as a society,
873.567	we've done that in the past.
878.397	People used to toss litter
878.397	into the streets,
881.972	used to not wear seatbelts,
883.737	used to smoke inside public buildings.
888.404	We don't do those things anymore.
891.144	We don't trash the environment
893.466	or court devastating accidents
896.623	or expose others
896.623	to the possibility of cancer,
899.595	because we decided those things
899.595	were expensive,
903.102	destructive, not in our best interest.
907.815	We changed social norms.
911.135	We could change social norms
911.135	around antibiotic use too.
917.499	I know that the scale
917.499	of antibiotic resistance
919.774	seems overwhelming,
921.678	but if you've ever bought
921.678	a fluorescent lightbulb
925.138	because you were concerned
925.138	about climate change,
927.854	or read the label on a box of crackers
930.989	because you think about
930.989	the deforestation from palm oil,
935.47	you already know what it feels like
938.349	to take a tiny step to address
938.349	an overwhelming problem.
943.829	We could take those kinds of steps
943.829	for antibiotic use too.
948.31	We could forgo giving an antibiotic
948.31	if we're not sure it's the right one.
956.251	We could stop insisting on a prescription
956.251	for our kid's ear infection
962.564	before we're sure what caused it.
965.678	We could ask every restaurant,
969.045	every supermarket,
970.856	where their meat comes from.
972.806	We could promise each other
974.64	never again to buy chicken
974.64	or shrimp or fruit
978.745	raised with routine antibiotic use,
981.629	and if we did those things,
984.323	we could slow down the arrival
984.323	of the post-antibiotic world.
989.547	But we have to do it soon.
993.68	Penicillin began
993.68	the antibiotic era in 1943.
998.185	In just 70 years, we walked ourselves
998.185	up to the edge of disaster.
1004.291	We won't get 70 years
1006.613	to find our way back out again.
1010.769	Thank you very much.
1012.789	(Applause)
