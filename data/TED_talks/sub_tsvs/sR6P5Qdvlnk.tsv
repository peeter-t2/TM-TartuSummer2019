13	I dedicated the past two years
13	to understanding
15.233	how people achieve their dreams.
17.598	When we think about the dreams we have,
19.599	and the dent we want to leave
19.599	in the universe,
22.132	it is striking to see how big
22.132	of an overlap there is
25.677	between the dreams that we have,
25.677	and projects that never happen.
29.323	(Laughter)
30.515	So I'm here to talk to you today
32.321	about five ways
32.321	how not to follow your dreams.
37.223	One: Believe in overnight success.
41.549	You know the story, right?
43.285	The tech guy built a mobile app
43.285	and sold it very fast for a lot of money.
48.765	You know, the story may seem real,
48.765	but I bet it's incomplete.
52.648	If you go investigate further,
54.725	the guy has done 30 apps before
56.845	and he has done a master's
56.845	on the topic, a PhD.
59.719	He has been working
59.719	on the topic for 20 years.
63.822	This is really interesting.
65.167	I myself have a story in Brazil
65.167	that people think is an overnight success.
70.796	I come from a humble family,
73.052	and two weeks before
73.052	the deadline to apply for MIT,
76.547	I started the application process.
78.819	And, voil√†! I got in.
81.732	People may think
81.732	it's an overnight success,
84.559	but that only worked
84.559	because for the 17 years prior to that,
88.905	I took life and education seriously.
91.15	Your overnight success story
91.15	is always a result
94.617	of everything you've done
94.617	in your life through that moment.
98.712	Two: Believe someone else
98.712	has the answers for you.
102.465	Constantly, people want
102.465	to help out, right?
104.819	All sorts of people: your family,
104.819	your friends, your business partners,
108.188	they all have opinions
108.188	on which path you should take:
111.431	"""And let me tell you,"
111.431	"go through this pipe."""
113.697	But whenever you go inside,
115.491	there are other ways
115.491	you have to pick as well.
118.244	And you need to make
118.244	those decisions yourself.
121.42	No one else has the perfect
121.42	answers for your life.
125.301	And you need to keep picking
125.301	those decisions, right?
127.882	The pipes are infinite
127.882	and you're going to bump your head,
130.687	and it's a part of the process.
133.806	Three, and it's very subtle
133.806	but very important:
138.004	Decide to settle
138.004	when growth is guaranteed.
140.705	So when your life is going great,
142.756	you have put together a great team,
145.091	and you have growing revenue,
145.091	and everything is set --
148.477	time to settle.
150.478	When I launched my first book,
152.023	I worked really, really hard
152.023	to distribute it everywhere in Brazil.
155.196	With that, over three million
155.196	people downloaded it,
157.616	over 50,000 people bought physical copies.
160.332	When I wrote a sequel,
160.332	some impact was guaranteed.
164.6	Even if I did little, sales would be OK.
168.204	But OK is never OK.
170.138	When you're growing towards a peak,
172.448	you need to work harder than ever
172.448	and find yourself another peak.
176.546	Maybe if I did little,
178.262	a couple hundred thousand
178.262	people would read it,
180.486	and that's great already.
182.435	But if I work harder than ever,
184.255	I can bring this number up to millions.
187.383	That's why I decided, with my new book,
187.383	to go to every single state of Brazil.
191.12	And I can already see a higher peak.
193.049	There's no time to settle down.
195.238	Fourth tip, and that's really important:
198.481	Believe the fault is someone else's.
201.961	I constantly see people saying,
204.157	"""Yes, I had this great idea,"
204.157	"but no investor had the vision to invest."""
208.146	"""Oh, I created this great product,"
209.924	but the market is so bad,
209.924	"the sales didn't go well."""
213.834	"Or, ""I can't find good talent;"
213.834	"my team is so below expectations."""
218.683	If you have dreams,
220.216	it's your responsibility
220.216	to make them happen.
223.663	Yes, it may be hard to find talent.
226.22	Yes, the market may be bad.
228.321	But if no one invested in your idea,
230.475	if no one bought your product,
232.368	for sure, there is something there
232.368	that is your fault.
235.38	(Laughter)
237.405	Definitely.
239.052	You need to get your dreams
239.052	and make them happen.
241.95	And no one achieved their goals alone.
245.162	But if you didn't make them happen,
245.162	it's your fault and no one else's.
249.31	Be responsible for your dreams.
253.019	And one last tip, and this one
253.019	is really important as well:
258.046	Believe that the only things that matter
258.046	are the dreams themselves.
262.892	Once I saw an ad,
262.892	and it was a lot of friends,
266.126	they were going up a mountain,
266.126	it was a very high mountain,
269.118	and it was a lot of work.
270.384	You could see that they were sweating
270.384	and this was tough.
273.402	And they were going up,
273.402	and they finally made it to the peak.
276.778	Of course, they decided
276.778	to celebrate, right?
278.869	I'm going to celebrate, so,
278.869	"""Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"""
282.874	Two seconds later,
282.874	one looks at the other and says,
285.508	"""OK, let's go down."""
287.446	(Laughter)
288.73	Life is never about the goals themselves.
291.468	Life is about the journey.
293.94	Yes, you should enjoy
293.94	the goals themselves,
296.301	but people think that you have dreams,
299.146	and whenever you get to reaching
299.146	one of those dreams,
301.785	it's a magical place
301.785	where happiness will be all around.
305.851	But achieving a dream
305.851	is a momentary sensation,
309.272	and your life is not.
311.211	The only way to really achieve
311.211	all of your dreams
314.521	is to fully enjoy every step
314.521	of your journey.
318.451	That's the best way.
319.638	And your journey is simple --
319.638	it's made of steps.
322.038	Some steps will be right on.
323.992	Sometimes you will trip.
326.228	If it's right on, celebrate, because
326.228	some people wait a lot to celebrate.
330.849	And if you tripped,
330.849	turn that into something to learn.
333.996	If every step becomes something
333.996	to learn or something to celebrate,
339.446	you will for sure enjoy the journey.
342.071	So, five tips:
343.797	Believe in overnight success,
346.231	believe someone else
346.231	has the answers for you,
348.657	believe that when growth is guaranteed,
348.657	you should settle down,
351.683	believe the fault is someone else's,
354.029	and believe that only
354.029	the goals themselves matter.
357.358	Believe me, you do that,
357.358	and you will destroy your dreams.
360.386	(Laughter)
361.617	(Applause)
362.814	Thank you.
364.695	Thanks.
365.916	(Applause)
