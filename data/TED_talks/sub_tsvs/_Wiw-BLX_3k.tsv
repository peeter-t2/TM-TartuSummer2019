13.084	I grew up
15.057	diagnosed as phobically shy,
19.86	and, like at least 20 other people
22.514	in a room of this size,
24.938	I was a stutterer.
26.558	Do you dare raise your hand?
29.218	And it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,
33.274	because when we are treated that way,
38.126	we feel invisible sometimes,
41.19	or talked around and at.
43.823	And as I started to look at people,
46.648	which is mostly all I did,
49.394	I noticed that some people
51.632	really wanted attention and recognition.
56.986	Remember, I was young then.
59.17	So what did they do?
60.207	What we still do perhaps too often.
62.847	We talk about ourselves.
65.58	And yet there are other people I observed
67.957	who had what I called a mutuality mindset.
71.546	In each situation, they found a way to talk about us
75.142	"and create that ""us"" idea."
77.532	So my idea to reimagine the world
79.627	is to see it one where we all become
82.493	greater opportunity-makers with and for others.
87.078	There's no greater opportunity
89.658	or call for action for us now
92.974	than to become opportunity-makers
95.34	who use best talents together more often
97.99	for the greater good
99.212	and accomplish things we
99.212	couldn't have done on our own.
102.291	And I want to talk to you about that,
104.765	because even more than giving,
107.165	even more than giving,
110.93	is the capacity for us to do something smarter
114.902	together for the greater good
118.406	that lifts us both up
120.277	and that can scale.
122.147	That's why I'm sitting here.
123.925	But I also want to point something else out:
127.717	Each one of you
130.226	is better than anybody else at something.
134.74	That disproves that popular notion
137.724	that if you're the smartest person in the room,
140.66	you're in the wrong room.
142.684	(Laughter)
144.901	So let me tell you about
147.111	a Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,
149.749	and I met this up-and-coming actress,
152.11	and we were soon talking about something
153.8	that we both felt passionately about: public art.
157.641	And she had the fervent belief
159.032	that every new building in Los Angeles
162.618	should have public art in it.
163.95	She wanted a regulation for it,
165.698	and she fervently started —
167.253	who is here from Chicago? —
169.155	she fervently started talking about
171.479	these bean-shaped reflective sculptures
174.464	in Millennium Park,
176.127	and people would walk up to it
178.36	and they'd smile in the reflection of it,
180.651	and they'd pose and they'd vamp
182.26	and they'd take selfies together,
184.702	and they'd laugh.
188.08	And as she was talking, a 
188.08	thought came to my mind.
190.764	"I said, ""I know someone you ought to meet."
193.783	He's getting out of San Quentin 
193.783	"in a couple of weeks"" —"
196.298	(Laughter) —
198.278	"""and he shares your fervent desire"
200.74	that art should engage and
200.74	"enable people to connect."""
203.936	He spent five years in solitary,
208.07	and I met him because I gave
208.07	a speech at San Quentin,
211.08	and he's articulate
213.61	and he's rather easy on 
213.61	the eyes because he's buff.
216.898	He had workout regime he did every day.
219.482	(Laughter)
221.519	I think she was following me at that point.
223.396	"I said, ""He'd be an unexpected ally."""
225.939	And not just that. There's James. He's an architect
228.784	and he's a professor, and he loves place-making,
232.26	and place-making is when you have
233.463	those mini-plazas and those urban walkways
237.057	and where they're dotted with art,
239.257	where people draw and 
239.257	come up and talk sometimes.
243.15	I think they'd make good allies.
245.545	And indeed they were.
248.696	They met together. They prepared.
250.866	They spoke in front of the 
250.866	Los Angeles City Council.
254.51	And the council members not
254.51	only passed the regulation,
257.225	half of them came down and asked
257.225	to pose with them afterwards.
261.308	They were startling, 
261.308	compelling and credible.
266.764	You can't buy that.
270.206	What I'm asking you to consider
272.276	is what kind of opportunity-
272.276	makers we might become,
274.973	because more than wealth
277.82	or fancy titles
281.869	or a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect
285.909	around each other's 
285.909	better side and bring it out.
288.249	And I'm not saying this is easy,
290.551	and I'm sure many of you have
290.551	made the wrong moves too
293.106	about who you wanted to connect with,
295.98	but what I want to suggest is,
298.574	this is an opportunity.
301.92	I started thinking about it
304.144	way back when I was a 
304.144	Wall Street Journal reporter
306.686	and I was in Europe and I was
306.686	supposed to cover trends
309.104	and trends that transcended business
311.647	or politics or lifestyle.
313.941	So I had to have contacts
316.315	in different worlds very different than mine,
318.283	because otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.
320.657	And third, I had to write the story
323.627	in a way stepping into the reader's shoes,
325.664	so they could see how these 
325.664	trends could affect their lives.
329.754	That's what opportunity-makers do.
333.274	And here's a strange thing:
336.703	Unlike an increasing number of Americans
339.919	who are working and living 
339.919	and playing with people
343.365	who think exactly like them
345.634	because we then become more rigid and extreme,
348.306	opportunity-makers are actively seeking situations
352.006	with people unlike them,
354.263	and they're building relationships,
356.106	and because they do that,
358.334	they have trusted relationships
360.212	where they can bring the right team in
362.363	and recruit them to solve a 
362.363	problem better and faster
366.18	and seize more opportunities.
367.755	They're not affronted by differences,
375.374	they're fascinated by them,
377.607	and that is a huge shift in mindset,
380.513	and once you feel it, you 
380.513	want it to happen a lot more.
383.415	This world is calling out for us 
383.415	to have a collective mindset,
388.469	and I believe in doing that.
390.851	It's especially important now.
393.156	Why is it important now?
395.968	Because things can be devised like drones
400.515	and drugs and data collection,
404.529	and they can be devised by more people
406.644	and cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
410.637	and then, as we know from the news every day,
412.977	they can be used for dangerous ones.
415.124	It calls on us, each of us,
418.468	to a higher calling.
421.204	But here's the icing on the cake:
423.96	It's not just the first opportunity
426.216	that you do with somebody else
428.367	that's probably your greatest,
430.123	as an institution or an individual.
432.767	It's after you've had that experience
434.959	and you trust each other.
436.904	It's the unexpected things
438.715	that you devise later on
440.539	you never could have predicted.
442.733	For example, Marty is the husband 
442.733	of that actress I mentioned,
448.343	and he watched them 
448.343	when they were practicing,
450.673	and he was soon talking to Wally,
452.192	my friend the ex-con,
453.586	about that exercise regime.
456.048	And he thought,
457.356	I have a set of racquetball courts.
459.536	That guy could teach it.
460.86	A lot of people who work there
460.86	are members at my courts.
464.313	They're frequent travelers.
465.982	They could practice in their hotel room,
467.834	no equipment provided.
469.95	That's how Wally got hired.
472.547	Not only that, years later
473.936	he was also teaching racquetball.
476.165	Years after that,
477.576	he was teaching the racquetball teachers.
480.657	What I'm suggesting is, when 
480.657	you connect with people
485.612	around a shared interest and action,
489.719	you're accustomed to serendipitous
492.059	things happening into the future,
494.433	and I think that's what we're looking at.
496.717	We open ourselves up to those opportunities,
499.361	and in this room 
499.361	are key players in technology,
503.208	key players who are uniquely positioned to do this,
506.296	to scale systems and projects together.
510.079	So here's what I'm calling for you to do.
512.572	Remember the three traits of opportunity-makers.
515.928	Opportunity-makers keep honing their top strength
520.817	and they become pattern seekers.
524.541	They get involved in different 
524.541	worlds than their worlds
528.883	so they're trusted and they 
528.883	can see those patterns,
531.485	and they communicate to connect
533.394	around sweet spots of shared interest.
536.54	So what I'm asking you is,
539.356	the world is hungry.
541.178	I truly believe, in my firsthand experience,
543.945	the world is hungry for us
546.656	to unite together as opportunity-makers
549.312	and to emulate those behaviors
551.316	as so many of you already do —
552.922	I know that firsthand —
555.948	and to reimagine a world
557.77	where we use our best talents together
559.964	more often to accomplish greater things together
563.278	than we could on our own.
566.994	Just remember,
569.304	as Dave Liniger once said,
572	"""You can't succeed"
574.429	"coming to the potluck with only a fork."""
577.568	(Laughter)
579.525	Thank you very much.
581.096	Thank you. (Applause)
