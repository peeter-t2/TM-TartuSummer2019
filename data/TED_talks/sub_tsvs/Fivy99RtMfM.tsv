12.8	(Mosquito buzzing)
22.04	(Swat)
25.48	Gotcha.
27.96	Mosquitoes.
29.88	I hate them.
32.12	Don't you?
33.96	That awful buzzing sound at night
33.96	around your ears
36.6	that drives you absolutely crazy?
39.28	Knowing that she wants
39.28	to stick a needle in your skin
41.8	and suck out your blood?
43.52	That's awful, right?
45.28	In fact, there's only one good thing
45.28	I can think of when it gets to mosquitoes.
51	When they fly into our bedroom at night,
53.8	they prefer to bite my wife.
55.601	(Laughter)
56.84	But that's fascinating, right?
58.32	Why does she receive more bites than I do?
62.6	And the answer is smell,
65.04	the smell of her body.
67.12	And since we all smell different
67.12	and produce chemicals on our skin
71	that either attract or repel mosquitoes,
73.96	some of us are just
73.96	more attractive than others.
77.36	So my wife smells nicer than I do,
77.36	or I just stink more than she does.
83.56	Either way, mosquitoes find us in the dark
83.56	by sniffing us out. They smell us.
89.8	And during my PhD,
89.8	I wanted to know exactly
93.12	what chemicals from our skin
93.12	African malaria mosquitoes use
97.224	to track us down at night.
99.68	And there's a whole range
99.68	of compounds that they do use.
102.76	And this was not going to be an easy task.
105.6	And therefore we set up
105.6	various experiments.
109.64	Why did we set up these experiments?
111.84	Because half the world's population
114.16	runs the risk of contracting
114.16	a killer disease like malaria
118.48	through a simple mosquito bite.
120.84	Every 30 seconds,
120.84	somewhere on this planet,
123.28	a child dies of malaria,
125.76	and Paul Levy this morning,
125.76	he was talking about the metaphor
128.68	of the 727 crashing
128.68	into the United States.
131.2	Well, in Africa, we have
131.2	the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s
136.88	crashing every day.
139.32	But perhaps if we can attract
139.32	these mosquitoes to traps,
142.639	bait it with our smell,
144.24	we may be able
144.24	to stop transmission of disease.
148.36	Now, solving this puzzle
148.36	was not an easy thing,
150.6	because we produce hundreds
150.6	of different chemicals on the skin,
153.6	but we undertook
153.6	some remarkable experiments
156.28	that managed us to resolve
156.28	this puzzle very quickly indeed.
159.6	First, we observed
159.6	that not all mosquito species
162.96	bite on the same part of the body.
165.6	Strange.
166.84	So we set up an experiment
168.44	where we put a naked volunteer
168.44	in a large cage,
171.821	(Laughter)
172.86	and in that cage, we released mosquitoes
175.32	to see where they were biting
175.32	on the body of that person.
178.6	And we found some remarkable differences.
181	On the left here you see the bites
184.04	by the Dutch malaria mosquito
184.04	on this person.
186.32	They had a very strong preference
186.32	for biting on the face.
189.84	In contrast, the African malaria mosquito
192.36	had a very strong preference for biting
192.36	the ankles and feet of this person.
197.56	And that, of course,
197.56	we should have known all along,
200.04	because they're called
200.04	mosqui-toes, you see?
203.2	(Laughter)
204.56	That's right.
205.8	(Applause)
208.08	And so we started
208.08	focusing on the smell of feet ...
213.24	on the smell of human feet,
215.08	until we came across
215.08	a remarkable statement in the literature
218.84	that said that cheese smells after feet
222.64	rather than the reverse.
224.84	Think of it.
226.32	And this triggered us
226.32	to do a remarkable experiment.
228.773	We tried, with a tiny little piece
228.773	of Limburger cheese,
233.84	which smells badly after feet,
236.24	to attract African malaria mosquitoes.
238.4	And you know what? It worked.
241.44	In fact, it worked so well
244.44	that now we have a synthetic mixture
244.44	of the aroma of Limburger cheese
249	that we're using in Tanzania
250.8	and has been shown there
252.04	to be two to three times
252.04	more attractive to mosquitoes than humans.
256.76	Limburg, be proud of your cheese,
260.28	as it is now used
260.28	in the fight against malaria.
263.44	(Applause)
270.279	That's the cheese, just to show you.
273.399	My second story is remarkable as well.
276.72	It's about man's best friend.
276.72	It's about dogs.
279.96	And I will show you how we can use dogs
279.96	in the fight against malaria.
284.88	One of the best ways of killing mosquitoes
287.76	is not to wait until
287.76	they fly around like adults
291.08	and bite people and transmit disease.
293.8	It's to kill them when they're still
293.8	in the water as larvae.
297.92	Why?
299.16	Because they are just like the CIA.
302.48	In that pool of water,
302.48	these larvae are concentrated.
306.48	They're all together there.
306.48	They are immobile.
309.16	They can't escape from that water.
310.84	They can't fly.
312.44	And they're accessible.
315.16	You can actually walk up to that pool
315.16	and you can kill them there, right?
320.12	So the problem that we face with this
323.76	is that, throughout the landscape,
323.76	all these pools of water with the larvae,
327.68	they are scattered all over the place,
329.68	which makes it very hard
329.68	for an inspector like this
332.92	to actually find all these breeding sites
332.92	and treat them with insecticides.
337.04	And last year we thought very, very hard,
337.04	how can we resolve this problem?
341.96	Until we realized that just like us --
341.96	we have a unique smell --
346.44	mosquito larvae
346.44	also have a very unique smell.
350.48	And so we set up another crazy experiment,
352.68	because we collected
352.68	the smell of these larvae,
355.04	put it on pieces of cloth,
355.04	and then did something very remarkable.
358.96	Here we have a bar with four holes
361.4	and we put the smell
361.4	of these larvae in the left hole.
364.2	Oh, that was very quick.
365.44	And then you see the dog.
365.44	It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.
368.6	He's examining these holes
368.6	and now he's got it already.
371.24	He's going back to check
371.24	the control holes again,
373.6	but he's coming back to the first one,
375.48	and now he's locking into that smell,
377.32	which means that now,
377.32	we can use dogs with these inspectors
380.96	to much better find the breeding sites
380.96	of mosquitoes in the field,
384.2	and therefore have
384.2	a much bigger impact on malaria.
387.32	This lady is Ellen van der Zweep.
388.96	She's one of the best
388.96	dog trainers in the world,
391.223	and she believes
391.223	that we can do a lot more.
394.16	Since we also know that people
394.16	that carry malaria parasites
397.64	smell different compared to people
397.64	that are uninfected,
400.52	she's convinced that we can train dogs
400.52	to find people that carry the parasite.
406.8	That means that in a population
406.8	where malaria has gone down all the way
410.24	and there's few people
410.24	remaining with parasites,
412.68	that the dogs can find these people,
414.44	we can treat them with antimalarial drugs
414.44	and give the final blow to malaria.
418.36	Man's best friend
418.36	in the fight against malaria.
422.08	My third story is perhaps
422.08	even more remarkable ...
425.28	and, I should say, has never been shown
425.28	to the public until today.
428.78	(Audience cheers)
429.805	Yeah.
431.76	It's a crazy story, but I believe
431.76	it's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge
436.76	against mosquitoes ever.
438.44	In fact, people have told me
439.96	that now they will enjoy
439.96	being bitten by mosquitoes.
444.52	And the question of course is,
446.08	what would make someone
446.08	enjoy being bitten by mosquitoes?
449.8	And the answer I have right here ...
453.08	in my pocket --
454.546	(Laughter)
455.571	if I get it.
457.96	It's a tablet.
460	A simple tablet,
461.24	and when I take it with water ...
464.48	it does miracles.
468.96	Thank you.
476.36	Now, let me show you how this works.
479.96	Here in this box, I have a cage
484.014	with several hundred
484.014	hungry female mosquitoes ...
491.016	(Laughter)
492.32	that I'm just about to release.
494.8	(Laughter)
496.6	Just kidding, just kidding.
497.965	(Laughter)
499.36	What I'm going to show you
499.36	is, I'm gonna stick my arm into it
502.44	and I will show you
502.44	how quickly they will bite.
505.48	There we go.
507.48	Don't worry, I do this
507.48	all the time in the lab.
510.32	There we go.
512.56	OK.
514.24	Now, on the video --
517.32	on the video here,
519.16	I'm going to show you
519.16	exactly the same thing,
521.32	except that what
521.32	I'm showing you on the video
523.48	happened one hour after I took the tablet.
526.799	Have a look.
528.72	That doesn't work.
529.96	OK. Sorry about that.
531.6	I'm sticking in my arm,
531.6	I'm giving them a big juicy blood meal,
534.6	I'm shaking them off,
534.6	and we follow them through time
537.12	to see these mosquitoes
537.12	get very, very sick indeed,
539.64	here shown in fast motion.
541.92	And three hours later,
541.92	what we see at the bottom of the cage
545.88	is dead mosquitoes ...
548	very dead mosquitoes.
550.8	And I'm going to say,
550.8	ladies and gentlemen,
552.84	we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes.
554.864	They don't kill us. We kill them.
558.44	(Applause)
567.64	Now --
569.96	(Laughter)
573.16	Maastricht, be prepared.
575.4	Now, think of what we can do with this.
577.32	We can actually use this
577.32	to contain outbreaks
579.48	of mosquito-born diseases,
579.48	of epidemics, right?
583.16	And better still,
583.16	imagine what would happen
585.2	if, in a very large area, everyone would
585.2	take these drugs, for just three weeks.
589.92	That would give us an opportunity
591.56	to actually eliminate
591.56	malaria as a disease.
594.36	So cheese, dogs and a pill
594.36	to kill mosquitoes.
598.32	That's the kind of out-of-the-box
598.32	science that I love doing ...
602.16	for the betterment of mankind,
604.16	but especially for her,
605.8	so that she can grow up
605.8	in a world without malaria.
609.72	Thank you.
610.96	(Applause)
