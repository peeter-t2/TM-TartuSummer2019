13.087	There is something about physics
17.296	that has been really bothering me
17.296	since I was a little kid.
23.01	And it's related to a question
24.843	that scientists have been asking
24.843	for almost 100 years,
28.111	with no answer.
31.108	How do the smallest things in nature,
34.142	the particles of the quantum world,
36.319	match up with the largest
36.319	things in nature --
39.374	planets and stars and galaxies
39.374	held together by gravity?
43.25	As a kid, I would puzzle
43.25	over questions just like this.
46.047	I would fiddle around
46.047	with microscopes and electromagnets,
48.963	and I would read
48.963	about the forces of the small
51.182	and about quantum mechanics
52.54	and I would marvel at how well
52.54	that description matched up
56.128	to our observation.
58.22	Then I would look at the stars,
59.827	and I would read about how well
59.827	we understand gravity,
62.375	and I would think surely,
62.375	there must be some elegant way
65.749	that these two systems match up.
69.021	But there's not.
71.673	And the books would say,
72.857	yeah, we understand a lot
72.857	about these two realms separately,
76.064	but when we try to link
76.064	them mathematically,
78.698	everything breaks.
80.674	And for 100 years,
82.008	none of our ideas as to how to solve
82.008	this basically physics disaster,
87.06	has ever been supported by evidence.
90.271	And to little old me --
91.949	little, curious, skeptical James --
93.783	this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.
98.011	So, I'm still a skeptical little kid.
100.268	Flash-forward now
100.268	to December of 2015,
105.029	when I found myself smack in the middle
107.527	of the physics world
107.527	being flipped on its head.
111.999	It all started when we at CERN
111.999	saw something intriguing in our data:
115.343	a hint of a new particle,
117.641	an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
117.641	answer to this question.
123.777	So I'm still a skeptical
123.777	little kid, I think,
125.928	but I'm also now a particle hunter.
128.085	I am a physicist at CERN's
128.085	Large Hadron Collider,
131.572	the largest science
131.572	experiment ever mounted.
135.877	It's a 27-kilometer tunnel
135.877	on the border of France and Switzerland
139.436	buried 100 meters underground.
141.31	And in this tunnel,
142.488	we use superconducting magnets
142.488	colder than outer space
146.465	to accelerate protons
146.465	to almost the speed of light
149.55	and slam them into each other
149.55	millions of times per second,
153.451	collecting the debris of these collisions
156.301	to search for new, undiscovered
156.301	fundamental particles.
160.727	Its design and construction
160.727	took decades of work
163.215	by thousands of physicists
163.215	from around the globe,
166.271	and in the summer of 2015,
168.836	we had been working tirelessly
168.836	to switch on the LHC
172.284	at the highest energy that humans
172.284	have ever used in a collider experiment.
177.735	Now, higher energy is important
180.282	because for particles,
180.282	there is an equivalence
182.493	between energy and particle mass,
184.718	and mass is just a number
184.718	put there by nature.
188.068	To discover new particles,
189.41	we need to reach these bigger numbers.
191.556	And to do that, we have to build
191.556	a bigger, higher energy collider,
194.834	and the biggest, highest
194.834	energy collider in the world
197.423	is the Large Hadron Collider.
200.271	And then, we collide protons
200.271	quadrillions of times,
205.194	and we collect this data very slowly,
205.194	over months and months.
210.813	And then new particles might show up
210.813	in our data as bumps --
215.172	slight deviations from what you expect,
217.641	little clusters of data points
217.641	that make a smooth line not so smooth.
222.379	For example, this bump,
225.01	after months of data-taking in 2012,
227.567	led to the discovery
227.567	of the Higgs particle --
229.72	the Higgs boson --
230.949	and to a Nobel Prize
230.949	for the confirmation of its existence.
235.972	This jump up in energy in 2015
240.628	represented the best chance
240.628	that we as a species had ever had
243.944	of discovering new particles --
245.445	new answers to these
245.445	long-standing questions,
247.581	because it was almost
247.581	twice as much energy as we used
250.702	when we discovered the Higgs boson.
252.648	Many of my colleagues had been working
252.648	their entire careers for this moment,
256.413	and frankly, to little curious me,
258.513	this was the moment
258.513	I'd been waiting for my entire life.
261.447	So 2015 was go time.
264.654	So June 2015,
267.722	the LHC is switched back on.
271.04	My colleagues and I held our breath
271.04	and bit our fingernails,
273.941	and then finally we saw
273.941	the first proton collisions
276.476	at this highest energy ever.
278.456	Applause, champagne, celebration.
280.556	This was a milestone for science,
284.176	and we had no idea what we would find
284.176	in this brand-new data.
291.99	And then a few weeks later,
291.99	we found a bump.
296.192	It wasn't a very big bump,
298.952	but it was big enough to make
298.952	you raise your eyebrow.
301.488	But on a scale of one to 10
301.488	for eyebrow raises,
303.763	if 10 indicates that you've
303.763	discovered a new particle,
306.397	this eyebrow raise is about a four.
308.148	(Laughter)
310.432	I spent hours, days, weeks
310.432	in secret meetings,
315.667	arguing with my colleagues
315.667	over this little bump,
318.051	poking and prodding it with our most
318.051	ruthless experimental sticks
321.311	to see if it would withstand scrutiny.
323.988	But even after months
323.988	of working feverishly --
327.473	sleeping in our offices
327.473	and not going home,
329.929	candy bars for dinner,
332.03	coffee by the bucketful --
333.624	physicists are machines
333.624	for turning coffee into diagrams --
337.891	(Laughter)
339.314	This little bump would not go away.
342.704	So after a few months,
344.866	we presented our little bump to the world
344.866	with a very clear message:
349.457	this little bump is interesting
349.457	but it's not definitive,
352.192	so let's keep an eye on it
352.192	as we take more data.
355.872	So we were trying to be
355.872	extremely cool about it.
359.463	And the world ran with it anyway.
362.383	The news loved it.
364.735	People said it reminded
364.735	them of the little bump
367.314	that was shown on the way
367.314	toward the Higgs boson discovery.
370.761	Better than that,
370.761	my theorist colleagues --
374.548	I love my theorist colleagues --
376.889	my theorist colleagues wrote
380.525	(Laughter)
382.574	The world of particle physics
382.574	had been flipped on its head.
387.745	But what was it about this particular bump
392.011	that caused thousands of physicists
392.011	to collectively lose their cool?
397.596	This little bump was unique.
400.198	This little bump indicated
401.591	that we were seeing an unexpectedly
401.591	large number of collisions
404.637	whose debris consisted
404.637	of only two photons,
407.992	two particles of light.
409.26	And that's rare.
411.069	Particle collisions are not
411.069	like automobile collisions.
413.713	They have different rules.
415.256	When two particles collide
415.256	at almost the speed of light,
417.93	the quantum world takes over.
419.375	And in the quantum world,
420.659	these two particles
420.659	can briefly create a new particle
423.876	that lives for a tiny fraction of a second
426.68	before splitting into other particles
426.68	that hit our detector.
429.585	Imagine a car collision
429.585	where the two cars vanish upon impact,
433.014	a bicycle appears in their place --
435.307	(Laughter)
436.402	And then that bicycle explodes
436.402	into two skateboards,
438.887	which hit our detector.
440.092	(Laughter)
441.495	Hopefully, not literally.
443.472	They're very expensive.
446.191	Events where only two photons
446.191	hit out detector are very rare.
449.963	And because of the special
449.963	quantum properties of photons,
453.709	there's a very small number
453.709	of possible new particles --
457.521	these mythical bicycles --
459.042	that can give birth to only two photons.
461.812	But one of these options is huge,
464.672	and it has to do with
464.672	that long-standing question
467.532	that bothered me as a tiny little kid,
470.078	about gravity.
473.946	Gravity may seem super strong to you,
476.642	but it's actually crazily weak
476.642	compared to the other forces of nature.
480.766	I can briefly beat gravity when I jump,
484.39	but I can't pick a proton out of my hand.
488.463	The strength of gravity compared
488.463	to the other forces of nature?
492.48	It's 10 to the minus 39.
494.694	That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.
497.255	Worse than that,
498.436	all of the other known forces of nature
498.436	are perfectly described
501.487	by this thing we call the Standard Model,
503.548	which is our current best description
503.548	of nature at its smallest scales,
507.007	and quite frankly,
508.187	one of the most successful
508.187	achievements of humankind --
512.388	except for gravity, which is absent
512.388	from the Standard Model.
516.424	It's crazy.
518.046	It's almost as though most
518.046	of gravity has gone missing.
522.394	We feel a little bit of it,
524.085	but where's the rest of it?
525.785	No one knows.
528.003	But one theoretical explanation
528.003	proposes a wild solution.
534.12	You and I --
535.483	even you in the back --
537.085	we live in three dimensions of space.
539.254	I hope that's a
539.254	non-controversial statement.
541.835	(Laughter)
543.688	All of the known particles also live
543.688	in three dimensions of space.
547.15	In fact, a particle is just another name
549.364	for an excitation
549.364	in a three-dimensional field;
552.397	a localized wobbling in space.
555.288	More importantly, all the math
555.288	that we use to describe all this stuff
558.841	assumes that there are only
558.841	three dimensions of space.
561.938	But math is math, and we can play
561.938	around with our math however we want.
565.343	And people have been playing around
565.343	with extra dimensions of space
568.533	for a very long time,
569.712	but it's always been an abstract
569.712	mathematical concept.
572.321	I mean, just look around you --
572.321	you at the back, look around --
575.517	there's clearly only
575.517	three dimensions of space.
578.954	But what if that's not true?
582.109	What if the missing gravity is leaking
582.109	into an extra-spatial dimension
588.388	that's invisible to you and I?
591.355	What if gravity is just as strong
591.355	as the other forces
594.473	if you were to view it in this
594.473	extra-spatial dimension,
597.638	and what you and I experience
597.638	is a tiny slice of gravity
600.562	make it seem very weak?
604.158	If this were true,
605.357	we would have to expand
605.357	our Standard Model of particles
608.129	to include an extra particle,
608.129	a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,
612.239	a special graviton that lives
612.239	in extra-spatial dimensions.
615.258	I see the looks on your faces.
616.747	You should be asking me the question,
618.59	"""How in the world are we going to test"
618.59	this crazy, science fiction idea,
622.258	"stuck as we are in three dimensions?"""
624.773	The way we always do,
626.079	by slamming together two protons --
628.242	(Laughter)
629.418	Hard enough that
629.418	the collision reverberates
632.006	into any extra-spatial dimensions
632.006	that might be there,
634.721	momentarily creating
634.721	this hyperdimensional graviton
637.344	that then snaps back
637.344	into the three dimensions of the LHC
641.748	and spits off two photons,
644.278	two particles of light.
647.417	And this hypothetical,
647.417	extra-dimensional graviton
650.351	is one of the only possible,
650.351	hypothetical new particles
654.082	that has the special quantum properties
656.241	that could give birth to our little,
656.241	two-photon bump.
662	So, the possibility of explaining
662	the mysteries of gravity
667.844	and of discovering extra
667.844	dimensions of space --
671.366	perhaps now you get a sense
672.982	as to why thousands of physics geeks
672.982	collectively lost their cool
677.13	over our little, two-photon bump.
679.036	A discovery of this type
679.036	would rewrite the textbooks.
682.739	But remember,
683.915	the message from us experimentalists
685.663	that actually were doing
685.663	this work at the time,
687.926	was very clear:
689.104	we need more data.
690.302	With more data,
691.845	the little bump will either turn into
691.845	a nice, crisp Nobel Prize --
695.893	(Laughter)
697.677	Or the extra data will fill in
697.677	the space around the bump
700.665	and turn it into a nice, smooth line.
703.515	So we took more data,
704.757	and with five times the data,
704.757	several months later,
707.358	our little bump
709.072	turned into a smooth line.
715.217	"The news reported on a ""huge"
715.217	"disappointment,"" on ""faded hopes,"""
718.725	"and on particle physicists ""being sad."""
721.259	Given the tone of the coverage,
723.094	you'd think that we had decided
723.094	to shut down the LHC and go home.
726.606	(Laughter)
728.628	But that's not what we did.
733.057	But why not?
736.475	I mean, if I didn't discover
736.475	a particle -- and I didn't --
740.209	if I didn't discover a particle,
740.209	why am I here talking to you?
743.262	Why didn't I just hang my head in shame
745.723	and go home?
751.169	Particle physicists are explorers.
755.421	And very much of what we do
755.421	is cartography.
759.468	Let me put it this way: forget
759.468	about the LHC for a second.
762.344	Imagine you are a space explorer
762.344	arriving at a distant planet,
765.75	searching for aliens.
767.099	What is your first task?
769.931	To immediately orbit the planet,
769.931	land, take a quick look around
773.031	for any big, obvious signs of life,
774.941	and report back to home base.
776.784	That's the stage we're at now.
779.269	We took a first look at the LHC
780.78	for any new, big,
780.78	obvious-to-spot particles,
783.088	and we can report that there are none.
785.631	We saw a weird-looking alien bump
785.631	on a distant mountain,
788.328	but once we got closer,
788.328	we saw it was a rock.
790.816	But then what do we do?
790.816	Do we just give up and fly away?
793.48	Absolutely not;
794.791	we would be terrible scientists if we did.
797.12	No, we spend the next couple
797.12	of decades exploring,
800.757	mapping out the territory,
802.261	sifting through the sand
802.261	with a fine instrument,
804.65	peeking under every stone,
806.132	drilling under the surface.
808.106	New particles can either
808.106	show up immediately
810.723	as big, obvious-to-spot bumps,
812.88	or they can only reveal themselves
812.88	after years of data taking.
818.103	Humanity has just begun its exploration
818.103	at the LHC at this big high energy,
822.537	and we have much searching to do.
824.352	But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,
824.352	we still find no new particles?
831.053	We build a bigger machine.
832.772	(Laughter)
834.37	We search at higher energies.
836.476	We search at higher energies.
838.946	Planning is already underway
838.946	for a 100-kilometer tunnel
842.612	that will collide particles
842.612	at 10 times the energy of the LHC.
845.612	We don't decide where
845.612	nature places new particles.
848.366	We only decide to keep exploring.
850.036	But what if, even after
850.036	a 100-kilometer tunnel
852.618	or a 500-kilometer tunnel
854.502	or a 10,000-kilometer
854.502	collider floating in space
857.367	between the Earth and the Moon,
858.969	we still find no new particles?
863.597	Then perhaps we're doing
863.597	particle physics wrong.
866.315	(Laughter)
868.13	Perhaps we need to rethink things.
871.127	Maybe we need more resources,
871.127	technology, expertise
874.413	than what we currently have.
876.61	We already use artificial intelligence
876.61	and machine learning techniques
879.975	in parts of the LHC,
881.152	but imagine designing
881.152	a particle physics experiment
883.582	using such sophisticated algorithms
885.275	that it could teach itself to discover
885.275	a hyperdimensional graviton.
888.467	But what if?
889.648	What if the ultimate question:
891.117	What if even artificial intelligence
891.117	can't help us answer our questions?
894.614	What if these open questions,
894.614	for centuries,
896.749	are destined to be unanswered
896.749	for the foreseeable future?
899.442	What if the stuff that's bothered me
899.442	since I was a little kid
902.395	is destined to be unanswered
902.395	in my lifetime?
906.395	Then that ...
908.282	will be even more fascinating.
912.144	We will be forced to think
912.144	in completely new ways.
916.361	We'll have to go back to our assumptions,
918.443	and determine if there was
918.443	a flaw somewhere.
921.401	And we'll need to encourage more people
921.401	to join us in studying science
924.82	since we need fresh eyes
924.82	on these century-old problems.
927.906	I don't have the answers,
927.906	and I'm still searching for them.
931.064	But someone -- maybe
931.064	she's in school right now,
933.417	maybe she's not even born yet --
935.783	could eventually guide us to see physics
935.783	in a completely new way,
