12.645	The school of architecture
12.645	that I studied at some 30 years ago
16.999	happened to be across the street
16.999	from the wonderful art gallery
20.862	designed by the great
20.862	architect Louis Kahn.
24.977	I love the building,
24.977	and I used to visit it quite often.
28.714	One day,
30.269	I saw the security guard run his hand
30.269	across the concrete wall.
36.852	And it was the way he did it,
38.608	the expression on his face --
41.254	something touched me.
43.901	I could see that the security guard
43.901	was moved by the building
49.511	and that architecture has that capacity
53.673	to move you.
55.349	I could see it, and I remember thinking,
57.8	"""Wow. How does architecture do that?"""
63.175	At school, I was learning to design,
67.375	but here -- here was
67.375	a reaction of the heart.
71.779	And it touched me to the core.
77.349	You know, you aspire for beauty,
83.13	for sensuousness, for atmosphere,
83.13	the emotional response.
89.55	That's the realm of the ineffable
92.106	and the immeasurable.
93.901	And that's what you live for:
96.791	a chance to try.
99.678	So in 2003, there was
99.678	an open call for designs
103.179	for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.
105.325	This was the first temple
105.325	in all of South America.
108.347	It's a continental temple,
110.255	a hugely important milestone
110.255	for the Bahá'í community,
113.458	because this would be the last
113.458	of the continental temples
117.714	and would open the door
117.714	for national and local temples to be built
121.294	around the world.
122.643	And the brief was deceptively simple
126.217	and unique in the annals of religion:
130.882	a circular room, nine sides,
130.882	nine entrances, nine paths,
137.856	allowing you to come to the temple
137.856	from all directions,
143.362	nine symbolizing completeness,
146.32	perfection.
148.346	No pulpit, no sermons,
151.884	as there are no clergy
151.884	in the Bahá'í faith.
154.83	And in a world which is putting up walls,
158.959	the design needed to express in form
162.431	the very opposite.
164.899	It had to be open, welcoming
168.871	to people of all faiths,
168.871	walks of life, backgrounds,
173.439	or no faith at all;
176.163	a new form of sacred space
179.476	with no pattern
182.474	or models to draw from.
186.148	It was like designing one of the first
186.148	churches for Christianity
190.03	or one of the first mosques for Islam.
193.869	So we live in a secular world.
200.399	How do you design sacred space today?
206.118	And how do you even define
206.118	what's sacred today?
212.823	I stumbled across this beautiful quote
212.823	from the Bahá'í writings,
217.821	and it speaks to prayer.
221.252	It says that if you reach out in prayer,
224.751	and if your prayer is answered --
224.751	which is already very interesting --
228.519	that the pillars of your heart
228.519	will become ashine.
234.116	And I loved this idea
234.116	of the inner and the outer,
237.768	like when you see someone
237.768	"and you say, ""That person is radiant."""
243.999	"And I was thinking, ""My gosh,"
243.999	how could we make something
249.055	architectural out of that,
251.142	where you create a building
255.371	and it becomes alive with light?
259.342	Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,
259.342	it becomes alive.
263.384	And I drew this sketch,
265.55	something with two layers, translucent
268.935	with structure in between capturing light.
272.466	Maybe a pure form,
272.466	a single form of emanation
278.451	that you could imagine
280.896	would be all dome
284.424	and everything we kept making
284.424	was looking too much like an egg.
287.919	(Laughter)
289.553	A blob.
291.526	So you search.
293.349	You all know this crazy search,
293.349	letting the process take you,
297.876	and you live for the surprises.
299.524	And I remember quite by accident
301.774	I saw this little video
301.774	of a plant moving in light,
307.17	and it made me think of movement,
310.857	reach,
312.053	this idea that the temple
312.053	could have reach,
314.393	like this reach for the divine.
317.227	You can imagine also
319.076	that movement within a circle
319.076	could mean movement and stillness,
323.995	like the cosmos,
326.01	something you see in many places.
329.705	(Laughter)
332.131	But rotation was not enough,
336.668	because we needed a form.
338.876	In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about
341.166	the temples being as perfect
341.166	as is humanly possible,
346.052	and we kept thinking,
346.052	well, what is perfection?
348.653	And I remember I stumbled into this image
348.653	of this Japanese basket
353.021	and thinking our Western notions
353.021	of perfection need to be challenged,
357.046	that this wonderful silhouette
357.046	of this basket, this wonkiness,
361.793	and that it has the kind of dimple
361.793	of what you might imagine a shoulder
367.465	or the cheekbone,
368.996	and that kind of organic form.
371.873	And so we drew and made models,
374.71	these lines that merge at the top,
377.949	soft lines,
380.307	which became like drapery
383.272	and translucent veils and folding,
386.793	and the idea of not only
386.793	folding but torquing --
390.907	you remember the plant
390.907	and the way it was reaching.
394.737	And this started to become
394.737	an interesting form,
398.4	carving the base, making the entrances.
401.796	And then we ended up with this.
403.943	This is this temple with two layers,
407.564	nine luminous veils,
410.081	embodied light,
411.58	soft-flowing lines
413.551	like luminescent drapery.
	were received from 80 countries,
419.831	and this was selected.
421.862	So we went to the next stage
421.862	of how to build it.
427.851	We had submitted alabaster.
431.935	But alabaster was too soft,
434.489	and we were experimenting,
434.489	many experiments with materials,
437.989	trying to think how we could have
437.989	this kind of shimmer,
442.412	and we ended up with borosilicate.
445.46	And borosilicate glass,
445.46	as you know, is very strong,
449.06	and if you break borosilicate rods
449.06	just so and melt them
454.31	at just the right temperature,
456.638	we ended up with this new material,
458.43	this new cast glass which took us
458.43	about two years to make.
463.578	And it had this quality that we loved,
465.905	this idea of the embodied light,
468.976	but on the inside, we wanted
468.976	something with a soft light,
473.33	like the inner lining of a jacket.
475.965	On the outside you have protection,
475.965	but on the inside you touch it.
480.625	So we found this tiny vein
480.625	in a huge quarry in Portugal
486.464	with this beautiful stone,
489.771	which the owner had kept
489.771	for seven generations in his family,
494.805	waiting for the right project,
494.805	if you can believe it.
499.697	Look at this material, it's beautiful.
501.813	And the way it lights up;
501.813	it has that translucent quality.
506.224	So here you see the structure.
508.993	It lets the light through.
511.329	And looking down,
515.015	the nine wings are bound,
517.311	structurally but symbolically strong,
520.875	a great symbol of unity:
524.373	pure geometry, a perfect circle,
531.88	perfectly symmetrical,
533.684	like the idea of sacredness and geometry.
537.812	And here you see the building going up,
540.992	2,000 steel nodes,
543.303	9,000 pieces of steel,
547.017	7,800 stone pieces,
	all individual shapes,
554.385	the entire superstructure all described,
557.442	engineered, fabricated
557.442	with aerospace technology,
561.957	prefabricated machine to machine,
565.168	robotically,
567.056	a huge team effort, you can imagine,
569.357	of literally hundreds,
571.325	and within three percent
571.325	of our $30 million budget
576.077	set in 2006.
578.384	(Applause)
581.901	Nine wings bound together
587.017	forming a nine-pointed star,
590.76	and the star shape moving in space,
595.187	tracking the sun.
607.582	So here it is.
609.046	Audience: Wow!
611.621	(Applause)
619.806	Hopefully, a befitting response
619.806	to that beautiful quote,
625.206	"""a prayer answered,"""
627.366	open in all directions,
630.593	capturing the blue light of dawn,
634.053	tent-like white light of day,
637.76	the gold light of the afternoon,
640.702	and of course, at night, the reversal:
645.302	sensuous,
648.191	catching the light in all kinds
648.191	of mysterious ways.
653.403	And the site: it's interesting;
659.038	we showed the temple
659.038	set against the Andes.
661.172	We didn't have the Andes as our site,
665.525	but after nine years, that's exactly
665.525	where we ended up,
670.347	the lines of the temple set against
670.347	nothing but pure nature,
673.835	and you turn around and you get
673.835	nothing but the city below you,
678.998	and inside, a view in all directions,
684.925	radiating gardens
687.58	from each of the alcoves,
691.277	radiating paths.
695.97	Last October, the opening ceremonies --
700.666	a beautiful, sacred event,
704.451	5,000 people from 80 countries,
707.502	a continuous river of visitors,
711.439	indigenous people
711.439	from all over South America,
714.933	some who had never left their villages.
719.103	And of course, that this temple
719.103	belongs to people,
723.625	the collective, of many cultures
723.625	and walks of life,
729.084	many beliefs,
730.524	and for me, what's most important
730.524	is what it feels like on the inside;
735.161	that it feel intimate,
738.011	sacred,
739.79	and that everyone is welcome.
742.194	And if even a few who come
746.837	have the same reaction
746.837	as that security guard,
751.704	then it truly would be their temple.
757.062	And I would love that.
758.687	Thank you.
759.885	(Applause)
