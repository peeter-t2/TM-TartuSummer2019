13.039	The power of yet.
15.944	I heard about a high school in Chicago
18.547	where students had to pass
18.547	a certain number of courses to graduate,
22.723	and if they didn't pass a course,
22.723	"they got the grade ""Not Yet."""
28.246	And I thought that was fantastic,
30.699	because if you get a failing grade,
30.699	you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.
34.484	"But if you get the grade ""Not Yet"","
37.408	you understand that
37.408	you're on a learning curve.
40.927	It gives you a path into the future.
44.337	"""Not Yet"" also gave me insight"
48.125	into a critical event early in my career,
52.425	a real turning point.
54.598	I wanted to see
56.093	how children coped
56.093	with challenge and difficulty,
61.554	so I gave 10-year-olds
64.746	problems that were
64.746	slightly too hard for them.
69.085	Some of them reacted
69.085	in a shockingly positive way.
74.108	They said things like,
74.108	"""I love a challenge,"""
78.132	"or, ""You know, I was hoping"
78.132	"this would be informative."""
83.751	They understood that their abilities
83.751	could be developed.
89.71	They had what I call a growth mindset.
93.581	But other students felt
93.581	it was tragic, catastrophic.
98.978	From their more fixed mindset perspective,
103.279	their intelligence
103.279	had been up for judgment,
107.225	and they failed.
110.219	Instead of luxuriating
110.219	in the power of yet,
115.319	they were gripped in the tyranny of now.
119.722	So what do they do next?
121.674	I'll tell you what they do next.
124.104	In one study, they told us
124.104	they would probably cheat the next time
130.341	instead of studying more
130.341	if they failed a test.
134.277	In another study, after a failure,
137.684	they looked for someone
137.684	who did worse than they did
140.823	so they could feel really
140.823	good about themselves.
145.327	And in study after study,
145.327	they have run from difficulty.
151.461	Scientists measured
151.461	the electrical activity from the brain
157.105	as students confronted an error.
160.251	On the left, you see
160.251	the fixed-mindset students.
164.311	There's hardly any activity.
166.768	They run from the error.
169.069	They don't engage with it.
171.694	But on the right, you have the students
171.694	with the growth mindset,
175.365	the idea that abilities can be developed.
179.308	They engage deeply.
181.253	Their brain is on fire with yet.
184.334	They engage deeply.
186.652	They process the error.
188.679	They learn from it and they correct it.
193.91	How are we raising our children?
196.6	Are we raising them
196.6	for now instead of yet?
201.783	Are we raising kids
201.783	who are obsessed with getting As?
206.921	Are we raising kids who don't know
206.921	how to dream big dreams?
212.375	Their biggest goal is getting the next A,
212.375	or the next test score?
219.311	And are they carrying this need
219.311	for constant validation with them
225.973	into their future lives?
228.14	Maybe, because employers
228.14	are coming to me and saying,
232.271	"""We have already raised a generation"
235.767	of young workers
235.767	who can't get through the day
239.873	"without an award."""
242.462	So what can we do?
245.469	How can we build that bridge to yet?
249.277	Here are some things we can do.
251.392	First of all, we can praise wisely,
255.391	not praising intelligence or talent.
258.623	That has failed.
260.457	Don't do that anymore.
262.119	But praising the process
262.119	that kids engage in,
266.647	their effort, their strategies,
266.647	their focus, their perseverance,
270.928	their improvement.
272.601	This process praise creates kids
272.601	who are hardy and resilient.
279.344	There are other ways to reward yet.
282.503	We recently teamed up with game scientists
286.801	from the University of Washington
288.945	to create a new online math game
288.945	that rewarded yet.
294.077	In this game, students were rewarded
294.077	for effort, strategy and progress.
300.313	The usual math game
302.869	rewards you for getting answers
302.869	right, right now,
307.299	but this game rewarded process.
310.393	And we got more effort,
313.184	more strategies,
315.379	more engagement
315.379	over longer periods of time,
319.297	and more perseverance when they hit
319.297	really, really hard problems.
325.489	"Just the words ""yet"""
325.489	"or ""not yet,"" we're finding,"
329.107	give kids greater confidence,
332.575	give them a path into the future
332.575	that creates greater persistence.
339.333	And we can actually
339.333	change students' mindsets.
344.875	In one study, we taught them
347.236	that every time they push out
347.236	of their comfort zone
351.717	to learn something new and difficult,
355.163	the neurons in their brain
355.163	can form new, stronger connections,
360.839	and over time, they can get smarter.
364.288	Look what happened: In this study,
366.815	students who were not taught
366.815	this growth mindset
370.592	continued to show declining grades
370.592	over this difficult school transition,
376.342	but those who were taught this lesson
376.342	showed a sharp rebound in their grades.
383.318	We have shown this now,
383.318	this kind of improvement,
389.265	with thousands and thousands of kids,
389.265	especially struggling students.
396.072	So let's talk about equality.
400.291	In our country,
400.291	there are groups of students
404.553	who chronically underperform,
407.372	for example, children in inner cities,
410.544	or children on Native American
410.544	reservations.
414.027	And they've done so poorly for so long
417.788	that many people think it's inevitable.
421.404	But when educators create
421.404	growth mindset classrooms
427.319	steeped in yet,
429.714	equality happens.
432.858	And here are just a few examples.
437.027	In one year, a kindergarten class
437.027	in Harlem, New York
442.938	scored in the 95th percentile
447.461	on the national achievement test.
450.634	Many of those kids could not hold a pencil
455.02	when they arrived at school.
457.776	In one year,
460.588	fourth-grade students
460.588	in the South Bronx, way behind,
465.448	became the number one fourth-grade class
465.448	in the state of New York
471.734	on the state math test.
475.083	In a year, to a year and a half,
479.427	Native American students
479.427	in a school on a reservation
484.801	went from the bottom
484.801	of their district to the top,
491.824	and that district included
491.824	affluent sections of Seattle.
497.193	So the Native kids
497.193	outdid the Microsoft kids.
505.125	This happened because the meaning
505.125	of effort and difficulty were transformed.
512.921	Before, effort and difficulty
516.64	made them feel dumb,
516.64	made them feel like giving up,
521.841	but now, effort and difficulty,
525.623	that's when their neurons
525.623	are making new connections,
529.159	stronger connections.
530.968	That's when they're getting smarter.
534.796	I received a letter recently
534.796	from a 13-year-old boy.
540.19	"He said, ""Dear Professor Dweck,"
544.209	I appreciate that your writing
544.209	is based on solid scientific research,
551.182	and that's why I decided
551.182	to put it into practice.
556.188	I put more effort into my schoolwork,
560.099	into my relationship with my family,
563.054	and into my relationship
563.054	with kids at school,
567.302	and I experienced great improvement
567.302	in all of those areas.
574.44	I now realize I've wasted
574.44	"most of my life."""
581.357	Let's not waste any more lives,
587.096	because once we know
590.898	that abilities are capable of such growth,
596.304	it becomes a basic human right
596.304	for children, all children,
603.268	to live in places that create that growth,
608.933	"to live in places filled with ""yet""."
614.987	Thank you.
616.162	(Applause)
