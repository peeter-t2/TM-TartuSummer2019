25	I told you three things last year.
27	I told you that the statistics of the world
30	have not been made properly available.
33	Because of that, we still have the old mindset
35	of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
39	And that animated graphics can make a difference.
44	Things are changing
46	and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,
50	it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
55	(Applause)
58	And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
63	So three things have happened.
64	U.N. opened their statistic databases,
67	and we have a new version of the software
71	up working as a beta on the net,
73	so you don't have to download it any longer.
76	And let me repeat what you saw last year.
78	The bubbles are the countries.
79	Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --
83	and there you have the length of life in years.
87	This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,
90	those were developing countries.
91	"At that time there was a ""we"" and ""them."""
93	There was a huge difference in the world.
95	But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
99	And this is what happens.
101	You can see how China is the red, big bubble.
104	The blue there is India.
105	And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be
108	a little more serious this year in showing you
110	how things really changed.
113	And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
116	Large families still, and the HIV epidemic
119	brought down the countries like this.
121	This is more or less what we saw last year,
124	and this is how it will go on into the future.
127	And I will talk on, is this possible?
129	Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
133	Because this is where we are.
135	Will it be possible that this will happen?
139	I cover my lifetime here, you know?
141	I expect to live 100 years.
143	And this is where we are today.
145	Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
153	And I would like to show that against child survival.
158	We'll swap the axis.
160	Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --
164	four kids dying there, 200 dying there.
167	And this is GDP per capita on this axis.
170	And this was 2007.
173	And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --
177	here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.
183	Some countries still had statistics.
185	We are looking down in the archive,
187	and when we are down into 1820,
191	there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
195	(Laughter)
198	But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
202	And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
206	So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.
209	How they got slowly richer and richer,
212	and they add statistics.
213	Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
215	You see the importance of that?
217	And here, children don't live longer.
219	The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,
223	because most of this statistics is Europe.
225	It was only by the turn of the century
228	that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
231	This is India coming up, with the first data from India.
234	And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
239	And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
244	And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,
246	not getting so rich.
247	There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
250	It moves this way over here.
252	And the bubbles keep moving up there,
254	and this is what the world looks like today.
256	(Applause)
262	Let us have a look at the United States.
265	"We have a function here -- I can tell the world, ""Stay where you are."""
269	And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --
272	I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.
275	And we can see that the United States
278	goes to the right of the mainstream.
281	They are on the money side all the time.
284	And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --
290	present, contemporary India.
292	And that means United States was richer,
294	but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
299	And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.
302	The Philippines of today has almost the same economy
306	as the United States during the First World War.
308	But we have to bring United States forward quite a while
312	to find the same health of the United States
315	as we have in the Philippines.
317	About 1957 here, the health of the United States
320	is the same as the Philippines.
322	And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,
325	is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,
328	are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,
333	having human resources than they are economically.
336	There's a discrepancy in what's happening today
338	in the emerging economies.
340	There now, social benefits, social progress,
344	are going ahead of economical progress.
347	And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
354	And how long do we have to bring United States
357	to get the same health as Chile has today?
360	I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --
365	the United States has the same health as Chile.
367	Chile's catching up!
369	Within some years Chile may have better child survival
371	than the United States.
373	This is really a change, that you have this lag
376	of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
381	And behind the health is the educational level.
383	And there's a lot of infrastructure things,
385	and general human resources are there.
388	Now we can take away this --
391	and I would like to show you the rate of speed,
395	the rate of change, how fast they have gone.
398	And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
406	And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
409	And I'm going to stage a race here
411	between this sort of yellowish Ford here
414	and the red Toyota down there,
416	and the brownish Volvo.
418	(Laughter)
420	And here we go. Here we go.
422	The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,
425	and the United States Ford is going off-road there.
428	And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
429	This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now
431	the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --
434	can you see that?
435	And they are taking over Sweden,
436	and they are now healthier than Sweden.
438	That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
440	(Laughter)
443	And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
447	They really caught up.
449	And this changes gradually.
451	We have to look over generations to understand it.
454	And let me show you my own sort of family history --
459	we made these graphs here.
461	And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
465	And this is my family.
468	This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
473	Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.
476	And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
480	And Sweden was like Mozambique.
482	And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
484	She took care of me as a child,
486	so I'm not talking about statistic now --
488	now it's oral history in my family.
491	That's when I believe statistics,
492	when it's grandma-verified statistics.
495	(Laughter)
498	I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
501	Sweden was like Ghana.
502	It's interesting to see the enormous diversity
505	within sub-Saharan Africa.
508	I told you last year, I'll tell you again,
510	my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?
513	I'm the Mexican in the family.
515	And my daughter, she was born in Chile,
517	and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,
519	now the healthiest country on this Earth.
521	It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,
523	with better child survival.
525	But they're very small, you know?
526	They're so close to the hospital we can never
528	beat them out in these forests.
529	(Laughter)
532	But homage to Singapore.
533	Singapore is the best one.
535	Now this looks also like a very good story.
539	But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.
543	Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.
546	We can also make the color here represent the variable --
551	and what am I choosing here?
552	Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
557	This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
562	And China was emitting 0.6,
564	and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
568	And what happens when we moved on?
571	Well, you see the nice story of getting richer
573	and getting healthier --
574	everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
579	There is no one who has done it so far.
582	And we don't have all the updated data
585	any longer, because this is really hot data today.
588	And there we are, 2001.
591	And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,
595	many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,
599	they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
602	The Minister of the Environment of India said,
604	"""Well, you were the one who caused the problem."""
607	The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --
610	they were the ones who caused the climate change.
613	"""But we forgive you, because you didn't know it."
615	But from now on, we count per capita.
618	From now on we count per capita.
620	"And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."""
623	This really shows you, we have not seen good economic
626	and health progress anywhere in the world
628	without destroying the climate.
633	And this is really what has to be changed.
636	I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,
639	but I don't think it's like this.
641	The world is quite a messy place.
643	This we can call Dollar Street.
645	Everyone lives on this street here.
647	What they earn here -- what number they live on --
650	is how much they earn per day.
651	This family earns about one dollar per day.
655	We drive up the street here,
656	we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
660	And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,
663	and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
665	And how do they live?
667	If we look at the bed here, we can see
670	that they sleep on a rug on the floor.
673	This is what poverty line is --
678	the food for the day.
680	This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
683	And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
686	I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see
688	the sofa immediately here.
690	(Laughter)
692	And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
696	And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,
699	you see the family still sitting on the floor there.
701	Although there is a sofa,
703	if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that
705	the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
710	It comes beyond here, when you really can get
712	good working conditions in the family.
715	And if you really want to see the difference,
717	you look at the toilet over here.
719	This can change. This can change.
721	These are all pictures and images from Africa,
724	and it can become much better.
727	We can get out of poverty.
729	My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.
732	I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers
735	who were on the verge of famine.
738	And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
740	The nice thing here is that you can't see
742	who are the researchers in this picture.
744	That's when research functions in poor societies --
747	you must really live with the people.
751	When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.
755	It's about having food.
757	And these two young farmers, they are girls now --
759	because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --
763	they discuss with a trained agronomist.
765	This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,
769	and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --
771	the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
775	And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,
778	and that's to survive in poverty.
781	That's one context.
782	Getting out of poverty.
784	"The women told us one thing. ""Get us technology."
787	We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
790	Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,
793	"then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."""
796	Technology will bring you out of poverty,
799	but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
803	And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
806	But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling
808	so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
811	She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market
814	and doesn't have to stay home.
816	And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.
819	It's also good with credit.
821	Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
824	And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
827	You can do this.
829	I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that
832	the seemingly impossible is possible.
835	Africa has not done bad.
837	In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation
840	to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,
843	with a functioning nation and state.
846	I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world
849	during the last 50 years.
850	Because we don't consider where they came from.
852	It's this stupid concept of developing countries
855	that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,
858	and says that Mozambique did worse.
861	We have to know a little more about the world.
863	I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
866	He knows everything.
867	He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
869	I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
872	(Laughter)
874	But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --
876	industrialized and developing.
878	And I know 200, I know about the small data.
881	But you can do that.
882	(Applause)
887	But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?
889	You make a PowerPoint, you know?
891	(Laughter)
896	Homage to the Office package, no?
900	What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
902	I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
905	Everyone wants your pet thing.
907	If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
910	If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,
912	you love equity between gender.
915	Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
917	On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
919	We need everything.
921	All these things are important for development,
923	especially when you just get out of poverty
925	and you should go towards welfare.
928	Now, what we need to think about
930	is, what is a goal for development,
933	and what are the means for development?
934	Let me first grade what are the most important means.
938	Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,
940	is the most important thing for development
944	because it explains 80 percent of survival.
947	Governance. To have a government which functions --
950	that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.
954	It was the government that made law function finally.
958	Education, human resources are important.
960	Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.
964	Environment is important.
966	Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
968	Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?
971	We are not interested in money.
973	Money is not a goal.
974	It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
978	Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,
981	but it's not a goal.
983	And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
987	Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy
989	-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.
991	And that's good, it gets two plusses.
993	Environment is very, very crucial.
995	There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
997	But where are the important goals?
999	Of course, it's human rights.
1001	Human rights is the goal,
1003	but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
1007	And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,
1011	because that's what brings joy to life.
1013	That's the value of living.
1015	So the seemingly impossible is possible.
1018	Even African countries can achieve this.
1021	And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
1027	And remember, please remember my main message,
1031	which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
1034	We can have a good world.
1036	I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,
1039	and I think I will convince you also by culture.
1045	(Laughter)
1049	(Applause)
1050	Bring me my sword!
1056	Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
1061	It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years
1066	has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
1072	(Laughter)
1074	And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible
1079	by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --
1083	this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,
1086	in the last year we had war.
1089	And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
1092	And I'm going to take this blade of steel,
1098	and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,
1103	and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
1108	Can I request a moment of absolute silence?
1123	(Applause)
