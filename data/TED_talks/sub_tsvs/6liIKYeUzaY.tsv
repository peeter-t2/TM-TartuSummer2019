12.952	I want to start by doing an experiment.
16.857	I'm going to play three videos
16.857	of a rainy day.
20.935	But I've replaced the audio
20.935	of one of the videos,
24.843	and instead of the sound of rain,
27.241	I've added the sound of bacon frying.
31.137	So I want you think carefully
31.137	which one the clip with the bacon is.
35.695	(Rain falls)
39.394	(Rain falls)
43.627	(Rain falls)
52.611	All right.
55.064	Actually, I lied.
57.662	They're all bacon.
58.956	(Bacon sizzles)
64.276	(Applause)
69.216	My point here isn't really
69.216	to make you hungry
72.513	every time you see a rainy scene,
74.186	but it's to show that our brains
74.186	are conditioned to embrace the lies.
80.696	We're not looking for accuracy.
83.754	So on the subject of deception,
86.563	I wanted to quote one
86.563	of my favorite authors.
89.95	"In ""The Decay of Lying,"""
89.95	Oscar Wilde establishes the idea
96.923	that all bad art comes from copying
96.923	nature and being realistic;
103.096	and all great art comes
103.096	from lying and deceiving,
109.03	and telling beautiful, untrue things.
112.087	So when you're watching a movie
116.89	and a phone rings,
118.426	it's not actually ringing.
120.942	It's been added later
120.942	in postproduction in a studio.
125.22	All of the sounds you hear are fake.
128.098	Everything, apart from the dialogue,
129.932	is fake.
131.11	When you watch a movie and you see
131.11	a bird flapping its wings --
134.794	(Wings flap)
138.141	They haven't really recorded the bird.
140.428	It sounds a lot more realistic
140.428	if you record a sheet
145.446	or shaking kitchen gloves.
147.022	(Flaps)
150.849	The burning of a cigarette up close --
153.816	(Cigarette burns)
157.351	It actually sounds a lot more authentic
160.126	if you take a small Saran Wrap ball
162.995	and release it.
164.237	(A Saran Warp ball being released)
167.869	Punches?
169.296	(Punch)
170.842	Oops, let me play that again.
172.798	(Punch)
174.535	That's often done by sticking
174.535	a knife in vegetables,
178.295	usually cabbage.
180.661	(Cabbage stabbed with a knife)
182.788	The next one -- it's breaking bones.
185.776	(Bones break)
188.67	Well, no one was really harmed.
191.028	It's actually ...
193.163	breaking celery or frozen lettuce.
196.442	(Breaking frozen lettuce or celery)
198.947	(Laughter)
201.253	Making the right sounds
201.253	is not always as easy
205.992	as a trip to the supermarket
207.923	and going to the vegetable section.
210.643	But it's often a lot more
210.643	complicated than that.
213.042	So let's reverse-engineer together
216.089	the creation of a sound effect.
218.437	One of my favorite stories
218.437	comes from Frank Serafine.
221.81	He's a contributor to our library,
223.685	"and a great sound designer for ""Tron"""
223.685	"and ""Star Trek"" and others."
228.291	He was part of the Paramount team
228.291	that won the Oscar for best sound
233.573	"for ""The Hunt for Red October."""
235.528	In this Cold War classic, in the '90s,
238.942	they were asked to produce the sound
238.942	of the propeller of the submarine.
243.751	So they had a small problem:
245.12	they couldn't really find
245.12	a submarine in West Hollywood.
248.664	So basically, what they did is,
252.346	they went to a friend's swimming pool,
255.725	and Frank performed
255.725	a cannonball, or bomba.
261.069	They placed an underwater mic
263.289	and an overhead mic
263.289	outside the swimming pool.
266.089	So here's what the underwater
266.089	mic sounds like.
269.366	(Underwater plunge)
271.608	Adding the overhead mic,
273.138	it sounded a bit like this:
275.115	(Water splashes)
277.514	So now they took the sound
277.514	and pitched it one octave down,
281.985	sort of like slowing down a record.
284.85	(Water splashes at lower octave)
287.929	And then they removed
287.929	a lot of the high frequencies.
290.721	(Water splashes)
293.02	And pitched it down another octave.
296.314	(Water splashes at lower octave)
298.626	And then they added
298.626	a little bit of the splash
301.156	from the overhead microphone.
303.464	(Water splashes)
306.653	And by looping and repeating that sound,
309.215	they got this:
310.429	(Propeller churns)
316.463	So, creativity and technology put together
316.463	in order to create the illusion
323.015	that we're inside the submarine.
326.868	But once you've created your sounds
330.253	and you've synced them to the image,
332.671	you want those sounds to live
332.671	in the world of the story.
337.397	And one the best ways to do
337.397	that is to add reverb.
341.997	So this is the first audio tool
341.997	I want to talk about.
345.198	Reverberation, or reverb,
345.198	is the persistence of the sound
350.344	after the original sound has ended.
352.299	So it's sort of like the --
354.891	all the reflections from the materials,
357.951	the objects and the walls
357.951	around the sound.
360.862	Take, for example, the sound of a gunshot.
363.098	The original sound is less
363.098	than half a second long.
368.138	(Gunshot)
369.747	By adding reverb,
371.46	we can make it sound like
371.46	it was recorded inside a bathroom.
375.47	(Gunshot reverbs in bathroom)
377.057	Or like it was recorded
377.057	inside a chapel or a church.
380.887	(Gunshot reverbs church)
383.043	Or in a canyon.
386.199	(Gunshot reverbs in canyon)
387.984	So reverb gives us a lot of information
390.661	about the space between the listener
390.661	and the original sound source.
395.615	If the sound is the taste,
397.748	then reverb is sort of like
397.748	the smell of the sound.
402.309	But reverb can do a lot more.
404.491	Listening to a sound
404.491	with a lot less reverberation
408.425	than the on-screen action
410.532	is going to immediately signify to us
413.576	that we're listening to a commentator,
416.243	to an objective narrator that's not
416.243	participating in the on-screen action.
422.471	Also, emotionally intimate
422.471	moments in cinema
426.686	are often heard with zero reverb,
428.657	because that's how it would sound
428.657	if someone was speaking inside our ear.
433.024	On the completely other side,
435.009	adding a lot of reverb to a voice
437.529	is going to make us think
437.529	that we're listening to a flashback,
441.637	or perhaps that we're inside
441.637	the head of a character
445.946	or that we're listening
445.946	to the voice of God.
448.446	Or, even more powerful in film,
450.732	Morgan Freeman.
452.243	(Laughter)
453.551	So --
454.742	(Applause)
457.502	But what are some other tools or hacks
461.397	that sound designers use?
464.186	Well, here's a really big one.
471.901	It's silence.
473.807	A few moments of silence
473.807	is going to make us pay attention.
477.881	And in the Western world,
480.345	we're not really used to verbal silences.
482.492	They're considered awkward or rude.
486.537	So silence preceding verbal communication
491.021	can create a lot of tension.
493.105	But imagine a really big Hollywood movie,
496.834	where it's full of explosions
496.834	and automatic guns.
502.389	Loud stops being loud
502.389	anymore, after a while.
506.008	So in a yin-yang way,
507.976	silence needs loudness
507.976	and loudness needs silence
511.137	for either of them to have any effect.
514.35	But what does silence mean?
515.751	Well, it depends how
515.751	it's used in each film.
519.416	Silence can place us inside
519.416	the head of a character
522.619	or provoke thought.
524.261	We often relate silences with ...
528.654	contemplation,
530.558	meditation,
533.185	being deep in thought.
536.569	But apart from having one meaning,
539.695	silence becomes a blank canvas
541.889	upon which the viewer is invited
541.889	to the paint their own thoughts.
546.962	But I want to make it clear:
546.962	there is no such thing as silence.
551.192	And I know this sounds like the most
551.192	pretentious TED Talk statement ever.
556.835	But even if you were to enter
556.835	a room with zero reverberation
562.164	and zero external sounds,
564.253	you would still be able to hear
564.253	the pumping of your own blood.
568.004	And in cinema, traditionally,
568.004	there was never a silent moment
572.345	because of the sound of the projector.
574.716	And even in today's Dolby world,
578.034	there's not really any moment of silence
578.034	if you listen around you.
582.485	There's always some sort of noise.
584.734	Now, since there's no such
584.734	thing as silence,
587.685	what do filmmakers
587.685	and sound designers use?
591.28	Well, as a synonym,
591.28	they often use ambiences.
596.307	Ambiences are the unique background sounds
600.2	that are specific to each location.
603.272	Each location has a unique sound,
605.145	and each room has a unique sound,
607.145	which is called room tone.
608.742	So here's a recording
608.742	of a market in Morocco.
611.189	(Voices, music)
617.47	And here's a recording
617.47	of Times Square in New York.
620.843	(Traffic sounds, car horns, voices)
627.449	Room tone is the addition of all
627.449	the noises inside the room:
631.095	the ventilation, the heating, the fridge.
633.508	Here's a recording
633.508	of my apartment in Brooklyn.
636.443	(You can hear the ventilation, the boiler,
636.443	the fridge and street traffic)
647.422	Ambiences work in a most primal way.
652.718	They can speak directly
652.718	to our brain subconsciously.
656.538	So, birds chirping outside your window
656.538	may indicate normality,
662.937	perhaps because, as a species,
665.752	we've been used to that sound
665.752	every morning for millions of years.
670.36	(Birds chirp)
677.839	On the other hand, industrial sounds
677.839	have been introduced to us
681.504	a little more recently.
683.969	Even though I really like
683.969	them personally --
686.051	they've been used by one
686.051	of my heroes, David Lynch,
688.488	and his sound designer, Alan Splet --
690.447	industrial sounds often carry
690.447	negative connotations.
693.033	(Machine noises)
700.092	Now, sound effects can tap
700.092	into our emotional memory.
706.869	Occasionally, they can be so significant
709.25	that they become a character in a movie.
712.569	The sound of thunder may indicate
712.569	divine intervention or anger.
718.373	(Thunder)
723.957	Church bells can remind us
723.957	of the passing of time,
727.956	or perhaps our own mortality.
731.827	(Bells ring)
739.773	And breaking of glass can
739.773	indicate the end of a relationship
744.287	or a friendship.
746.39	(Glass breaks)
748.788	Scientists believe that dissonant sounds,
752.365	for example, brass or wind
752.365	instruments played very loud,
758.438	may remind us of animal howls in nature
762.906	and therefore create a sense
762.906	of irritation or fear.
766.506	(Brass and wind instruments play)
772.714	So now we've spoken
772.714	about on-screen sounds.
776.298	But occasionally, the source
776.298	of a sound cannot be seen.
780.955	That's what we call offscreen sounds,
783.503	"or ""acousmatic."""
785.641	Acousmatic sounds --
787.887	"well, the term ""acousmatic"" comes"
787.887	from Pythagoras in ancient Greece,
792.944	who used to teach behind
792.944	a veil or curtain for years,
796.559	not revealing himself to his disciples.
799.773	I think the mathematician
799.773	and philosopher thought that,
803.727	in that way,
805.584	his students might focus
805.584	more on the voice,
809.645	and his words and its meaning,
811.633	rather than the visual of him speaking.
814.827	So sort of like the Wizard of Oz,
817.55	"or ""1984's"" Big Brother,"
822.388	separating the voice from its source,
825.678	separating cause and effect
828.379	sort of creates a sense
828.379	of ubiquity or panopticism,
832.198	and therefore, authority.
835.156	There's a strong tradition
835.156	of acousmatic sound.
839.129	Nuns in monasteries in Rome and Venice
839.129	used to sing in rooms
845.763	up in galleries close to the ceiling,
849.646	creating the illusion that we're listening
849.646	to angels up in the sky.
854.39	Richard Wagner famously
854.39	created the hidden orchestra
858.104	that was placed in a pit
858.104	between the stage and the audience.
861.964	And one of my heroes, Aphex Twin,
861.964	famously hid in dark corners of clubs.
867.42	I think what all these masters knew
867.42	is that by hiding the source,
872.187	you create a sense of mystery.
873.874	This has been seen
873.874	in cinema over and over,
875.967	with Hitchcock,
875.967	"and Ridley Scott in ""Alien."""
879.071	Hearing a sound without knowing its source
881.487	is going to create some sort of tension.
886.53	Also, it can minimize certain visual
886.53	restrictions that directors have
892.168	and can show something
892.168	that wasn't there during filming.
895.882	And if all this sounds
895.882	a little theoretical,
897.991	I wanted to play a little video.
901.289	(Toy squeaks)
904.383	(Typewriter)
907.761	(Drums)
911.164	(Ping-pong)
914.484	(Knives being sharpened)
917.786	(Record scratches)
921.405	(Saw cuts)
922.615	(Woman screams)
924.663	What I'm sort of trying
924.663	to demonstrate with these tools
929.93	is that sound is a language.
932.516	It can trick us by transporting
932.516	us geographically;
936.571	it can change the mood;
938.579	it can set the pace;
941.482	it can make us laugh
941.482	or it can make us scared.
946.698	On a personal level, I fell
946.698	in love with that language
950.072	a few years ago,
951.413	and somehow managed to make it
951.413	into some sort of profession.
957.274	And I think with our work
957.274	through the sound library,
960.524	we're trying to kind of expand
960.524	the vocabulary of that language.
967.797	And in that way, we want
967.797	to offer the right tools
971.303	to sound designers,
972.967	filmmakers,
974.339	and video game and app designers,
976.748	to keep telling even better stories
980.382	and creating even more beautiful lies.
983.138	So thanks for listening.
984.449	(Applause)
