16.576	There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants
16.576	who make a lot of money.
19.553	In fact, they make
19.553	their living on this stuff.
21.751	I'm going to try to save you
21.751	all the time and money
24.183	and go through it in the next
24.183	three minutes, so bear with me.
27.065	Started a website in 2005
27.065	with a few friends, called Reddit.com.
30.259	It's what you'd call
30.259	a social news website;
32.319	basically, the democratic front page
32.319	of the best stuff on the web.
35.597	You find some interesting content --
35.597	say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,
39.483	and a community of your peers votes up
39.483	if they like it, down if they don't.
43.072	That creates the front page.
44.433	It's always rising, falling;
44.433	a half million people visit every day.
47.614	But this isn't about Reddit.
48.975	It's about discovering new things
48.975	that pop up on the web.
51.7	In the last four years,
51.7	we've seen all kinds of memes,
54.268	all kinds of trends get born
54.268	right on our front page.
56.917	This isn't about Reddit itself,
56.917	it's actually about humpback whales.
60.157	Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace,
60.157	an environmental organization
63.861	that wanted to stop the Japanese
63.861	government's whaling campaign.
66.969	The whales were getting killed;
66.969	they wanted to put an end to it.
70.062	One of the ways they wanted to do it
71.839	was to put a tracking chip
71.839	inside one of the whales.
74.351	But to personify the movement,
74.351	they wanted to name it.
76.993	So in true web fashion,
76.993	they put together a poll,
79.336	where they had a bunch of very erudite,
79.336	very thoughtful, cultured names.
82.784	I believe this is the Farsi word
82.784	"for ""immortal."""
85.062	"I think this means ""divine power"
85.062	"of the ocean"" in a Polynesian language."
89.12	And then there was this:
89.12	"""Mister Splashy Pants."""
91.974	(Laughter)
93.232	And this was a special name.
94.621	"Mister Pants, or ""Splashy"" to his friends,"
94.621	was very popular on the Internet.
98.318	In fact, someone on Reddit thought,
100.09	"""What a great thing,"
100.09	"we should all vote this up."""
102.428	And Redditors responded and all agreed.
104.855	So the voting started.
106.168	We got behind it ourselves;
106.168	we changed our logo for the day,
109.062	from the alien to Splashy,
109.062	to help the cause.
111.656	And it wasn't long before other sites
111.656	like Fark and Boing Boing
114.672	and the rest of the Internet started
114.672	"saying, ""We love Splashy Pants!"""
117.973	So it went from about five percent,
117.973	which was when this meme started,
121.642	to 70 percent at the end of voting.
124.26	Pretty impressive, right?
124.26	We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.
127.67	Just kidding -- Greenpeace
127.67	actually wasn't that crazy about it,
130.72	because they wanted one
130.72	of the more thoughtful names to win.
133.57	"They said, ""No, just kidding."
133.57	"We'll give it another week of voting."""
136.801	Well, that got us a little angry,
136.801	so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.
140.26	(Laughter)
141.285	And the Reddit community --
141.285	really, the rest of the Internet,
144.197	really got behind this.
145.372	Facebook groups were created.
146.795	Facebook applications were created.
148.517	"The idea was, ""Vote your conscience,"
148.517	"vote for Mister Splashy Pants."""
151.763	People were putting up signs
151.763	in the real world about this whale.
154.833	(Laughter)
155.858	This was the final vote:
158.643	To give you an idea of the landslide,
158.643	the next highest name pulled in three.
162.664	There was a clear lesson:
162.664	the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
165.825	Which is obvious. It's a great name.
167.587	Everyone wants to hear their news
167.587	"anchor say, ""Mister Splashy Pants."""
170.863	(Laughter)
171.888	I think that's what helped drive this.
173.741	What was cool were the repercussions.
175.645	Greenpeace created an entire
175.645	marketing campaign around it --
178.55	Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,
180.367	an e-card so you could send
180.367	your friend a dancing Splashy.
183.112	But even more important
183.112	was that they accomplished their mission.
186.4	The Japanese government
186.4	called off their whaling expedition.
189.256	Mission accomplished:
189.256	Greenpeace was thrilled,
191.447	the whales were happy -- that's a quote.
193.38	(Laughter)
194.405	And actually, Redditors
194.405	in the Internet community
197.578	were happy to participate,
197.578	but they weren't whale lovers.
200.282	A few, certainly, but we're talking
200.282	about a lot of people,
203.033	really interested
203.033	and caught up in this meme.
205.172	Greenpeace came back to the site
205.172	and thanked Reddit for its participation.
208.696	But this wasn't really altruism;
208.696	just interest in doing something cool.
212.327	This is how the Internet works.
212.327	This is that great big secret.
215.267	The Internet provides
215.267	a level playing field.
217.351	Your link is as good as your link,
217.351	which is as good as my link.
220.339	With a browser, anyone can get
220.339	to any website no matter your budget.
223.561	That is, as long as you can
223.561	keep net neutrality in place.
226.255	Another important thing is it costs
226.255	nothing to get content online.
229.377	There are so many
229.377	publishing tools available,
231.499	it only takes a few minutes
231.499	to produce something.
233.821	and the cost of iteration
233.821	is so cheap, you might as well.
236.525	If you do, be genuine.
236.525	Be honest, up-front.
238.562	One of the great lessons
238.562	Greenpeace learned
240.605	is that it's OK to lose control,
242.453	OK to take yourself
242.453	a little less seriously,
244.545	given that, even though
244.545	it's a very serious cause,
246.922	you could ultimately achieve your goal.
248.858	That's the final message I want to share:
248.858	you can do well online.
252.057	But no longer is the message
252.057	coming from just the top down.
254.999	If you want to succeed you've got
254.999	to be OK to lose control.
257.864	Thank you.
259.294	(Applause)
