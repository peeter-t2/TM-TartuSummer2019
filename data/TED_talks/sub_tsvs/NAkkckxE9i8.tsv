13.309	As a singer-songwriter,
15.412	people often ask me about my influences
15.412	or, as I like to call them,
19.151	my sonic lineages.
21.563	And I could easily tell you
23.215	that I was shaped by the jazz
23.215	and hip hop that I grew up with,
26.659	by the Ethiopian heritage of my ancestors,
29.994	or by the 1980s pop
29.994	on my childhood radio stations.
33.783	But beyond genre,
33.783	there is another question:
37.398	how do the sounds we hear every day
37.398	influence the music that we make?
42.547	I believe that everyday soundscape
44.624	can be the most unexpected
44.624	inspiration for songwriting,
48.089	and to look at this idea
48.089	a little bit more closely,
50.628	I'm going to talk today
50.628	about three things:
52.773	nature, language and silence --
55.821	or rather, the impossibility
55.821	of true silence.
59.827	And through this I hope to give you
59.827	a sense of a world
62.381	already alive with musical expression,
65.456	with each of us serving
65.456	as active participants,
69.461	whether we know it or not.
72.136	I'm going to start today with nature,
72.136	but before we do that,
74.978	let's quickly listen to this snippet
74.978	of an opera singer warming up.
78.602	Here it is.
80.7	(Singing)
95.91	(Singing ends)
97.571	It's beautiful, isn't it?
100.201	Gotcha!
101.376	That is actually not the sound
101.376	of an opera singer warming up.
105.161	That is the sound of a bird
107.684	slowed down to a pace
109.63	that the human ear mistakenly
109.63	recognizes as its own.
114.012	It was released as part of Peter Szöke's
118.84	"""The Unknown Music of Birds,"""
121.246	where he records many birds
121.246	and slows down their pitches
125.141	to reveal what's underneath.
127.615	Let's listen to the full-speed recording.
131.65	(Bird singing)
135.638	Now, let's hear the two of them together
137.574	so your brain can juxtapose them.
140.167	(Bird singing at slow then full speed)
158.338	(Singing ends)
162.063	It's incredible.
163.864	Perhaps the techniques of opera singing
163.864	were inspired by birdsong.
168.88	As humans, we intuitively understand birds
168.88	to be our musical teachers.
174.439	In Ethiopia, birds
174.439	are considered an integral part
177.367	of the origin of music itself.
180.542	The story goes like this:
183.538	1,500 years ago, a young man
183.538	was born in the Empire of Aksum,
188.595	a major trading center
188.595	of the ancient world.
191.525	His name was Yared.
194.402	When Yared was seven years old
194.402	his father died,
197.634	and his mother sent him to go live
197.634	with an uncle, who was a priest
201.281	of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition,
203.6	one of the oldest churches in the world.
206.892	Now, this tradition has an enormous amount
206.892	of scholarship and learning,
210.377	and Yared had to study and study
210.377	and study and study,
213.413	and one day he was studying under a tree,
216.053	when three birds came to him.
219.321	One by one, these birds
219.321	became his teachers.
222.912	They taught him music -- scales, in fact.
227.579	And Yared, eventually
227.579	recognized as Saint Yared,
230.106	used these scales to compose
230.106	five volumes of chants and hymns
234.568	for worship and celebration.
236.764	And he used these scales
236.764	to compose and to create
240.177	an indigenous musical notation system.
243.645	And these scales evolved
243.645	into what is known as kiñit,
247.292	the unique, pentatonic, five-note,
247.292	modal system that is very much alive
253.209	and thriving and still evolving
253.209	in Ethiopia today.
258.531	Now, I love this story because
258.531	it's true at multiple levels.
261.718	Saint Yared was a real, historical figure,
264.765	and the natural world
264.765	can be our musical teacher.
269.057	And we have so many examples of this:
271.235	the Pygmies of the Congo
271.235	tune their instruments
273.482	to the pitches of the birds
273.482	in the forest around them.
276.396	Musician and natural soundscape
276.396	expert Bernie Krause describes
279.598	how a healthy environment
279.598	has animals and insects
282.996	taking up low, medium
282.996	and high-frequency bands,
286.448	in exactly the same way
286.448	as a symphony does.
290.066	And countless works of music
290.066	were inspired by bird and forest song.
294.972	Yes, the natural world
294.972	can be our cultural teacher.
300.751	So let's go now to the uniquely
300.751	human world of language.
305.083	Every language communicates
305.083	with pitch to varying degrees,
308.351	whether it's Mandarin Chinese,
309.813	where a shift in melodic inflection
309.813	gives the same phonetic syllable
313.829	an entirely different meaning,
315.61	to a language like English,
316.976	where a raised pitch
316.976	at the end of a sentence ...
319.37	(Going up in pitch) implies a question?
321.412	(Laughter)
323.045	As an Ethiopian-American woman,
324.728	I grew up around the language
324.728	of Amharic, Amhariña.
327.16	It was my first language,
327.16	the language of my parents,
329.663	one of the main languages of Ethiopia.
332.716	And there are a million reasons
332.716	to fall in love with this language:
335.934	its depth of poetics,
335.934	its double entendres,
338.799	its wax and gold, its humor,
341.44	its proverbs that illuminate
341.44	the wisdom and follies of life.
346.038	But there's also this melodicism,
346.038	a musicality built right in.
350.734	And I find this distilled most clearly
352.633	in what I like to call
352.633	emphatic language --
355.13	language that's meant
355.13	to highlight or underline
357.39	or that springs from surprise.
360.036	"Take, for example, the word: ""indey."""
363.204	Now, if there are Ethiopians
363.204	in the audience,
365.33	they're probably chuckling to themselves,
367.361	because the word means
367.361	"something like ""No!"""
369.469	"or ""How could he?"" or ""No, he didn't."""
371.304	It kind of depends on the situation.
373.429	But when I was a kid,
373.429	this was my very favorite word,
377.304	and I think it's because it has a pitch.
380.721	It has a melody.
381.956	You can almost see the shape
381.956	as it springs from someone's mouth.
384.981	"""Indey"" -- it dips, and then raises again."
388.391	And as a musician and composer,
388.391	when I hear that word,
391.504	something like this
391.504	is floating through my mind.
395.982	"(Music and singing ""Indey"")"
405.832	(Music ends)
408.711	Or take, for example, the phrase
408.711	"for ""It is right"" or ""It is correct"" --"
412.726	"""Lickih nehu ... Lickih nehu."""
414.322	It's an affirmation, an agreement.
416.979	"""Lickih nehu."""
418.161	When I hear that phrase,
419.337	something like this starts rolling
419.337	through my mind.
424.031	"(Music and singing ""Lickih nehu"")"
431.572	(Music ends)
434.199	And in both of those cases,
434.199	what I did was I took the melody
437.04	and the phrasing
437.04	of those words and phrases
439.523	and I turned them into musical parts
439.523	to use in these short compositions.
444.539	And I like to write bass lines,
446.044	so they both ended up
446.044	kind of as bass lines.
449.387	Now, this is based on the work
449.387	of Jason Moran and others
452.037	who work intimately
452.037	with music and language,
455.099	but it's also something I've had
455.099	in my head since I was a kid,
458.067	how musical my parents sounded
460.122	when they were speaking
460.122	to each other and to us.
464.07	It was from them
464.07	and from Amhariña that I learned
466.468	that we are awash in musical expression
469.372	with every word,
469.372	every sentence that we speak,
472.011	every word, every sentence
472.011	that we receive.
474.787	Perhaps you can hear it
474.787	in the words I'm speaking even now.
480.237	Finally, we go to the 1950s United States
482.676	and the most seminal work
482.676	of 20th century avant-garde composition:
486.611	"John Cage's ""4:33,"""
488.759	written for any instrument
488.759	or combination of instruments.
492.912	The musician or musicians are invited
492.912	to walk onto the stage
496.495	with a stopwatch and open the score,
499.709	which was actually purchased
499.709	by the Museum of Modern Art --
502.664	the score, that is.
504.641	And this score has not
504.641	a single note written
508.173	and there is not a single note played
510.671	for four minutes and 33 seconds.
514.54	And, at once enraging and enrapturing,
519.254	Cage shows us that even
519.254	when there are no strings
522.166	being plucked by fingers
522.166	or hands hammering piano keys,
527.238	still there is music,
527.238	still there is music,
529.739	still there is music.
531.825	And what is this music?
534.903	It was that sneeze in the back.
537.132	(Laughter)
538.702	It is the everyday soundscape
538.702	that arises from the audience themselves:
543.787	their coughs, their sighs, their rustles,
543.787	their whispers, their sneezes,
548.08	the room, the wood
548.08	of the floors and the walls
550.645	expanding and contracting,
550.645	creaking and groaning
553.127	with the heat and the cold,
554.555	the pipes clanking and contributing.
559.306	And controversial though it was,
559.306	and even controversial though it remains,
562.97	Cage's point is that there is no
562.97	such thing as true silence.
568.107	Even in the most silent environments,
568.107	we still hear and feel the sound
572.636	of our own heartbeats.
574.646	The world is alive
574.646	with musical expression.
578.383	We are already immersed.
582.33	Now, I had my own moment of,
582.33	let's say, remixing John Cage
586.047	a couple of months ago
587.738	when I was standing
587.738	in front of the stove cooking lentils.
590.765	And it was late one night
590.765	and it was time to stir,
593.931	so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot,
595.927	and I placed it onto
595.927	the kitchen counter next to me,
598.384	and it started to roll back and forth
600.671	making this sound.
604.765	(Sound of metal lid
604.765	clanking against a counter)
610.929	(Clanking ends)
613.525	And it stopped me cold.
615.727	"I thought, ""What a weird, cool swing"
615.727	"that cooking pan lid has."""
622.2	So when the lentils were ready and eaten,
626.808	I hightailed it to my backyard studio,
630.326	and I made this.
633.187	(Music, including the sound
633.187	of the lid, and singing)
650.271	(Music ends)
652.479	Now, John Cage
652.479	wasn't instructing musicians
654.915	to mine the soundscape
654.915	for sonic textures to turn into music.
659.06	He was saying that on its own,
661.937	the environment is musically generative,
665.422	that it is generous, that it is fertile,
669.687	that we are already immersed.
672.765	Musician, music researcher, surgeon
672.765	and human hearing expert Charles Limb
678.802	is a professor at Johns Hopkins University
680.881	and he studies music and the brain.
684.739	And he has a theory
687.735	that it is possible -- it is possible --
690.855	that the human auditory system
690.855	actually evolved to hear music,
696.027	because it is so much more complex
696.027	than it needs to be for language alone.
701.733	And if that's true,
703.532	it means that we're hard-wired for music,
706.501	that we can find it anywhere,
708.638	that there is no such thing
708.638	as a musical desert,
711.74	that we are permanently
711.74	hanging out at the oasis,
715.463	and that is marvelous.
718.135	We can add to the soundtrack,
718.135	but it's already playing.
722.26	And it doesn't mean don't study music.
724.138	Study music, trace your sonic lineages
724.138	and enjoy that exploration.
729.355	But there is a kind of sonic lineage
729.355	to which we all belong.
734.267	So the next time you are seeking
734.267	percussion inspiration,
736.914	look no further than your tires,
736.914	as they roll over the unusual grooves
740.287	of the freeway,
742.035	or the top-right burner of your stove
744.237	and that strange way that it clicks
745.97	as it is preparing to light.
748.733	When seeking melodic inspiration,
750.369	look no further than dawn
750.369	and dusk avian orchestras
753.885	or to the natural lilt
753.885	of emphatic language.
757.137	We are the audience
757.137	and we are the composers
760.16	and we take from these pieces
761.979	we are given.
763.154	We make, we make, we make, we make,
765.046	knowing that when it comes to nature
765.046	or language or soundscape,
769.49	there is no end to the inspiration --
772.511	if we are listening.
775.421	Thank you.
776.597	(Applause)
