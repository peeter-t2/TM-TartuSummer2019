12.942	Last year ...
14.657	was hell.
15.884	(Laughter)
20.391	It was my first time eating
20.391	"Nigerian ""jollof."""
23.967	(Laughter)
26.436	Actually, in all seriousness,
29.319	I was going through a lot
29.319	of personal turmoil.
33.055	Faced with enormous stress,
35.26	I suffered an anxiety attack.
38.362	On some days, I could do no work.
42.156	On other days,
44.076	I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.
48.478	My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
48.478	with a mental health professional
53.751	about my stress and anxiety.
56.589	Mental health?
58.792	I clammed up and violently
58.792	shook my head in protest.
65.065	I felt a profound sense of a shame.
70.233	I felt the weight of stigma.
74.959	I have a loving, supportive family
77.342	and incredibly loyal friends,
79.673	yet I could not entertain
79.673	the idea of speaking to anyone
84.266	about my feeling of pain.
87.824	I felt suffocated
87.824	by the rigid architecture
92.315	of our African masculinity.
95.585	"""People have real problems, Sangu."
97.724	"Get over yourself!"""
100.776	"The first time I heard ""mental health,"""
103.7	I was a boarding school student
103.7	fresh off the boat from Ghana,
107.687	at the Peddie School in New Jersey.
110.887	I had just gone through
110.887	the brutal experience
114.317	of losing seven loved ones
114.317	in the same month.
118.389	The school nurse,
119.869	concerned about what I'd gone
119.869	through -- God bless her soul --
123.957	she inquired about my mental health.
127.246	"""Is she mental?"" I thought."
130.034	Does she not know I'm an African man?
132.502	(Laughter)
133.54	"Like Okonkwo in ""Things Fall Apart,"""
135.435	we African men neither process
135.435	nor express our emotions.
140.791	We deal with our problems.
142.506	(Applause)
145.001	We deal with our problems.
147.024	I called my brother and laughed
147.024	"about ""Oyibo"" people -- white people --"
151.819	and their strange diseases --
153.7	"depression, ADD and those ""weird things."""
158.32	Growing up in West Africa,
160.335	"when people used the term ""mental,"""
160.335	what came to mind was a madman
164.74	with dirty, dread-locked hair,
167.007	bumbling around half-naked on the streets.
170.904	We all know this man.
172.748	Our parents warned us about him.
175.64	"""Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?"""
177.209	"""Drugs!"
178.445	If you even look at drugs,
178.445	"you end up like him."""
180.858	(Laughter)
182.8	Come down with pneumonia,
184.889	and your mother will rush you
184.889	to the nearest hospital
187.445	for medical treatment.
189.91	But dare to declare depression,
193.278	and your local pastor
193.278	will be driving out demons
196.704	and blaming witches in your village.
199.118	According to the World
199.118	Health Organization,
202.042	mental health is about being able to cope
205.124	with the normal stressors of life;
207.741	to work productively and fruitfully;
211.208	and to be able to make
211.208	a contribution to your community.
215.321	Mental health includes our emotional,
215.321	psychological and social well-being.
222.676	Globally, 75 percent
222.676	of all mental illness cases
227.46	can be found in low-income countries.
230.118	Yet most African governments
231.974	invest less than one percent
231.974	of their health care budget
236.205	in mental health.
238.501	Even worse,
239.705	we have a severe shortage
239.705	of psychiatrists in Africa.
244.656	Nigeria, for example,
244.656	is estimated to have 200 --
249.632	in a country of almost 200 million.
254.242	In all of Africa,
	lack access to treatment.
260.501	As a result,
262.278	we suffer in solitude,
265.306	silenced by stigma.
269.318	We as Africans often respond
269.318	to mental health with distance,
274.664	ignorance,
276.355	guilt,
277.954	fear
279.754	and anger.
282.129	In a study conducted by Arboleda-Fl√≥rez,
286.83	"directly asking, ""What is the cause"
286.83	"of mental illness?"""
	cited drug misuse;
	and the will of God --
303.368	(Laughter)
307.95	witchcraft and spiritual possession.
311.616	But few cited other known
311.616	causes of mental illness,
316.2	like genetics,
317.87	socioeconomic status,
319.83	war,
321.449	conflict
322.886	or the loss of a loved one.
325.829	The stigmatization against mental illness
328.74	often results in the ostracizing
328.74	and demonizing of sufferers.
334.255	Photojournalist Robin Hammond
334.255	has documented some of these abuses ...
338.275	in Uganda,
340.665	in Somalia,
343.089	and here in Nigeria.
347.374	For me,
349.877	the stigma is personal.
353.942	In 2009,
356.616	I received a frantic call
356.616	in the middle of the night.
361.179	My best friend in the world --
363.551	a brilliant, philosophical,
363.551	charming, hip young man --
368.714	was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
372.424	I witnessed some of the friends
372.424	we'd grown up with recoil.
379.136	I heard the snickers.
381.448	I heard the whispers.
384.006	"""Did you hear he has gone mad?"""
387.095	"(Kru English) ""He has gone crazy!"""
389.669	Derogatory, demeaning commentary
389.669	about his condition --
394.013	words we would never say
394.013	about someone with cancer
398.014	or someone with malaria.
400.484	Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,
404.187	our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.
408.539	I stood by his side
408.539	as his community isolated him,
413.98	but our love never wavered.
417.668	Tacitly, I became passionate
417.668	about mental health.
421.694	Inspired by his plight,
424.35	I helped found the mental health
424.35	special interest alumni group
427.697	at my college.
429.376	And during my tenure as a resident
429.376	tutor in graduate school,
432.777	I supported many undergraduates
432.777	with their mental health challenges.
437.271	I saw African students struggle
439.81	and unable to speak to anyone.
442.566	Even with this knowledge
442.566	and with their stories in tow,
446.586	I, in turn, struggled,
448.596	and could not speak to anyone
448.596	when I faced my own anxiety,
453.193	so deep is our fear of being the madman.
459.735	All of us --
461.698	but we Africans especially --
464.775	need to realize that our mental struggles
464.775	do not detract from our virility,
470.706	nor does our trauma taint our strength.
474.756	We need to see mental health
474.756	as important as physical health.
480.403	We need to stop suffering in silence.
485.939	We must stop stigmatizing disease
489.421	and traumatizing the afflicted.
493.399	Talk to your friends.
495.834	Talk to your loved ones.
498.394	Talk to health professionals.
501.437	Be vulnerable.
503.615	Do so with the confidence
506.335	that you are not alone.
510.011	Speak up if you're struggling.
514.414	Being honest about how we feel
517.965	does not make us weak;
520.629	it makes us human.
523.499	It is time to end the stigma
523.499	associated with mental illness.
528.93	"So the next time your hear ""mental,"""
533.228	do not just think of the madman.
536.163	Think of me.
537.796	(Applause)
539.744	Thank you.
541.051	(Applause)
