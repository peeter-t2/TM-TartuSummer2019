12.816	We all go to doctors.
16.944	And we do so with trust and blind faith
21.306	that the test they are ordering
21.306	and the medications they're prescribing
25.188	are based upon evidence --
28.387	evidence that's designed to help us.
32.338	However, the reality is that that hasn't
32.338	always been the case for everyone.
39.086	What if I told you
40.405	that the medical science discovered
40.405	over the past century
44.375	has been based on only
44.375	half the population?
48.066	I'm an emergency medicine doctor.
50.749	I was trained to be prepared
50.749	in a medical emergency.
54.94	It's about saving lives. How cool is that?
60.492	OK, there's a lot of runny noses
60.492	and stubbed toes,
63.676	but no matter who walks
63.676	through the door to the ER,
67.365	we order the same tests,
69.841	we prescribe the same medication,
71.999	without ever thinking about the sex
71.999	or gender of our patients.
77.37	Why would we?
79.053	We were never taught that there were
79.053	any differences between men and women.
82.818	A recent Government Accountability study
82.818	revealed that 80 percent of the drugs
87.401	withdrawn from the market
89.576	are due to side effects on women.
93.08	So let's think about that for a minute.
95.415	Why are we discovering
95.415	side effects on women
99.313	only after a drug has been
99.313	released to the market?
103.496	Do you know that it takes years
103.496	for a drug to go from an idea
109.18	to being tested on cells in a laboratory,
112.361	to animal studies,
114.353	to then clinical trials on humans,
116.504	finally to go through
116.504	a regulatory approval process,
120.399	to be available for your doctor
120.399	to prescribe to you?
126.17	Not to mention the millions and billions
126.17	of dollars of funding
129.564	it takes to go through that process.
133.597	So why are we discovering
133.597	unacceptable side effects
136.573	on half the population
136.573	after that has gone through?
143.163	What's happening?
144.777	Well, it turns out that those cells
144.777	used in that laboratory,
148.905	they're male cells,
150.859	and the animals used
150.859	in the animal studies were male animals,
154.285	and the clinical trials have been
154.285	performed almost exclusively on men.
161.176	How is it that the male model became
161.176	our framework for medical research?
166.554	Let's look at an example that has been
166.554	popularized in the media,
170.649	and it has to do
170.649	with the sleep aid Ambien.
173.879	Ambien was released on the market
173.879	over 20 years ago,
178.667	and since then, hundreds of millions
178.667	of prescriptions have been written,
183.504	primarily to women, because women
183.504	suffer more sleep disorders than men.
189.047	But just this past year,
191.247	the Food and Drug Administration
191.247	recommended cutting the dose in half
194.695	for women only,
197.606	because they just realized
197.606	that women metabolize the drug
200.467	at a slower rate than men,
203.404	causing them to wake up in the morning
205.467	with more of the active drug
205.467	in their system.
208.685	And then they're drowsy and they're
208.685	getting behind the wheel of the car,
212.639	and they're at risk
212.639	for motor vehicle accidents.
216.955	And I can't help but think,
216.955	as an emergency physician,
220.923	how many of my patients
220.923	that I've cared for over the years
225.74	were involved in a motor vehicle accident
228.57	that possibly could have been prevented
232.046	if this type of analysis was performed
232.046	and acted upon 20 years ago
237.185	when this drug was first released.
241.089	How many other things need
241.089	to be analyzed by gender?
245.197	What else are we missing?
249.555	World War II changed a lot of things,
253.255	and one of them was this need
253.255	to protect people
256.16	from becoming victims of medical research
256.16	without informed consent.
261.467	So some much-needed guidelines
261.467	or rules were set into place,
265.167	and part of that was this desire
265.167	to protect women of childbearing age
270.213	from entering into any
270.213	medical research studies.
274.016	There was fear: what if something
274.016	happened to the fetus during the study?
279.366	Who would be responsible?
281.999	And so the scientists
281.999	at this time actually thought
284.512	this was a blessing in disguise,
287.152	because let's face it -- men's bodies
287.152	are pretty homogeneous.
292.867	They don't have the constantly
292.867	fluctuating levels of hormones
296.337	that could disrupt clean data
296.337	they could get if they had only men.
301.21	It was easier. It was cheaper.
305.651	Not to mention, at this time,
305.651	there was a general assumption
308.508	that men and women
308.508	were alike in every way,
312.757	apart from their reproductive organs
312.757	and sex hormones.
317.211	So it was decided:
321.117	medical research was performed on men,
324.657	and the results were later
324.657	applied to women.
329.203	What did this do to the notion
329.203	of women's health?
332.768	Women's health became synonymous
332.768	with reproduction:
337.048	breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
342.355	It's this term we now refer
342.355	"to as ""bikini medicine."""
346.461	And this stayed this way
346.461	until about the 1980s,
349.129	when this concept was challenged
349.129	by the medical community
352.638	and by the public health policymakers
352.638	when they realized that
356.803	by excluding women
356.803	from all medical research studies
361.13	we actually did them a disservice,
364.643	in that apart from reproductive issues,
366.999	virtually nothing was known
366.999	about the unique needs
369.587	of the female patient.
372.999	Since that time, an overwhelming amount
372.999	of evidence has come to light
378.537	that shows us just how different
378.537	men and women are in every way.
389.297	You know, we have this saying in medicine:
392.074	children are not just little adults.
396.81	And we say that to remind ourselves
398.771	that children actually have
398.771	a different physiology than normal adults.
404.678	And it's because of this that the medical
404.678	specialty of pediatrics came to light.
409.659	And we now conduct research on children
409.659	in order to improve their lives.
417.039	And I know the same thing
417.039	can be said about women.
419.96	Women are not just men
419.96	with boobs and tubes.
426.561	But they have their own
426.561	anatomy and physiology
430.141	that deserves to be studied
430.141	with the same intensity.
435.381	Let's take the cardiovascular
435.381	system, for example.
438.999	This area in medicine has done the most
438.999	to try to figure out
442.73	why it seems men and women have
442.73	completely different heart attacks.
447.999	Heart disease is the number one killer
447.999	for both men and women,
453.113	but more women die within the first year
453.113	of having a heart attack than men.
459.049	Men will complain
459.049	of crushing chest pain --
463.087	an elephant is sitting on their chest.
466.455	And we call this typical.
469.622	Women have chest pain, too.
472.736	But more women than men
472.736	"will complain of ""just not feeling right,"""
480.898	"""can't seem to get enough air in,"""
483.791	"""just so tired lately."""
487	And for some reason we call this atypical,
489.927	even though, as I mentioned,
489.927	women do make up half the population.
495.537	And so what is some of the evidence
495.537	to help explain some of these differences?
501.999	If we look at the anatomy,
504.554	the blood vessels that surround the heart
504.554	are smaller in women compared to men,
510.593	and the way that those blood vessels
510.593	develop disease is different
515.097	in women compared to men.
517.875	And the test that we use to determine
517.875	if someone is at risk for a heart attack,
523.051	well, they were initially designed
523.051	and tested and perfected in men,
527.647	and so aren't as good
527.647	at determining that in women.
532.305	And then if we think
532.305	about the medications --
535.266	common medications
535.266	that we use, like aspirin.
539.767	We give aspirin to healthy men to help
539.767	prevent them from having a heart attack,
544.318	but do you know that if you
544.318	give aspirin to a healthy woman,
548.576	it's actually harmful?
552.376	What this is doing is merely telling us
554.782	that we are scratching the surface.
559.145	Emergency medicine
559.145	is a fast-paced business.
563.563	In how many life-saving areas of medicine,
566.94	like cancer and stroke,
570.94	are there important differences between
570.94	men and women that we could be utilizing?
576.252	Or even, why is it that some people
576.252	get those runny noses
581.08	more than others,
583.289	or why the pain medication that we give
583.289	to those stubbed toes
586.64	work in some and not in others?
593.288	The Institute of Medicine has said
593.288	every cell has a sex.
599.82	What does this mean?
602.532	Sex is DNA.
604.954	Gender is how someone
604.954	presents themselves in society.
609.883	And these two may not always match up,
612.447	as we can see with our
612.447	transgendered population.
616.74	But it's important to realize
616.74	that from the moment of conception,
621.679	every cell in our bodies --
623.825	skin, hair, heart and lungs --
627.15	contains our own unique DNA,
630.461	and that DNA contains
630.461	the chromosomes that determine
634.236	whether we become
634.236	male or female, man or woman.
640.4	It used to be thought
642.012	that those sex-determining
642.012	chromosomes pictured here --
646.364	XY if you're male, XX if you're female --
649.761	merely determined whether you
649.761	would be born with ovaries or testes,
654.999	and it was the sex hormones
654.999	that those organs produced
658.764	that were responsible for the differences
658.764	we see in the opposite sex.
664.757	But we now know that
664.757	that theory was wrong --
669.615	or it's at least a little incomplete.
672.084	And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page
672.084	from the Whitehead Institute,
676.886	who works on the Y chromosome,
678.884	and Doctor Yang from UCLA,
681.075	they have found evidence that tells us
681.075	that those sex-determining chromosomes
686.758	that are in every cell in our bodies
689.379	continue to remain active
689.379	for our entire lives
696.517	and could be what's responsible
696.517	for the differences we see
700.116	in the dosing of drugs,
702.355	or why there are differences
702.355	between men and women
705.345	in the susceptibility
705.345	and severity of diseases.
711.032	This new knowledge is the game-changer,
717.425	and it's up to those scientists
717.425	that continue to find that evidence,
720.823	but it's up to the clinicians
720.823	to start translating this data
725	at the bedside, today.
729.168	Right now.
733.45	And to help do this, I'm a co-founder
733.45	of a national organization
736.498	called Sex and Gender
736.498	Women's Health Collaborative,
739.505	and we collect all of this data
739.505	so that it's available for teaching
744.149	and for patient care.
746.38	And we're working to bring together
746.38	the medical educators to the table.
751.756	That's a big job.
754.162	It's changing the way medical training
754.162	has been done since its inception.
761.039	But I believe in them.
763.882	I know they're going to see the value
763.882	of incorporating the gender lens
769.503	into the current curriculum.
772.598	It's about training the future
772.598	health care providers correctly.
780.437	And regionally,
781.612	I'm a co-creator of a division within
781.612	the Department of Emergency Medicine
785.497	here at Brown University,
787.241	called Sex and Gender
787.241	in Emergency Medicine,
789.875	and we conduct the research to determine
789.875	the differences between men and women
794.525	in emergent conditions,
796.707	like heart disease and stroke
796.707	and sepsis and substance abuse,
801.999	but we also believe
801.999	that education is paramount.
807.304	We've created a 360-degree
807.304	model of education.
811.329	We have programs for the doctors,
811.329	for the nurses, for the students
817.311	and for the patients.
819.511	Because this cannot just be left up
819.511	to the health care leaders.
824.315	We all have a role in making a difference.
828.65	But I must warn you: this is not easy.
833.84	In fact, it's hard.
837.146	It's essentially changing the way
837.146	we think about medicine
841.562	and health and research.
845.711	It's changing our relationship
845.711	to the health care system.
849.76	But there's no going back.
853.339	We now know just enough
857.062	to know that we weren't doing it right.
861.672	Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,
864.014	"""Change does not roll in"
864.014	on the wheels of inevitability,
868.687	"but comes through continuous struggle."""
872.314	And the first step
872.314	towards change is awareness.
876.116	This is not just about improving
876.116	medical care for women.
880.702	This is about personalized,
880.702	individualized health care for everyone.
887.09	This awareness has the power to transform
887.09	medical care for men and women.
894.827	And from now on, I want you
894.827	to ask your doctors
900.539	whether the treatments you are receiving
900.539	are specific to your sex and gender.
906.246	They may not know the answer --
908.959	yet.
911.101	But the conversation has begun,
911.101	and together we can all learn.
915.797	Remember, for me
915.797	and my colleagues in this field,
920.198	your sex and gender matter.
923.379	Thank you.
924.555	(Applause)
