12.84	I do want to test this question
12.84	we're all interested in:
15.8	Does extinction have to be forever?
18.84	I'm focused on two projects
18.84	I want to tell you about.
21.56	One is the Thylacine Project.
23.4	The other one is the Lazarus Project,
25.186	and that's focused
25.186	on the gastric-brooding frog.
27.92	And it would be a fair question to ask,
29.84	why have we focused on these two animals?
32.12	Well, point number one, each of them
32.12	represents a unique family of its own.
37.52	We've lost a whole family.
39.12	That's a big chunk
39.12	of the global genome gone.
41.76	I'd like it back.
43.36	The second reason
43.36	is that we killed these things.
47.72	In the case of the thylacine, regrettably,
47.72	we shot every one that we saw.
52.68	We slaughtered them.
54.6	In the case of the gastric-brooding frog,
54.6	"we may have ""fungicided"" it to death."
59.72	There's a dreadful fungus
59.72	that's moving through the world
62.44	that's called the chytrid fungus,
64.08	and it's nailing frogs all over the world.
66.32	We think that's probably
66.32	what got this frog,
68.392	and humans are spreading this fungus.
70.8	And this introduces
70.8	a very important ethical point,
73.68	and I think you will have heard
73.68	this many times
75.92	when this topic comes up.
77.56	What I think is important
79.32	is that, if it's clear
79.32	that we exterminated these species,
82.92	then I think we not only
82.92	have a moral obligation
86.36	to see what we can do about it,
87.861	but I think we've got a moral imperative
87.861	to try to do something, if we can.
92.72	OK. Let me talk to you
92.72	about the Lazarus Project.
95.6	It's a frog. And you think, frog.
98.48	Yeah, but this was not just any frog.
101.88	Unlike a normal frog,
101.88	which lays its eggs in the water
104.68	and goes away
104.68	and wishes its froglets well,
107.36	this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,
111	swallowed them into the stomach,
111	where it should be having food,
114.68	didn't digest the eggs,
114.68	and turned its stomach into a uterus.
119.2	In the stomach, the eggs
119.2	went on to develop into tadpoles,
122.56	and in the stomach, the tadpoles
122.56	went on to develop into frogs,
126.44	and they grew in the stomach
128.12	until eventually the poor old frog
128.12	was at risk of bursting apart.
132.16	It has a little cough and a hiccup,
132.16	and out comes sprays of little frogs.
136.24	Now, when biologists saw this,
136.24	they were agog.
139	They thought, this is incredible.
140.96	No animal, let alone a frog,
140.96	has been known to do this,
144.8	to change one organ
144.8	in the body into another.
146.96	And you can imagine the medical world
146.96	went nuts over this as well.
150.8	If we could understand
152.04	how that frog is managing
152.04	the way its tummy works,
155.36	is there information here
155.36	that we need to understand
157.84	or could usefully use to help ourselves?
161.2	Now, I'm not suggesting we want
161.2	to raise our babies in our stomach,
164.56	but I am suggesting it's possible
166.2	we might want to manage
166.2	gastric secretion in the gut.
168.88	And just as everybody
168.88	got excited about it, bang!
171.72	It was extinct.
174.12	I called up my friend,
175.6	Professor Mike Tyler
175.6	in the University of Adelaide.
178.005	He was the last person who had this frog,
178.005	a colony of these things, in his lab.
182.4	"And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --"""
182.4	This was 30 or 40 years ago.
185.472	"""By any chance had you kept"
185.472	"any frozen tissue of this frog?"""
189.24	And he thought about it,
190.48	and he went to his deep freezer,
190.48	minus 20 degrees centigrade,
194.32	and he poured through
194.32	everything in the freezer,
196.6	and there in the bottom was a jar
196.6	and it contained tissues of these frogs.
200.92	This was very exciting,
202.2	but there was no reason
202.2	why we should expect that this would work,
205.56	because this tissue
205.56	had not had any antifreeze put in it,
209.52	cryoprotectants, to look after it
209.52	when it was frozen.
213.2	And normally, when water freezes,
213.2	as you know, it expands,
215.96	and the same thing happens in a cell.
217.8	If you freeze tissues, the water expands,
217.8	damages or bursts the cell walls.
222.2	Well, we looked at the tissue
222.2	under the microscope.
224.64	It actually didn't look bad.
224.64	The cell walls looked intact.
227.4	So we thought, let's give it a go.
229.48	What we did is something called
229.48	somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
233.76	We took the eggs
233.76	of a related species, a living frog,
237.4	and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.
240.28	We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
242.72	And then we took the dead nucleus
242.72	from the dead tissue of the extinct frog
247.48	and we inserted those nuclei
247.48	into that egg.
250.6	Now, by rights, this is
250.6	kind of like a cloning project,
254.08	like what produced Dolly,
255.32	but it's actually very different,
256.96	because Dolly was live sheep
256.96	into live sheep cells.
259.72	That was a miracle, but it was workable.
262.08	What we're trying to do is take
262.08	a dead nucleus from an extinct species
265.76	and put it into a completely different
265.76	species and expect that to work.
269.16	Well, we had no real reason
269.16	to expect it would,
271.48	and we tried hundreds
271.48	and hundreds of these.
274.8	And just last February,
274.8	the last time we did these trials,
277.6	I saw a miracle starting to happen.
281.04	What we found was
281.04	most of these eggs didn't work,
284.36	but then suddenly,
284.36	one of them began to divide.
287.36	That was so exciting.
288.76	And then the egg divided again.
288.76	And then again.
291.68	And pretty soon,
291.68	we had early-stage embryos
294.72	with hundreds of cells forming those.
297.52	We even DNA-tested some of these cells,
300.32	and the DNA of the extinct frog
300.32	is in those cells.
304.16	So we're very excited.
304.16	This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.
307.68	But it's a long way along the journey
310.44	to producing, or bringing back,
310.44	an extinct species.
313.28	And this is news.
314.52	We haven't announced this publicly before.
317	We're excited.
318.24	We've got to get past this point.
319.88	We now want this ball of cells
319.88	to start to gastrulate,
322.428	to turn in so that it will produce
322.428	the other tissues.
325.08	It'll go on and produce
325.08	a tadpole and then a frog.
328.8	Watch this space.
330.04	I think we're going to have
330.04	this frog hopping
332.257	glad to be back in the world again.
334.72	(Applause)
336.56	Thank you.
337.79	(Applause)
339.92	We haven't done it yet,
339.92	but keep the applause ready.
343.08	The second project I want to talk
343.08	to you about is the Thylacine Project.
347.08	The thylacine looks a bit,
347.08	to most people, like a dog,
350.96	or maybe like a tiger,
350.96	because it has stripes.
353.127	But it's not related to any of those.
353.127	It's a marsupial.
355.96	It raised its young in a pouch,
355.96	like a koala or a kangaroo would do,
360.16	and it has a long history,
360.16	a long, fascinating history,
365.2	that goes back 25 million years.
368.12	But it's also a tragic history.
370.2	The first one that we see occurs
370.2	in the ancient rain forests of Australia
375.16	about 25 million years ago,
377.16	and the National Geographic Society
379.52	is helping us to explore
379.52	these fossil deposits.
381.775	This is Riversleigh.
383.32	In those fossil rocks
383.32	are some amazing animals.
386.4	We found marsupial lions.
388.32	We found carnivorous kangaroos.
390.92	It's not what you usually
390.92	think about as a kangaroo,
393.4	but these are meat-eating kangaroos.
395.16	We found the biggest bird in the world,
397.08	bigger than that thing
397.08	that was in Madagascar,
399.247	and it too was a flesh eater.
400.76	It was a giant, weird duck.
403.04	And crocodiles were not behaving
403.04	at that time either.
405.96	You think of crocodiles
405.96	as doing their ugly thing,
408.36	sitting in a pool of water.
409.8	These crocodiles
409.8	were actually out on the land
412.36	and they were even climbing trees
412.36	and jumping on prey on the ground.
417.6	We had, in Australia, drop crocs.
417.6	They really do exist.
421.775	(Laughter)
422.898	But what they were dropping on
422.898	was not only other weird animals
425.94	but also thylacines.
427.24	There were five different kinds
427.24	of thylacines in those ancient forests,
431.2	and they ranged from great big ones
431.2	to middle-sized ones
435.68	to one that was
435.68	about the size of a chihuahua.
439.44	Paris Hilton would have been able
441.08	to carry one of these things around
441.08	in a little handbag,
443.76	until a drop croc landed on her.
445.56	At any rate, it was a fascinating place,
447.52	but unfortunately,
447.52	Australia didn't stay this way.
450.32	Climate change has affected the world
450.32	for a long period of time,
453.84	and gradually, the forests disappeared,
453.84	the country began to dry out,
458.28	and the number of kinds
458.28	of thylacines began to decline,
460.92	until by five million years ago,
462.52	only one left.
463.72	By 10,000 years ago,
463.72	they had disappeared from New Guinea,
467.28	and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago,
467.28	somebodies, we don't know who this was,
474.16	introduced dingoes --
474.16	this is a very archaic kind of a dog&nbsp;--
477.92	into Australia.
479.16	And as you can see,
480.4	dingoes are very similar
480.4	in their body form to thylacines.
483.24	That similarity meant
483.24	they probably competed.
486.2	They were eating the same kinds of foods.
488.2	It's even possible that aborigines were
488.2	keeping some of these dingoes as pets,
492.84	and therefore they may have had
492.84	an advantage in the battle for survival.
496.3	All we know is, soon after
496.3	the dingoes were brought in,
498.94	thylacines were extinct
498.94	in the Australian mainland,
501.38	and after that they only
501.38	survived in Tasmania.
505.48	Then, unfortunately,
506.72	the next sad part of the thylacine story
506.72	is that Europeans arrived in 1788,
511.28	and they brought with them
511.28	the things they valued,
514.08	and that included sheep.
516.36	They took one look
516.36	at the thylacine in Tasmania,
518.92	and they thought, hang on,
518.92	this is not going to work.
522.04	That guy is going to eat all our sheep.
524.938	That was not what happened, actually.
527.2	Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep,
527.2	but the thylacine got a bad rap.
530.799	But immediately, the government said,
530.799	that's it, let's get rid of them,
534.799	and they paid people
534.799	to slaughter every one that they saw.
538.6	By the early 1930s,
540.92	3,000 to 4,000 thylacines
540.92	had been murdered.
544.76	It was a disaster,
544.76	and they were about to hit the wall.
549.08	Have a look at this bit of film footage.
551.56	It makes me very sad because,
551.56	while it's a fascinating animal,
555.32	and it's amazing to think
555.32	that we had the technology to film it
560.4	before it actually plunged off
560.4	that cliff of extinction,
564.48	we didn't, unfortunately,
564.48	at this same time,
567.12	have a molecule of concern
567.12	about the welfare for this species.
571.2	These are photos of the last
571.2	surviving thylacine, Benjamin,
574.6	who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.
577.68	To add insult to injury,
579.32	having swept this species
579.32	nearly off the table,
583.04	this animal, when it died of neglect --
585.56	The keepers didn't let it
585.56	into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
590.08	It died of exposure, and in the morning,
590.08	when they found the body of Benjamin,
593.96	they still cared so little for this animal
593.96	that they threw the body in the dump.
600.6	Does it have to stay this way?
603.72	In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.
606.12	I was fascinated by thylacines.
607.88	I've always been obsessed
607.88	with these animals.
610	And I was studying skulls,
611.28	trying to figure out their relationships
611.28	to other sorts of animals,
614.56	and I saw this jar,
616.56	and here, in the jar,
616.56	was a little girl thylacine pup,
621.12	perhaps six months old.
622.84	The guy who had found it
622.84	and killed the mother
625.2	had pickled the pup,
625.2	and they pickled it in alcohol.
628.36	I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew
628.36	alcohol was a DNA preservative.
632	But this was 1990,
632	and I asked my geneticist friends,
636.36	couldn't we think
636.36	about going into this pup
638.8	and extracting DNA, if it's there,
641.8	and then somewhere
641.8	down the line in the future,
644.04	we'll use this DNA
644.04	to bring the thylacine back?
646.28	The geneticists laughed.
646.28	But this was six years before Dolly.
650.791	Cloning was science fiction.
652.562	It had not happened.
653.82	But then suddenly cloning did happen.
656.24	And I thought, when I became
656.24	director of the Australian Museum,
659.4	I'm going to give this a go.
660.76	I put a team together.
662.24	We went into that pup
662.24	to see what was in it,
665.12	and we did find thylacine DNA.
667.32	It was a eureka moment.
667.32	We were very excited.
669.52	Unfortunately, we also found
669.52	a lot of human DNA.
673.24	Every old curator
673.24	who'd been in that museum
676.24	had seen this wonderful specimen,
678.12	put their hand in the jar,
678.12	pulled it out and thought,
680.64	"""Wow, look at that,"""
680.64	plop, dropped it back in the jar,
683.2	contaminating this specimen.
684.8	And that was a worry.
686.12	If the goal here was to get the DNA out
688.36	and use the DNA down the track
688.36	to try to bring a thylacine back,
692.32	what we didn't want happening
693.76	when the information
693.76	was shoved into the machine
696.04	and the wheel turned around
696.04	and the lights flashed,
698.48	was to have a wizened old horrible curator
698.48	pop out the other end of the machine.
702.48	It would've kept the curator very happy,
702.48	but it wasn't going to keep us happy.
706.2	So we went back to these specimens
706.2	and we started digging around,
709.28	and particularly,
709.28	we looked into the teeth of skulls,
712.44	hard parts where humans
712.44	had not been able to get their fingers,
715.52	and we found much better quality DNA.
718	We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.
720.2	It's there. So we got it.
721.72	OK. What could we do with this stuff?
724.2	Well, George Church,
724.2	"in his book, ""Regenesis,"""
726.42	has mentioned many of the techniques
726.42	that are rapidly advancing
729.48	to work with fragmented DNA.
731.52	We would hope that we'll be able
731.52	to get that DNA back into a viable form,
736.16	and then, much like we've done
736.16	with the Lazarus Project,
738.84	get that stuff into an egg
738.84	of a host species.
741.92	It has to be a different species.
741.92	What could it be?
744.36	Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?
746.16	They're related, distantly, to thylacines.
748.76	And then the Tasmanian devil is going
748.76	to pop a thylacine out the south end.
753.164	Critics of this project say, hang on.
756.2	Thylacine, Tasmanian devil?
756.2	That's going to hurt.
760.32	No, it's not. These are marsupials.
763.2	They give birth to babies
763.2	that are the size of a jelly bean.
766.08	That Tasmanian devil's
766.08	not even going to know it gave birth.
769.48	It is, shortly, going to think
770.96	it's got the ugliest
770.96	Tasmanian devil baby in the world,
774.08	so maybe it'll need some help
774.08	to keep it going.
778.44	Andrew Pask and his colleagues
778.44	have demonstrated
780.72	this might not be a waste of time.
782.6	And it's sort of in the future,
782.6	we haven't got there yet,
785.32	but it's the kind of thing
785.32	we want to think about.
787.72	They took some of this same
787.72	pickled thylacine DNA
790.28	and they spliced it into a mouse genome,
793.6	but they put a tag on it
795.12	so that anything
795.12	that this thylacine DNA produced
799.12	would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
802	In other words, if thylacine tissues
802	were being produced by the thylacine DNA,
806.16	it would be able to be recognized.
808.08	When the baby popped up,
808.08	it was filled with blue-green tissues.
812.12	And that tells us if we can get
812.12	that genome back together,
814.92	get it into a live cell,
816.4	it's going to produce thylacine stuff.
819.44	Is this a risk?
821	You've taken the bits of one animal
822.96	and you've mixed them into the cell
822.96	of a different kind of an animal.
826.231	Are we going to get a Frankenstein?
826.231	Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?
830.36	And the answer is no.
831.64	If the only nuclear DNA that goes
831.64	into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,
836.4	that's the only thing that can pop out
836.4	the other end of the devil.
840.52	OK, if we can do this,
840.52	could we put it back?
844.04	This is a key question for everybody.
845.84	Does it have to stay in a laboratory,
845.84	or could we put it back where it belongs?
849.6	Could we put it back in the throne
849.6	of the king of beasts in Tasmania,
853	restore that ecosystem?
854.52	Or has Tasmania changed so much
854.52	that that's no longer possible?
859	I've been to Tasmania.
860.8	I've been to many of the areas
860.8	where the thylacines were common.
863.84	I've even spoken to people,
863.84	like Peter Carter here,
866.72	who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,
869	but in 1926, this man
869	and his father and his brother
872.88	caught thylacines.
874.28	They trapped them.
875.64	And when I spoke to this man,
875.64	I was looking in his eyes and thinking,
879.96	"""Behind those eyes is a brain that has"
879.96	memories of what thylacines feel like,
886.16	what they smelled like,
886.16	"what they sounded like."""
888.64	He led them around on a rope.
890.2	He has personal experiences
892.28	that I would give my left leg
892.28	to have in my head.
896	We'd all love to have
896	this sort of thing happen.
898.32	Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,
900.6	could he take us back
900.6	to where he caught those thylacines.
903.36	My interest was in whether
903.36	the environment had changed.
906	He thought hard. It was nearly 80 years
906	before this that he'd been at this hut.
909.8	At any rate, he led us
909.8	down this bush track,
912.08	and there, right where he remembered,
914.08	was the hut,
915.36	and tears came into his eyes.
917.84	He looked at the hut. We went inside.
919.68	There were the wooden boards
919.68	on the sides of the hut
922.16	where he and his father
922.16	and his brother had slept at night.
924.96	And he told me, as it all
924.96	was flooding back in memories.
927.64	"He said, ""I remember"
927.64	the thylacines going around the hut
930.32	"wondering what was inside,"""
931.68	and he said they made sounds
931.68	"like ""Yip! Yip! Yip!"""
935.2	All of these are parts of his life
935.2	and what he remembers.
938.44	And the key question for me
938.44	was to ask Peter, has it changed?
941.88	And he said no.
943.12	The southern beech forests
943.12	surrounded his hut
945.28	just like it was
945.28	when he was there in 1926.
947.64	The grasslands were sweeping away.
949.64	That's classic thylacine habitat.
951.64	And the animals in those areas
951.64	were the same that were there
954.52	when the thylacine was around.
956	So could we put it back? Yes.
958.64	Is that all we would do?
958.64	And this is an interesting question.
962.28	Sometimes you might
962.28	be able to put it back,
964.56	but is that the safest way
964.56	to make sure it never goes extinct again?
967.8	And I don't think so.
969.36	I think gradually, as we see species
969.36	all around the world,
972.68	it's kind of a mantra that wildlife
972.68	is increasingly not safe in the wild.
976.48	We'd love to think it is,
976.48	but we know it isn't.
978.695	We need other parallel
978.695	strategies coming online.
981.12	And this one interests me.
982.64	Some of the thylacines
982.64	that were being turned in to zoos,
985.386	sanctuaries, even at the museums,
987.16	had collar marks on the neck.
989.52	They were being kept as pets,
991.44	and we know a lot
991.44	of bush tales and memories
994.44	of people who had them as pets,
996	and they say they were
996	wonderful, friendly.
998.2	This particular one
999.44	came in out of the forest to lick this boy
1002.44	and curled up around
1002.44	the fireplace to go to sleep.
1005.074	A wild animal.
1006.48	And I'd like to ask the question.
1006.48	We need to think about this.
1010.8	If it had not been illegal
1010.8	to keep these thylacines as pets then,
1016.28	would the thylacine be extinct now?
1018.48	And I'm positive it wouldn't.
1020.24	We need to think
1020.24	about this in today's world.
1023.24	Could it be that getting animals
1023.24	close to us so that we value them,
1027.8	maybe they won't go extinct?
1029.2	And this is such a critical issue for us
1031.76	because if we don't do that,
1033.12	we're going to watch more of these animals
1033.12	plunge off the precipice.
1037.28	As far as I'm concerned,
1038.52	this is why we're trying to do
1038.52	these kinds of de-extinction projects.
1042.68	We are trying to restore
1042.68	that balance of nature
1045.76	that we have upset.
1047.793	Thank you.
1049	(Applause)
