12.97	If I asked you to picture the air,
16.924	what do you imagine?
20.728	Most people think about either empty space
24.242	or clear blue sky
26.324	or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
29.669	And then I remember my high school
29.669	chemistry teacher with really long socks
33.374	at the blackboard,
34.585	drawing diagrams of bubbles
34.585	connected to other bubbles,
38.013	and describing how they vibrate
38.013	and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
44.029	But really, we tend not to think
44.029	about the air that much at all.
48.496	We notice it mostly
50.207	when there's some kind of unpleasant
50.207	sensory intrusion upon it,
54.329	like a terrible smell
54.329	or something visible like smoke or mist.
59.951	But it's always there.
63.027	It's touching all of us right now.
65.531	It's even inside us.
68.827	Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.
74.883	And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
79.829	So what is the air?
81.923	It's the combination of the invisible
81.923	gases that envelop the Earth,
85.687	attracted by the Earth's
85.687	gravitational pull.
89.09	And even though I'm a visual artist,
92.54	I'm interested in
92.54	the invisibility of the air.
96.447	I'm interested in how we imagine it,
99.046	how we experience it
101.118	and how we all have an innate
101.118	understanding of its materiality
104.956	through breathing.
108.35	All life on Earth changes the air
108.35	through gas exchange,
114.034	and we're all doing it right now.
116.499	Actually, why don't we all
116.499	right now together take
119.491	one big, collective, deep breath in.
122.276	Ready? In. (Inhales)
126.829	And out. (Exhales)
130.602	That air that you just exhaled,
133.296	you enriched a hundred times
133.296	in carbon dioxide.
138.178	So roughly five liters of air per breath,
144.339	of the 525,600 minutes per year,
149.94	comes to approximately
155.424	enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,
159.442	just for you.
161.642	Now, that's equivalent to about 18
161.642	Olympic-sized swimming pools.
168.023	For me, air is plural.
170.254	It's simultaneously
170.254	as small as our breathing
173.351	and as big as the planet.
176.509	And it's kind of hard to picture.
180.407	Maybe it's impossible,
180.407	and maybe it doesn't matter.
183.804	Through my visual arts practice,
186.437	I try to make air, not so much picture it,
190.154	but to make it visceral
190.154	and tactile and haptic.
194.997	I try to expand this notion
194.997	of the aesthetic, how things look,
199.828	so that it can include things
199.828	like how it feels on your skin
203.465	and in your lungs,
205.187	and how your voice sounds
205.187	as it passes through it.
209.847	I explore the weight, density and smell,
209.847	but most importantly,
214.359	I think a lot about the stories we attach
214.359	to different kinds of air.
221.911	This is a work I made in 2014.
226.692	"It's called ""Different Kinds"
226.692	"of Air: A Plant's Diary,"""
229.815	where I was recreating the air
229.815	from different eras in Earth's evolution,
233.747	and inviting the audience
233.747	to come in and breathe them with me.
236.771	And it's really surprising,
236.771	so drastically different.
241.665	Now, I'm not a scientist,
243.775	but atmospheric scientists
243.775	will look for traces
246.775	in the air chemistry in geology,
249.557	a bit like how rocks can oxidize,
251.898	and they'll extrapolate
251.898	that information and aggregate it,
255.271	such that they can
255.271	pretty much form a recipe
258.444	for the air at different times.
260.529	Then I come in as the artist
260.529	and take that recipe
263.188	and recreate it using the component gases.
267.836	I was particularly interested
267.836	in moments of time
271.59	that are examples
271.59	of life changing the air,
275.656	but also the air that can influence
275.656	how life will evolve,
280.786	like Carboniferous air.
283.399	It's from about 300 to 350
283.399	million years ago.
287.359	It's an era known
287.359	as the time of the giants.
291.141	So for the first time
291.141	in the history of life,
293.629	lignin evolves.
295.052	That's the hard stuff
295.052	that trees are made of.
297.4	So trees effectively invent
297.4	their own trunks at this time,
300.954	and they get really big,
300.954	bigger and bigger,
303.024	and pepper the Earth,
304.403	releasing oxygen, releasing
304.403	oxygen, releasing oxygen,
307.72	such that the oxygen levels
307.72	are about twice as high
311.358	as what they are today.
313.421	And this rich air supports
313.421	massive insects --
317.308	huge spiders and dragonflies
317.308	with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
324.189	To breathe, this air is really clean
324.189	and really fresh.
328.128	It doesn't so much have a flavor,
329.823	but it does give your body
329.823	a really subtle kind of boost of energy.
334.319	It's really good for hangovers.
336.21	(Laughter)
338.439	Or there's the air of the Great Dying --
341.137	that's about 252.5 million years ago,
344.785	just before the dinosaurs evolve.
346.851	It's a really short time period,
346.851	geologically speaking,
350.607	from about 20- to 200,000 years.
353.59	Really quick.
355.995	This is the greatest extinction event
355.995	in Earth's history,
358.711	even bigger than when
358.711	the dinosaurs died out.
362.035	Eighty-five to 95 percent of species
362.035	at this time die out,
366.016	and simultaneous to that is a huge,
366.016	dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,
371.217	that a lot of scientists agree
372.834	comes from a simultaneous
372.834	eruption of volcanoes
375.995	and a runaway greenhouse effect.
380.802	Oxygen levels at this time go
380.802	to below half of what they are today,
384.429	so about 10 percent.
385.748	So this air would definitely not
385.748	support human life,
388.653	but it's OK to just have a breath.
390.699	And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
393.759	It's really calming, it's quite warm
396.706	and it has a flavor a little bit
396.706	like soda water.
400.878	It has that kind of spritz,
400.878	quite pleasant.
404.745	So with all this thinking
404.745	about air of the past,
407.197	it's quite natural to start thinking
407.197	about the air of the future.
411.962	And instead of being speculative with air
414.78	and just making up what I think
414.78	might be the future air,
418.318	I discovered this human-synthesized air.
422.557	That means that it doesn't occur
422.557	anywhere in nature,
425.562	but it's made by humans in a laboratory
428.703	for application in different
428.703	industrial settings.
433.405	Why is it future air?
435.359	Well, this air is a really stable molecule
439.716	that will literally be part of the air
439.716	once it's released,
443.364	for the next 300 to 400 years,
443.364	before it's broken down.
448.094	So that's about 12 to 16 generations.
453.253	And this future air has
453.253	some very sensual qualities.
457.631	It's very heavy.
459.599	It's about eight times heavier
459.599	than the air we're used to breathing.
465.249	It's so heavy, in fact,
465.249	that when you breathe it in,
468.306	whatever words you speak
468.306	are kind of literally heavy as well,
471.727	so they dribble down your chin
471.727	and drop to the floor
474.957	and soak into the cracks.
477.043	It's an air that operates
477.043	quite a lot like a liquid.
481.867	Now, this air comes
481.867	with an ethical dimension as well.
486.046	Humans made this air,
487.843	but it's also the most potent
487.843	greenhouse gas
492.123	that has ever been tested.
494.862	Its warming potential is 24,000 times
494.862	that of carbon dioxide,
500.621	and it has that longevity
500.621	of 12 to 16 generations.
505.055	So this ethical confrontation
505.055	is really central to my work.
523.38	(In a lowered voice) It has
523.38	another quite surprising quality.
527.303	It changes the sound of your voice
527.303	quite dramatically.
530.74	(Laughter)
536.965	So when we start to think -- ooh!
536.965	It's still there a bit.
539.981	(Laughter)
541.439	When we think about climate change,
544.053	we probably don't think about
544.053	giant insects and erupting volcanoes
550.046	or funny voices.
553.027	The images that more readily come to mind
555.56	are things like retreating glaciers
555.56	and polar bears adrift on icebergs.
561.303	We think about pie charts
561.303	and column graphs
564.183	and endless politicians
564.183	talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
569.901	But perhaps it's time we start
569.901	thinking about climate change
574.118	on the same visceral level
574.118	that we experience the air.
579.558	Like air, climate change is simultaneously
579.558	at the scale of the molecule,
585.022	the breath and the planet.
588.959	It's immediate, vital and intimate,
592.462	as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.
598.271	And yet, it's so easily forgotten.
603.558	Climate change is the collective
603.558	self-portrait of humanity.
607.468	It reflects our decisions as individuals,
610.055	as governments and as industries.
613.406	And if there's anything
613.406	I've learned from looking at air,
616.672	it's that even though
616.672	it's changing, it persists.
620.605	It may not support the kind of life
620.605	that we'd recognize,
624.219	but it will support something.
626.947	And if we humans are such a vital
626.947	part of that change,
630.457	I think it's important
630.457	that we can feel the discussion.
635.032	Because even though it's invisible,
639.105	humans are leaving
639.105	a very vibrant trace in the air.
644.811	Thank you.
646.051	(Applause)
