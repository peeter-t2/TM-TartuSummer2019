15.26	John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.
17.26	And I want to start with a question
19.26	that has just been consuming me
21.26	since I first became familiar with your work.
24.26	In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality
27.26	of a natural force
30.26	in some sort of interplay with creative force.
33.26	Are they ever in equilibrium
35.26	in the way that you see your work?
37.26	Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,
40.26	it's usually to solve a question.
42.26	I had the question popped into my head:
44.26	What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like
48.26	if you could connect the two spheres?
51.26	And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere
54.26	and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?
58.26	And so I went about and made that sculpture,
61.26	turning it out of solid bronze.
64.26	And I did one that was about 35 feet long.
67.26	The sun end was about four inches in diameter,
70.26	and then it tapered over about 35 feet
73.26	to about a millimeter at the Earth end.
76.26	And so for me, it was really exciting
78.26	just to see what it looks like
81.26	if you could step outside and into a larger context,
84.26	as though you were an astronaut,
86.26	and see these two things as an object,
89.26	because they are so intimately bound,
92.26	and one is meaningless without the other.
95.26	JH: Is there a relief
97.26	in playing with these forces?
99.26	And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is
102.26	in playing with these forces.
105.26	TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --
107.26	like that silver one there,
109.26	that was the result
111.26	of hundreds of experiments with magnets,
113.26	trying to find a way to make something float
116.26	with the least possible connection to the ground.
119.26	So I got it down to just one tether
122.26	to be able to support that.
124.26	JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?
127.26	TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.
129.26	JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.
132.26	TS: Yeah.
134.26	It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
137.26	JH: I agree.
140.26	TS: The magnetic works
142.26	are a combination of gravity and magnetism,
145.26	so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces
148.26	that influence everything.
150.26	The sun has a tremendous field
152.26	that extends way beyond the planets
154.26	and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.
157.26	So there's this huge
159.26	invisible shape structures
162.26	that magnetism takes in the universe.
165.26	But with the pendulum,
168.26	it allows me to manifest
171.26	these invisible forces
173.26	that are holding the magnets up.
175.26	My sculptures
177.26	are normally very simplified.
180.26	I try to refine them down
182.26	to very simple forms.
184.26	But the paintings become very complex,
186.26	because I think the fields
188.26	that are supporting them,
190.26	they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,
192.26	and they're interference patterns.
195.26	JH: And they're non-deterministic.
197.26	I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,
200.26	even though the forces can be calculated.
203.26	So the evolution of this --
205.26	I gather this isn't your first pendulum.
207.26	TS: No. (JH: No.)
209.26	TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,
212.26	and I just had a simple cone
214.26	with a spigot at the bottom of it.
217.26	I threw it into an orbit,
219.26	and it only had one color,
221.26	and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,
224.26	so I had to run in there,
226.26	didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.
229.26	So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.
232.26	But then I started dreaming of having six colors.
235.26	I sort of think about it as the DNA --
238.26	these colors, the red, blue, yellow,
240.26	the primary colors and white and black.
243.26	And if you put them together in different combinations --
245.26	just like printing in a sense,
247.26	like how a magazine color is printed --
249.26	and put them under certain forces,
252.26	which is orbiting them
254.26	or passing them back and forth
256.26	or drawing with them,
258.26	these amazing things started appearing.
260.26	JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.
263.26	TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.
265.26	I'll ask a couple of my sons
267.26	to set up the canvases here.
271.26	I want to just say --
273.26	so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.
275.26	JH: Thanks guys.
278.26	TS: So here are the --
280.26	JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.
282.26	TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit
285.26	and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.
288.26	(Laughter)
301.26	JH: Whoa. That is ...
306.26	ooh, nice.
310.26	TS: So something like this.
312.26	I'm doing this as a demo,
314.26	and it's more playful,
317.26	but inevitably,
319.26	all of this can be used.
322.26	I can redeem this painting,
324.26	just continuing on,
326.26	doing layers upon layers.
328.26	And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,
330.26	and I'm contemplating it,
332.26	and I'll do another session with it
335.26	and bring it up to another level,
338.26	where all of this
340.26	becomes the background, the depth of it.
343.26	JH: That's fantastic.
348.26	So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there
351.26	are like radio-controlled airplane valves.
354.26	TS: Yes, they're servos with cams
357.26	that pinch these rubber tubes.
359.26	And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,
361.26	or you can have them wide open.
363.26	And all of the colors
365.26	come out one central port
367.26	at the bottom.
369.26	You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,
372.26	or I could put anything into this.
374.26	It could be tomato sauce,
377.26	or anything could be dispensed --
380.26	sand, powders or anything like that.
383.26	JH: So many forces there.
385.26	You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,
387.26	you've got the fluid dynamics.
393.26	Each of these beautiful paintings,
396.26	are they images in and of themselves,
399.26	or are they records
401.26	of a physical event
403.26	called the pendulum approaching the canvas?
406.26	TS: Well, this painting here,
408.26	I wanted to do something very simple,
410.26	a simple, iconic image
412.26	of two ripples interfering.
415.26	So the one on the right was done first,
417.26	and then the one on the left
419.26	was done over it.
421.26	And then I left gaps
423.26	so you could see the one that was done before.
425.26	And then when I did the second one,
427.26	it really disturbed the piece --
429.26	these big blue lines
431.26	crashing through the center of it --
433.26	and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.
436.26	There are lines in front of the one on the right,
440.26	and there are lines behind the one on the left,
443.26	and so it takes it into different planes.
447.26	What it's also about,
449.26	just the little events,
452.26	the events of the interpenetration of --
455.26	JH: Two stars, or --
457.26	TS: Two things that happened --
459.26	there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.
462.26	There are shapes that come about
464.26	just by the marriage
466.26	of two events that are happening,
468.26	and I'm very interested in that.
471.26	Like the occurrence of moire patterns.
474.26	Like this green one,
476.26	this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,
479.26	but it has some --
481.26	see, in the upper third --
483.26	there are these moires and interference patterns
486.26	that are radio kind of imagery.
488.26	And that's something that in painting
490.26	I've never seen done.
492.26	I've never seen a representation
494.26	of a kind of radio interference patterns,
497.26	which are so ubiquitous
500.26	and such an important part of our lives.
503.26	JH: Is that a literal part of the image,
505.26	or is my eye making that interference pattern --
508.26	is my eye completing that interference pattern?
510.26	TS: It is the paint actually,
512.26	makes it real.
514.26	It's really manifested there.
516.26	If I throw a very concentric circle,
519.26	or concentric ellipse,
521.26	it just dutifully makes
523.26	these evenly spaced lines,
525.26	which get closer and closer together,
528.26	which describes how gravity works.
530.26	There's something very appealing
532.26	about the exactitude of science
534.26	that I really enjoy.
536.26	And I love the shapes that I see
539.26	in scientific observations
542.26	and apparatus,
544.26	especially astronomical forms
547.26	and the idea of the vastness of it,
549.26	the scale,
551.26	is very interesting to me.
553.26	My focus in recent years
556.26	has kind of shifted more toward biology.
559.26	Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,
562.26	odd things appear
564.26	that really look like horses or birds
567.26	or crocodiles, elephants.
570.26	There are lots of things that appear.
572.26	When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,
575.26	but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.
578.26	And then there are all these forms
580.26	that we don't know what they are,
582.26	but they're equally well-resolved
584.26	and complex.
586.26	So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.
589.26	Because since it has the ability
591.26	to make forms
593.26	that look like forms that we're familiar with
595.26	in biology,
597.26	it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.
600.26	And maybe it's the kind of forms
602.26	we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,
604.26	where there are probably lakes
606.26	with fish swimming under the surface.
608.26	JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.
610.26	Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
613.26	You know, it seems
616.26	at this stage in your life,
618.26	you also very personally
620.26	are in this state of confrontation
623.26	with a sort of dissonant --
626.26	I suppose it's an electromagnetic force
628.26	that somehow governs your Parkinson's
630.26	and this creative force
632.26	that is both the artist
635.26	who is in the here and now
637.26	and this sort of arc of your whole life.
639.26	Is that relevant to your work?
642.26	TS: As it turns out,
644.26	this device kind of comes in handy,
646.26	because I don't have to have
648.26	the fine motor skills to do,
650.26	that I can operate slides,
652.26	which is more of a mental process.
654.26	I'm looking at it and making decisions:
657.26	It needs more red, it needs more blue,
659.26	it needs a different shape.
661.26	And so I make these creative decisions
664.26	and can execute them
667.26	in a much, much simpler way.
669.26	I mean, I've got the symptoms.
672.26	I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,
675.26	but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
678.26	In my case,
680.26	my left hand has a significant tremor
683.26	and my left leg also.
686.26	I'm left-handed, and so I draw.
689.26	All my creations
691.26	really start on small drawings,
694.26	which I have thousands of,
696.26	and it's my way of just thinking.
698.26	I draw with a simple pencil,
701.26	and at first, the Parkinson's
703.26	was really upsetting,
705.26	because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.
709.26	JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.
712.26	You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.
715.26	You think of yourself as the servant.
718.26	TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
721.26	It just has so much in it.
724.26	And I think nature
726.26	wants to express itself
728.26	in the sense that we are nature,
730.26	humans are of the universe.
733.26	The universe is in our mind,
735.26	and our minds are in the universe.
737.26	And we are expressions
739.26	of the universe, basically.
741.26	As humans,
743.26	ultimately being part of the universe,
746.26	we're kind of the spokespeople
748.26	or the observer part
750.26	of the constituency
753.26	of the universe.
755.26	And to interface with it,
757.26	with a device that lets these forces
760.26	that are everywhere
762.26	act and show what they can do,
764.26	giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,
767.26	it's a good ally.
770.26	It's a terrific studio assistant.
772.26	JH: Well, I love the idea
774.26	that somewhere within this idea
776.26	of fine motion and control
779.26	with the traditional skills
781.26	that you have with your hand,
783.26	some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,
785.26	and that's the beauty here.
787.26	Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.
790.26	TS: Thank you, John.
792.26	(Applause)
