17.617	Good afternoon.
19.489	There's a medical revolution
19.489	happening all around us,
22.26	and it's one that's going
22.26	to help us conquer
24.38	some of society's most dreaded conditions,
26.404	including cancer.
28.523	The revolution is called angiogenesis,
31.919	and it's based on the process
31.919	that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.
36.531	So why should we care about blood vessels?
38.61	Well, the human body
38.61	is literally packed with them --
44.91	End to end, that would form a line
44.91	that would circle the earth twice.
49.339	The smallest blood vessels
49.339	are called capillaries.
52.07	We've got 19 billion of them
52.07	in our bodies.
55.637	And these are the vessels of life,
58.444	and as I'll show you,
58.444	they can also be the vessels of death.
63.279	Now, the remarkable thing
63.279	about blood vessels
65.461	is that they have this ability
67.342	to adapt to whatever environment
67.342	they're growing in.
70.079	For example, in the liver,
70.079	they form channels to detoxify the blood;
73.36	in the lungs, they line air sacs
73.36	for gas exchange.
76.115	In muscle, they corkscrew,
77.878	so that muscles can contract
77.878	without cutting off circulation.
81.138	And in nerves, they course along
81.138	like power lines,
83.685	keeping those nerves alive.
85.709	We get most of these blood vessels
87.764	when we're actually still in the womb.
90.026	And what that means is that as adults,
92.26	blood vessels don't normally grow.
94.531	Except in a few special circumstances.
98.047	In women, blood vessels grow every month,
100.26	to build the lining of the uterus.
102.101	During pregnancy, they form the placenta,
104.552	which connects mom and baby.
107.289	And after injury, blood vessels
107.289	actually have to grow under the scab
111.583	in order to heal a wound.
113.26	And this is actually what it looks like,
115.211	hundreds of blood vessels, all growing
115.211	toward the center of the wound.
119.381	So the body has the ability to regulate
122.192	the amount of blood vessels
122.192	that are present at any given time.
125.284	It does this through an elaborate
125.284	and elegant system of checks and balances,
129.696	stimulators and inhibitors
129.696	of angiogenesis,
132.585	such that, when we need
132.585	a brief burst of blood vessels,
135.26	the body can do this
135.26	by releasing stimulators,
138.26	proteins called angiogenic factors,
140.482	that act as natural fertilizer,
140.482	and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
144.672	When those excess vessels
144.672	are no longer needed,
146.937	the body prunes them back to baseline,
149.548	using naturally-occurring
149.548	inhibitors of angiogenesis.
153.26	There are other situations
153.26	where we start beneath the baseline,
156.577	and we need to grow more blood vessels,
156.577	just to get back to normal levels --
160.253	for example, after an injury --
161.78	and the body can do that too,
161.78	but only to that normal level,
164.655	that set point.
166.372	But what we now know,
166.372	is that for a number of diseases,
169.26	there are defects in the system,
171.669	where the body can't prune back
171.669	extra blood vessels,
174.194	or can't grow enough new ones
174.194	in the right place at the right time.
178.144	And in these situations,
178.144	angiogenesis is out of balance.
182.453	And when angiogenesis is out of balance,
184.405	a myriad of diseases result.
186.564	For example, insufficient angiogenesis --
186.564	not enough blood vessels --
190.26	leads to wounds
190.26	that don't heal, heart attacks,
193.26	legs without circulation,
193.26	death from stroke,
195.899	nerve damage.
197.717	And on the other end,
197.717	excessive angiogenesis --
200.058	too many blood vessels -- drives disease,
202.259	and we see this in cancer, blindness,
204.871	arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.
208.566	In total, there are more
208.566	than 70 major diseases
211.733	affecting more than a billion
211.733	people worldwide,
214.226	that all look on the surface to be
214.226	different from one another,
217.218	but all actually share
217.218	abnormal angiogenesis
220.06	as their common denominator.
222.631	And this realization is allowing
222.631	us to re-conceptualize
225.732	the way that we actually
225.732	approach these diseases,
228.168	by controlling angiogenesis.
231.089	Now, I'm going to focus on cancer,
233.022	because angiogenesis
233.022	is a hallmark of cancer --
236.513	every type of cancer.
238.513	So here we go.
240.206	This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous
240.206	mass growing inside a brain.
244.12	And under the microscope,
245.393	you can see hundreds
245.393	of these brown-stained blood vessels,
248.43	capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,
250.501	bringing oxygen and nutrients.
253.549	But cancers don't start out like this,
255.652	and in fact, cancers don't start out
255.652	with a blood supply.
258.951	They start out as small,
258.951	microscopic nests of cells,
262.611	that can only grow to one half
262.611	a cubic millimeter in size.
266.939	That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.
269.111	Then they can't get any larger
269.111	because they don't have a blood supply,
272.445	so they don't have
272.445	enough oxygen or nutrients.
274.624	In fact, we're probably forming
274.624	these microscopic cancers
277.973	all the time in our body.
280.139	Autopsy studies from people
280.139	who died in car accidents
283.725	have shown that about 40 percent of women
283.725	between the ages of 40 and 50
288.575	actually have microscopic
288.575	cancers in their breasts.
292.48	About 50 percent of men
292.48	in their 50s and 60s
294.845	have microscopic prostate cancers,
297.398	and virtually 100 percent of us,
297.398	by the time we reach our 70s,
301.089	will have microscopic cancers
301.089	growing in our thyroid.
304.58	Yet, without a blood supply,
306.26	most of these cancers
306.26	will never become dangerous.
310.667	Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor
312.897	and who was the pioneer
312.897	of the angiogenesis field,
315.317	"once called this ""cancer without disease."""
319.885	So the body's ability
319.885	to balance angiogenesis,
322.714	when it's working properly,
324.26	prevents blood vessels
324.26	from feeding cancers.
326.54	And this turns out to be
328.26	one of our most important
328.26	defense mechanisms
331.06	against cancer.
333.472	In fact, if you actually
333.472	block angiogenesis
335.757	and prevent blood vessels
335.757	from ever reaching cancer cells,
338.55	tumors simply can't grow up.
339.975	But once angiogenesis occurs,
341.752	cancers can grow exponentially.
344.649	And this is actually how a cancer
344.649	goes from being harmless,
348.982	to being deadly.
350.918	Cancer cells mutate,
352.26	and they gain the ability to release
352.26	lots of those angiogenic factors,
355.571	natural fertilizer,
356.766	that tip the balance in favor
356.766	of blood vessels invading the cancer.
360.236	And once those vessels invade the cancer,
362.26	it can expand,
362.26	it can invade local tissues,
365.26	and the same vessels
365.26	that are feeding tumors
367.585	allow cancer cells to exit
367.585	into the circulation as metastases.
372.688	And unfortunately,
372.688	this late stage of cancer
375.466	is the one at which
375.466	it's most likely to be diagnosed,
379.45	when angiogenesis is already turned on,
381.489	and cancer cells are growing like wild.
384.997	So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point
389.126	between a harmless cancer
389.126	and a harmful one,
392.26	then one major part
392.26	of the angiogenesis revolution
395.558	is a new approach to treating cancer
397.337	by cutting off the blood supply.
400.169	We call this antiangiogenic therapy,
403.401	and it's completely different
403.401	from chemotherapy,
405.703	because it selectively aims
407.607	at the blood vessels
407.607	that are feeding the cancers.
410.644	We can do this because tumor blood vessels
410.644	are unlike normal, healthy vessels
415.103	we see in other places of the body --
416.917	they're abnormal,
416.917	they're very poorly constructed,
420.065	and because of that,
420.065	they're highly vulnerable
422.343	to treatments that target them.
425.926	In effect, when we give cancer patients
425.926	antiangiogenic therapy --
429.482	here, an experimental drug for a glioma,
432.49	which is a type of brain tumor --
434.26	you can see that there are
434.26	dramatic changes that occur
437.066	when the tumor is being starved.
439.963	Here's a woman with a breast cancer,
441.891	being treated with the antiangiogenic
441.891	drug called Avastin,
444.839	which is FDA approved.
446.831	And you can see
446.831	that the halo of blood flow
449.548	disappears after treatment.
452.723	Well, I've just shown you
452.723	two very different types of cancer
456.26	that both responded
456.26	to antiangiogenic therapy.
459.426	So a few years ago, I asked myself,
461.609	"""Can we take this one step further"
461.609	and treat other cancers,
465.569	"even in other species?"""
469.148	So here is a nine year-old
469.148	boxer named Milo,
471.562	who had a very aggressive tumor
473.26	called a malignant neurofibroma
473.26	growing on his shoulder.
476.292	It invaded into his lungs.
477.901	His veterinarian only gave him
477.901	three months to live.
480.409	So we created a cocktail
480.409	of antiangiogenic drugs
483.26	that could be mixed into his dog food,
485.26	as well as an antiangiogenic cream,
487.537	that could be applied
487.537	on the surface of the tumor.
490.537	And within a few weeks of treatment,
492.696	we were able to slow down
492.696	that cancer's growth,
495.046	such that we were ultimately
495.046	able to extend Milo’s survival
498.323	to six times what the veterinarian
498.323	had initially predicted,
501.966	all with a very good quality of life.
504.566	And we've subsequently treated
504.566	more than 600 dogs.
507.26	We have about a 60 percent response rate,
509.554	and improved survival for these pets
511.99	that were about to be euthanized.
514.514	So let me show you a couple
514.514	of even more interesting examples.
518.414	This is 20-year-old dolphin
518.414	living in Florida,
520.763	and she had these lesions in her mouth
522.938	that, over the course of three years,
524.748	developed into invasive
524.748	squamous cell cancers.
527.87	So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
530.632	We had it painted on top of the cancer
530.632	three times a week.
534.559	And over the course of seven months,
536.782	the cancers completely disappeared,
538.52	and the biopsies came back as normal.
542.893	Here's a cancer growing on the lip
544.623	of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.
546.615	It's a very, very deadly type
546.615	of cancer called an angiosarcoma.
549.742	It had already spread to his lymph nodes,
551.734	so we used an antiangiogenic
551.734	skin cream for the lip,
554.782	and the oral cocktail, so we could treat
554.782	from the inside as well as the outside.
559.387	And over the course of six months,
561.538	he experienced a complete remission.
564.593	And here he is six years later,
567.768	Guinness, with his very happy owner.
570.673	(Applause)
573.26	Now obviously, antiangiogenic therapy
573.26	could be used for a wide range of cancers.
578.51	And in fact, the first
578.51	pioneering treatments
580.819	for people as well as dogs,
582.414	are already becoming available.
584.074	There are 12 different drugs,
587.996	But the real question is:
589.26	How well do these work in practice?
591.543	So here's actually
591.543	the patient survival data
594.68	from eight different types of cancer.
596.489	The bars represent survival time
598.972	taken from the era in which
598.972	there was only chemotherapy,
602.536	or surgery, or radiation available.
605.194	But starting in 2004,
607.591	when antiangiogenic therapies
607.591	first became available,
610.241	you can see that there has been a 70
610.241	to 100 percent improvement in survival
615.175	for people with kidney cancer,
615.175	multiple myeloma,
618.36	colorectal cancer,
618.36	and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
622.439	That's impressive.
624.241	But for other tumors and cancer types,
627.224	the improvements have only been modest.
630.26	So I started asking myself,
632.168	"""Why haven't we been able to do better?"""
635.421	And the answer, to me, is obvious:
637.572	we're treating cancer
637.572	too late in the game,
639.898	when it's already established,
641.581	and oftentimes, it's already
641.581	spread or metastasized.
644.732	And as a doctor,
645.907	I know that once a disease progresses
645.907	to an advanced stage,
649.773	achieving a cure can be difficult,
649.773	if not impossible.
654.804	So I went back to the biology
654.804	of angiogenesis, and started thinking:
660.712	Could the answer to cancer
660.712	be preventing angiogenesis,
665.738	beating cancer at its own game,
667.627	so the cancers could never
667.627	become dangerous?
671.674	This could help healthy people,
673.38	as well as people who've already
673.38	beaten cancer once or twice,
677.111	and want to find a way
677.111	to keep it from coming back.
680.456	So to look for a way to prevent
680.456	angiogenesis in cancer,
683.26	I went back to look at cancer's causes.
685.832	And what really intrigued me,
687.26	was when I saw that diet
687.26	accounts for 30 to 35 percent
691.617	of environmentally-caused cancers.
694.393	Now the obvious thing is to think about
694.393	what we could remove from our diet,
698.131	what to strip out, take away.
700.702	But I actually took
700.702	a completely opposite approach,
703.517	and began asking: What could
703.517	we be adding to our diet
706.93	that's naturally antiangiogenic,
709.435	and that could boost
709.435	the body's defense system,
711.792	and beat back those blood vessels
711.792	that are feeding cancers?
714.895	In other words, can we eat
714.895	to starve cancer?
718.316	(Laughter)
719.665	Well, the answer is yes,
719.665	and I'm going to show you how.
722.434	And our search for this
722.434	has taken us to the market,
725.822	the farm and to the spice cabinet,
727.695	because what we've discovered
729.181	is that Mother Nature
729.181	has laced a large number
731.475	of foods and beverages and herbs
733.26	with naturally-occurring
733.26	inhibitors of angiogenesis.
737.638	Here's a test system we developed.
739.361	At the center is a ring
740.544	from which hundreds of blood vessels
740.544	are growing out in a starburst fashion.
744.178	And we can use this system
744.178	to test dietary factors
747.121	at concentrations
747.121	that are obtainable by eating.
750.969	Let me show you what happens
752.382	when we put in an extract from red grapes.
755.144	The active ingredient is resveratrol,
757.26	it's also found in red wine.
759.431	This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,
762.26	by 60 percent.
764.537	Here's what happens when we added
764.537	an extract from strawberries.
767.728	It potently inhibits angiogenesis.
770.98	And extract from soybeans.
773.985	And here is a growing list
775.93	of antiangiogenic foods and beverages
775.93	that we're interested in studying.
780.572	For each food type,
782.586	we believe that there are
782.586	different potencies
784.832	within different strains and varietals.
787.206	And we want to measure this because,
789.461	well, while you're eating a strawberry
791.699	or drinking tea,
793.2	why not select the one that's most potent
795.26	for preventing cancer?
797.26	So here are four different teas
797.26	that we've tested.
800.36	They're all common ones:
800.36	Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,
804.26	Earl Grey and a special blend
804.26	that we prepared,
806.904	and you can see clearly
806.904	that the teas vary in their potency,
810.629	from less potent to more potent.
814.002	But what's very cool
815.51	is when we combine
815.51	the two less potent teas together,
819.283	the combination, the blend,
819.283	is more potent than either one alone.
824.545	This means there's food synergy.
829.634	Here's some more data from our testing.
831.547	Now in the lab, we can
831.547	simulate tumor angiogenesis,
834.483	represented here in a black bar.
836.498	And using this system, we can test
836.498	the potency of cancer drugs.
839.59	So the shorter the bar,
841.146	the less angiogenesis -- that's good.
844.26	And here are some common drugs
846.123	that have been associated with reducing
846.123	the risk of cancer in people.
850.26	Statins, nonsteroidal
850.26	anti-inflammatory drugs,
853.085	and a few others --
853.085	they inhibit angiogenesis, too.
857.26	And here are the dietary factors
859.26	going head-to-head against these drugs.
862.179	You can see they clearly hold their own,
864.26	and in some cases, they're more potent
864.26	than the actual drugs.
868.011	Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.
872.527	I could go home and cook a tasty meal
872.527	using these ingredients.
876.84	Imagine if we could create
876.84	the world's first rating system,
880.832	in which we could score foods
882.403	according to their antiangiogenic,
882.403	cancer-preventative properties.
886.567	And that's what we're doing right now.
889.599	Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,
891.549	and so the real question is:
893.357	What is the evidence in people
895.659	that eating certain foods can reduce
895.659	angiogenesis in cancer?
900.5	Well, the best example I know
902.26	is a study of 79,000 men
902.26	followed over 20 years,
906.345	in which it was found that men
906.345	who consumed cooked tomatoes
909.21	two to three times a week,
910.724	had up to a 50 percent reduction
913.26	in their risk of developing
913.26	prostate cancer.
916.366	Now, we know that tomatoes
916.366	are a good source of lycopene,
919.696	and lycopene is antiangiogenic.
922.617	But what's even more
922.617	interesting from this study,
924.959	is that in those men who did
924.959	develop prostate cancer,
927.54	those who ate more
927.54	servings of tomato sauce,
930.358	actually had fewer blood vessels
930.358	feeding their cancer.
934.26	So this human study is a prime example
936.702	of how antiangiogenic substances present
936.702	in food and consumed at practical levels,
941.652	can have an impact on cancer.
943.936	And we're now studying
943.936	the role of a healthy diet --
947.26	with Dean Ornish at UCSF
947.26	and Tufts University --
950.26	the role of this healthy diet
950.26	on markers of angiogenesis
953.71	that we can find in the bloodstream.
955.96	Obviously, what I've shared with you
955.96	has some far-ranging implications,
959.706	even beyond cancer research.
961.26	Because if we're right,
961.26	it could impact consumer education,
964.536	food services, public health
966.377	and even the insurance industry.
968.6	And in fact, some insurance companies
970.41	are already beginning
970.41	to think along these lines.
972.744	Check out this ad from BlueCross
972.744	BlueShield of Minnesota.
976.671	For many people around the world,
978.37	dietary cancer prevention
978.37	may be the only practical solution,
982.156	because not everybody can afford
982.156	expensive end-stage cancer treatments,
985.629	but everybody could benefit
985.629	from a healthy diet
988.344	based on local, sustainable,
988.344	antiangiogenic crops.
993.505	Now, finally,
995.727	I've talked to you about food,
997.434	and I've talked to you about cancer,
999.26	so there's just one more disease
999.26	that I have to tell you about,
1002.584	and that's obesity.
1004.26	Because it turns out
1004.26	that adipose tissue -- fat --
1008.26	is highly angiogenesis-dependent.
1010.886	And like a tumor, fat grows
1010.886	when blood vessels grow.
1013.68	So the question is:
1014.922	Can we shrink fat
1014.922	by cutting off its blood supply?
1018.73	The top curve shows the body weight
1018.73	of a genetically obese mouse
1023.259	that eats nonstop until it turns fat,
1026.433	like this furry tennis ball.
1028.111	(Laughter)
1029.321	And the bottom curve
1029.321	is the weight of a normal mouse.
1032.536	If you take the obese mouse
1033.862	and give it an angiogenesis
1033.862	inhibitor, it loses weight.
1036.559	Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.
1036.559	Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
1040.525	Stop the treatment,
1040.525	it gains the weight back.
1042.66	And, in fact, you can cycle
1042.66	the weight up and down
1045.041	simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.
1047.057	So this approach that we're taking
1047.057	for cancer prevention
1049.826	may also have an application for obesity.
1053.347	The truly interesting thing about this
1055.475	is that we can't take these obese mice
1057.475	and make them lose more weight
1059.26	than what the normal mouse's weight
1059.26	is supposed to be.
1062.481	In other words,
1062.481	we can't create supermodel mice.
1065.514	(Laughter)
1066.799	And this speaks to the role
1066.799	of angiogenesis
1068.867	in regulating healthy set points.
1071.764	Albert Szent-Györgi once said,
1073.695	"""Discovery consists of seeing"
1073.695	what everyone has seen,
1076.26	"and thinking what no one has thought."""
1078.521	I hope I've convinced you
1079.975	that for diseases like cancer,
1079.975	obesity and other conditions,
1083.259	there may be a great power
1085.105	in attacking their common
1085.105	denominator: angiogenesis.
1088.256	And that's what I think
1088.256	the world needs now.
1090.336	Thank you.
1091.511	(Applause)
1101.65	June Cohen: I have
1101.65	a quick question for you.
1103.746	JC: So these drugs aren't exactly
1103.746	in mainstream cancer treatments right now.
1108.648	For anyone out here who has cancer,
1108.648	what would you recommend?
1112.26	Do you recommend pursuing these
1112.26	treatments now, for most cancer patients?
1116.002	William Li: There are
1116.002	antiangiogenic treatments
1118.234	that are FDA approved,
1119.669	and if you're a cancer patient,
1121.677	or working for one or advocating for one,
1121.677	you should ask about them.
1125.612	And there are many clinical trials.
1128.26	The Angiogenesis Foundation
1128.26	is following almost 300 companies,
1131.26	and there are about 100 more
1131.26	drugs in that pipeline.
1135.685	So, consider the approved ones,
1137.26	look for clinical trials,
1138.982	but then between
1138.982	what the doctor can do for you,
1141.505	we need to start asking
1141.505	what can we do for ourselves.
1144.066	This is one of the themes
1144.066	I'm talking about:
1146.17	We can empower ourselves
1147.349	to do the things that doctors
1147.349	can't do for us,
1149.56	which is to use knowledge and take action.
1151.656	And if Mother Nature
1151.656	has given us some clues,
1154.26	we think there might be a new future
1154.26	in the value of how we eat,
1158.536	and what we eat is really
1158.536	our chemotherapy three times a day.
1161.658	JC: Right. And along those lines,
1163.731	for people who might have
1163.731	risk factors for cancer,
1166.26	would you recommend pursuing
1166.26	any treatments prophylactically,
1169.523	or simply pursuing the right diet,
1171.755	with lots of tomato sauce?
1173.539	WL: Well, you know, there's abundant
1173.539	epidemiological evidence,
1176.761	and I think in the information age,
1178.476	it doesn't take long to go
1178.476	to a credible source like PubMed,
1181.339	the National Library of Medicine,
1182.949	to look for epidemiological studies
1182.949	for cancer risk reduction
1186.259	based on diet and based
1186.259	on common medications.
1189.153	And that's certainly something
1189.153	that anybody can look into.
1191.924	JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.
1193.594	(Applause)
