12.794	Philosophers, dramatists, theologians
16.374	have grappled with
16.374	this question for centuries:
18.604	what makes people go wrong?
20.16	Interestingly, I asked this question
20.16	when I was a little kid.
23.16	I grew up in the South Bronx,
23.16	inner-city ghetto in New York,
26.24	and I was surrounded by evil,
27.747	as all kids are who grew up
27.747	in an inner city.
30.327	And I had friends
30.327	who were really good kids,
32.676	who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde
32.676	scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.
36.992	That is, they took drugs,
36.992	got in trouble, went to jail.
40.16	Some got killed, and some did it
40.16	without drug assistance.
44.448	So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson,
44.448	that wasn't fiction.
47.266	The only question is,
47.266	what was in the juice?
49.514	And more importantly, that line
49.514	between good and evil --
53.16	which privileged people like to think
53.16	is fixed and impermeable,
56.652	with them on the good side,
56.652	the others on the bad side --
59.349	I knew that line was movable,
59.349	and it was permeable.
62.436	Good people could be
62.436	seduced across that line,
64.803	and under good and some rare
64.803	circumstances, bad kids could recover
69.031	with help, with reform,
69.031	with rehabilitation.
72.16	So I want to begin
72.16	with this wonderful illusion
74.661	by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.
76.959	If you look at it and focus on the white,
76.959	what you see is a world full of angels.
80.844	But let's look more deeply, and as we do,
83.436	what appears is the demons,
83.436	the devils in the world.
86.992	That tells us several things.
88.397	One, the world is, was, will always
88.397	be filled with good and evil,
91.529	because good and evil is the yin and yang
91.529	of the human condition.
94.601	It tells me something else.
95.911	If you remember,
95.911	God's favorite angel was Lucifer.
99.449	"Apparently, Lucifer means ""the light."""
101.911	"It also means ""the morning star,"""
101.911	in some scripture.
104.661	And apparently, he disobeyed God,
107.89	and that's the ultimate
107.89	disobedience to authority.
110.406	And when he did, Michael, the archangel,
110.406	was sent to kick him out of heaven
115.928	along with the other fallen angels.
117.955	And so Lucifer descends into hell,
117.955	becomes Satan,
121.16	becomes the devil, and the force
121.16	of evil in the universe begins.
124.184	Paradoxically, it was God
124.184	who created hell as a place to store evil.
129.136	He didn't do a good job
129.136	of keeping it there though.
131.541	So, this arc of the cosmic transformation
131.541	of God's favorite angel into the Devil,
136.154	for me, sets the context
136.154	for understanding human beings
139.822	who are transformed from good,
139.822	ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.
144.737	So the Lucifer effect,
144.737	although it focuses on the negatives --
148.788	the negatives that people can become,
151.467	not the negatives that people are --
153.453	leads me to a psychological definition.
156.831	Evil is the exercise of power.
158.828	And that's the key: it's about power.
161.091	To intentionally harm
161.091	people psychologically,
163.68	to hurt people physically,
163.68	to destroy people mortally, or ideas,
167.434	and to commit crimes against humanity.
171.16	"If you Google ""evil,"" a word that should"
171.16	surely have withered by now,
174.47	you come up with 136 million hits
174.47	in a third of a second.
178.16	A few years ago -- I am sure
178.16	all of you were shocked, as I was,
182.682	with the revelation of American soldiers
182.682	abusing prisoners in a strange place
188.16	in a controversial war,
188.16	Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
191.16	And these were men and women
193.191	who were putting prisoners
193.191	through unbelievable humiliation.
198.136	I was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,
199.97	because I had seen
199.97	those same visual parallels
202.16	when I was the prison superintendent
202.16	of the Stanford Prison Study.
205.586	Immediately the Bush
205.586	administration military said what?
208.681	What all administrations say
208.681	when there's a scandal:
211.205	"""Don't blame us. It's not the system."
213.079	It's the few bad apples,
213.079	"the few rogue soldiers."""
215.503	My hypothesis is,
215.503	American soldiers are good, usually.
218.558	Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.
220.643	But how am I going to deal
220.643	with that hypothesis?
223.16	I became an expert witness
223.16	for one of the guards,
225.704	Sergeant Chip Frederick,
225.704	and in that position,
227.871	I had access to the dozen
227.871	investigative reports.
230.808	I had access to him.
232.632	I could study him, have him come
232.632	to my home, get to know him,
235.957	do psychological analysis to see,
235.957	was he a good apple or bad apple.
239.388	And thirdly, I had access
239.388	to all of the 1,000 pictures
243.323	that these soldiers took.
245.025	These pictures are
245.025	of a violent or sexual nature.
247.559	All of them come from the cameras
247.559	of American soldiers.
250.969	Because everybody has
250.969	a digital camera or cell phone camera,
253.852	they took pictures of everything,
253.852	more than 1,000.
256.21	And what I've done is I organized them
256.21	into various categories.
259.188	But these are by United States
259.188	military police, army reservists.
264.637	They are not soldiers prepared
264.637	for this mission at all.
268.143	And it all happened in a single place,
268.143	Tier 1-A, on the night shift.
271.84	Why?
273.065	Tier 1-A was the center
273.065	for military intelligence.
275.691	It was the interrogation hold.
277.691	The CIA was there.
278.916	Interrogators from
278.916	Titan Corporation, all there,
282.098	and they're getting no information
282.098	about the insurgency.
284.908	So they're going to put pressure
284.908	on these soldiers,
287.402	military police, to cross the line,
289.146	give them permission to break
289.146	the will of the enemy,
292.16	to prepare them for interrogation,
292.16	to soften them up,
294.661	to take the gloves off.
295.911	Those are the euphemisms,
295.911	and this is how it was interpreted.
299.794	Let's go down to that dungeon.
303.445	(Typewriting)
305.239	[Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses 2008
305.239	Military Police Guards' Photos]
311.248	[The following images include nudity
311.248	and graphic depictions of violence]
318.338	(Camera shutter sounds)
339.173	(Thuds)
345.721	(Camera shutter)
359.516	(Camera shutter)
369.16	(Breathing)
377.16	(Bells)
407.219	(Bells end)
409.239	So, pretty horrific.
411.501	That's one of the visual
411.501	illustrations of evil.
415.332	And it should not have escaped you
417.117	that the reason I paired
417.117	the prisoner with his arms out
420.378	with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity
423.16	is that that prisoner was mentally ill.
425.766	That prisoner covered himself
425.766	with shit every day,
428.143	they had to roll him in dirt
428.143	so he wouldn't stink.
430.585	But the guards ended up
430.585	"calling him ""Shit Boy."""
432.957	What was he doing in that prison
432.957	rather than in some mental institution?
437.657	In any event, here's former
437.657	Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.
440.396	He comes down and says,
440.396	"""I want to know, who is responsible?"
443.23	"Who are the bad apples?"""
444.633	Well, that's a bad question.
446.065	You have to reframe it and ask,
446.065	"""What is responsible?"""
448.71	"""What"" could be the who of people,"
450.382	but it could also be
450.382	the what of the situation,
452.943	and obviously that's wrongheaded.
454.653	How do psychologists try to understand
454.653	such transformations of human character,
458.522	if you believe
458.522	that they were good soldiers
460.546	before they went down to that dungeon?
462.38	There are three ways.
462.38	The main way is called dispositional.
465.266	We look at what's inside
465.266	of the person, the bad apples.
468.16	This is the foundation
468.16	of all of social science,
471.495	the foundation of religion,
471.495	the foundation of war.
475.16	Social psychologists like me
475.16	come along and say,
477.423	"""Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,"
479.566	but you'll have to be aware
479.566	of the situation.
481.94	Who are the cast of characters?
481.94	What's the costume?
484.345	"Is there a stage director?"""
485.828	And so we're interested in
485.828	what are the external factors
488.519	around the individual -- the bad barrel?
491.064	Social scientists stop there
491.064	and they miss the big point
493.735	that I discovered when I became
493.735	an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.
496.998	The power is in the system.
498.573	The system creates the situation
498.573	that corrupts the individuals,
501.838	and the system is the legal, political,
501.838	economic, cultural background.
506.646	And this is where the power
506.646	is of the bad-barrel makers.
510.299	If you want to change a person,
510.299	change the situation.
512.824	And to change it, you've got to know
512.824	where the power is, in the system.
516.237	So the Lucifer effect
516.237	involves understanding
518.309	human character transformations
518.309	with these three factors.
523.284	And it's a dynamic interplay.
524.697	What do the people bring
524.697	into the situation?
526.787	What does the situation bring out of them?
528.819	And what is the system
528.819	that creates and maintains that situation?
532.784	My recent book,
532.784	"""The Lucifer Effect,"" is about,"
535.092	how do you understand
535.092	how good people turn evil?
537.355	And it has a lot of detail
537.355	about what I'm going to talk about today.
541.056	"So Dr. Z's ""Lucifer Effect,"""
541.056	although it focuses on evil,
544.16	really is a celebration of the human
544.16	mind's infinite capacity
548.344	to make any of us kind or cruel,
550.926	caring or indifferent,
550.926	creative or destructive,
553.472	and it makes some of us villains.
555.774	And the good news that I'm going
555.774	to hopefully come to at the end
558.895	is that it makes some of us heroes.
561.811	This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker
561.811	summarizes my whole talk:
565.384	"""I'm neither a good cop"
565.384	nor a bad cop, Jerome.
567.551	Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam
569.534	of positive and negative
569.534	personality traits
572.027	that emerge or not, depending
572.027	"on the circumstances."""
575.541	(Laughter)
577.55	There's a study some of you
577.55	think you know about,
580.426	but very few people
580.426	have ever read the story.
582.637	You watched the movie.
584.586	This is Stanley Milgram,
584.586	little Jewish kid from the Bronx,
587.959	and he asked the question,
587.959	"""Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"""
591.082	"People say, ""No, that's Nazi Germany,"
591.082	"Hitler, you know, that's 1939."""
594.611	"He said, ""Yeah, but suppose"
594.611	Hitler asked you,
597.028	'Would you electrocute a stranger?'
597.028	"'No way, I'm a good person.'"""
600.222	"He said, ""Why don't"
600.222	we put you in a situation
602.342	and give you a chance
602.342	"to see what you would do?"""
604.605	And so what he did was he tested
604.605	1,000 ordinary people.
611.805	"And the ad said, ""Psychologists"
611.805	want to understand memory.
614.544	We want to improve people's memory,
614.544	"because it is the key to success."""
617.862	OK?
620.064	"""We're going to give you five bucks --"
620.064	four dollars for your time.
624.073	We don't want college students.
624.073	"We want men between 20 and 50."""
627.551	In the later studies, they ran women.
629.337	Ordinary people: barbers,
629.337	clerks, white-collar people.
632.434	So, you go down,
634.038	one of you will be a learner,
634.038	one will be a teacher.
636.573	The learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.
638.502	He gets tied up to the shock
638.502	apparatus in another room.
641.635	The learner could be middle-aged,
641.635	could be as young as 20.
645.227	And one of you is told by the authority,
645.227	the guy in the lab coat,
648.467	"""Your job as teacher is to give him"
648.467	material to learn.
651.106	Gets it right, reward.
652.344	Gets it wrong, you press
652.344	a button on the shock box.
654.759	The first button is 15 volts.
654.759	"He doesn't even feel it."""
658.16	That's the key.
659.347	All evil starts with 15 volts.
661.16	And then the next step
661.16	is another 15 volts.
664.009	The problem is, at the end
664.009	of the line, it's 450 volts.
667.03	And as you go along, the guy is screaming,
669.16	"""I've got a heart condition!"
669.16	"I'm out of here!"""
671.375	You're a good person. You complain.
673.105	"""Sir, who will be responsible"
673.105	"if something happens to him?"""
675.985	The experimenter says,
675.985	"""Don't worry, I will be responsible."
678.772	"Continue, teacher."""
680.125	And the question is, who would go
680.125	all the way to 450 volts?
683.954	You should notice here,
683.954	when it gets up to 375,
686.554	"it says, ""Danger. Severe Shock."""
688.103	"When it gets up to here, there's ""XXX"" --"
688.103	the pornography of power.
691.897	So Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,
694.031	"""What percent of American citizens"
694.031	"would go to the end?"""
697.16	They said only one percent.
698.685	Because that's sadistic behavior,
698.685	and we know, psychiatry knows,
702.275	only one percent
702.275	of Americans are sadistic.
704.391	OK.
706.147	Here's the data.
706.147	They could not be more wrong.
708.777	Two thirds go all the way to 450 volts.
711.622	This was just one study.
713.16	Milgram did more than 16 studies.
715.468	And look at this.
717.491	In study 16, where you see
717.491	somebody like you go all the way,
722.447	In study five, if you see people rebel,
726.772	What about women?
726.772	Study 13 -- no different than men.
729.938	So Milgram is quantifying evil
729.938	as the willingness of people
733.503	to blindly obey authority,
733.503	to go all the way to 450 volts.
736.606	And it's like a dial on human nature.
738.752	A dial in a sense that you can make
738.752	almost everybody totally obedient,
743.16	down to the majority, down to none.
746.767	What are the external parallels?
746.767	For all research is artificial.
749.791	What's the validity in the real world?
	committed suicide or were murdered
754.663	by family and friends
754.663	in Guyana jungle in 1978,
757.672	because they were blindly obedient
757.672	to this guy, their pastor --
760.726	not their priest -- their pastor,
760.726	Reverend Jim Jones.
763.457	He persuaded them to commit mass suicide.
766.277	And so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,
768.166	a man of God who becomes
768.166	the Angel of Death.
772.662	Milgram's study is all about individual
772.662	authority to control people.
777.793	Most of the time, we are in institutions,
780.16	so the Stanford Prison Study
780.16	is a study of the power of institutions
783.721	to influence individual behavior.
785.685	Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I
785.685	were in the same high school class
789.313	in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.
793.136	I did this study
793.136	with my graduate students,
795.247	especially Craig Haney --
795.247	and it also began work with an ad.
798.097	We had a cheap, little ad,
799.549	but we wanted college students
799.549	for a study of prison life.
	took personality tests.
805.713	We did interviews.
806.987	Picked two dozen: the most normal,
806.987	the most healthy.
809.457	Randomly assigned them
809.457	to be prisoner and guard.
811.748	So on day one, we knew we had good apples.
813.792	I'm going to put them in a bad situation.
815.769	And secondly, we know
815.769	there's no difference
818.07	between the boys who will be guards
818.07	and those who will be prisoners.
821.436	To the prisoners, we said,
822.986	"""Wait at home. The study"
822.986	"will begin Sunday."""
825.136	We didn't tell them
826.36	that the city police were going
826.36	to come and do realistic arrests.
829.579	(Video) (Music)
835.999	[Day 1]
863.473	Student: A police car pulls up in front,
863.473	and a cop comes to the front door,
868.471	and knocks, and says he's looking for me.
870.49	So they, right there, you know,
870.49	they took me out the door,
873.435	they put my hands against the car.
876.957	It was a real cop car,
876.957	it was a real policeman,
879.182	and there were real
879.182	neighbors in the street,
881.269	who didn't know
881.269	that this was an experiment.
884.789	And there was cameras
884.789	all around and neighbors all around.
887.567	They put me in the car,
887.567	then they drove me around Palo Alto.
892.338	They took me to the basement
892.338	of the police station.
904.373	Then they put me in a cell.
905.791	I was the first one to be picked up,
905.791	so they put me in a cell,
908.733	which was just like a room
908.733	with a door with bars on it.
912.446	You could tell it wasn't a real jail.
914.264	They locked me in there,
914.264	in this degrading little outfit.
918.77	They were taking
918.77	this experiment too seriously.
921.369	Here are the prisoners, who are going
921.369	to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.
925.226	Here are the guards
925.226	with the symbols of power and anonymity.
928.142	Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet
928.142	bowls out with their bare hands,
931.615	to do other humiliating tasks.
933.111	They strip them naked.
933.111	They sexually taunt them.
935.377	They begin to do degrading activities,
935.377	like having them simulate sodomy.
938.938	You saw simulating fellatio
938.938	in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.
942.193	My guards did it in five days.
944.495	The stress reaction was so extreme
946.346	that normal kids we picked
946.346	because they were healthy
948.806	had breakdowns within 36 hours.
950.413	The study ended after six days,
950.413	because it was out of control.
954.462	Five kids had emotional breakdowns.
958.466	Does it make a difference
959.943	if warriors go to battle
959.943	changing their appearance or not?
962.692	If they're anonymous,
962.692	how do they treat their victims?
965.469	In some cultures, they go to war
965.469	without changing their appearance.
968.652	In others, they paint themselves
968.652	"like ""Lord of the Flies."""
971.404	In some, they wear masks.
972.62	In many, soldiers
972.62	are anonymous in uniform.
974.705	So this anthropologist, John Watson, found
979.426	Do they change their appearance? 15.
981.789	Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.
984.4	If they don't change their appearance,
986.247	only one of eight kills,
986.247	tortures or mutilates.
988.484	The key is in the red zone.
989.812	If they change their appearance,
	kill, torture, mutilate.
995.136	And that's the power of anonymity.
996.78	So what are the seven social processes
998.709	that grease the slippery slope of evil?
1000.591	Mindlessly taking the first small step.
1002.741	Dehumanization of others.
1002.741	De-individuation of self.
1005.407	Diffusion of personal responsibility.
1007.333	Blind obedience to authority.
1009.004	Uncritical conformity to group norms.
1010.922	Passive tolerance of evil
1010.922	through inaction, or indifference.
1014.16	And it happens when you're
1014.16	in a new or unfamiliar situation.
1017.042	Your habitual response
1017.042	patterns don't work.
1019.115	Your personality
1019.115	and morality are disengaged.
1022.803	"""Nothing is easier"
1022.803	than to denounce the evildoer;
1025.137	nothing more difficult
1025.137	"than understanding him,"" Dostoyevsky."
1028.183	Understanding is not excusing.
1028.183	Psychology is not excuse-ology.
1032.219	So social and psychological
1032.219	research reveals
1034.37	how ordinary, good people can be
1034.37	transformed without the drugs.
1037.666	You don't need it. You just need
1037.666	the social-psychological processes.
1040.991	Real world parallels?
1042.71	Compare this with this.
1046.136	James Schlesinger --
1046.136	I'm going to end with this -- says,
1048.848	"""Psychologists have attempted"
1048.848	to understand how and why
1051.471	individuals and groups
1051.471	who usually act humanely
1053.924	can sometimes act otherwise
1053.924	"in certain circumstances."""
1057.136	That's the Lucifer effect.
1058.399	And he goes on to say,
1058.399	"""The landmark Stanford study"
1060.852	provides a cautionary tale
1060.852	"for all military operations."""
1064.796	If you give people power
1064.796	without oversight,
1067.16	it's a prescription for abuse.
1068.667	They knew that, and let that happen.
1071.837	So another report, an investigative
1071.837	report by General Fay,
1074.941	says the system is guilty.
1076.915	In this report, he says it was
1076.915	the environment that created Abu Ghraib,
1080.402	by leadership failures that contributed
1080.402	to the occurrence of such abuse,
1083.808	and because it remained undiscovered
1085.742	by higher authorities
1085.742	for a long period of time.
1088.006	Those abuses went on for three months.
1089.855	Who was watching the store?
1091.487	The answer is nobody, I think on purpose.
1093.758	He gave the guards permission
1093.758	to do those things,
1096.075	and they knew nobody was ever going
1096.075	to come down to that dungeon.
1099.163	So you need a paradigm shift
1099.163	in all of these areas.
1101.755	The shift is away from the medical model
1101.755	that focuses only on the individual.
1105.456	The shift is toward a public health model
1108.16	that recognizes situational
1108.16	and systemic vectors of disease.
1111.966	Bullying is a disease.
1111.966	Prejudice is a disease.
1114.327	Violence is a disease.
1115.519	Since the Inquisition, we've been dealing
1115.519	with problems at the individual level.
1119.311	It doesn't work.
1120.776	Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says,
1120.776	"""The line between good and evil"
1123.616	cuts through the heart
1123.616	"of every human being."""
1125.76	That means that line is not out there.
1127.596	That's a decision that you have
1127.596	to make, a personal thing.
1130.591	So I want to end very quickly
1130.591	on a positive note.
1133.652	Heroism as the antidote to evil,
1136.136	by promoting the heroic imagination,
1138.055	especially in our kids,
1138.055	in our educational system.
1140.577	We want kids to think,
1140.577	"""I'm a hero in waiting,"
1143.065	waiting for the right
1143.065	situation to come along,
1145.232	and I will act heroically.
1146.799	My whole life, I'm now going
1146.799	to focus away from evil --
1149.501	that I've been in since I was a kid
1149.501	-- to understanding heroes.
1152.478	Banality of heroism.
1153.667	It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.
1155.695	It's the counterpoint
1155.695	"to Hannah Arendt's ""Banality of Evil."""
1158.665	Our traditional societal heroes are wrong,
1158.665	because they are the exceptions.
1162.65	They organize their life around this.
1162.65	That's why we know their names.
1166.009	Our kids' heroes
1166.009	are also wrong models for them,
1168.311	because they have supernatural talents.
1170.279	We want our kids to realize
1170.279	most heroes are everyday people,
1173.264	and the heroic act is unusual.
1175.392	This is Joe Darby.
1176.707	He was the one that stopped
1176.707	those abuses you saw,
1179.017	because when he saw those images,
1180.634	he turned them over
1180.634	to a senior investigating officer.
1183.229	He was a low-level private,
1183.229	and that stopped it.
1185.981	Was he a hero? No.
1187.183	They had to put him in hiding,
1187.183	because people wanted to kill him,
1190.357	and then his mother and his wife.
1192.033	For three years, they were in hiding.
1193.942	This is the woman who stopped
1193.942	the Stanford Prison Study.
1196.652	When I said it got out of control,
1196.652	I was the prison superintendent.
1199.925	I didn't know it was out of control.
1199.925	I was totally indifferent.
1202.948	She saw that madhouse and said,
1204.563	"""You know what, it's terrible"
1204.563	what you're doing to those boys.
1207.492	They're not prisoners nor guards,
1207.492	"they're boys, and you are responsible."""
1211.16	And I ended the study the next day.
1213.699	The good news
1213.699	is I married her the next year.
1215.833	(Laughter)
1218.16	(Applause)
1225.605	I just came to my senses, obviously.
1227.64	So situations have the power
1227.64	to do [three things].
1230.333	But the point is,
1230.333	this is the same situation
1233.138	that can inflame the hostile
1233.138	imagination in some of us,
1236.628	that makes us perpetrators of evil,
1238.389	can inspire the heroic
1238.389	imagination in others.
1240.606	It's the same situation
1240.606	and you're on one side or the other.
1243.744	Most people are guilty
1243.744	of the evil of inaction,
1245.959	"because your mother said, ""Don't get"
1245.959	"involved. Mind your own business."""
1249.331	And you have to say,
1249.331	"""Mama, humanity is my business."""
1251.832	So the psychology of heroism is --
1251.832	we're going to end in a moment --
1255.047	how do we encourage children
1255.047	in new hero courses,
1257.498	that I'm working on with Matt Langdon --
1257.498	he has a hero workshop --
1260.814	to develop this heroic imagination,
1260.814	this self-labeling,
1263.881	"""I am a hero in waiting,"""
1263.881	and teach them skills.
1266.668	To be a hero, you have
1266.668	to learn to be a deviant,
1269.047	because you're always going
1269.047	against the conformity of the group.
1272.697	Heroes are ordinary people whose social
1272.697	actions are extraordinary. Who act.
1276.561	The key to heroism is two things.
1278.336	You have to act
1278.336	when other people are passive.
1280.741	B: You have to act socio-centrically,
1280.741	not egocentrically.
1283.532	And I want to end with a known story
1283.532	about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.
1287.339	Fifty-year-old African-American
1287.339	construction worker standing on a subway.
1291.16	A white guy falls on the tracks.
1292.712	The subway train is coming.
1292.712	There's 75 people there.
1295.196	You know what? They freeze.
1296.716	He's got a reason not to get involved.
1298.606	He's black, the guy's white,
1298.606	and he's got two kids.
1301.047	Instead, he gives his kids to a stranger,
1303.024	jumps on the tracks,
1303.024	puts the guy between the tracks,
1305.525	lays on him, the subway goes over him.
1307.719	Wesley and the guy --
1311.001	The train clearance is 21 inches.
1313.84	A half an inch
1313.84	would have taken his head off.
1316.537	"And he said, ""I did what anyone could do,"""
1316.537	no big deal to jump on the tracks.
1320.63	And the moral imperative
1320.63	"is ""I did what everyone should do."""
1324.302	And so one day,
1324.302	you will be in a new situation.
1327.16	Take path one, you're going
1327.16	to be a perpetrator of evil.
1329.804	Evil, meaning you're going to be
1329.804	Arthur Andersen.
1332.16	You're going to cheat,
1332.16	or you're going to allow bullying.
1334.899	Path two, you become guilty
1334.899	of the evil of passive inaction.
1337.737	Path three, you become a hero.
1339.484	The point is, are we ready to take
1339.484	the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,
1343.926	waiting for the right
1343.926	situation to come along
1346.154	to put heroic imagination into action?
1348.244	Because it may only happen
1348.244	once in your life,
1351.062	and when you pass it by,
1351.062	you'll always know,
1353.229	I could have been a hero
1353.229	and I let it pass me by.
1355.688	So the point is thinking it
1355.688	and then doing it.
1358.559	So I want to thank you. Thank you.
1360.531	Let's oppose the power of evil systems
1360.531	at home and abroad,
1363.557	and let's focus on the positive.
1365.16	Advocate for respect of personal dignity,
1365.16	for justice and peace,
1368.705	which sadly our administration
1368.705	has not been doing.
1371.067	Thanks so much.
1372.341	(Applause)
