15.26	Hi, my name is Marcin --
18.26	farmer, technologist.
20.26	I was born in Poland, now in the U.S.
23.26	I started a group called Open Source Ecology.
26.26	We've identified the 50 most important machines
28.26	that we think it takes for modern life to exist --
31.26	things from tractors,
33.26	bread ovens, circuit makers.
35.26	Then we set out to create
37.26	an open source, DIY, do it yourself version
40.26	that anyone can build and maintain
42.26	at a fraction of the cost.
44.26	We call this the Global Village Construction Set.
46.26	So let me tell you a story.
48.26	So I finished my 20s
50.26	with a Ph.D. in fusion energy,
52.26	and I discovered I was useless.
55.26	I had no practical skills.
57.26	The world presented me with options,
59.26	and I took them.
61.26	I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
63.26	So I started a farm in Missouri
66.26	and learned about the economics of farming.
69.26	I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
72.26	I paid to get it repaired --
74.26	then it broke again.
76.26	Then pretty soon,
78.26	I was broke too.
80.26	I realized
82.26	that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I needed
85.26	to start a sustainable farm and settlement
88.26	just didn't exist yet.
90.26	I needed tools that were robust, modular,
93.26	highly efficient and optimized,
95.26	low-cost,
97.26	made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime,
100.26	not designed for obsolescence.
102.26	I found that I would have to build them myself.
105.26	So I did just that.
108.26	And I tested them.
111.26	And I found that industrial productivity
114.26	can be achieved on a small scale.
117.26	So then I published the 3D designs,
120.26	schematics,
122.26	instructional videos and budgets
125.26	on a wiki.
127.26	Then contributors from all over the world
129.26	began showing up, prototyping new machines
132.26	during dedicated project visits.
134.26	So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines.
137.26	And now the project
139.26	is beginning to grow on its own.
142.26	We know that open source has succeeded
144.26	with tools for managing knowledge and creativity.
147.26	And the same is starting to happen with hardware too.
150.26	We're focusing on hardware
152.26	because it is hardware that can change people's lives
155.26	in such tangible material ways.
158.26	If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing,
161.26	then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.
164.26	That's not only in the developing world.
167.26	Our tools are being made
169.26	for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.
172.26	We've seen lots of excitement from these people,
174.26	who can now start a construction business,
176.26	parts manufacturing,
178.26	organic CSA
180.26	or just selling power back to the grid.
184.26	Our goal is a repository of published designs
186.26	so clear, so complete,
188.26	that a single burned DVD
190.26	is effectively a civilization starter kit.
196.26	I've planted a hundred trees in a day.
199.26	I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day
202.26	from the dirt beneath my feet
206.26	and built a tractor in six days.
209.26	From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.
212.26	If this idea is truly sound,
215.26	then the implications are significant.
218.26	A greater distribution of the means of production,
221.26	environmentally sound supply chains,
224.26	and a newly relevant DIY maker culture
228.26	can hope to transcend
230.26	artificial scarcity.
233.26	We're exploring the limits
235.26	of what we all can do to make a better world
238.26	with open hardware technology.
240.26	Thank you.
242.26	(Applause)
