12.895	TED is 30.
14.543	The world wide web is celebrating this month
17.181	its 25th anniversary.
19.453	So I've got a question for you.
22.142	Let's talk about the journey, mainly about the future.
26.966	Let's talk about the state.
28.681	Let's talk about what sort of a web we want.
30.995	So 25 years ago, then, I was working at CERN.
34.315	I got permission in the end after about a year
36.665	to basically do it as a side project.
39.297	I wrote the code.
40.995	I was I suppose the first user.
43.144	There was a lot of concern
45.687	that people didn't want to pick it up
47.206	because it would be too complicated.
49.03	A lot of persuasion, a lot of wonderful
50.749	collaboration with other people,
52.459	and bit by bit, it worked.
54.888	It took off. It was pretty cool.
56.531	And in fact, a few years later in 2000,
59.748	five percent of the world population
63.95	were using the world wide web.
65.769	In 2007, seven years later, 17 percent.
68.48	In 2008, we formed the World Wide Web Foundation
71.82	partly to look at that
73.394	and worry about that figure.
76.244	And now here we are in 2014,
78.303	and 40 percent of the world
80.537	are using the world wide web, and counting.
84.553	Obviously it's increasing.
86.555	I want you to think about both sides of that.
89.963	Okay, obviously to anybody here at TED,
92.18	the first question you ask is, what can we do
95.163	to get the other 60 percent on board
97.219	as quickly as possible?
98.539	Lots of important things. Obviously
98.539	it's going to be around mobile.
100.854	But also, I want you to think about the 40 percent,
102.834	because if you're sitting there yourself
104.544	sort of with a web-enabled life,
107.17	you don't remember things anymore,
108.466	you just look them up,
110.18	then you may feel that it's been a success
114.263	and we can all sit back.
116.243	But in fact, yeah, it's been a success,
119.326	there's lots of things, Khan Academy
121.272	for crying out loud, there's Wikipedia,
123.561	there's a huge number of free e-books
125.378	that you can read online,
126.784	lots of wonderful things for education,
128.552	things in many areas.
130.276	Online commerce has in some cases
132.678	completely turned upside down the
132.678	way commerce works altogether,
135.469	made types of commerce available
137.024	which weren't available at all before.
139.35	Commerce has been almost universally affected.
142.732	Government, not universally affected,
144.999	but very affected, and on a good day,
147.112	lots of open data, lots of e-government,
150.08	so lots of things which are visible
152.783	happening on the web.
154.411	Also, lots of things which are less visible.
156.522	The healthcare, late at night when they're worried
158.925	about what sort of cancer
160.636	somebody they care about might have,
162.761	when they just talk across the Internet to somebody
167.767	who they care about very much in another country.
172.276	Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there,
176.495	and in fact they've acquired
176.495	a certain amount of privacy.
179.715	So we cannot assume that part of the web,
182.499	part of the deal with the web,
183.59	is when I use the web,
185.026	it's just a transparent, neutral medium.
188.416	I can talk to you over it without worrying
190.952	about what we in fact now know is happening,
193.811	without worrying about the fact
196.261	that not only will surveillance be happening
198.207	but it'll be done by people who may abuse the data.
201.245	So in fact, something we realized,
202.451	we can't just use the web,
203.86	we have to worry about
205.545	what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing,
209.119	is it in fact of a quality that we need?
213.315	We revel in the fact that we
213.315	have this wonderful free speech.
218.264	We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people
221.302	can see our tweets, except when they can't,
224.227	except when actually Twitter
224.227	is blocked from their country,
227.578	or in some way the way we try to express ourselves
230.921	has put some information
230.921	about the state of ourselves,
233.856	the state of the country we live in,
235.219	which isn't available to anybody else.
237.703	So we must protest and make sure
240.684	that censorship is cut down,
242.808	that the web is opened up
244.382	where there is censorship.
246.839	We love the fact that the web is open.
249.549	It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody.
251.754	It doesn't matter who we are.
253.592	And then we join these big
254.929	social networking companies
257.582	which are in fact effectively built as silos,
260.944	so that it's much easier to talk to somebody
262.733	in the same social network
264.567	than it is to talk to somebody in a different one,
266.89	so in fact we're sometimes limiting ourselves.
271.264	And we also have, if you've read
271.264	the book about the filter bubble,
274.19	the filter bubble phenomenon is that
276.158	we love to use machines
277.96	which help us find stuff we like.
280.092	So we love it when we're bathed in
282.434	what things we like to click on,
284.166	and so the machine automatically feeds us
286.326	the stuff that we like and we end up
287.81	with this rose-colored spectacles view of the world
292.071	called a filter bubble.
294.26	So here are some of the things which maybe
296.203	threaten the social web we have.
299.295	What sort of web do you want?
301.224	I want one which is not
301.224	fragmented into lots of pieces,
304.662	as some countries have been suggesting
306.845	they should do in reaction to recent surveillance.
309.945	I want a web which has got, for example,
313.628	is a really good basis for democracy.
316.588	I want a web where I can use healthcare
321.165	with privacy and where there's a lot
322.92	of health data, clinical data is available
325.09	to scientists to do research.
327.02	I want a web where the other 60 percent
330.71	get on board as fast as possible.
333.05	I want a web which is such
333.05	a powerful basis for innovation
337.668	that when something nasty happens,
339.051	some disaster strikes, that we can respond
341.38	by building stuff to respond to it very quickly.
345.16	So this is just some of the things that I want,
348.09	from a big list, obviously it's longer.
350.526	You have your list.
351.767	I want us to use this 25th anniversary
354.541	to think about what sort of a web we want.
357.534	You can go to webat25.org
359.233	and find some links.
360.236	There are lots of sites where people
361.292	have started to put together a Magna Carta,
364.004	a bill of rights for the web.
365.53	How about we do that?
367.043	How about we decide, these are, in a way,
371.67	becoming fundamental rights, the right
371.67	to communicate with whom I want.
375.33	What would be on your list for that Magna Carta?
377.288	Let's crowdsource a Magna Carta
380.156	for the web.
382.398	Let's do that this year.
384.49	Let's use the energy from the 25th anniversary
387.797	to crowdsource a Magna Carta
390.409	to the web. (Applause)
391.891	Thank you. And do me a favor, will you?
396.397	Fight for it for me. Okay? Thanks.
398.963	(Applause)
