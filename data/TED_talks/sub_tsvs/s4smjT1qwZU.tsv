15.619	This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.
19.615	It's a diagram of the visual system.
21.527	And some things look very familiar today.
24.277	Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.
28.644	There's a very large nose
30.764	that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.
34.081	And if we compare this
35.781	to more recent representations of the visual system,
37.855	you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated
40.812	over the intervening thousand years.
42.385	And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,
45.35	rather than just looking at its overall shape.
47.831	Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works
51.81	and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
54.989	You really would be kind of out of luck.
57.385	You want to be able to open it up, crack it open,
59.427	look at the wiring inside.
61.271	And up until a little more than a century ago,
63.135	nobody was able to do that with the brain.
65.135	Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
67.015	And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull
69.967	and you cut a thin slice of it,
71.656	put it under even a very powerful microscope,
74.154	there's nothing there.
75.335	It's gray, formless.
76.948	There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.
79.552	And this all changed in the late 19th century.
82.406	Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed
86.281	and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.
89.093	The computer was cracked open.
91.106	So what really launched modern neuroscience
93.962	was a stain called the Golgi stain.
95.927	And it works in a very particular way.
97.808	Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,
100.918	it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
103.95	It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
107.292	If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
109.964	So somehow it shows what's there.
112.01	Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,
114.677	who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,
117.522	applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,
121.419	and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.
125.177	And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,
127.791	this is the transistor.
129.802	And very quickly Cajal realized
131.877	that neurons don't operate alone,
134.214	but rather make connections with others
136.052	that form circuits just like in a computer.
138.558	Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,
141.949	they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.
144.716	And there's several ways of doing this.
145.866	But one of the most popular ones
147.593	involves green fluorescent protein.
149.685	Now green fluorescent protein,
151.344	which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,
154.489	is very useful.
155.727	Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein
158.365	and deliver it to a cell,
160.04	that cell will glow green --
161.787	or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,
165.533	you get a cell to glow many different colors.
167.197	And so coming back to the brain,
168.718	"this is from a genetically engineered mouse called ""Brainbow."""
172.518	And it's so called, of course,
174.068	because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
177.68	Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify
181.131	individual molecular components of neurons, molecules,
184.175	rather than the entire cell.
185.973	And there's several ways of doing this,
187.679	but one of the most popular ones
189.148	involves using antibodies.
191.343	And you're familiar, of course,
192.68	with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.
195.631	But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system
198.049	because they can recognize specific molecules,
200.599	like, for example, the coat protein
202.718	of a virus that's invading the body.
205.106	And researchers have used this fact
207.151	in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,
211.476	recognize specific substructures of the cell
214.116	and identify them individually.
216.36	And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,
219.385	but they're also very powerful.
221.291	They have great explanatory power.
222.927	This, for example, is an antibody staining
225.017	against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.
228.537	And you've heard of serotonin, of course,
230.218	in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.
233.045	You've heard of SSRIs,
234.453	which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.
237.35	And in order to understand how serotonin works,
240.24	it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.
243.316	And antibody stainings like this one
244.912	can be used to understand that sort of question.
248.458	I'd like to leave you with the following thought:
251.016	Green fluorescent protein and antibodies
253.626	are both totally natural products at the get-go.
256.633	They were evolved by nature
259.412	in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,
261.979	or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.
266.362	And only much later did scientists come onto the scene
269.379	"and say, ""Hey, these are tools,"
271.402	these are functions that we could use
273.515	"in our own research tool palette."""
275.523	And instead of applying feeble human minds
279.151	to designing these tools from scratch,
281.035	there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature
283.939	developed and refined steadily for millions of years
287.175	by the greatest engineer of all.
288.875	Thank you.
290.137	(Applause)
