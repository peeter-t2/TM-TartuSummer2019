15.26	Every year in the United States alone,
18.73	2,077,000 couples make
18.73	a legal and spiritual decision
25.246	to spend the rest
25.246	of their lives together --
29.142	(Laughter)
30.316	And not to have sex with anyone else.
34.76	Ever.
36.4	He buys a ring, she buys a dress.
40.059	They go shopping for all sorts of things.
43.5	She takes him to Arthur Murray
43.5	for ballroom-dancing lessons.
48.948	And the big day comes.
50.504	And they'll stand before God and family
53.428	and some guy her dad
53.428	once did business with,
56.392	and they'll vow that nothing --
59.001	not abject poverty,
61.305	not life-threatening illness,
63.453	not complete and utter misery --
66.889	will ever put the tiniest damper
66.889	on their eternal love and devotion.
72.243	(Laughter)
74.015	These optimistic young bastards
74.015	promise to honor and cherish each other
78.325	through hot flashes and midlife crises
82.152	and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,
85.616	until that far-off day, when one of them
85.616	is finally able to rest in peace.
92.675	(Laughter)
93.849	You know, because they can't hear
93.849	the snoring anymore.
96.787	And then they'll get stupid drunk
98.615	and smash cake in each other's faces
98.615	and do the Macarena.
101.743	And we'll be there,
103.37	showering them with towels and toasters
103.37	and drinking their free booze
107.804	and throwing birdseed at them
107.804	every single time ...
111.978	even though we know, statistically,
115.688	half of them will be divorced
115.688	within a decade.
118.807	(Laughter)
121.386	Of course, the other half won't, right?
124.093	They'll keep forgetting anniversaries
127.092	and arguing about where to spend holidays
129.604	and debating --
130.791	(Laughter)
131.883	Which way the toilet paper
131.883	should come off of the roll.
136.047	And some of them will even still
136.047	be enjoying each other's company
141.561	when neither of them can chew
141.561	solid food anymore.
145.009	And researchers want to know why.
147.929	I mean, look -- it doesn't take
147.929	a double-blind, placebo-controlled study
151.461	to figure out what makes
151.461	a marriage not work:
154.42	disrespect, boredom,
157.663	too much time on Facebook,
159.413	having sex with other people.
161.453	But you can have the exact
161.453	opposite of all of those things --
164.987	respect, excitement,
167.755	a broken Internet connection,
169.95	mind-numbing monogamy --
173.81	and the thing still can go
173.81	to hell in a handbasket.
176.983	So, what's going on when it doesn't?
180.47	What do the folks who make it all the way
180.47	to side-by-side burial plots
184.514	have in common?
186.101	What are they doing right?
187.835	What can we learn from them?
190.759	And if you're still happily sleeping solo,
194.542	why should you stop what you're doing
194.542	and make it your life's work
198.978	to find that one special person
201.695	that you can annoy
201.695	for the rest of your life?
204.829	Well, researchers spend
204.829	billions of your tax dollars
208.073	trying to figure that out.
209.933	They stalk blissful couples
211.924	and study their every move and mannerism.
215.15	And they try to pinpoint
215.15	what it is that sets them apart
218.962	from their miserable
218.962	neighbors and friends.
221.229	And it turns out, the success stories
221.229	share a few similarities,
227.062	beyond that they don't have sex
227.062	with other people.
230.188	For instance, in the happiest marriages,
233.237	the wife is thinner and better-looking
235.099	than the husband.
236.289	(Laughter)
237.403	Obvious. Right?
239.644	It's obvious that this leads
239.644	to marital bliss,
242.18	because women -- we care a great deal
242.18	about being thin and good-looking,
245.857	whereas men mostly care about sex,
249.382	ideally, with women who are thinner
249.382	and better looking than they are.
253.501	The beauty of this research, though,
255.272	is that no one is suggesting
255.272	that women have to be thin to be happy.
259.549	We just have to be thinner
259.549	than our partners.
261.983	So instead of all that laborious
261.983	dieting and exercising,
266.507	we just need to wait
266.507	for them to get fat --
268.738	(Laughter)
270.034	Maybe bake a few pies.
271.932	This is good information to have,
271.932	and it's not that complicated.
275.309	(Laughter)
276.359	Research also suggests
278.495	that the happiest couples are the ones
278.495	that focus on the positives.
283.71	For example: the happy wife.
285.298	Instead of pointing out
285.298	her husband's growing gut
287.664	or suggesting he go for a run,
290.249	she might say,
291.618	"""Wow, honey, thank you"
291.618	for going out of your way
294.926	"to make me relatively thinner."""
296.817	(Laughter)
297.845	These are couples
297.845	who can find good in any situation.
301.054	"""Yeah, it was devastating"
301.054	when we lost everything in that fire.
306.306	But it's kind of nice sleeping
306.306	out here under the stars.
309.129	And it's a good thing you've got
309.129	"all that body fat to keep us warm."""
312.355	(Laughter)
313.582	One of my favorite studies found
315.504	that the more willing
315.504	a husband is to do housework,
318.655	the more attractive
318.655	his wife will find him.
322.422	Because we needed a study to tell us this.
324.683	(Laughter)
325.979	But here's what's going on here.
327.539	The more attractive she finds him,
327.539	the more sex they have;
330.703	the more sex they have,
330.703	the nicer he is to her;
333.149	the nicer he is to her,
334.873	the less she nags him
334.873	about leaving wet towels on the bed,
337.707	and ultimately,
337.707	they live happily ever after.
340.809	In other words, men,
340.809	you might want to pick it up a notch
344.219	in the domestic department.
346.86	Here's an interesting one.
348.625	One study found that people
348.625	who smile in childhood photographs
353.706	are less likely to get a divorce.
356.844	This is an actual study,
356.844	and let me clarify:
359.709	the researchers were not looking
359.709	at documented self-reports
363.014	of childhood happiness,
364.318	or even studying old journals.
366.37	The data were based entirely
366.37	on whether people looked happy
370.965	in these early pictures.
373.046	Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
373.046	but when I was a kid,
377.571	your parents took pictures
377.571	with a special kind of camera
380.309	"that held something called ""film."""
383.06	And, by God, film was expensive.
386.764	They didn't take 300 shots of you
386.764	in that rapid-fire digital video mode
391.568	and then pick out the nicest,
391.568	smiliest one for the Christmas card.
396.187	Oh, no.
398.394	They dressed you up, they lined you up,
400.293	and you smiled for the fucking camera
400.293	like they told you to
403.114	or you could kiss
403.114	your birthday party goodbye.
405.323	But still, I have a huge pile
405.323	of fake happy childhood pictures
408.891	and I'm glad they make me less likely
408.891	than some people to get a divorce.
413.615	So, what else can you do
413.615	to safeguard your marriage?
417.783	Do not win an Oscar for best actress.
421.054	(Laughter)
422.895	I'm serious.
424.113	Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,
424.113	Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,
427.179	Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon --
429.389	all of them single,
429.389	soon after taking home that statue.
432.945	They actually call it the Oscar curse.
435.335	It is the marriage kiss of death
435.335	and something that should be avoided.
439.978	And it's not just successfully
439.978	starring in films that's dangerous.
444.024	It turns out, merely watching
444.024	a romantic comedy
447.955	causes relationship
447.955	satisfaction to plummet.
451.098	(Laughter)
452.572	Apparently, the bitter realization
452.572	that maybe it could happen to us,
458.465	but it obviously hasn't
458.465	and it probably never will,
461.101	makes our lives seem
461.101	unbearably grim in comparison.
465.077	And theoretically,
466.522	I suppose if we opt for a film
466.522	where someone gets brutally murdered
469.811	or dies in a fiery car crash,
472.233	we are more likely to walk out
472.233	of that theater
474.401	feeling like we've got it pretty good.
476.363	(Laughter)
478.432	Drinking alcohol, it seems,
478.432	is bad for your marriage.
483.702	Yeah.
485.616	I can't tell you anymore about that one
487.508	because I stopped reading it
487.508	at the headline.
489.647	But here's a scary one:
489.647	divorce is contagious.
493.931	That's right, when you have
493.931	a close couple friend split up,
496.769	it increases your chances
496.769	of getting a divorce by 75 percent.
502.283	Now, I have to say,
502.283	I don't get this one at all.
505.473	My husband and I have watched
505.473	quite a few friends divide their assets
510.157	and then struggle
510.157	with being our age and single
514.795	in an age of sexting
514.795	and Viagra and eHarmony.
519.622	And I'm thinking they've done
519.622	more for my marriage
522.044	than a lifetime of therapy ever could.
525.054	So now you may be wondering:
525.054	Why does anyone get married ever?
530.738	Well, the US federal government
530.738	counts more than a thousand legal benefits
535.913	to being someone's spouse.
537.765	A list that includes
537.765	visitation rights in jail,
540.467	but hopefully, you'll never need that one.
542.872	But beyond the profound federal perks,
547.12	married people make more money.
549.527	We're healthier,
549.527	physically and emotionally.
553.658	We produce happier, more stable
553.658	and more successful kids.
559.166	We have more sex than our supposedly
559.166	swinging single friends,
563.305	believe it or not.
565.043	We even live longer,
566.26	which is a pretty compelling argument
566.26	for marrying someone you like a lot
571.439	in the first place.
572.687	(Laughter)
573.72	Now, if you're not currently experiencing
573.72	the joy of the joint tax return,
579.724	I can't tell you how to find
579.724	a chore-loving person
583.242	of the approximately ideal size
583.242	and attractiveness,
585.669	who prefers horror movies
586.971	and doesn't have a lot of friends
586.971	hovering on the brink of divorce,
590.16	but I can only encourage you to try,
592.26	because the benefits, as I've pointed out,
595.128	are significant.
597.188	The bottom line is: whether you're in it
597.188	or you're searching for it,
600.458	I believe marriage is an institution
600.458	worth pursuing and protecting.
605.708	So I hope you'll use the information
605.708	I've given you today
608.417	to weigh your personal strengths
608.417	against your own risk factors.
611.955	For instance, in my marriage,
611.955	I'd say I'm doing OK.
616.589	One the one hand,
618.01	I have a husband who's annoyingly lean
618.01	and incredibly handsome.
622.477	So I'm obviously going
622.477	to need fatten him up.
625.382	And like I said, we have
625.382	those divorced friends
628.133	who may secretly or subconsciously
628.133	be trying to break us up.
631.986	So we have to keep an eye on that.
635.461	And we do like a cocktail or two.
638.108	On the other hand,
639.521	I have the fake happy picture thing.
641.788	And also, my husband does
641.788	a lot around the house,
645.427	and would happily never see
645.427	another romantic comedy
649.046	as long as he lives.
650.316	So I've got all those things going for me.
652.918	But just in case,
654.162	I plan to work extra hard
654.162	to not win an Oscar anytime soon.
659.896	And for the good of your relationships,
661.988	I would encourage you to do the same.
664.871	I'll see you at the bar.
666.161	(Laughter)
667.356	(Applause)
