25	I'm going to take you
25	on a journey very quickly.
27.278	To explain the wish, I'm going
27.278	to have to take you somewhere
30.151	where many people haven't been,
30.151	and that's around the world.
33.004	When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr
33.004	and myself started an organization
37.137	to get architects and designers
37.137	involved in humanitarian work,
40.801	not only about responding
40.801	to natural disasters,
43.468	but involved in systemic issues.
46.436	We believe that where the resources
46.436	and expertise are scarce,
51.039	innovative, sustainable design can really
51.039	make a difference in people's lives.
57.118	So I started my life as an architect,
57.118	or training as an architect,
62.043	and I was always interested
62.043	in socially responsible design,
65.484	and how you can really make an impact.
67.4	But when I went to architecture school,
69.37	it seemed that I was
69.37	a black sheep in the family.
72.345	Many architects seemed to think
72.345	that when you design,
75.036	you design a jewel, and it's a jewel
75.036	that you try and crave for;
78.841	whereas I felt that when you design,
80.802	you either improve
80.802	or you create a detriment
83.481	to the community
83.481	in which you're designing.
85.568	So you're not just doing
85.568	a building for the residents
88.1	or for the people who are going to use it,
88.1	but for the community as a whole.
91.703	And in 1999, we started by responding
91.703	to the issue of the housing crisis
98.153	for returning refugees in Kosovo.
100.188	And I didn't know what I was doing --
100.188	like I said, mid-20s --
103.824	and I'm the Internet generation,
103.824	so we started a website.
108.397	We put a call out there,
108.397	and to my surprise, in a couple of months,
111.91	we had hundreds of entries
111.91	from around the world.
115.132	That led to a number
115.132	of prototypes being built
117.329	and really experimenting with some ideas.
120.272	Two years later we started doing a project
122.427	on developing mobile health clinics
122.427	in sub-Saharan Africa,
126.085	responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
130.418	That led to 550 entries from 53 countries.
136.826	We also have designers
136.826	from around the world that participate.
141.6	And we had an exhibit
141.6	of work that followed that.
147.708	We started responding to natural disasters
149.753	and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,
152.398	also following up on our work in Africa.
155.122	Working within the United States --
156.994	most people look at poverty
156.994	and they see the face of a foreigner.
160.089	But I live in Bozeman, Montana --
162.187	go up to the north plains
162.187	on the reservations,
164.429	or go down to Alabama
164.429	or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,
167.878	and I could have shown you
167.878	places that have far worse conditions
170.934	than many developing countries
170.934	that I've been to.
173.264	So we got involved in and worked
173.264	in inner cities and elsewhere;
176.776	and also, I will go into
176.776	some more projects.
183.135	I think we can pretty much assume
183.135	that 2005 was a horrific year
187.912	when it comes to natural disasters.
189.603	And because of the Internet,
191.117	and because of connections
191.117	to blogs and so forth,
194.53	within literally hours of the tsunami,
194.53	we were already raising funds,
199.006	getting involved, working
199.006	with people on the ground.
202.606	We run from a couple of laptops,
202.606	and in the first couple of days,
205.812	I had 4,000 emails
205.812	from people needing help.
208.915	So we began to get involved
208.915	in projects there,
211.812	and I'll talk about some others.
213.45	And then of course, this year
213.45	we've been responding to Katrina,
216.445	as well as following up
216.445	on our reconstruction work.
218.913	So this is a brief overview.
221.6	In 2004, I really couldn't manage
221.6	the number of people who wanted to help,
226.041	or the number of requests
226.041	that I was getting.
228.17	It was all coming
228.17	into my laptop and cell phone.
230.725	So we decided to embrace
230.725	an open-source model of business --
236.122	so that anyone, anywhere in the world,
236.122	could start a local chapter,
239.313	and they can get involved
239.313	in local problems.
241.403	Because I believe there
241.403	is no such thing as Utopia.
243.838	All problems are local.
243.838	All solutions are local.
246.434	So that means, you know,
246.434	somebody who's based in Mississippi
251.092	knows more about Mississippi than I do.
253.469	So what happened is, we used Meetup
253.469	and all these other Internet tools,
259.6	and we ended up having
263.915	thousands of architects in 104 countries.
268.008	So the bullet point --
268.008	sorry, I never do a suit,
271.473	so I knew that I was going
271.473	to take this off.
273.892	OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.
278.203	This isn't just about nonprofit.
280.25	What it showed me is that
280.25	there's a grassroots movement going on,
283.448	of socially responsible designers
283.448	who really believe
286.046	that this world has got a lot smaller,
286.046	and that we have the opportunity --
289.982	not the responsibility,
289.982	but the opportunity --
292.162	to really get involved in making change.
296.665	(Laughter)
301.941	(Laughter)
305.989	I'm adding that to my time.
307.812	(Laughter)
310.637	So what you don't know is,
312.6	we've got these thousands of designers
312.6	working around the world,
315.648	connected basically by a website,
315.648	and we have a staff of three.
319.504	The fact that nobody told us
319.504	we couldn't do it, we did it.
323.942	And so there's something
323.942	to be said about naïveté.
326.314	So seven years later, we've developed
328.235	so that we've got advocacy,
328.235	instigation and implementation.
331.673	We advocate for good design,
331.673	not only through student workshops
335.342	and lectures and public forums, op-eds;
337.688	we have a book on humanitarian work;
339.933	but also disaster mitigation
339.933	and dealing with public policy.
343.14	We can talk about FEMA,
343.14	but that's another talk.
347.036	Instigation, developing ideas
347.036	with communities and NGOs,
350.42	doing open-source design competitions.
353.272	Referring, matchmaking with communities.
355.804	And then implementing -- actually
355.804	going out there and doing the work,
359.135	because when you invent,
359.135	it's never a reality until it's built.
365.338	So it's really important
365.338	that if we're designing
368.103	and trying to create change,
368.103	we build that change.
370.801	So here's a select number of projects.
374.464	Kosovo.
376.67	This is Kosovo in '99.
378.707	We did an open design
378.707	competition, like I said.
381.581	It led to a whole variety of ideas.
383.999	And this wasn't about emergency shelter,
385.941	but transitional shelter
385.941	that would last five to 10 years,
389.487	that would be placed next to the land
389.487	the resident lived in,
393.52	and that they would rebuild
393.52	their own home.
395.671	This wasn't imposing
395.671	an architecture on a community;
398.373	this was giving them
398.373	the tools and the space
401.519	to allow them to rebuild and regrow
401.519	the way they want to.
406.287	We had from the sublime
406.287	to the ridiculous, but they worked.
409.231	This is an inflatable hemp house.
409.231	It was built; it works.
414.6	This is a shipping container.
417.68	Built and works.
419.364	And a whole variety of ideas
420.738	that not only dealt with
420.738	architectural building,
424.269	but also the issues of governance,
425.967	and the idea of creating communities
425.967	through complex networks.
429.402	So we've engaged not just designers,
431.248	but also a whole variety
431.248	of technology-based professionals.
436.797	Using rubble from destroyed homes
436.797	to create new homes.
440.428	Using straw bale construction,
440.428	creating heat walls.
446.734	And then something remarkable
446.734	happened in '99.
448.926	We went to Africa originally
448.926	to look at the housing issue.
453.048	Within three days, we realized
453.048	the problem was not housing;
455.859	it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.
458.97	And it wasn't doctors telling us this;
460.847	it was actual villagers
460.847	that we were staying with.
463.871	And so we came up with the bright idea
466.507	that instead of getting people to walk
470.726	you get the doctors to the people.
472.589	And we started engaging
472.589	the medical community,
475.481	and you know, we thought
475.481	we were real bright sparks --
478.608	"""We've come up with this great idea:"
480.378	mobile health clinics, widely distributed
480.378	"throughout sub-Saharan Africa."""
485.349	And the medical community there said,
487.817	"""We've said this for the last decade."
490.307	We know this. We just don't know
490.307	"how to show this."""
493.409	So in a way, we had taken pre-existing
493.409	needs and shown solutions.
499.177	And so again, we had a whole variety
499.177	of ideas that came in.
504.173	This one I personally love,
506.04	because the idea is that architecture
506.04	is not just about solutions,
509.365	but about raising awareness.
511.068	This is a kenaf clinic.
513.506	You get seed and you grow it
513.506	in a plot of land,
516.6	and it grows 14 feet in a month.
520.293	And on the fourth week, the doctors
520.293	come and they mow out an area,
523.469	put a tensile structure on the top,
525.572	and when the doctors
525.572	have finished treating
528.268	and seeing patients and villagers,
532.013	you cut down the clinic and you eat it.
533.909	It's an eat-your-own-clinic.
535.6	So it's dealing with the fact
535.6	that if you have AIDS,
538.978	you also need to have nutrition rates,
540.946	and the idea of nutrition is as important
543.826	as getting antiretrovirals out there.
545.684	So you know, this is a serious solution.
549.043	This one I love.
550.223	The idea is it's not just a clinic,
550.223	it's a community center.
553.072	This looked at setting up trade routes
555.119	and economic engines within the community,
557.208	so it can be a self-sustaining project.
559.446	Every one of these projects
559.446	is sustainable.
562.176	That's not because
562.176	I'm a tree-hugging green person.
565.504	It's because when you live
565.504	on four dollars a day,
567.852	you're living on survival
567.852	and you have to be sustainable.
571.227	You have to know where
571.227	your energy is coming from,
573.601	you have to know where
573.601	your resource is coming from,
576.077	and you have to keep the maintenance down.
578.115	So this is about getting
578.115	an economic engine,
580.227	and then at night,
580.227	it turns into a movie theater.
582.544	So it's not an AIDS clinic.
582.544	It's a community center.
587.695	So you can see ideas.
589.909	And these ideas developed into prototypes,
592.6	and they were eventually built.
594.415	And currently, as of this year,
595.946	there are clinics rolling out
595.946	in Nigeria and Kenya.
601.976	From that, we also developed Siyathemba.
605.563	The community came to us and said,
607.248	"""The problem is that the girls"
607.248	"don't have education."""
610.295	And we're working in an area
611.669	where young women
611.669	between the ages of 16 and 24
613.922	have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.
617.317	And that's not
617.317	because they're promiscuous,
620.103	it's because there's no knowledge.
621.777	And so we decided to look
621.777	at the idea of sports,
624.8	and create a youth sports center
626.666	that doubled as an HIV/AIDS
626.666	outreach center,
629.488	and the coaches of the girls' team
629.488	were also trained doctors.
633.345	So that there would be a very slow way
633.345	of developing confidence in health care.
640.514	And we picked nine finalists,
642.983	and then those nine finalists were
642.983	distributed throughout the entire region,
646.816	and then the community
646.816	picked their design.
648.967	They said, this is our design,
650.919	because it's not only
650.919	about engaging a community;
653.243	it's about empowering a community,
654.961	and about getting them to be
654.961	a part of the rebuilding process.
659.738	So, the winning design is here.
663.6	And then, of course,
663.6	we actually go and work
665.687	with the community and the clients.
667.394	So this is the designer.
668.616	He's out there working
668.616	with the first ever women's soccer team
671.593	in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.
674.871	And they can tell it better.
678.014	(A cappella singing
678.014	in a South African language)
699.505	Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.
701.514	I work at the Africa Centre,
701.514	I'm an IT user consultant.
704.484	I'm also the national football player
704.484	for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.
708.992	And I also play in the Vodacom League,
708.992	for the team called Tembisa,
715.751	which has now changed to Siyathemba.
719.061	This is our home ground.
721.712	Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that
721.712	later because I'm running out of time.
725.475	I can see Chris looking at me slyly.
727.82	This was a connection,
727.82	just a meeting with somebody
730.781	who wanted to develop Africa's first
730.781	telemedicine center, in Tanzania.
735.553	And we met, literally,
735.553	a couple of months ago.
737.815	We've already developed a design.
739.426	The team is over there,
739.426	working in partnership.
741.657	This was a matchmaking,
741.657	thanks to a couple of TEDsters --
744.965	Sun [Microsystems],
744.965	Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,
748.539	who connected me
748.539	with this amazing African woman.
750.922	And we start construction in June,
750.922	and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.
754.466	So when you come to TEDGlobal,
754.466	you can check it out.
757.537	But what we're known probably most for
757.537	is dealing with disasters and development,
761.587	and we've been involved
761.587	in a lot of issues,
763.65	such as the tsunami
763.65	and also things like Hurricane Katrina.
769.861	This is a 370-dollar shelter
769.861	that can be easily assembled.
777.904	This is a community-designed
777.904	community center.
782.904	And what that means is we actually
782.904	live and work with the community,
786.824	and they're part of the design process.
791.296	The kids actually get
791.296	involved in mapping out
793.858	where the community center should be.
796.932	And then eventually, the community,
796.932	through skills training,
800.423	end up building the building with us.
802.984	Here is another school.
805.096	This is what the UN gave these guys
805.096	for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.
810.136	This was in August.
811.415	This was the replacement;
811.415	that's supposed to last for two years.
814.463	When the rain comes down,
814.463	you can't hear a thing,
816.789	and in the summer,
816.789	it's about 140 degrees inside.
819.127	So we said, if the rain's coming
819.127	down, let's get fresh water.
822.6	So every one of our schools
822.6	has a rainwater collection system.
825.654	Very low cost: three classrooms
825.654	and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.
832.18	This was raised by hot chocolate
832.18	sales in Atlanta.
837.311	It's built by the parents of the kids.
839.26	The kids are out there on-site,
839.26	building the buildings.
841.911	And it opened a couple of weeks ago,
843.696	and there's 600 kids
843.696	that are now using the schools.
846.299	(Applause)
853.127	So, disaster hits home.
856.09	We see the bad stories
856.09	on CNN and Fox and all that,
860.843	but we don't see the good stories.
862.651	Here is a community that got together,
862.651	"and they said ""no"" to waiting."
866.794	They formed a partnership,
866.794	a diverse partnership of players,
870.064	to actually map out East Biloxi,
872.199	to figure out who's getting involved.
874.087	We've had over 1,500 volunteers
874.087	rebuilding, rehabbing homes.
878.6	Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,
880.809	not waiting for them to dictate
880.809	to us how you should rebuild.
884.658	Working with residents,
885.921	getting them out of their homes,
885.921	so they don't get ill.
889.36	This is what they're
889.36	cleaning up on their own.
892.983	Designing housing.
894.16	This house is going in
894.16	in a couple of weeks.
896.301	This is a rehabbed home,
896.301	done in four days.
899.433	This is a utility room
899.433	for a woman who is on a walker.
903.6	She's 70 years old.
903.6	This is what FEMA gave her.
910	We put together, very quickly, a washroom.
912.88	It's built, it's running and she just
912.88	started a business today,
915.897	where she's washing
915.897	other people's clothes.
917.944	These are the Calhouns.
921.6	They're photographers who had documented
921.6	the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.
925.941	That was their home,
925.941	and these are the photographs they took.
928.89	And we're helping, working with them
928.89	to create a new building.
932.533	Projects we've done.
934.183	Projects we've been a part of, support.
936.98	Why don't aid agencies do this?
940.716	This is the UN tent.
943.406	This is the new UN tent,
943.406	just introduced this year.
946.351	Quick to assemble.
947.854	It's got a flap -- that's the invention.
951.426	It took 20 years to design this
951.426	and get it implemented in the field.
955.844	I was 12 years old.
958.768	There's a problem here.
961.728	Luckily, we're not alone.
963.712	There are hundreds and hundreds
963.712	and hundreds and hundreds
966.6	and hundreds of architects
966.6	and designers and inventors
970.6	around the world that are getting
970.6	involved in humanitarian work.
976.234	More hemp houses -- it's a theme
976.234	in Japan, apparently.
979.298	I'm not sure what they're smoking.
980.957	(Laughter)
984.671	This is a Grip Clip,
984.671	designed by somebody who said,
987.402	"""All you need is some way"
987.402	to attach membrane structures
990.433	"to physical support beams."""
995.942	This guy designed for NASA,
995.942	is now doing housing.
1001.314	I'm going to whip through this quickly,
1003.243	because I know I've got
1003.243	only a couple of minutes.
1007.165	So this is all done in the last two years.
1009.334	I showed you something
1009.334	that took 20 years to do.
1011.985	And this is just a selection of things
1014.094	that were built
1014.094	in the last couple of years.
1017.217	From Brazil to India,
1020.167	Mexico,
1022.42	Alabama,
1026.326	China,
1028.825	Israel,
1030.003	Palestine,
1031.823	Vietnam.
1033.306	The average age of a designer
1033.306	who gets involved in this project is 32 --
1037.481	that's how old I am.
1038.776	So it's a young --
1041.949	I just have to stop here,
1041.949	because Arup is in the room,
1044.621	and this is the best-designed
1044.621	toilet in the world.
1047.002	If you're ever, ever in India,
1047.002	go use this toilet.
1050.073	(Laughter)
1051.167	Chris Luebkeman will tell you why.
1053.6	I'm sure that's how he wanted
1053.6	to spend the party.
1061.548	But the future is not going to be
1061.548	the sky-scraping cities of New York,
1064.882	but this.
1066.057	And when you look at this, you see crisis.
1068.167	What I see is many, many inventors.
1071.469	One billion people live in abject poverty.
1073.628	We hear about them all the time.
1075.296	Four billion live in growing
1075.296	but fragile economies.
1079.68	One in seven live
1079.68	in unplanned settlements.
1082.462	If we do nothing about the housing crisis
1082.462	that's about to happen,
1085.636	in 20 years, one in three people
1085.636	will live in an unplanned settlement
1089.215	or a refugee camp.
1090.502	Look left, look right:
1090.502	one of you will be there.
1094.08	How do we improve the living standards
1094.08	of five billion people?
1097.866	With 10 million solutions.
1100.176	So I wish to develop a community
1101.903	that actively embraces
1101.903	innovative and sustainable design
1105.5	to improve the living
1105.5	conditions for everyone.
1108.497	Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --
1108.497	that's your wish?
1110.839	CS: That's my wish.
1112.014	CA: That's his wish!
1113.189	(Applause)
1126.303	CS: We started Architecture for Humanity
1126.303	with 700 dollars and a website.
1130.707	So Chris somehow decided
1130.707	to give me 100,000.
1134.783	So why not this many people?
1137.983	Open-source architecture is the way to go.
1140.452	You have a diverse community
1140.452	of participants --
1143.563	and we're not just talking
1143.563	about inventors and designers,
1146.46	but we're talking about the funding model.
1148.603	My role is not as a designer;
1150.405	it's as a conduit between the design world
1150.405	and the humanitarian world.
1153.914	And what we need is something
1153.914	that replicates me globally,
1158.692	because I haven't slept in seven years.
1161.06	(Laughter)
1163.6	Secondly, what will this thing be?
1166.453	Designers want to respond
1166.453	to issues of humanitarian crisis,
1170.357	but they don't want
1170.357	some company in the West
1173.332	taking their idea
1173.332	and basically profiting from it.
1176.007	So Creative Commons has developed
1176.007	the Developing Nations license.
1180.18	And what that means
1180.18	is that a designer can --
1182.594	The Siyathemba project I showed
1184.451	was the first ever building to have
1184.451	a Creative Commons license on it.
1188.443	As soon as that is built, anyone
1188.443	in Africa or any developing nation
1193.6	can take the construction documents
1193.6	and replicate it for free.
1198.657	(Applause)
1203.233	So why not allow designers
1203.233	the opportunity to do this,
1206.176	but still protect their rights here?
1208.478	We want to have a community
1208.478	where you can upload ideas,
1212.507	and those ideas can be tested
1212.507	in an earthquake, in flood,
1216.731	in all sorts of austere environments.
1219.075	The reason that's important
1220.836	is I don't want to wait
1220.836	for the next Katrina
1222.917	to find out if my house works.
1225.672	That's too late, we need to do it now.
1228.172	So doing that globally --
1229.53	and I want this whole thing
1229.53	to work multi-lingually.
1235.044	When you look at the face of an architect,
1235.044	most people think a gray-haired white guy.
1239.151	I don't see that;
1239.151	I see the face of the world.
1241.89	So I want everyone
1241.89	from all over the planet
1243.974	to be able to be a part
1243.974	of this design and development.
1247.942	The idea of needs-based competitions --
1250.015	XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,
1250.015	if you want to call it that.
1254.749	We also want to look
1254.749	at ways of matchmaking
1257.067	and putting funding partners together,
1259.208	and the idea of integrating
1259.208	manufacturers --
1261.574	fab labs in every country.
1263.193	When I hear about the $100 laptop
1263.193	and it's going to educate every child --
1267.032	educate every designer in the world.
1269.057	Put one in every favela,
1269.057	every slum settlement.
1273.591	Because you know what?
1273.591	Innovation will happen.
1275.853	And I need to know that.
1275.853	It's called the leap-back.
1278.259	We talk about leapfrog technologies.
1280.413	I write with Worldchanging,
1281.818	and the one thing
1281.818	we've been talking about is,
1283.995	I learn more on the ground
1283.995	than I've ever learned here.
1286.606	So let's take those ideas,
1286.606	adapt them, and we can use them.
1292.428	These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;
1295.873	they should have
1295.873	the potential for evolution;
1299.634	they should be developed
1299.634	by every nation in the world
1302.154	and useful for every nation in the world.
1304.837	What will it take?
1306.43	There should be a sheet.
1307.628	I don't have time to read this,
1307.628	because I'm going to be yanked off.
1311.16	CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.
1313.454	CS: Well, what will it take?
1313.454	You guys are smart.
1317.094	So it's going to take a lot
1317.094	of computing power,
1319.982	because I want the idea
1319.982	that any laptop anywhere in the world
1323.105	can plug into the system
1324.5	and be able to not only participate
1324.5	in developing these designs,
1328.086	but utilize the designs.
1329.865	Also, a process of reviewing the designs.
1333.646	I want every Arup engineer
1333.646	in the world to check and make sure
1337.082	that we're doing stuff that's standing,
1338.975	because those guys
1338.975	are the best in the world.
1341.14	Plug.
1342.909	And so, you know, I want these --
1346.49	I just should note: I have two laptops
1346.49	and one of them is there,
1350.268	and that has 3000 designs on it.
1352.775	If I drop that laptop ...
1355.752	What happens?
1357.226	So it's important to have
1357.226	these proven ideas put up there,
1360.218	easy to use, easy to get ahold of.
1366.044	"My mom once said, ""There's nothing worse"
1366.044	"than being all mouth and no trousers."""
1369.843	(Laughter)
1371.374	I'm fed up of talking about making change.
1374.549	You only make it by doing it.
1376.843	We've changed FEMA guidelines;
1376.843	we've changed public policy;
1380.447	we've changed international response --
1380.447	based on building things.
1384.885	So for me, it's important that we create
1384.885	a real conduit for innovation,
1389.258	and that it's free innovation.
1390.926	Think of free culture --
1390.926	this is free innovation.
1395.858	Somebody said this a couple of years back.
1400.138	I will give points for those who know it.
1402.299	But I think the man was maybe
1408.584	So let's do it.
1410.833	Thank you.
1412.01	(Applause)
