15.6	So, I have a strange career.
17.665	I know it because people come up to me,
17.665	like colleagues, and say,
20.805	"""Chris, you have a strange career."""
22.695	(Laughter)
24.362	And I can see their point,
25.705	because I started my career
25.705	as a theoretical nuclear physicist.
30.26	And I was thinking about quarks
30.26	and gluons and heavy ion collisions,
34.448	and I was only 14 years old --
36.853	No, no, I wasn't 14 years old.
40.497	But after that,
43.056	I actually had my own lab
45.021	in the Computational
45.021	Neuroscience department,
47.16	and I wasn't doing any neuroscience.
48.912	Later, I would work
48.912	on evolutionary genetics,
51.868	and I would work on systems biology.
53.842	But I'm going to tell you
53.842	about something else today.
56.531	I'm going to tell you
56.531	about how I learned something about life.
60.817	And I was actually a rocket scientist.
64.322	I wasn't really a rocket scientist,
66.649	but I was working
66.649	at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
71.029	in sunny California, where it's warm;
73.688	whereas now I am
73.688	in the mid-West, and it's cold.
77.56	But it was an exciting experience.
80.26	One day, a NASA manager
80.26	comes into my office,
83.727	sits down and says,
86.862	"""Can you please tell us,"
86.862	"how do we look for life outside Earth?"""
91.621	And that came as a surprise to me,
93.323	because I was actually hired
93.323	to work on quantum computation.
97.473	Yet, I had a very good answer.
98.998	"I said, ""I have no idea."""
100.799	(Laughter)
101.973	"And he told me, ""Biosignatures,"
101.973	"we need to look for a biosignature."""
107.339	"And I said, ""What is that?"""
108.727	"And he said, ""It's any"
108.727	measurable phenomenon
111.348	that allows us to indicate
111.348	"the presence of life."""
114.788	"And I said, ""Really?"
116.433	Because isn't that easy?
118.404	I mean, we have life.
120.259	Can't you apply a definition,
122.255	for example, a Supreme Court-like
122.255	"definition of life?"""
127.191	And then I thought about it
127.191	a little bit, and I said,
129.757	"""Well, is it really that easy?"
131.256	Because, yes, if you see
131.256	something like this,
133.473	then all right, fine,
133.473	I'm going to call it life --
135.841	no doubt about it.
137.517	"But here's something."""
139.181	"And he goes, ""Right,"
139.181	"that's life too. I know that."""
142.26	Except, if you think that life
142.26	is also defined by things that die,
146.876	you're not in luck with this thing,
148.653	because that's actually
148.653	a very strange organism.
150.939	It grows up into the adult stage like that
153.01	and then goes through
153.01	a Benjamin Button phase,
155.26	and actually goes backwards and backwards
155.26	until it's like a little embryo again,
160.219	and then actually grows back up,
160.219	and back down and back up --
163.157	sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.
164.96	So it's actually life,
167.21	but it's actually not
167.21	as we thought life would be.
171.751	And then you see something like that.
173.686	"And he was like, ""My God,"
173.686	"what kind of a life form is that?"""
176.583	Anyone know?
178.026	It's actually not life, it's a crystal.
181.542	So once you start looking and looking
181.542	at smaller and smaller things --
184.867	so this particular person wrote
184.867	a whole article and said,
188.053	"""Hey, these are bacteria."""
189.558	Except, if you look a little bit closer,
191.553	you see, in fact, that this thing
191.553	is way too small to be anything like that.
195.213	So he was convinced,
195.213	but, in fact, most people aren't.
199.052	And then, of course,
199.052	NASA also had a big announcement,
202.26	and President Clinton
202.26	gave a press conference,
205.149	about this amazing discovery
205.149	of life in a Martian meteorite.
210.66	Except that nowadays,
210.66	it's heavily disputed.
214.066	If you take the lesson
214.066	of all these pictures,
216.525	then you realize, well, actually,
216.525	maybe it's not that easy.
219.443	Maybe I do need a definition of life
222.866	in order to make that kind of distinction.
225.168	So can life be defined?
227.723	Well how would you go about it?
229.254	Well of course, you'd go
229.254	to Encyclopedia Britannica and open at L.
233.285	No, of course you don't do that;
233.285	you put it somewhere in Google.
236.321	And then you might get something.
237.936	(Laughter)
238.984	And what you might get --
240.226	and anything that actually refers
240.226	to things that we are used to,
244.029	you throw away.
245.275	And then you might come up
245.275	with something like this.
247.797	And it says something complicated
247.797	with lots and lots of concepts.
251.078	Who on Earth would write something
251.078	as convoluted and complex and inane?
258.212	Oh, it's actually a really, really,
258.212	important set of concepts.
262.137	So I'm highlighting just a few words
264.26	and saying definitions
264.26	like that rely on things
268.208	that are not based on amino acids
268.208	or leaves or anything that we are used to,
274.381	but in fact on processes only.
276.156	And if you take a look at that,
278.051	this was actually in a book that I wrote
278.051	that deals with artificial life.
281.532	And that explains why that NASA manager
281.532	was actually in my office to begin with.
285.783	Because the idea was that,
285.783	with concepts like that,
288.894	maybe we can actually
288.894	manufacture a form of life.
292.938	And so if you go and ask yourself,
292.938	"""What on Earth is artificial life?"","
297.759	let me give you a whirlwind tour
297.759	of how all this stuff came about.
301.452	And it started out quite a while ago,
304.611	when someone wrote one of the first
304.611	successful computer viruses.
309.245	And for those of you
309.245	who aren't old enough,
311.442	you have no idea
311.442	how this infection was working --
314.049	namely, through these floppy disks.
316.333	But the interesting thing
316.333	about these computer virus infections
320.244	was that, if you look at the rate
320.244	at which the infection worked,
323.72	they show this spiky behavior
323.72	that you're used to from a flu virus.
327.894	And it is in fact due to this arms race
330.26	between hackers
330.26	and operating system designers
333.74	that things go back and forth.
335.364	And the result is kind of
335.364	a tree of life of these viruses,
339.899	a phylogeny that looks very much
339.899	like the type of life
343.528	that we're used to,
343.528	at least on the viral level.
345.981	So is that life?
347.526	Not as far as I'm concerned.
349.166	Why? Because these things
349.166	don't evolve by themselves.
352.032	In fact, they have hackers writing them.
354.009	But the idea was taken
354.009	very quickly a little bit further,
357.363	when a scientist working
357.363	at the Santa Fe Institute decided,
360.698	"""Why don't we try to package"
360.698	these little viruses
363.855	in artificial worlds
363.855	inside of the computer
366.094	"and let them evolve?"""
367.389	And this was Steen Rasmussen.
369.007	And he designed this system,
369.007	but it really didn't work,
371.723	because his viruses
371.723	were constantly destroying each other.
374.631	But there was another scientist
374.631	who had been watching this, an ecologist.
378.172	And he went home and says,
378.172	"""I know how to fix this."""
380.688	And he wrote the Tierra system,
382.356	and, in my book,
383.585	is in fact one of the first
383.585	truly artificial living systems --
387.433	except for the fact that these programs
387.433	didn't really grow in complexity.
390.919	So having seen this work,
390.919	worked a little bit on this,
393.807	this is where I came in.
395.489	And I decided to create a system
395.489	that has all the properties
399.156	that are necessary to see, in fact,
399.156	the evolution of complexity,
403.026	more and more complex
403.026	problems constantly evolving.
406.352	And of course, since I really don't know
406.352	how to write code, I had help in this.
410.16	I had two undergraduate students
411.732	at California Institute of Technology
411.732	that worked with me.
414.485	That's Charles Ofria on the left,
414.485	Titus Brown on the right.
417.361	They are now, actually,
417.361	respectable professors
419.72	at Michigan State University,
421.486	but I can assure you, back in the day,
421.486	we were not a respectable team.
426.011	And I'm really happy
426.011	that no photo survives
428.084	of the three of us
428.084	anywhere close together.
431.352	But what is this system like?
433.251	Well I can't really go into the details,
435.464	but what you see here
435.464	is some of the entrails.
438.141	But what I wanted to focus on
438.141	is this type of population structure.
442.25	There's about 10,000
442.25	programs sitting here.
444.746	And all different strains
444.746	are colored in different colors.
447.689	And as you see here, there are groups
447.689	that are growing on top of each other,
451.317	because they are spreading.
452.682	Any time there is a program
452.682	that's better at surviving in this world,
456.81	due to whatever mutation it has acquired,
458.802	it is going to spread over the others
458.802	and drive the others to extinction.
462.296	So I'm going to show you a movie
463.875	where you're going to see
463.875	that kind of dynamic.
466.126	And these kinds of experiments are started
466.126	with programs that we wrote ourselves.
470.426	We write our own stuff, replicate it,
470.426	and are very proud of ourselves.
473.787	And we put them in,
473.787	and what you see immediately
476.587	is that there are waves
476.587	and waves of innovation.
479.677	By the way, this is highly accelerated,
481.595	so it's like a 1000 generations a second.
483.816	But immediately, the system goes like,
483.816	"""What kind of dumb piece of code was this?"
487.807	This can be improved upon
487.807	"in so many ways, so quickly."""
491.552	So you see waves of new types
491.552	taking over the other types.
495.324	And this type of activity
495.324	goes on for quite a while,
497.91	until the main easy things
497.91	have been acquired by these programs.
502.755	And then, you see
502.755	sort of like a stasis coming on
506.26	where the system essentially waits
508.26	for a new type of innovation,
508.26	like this one,
511.467	which is going to spread over
511.467	all the other innovations that were before
515.773	and is erasing the genes
515.773	that it had before,
518.26	until a new type of higher level
518.26	of complexity has been achieved.
522.26	And this process goes on and on and on.
525.727	So what we see here
527.066	is a system that lives in very much
527.066	the way we're used to how life goes.
531.948	But what the NASA people
531.948	had asked me really was,
536.473	"""Do these guys have a biosignature?"
539.84	Can we measure this type of life?
541.677	Because if we can,
542.893	maybe we have a chance of actually
542.893	discovering life somewhere else
546.766	without being biased
546.766	"by things like amino acids."""
550.481	"So I said, ""Well, perhaps"
550.481	we should construct a biosignature
555.038	based on life as a universal process.
558.26	In fact, it should perhaps make use
558.26	of the concepts that I developed
563.148	just in order to sort of capture
563.148	"what a simple living system might be."""
567.259	And the thing I came up with --
568.802	I have to first give you
568.802	an introduction about the idea,
572.808	and maybe that would be
572.808	a meaning detector,
576.371	rather than a life detector.
578.486	And the way we would do that --
580.26	I would like to find out
580.26	how I can distinguish text
582.92	that was written by a million monkeys,
582.92	as opposed to text that is in our books.
587.905	And I would like to do it in such a way
589.806	that I don't actually have to be able
589.806	to read the language,
592.708	because I'm sure I won't be able to.
594.502	As long as I know
594.502	that there's some sort of alphabet.
597.026	So here would be a frequency plot
599.38	of how often you find
599.38	each of the 26 letters of the alphabet
602.786	in a text written by random monkeys.
605.455	And obviously, each of these letters
605.455	comes off about roughly equally frequent.
610.033	But if you now look at the same
610.033	distribution in English texts,
613.649	it looks like that.
615.462	And I'm telling you,
615.462	this is very robust across English texts.
619.034	And if I look at French texts,
619.034	it looks a little bit different,
622.042	or Italian or German.
623.244	They all have their own type
623.244	of frequency distribution,
626.684	but it's robust.
628.141	It doesn't matter whether it writes
628.141	about politics or about science.
631.372	It doesn't matter whether it's a poem
631.372	or whether it's a mathematical text.
637.176	It's a robust signature,
639.037	and it's very stable.
640.881	As long as our books
640.881	are written in English --
643.062	because people are rewriting them
643.062	and recopying them --
645.877	it's going to be there.
647.26	So that inspired me to think about,
647.26	well, what if I try to use this idea
653.045	in order, not to detect random texts
653.045	from texts with meaning,
656.824	but rather detect the fact
656.824	that there is meaning
660.577	in the biomolecules that make up life.
663.128	But first I have to ask:
664.32	what are these building blocks,
665.832	like the alphabet, elements
665.832	that I showed you?
668.152	Well it turns out, we have
668.152	many different alternatives
671.049	for such a set of building blocks.
673.387	We could use amino acids,
674.659	we could use nucleic acids,
674.659	carboxylic acids, fatty acids.
677.885	In fact, chemistry's extremely rich,
677.885	and our body uses a lot of them.
681.347	So that we actually, to test this idea,
683.677	first took a look at amino acids
683.677	and some other carboxylic acids.
687.248	And here's the result.
688.743	Here is, in fact, what you get
691.933	if you, for example, look
691.933	at the distribution of amino acids
694.98	on a comet or in interstellar space
694.98	or, in fact, in a laboratory,
699.739	where you made very sure
699.739	that in your primordial soup,
702.422	there is no living stuff in there.
704.364	What you find is mostly
704.364	glycine and then alanine
707.267	and there's some trace elements
707.267	of the other ones.
709.65	That is also very robust --
712.103	what you find in systems like Earth
715.959	where there are amino acids,
715.959	but there is no life.
719.128	But suppose you take some dirt
719.128	and dig through it
723.782	and then put it into these spectrometers,
726.766	because there's bacteria
726.766	all over the place;
728.888	or you take water anywhere on Earth,
731.143	because it's teaming with life,
732.684	and you make the same analysis;
734.458	the spectrum looks completely different.
737.059	Of course, there is still
737.059	glycine and alanine,
740.458	but in fact, there are these heavy
740.458	elements, these heavy amino acids,
743.802	that are being produced
743.802	because they are valuable to the organism.
748.327	And some other ones
748.327	that are not used in the set of 20,
752.289	they will not appear at all
752.289	in any type of concentration.
755.211	So this also turns out
755.211	to be extremely robust.
757.94	It doesn't matter what kind of sediment
757.94	you're using to grind up,
761.082	whether it's bacteria
761.082	or any other plants or animals.
764.385	Anywhere there's life,
765.833	you're going to have this distribution,
767.808	as opposed to that distribution.
769.649	And it is detectable
769.649	not just in amino acids.
772.91	Now you could ask:
774.151	Well, what about these Avidians?
777.334	The Avidians being the denizens
777.334	of this computer world
780.409	where they are perfectly happy
780.409	replicating and growing in complexity.
783.878	So this is the distribution that you get
783.878	if, in fact, there is no life.
788.919	They have about 28 of these instructions.
791.661	And if you have a system where
791.661	they're being replaced one by the other,
795.037	it's like the monkeys
795.037	writing on a typewriter.
797.246	Each of these instructions
797.246	appears with roughly the equal frequency.
802.375	But if you now take
802.375	a set of replicating guys
807.179	like in the video that you saw,
809.153	it looks like this.
811.459	So there are some instructions
812.956	that are extremely valuable
812.956	to these organisms,
815.413	and their frequency is going to be high.
817.407	And there's actually some instructions
817.407	that you only use once, if ever.
821.472	So they are either poisonous
823.019	or really should be used
823.019	at less of a level than random.
827.548	In this case, the frequency is lower.
831.192	And so now we can see,
831.192	is that really a robust signature?
833.887	I can tell you indeed it is,
835.268	because this type of spectrum,
835.268	just like what you've seen in books,
838.54	and just like what you've seen
838.54	in amino acids,
840.717	it doesn't really matter
840.717	how you change the environment,
843.383	it's very robust, it's going
843.383	to reflect the environment.
846.031	So I'm going to show you now
846.031	a little experiment that we did.
849.004	And I have to explain to you,
850.412	the top of this graph
851.618	shows you that frequency
851.618	distribution that I talked about.
854.386	Here, that's the lifeless environment
858.217	where each instruction occurs
858.217	at an equal frequency.
862.564	And below there, I show, in fact,
862.564	the mutation rate in the environment.
867.581	And I'm starting this
867.581	at a mutation rate that is so high
870.908	that even if you would drop
870.908	a replicating program
874.898	that would otherwise happily grow up
874.898	to fill the entire world,
879.047	if you drop it in, it gets mutated
879.047	to death immediately.
882.081	So there is no life possible
882.081	at that type of mutation rate.
887.451	But then I'm going to slowly
887.451	turn down the heat, so to speak,
891.511	and then there's this viability threshold
893.72	where now it would be possible
893.72	for a replicator to actually live.
897.636	And indeed, we're going to be dropping
897.636	these guys into that soup all the time.
903.419	So let's see what that looks like.
905.079	So first, nothing, nothing, nothing.
908.101	Too hot, too hot.
909.94	Now the viability threshold is reached,
912.26	and the frequency distribution
912.26	has dramatically changed
916.776	and, in fact, stabilizes.
918.276	And now what I did there
919.81	is, I was being nasty,
919.81	I just turned up the heat again and again.
923.432	And of course, it reaches
923.432	the viability threshold.
925.802	And I'm just showing this to you
925.802	again because it's so nice.
928.694	You hit the viability threshold.
930.26	"The distribution changes to ""alive!"""
932.691	And then, once you hit the threshold
935.932	where the mutation rate is so high
935.932	that you cannot self-reproduce,
940.005	you cannot copy the information
940.005	forward to your offspring
944.95	without making so many mistakes
944.95	that your ability to replicate vanishes.
949.704	And then, that signature is lost.
953.216	What do we learn from that?
954.946	Well, I think we learn
954.946	a number of things from that.
958.766	One of them is,
960.26	if we are able to think about life
960.26	in abstract terms --
965.508	and we're not talking
965.508	about things like plants,
968.163	and we're not talking about amino acids,
970.112	and we're not talking about bacteria,
971.9	but we think in terms of processes --
974.034	then we could start to think about life
976.26	not as something
976.26	that is so special to Earth,
978.903	but that, in fact, could exist anywhere.
981.437	Because it really only has to do
981.437	with these concepts of information,
985.774	of storing information
985.774	within physical substrates --
989.856	anything: bits, nucleic acids,
989.856	anything that's an alphabet --
993.896	and make sure that there's some process
995.799	so that this information can be stored
995.799	for much longer than you would expect --
1000.076	the time scales for
1000.076	the deterioration of information.
1004.436	And if you can do that,
1004.436	then you have life.
1007.628	So the first thing that we learn
1009.906	is that it is possible to define life
1009.906	in terms of processes alone,
1015.142	without referring at all
1015.142	to the type of things that we hold dear,
1020.143	as far as the type of life on Earth is.
1022.838	And that, in a sense, removes us again,
1025.503	like all of our scientific discoveries,
1025.503	or many of them --
1028.358	it's this continuous dethroning of man --
1031.153	of how we think we're special
1031.153	because we're alive.
1033.904	Well, we can make life;
1033.904	we can make life in the computer.
1036.984	Granted, it's limited,
1038.825	but we have learned what it takes
1038.825	in order to actually construct it.
1043.966	And once we have that,
1046.778	then it is not such
1046.778	a difficult task anymore
1049.449	to say, if we understand
1049.449	the fundamental processes
1053.625	that do not refer
1053.625	to any particular substrate,
1056.991	then we can go out and try other worlds,
1060.783	figure out what kind of chemical
1060.783	alphabets might there be,
1065.293	figure enough about the normal chemistry,
1065.293	the geochemistry of the planet,
1070.042	so that we know what this distribution
1070.042	would look like in the absence of life,
1073.84	and then look for large
1073.84	deviations from this --
1076.835	this thing sticking out, which says,
1076.835	"""This chemical really shouldn't be there."""
1081.971	Now we don't know that there's life then,
1083.95	but we could say,
1085.181	"""Well at least I'm going to have to take"
1085.181	a look very precisely at this chemical
1088.974	"and see where it comes from."""
1091.043	And that might be our chance
1091.043	of actually discovering life
1094.778	when we cannot visibly see it.
1096.921	And so that's really the only
1096.921	take-home message that I have for you.
1101.509	Life can be less mysterious
1101.509	than we make it out to be
1105.764	when we try to think
1105.764	about how it would be on other planets.
1109.54	And if we remove the mystery of life,
1112.951	then I think it is a little bit easier
1112.951	for us to think about how we live,
1117.66	and how perhaps we're not as special
1117.66	as we always think we are.
1120.742	And I'm going to leave you with that.
1123.012	And thank you very much.
1124.26	(Applause)
