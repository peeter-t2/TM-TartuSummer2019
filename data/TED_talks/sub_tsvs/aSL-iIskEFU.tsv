13.34	Chris Anderson: So, this is an
13.34	interview with a difference.
16.947	On the basis that a picture
16.947	is worth a thousand words,
21.015	what I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda
23.911	to dig out from their archive
26.118	some images that would help explain
28.216	some of what they've done,
29.652	and do a few things that way.
32.249	So, we're going to start here.
35.98	Melinda, when and where was this,
38.183	and who is that handsome man next to you?
40.217	Melinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?
42.226	This is in Africa, our very first trip,
44.265	the first time either of us had ever been to Africa,
46.17	in the fall of 1993.
47.78	We were already engaged to be married.
49.768	We married a few months later,
51.474	and this was the trip where we really went to see
53.691	the animals and to see the savanna.
55.583	It was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time
57.571	off from work.
58.983	But what really touched us, actually, were the people,
63.61	and the extreme poverty.
66.218	We started asking ourselves questions.
67.791	Does it have to be like this?
69.595	And at the end of the trip,
70.546	we went out to Zanzibar,
71.646	and took some time to walk on the beach,
73.134	which is something we had done a lot
74.5	while we were dating.
75.818	And we'd already been talking about during that time
78.791	that the wealth that had come from Microsoft
80.648	would be given back to society,
81.923	but it was really on that beach walk
83.497	that we started to talk about, well,
85.069	what might we do and how might we go about it?
88.602	CA: So, given that this vacation
91.334	led to the creation of
93.526	the world's biggest private foundation,
96.342	it's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)
99.474	MG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.
101.942	CA: Which of you was the key instigator here,
104.84	or was it symmetrical?
107.793	Bill Gates: Well, I think we were excited
110.186	that there'd be a phase of our life
111.653	where we'd get to work together
113.714	and figure out how to give this money back.
120.325	At this stage, we were talking about the poorest,
123.474	and could you have a big impact on them?
125.876	Were there things that weren't being done?
127.801	There was a lot we didn't know.
129.701	Our naïveté is pretty incredible,
131.789	when we look back on it.
132.881	But we had a certain enthusiasm
134.437	that that would be the phase,
137.434	the post-Microsoft phase
140.16	would be our philanthropy.
142.388	MG: Which Bill always thought was going to come
144.534	after he was 60,
145.67	so he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,
147.332	so some things change along the way.
150.525	CA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.
152.969	So that was '93, and it was '97, really,
155.489	before the foundation itself started.
157.227	MA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article
159.532	about diarrheal diseases killing
159.532	so many kids around the world,
162.946	and we kept saying to ourselves,
164.56	"""Well that can't be."
165.8	"In the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."""
167.554	And so we started gathering scientists
169.719	and started learning about population,
172.185	learning about vaccines,
173.545	learning about what had worked and what had failed,
175.932	and that's really when we got going,
177.838	was in late 1998, 1999.
182.215	CA: So, you've got a big pot of money
184.966	and a world full of so many different issues.
187.293	How on Earth do you decide what to focus on?
191.515	BG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,
194.06	whatever the biggest inequity was globally,
196.92	and there we looked at children dying,
199.18	children not having enough nutrition to ever develop,
201.92	and countries that were really stuck,
203.419	because with that level of death,
205.679	and parents would have so many kids
207.647	that they'd get huge population growth,
209.165	and that the kids were so sick
212.291	that they really couldn't be educated
214.937	and lift themselves up.
216.809	So that was our global thing,
217.917	and then in the U.S.,
220.637	both of us have had amazing educations,
223.411	and we saw that as the way that the U.S.
226.46	could live up to its promise of equal opportunity
229.472	is by having a phenomenal education system,
232.057	and the more we learned, the more we realized
234.685	we're not really fulfilling that promise.
237.113	And so we picked those two things,
238.95	and everything the foundation does
240.602	is focused there.
243.616	CA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image
245.952	that you like that illustrates your work,
248.384	and Melinda, this is what you picked.
251.452	What's this about?
252.919	MG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel
255.95	is to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,
259.06	whether it's Bangladesh, India,
259.06	lots of countries in Africa,
261.658	and I go in as a Western woman without a name.
264.066	I don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.
267.475	And I kept hearing from women,
268.979	over and over and over, the more I traveled,
271.862	"""I want to be able to use this shot."""
274.271	I would be there to talk to them
274.271	about childhood vaccines,
276.84	and they would bring the conversation around to
279.24	"""But what about the shot I get?"""
281.221	which is an injection they were
281.221	getting called Depo-Provera,
283.673	which is a contraceptive.
285.654	And I would come back and
285.654	talk to global health experts,
287.986	"and they'd say, ""Oh no, contraceptives"
289.539	"are stocked in in the developing world."""
291.931	Well, you had to dig deeper into the reports,
293.921	and this is what the team came to me with,
295.697	which is, to have the number one thing
297.843	that women tell you in Africa they want to use
300.981	stocked out more than 200 days a year
303.598	explains why women were saying to me,
305.502	"""I walked 10 kilometers without"
305.502	my husband knowing it,
309.054	"and I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."""
312.363	And so condoms were stocked in in Africa
315.17	because of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
317.447	and others supported.
318.851	But women will tell you over and over again,
320.522	"""I can't negotiate a condom with my husband."
323.132	I'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,
327.34	and I need that tool because then I can space
330.1	the births of my children, and I can feed them
332.517	"and have a chance of educating them."""
335.055	CA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,
337.105	and you've often been embroiled
340.674	in controversy over this issue,
342.628	and on the abortion question,
344.877	on both sides, really.
346.332	How do you navigate that?
348.023	MG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,
351.133	which is, we had backed away from contraceptives
354.216	as a global community.
355.383	We knew that 210 million women
358.677	were saying they wanted access to contraceptives,
360.936	even the contraceptives we have
360.936	here in the United States,
363.576	and we weren't providing them
365.881	because of the political controversy in our country,
369.632	and to me that was just a crime,
371.809	and I kept looking around trying to find the person
374.574	that would get this back on the global stage,
376.924	and I finally realized I just had to do it.
378.93	And even though I'm Catholic,
380.601	I believe in contraceptives
382.042	just like most of the Catholic
382.042	women in the United States
384.338	who report using contraceptives,
386.169	and I shouldn't let that controversy
388.454	be the thing that holds us back.
390.269	We used to have consensus in the United States
392.227	around contraceptives,
393.492	and so we got back to that global consensus,
395.972	and actually raised 2.6 billion dollars
398.616	around exactly this issue for women.
401.149	(Applause)
409.249	CA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?
413.105	BG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.
415.09	(Laughter)
417.208	I really like this graph.
419.025	This is the number of children
422	who die before the age of five every year.
424.582	And what you find is really
426.405	a phenomenal success story
428.355	which is not widely known,
430.509	that we are making incredible progress.
433.184	We go from 20 million
435.562	not long after I was born
437.266	to now we're down to about six million.
440.952	So this is a story
443.089	largely of vaccines.
444.756	Smallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.
447.88	That was eradicated, so that got down to zero.
450.07	Measles was killing a couple million a year.
451.91	That's down to a few hundred thousand.
453.613	Anyway, this is a chart
455.521	where you want to get that number to continue,
459.708	and it's going to be possible,
461.448	using the science of new vaccines,
463.124	getting the vaccines out to kids.
465.016	We can actually accelerate the progress.
466.74	The last decade,
468.303	that number has dropped faster
470.115	than ever in history,
472.393	and so I just love the fact that
475.116	you can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,
477.381	we can get them out there,
478.889	use the very latest understanding of these things,
481.374	and get the delivery right, that
481.374	we can perform a miracle.
485.985	CA: I mean, you do the math on this,
487.143	and it works out, I think, literally
489.017	to thousands of kids' lives saved every day
491.143	compared to the prior year.
493.197	It's not reported.
495.044	An airliner with 200-plus deaths
498.29	is a far, far bigger story than that.
500.5	Does that drive you crazy?
502.049	BG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.
505.04	It's a kid, one kid at a time.
507.71	Ninety-eight percent of this
509.173	has nothing to do with natural disasters,
511.05	and yet, people's charity,
512.527	when they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.
514.05	It's incredible how people think, okay,
516.286	that could be me, and the money flows.
519.062	These causes have been a bit invisible.
522.468	Now that the Millennium Development Goals
524.679	and various things are getting out there,
526.229	we are seeing some increased generosity,
529.073	so the goal is to get this well below a million,
532.344	which should be possible in our lifetime.
534.762	CA: Maybe it needed someone
535.942	who is turned on by numbers and graphs
538.038	rather than just the big, sad face
540.452	to get engaged.
542.107	I mean, you've used it in your letter this year,
543.83	you used basically this argument to say that aid,
547.281	contrary to the current meme
548.952	that aid is kind of worthless and broken,
552.035	that actually it has been effective.
553.988	BG: Yeah, well people can take,
555.968	there is some aid that was well-meaning
559.148	and didn't go well.
561.071	There's some venture capital investments
563.004	that were well-meaning and didn't go well.
565.904	You shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,
568.743	because we don't have a perfect record,
571.861	this is a bad endeavor.
573.393	You should look at, what was your goal?
575.263	How are you trying to uplift nutrition
577.871	and survival and literacy
581.275	so these countries can take care of themselves,
582.91	and say wow, this is going well,
584.914	and be smarter.
586.186	We can spend aid smarter.
588.026	It is not all a panacea.
591.438	We can do better than venture capital, I think,
594.37	including big hits like this.
597.157	CA: Traditional wisdom is that
599.9	it's pretty hard for married couples to work together.
603.948	How have you guys managed it?
605.564	MG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,
607.234	"""I really don't think I could work with my husband."
609.093	"That just wouldn't work out."""
611.24	You know, we enjoy it, and we don't --
614.829	this foundation has been a coming to for both of us
617.315	in its continuous learning journey,
620.143	and we don't travel together as much
622.902	for the foundation, actually, as we used to
624.83	when Bill was working at Microsoft.
626.286	We have more trips where
626.286	we're traveling separately,
628.509	but I always know when I come home,
630.651	Bill's going to be interested in what I learned,
632.79	whether it's about women or girls
634.533	or something new about the vaccine delivery chain,
637.219	or this person that is a great leader.
639.455	He's going to listen and be really interested.
641.922	And he knows when he comes home,
643.525	even if it's to talk about the speech he did
645.358	or the data or what he's learned,
647.1	I'm really interested,
648.342	and I think we have a really
648.342	collaborative relationship.
651.242	But we don't every minute together, that's for sure.
653.916	(Laughter)
658.091	CA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.
660.586	Melinda, early on, you were basically
664.172	largely running the show.
666.173	Six years ago, I guess,
667.385	Bill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft
669.968	and became full time.
671.079	That must have been hard,
672.058	adjusting to that. No?
674.094	MG: Yeah. I think actually,
677.148	for the foundation employees,
679.137	there was way more angst for them
681.684	than there was for me about Bill coming.
683.05	I was actually really excited.
684.256	I mean, Bill made this decision
685.875	even obviously before it got announced in 2006,
688.558	and it was really his decision,
690.26	but again, it was a beach vacation
692.146	where we were walking on the beach
693.45	and he was starting to think of this idea.
695.714	And for me, the excitement of Bill
698.326	putting his brain and his heart
701.035	against these huge global problems,
703.382	these inequities, to me that was exciting.
705.71	Yes, the foundation employees had angst about that.
709.444	(Applause)
711.119	CA: That's cool.
713.235	MG: But that went away within three months,
714.919	once he was there.
715.846	BG: Including some of the employees.
717.511	MG: That's what I said, the employees,
718.784	it went away for them three
718.784	months after you were there.
720.906	BG: No, I'm kidding.
720.906	MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.
723.226	BG: A few of them did, but —
725.127	(Laughter)
726.96	CA: So what do you guys argue about?
728.903	Sunday, 11 o'clock,
731.56	you're away from work,
732.981	what comes up? What's the argument?
735.494	BG: Because we built this thing
737.139	together from the beginning,
740.258	it's this great partnership.
741.904	I had that with Paul Allen
743.758	in the early days of Microsoft.
745.669	I had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,
748.481	and now Melinda, and in even stronger,
751.485	equal ways, is the partner,
753.371	so we talk a lot about
755.128	which things should we give more to,
757.256	which groups are working well?
759.8	She's got a lot of insight.
761.053	She'll sit down with the employees a lot.
762.7	We'll take the different trips she described.
764.816	So there's a lot of collaboration.
768.433	I can't think of anything where one of us
770.409	had a super strong opinion
773.679	about one thing or another?
775.515	CA: How about you, Melinda, 
775.515	though? Can you? (Laughter)
778.317	You never know.
779.533	MG: Well, here's the thing.
781.059	We come at things from different angles,
782.798	and I actually think that's really good.
784.73	So Bill can look at the big data
786.738	"and say, ""I want to act based"
786.738	"on these global statistics."""
789.75	For me, I come at it from intuition.
791.616	I meet with lots of people on the ground
793.549	and Bill's taught me to take that
795.529	and read up to the global data and see if they match,
798.152	and I think what I've taught him
799.241	is to take that data
800.669	and meet with people on the ground to understand,
802.283	can you actually deliver that vaccine?
804.667	Can you get a woman to accept those polio drops
807.868	in her child's mouth?
809.198	Because the delivery piece
810.756	is every bit as important as the science.
812.959	So I think it's been more a coming to over time
815.481	towards each other's point of view,
816.776	and quite frankly, the work is better because of it.
820.046	CA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,
822.319	you've had some amazing successes.
826.118	What about failure, though?
827.35	Can you talk about a failure
829.041	and maybe what you've learned from it?
831.137	BG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,
833.705	because we've certainly had them.
835.842	We do a lot of drug work or vaccine work
840.216	that you know you're going to have different failures.
843.492	Like, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity
845.719	was asking for a better condom.
847.02	Well, we got hundreds of ideas.
848.514	Maybe a few of those will work out.
851.708	We were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug
855.087	for a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,
857.703	that I thought, once I got this drug,
859.354	we can just go wipe out the disease.
860.71	Well, turns out it took an injection
863.29	every day for 10 days.
864.926	It took three more years to get it than we expected,
867.313	and then there was no way
868.771	it was going to get out there.
871.139	Fortunately, we found out
872.358	that if you go kill the sand flies,
875.52	you probably can have success there,
877.642	but we spent five years,
879.497	you could say wasted five years,
880.875	and about 60 million,
882.882	on a path that turned out to have
884.222	very modest benefit when we got there.
888.387	CA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year
891.831	in education, I think, something like that.
893.766	Is anything, the story of what's gone right there
897.79	is quite a long and complex one.
900.246	Are there any failures that you can talk about?
904.168	MG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us
905.958	out of the early work is we thought
907.206	that these small schools were the answer,
909.739	and small schools definitely help.
911.209	They bring down the dropout rate.
912.733	They have less violence and crime in those schools.
915.333	But the thing that we learned from that work,
917.479	and what turned out to be the fundamental key,
920.013	is a great teacher in front of the classroom.
922.077	If you don't have an effective teacher
923.684	in the front of the classroom,
924.75	I don't care how big or small the building is,
926.906	you're not going to change the trajectory
928.56	of whether that student will be ready for college.
930.513	(Applause)
935.108	CA: So Melinda, this is you and
937.418	your eldest daughter, Jenn.
940.972	And just taken about three weeks ago, I think,
942.871	three or four weeks ago. Where was this?
944.455	MG: So we went to Tanzania.
946.211	Jenn's been to Tanzania.
947.053	All our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.
949.756	And we did something very different,
951.971	which is, we decided to go spend
953.798	two nights and three days with a family.
956.217	Anna and Sanare are the parents.
959.318	They invited us to come and stay in their boma.
962.352	Actually, the goats had been there, I think,
963.851	living in that particular little hut
965.25	on their little compound before we got there.
967.921	And we stayed with their family,
969.419	and we really, really learned
971.353	what life is like in rural Tanzania.
973.206	And the difference between just going
974.82	and visiting for half a day
976.539	or three quarters of a day
978.001	versus staying overnight was profound,
980.399	and so let me just give you one explanation of that.
983.89	They had six children, and as I talked to Anna
986.019	in the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours
987.794	in the cooking hut that day,
989.437	and as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned
991.248	and spaced with her husband
992.718	the births of their children.
994.155	It was a very loving relationship.
995.81	This was a Maasai warrior and his wife,
998.113	but they had decided to get married,
1000.022	they clearly had respect and love in the relationship.
1003.357	Their children, their six children,
1004.968	the two in the middle were twins, 13,
1007.487	a boy, and a girl named Grace.
1009.74	And when we'd go out to chop wood
1011.313	and do all the things that Grace
1011.313	and her mother would do,
1013.748	Grace was not a child, she was an adolescent,
1016.34	but she wasn't an adult.
1017.817	She was very, very shy.
1019.568	So she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.
1021.329	We kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.
1024.164	And at night, though,
1025.77	when all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,
1028.577	and there was no moon that night,
1030.081	the first night, and no stars,
1031.803	and Jenn came out of our hut
1033.629	with her REI little headlamp on,
1036.446	Grace went immediately,
1038.584	and got the translator,
1039.94	came straight up to my Jenn and said,
1042.03	"""When you go home,"
1043.263	can I have your headlamp
1044.438	"so I can study at night?"""
1046.168	CA: Oh, wow.
1047.25	MG: And her dad had told me
1048.734	how afraid he was that unlike the son,
1050.821	who had passed his secondary exams,
1052.483	because of her chores,
1054.013	she'd not done so well
1055.451	and wasn't in the government school yet.
1057.255	"He said, ""I don't know how I'm"
1057.255	going to pay for her education.
1059.79	I can't pay for private school,
1061.616	"and she may end up on this farm like my wife."""
1064.195	So they know the difference
1065.324	that an education can make
1066.349	in a huge, profound way.
1069.346	CA: I mean, this is another pic
1070.767	of your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,
1074.173	along with Paul Farmer.
1078.311	Bringing up three children
1079.925	when you're the world's richest family
1082.927	seems like a social experiment
1085.223	without much prior art.
1088.795	How have you managed it?
1090.33	What's been your approach?
1092.545	BG: Well, I'd say overall
1095.178	the kids get a great education,
1096.94	but you've got to make sure
1097.838	they have a sense of their own ability
1099.54	and what they're going to go and do,
1101.529	and our philosophy has been
1103.902	to be very clear with them --
1105.124	most of the money's going to the foundation --
1106.669	and help them find something they're excited about.
1111.01	We want to strike a balance where they have
1112.405	the freedom to do anything
1114.198	but not a lot of money showered on them
1117.538	so they could go out and do nothing.
1120.667	And so far, they're fairly diligent,
1123.645	excited to pick their own direction.
1126.853	CA: You've obviously guarded their 
1126.853	privacy carefully for obvious reasons.
1132.421	I'm curious why you've given me permission
1134.615	to show this picture now here at TED.
1136.24	MG: Well, it's interesting.
1137.377	As they get older, they so know
1139.218	that our family belief is about responsibility,
1142.227	that we are in an unbelievable situation
1144.342	just to live in the United States
1145.96	and have a great education,
1147.651	and we have a responsibility
1147.651	to give back to the world.
1149.699	And so as they get older
1150.752	and we are teaching them --
1151.772	they have been to so many
1151.772	countries around the world —
1154.132	they're saying,
1155.264	we do want people to know that we believe
1157.016	in what you're doing, Mom and Dad,
1158.517	and it is okay to show us more.
1160.478	So we have their permission to show this picture,
1163.13	and I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it
1164.845	eventually in some of his work.
1167.3	But they really care deeply
1168.902	about the mission of the foundation, too.
1171.327	CA: You've easily got enough money
1173.249	despite your vast contributions to the foundation
1175.84	to make them all billionaires.
1177.474	Is that your plan for them?
1178.991	BG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.
1181.327	They need to have a sense
1183.262	that their own work is meaningful and important.
1189.798	We read an article long, actually,
1189.798	before we got married,
1193.27	where Warren Buffett talked about that,
1195.915	and we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor
1198.164	either to society or to the kids.
1201.418	CA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,
1203.486	something really amazing happened in 2006,
1206.15	when somehow your only real rival
1209.11	for richest person in America
1210.662	suddenly turned around and agreed to give
1214.625	to your foundation.
1216.342	How on Earth did that happen?
1218.078	I guess there's a long version
1218.078	and a short version of that.
1220.056	We've got time for the short version.
1221.438	BG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,
1225.193	and he was going to have his wife Suzie
1229.85	give it all away.
1231.405	Tragically, she passed away before he did,
1234.846	and he's big on delegation, and
1238.444	— (Laughter) —
1240.602	he said —
1242.013	CA: Tweet that.
1242.868	BG: If he's got somebody
1242.868	who is doing something well,
1246.029	and is willing to do it at no charge,
1250.486	maybe that's okay. But we were stunned.
1252.864	MG: Totally stunned.
1252.864	BG: We had never expected it,
1254.96	and it has been unbelievable.
1256.525	It's allowed us to increase our ambition
1259.665	in what the foundation can do quite dramatically.
1263.282	Half the resources we have
1264.786	come from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.
1267.67	CA: And I think you've pledged that
1268.554	by the time you're done,
1270.344	more than, or 95 percent of your wealth,
1272.222	will be given to the foundation.
1274.117	BG: Yes.
1275.271	CA: And since this relationship, it's amazing—
1279.02	(Applause)
1282.386	And recently, you and Warren
1285.023	have been going around trying to persuade
1286.903	other billionaires and successful people
1288.879	to pledge to give, what,
1290.402	more than half of their assets for philanthropy.
1296.16	How is that going?
1298.575	BG: Well, we've got about 120 people
1301.747	who have now taken this giving pledge.
1304.185	The thing that's great is that we get together
1306.791	yearly and talk about, okay,
1308.9	do you hire staff, what do you give to them?
1310.865	We're not trying to homogenize it.
1312.092	I mean, the beauty of philanthropy
1313.14	is this mind-blowing diversity.
1315.147	People give to some things.
1316.31	"We look and go, ""Wow."""
1318.989	But that's great.
1320.097	That's the role of philanthropy
1321.226	is to pick different approaches,
1323.713	including even in one space, like education.
1325.705	We need more experimentation.
1328.076	But it's been wonderful, meeting those people,
1330.98	sharing their journey to philanthropy,
1333.212	how they involve their kids,
1334.316	where they're doing it differently,
1336.15	and it's been way more successful than we expected.
1338.856	Now it looks like it'll just keep growing in size
1341.551	in the years ahead.
1344.114	MG: And having people see that other people
1347.626	are making change with philanthropy,
1349.33	I mean, these are people who have
1351.666	created their own businesses,
1352.711	put their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.
1355.359	If they put their ideas and their brain
1357.585	behind philanthropy, they can change the world.
1360.118	And they start to see others doing it, and saying,
1362.409	"""Wow, I want to do that with my own money."""
1364.449	To me, that's the piece that's incredible.
1366.493	CA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard
1369.411	for some people to figure out
1370.657	even how to remotely spend that much money
1373.34	on something else.
1375.513	There are probably some billionaires in the room
1377.606	and certainly some successful people.
1379.715	I'm curious, can you make the pitch?
1381.775	What's the pitch?
1383.009	BG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing
1384.39	we've ever done,
1385.872	and you can't take it with you,
1388.842	and if it's not good for your kids,
1392.024	let's get together and brainstorm
1393.313	about what we can be done.
1396	The world is a far better place
1398.19	because of the philanthropists of the past,
1400.828	and the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,
1403.861	is the envy of the world.
1405.212	And part of the reason I'm so optimistic
1407.13	is because I do think philanthropy
1409.074	is going to grow
1410.688	and take some of these things
1411.807	government's not just good at
1411.807	working on and discovering
1414.706	and shine some light in the right direction.
1418.176	CA: The world's got this terrible inequality,
1421.118	growing inequality problem
1422.279	that seems structural.
1423.74	It does seem to me that if more of your peers
1426.606	took the approach that you two have made,
1428.982	it would make a dent
1430.574	both in that problem and certainly
1431.84	in the perception of that problem.
1433.44	Is that a fair comment?
1434.844	BG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy
1436.502	and give to the least wealthy, it's good.
1439.834	It tries to balance out, and that's just.
1441.966	MG: But you change systems.
1443.722	In the U.S., we're trying to
1443.722	change the education system
1446.335	so it's just for everybody
1448.403	and it works for all students.
1449.96	That, to me, really changes
1451.85	the inequality balance.
1453.007	BG: That's the most important.
1454.589	(Applause)
1458.137	CA: Well, I really think that most people here
1461.552	and many millions around the world
1463.297	are just in awe of the trajectory
1465.846	your lives have taken
1467.154	and the spectacular degree to which
1470.885	you have shaped the future.
1473	Thank you so much for coming to TED
1474.34	and for sharing with us and for all you do.
1475.801	BG: Thank you.
1475.801	MG: Thank you.
1477.737	(Applause)
1486.515	BG: Thank you.
1486.515	MG: Thank you very much.
1490.91	BG: All right, good job. (Applause)
