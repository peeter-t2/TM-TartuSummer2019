12.725	I am a climate scientist,
15.034	and I hate weather.
17.821	I have spent too much time in California,
20.251	and I strongly feel that weather
20.251	should be optional.
23.94	(Laughter)
25.098	So I don't want to experience clouds,
28.163	let alone study them.
30.186	But clouds seem to follow me
30.186	wherever I go.
34.642	The thing is, clouds are a real
34.642	challenge for climate science.
39.791	We don't know how they're going to react
39.791	as the planet heats up,
43.636	and hidden in that uncertainty
47.381	might be hope.
49.351	Maybe, just maybe,
51.908	clouds could slow down global warming,
54.613	and buy us a little bit more time
54.613	to get our act together,
58.284	which would be very convenient right now.
61.42	I mean, even I could put up
61.42	with a few more cloudy days
65.534	if clouds saved the planet.
68.542	Now, we are sure about some things.
71.717	Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,
74.064	we're emitting a lot of it,
75.484	and the planet is heating up.
77.354	Case closed.
79.327	But I still go to work every day.
81.79	It turns out that there is a lot
81.79	that we don't understand
85.514	about climate change.
87.434	In particular, we haven't answered
89.922	what seems to be a very
89.922	fundamental question.
93.404	We know it's going to get hot,
95.019	but we don't know exactly
95.019	how hot it's going to get.
99.492	Now, this is a really
99.492	easy question to answer
102.455	if one of you would like
102.455	to give me a time machine.
105.453	But I'm going to be honest with you:
107.938	if I had a time machine,
110.017	I would not be hanging out
110.017	at this particular point in history.
114.049	So in order to see the future,
117.126	we have to rely on the output
117.126	of computer simulations --
120.764	climate models, like this one.
123.338	Now, in my line of work,
125.202	I encounter many very charming
125.202	people on the internet
128.927	who like to tell me
128.927	that climate models are all wrong.
133.762	And I would just like to say:
136.102	no kidding!
138.209	Seriously? I get paid to complain
138.209	about climate models.
141.811	But we don't want models to be perfect.
145.645	We want them to be useful.
147.766	I mean, think about it:
149.421	a computer simulation
151.503	that's able to exactly
151.503	reproduce all of reality.
155.986	That's not a climate model;
158.315	"That's ""The Matrix."""
160.842	So, models are not crystal balls.
164.278	They're research tools,
165.993	and the ways in which they're wrong
165.993	can actually teach us a lot.
170.813	For example:
172.19	different climate models
172.19	are largely able to capture
175.208	the warming that we've seen so far.
177.356	But fast-forward to the end of the century
180.148	under a business-as-usual scenario,
182.501	and climate models
182.501	don't really agree anymore.
185.607	Yeah, they're all warming;
185.607	that's just basic physics.
189.15	But some of them project catastrophe --
192.383	more than five times the warming
192.383	we've seen already.
195.576	And others are literally more chill.
198.839	So why don't climate models agree
198.839	on how warm it's going to get?
204.254	Well, to a large extent,
206.325	it's because they don't agree
206.325	on what clouds will do in the future.
210.572	And that is because, just like me,
213.367	computers hate clouds.
215.639	Computers hate clouds because
215.639	they're simultaneously very large
219.853	and very small.
221.624	Clouds are formed
222.806	when microscopic water droplets
222.806	or ice crystals coalesce
227.455	around tiny particles.
229.515	But at the same time, they cover
229.515	two-thirds of the earth's surface.
233.715	In order to really
233.715	accurately model clouds,
236.759	we'd need to track the behavior
236.759	of every water droplet and dust grain
241.307	in the entire atmosphere,
242.773	and there's no computer
242.773	powerful enough to do that.
245.676	So instead, we have to make a trade-off:
248.94	we can zoom in and get the details right,
251.867	but have no idea
251.867	what's going on worldwide;
254.869	or, we could sacrifice
254.869	realism at small scales
259.816	in order to see the bigger picture.
262.129	Now, there's no one right answer,
264.383	no perfect way to do this,
266.422	and different climate models
266.422	make different choices.
270.263	Now, it is unfortunate
272.652	that computers struggle with clouds,
275.014	because clouds are crucially important
277.736	in regulating the temperature
277.736	of the planet.
280.454	In fact, if all the clouds went away,
283.049	we would experience
283.049	profound climate changes.
286.809	But without clouds,
288.306	would it be warmer or colder?
291.312	The answer is both.
293.836	So I'm going to be honest with you,
293.836	I am not a cloud spotter.
296.882	My favorite type of cloud is none.
299.59	But even I know that clouds
299.59	come in all shapes and sizes.
304.387	Low, thick clouds like these
304.387	are really good at blocking out the sun
308.631	and ruining your barbecue,
310.708	and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus
313.655	largely let that sunlight stream through.
316.436	Every sunny day is the same,
318.857	but every cloudy day
318.857	is cloudy in its own way.
321.857	And it's this diversity
323.839	that can make the global impact of clouds
323.839	very hard to understand.
328.096	So to see this global effect of clouds,
331.124	it really helps to take a selfie.
334.958	It will never cease to blow my mind
338.483	that we can see our planet
338.483	from outer space,
341.692	but we can't see all of it.
343.938	Clouds are blocking the view.
346.12	That's what they do.
347.509	These low, thick clouds
347.509	are extremely effective sunshades.
352.219	They turn back about 20 percent
352.219	of everything the sun sends us.
356.294	That is a lot of wasted solar power.
359.022	So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,
362.028	making the planet cooler.
363.892	But that's not the only effect of clouds.
366.766	Our planet has a temperature,
368.362	and like anything with a temperature,
370.573	it's giving off heat.
372.469	We are radiating thermal energy
372.469	away into space,
375.819	and we can see this in the infrared.
378.688	Once again, clouds are blocking the view.
382.207	That's because high clouds live
382.207	in the upper reaches of the atmosphere,
386.034	where it's very cold.
387.811	And this means that they lose
387.811	very little heat to space themselves.
391.533	But at the same time, they block
391.533	the heat coming up from the planet below.
395.948	The earth is trying to cool itself off,
398.847	and high clouds are getting in the way.
401.983	The result is a very
401.983	powerful greenhouse effect.
406.819	So, clouds play this very
406.819	large and dual role
410.697	in the climate system.
412.292	We've got low clouds that act
412.292	like a sunshade,
415.107	cooling the planet,
416.5	and high clouds which act
416.5	like a greenhouse,
419.443	warming the planet.
421.245	Right now, these two effects --
421.245	they don't cancel out.
424.51	That sunshade -- it's a little
424.51	bit more powerful.
427.952	So if we got rid
427.952	of all the clouds tomorrow,
431.054	which, for the record,
431.054	I am not advocating,
434.292	our planet would get warmer.
436.875	So clearly, all of the clouds
436.875	are not going away.
440.63	But climate change is change.
443.348	So we can ask:
444.782	How will global warming change clouds?
448.696	But remember, clouds are so important
451.534	in regulating the earth's temperature,
453.656	and they both warm and cool the planet.
456.391	So even small changes to cloud cover
459.495	could have profound consequences.
462.06	So we might also ask:
464.044	How will clouds change global warming?
467.79	And that is where there might
467.79	be space for hope.
471.505	If global warming triggers cloud changes
474.733	that make for a less powerful greenhouse
474.733	or a more effective sunshade,
479.909	then that would enhance
479.909	the cooling power of clouds.
483.623	It would act in opposition
483.623	to global warming,
487.174	and that's what's happening
487.174	in those climate models
490.168	that project relatively muted warming.
493.214	But climate models struggle with clouds,
496.601	and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.
500.412	Clouds could help us out
500.412	with global warming.
503.653	They could also make it worse.
505.953	Now, we know that
505.953	climate change is happening
508.863	because we can see it:
510.652	rising temperatures, melting icecaps,
510.652	shifts in rainfall patterns.
516.701	And you might think that we
516.701	could also see it in the clouds.
520.122	But here's something else unfortunate:
522.662	clouds are really hard to see.
526.254	I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest
528.324	"is like, ""I have some"
528.324	"suggestions for you."""
530.547	(Laughter)
531.595	And you guys, we have tried looking up.
534.215	(Laughter)
535.29	But in order to do climate science,
538.333	we need to see all of the clouds,
538.333	everywhere, for a very long time.
543.49	And that's what makes it hard.
545.917	Now, nothing sees more clouds
545.917	than a satellite --
550.715	not even a British person.
552.659	(Laughter)
553.804	And fortunately, we do have
553.804	satellite observations of clouds
558.935	that, like me, date back to the 1980s.
562.502	But these satellites
562.502	were designed for weather,
566.14	not climate.
567.688	They weren't in it for the long haul.
569.626	So to get that long-term
569.626	trend information,
572.336	we need to do climate science.
574.135	We have to stitch together
574.135	the output of multiple satellites
577.277	with different viewing angles and orbits
580.379	and carrying different camera equipment.
582.326	And as a result,
583.572	there are gaps in our knowledge.
586.319	But even from this very cloudy picture,
589.672	we're starting to get hints
589.672	of a possible future.
593.468	When we looked at the observations,
596.092	one thing jumped out at us:
598.492	the clouds are moving.
601.513	As the planet's temperature increases,
604.026	high clouds rise up.
606.506	They move to the colder
606.506	upper reaches of the atmosphere,
610.76	and this means that even
610.76	as the planet heats up,
614.447	high clouds don't.
616.204	They remain at roughly
616.204	the same temperature.
618.865	So they are not losing more heat to space.
622.387	But at the same time,
622.387	they're trapping more heat
625.448	from the warming planet below.
627.669	This intensifies the greenhouse effect.
631.614	High clouds are making
631.614	global warming worse.
636.202	Clouds are moving
636.202	in other dimensions, too.
638.691	The atmospheric circulation,
638.691	that large-scale motion
641.72	of air and water in the atmosphere,
643.662	is changing,
645.073	and clouds are going with it.
649.036	On large scales,
650.666	clouds seem to be moving
650.666	from the tropics toward the poles.
654.802	It's kind of like your
654.802	grandparents in reverse.
658.027	And this matters,
659.63	because if your job
659.63	is to block incoming sunlight,
663.503	you are going to be much
663.503	more effective in the tropics
666.543	under that intense tropical sun
668.764	than you are in higher latitudes.
671.092	So if this keeps up,
672.986	this will also make global warming worse.
676.107	And what we have not found,
678.452	despite years of looking,
680.754	is any indication of the opposite.
683.865	There is no observational evidence
686.821	that clouds will substantially
686.821	slow down global warming.
691.961	The earth is not going
691.961	to break its own fever.
696.013	Now, there are still uncertainties here.
699.044	We don't know for sure
701.296	what the future holds.
703.671	But we are sending our kids there,
706.802	and they are never coming back.
710.253	I want them to be prepared
710.253	for what they'll face,
714.12	and that is why it is so important
717.387	to keep our earth-observing
717.387	satellites up there
720.662	and to hire diverse and smart
720.662	and talented people
724.482	who do not hate clouds
726.773	to improve the climate models.
729.39	But uncertainty is not ignorance.
733.873	We don't know everything,
735.913	but we don't know nothing,
738.254	and we know what carbon dioxide does.
741.651	I started my career as an astrophysicist,
744.839	so you can believe me
746.345	when I say that this is the greatest
746.345	place in the universe.
752.904	Other planets might have liquid water.
756.808	On earth, we have whiskey.
759.975	(Laughter)
762.012	(Applause)
767.044	We are so lucky to live here,
771.41	but let's not push our luck.
774.296	I don't think that clouds
774.296	will save the planet.
778.045	I think that's probably up to us.
780.177	Thank you.
781.44	(Applause)
