12.88	I'm here to recruit men
12.88	to support gender equality.
16.48	(Cheers)
19.64	Wait, wait. What?
22.68	What do men have to do
22.68	with gender equality?
25.52	Gender equality is about women, right?
27.52	I mean, the word gender is about women.
32.2	Actually, I'm even here speaking
32.2	as a middle class white man.
36.52	Now, I wasn't always
36.52	a middle class white man.
39.44	It all happened for me about 30 years ago
39.44	when I was in graduate school,
44.64	and a bunch of us graduate students
44.64	got together one day,
48.08	and we said, you know,
48.08	there's an explosion
50.76	of writing and thinking
50.76	in feminist theory,
54.52	but there's no courses yet.
56.44	So we did what graduate students
56.44	typically do in a situation like that.
59.798	We said, OK, let's have a study group.
62.48	We'll read a text, we'll talk about it,
65.08	we'll have a potluck dinner.
66.68	(Laughter)
68.2	So every week,
71.72	(Laughter)
74.52	We would read some text in feminist theory
74.52	and have a conversation about it.
78.48	And during one of our conversations,
80.72	I witnessed an interaction
80.72	that changed my life forever.
85.64	It was a conversation between two women.
88.64	One of the women was white,
88.64	and one was black.
92.92	And the white woman said --
94.28	this is going to sound
94.28	very anachronistic now --
96.64	"the white woman said, ""All women"
96.64	face the same oppression as women.
102.36	All women are similarly
102.36	situated in patriarchy,
105.2	and therefore all women have a kind
105.2	"of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood."""
110.84	And the black woman said,
110.84	"""I'm not so sure."
114.4	"Let me ask you a question."""
116.32	So the black woman
116.32	says to the white woman,
119.08	"""When you wake up in the morning"
119.08	and you look in the mirror,
121.96	"what do you see?"""
123.2	"And the white woman said, ""I see a woman."""
125.84	And the black woman said,
125.84	"""You see, that's the problem for me."
129.04	Because when I wake up in the morning
129.04	"and I look in the mirror,"" she said,"
132.56	"""I see a black woman."
133.96	To me, race is visible. But to you,
133.96	"race is invisible. You don't see it."""
139.76	And then she said
139.76	something really startling.
142.479	"She said, ""That's how privilege works."
145.16	Privilege is invisible
145.16	"to those who have it."""
148.68	It is a luxury, I will say
148.68	to the white people sitting in this room,
151.96	not to have to think about race
151.96	every split second of our lives.
155.72	Privilege is invisible
155.72	to those who have it.
159.48	Now remember, I was
159.48	the only man in this group,
161.88	"so when I witnessed this, I went, ""Oh no."""
164.8	(Laughter)
166.56	And somebody said,
166.56	"""Well what was that reaction?"""
168.92	"And I said, ""Well, when I wake up"
168.92	in the morning and I look in the mirror,
172.6	I see a human being.
174.52	I'm kind of the generic person.
177	You know, I'm a middle class white man.
177	I have no race, no class, no gender.
181.04	"I'm universally generalizable."""
183.08	(Laughter)
184.92	So I like to think that was the moment
184.92	I became a middle class white man,
188.68	that class and race and gender
188.68	were not about other people,
192.64	they were about me.
194.2	I had to start thinking about them,
196.4	and it had been privilege that had
196.4	kept it invisible to me for so long.
201.2	Now, I wish I could tell you
201.2	this story ends 30 years ago
203.891	in that little discussion group,
205.48	but I was reminded of it quite recently
205.48	at my university where I teach.
209.28	I have a colleague, and she and I
209.28	both teach the sociology of gender course
213.24	on alternate semesters.
215.12	So she gives a guest lecture
215.12	for me when I teach.
217.52	I give a guest lecture
217.52	for her when she teaches.
219.92	So I walk into her class
219.92	to give a guest lecture,
223.28	about 300 students in the room,
225.48	and as I walk in, one of the students
225.48	looks up and says,
228.84	"""Oh, finally, an objective opinion."""
232.84	All that semester, whenever
232.84	my colleague opened her mouth,
236	what my students saw was a woman.
238.4	I mean, if you were to say to my students,
240.52	"""There is structural inequality"
240.52	"based on gender in the United States,"""
244	"they'd say, ""Well of course"
244	you'd say that.
246.04	"You're a woman. You're biased."""
247.541	When I say it, they go,
247.541	"""Wow, is that interesting."
250.44	Is that going to be on the test?
250.44	"How do you spell 'structural'?"""
253.464	(Laughter)
255.32	So I hope you all can see,
257.6	this is what objectivity looks like.
260.48	(Laughter) (Applause)
264.24	Disembodied Western rationality.
267.52	(Laughter)
270.279	And that, by the way, is why I think
270.279	men so often wear ties.
274.36	(Laughter)
276.08	Because if you are going to embody
276.08	disembodied Western rationality,
280.68	you need a signifier,
282.2	and what could be a better signifier
282.2	of disembodied Western rationality
286.44	than a garment that at one end is a noose
286.44	and the other end points to the genitals?
290.88	(Laughter) (Applause)
297.64	That is mind-body dualism right there.
304.04	So making gender visible to men
308.2	is the first step to engaging men
308.2	to support gender equality.
313.04	Now, when men first hear
313.04	about gender equality,
315.4	when they first start thinking about it,
317.329	they often think, many men think,
319.84	well, that's right,
319.84	that's fair, that's just,
324.12	that's the ethical imperative.
327.12	But not all men.
328.72	Some men think --
328.72	the lightning bolt goes off,
331.44	"and they go, ""Oh my God,"
331.44	"yes, gender equality,"""
334.28	and they will immediately begin
334.28	to mansplain to you your oppression.
339.96	They see supporting gender equality
339.96	something akin to the cavalry,
344.6	"like, ""Thanks very much for bringing this"
344.6	to our attention, ladies,
347.767	"we'll take it from here."""
349.32	This results in a syndrome that I like
349.32	to call 'premature self-congratulation.'
353.76	(Laughter) (Applause)
358.08	There's another group, though,
358.08	that actively resists gender equality,
362.2	that sees gender equality
362.2	as something that is detrimental to men.
367.92	I was on a TV talk show
367.92	opposite four white men.
371.76	This is the beginning of the book
371.76	I wrote, 'Angry White Men.'
374.96	These were four angry white men
376.68	who believed that they,
376.68	white men in America,
380.56	were the victims of reverse discrimination
380.56	in the workplace.
385.84	And they all told stories
385.84	about how they were qualified for jobs,
388.92	qualified for promotions,
390.16	they didn't get them,
390.16	they were really angry.
392.44	And the reason I'm telling you this
392.44	is I want you to hear the title
395.64	of this particular show.
397.32	It was a quote from one of the men,
399.48	and the quote was,
400.92	"""A Black Woman Stole My Job."""
404.36	And they all told their stories,
405.96	qualified for jobs,
405.96	qualified for promotions,
408.12	didn't get it, really angry.
409.48	And then it was my turn to speak,
411.28	"and I said, ""I have"
411.28	just one question for you guys,
413.88	and it's about the title of the show,
416.52	'A Black Woman Stole My Job.'
418.4	Actually, it's about
418.4	one word in the title.
421.32	I want to know about the word 'my.'
423.88	Where did you get the idea
423.88	it was your job?
427.28	Why isn't the title of the show,
427.28	'A Black Woman Got the Job?'
430.6	"or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'"""
433.08	Because without confronting
433.08	men's sense of entitlement,
436.24	I don't think we'll ever understand
436.24	why so many men resist gender equality.
440.56	(Applause)
447	Look, we think this
447	is a level playing field,
450.36	so any policy that tilts it
450.36	even a little bit,
452.56	"we think, ""Oh my God,"
452.56	water's rushing uphill.
454.72	"It's reverse discrimination against us."""
456.649	(Laughter)
457.88	So let me be very clear:
459.88	white men in Europe and the United States
462.92	are the beneficiaries of the single
462.92	greatest affirmative action program
466.96	in the history of the world.
468.52	"It is called ""the history of the world."""
470.6	(Laughter) (Applause)
476.76	So, now I've established
476.76	some of the obstacles to engaging men,
481	but why should we support gender equality?
483.64	Of course, it's fair,
483.64	it's right and it's just.
487.12	But more than that,
488.6	gender equality is also
488.6	in our interest as men.
493.52	If you listen to what men say
493.52	about what they want in their lives,
498.4	gender equality is actually a way
498.4	for us to get the lives we want to live.
503.96	Gender equality is good for countries.
507.52	It turns out, according to most studies,
511.6	that those countries
511.6	that are the most gender equal
514.6	are also the countries that score highest
514.6	on the happiness scale.
519.16	And that's not just because
519.16	they're all in Europe.
521.56	(Laughter)
522.8	Even within Europe, those countries
522.8	that are more gender equal
526.559	also have the highest levels of happiness.
530.32	It is also good for companies.
532.88	Research by Catalyst and others
532.88	has shown conclusively
536.48	that the more gender-equal companies are,
540.12	the better it is for workers,
544.36	the happier their labor force is.
546.2	They have lower job turnover.
546.2	They have lower levels of attrition.
550.08	They have an easier time recruiting.
552.44	They have higher rates of retention,
552.44	higher job satisfaction,
555.4	higher rates of productivity.
557.64	So the question I'm often asked
557.64	in companies is,
560.52	"""Boy, this gender equality thing,"
560.52	"that's really going to be expensive, huh?"""
564.116	"And I say, ""Oh no, in fact,"
564.116	what you have to start calculating
568.36	is how much gender inequality
568.36	is already costing you.
572.36	"It is extremely expensive."""
574.88	So it is good for business.
577.64	And the other thing is, it's good for men.
581.04	It is good for the kind of lives
581.04	we want to live,
584.04	because young men especially
584.04	have changed enormously,
588	and they want to have lives
588	that are animated
591.2	by terrific relationships
591.2	with their children.
593.96	They expect their partners,
593.96	their spouses, their wives,
597.72	to work outside the home
598.92	and be just as committed
598.92	to their careers as they are.
602.44	I was talking, to give you
602.44	an illustration of this change --
606.28	Some of you may remember this.
608.08	When I was a lot younger,
608.08	there was a riddle that was posed to us.
613.2	Some of you may wince
613.2	to remember this riddle.
615.64	This riddle went something like this.
618.24	A man and his son
618.24	are driving on the freeway,
621.6	and they're in a terrible accident,
623.6	and the father is killed,
625.88	and the son is brought
625.88	to the hospital emergency room,
628.96	and as they're bringing the son
628.96	into the hospital emergency room,
632.04	the emergency room attending physician
632.04	sees the boy and says,
635.68	"""Oh, I can't treat him, that's my son."""
638.04	How is this possible?
640.16	We were flummoxed by this.
642.48	We could not figure this out.
644.68	(Laughter)
646.64	Well, I decided to do a little experiment
646.64	with my 16-year old son.
649.8	He had a bunch of his friends
649.8	hanging out at the house
653.28	watching a game on TV recently.
655.6	So I decided I would pose
655.6	this riddle to them,
657.84	just to see, to gauge the level of change.
660.84	Well, 16-year-old boys,
662.92	they immediately turned to me
662.92	"and said, ""It's his mom."" Right?"
666.96	No problem. Just like that.
668.76	Except for my son, who said,
668.76	"""Well, he could have two dads."""
671.64	(Laughter) (Applause)
677.16	That's an index, an indicator
677.16	of how things have changed.
681	Younger men today expect
681	to be able to balance work and family.
686.84	They want to be dual-career,
686.84	dual-carer couples.
692.16	They want to be able to balance
692.16	work and family with their partners.
695.88	They want to be involved fathers.
697.8	Now, it turns out
699.96	that the more egalitarian
699.96	our relationships,
703.36	the happier both partners are.
706.96	Data from psychologists and sociologists
706.96	are quite persuasive here.
710.92	I think we have the persuasive numbers,
710.92	the data, to prove to men
716.6	that gender equality
716.6	is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win.
720.8	Here's what the data show.
722.6	Now, when men begin
722.6	the process of engaging
728.16	with balancing work and family,
729.96	we often have two phrases
729.96	that we use to describe what we do.
733.16	We pitch in and we help out.
735.72	(Laughter)
736.96	And I'm going to propose
736.96	something a little bit more radical,
739.88	"one word: ""share."""
741.12	(Laughter)
742.88	Because here's what the data show:
744.56	when men share housework and childcare,
746.88	their children do better in school.
749.6	Their children have lower rates
749.6	of absenteeism,
752.24	higher rates of achievement.
753.8	They are less likely
753.8	to be diagnosed with ADHD.
756.56	They are less likely
756.56	to see a child psychiatrist.
759.44	They are less likely
759.44	to be put on medication.
762.08	So when men share housework and childcare,
765.92	their children are happier and healthier,
768.72	and men want this.
771.52	When men share housework and childcare,
773.96	their wives are happier. Duh.
777.72	Not only that, their wives are healthier.
780.2	Their wives are less likely
780.2	to see a therapist,
782.415	less likely to be diagnosed
782.415	with depression,
784.487	less likely to be put on medication,
784.487	more likely to go to the gym,
788.28	report higher levels
788.28	of marital satisfaction.
791.36	So when men share housework and childcare,
793.4	their wives are happier and healthier,
795.28	and men certainly want this as well.
798.76	When men share housework and childcare,
800.96	the men are healthier.
802.72	They smoke less, drink less,
802.72	take recreational drugs less often.
806.56	They are less likely to go to the ER
809.28	but more like to go to a doctor
809.28	for routine screenings.
812.48	They are less likely to see a therapist,
814.44	less likely to be diagnosed
814.44	with depression,
816.56	less likely to be taking
816.56	prescription medication.
819.08	So when men share housework and childcare,
821.12	the men are happier and healthier.
824.32	And who wouldn't want that?
826.64	And finally,
827.92	when men share housework and childcare,
829.88	they have more sex.
831.12	(Laughter)
832.56	Now, of these four fascinating findings,
835	which one do you think
835	Men's Health magazine put on its cover?
837.96	(Laughter)
840.6	"""Housework Makes Her Horny."
843.8	"(Not When She Does It.)"""
845.04	(Laughter)
846.72	Now, I will say,
849	just to remind the men in the audience,
852	these data were collected
852	over a really long period of time,
855.84	so I don't want listeners to say,
858.68	"""Hmm, OK, I think"
858.68	"I'll do the dishes tonight."""
861.72	These data were collected
861.72	over a really long period of time.
865.72	But I think it shows something important,
869.4	that when Men's Health magazine
869.4	put it on their cover,
871.96	they also called,
871.96	"you'll love this, ""Choreplay."""
875.44	So, what we found
875.44	is something really important,
880.24	that gender equality
882.36	is in the interest of countries,
885.44	of companies, and of men,
888.6	and their children and their partners,
891.16	that gender equality
891.16	is not a zero-sum game.
893.64	It's not a win-lose.
894.92	It is a win-win for everyone.
898.16	And what we also know
900.44	is we cannot fully empower women and girls
904.04	unless we engage boys and men.
906.72	We know this.
909.32	And my position is
910.8	that men need the very things
910.8	that women have identified
915.04	that they need to live the lives
915.04	they say they want to live
918.12	in order to live the lives
918.12	that we say we want to live.
922.6	In 1915, on the eve of one
922.6	of the great suffrage demonstrations
927.84	down Fifth Avenue in New York City,
929.84	a writer in New York
929.84	wrote an article in a magazine,
933.52	and the title of the article was,
936.56	"""Feminism for Men."""
939.28	And this was the first line
939.28	of that article:
942.16	"""Feminism will make it possible"
942.16	"for the first time for men to be free."""
947.16	Thank you.
948.4	(Applause)
