15.863	So, this book that I have in my hand
18.929	is a directory of everybody who had an email address
22.863	in 1982. (Laughter)
26.382	Actually, it's deceptively large.
30.067	There's actually only about 20 people on each page,
33.504	because we have the name, address
35.394	and telephone number of every single person.
38.487	And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,
40.67	because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.
45.228	Obviously a very small community.
48.129	There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then.
51.56	I knew them both.
53.16	We didn't all know each other,
54.916	but we all kind of trusted each other,
58.029	and that basic feeling of trust
61.827	permeated the whole network,
64.414	and there was a real sense that
66.771	we could depend on each other to do things.
69.777	So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community,
73.352	let me tell you what it was like
74.977	to register a domain name in the early days.
79.082	Now, it just so happened that I got to register
81.712	the third domain name on the Internet.
84.172	So I could have anything I wanted
85.82	other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
90.265	So I picked think.com, but then I thought,
93.679	you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there.
96.665	Maybe I should register a few extras just in case.
100.874	"And then I thought, ""Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."""
104.158	(Laughter)
109.853	That attitude of only taking what you need
113.482	was really what everybody had on the network in those days,
117.526	and in fact, it wasn't just the people on the network,
120.823	but it was actually kind of built into the protocols
123.543	of the Internet itself.
125.487	So the basic idea of I.P., or Internet protocol,
129.346	and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it,
133.075	"were fundamentally ""from each according to their ability,"
137.204	"to each according to their need."""
139.322	And so, if you had some extra bandwidth,
142.335	you'd deliver a message for someone.
143.778	If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.
146.771	You'd kind of depend on people to do that,
148.785	and that was the building block.
151.449	It was actually interesting that such a communist principle
154.076	was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War
156.512	by the Defense Department,
158.943	but it obviously worked really well,
162.013	and we all saw what happened with the Internet.
165.456	It was incredibly successful.
167.728	In fact, it was so successful that there's no way
171.025	that these days you could make a book like this.
174.613	My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick.
180.779	But, of course, you couldn't do it,
181.953	because we don't know the names of all the people
183.743	with Internet or email addresses,
186.817	and even if we did know their names,
188.349	I'm pretty sure that they would not want their name,
190.782	address and telephone number published to everyone.
195.078	So the fact is that there's a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days,
198.78	and so we dealt with that by making
202.951	walled communities,
204.85	secure subnetworks, VPNs,
209.587	little things that aren't really the Internet
211.183	but are made out of the same building blocks,
213.154	but we're still basically building it out of those
215.394	same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust.
219.661	And that means that it's vulnerable
222.383	to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen,
224.779	or certain kinds of deliberate attacks,
226.64	but even the mistakes can be bad.
229.745	So, for instance,
232.694	in all of Asia recently,
234.647	it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while
238.08	because Pakistan made some mistakes
240.36	in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.
244.095	They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did
247.189	because of the way that the protocols work.
250.093	Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is,
253.317	you may remember a couple of years ago,
255.908	all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded
258.721	because a single routing card in Salt Lake City
261.613	had a bug in it.
263.975	Now, you don't really think
266.248	that our airplane system depends on the Internet,
269.274	and in some sense it doesn't.
270.28	I'll come back to that later.
271.896	But the fact is that people couldn't take off
274.146	because something was going wrong on the Internet,
276.421	and the router card was down.
278.996	And so, there are many of those things that start to happen.
282.775	Now, there was an interesting thing that happened last April.
285.914	All of a sudden,
287.44	a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet,
290.772	including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations,
294.903	started getting re-routed through China.
297.671	So for a few hours, it all passed through China.
300.393	Now, China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake,
304.967	and it is actually possible that it was, the way things work,
308.824	but certainly somebody could make
310.859	a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to,
314.132	and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes.
317.49	Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks.
322.411	So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States
325.809	or Western civilization these days,
327.901	they're not going to do it with tanks.
330.09	That will not succeed.
332.503	What they'll probably do is something
334.506	very much like the attack that happened
337.797	on the Iranian nuclear facility.
340.504	Nobody has claimed credit for that.
342.778	There was basically a factory of industrial machines.
346.285	It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
348.862	It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet,
351.449	but it was possible for somebody to smuggle
353.396	a USB drive in there, or something like that,
355.928	and software got in there that causes the centrifuges,
359.324	in that case, to actually destroy themselves.
362.317	Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery
364.983	or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant.
369.405	And so there's a lot of -- I'm sure you've read a lot in papers,
372.671	about worries about cyberattacks
374.862	and defenses against those.
377.472	But the fact is, people are mostly focused on
379.452	defending the computers on the Internet,
381.735	and there's been surprisingly little attention
384.121	to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium.
388.486	And I think we probably do need to pay
390.349	some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.
393.437	So actually, in the early days,
396.364	back when it was the ARPANET,
398.088	there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely
401.677	because one single message processor
404.962	actually got a bug in it.
407.438	And the way the Internet works is
409.71	the routers are basically exchanging information
413.277	about how they can get messages to places,
415.867	and this one processor, because of a broken card,
419.765	decided it could actually get a message
421.774	to some place in negative time.
424.462	So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
428.445	So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere
431.595	was to send it to this guy,
433.471	who would send it back in time and get it there super early,
437.018	so every message in the Internet
439.874	started getting switched through this one node,
443.116	and of course that clogged everything up.
444.632	Everything started breaking.
446.787	The interesting thing was, though,
448.827	that the sysadmins were able to fix it,
450.667	but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off.
455.449	Now, of course you couldn't do that today.
456.847	I mean, everything off, it's like
459.241	the service call you get from the cable company,
461.473	except for the whole world.
465.234	Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
467.293	One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones
469.915	use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on
472.884	that go through the Internet right now,
474.953	and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it
478.235	for more and more different things,
480.027	like when you take off from LAX,
482.965	you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.
484.846	When you pump gas, you really don't think you're using the Internet.
488.962	What's happening increasingly, though, is these systems
491.087	are beginning to use the Internet.
492.954	Most of them aren't based on the Internet yet,
496.004	but they're starting to use the Internet for service functions,
498.54	for administrative functions,
500.445	and so if you take something like the cell phone system,
503.508	which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part,
507.828	Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it
510.787	in terms of some of the control and administrative functions,
514.591	and it's so tempting to use these same building blocks
516.921	because they work so well, they're cheap,
519.185	they're repeated, and so on.
520.285	So all of our systems, more and more,
523.057	are starting to use the same technology
524.837	and starting to depend on this technology.
526.904	And so even a modern rocket ship these days
529.329	actually uses Internet protocol to talk
532.055	from one end of the rocket ship to the other.
533.871	That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.
537.057	So we've built this system
540.174	where we understand all the parts of it,
543.284	but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it,
546.982	and it's gotten a very, very different scale
549.421	than it was designed for.
551.592	And in fact, nobody really exactly understands
554.268	all the things it's being used for right now.
556.531	It's turning into one of these big emergent systems
559.034	like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts
562.515	but nobody really exactly understands
565.121	how it operates and all the little details of it
568.348	and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.
571.067	And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet
574.2	and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that,
576.895	you should treat it with the same skepticism
579.356	that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy
583.771	or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
586.038	They have an informed opinion,
588.686	but it's changing so quickly that even the experts
591.227	don't know exactly what's going on.
593.045	So if you see one of these maps of the Internet,
595.737	it's just somebody's guess.
597.403	Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now
599.601	because it's different than it was an hour ago.
602.342	It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.
605.143	And the problem with it is,
606.657	I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster
609.998	like the disaster we had in the financial system,
612.793	where we take a system that's basically built on trust,
618.137	was basically built for a smaller-scale system,
620.758	and we've kind of expanded it way beyond the limits
623.667	of how it was meant to operate.
625.663	And so right now, I think it's literally true
628.931	that we don't know what the consequences
632.436	of an effective denial-of-service attack
634.87	on the Internet would be,
636.643	and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year,
638.517	and worse next year, and so on.
639.925	But so what we need is a plan B.
642.474	There is no plan B right now.
644.106	There's no clear backup system that we've very carefully kept
647.609	to be independent of the Internet,
649.555	made out of completely different sets of building blocks.
652.621	So what we need is something that doesn't necessarily
655.634	have to have the performance of the Internet,
658.368	but the police department has to be able
659.885	to call up the fire department even without the Internet,
662.408	or the hospitals have to order fuel oil.
664.973	This doesn't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project.
669.587	It's actually relatively simple to do, technically,
672.335	because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground,
676.137	existing wireless infrastructure.
678.096	It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
680.861	But people won't decide to do it
683.345	until they recognize the need for it,
685.724	and that's the problem that we have right now.
687.222	So there's been plenty of people,
690.005	plenty of us have been quietly arguing
693.049	that we should have this independent system for years,
695.967	but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B
698.976	when plan A seems to be working so well.
702.65	So I think that, if people understand
706.079	how much we're starting to depend on the Internet,
709.133	and how vulnerable it is,
711.11	we could get focused on
713.216	just wanting this other system to exist,
716.24	"and I think if enough people say, ""Yeah, I would like to use it,"
719.317	"I'd like to have such a system,"" then it will get built."
722.327	It's not that hard a problem.
723.75	It could definitely be done by people in this room.
726.985	And so I think that this is actually,
731.344	of all the problems you're going to hear about at the conference,
734.523	this is probably one of the very easiest to fix.
737.201	So I'm happy to get a chance to tell you about it.
739.968	Thank you very much.
742.579	(Applause)
