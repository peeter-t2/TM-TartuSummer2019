25	What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
31	Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is
37	something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy
39	is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building
44	that bridge to the future, to the point where we
46	can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or
49	put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or
54	do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how
57	we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do
60	that, you really have to look first at agriculture.
63	So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And
67	in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn
70	from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,
73	you've got to deal with all types of awful things,
76	you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure
77	that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then
81	you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
84	You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation
87	makes a difference.
89	Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant
91	stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the
94	rivers flood. You start getting this organic
96	agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this
100	stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,
103	leads to very large-scale agriculture.
106	You put together machines and water, and you get
110	landscapes that look like this. And then you get
114	sales that look like this. It's brute force. So
118	what you've been doing in agriculture is you start
120	out with something that's a reasonably natural
122	system. You start taming that natural system. You
124	put a lot of force behind that natural system. You
127	put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --
131	(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you
139	end up with systems that look like this.
143	And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've
146	been approaching energy. So the lesson in
149	agriculture is that you can actually change the
152	system that's based on brute force as you start
155	merging that system and learning that system and
157	actually applying biology. And you move from a
160	discipline of engineering, you move from a
162	discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of
164	biology. And probably one of the most important
168	human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
171	This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the
173	Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of
175	Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he
179	deserves this stuff because he probably has fed
181	more people than any other human being alive
184	because he researched how to put biology behind
187	seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India
192	and China no longer have these massive famines is
195	because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow
197	grains in a more efficient way and launched the
200	Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of
203	people have criticized. But of course, those are
204	people who don't realize that China and India,
207	instead of having huge amounts of starving people,
210	are exporting grains.
212	And the irony of this particular system is the
214	place where he did the research, which was Mexico,
217	didn't adopt this technology, ignored this
219	technology, talked about why this technology
222	should be thought about, but not really applied.
224	And Mexico remains one of the largest grain
227	importers on the planet because it doesn't apply
230	technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in
233	fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point
235	where there aren't statues of this man all over
238	Mexico. There are in China and India. And the
241	Institute that this guy ran has now moved to
243	India. That is the difference between adopting
247	technologies and discussing technologies.
250	Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount
254	of people in the world. It's that this is the net
257	effect in terms of what technology does, if you
260	understand biology.
263	What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take
264	agriculture over a century, agriculture in about
270	planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look
273	different. The machines were tractors or stuff
277	instead of mules, but the farmer would have
280	understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is
282	why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What
285	really started to change in agriculture is when
287	you started moving from this brute force
289	engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's
291	where you get your productivity increases. And as
294	you do that stuff, here's what happens to
297	productivity.
298	Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100
301	bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor
306	productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,
311	whereas the rest of the economy increased about
313	2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase
314	in how much is produced per person.
320	The effect of this, of course, is it's not just
322	amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
326	And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize
328	agriculture from mountains of stuff that people
331	have overproduced.
334	This would be a good outcome for energy. And of
337	course, by now, you're probably saying to
339	"yourself, ""Self, I thought I came to a talk about"
344	"energy and here's this guy talking about biology."""
349	So where's the link between these two things?
352	One of the ironies of this whole system is we're
354	discussing what to do about a system that we don't
356	understand. We don't even know what oil is. We
361	don't know where oil comes from. I mean,
363	literally, it's still a source of debate what
365	this black river of stuff is and where it comes
368	from. The best assumption, and one of the best
371	guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
374	out of this stuff, that these things absorb
378	sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of
381	years, and you get these black rivers.
386	Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if
388	that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,
392	and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be
394	concentrated sunlight. And if you think of
398	bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is
401	taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,
404	concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why
407	you get these rainbows.
410	And as you're looking at this system, if
413	hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then
417	bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got
421	to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as
425	part of these solar panels.
429	Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly
431	over west Texas, the types of wells that you're
435	beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures
439	of Kansas and those irrigated plots.
443	This is how you farm oil. And as you think of
445	farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started
449	with this brute force approach. And then what did
453	we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And
456	then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even
459	bigger. And we are getting really destructive as
463	we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
467	These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an
469	enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest
472	trucks in the world are working here, and then
475	you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is
477	basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the
480	sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to
482	separate it, which only works at today's oil
485	prices.
487	Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same
491	stuff. It is probably plants, except that these
495	have been burned and crushed under pressure.
499	So you take something like this, you burn it, you
501	put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get
503	this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
506	Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But
509	as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat
512	kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
517	And of course, coalmines are very dangerous
520	places because in some of these coalmines, you
523	get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So
530	you're producing a biogas out of coal in some
532	mines, but not in others.
535	Any place you see a differential, there're some
537	interesting questions. There's some questions as
540	to what you should be doing with this stuff. But
542	again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same
546	system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying
548	exactly the same technology.
550	Here's your brute force approach. Once you get
553	through your brute force approach, then you just
554	rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with
558	the single largest source of carbon emissions,
561	which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably
565	not the best use of bioenergy.
569	As you think of what are the alternatives to this
571	system -- it's important to find alternatives
574	because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in
577	its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in
579	its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge
584	coal reserves that are sitting out there, and
587	we've got to start thinking of them as biological
589	energy, because if we keep treating them as
591	chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're
594	going to be in deep doo-doo.
599	Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological
604	product. And as you think of gas, well, you're
609	familiar with gas. And here's a different way of
614	mining coal.
617	This is called coal bed methane. Why is this
620	picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to
623	be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may
627	get a differential in gas output between one mine
631	and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up
633	and another one may not blow up -- may be because
636	there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
642	This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You
647	eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It
652	may turn out that biological processes in coalmines
655	have the same process. If that is true, then
658	one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal
660	may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it
664	may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff
668	process that coal in a biological fashion as you
671	did in agriculture.
674	That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It
678	is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not
681	importing corn into Iowa because you've built so
684	many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to
687	understand the transition that occurred in
689	agriculture, from brute force into biological
692	force. And in the measure that you can do that,
694	you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it
695	pretty quickly.
697	We already have some indicators of productivity on
700	this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields
704	or petroleum fields that have been running for
707	decades, you can get a really substantial
709	increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your
712	output. This is just the beginning stages of this
716	stuff.
717	And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who
719	did part of the sequencing of the human genome,
722	who just doubled the databases of genes and
724	proteins known on earth by sailing around the
726	world -- has been thinking about how you structure
730	this. And there's a series of smart people
731	thinking about this. And they've been putting
734	together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,
736	a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are
740	trying to do is to think of, how do you apply
743	biological principles to avoid brute force?
747	Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as
750	beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
754	Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the
757	genes as a software. And in the measure that you
760	begin to think of life as code that is
763	interchangeable, that can become energy, that can
766	become food, that can become fiber, that can
768	become human beings, that can become a whole
770	series of things, then you've got to shift your
773	approach as to how you're going to structure and
775	deal and think about energy in a very different
779	way.
781	What are the first principles of this stuff and
783	where are we heading? This is one of the gentle
786	giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human
789	beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton
792	Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to
795	cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.
800	He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such
802	a modest guy that the day he won, his mother
805	"called him and said, ""I didn't realize there was"
808	another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just
810	"won the Nobel?"" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,"
818	but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find
821	him at the bench every single day, working on a
824	pipette and building stuff. And one of the things
828	this guy just built are these things.
830	What is this? This is the first transplant of
832	naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating
835	system out of one cell, insert it into a different
838	cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate
841	species. That's one month old. You will see stuff
847	in the next month that will be just as important
849	as this stuff.
851	And as you think about this stuff and what the
853	implications of this are, we're going to start not
856	just converting ethanol from corn with very high
861	subsidies. We're going to start thinking about
863	biology entering energy. It is very expensive to
868	process this stuff, both in economic terms and in
872	energy terms.
874	This is what accumulates in the tar sands of
876	Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you
880	separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an
883	enormous amount of energy inside that vapor --
887	steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to
889	separate out the sulfur. The difference between
891	light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14
894	bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these
897	pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the
899	scale on these things is pretty large.
903	Now, if you can take part of the energy content
905	out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you
909	really do start applying biological principles to
911	energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where
916	you can get to wind, to the point where you can
918	get to solar, to the point where you can get to
920	nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next
923	nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an
926	earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.
935	But in the meantime, for the next decade at least,
939	the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that
942	oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're
946	dealing with. And before I make this talk too
950	long, here's what's happening in the current
955	energy system.
959	hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're
962	consuming are probably processed plants and
965	amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a
968	role in here for conservation. There's a role in
970	here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to
972	get that other portion right.
975	How we deal with that other portion is our bridge
977	to the future. And as we think of this bridge to
980	the future, one of the things you should ponder
983	is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today
986	inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous
989	amount of money and leaving most of the energy
992	down there. Which, of course, requires more energy
995	to go out and get energy. The ratios become
998	idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may
1000	even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and
1003	the energy output. That is a stupid way of
1006	managing this system.
1009	Last point, last graph. One of the things that
1013	we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This
1017	is what oil prices look like, OK?
1019	This is a very bad system because what happens is
1022	your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up
1025	with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for
1028	wind, or for something else, and then guess what?
1030	The oil price goes through the floor. That company
1032	goes out of business, and then you can bring the
1034	oil price back up.
1036	So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,
1040	let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the
1042	United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put
1047	a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it
1049	basically says for the next 20 years, the price of
1053	oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40
1056	bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax
1060	it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax
1063	goes away.
1066	What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it
1067	do for companies? It tells people, if you can
1070	produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or
1073	less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks
1075	a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a
1079	business. But let's not put people through this
1081	cycle where it doesn't pay to research because
1084	your company will go out of business as OPEC
1086	drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from
1089	happening. Thank you.
