12.714	Hi. I'm going to talk 
12.714	to you today about laughter,
15.918	and I just want to start 
15.918	by thinking about the first time
18.707	I can ever remember noticing laughter.
20.736	This is when I was a little girl.
20.736	I would've been about six.
23.558	And I came across my parents
23.558	doing something unusual,
27.113	where they were laughing.
28.619	They were laughing very, very hard.
30.686	They were lying on the floor laughing.
32.59	They were screaming with laughter.
34.54	I did not know what they were 
34.54	laughing at, but I wanted in.
38.767	I wanted to be part of that,
40.471	and I kind of sat around at the edge
40.471	"going, ""Hoo hoo!"" (Laughter)"
43.57	Now, incidentally,
43.57	what they were laughing at
47.009	was a song which people used to sing,
49.609	which was based around
49.609	signs in toilets on trains
53.255	telling you what you could
53.255	and could not do
56.25	in toilets on trains.
57.69	And the thing you have to remember
57.69	about the English is, of course,
60.893	we do have an immensely
60.893	sophisticated sense of humor.
63.616	(Laughter)
64.775	At the time, though, I didn't
64.775	understand anything of that.
67.508	I just cared about the laughter,
69.067	and actually, as a neuroscientist,
69.067	I've come to care about it again.
72.419	And it is a really weird thing to do.
75.176	What I'm going to do now
75.176	is just play some examples
77.593	of real human beings laughing,
79.144	and I want you think about the sound
79.144	people make and how odd that can be,
82.627	and in fact how primitive
82.627	laughter is as a sound.
85.204	It's much more like an animal call
85.204	than it is like speech.
88.013	So here we've got some laughter for you.
88.013	The first one is pretty joyful.
91.487	(Audio: Laughing)
107.406	Now this next guy, I need him to breathe.
110.081	There's a point in there
110.081	where I'm just, like,
112.233	you've got to get some air in there, mate,
114.255	because he just sounds
114.255	like he's breathing out.
116.46	(Audio: Laughing)
125.187	This hasn't been edited; this is him.
128.182	(Audio: Laughing)
128.182	(Laughter)
134.544	And finally we have -- 
134.544	this is a human female laughing.
138.283	And laughter can take us to some pretty
138.283	odd places in terms of making noises.
142.346	(Audio: Laughing)
161.953	"She actually says, ""Oh my God,"
161.953	"what is that?"" in French."
164.613	We're all kind of with her.
164.613	I have no idea.
168.179	Now, to understand laughter,
168.179	you have to look at a part of the body
171.606	that psychologists and neuroscientists
171.606	don't normally spend much time looking at,
175.43	which is the ribcage,
176.495	and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,
178.311	but actually you're all using 
178.311	your ribcage all the time.
180.99	What you're all doing 
180.99	at the moment with your ribcage,
183.573	and don't stop doing it, is breathing.
185.413	So you use the intercostal muscles,
185.413	the muscles between your ribs,
188.563	to bring air in and out of your lungs
190.34	just by expanding
190.34	and contracting your ribcage,
192.53	and if I was to put a strap 
192.53	around the outside of your chest
195.408	called a breath belt, and just look 
195.408	at that movement,
197.978	you see a rather gentle sinusoidal
197.978	movement, so that's breathing.
201.132	You're all doing it. Don't stop.
202.71	As soon as you start talking,
204.104	you start using your breathing
204.104	completely differently.
206.731	So what I'm doing now is you see
206.731	something much more like this.
209.678	In talking, you use very fine
209.678	movements of the ribcage
212.271	to squeeze the air out --
213.651	and in fact, we're the only animals
213.651	that can do this.
216.14	It's why we can talk at all.
217.681	Now, both talking and breathing
217.681	has a mortal enemy,
220.843	and that enemy is laughter,
223.209	because what happens when you laugh
225.658	is those same muscles
225.658	start to contract very regularly,
228.959	and you get this very marked
228.959	sort of zig-zagging,
231.377	and that's just squeezing
231.377	the air out of you.
233.56	It literally is that basic a way
233.56	of making a sound.
236.027	You could be stamping on somebody,
236.027	it's having the same effect.
239.023	You're just squeezing air out,
240.507	and each of those contractions --
240.507	Ha! -- gives you a sound.
243.34	And as the contractions run together,
243.34	you can get these spasms,
246.303	and that's when you start getting
246.303	these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.
250.083	I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)
253.577	Now, in terms of the science of laughter,
253.577	there isn't very much,
257.802	but it does turn out that pretty much
257.802	everything we think we know
260.85	about laughter is wrong.
263.042	So it's not at all unusual, for example,
263.042	to hear people to say
265.998	humans are the only animals that laugh.
268.001	Nietzsche thought that humans
268.001	are the only animals that laugh.
270.934	In fact, you find laughter
270.934	throughout the mammals.
273.387	It's been well-described
273.387	and well-observed in primates,
275.973	but you also see it in rats,
277.377	and wherever you find it --
278.683	humans, primates, rats --
280.789	you find it associated
280.789	with things like tickling.
283.808	That's the same for humans.
286.896	You find it associated with play,
286.896	and all mammals play.
291.563	And wherever you find it,
291.563	it's associated with interactions.
295.557	So Robert Provine, who has done
295.557	a lot of work on this,
298.147	has pointed out that you are 30 times 
298.147	more likely to laugh
302.987	if you are with somebody else
302.987	than if you're on your own,
306.353	and where you find most laughter
308.257	is in social interactions
308.257	like conversation.
310.984	So if you ask human beings,
310.984	"""When do you laugh?"""
313.226	they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk
313.226	about humor and they'll talk about jokes.
317.177	If you look at when they laugh,
317.177	they're laughing with their friends.
320.376	And when we laugh with people, we're
320.376	hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.
323.963	You are laughing to show people
323.963	that you understand them,
326.626	that you agree with them, that you're
326.626	part of the same group as them.
329.874	You're laughing to show
329.874	that you like them.
331.873	You might even love them.
333.078	You're doing all that at the same time
333.078	as talking to them,
335.788	and the laughter is doing a lot
335.788	of that emotional work for you.
338.808	Something that Robert Provine
338.808	has pointed out, as you can see here,
341.986	and the reason why we were laughing
343.665	when we heard those
343.665	funny laughs at the start,
345.806	and why I was laughing
345.806	when I found my parents laughing,
348.511	is that it's an enormously
348.511	behaviorally contagious effect.
351.346	You can catch laughter from somebody else,
353.44	and you are more likely to catch laughter
353.44	off somebody else if you know them.
357.099	So it's still modulated
357.099	by this social context.
359.358	You have to put humor to one side
360.946	and think about the social 
360.946	meaning of laughter
363.167	because that's where its origins lie.
365.255	Now, something I've got very interested in
365.255	is different kinds of laughter,
369.435	and we have some neurobiological evidence
369.435	about how human beings vocalize
374.148	that suggests there might be
374.148	two kinds of laughs that we have.
378.281	So it seems possible that the neurobiology
378.281	for helpless, involuntary laughter,
383.227	like my parents lying on the floor
383.227	screaming about a silly song,
386.431	might have a different basis to it
386.431	than some of that more polite
389.465	social laughter that you encounter,
389.465	which isn't horrible laughter,
392.631	but it's behavior somebody is doing
392.631	as part of their communicative act to you,
396.949	part of their interaction with you;
396.949	they are choosing to do this.
400.05	In our evolution, we have developed
400.05	two different ways of vocalizing.
403.439	Involuntary vocalizations
403.439	are part of an older system
406.356	than the more voluntary vocalizations
406.356	like the speech I'm doing now.
409.559	So we might imagine that laughter
409.559	might actually have two different roots.
413.04	So I've been looking at this
413.04	in more detail.
415.088	To do this, we've had to make
415.088	recordings of people laughing,
418.311	and we've had to do whatever it takes
418.311	to make people laugh,
421.088	and we got those same people
421.088	to produce more posed, social laughter.
424.297	So imagine your friend told a joke,
425.965	and you're laughing because
425.965	you like your friend,
428.253	but not really because
428.253	the joke's all that.
430.261	So I'm going to play you 
430.261	a couple of those.
432.354	I want you to tell me if you think
432.354	this laughter is real laughter,
435.507	or if you think it's posed.
436.806	So is this involuntary laughter
436.806	or more voluntary laughter?
439.742	(Audio: Laughing)
444.622	What does that sound like to you?
446.237	Audience: Posed.
446.237	Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.
448.31	How about this one?
449.819	(Audio: Laughing)
454.37	(Laughter)
455.802	I'm the best.
457.218	(Laughter) (Applause)
459.857	Not really.
461.593	No, that was helpless laughter,
463.843	and in fact, to record that,
463.843	all they had to do was record me
467.118	watching one of my friends listening to
467.118	something I knew she wanted to laugh at,
470.895	and I just started doing this.
472.365	What you find is that people
472.365	are good at telling the difference
475.582	between real and posed laughter.
477.127	They seem to be different things to us.
479.041	Interestingly, you see something
479.041	quite similar with chimpanzees.
482.073	Chimpanzees laugh differently
482.073	if they're being tickled
484.621	than if they're playing with each other,
486.59	and we might be seeing
486.59	something like that here,
488.852	involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
488.852	being different from social laughter.
492.546	They're acoustically very different.
494.287	The real laughs are longer.
494.287	They're higher in pitch.
496.779	When you start laughing hard,
498.198	you start squeezing air out
498.198	from your lungs
500.251	under much higher pressures
500.251	than you could ever produce voluntarily.
503.442	For example, I could never
503.442	pitch my voice that high to sing.
506.364	Also, you start to get these sort of
506.364	contractions and weird whistling sounds,
510.032	all of which mean that real laughter
510.032	is extremely easy,
512.798	or feels extremely easy to spot.
514.87	In contrast, posed laughter,
514.87	we might think it sounds a bit fake.
519.952	Actually, it's not, it's actually
519.952	an important social cue.
522.692	We use it a lot, we're choosing
522.692	to laugh in a lot of situations,
525.769	and it seems to be its own thing.
527.382	So, for example, you find
527.382	nasality in posed laughter,
530.169	"that kind of ""ha ha ha ha ha"" sound"
532.276	that you never get, you could not do,
532.276	if you were laughing involuntarily.
535.723	So they do seem to be genuinely
535.723	these two different sorts of things.
538.955	We took it into the scanner
538.955	to see how brains respond
541.505	when you hear laughter.
542.717	And when you do this,
542.717	this is a really boring experiment.
545.385	We just played people
545.385	real and posed laughs.
547.43	We didn't tell them
547.43	it was a study on laughter.
549.634	We put other sounds in there 
549.634	to distract them,
551.833	and all they're doing
551.833	is lying listening to sounds.
554.22	We don't tell them to do anything.
555.863	Nonetheless, when you hear real laughter
555.863	and when you hear posed laughter,
559.337	the brains are responding
559.337	completely differently,
561.754	significantly differently.
563.186	What you see in the regions in blue,
563.186	which lies in auditory cortex,
566.734	are the brain areas that respond
566.734	more to the real laughs,
569.423	and what seems to be the case,
570.864	when you hear somebody
570.864	laughing involuntarily,
573.021	you hear sounds you would never
573.021	hear in any other context.
575.748	It's very unambiguous,
576.834	and it seems to be associated
576.834	with greater auditory processing
579.904	of these novel sounds.
581.274	In contrast, when you hear somebody
581.274	laughing in a posed way,
585.083	what you see are these regions in pink,
587.125	which are occupying brain areas
587.125	associated with mentalizing,
590.004	thinking about what
590.004	somebody else is thinking.
592.159	And I think what that means is,
593.699	even if you're having your brain scanned,
593.699	which is completely boring
596.896	and not very interesting,
598.096	when you hear somebody going,
598.096	"""A ha ha ha ha ha,"""
600.429	you're trying to work out
600.429	why they're laughing.
602.625	Laughter is always meaningful.
604.07	You are always trying
604.07	to understand it in context,
606.41	even if, as far as you are concerned,
606.41	at that point in time,
609.276	it has not necessarily
609.276	anything to do with you,
611.463	you still want to know
611.463	why those people are laughing.
614.135	Now, we've had the opportunity to look 
614.135	at how people hear real and posed laughter
618.001	across the age range.
619.064	So this is an online experiment
619.064	we ran with the Royal Society,
621.995	and here we just asked people
621.995	two questions.
624.099	First of all, they heard some laughs,
625.927	and they had to say, how real 
625.927	or posed do these laughs sound?
628.946	The real laughs are shown in red
628.946	and the posed laughs are shown in blue.
632.403	What you see is there is a rapid onset.
634.3	As you get older, you get better
634.3	and better at spotting real laughter.
637.652	So six-year-olds are at chance,
637.652	they can't really hear the difference.
640.977	By the time you are older, you get better,
643.129	but interestingly, you do not hit
643.129	peak performance in this dataset
646.751	until you are in your
646.751	late 30s and early 40s.
650.282	You don't understand laughter fully
650.282	by the time you hit puberty.
653.323	You don't understand laughter fully
653.323	by the time your brain has matured
656.62	at the end of your teens.
658.014	You're learning about laughter
658.014	throughout your entire early adult life.
661.812	If we turn the question around and now say
661.812	not, what does the laughter sound like
665.614	in terms of being real
665.614	or posed, but we say,
667.666	how much does this laughter
667.666	make you want to laugh,
670.15	how contagious is this laughter to you,
670.15	we see a different profile.
673.365	And here, the younger you are,
674.868	the more you want to join in
674.868	when you hear laughter.
677.302	Remember me laughing with my parents
677.302	when I had no idea what was going on.
680.795	You really can see this.
682.021	Now everybody, young and old,
683.416	finds the real laughs more contagious
683.416	than the posed laughs,
686.261	but as you get older, it all becomes 
686.261	less contagious to you.
689.171	Now, either we're all just becoming
689.171	really grumpy as we get older,
693.375	or it may mean that as you
693.375	understand laughter better,
696.304	and you are getting better at doing that,
698.393	you need more than just
698.393	hearing people laugh to want to laugh.
701.339	You need the social stuff there.
703.986	So we've got a very interesting behavior
705.96	about which a lot of our
705.96	lay assumptions are incorrect,
709.113	but I'm coming to see that actually
709.113	there's even more to laughter
712.964	than it's an important social emotion
712.964	we should look at,
715.695	because it turns out
715.695	people are phenomenally nuanced
718.614	in terms of how we use laughter.
720.201	There's a really lovely
720.201	set of studies coming out
722.485	from Robert Levenson's lab in California,
724.579	where he's doing
724.579	a longitudinal study with couples.
727.055	He gets married couples,
727.055	men and women, into the lab,
729.838	and he gives them
729.838	stressful conversations to have
732.132	while he wires them up to a polygraph
732.132	so he can see them becoming stressed.
735.664	So you've got the two of them in there,
735.664	and he'll say to the husband,
738.899	"""Tell me something that your wife does"
738.899	"that irritates you."""
741.681	And what you see is immediately --
743.297	just run that one through your head
743.297	briefly, you and your partner --
746.624	you can imagine everybody gets a bit
746.624	more stressed as soon as that starts.
750.772	You can see physically,
750.772	people become more stressed.
753.396	What he finds is that the couples
753.396	who manage that feeling of stress
759.178	with laughter,
759.178	positive emotions like laughter,
762.684	not only immediately become less stressed,
766.492	they can see them
766.492	physically feeling better,
768.906	they're dealing with this
768.906	unpleasant situation better together,
772.064	they are also the couples that report
773.885	high levels of satisfaction
773.885	in their relationship
776.244	and they stay together for longer.
777.915	So in fact, when you look
777.915	at close relationships,
780.236	laughter is a phenomenally useful index
782.134	of how people are regulating
782.134	their emotions together.
784.607	We're not just emitting it at each other
784.607	to show that we like each other,
788.032	we're making ourselves
788.032	feel better together.
790.087	Now, I don't think this is going
790.087	to be limited to romantic relationships.
793.538	I think this is probably
793.538	going to be a characteristic
796.011	of close emotional relationships
796.011	such as you might have with friends,
799.329	which explains my next clip,
801.158	which is of a YouTube video of some
801.158	young men in the former East Germany
804.803	on making a video to promote
804.803	their heavy metal band,
808.309	and it's extremely macho,
808.309	and the mood is very serious,
811.211	and I want you to notice
811.211	what happens in terms of laughter
814.323	when things go wrong
816.273	and how quickly that happens,
816.273	and how that changes the mood.
821.869	He's cold. He's about to get wet.
821.869	He's got swimming trunks on,
824.911	got a towel.
828.649	Ice.
830.321	What might possibly happen?
834.593	Video starts.
837.663	Serious mood.
846.744	And his friends are already laughing.
846.744	They are already laughing, hard.
851.249	He's not laughing yet.
854.863	(Laughter)
856.512	He's starting to go now.
865.461	And now they're all off.
867.518	(Laughter)
884.653	They're on the floor.
886.395	(Laughter)
895.727	The thing I really like about that
895.727	is it's all very serious
899.039	until he jumps onto the ice, and
899.039	as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,
902.764	but also there isn't blood
902.764	and bone everywhere,
905.027	his friends start laughing.
906.6	And imagine if that had played him out
906.6	with him standing there going,
909.992	"""No seriously, Heinrich,"
909.992	"I think this is broken,"""
912.436	we wouldn't enjoy watching that.
912.436	That would be stressful.
915.186	Or if he was running around
915.186	with a visibly broken leg laughing,
918.179	"and his friends are going, ""Heinrich, I"
918.179	"think we need to go to the hospital now,"""
922.01	that also wouldn't be funny.
923.407	The fact that the laughter works,
925.069	it gets him from a painful,
925.069	embarrassing, difficult situation,
928.031	into a funny situation, into what we're 
928.031	actually enjoying there,
931.116	and I think that's 
931.116	a really interesting use,
933.303	and it's actually happening all the time.
935.281	For example, I can remember
935.281	something like this happening
937.972	at my father's funeral.
939.169	We weren't jumping around
939.169	on the ice in our underpants.
941.784	We're not Canadian.
944.425	(Laughter) (Applause)
946.924	These events are always difficult, I had
946.924	a relative who was being a bit difficult,
950.807	my mum was not in a good place,
952.337	and I can remember finding myself
952.337	just before the whole thing started
955.621	telling this story about something
955.621	that happened in a 1970s sitcom,
959.868	and I just thought at the time,
959.868	I don't know why I'm doing this,
962.306	and what I realized I was doing
964.484	was I was coming up with
964.484	something from somewhere
967.182	I could use to make her laugh
967.182	together with me.
971.571	It was a very basic reaction
971.571	to find some reason we can do this.
974.884	We can laugh together.
974.884	We're going to get through this.
977.569	We're going to be okay.
979.065	And in fact, all of us
979.065	are doing this all the time.
981.496	You do it so often,
981.496	you don't even notice it.
983.686	Everybody underestimates
983.686	how often they laugh,
986.101	and you're doing something,
986.101	when you laugh with people,
989.119	that's actually letting you access
989.119	a really ancient evolutionary system
993.949	that mammals have evolved
993.949	to make and maintain social bonds,
997.756	and clearly to regulate emotions,
997.756	to make ourselves feel better.
1001.146	It's not something specific to humans --
1001.146	it's a really ancient behavior
1004.536	which really helps us regulate how we feel
1004.536	and makes us feel better.
1008.6	In other words, when it comes to laughter,
1011.502	you and me, baby, ain't nothing 
1011.502	but mammals. (Laughter)
1014.172	Thank you.
1016.517	Thank you. (Applause)
