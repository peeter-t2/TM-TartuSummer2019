12.681	We lost a lot of time at school
12.681	learning spelling.
17.784	Kids are still losing a lot of time
17.784	at school with spelling.
24.405	That's why I want to share
24.405	a question with you:
29.54	Do we need new spelling rules?
33.392	I believe that yes, we do.
35.71	Or even better, I think we need
35.71	to simplify the ones we already have.
41.007	Neither the question nor the answer
41.007	are new in the Spanish language.
45.309	They have been bouncing around
45.309	from century to century
49.547	since 1492, when in the first grammar
49.547	guide of the Spanish language,
55.174	Antonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple
55.174	principle for our spelling:
60.94	"""... thus, we have to write words"
60.94	as we pronounce them,
63.883	"and pronounce words as we write them."""
66.287	Each sound was to correspond
66.287	to one letter,
69.613	each letter was to represent
69.613	a single sound,
72.962	and those which did not represent
72.962	any sound should be removed.
79.337	This approach, the phonetic approach,
81.816	which says we have to write
81.816	words as we pronounce them,
85.457	both is and isn't at the root of spelling
85.457	as we practice it today.
90.721	It is, because the Spanish language,
90.721	in contrast to English, French or others,
96.246	always strongly resisted
96.246	writing words too differently
101.581	to how we pronounce them.
103.303	But the phonetic approach
103.303	is also absent today,
105.596	because when, in the 18th century,
105.596	we decided how we would standardize
108.956	our writing,
110.192	there was another approach which guided
110.192	a good part of the decisions.
114.229	It was the etymological approach,
117.095	the one that says we have to write words
119.312	according to how they were written
119.312	in their original language,
122.49	in Latin, in Greek.
124.056	That's how we ended up with silent H's,
124.056	which we write but don't pronounce.
128.88	That's how we have B's and V's that,
128.88	contrary to what many people believe,
134.192	were never differentiated
134.192	in Spanish pronunciation.
138.28	That's how we wound up with G's,
140.352	that are sometimes aspirated,
140.352	"as in ""gente,"""
143.057	"and other times unaspirated, as in ""gato."""
145.462	That's how we ended up
145.462	with C's, S's and Z's,
149.81	three letters that in some places
149.81	correspond to one sound,
153.062	and in others, to two,
153.062	but nowhere to three.
157.62	I'm not here to tell you anything
157.62	you don't know from your own experience.
163.188	We all went to school,
166.161	we all invested big amounts
166.161	of learning time,
170.832	big amounts of pliant,
170.832	childlike brain time
175.554	in dictation,
177.185	in the memorization of spelling rules
177.185	filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.
182.739	We were told in many ways,
182.739	implicitly and explicitly,
186.55	that in spelling, something fundamental
186.55	to our upbringing was at stake.
193.081	Yet, I have the feeling
195.406	that teachers didn't ask themselves
195.406	why it was so important.
199.065	In fact, they didn't ask themselves
199.065	a previous question:
202.217	What is the purpose of spelling?
205.813	What do we need spelling for?
210.439	And the truth is, when someone
210.439	asks themselves this question,
213.38	the answer is much simpler
213.38	and less momentous
216.493	than we'd usually believe.
218.492	We use spelling to unify the way we write,
218.492	so we can all write the same way,
225.235	making it easier for us to understand
225.235	when we read to each other.
230.227	But unlike in other aspects of language
230.227	such as punctuation,
235.823	in spelling, there's no
235.823	individual expression involved.
241.946	In punctuation, there is.
243.937	With punctuation, I can choose
243.937	to change the meaning of a phrase.
247.917	With punctuation, I can impose
247.917	a particular rhythm to what I am writing,
253.366	but not with spelling.
255.629	When it comes to spelling,
255.629	it's either wrong or right,
259.23	according to whether it conforms
259.23	or not to the current rules.
263.514	But then, wouldn't it be more sensible
263.514	to simplify the current rules
268.892	so it would be easier to teach, learn
268.892	and use spelling correctly?
275.498	Wouldn't it be more sensible
275.498	to simplify the current rules
280.029	so that all the time we devote today
280.029	to teaching spelling,
285.405	we could devote to other language issues
288.497	whose complexities do, in fact,
288.497	deserve the time and effort?
294.253	What I propose is not to abolish spelling,
299.241	and have everyone write however they want.
303.698	Language is a tool of common usage,
307.642	and so I believe it's fundamental
307.642	that we use it following common criteria.
313.429	But I also find it fundamental
315.625	that those common criteria
315.625	be as simple as possible,
319.995	especially because
319.995	if we simplify our spelling,
323.853	we're not leveling it down;
326.69	when spelling is simplified,
329.387	the quality of the language
329.387	doesn't suffer at all.
333.929	I work every day with Spanish
333.929	Golden Age literature,
337.862	I read Garcilaso, Cervantes,
337.862	Góngora, Quevedo,
341.49	"who sometimes write ""hombre"" without H,"
344.461	"sometimes write ""escribir"" with V,"
347.713	and it's absolutely clear to me
350.176	that the difference between those texts
350.176	and ours is one of convention,
355.601	or rather, a lack of convention
355.601	during their time.
359.218	But it's not a difference of quality.
362.164	But let me go back to the masters,
364.612	because they're key characters
364.612	in this story.
367.99	Earlier, I mentioned this slightly
367.99	thoughtless insistence
373.455	with which teachers pester and pester us
376.393	over spelling.
377.917	But the truth is,
377.917	things being as they are,
381.413	this makes perfect sense.
383.729	In our society, spelling serves
383.729	as an index of privilege,
389.092	separating the cultured from the brute,
389.092	the educated from the ignorant,
393.504	independent of the content
393.504	that's being written.
398.516	One can get or not get a job
401.851	because of an H that one put or did not.
404.544	One can become
404.544	an object of public ridicule
407.757	because of a misplaced B.
410.432	Therefore, in this context,
412.632	of course, it makes sense to dedicate
412.632	all this time to spelling.
417.729	But we shouldn't forget
420.291	that throughout the history
420.291	of our language,
422.515	it has always been teachers
424.479	or people involved
424.479	in the early learning of language
428.428	who promoted spelling reforms,
430.972	who realized that in our spelling
430.972	there was often an obstacle
435.435	to the transmission of knowledge.
437.848	In our case, for example,
439.539	Sarmiento, together with Andrés Bello,
439.539	spearheaded the biggest spelling reform
444.116	to take place in the Spanish language:
447.545	the mid-19th century Chilean reform.
453.714	Then, why not take over
453.714	the task of those teachers
458.199	and start making progress in our spelling?
461.616	Here, in this intimate group of 10,000,
464.892	I'd like to bring to the table
466.47	some changes that I find reasonable
466.47	to start discussing.
472.027	Let's remove the silent H.
474.419	In places where we write an H
474.419	but pronounce nothing,
479.531	let's not write anything.
480.846	(Applause)
481.886	It's hard for me to imagine
481.886	what sentimental attachment
484.548	can justify to someone
484.548	all the hassle caused by the silent H.
489.563	B and V, as we said before,
491.932	were never differentiated
491.932	in the Spanish language --
494.826	(Applause)
495.867	Let's choose one; it could be either.
495.867	We can discuss it, talk it over.
499.196	Everyone will have their preferences
499.196	and can make their arguments.
502.85	Let's keep one, remove the other.
505.718	G and J, let's separate their roles.
508.749	G should keep the unaspirated sound,
508.749	"like in ""gato,"" ""mago,"" and ""águila,"""
513.195	and J should keep the aspirated sound,
516.515	"as in ""jarabe,"" ""jirafa,"""
516.515	"""gente,"" ""argentino."""
522.261	The case of C, S and Z is interesting,
527.613	because it shows that the phonetic
527.613	approach must be a guide,
531.474	but it can't be an absolute principle.
534.563	In some cases, the differences
534.563	in pronunciation must be addressed.
539.346	As I said before, C, S and Z,
542.276	in some places, correspond
542.276	to one sound, in others to two.
545.642	If we go from three letters
545.642	to two, we're all better off.
552.067	To some, these changes
552.067	may seem a bit drastic.
556.961	They're really not.
559.166	The Royal Spanish Academy,
559.166	all of language academies,
562.453	also believes that spelling
562.453	should be progressively modified;
567.382	that language is linked to history,
567.382	tradition and custom,
572.292	but that at the same time,
572.292	it is a practical everyday tool
576.939	and that sometimes this attachment
576.939	to history, tradition and custom
581.857	becomes an obstacle for its current usage.
587.439	Indeed, this explains the fact
589.572	that our language, much more than
589.572	the others we are geographically close to,
596.549	has been historically
596.549	modifying itself based on us,
600.101	for example, we went
600.101	"from ""ortographia"" to ""ortografía,"""
603.779	"from ""theatro"" to ""teatro,"""
603.779	"from ""quantidad"" to ""cantidad,"""
607.904	"from ""symbolo"" to ""símbolo."""
610.316	And some silent H's are slowly
610.316	being stealthily removed:
615.747	in the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,
618.011	"""arpa"" and ""armonía"" can be written"
618.011	with or without an H.
623.827	And everybody is OK.
627.272	I also believe
630.044	that this is a particularly appropriate
630.044	moment to have this discussion.
637.217	It's always said that language
637.217	changes spontaneously,
641.252	from the bottom up,
643.142	that its users are the ones
643.142	who incorporate new words
646.439	and who introduce grammatical changes,
649.998	and that the authority --
649.998	in some places an academy,
653.839	in others a dictionary,
653.839	in others a ministry --
657.774	accepts and incorporates them
657.774	long after the fact.
662.396	This is true only
662.396	for some levels of language.
666.068	It is true on the lexical level,
666.068	the level of words.
669.487	It is less true on the grammatical level,
672.765	and I would almost say
672.765	it is not true for the spelling level,
676.975	that has historically changed
676.975	from the top down.
681.04	Institutions have always been the ones
681.04	to establish the rules
685.099	and propose changes.
688.963	Why do I say this is a particularly
688.963	appropriate moment?
693.777	Until today,
695.169	writing always had a much more restricted
695.169	and private use than speech.
701.938	But in our time,
701.938	the age of social networks,
706.436	this is going through
706.436	a revolutionary change.
710.131	Never before have people written so much;
713.199	never before have people written
713.199	for so many others to see.
718.356	And in these social networks,
718.356	for the first time,
721.497	we're seeing innovative uses
721.497	of spelling on a large scale,
726.561	where even more-than-educated people
726.561	with impeccable spelling,
731.194	when using social networks,
733.498	behave a lot like the majority of users
733.498	of social networks behave.
739.071	That is to say, they slack
739.071	on spell-checking
742.777	and prioritize speed and efficacy
742.777	in communication.
748.129	For now, on social networks,
748.129	we see chaotic, individual usages.
753.584	But I think we have
753.584	to pay attention to them,
756.625	because they're probably telling us
758.996	that an era that designates
758.996	a new place for writing
763.618	seeks new criteria for that writing.
768.268	I think we'd be wrong
768.268	to reject them, to discard them,
773.41	because we identify them as symptoms
773.41	of the cultural decay of our times.
778.406	No, I believe we have to observe them,
778.406	organize them and channel them
783.368	within guidelines that better correspond
783.368	to the needs of our times.
790.561	I can anticipate some objections.
795.344	There will be those who'll say
796.798	that if we simplify spelling
796.798	we'll lose etymology.
802.743	Strictly speaking, if we wanted
802.743	to preserve etymology,
805.857	it would go beyond just spelling.
808.311	We'd also have to learn
808.311	Latin, Greek, Arabic.
813.059	With simplified spelling,
815.714	we would normalize etymology
815.714	in the same place we do now:
820.928	in etymological dictionaries.
823.937	A second objection will come
823.937	from those who say:
826.968	"""If we simplify spelling,"
826.968	we'll stop distinguishing
830.71	between words that differ
830.71	"in just one letter."""
834.41	That is true, but it's not a problem.
838.524	Our language has homonyms,
838.524	words with more than one meaning,
843.524	yet we don't confuse
843.524	"the ""banco"" where we sit"
846.31	"with the ""banco"" where we deposit money,"
848.406	"or the ""traje"" that we wear"
848.406	"with the things we ""trajimos."""
851.679	In the vast majority of situations,
851.679	context dispels any confusion.
859.012	But there's a third objection.
863.922	To me,
866.873	it's the most understandable,
866.873	even the most moving.
870.342	It's the people who'll say:
870.342	"""I don't want to change."
874.356	I was brought up like this,
874.356	I got used to doing it this way,
878.089	when I read a written word
878.089	"in simplified spelling, my eyes hurt."""
884.386	(Laughter)
886.211	This objection is, in part, in all of us.
892.003	What do I think we should do?
893.516	The same thing that's always
893.516	done in these cases:
896.249	changes are made looking forward;
896.249	children are taught the new rules,
901.686	those of us who don't want to adapt
901.686	can write the way we're used to writing,
906.243	and hopefully, time will cement
906.243	the new rules in place.
911.084	The success of every spelling reform
911.084	that affects deeply rooted habits
917.615	lies in caution, agreement,
917.615	gradualism and tolerance.
923.483	At the same time, can't allow
923.483	the attachment to old customs
927.825	impede us from moving forward.
930.595	The best tribute we can pay to the past
934.055	is to improve upon what it's given us.
937.075	So I believe that we must
937.075	reach an agreement,
939.672	that academies must reach an agreement,
942.707	and purge from our spelling rules
945.669	all the habits we practice
945.669	just for the sake of tradition,
949.398	even if they are useless now.
951.505	I'm convinced that if we do that
955.005	in the humble but extremely
955.005	important realm of language,
959.029	we'll be leaving a better future
959.029	to the next generations.
964.942	(Applause)
