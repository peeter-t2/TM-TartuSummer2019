18.33	Right when I was 15 was when
18.33	I first got interested in solar energy.
22.049	My family had moved from Fort Lee,
22.049	New Jersey to California,
24.93	from the snow to lots of heat,
24.93	and gas lines.
27.29	There was gas rationing in 1973.
29.69	The energy crisis was in full bore.
31.77	I started reading
31.77	"""Popular Science"" magazine,"
33.93	and I got really excited
33.93	about the potential of solar energy
36.81	to try and solve that crisis.
38.57	I had just taken
38.57	trigonometry in high school,
40.73	I learned about the parabola
42.13	and how it could concentrate
42.13	rays of light to a single focus.
45.05	That got me very excited.
46.65	And I really felt
46.65	that there would be potential
48.89	to build some kind of thing
48.89	that could concentrate light.
51.61	So, I started this company
51.61	called Solar Devices.
54.33	And this was a company
54.33	where I built parabolas,
56.61	I took metal shop,
57.89	and I remember walking into metal shop
57.89	building parabolas and Stirling engines.
61.65	And I was building a Stirling engine
61.65	over on the lathe,
64.29	and all the motorcycle guys said,
64.29	"""You're building a bong, aren't you?"""
67.65	"And I said, ""No, it's a Stirling engine."""
67.65	But they didn't believe me.
70.93	I sold the plans for this engine
73.01	and for this dish in the back
73.01	"of ""Popular Science"" magazine,"
75.89	for four dollars each.
77.33	And I earned enough money
77.33	to pay for my first year of Caltech.
80.29	It was a really big excitement for me
80.29	to get into Caltech.
83.05	And at my first year at Caltech,
83.05	I continued the business.
86.13	But then, in the second year of Caltech,
86.13	they started grading.
89.09	The whole first year was pass/fail,
89.09	but the second year was graded.
92.29	I wasn't able to keep up
92.29	with the business,
94.37	and I ended up with a 25-year detour.
96.21	My dream had been to convert solar energy
96.21	at a very practical cost,
99.41	but then I had this big detour.
100.97	First, the coursework at Caltech.
102.61	Then, when I graduated from Caltech,
102.61	the IBM PC came out,
105.37	and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.
107.45	And then in 1983, Lotus 1-2-3 came out,
109.81	and I was completely blown away
109.81	by Lotus 1-2-3.
112.05	I began operating my business with 1-2-3,
112.05	began writing add-ins for 1-2-3,
116.25	wrote a natural language
116.25	interface to 1-2-3.
118.61	I started an educational software company
118.61	after I joined Lotus,
121.61	and then I started Idealab
121.61	so I could have a roof
123.97	under which I could build
123.97	multiple companies in succession.
127.13	Much later -- in 2000, very recently --
127.13	the new California energy crisis --
131.534	what was purported to be
131.534	a big energy crisis -- was coming.
134.389	And I was trying to figure out
135.87	if we could build something
135.87	that would capitalize on that
138.591	and get people backup energy,
138.591	in case the crisis really came.
141.5	And I started looking at how
141.5	we could build battery backup systems
144.635	that could give people five hours,
147.83	or three days' worth of backup power.
149.77	I'm glad you heard earlier today,
149.77	batteries are unbelievably --
152.81	lack density compared to fuel.
155.81	So much more energy can be stored
155.81	with fuel than with batteries.
158.85	You'd have to fill your entire
158.85	parking space of one garage space
161.93	just to give yourself
161.93	four hours of battery backup.
164.37	And I concluded, after researching
164.37	every other technology
167.09	that we could deploy for storing energy --
169.13	flywheels, different
169.13	formulations of batteries --
171.49	it just wasn't practical to store energy.
173.89	So what about making energy?
173.89	Maybe we could make energy.
176.57	I tried to figure out --
176.57	maybe solar's become attractive.
179.29	It's been 25 years since I was doing this,
181.37	let me go back and look
181.37	at what's been happening with solar cells.
184.53	And the price had gone down
184.53	from 10 dollars a watt
186.93	to about four or five dollars a watt,
186.93	but it stabilized.
189.61	And it needed to get much lower
189.61	to be cost-effective.
192.13	I studied all the new things
192.13	that had happened in solar cells,
195.059	and was looking for ways we could
195.059	make solar cells more inexpensively.
198.45	A lot of new things
198.45	are happening to do that,
200.85	but fundamentally, the process
200.85	requires a tremendous amount of energy.
204.21	Some people say it takes
204.21	more energy to make a solar cell
206.93	than it will give out in its entire life.
208.93	If we reduce the amount of energy
208.93	it takes to make the cells,
211.85	that will become more practical.
213.45	But right now, you pretty much
213.45	have to take silicon,
215.93	put it in an oven at 1600 F
215.93	for 17 hours, to make the cells.
219.53	A lot of people are working
219.53	to try and reduce that,
221.97	but I didn't have anything to contribute.
223.97	So I tried to figure out
223.97	what other way could we try
226.45	to make cost-effective solar electricity.
228.65	What if we collect the sun
228.65	with a large reflector --
231.13	like I had been thinking about
231.13	in high school,
233.33	but maybe with modern technology
233.33	we could make it cheaper --
236.17	concentrate it to a small converter,
238.25	and then the conversion device
238.25	wouldn't have to be as expensive,
241.33	because it's much smaller,
241.33	rather than solar cells,
243.81	which have to cover the entire surface
243.81	that you want to gather sun from.
247.25	This seemed practical now,
248.53	because a lot of new technologies
248.53	had come in the 25 years
251.29	since I had last looked at it.
252.77	There was a lot
252.77	of new manufacturing techniques,
255.05	not to mention really cheap
255.05	miniature motors --
257.29	brushless motors,
257.29	servomotors, stepper motors,
259.49	that are used in printers and scanners.
261.41	So, that's a breakthrough.
262.69	Of course, inexpensive microprocessors
264.57	and a very important breakthrough --
264.57	genetic algorithms.
267.49	I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
269.49	It's a powerful way of solving intractable
269.49	problems using natural selection.
273.09	You take a problem that you can't solve
273.09	with a pure mathematical answer,
276.53	you build an evolutionary system
276.53	to try multiple tries at guessing,
279.729	you add sex --
280.97	where you take half of one solution
280.97	and half of another
283.61	and then make new mutations --
285.09	and you use natural selection
285.09	to kill off not-as-good solutions.
288.17	Usually, with a genetic algorithm
288.17	on a computer today,
290.77	with a three gigahertz processor,
292.53	you can solve many
292.53	formerly intractable problems
295.283	in just a matter of minutes.
296.81	So we tried to come up with a way
296.81	to use genetic algorithms
299.89	to create a new type of concentrator.
301.73	And I'll show you what we came up with.
303.65	Traditionally,
303.65	concentrators look like this.
305.77	Those shapes are parabolas.
307.13	They take all the parallel incoming rays
307.13	and focus it to a single spot.
310.53	They have to track the sun,
311.85	because they have to point
311.85	directly at the sun.
314.09	They usually have
314.09	a one degree acceptance angle --
316.49	once they're more than a degree off,
318.25	none of the sunlight rays
318.25	will hit the focus.
320.41	So we tried to come up
320.41	with a non-tracking collector
322.89	that would gather much more than
322.89	one degree of light, with no moving parts.
326.45	So we created a genetic algorithm
326.45	to try this out,
328.85	we made a model in Excel
328.85	of a multisurface reflector,
331.45	and an amazing thing evolved, literally,
333.53	from trying a billion cycles,
333.53	a billion different attempts,
336.37	with a fitness function that defined
336.37	how can you collect the most light,
339.81	from the most angles,
339.81	over a day, from the sun.
342.05	And this is the shape that evolved.
343.77	It's this non-tracking collector
343.77	with these six tuba-like horns,
347.45	and each of them collect light
347.45	in the following way --
350.01	if the sunlight strikes right here,
351.73	it might bounce right to the center,
351.73	the hot spot, directly,
354.61	but if the sun is off axis
354.61	and comes from the side,
357.05	it might hit two places
357.05	and take two bounces.
359.49	So for direct light,
359.49	it takes only one bounce,
362.33	for off-axis light it might take two,
364.25	and for extreme off-axis,
364.25	it might take three.
366.77	Your efficiency goes down
366.77	with more bounces,
368.89	because you lose about 10 percent
368.89	with each bounce,
371.33	but this allowed us to collect light
371.33	from a plus or minus 25-degree angle.
375.21	So, about two and a half hours of the day
377.41	we could collect
377.41	with a stationary component.
379.77	Solar cells collect light
379.77	for four and a half hours though.
382.57	On an average adjusted day,
382.57	a solar cell --
384.85	because the sun's moving across the sky,
386.81	the solar cell is going down
386.81	with a sine wave function of performance
390.09	at the off-axis angles.
391.37	It collects about four and a half
391.37	average hours of sunlight a day.
394.53	So even this, although it was great
394.53	with no moving parts --
397.33	we could achieve high
397.33	temperatures -- wasn't enough.
399.81	We needed to beat solar cells.
401.29	So we took a look at another idea.
402.97	We looked at a way to break up a parabola
402.97	into individual petals that would track.
406.852	So what you see here is 12 separate petals
409.25	that each could be controlled
409.25	with individual microprocessors
412.17	that would only cost a dollar.
413.65	You can buy a two-megahertz
413.65	microprocessor for a dollar now.
416.69	And you can buy stepper motors
416.69	that pretty much never wear out
419.89	because they have no brushes,
421.53	for a dollar.
422.77	So we can control all 12 of these petals
422.77	for under 50 dollars
426.45	and what this would allow us to do
426.45	is not have to move the focus any more,
429.97	but only move the petals.
431.25	The whole system would have
431.25	a much lower profile,
433.61	but also we could gather sunlight
433.61	for six and a half to seven hours a day.
437.13	Now that we have concentrated sunlight,
439.05	what are we going to put at the center
439.05	to convert sunlight to electricity?
442.57	So we tried to look
442.57	at all the different heat engines
445.09	that have been used in history to convert
445.09	sunlight or heat to electricity,
449.93	And one of the great ones of all time,
451.81	James Watt's steam engine of 1788
451.81	was a major breakthrough.
455.01	James Watt didn't actually invent
455.01	the steam engine, he just refined it.
458.37	But his refinements were incredible.
460.13	He added new linear
460.13	motion guides to the pistons,
462.49	he added a condenser
462.49	to cool the steam outside the cylinder,
465.37	he made the engine double-acting,
465.37	so it had double the power.
468.29	Those were major breakthroughs.
468.29	All of the improvements he made --
471.45	and it's justifiable
471.45	that our measure of energy, the watt,
474.89	today is named after him.
476.45	So we looked at this engine,
476.45	and this had some potential.
479.17	Steam engines are dangerous,
480.57	and they had tremendous impact
480.57	on the world --
482.77	industrial revolution
482.77	and ships and locomotives.
485.05	But they're usually good to be large,
486.89	so they're not good
486.89	for distributed power generation.
489.41	They're also very high-pressure,
489.41	so they're dangerous.
491.97	Another type of engine
491.97	is the hot air engine.
494.57	And the hot air engine
494.57	also was not invented by Robert Stirling,
497.65	but Robert Stirling came along in 1816
497.65	and radically improved it.
500.73	This engine, because it was
500.73	so interesting --
502.89	it only worked on air, no steam --
504.57	has led to hundreds
504.57	of creative designs over the years
507.33	that use the Stirling engine principle.
509.69	But after the Stirling engine,
509.69	Otto came along,
511.93	and also, he didn't invent
511.93	the internal combustion engine,
514.69	he just refined it.
515.93	He showed it in Paris in 1867,
515.93	and it was a major achievement
518.85	because it brought the power density
518.85	of the engine way up.
521.61	You could now get a lot more power
521.61	in a lot smaller space,
524.37	and that allowed the engine
524.37	to be used for mobile applications.
527.37	So, once you have mobility,
528.85	you're making a lot of engines
528.85	because you've got lots of units,
531.93	as opposed to steam ships
531.93	or big factories,
533.954	so this was the engine that ended up
533.954	benefiting from mass production
537.249	where all the other engines didn't.
538.97	So, because it went into mass production,
540.947	costs were reduced,
543.53	emissions were reduced,
543.53	tremendous production value.
546.33	There have been hundreds of millions
546.33	of internal combustion engines built,
549.85	compared to thousands
549.85	of Stirling engines built.
552.13	And not nearly as many
552.13	small steam engines being built anymore,
555.13	only large ones for big operations.
556.85	So after looking
556.85	at these three, and 47 others,
559.53	we concluded that the Stirling engine
559.53	would be the best one to use.
562.73	I want to give you a brief explanation
562.73	of how we looked at it and how it works.
566.65	So we tried to look
566.65	at the Stirling engine in a new way,
569.33	because it was practical --
571.89	weight no longer mattered
571.89	for our application.
574.17	The internal combustion engine
574.17	took off because weight mattered,
577.29	because you were moving around.
578.85	But if you're trying to generate
578.85	solar energy in a static place
581.85	the weight doesn't matter so much.
583.53	We also discovered that efficiency
583.53	doesn't matter so much
586.229	if your energy source is free.
587.71	Normally, efficiency is crucial
589.231	because the fuel cost
589.231	of your engine over its life
592.191	dwarfs the cost of the engine.
593.89	But if your fuel source is free,
595.49	then the only thing that matters
597.09	is the up-front
597.09	capital cost of the engine.
599.13	So you don't want
599.13	to optimize for efficiency,
601.29	you want to optimize for power per dollar.
603.33	So using that new twist,
603.33	with the new criteria,
605.57	we thought we could
605.57	relook at the Stirling engine,
607.97	and also bring genetic algorithms in.
609.81	Basically, Robert Stirling
609.81	didn't have Gordon Moore before him
612.77	to get us three gigahertz
612.77	of processor power.
614.93	So we took the same genetic algorithm
616.751	that we used earlier
616.751	to make that concentrator,
618.992	which didn't work out for us,
620.468	to optimize the Stirling engine,
622.05	and make its design sizes
622.05	and all of its dimensions
625.29	the exact optimum
625.29	to get the most power per dollar,
628.41	irrespective of weight,
628.41	irrespective of size,
630.57	just to get the most conversion
630.57	of solar energy,
632.85	because the sun is free.
634.09	And that's the process we took --
634.09	let me show you how the engine works.
637.45	The simplest heat engine,
637.45	or hot air engine, of all time
640.13	would be this -- take a box,
640.13	a steel canister, with a piston.
643.37	Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.
645.69	Take it off the flame
645.69	and pour water on it, or let it cool down,
648.73	the piston moves down.
649.97	That's a heat engine.
651.21	That's the most fundamental
651.21	heat engine you could have.
653.85	The problem is the efficiency
653.85	is one hundredth of one percent,
656.93	because you're heating
656.93	all the metal of the chamber
659.37	and then cooling all the metal
659.37	of the chamber each time.
662.05	And you're only getting power from the air
662.05	that's heating at the same time,
665.61	but you're wasting energy
665.61	heating and cooling the metal.
668.29	So someone came up
668.29	with a very clever idea.
670.37	Instead of heating and cooling
670.37	the whole cylinder,
672.77	what about if you put
672.77	a displacer inside --
674.81	a little thing that shuttles
674.81	the air back and forth.
677.29	You move that up and down
677.29	with a little bit of energy
679.81	but now you're only shifting the air down
679.81	to the hot end and up to the cold end.
683.61	So, now you're not alternately heating
683.61	and cooling the metal, just the air.
687.81	That allows you to get the efficiency up
689.77	from a hundredth of a percent
689.77	to about two percent.
692.21	And then Robert Stirling
692.21	came along with this genius idea,
694.97	which was, well, I'm still
694.97	not heating the metal now,
697.49	with this kind of engine,
698.73	but I'm still reheating all the air.
700.49	I'm still heating the air every time
700.49	and cooling the air every time.
703.73	What about if I put
703.73	a thermal sponge in the middle,
706.37	in the passageway between where the air
706.37	has to move between hot and cold?
710.29	So he made fine wires, and cracked glass,
712.97	and all different kinds of materials
712.97	to be a heat sponge.
715.69	So when the air pushes up
715.69	to go from the hot end to the cold end,
718.77	it puts some heat into the sponge.
720.97	And then when the air comes back
720.97	after it's been cooled,
723.65	it picks up that heat again.
725.05	So you're reusing your energy
725.05	five or six times,
728.09	and that brings the efficiency
728.09	up to between 30 and 40 percent.
731.09	It's a little known, but brilliant,
731.09	genius invention of Robert Stirling
734.45	that takes the hot air engine
734.45	from being somewhat impractical --
737.49	like I found out when I made
737.49	the real simple version in high school --
740.85	to very potentially possible,
742.29	once you get the efficiency up,
743.85	if you can design this
743.85	to be low enough cost.
746.01	So we really set out on a path
746.01	to try and make the lowest cost possible.
749.45	We built a huge mathematical model
749.45	of how a Stirling engine works.
752.61	We applied the genetic algorithm.
754.25	We got the results from that
754.25	for the optimal engine.
756.73	We built engines --
757.97	so we built 100 different engines
757.97	over the last two years.
760.73	We measured each one, we readjusted
760.73	the model to what we measured,
763.89	and then we led that
763.89	to the current prototype.
766.09	It led to a very compact,
766.09	inexpensive engine,
768.25	and this is what the engine looks like.
770.17	Let me show you
770.17	what it looks like in real life.
773.77	So this is the engine.
773.77	It's just a small cylinder down here,
777.49	which holds the generator
777.49	inside and all the linkage,
780.21	and it's the hot cap --
780.21	the hot cylinder on the top --
783.57	this part gets hot, this part is cool,
785.85	and electricity comes out.
787.81	The exact converse is also true.
789.69	If you put electricity in,
789.69	this will get hot and this will get cold,
793.09	you get refrigeration.
794.41	So it's a complete reversible cycle,
796.25	a very efficient cycle,
796.25	and quite a simple thing to make.
799.25	So now you put the two things together.
801.17	So you have the engine.
802.41	What if you combine
802.41	the petals and the engine in the center?
805.29	The petals track and the engine
805.29	gets the concentrated sunlight,
808.29	takes that heat
808.29	and turns it into electricity.
810.49	This is what the first prototype
810.49	of our system looked like
813.25	with the petals
813.25	and the engine in the center.
815.41	This is being run out in the sun,
817.05	and now I want to show you
817.05	what the actual thing looks like.
825.61	(Applause)
830.97	Thank you.
832.21	So this is a unit with the 12 petals.
834.89	These petals cost about a dollar each --
836.85	they're lightweight,
836.85	injection-molded plastic, aluminized.
839.61	The mechanism to control
839.61	each petal is below there,
842.297	with a microprocessor on each one.
844.37	There are thermocouples on the engine --
846.33	little sensors that detect the heat
846.33	when the sunlight strikes them.
849.53	Each petal adjusts itself separately
849.53	to keep the highest temperature on it.
853.41	When the sun comes out in the morning,
853.41	the petals will seek the sun,
856.65	find it by searching
856.65	for the highest temperature.
859.01	About a minute and a half or two minutes
859.01	after the rays are striking the hot cap
862.97	the engine will be warm enough to start
864.89	and then the engine
864.89	will generate electricity
867.05	for about six and a half hours a day --
868.97	six and a half to seven hours
868.97	as the sun moves across the sky.
871.93	A critical part
871.93	that we can take advantage of
874.09	is that we have these
874.09	inexpensive microprocessors
876.45	and each of these petals is autonomous,
878.37	and each of these petals figures out
878.37	where the sun is with no user setup.
881.85	So you don't have to tell
881.85	what latitude, longitude you're at,
884.77	what your roof slope angle is,
884.77	or what orientation.
887.21	It doesn't really care.
888.49	What it does is it searches
888.49	to find the hottest spot,
891.09	it searches again a half an hour later,
891.09	a day later, a month later.
895.05	It basically figures out
895.05	where on Earth you are
897.29	by watching the direction the sun moves,
899.25	so you don't have to
899.25	actually enter anything about that.
901.93	The way the unit works is,
903.25	when the sun comes out,
903.25	the engine will start
905.57	and you get power out here.
907.13	We have AC and DC, get 12 volts DC,
910.85	so that could be used
910.85	for certain applications.
913.09	We have an inverter in there,
913.09	so you get 117 volts AC.
915.69	And you also get hot water.
915.69	The hot water's optional.
918.29	You don't have to use it,
918.29	it will cool itself.
920.57	But you can use it
920.57	to optionally heat hot water
922.81	and that brings
922.81	the efficiency up even higher
924.97	because some of the heat
924.97	that you'd normally be rejecting,
927.73	you can now use as useful energy,
927.73	whether it's for a pool or hot water.
931.13	Let me show you a quick movie
931.13	of what this looks like running.
939.41	This is the first test
939.41	where we took it outside
941.65	and each of the petals
941.65	were individually seeking.
944.01	And what they do is step,
944.01	very coarsely at first,
946.41	and very finely afterward.
947.69	Once they get a temperature reading
947.69	on the thermocouple
950.33	indicating they found the sun,
951.81	they slow down and do a fine search.
953.57	Then the petals will move into position,
953.57	and the engine will start.
956.77	We've been working on this
956.77	for the last two years.
959.17	We're very excited about the progress,
959.17	we have a long way to go though.
962.57	This is how we envision
962.57	it would be in a residential installation:
965.85	you'd probably have
965.85	more than one unit on your roof.
968.33	It could be on your roof,
968.33	your backyard, or somewhere else.
971.17	You don't have to have enough units
971.17	to power your entire house,
974.17	you just save money
974.17	with each incremental one you add.
976.73	So you're still using
976.73	the grid potentially,
978.85	in this type of application,
978.85	to be your backup supply --
981.53	of course, you can't use these at night,
981.53	and you can't use these on cloudy days.
985.33	But by reducing your energy use,
985.33	pretty much at the peak times --
988.77	usually when you have
988.77	your air conditioning on,
991.01	or other times like that --
992.37	this generates the peak power
992.37	at the peak usage time,
994.89	so it's very complementary in that sense.
996.89	This is how we would envision
996.89	a residential application.
999.57	We also think there's
999.57	very big potential for energy farms,
1002.33	especially in remote land
1002.33	where there happens to be a lot of sun.
1005.45	It's a really good combination
1005.45	of those two factors.
1007.93	It turns out there's a lot of powerful sun
1007.93	all around the world, obviously,
1011.49	but in special places
1012.77	where it happens to be
1012.77	relatively inexpensive to place these
1015.65	and also in many more places
1015.65	where there is high wind power.
1018.53	So an example of that is,
1018.53	here's the map of the United States.
1021.93	Pretty much everywhere that's
1021.93	not green or blue is a really ideal place,
1025.37	but even the green or blue areas are good,
1027.41	just not as good as the places
1027.41	that are red, orange and yellow.
1030.41	But the hot spot right around Las Vegas
1030.41	and Death Valley is very good.
1033.77	And is only affects the payback period,
1035.874	it doesn't mean that you
1035.874	couldn't use solar energy;
1038.33	you could use it anywhere on Earth.
1040.05	It just affects the payback period
1041.73	if you're comparing
1041.73	to grid-supplied electricity.
1044.09	But if you don't have
1044.09	grid-supplied electricity,
1046.369	then the question of payback
1046.369	is a different one entirely.
1049.09	It's just how many watts
1049.09	do you get per dollar,
1051.33	and how could you benefit from that
1051.33	to change your life in some way.
1054.57	This is the map of the whole Earth,
1056.68	and you can see
1056.68	a huge swathe in the middle
1058.761	where a large part of the population is,
1060.723	there's tremendous chances
1060.723	for solar energy.
1063.3	And of course, look at Africa.
1064.781	The potential to take advantage
1064.781	of solar energy there is unbelievable,
1068.102	and I'm really excited to talk more
1068.102	about finding ways we can help with that.
1071.783	So, in conclusion, I would say
1071.783	my journey has shown me
1075.529	that you can revisit
1075.529	old ideas in a new light,
1078.85	and sometimes ideas
1078.85	that have been discarded in the past
1081.57	can be practical now if you apply
1081.57	some new technology or new twists.
1085.13	We believe we're getting very close
1085.13	to something practical and affordable.
1088.65	Our short-term goal for this
1088.65	is to be half the price of solar cells
1091.85	and our longer-term goal
1091.85	is to be less than a five-year payback.
1094.93	And at less than a five-year payback,
1094.93	this becomes very economic.
1098.09	So you don't have to just have
1098.09	a feel-good attitude about energy
1101.17	to want to have one of these.
1102.61	It just makes economic sense.
1104.05	Right now, solar paybacks
1104.05	are between 30 and 50 years.
1106.65	If you get it down below five years,
1108.41	then it's almost a no-brainer
1108.41	because the interest to own it --
1111.41	someone else will finance it for you
1111.41	and you can just make money from day one.
1115.13	So that's our real powerful goal
1116.73	that we're really
1116.73	shooting for in the company.
1118.93	Two other things that I learned
1118.93	that were very surprising to me --
1122.09	one was how casual we are about energy.
1127.29	I was walking from the elevator over here,
1129.69	and even just looking
1129.69	at the stage right now --
1131.93	so there's probably
1135.49	There's 10,000 watts of light
1135.49	pouring on the stage,
1137.93	one horsepower
1137.93	is 746 watts, at full power.
1141.33	So there's basically 15 horses running
1141.33	at full speed just to keep the stage lit.
1146.09	Not to mention the 200 horses
1146.09	that are probably running right now
1149.21	to keep the air-conditioning going.
1150.93	And it's just amazing,
1152.17	walk in the elevator,
1152.17	and there's lights on in the elevator.
1155.05	Of course, now I'm very sensitive at home
1155.05	when we leave the lights on by mistake.
1158.89	But, everywhere around us
1158.89	we have insatiable use for energy
1161.73	because it's so cheap.
1163.01	And it's cheap because
1163.01	we've been subsidized by energy
1165.57	that's been concentrated by the sun.
1167.33	Basically, oil is
1167.33	solar-energy concentrate.
1170.21	It's been pounded for a billion years
1170.21	with a lot of energy
1173.57	to make it have all that energy
1173.57	contained in it.
1175.85	And we don't have a birthright
1177.33	to just use that up
1177.33	as fast as we are, I think.
1179.57	And it would be great if we could
1179.57	make our energy usage renewable,
1182.77	where as we're using the energy,
1182.77	we're creating it at the same pace,
1186.01	and I really hope we can get there.
1187.73	Thank you very much,
1187.73	you've been a great audience.
