12.54	Hi, I'm an engineer
13.98	and I make robots.
15.98	Now, of course you all know
15.98	what a robot is, right?
19.5	If you don't, you'd probably go to Google,
21.7	and you'd ask Google what a robot is.
23.58	So let's do that.
25.46	We'll go to Google
25.46	and this is what we get.
28.22	Now, you can see here there are
28.22	lots of different types of robots,
31.42	but they're predominantly
31.42	humanoid in structure.
35.18	And they look pretty conventional
36.86	because they've got plastic,
36.86	they've got metal,
39.34	they've got motors and gears and so on.
41.66	Some of them look quite friendly,
43.3	and you could go up
43.3	and you could hug them.
45.38	Some of them not so friendly,
46.82	they look like they're
46.82	"straight out of ""Terminator,"""
49.3	in fact they may well be
49.3	"straight out of ""Terminator."""
51.86	You can do lots of really cool
51.86	things with these robots --
54.62	you can do really exciting stuff.
56.26	But I'd like to look
56.26	at different kinds of robots --
59.22	I want to make different kinds of robots.
61.22	And I take inspiration
61.22	from the things that don't look like us,
64.66	but look like these.
66.5	So these are natural biological organisms
69.1	and they do some
69.1	really cool things that we can't,
71.7	and current robots can't either.
74.22	They do all sorts of great things
74.22	like moving around on the floor;
77.42	they go into our gardens
77.42	and they eat our crops;
79.7	they climb trees;
80.98	they go in water, they come out of water;
83.22	they trap insects and digest them.
85.82	So they do really interesting things.
87.66	They live, they breathe, they die,
91.06	they eat things from the environment.
92.9	Our current robots don't really do that.
95.5	Now, wouldn't it be great
96.74	if you could use some of those
96.74	characteristics in future robots
100.42	so that you could solve
100.42	some really interesting problems?
103.14	I'm going to look at a couple of problems
103.14	now in the environment
106.22	where we can use
106.22	the skills and the technologies
108.98	derived from these animals
111.02	and from the plants,
112.58	and we can use them
112.58	to solve those problems.
114.7	Let's have a look
114.7	at two environmental problems.
117.78	They're both of our making --
119.22	this is man interacting
119.22	with the environment
121.7	and doing some rather unpleasant things.
124.1	The first one is to do
124.1	with the pressure of population.
128.26	Such is the pressure
128.26	of population around the world
130.7	that agriculture and farming is required
130.7	to produce more and more crops.
134.86	Now, to do that,
136.1	farmers put more and more
136.1	chemicals onto the land.
138.5	They put on fertilizers,
138.5	nitrates, pesticides --
141.66	all sorts of things
141.66	that encourage the growth of the crops,
145.06	but there are some negative impacts.
147.22	One of the negative impacts is
147.22	if you put lots of fertilizer on the land,
150.7	not all of it goes into the crops.
153.14	Lots of it stays in the soil,
155.74	and then when it rains,
157.22	these chemicals go into the water table.
159.74	And in the water table,
161.02	then they go into streams,
161.02	into lakes, into rivers
164.54	and into the sea.
166.22	Now, if you put all
166.22	of these chemicals, these nitrates,
168.86	into those kinds of environments,
170.5	there are organisms in those environments
170.5	that will be affected by that --
174.3	algae, for example.
175.94	Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer,
178.5	so it will take in all these chemicals,
180.62	and if the conditions are right,
180.62	it will mass produce.
183.58	It will produce masses
183.58	and masses of new algae.
185.86	That's called a bloom.
187.42	The trouble is that
187.42	when algae reproduces like this,
190.62	it starves the water of oxygen.
193.3	As soon as you do that,
194.58	the other organisms
194.58	in the water can't survive.
197.9	So, what do we do?
199.94	We try to produce a robot
199.94	that will eat the algae,
203.98	consume it and make it safe.
205.86	So that's the first problem.
207.78	The second problem is also of our making,
210.3	and it's to do with oil pollution.
212.62	Now, oil comes out
212.62	of the engines that we use,
216.38	the boats that we use.
217.74	Sometimes tankers
217.74	flush their oil tanks into the sea,
220.82	so oil is released into the sea that way.
223.1	Wouldn't it be nice
223.1	if we could treat that in some way
225.7	using robots that could eat the pollution
225.7	the oil fields have produced?
230.98	So that's what we do.
232.62	We make robots that will eat pollution.
235.7	To actually make the robot,
237.06	we take inspiration from two organisms.
240.1	On the right there
240.1	you see the basking shark.
242.26	The basking shark is a massive shark.
244.82	It's noncarnivorous,
244.82	so you can swim with it,
247.42	as you can see.
248.9	And the basking shark opens its mouth,
250.78	and it swims through the water,
250.78	collecting plankton.
254.7	As it does that, it digests the food,
256.94	and then it uses that energy
256.94	in its body to keep moving.
261.22	So, could we make a robot like that --
263.1	like the basking shark
263.1	that chugs through the water
265.66	and eats up pollution?
267.98	Well, let's see if we can do that.
269.74	But also, we take the inspiration
269.74	from other organisms.
272.82	I've got a picture here
272.82	of a water boatman,
274.9	and the water boatman is really cute.
276.74	When it's swimming in the water,
278.34	it uses its paddle-like legs
278.34	to push itself forward.
281.42	So we take those two organisms
283.46	and we combine them together
283.46	to make a new kind of robot.
287.14	In fact, because we're using
287.14	the water boatman as inspiration,
290.34	and our robot sits on top of the water,
293.14	and it rows,
294.42	"we call it the ""Row-bot."""
296.66	So a Row-bot is a robot that rows.
300.54	OK. So what does it look like?
303.26	Here's some pictures of the Row-bot,
305.02	and you'll see,
306.26	it doesn't look anything like the robots
306.26	we saw right at the beginning.
309.62	Google is wrong;
309.62	robots don't look like that,
311.78	they look like this.
313.02	So I've got the Row-bot here.
314.82	I'll just hold it up for you.
316.26	It gives you a sense of the scale,
317.94	and it doesn't look
317.94	anything like the others.
320.1	OK, so it's made out of plastic,
321.74	and we'll have a look now
321.74	at the components
323.82	that make up the Row-bot --
325.16	what makes it really special.
327.58	The Row-bot is made up of three parts,
330.42	and those three parts are really
330.42	like the parts of any organism.
333.74	It's got a brain,
335.42	it's got a body
336.82	and it's got a stomach.
339.14	It needs the stomach to create the energy.
341.58	Any Row-bot will have
341.58	those three components,
343.82	and any organism
343.82	will have those three components,
346.22	so let's go through them one at a time.
348.14	It has a body,
349.42	and its body is made out of plastic,
351.22	and it sits on top of the water.
353.46	And it's got flippers on the side here --
356.42	paddles that help it move,
357.94	just like the water boatman.
360.02	It's got a plastic body,
361.38	but it's got a soft rubber mouth here,
364.26	and a mouth here --
364.26	it's got two mouths.
366.18	Why does it have two mouths?
367.62	One is to let the food go in
369.46	and the other is to let the food go out.
371.42	So you can see really
371.42	it's got a mouth and a derriere,
374.94	or a --
376.18	(Laughter)
377.22	something where the stuff comes out,
378.98	which is just like a real organism.
380.7	So it's starting to look
380.7	like that basking shark.
383.54	So that's the body.
384.94	The second component might be the stomach.
388.1	We need to get the energy into the robot
388.1	and we need to treat the pollution,
392.02	so the pollution goes in,
393.58	and it will do something.
395.1	It's got a cell in the middle here
395.1	called a microbial fuel cell.
398.7	I'll put this down,
398.7	and I'll lift up the fuel cell.
402.02	Here. So instead of having batteries,
403.9	instead of having
403.9	a conventional power system,
406.1	it's got one of these.
407.38	This is its stomach.
408.66	And it really is a stomach
409.94	because you can put energy in this side
409.94	in the form of pollution,
413.38	and it creates electricity.
415.06	So what is it?
416.3	It's called a microbial fuel cell.
417.98	It's a little bit
417.98	like a chemical fuel cell,
420.1	which you might have
420.1	come across in school,
422.14	or you might've seen in the news.
423.78	Chemical fuel cells
423.78	take hydrogen and oxygen,
425.94	and they can combine them together
425.94	and you get electricity.
428.78	That's well-established technology;
428.78	it was in the Apollo space missions.
432.22	That's from 40, 50 years ago.
434.26	This is slightly newer.
435.54	This is a microbial fuel cell.
437.02	It's the same principle:
438.3	it's got oxygen on one side,
439.74	but instead of having
439.74	hydrogen on the other,
441.86	it's got some soup,
443.18	and inside that soup
443.18	there are living microbes.
446.02	Now, if you take some organic material --
448.74	could be some waste products, some food,
451.1	maybe a bit of your sandwich --
452.62	you put it in there,
452.62	the microbes will eat that food,
455.46	and they will turn it into electricity.
458.22	Not only that, but if you select
458.22	the right kind of microbes,
461.74	you can use the microbial fuel cell
461.74	to treat some of the pollution.
466.22	If you choose the right microbes,
467.86	the microbes will eat the algae.
470.5	If you use other kinds of microbes,
472.86	they will eat petroleum
472.86	spirits and crude oil.
476.78	So you can see
476.78	how this stomach could be used
479.5	to not only treat the pollution
482.78	but also to generate electricity
482.78	from the pollution.
486.22	So the robot will move
486.22	through the environment,
489.02	taking food into its stomach,
491.14	digest the food, create electricity,
493.66	use that electricity
493.66	to move through the environment
496.18	and keep doing this.
497.42	OK, so let's see what happens
497.42	when we run the Row-bot --
500.98	when it does some rowing.
502.38	Here we've got a couple of videos,
504.06	the first thing you'll see --
504.06	hopefully you can see here
506.74	is the mouth open.
508.06	The front mouth and the bottom mouth open,
511.1	and it will stay opened enough,
512.66	then the robot will start to row forward.
514.7	It moves through the water
515.98	so that food goes in
515.98	as the waste products go out.
519.1	Once it's moved enough,
520.38	it stops and then it closes the mouth --
523.34	slowly closes the mouths --
525.78	and then it will sit there,
527.46	and it will digest the food.
529.82	Of course these microbial fuel cells,
532.54	they contain microbes.
533.82	What you really want is lots of energy
535.7	coming out of those microbes
535.7	as quickly as possible.
538.34	But we can't force the microbes
539.94	and they generate a small amount
539.94	of electricity per second.
542.98	They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.
546.26	Let's put that into context.
548.14	Your mobile phone for example,
549.7	one of these modern ones,
551.1	if you use it, it takes about one watt.
553.34	So that's a thousand or a million times
553.34	as much energy that that uses
557.18	compared to the microbial fuel cell.
559.82	How can we cope with that?
561.42	Well, when the Row-bot
561.42	has done its digestion,
564.3	when it's taken the food in,
565.78	it will sit there and it will wait
565.78	until it has consumed all that food.
569.34	That could take some hours,
569.34	it could take some days.
572.58	A typical cycle for the Row-bot
572.58	looks like this:
576.3	you open your mouth,
577.58	you move,
578.86	you close your mouth
580.14	and you sit there for a while waiting.
582.02	Once you digest your food,
583.42	then you can go about
583.42	doing the same thing again.
586.26	But you know what, that looks
586.26	like a real organism, doesn't it?
589.26	It looks like the kind of thing we do.
591.14	Saturday night,
591.14	we go out, open our mouths,
593.22	fill our stomachs,
594.78	sit in front of the telly and digest.
597.74	When we've had enough,
597.74	we do the same thing again.
600.14	OK, if we're lucky with this cycle,
603.02	at the end of the cycle
603.02	we'll have enough energy left over
606.58	for us to be able to do something else.
608.74	We could send a message, for example.
610.78	We could send a message saying,
612.3	"""This is how much pollution"
612.3	"I've eaten recently,"""
614.66	"or, ""This is the kind of stuff"
614.66	"that I've encountered,"""
617.26	"or, ""This is where I am."""
619.62	That ability to send a message
619.62	"saying, ""This is where I am,"""
622.9	is really, really important.
624.86	If you think about the oil slicks
624.86	that we saw before,
627.38	or those massive algal blooms,
628.86	what you really want to do
628.86	is put your Row-bot out there,
631.58	and it eats up all of those pollutions,
633.58	and then you have to go collect them.
635.78	Why?
637.02	Because these Row-bots at the moment,
638.86	this Row-bot I've got here,
640.22	it contains motors, it contains wires,
642.1	it contains components
642.1	which themselves are not biodegradable.
645.58	Current Row-bots contain
645.58	things like toxic batteries.
648.34	You can't leave those in the environment,
650.34	so you need to track them,
651.86	and then when they've finished
651.86	their job of work,
654.22	you need to collect them.
655.5	That limits the number
655.5	of Row-bots you can use.
657.86	If, on the other hand,
659.14	you have robot a little bit
659.14	like a biological organism,
662.3	when it comes to the end of its life,
664.42	it dies and it degrades to nothing.
666.9	So wouldn't it be nice if these robots,
669.26	instead of being like this,
669.26	made out of plastic,
671.523	were made out of other materials,
673.14	which when you throw them out there,
674.9	they biodegrade to nothing?
676.26	That changes the way
676.26	in which we use robots.
678.38	Instead of putting 10 or 100
678.38	out into the environment,
681.78	having to track them,
683.06	and then when they die,
684.42	collect them,
685.66	you could put a thousand,
687.38	a million, a billion robots
687.38	into the environment.
690.14	Just spread them around.
691.98	You know that at the end of their lives,
691.98	they're going to degrade to nothing.
695.62	You don't need to worry about them.
697.34	So that changes the way
697.34	in which you think about robots
699.98	and the way you deploy them.
701.38	Then the question is: Can you do this?
703.26	Well, yes, we have shown
703.26	that you can do this.
705.46	You can make robots
705.46	which are biodegradable.
707.58	What's really interesting
707.58	is you can use household materials
710.46	to make these biodegradable robots.
712.18	I'll show you some;
712.18	you might be surprised.
714.78	You can make a robot out of jelly.
717.7	Instead of having a motor,
717.7	which we have at the moment,
720.5	you can make things
720.5	called artificial muscles.
722.98	Artificial muscles are smart materials,
725.3	you apply electricity to them,
726.78	and they contract,
726.78	or they bend or they twist.
728.98	They look like real muscles.
731.22	So instead of having a motor,
731.22	you have these artificial muscles.
734.244	And you can make
734.244	artificial muscles out of jelly.
737.1	If you take some jelly and some salts,
739.06	and do a bit of jiggery-pokery,
740.66	you can make an artificial muscle.
742.46	We've also shown you can make
742.46	the microbial fuel cell's stomach
746.06	out of paper.
747.5	So you could make the whole
747.5	robot out of biodegradable materials.
751.3	You throw them out there,
751.3	and they degrade to nothing.
755.42	Well, this is really, really exciting.
757.3	It's going to totally change the way
757.3	in which we think about robots,
760.515	but also it allows you
760.515	to be really creative
762.78	in the way in which you think
762.78	about what you can do with these robots.
766.14	I'll give you an example.
767.42	If you can use jelly to make a robot --
770.02	now, we eat jelly, right?
771.94	So, why not make something like this?
774.46	A robot gummy bear.
776.94	Here, I've got some I prepared earlier.
779.74	There we go. I've got a packet --
782.38	and I've got a lemon-flavored one.
785.42	I'll take this gummy bear --
785.42	he's not robotic, OK?
788.18	We have to pretend.
789.42	And what you do with one of these
789.42	is you put it in your mouth --
792.46	the lemon's quite nice.
794.54	Try not to chew it too much,
794.54	it's a robot, it may not like it.
798.66	And then you swallow it.
800.9	And then it goes into your stomach.
802.62	And when it's inside your stomach,
802.62	it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends,
806.46	it does something.
807.7	It could go further down
807.7	into your intestines,
809.9	find out whether you've got
809.9	some ulcer or cancer,
812.26	maybe do an injection,
812.26	something like that.
814.38	You know that once
814.38	it's done its job of work,
817.26	it could be consumed by your stomach,
819.5	or if you don't want that,
821.22	it could go straight through you,
822.86	into the toilet,
824.1	and be degraded safely in the environment.
826.34	So this changes the way, again,
826.34	in which we think about robots.
830.54	So, we started off looking
830.54	at robots that would eat pollution,
834.86	and then we're looking
834.86	at robots which we can eat.
837.54	I hope this gives you some idea
839.22	of the kinds of things
