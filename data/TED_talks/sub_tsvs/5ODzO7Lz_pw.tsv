15.26	If we look around us,
18.26	much of what surrounds us
20.26	started life as various rocks and sludge
23.26	buried in the ground in various places in the world.
27.26	But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
29.26	They look like TV cameras, monitors,
32.26	annoying radio mics.
34.26	And so this magical transformation
36.26	is what I was trying to get at with my project,
39.26	which became known as the Toaster Project.
41.26	And it was also inspired by this quote
43.26	from Douglas Adams,
45.26	"and the situation is from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."""
48.26	And the situation it describes
50.26	is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --
53.26	finds himself alone on a strange planet
56.26	populated only by a technologically primitive people.
59.26	And he kind of assumes that, yes,
61.26	he'll become -- these villagers --
63.26	he'll become their emperor
65.26	and transform their society
67.26	with his wonderful command of technology
69.26	and science and the elements,
71.26	but, of course, realizes
73.26	that without the rest of human society,
75.26	he can barely make a sandwich,
78.26	let alone a toaster.
80.26	But he didn't have Wikipedia.
82.26	So I thought, okay,
84.26	I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.
86.26	And, working on the idea
88.26	that the cheapest electric toaster
90.26	would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,
92.26	I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,
95.26	took it home
97.26	and was kind of dismayed to discover
99.26	that, inside this object,
101.26	which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,
104.26	there were 400 different bits
107.26	made out of a hundred-plus different materials.
111.26	I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.
114.26	I had maybe nine months.
116.26	So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.
118.26	And these were steel, mica,
120.26	plastic, copper and nickel.
123.26	So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?
126.26	I went and knocked on the door
128.26	of the Rio Tinto Chair
130.26	of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines
133.26	"and said, ""How do you make steel?"""
135.26	And Professor Cilliers was very kind
137.26	and talked me through it.
139.26	And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --
142.26	well, steel comes from iron,
144.26	so I phoned up an iron mine.
147.26	"And said, ""Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster."
149.26	"Can I come up and get some iron?"""
153.26	Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.
156.26	He had misheard me
158.26	and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,
161.26	and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.
164.26	But after some nagging, I got him to do that.
166.26	(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,
170.26	and that was produced
172.26	by sea creatures
178.26	in a nice, warm,
180.26	sunny atmosphere.
182.26	When you study geology,
184.26	you can see what's happened in the past,
187.26	and there were terrific changes in the earth.
196.26	Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
200.26	And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,
203.26	because, though Ray was a miner there,
206.26	the mine had closed
208.26	and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,
211.26	because, of course, it can't compete
213.26	on the scale of operations which are happening
216.26	in South America, Australia, wherever.
219.26	But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore
222.26	and dragged it back to London on the train,
224.26	and then was faced with the problem:
226.26	Okay, how do you make this rock
228.26	into components for a toaster?
230.26	So I went back to Professor Cilliers,
232.26	"and he said, ""Go to the library."""
234.26	So I did
236.26	and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --
239.26	completely useless for what I was trying to do.
242.26	Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it
245.26	if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.
248.26	So I ended up going to the History of Science Library
250.26	and looking at this book.
252.26	This is the first textbook on metallurgy
254.26	written in the West, at least.
256.26	And there you can see that woodcut
258.26	is basically what I ended up doing.
260.26	But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
263.26	(Laughter)
265.26	And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,
268.26	was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,
270.26	the further back in time you have to go.
273.26	And so this is after
275.26	a day and about half a night
277.26	smelting this iron.
279.26	I dragged out this stuff,
281.26	and it wasn't iron.
283.26	But luckily,
285.26	I found a patent online
287.26	for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,
290.26	and at 30 minutes at full power,
292.26	and I was able to finish off the process.
297.26	So, my next --
299.26	(Applause)
303.26	The next thing I was trying to get was copper.
306.26	Again, this mine
309.26	was once the largest copper mine in the world.
311.26	It's not anymore,
313.26	but I found a retired geology professor
315.26	to take me down,
317.26	"and he said, ""Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."""
320.26	And the reason I was interested in getting water
323.26	is because water which goes through mines
325.26	becomes kind of acidic
327.26	and will start picking up,
329.26	dissolving the minerals from the mine.
331.26	And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,
334.26	which is in Portugal.
336.26	As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.
339.26	So many such
341.26	that it's now just a home for bacteria
344.26	who really like acidic, toxic conditions.
347.26	But anyway, the water I dragged back
349.26	from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --
351.26	there was enough copper in it
353.26	such that I could cast the pins
355.26	of my metal electric plug.
357.26	So my next thing: I was off to Scotland
360.26	to get mica.
363.26	And mica is a mineral
366.26	which is a very good insulator
369.26	and very good at insulating electricity.
372.26	That's me getting mica.
375.26	And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,
378.26	and, of course,
380.26	my toaster had to have a plastic case.
382.26	Plastic is the defining feature
384.26	of cheap electrical goods.
386.26	And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP
389.26	and spent a good half an hour
391.26	trying to convince the PR office at BP
393.26	that it would be fantastic for them
395.26	if they flew me to an oil rig
397.26	and let me have a jug of oil.
399.26	BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.
403.26	But even then
405.26	they weren't convinced
407.26	"and said, ""Okay, we'll phone you back"" -- never did."
410.26	So I looked at other ways of making plastic.
413.26	And you can actually make plastic
415.26	from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.
418.26	So this is attempting to make
420.26	potato starch plastic.
422.26	And for a while that was looking really good.
424.26	I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,
426.26	which I've made from a tree trunk.
428.26	And it was looking good for a while,
430.26	but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,
433.26	and unfortunately I came back
435.26	and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.
439.26	So kind of out of desperation,
442.26	I decided that I could think laterally.
445.26	And geologists have actually christened --
447.26	well, they're debating whether to christen --
449.26	the age that we're living in --
451.26	they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch
454.26	called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.
457.26	And that's because geologists of the future
459.26	would kind of see a sharp shift
461.26	in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.
463.26	So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl
466.26	and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs
468.26	that have been set off since 1945.
472.26	And there'd also be an extinction event --
475.26	like fossils would suddenly disappear.
478.26	And also, I thought
480.26	that there would be
482.26	synthetic polymers,
484.26	plastics, embedded in the rock.
486.26	So I looked up a plastic --
488.26	so I decided that I could mine
490.26	some of this modern-day rock.
492.26	And I went up to Manchester
494.26	to visit a place called Axion Recycling.
497.26	And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,
500.26	which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.
505.26	And that was brought into force
507.26	to try and deal with the mountain of stuff
510.26	that is just being made
513.26	and then living for a while in our homes
515.26	and then going to landfill.
517.26	But this is it.
526.26	(Music)
587.26	(Laughter)
589.26	So there's a picture
591.26	of my toaster.
593.26	(Applause)
597.26	That's it without the case on.
600.26	And there it is on the shelves.
603.26	Thanks.
605.26	(Applause)
609.26	Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.
611.26	TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.
613.26	I don't know if you could see,
615.26	but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.
618.26	Kew Gardens were insistent
620.26	that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.
623.26	So the wires were uninsulated.
625.26	So there was 240 volts
627.26	going through these homemade copper wires,
629.26	homemade plug.
631.26	And for about five seconds,
633.26	the toaster toasted,
635.26	but then, unfortunately,
637.26	the element kind of melted itself.
640.26	But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.
643.26	BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.
