12.761	What has the War on Drugs 
12.761	done to the world?
16.975	Look at the murder and mayhem in Mexico,
19.152	Central America, so many 
19.152	other parts of the planet,
22.999	the global black market estimated
24.799	at 300 billion dollars a year,
27.375	prisons packed in the 
27.375	United States and elsewhere,
30.817	police and military drawn 
30.817	into an unwinnable war
33.495	that violates basic rights, 
33.495	and ordinary citizens
36.757	just hope they don't get 
36.757	caught in the crossfire,
39.738	and meanwhile, more people using
42.1	more drugs than ever.
44.361	It's my country's history 
44.361	with alcohol prohibition
46.656	and Al Capone, times 50.
49.783	Which is why it's 
49.783	particularly galling to me
53.336	as an American that we've 
53.336	been the driving force
56.465	behind this global drug war.
58.501	Ask why so many countries criminalize
60.503	drugs they'd never heard of,
62.292	why the U.N. drug treaties emphasize
65.318	criminalization over health,
67.54	even why most of the money worldwide
69.884	for dealing with drug abuse goes not
71.549	to helping agencies but those that punish,
74.32	and you'll find the good old U.S. of A.
77.639	Why did we do this?
79.817	Some people, especially in Latin America,
83.113	think it's not really about drugs.
84.846	It's just a subterfuge for advancing
87.009	the realpolitik interests of the U.S.
90.167	But by and large, that's not it.
93.53	We don't want gangsters and guerrillas
96.443	funded with illegal drug money
98.513	terrorizing and taking over other nations.
101.629	No, the fact is, America really is crazy
106.2	when it comes to drugs.
108.04	I mean, don't forget, we're 
108.04	the ones who thought
110.2	that we could prohibit alcohol.
111.866	So think about our global drug war
114.149	not as any sort of rational policy,
116.885	but as the international projection
119.627	of a domestic psychosis.
123.114	(Applause)
126.16	But here's the good news.
127.827	Now it's the Russians leading
127.827	the Drug War and not us.
131.12	Most politicians in my country
132.7	want to roll back the Drug War now,
134.021	put fewer people behind bars, not more,
136.833	and I'm proud to say as an American
139.342	that we now lead the world
140.926	in reforming marijuana policies.
143.166	It's now legal for medical purposes
145.112	in almost half our 50 states,
146.912	millions of people can 
146.912	purchase their marijuana,
149.274	their medicine, in government-
149.274	licensed dispensaries,
152.19	and over half my fellow 
152.19	citizens now say it's time
155.27	to legally regulate and tax marijuana
157.643	more or less like alcohol.
159.32	That's what Colorado and 
159.32	Washington are doing,
161.287	and Uruguay, and others 
161.287	are sure to follow.
165.673	So that's what I do:
168.161	work to end the Drug War.
171.967	I think it all started growing up
174.626	in a fairly religious, moral family,
177.205	eldest son of a rabbi,
179.241	going off to university where I
181.412	smoked some marijuana
184.762	and I liked it. (Laughter)
186.98	And I liked drinking too, but it was obvious
189.455	that alcohol was really the
189.455	more dangerous of the two,
191.93	but my friends and I could get busted
193.617	for smoking a joint.
195.19	Now, that hypocrisy kept bugging me,
197.749	so I wrote my Ph.D dissertation
197.749	on international drug control.
200.69	I talked my way into the State Department.
203.18	I got a security clearance.
204.409	I interviewed hundreds of DEA
204.409	and other law enforcement agents
207.373	all around Europe and the Americas,
209.53	and I'd ask them,
210.761	"""What do you think the answer is?"""
213.385	Well, in Latin America, they'd say to me,
216.165	"""You can't really cut off the supply."
218.98	The answer lies back in the U.S.,
220.534	"in cutting off the demand."""
222.337	So then I go back home and I talk to people
224.853	involved in anti-drug efforts there, and they'd say,
227.453	"""You know, Ethan, you can't "
227.453	really cut off the demand.
230.681	The answer lies over there.
230.681	"You've got to cut off the supply."""
233.628	Then I'd go and talk 
233.628	to the guys in customs
236.238	trying to stop drugs at the borders,
238.6	"and they'd say, ""You're "
238.6	not going to stop it here.
241.817	The answer lies over there,
243.786	"in cutting off supply and demand."""
246.778	And it hit me:
248.408	Everybody involved in this
250.693	thought the answer lay in that area
253.133	about which they knew the least.
256.141	So that's when I started 
256.141	reading everything I could
258.645	about psychoactive drugs: 
258.645	the history, the science,
261.525	the politics, all of it,
263.63	and the more one read,
265.946	the more it hit you how a thoughtful,
268.488	enlightened, intelligent 
268.488	approach took you over here,
271.852	whereas the politics and laws of my country
274.36	were taking you over here.
276.396	And that disparity struck me as this incredible
280.187	intellectual and moral puzzle.
286.385	There's probably never been
288.411	a drug-free society.
291.02	Virtually every society
292.77	has ingested psychoactive substances
295.171	to deal with pain, increase 
295.171	our energy, socialize,
298.786	even commune with God.
300.819	Our desire to alter our consciousness
303.507	may be as fundamental as our desires
305.937	for food, companionship and sex.
309.854	So our true challenge
311.991	is to learn how to live with drugs
314.871	so they cause the least possible harm
317.627	and in some cases the 
317.627	greatest possible benefit.
321.84	I'll tell you something else I learned,
323.91	that the reason some drugs 
323.91	are legal and others not
326.998	has almost nothing to do 
326.998	with science or health
329.956	or the relative risk of drugs,
331.789	and almost everything to do with who uses
334.185	and who is perceived 
334.185	to use particular drugs.
337.313	In the late 19th century,
339.383	when most of the drugs that
339.383	are now illegal were legal,
342.723	the principal consumers 
342.723	of opiates in my country
345.435	and others were middle-aged white women,
349.239	using them to alleviate aches and pains
351.598	when few other analgesics were available.
354.32	And nobody thought about 
354.32	criminalizing it back then
356.481	because nobody wanted to 
356.481	put Grandma behind bars.
359.478	But when hundreds of thousands of Chinese
361.936	started showing up in my country,
363.725	working hard on the railroads and the mines
366.323	and then kicking back in the evening
367.802	just like they had in the old country
369.506	with a few puffs on that opium pipe,
372.163	that's when you saw the 
372.163	first drug prohibition laws
374.48	in California and Nevada,
376.28	driven by racist fears of Chinese
378.158	transforming white women
379.994	into opium-addicted sex slaves.
383.378	The first cocaine prohibition 
383.378	laws, similarly prompted
386.213	by racist fears of black men 
386.213	sniffing that white powder
389.98	and forgetting their proper place
391.859	in Southern society.
393.813	And the first marijuana prohibition laws,
395.796	all about fears of Mexican migrants
397.869	in the West and the Southwest.
401.645	And what was true in my country,
404.379	is true in so many others as well,
406.876	with both the origins of these laws
409.12	and their implementation.
412.543	Put it this way,
414.16	and I exaggerate only slightly:
416.841	If the principal smokers of cocaine
419.923	were affluent older white men
421.917	and the principal consumers of Viagra
424.906	were poor young black men,
426.8	then smokable cocaine would be easy to
426.8	get with a prescription from your doctor
429.912	and selling Viagra would get you 
429.912	five to 10 years behind bars.
433.197	(Applause)
436.981	I used to be a professor teaching about this.
440.835	Now I'm an activist, a human rights activist,
444.49	and what drives me is my shame
447.251	at living in an otherwise great nation
449.429	that has less than five percent
449.429	of the world's population
452.212	but almost 25 percent of the
452.212	world's incarcerated population.
455.84	It's the people I meet 
455.84	who have lost someone
458.241	they love to drug-related 
458.241	violence or prison
460.795	or overdose or AIDS
462.257	because our drug policies emphasize
464.237	criminalization over health.
466.261	It's good people who have lost their jobs,
469.49	their homes, their freedom, 
469.49	even their children
473.12	to the state, not because they hurt anyone
476.588	but solely because they chose to use one drug
479.813	instead of another.
482.827	So is legalization the answer?
487.176	On that, I'm torn:
489.213	three days a week I think yes,
489.213	three days a week I think no,
492.396	and on Sundays I'm agnostic.
494.616	But since today is Tuesday,
497.142	let me just say that legally 
497.142	regulating and taxing
501.844	most of the drugs that 
501.844	are now criminalized
504.262	would radically reduce 
504.262	the crime, violence,
506.636	corruption and black markets,
508.368	and the problems of adulterated
508.368	and unregulated drugs,
511.405	and improve public safety,
513.352	and allow taxpayer resources to be developed
515.556	to more useful purposes.
517.772	I mean, look, the markets 
517.772	in marijuana, cocaine,
521.552	heroin and methamphetamine
523.565	are global commodities markets
526.13	just like the global markets 
526.13	in alcohol, tobacco,
529.325	coffee, sugar, and so many other things.
532.205	Where there is a demand,
534.601	there will be a supply.
537.124	Knock out one source and another
539.28	inevitably emerges.
540.99	People tend to think of prohibition
543.37	as the ultimate form of regulation
545.868	when in fact it represents 
545.868	the abdication of regulation
549.887	with criminals filling the void.
553.904	Which is why putting criminal laws and police
556.164	front and center in trying to control
559.382	a dynamic global commodities market
562.486	is a recipe for disaster.
565.355	And what we really need to do
567.526	is to bring the underground drug markets
569.9	as much as possible aboveground
572.813	and regulate them as 
572.813	intelligently as we can
576.885	to minimize both the harms of drugs
579.674	and the harms of prohibitionist policies.
583.162	Now, with marijuana, that obviously means
586.727	legally regulating and 
586.727	taxing it like alcohol.
589.393	The benefits of doing so are
589.393	enormous, the risks minimal.
592.723	Will more people use marijuana?
595.434	Maybe, but it's not 
595.434	going to be young people,
599.405	because it's not going to 
599.405	be legalized for them,
601.407	and quite frankly, they already have
603.218	the best access to marijuana.
605.254	I think it's going to be older people.
607.403	It's going to be people in their 40s and 60s
609.562	and 80s who find they prefer a little marijuana
613.208	to that drink in the evening or the sleeping pill
616.498	or that it helps with 
616.498	their arthritis or diabetes
620.138	or maybe helps spice up a 
620.138	long-term marriage. (Laughter)
625.33	And that just might be a 
625.33	net public health benefit.
628.484	As for the other drugs,
630.846	look at Portugal, where 
630.846	nobody goes to jail
633.467	for possessing drugs,
635.23	and the government's made 
635.23	a serious commitment
636.6	to treating addiction as a health issue.
638.81	Look at Switzerland, 
638.81	Germany, the Netherlands,
640.711	Denmark, England, where people who have
642.657	been addicted to heroin for many years
644.558	and repeatedly tried to quit and failed
646.864	can get pharmaceutical 
646.864	heroin and helping services
649.722	in medical clinics, and 
649.722	the results are in:
653.163	Illegal drug abuse and disease
656.227	and overdoses and crime 
656.227	and arrests all go down,
660.374	health and well-being improve,
662.523	taxpayers benefit,
664.255	and many drug users even
664.255	put their addictions behind them.
668.405	Look at New Zealand, which 
668.405	recently enacted a law
671.207	allowing certain recreational 
671.207	drugs to be sold legally
674.142	provided their safety had been established.
676.843	Look here in Brazil, and some other countries,
679.542	where a remarkable psychoactive substance,
682.605	ayahuasca, can be legally 
682.605	bought and consumed
685.83	provided it's done so 
685.83	within a religious context.
688.958	Look in Bolivia and Peru,
690.96	where all sorts of products 
690.96	made from the coca leaf,
693.749	the source of cocaine,
695.65	are sold legally over the counter
697.27	with no apparent harm to people's public health.
700.403	I mean, don't forget, Coca-Cola
700.403	had cocaine in it until 1900,
704.439	and so far as we know was no more addictive
706.407	than Coca-Cola is today.
710.46	Conversely, think about cigarettes:
713.537	Nothing can both hook you 
713.537	and kill you like cigarettes.
718.523	When researchers ask heroin addicts
721.587	what's the toughest drug to 
721.587	quit, most say cigarettes.
724.793	Yet in my country and many others,
727.167	half of all the people who 
727.167	were ever addicted
729.709	to cigarettes have quit
731.644	without anyone being 
731.644	arrested or put in jail
734.652	"or sent to a ""treatment program"""
736.908	by a prosecutor or a judge.
738.641	What did it were higher taxes
741.937	and time and place 
741.937	restrictions on sale and use
745.48	and effective anti-smoking campaigns.
748.552	Now, could we reduce smoking even more
752.492	by making it totally illegal? Probably.
756.831	But just imagine the drug war nightmare
760.442	that would result.
763.48	So the challenges we face today
765.763	are twofold.
767.63	The first is the policy challenge
770.645	of designing and implementing alternatives
774.323	to ineffective prohibitionist policies,
776.741	even as we need to get 
776.741	better at regulating
780.161	and living with the drugs 
780.161	that are now legal.
783.83	But the second challenge is tougher,
787.191	because it's about us.
790.802	The obstacles to reform 
790.802	lie not just out there
794.29	in the power of the 
794.29	prison industrial complex
796.45	or other vested interests 
796.45	that want to keep things
798.654	the way they are,
800.08	but within each and every one of us.
803.92	It's our fears and our lack of knowledge
807.97	and imagination that stands 
807.97	in the way of real reform.
814.67	And ultimately, I think that 
814.67	boils down to the kids,
819.24	and to every parent's desire
819.24	to put our baby in a bubble,
822.985	and the fear that somehow
822.985	drugs will pierce that bubble
826.315	and put our young ones at risk.
828.244	In fact, sometimes it 
828.244	seems like the entire
830.314	War on Drugs gets justified
832.29	as one great big child protection act,
836.216	which any young person 
836.216	can tell you it's not.
839.823	So here's what I say to teenagers.
843.929	First, don't do drugs.
847.615	Second, don't do drugs.
851.405	Third, if you do do drugs,
854.825	there's some things I want you to know,
857.367	because my bottom line as your parent is,
861.41	come home safely at the end of the night
864.391	and grow up and lead a 
864.391	healthy and good adulthood.
867.924	That's my drug education 
867.924	mantra: Safety first.
873.537	So this is what I've dedicated my life to,
877.193	to building an organization and a movement
879.701	of people who believe we 
879.701	need to turn our backs
882.561	on the failed prohibitions of the past
884.606	and embrace new drug 
884.606	policies grounded in science,
887.305	compassion, health and human rights,
890.246	where people who come from
890.246	across the political spectrum
892.884	and every other spectrum as well,
894.865	where people who love our drugs,
896.599	people who hate drugs,
897.938	and people who don't give 
897.938	a damn about drugs,
900.25	but every one of us believes 
900.25	that this War on Drugs,
903.684	this backward, heartless, 
903.684	disastrous War on Drugs,
907.931	has got to end.
911.03	Thank you.
912.873	(Applause)
927.042	Thank you. Thank you.
929.722	Chris Anderson: Ethan,
931.943	congrats — quite the reaction.
935.182	That was a powerful talk.
937.926	Not quite a complete standing O, though,
941.234	and I'm guessing that some people here
942.921	and maybe a few watching online,
945.187	maybe someone knows a teenager or a friend
949.287	or whatever who got sick,
951.504	maybe died from some drug overdose.
954.5	I'm sure you've had these
954.5	people approach you before.
956.386	What do you say to them?
958.557	Ethan Nadelmann: Chris, the most
958.557	amazing thing that's happened of late
960.739	is that I've met a growing number of people
962.98	who have actually 
962.98	lost a sibling or a child
965.558	to a drug overdose,
967.184	and 10 years ago, those 
967.184	people just wanted to say,
969.16	let's line up all the drug 
969.16	dealers and shoot them
971.14	and that will solve it.
972.481	And what they've come to understand
973.776	is that the Drug War did 
973.776	nothing to protect their kids.
976.659	If anything, it made it more likely
978.108	that those kids were put at risk.
980.21	And so they're now becoming part of this
981.82	drug policy reform movement.
983.695	There's other people who have kids,
985.385	one's addicted to alcohol, the other
985.385	one's addicted to cocaine or heroin,
988.85	and they ask themselves the question:
990.278	Why does this kid get to 
990.278	take one step at a time
992.595	and try to get better
993.889	and that one's got to deal with jail
995.453	and police and criminals all the time?
997.478	So everybody's understanding,
998.948	the Drug War's not protecting anybody.
1001.673	CA: Certainly in the U.S., 
1001.673	you've got political gridlock
1003.754	on most issues.
1005.149	Is there any realistic chance of anything
1006.881	actually shifting on this 
1006.881	issue in the next five years?
1010.227	EN: I'd say it's quite remarkable. 
1010.227	I'm getting all these calls
1012.245	from journalists now who are saying to me,
1014.126	"""Ethan, it seems like the only two issues"
1016.13	advancing politically in America right now
1018.423	are marijuana law reform and gay marriage.
1021.314	"What are you doing right?"""
1022.891	And then you're looking at 
1022.891	bipartisanship breaking out
1025.479	with, actually, Republicans in the Congress
1027.771	and state legislatures 
1027.771	allowing bills to be enacted
1030.84	with majority Democratic support,
1032.804	so we've gone from being sort of the third rail,
1035.32	the most fearful issue of American politics,
1037.411	to becoming one of the most successful.
1040.161	CA: Ethan, thank you so much for coming to TEDGlobal.
1040.161	EN: Chris, thanks so much.
1042.344	CA: Thank you.
1042.344	EN: Thank you. (Applause)
