12.691	Whenever I get to travel for work,
14.794	I try to find out where my
14.794	drinking water comes from,
17.326	and where my poop and pee go.
19.017	(Laughter)
20.885	This has earned me the nickname
20.885	"""The Poo Princess"" in my family,"
23.936	and it's ruined many family vacations,
23.936	because this is not normal.
28.612	But thinking about where it all goes
28.612	is the first step in activating
33.897	what are actually superpowers
33.897	in our poop and pee.
36.736	(Laughter)
37.836	Yeah.
39.014	And if we use them well,
40.196	we can live healthier
40.196	and more beautifully.
42.371	Check out this landscape
42.371	in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
46.771	Just notice what kinds of words
46.771	and feelings come to mind.
51.588	This landscape was watered
51.588	with treated sewage water.
55.892	Does that change anything for you?
58.458	I imagine it might.
62.191	And that's OK.
64.897	How we feel about this
67.118	is going to determine exactly
67.118	how innovative we can be.
70.589	And I want to explain how it works,
74.675	but what words do I use?
77.471	I mean, I can use profane words
77.471	"like ""shit"" and ""piss,"""
81.147	and then my grandma won't watch the video.
83.451	Or I can use childish words
83.451	"like ""poo"" and ""pee."" Eh."
87.252	Or I can use scientific words
87.252	"like ""excrement"" and ""feces."" Humph."
91.994	I'll use a mix.
93.285	(Laughter)
94.649	It's all I got. (Laughs)
97.678	So, in this suburb,
99.195	the poo and the pee and the wash water
99.195	are going to this treatment plant
103.144	right in the middle of the community.
105.285	It looks more like a park
105.285	than a treatment plant.
107.97	The poo at the very bottom
107.97	of all those layers of gravel --
111.38	not touching anyone --
112.92	is providing solid food
112.92	for those marsh plants.
116.238	And the clean, clear water
116.238	that comes out the other end
119.543	is traveling underground
119.543	to water each person's yard.
123.328	So even though they're in a desert,
125.047	they get their own personal oasis.
127.963	This approach is called
127.963	Integrated Water Management,
131.199	or holistic or closed-loop.
134.071	Whatever you want to call it,
135.612	it's in conflict with the status quo
135.612	of how we think about sanitation,
139.271	which is contain, treat, push it away.
143.239	But in this approach,
143.239	we're doing one step better.
145.609	We're designing for reuse
145.609	from the very beginning,
147.995	because everything does get reused,
150.587	only now we're planning for it.
152.765	And often, that makes for
152.765	really beautiful spaces.
157.042	But the most important thing
157.042	about this system
161.131	isn't the technicals of how it works.
163.812	It's how you feel about it.
166.002	Do you want this in your yard?
168.507	Why not?
170.368	I got really curious about this question.
173.111	Why don't we see more
173.111	innovation in sanitation?
176.475	Why isn't that kind of thing
176.475	the new normal?
179.61	And I care so much about this question,
181.814	that I work for a nonprofit called Recode.
183.997	We want to accelerate adoption
185.925	of sustainable building
185.925	and development practices.
188.721	We want more innovation.
192.274	But a lot of times,
192.274	whole categories of innovation --
195.375	ones that can help us
195.375	live more beautifully --
198.197	turn out to be illegal.
200.728	Today's regulations and codes
200.728	were written under the assumption
204.204	that best practices
204.204	would remain best practices,
208.242	with incremental updates forever and ever.
211.387	But innovation isn't always incremental.
214.285	It turns out, how we feel
214.285	about any particular new technique
217.79	gets into everything we do:
219.663	how we talk about it,
220.957	how we encourage people to study,
222.807	our jokes, our codes ...
224.754	And it ultimately determines
224.754	how innovative we can be.
228.503	So, that's the first reason
228.503	we don't innovate in sanitation.
233.079	We're kind of uncomfortable
233.079	talking about sanitation,
236.416	that's why I've gotten called
236.416	"""The Poo Princess"" so much."
239.142	The second reason is:
240.857	we think the problem is solved
240.857	here in the US.
243.833	But not so.
245.087	Here in the US we still get sick
245.087	from drinking shit in our sewage water.
250.699	Seven million people get sick every year,
254.663	And we're not taking a holistic
254.663	approach to making it better.
259.125	So we're not solving it.
261.749	Where I live in Portland, Oregon,
263.448	I can't take Echo for a swim
263.448	during the rainy season,
266.275	because we dump raw sewage
266.275	sometimes into our river.
269.905	Our rainwater and our sewage
269.905	go to the same treatment plant.
273.904	Too much rain overflows into the river.
277.53	And Portland is not alone here.
279.569	Forty percent of municipalities self-report
282.683	dumping raw or partially treated
282.683	sewage into our waterways.
287.442	The other bummer going on here
287.442	with our status quo
290.624	is that half of all of your poop and pee
290.624	is going to fertilize farmland.
295.819	The other half is being incinerated
298.209	or land-filled.
299.447	And that's a bummer to me,
300.979	because there are amazing nutrients
300.979	in your daily doody.
303.965	It is comparable to pig manure;
306.155	we're omnivores, they're omnivores.
309.24	Think of your poo and pee
309.24	as a health smoothie for a tree.
312.647	(Laughter)
317.357	The other bummer going on here
319.19	is that we're quickly moving
319.19	all the drugs we take into our waterways.
323.971	The average wastewater treatment plant
323.971	can remove maybe half of the drugs
328.226	that come in.
329.91	The other half goes
329.91	right out the other side.
332.564	Consider what a cocktail
332.564	of pharmaceuticals --
336.044	hormones, steroids, Vicodin --
338.089	does to a fish,
339.896	to a dog,
341.142	to a child.
344.322	But this isn't just some problem
344.322	that we need to contain.
348.215	If we flip this around,
348.215	we can create a resource
350.637	that can solve so many
350.637	of our other problems.
353.758	And I want to get you
353.758	comfortable with this idea,
356.162	so imagine the things I'm going
356.162	to show you, these technologies,
360.335	and this attitude that says,
362.348	"""We're going to reuse this."
363.72	"Let's design to make it beautiful"" --"
365.958	as advanced potty training.
367.515	(Laughter)
368.562	I think you're ready for it.
370.312	I think we as a culture are ready
370.312	for advanced potty training.
374.527	And there are three great
374.527	reasons to enroll today.
377.03	Number one:
379.094	we can fertilize our food.
381.016	Each one of us is pooping
381.016	and peeing something
383.552	that could fertilize half
383.552	or maybe all of our food,
386.315	depending on our diet.
389.06	That dark brown poo in the toilet
389.06	is dark brown because of what?
392.359	Dead stuff, bacteria.
394.249	That's carbon.
395.424	And carbon, if we're getting
395.424	that into the soil,
397.754	is going to bind to the other minerals
397.754	and nutrients in there.
401.187	Boom! Healthier food.
403.443	Voil√†! Healthier people.
406.325	Chemical fertilizers by definition
406.325	don't have carbon in them.
411.221	Imagine if we could move our animal manure
411.221	and our human manure to our soil,
416.608	we might not need to rely
416.608	on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,
420.438	mine minerals from far away.
423.395	Imagine how much energy we could save.
427.23	Now, some of us are concerned
430.314	about industrial pollutants
430.314	contaminating this reuse cycle.
435.322	That can be addressed.
437.445	But we need to separate our discomfort
437.445	about talking about poo and pee
442.403	so we can calmly talk
442.403	about how we want to reuse it
446.791	and what things we don't want to reuse.
449.456	And get this:
451.598	if we change our approach to sanitation,
454.417	we can start to slow down climate change.
458.234	Remember that carbon in the poop?
460.8	If we can get that into our soil bank,
463.489	it's going to start to absorb
463.489	carbon dioxide that we put into the air.
468.154	And that could help
468.154	slow down global warming.
471.397	I want to show you some brave souls
473.928	who've had the courage to embrace
473.928	this advanced potty training approach.
479.028	So those folks in New Mexico --
480.743	why did they do it?
482.735	'Cause they're in a desert?
482.735	'Cause they save money? Yeah.
485.842	But more importantly,
485.842	they felt comfortable
490.217	seeing what was going
490.217	down the toilet as a resource.
493.642	Here's an average house
493.642	in Portland, Oregon.
495.762	This house is special
495.762	because they have a composting toilet
498.723	turning all their poo and pee,
498.723	over time, into a soil amendment.
503.547	Their wash water, their shower water,
503.547	is going underground
506.465	to a series of mulch basins,
509.127	and then watering that orchard downhill.
512.392	When they went to get this permitted,
514.901	it wasn't allowed in Oregon.
517.222	But it was allowed
517.222	in five other states nearby.
520.322	That was Recode's -- my organization's --
520.322	first code-change campaign.
526.158	Here's a great example where
526.158	the Integrated Water Management approach
530.644	was the cheapest.
532.108	This is three high-rise residential
532.108	buildings in downtown Portland,
536.728	and they're not flushing
536.728	to the sewer system.
539.332	How?
540.515	Well, their wash water
540.515	is getting reused to flush toilets,
544.461	cool mechanical systems,
546.152	water the landscape.
548.028	And then once the building
548.028	has thoroughly used everything --
550.906	aka, shat in it --
552.453	it's treated to highest standard
552.453	right on-site by plants and bacteria,
557.099	and then infiltrated
557.099	into the groundwater right below.
561.371	And all that was cheaper
564.898	than updating the surrounding
564.898	sewer infrastructure.
568.553	So that's the last reason
568.553	we should get really excited
571.115	about doing things differently:
572.631	we can save a lot of money.
576.085	This was the first permit
576.085	of its kind in Oregon.
579.597	Brave and open-minded people
579.597	sat down and felt comfortable saying,
584.41	"""Yeah, that shit makes sense."""
585.934	(Laughter)
588.426	"""Let's do it."""
589.691	(Applause)
590.716	You know?
591.891	I keep showing examples
594.064	where everyone's reusing
594.064	everything on-site.
596.246	Why?
597.421	Well, when we look at our aging
597.421	infrastructure -- and it is old --
600.719	and we look at the cost of updating it,
602.646	three-quarters of that cost is just
602.646	the pipes snaking through our city.
607.666	So as we build anew, as we renovate,
609.869	it might make more sense
609.869	to treat and reuse everything on-site.
615.499	San Francisco realized that it made sense
618.094	to invest in rebates for every household
620.792	to reuse their wash water
620.792	and their rainwater
623.349	to water the backyard,
625.006	because the amount of water they would
625.006	save as a community would be so big.
630.261	But why were all
630.261	these projects so innovative?
633.434	The money piece, yeah.
635.963	But more importantly,
637.638	they felt comfortable with this idea
637.638	of advanced potty training.
641.572	Imagine if we embraced
641.572	innovation for sanitation
646.624	the way we have for, say, solar power.
650.565	Think about it -- solar power used
650.565	to be uncommon and unaffordable.
654.144	Now it's more a part
654.144	of our web of power than ever before.
657.721	And it's creating resiliency.
660.13	We now have sources of power like the sun
662.988	that don't vary with our earthly dramas.
666.282	What's driving all that innovation?
669.002	It's us.
670.4	We're talking about energy.
672.447	It's cool to talk about energy.
676.032	Some folks are even talking
676.032	about the problems
678.207	with the limited resources
678.207	where our current energy is coming from.
681.397	We encourage our best and brightest
681.397	to work on this issue --
685.485	better solar panels,
685.485	better batteries, everything.
690.099	So let's talk about where
690.099	our drinking water is coming from,
693.233	where our poo and pee are actually going.
696.344	If we can get over this discomfort
696.344	with this entire topic,
701.308	we could create something
701.308	that creates our future goldmine.
705.158	Every time you flush the toilet,
706.803	I want you to think,
708.446	"""Where is my poop and pee going?"
710.494	"Will they be gainfully employed?"""
712.421	(Laughter)
713.697	"""Or are they going to be wreaking"
713.697	"havoc in some waterway?"""
716.899	If you don't know, find out.
718.826	And if you don't like the answer,
720.628	figure out how you can communicate
720.628	to those who can drive this change
724.379	that you have advanced potty training,
724.379	that you are ready for reuse.
728.415	How all of you feel
730.866	is going to determine exactly
730.866	how innovative we can be.
734.191	Thank you so much.
735.374	(Applause)
