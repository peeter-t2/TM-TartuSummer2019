13.02	When I was a child,
13.02	I knew I had superpowers.
18.74	That's right.
19.98	(Laughter)
21.1	I thought I was absolutely amazing
21.1	because I could understand
25.14	and relate to the feelings
25.14	of brown people,
27.3	like my grandfather,
27.3	a conservative Muslim guy.
31.18	And also, I could understand
31.18	my Afghan mother, my Pakistani father,
36.1	not so religious
36.1	but laid-back, fairly liberal.
40.3	And of course, I could understand
41.94	and relate to the feelings
41.94	of white people.
44.38	The white Norwegians of my country.
47.3	You know, white, brown, whatever --
49.9	I loved them all.
51.74	I understood them all,
53.02	even if they didn't always
53.02	understand each other;
55.38	they were all my people.
57.42	My father, though,
57.42	was always really worried.
60.38	He kept saying that
60.38	even with the best education,
63.74	I was not going to get a fair shake.
66.94	I would still face discrimination,
66.94	according to him.
70.38	And that the only way
70.38	to be accepted by white people
73.22	would be to become famous.
75.42	Now, mind you, he had this conversation
75.42	with me when I was seven years old.
80.26	So while I'm seven years old, he said,
83.26	"""Look, so it's either got to be sports,"
83.26	"or it's got to be music."""
86.66	He didn't know anything about sports --
86.66	bless him -- so it was music.
91.14	So when I was seven years old,
91.14	he gathered all my toys, all my dolls,
95.5	and he threw them all away.
97.98	In exchange he gave me
97.98	a crappy little Casio keyboard and --
101.86	(Laughter)
103.1	Yeah. And singing lessons.
105.14	And he forced me, basically, to practice
105.14	for hours and hours every single day.
109.94	Very quickly, he also had me performing
109.94	for larger and larger audiences,
114.22	and bizarrely, I became
114.22	almost a kind of poster child
118.02	for Norwegian multiculturalism.
120.58	I felt very proud, of course.
122.34	Because even the newspapers at this point
125.7	were starting to write
125.7	nice things about brown people,
128.3	so I could feel
128.3	that my superpower was growing.
132.78	So when I was 12 years old,
132.78	walking home from school,
135.78	I took a little detour
137.02	because I wanted to buy
137.02	"my favorite sweets called ""salty feet."""
140.579	I know they sound kind of awful,
143.46	but I absolutely love them.
144.98	They're basically these little
144.98	salty licorice bits in the shape of feet.
149.94	And now that I say it out loud,
149.94	I realize how terrible that sounds,
156.1	but be that as it may,
156.1	I absolutely love them.
158.62	So on my way into the store,
160.74	there was this grown white guy
160.74	in the doorway blocking my way.
165.3	So I tried to walk around him,
165.3	and as I did that, he stopped me
171.26	and he was staring at me,
174.02	and he spit in my face, and he said,
175.98	"""Get out of my way"
177.22	you little black bitch,
177.22	you little Paki bitch,
180.5	"go back home where you came from."""
183.42	I was absolutely horrified.
186.54	I was staring at him.
187.86	I was too afraid
187.86	to wipe the spit off my face,
191.66	even as it was mixing with my tears.
193.82	I remember looking around,
193.82	hoping that any minute now,
197.54	a grown-up is going to come
197.54	and make this guy stop.
201.22	But instead, people kept hurrying past me
201.22	and pretended not to see me.
205.98	I was very confused
205.98	because I was thinking, well,
210.46	"""My white people, come on!"
210.46	Where are they? What's going on?
213.78	How come they're not
213.78	"coming and rescuing me?"""
216.58	So, needless to say,
216.58	I didn't buy the sweets.
218.86	I just ran home as fast as I could.
221.86	Things were still OK, though, I thought.
224.62	As time went on,
224.62	the more successful I became,
227.74	I eventually started also
227.74	attracting harassment from brown people.
233.34	Some men in my parent's community
233.34	felt that it was unacceptable
236.66	and dishonorable for a woman
236.66	to be involved in music
241.54	and to be so present in the media.
245.1	So very quickly, I was starting
245.1	to become attacked at my own concerts.
250.54	I remember one of the concerts,
250.54	I was onstage, I lean into the audience
255.58	and the last thing I see
255.58	is a young brown face,
258.86	and the next thing I know is some sort
258.86	of chemical is thrown in my eyes
263.1	and I remember I couldn't really see
263.1	and my eyes were watering
266.34	but I kept singing anyway.
268.659	I was spit in the face in the streets
268.659	of Oslo, this time by brown men.
274.18	They even tried to kidnap me at one point.
277.42	The death threats were endless.
279.5	I remember one older bearded guy
279.5	stopped me in the street one time,
282.78	"and he said, ""The reason"
282.78	I hate you so much
284.94	is because you make our daughters think
287.02	"they can do whatever they want."""
290.38	A younger guy warned me to watch my back.
293.22	He said music is un-Islamic
293.22	and the job of whores,
296.26	and if you keep this up,
296.26	you are going to be raped
299.02	and your stomach will be cut out so that
299.02	another whore like you will not be born.
305.38	Again, I was so confused.
307.1	I couldn't understand what was going on.
309.029	My brown people now starting
309.029	to treat me like this -- how come?
313.38	Instead of bridging the worlds,
313.38	the two worlds,
316.5	I felt like I was falling
316.5	between my two worlds.
319.82	I suppose, for me, spit was kryptonite.
324.38	So by the time I was 17 years old,
326.42	the death threats were endless,
326.42	and the harassment was constant.
329.46	It got so bad, at one point
329.46	my mother sat me down and said,
332.246	"""Look, we can no longer protect you,"
332.246	we can no longer keep you safe,
335.74	"so you're going to have to go."""
337.54	So I bought a one-way ticket to London,
337.54	I packed my suitcase and I left.
343.98	My biggest heartbreak at that point
343.98	was that nobody said anything.
347.7	I had a very public exit from Norway.
350.94	My brown people, my white people --
350.94	nobody said anything.
354.5	"Nobody said, ""Hold on, this is wrong."
357.78	Support this girl, protect this girl,
357.78	"because she is one of us."""
361.5	Nobody said that.
363.14	Instead, I felt like --
363.14	you know at the airport,
366.94	on the baggage carousel
366.94	you have these different suitcases
369.82	going around and around,
371.1	and there's always
371.1	that one suitcase left at the end,
373.62	the one that nobody wants,
373.62	the one that nobody comes to claim.
376.66	I felt like that.
378.86	I'd never felt so alone.
378.86	I'd never felt so lost.
384.18	So, after coming to London,
384.18	I did eventually resume my music career.
388.82	Different place, but unfortunately
388.82	the same old story.
392.66	I remember a message sent to me
392.66	saying that I was going to be killed
396.22	and that rivers of blood
396.22	were going to flow
399.62	and that I was going to be raped
399.62	many times before I died.
403.1	By this point, I have to say,
404.54	I was actually getting used
404.54	to messages like this,
407.02	but what became different was that
407.02	now they started threatening my family.
412.58	So once again, I packed my suitcase,
412.58	I left music and I moved to the US.
418.34	I'd had enough.
419.62	I didn't want to have anything
419.62	to do with this anymore.
422.26	And I was certainly not
422.26	going to be killed for something
424.94	that wasn't even my dream --
424.94	it was my father's choice.
430.02	So I kind of got lost.
433.22	I kind of fell apart.
434.78	But I decided that what I wanted to do
437.14	is spend the next
437.14	however many years of my life
440.5	supporting young people
442.18	and to try to be there in some small way,
445.1	whatever way that I could.
446.82	I started volunteering
446.82	for various organizations
450.1	that were working
450.1	with young Muslims inside of Europe.
455.9	And, to my surprise, what I found was
458.94	so many of these young people
458.94	were suffering and struggling.
464.26	They were facing so many problems
464.26	with their families and their communities
467.82	who seemed to care more
467.82	about their honor and their reputation
471.46	than the happiness
471.46	and the lives of their own kids.
475.58	I started feeling like maybe I wasn't
475.58	so alone, maybe I wasn't so weird.
480.1	Maybe there are more
480.1	of my people out there.
483.1	The thing is, what most people
483.1	don't understand
485.34	is that there are so many of us
485.34	growing up in Europe
489.66	who are not free to be ourselves.
492.1	We're not allowed to be who we are.
495.18	We are not free to marry
499.26	or to be in relationships
499.26	with people that we choose.
502.22	We can't even pick our own career.
503.9	This is the norm in the Muslim
503.9	heartlands of Europe.
507.7	Even in the freest societies
507.7	in the world, we're not free.
511.46	Our lives, our dreams, our future
511.46	does not belong to us,
515.38	it belongs to our parents
515.38	and their community.
518.66	I found endless stories of young people
522.7	who are lost to all of us,
525.619	who are invisible to all of us
527.379	but who are suffering,
527.379	and they are suffering alone.
531.34	Kids we are losing to forced marriages,
531.34	to honor-based violence and abuse.
537.1	Eventually, I realized after several
537.1	years of working with these young people,
540.82	that I will not be able to keep running.
542.86	I can't spend the rest of my life
542.86	being scared and hiding
547.54	and that I'm actually
547.54	going to have to do something.
551.46	And I also realized
551.46	that my silence, our silence,
554.58	allows abuse like this to continue.
557.82	So I decided that I wanted to put
557.82	my childhood superpower to some use
562.34	by trying to make people on the different
562.34	sides of these issues understand
567.06	what it's like to be a young person stuck
567.06	between your family and your country.
572.78	So I started making films,
572.78	and I started telling these stories.
576.7	And I also wanted people to understand
576.7	the deadly consequences of us
581.14	not taking these problems seriously.
583.82	So the first film I made was about Banaz.
587.26	She was a 17-year-old
587.26	Kurdish girl in London.
591.34	She was obedient, she did
591.34	whatever her parents wanted.
594.66	She tried to do everything right.
597.1	She married some guy
597.1	that her parents chose for her,
599.74	even though he beat
599.74	and raped her constantly.
603.7	And when she tried to go
603.7	to her family for help, they said,
606.54	"""Well, you got to go back"
606.54	"and be a better wife."""
608.82	Because they didn't want
608.82	a divorced daughter on their hands
611.66	because, of course, that would
611.66	bring dishonor on the family.
615.5	She was beaten so badly
615.5	her ears would bleed,
619.02	and when she finally left
619.02	and she found a young man that she chose
624.14	and she fell in love with,
625.98	the community and the family found out
628.26	and she disappeared.
630.26	She was found three months later.
633.02	She'd been stuffed into a suitcase
633.02	and buried underneath the house.
639.86	She had been strangled,
639.86	she had been beaten to death
644.58	by three men, three cousins,
644.58	on the orders of her father and uncle.
649.78	The added tragedy of Banaz's story
651.98	is that she had gone to the police
651.98	in England five times asking for help,
657.9	telling them that she was
657.9	going to be killed by her family.
660.98	The police didn't believe her
660.98	so they didn't do anything.
664.9	And the problem with this
666.18	is that not only are so many of our kids
666.18	facing these problems
670.58	within their families
670.58	and within their families' communities,
673.7	but they're also meeting misunderstandings
678.46	and apathy in the countries
678.46	that they grow up in.
683.46	When their own families betray them,
683.46	they look to the rest of us,
688.18	and when we don't understand,
690.26	we lose them.
692.94	So while I was making this film,
692.94	several people said to me,
696.14	"""Well, Deeyah, you know,"
696.14	this is just their culture,
698.7	this is just what those people
698.7	do to their kids
700.915	"and we can't really interfere."""
703.7	I can assure you
703.7	being murdered is not my culture.
708.1	You know?
709.34	And surely people who look like me,
711.06	young women who come
711.06	from backgrounds like me,
713.58	should be subject to the same rights,
713.58	the same protections
717.7	as anybody else in our country, why not?
722.18	So, for my next film,
722.18	I wanted to try and understand
726.94	why some of our young
726.94	Muslim kids in Europe
729.82	are drawn to extremism and violence.
732.7	But with that topic,
733.98	I also recognized that I was going
733.98	to have to face my worst fear:
738.86	the brown men with beards.
742.7	The same men, or similar men,
745.54	to the ones that have hounded me
745.54	for most of my life.
749.38	Men that I've been afraid of
749.38	most of my life.
752.1	Men that I've also deeply disliked,
754.98	for many, many years.
756.98	So I spent the next two years
756.98	interviewing convicted terrorists,
760.98	jihadis and former extremists.
763.5	What I already knew,
763.5	what was very obvious already,
766.86	was that religion, politics,
766.86	Europe's colonial baggage,
772.06	also Western foreign policy
772.06	failures of recent years,
776.34	were all a part of the picture.
778.34	But what I was more interested
778.34	in finding out was what are the human,
781.62	what are the personal reasons
783.22	why some of our young people
783.22	are susceptible to groups like this.
788.82	And what really surprised me
788.82	was that I found wounded human beings.
795.58	Instead of the monsters
795.58	that I was looking for,
798.06	that I was hoping to find --
799.46	quite frankly because
799.46	it would have been very satisfying --
802.62	I found broken people.
805.34	Just like Banaz,
806.86	I found that these young men
806.86	were torn apart
810.14	from trying to bridge the gaps
812.7	between their families
812.7	and the countries that they were born in.
817.54	And what I also learned
817.54	is that extremist groups, terrorist groups
820.94	are taking advantage
820.94	of these feelings of our young people
824.42	and channeling that -- cynically --
824.42	channeling that toward violence.
828.3	"""Come to us,"" they say."
829.9	"""Reject both sides,"
829.9	your family and your country
832.9	because they reject you.
834.58	For your family, their honor
834.58	is more important than you
837.7	and for your country,
838.98	a real Norwegian, Brit or a French person
838.98	"will always be white and never you."""
845.86	They're also promising our young people
845.86	the things that they crave:
849.34	significance, heroism,
849.34	a sense of belonging and purpose,
853.7	a community that loves and accepts them.
857.02	They make the powerless feel powerful.
859.98	The invisible and the silent
859.98	are finally seen and heard.
866.94	This is what they're doing
866.94	for our young people.
869.5	Why are these groups doing this
869.5	for our young people and not us?
874.58	The thing is,
876.18	I'm not trying to justify
879.54	or excuse any of the violence.
883.3	What I am trying to say
883.3	is that we have to understand
886.9	why some of our young people
886.9	are attracted to this.
891.5	I would like to also show you, actually --
893.86	these are childhood photos
893.86	of some of the guys in the film.
899.06	What really struck me
899.06	is that so many of them --
902.78	I never would have thought this --
904.46	but so many of them
904.46	have absent or abusive fathers.
908.62	And several of these young guys
910.58	ended up finding caring
910.58	and compassionate father figures
914.74	within these extremist groups.
917.74	I also found men
917.74	brutalized by racist violence,
921.62	but who found a way
921.62	to stop feeling like victims
923.9	by becoming violent themselves.
925.42	In fact, I found something,
925.42	to my horror, that I recognized.
930.74	I found the same feelings that I felt
930.74	as a 17-year-old as I fled from Norway.
937.98	The same confusion, the same sorrow,
941.38	the same feeling of being betrayed
946.58	and not belonging to anyone.
950.38	The same feeling of being lost
950.38	and torn between cultures.
954.58	Having said that,
954.58	I did not choose destruction,
957.14	I chose to pick up a camera
957.14	instead of a gun.
959.9	And the reason I did that
959.9	is because of my superpower.
963.26	I could see that understanding
963.26	is the answer, instead of violence.
968.18	Seeing human beings
969.9	with all their virtues and all their flaws
973.66	instead of continuing the caricatures:
975.54	the us and them, the villains and victims.
978.22	I'd also finally
978.22	come to terms with the fact
980.34	that my two cultures
980.34	didn't have to be on a collision course
984.02	but instead became a space
984.02	where I found my own voice.
987.66	I stopped feeling
987.66	like I had to pick a side,
990.42	but this took me many, many years.
993.46	There are so many
993.46	of our young people today
995.5	who are struggling with these same issues,
997.54	and they're struggling with this alone.
1001.26	And this leaves them open like wounds.
1004.38	And for some, the worldview
1004.38	of radical Islam
1007.46	becomes the infection
1007.46	that festers in these open wounds.
1012.98	There's an African proverb that says,
1017.78	"""If the young are not"
1017.78	initiated into the village,
1020.82	they will burn it down
1020.82	"just to feel its warmth."""
1025.06	I would like to ask --
1027.46	to Muslim parents and Muslim communities,
1030.02	will you love and care for your children
1032.46	without forcing them
1032.46	to meet your expectations?
1035.26	Can you choose them instead of your honor?
1038.22	Can you understand
1038.22	why they're so angry and alienated
1041.26	when you put your honor
1041.26	before their happiness?
1044.34	Can you try to be a friend to your child
1046.939	so that they can trust you
1048.74	and want to share with you
1048.74	their experiences,
1051.06	rather than having
1051.06	to seek it somewhere else?
1054.179	And to our young people
1054.179	tempted by extremism,
1058.5	can you acknowledge
1058.5	that your rage is fueled by pain?
1063.46	Will you find the strength
1063.46	to resist those cynical old men
1066.9	who want to use your blood
1066.9	for their own profits?
1070.86	Can you find a way to live?
1073.7	Can you see that the sweetest revenge
1075.98	is for you to live
1075.98	a happy, full and free life?
1079.46	A life defined by you and nobody else.
1082.38	Why do you want to become
1082.38	just another dead Muslim kid?
1086.9	And for the rest of us, when will we start
1086.9	listening to our young people?
1092.34	How can we support them
1093.62	in redirecting their pain
1093.62	into something more constructive?
1098.58	They think we don't like them.
1100.06	They think we don't care
1100.06	what happens to them.
1102.86	They think we don't accept them.
1104.66	Can we find a way
1104.66	to make them feel differently?
1109.1	What will it take for us
1109.1	to see them and notice them
1112.06	before they become either the victims
1112.06	or the perpetrators of violence?
1117.02	Can we make ourselves care about them
1117.02	and consider them to be our own?
1120.62	And not just be outraged when the victims
1120.62	of violence look like ourselves?
1125.5	Can we find a way to reject hatred
1125.5	and heal the divisions between us?
1130.54	The thing is we cannot afford
1130.54	to give up on each other or on our kids,
1134.54	even if they've given up on us.
1136.7	We are all in this together.
1138.9	And in the long term, revenge and violence
1138.9	will not work against extremists.
1145.3	Terrorists want us
1145.3	to huddle in our houses in fear,
1149.1	closing our doors and our hearts.
1151.3	They want us to tear open
1151.3	more wounds in our societies
1155.14	so that they can use them
1155.14	to spread their infection more widely.
1158.7	They want us to become like them:
1161.42	intolerant, hateful and cruel.
1166.02	The day after the Paris attacks,
1168.5	a friend of mine
1168.5	sent this photo of her daughter.
1172.62	This is a white girl and an Arab girl.
1175.1	They're best friends.
1176.94	This image is the kryptonite
1176.94	for extremists.
1183.06	These two little girls
1183.06	with their superpowers
1186.14	are showing the way forward
1187.66	towards a society
1187.66	that we need to build together,
1191.94	a society that includes and supports,
1196.3	rather than rejects our kids.
1199.78	Thank you for listening.
1201.14	(Applause)
