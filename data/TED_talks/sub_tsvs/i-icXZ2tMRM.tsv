13.089	We humans have always been very concerned
13.089	about the health of our bodies,
17.069	but we haven't always been that good
17.069	at figuring out what's important.
21.285	Take the ancient Egyptians, for example:
23.677	very concerned about the body parts
23.677	they thought they'd need in the afterlife,
27.624	but they left some parts out.
29.714	This part, for example.
32.337	Although they very carefully 
32.337	preserved the stomach, the lungs,
35.334	the liver, and so forth,
36.499	they just mushed up the brain,
36.499	drained it out through the nose,
39.535	and threw it away,
41.259	which makes sense, really,
42.6	because what does a brain
42.6	do for us anyway?
45.439	But imagine if there were a kind
45.439	of neglected organ in our bodies
48.637	that weighed just as much as the brain
50.773	and in some ways was just
50.773	as important to who we are,
53.699	but we knew so little about
53.699	and treated with such disregard.
57.251	And imagine if,
57.251	through new scientific advances,
60.154	we were just beginning to understand
61.895	its importance to how
61.895	we think of ourselves.
64.797	Wouldn't you want to know more about it?
67.003	Well, it turns out that we do
67.003	have something just like that:
70.959	our gut,
72.641	or rather, its microbes.
75.303	But it's not just the microbes
75.303	in our gut that are important.
78.196	Microbes all over our body
79.704	turn out to be really critical
79.704	to a whole range of differences
82.617	that make different people who we are.
85.114	So for example, have you ever noticed
87.428	how some people get bitten by mosquitos
87.428	way more often than others?
91.611	It turns out that everyone's anecdotal
91.611	experience out camping is actually true.
96.19	For example, I seldom
96.19	get bitten by mosquitos,
98.999	but my partner Amanda
98.999	attracts them in droves,
101.276	and the reason why is that we have
101.276	different microbes on our skin
104.339	that produce different chemicals
104.339	that the mosquitos detect.
108.061	Now, microbes are also really important
108.061	in the field of medicine.
111.567	So, for example, what microbes
111.567	you have in your gut
114.032	determine whether particular painkillers
114.032	are toxic to your liver.
118.494	They also determine whether or not other
118.494	drugs will work for your heart condition.
122.739	And, if you're a fruit fly, at least,
125.426	your microbes determine
125.426	who you want to have sex with.
128.608	We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet
130.767	but maybe it's just a matter of time
130.767	before we find out. (Laughter)
135.063	So microbes are performing
135.063	a huge range of functions.
137.686	They help us digest our food.
139.452	They help educate our immune system.
141.726	They help us resist disease,
143.676	and they may even
143.676	be affecting our behavior.
146.184	So what would a map of all these
146.184	microbial communities look like?
150.131	Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this,
152.407	but it's a helpful guide
152.407	for understanding biodiversity.
155.286	Different parts of the world
155.286	have different landscapes of organisms
159.21	that are immediately characteristic
159.21	of one place or another
163.781	or another.
165.818	With microbiology, it's kind of the same,
165.818	although I've got to be honest with you:
169.683	All the microbes essentially
169.683	look the same under a microscope.
172.786	So instead of trying
172.786	to identify them visually,
175.315	what we do is we look
175.315	at their DNA sequences,
177.801	and in a project called
177.801	the Human Microbiome Project,
180.725	NIH funded this $173 million project
184.064	where hundreds 
184.064	of researchers came together
186.473	to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,
189.252	and all of these microbes
189.252	in the human body.
191.428	So when we take them together,
191.428	they look like this.
194.789	It's a bit more difficult
194.789	to tell who lives where now, isn't it?
198.72	What my lab does is develop
198.72	computational techniques that allow us
202.268	to take all these terabytes
202.268	of sequence data
204.879	and turn them into something
204.879	that's a bit more useful as a map,
207.892	and so when we do that
207.892	with the human microbiome data
210.645	from 250 healthy volunteers,
212.74	it looks like this.
215.384	Each point here represents
215.384	all the complex microbes
218.564	in an entire microbial community.
220.747	See, I told you they basically
220.747	all look the same.
223.077	So what we're looking at is each point
223.077	represents one microbial community
226.966	from one body site
226.966	of one healthy volunteer.
229.226	And so you can see that there's different
229.226	parts of the map in different colors,
233.022	almost like separate continents.
234.821	And what it turns out to be
236.279	is that those, as the different
236.279	regions of the body,
238.719	have very different microbes in them.
240.797	So what we have is we have
240.797	the oral community up there in green.
244.48	Over on the other side,
244.48	we have the skin community in blue,
247.294	the vaginal community in purple,
249.581	and then right down at the bottom,
249.581	we have the fecal community in brown.
253.416	And we've just over the last few years
255.299	found out that the microbes
255.299	in different parts of the body
258.098	are amazingly different from one another.
260.296	So if I look at just one person's microbes
263.128	in the mouth and in the gut,
265.242	it turns out that the difference between
265.242	those two microbial communities
268.702	is enormous.
270.233	It's bigger than the difference
270.233	between the microbes in this reef
273.398	and the microbes in this prairie.
276.131	So this is incredible
276.131	when you think about it.
278.662	What it means is that a few feet
278.662	of difference in the human body
282.028	makes more of a difference
282.028	to your microbial ecology
284.722	than hundreds of miles on Earth.
286.967	And this is not to say that two people 
286.967	look basically the same
289.987	in the same body habitat, either.
291.839	So you probably heard
293.445	that we're pretty much all the same
293.445	in terms of our human DNA.
296.453	You're 99.99 percent identical
296.453	in terms of your human DNA
300.542	to the person sitting next to you.
302.409	But that's not true of your gut microbes:
304.651	you might only share 10 percent similarity
307.138	with the person sitting next to you
307.138	in terms of your gut microbes.
310.648	So that's as different
310.648	as the bacteria on this prairie
313.444	and the bacteria in this forest.
316.46	So these different microbes
317.909	have all these different kinds 
317.909	of functions that I told you about,
321.076	everything from digesting food
322.772	to involvement
322.772	in different kinds of diseases,
325.327	metabolizing drugs, and so forth.
327.193	So how do they do all this stuff?
329.299	Well, in part it's because
331.195	although there's just three pounds
331.195	of those microbes in our gut,
334.525	they really outnumber us.
336.285	And so how much do they outnumber us?
338.505	Well, it depends on what
338.505	you think of as our bodies.
341.617	Is it our cells?
343.102	Well, each of us consists
343.102	of about 10 trillion human cells,
346.515	but we harbor as many
346.515	as 100 trillion microbial cells.
349.746	So they outnumber us 10 to one.
352.52	Now, you might think, well,
352.52	we're human because of our DNA,
356.431	but it turns out that each of us has
356.431	about 20,000 human genes,
359.752	depending on what you count exactly,
361.708	but as many as two million
361.708	to 20 million microbial genes.
366.2	So whichever way we look at it,
366.2	we're vastly outnumbered
368.959	by our microbial symbionts.
371.791	And it turns out that in addition 
371.791	to traces of our human DNA,
375.018	we also leave traces
375.018	of our microbial DNA
377.245	on everything we touch.
379.025	We showed in a study a few years ago
380.817	that you can actually match
380.817	the palm of someone's hand up
383.612	to the computer mouse
383.612	that they use routinely
385.889	with up to 95 percent accuracy.
388.186	So this came out in a scientific journal
388.186	a few years ago,
391.042	but more importantly,
391.042	"it was featured on ""CSI: Miami,"""
393.595	so you really know it's true.
395.382	(Laughter)
396.977	So where do our microbes
396.977	come from in the first place?
400.374	Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,
403.021	you probably have
403.021	some dark suspicions about that,
405.384	all of which are true, by the way.
407.363	So just like we can match
407.363	you to your computer equipment
410.121	by the microbes you share,
411.824	we can also match you up to your dog.
414.032	But it turns out that in adults,
416.139	microbial communities
416.139	are relatively stable,
418.438	so even if you live together with someone,
420.572	you'll maintain your separate
420.572	microbial identity
422.97	over a period of weeks,
422.97	months, even years.
425.984	It turns out that our
425.984	first microbial communities
428.875	depend a lot on how we're born.
431.025	So babies that come out
431.025	the regular way,
433.206	all of their microbes are basically
433.206	like the vaginal community,
436.266	whereas babies that are
436.266	delivered by C-section,
438.631	all of their microbes instead
438.631	look like skin.
441.537	And this might be associated
441.537	with some of the differences
444.574	in health associated with Cesarean birth,
447.362	such as more asthma, more allergies,
447.362	even more obesity,
450.578	all of which have been linked
450.578	to microbes now,
453.108	and when you think about it,
453.108	until recently, every surviving mammal
457.005	had been delivered by the birth canal,
459.561	and so the lack
459.561	of those protective microbes
461.837	that we've co-evolved with
461.837	might be really important
464.287	for a lot of these different conditions
464.287	that we now know involve the microbiome.
468.796	When my own daughter was born
468.796	a couple of years ago
471.533	by emergency C-section,
473.968	we took matters into our own hands
475.809	and made sure she was coated
475.809	with those vaginal microbes
478.489	that she would have gotten naturally.
480.529	Now, it's really difficult to tell
480.529	whether this has had an effect
483.913	on her health specifically, right?
485.915	With a sample size of just one child,
485.915	no matter how much we love her,
489.596	you don't really have
489.596	enough of a sample size
491.813	to figure out what happens on average,
493.759	but at two years old,
493.759	she hasn't had an ear infection yet,
496.656	so we're keeping our fingers
496.656	crossed on that one.
498.941	And what's more, we're starting
498.941	to do clinical trials with more children
502.398	to figure out whether
502.398	this has a protective effect generally.
507.031	So how we're born has a tremendous effect
507.031	on what microbes we have initially,
512.354	but where do we go after that?
514.271	What I'm showing you
514.271	again here is this map
516.541	of the Human Microbiome Project Data,
518.539	so each point represents
518.539	a sample from one body site
521.302	from one of 250 healthy adults.
523.842	And you've seen children
523.842	develop physically.
525.909	You've seen them develop mentally.
527.965	Now, for the first time,
527.965	you're going to see
530.04	one of my colleague's children
530.04	develop microbially.
533.398	So what we are going to look at
534.963	is we're going to look 
534.963	at this one baby's stool,
537.65	the fecal community,
537.65	which represents the gut,
540.099	sampled every week
540.099	for almost two and a half years.
543.268	And so we're starting on day one.
544.931	What's going to happen is that the infant
544.931	is going to start off as this yellow dot,
548.849	and you can see that he's starting off
548.849	basically in the vaginal community,
552.329	as we would expect from his delivery mode.
554.355	And what's going to happen
554.355	over these two and a half years
557.069	is that he's going to travel 
557.069	all the way down
559.211	to resemble the adult fecal community from
559.211	healthy volunteers down at the bottom.
563.025	So I'm just going to start this going
563.025	and we'll see how that happens.
566.913	What you can see, and remember
566.913	each step in this is just one week,
570.949	what you can see is that week to week,
572.815	the change in the microbial community
572.815	of the feces of this one child,
577.498	the differences week to week
577.498	are much greater
580.049	than the differences between
580.049	individual healthy adults
582.58	in the Human Microbiome Project cohort,
584.53	which are those brown dots
584.53	down at the bottom.
587.006	And you can see he's starting
587.006	to approach the adult fecal community.
590.203	This is up to about two years.
591.718	But something amazing
591.718	is about to happen here.
593.888	So he's getting antibiotics
593.888	for an ear infection.
596.976	What you can see is
596.976	this huge change in the community,
599.53	followed by a relatively rapid recovery.
601.588	I'll just rewind that for you.
605.34	And what we can see is that
605.34	just over these few weeks,
608.929	we have a much more radical change,
610.862	a setback of many months 
610.862	of normal development,
613.392	followed by a relatively rapid recovery,
615.644	and by the time he reaches day 838,
619.777	which is the end of this video,
621.496	you can see that he has essentially
621.496	reached the healthy adult stool community,
625.193	despite that antibiotic intervention.
627.641	So this is really interesting
627.641	because it raises fundamental questions
630.969	about what happens when we intervene
630.969	at different ages in a child's life.
635.068	So does what we do early on, where
635.068	the microbiome is changing so rapidly,
638.679	actually matter,
639.979	or is it like throwing a stone
639.979	into a stormy sea,
642.462	where the ripples will just be lost?
645.044	Well, fascinatingly, it turns out
645.044	that if you give children antibiotics
649.335	in the first six months of life,
650.985	they're more likely
650.985	to become obese later on
653.77	than if they don't get antibiotics then
653.77	or only get them later,
656.897	and so what we do early on
656.897	may have profound impacts
659.843	on the gut microbial community
659.843	and on later health
663.34	that we're only beginning to understand.
665.666	So this is fascinating, because one day,
665.666	in addition to the effects
669.822	that antibiotics have
669.822	on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
672.468	which are very important,
674.164	they may also be degrading
674.164	our gut microbial ecosystems,
677.067	and so one day we may come
677.067	to regard antibiotics with the same horror
680.339	that we currently reserve
680.339	for those metal tools
682.802	that the Egyptians used to use
682.802	to mush up the brains
685.261	before they drained them out
685.261	for embalming.
687.325	So I mentioned that microbes
687.325	have all these important functions,
690.346	and they've also now,
690.346	just over the past few years,
692.995	been connected to a whole range
692.995	of different diseases,
695.828	including inflammatory bowel disease,
697.913	heart disease, colon cancer,
699.637	and even obesity.
701.467	Obesity has a really 
701.467	large effect, as it turns out,
704.113	and today, we can tell
704.113	whether you're lean or obese
706.506	with 90 percent accuracy
708.385	by looking at the microbes in your gut.
710.497	Now, although that might sound impressive,
712.786	in some ways it's a little bit problematic
712.786	as a medical test,
716.117	because you can probably tell
716.117	which of these people is obese
719.114	without knowing anything
719.114	about their gut microbes,
721.866	but it turns out that even
721.866	if we sequence their complete genomes
724.909	and had all their human DNA,
726.566	we could only predict which one
726.566	was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.
730.932	So that's amazing, right?
732.306	What it means that the three pounds
732.306	of microbes that you carry around with you
736.118	may be more important
736.118	for some health conditions
738.46	than every single gene in your genome.
743.555	And then in mice, we can do a lot more.
745.792	So in mice, microbes have been linked
745.792	to all kinds of additional conditions,
749.437	including things like multiple sclerosis,
752.153	depression, autism, and again, obesity.
755.891	But how can we tell whether
755.891	these microbial differences
758.655	that correlate with disease
758.655	are cause or effect?
761.418	Well, one thing we can do
761.418	is we can raise some mice
764.065	without any microbes of their own
764.065	in a germ-free bubble.
766.712	Then we can add in some microbes
766.712	that we think are important,
769.665	and see what happens.
771.747	When we take the microbes
771.747	from an obese mouse
774.026	and transplant them
774.026	into a genetically normal mouse
776.53	that's been raised in a bubble
776.53	with no microbes of its own,
779.389	it becomes fatter than if it got them 
779.389	from a regular mouse.
784.142	Why this happens
784.142	is absolutely amazing, though.
786.461	Sometimes what's going on
786.461	is that the microbes
788.661	are helping them digest food
788.661	more efficiently from the same diet,
791.719	so they're taking more energy
791.719	from their food,
793.923	but other times, the microbes
793.923	are actually affecting their behavior.
797.154	What they're doing is they're eating
797.154	more than the normal mouse,
800.194	so they only get fat if we let them 
800.194	eat as much as they want.
804.614	So this is really remarkable, right?
807.3	The implication is that microbes
807.3	can affect mammalian behavior.
813.224	So you might be wondering whether we can 
813.224	also do this sort of thing across species,
817.382	and it turns out that if you take microbes
817.382	from an obese person
820.652	and transplant them into mice
820.652	you've raised germ-free,
823.715	those mice will also become fatter
825.805	than if they received the microbes
825.805	from a lean person,
828.846	but we can design a microbial community
828.846	that we inoculate them with
832.191	that prevents them
832.191	from gaining this weight.
835.545	We can also do this for malnutrition.
837.6	So in a project funded
837.6	by the Gates Foundation,
840.688	what we're looking at
840.688	is children in Malawi
842.871	who have kwashiorkor,
842.871	a profound form of malnutrition,
845.529	and mice that get the kwashiorkor
845.529	community transplanted into them
848.652	lose 30 percent of their body mass
851.022	in just three weeks,
852.201	but we can restore their health by using 
852.201	the same peanut butter-based supplement
856.019	that is used for 
856.019	the children in the clinic,
858.132	and the mice that receive the community
859.988	from the healthy identical twins
859.988	of the kwashiorkor children do fine.
864.035	This is truly amazing because it suggests
864.035	that we can pilot therapies
867.976	by trying them out
867.976	in a whole bunch of different mice
870.483	with individual people's gut communities
872.413	and perhaps tailor those therapies
872.413	all the way down to the individual level.
878.262	So I think it's really important
878.262	that everyone has a chance
881.177	to participate in this discovery.
883.883	So, a couple of years ago,
885.131	we started this project
885.131	called American Gut,
887.202	which allows you to claim a place 
887.202	for yourself on this microbial map.
891.406	This is now the largest crowd-funded
891.406	science project that we know of --
894.763	over 8,000 people
894.763	have signed up at this point.
897.651	What happens is,
897.651	they send in their samples,
900.229	we sequence the DNA of their microbes
900.229	and then release the results back to them.
904.014	We also release them, de-identified,
904.014	to scientists, to educators,
907.705	to interested members
907.705	of the general public, and so forth,
910.724	so anyone can have access to the data.
913.879	On the other hand,
915.05	when we do tours of our lab
915.05	at the BioFrontiers Institute,
918.332	and we explain that we use robots
918.332	and lasers to look at poop,
921.892	it turns out that not
921.892	everyone wants to know.
925.004	(Laughter)
926.286	But I'm guessing that many of you do,
928.207	and so I brought some kits here
928.207	if you're interested
930.866	in trying this out for yourself.
935.046	So why might we want to do this?
936.993	Well, it turns out that microbes
936.993	are not just important
939.563	for finding out where we are
939.563	in terms of our health,
942.464	but they can actually cure disease.
944.872	This is one of the newest things
944.872	we've been able to visualize
947.797	with colleagues 
947.797	at the University of Minnesota.
950.536	So here's that map
950.536	of the human microbiome again.
953.153	What we're looking at now --
954.61	I'm going to add in the community
954.61	of some people with C. diff.
957.98	So, this is a terrible form of diarrhea
960.259	where you have to go
960.259	up to 20 times a day,
962.604	and these people have failed
962.604	antibiotic therapy for two years
965.715	before they're eligible for this trial.
968.014	So what would happen if we transplanted
968.014	some of the stool from a healthy donor,
972.427	that star down at the bottom,
974.284	into these patients.
975.7	Would the good microbes
975.7	do battle with the bad microbes
978.309	and help to restore their health?
980.388	So let's watch exactly what happens there.
982.704	Four of those patients
982.704	are about to get a transplant
985.22	from that healthy donor at the bottom,
987.124	and what you can see is that immediately,
989.081	you have this radical change
989.081	in the gut community.
991.486	So one day after you do that transplant,
993.555	all those symptoms clear up,
995.204	the diarrhea vanishes,
996.759	and they're essentially healthy again,
996.759	coming to resemble the donor's community,
1000.531	and they stay there.
1002.593	(Applause)
1009.29	So we're just at the beginning
1009.29	of this discovery.
1011.665	We're just finding out that microbes
1011.665	have implications
1014.205	for all these different kinds of diseases,
1016.378	ranging from inflammatory 
1016.378	bowel disease to obesity,
1018.846	and perhaps even autism and depression.
1021.929	What we need to do, though,
1023.267	is we need to develop
1023.267	a kind of microbial GPS,
1025.525	where we don't just know
1025.525	where we are currently
1027.846	but also where we want to go
1027.846	and what we need to do
1031.397	in order to get there,
1032.883	and we need to be able
1032.883	to make this simple enough
1035.228	that even a child can use it.
1035.228	(Laughter)
1037.829	Thank you.
1040.058	(Applause)
