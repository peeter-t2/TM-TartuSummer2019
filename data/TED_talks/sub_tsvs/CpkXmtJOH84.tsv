12.368	We have a global health challenge
14.505	in our hands today,
16.197	and that is that the way we currently
19.257	discover and develop new drugs
22.182	is too costly, takes far too long,
26.36	and it fails more often than it succeeds.
30.074	It really just isn't working, and that means
33.451	that patients that badly need new therapies
36.498	are not getting them,
38.209	and diseases are going untreated.
41.707	We seem to be spending more and more money.
44.79	So for every billion dollars we spend in R&amp;D,
48.886	we're getting less drugs approved into the market.
52.715	More money, less drugs. Hmm.
55.932	So what's going on here?
57.852	Well, there's a multitude of factors at play,
60.447	but I think one of the key factors
62.468	is that the tools that we currently have
64.865	available to test whether a drug is going to work,
68.948	whether it has efficacy,
70.337	or whether it's going to be safe
72.103	before we get it into human clinical trials,
75.655	are failing us. They're not predicting
77.806	what's going to happen in humans.
81.034	And we have two main tools available
83.757	at our disposal.
85.771	They are cells in dishes and animal testing.
89.812	Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.
93.132	So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.
96.285	We take them and rip them out
98.34	of their native environment,
98.34	throw them in one of these dishes,
101.289	and expect them to work.
102.874	Guess what. They don't.
105.067	They don't like that environment
106.729	because it's nothing like
108.361	what they have in the body.
111.037	What about animal testing?
113.108	Well, animals do and can provide
115.993	extremely useful information.
118.255	They teach us about what happens
119.964	in the complex organism.
122.293	We learn more about the biology itself.
125.301	However, more often than not,
128.199	animal models fail to predict
128.199	what will happen in humans
132.415	when they're treated with a particular drug.
135.601	So we need better tools.
137.98	We need human cells,
139.733	but we need to find a way to keep them happy
142.483	outside the body.
144.074	Our bodies are dynamic environments.
146.98	We're in constant motion.
148.82	Our cells experience that.
151.011	They're in dynamic environments in our body.
153.82	They're under constant mechanical forces.
156.575	So if we want to make cells happy
159.031	outside our bodies,
160.46	we need to become cell architects.
162.986	We need to design, build and engineer
167.33	a home away from home for the cells.
170.561	And at the Wyss Institute,
172.235	we've done just that.
174.173	We call it an organ-on-a-chip.
177.197	And I have one right here.
178.988	It's beautiful, isn't it?
178.988	But it's pretty incredible.
181.803	Right here in my hand is a breathing, living
186.303	human lung on a chip.
188.961	And it's not just beautiful.
191.089	It can do a tremendous amount of things.
193.529	We have living cells in that little chip,
197.308	cells that are in a dynamic environment
199.858	interacting with different cell types.
202.939	There's been many people
204.578	trying to grow cells in the lab.
206.439	They've tried many different approaches.
209.595	They've even tried to grow
209.595	little mini-organs in the lab.
212.222	We're not trying to do that here.
213.771	We're simply trying to recreate
215.897	in this tiny chip
217.474	the smallest functional unit
220.491	that represents the biochemistry,
223.045	the function and the mechanical strain
226.169	that the cells experience in our bodies.
229.685	So how does it work? Let me show you.
232.717	We use techniques from the computer chip
235.351	manufacturing industry
236.984	to make these structures at a scale
239.181	relevant to both the cells and their environment.
242.077	We have three fluidic channels.
244.141	In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane
247.853	on which we can add human cells
249.916	from, say, our lungs,
251.26	and then underneath, they had capillary cells,
253.747	the cells in our blood vessels.
255.535	And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip
259.855	that stretch and contract the membrane,
262.684	so the cells experience the same mechanical forces
265.781	that they did when we breathe.
268.714	And they experience them how they did in the body.
271.874	There's air flowing through the top channel,
274.274	and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients
277.623	through the blood channel.
280.462	Now the chip is really beautiful,
282.834	but what can we do with it?
284.931	We can get incredible functionality
287.255	inside these little chips.
289.006	Let me show you.
290.512	We could, for example, mimic infection,
293.143	where we add bacterial cells into the lung.
296.679	then we can add human white blood cells.
299.611	White blood cells are our body's defense
302.202	against bacterial invaders,
303.57	and when they sense this
303.57	inflammation due to infection,
306.739	they will enter from the blood into the lung
309.596	and engulf the bacteria.
311.511	Well now you're going to see this happening
313.759	live in an actual human lung on a chip.
317.069	We've labeled the white blood cells
317.069	so you can see them flowing through,
320.612	and when they detect that infection,
322.773	they begin to stick.
324.17	They stick, and then they try to go into the lung
328.057	side from blood channel.
329.838	And you can see here, we can actually visualize
333.527	a single white blood cell.
337.286	It sticks, it wiggles its way through
339.542	between the cell layers, through the pore,
341.857	comes out on the other side of the membrane,
344.278	and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria
347.713	labeled in green.
349.362	In that tiny chip, you just witnessed
352.366	one of the most fundamental responses
355.547	our body has to an infection.
357.504	It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.
361.274	It's pretty exciting.
363.675	Now I want to share this picture with you,
366.018	not just because it's so beautiful,
368.656	but because it tells us an enormous
368.656	amount of information
371.992	about what the cells are doing within the chips.
374.589	It tells us that these cells
376.848	from the small airways in our lungs,
379.159	actually have these hairlike structures
380.91	that you would expect to see in the lung.
382.918	These structures are called cilia,
384.383	and they actually move the mucus out of the lung.
387.293	Yeah. Mucus. Yuck.
388.832	But mucus is actually very important.
391.272	Mucus traps particulates, viruses,
393.853	potential allergens,
395.312	and these little cilia move
396.913	and clear the mucus out.
399.163	When they get damaged, say,
401.075	by cigarette smoke for example,
403.494	they don't work properly,
403.494	and they can't clear that mucus out.
406.302	And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.
410.119	Cilia and the clearance of mucus
412.766	are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.
417.227	But now, with the functionality
417.227	that we get in these chips,
420.777	we can begin to look
422.601	for potential new treatments.
425.114	We didn't stop with the lung on a chip.
427.066	We have a gut on a chip.
428.95	You can see one right here.
430.98	And we've put intestinal human cells
434.206	in a gut on a chip,
436.111	and they're under constant peristaltic motion,
438.948	this trickling flow through the cells,
442.139	and we can mimic many of the functions
444.697	that you actually would expect to see
446.96	in the human intestine.
448.653	Now we can begin to create models of diseases
452.444	such as irritable bowel syndrome.
454.854	This is a disease that affects
456.936	a large number of individuals.
458.847	It's really debilitating,
460.621	and there aren't really many good treatments for it.
464.563	Now we have a whole pipeline
466.865	of different organ chips
469.144	that we are currently working on in our labs.
472.876	Now, the true power of this technology, however,
476.295	really comes from the fact
478.42	that we can fluidically link them.
480.965	There's fluid flowing across these cells,
482.912	so we can begin to interconnect
484.991	multiple different chips together
487.853	to form what we call a virtual human on a chip.
492.066	Now we're really getting excited.
495.075	We're not going to ever recreate 
495.075	a whole human in these chips,
499.17	but what our goal is is to be able to recreate
503.339	sufficient functionality
505.352	so that we can make better predictions
507.712	of what's going to happen in humans.
509.926	For example, now we can begin to explore
512.85	what happens when we put
512.85	a drug like an aerosol drug.
516.284	Those of you like me who have asthma,
516.284	when you take your inhaler,
519.27	we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,
522.196	how it enters the body,
523.822	how it might affect, say, your heart.
525.576	Does it change the beating of your heart?
527.484	Does it have a toxicity?
529.125	Does it get cleared by the liver?
531.133	Is it metabolized in the liver?
533.285	Is it excreted in your kidneys?
535.176	We can begin to study the dynamic
537.388	response of the body to a drug.
540.028	This could really revolutionize
541.947	and be a game changer
543.596	for not only the pharmaceutical industry,
546.534	but a whole host of different industries,
548.907	including the cosmetics industry.
551.307	We can potentially use the skin on a chip
554.189	that we're currently developing in the lab
556.15	to test whether the ingredients in those products
558.704	that you're using are actually 
558.704	safe to put on your skin
561.987	without the need for animal testing.
564.676	We could test the safety
566.62	of chemicals that we are exposed to
568.873	on a daily basis in our environment,
570.787	such as chemicals in regular household cleaners.
574.518	We could also use the organs on chips
577.72	for applications in bioterrorism
580.499	or radiation exposure.
583.07	We could use them to learn more about
586.42	diseases such as ebola
589.464	or other deadly diseases such as SARS.
593.356	Organs on chips could also change
595.194	the way we do clinical trials in the future.
598.568	Right now, the average participant
601.155	in a clinical trial is that: average.
604.525	Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female.
607.851	You won't find many clinical trials
610.323	in which children are involved,
611.838	yet every day, we give children medications,
615.385	and the only safety data we have on that drug
619.131	is one that we obtained from adults.
622.205	Children are not adults.
623.999	They may not respond in the same way adults do.
627.132	There are other things like genetic differences
629.544	in populations
630.977	that may lead to at-risk populations
634.083	that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.
637.52	Now imagine if we could take cells
637.52	from all those different populations,
640.919	put them on chips,
642.827	and create populations on a chip.
644.791	This could really change the way
646.629	we do clinical trials.
648.698	And this is the team and the people
648.698	that are doing this.
651.53	We have engineers, we have cell biologists,
654.787	we have clinicians, all working together.
658.561	We're really seeing something quite incredible
660.487	at the Wyss Institute.
662.092	It's really a convergence of disciplines,
664.263	where biology is influencing the way we design,
667.983	the way we engineer, the way we build.
670.645	It's pretty exciting.
672.048	We're establishing important industry collaborations
675.612	such as the one we have with a company
678.985	that has expertise in large-scale
678.985	digital manufacturing.
682.584	They're going to help us make,
684.603	instead of one of these,
686.129	millions of these chips,
687.712	so that we can get them into the hands
689.381	of as many researchers as possible.
692.27	And this is key to the potential of that technology.
696.486	Now let me show you our instrument.
699.023	This is an instrument that our engineers
701.012	are actually prototyping right now in the lab,
703.63	and this instrument is going to give us
705.939	the engineering controls that we're going to require
708.398	in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.
712.566	It does something else that's very important.
714.795	It creates an easy user interface.
717.639	So a cell biologist like me can come in,
720.629	take a chip, put it in a cartridge
722.637	like the prototype you see there,
724.569	put the cartridge into the machine
726.64	just like you would a C.D.,
728.128	and away you go.
729.26	Plug and play. Easy.
732.009	Now, let's imagine a little bit
734.523	what the future might look like
735.902	if I could take your stem cells
738.315	and put them on a chip,
739.755	or your stem cells and put them on a chip.
742.974	It would be a personalized chip just for you.
746.475	Now all of us in here are individuals,
749.683	and those individual differences mean
752.521	that we could react very differently
754.963	and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.
759.21	I myself, a couple of years back,
759.21	had a really bad headache,
763.778	just couldn't shake it, thought, 
763.778	"""Well, I'll try something different."""
766.191	I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,
768.326	I was on my way to the emergency room
770.206	with a full-blown asthma attack.
772.099	Now, obviously it wasn't fatal,
773.929	but unfortunately, some of these
777.102	adverse drug reactions can be fatal.
780.711	So how do we prevent them?
782.652	Well, we could imagine one day
785.232	having Geraldine on a chip,
787.575	having Danielle on a chip,
789.324	having you on a chip.
790.797	Personalized medicine. Thank you.
793.185	(Applause)
