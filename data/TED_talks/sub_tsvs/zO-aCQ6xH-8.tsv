136.044	(Whistling ends)
139.42	(Applause)
142.763	Thank you.
144.26	(Applause)
146.86	Thank you very much.
148.994	That was whistling.
150.357	I'm trying to do this in English.
154.26	What is a chubby,
154.26	curly-haired guy from Holland --
159.491	why is he whistling?
161.033	Well actually, I've been whistling
161.033	since the age of four, about four.
164.488	My dad was always whistling
164.488	around the house,
166.678	and I just thought that's part
166.678	of communication in my family.
169.769	So I whistled along with him.
171.492	And actually, until I was 34,
174.979	I always annoyed and irritated
174.979	people with whistling,
179.543	because, to be honest,
181.26	my whistling is a kind
181.26	of deviant behavior.
185.569	I whistled alone,
185.569	I whistled in the classroom,
188.858	I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.
191.568	And I also whistled
191.568	at a Christmas Eve party
194.972	with my family-in-law.
196.717	And they had some, in my opinion,
196.717	terrible Christmas music.
201.423	And when I hear music that I don't like,
201.423	I try to make it better.
205.185	(Laughter)
206.591	"So when ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed"
206.591	"Reindeer"" -- you know it?"
210.095	(Whistling)
213.025	But it can also sound like this.
214.751	(Whistling)
217.898	But during a Christmas party --
220.88	at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying.
223.117	So my sister-in-law asked me a few times,
223.117	"""Please stop whistling."""
227.6	And I just couldn't.
228.912	And at one point --
230.137	and I had some wine,
230.137	I have to admit that --
232.373	at one point I said,
232.373	"""If there was a contest, I would join."""
235.672	And two weeks later,
237.138	I received a text message:
237.138	"""You're going to America."""
240.57	(Laughter)
242.48	So, OK, I'm going to America.
245.332	I would love to, but why?
246.96	So I immediately called her up, of course.
249.141	She googled, and she found
249.141	this World Whistling Championship
253.747	in America, of course.
255.548	(Laughter)
257.878	She didn't expect me to go there.
260.26	And I would have lost my face.
263.423	I don't know if that's correct English.
265.433	But the Dutch people here
265.433	will understand what I mean.
267.983	(Laughter)
270.466	I lost my face.
272.26	(Applause)
275.26	"And she thought, ""He will never go there."""
277.876	But actually, I did.
279.486	So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina,
279.486	southeast of the United States,
285.055	and I entered the world of whistling.
288.07	And I also entered the World Championship,
290.604	and I won there, in 2004.
293.26	(Applause)
297.196	That was great fun, of course.
301.581	And to defend my title --
301.581	like judokas do and sportsmen --
307.101	I thought, well let's go back in 2005 --
309.466	and I won again.
310.649	(Laughter)
312.188	Then I couldn't participate
312.188	for a few years.
314.309	And in 2008, I entered again
314.309	in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.
318.875	So what happened now
321.26	is I'm standing here in Rotterdam,
321.26	in the beautiful city, on a big stage,
325.1	and I'm talking about whistling.
327.034	And actually, I earn my money
327.034	whistling, at the moment.
330.537	So I quit my day job as a nurse.
333.26	(Applause)
338.26	And I try to live my dream --
340.26	well, actually, it was never my dream,
340.26	but it sounds so good.
343.429	(Laughter)
345.26	OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.
347.577	"You say, ""Huh, what do you mean?"""
349.726	Well actually, you are going
349.726	to whistle along.
355.736	And then always the same thing happens:
358.198	people are watching each other
358.198	"and think, ""Oh, my God."
360.996	"Why? Can I go away?"""
363.174	No, you can't.
364.607	(Laughter)
367.106	Actually, it's very simple.
368.478	The track that I will whistle
368.478	"is called ""FÃªte de la Belle."""
372.414	It's about 80 minutes long.
374.255	(Laughter)
375.684	No, no, no. It's four minutes long.
378.26	And I want to first rehearse
378.26	with you your whistling.
382.427	Yes, so I whistle the tone.
384.203	(Whistling)
386.26	(Laughter)
388.608	Sorry, I forgot one thing --
391.423	you whistle the same tone as me.
394.016	(Laughter)
395.889	I heard a wide variety of tones.
402.05	(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)
415.359	(Whistling ends)
416.589	This is very promising.
417.972	(Laughter)
419.183	This is very promising.
420.548	I'll ask the technicians
420.548	to start the music.
423.26	And if it's started,
423.26	I just point where you whistle along,
426.522	and we will see what happens.
428.119	(Laughter)
433.883	Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians.
437.93	(Laughter)
442.183	I'm so used to that.
443.405	(Laughter)
444.453	I start it myself.
445.802	(Laughter)
446.987	OK, here it is.
448.26	(Laughter)
451.633	(Music)
453.603	(Whistling)
464.368	(Whistling ends)
465.543	(Music)
469.582	OK.
471.686	(Whistling)
519.079	It's easy, isn't it?
521.26	(Whistling)
555.609	Now comes the solo,
555.609	I propose I do that myself, OK?
558.633	(Music)
561.26	(Whistling)
694.26	(Applause)
705.26	Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou,
705.26	the World Champion of Whistling.
709.013	Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.
