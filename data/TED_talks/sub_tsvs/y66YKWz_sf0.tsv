16.521	Five years ago, I experienced a bit
19.043	of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.
22.379	Penn State asked me, a communications teacher,
25.042	to teach a communications class for engineering students.
28.382	And I was scared. (Laughter)
30.988	Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains
34.659	and their big books and their big, unfamiliar words.
38.366	But as these conversations unfolded,
41.571	I experienced what Alice must have when she went down
44.479	that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.
48.656	That's just how I felt as I had those conversations
51.267	with the students. I was amazed at the ideas
54.016	that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.
58.982	And I believe the key to opening that door
61.613	is great communication.
62.903	We desperately need great communication from our
65.787	scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
68.846	Our scientists and engineers are the ones
71.736	that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy
74.902	to environment to health care, among others,
77.907	and if we don't know about it and understand it,
81.069	then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility
84.077	as non-scientists to have these interactions.
87.028	But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists
90.188	and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.
93.422	So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.
98.901	I want to share a few keys on how you can do that
101.388	to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy
105.463	and that your engineering is engaging.
108.063	First question to answer for us: so what?
111.796	Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
115.751	Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,
118.381	but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones
122.278	because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
126.891	And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.
131.397	Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.
135.273	"Sure, you can say ""spatial and temporal,"" but why not just say"
138.349	"""space and time,"" which is so much more accessible to us?"
141.775	And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.
146.923	Instead, as Einstein said, make everything
149.7	as simple as possible, but no simpler.
153.134	You can clearly communicate your science
155.907	without compromising the ideas.
158.594	A few things to consider are having examples, stories
162.539	and analogies. Those are ways to engage
164.244	and excite us about your content.
166.426	And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.
172.739	Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points? (Laughter)
176.592	What do bullets do? Bullets kill,
178.96	and they will kill your presentation.
181.272	A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much
185.451	on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
189.178	Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is
193.082	much more effective. It's showing that the special structure
195.964	of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired
199.628	the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
202.483	And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence
206.163	that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,
209.215	and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses
212.493	and create a deeper sense of understanding
214.907	of what's being described.
216.546	So I think these are just a few keys that can help
219.396	the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland
222.918	that is science and engineering.
225.134	And because the engineers that I've worked with have
227.583	taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,
231.383	I want to summarize with an equation. (Laughter)
234.336	Take your science, subtract your bullet points
238.581	and your jargon, divide by relevance,
241.359	meaning share what's relevant to the audience,
243.806	and multiply it by the passion that you have for
246.597	this incredible work that you're doing,
248.82	and that is going to equal incredible interactions
251.598	that are full of understanding.
254.072	And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved
257.534	this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me. (Laughter)
262.63	Thank you. (Applause)
