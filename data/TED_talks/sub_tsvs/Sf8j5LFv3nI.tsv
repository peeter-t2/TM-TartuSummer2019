12.46	Twenty years ago,
13.94	when I was a barrister
13.94	and human rights lawyer
16.9	in full-time legal practice in London,
19.9	and the highest court in the land
22.1	still convened, some would say
22.1	by an accident of history,
26.54	in this building here,
28.66	I met a young man
28.66	who had just quit his job
31.74	in the British Foreign Office.
33.74	"When I asked him, ""Why did you leave,"""
36.06	he told me this story.
38.34	He had gone to his boss
38.34	one morning and said,
41.06	"""Let's do something"
41.06	"about human rights abuses in China."""
46.02	And his boss had replied,
48.02	"""We can't do anything"
48.02	about human rights abuses in China
50.74	because we have
50.74	"trade relations with China."""
54.5	So my friend went away
54.5	with his tail between his legs,
57.1	and six months later,
57.1	he returned again to his boss,
61.06	and he said this time,
62.7	"""Let's do something"
62.7	"about human rights in Burma,"""
66.22	as it was then called.
68.22	His boss once again paused
70.38	"and said, ""Oh, but we can't"
70.38	do anything about human rights in Burma
74.42	because we don't have
74.42	"any trade relations with Burma."""
78.1	(Laughter)
79.78	This was the moment
79.78	he knew he had to leave.
81.9	It wasn't just the hypocrisy
81.9	that got to him.
84.98	It was the unwillingness of his government
88.26	to engage in conflict
88.26	with other governments,
90.9	in tense discussions,
92.7	all the while, innocent people
92.7	were being harmed.
97.42	We are constantly told
99.98	that conflict is bad
102.74	that compromise is good;
105.46	that conflict is bad
107.14	but consensus is good;
109.94	that conflict is bad
112.18	and collaboration is good.
115.86	But in my view,
117.18	that's far too simple
117.18	a vision of the world.
119.58	We cannot know
121.5	whether conflict is bad
123.58	unless we know who is fighting,
126.42	why they are fighting
128.58	and how they are fighting.
130.46	And compromises can be thoroughly rotten
133.94	if they harm people
133.94	who are not at the table,
137.42	people who are vulnerable, disempowered,
139.859	people whom we have
139.859	an obligation to protect.
144.3	Now, you might be
144.3	somewhat skeptical of a lawyer
147.38	arguing about the benefits of conflict
150.58	and creating problems for compromise,
153.22	but I did also qualify as a mediator,
155.06	and these days, I spend my time
155.06	giving talks about ethics for free.
158.98	So as my bank manager likes to remind me,
158.98	I'm downwardly mobile.
164.1	But if you accept my argument,
167.14	it should change not just the way
167.14	we lead our personal lives,
170.34	which I wish to put
170.34	to one side for the moment,
173.42	but it will change the way
173.42	we think about major problems
177.22	of public health and the environment.
181.26	Let me explain.
184.18	Every middle schooler
184.18	in the United States,
186.58	my 12-year-old daughter included,
189.26	learns that there are
189.26	three branches of government,
193.14	the legislative, the executive
193.14	and the judicial branch.
197.66	James Madison wrote,
199.1	"""If there is any principle"
199.1	more sacred in our Constitution,
204.14	and indeed in any free constitution,
206.9	than any other,
208.42	it is that which separates
210.94	the legislative, the executive
210.94	"and the judicial powers."""
215.9	Now, the framers were not just concerned
219.18	about the concentration
219.18	and exercise of power.
223.3	They also understood
223.3	the perils of influence.
228.26	Judges cannot determine
228.26	the constitutionality of laws
233.38	if they participate in making those laws,
237.18	nor can they hold the other branches
237.18	of government accountable
241.14	if they collaborate with them
243.1	or enter into close
243.1	relationships with them.
247.3	The Constitution is,
247.3	as one famous scholar put it,
251.22	"""an invitation to struggle."""
254.06	And we the people are served
256.86	when those branches do, indeed,
256.86	struggle with each other.
263.1	Now, we recognize
263.1	the importance of struggle
266.7	not just in the public sector
269.62	between our branches of government.
272.02	We also know it too in the private sector,
275.38	in relationships among corporations.
279.18	Let's imagine that two American airlines
279.18	get together and agree
284.22	that they will not drop the price
286.42	of their economy class airfares
286.42	below 250 dollars a ticket.
291.42	That is collaboration,
291.42	some would say collusion,
295.3	not competition,
296.66	and we the people are harmed
299.5	because we pay more for our tickets.
302.66	Imagine similarly
302.66	two airlines were to say,
304.94	"""Look, Airline A, we'll take"
304.94	"the route from LA to Chicago,"""
309.98	"and Airline B says, ""We'll take"
309.98	the route from Chicago to DC,
313.18	"and we won't compete."""
314.66	Once again, that's collaboration
314.66	or collusion instead of competition,
319.3	and we the people are harmed.
323.7	So we understand
323.7	the importance of struggle
329.18	when it comes to relationships
329.18	between branches of government,
334.9	the public sector.
336.62	We also understand
336.62	the importance of conflict
340.06	when it comes to relationships
340.06	among corporations,
344.42	the private sector.
346.1	But where we have forgotten it
348.7	is in the relationships
348.7	between the public and the private.
353.14	And governments all over the world
353.14	are collaborating with industry
356.86	to solve problems of public health
356.86	and the environment,
360.66	often collaborating
360.66	with the very corporations
363.66	that are creating or exacerbating
363.66	the problems they are trying to solve.
370.9	We are told that these relationships
374.5	are a win-win.
377.18	But what if someone is losing out?
382.1	Let me give you some examples.
385.66	A United Nations agency
385.66	decided to address a serious problem:
389.18	poor sanitation in schools in rural India.
394.02	They did so not just in collaboration
394.02	with national and local governments
398.1	but also with a television company
400.62	and with a major
400.62	multinational soda company.
405.46	In exchange for less
405.46	than one million dollars,
408.62	that corporation received the benefits
408.62	of a months-long promotional campaign
413.02	including a 12-hour telethon
415.22	all using the company's logo
415.22	and color scheme.
419.86	This was an arrangement
421.98	which was totally understandable
424.86	from the corporation's point of view.
426.82	It enhances the reputation of the company
429.38	and it creates brand loyalty
429.38	for its products.
433.18	But in my view,
434.82	this is profoundly problematic
434.82	for the intergovernmental agency,
438.54	an agency that has a mission
438.54	to promote sustainable living.
443.7	By increasing consumption
443.7	of sugar-sweetened beverages
446.86	made from scarce local water supplies
446.86	and drunk out of plastic bottles
451.18	in a country that is already
451.18	grappling with obesity,
454.22	this is neither sustainable
454.22	from a public health
457.66	nor an environmental point of view.
460.58	And in order to solve
460.58	one public health problem,
463.94	the agency is sowing the seeds
466.26	of another.
469.3	This is just one example
469.3	of dozens I discovered
473.62	in researching a book on the relationships
473.62	between government and industry.
478.74	I could also have told you
478.74	about the initiatives in parks
482.54	in London and throughout Britain,
484.18	involving the same company,
484.18	promoting exercise,
487.38	or indeed of the British government
487.38	creating voluntary pledges
492.26	in partnership with industry
494.46	instead of regulating industry.
497.22	These collaborations or partnerships
497.22	have become the paradigm in public health,
502.9	and once again, they make sense
502.9	from the point of view of industry.
506.98	It allows them to frame
506.98	public health problems and their solutions
510.62	in ways that are least threatening to,
512.78	most consonant with
512.78	their commercial interests.
515.66	So obesity becomes a problem
518.26	of individual decision-making,
522.54	of personal behavior,
524.619	personal responsibility
524.619	and lack of physical activity.
527.82	It is not a problem,
529.94	when framed this way,
531.379	of a multinational food system
531.379	involving major corporations.
535.02	And again, I don't blame industry.
536.7	Industry naturally engages
536.7	in strategies of influence
540.14	to promote its commercial interests.
543.38	But governments have a responsibility
546.66	to develop counterstrategies
548.74	to protect us
550.58	and the common good.
553.98	The mistake that governments are making
558.3	when they collaborate in this way
560.9	with industry
562.26	is that they conflate
564.86	the common good
566.7	with common ground.
568.9	When you collaborate with industry,
571.7	you necessarily put off the table
574.54	things that might promote the common good
574.54	to which industry will not agree.
578.14	Industry will not agree
578.14	to increased regulation
580.94	unless it believes this will
580.94	stave off even more regulation
585.14	or perhaps knock some competitors
585.14	out of the market.
589.78	Nor can companies agree
589.78	to do certain things,
592.1	for example raise the prices
592.1	of their unhealthy products,
595.1	because that would violate
595.1	competition law,
597.26	as we've established.
600.38	So our governments should not confound
603.62	the common good and common ground,
606.1	especially when common ground
606.1	means reaching agreement with industry.
612.34	I want to give you another example,
614.06	moving from high-profile collaboration
616.22	to something that is below ground
618.74	both literally and figuratively:
622.02	the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.
625.14	Imagine that you purchase a plot of land
628.86	not knowing the mineral rights
628.86	have been sold.
631.1	This is before the fracking boom.
634.18	You build your dream home on that plot,
637.22	and shortly afterwards,
638.86	you discover that a gas company
638.86	is building a well pad on your land.
644.86	That was the plight
644.86	of the Hallowich family.
649.02	Within a very short period of time,
651.86	they began to complain of headaches,
655.1	of sore throats, of itchy eyes,
658.34	in addition to the interference
658.34	of the noise, vibration
661.18	and the bright lights
661.18	from the flaring of natural gas.
664.34	They were very vocal in their criticisms,
667.78	and then they fell silent.
670.22	And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
670.22	where this image appeared,
673.5	and one other newspaper,
673.5	we discovered why they fell silent.
676.38	The newspapers went to the court and said,
676.38	"""What happened to the Hallowiches?"""
680.1	And it turned out the Hallowiches
680.1	had made a secret settlement
683.5	with the gas operators, and it was
683.5	a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.
687.42	The gas company said,
688.7	you can have a six-figure sum
691.14	to move elsewhere
691.14	and start your lives again,
693.3	but in return
694.54	you must promise not to speak
694.54	of your experience with our company,
698.42	not to speak of your
698.42	experience with fracking,
701.02	not to speak about the health consequences
705.5	that might have been revealed
705.5	by a medical examination.
709.54	Now, I do not blame
709.54	the Hallowiches for accepting
712.38	a take-it-or-leave-it settlement
715.22	and starting their lives elsewhere.
717.46	And one can understand
718.7	why the company would wish
718.7	to silence a squeaky wheel.
721.7	What I want to point the finger at
721.7	is the legal and regulatory system,
725.5	a system in which there are
725.5	networks of agreements
727.98	just like this one
729.9	which serve to silence people
729.9	and seal off data points
734.38	from public health experts
734.38	and epidemiologists,
737.06	a system in which regulators
738.7	will even refrain
738.7	from issuing a violation notice
741.86	in the event of pollution
743.26	if the landowner and the gas company
745.42	agree to settle.
747.02	This is a system which isn't just
747.02	bad from a public health point of view;
750.98	it exposes hazards to local families
754.3	who remain in the dark.
759.02	Now, I have given you two examples
759.02	not because they are isolated examples.
763.54	They are examples of a systemic problem.
766.06	I could share some counterexamples,
768.46	the case for example
768.46	of the public official
771.46	who sues the pharmaceutical company
774.58	for concealing the fact
776.22	that its antidepressant increases
776.22	suicidal thoughts in adolescents.
782.82	I can tell you about the regulator
782.82	who went after the food company
786.74	for exaggerating the purported
786.74	health benefits of its yogurt.
790.5	And I can tell you about the legislator
793.98	who despite heavy lobbying
793.98	directed at both sides of the aisle
798.3	pushes for environmental protections.
802.98	These are isolated examples,
804.74	but they are beacons of light
804.74	in the darkness,
808.94	and they can show us the way.
813.82	I began by suggesting that sometimes
813.82	we need to engage in conflict.
819.3	Governments should tussle with,
822.86	struggle with, at times engage
822.86	in direct conflict with corporations.
829.78	This is not because governments
829.78	are inherently good
834.06	and corporations are inherently evil.
836.34	Each is capable of good or ill.
841.26	But corporations understandably
841.26	act to promote their commercial interests,
846.9	and they do so either sometimes
846.9	undermining or promoting the common good.
852.98	But it is the responsibility
852.98	of governments
856.98	to protect and promote the common good.
860.22	And we should insist
862.94	that they fight to do so.
866.62	This is because governments
869.14	are the guardians
871.42	of public health;
873.74	governments are the guardians
876.5	of the environment;
878.38	and it is governments
880.22	that are guardians
881.54	of these essential parts
881.54	of our common good.
887.5	Thank you.
888.74	(Applause)
