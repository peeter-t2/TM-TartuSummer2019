12.68	This is one of the most amazing animals
12.68	on the face of the Earth.
18.84	This is a tapir.
20.96	Now this, this is a baby tapir,
24.64	the cutest animal offspring
24.64	in the animal kingdom.
28.6	(Laughter)
30	By far.
31.6	There is no competition here.
35.52	I have dedicated
35.52	the past 20 years of my life
38.24	to the research and conservation
38.24	of tapirs in Brazil,
41.44	and it has been absolutely amazing.
45.16	But at the moment,
45.16	I've been thinking really, really hard
48.68	about the impact of my work.
51.12	I've been questioning myself
51.12	about the real contributions I have made
55.24	for the conservation
55.24	of these animals I love so much.
58.8	Am I being effective
60.68	in safeguarding their survival?
63.68	Am I doing enough?
66.04	I guess the big question here is,
68.36	am I studying tapirs
68.36	and contributing to their conservation,
73.76	or am I just documenting their extinction?
77.76	The world is facing
77.76	so many different conservation crises.
81.72	We all know that.
81.72	It's all over the news every day.
85.08	Tropical forests and other ecosystems
85.08	are being destroyed,
89.4	climate change, so many species
89.4	on the brink of extinction:
93.68	tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs.
100.24	This is the lowland tapir,
100.24	the tapir species I work with,
103.96	the largest terrestrial mammal
103.96	of South America.
107.12	They're massive. They're powerful.
109.68	Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos.
112.24	That's half the size of a horse.
114.36	They're gorgeous.
116.2	Tapirs are mostly found
116.2	in tropical forests such as the Amazon,
121.12	and they absolutely need
121.12	large patches of habitat
125.6	in order to find all the resources
125.6	they need to reproduce and survive.
131.16	But their habitat is being destroyed,
134.12	and they have been hunted out of several
134.12	parts of their geographic distribution.
139.64	And you see, this is
139.64	very, very unfortunate
143.4	because tapirs are extremely important
143.4	for the habitats where they are found.
147.8	They're herbivores.
149.2	Fifty percent of their diet
149.2	consists of fruit,
152.56	and when they eat the fruit,
152.56	they swallow the seeds,
155.48	which they disperse throughout
155.48	the habitat through their feces.
159.12	They play this major role
159.12	in shaping and maintaining
163.68	the structure and diversity of the forest,
167.16	and for that reason, tapirs are known
167.16	as gardeners of the forest.
173.32	Isn't that amazing?
175.08	If you think about it,
176.92	the extinction of tapirs
176.92	would seriously affect
180	biodiversity as a whole.
182.92	I started my tapir work in 1996,
182.92	still very young, fresh out of college,
188.84	and it was a pioneer research
188.84	and conservation program.
192.2	At that point, we had nearly
192.2	zero information about tapirs,
195.56	mostly because they're
195.56	so difficult to study.
198.88	They're nocturnal, solitary,
198.88	very elusive animals,
203.44	and we got started getting
203.44	very basic data about these animals.
208.64	But what is it
208.64	that a conservationist does?
212.52	Well, first, we need data.
214.8	We need field research.
216.4	We need those long-term datasets
216.4	to support conservation action,
221.04	and I told you tapirs
221.04	are very hard to study,
224.08	so we have to rely
224.08	on indirect methods to study them.
228.04	We have to capture and anesthetize them
230.76	so that we can install GPS collars
230.76	around their necks
234.24	and follow their movements,
235.92	which is a technique used by many
235.92	other conservationists around the world.
240.36	And then we can gather information
240.36	about how they use space,
244.32	how they move through the landscape,
246.4	what are their priority habitats,
248.4	and so much more.
250.48	Next, we must disseminate what we learn.
254.44	We have to educate people about tapirs
257.16	and how important these animals are.
259.8	And it's amazing
259.8	how many people around the world
263.44	do not know what a tapir is.
266.28	In fact, many people think
266.28	this is a tapir.
270.92	Let me tell you, this is not a tapir.
273.44	(Laughter)
274.88	This is a giant anteater.
276.84	Tapirs do not eat ants. Never. Ever.
282.44	And then next we have to provide
282.44	training, capacity building.
287.2	It is our responsibility to prepare
287.2	the conservationists of the future.
291.68	We are losing several
291.68	conservation battles,
294.76	and we need more people doing what we do,
297.24	and they need the skills,
297.24	and they need the passion to do that.
301.64	Ultimately, we conservationists,
304.2	we must be able to apply our data,
306.84	to apply our accumulated knowledge
309.08	to support actual conservation action.
313.04	Our first tapir program
315.04	took place in the Atlantic Forest
317.32	in the eastern part of Brazil,
319.48	one of the most threatened
319.48	biomes in the world.
322.88	The destruction of the Atlantic Forest
325.08	began in the early 1500s,
327.32	when the Portuguese
327.32	first arrived in Brazil,
330.12	beginning European colonization
330.12	in the eastern part of South America.
334.56	This forest was almost completely cleared
337.88	for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching
337.88	and the construction of cities,
343.12	and today only seven percent
343.12	of the Atlantic forest
346.6	is still left standing.
348.8	And tapirs are found in very, very small,
348.8	isolated, disconnected populations.
355.2	In the Atlantic Forest, we found out
355.2	that tapirs move through open areas
359.88	of pastureland and agriculture
362.24	going from one patch of forest
362.24	to patch of forest.
366.48	So our main approach in this region
369.04	was to use our tapir data
369.04	to identify the potential places
373.44	for the establishment
373.44	of wildlife corridors
376.44	in between those patches of forest,
379.12	reconnecting the habitat
381.2	so that tapirs and many other animals
381.2	could cross the landscape safely.
385.96	After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest,
388.72	in 2008, we expanded our tapir
388.72	conservation efforts to the Pantanal
393.76	in the western part of Brazil
395.76	near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay.
399.16	This is the largest continuous
399.16	freshwater floodplain in the world,
404.6	an incredible place
406.08	and one of the most important strongholds
406.08	for lowland tapirs in South America.
410.76	And working in the Pantanal
410.76	has been extremely refreshing
415.28	because we found large,
415.28	healthy tapir populations in the area,
419.28	and we have been able to study tapirs
421.24	in the most natural conditions
421.24	we'll ever find,
425	very much free of threats.
428.28	In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars,
428.28	we are using another technique:
433	camera traps.
434.24	This camera is equipped
434.24	with a movement sensor
437.16	and it photographs animals
437.16	when they walk in front of it.
440.2	So thanks to these amazing devices,
442.68	we have been able
442.68	to gather precious information
445.92	about tapir reproduction
445.92	and social organization
448.88	which are very important
448.88	pieces of the puzzle
451.44	when you're trying to develop
451.44	those conservation strategies.
455.56	And right now, 2015,
455.56	we are expanding our work once again
460.28	to the Brazilian Cerrado,
462.16	the open grasslands and shrub forests
462.16	in the central part of Brazil.
466.36	Today this region is the very epicenter
466.36	of economic development in my country,
473.28	where natural habitat
473.28	and wildlife populations
476	are rapidly being eradicated
476	by several different threats,
480.12	including once again cattle ranching,
482.72	large sugarcane and soybean plantations,
485.48	poaching, roadkill, just to name a few.
489	And somehow, tapirs are still there,
492.64	which gives me a lot of hope.
495.08	But I have to say that starting
495.08	this new program in the Cerrado
499.6	was a bit of a slap in the face.
502.48	When you drive around
503.96	and you find dead tapirs
503.96	along the highways
507.8	and signs of tapirs wandering around
507.8	in the middle of sugarcane plantations
512.84	where they shouldn't be,
514.88	and you talk to kids and they tell you
514.88	that they know how tapir meat tastes
519.12	because their families poach and eat them,
522.52	it really breaks your heart.
526.039	The situation in the Cerrado
526.039	made me realize --
529.28	it gave me the sense of urgency.
532.24	I am swimming against the tide.
534.559	It made me realize that despite
534.559	two decades of hard work
538.24	trying to save these animals,
538.24	we still have so much work to do
541.8	if we are to prevent them
541.8	from disappearing.
544.88	We have to find ways
544.88	to solve all these problems.
548.84	We really do, and you know what?
550.72	We really came to a point
550.72	in the conservation world
554.16	where we have to think out of the box.
556.92	We'll have to be a lot more creative
556.92	than we are right now.
560.68	And I told you, roadkill is a big problem
560.68	for tapirs in the Cerrado,
564.6	so we just came up with the idea
564.6	of putting reflective stickers
568.04	on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs.
570.88	These are the same stickers
570.88	used on big trucks
573.24	to avoid collision.
574.88	Tapirs cross the highways after dark,
578.12	so the stickers will hopefully
578.12	help drivers see this shining thing
583.32	crossing the highway,
584.76	and maybe they will
584.76	slow down a little bit.
588.32	For now, this is just a crazy idea.
590.92	We don't know. We'll see if it will
590.92	reduce the amount of tapir roadkill.
595.6	But the point is, maybe this is
595.6	the kind of stuff that needs to be done.
600.92	And although I'm struggling
600.92	with all these questions
604.68	in my mind right now,
607.48	I have a pact with tapirs.
610.4	I know in my heart
612.16	that tapir conservation is my cause.
615.12	This is my passion.
616.84	I am not alone.
618.4	I have this huge network
618.4	of supporters behind me,
622.16	and there is no way
622.16	I'm ever going to stop.
625.2	I will continue doing this,
625.2	most probably for the rest of my life.
629.6	And I'll keep doing this
629.6	for Patrícia, my namesake,
633.92	one of the first tapirs we captured
633.92	and monitored in the Atlantic Forest
637.72	many, many years ago;
639.84	for Rita and her baby Vincent
639.84	in the Pantanal.
644.4	And I'll keep doing this for Ted,
644.4	a baby tapir we captured
648.52	in December last year
648.52	also in the Pantanal.
651.96	And I will keep doing this
654.08	for the hundreds of tapirs
654.08	that I've had the pleasure to meet
657.76	over the years
659	and the many others I know
659	I will encounter in the future.
662.56	These animals deserve to be cared for.
665.92	They need me. They need us.
668.92	And you know? We human beings
668.92	deserve to live in a world
673.92	where we can get out there
673.92	and see and benefit from
677.84	not only tapirs
679.52	but all the other beautiful species,
682.36	now and in the future.
685.2	Thank you so much.
687.32	(Applause)
