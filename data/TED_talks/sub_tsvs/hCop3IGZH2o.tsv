15.95	How can I speak in 10 minutes
18.205	about the bonds of women
18.205	over three generations,
21.773	about how the astonishing
21.773	strength of those bonds
24.848	took hold in the life
24.848	of a four-year-old girl
28.485	huddled with her young sister,
28.485	her mother and her grandmother
33.34	for five days and nights
33.34	in a small boat in the China Sea
37.19	more than 30 years ago.
39.733	Bonds that took hold
39.733	in the life of that small girl
42.311	and never let go --
44.767	that small girl now
44.767	living in San Francisco
47.389	and speaking to you today.
50.199	This is not a finished story.
52.785	It is a jigsaw puzzle
52.785	still being put together.
56.377	Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
60.216	Imagine the first piece:
60.216	a man burning his life's work.
64.934	He is a poet, a playwright,
68.227	a man whose whole life
69.533	had been balanced on the single hope
69.533	of his country's unity and freedom.
74.513	Imagine him as the communists
74.513	enter Saigon --
77.825	confronting the fact
77.825	that his life had been a complete waste.
81.71	Words, for so long his friends,
81.71	now mocked him.
85.511	He retreated into silence.
87.987	He died broken by history.
91.702	He is my grandfather.
94.347	I never knew him in real life.
98.271	But our lives are much more
98.271	than our memories.
101.67	My grandmother never
101.67	let me forget his life.
104.925	My duty was not to allow
104.925	it to have been in vain,
108.066	and my lesson was to learn
108.066	that, yes, history tried to crush us,
112.57	but we endured.
115.276	The next piece of the jigsaw
115.276	is of a boat in the early dawn
118.815	slipping silently out to sea.
122.091	My mother, Mai, was 18
122.091	when her father died --
125.582	already in an arranged marriage,
127.788	already with two small girls.
130.781	For her, life had distilled
130.781	itself into one task:
134.486	the escape of her family
134.486	and a new life in Australia.
138.75	It was inconceivable to her
138.75	that she would not succeed.
142.934	So after a four-year saga
142.934	that defies fiction,
145.86	a boat slipped out to sea
145.86	disguised as a fishing vessel.
150.673	All the adults knew the risks.
153.618	The greatest fear
153.618	was of pirates, rape and death.
158.256	Like most adults on the boat,
160.172	my mother carried
160.172	a small bottle of poison.
163.731	If we were captured,
163.731	first my sister and I,
167.026	then she and my grandmother would drink.
170.727	My first memories are from the boat --
173.533	the steady beat of the engine,
175.342	the bow dipping into each wave,
178.177	the vast and empty horizon.
181.305	I don't remember the pirates
181.305	who came many times,
183.832	but were bluffed by the bravado
183.832	of the men on our boat,
187.894	or the engine dying
187.894	and failing to start for six hours.
192.509	But I do remember the lights
192.509	on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast
197.043	and the young man who collapsed and died,
199.801	the journey's end too much for him,
203.339	and the first apple I tasted,
203.339	given to me by the men on the rig.
207.846	No apple has ever tasted the same.
213.445	After three months in a refugee camp,
213.445	we landed in Melbourne.
217.507	And the next piece of the jigsaw
217.507	is about four women
220.051	across three generations
220.051	shaping a new life together.
225.375	We settled in Footscray,
227.422	a working-class suburb
227.422	whose demographic is layers of immigrants.
231.771	Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs,
231.771	whose existence I was oblivious of,
236.096	there was no sense
236.096	of entitlement in Footscray.
239.163	The smells from shop doors
239.163	were from the rest of the world.
242.369	And the snippets of halting English
244.077	were exchanged between people
244.077	who had one thing in common:
247.744	They were starting again.
250.713	My mother worked on farms,
252.572	then on a car assembly line,
254.234	working six days, double shifts.
257.394	Somehow, she found time to study English
259.526	and gain IT qualifications.
262.514	We were poor.
264.624	All the dollars were allocated
266.4	and extra tuition in English
266.4	and mathematics was budgeted for
269.822	regardless of what missed out,
272.869	which was usually new clothes;
275.37	they were always secondhand.
277.601	Two pairs of stockings for school,
279.611	each to hide the holes in the other.
282.234	A school uniform down to the ankles,
282.234	because it had to last for six years.
288.016	And there were rare
288.016	"but searing chants of ""slit-eye"""
292.001	and the occasional graffiti:
293.755	"""Asian, go home."""
295.946	Go home to where?
298.229	Something stiffened inside me.
300.66	There was a gathering of resolve
300.66	and a quiet voice saying,
304.061	"""I will bypass you."""
307.244	My mother, my sister and I
307.244	slept in the same bed.
311.911	My mother was exhausted each night,
314.172	but we told one another about our day
316.253	and listened to the movements
316.253	of my grandmother around the house.
320.415	My mother suffered from nightmares,
320.415	all about the boat.
324.748	And my job was to stay awake
324.748	until her nightmares came
327.786	so I could wake her.
331.301	She opened a computer store,
333.137	then studied to be a beautician
333.137	and opened another business.
336.739	And the women came with their stories
338.542	about men who could not
338.542	make the transition,
341.202	angry and inflexible,
342.98	and troubled children
342.98	caught between two worlds.
346.424	Grants and sponsors were sought.
348.461	Centers were established.
351.2	I lived in parallel worlds.
353.34	In one, I was the classic Asian student,
356.402	relentless in the demands
356.402	that I made on myself.
359.83	In the other, I was enmeshed
359.83	in lives that were precarious,
362.949	tragically scarred by violence,
362.949	drug abuse and isolation.
367.979	But so many over the years were helped.
370.041	And for that work,
370.041	when I was a final-year law student,
372.977	I was chosen as the Young
372.977	Australian of the Year.
375.562	And I was catapulted from
375.562	one piece of the jigsaw to another,
379.514	and their edges didn't fit.
382.073	Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,
384.344	was now Tan Le,
384.344	refugee and social activist,
387.697	invited to speak in venues
387.697	she had never heard of
391.142	and into homes whose existence
391.142	she could never have imagined.
395.573	I didn't know the protocols.
397.665	I didn't know how to use the cutlery.
400.374	I didn't know how to talk about wine.
402.764	I didn't know how to talk about anything.
406.696	I wanted to retreat
406.696	to the routines and comfort
409.637	of life in an unsung suburb --
412.745	a grandmother, a mother and two daughters
415.391	ending each day as they had
415.391	for almost 20 years,
419.104	telling one another the story of their day
421.58	and falling asleep,
421.58	the three of us still in the same bed.
427.398	I told my mother I couldn't do it.
430.974	She reminded me that I was now
430.974	the same age she had been
434.446	when we boarded the boat.
436.808	"""No"" had never been an option."
440.139	"""Just do it,"" she said,"
441.49	"""and don't be what you're not."""
444.397	So I spoke out on youth
444.397	unemployment and education
447.645	and the neglect of the marginalized
447.645	and disenfranchised.
451.136	And the more candidly I spoke,
451.136	the more I was asked to speak.
456.517	I met people from all walks of life,
458.613	so many of them doing
458.613	the thing they loved,
461.187	living on the frontiers of possibility.
463.834	And even though I finished my degree,
466.26	I realized I could not settle
466.26	into a career in law.
469.937	There had to be another piece
469.937	of the jigsaw.
473.206	And I realized, at the same time,
475.562	that it is OK to be an outsider,
478.234	a recent arrival,
479.996	new on the scene --
481.885	and not just OK,
483.637	but something to be thankful for,
485.931	perhaps a gift from the boat.
488.552	Because being an insider can so easily
488.552	mean collapsing the horizons,
493.15	can so easily mean accepting
493.15	the presumptions of your province.
498.228	I have stepped outside
498.228	my comfort zone enough now
500.659	to know that, yes,
500.659	the world does fall apart,
503.403	but not in the way that you fear.
505.813	Possibilities that would not
505.813	have been allowed
508.117	were outrageously encouraged.
510.296	There was an energy there,
511.795	an implacable optimism,
513.874	a strange mixture of humility and daring.
517.566	So I followed my hunches.
519.337	I gathered around me
519.337	a small team of people
521.847	"for whom the label ""It can't be done"""
521.847	was an irresistible challenge.
526.635	For a year, we were penniless.
528.672	At the end of each day,
528.672	I made a huge pot of soup
531.038	which we all shared.
533.207	We worked well into each night.
535.588	Most of our ideas were crazy,
537.873	but a few were brilliant,
539.705	and we broke through.
542.809	I made the decision to move
542.809	to the US after only one trip.
546.98	My hunches again.
548.926	Three months later, I had relocated,
548.926	and the adventure has continued.
554.917	Before I close, though,
554.917	let me tell you about my grandmother.
559.278	She grew up at a time when Confucianism
559.278	was the social norm
562.925	and the local mandarin
562.925	was the person who mattered.
566.207	Life hadn't changed for centuries.
569.309	Her father died soon after she was born.
572.936	Her mother raised her alone.
575.952	At 17, she became the second wife
575.952	of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
581.991	With no support from her husband,
584.009	she caused a sensation
584.009	by taking him to court
586.739	and prosecuting her own case,
588.995	and a far greater sensation when she won.
591.746	(Laughter)
593.26	(Applause)
598.331	"""It can't be done"" was shown to be wrong."
603.885	I was taking a shower
603.885	in a hotel room in Sydney
606.937	the moment she died,
612.363	I looked through the shower screen
612.363	and saw her standing on the other side.
616.518	I knew she had come to say goodbye.
619.215	My mother phoned minutes later.
622.576	A few days later,
623.89	we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray
623.89	and sat around her casket.
628.236	We told her stories and assured her
628.236	that we were still with her.
632.985	At midnight, the monk came
632.985	and told us he had to close the casket.
638.658	My mother asked us to feel her hand.
641.814	She asked the monk,
643.26	"""Why is it that her hand is so warm"
643.26	"and the rest of her is so cold?"""
648.938	"""Because you have been holding it"
648.938	"since this morning,"" he said."
652.939	"""You have not let it go."""
657.502	If there is a sinew in our family,
657.502	it runs through the women.
662.36	Given who we were
662.36	and how life had shaped us,
665.337	we can now see that the men
665.337	that might have come into our lives
668.703	would have thwarted us.
670.626	Defeat would have come too easily.
673.85	Now I would like to have my own children,
673.85	and I wonder about the boat.
679.052	Who could ever wish it on their own?
682.197	Yet I am afraid of privilege,
684.367	of ease,
685.597	of entitlement.
687.717	Can I give them a bow in their lives,
687.717	dipping bravely into each wave,
692.778	the unperturbed and steady
692.778	beat of the engine,
696.149	the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?
700.699	I don't know.
702.492	But if I could give it
703.913	and still see them safely through,
706.251	I would.
708.585	(Applause)
721.354	Trevor Neilson: And also,
721.354	Tan's mother is here today,
724.642	in the fourth or fifth row.
726.26	(Applause)
