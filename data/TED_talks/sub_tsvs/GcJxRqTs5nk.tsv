15.887	I was born in Den Bosch,
17.523	where the painter Hieronymus Bosch
17.523	named himself after.
20.884	And I've always been very fond
20.884	of this painter
23.331	who lived and worked in the 15th century.
25.84	And what is interesting about him
25.84	in relation to morality
28.56	is that he lived at a time
28.56	where religion's influence was waning,
31.639	and he was sort of wondering, I think,
33.48	what would happen with society
33.48	if there was no religion
36.094	or if there was less religion.
37.578	And so he painted this famous painting,
37.578	"""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"""
41.056	which some have interpreted
41.056	as being humanity before the Fall,
44.939	or being humanity without any Fall at all.
48.201	And so it makes you wonder,
49.513	what would happen if we hadn't tasted
49.513	the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,
53.036	and what kind of morality would we have.
56.549	Much later, as a student,
56.549	I went to a very different garden,
59.583	a zoological garden in Arnhem
59.583	where we keep chimpanzees.
64.275	This is me at an early age
64.275	with a baby chimpanzee.
67.425	(Laughter)
70.134	And I discovered there
71.877	that the chimpanzees are very power-hungry
71.877	and wrote a book about it.
75.157	And at that time the focus
75.157	in a lot of animal research
77.708	was on aggression and competition.
80.159	I painted a whole picture
80.159	of the animal kingdom
82.44	and humanity included, was that deep down
82.44	we are competitors, we are aggressive,
87.662	we are all out
87.662	for our own profit, basically.
90.739	This is the launch of my book.
92.635	I'm not sure how well
92.635	the chimpanzees read it,
95.043	but they surely seemed
95.043	interested in the book.
97.738	(Laughter)
99.967	Now in the process of doing all this work
102.902	on power and dominance
102.902	and aggression and so on,
105.826	I discovered that chimpanzees
105.826	reconcile after fights.
109.033	And so what you see here
109.033	is two males who have had a fight.
111.843	They ended up in a tree, and one of them
111.843	holds out a hand to the other.
115.211	And about a second
115.211	after I took the picture,
117.305	they came together in the fork of the tree
119.39	and kissed and embraced each other.
121.13	And this is very interesting
122.498	because at the time, everything
122.498	was about competition and aggression,
125.819	so it wouldn't make any sense.
127.337	The only thing that matters
127.337	is that you win or you lose.
129.997	But why reconcile after a fight?
129.997	That doesn't make any sense.
132.958	This is the way bonobos do it.
132.958	Bonobos do everything with sex.
135.98	And so they also reconcile with sex.
137.818	But the principle is exactly the same.
139.768	The principle is that you have
139.768	a valuable relationship
143.767	that is damaged by conflict,
143.767	so you need to do something about it.
147.881	So my whole picture of the animal kingdom,
147.881	and including humans also,
152.272	started to change at that time.
154.235	So we have this image in political
154.235	science, economics, the humanities,
158.238	the philosophy for that matter,
158.238	that man is a wolf to man.
162.12	And so deep down,
162.12	our nature is actually nasty.
165.233	I think it's a very unfair
165.233	image for the wolf.
168.175	The wolf is, after all,
168.175	a very cooperative animal.
171.645	And that's why many of you
171.645	have a dog at home,
173.923	which has all these characteristics also.
176.166	And it's really unfair to humanity,
177.985	because humanity is actually
177.985	much more cooperative and empathic
181.26	than given credit for.
183.471	So I started getting
183.471	interested in those issues
185.755	and studying that in other animals.
188.09	So these are the pillars of morality.
189.968	If you ask anyone,
189.968	"""What is morality based on?"""
193.544	these are the two factors
193.544	that always come out.
195.763	One is reciprocity,
197.494	and associated with it is a sense
197.494	of justice and a sense of fairness.
201.073	And the other one is empathy
201.073	and compassion.
203.29	And human morality is more than this,
203.29	but if you would remove these two pillars,
207.565	there would be not much
207.565	remaining, I think.
209.718	So they're absolutely essential.
211.397	So let me give you a few examples here.
213.289	This is a very old video
213.289	from the Yerkes Primate Center,
216.013	where they trained
216.013	chimpanzees to cooperate.
219.005	So this is already
219.005	about a hundred years ago
221.475	that we were doing
221.475	experiments on cooperation.
224.591	What you have here is two
224.591	young chimpanzees who have a box,
228.147	and the box is too heavy
228.147	for one chimp to pull in.
231.176	And of course, there's food on the box.
233.059	Otherwise they wouldn't
233.059	be pulling so hard.
235.084	And so they're bringing in the box.
237.221	And you can see that they're synchronized.
239.514	You can see that they work together,
239.514	they pull at the same moment.
242.638	It's already a big advance
242.638	over many other animals
245.175	who wouldn't be able to do that.
246.837	Now you're going to get
246.837	a more interesting picture,
249.247	because now one
249.247	of the two chimps has been fed.
251.897	So one of the two is not really interested
251.897	in the task anymore.
257.168	(Laughter)
264.023	(Laughter)
275.054	(Laughter)
278.64	[- and sometimes appears to convey
278.64	its wishes and meanings by gestures.]
291.02	Now look at what happens
291.02	at the very end of this.
296.64	(Laughter)
307.767	He takes basically everything.
309.68	(Laughter)
312.68	There are two interesting
312.68	parts about this.
314.72	One is that the chimp on the right
316.386	has a full understanding
316.386	he needs the partner --
318.702	so a full understanding
318.702	of the need for cooperation.
321.161	The second one is that the partner
321.161	is willing to work
323.674	even though he's not
323.674	interested in the food.
325.82	Why would that be?
327.047	Well, that probably
327.047	has to do with reciprocity.
329.262	There's actually a lot of evidence
329.262	in primates and other animals
332.29	that they return favors.
333.836	He will get a return favor
333.836	at some point in the future.
336.548	And so that's how this all operates.
339.506	We do the same task with elephants.
341.219	Now, it's very dangerous
341.219	to work with elephants.
344.397	Another problem with elephants
344.397	is that you cannot make an apparatus
347.578	that is too heavy for a single elephant.
349.519	Now you can probably make it,
351.26	but it's going to be a pretty
351.26	clumsy apparatus, I think.
354.045	And so what we did in that case --
355.711	we do these studies in Thailand
355.711	for Josh Plotnik --
358.397	is we have an apparatus around which
358.397	there is a rope, a single rope.
362.354	And if you pull on this side of the rope,
362.354	the rope disappears on the other side.
366.141	So two elephants need to pick it up
366.141	at exactly the same time, and pull.
369.552	Otherwise nothing is going to happen
369.552	and the rope disappears.
372.623	The first tape you're going to see
374.855	is two elephants who are released together
374.855	arrive at the apparatus.
378.868	The apparatus is on the left,
378.868	with food on it.
382.096	And so they come together,
382.096	they arrive together,
385.142	they pick it up together,
385.142	and they pull together.
387.459	So it's actually fairly simple for them.
391.545	There they are.
400.466	So that's how they bring it in.
402.048	But now we're going to make it
402.048	more difficult.
404.229	Because the purpose of this experiment
406.073	is to see how well
406.073	they understand cooperation.
408.289	Do they understand that as well
408.289	as the chimps, for example?
411.151	What we do in the next step is we release
411.151	one elephant before the other
414.653	and that elephant needs to be smart enough
416.688	to stay there and wait
416.688	and not pull at the rope --
419.184	because if he pulls at the rope,
419.184	it disappears and the whole test is over.
422.689	Now this elephant does something illegal
422.689	that we did not teach it.
425.983	But it shows the understanding he has,
428.173	because he puts his big foot on the rope,
430.721	stands on the rope
430.721	and waits there for the other,
433.063	and then the other is going
433.063	to do all the work for him.
435.67	So it's what we call freeloading.
438.26	(Laughter)
441.299	But it shows the intelligence
441.299	that the elephants have.
444.139	They developed several
444.139	of these alternative techniques
446.736	that we did not approve of, necessarily.
448.718	(Laughter)
449.965	So the other elephant is now coming ...
455.006	and is going to pull it in.
474.598	Now look at the other;
474.598	it doesn't forget to eat, of course.
477.74	(Laughter)
480.937	This was the cooperation
480.937	and reciprocity part.
483.178	Now something on empathy.
484.421	Empathy is my main topic
484.421	at the moment, of research.
486.949	And empathy has two qualities:
488.421	One is the understanding part of it.
490.464	This is just a regular definition:
492.119	the ability to understand and share
492.119	the feelings of another.
494.955	And the emotional part.
496.188	Empathy has basically two channels:
496.188	One is the body channel,
499.623	If you talk with a sad person,
501.505	you're going to adopt
501.505	a sad expression and a sad posture,
504.782	and before you know it, you feel sad.
506.568	And that's sort of the body channel
506.568	of emotional empathy,
510.81	which many animals have.
512.113	Your average dog has that also.
513.692	That's why people keep mammals in the home
515.716	and not turtles or snakes
515.716	or something like that,
518.047	who don't have that kind of empathy.
519.86	And then there's a cognitive channel,
521.656	which is more that you can take
521.656	the perspective of somebody else.
524.744	And that's more limited.
525.926	Very few animals, I think elephants
525.926	and apes, can do that kind of thing.
531.771	So synchronization,
533.157	which is part of that whole
533.157	empathy mechanism,
535.324	is a very old one in the animal kingdom.
537.603	In humans, of course,
537.603	we can study that with yawn contagion.
540.868	Humans yawn when others yawn.
542.71	And it's related to empathy.
544.517	It activates the same areas in the brain.
546.676	Also, we know that people
546.676	who have a lot of yawn contagion
549.421	are highly empathic.
550.598	People who have problems with empathy,
550.598	such as autistic children,
553.797	they don't have yawn contagion.
555.313	So it is connected.
556.492	And we study that in our chimpanzees
556.492	by presenting them with an animated head.
560.239	So that's what you see on the upper-left,
560.239	an animated head that yawns.
564.254	And there's a chimpanzee watching,
565.898	an actual real chimpanzee
565.898	watching a computer screen
568.364	on which we play these animations.
576.591	(Laughter)
578.296	So yawn contagion
578.296	that you're probably all familiar with --
581.696	and maybe you're going
581.696	to start yawning soon now --
584.399	is something that we share
584.399	with other animals.
587.639	And that's related to that whole
587.639	body channel of synchronization
590.664	that underlies empathy,
592.408	and that is universal
592.408	in the mammals, basically.
595.535	We also study more complex expressions --
595.535	This is consolation.
598.67	This is a male chimpanzee
598.67	who has lost a fight and he's screaming,
601.794	and a juvenile comes over
601.794	and puts an arm around him
604.529	and calms him down.
605.718	That's consolation.
606.916	It's very similar to human consolation.
608.804	And consolation behavior --
610.987	(Laughter)
612.161	it's empathy driven.
613.87	Actually, the way to study
613.87	empathy in human children
616.711	is to instruct a family member
616.711	to act distressed,
619.309	and then to see what young children do.
621.296	And so it is related to empathy,
623.334	and that's the kind
623.334	of expressions we look at.
625.591	We also recently published an experiment
625.591	you may have heard about.
628.713	It's on altruism and chimpanzees,
630.72	where the question is: Do chimpanzees care
630.72	about the welfare of somebody else?
635.16	And for decades it had been assumed
635.16	that only humans can do that,
639.635	that only humans worry
639.635	about the welfare of somebody else.
642.918	Now we did a very simple experiment.
645.379	We do that on chimpanzees
645.379	that live in Lawrenceville,
648.03	in the field station of Yerkes.
649.796	And so that's how they live.
651.157	And we call them into a room
651.157	and do experiments with them.
654.391	In this case, we put
654.391	two chimpanzees side-by-side,
656.752	and one has a bucket full of tokens,
656.752	and the tokens have different meanings.
660.353	One kind of token feeds
660.353	only the partner who chooses,
662.95	the other one feeds both of them.
664.799	So this is a study we did
664.799	with Vicki Horner.
668.816	And here, you have the two color tokens.
671.109	So they have a whole bucket full of them.
673.092	And they have to pick
673.092	one of the two colors.
676.413	You will see how that goes.
679.101	So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,
682.433	which is the red token in this case,
685.118	he needs to give it to us,
686.772	we pick it up, we put it on a table
686.772	where there's two food rewards,
690.133	but in this case, only the one
690.133	on the right gets food.
692.692	The one on the left walks away
692.692	because she knows already
695.497	that this is not a good test for her.
697.591	Then the next one is the pro-social token.
700.3	So the one who makes the choices --
700.3	that's the interesting part here --
703.668	for the one who makes the choices,
703.668	it doesn't really matter.
706.512	So she gives us now a pro-social
706.512	token and both chimps get fed.
709.509	So the one who makes the choices
709.509	always gets a reward.
712.26	So it doesn't matter whatsoever.
713.862	And she should actually
713.862	be choosing blindly.
717.182	But what we find is that they prefer
717.182	the pro-social token.
720.565	So this is the 50 percent line,
720.565	that's the random expectation.
723.583	And especially if the partner draws
723.583	attention to itself, they choose more.
727.556	And if the partner
727.556	puts pressure on them --
729.588	so if the partner starts spitting water
729.588	and intimidating them --
732.751	then the choices go down.
734.303	(Laughter)
735.366	It's as if they're saying,
737.26	"""If you're not behaving,"
737.26	"I'm not going to be pro-social today."""
740.271	And this is what happens
740.271	without a partner,
742.299	when there's no partner sitting there.
744.137	So we found that the chimpanzees do care
744.137	about the well-being of somebody else --
747.98	especially, these are other members
747.98	of their own group.
751.435	So the final experiment
751.435	that I want to mention to you
754.228	is our fairness study.
755.899	And so this became a very famous study.
758.813	And there are now many more,
760.26	because after we did this
760.26	about 10 years ago,
762.427	it became very well-known.
764.784	And we did that originally
764.784	with Capuchin monkeys.
767.101	And I'm going to show you
767.101	the first experiment that we did.
769.915	It has now been done
769.915	with dogs and with birds
772.751	and with chimpanzees.
774.805	But with Sarah Brosnan,
774.805	we started out with Capuchin monkeys.
779.578	So what we did is we put
779.578	two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.
782.807	Again, these animals, live in a group,
782.807	they know each other.
785.66	We take them out of the group,
785.66	put them in a test chamber.
789.055	And there's a very simple task
789.055	that they need to do.
791.625	And if you give both of them
791.625	cucumber for the task,
795.029	the two monkeys side-by-side,
796.483	they're perfectly willing
796.483	to do this 25 times in a row.
799.337	So cucumber, even though
799.337	it's only really water in my opinion,
802.808	but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.
806.07	Now if you give the partner grapes --
808.377	the food preferences
808.377	of my Capuchin monkeys
810.548	correspond exactly with the prices
810.548	in the supermarket --
813.612	and so if you give them grapes --
813.612	it's a far better food --
817.041	then you create inequity between them.
819.962	So that's the experiment we did.
821.832	Recently, we videotaped it
821.832	with new monkeys
823.937	who'd never done the task,
825.298	thinking that maybe they would have
825.298	a stronger reaction,
827.954	and that turned out to be right.
829.517	The one on the left is the monkey
829.517	who gets cucumber.
832.037	The one on the right
832.037	is the one who gets grapes.
834.32	The one who gets cucumber --
835.691	note that the first piece
835.691	of cucumber is perfectly fine.
838.511	The first piece she eats.
840.26	Then she sees the other one getting grape,
840.26	and you will see what happens.
844.554	So she gives a rock to us.
844.554	That's the task.
847.157	And we give her a piece
847.157	of cucumber and she eats it.
850.239	The other one needs to give a rock to us.
853.448	And that's what she does.
855.847	And she gets a grape ...
858.839	and eats it.
860.026	The other one sees that.
861.245	She gives a rock to us now,
862.585	gets, again, cucumber.
867.62	(Laughter)
881.001	(Laughter ends)
883.026	She tests a rock now against the wall.
886.025	She needs to give it to us.
888.244	And she gets cucumber again.
892.603	(Laughter)
899.711	So this is basically
899.711	the Wall Street protest that you see here.
902.864	(Laughter)
905.26	(Applause)
909.537	I still have two minutes left --
911.347	let me tell you a funny story about this.
913.521	This study became very famous
913.521	and we got a lot of comments,
917.155	especially anthropologists,
917.155	economists, philosophers.
920.785	They didn't like this at all.
922.217	Because they had decided
922.217	in their minds, I believe,
924.803	that fairness is a very complex issue,
924.803	and that animals cannot have it.
929.472	And so one philosopher even wrote us
931.959	that it was impossible that monkeys
931.959	had a sense of fairness
934.757	because fairness was invented
934.757	during the French Revolution.
937.562	(Laughter)
940.003	And another one wrote a whole chapter
942.709	saying that he would believe
942.709	it had something to do with fairness,
946.26	if the one who got grapes
946.26	would refuse the grapes.
948.681	Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan,
948.681	who's been doing this with chimpanzees,
952.577	had a couple of combinations
952.577	of chimpanzees
954.747	where, indeed, the one
954.747	who would get the grape
957.127	would refuse the grape
957.127	until the other guy also got a grape.
960.057	So we're getting very close
960.057	to the human sense of fairness.
962.848	And I think philosophers need
962.848	to rethink their philosophy for a while.
966.918	So let me summarize.
968.852	I believe there's an evolved morality.
970.688	I think morality is much more
970.688	than what I've been talking about,
973.931	but it would be impossible
973.931	without these ingredients
976.406	that we find in other primates,
977.928	which are empathy and consolation,
979.789	pro-social tendencies and reciprocity
979.789	and a sense of fairness.
983.519	And so we work on these particular issues
985.6	to see if we can create a morality
985.6	from the bottom up, so to speak,
988.969	without necessarily
988.969	god and religion involved,
991.426	and to see how we can get
991.426	to an evolved morality.
994.326	And I thank you for your attention.
996.09	(Applause)
