12.944	I want to talk a little bit today
12.944	about labor and work.
18.5	When we think about how people work,
21.246	the naive intuition we have
23.639	is that people are like rats in a maze --
26.027	that all people care about is money,
28.02	and the moment we give them money,
29.696	we can direct them to work one way,
31.418	we can direct them to work another way.
33.422	This is why we give bonuses to bankers
33.422	and pay in all kinds of ways.
37.057	And we really have
37.057	this incredibly simplistic view
40.549	of why people work, and what
40.549	the labor market looks like.
44.843	At the same time, if you think about it,
47.19	there's all kinds of strange behaviors
47.19	in the world around us.
50.91	Think about something like mountaineering
50.91	and mountain climbing.
54.275	If you read books of people
54.275	who climb mountains, difficult mountains,
58.55	do you think that those books are full
58.55	of moments of joy and happiness?
63.699	No, they are full of misery.
66.04	In fact, it's all about frostbite
66.04	and having difficulty walking,
69.722	and difficulty breathing --
71.406	cold, challenging circumstances.
74.468	And if people were just trying
74.468	to be happy,
76.946	the moment they would get to the top,
78.827	they would say,
78.827	"""This was a terrible mistake."
80.976	"I'll never do it again."""
82.381	(Laughter)
83.522	"""Instead, let me sit on a beach"
83.522	"somewhere drinking mojitos."""
87.161	But instead, people go down,
90.859	and after they recover, they go up again.
93.756	And if you think about
93.756	mountain climbing as an example,
96.85	it suggests all kinds of things.
99.206	It suggests that we care
99.206	about reaching the end, a peak.
103.135	It suggests that we care
103.135	about the fight, about the challenge.
106.666	It suggests that there's all kinds
106.666	of other things that motivate us
110.15	to work or behave in all kinds of ways.
114.322	And for me personally,
114.322	I started thinking about this
116.821	after a student came to visit me.
120.085	This was one of my students
120.085	from a few years earlier,
124.014	and he came one day back to campus.
126.204	And he told me the following story:
128.359	He said that for more than two weeks,
130.805	he was working
130.805	on a PowerPoint presentation.
133.85	He was working in a big bank,
135.62	and this was in preparation
135.62	for a merger and acquisition.
139.43	And he was working very hard
139.43	on this presentation --
141.945	graphs, tables, information.
143.954	He stayed late at night every day.
147.464	And the day before it was due,
149.678	he sent his PowerPoint
149.678	presentation to his boss,
153.012	and his boss wrote him back and said,
155.642	"""Nice presentation,"
155.642	"but the merger is canceled."""
160.34	And the guy was deeply depressed.
162.475	Now at the moment when he was working,
164.659	he was actually quite happy.
166.543	Every night he was enjoying his work,
168.822	he was staying late, he was perfecting
168.822	this PowerPoint presentation.
173.52	But knowing that nobody would ever
173.52	watch it made him quite depressed.
178.779	So I started thinking
178.779	about how do we experiment
181.327	with this idea of the fruits of our labor.
185.366	And to start with, we created
185.366	a little experiment
189.588	in which we gave people Legos,
192.618	and we asked them to build with Legos.
195.96	And for some people,
195.96	we gave them Legos and we said,
199.501	"""Hey, would you like to build"
199.501	this Bionicle for three dollars?
204.27	"We'll pay you three dollars for it."""
206.344	And people said yes,
206.344	and they built with these Legos.
209.872	And when they finished, we took it,
209.872	we put it under the table,
213.462	"and we said, ""Would you like"
213.462	to build another one,
216.471	"this time for $2.70?"""
218.471	If they said yes,
218.471	we gave them another one,
220.512	and when they finished, we asked them,
222.393	"""Do you want to build another one?"""
222.393	for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,
226.237	until at some point people said,
228.111	"""No more. It's not worth it for me."""
232.102	This was what we called
232.102	the meaningful condition.
234.778	People built one Bionicle after another.
237.829	After they finished every one of them,
239.679	we put them under the table.
241.048	And we told them that at the end
241.048	of the experiment,
243.456	we will take all these Bionicles,
243.456	we will disassemble them,
246.556	we will put them back in the boxes,
248.403	and we will use it
248.403	for the next participant.
251.727	There was another condition.
253.282	This other condition was inspired
253.282	by David, my student.
257.814	And this other condition we called
257.814	the Sisyphic condition.
261.266	And if you remember
261.266	the story about Sisyphus,
263.475	Sisyphus was punished by the gods
263.475	to push the same rock up a hill,
268.726	and when he almost got to the end,
270.811	the rock would roll over,
270.811	and he would have to start again.
273.795	And you can think about this
273.795	as the essence of doing futile work.
278.691	You can imagine that if he pushed
278.691	the rock on different hills,
281.668	at least he would have
281.668	some sense of progress.
284.316	Also, if you look at prison movies,
287.024	sometimes the way that the guards
287.024	torture the prisoners
290.207	is to get them to dig a hole,
290.207	and when the prisoner is finished,
293.866	they ask him to fill the hole
293.866	back up and then dig again.
296.889	There's something
296.889	about this cyclical version
299.095	of doing something over and over and over
301.734	that seems to be
301.734	particularly demotivating.
304.575	So in the second condition
304.575	of this experiment,
306.806	that's exactly what we did.
308.496	We asked people,
309.807	"""Would you like to build"
309.807	"one Bionicle for three dollars?"""
312.99	And if they said yes, they built it.
315.309	"Then we asked them, ""Do you want"
315.309	"to build another one for $2.70?"""
318.738	And if they said yes,
318.738	we gave them a new one,
321.906	and as they were building it,
323.715	we took apart the one
323.715	that they just finished.
327.515	And when they finished that,
329.136	"we said, ""Would you like"
329.136	to build another one,
331.332	"this time for 30 cents less?"""
332.878	And if they said yes,
334.101	we gave them the one
334.101	that they built and we broke.
337.276	So this was an endless cycle
337.276	of them building,
340.887	and us destroying in front of their eyes.
344.643	Now what happens when you compare
344.643	these two conditions?
348.343	The first thing that happened was
348.343	that people built many more Bionicles --
351.898	eleven in the meaningful condition,
354.16	versus seven in the Sisyphus condition.
356.922	And by the way, we should point out
356.922	that this was not big meaning.
360.059	People were not curing cancer
360.059	or building bridges.
362.62	People were building
362.62	Bionicles for a few cents.
366.383	And not only that, everybody knew
368.36	that the Bionicles
368.36	would be destroyed quite soon.
371.686	So there was not a real
371.686	opportunity for big meaning.
374.541	But even the small meaning
374.541	made a difference.
378.471	Now we had another version
378.471	of this experiment.
380.813	In this other version of the experiment,
382.752	we didn't put people in this situation,
384.719	we just described to them the situation,
386.749	much as I am describing to you now,
388.879	and we asked them to predict
388.879	what the result would be.
392.258	What happened?
393.441	People predicted the right direction
393.441	but not the right magnitude.
397.491	People who were just given
397.491	the description of the experiment
401.198	said that in the meaningful condition,
403.11	people would probably build
403.11	one more Bionicle.
405.792	So people understand
405.792	that meaning is important,
408.045	they just don't understand
408.045	the magnitude of the importance,
410.903	the extent to which it's important.
413.657	There was one other piece
413.657	of data we looked at.
416.474	If you think about it, there are
416.474	some people who love Legos,
419.355	and some people who don't.
420.841	And you would speculate
420.841	that the people who love Legos
423.428	would build more Legos,
423.428	even for less money,
425.544	because after all,
425.544	they get more internal joy from it.
428.765	And the people who love Legos less
428.765	would build less Legos
431.885	because the enjoyment
431.885	that they derive from it is lower.
434.813	And that's actually what we found
434.813	in the meaningful condition.
437.765	There was a very nice correlation
437.765	between the love of Legos
440.598	and the amount of Legos people built.
443.012	What happened in the Sisyphic condition?
445.679	In that condition,
445.679	the correlation was zero --
448.314	there was no relationship
448.314	between the love of Legos,
451.059	and how much people built,
452.846	which suggests to me
452.846	that with this manipulation
455.545	of breaking things
455.545	in front of people's eyes,
458.007	we basically crushed any joy
458.007	that they could get out of this activity.
462.58	We basically eliminated it.
465.833	Soon after I finished
465.833	running this experiment,
469.078	I went to talk to a big
469.078	software company in Seattle.
473.392	I can't tell you who they were,
473.392	but they were a big company in Seattle.
477.26	This was a group
477.26	within the software company
479.372	that was put in a different building,
481.188	and they asked them to innovate,
482.832	and create the next big product
482.832	for this company.
486.59	And the week before I showed up,
488.143	the CEO of this big software company
488.143	went to that group, 200 engineers,
492.574	and canceled the project.
495.311	And I stood there in front of 200
497.365	of the most depressed
497.365	people I've ever talked to.
501.014	And I described to them
501.014	some of these Lego experiments,
503.661	and they said they felt like they had
503.661	just been through that experiment.
509.053	And I asked them, I said,
510.3	"""How many of you now show up"
510.3	"to work later than you used to?"""
513.916	And everybody raised their hand.
515.894	"I said, ""How many of you now go home"
515.894	"earlier than you used to?"""
519.093	Everybody raised their hand.
521.006	"I asked them, ""How many of you now add"
523.709	not-so-kosher things
523.709	"to your expense reports?"""
526.866	And they didn't raise their hands,
528.541	but they took me out to dinner
530.01	and showed me what they could do
530.01	with expense reports.
534.58	And then I asked them, I said,
536.056	"""What could the CEO have done"
536.056	"to make you not as depressed?"""
540.421	And they came up with all kinds of ideas.
542.548	They said the CEO could have asked
542.548	them to present to the whole company
545.953	about their journey
545.953	over the last two years
547.98	and what they decided to do.
549.406	He could have asked them to think
549.406	about which aspect of their technology
553.19	could fit with other parts
553.19	of the organization.
556.536	He could have asked them to build
556.536	some next-generation prototypes,
559.878	and see how they would work.
561.903	But the thing is that any one of those
561.903	would require some effort and motivation.
566.912	And I think the CEO basically did not
566.912	understand the importance of meaning.
571.116	If the CEO, just like our participants,
573.338	thought the essence
573.338	of meaning is unimportant,
576.323	then he [wouldn't] care.
577.561	"And he would say, ""At the moment"
577.561	I directed you in this way,
580.484	and now that I'm directing
580.484	you in this way,
582.531	"everything will be okay."""
584.077	But if you understood
584.077	how important meaning is,
586.776	then you would figure out
586.776	that it's actually important
589.378	to spend some time, energy and effort
591.196	in getting people to care more
591.196	about what they're doing.
595.322	The next experiment
595.322	was slightly different.
597.457	We took a sheet of paper
597.457	with random letters,
600.116	and we asked people
600.116	to find pairs of letters
602.227	that were identical next to each other.
604.282	That was the task.
605.466	People did the first sheet,
606.894	then we asked if they wanted to do
606.894	another for a little less money,
610.263	the next sheet for a little bit
610.263	less, and so on and so forth.
613.163	And we had three conditions.
614.747	In the first condition, people
614.747	wrote their name on the sheet,
618.351	found all the pairs of letters,
620.665	gave it to the experimenter,
622.33	the experimenter would look at it,
624.237	scan it from top to bottom,
625.996	"say ""Uh huh,"" and put it"
625.996	on the pile next to them.
630.68	In the second condition,
630.68	people did not write their name on it.
633.99	The experimenter looked at it,
636.379	took the sheet of paper,
636.379	did not look at it, did not scan it,
639.346	and simply put it on the pile of pages.
642.974	So you take a piece,
642.974	you just put it on the side.
645.534	In the third condition,
646.883	the experimenter got the sheet of paper,
649.25	and put it directly into a shredder.
651.756	(Laughter)
655.177	What happened in those three conditions?
657.994	In this plot I'm showing you
657.994	at what pay rate people stopped.
662.22	So low numbers mean
662.22	that people worked harder.
664.826	They worked for much longer.
666.952	In the acknowledged condition,
668.53	people worked all the way
668.53	down to 15 cents.
671.654	At 15 cents per page,
673.295	they basically stopped these efforts.
675.642	In the shredder condition, it was twice
675.642	as much -- 30 cents per sheet.
680.153	And this is basically
680.153	the result we had before.
682.416	You shred people's efforts, output --
685.804	you get them not to be as happy
685.804	with what they're doing.
688.488	But I should point out, by the way,
690.216	that in the shredder condition,
690.216	people could have cheated.
692.97	They could have done not so good work,
694.999	because they realized
694.999	people were just shredding it.
697.522	So maybe the first sheet
697.522	you'd do good work,
699.633	but then you see nobody
699.633	is really testing it,
701.792	so you would do more and more and more.
703.729	So in fact, in the shredder condition,
705.593	people could have submitted more work
705.593	and gotten more money,
708.451	and put less effort into it.
710.471	But what about the ignored condition?
712.44	Would the ignored condition
712.44	be more like the acknowledged
715.194	or more like the shredder,
715.194	or somewhere in the middle?
718.137	It turns out it was
718.137	almost like the shredder.
721.473	Now there's good news and bad news here.
724.917	The bad news is that ignoring
724.917	the performance of people
729.004	is almost as bad as shredding
729.004	their effort in front of their eyes.
733.3	Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.
737.213	The good news is that by simply looking
737.213	at something that somebody has done,
741.546	"scanning it and saying ""Uh huh,"""
743.563	that seems to be quite sufficient
745.173	to dramatically improve
745.173	people's motivations.
748.585	So the good news is that adding motivation
751.389	doesn't seem to be so difficult.
753.912	The bad news is
753.912	that eliminating motivations
756.09	seems to be incredibly easy,
757.865	and if we don't think about it
757.865	carefully, we might overdo it.
761.681	So this is all in terms
761.681	of negative motivation,
765.116	or eliminating negative motivation.
768.426	The next part I want to show you
768.426	is something about positive motivation.
772.473	So there is a store
772.473	in the U.S. called IKEA.
776.97	And IKEA is a store
776.97	with kind of okay furniture
781.199	that takes a long time to assemble.
783.667	(Laughter)
785.714	I don't know about you,
786.89	but every time I assemble one of those,
788.787	it takes me much longer,
788.787	it's much more effortful,
791.152	it's much more confusing,
791.152	I put things in the wrong way --
795.186	I can't say I enjoy those pieces.
798.175	I can't say I enjoy the process.
801.04	But when I finish it,
802.7	I seem to like those
802.7	IKEA pieces of furniture
804.842	more than I like other ones.
806.718	(Laughter)
807.798	And there's an old story about cake mixes.
811.758	So when they started
811.758	cake mixes in the '40s,
815.009	they would take this powder
815.009	and they would put it in a box,
818.489	and they would ask housewives
818.489	to basically pour it in,
821.554	stir some water in it,
823.3	mix it, put it in the oven,
823.3	and -- voila -- you had cake.
827.586	But it turns out they were very unpopular.
829.639	People did not want them,
831.474	and they thought about
831.474	all kinds of reasons for that.
834.023	Maybe the taste was not good?
835.456	No, the taste was great.
836.656	What they figured out was
836.656	that there was not enough effort involved.
841.68	It was so easy that nobody
841.68	could serve cake to their guests
845.081	"and say, ""Here is my cake."""
847.389	No, it was somebody else's cake,
847.389	as if you bought it in the store.
850.989	It didn't really feel like your own.
853.574	So what did they do?
855.043	They took the eggs and the milk
855.043	out of the powder.
858.313	(Laughter)
860.063	Now you had to break
860.063	the eggs and add them,
863.904	you had to measure the milk
863.904	and add it, mixing it.
867.084	Now it was your cake.
867.084	Now everything was fine.
869.941	(Laughter)
872.329	(Applause)
879.904	Now, I think a little bit
879.904	like the IKEA effect,
882.157	by getting people to work harder,
883.809	they actually got them to love
883.809	what they're doing
886.246	to a higher degree.
888.15	So how do we look at this
888.15	question experimentally?
891.046	We asked people to build some origami.
893.223	We gave them instructions
893.223	on how to create origami,
896	and we gave them a sheet of paper.
897.762	And these were all novices,
899.604	and they built something
899.604	that was really quite ugly --
902.182	nothing like a frog or a crane.
905.086	But then we told them,
905.086	"""Look, this origami really belongs to us."
908.151	You worked for us, but I'll tell
908.151	you what, we'll sell it to you.
911.199	"How much do you want to pay for it?"""
913.61	And we measured how much
913.61	they were willing to pay for it.
916.31	And we had two types of people:
918.142	We had the people who built it,
920.11	and the people who did not build it,
921.913	and just looked at it
921.913	as external observers.
925.173	And what we found
925.173	was that the builders thought
927.428	that these were beautiful
927.428	pieces of origami --
930.08	(Laughter)
931.366	and they were willing to pay
931.366	five times more for them
933.881	than the people who just
933.881	evaluated them externally.
936.89	Now you could say --
936.89	if you were a builder,
939.942	do you think [you'd say],
939.942	"""Oh, I love this origami,"
943.134	but I know that nobody
943.134	"else would love it?"""
946.474	"Or ""I love this origami,"
946.474	"and everybody else will love it as well?"""
951.892	Which one of those two is correct?
954.297	Turns out the builders
954.297	not only loved the origami more,
957.773	they thought that everybody
957.773	would see the world in their view.
961.101	They thought everybody else
961.101	would love it more as well.
964.451	In the next version,
964.451	we tried to do the IKEA effect.
966.913	We tried to make it more difficult.
969.126	So for some people, we gave the same task.
971.778	For some people, we made it harder
971.778	by hiding the instructions.
976.001	At the top of the sheet,
976.001	we had little diagrams
978.407	of how you fold origami.
980.39	For some people, we just eliminated that.
983.151	So now this was tougher.
984.867	What happened?
986.048	Well in an objective way,
988.119	the origami now was uglier,
988.119	it was more difficult.
992.064	Now when we looked at the easy
992.064	origami, we saw the same thing --
995.095	builders loved it more,
995.095	evaluators loved it less.
998.341	When you looked at the hard instructions,
1000.524	the effect was larger.
1003.246	Why?
1004.422	Because now the builders
1004.422	loved it even more.
1007.516	(Laughter)
1008.746	They put all this extra effort into it.
1011.352	And evaluators?
1013.212	They loved it even less.
1014.863	Because in reality, it was even uglier
1014.863	than the first version.
1018.736	(Laughter)
1020.101	Of course, this tells you something
1020.101	about how we evaluate things.
1024.835	Now think about kids.
1027.216	"Imagine I asked you, ""How much"
1027.216	"would you sell your kids for?"""
1031.748	Your memories and associations and so on.
1033.78	Most people would say
1033.78	for a lot, a lot of money.
1036.443	(Laughter)
1037.631	On good days.
1039.039	(Laughter)
1040.303	But imagine this was slightly different.
1042.232	Imagine if you did not have your kids.
1044.066	And one day you went to the park
1044.066	and you met some kids.
1046.825	They were just like your kids,
1048.331	and you played with them for a few hours,
1050.373	and when you were about to leave,
1050.373	"the parents said, ""Hey, by the way,"
1053.746	just before you leave,
1053.746	"if you're interested, they're for sale."""
1056.753	(Laughter)
1058.883	How much would you pay for them now?
1061.803	Most people say not that much.
1064.549	And this is because our kids
1064.549	are so valuable,
1068.743	not just because of who they are,
1070.897	but because of us,
1072.532	because they are so connected to us,
1074.716	and because of the time and connection.
1077.311	By the way, if you think
1077.311	IKEA instructions are not good,
1080.242	what about the instructions that come
1080.242	with kids, those are really tough.
1083.654	(Laughter)
1084.686	By the way, these are my kids, which,
1084.686	of course, are wonderful and so on.
1088.952	Which comes to tell you one more thing,
1090.9	which is, much like our builders,
1093.374	when they look at the creature
1093.374	of their creation,
1097.239	we don't see that other people
1097.239	don't see things our way.
1102.463	Let me say one last comment.
1105.162	If you think about Adam Smith
1105.162	versus Karl Marx,
1108.979	Adam Smith had a very important
1108.979	notion of efficiency.
1112.75	He gave an example of a pin factory.
1115.464	He said pins have 12 different steps,
1118.445	and if one person does all 12 steps,
1118.445	production is very low.
1122.818	But if you get one person to do step one,
1124.97	and one person to do step two
1124.97	and step three and so on,
1127.747	production can increase tremendously.
1130.382	And indeed, this is a great example,
1132.145	and the reason for the Industrial
1132.145	Revolution and efficiency.
1136.27	Karl Marx, on the other hand,
1137.88	said that the alienation
1137.88	of labor is incredibly important
1141.365	in how people think about the connection
1141.365	to what they are doing.
1144.785	And if you do all 12 steps,
1144.785	you care about the pin.
1148.079	But if you do one step every time,
1148.079	maybe you don't care as much.
1152.568	I think that in the Industrial Revolution,
1155.377	Adam Smith was more
1155.377	correct than Karl Marx.
1158.488	But the reality is that we've switched,
1161.347	and now we're in the knowledge economy.
1163.379	You can ask yourself, what happens
1163.379	in a knowledge economy?
1166.29	Is efficiency still more
1166.29	important than meaning?
1169.561	I think the answer is no.
1170.995	I think that as we move to situations
1173.213	in which people have
1173.213	to decide on their own
1176.196	about how much effort, attention,
1176.196	caring, how connected they feel to it,
1180.39	are they thinking about labor
1180.39	on the way to work,
1182.789	and in the shower and so on,
1184.39	all of a sudden Marx
1184.39	has more things to say to us.
1188.843	So when we think about labor,
1190.273	we usually think about motivation
1190.273	and payment as the same thing,
1193.697	but the reality is that we should
1193.697	probably add all kinds of things to it --
1197.323	meaning, creation, challenges,
1197.323	ownership, identity, pride, etc.
1201.823	The good news is that if we added
1201.823	all of those components
1204.53	and thought about them --
1206.132	how do we create our own
1206.132	meaning, pride, motivation,
1209.569	and how do we do it in our workplace,
1211.443	and for the employees --
1212.865	I think we could get people to be
1212.865	both more productive and happier.
1216.854	Thank you very much.
1218.184	(Applause)
