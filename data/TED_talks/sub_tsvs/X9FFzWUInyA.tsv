12.446	I am a neuroscientist
14.071	with a mixed background in physics and medicine.
17.882	My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
22.923	focuses on spinal cord injury,
26.113	which affects more than 50,000 people
28.844	around the world every year,
31.534	with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,
35.14	whose life literally shatters
37.373	in a matter of a handful of seconds.
40.608	And for me, the Man of Steel,
43.666	Christopher Reeve,
45.87	has best raised the awareness
47.96	on the distress of spinal cord injured people.
50.875	And this is how I started my own personal journey
54.014	in this field of research,
55.513	working with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.
58.95	I still remember this decisive moment.
63.546	It was just at the end of a regular day of work
65.497	with the foundation.
67.04	Chris addressed us, the scientists and experts,
71.692	"""You have to be more pragmatic."
75.285	When leaving your laboratory tomorrow,
77.637	I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center
80.541	to watch injured people
82.15	fighting to take a step,
84.175	struggling to maintain their trunk.
86.816	And when you go home,
88.229	think of what you are going to change in your research
90.639	"on the following day to make their lives better."""
94.207	These words, they stuck with me.
98.26	This was more than 10 years ago,
100.651	but ever since, my laboratory has followed
103.418	the pragmatic approach to recovery
105.381	after spinal cord injury.
107.792	And my first step in this direction
109.833	was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury
113.122	that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury
116.769	while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.
120.141	And for this purpose, we placed two hemisections
122.708	on opposite sides of the body.
124.123	They completely interrupt the communication
126.268	between the brain and the spinal cord,
128.85	thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis
131.56	of the leg.
133.327	But, as observed, after most injuries in humans,
137.218	there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue
140.168	through which recovery can occur.
142.871	But how to make it happen?
145.912	Well, the classical approach
149.273	consists of applying intervention
151.909	that would promote the growth of the severed fiber
154.819	to the original target.
156.927	And while this certainly remained the key for a cure,
160.678	this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.
164.193	To reach clinical fruition rapidly,
166.918	it was obvious:
168.478	I had to think about the problem differently.
172.398	It turned out that more than 100 years of research
175.506	on spinal cord physiology,
177.147	starting with the Nobel Prize Sherrington,
179.472	had shown that
181.279	the spinal cord, below most injuries,
183.514	contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks
186.767	to coordinate locomotion,
189.087	but because input from the brain is interrupted,
192.046	they are in a nonfunctional state, like kind of dormant.
195.214	My idea: We awaken this network.
199.546	And at the time, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Los Angeles,
203.833	after completing my Ph.D. in France,
206.399	where independent thinking
208.308	is not necessarily promoted.
211.415	(Laughter)
213.242	I was afraid to talk to my new boss,
216.995	but decided to muster up my courage.
219.388	I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor,
222.045	Reggie Edgerton, to share my new idea.
226.036	He listened to me carefully,
228.286	and responded with a grin.
231.227	"""Why don't you try?"""
233.27	And I promise to you,
235.395	this was such an important moment in my career,
238.75	when I realized that the great leader
241.185	believed in young people and new ideas.
244.178	And this was the idea:
245.786	I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor
248.452	to explain to you this complicated concept.
250.578	Imagine that the locomotor system is a car.
255.344	The engine is the spinal cord.
257.59	The transmission is interrupted. The engine is turned off.
260.848	How could we re-engage the engine?
263.855	First, we have to provide the fuel;
266.997	second, press the accelerator pedal;
269.34	third, steer the car.
271.278	It turned out that there are known neural pathways
273.04	coming from the brain that play this very function
275.994	during locomotion.
277.376	My idea: Replace this missing input
280.091	to provide the spinal cord
281.493	with the kind of intervention
282.889	that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.
287.619	For this, I leveraged 20 years of past research in neuroscience,
292.058	first to replace the missing fuel
294.822	with pharmacological agents
296.89	that prepare the neurons in the spinal cord to fire,
300.37	and second, to mimic the accelerator pedal
304.425	with electrical stimulation.
305.905	So here imagine an electrode
308.074	implanted on the back of the spinal cord
310.48	to deliver painless stimulation.
312.742	It took many years, but eventually we developed
315.574	an electrochemical neuroprosthesis
318.131	that transformed the neural network
319.897	in the spinal cord from dormant to a highly functional state.
324.903	Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.
331.183	As soon as the treadmill belt starts moving,
333.51	the animal shows coordinated movement of the leg,
337.316	but without the brain.
339.294	"Here what I call ""the spinal brain"""
341.284	cognitively processes sensory information
344.406	arising from the moving leg
346.301	and makes decisions as to how to activate the muscle
349.996	in order to stand, to walk, to run,
353.386	and even here, while sprinting,
355.498	instantly stand
357.795	if the treadmill stops moving.
360.258	This was amazing.
361.595	I was completely fascinated by this locomotion
364.982	without the brain,
367.477	but at the same time so frustrated.
371.132	This locomotion was completely involuntary.
373.525	The animal had virtually no control over the legs.
376.89	Clearly, the steering system was missing.
381.01	And it then became obvious from me
382.902	that we had to move away
384.25	from the classical rehabilitation paradigm,
387.622	stepping on a treadmill,
389.344	and develop conditions that would encourage
392.564	the brain to begin voluntary control over the leg.
397.797	With this in mind, we developed a completely new
401.182	robotic system to support the rat
404.412	in any direction of space.
406.938	Imagine, this is really cool.
409.113	So imagine the little 200-gram rat
412.944	attached at the extremity of this 200-kilo robot,
416.645	but the rat does not feel the robot.
419.217	The robot is transparent,
421.289	just like you would hold a young child
423.651	during the first insecure steps.
426.015	Let me summarize: The rat received
429.569	a paralyzing lesion of the spinal cord.
432.014	The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enabled
434.604	a highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.
438.811	The robot provided the safe environment
442.577	to allow the rat to attempt anything
444.54	to engage the paralyzed legs.
447.222	And for motivation, we used what I think
450.047	is the most powerful pharmacology of Switzerland:
453.881	fine Swiss chocolate.
456.188	(Laughter)
459.11	Actually, the first results were very, very,
463.673	very disappointing.
466.308	Here is my best physical therapist
476.794	completely failing to encourage the rat
479.384	to take a single step,
481.445	whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier,
484.291	walked beautifully on the treadmill.
486.597	We were so frustrated.
488.754	But you know, one of the most essential qualities
491.653	of a scientist is perseverance.
494.129	We insisted. We refined our paradigm,
497.545	and after several months of training,
499.808	the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand,
503.614	and whenever she decided,
505.426	initiated full weight-bearing locomotion
507.758	to sprint towards the rewards.
511.008	This is the first recovery ever observed
514.413	of voluntary leg movement
516.307	after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord
518.761	leading to complete and permanent paralysis.
522.222	In fact --
524.209	(Applause)
525.929	Thank you.
530.308	In fact, not only could the rat initiate
533.402	and sustain locomotion on the ground,
536.079	they could even adjust leg movement,
538.36	for example, to resist gravity
540.716	in order to climb a staircase.
543.34	I can promise you this was
545.29	such an emotional moment in my laboratory.
548.399	It took us 10 years of hard work
551.142	to reach this goal.
553.593	But the remaining question was, how?
556.144	I mean, how is it possible?
557.836	And here, what we found
559.514	was completely unexpected.
563.19	This novel training paradigm
567.348	encouraged the brain to create new connections,
571.019	some relay circuits
573.921	that relay information from the brain
576.969	past the injury and restore cortical control
580.125	over the locomotor networks below the injury.
583.566	And here, you can see one such example,
586.488	where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.
589.851	This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center,
593.271	and what this constellation
595.634	of synaptic contacts means
597.985	is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center
601.784	with only one relay neuron.
605.782	But the remodeling was not restricted
607.713	to the lesion area.
608.8	It occurred throughout the central nervous system,
612.089	including in the brain stem,
614.407	where we observed up to 300-percent increase
617.669	in the density of fibers coming from the brain.
621.428	We did not aim to repair the spinal cord,
624.955	yet we were able to promote
627.552	one of the more extensive remodeling
629.709	of axonal projections ever observed
632.178	in the central nervous system of adult mammal
634.439	after an injury.
636.984	And there is a very important message
642.053	hidden behind this discovery.
646.496	They are the result of a young team
649.718	of very talented people:
652.11	physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons,
656.568	engineers of all kinds,
658.767	who have achieved together
660.558	what would have been impossible by single individuals.
664.201	This is truly a trans-disciplinary team.
667.284	They are working so close to each other
669.472	that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.
672.663	We are creating the next generation
674.286	of M.D.'s and engineers
676.527	capable of translating discoveries all the way
678.971	from bench to bedside.
681.643	And me?
683.649	I am only the maestro who orchestrated this beautiful symphony.
688.196	Now, I am sure you are all wondering, aren't you,
694.999	will this help injured people?
698.763	Me too, every day.
702.655	The truth is that we don't know enough yet.
706.068	This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury,
710.292	but I begin to believe that this may lead
713.026	to an intervention to improve recovery
715.593	and people's quality of life.
718.78	I would like you all
721.269	to take a moment and dream with me.
724.896	Imagine a person just suffered a spinal cord injury.
730.791	After a few weeks of recovery,
733.946	we will implant a programmable pump
736.306	to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail
739.339	directly to the spinal cord.
741.781	At the same time, we will implant an electrode array,
745.044	a sort of second skin
747.151	covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movement,
750.711	and this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator
753.977	that delivers stimulations that are tailored
756.439	to the person's needs.
758.625	This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis
763.483	that will enable locomotion
766.234	during training with a newly designed supporting system.
770.281	And my hope is that after several months of training,
773.564	there may be enough remodeling of residual connection
775.727	to allow locomotion without the robot,
779.396	maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.
783.174	My hope here is to be able to create
785.708	the personalized condition
787.973	to boost the plasticity of the brain
790.636	and the spinal cord.
792.167	And this is a radically new concept
794.906	that may apply to other neurological disorders,
798.199	"what I termed ""personalized neuroprosthetics,"""
802.737	where by sensing and stimulating neural interfaces,
805.761	I implanted throughout the nervous system,
809.475	in the brain, in the spinal cord,
812.816	even in peripheral nerves,
815.572	based on patient-specific impairments.
818.739	But not to replace the lost function, no --
823.347	to help the brain help itself.
826.538	And I hope this enticed your imagination,
829.178	because I can promise to you
831.074	this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur,
834.317	but when.
836.109	And remember, we are only as great
838.357	as our imagination, as big as our dream.
841.942	Thank you.
843.934	(Applause)
