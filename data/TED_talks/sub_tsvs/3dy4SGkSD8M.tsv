12.905	Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman
12.905	doesn't need much of an introduction,
16.549	but TED's audience is global,
18.078	it's diverse,
19.299	so I've been tasked
19.299	with starting with his bio,
22.309	which could easily take up
22.309	the entire 18 minutes.
24.619	So instead we're going to do
28.586	(Laughter)
30.258	You were born in New Hampshire.
31.829	Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.
33.568	EH: New Haven, Connecticut.
34.878	(Laughter)
37.79	NL: There goes seven more seconds.
39.434	EH: Nailed it.
40.701	(Laughter)
43.042	You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.
44.971	Your father was a con man --
44.971	I got that right.
47.4	He was taken away to prison
47.4	when you were nine years old.
50.171	You flew 52 missions
50.171	as a fighter pilot in World War II.
53.686	You came back to --
54.86	NL: Radio operator.
56.542	EH: You came to LA
56.542	to break into Hollywood,
59.049	first in publicity, then in TV.
60.953	You had no training as a writer, formally,
63.136	but you hustled your way in.
64.564	Your breakthrough, your debut,
66.041	was a little show
66.041	"called ""All in the Family."""
68.333	You followed that up with a string of hits
70.461	that to this day is unmatched
70.461	in Hollywood:
72.603	"""Sanford and Son,"" ""Maude,"" ""Good Times,"""
74.667	"""The Jeffersons,"" ""One Day at a Time,"""
76.517	"""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"""
77.954	to name literally a fraction of them.
79.741	Not only are they all commercially --
81.542	(Applause)
85.572	Not only are they all
85.572	commercially successful,
88.581	but many of them push our culture forward
90.579	by giving the underrepresented
90.579	members of society
92.965	their first prime-time voice.
95.333	You have seven shows
95.333	in the top 10 at one time.
99.033	At one point,
100.286	you aggregate an audience
100.286	of 120 million people per week
103.647	watching your content.
104.897	That's more than the audience
104.897	for Super Bowl 50,
107.16	which happens once a year.
108.423	NL: Holy shit.
109.669	(Laughter)
111.466	(Applause)
113.712	EH: And we're not even
113.712	to the holy shit part.
116.095	(Laughter)
117.158	You land yourself
117.158	on Richard Nixon's enemies list --
119.909	he had one.
121.399	That's an applause line, too.
123.518	(Applause)
125.344	You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame
125.344	on the first day that it exists.
128.965	Then came the movies.
130.389	"""Fried Green Tomatoes,"""
131.993	"""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me,"""
134.042	"""This Is Spinal Tap."""
135.239	(Applause)
136.4	Again, just to name a fraction.
137.956	(Applause)
139.011	Then you wipe the slate clean,
140.541	start a third act as a political activist
140.541	focusing on protecting the First Amendment
144.612	and the separation of church and state.
146.586	You start People For The American Way.
148.5	You buy the Declaration of Independence
150.382	and give it back to the people.
151.897	You stay active in both
151.897	entertainment and politics
154.259	until the ripe old of age of 93,
155.815	when you write a book
157.085	and make a documentary
157.085	about your life story.
159.273	And after all that,
160.471	they finally think
160.471	you're ready for a TED Talk.
163.037	(Laughter)
164.842	(Applause)
169.438	NL: I love being here.
171.26	And I love you for agreeing to do this.
173.999	EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.
176.012	So here's my first question.
177.919	Was your mother proud of you?
179.657	(Laughter)
182.055	NL: My mother ...
183.412	what a place to start.
186.967	Let me put it this way --
189.142	when I came back from the war,
190.786	she showed me the letters
190.786	that I had written her from overseas,
196.398	and they were absolute love letters.
201.961	(Laughter)
203.564	This really sums up my mother.
205.73	They were love letters,
206.905	as if I had written them to --
209.131	they were love letters.
213.214	A year later I asked my mother
213.214	if I could have them,
217.771	because I'd like to keep them
217.771	all the years of my life ...
222.072	She had thrown them away.
223.605	(Laughter)
228.89	That's my mother.
230.218	(Laughter)
232.72	The best way I can sum it up
232.72	in more recent times is --
239.264	this is also more recent times --
241.585	a number of years ago,
242.791	when they started the Hall of Fame
242.791	to which you referred.
246.688	It was a Sunday morning,
248.495	when I got a call from the fellow who ran
248.495	the TV Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.
253.773	He was calling me to tell me
253.773	they had met all day yesterday
256.766	and he was confidentially telling me
256.766	they were going to start a hall of fame
261.003	and these were the inductees.
267.201	"I started to say ""Richard Nixon,"""
269.147	because Richard Nixon --
270.813	EH: I don't think he was on their list.
272.708	NL: William Paley, who started CBS,
275.255	David Sarnoff, who started NBC,
278.913	Edward R. Murrow,
280.092	the greatest of the foreign
280.092	correspondents,
283.818	Paddy Chayefsky --
285.013	I think the best writer
285.013	that ever came out of television --
287.799	Milton Berle, Lucille Ball
289.8	and me.
291.205	EH: Not bad.
292.38	NL: I call my mother
292.38	immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.
295.119	"""Mom, this is what's happened,"
296.666	"they're starting a hall of fame."""
298.289	I tell her the list of names and me,
300.036	and she says,
301.218	"""Listen, if that's what they"
301.218	"want to do, who am I to say?"""
303.979	(Laughter)
307.504	(Applause)
310.444	That's my Ma.
311.825	I think it earns that kind of a laugh
313.729	because everybody
313.729	has a piece of that mother.
315.849	(Laughter)
317.047	EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother
317.047	is born, right there.
320.348	So your father also played
320.348	a large role in your life,
325.182	mostly by his absence.
326.856	NL: Yeah.
328.037	EH: Tell us what happened
328.037	when you were nine years old.
330.684	NL: He was flying to Oklahoma
335.587	with three guys that my mother said,
337.682	"""I don't want you to have"
337.682	anything to do with them,
340.088	"I don't trust those men."""
342.04	That's when I heard,
343.414	maybe not for the first time,
344.921	"""Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."""
348.611	And he went.
350.112	It turns out he was picking up
350.112	some fake bonds,
355.153	which he was flying
355.153	across the country to sell.
359.764	But the fact that he was going
359.764	to Oklahoma in a plane,
363.335	and he was going to bring me
363.335	back a 10-gallon hat,
367.05	just like Ken Maynard,
367.05	my favorite cowboy wore.
374.124	You know, this was a few years
374.124	after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.
379.236	I mean, it was exotic
379.236	that my father was going there.
382.857	But when he came back,
384.122	they arrested him as he got off the plane.
386.553	That night newspapers
386.553	were all over the house,
390.973	my father was with his hat
390.973	in front of his face,
393.617	manacled to a detective.
395.72	And my mother was selling the furniture,
395.72	because we were leaving --
399.402	she didn't want to stay
399.402	in that state of shame,
403.235	in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
406.528	And selling the furniture --
410.216	the house was loaded with people.
412.712	And in the middle of all of that,
414.854	some strange horse's ass
414.854	put his hand on my shoulder and said,
421.066	"""Well, you're the man of the house now."""
424.982	I'm crying, and this asshole says,
424.982	"""You're the man of the house now."""
431.268	And I think that was the moment
434.226	I began to understand the foolishness
434.226	of the human condition.
439.678	So ...
442.558	it took a lot of years to look back at it
442.558	and feel it was a benefit.
448.437	But --
449.611	EH: It's interesting
449.611	you call it a benefit.
451.903	NL: Benefit in that it gave
451.903	me that springboard.
454.358	I mean that I could think
458.162	how foolish it was to say
458.162	to this crying nine-year-old boy,
461.374	"""You're the man of the house now."""
463.303	And then I was crying, and then he said,
466.74	"""And men of the house don't cry."""
469.755	And I ...
471.319	(Laughter)
472.628	So ...
476.413	I look back, and I think
477.944	that's when I learned the foolishness
477.944	of the human condition,
482.111	and it's been that gift that I've used.
486.015	EH: So you have a father who's absent,
488.567	you have a mother for whom
488.567	apparently nothing is good enough.
491.87	Do you think that starting out as a kid
491.87	who maybe never felt heard
497.156	started you down a journey
498.702	that ended with you being an adult
500.504	with a weekly audience
500.504	of 120 million people?
503.869	NL: I love the way you put that question,
506.903	because I guess
506.903	I've spent my life wanting --
510.746	if anything, wanting to be heard.
516.898	I think --
520.524	It's a simple answer, yes,
522.12	that was what sparked --
525.857	well, there were other things, too.
527.588	When my father was away,
530.443	I was fooling with a crystal radio set
530.443	that we had made together,
536.509	and I caught a signal that turned out
536.509	to be Father Coughlin.
541.684	(Laughter)
544.77	Yeah, somebody laughed.
546.136	(Laughter)
547.587	But not funny,
549.042	this was a horse's --
550.566	another horse's ass --
552.206	who was very vocal
552.206	about hating the New Deal
554.821	and Roosevelt and Jews.
558.256	The first time I ran into an understanding
561.613	that there were people
561.613	in this world that hated me
564.53	because I was born to Jewish parents.
567.291	And that had an enormous
567.291	effect on my life.
572.059	EH: So you had a childhood
574.066	with little in the way
574.066	of strong male role models,
577.172	except for your grandfather.
579.272	Tell us about him.
581.176	NL: Oh, my grandfather.
583.323	Well here's the way I always
583.323	talked about that grandfather.
589.606	There were parades,
590.78	lots of parades when I was a kid.
592.685	There were parades on Veteran's Day --
594.621	there wasn't a President's Day.
596.213	There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,
598.15	George Washington's birthday
600.278	and Flag Day ...
603.821	And lots of little parades.
605.604	My grandfather used to take me
607.057	and we'd stand on the street corner,
608.807	he'd hold my hand,
610.167	and I'd look up and I'd see a tear
610.167	running down his eye.
615.91	And he meant a great deal to me.
618.298	And he used to write presidents
618.298	of the United States.
623.68	Every letter started,
625.324	"""My dearest, darling Mr. President,"""
628.427	and he'd tell him something
628.427	wonderful about what he did.
633.069	But when he disagreed
633.069	with the President, he also wrote,
636.025	"""My dearest, darling Mr. President,"
637.716	"Didn't I tell you last week ...?"""
639.534	(Laughter)
641.559	And I would run down the stairs
641.559	every now and then
646.763	and pick up the mail.
648.019	We were three flights up,
652.945	And I'd pick up a little white envelope
652.945	"reading, ""Shya C. called at this address."""
662.734	And that's the story I have told
662.734	about my grandfather --
667.294	EH: They wrote him back
667.294	on the envelopes --
669.339	NL: They wrote back.
672.862	But I have shown them myself,
677.292	going way back to Phil Donahue
677.292	and others before him,
682.434	literally dozens of interviews
682.434	in which I told that story.
688.283	This will be the second time I have said
688.283	the whole story was a lie.
696.151	The truth was my grandfather
696.151	took me to parades,
700.367	we had lots of those.
702.094	The truth is a tear came down his eye.
705.34	The truth is he would write
705.34	an occasional letter,
709.071	and I did pick up those little envelopes.
712.536	"But ""My dearest darling Mr. President,"""
715.972	all the rest of it,
718.458	is a story I borrowed from a good friend
722.998	whose grandfather was that grandfather
722.998	who wrote those letters.
730.506	And, I mean, I stole
730.506	Arthur Marshall's grandfather
736.975	and made him my own.
740.997	Always.
742.171	When I started to write my memoir --
744.809	"""Even this --"""
746.285	How about that?
747.474	"""Even This I Get to Experience."""
750.848	When I started to write the memoir
752.623	and I started to think about it,
754.206	and then I --
756.275	I --
758.529	I did a reasonable amount of crying,
762.355	and I realized how much
762.355	I needed the father.
767.139	So much so that I appropriated
767.139	Arthur Marshall's grandfather.
771.575	"So much so, the word ""father"" --"
774.573	I have six kids by the way.
777.273	My favorite role in life.
781.482	It and husband to my wife Lyn.
787.972	But I stole the man's identity
787.972	because I needed the father.
793.243	Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit
796.95	and come out on the other side,
798.981	and I forgive my father --
800.592	the best thing I --
801.826	the worst thing I --
803.711	The word I'd like to use about him
803.711	and think about him is --
806.819	he was a rascal.
809.02	The fact that he lied
809.02	and stole and cheated
813.957	and went to prison ...
817.349	"I submerge that in the word ""rascal."""
821.809	EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs
821.809	borrow and professionals steal.
828.366	NL: I'm a pro.
829.615	EH: You're a pro.
830.79	(Laughter)
832.13	And that quote is widely
832.13	attributed to John Lennon,
835.301	but it turns out
835.301	he stole it from T.S. Eliot.
837.515	So you're in good company.
838.928	(Laughter)
842.602	EH: I want to talk about your work.
844.951	Obviously the impact of your work
844.951	has been written about
847.681	and I'm sure you've heard
847.681	about it all your life:
850.071	what it meant to people,
851.246	what it meant to our culture,
852.7	you heard the applause when I just
852.7	named the names of the shows,
855.725	you raised half the people
855.725	in the room through your work.
859.177	But have there ever been any stories
859.177	about the impact of your work
862.736	that surprised you?
864.74	NL: Oh, god --
866.387	surprised me and delighted me
866.387	from head to toe.
873.437	"There was ""An Evening with Norman Lear"""
873.437	within the last year
878.954	that a group of hip-hop impresarios,
882.482	performers and the Academy put together.
887.902	"The subtext of ""An Evening with ..."""
889.83	was: What do a 92-year-old Jew --
893.943	then 92 --
895.118	and the world of hip-hop have in common?
897.155	Russell Simmons
897.155	was among seven on the stage.
900.783	And when he talked about the shows,
905.128	he wasn't talking about the Hollywood,
909.685	"George Jefferson in ""The Jeffersons,"""
913.433	or the show that was a number five show.
916.847	He was talking about a simple
916.847	thing that made a big --
925.324	EH: Impact on him?
926.549	NL: An impact on him --
928.511	"I was hesitating over the word, ""change."""
931.43	It's hard for me to imagine,
934.017	you know, changing somebody's life,
935.869	but that's the way he put it.
937.678	He saw George Jefferson
937.678	"write a check on ""The Jeffersons,"""
943.791	and he never knew that a black man
943.791	could write a check.
948.788	And he says it just
948.788	impacted his life so --
953.765	it changed his life.
955.474	And when I hear things like that --
958.972	little things --
960.671	because I know that there isn't
960.671	anybody in this audience
963.877	that wasn't likely responsible today for
963.877	some little thing they did for somebody,
970.404	whether it's as little as a smile
970.404	"or an unexpected ""Hello,"""
975.77	that's how little this thing was.
978.833	It could have been the dresser of the set
983.128	who put the checkbook on the thing,
984.838	and George had nothing to do
984.838	while he was speaking, so he wrote it,
988.551	I don't know.
989.851	But --
991.634	EH: So in addition to the long list
991.634	I shared in the beginning,
994.596	I should have also mentioned
994.596	that you invented hip-hop.
997.266	(Laughter)
998.391	NL: Well ...
1000.755	EH: I want to talk about --
1002.264	NL: Well, then do it.
1003.588	(Laughter)
1009.706	EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,
1012.492	but you've also built a life of meaning.
1014.809	And all of us strive to do
1014.809	both of those things --
1017.405	not all of us manage to.
1019.984	But even those of us who do manage
1019.984	to accomplish both of those,
1023.779	very rarely do we figure out
1023.779	how to do them together.
1026.884	You managed to push culture
1026.884	forward through your art
1031.788	while also achieving world-beating
1031.788	commercial success.
1035.67	How did you do both?
1043.391	NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear
1043.391	that recitation of all I accomplished.
1051.304	This planet is one of a billion,
1055.384	they tell us,
1056.875	in a universe
1056.875	of which there are billions --
1062.717	billions of universes,
1064.309	billions of planets ...
1067.94	which we're trying to save
1069.847	and it requires saving.
1073.549	But ...
1075.699	anything I may have accomplished is --
1079.77	my sister once asked me
1079.77	what she does about something
1083.833	that was going on
1083.833	in Newington, Connecticut.
1086.799	"And I said, ""Write your alderman"
1086.799	"or your mayor or something."""
1089.748	"She said, ""Well I'm not"
1089.748	"Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."""
1093.819	And that was the first time
1093.819	I said what I'm saying,
1098.359	"I said, ""Claire. With everything"
1098.359	you think about what I may have done
1102.722	"and everything you've done,"" --"
1104.223	she never left Newington --
1106.59	"""can you get your fingers close enough"
1108.424	when you consider the size
1108.424	of the planet and so forth,
1112.365	to measure anything I may have done
1112.365	"to anything you may have done?"""
1116.15	So ...
1118.486	I am convinced we're all responsible
1122.098	for doing as much
1122.098	as I may have accomplished.
1127.269	And I understand what you're saying --
1129.183	EH: It's an articulate deflection --
1130.922	NL: But you have to really buy into
1130.922	the size and scope
1134.904	of the creator's enterprise, here.
1136.882	EH: But here on this planet
1136.882	you have really mattered.
1139.49	NL: I'm a son of a gun.
1140.981	(Laughter)
1142.526	EH: So I have one more question for you.
1146.348	How old do you feel?
1149.411	NL: I am the peer
1149.411	of whoever I'm talking to.
1154.704	EH: Well, I feel 93.
1156.1	(Applause)
1162.684	NL: We out of here?
1164.018	EH: Well, I feel 93 years old,
1165.926	but I hope to one day feel as young
1165.926	as the person I'm sitting across from.
1169.739	Ladies and gentlemen,
1170.913	the incomparable Norman Lear.
1172.361	(Applause)
1178.049	NL: Thank you.
1179.224	(Applause)
