13.48	I'm a textile artist
15.08	most widely known for starting
15.08	the yarn bombing movement.
18.08	Yarn bombing is when you take
18.08	knitted or crocheted material
21.04	out into the urban environment,
21.04	graffiti-style --
23.4	or, more specifically,
24.64	without permission and unsanctioned.
26.96	But when I started this over 10 years ago,
29.84	I didn't have a word for it,
31.4	I didn't have any
31.4	ambitious notions about it,
33.56	I had no visions of grandeur.
35.12	All I wanted to see was something
35.12	warm and fuzzy and human-like
39.52	on the cold, steel, gray facade
39.52	that I looked at everyday.
43.32	So I wrapped the door handle.
45.56	I call this the Alpha Piece.
47.96	Little did I know that this tiny piece
47.96	would change the course of my life.
52.04	So clearly the reaction was interesting.
54	It intrigued me and I thought,
54	"""What else could I do?"""
56.548	Could I do something in the public domain
56.548	that would get the same reaction?
60.76	So I wrapped the stop sign
60.76	pole near my house.
63.88	The reaction was wild.
65.32	People would park their cars
67.4	and get out of their cars and stare at it,
69.8	and scratch their heads and stare at it,
71.76	and take pictures of it
71.76	and take pictures next to it,
74.28	and all of that was really exciting to me
76.28	and I wanted to do every stop sign pole
76.28	in the neighborhood.
79.32	And the more that I did,
79.32	the stronger the reaction.
82.8	So at this point I'm smitten.
84.32	I'm hooked.
85.6	This was all seductive.
86.88	I found my new passion
88.64	and the urban environment
88.64	was my playground.
91.76	So this is some of my early work.
95.04	I was very curious about this idea
95.04	of enhancing the ordinary,
98.08	the mundane, even the ugly,
99.84	and not taking away its identity
99.84	or its functionality
103.52	but just giving it a well-tailored
103.52	suit out of knitting.
106.92	And this was fun for me.
108.68	It was really fun
108.68	to take inanimate objects
110.96	and have them come to life.
113.44	So ...
114.88	I think we all see the humor in this,
116.76	but --
118	(Laughter)
119.12	I was at a point where
119.12	I wanted to take it seriously.
121.84	I wanted to analyze it.
123.12	I wanted to know why I was letting
123.12	this take over my life,
125.88	why I was passionate about it,
127.36	why were other people
127.36	reacting so strongly to it.
129.92	And I realized something.
131.8	We all live in this
131.8	fast-paced, digital world,
134.72	but we still crave and desire
134.72	something that's relatable.
138.68	I think we've all become desensitized
141.44	by our overdeveloped
141.44	cities that we live in,
144.04	and billboards and advertisements,
146.84	and giant parking lots,
148.48	and we don't even complain
148.48	about that stuff anymore.
151.36	So when you stumble upon
152.64	a stop sign pole
152.64	that's wrapped in knitting
155	and it seems so out of place
156.72	and then gradually -- weirdly --
158.6	you find a connection to it,
160.44	that is the moment.
161.68	That is the moment I love
162.92	and that is the moment
162.92	I love to share with others.
166.28	So at this point, my curiosity grew.
169.44	It went from the fire hydrants
169.44	and the stop sign poles
172.24	to what else can I do with this material.
174.217	Can I do something big
174.217	and large-scale and insurmountable?
178.24	So that's when the bus happened.
183.24	This was a real game changer for me.
185.28	I'll always have a soft spot
185.28	in my heart for this one.
188.12	At this point, people
188.12	were recognizing my work
190.32	but there wasn't much out there
191.84	that was wrapped in knitting
191.84	that was large-scale,
194.24	and this definitely was the first
194.24	city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
197.52	So at this point, I'm experiencing,
199.28	or I'm witnessing something interesting.
201.36	I may have started yarn bombing
201.36	but I certainly don't own it anymore.
204.8	It had reached global status.
206.36	People from all over the world
206.36	were doing this.
208.575	And I know this because I would travel
208.575	to certain parts of the world
211.79	that I'd never been to,
212.981	and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole
212.981	and I knew I didn't wrap it.
216.139	So as I pursued
216.139	my own goals with my art --
220.28	this is a lot of my recent work --
223.16	so was yarn bombing.
224.4	Yarn bombing was also growing.
225.88	And that experience showed me
225.88	the hidden power of this craft
230.24	and showed me
232	that there was this common language
232	I had with the rest of the world.
237.36	It was through this granny hobby --
239.64	this unassuming hobby --
241.8	that I found commonality with people
244.72	that I never thought
244.72	I'd have a connection with.
248.28	So as I tell my story today,
250.92	I'd also like to convey to you
252.4	that hidden power can be found
252.4	in the most unassuming places,
255.84	and we all possess skills
255.84	that are just waiting to be discovered.
259.6	If you think about our hands,
259.6	these tools that are connected to us,
262.8	and what they're capable of doing --
265.2	building houses and furniture,
266.88	and painting giant murals --
268.48	and most of the time
268.48	we hold a controller or a cell phone.
272.16	And I'm totally guilty of this as well.
274.76	But if you think about it,
276.08	what would happen
276.08	if you put those things down?
278.32	What would you make?
278.32	What would you create with your own hands?
282.04	A lot of people think
282.04	that I am a master knitter
284.36	but I actually couldn't knit
284.36	a sweater to save my life.
287.44	But I did something
287.44	interesting with knitting
289.6	that had never been done before.
291.44	"I also wasn't ""supposed to be"" an artist"
293.92	in the sense that I wasn't
293.92	formally trained to do this --
297.36	I'm a math major actually.
299	So I didn't think
299	this was in the cards for me,
301.88	but I also know that I didn't
301.88	stumble upon this.
304.84	And when this happened to me,
304.84	I held on tight,
307.32	I fought for it and I'm proud to say
307.32	that I am a working artist today.
312.04	So as we ponder the future,
315.28	know that your future
315.28	might not be so seamless.
317.495	And one day, you might
317.495	be as bored as I was
320.52	and knit a door handle
320.52	to change your world forever.
323.92	Thank you.
325.16	(Applause)
