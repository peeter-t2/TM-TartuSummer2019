16.117	Hello, Doha. Hello!
18.915	Salaam alaikum.
21.72	I love coming to Doha.
21.72	It's such an international place.
26.09	It feels like the United Nations here.
29.642	You land at the airport,
29.642	and you're welcomed by an Indian lady
32.935	who takes you to Al Maha Services,
32.935	where you meet a Filipino lady
36.822	who hands you off to a South African lady
39.06	who then takes you to a Korean
40.807	who takes you to a Pakistani guy
40.807	with the luggage
43.628	who takes you to the car
43.628	with a Sri Lankan.
45.666	You go to the hotel and you check in.
45.666	There's a Lebanese.
48.5	Yeah? And then a Swedish guy
48.5	showed me my room.
51.704	"I said, ""Where are the Qataris?"""
53.55	(Laughter)
55.22	(Applause)
58.19	"They said, ""No, no, it's too hot."
58.19	"They come out later. They're smart."""
61.549	"""They know."""
62.724	(Laughter)
64.464	And of course, it's growing so fast,
64.464	sometimes there's growing pains.
68.277	You know, like sometimes
68.277	you run into people
70.579	that you think know the city well,
70.579	but they don't know it that well.
73.864	My Indian cab driver showed up at the W,
76.46	and I asked him to take me
76.46	to the Sheraton,
78.751	"and he said, ""No problem, sir."""
81.278	And then we sat there for two minutes.
83.365	"I said, ""What's wrong?"""
83.365	"He said, ""One problem, sir."""
85.893	(Laughter)
86.956	"I said, ""What?"" He goes, ""Where is it?"""
88.845	(Laughter)
91.282	"I go, ""You're the driver,"
91.282	"you should know."""
93.345	"He goes, ""No, I just arrived, sir."""
95.726	"I go, ""You just arrived at the W?"""
95.726	"""No, I just arrived in Doha, sir."""
98.989	(Laughter)
100.051	"""I was on my way home from the airport,"
101.972	"I got a job. I'm working already."""
103.623	(Laughter)
105.138	"He goes, ""Sir, why don't you drive?"""
107.302	(Laughter)
108.354	"""I don't know where we're going."""
109.958	"""Neither do I. It will be"
109.958	"an adventure, sir."""
112.086	(Laughter)
114.93	The Middle East has been
114.93	an adventure the past couple of years.
118.56	It is going crazy with the Arab Spring
118.56	and revolution and all this.
121.735	Are there any Lebanese
121.735	here tonight, by applause?
124.137	(Cheering)
125.17	Lebanese, yeah.
126.346	The Middle East is going crazy.
127.877	You know the Middle East is going crazy
129.822	when Lebanon is the most peaceful
129.822	place in the region.
132.535	(Laughter) (Applause)
135.123	Who would have thought?
136.543	(Laughter)
138.06	Oh my gosh.
140.208	No, there's serious issues in the region.
142.192	Some people don't want to talk about them.
142.192	I'm here to talk about them tonight.
145.938	Ladies and gentlemen of the Middle East,
145.938	here's a serious issue.
148.977	When we see each other, when we say hello,
151.311	how many kisses are we going to do?
153.084	(Laughter)
154.559	Every country is different
154.559	and it's confusing, okay?
157.06	In Lebanon, they do three.
158.89	In Egypt, they do two.
160.621	I was in Lebanon, I got used to three.
163.209	I went to Egypt. I went to say hello
163.209	to this one Egyptian guy,
166.529	I went, one, two. I went for three --
168.401	He wasn't into it.
169.629	(Laughter)
174.551	"I told him, I said, ""No, no,"
174.551	"I was just in Lebanon."""
177.027	"He goes, ""I don't care where you were."
177.027	"You just stay where you are, please."""
180.655	(Laughter) (Applause)
184.265	I went to Saudi Arabia.
185.642	In Saudi Arabia, they go one, two,
185.642	and then they stay on the same side:
189.07	three, four, five, six,
189.07	seven, eight, nine,
194.328	(Laughter)
197.019	Next time you see a Saudi, look closely.
198.965	They're just a little bit tilted.
200.659	(Laughter)
202.377	"""Abdul, are you okay?"""
203.575	"""I was saying hello"
203.575	"for half an hour. I'll be all right."""
206.267	(Laughter)
208.028	Qataris, you guys do the nose to nose.
211.478	Why is that? Are you too tired
211.478	to go all the way around?
214.327	(Laughter)
215.387	"""Habibi, it's so hot. Just come here"
215.387	for a second. Say hello.
218.507	Hello, Habibi. Just don't move.
218.507	Just stay there, please.
221.273	"I need to rest."""
222.523	(Laughter)
224.662	Iranians, sometimes we do two,
224.662	sometimes we do three.
228.774	A friend of mine explained to me,
228.774	before the '79 revolution, it was two.
232.237	(Laughter)
233.298	After the revolution, three.
235.284	So with Iranians, you can tell
235.284	whose side the person is on
238.033	based on the number
238.033	of kisses they give you.
240.141	Yeah, if you go one, two, three --
240.141	"""I can't believe you support this regime!"""
243.808	(Laughter)
244.833	"""With your three kisses."""
246.381	(Laughter)
249.073	But no, guys, really,
249.073	it is exciting to be here,
251.578	and like I said, you guys
251.578	are doing a lot culturally,
254.457	you know, and it's amazing,
256.152	and it helps change the image
256.152	of the Middle East in the West.
259.037	A lot of Americans don't know
259.037	a lot about us, about the Middle East.
262.581	I'm Iranian and American. I'm there.
262.581	I know, I've traveled here.
266.044	There's so much, we laugh, right?
267.78	People don't know we laugh.
269.167	When I did the Axis of Evil comedy tour,
269.167	it came out on Comedy Central,
272.532	I went online to see
272.532	what people were saying.
274.664	I ended up on a conservative website.
276.475	One guy wrote another guy. He said,
276.475	"""I never knew these people laughed."""
280.296	Think about it. You never see us laughing
280.296	in American film or television, right?
284.13	"Maybe like an evil laugh: ""Wuhahaha."""
286.748	(Laughter)
287.823	"""I will kill you in the name"
287.823	"of Allah, wuhahahahaha."""
290.95	(Laughter)
292.132	"But never like, ""Ha ha ha ha la."""
294.057	(Laughter)
295.808	We like to laugh.
295.808	We like to celebrate life.
298.495	And I wish more Americans
298.495	would travel here.
300.575	I always encourage my friends:
302.043	"""Travel, see the Middle East,"
303.517	there's so much to see,
303.517	"so many good people."""
305.683	And it's vice versa,
305.683	and it helps stop problems
307.957	of misunderstanding
307.957	and stereotypes from happening.
311.004	For example, I don't know
311.004	if you heard about this,
313.382	a little while ago in the US,
313.382	there was a Muslim family
316.04	walking down the aisle of an airplane,
318.055	talking about the safest place
318.055	to sit on the plane.
320.75	Some passengers overheard them,
322.331	somehow misconstrued that
322.331	as terrorist talk,
325.601	got them kicked off the plane.
327.417	It was a family, a mother, father, child,
327.417	talking about the seating.
330.727	As a Middle Eastern male,
332.007	I know there's certain things
332.007	I'm not supposed to say
334.777	on an airplane in the US, right?
336.49	I'm not supposed to be
336.49	walking down the aisle,
338.689	"and be like, ""Hi, Jack."" That's not cool."
340.721	(Laughter)
342.167	Even if I'm there with my friend
342.167	named Jack, I say,
344.62	"""Greetings, Jack. Salutations, Jack."""
347.104	"Never ""Hi, Jack."""
348.323	(Laughter)
351.24	But now, apparently we can't even talk
353.452	about the safest place
353.452	to sit on an airplane.
355.953	So my advice to all my Middle Eastern
355.953	friends and Muslim friends
359.062	and anyone who looks
359.062	Middle Eastern or Muslim,
361.373	so to, you know, Indians, and Latinos,
361.373	everyone, if you're brown --
364.895	(Laughter)
366.607	Here's my advice to my brown friends.
368.893	(Laughter)
369.97	The next time you're
369.97	on an airplane in the US,
372.363	just speak your mother tongue.
374.392	That way no one knows
374.392	what you're saying. Life goes on.
376.994	(Laughter)
378.04	Granted, some mother tongues
378.04	might sound a little threatening
380.973	to the average American.
382.159	If you're walking
382.159	down the aisle speaking Arabic,
384.492	you might freak them out --
385.878	(Imitating Arabic)
388.204	"They might say, ""What's he talking about?"""
390.283	The key, to my Arab brothers and sisters,
392.296	is to throw in random
392.296	good words to put people at ease
394.86	as you're walking down the aisle.
396.468	Just as you're walking down --
397.922	(Imitating Arabic)
399.291	Strawberry!
400.493	(Laughter)
407.676	(Imitating Arabic)
409.186	Rainbow!
410.361	(Laughter)
412.354	(Imitating Arabic)
413.635	Tutti Frutti!
414.81	(Laughter)
415.944	"""I think he's going to hijack"
415.944	"the plane with some ice cream."""
419.11	Thank you very much. Have a good night.
421.074	Thank you, TED.
422.249	(Cheers) (Applause)
