12.767	To be honest, by personality,
15.619	I'm just not much of a crier.
19.316	But I think in my career
19.316	that's been a good thing.
23.246	I'm a civil rights lawyer,
24.63	and I've seen some 
24.63	horrible things in the world.
29.034	I began my career working 
29.034	police abuse cases in the United States.
32.844	And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda
36.318	to be the director of the U.N.'s 
36.318	genocide investigation.
41.908	It turns out that tears 
41.908	just aren't much help
45.647	when you're trying 
45.647	to investigate a genocide.
49.176	The things I had to see, 
49.176	and feel and touch
54.037	were pretty unspeakable.
57.534	What I can tell you is this:
60.891	that the Rwandan genocide
62.988	was one of the world's
62.988	greatest failures of simple compassion.
69.711	That word, compassion, actually 
69.711	comes from two Latin words:
73.12	cum passio, which simply mean 
73.12	"""to suffer with."""
78.642	And the things that I saw and experienced
82.204	in Rwanda as I got up close
82.204	to human suffering,
84.79	it did, in moments, move me to tears.
88.129	But I just wish that I, 
88.129	and the rest of the world,
90.855	had been moved earlier.
93.37	And not just to tears,
95.034	but to actually stop the genocide.
98.834	Now by contrast, I've also been involved
101.292	with one of the world's greatest
101.292	successes of compassion.
107.125	And that's the fight against 
107.125	global poverty.
110.071	It's a cause that probably
110.071	has involved all of us here.
112.854	I don't know if your first introduction
114.852	might have been choruses of
114.852	"""We Are the World,"""
118.217	or maybe the picture of a sponsored child
118.217	on your refrigerator door,
122.28	or maybe the birthday you
122.28	donated for fresh water.
126.367	I don't really remember what my first
126.367	introduction to poverty was
129.581	but I do remember the most jarring.
133.145	It was when I met Venus --
135.307	she's a mom from Zambia.
138.029	She's got three kids and she's a widow.
141.655	When I met her, she had walked
141.655	about 12 miles
145.022	in the only garments she owned,
147.695	to come to the capital city
147.695	and to share her story.
151.957	She sat down with me for hours,
155.572	just ushered me in to 
155.572	the world of poverty.
160.097	She described what it was like 
160.097	when the coals on the cooking fire
163.238	finally just went completely cold.
166.967	When that last drop 
166.967	of cooking oil finally ran out.
171.729	When the last of the food, 
171.729	despite her best efforts,
175.585	ran out.
178.113	She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,
181.096	suffer from malnutrition,
183.878	as his legs just slowly bowed 
183.878	into uselessness.
187.954	As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.
191.302	And then as Peter finally grew cold.
198.13	For over 50 years, stories like this
198.13	have been moving us to compassion.
203.811	We whose kids have plenty to eat.
206.661	And we're moved not only 
206.661	to care about global poverty,
209.33	but to actually try to do our part 
209.33	to stop the suffering.
214.02	Now there's plenty of room for critique 
214.02	that we haven't done enough,
217.493	and what it is that we've done
217.493	hasn't been effective enough,
221.715	but the truth is this:
224.845	The fight against global poverty
224.845	is probably the broadest,
228.396	longest running manifestation of the 
228.396	human phenomenon of compassion
233.531	in the history of our species.
236.673	And so I'd like to share
236.673	a pretty shattering insight
240.322	that might forever change the way
240.322	you think about that struggle.
244.615	But first, let me begin with what
244.615	you probably already know.
247.438	Thirty-five years ago, when I would have
247.438	been graduating from high school,
250.92	they told us that 40,000 kids every day
250.92	died because of poverty.
257.297	That number, today, is now 
257.297	down to 17,000.
261.669	Way too many, of course,
263.675	but it does mean that every year,
266.352	there's eight million kids who
266.352	don't have to die from poverty.
271.65	Moreover, the number of 
271.65	people in our world
274.067	who are living in extreme poverty,
276.23	which is defined as living off
276.23	about a dollar and a quarter a day,
279.567	that has fallen from 50 percent,
283.179	to only 15 percent.
287.403	This is massive progress,
288.853	and this exceeds everybody's 
288.853	expectations about what is possible.
294.258	And I think you and I,
297.123	I think, honestly, that we can 
297.123	feel proud and encouraged
301.399	to see the way that compassion 
301.399	actually has the power
305.284	to succeed in stopping 
305.284	the suffering of millions.
310.476	But here's the part that you 
310.476	might not hear very much about.
314.852	If you move that poverty mark just
314.852	up to two dollars a day,
319.586	it turns out that virtually 
319.586	the same two billion people
322.585	who were stuck in that harsh poverty
322.585	when I was in high school,
326.397	are still stuck there,
330.667	So why, why are so many billions
330.667	still stuck in such harsh poverty?
336.396	Well, let's think about
336.396	Venus for a moment.
339.351	Now for decades, my wife and I have been
339.351	moved by common compassion
343.123	to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,
345.952	to support generous levels of foreign aid.
349.471	But until I had actually talked to Venus,
352.563	I would have had no idea that 
352.563	none of those approaches
355.2	actually addressed why she had
355.2	to watch her son die.
361.806	"""We were doing fine,"" Venus told me,"
366.243	"""until Brutus started to cause trouble."""
370.785	Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor 
370.785	"and ""cause trouble"""
373.755	is what happened the day after
373.755	Venus' husband died,
377.281	when Brutus just came and threw
377.281	Venus and the kids out of the house,
381.213	stole all their land, and robbed
381.213	their market stall.
386.385	You see, Venus was thrown 
386.385	into destitution by violence.
392.882	And then it occurred to me, of course,
394.891	that none of my child sponsorships,
394.891	none of the microloans,
398.69	none of the traditional 
398.69	anti-poverty programs
402.552	were going to stop Brutus,
406.518	because they weren't meant to.
409.872	This became even more clear
409.872	to me when I met Griselda.
414.878	She's a marvelous young girl
414.878	living in a very poor community
419.097	in Guatemala.
420.913	And one of the things
420.913	we've learned over the years
423.31	is that perhaps the most powerful thing
425.881	that Griselda and her family can do
428.725	to get Griselda and her family 
428.725	out of poverty
431.39	is to make sure that she goes to school.
434.514	The experts call this the Girl Effect.
439.239	But when we met Griselda, 
439.239	she wasn't going to school.
443.321	In fact, she was rarely ever 
443.321	leaving her home.
448.388	Days before we met her,
450.173	while she was walking home
450.173	from church with her family,
452.818	in broad daylight,
455.133	men from her community 
455.133	just snatched her off the street,
458.61	and violently raped her.
461.708	See, Griselda had every
461.708	opportunity to go to school,
466.205	it just wasn't safe for her to get there.
469.626	And Griselda's not the only one.
472.466	Around the world, poor women and girls
475.19	between the ages of 15 and 44,
480.301	they are -- when victims of 
480.301	the everyday violence
484.386	of domestic abuse and sexual violence --
487.872	those two forms of violence account
487.872	for more death and disability
492.684	than malaria, than car accidents,
492.684	than war combined.
503.298	The truth is, the poor of our world
503.298	are trapped in whole systems of violence.
508.075	In South Asia, for instance,
508.075	I could drive past this rice mill
512.108	and see this man hoisting 
512.108	these 100-pound sacks
515.045	of rice upon his thin back.
517.089	But I would have no idea, until later,
518.907	that he was actually a slave,
521.349	held by violence in that rice mill
521.349	since I was in high school.
526.828	Decades of anti-poverty programs
526.828	right in his community
530.239	were never able to rescue him
530.239	or any of the hundred other slaves
534.321	from the beatings and the rapes
534.321	and the torture
537.957	of violence inside the rice mill.
541.652	In fact, half a century of 
541.652	anti-poverty programs
546.032	have left more poor people in slavery
549.706	than in any other time in human history.
553.071	Experts tell us that there's about
559.05	That's about the population 
559.05	of the entire nation of Canada,
562.711	where we're sitting today.
566.179	This is why, over time, I have come
566.179	to call this epidemic of violence
569.483	the Locust Effect.
571.772	Because in the lives of the poor,
571.772	it just descends like a plague
574.783	and it destroys everything.
577.571	In fact, now when you survey
577.571	very, very poor communities,
581.954	residents will tell you that their
581.954	greatest fear is violence.
586.038	But notice the violence that they fear
588.607	is not the violence of 
588.607	genocide or the wars,
591.785	it's everyday violence.
594.14	So for me, as a lawyer, of course,
594.14	my first reaction was to think,
597.353	well, of course we've
597.353	got to change all the laws.
599.667	We've got to make all this violence
599.667	against the poor illegal.
603.167	But then I found out, it already is.
606.902	The problem is not that 
606.902	the poor don't get laws,
609.742	it's that they don't get law enforcement.
614.542	In the developing world,
616.185	basic law enforcement systems
616.185	are so broken
619.25	that recently the U.N. issued 
619.25	a report that found
622.416	"that ""most poor people live"
622.416	"outside the protection of the law."""
628.02	Now honestly, you and I have 
628.02	just about no idea
630.412	of what that would mean
632.009	because we have no 
632.009	first-hand experience of it.
635.688	Functioning law enforcement for us 
635.688	is just a total assumption.
638.765	In fact, nothing expresses that assumption
638.765	more clearly than three simple numbers:
643.137	9-1-1,
645.598	which, of course, is the number
645.598	for the emergency police operator
648.765	here in Canada and in the United States,
652.066	where the average response time 
652.066	to a police 911 emergency call
656.147	is about 10 minutes.
657.81	So we take this just 
657.81	completely for granted.
660.995	But what if there was no 
660.995	law enforcement to protect you?
666.582	A woman in Oregon recently
666.582	experienced what this would be like.
671.204	She was home alone in her 
671.204	dark house on a Saturday night,
675.545	when a man started to tear 
675.545	his way into her home.
678.51	This was her worst nightmare,
680.467	because this man had actually put her
680.467	in the hospital from an assault
685.075	just two weeks before.
687.193	So terrified, she picks up that phone
687.193	and does what any of us would do:
690.551	She calls 911 --
693.196	but only to learn that because 
693.196	of budget cuts in her county,
698.028	law enforcement wasn't available 
698.028	on the weekends.
701.397	Listen.
702.187	Dispatcher: I don't have anybody 
702.187	to send out there.
705.006	Woman: OK
706.023	Dispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes
706.023	inside the residence and assaults you,
710.126	can you ask him to go away?
711.799	Or do you know if
711.799	he is intoxicated or anything?
714.042	Woman: I've already asked him.
714.042	I've already told him I was calling you.
717.415	He's broken in before,
717.415	busted down my door, assaulted me.
720.088	Dispatcher: Uh-huh.
721.033	Woman: Um, yeah, so ...
722.186	Dispatcher: Is there any way you could
722.186	safely leave the residence?
725.405	Woman: No, I can't, because he's blocking
725.405	pretty much my only way out.
728.822	Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do 
728.822	is give you some advice,
731.968	and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.
734.684	Obviously, if he comes in and
734.684	unfortunately has a weapon
739.496	or is trying to cause you physical harm,
739.496	that's a different story.
742.822	You know, the sheriff's office
742.822	doesn't work up there.
745.489	"I don't have anybody to send."""
749.735	Gary Haugen: Tragically, the woman 
749.735	inside that house
752.388	was violently assaulted, choked and raped
758.327	because this is what it means to live
758.327	outside the rule of law.
765.841	And this is where billions
765.841	of our poorest live.
772.015	What does that look like?
774.443	In Bolivia, for example, if a man 
774.443	sexually assaults a poor child,
778.871	statistically, he's at greater risk
778.871	of slipping in the shower and dying
783.544	than he is of ever going 
783.544	to jail for that crime.
788.002	In South Asia, if you 
788.002	enslave a poor person,
792.687	you're at greater risk of being 
792.687	struck by lightning
795.61	than ever being sent 
795.61	to jail for that crime.
798.66	And so the epidemic of everyday 
798.66	violence, it just rages on.
803.639	And it devastates our efforts to try
803.639	to help billions of people
807.738	out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.
811.315	Because the data just doesn't lie.
813.817	It turns out that you can give 
813.817	all manner of goods and services
816.876	to the poor,
818.029	but if you don't restrain the hands 
818.029	of the violent bullies
821.155	from taking it all away,
822.99	you're going to be very disappointed
822.99	in the long-term impact of your efforts.
827.889	So you would think that the disintegration
827.889	of basic law enforcement
831.66	in the developing world
831.66	would be a huge priority
834.675	for the global fight against poverty.
837.915	But it's not.
841.028	Auditors of international assistance
841.028	recently couldn't find
844.825	even one percent of aid going 
844.825	to protect the poor
848.659	from the lawless chaos 
848.659	of everyday violence.
852.99	And honestly, when we do talk about 
852.99	violence against the poor,
856.296	sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.
859.805	A fresh water organization tells
859.805	a heart-wrenching story
862.888	of girls who are raped on the way
862.888	to fetching water,
866.48	and then celebrates
866.48	the solution of a new well
870.29	that drastically shortens their walk.
873.745	End of story.
876.863	But not a word about the rapists who
876.863	are still right there in the community.
883.813	If a young woman on one 
883.813	of our college campuses
886.127	was raped on her walk to the library, 
889.273	we would never celebrate the solution
889.273	of moving the library closer to the dorm.
895.121	And yet, for some reason,
895.121	this is okay for poor people.
900.915	Now the truth is, the traditional experts
903.469	in economic development
903.469	and poverty alleviation,
905.775	they don't know how to fix this problem.
908.035	And so what happens?
909.856	They don't talk about it.
913.237	But the more fundamental reason
917.408	that law enforcement for the poor
917.408	in the developing world
920.188	is so neglected,
922.072	is because the people inside
922.072	the developing world, with money,
925.957	don't need it.
929.165	I was at the World Economic 
929.165	Forum not long ago
931.745	talking to corporate executives who have
931.745	massive businesses in the developing world
935.689	and I was just asking them,
937.771	"""How do you guys protect all your people"
937.771	"and property from all the violence?"""
943.325	And they looked at each other, 
943.325	and they said, practically in unison,
948.147	"""We buy it."""
951.474	Indeed, private security forces 
951.474	in the developing world
955.336	are now, four, five and seven times
955.336	larger than the public police force.
962.146	In Africa, the largest employer 
962.146	on the continent now is private security.
970.884	But see, the rich can pay for safety
970.884	and can keep getting richer,
974.702	but the poor can't pay for it
974.702	and they're left totally unprotected
978.504	and they keep getting thrown
978.504	to the ground.
982.464	This is a massive and scandalous outrage.
986.896	And it doesn't have to be this way.
989.849	Broken law enforcement can be fixed.
992.416	Violence can be stopped.
994.496	Almost all criminal justice systems,
996.888	they start out broken and corrupt,
999.417	but they can be transformed
999.417	by fierce effort and commitment.
1003.687	The path forward is really pretty clear.
1005.93	Number one: We have to start making
1009.377	stopping violence indispensable 
1009.377	to the fight against poverty.
1013.144	In fact, any conversation
1013.144	about global poverty
1015.578	that doesn't include the problem 
1015.578	of violence must be deemed not serious.
1021.416	And secondly, we have to begin 
1021.416	to seriously invest resources
1025.792	and share expertise to support 
1025.792	the developing world
1029.729	as they fashion new, 
1029.729	public systems of justice,
1033.086	not private security,
1034.652	that give everybody a chance to be safe.
1038.349	These transformations 
1038.349	are actually possible
1041.031	and they're happening today.
1043.64	Recently, the Gates Foundation 
1043.64	funded a project
1046.778	in the second largest city 
1046.778	of the Philippines,
1049.254	where local advocates
1049.254	and local law enforcement
1052.26	were able to transform corrupt police
1052.26	and broken courts so drastically,
1059.118	that in just four short years,
1061.705	they were able to measurably reduce
1064.177	the commercial sexual violence 
1064.177	against poor kids by 79 percent.
1071.758	You know, from the hindsight of history,
1075.302	what's always most inexplicable
1075.302	and inexcusable
1080.859	are the simple failures of compassion.
1085.48	Because I think history convenes 
1085.48	a tribunal of our grandchildren
1090.208	and they just ask us,
1091.969	"""Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?"
1096.211	Where were you, Grandpa, when 
1096.211	the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany
1099.766	and were being rejected from our shores?
1101.695	Where were you?
1103.823	And Grandma, where were you
1103.823	when they were marching
1106.223	our Japanese-American neighbors
1106.223	off to internment camps?
1110.276	And Grandpa, where were you 
1110.276	when they were beating
1112.665	our African-American neighbors
1114.938	just because they were trying
1114.938	"to register to vote?"""
1118.458	Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,
1122.702	"""Grandma, Grandpa, where were you"
1125.143	when two billion of the world's poorest
1125.143	were drowning in a lawless chaos
1129.636	"of everyday violence?"""
1133.287	I hope we can say that we had compassion,
1133.287	that we raised our voice,
1139.852	and as a generation, we were moved
1139.852	to make the violence stop.
1147.684	Thank you very much.
1150.141	(Applause)
1165.89	Chris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.
1168.785	Talk to us a bit about
1168.785	some of the things
1171.064	that have actually been happening to,
1171.064	for example, boost police training.
1177.588	How hard a process is that?
1179.427	GH: Well, one of the glorious 
1179.427	things that's starting to happen now
1183.009	is that the collapse of these systems
1183.009	and the consequences are becoming obvious.
1187.619	There's actually, now, 
1187.619	political will to do that.
1190.981	But it just requires now an investment
1190.981	of resources and transfer of expertise.
1195.106	There's a political will struggle 
1195.106	that's going to take place as well,
1198.509	but those are winnable fights,
1200.324	because we've done some examples
1200.324	around the world
1202.623	at International Justice Mission
1202.623	that are very encouraging.
1205.732	CA: So just tell us in one country,
1205.732	how much it costs
1209.233	to make a material difference 
1209.233	to police, for example --
1212.748	I know that's only one piece of it.
1214.538	GH: In Guatemala, for instance,
1214.538	we've started a project there
1217.754	with the local police 
1217.754	and court system, prosecutors,
1221.006	to retrain them so that they can 
1221.006	actually effectively bring these cases.
1224.819	And we've seen prosecutions against
1224.819	perpetrators of sexual violence
1229.131	increase by more than 1,000 percent.
1231.967	This project has been very modestly funded
1231.967	at about a million dollars a year,
1236.356	and the kind of bang 
1236.356	you can get for your buck
1238.662	in terms of leveraging
1238.662	a criminal justice system
1242.838	that could function if it were properly
1242.838	trained and motivated and led,
1247.595	and these countries, 
1247.595	especially a middle class
1250.138	that is seeing that there's 
1250.138	really no future
1253.282	with this total instability and
1253.282	total privatization of security
1257.15	I think there's an opportunity,
1257.15	a window for change.
1260.341	CA: But to make this happen, you have
1260.341	to look at each part in the chain --
1265.421	the police, who else?
1267.676	GH: So that's the thing 
1267.676	about law enforcement,
1269.957	it starts out with the police,
1271.4	they're the front end
1271.4	of the pipeline of justice,
1274.083	but they hand if off to the prosecutors,
1276.03	and the prosecutors 
1276.03	hand it off to the courts,
1278.265	and the survivors of violence 
1278.265	have to be supported by social services
1281.557	all the way through that.
1282.863	So you have to do an approach 
1282.863	that pulls that all together.
1285.675	In the past, there's been a little bit
1285.675	of training of the courts,
1288.726	but they get crappy evidence 
1288.726	from the police,
1290.9	or a little police intervention 
1290.9	that has to do with narcotics or terrorism
1294.537	but nothing to do with treating
1294.537	the common poor person
1297.405	with excellent law enforcement,
1298.924	so it's about pulling that all together,
1300.949	and you can actually have people
1300.949	in very poor communities
1304.091	experience law enforcement like us,
1306.274	which is imperfect in our 
1306.274	own experience, for sure,
1309.096	but boy, is it a great thing to sense
1309.096	that you can call 911
1312.228	and maybe someone will protect you.
1315.264	CA: Gary, I think you've done 
1315.264	a spectacular job
1317.537	of bringing this to the world's attention
1319.664	in your book and right here today.
1321.411	Thanks so much.
1322.505	Gary Haugen.
1323.281	(Applause)
