12.486	Last year, I got a chance to watch
12.486	"the new ""Star Wars"" movie,"
15.408	which was fantastic,
16.587	but one thing kept bugging me.
18.048	I don't know if you noticed this or not.
20.004	In this entirely technically
20.004	advanced world,
22.108	I did not see a single AED anywhere,
24.294	which was totally shocking --
25.726	almost as shocking
25.726	as not knowing what an AED is,
28.071	which you guys do know.
29.488	But for those at home,
30.663	an AED is an automated
30.663	external defibrillator.
33.709	It's the device you use
33.709	when your heart goes into cardiac arrest
36.791	to shock it back into a normal rhythm,
38.795	or, as one of the guys I was teaching
38.795	a class to referred to it as:
42.298	"""The shocky-hearty-box thing."""
43.872	(Laughter)
45.553	But I really can't blame the Empire,
48.088	since health and safety regulations
49.78	aren't really their first
49.78	order of business.
51.95	Though, even if we --
54.088	I think worse than not having an AED
54.088	would be if there was one there,
57.951	but just, no one knew where to find it.
60.023	These devices can drastically increase
60.023	your chance of survival --
63.837	almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.
66.471	(Laughter)
67.517	But I'm pretty sure
67.517	that stormtrooper is going to be toast,
70.719	regardless if we have an AED or not,
72.928	since what happens is the chest plate
72.928	is going to be quite hard to get off,
76.669	and like that tauntaun,
78.683	the AED has a very short window of time
78.683	at which it's highly effective.
82.119	In this case -- basically, we've got
82.119	to use it within the first 10 minutes.
86.531	The Jedi, on the other hand,
86.531	have no problems with their outfits.
89.657	Those robes open straight up,
91.413	you can place the pads
91.413	right onto the chest --
93.947	so upper-right-hand side of the chest,
95.849	lower left,
97.032	wait for the unit to determine
97.032	if it's a shockable rhythm
100.204	and get ready to shock.
101.746	But, the Jedi do have a problem.
103.295	They have a head appendage issue.
104.961	And so I can be totally clear,
104.961	thinking I'm ready to go,
108.18	but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle
110.454	and inadvertently shocking myself.
112.389	(Laughter)
113.833	So before you hit that button,
113.833	make sure you are clear
118.395	and everyone else is clear.
120.29	Going back to that stormtrooper:
122.791	If I did get that chest plate off in time,
125.213	what would you do if you suddenly found
125.213	there was a Wookiee under there,
129.067	or possibly two Ewoks?
131.599	(Laughter)
132.974	Well, lucky for us,
134.271	in the kit there's actually a razor,
136.495	and we can use that to shave the chest
136.495	on the upper right-hand side
140.074	and the lower left.
142.571	Wookiees also have another problem.
144.341	They have an accessory issue.
145.793	What we want to do is remove these --
148.373	anything between the two pads
148.373	we want to remove,
151.812	since it can cause
151.812	"something called ""arcing."""
154.023	For those who don't know what arcing is,
155.997	do you remember the Emperor,
157.434	when he shoots electricity
157.434	out the ends of his fingers --
160.194	(Laughter)
161.231	that would be kind of like arcing.
162.886	Another thing that --
164.061	Oh! By the way, he creates that
164.061	by wearing wool socks under his robes.
167.414	(Laughter)
168.446	We can also get arcing if we have
168.446	an extremely wet chest.
171.587	The electricity travels across the surface
171.587	instead of through the heart.
175.054	We can correct this with the immortal
175.054	words of Douglas Adams:
177.977	"""Don't panic,"" which most of us"
177.977	have done today --
180.771	and also always having a towel.
183.04	So, good words to go by.
185.071	The metal bikini -- unfortunately,
185.071	this is where panic sets in --
188.854	like the modern bra,
190.08	we have to make sure we remove,
191.973	because this can cause
191.973	severe arcing along with burns.
196.868	But unfortunately this opens up an issue
199.245	that's almost as controversial
199.245	as talking about the prequels.
202.192	(Laughter)
203.312	"The mere mention of the word ""nipples,"""
205.222	and people get into a little
205.222	bit of a tizzy.
207.39	By the way, that is not a nipple,
207.39	that's a cupcake.
209.865	(Laughter)
212.312	Chances are, if you do have to use this,
215.209	this is going to be on someone you know.
217.171	And remember, everyone has nipples,
218.895	except for Jabba.
220.087	(Laughter)
221.376	But he does love cupcakes.
223.588	Speaking about Jabba,
224.763	if we do have to use an AED on him,
227.303	remember pad placement is the same,
229.169	even though he doesn't have nipples.
230.974	So it's going to be
230.974	upper right-hand side, lower left.
234.121	If we were going through, we're shocking,
234.121	getting ready to go --
237.317	after we've done the shock,
238.688	one of the things we need to do
238.688	is remember to do compression.
241.758	The preferred method
241.758	is 30 compressions and two breaths
245.414	in the center of the chest,
245.414	between the nipples,
247.951	pressing down at least two inches,
249.804	no more than two and a half,
251.772	at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,
254.819	no more than 120.
257.77	Unfortunately, due to the size
257.77	of Jabba's mouth
260.626	and also what he puts in said mouth,
262.415	we may not want to actually
262.415	do the mouth-to-mouth part.
266.872	So instead, we can do
266.872	compression-only CPR.
269.377	The way of remembering
269.377	the compression-only part
271.841	is we can actually use the Imperial March.
274.684	I would sing it for you --
276.625	(Laughter)
278.09	Unfortunately, that would be more
278.09	something an interrogation droid would do.
282.971	Yoda.
284.217	Small little guy, like a baby.
285.896	What we do is basically
285.896	treat him like a baby,
288.355	in the sense that we're going to place
288.355	one pad in the center of the chest
291.903	and one in the back.
293.078	If we place them both in the front,
294.77	they can be too close
294.77	and cause severe arcing,
297.364	so we want to avoid that.
298.873	Hopefully, this helped to clarify
301.024	and put some light
301.024	on some of the darker issues
303.35	of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,
305.594	or any universe in total.
307.082	I'll leave you with one point.
308.547	Remember, if you do find yourself
308.547	dealing with a Wookiee,
311.363	do not shave the entire Wookiee.
313.035	This takes way too much time,
314.525	and it only pisses them off.
316.037	(Laughter)
317.069	Thank you very much.
318.257	(Applause)
