16.16	Some of you have heard the story before,
18.12	but, in fact, there's somebody
18.12	in the audience
20.32	who's never heard this story
20.32	in front of an audience before,
23.2	so I'm a little more nervous
23.2	than I normally am telling this story.
26.96	I used to be a photographer
26.96	for many years.
29.08	"In 1978, I was working for ""TIME Magazine"""
31.96	and I was given a three-day assignment
31.96	to photograph Amerasian children,
36.12	children who had been fathered
36.12	by American GIs all over Southeast Asia,
39.48	and then abandoned --
42.84	I had never heard
42.84	the word Amerasian before.
45.68	I spent a few days photographing
45.68	children in different countries,
49.24	and like a lot of photographers
49.24	and a lot of journalists,
52.52	I always hoped that
52.52	when my pictures are published,
55	they might actually
55	have an effect on a situation,
57.4	instead of just documenting it.
58.96	So, I was so disturbed by what I saw
63.24	and I was so unhappy
63.24	with the article that ran afterwards,
67.36	that I decided
67.36	I would take six months off.
69.84	I was 28 years old.
71.28	I decided I would find
71.28	six children in different countries,
75.04	and actually go spend
75.04	some time with the kids,
77.24	and try to tell their story
77.24	a little bit better
79.48	than I thought I had done
79.48	for Time magazine.
82.48	In the course of doing the story,
84.12	I was looking for children
84.12	who hadn't been photographed before,
89.8	and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me
89.8	that they worked with a lot of Americans
94.76	who were donating money
94.76	to help some of these kids.
97.2	And a man told me,
98.48	who ran the Pearl Buck
98.48	Foundation in Korea,
101.16	that there was a young girl,
101.16	who was 11 years old,
103.56	being raised by her grandmother.
105.16	And the grandmother
105.16	had never let any Westerners see her.
107.88	Every time any Westerners
107.88	came to the village, she hid the girl.
110.96	Of course, I was immediately intrigued.
112.88	I saw photographs of her
112.88	and I thought I wanted to go.
115.48	And the guy just told me,
116.76	"""This grandmother -- there's no way"
116.76	she's ever going to let you
119.76	"meet this girl that's she's raising."""
121.6	I took a translator with me
121.6	and went to this village,
124.12	found the grandmother, sat down with her.
126.12	And to my astonishment, she agreed
126.12	to let me photograph her granddaughter.
129.64	And I was paying for this myself,
129.64	so I asked the translator
132.48	if it would be OK
132.48	if I stayed for the week.
134.52	I had a sleeping bag.
136.16	The family had a small shed
136.16	on the side of the house,
138.88	"so I said, ""Could I sleep"
138.88	"in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"""
142.08	And I just told the little girl,
142.08	whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,
147.04	that if I ever did anything
147.04	to embarrass her --
149.28	she didn't speak a word of English,
149.28	although she looked very American --
152.72	"she could put up her hand and say, ""Stop,"""
152.72	and I would stop taking pictures.
156.32	Then my translator left.
156.32	I couldn't speak a word of Korean.
159.16	This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.
161.12	Her mother was still alive.
162.48	She was not raising her,
162.48	her grandmother was raising her.
165.2	And what struck me immediately
167.52	was how in love
167.52	the two of these people were.
171	The grandmother was incredibly fond,
171	deeply in love with this little girl.
175.24	They slept on the floor at night.
176.88	The way they heat their homes in Korea
176.88	is to put bricks under the floors,
180.36	so the heat radiates
180.36	from underneath the floor.
182.6	Eun-Sook was 11 years old.
183.96	I had photographed,
183.96	as I said, a lot of these kids.
186.4	Eun-Sook was the fifth child
186.4	that I found to photograph.
189.4	And almost universally,
189.4	amongst all the kids,
191.96	they were really psychologically damaged
194.68	by having been made fun of,
194.68	ridiculed, picked on and been rejected.
198.52	And Korea was probably the place
198.52	I found to be the worst for these kids.
202.32	And what struck me immediately
202.32	in meeting Eun-Sook
205.52	was how confident she appeared to be,
207.36	how happy she seemed to be
207.36	in her own skin.
209.6	And remember this picture,
210.88	because I'm going to show you
210.88	another picture later.
213.36	She looks much like her grandmother,
213.36	although she looks so Western.
216.56	I decided to follow her to school.
218.24	This is the first morning
218.24	I stayed with her.
220.36	This is on the way to school.
221.8	This is the morning assembly
221.8	outside her school.
228	And I noticed that
228	she was clowning around.
231.52	When the teachers would ask questions,
233.4	she'd be the first person
233.4	to raise her hand.
235.84	Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,
237.8	or anything like the other children
237.8	that I'd photographed.
240.56	The first one to go
240.56	to the blackboard to answer questions.
243.32	Getting in trouble for whispering
243.32	into her best friend's ears.
246.28	And one of the other things
246.28	I said to her through the translator --
249.48	again, this thing about saying stop --
249.48	was to not pay attention to me.
254.08	So she really just completely
254.08	ignored me most of the time.
256.92	I noticed that at recess,
258.16	she was the girl who picked
258.16	the other girls to be on her team.
262	It was very obvious, from the beginning,
262	that she was a leader.
265	This is on the way home.
265	And that's North Korea up along the hill.
268.16	This is up along the DMZ.
269.4	They would actually
269.4	cover the windows every night,
271.8	so that light couldn't be seen,
273.36	because the South Korean government
273.36	has said for years
275.92	that the North Koreans
275.92	may invade at any time.
278.119	So the closer you were to North Korea,
278.119	the more terrifying it was.
281.44	Very often at school,
281.44	I'd be taking pictures,
283.76	and she would whisper
283.76	into her girlfriends' ears,
286.12	"and then look at me and say, ""Stop."""
287.96	And I would stand at attention,
287.96	and all the girls would crack up,
291.04	and it was sort of a little joke.
292.68	(Laughter)
294.08	The end of the week came
294.08	and my translator came back,
296.6	because I'd asked her to come back,
298.32	so I could formally thank
298.32	the grandmother and Eun-Sook.
301.08	And in the course of the grandmother
301.08	talking to the translator,
304.36	the grandmother started crying.
306.08	And I said to my translator,
306.08	"""What's going on, why is she crying?"""
309.24	And she spoke to
309.24	the grandmother for a moment,
311.44	and then she started
311.44	getting tears in her eyes.
313.68	"And I said, ""What did I do?"
313.68	"Why is everyone crying?"""
316.16	And the translator said,
317.4	"""The grandmother says"
317.4	that she thinks she's dying,
320.24	and she wants to know if you would take
320.24	"Eun-Sook to America with you."""
324.76	"And I said, ""I'm 28 years old"
324.76	and I live in hotels,
330.08	"and I'm not married."""
331.92	I mean, I had fallen in love
331.92	with this girl,
334.16	but you know, emotionally
334.16	I was about 12 years old.
337.12	If you know of photographers,
338.72	the joke is it's the finest form
338.72	of delayed adolescence ever invented.
343.16	"""Sorry, I have to go"
343.16	"on an assignment, I'll be back"" --"
345.8	and then you never come back.
347.24	So I asked the translator
347.24	why she thought she was dying.
352.56	Can I get her to a hospital?
352.56	Could I pay to get her a doctor?
355.48	And she refused any help at all.
357.52	So when I got outside,
357.52	I gave the translator some money and said,
360.704	"""Go back and see if you can do something."""
362.824	And I gave the grandmother
362.824	my business card.
364.92	"And I said, ""If you're serious,"
364.92	"I will try to find a family for her."""
368.2	And I immediately wrote a letter
368.2	to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,
371.64	who had an 11-year-old son.
373	And my best friend
373	had mistakenly one day said something
376.48	about wishing he had another child.
379	So my friends Gene and Gayle
379	had not heard from me in about a year,
383.08	and suddenly I was calling,
384.52	"saying ""I'm in Korea"
384.52	"and I've met this extraordinary girl."""
387.8	"And I said, ""The grandmother"
387.8	thinks she's sick,
390.52	but I think maybe we would have to
390.52	"bring the grandmother over also."""
394.04	"And I said, ""I'll pay for the ... """
394.04	I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.
397.72	So anyway, I left.
399	And my friends actually said
399	they were very interested in adopting her.
404.52	"And I said, ""Look, I think"
404.52	I'll scare the grandmother to death,
407.52	if I tell her that
407.52	you're willing to adopt her.
410.12	"I want to go back and talk to her."""
410.12	But I was off on assignment.
413.16	I figured I'd come back
413.16	in a couple of weeks
415.28	and talk to the grandmother.
416.68	And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok
416.68	with a group of photographers
419.92	and got a telegram --
419.92	back in those days, you got telegrams --
422.88	from Time magazine
422.88	saying someone in Korea had died
425.32	and left their child in a will to me.
427.6	Did I know anything about this?
429.16	Because I hadn't told them
429.16	what I was doing,
431.28	because I was so upset
431.28	with the story they'd run.
433.84	So, I went back to Korea,
433.84	and I went back to Eun-Sook's village,
437.24	and she was gone.
438.48	And the house that
438.48	I had spent time in was empty.
441.2	It was incredibly cold.
442.84	No one in the village
442.84	would tell me where Eun-Sook was,
445.48	because the grandmother
445.48	had always hidden her from Westerners.
448.44	And they had no idea
448.44	about this request that she'd made of me.
451.4	So I finally found Myung Sung,
453.24	her best friend that she used to play with
453.24	after school every day.
456.4	And Myung Sung, under some pressure
456.4	from me and the translator,
459.4	gave us an address
459.4	on the outside of Seoul.
461.8	And I went to that address
461.8	and knocked on the door,
466.44	and a man answered the door.
467.84	It was not a very nice area of Seoul,
467.84	there were mud streets outside of it.
472.76	And I knocked on the door
472.76	and Eun-Sook answered the door,
475.48	and her eyes were bloodshot,
475.48	and she seemed to be in shock.
478.28	She didn't recognize me --
478.28	there was no recognition whatsoever.
481.28	And this man came to the door
481.28	and kind of barked something in Korean.
484.56	And I said to the translator,
484.56	"""What did he say?"""
486.84	"And she said, ""He wants"
486.84	"to know who you are."""
489	"And I said, ""Tell him"
489	"that I am a photographer."""
491.28	I started explaining who I was,
491.28	and he interrupted.
493.72	"And she said, ""He says he knows"
493.72	"who you are, what do you want?"""
496.72	"I said, ""Well, tell him that I was asked"
496.72	by this little girl's grandmother
501.2	"to find a family for her."""
503.16	"And he said, ""I'm her uncle,"
503.16	"she's fine, you can leave now."""
508.16	So I was --
510.68	The door was being slammed in my face,
512.56	it's incredibly cold,
512.56	and I'm trying to think,
514.76	"""What would the hero do in a movie,"
514.76	"if I was writing this as a movie script?"""
518.44	"So I said, ""It's really cold,"
518.44	I've come a very long way,
521.12	do you mind if I come in
521.12	"for a minute? I'm freezing."""
523.64	So the guy reluctantly let us in
523.64	and we sat down on the floor.
526.6	And as we started talking,
526.6	I saw him yell something,
529.079	and Eun-Sook came
529.079	and brought us some food.
531.88	And I had this whole mental picture
531.88	of -- sort of like Cinderella.
535.24	I sort of had this picture
535.24	of this incredibly wonderful,
538.76	bright, happy little child,
540.76	who now appeared to be very withdrawn,
540.76	being enslaved by this family.
545.76	And I was really appalled,
545.76	and I couldn't figure out what to do.
548.84	And the more I tried talking to him,
548.84	the less friendly he was getting.
552.16	"So finally I said ""Look,"" --"
552.16	this is all through the translator,
555.2	because, you know,
555.2	I don't speak a word of Korean --
557.68	"and I said, ""Look, I'm really glad"
557.68	that Eun-Sook has a family to live with.
562	I was very worried about her.
563.44	I made a promise to her grandmother,
563.44	your mother, that I would find a family,
567.12	and I'm so happy that
567.12	you're going to take care of her.
569.76	But I bought an airline ticket
569.76	and I'm stuck here for a week.
572.68	I'm staying in a hotel downtown.
574.28	Would you like to come
574.28	and have lunch tomorrow?
576.52	"And you can practice your English."""
578.24	Because he told me -- I was trying
578.24	to ask him questions about himself.
581.56	And so I went to the hotel,
581.56	and I found two older Amerasians.
585.68	A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,
590.16	and she was a prostitute,
592.04	and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.
594	And I said to them,
594	"""Look, there's a little girl"
596.32	who has a tiny chance
596.32	of getting out of here
599.48	and going to America.
600.76	I don't know if it's
600.76	the right decision or not,
603.12	but I would like you
603.12	to come to lunch tomorrow
605.32	and tell the uncle what it's like
605.32	to walk down the street,
608.08	what people say to you,
608.08	what you do for a living.
610.68	I want him to understand
610.68	what happens if she stays here.
613.72	And I could be wrong, I don't know,
613.72	"but I wish you would come tomorrow."""
617.16	So, these two came to lunch
617.16	and we got thrown out of the restaurant.
621	They were yelling at him,
621	it got to be really ugly.
624.48	We went outside, and he was just furious.
626.457	And I knew I had totally blown this thing.
628.52	Here I was again,
628.52	trying to figure out what to do.
630.92	And he started yelling at me,
630.92	and I said to the translator,
633.76	"""Tell him to calm down,"
633.76	"what is he saying?"""
635.8	"And she said, ""He's saying, 'Who the hell"
635.8	are you to walk into my house,
639.24	some rich American
639.24	with your cameras around your neck,
641.8	accusing me of enslaving my niece?
644.52	This is my niece, I love her,
644.52	she's my sister's daughter.
647.846	Who the hell are you
647.846	"to accuse me of something like this?'"""
652.28	And I said, you know,
652.28	"""Look, you're absolutely right."
655.16	I don't pretend to understand
655.16	what's going on here.
657.6	All I know is, I've been
657.6	photographing a lot of these children.
660.6	I'm in love with your niece,
663.56	I think she's an incredibly
663.56	"special child."""
665.92	"And I said, ""Look, I will fly my friends"
665.92	over here from the United States
669.4	if you want to meet them,
669.4	to see if you approve of them.
672.08	I just think that --
672.08	what little I know about the situation,
675.72	she has very little chance here
675.72	of having the kind of life
678.48	"that you probably would like her to have."""
680.52	So, everyone told me afterwards
680.52	that inviting the prospective parents over
684.04	was, again, the stupidest thing
684.04	I could have possibly done,
686.84	because who's ever
686.84	good enough for your relative?
689.2	But he invited me to come to a ceremony
689.2	they were having that day
692.32	for her grandmother.
693.72	And they actually take
693.72	items of clothing and photographs,
696.44	and they burn them as part of the ritual.
699.2	And you can see how different she looks
699.2	just in three months.
702.12	This was now, I think, early February.
704.56	And the pictures before
704.56	were taken in September.
708.2	Well, there was
708.2	an American Maryknoll priest
710.32	that I had met in the course
710.32	of doing the story,
712.6	who had 75 children living in his house.
714.56	He had three women helping him
714.56	take care of these kids.
717.2	And so I suggested to the uncle
717.2	that we go down and meet Father Keane
720.48	to find out how
720.48	the adoption process worked.
722.6	Because I wanted him to feel
724	like this was all being done
724	very much above board.
726.44	So, this is on the way
726.44	down to the orphanage.
729.16	This is Father Keane.
729.16	He's just a wonderful guy.
734.24	He had kids from
734.24	all over Korea living there,
736.52	and he would find families for these kids.
739.6	This is a social worker
739.6	interviewing Eun-Sook.
742.08	Now, I had always thought she was
742.08	completely untouched by all of this,
745.52	because the grandmother, to me,
747.04	appeared to be sort of
747.04	the village wise woman --
750.64	throughout the day, I noticed people
750.64	kept coming to visit her grandmother.
754.16	And I always had this mental picture
755.92	that even though they may have been
755.92	one of the poorer families in the village,
759.64	they were one of the most respected.
761.4	And I always felt that the grandmother
761.4	had kind of demanded, and insisted,
765	that the villagers treat Eun-Sook
765	with the same respect they treated her.
770.4	Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,
772.52	and her uncle agreed to let her stay there
772.52	until the adoption went through.
776.12	He actually agreed to the adoption.
778	And I went off on assignment
778	and came back a week later,
780.68	and Father Keane said,
780.68	"""I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook."""
783.72	"I said, ""Oh God, now what?"""
785.08	And he takes me into this room,
785.08	closes the door and says,
787.8	"""I have 75 children here in the orphanage,"
787.8	"and it's total bedlam."""
790.96	There's clothes, there's kids.
792.44	Three adults and 75 kids --
792.44	you can imagine.
794.8	"And he said, ""The second day"
794.8	she was here she made up a list
797.68	of all of the names
797.68	of the older kids and the younger kids.
800.68	And she assigned one of the older kids
800.68	to each of the younger kids.
804.24	And then she set up a work detail list
804.24	"of who cleaned the orphanage on what day."""
808.84	"And he said, ""She's telling me"
808.84	that I'm messy
811	"and I have to clean up my room."""
812.6	"And he said, ""I don't know who raised her,"
812.6	but she's running the orphanage,
816.2	"and she's been here three days."""
817.8	(Laughter)
819.28	This was movie day that she organized
819.28	where all the kids went to the movies.
824.36	A lot of the kids who had been adopted
824.36	wrote back to the other kids,
827.6	telling them what their life
827.6	was like with their new families.
830.56	So it was a really big deal
830.56	when the letters showed up.
833.2	This is a woman who is
833.2	now working at the orphanage,
835.68	whose son had been adopted.
840.12	Gene and Gayle started studying Korean
842.16	the moment they had gotten
842.16	my first letter.
844.2	They really wanted to be able
844.2	to welcome Eun-Sook into their family.
848.72	And one of the things Father Keane told me
850.8	when I came back
850.8	from one of these trips --
852.84	Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,
854.76	which I understood was from her watching
854.76	"a ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon"
859.04	on the American Air Force station.
861	This may be one
861	of those myth-buster things
863.08	that we'll have to
863.08	clear up here, in a minute.
865.28	So, my friend Gene
865.28	flew over with his son, Tim.
867.6	Gayle couldn't come.
869.16	And they spent a lot of time
869.16	huddled over a dictionary.
871.8	And this was Gene showing the uncle
873.52	where Atlanta was on the map,
873.52	where he lived.
876.96	This is the uncle
876.96	signing the adoption papers.
880	Now, we went out to dinner
880	that night to celebrate.
882.44	The uncle went back to his family
884.08	and Natasha and Tim and Gene and I
884.08	went out to dinner.
887.56	And Gene was showing Natasha
887.56	how to use a knife and fork,
891.44	and then Natasha
891.44	was returning the utensil lessons.
896.12	We went back to our hotel room,
898.04	and Gene was showing Natasha
898.04	also where Atlanta was.
900.52	This is the third night we were in Korea.
902.52	The first night we'd gotten a room
902.52	for the kids right next to us.
905.6	I'd been staying in this room
905.6	for about three months --
908.24	it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.
911.76	The second night,
911.76	we didn't keep the kids' room,
914.16	because we slept on the floor
914.16	with all the kids at the orphanage.
917.28	And the third night, we came back --
919.04	we'd just gone out to dinner,
919.04	where you saw the pictures --
921.84	and we got to the front desk,
921.84	and the guy said,
924.08	"""There's no other free rooms"
924.08	on your floor tonight,
926.52	you can put the kids
926.52	"five floors below you."""
928.64	And Gene and I
928.64	looked at each other and said,
930.8	"""We don't want two 11-year-olds"
930.8	"five floors away."""
933.2	"So his son said, ""I have a sleeping bag,"
933.2	"I'll sleep on the floor."""
936.36	"And I said, ""I have one too."""
936.36	So Tim and I slept on the floor,
939.32	Natasha got one bed,
939.32	Gene got the other -- kids pass out,
942.12	it's been very exciting for three days.
944.04	We're lying in bed, and Gene and I
944.04	are talking about how cool we are.
947.56	"We said, ""That was so great,"
947.56	"we saved this little girl's life."""
950.56	We were just like,
950.56	you know, just full of ourselves.
954.04	And we fall asleep --
955.4	and I've been in this room
955.4	for a couple of months now.
958	And they always overheat
958	the hotels in Korea terribly,
961.88	so during the day
961.88	I always left the window open.
964.2	And then about midnight,
964.2	they turn the heat off in the hotel.
967.12	So at 1am, the whole room would be
967.12	like 20 below zero, and I'd get up.
970.44	I'd been doing this
970.44	every night I'd been there.
972.68	So, sure enough,
972.68	it's one o'clock, room's freezing,
975.2	I go to close the window
975.2	and I hear people shouting outside,
978.92	"and I thought, ""Oh, the bars"
978.92	"must have just gotten out."""
981.564	I don't speak Korean,
981.564	but I'm hearing these voices,
984	and I'm not hearing anger,
984	I'm hearing terror.
987.24	So I open the window and I look out,
989.36	and there's flames
989.36	coming up the side of our hotel,
992.12	and the hotel's on fire.
993.84	So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,
995.8	"and I say, ""Don't freak out,"
995.8	"I think the hotel's on fire."""
998.6	And now there's smoke and flames
998.6	coming by our windows --
1001.32	we're on the 11th floor.
1002.6	So the two of us were just like,
1002.6	"""Oh my God, oh my God."""
1005.28	So we're trying to get Natasha up,
1005.28	and we can't talk to her.
1008.68	You know what kids are like
1008.68	when they've been asleep for like an hour,
1012	it's like they took five Valiums --
1012	they're all over the place.
1015	And we can't talk to her.
1016.24	His son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces,
1016.24	and we're trying to do up his laces.
1019.68	So we try to get to the door,
1019.68	we run to the door, we open the door,
1022.88	and it's like walking
1022.88	into a blast furnace.
1024.96	There's people screaming,
1024.96	the sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.
1028.36	And the whole room filled
1028.36	with smoke in about two seconds.
1031.2	And Gene turns around and says,
1031.2	"""We're not going to make it."""
1034.12	And he closes the door, and the whole room
1034.12	is now filled with smoke.
1037.36	We're all choking, and there's smoke
1039.12	pouring through the vents,
1039.12	under the doors.
1041.16	There's people screaming.
1042.44	I just remember this unbelievable --
1042.44	just utter chaos.
1045.08	I remember sitting near the bed,
1045.08	and I had two overwhelming feelings.
1048.6	One was absolute terror.
1048.6	"""Oh, please God, I just want to wake up."
1051.92	This has got to be a nightmare,
1051.92	this can't be happening.
1054.6	"Please, I just want to wake up."""
1056.2	And the other is unbelievable guilt.
1057.96	Here I've been playing God
1057.96	with my friends' lives,
1060.36	my friends' son, with Natasha's life,
1062.2	and this what you get when you try
1062.2	playing God, is you hurt people.
1065.52	I remember just being
1065.52	so frightened and terrified.
1067.92	And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,
1069.92	"""We've got to soak towels."""
1069.92	"I said, ""What?"""
1072	"""We've got to soak towels."
1072	"We're going to die from the smoke."""
1074.96	So got towels and put them
1074.96	over our faces and the kids' faces.
1077.889	"Then he said, ""Do you have gaffer's tape?"""
1079.96	"""What?"" ""Do you have gaffer's tape?"""
1081.72	"I said, ""Somewhere in my Halliburton."""
1083.6	"He says, ""We've got to stop the smoke."
1083.6	"That's all we can do."""
1086.482	I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.
1088.96	So we put the room service menus
1088.96	over the vents in the wall,
1093.84	we put blankets at the bottom of the door,
1095.92	we put the kids on the windowsill
1095.92	to try to get some air.
1098.64	And there was a new building, going up,
1100.56	that was being built
1100.56	right across the street from our hotel.
1103.44	And there, in the building,
1103.44	were photographers,
1105.655	waiting for people to jump.
1107.48	Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.
1109.6	Five people jumped and died,
1109.6	other people were killed by the smoke.
1113.68	And there's this loud thumping on the door
1113.68	after about 45 minutes in all this,
1118.68	and people were shouting in Korean.
1120.4	And I remember --
1125.16	Natasha didn't want us opening the door --
1127.8	sorry, I was trying not to open the door,
1129.8	because we'd spent so much time
1129.8	barricading the room.
1132.32	I didn't know who it was,
1132.32	I didn't know what they wanted,
1135.04	and Natasha could tell
1135.04	they were firemen trying to get us out.
1138	I remember a sort of a tussle at the door,
1138	trying to get the door open.
1141.36	In any case, 12 hours later --
1141.36	I mean, they put us in the lobby.
1145.8	Gene ended up using his coat,
1145.8	and his fist in the coat,
1149.44	to break open a liquor cabinet.
1151	People were lying on the floor.
1152.56	It was one of just
1152.56	the most horrifying nights.
1154.76	And then 12 hours later,
1154.76	we rented a car, as we had planned to,
1158.52	and drove back to Natasha's village.
1160.52	"And we kept saying, ""Do you realize"
1160.52	we were dying in a hotel fire,
1163.68	"like eight hours ago?"""
1164.92	It's so weird how life just goes on.
1166.68	Natasha wanted to introduce her brother
1166.68	and father to all the villagers,
1170.12	and the day we showed up turned out
1170.12	to be a 60-year-old man's birthday.
1173.48	This guy's 60 years old.
1174.72	So it turned into a dual celebration,
1176.52	because Natasha was
1176.52	the first person from this village
1179.08	ever to go to the United States.
1180.68	So, these are the greenhouse tents.
1182.4	This is the elders
1182.4	teaching Gene their dances.
1184.6	We drank a lot of rice wine.
1186	We were both so drunk,
1186	I couldn't believe it.
1191.92	This is the last picture
1191.92	before Gene and Tim headed back.
1194.92	The adoption people told us
1196.6	it was going to take a year
1196.6	for the adoption to go through.
1200.24	Like, what could you do for a year?
1202.12	So I found out the name of every official
1202.12	on both the Korean and American side,
1205.88	and I photographed them,
1207.16	and told them how famous they were
1207.16	going to be when this book was done.
1210.52	And four months later,
1210.52	the adoption papers came through.
1214.4	This is saying goodbye
1214.4	to everybody at the orphanage.
1217.6	This is Father Keane with Natasha
1217.6	at the bus stop.
1220.96	Her great aunt at the airport.
1222.72	I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacific
1222.72	airlines for many years,
1226.16	where they gave me free passes
1226.16	on all their airlines
1229.2	in return for photography.
1230.52	It was like the ultimate perk.
1232.32	And the pilot, I actually knew --
1234.24	because they used to let me sit
1234.24	in the jump seat,
1236.6	to tell you how long ago this was.
1238.28	This is a TriStar, and so they let Natasha
1238.28	actually sit in the jump seat.
1241.76	And the pilot, Jeff Cowley,
1241.76	actually went back
1243.96	and adopted one of the other kids
1243.96	at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.
1248.08	This is 28 hours later in Atlanta.
1250.16	It's a very long flight.
1251.6	Just to make things even crazier,
1251.6	Gayle, Natasha's new mom,
1254.96	was three days away
1254.96	from giving birth to her own daughter.
1258.92	You know, if you were
1258.92	writing this, you'd say,
1261.12	"""No, we've got to write"
1261.12	"the script differently."""
1263.4	This is the first night showing Natasha
1263.4	her new cousins and uncles and aunts.
1267.12	Gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta --
1267.12	they're the most social couple imaginable.
1271.2	So, at this point, Natasha
1271.2	doesn't speak a word of English,
1274.141	other than what little
1274.141	Father Keane taught her.
1277.16	This is Kylie, her sister,
1277.16	who's now a doctor, on the right.
1283.6	This is a deal I had with Natasha,
1283.6	which is that when we got to Atlanta
1287.04	she could cut off my beard.
1289.72	She never liked it very much.
1292.6	She learned English in three months.
1294.4	She entered seventh grade
1294.4	at her own age level.
1299.36	Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.
1301.32	This is her cooking teacher.
1302.72	Natasha told me a lot of the kids
1302.72	thought she was stuck up,
1305.56	because they would talk to her
1305.56	and she wouldn't answer,
1308.2	and they didn't realize
1308.2	she didn't speak English very well.
1311	But what I noticed, again as an observer,
1313	was she was choosing
1313	who was going to be on her team,
1317.48	and seemed to be very popular
1317.48	very, very quickly.
1321.2	Now, remember the picture,
1322.52	how much she looked like
1322.52	her grandmother, at the beginning?
1325.32	People were always telling Natasha
1325.32	how much she looks like her mother, Gayle.
1329	(Laughter)
1331.04	This is a tense moment
1331.04	in the first football game, I think.
1337.04	And Kylie -- I mean, it was
1337.04	almost like Kylie was her own child.
1346.2	She's being baptized.
1349	Now, a lot of parents, when they adopt,
1350.92	actually want to erase
1350.92	their children's history.
1353.2	And Gayle and Gene
1353.2	did the complete opposite.
1355.36	They were studying Korean;
1355.36	they bought Korean clothes.
1357.96	Gene even did a little
1357.96	tile work in the kitchen,
1360.24	"which was that, ""Once upon a time,"
1360.24	there was a beautiful girl
1363.16	that came from the hills of Korea
1363.16	"to live happily ever after in Atlanta."""
1366.613	She hates this picture --
1366.613	it was her first job.
1368.853	She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia
1371.28	with the money she made
1371.28	working at Burger King.
1373.68	The captain of the cheerleaders.
1376	Beauty pageant.
1378.8	Used to do their
1378.8	Christmas card every year.
1380.96	Gene's been restoring this car
1380.96	for a million years.
1387.16	Kodak hired Natasha to be a translator
1387.16	for them at the Olympics in Korea.
1391.32	Her future husband, Jeff,
1391.32	was working for Canon cameras,
1396.24	and met Natasha at the Olympic Village.
1399.76	This is her first trip back to Korea.
1399.76	So there's her uncle.
1403.68	This is her half sister.
1406.72	She went back to the village.
1408.16	That's her best friend's mother.
1412	And I always thought that was
1412	a very Annie Hall kind of outfit.
1415.32	(Laughter)
1417.32	It's just, you know, it was
1417.32	just so interesting, just to watch --
1420.4	this is her mother
1420.4	in the background there.
1427.367	This is Natasha's wedding day.
1433.96	Gene is looking a little older.
1446.92	This is Sydney, who's going to be
1446.92	three years old in a couple of days.
1452.28	And there's Evan.
1454.88	And Natasha, would you
1454.88	just come up, for a second,
1457.44	just maybe to say hello to everybody?
1459.28	(Applause)
1469.68	Natasha's actually
1469.68	never heard me tell the story.
1472.04	You know, we've looked
1472.04	at the pictures together.
1474.32	Natasha: I've seen pictures
1474.32	millions of times,
1476.52	but today was the first time I'm actually
1476.52	seeing him give the whole presentation.
1481.2	I started crying.
1483.08	Rick Smolan: There's about 40 things
1483.08	she's going to tell me,
1485.96	"""That wasn't what happened."""
1485.96	Natasha: I'll tell you that later.
1489.32	RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard,
1489.32	so much for letting us tell the story.
1493.24	Thank you, all of you.
1494.52	(Applause)
