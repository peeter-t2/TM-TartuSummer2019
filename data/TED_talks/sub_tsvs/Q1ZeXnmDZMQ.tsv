26	The immersive ugliness
29	of our everyday environments in America
34	is entropy made visible.
38	We can't overestimate the amount of despair
42	that we are generating with places like this.
47	And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better
51	if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.
57	By the way, this doesn't help.
60	Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.
67	There are a lot of ways you can describe this.
69	"You know, I like to call it ""the national automobile slum."""
72	You can call it suburban sprawl.
75	I think it's appropriate to call it
77	the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
82	You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
87	And it's a tremendous problem for us.
93	The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us
97	is that these are places that are not worth caring about.
100	We're going to talk about that some more.
103	A sense of place:
105	your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
112	depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
117	and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
121	syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
125	in order to inform us who we are.
128	The public realm in America has two roles:
134	it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
139	and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
144	And when you degrade the public realm,
147	you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
150	and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
159	The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
164	because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
168	and market squares of older cultures.
172	And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
180	all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
185	This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
190	that we threw in the garbage after World War II
195	and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.
198	And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
203	The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
208	but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
212	Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
217	by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going
223	in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
228	And if there is one tremendous --
230	if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,
233	the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
237	it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.
246	The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.
250	You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
256	And remember, to create a place of character and quality,
260	you have to be able to define space.
262	So how is that being accomplished here?
264	If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
267	and try to look at the Target store over here,
269	you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
275	That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.
281	Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
284	These will be places that are not worth caring about.
288	We have about, you know, 38,000 places
291	that are not worth caring about in the United States today.
293	When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.
299	And I want you to think about that when you think about
303	those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,
305	spilling their blood in the sand,
307	"and ask yourself, ""What is their last thought of home?"""
312	I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store
316	because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)
322	We need better places in this country.
325	Public space. This is a good public space.
327	It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
330	It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
333	It has something that is terribly important --
336	it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
339	That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --
344	things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
347	The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
350	and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
355	You know, in these places in other cultures,
359	people just go there voluntarily because they like them.
363	We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)
366	You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.
369	People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.
373	But this is how we do it in the United States.
377	Probably the most significant public space failure in America,
380	designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:
385	Boston City Hall Plaza.
387	A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)
393	And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,
396	and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.
399	And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.
403	This is the other side of the building.
405	This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.
410	It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,
413	but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.
424	This is the back of Boston City Hall,
426	the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.
434	And what is the message that is coming,
436	what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building
439	and how is it informing us about who we are?
442	This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits
446	of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,
451	and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,
454	because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
459	You know, that it's a despotic building;
461	it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)
469	This is it on a smaller scale:
471	the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.
475	By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,
480	they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)
485	and they shouted at me and said,
488	"""It was raining that day when you took that picture!"""
492	Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)
504	You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)
509	Audio jack, power supply --
514	and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?
519	You know, we hire firms to design these things.
521	You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.
525	You know, eight hours before deadline,
527	four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
531	And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table
534	with all the drawings, and the renderings,
536	and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --
540	I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)
544	Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
549	"It was: ""Fuck it."" (Laughter) (Applause)"
556	That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.
562	The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.
568	So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --
571	you know -- do some reality testing,
573	and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)
577	it's not interesting enough for his clients,
579	you know, the burglars, the muggers.
582	It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
587	OK.
589	The pattern of Main Street USA --
592	in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
597	It's not that complicated:
599	buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
605	so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
608	Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
612	you know, apartments, offices, and so on.
615	You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
619	They haven't learned that in Monterey.
621	If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
625	you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.
628	It's really incredible.
630	Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,
634	and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
637	when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
639	So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
645	OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
651	where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
654	Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
658	Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
662	we pop a handicapped ramp on that,
665	and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
669	And that's how we do it.
671	"I call them ""nature Band-Aids"" because there's a general idea in America"
675	that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
680	And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
687	Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
693	You know, that's not good enough.
694	We have to do good buildings.
696	The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:
699	To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,
702	to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,
707	to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
710	and to soften the hardscape of the buildings
712	and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.
716	And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.
720	They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;
723	"they're not supposed to be a set for ""The Last of the Mohicans."""
728	You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding
736	of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
740	They're not the same thing.
742	And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
746	which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
748	Here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,
752	R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch
758	to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)
763	A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma
768	that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
772	city life, and everything connected with it.
774	And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
779	is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
783	which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
786	And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
790	the country villa along the railroad line,
793	which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
796	but to return to the countryside every night.
798	And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
801	so it really was a form of country living.
803	But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years
807	and it turns into something rather insidious.
809	It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
814	And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia
819	and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
821	Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
826	And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.
830	Basically, a house with nothing on the side
833	because this house wants to state, emphatically,
835	"""I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me."
838	"I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see."""
842	So you have this one last facade of the house,
844	the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.
847	Because -- notice the porch here.
849	Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.
856	"This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called ""We're Normal."""
862	We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
865	Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
867	But we know what's going on in these houses, you know.
869	We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,
873	getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)
877	We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,
880	is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.
883	Because these places, these habitats,
886	are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,
891	and they don't have a lot of experience with medication.
895	So they take the first one that comes along, often.
897	These are not good enough for Americans.
899	These are the schools we are sending them to:
902	The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.
908	This is a real school!
910	You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,
914	that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.
918	So every effort is made to keep them within the building.
923	Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)
930	We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.
932	We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America
937	-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.
942	It is going to change absolutely everything.
946	Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,
949	except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.
952	Forget it. It's not going to happen.
954	We're going to have to do something else instead.
956	We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size
961	virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.
965	We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.
969	We're going to have to live closer to each other.
971	We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
975	The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.
980	We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!
985	We gotta do better than that!
987	And we should have started two days before yesterday.
990	We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,
995	excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage
999	by our parents' generation after World War II.
1002	Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.
1004	We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill
1010	in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,
1016	that allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life
1023	and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.
1028	So that, you know, the residences make sense
1031	deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.
1036	We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:
1040	the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,
1046	the courtyard, the civic square
1049	and how to really make use of this property.
1052	We can see some of the first ideas
1055	for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
1060	The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
1063	Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.
1065	They're not going to be retro-fitted;
1067	they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.
1069	Some of them we're going to fix, though.
1071	And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems
1075	and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.
1081	And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers
1087	in our existing towns and cities.
1089	And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were
1094	because they occupy all the important sites.
1096	And most of them are still going to be there,
1099	although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.
1104	We've got a lot of work to do.
1106	We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
1111	No amount or combination of alternative fuels
1114	is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.
1118	We're going to have to do everything very differently.
1121	And America's not prepared.
1123	We are sleepwalking into the future.
1126	We're not ready for what's coming at us.
1129	So I urge you all to do what you can.
1132	Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.
1139	Be prepared to be good neighbors.
1142	Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful
1147	to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.
1149	One final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,
1152	but I think it's particularly important for this audience.
1155	"Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as ""consumers."" OK?"
1161	Consumers are different than citizens.
1163	Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties
1168	to their fellow human beings.
1170	And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,
1173	you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.
1177	And we're going to continue being clueless
1180	going into this very difficult future that we face.
1183	So thank you very much.
1184	Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about
1190	and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)
