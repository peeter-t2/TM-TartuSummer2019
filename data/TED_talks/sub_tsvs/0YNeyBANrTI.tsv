15.745	I'm a designer and an educator.
18.641	I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students
21.537	to fly through a very creative, multitasking design process.
27.648	But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
32.613	Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking.
38.318	A couple of examples.
41.233	Look at that.
42.661	This is my multitasking activity result. (Laughter)
46.274	So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS,
49.929	and maybe uploading some pictures
52.281	about this awesome barbecue.
55.799	So someone tells us the story about supertaskers,
59.833	so this two percent of people who are able
63.258	to control multitasking environment.
67.394	But what about ourselves, and what about our reality?
71.998	When's the last time you really enjoyed
74.299	just the voice of your friend?
77.569	So this is a project I'm working on,
80.825	and this is a series of front covers
85.869	to downgrade our super, hyper â€”
90.376	(Laughter) (Applause)
95.293	to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones
98.101	into the essence of their function.
101.132	Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?
103.909	How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these little streets
108.222	on the island.
110.605	But our multitasking reality is pretty different,
114.047	and full of tons of information.
118.319	So what about something like that
120.856	to rediscover our sense of adventure?
125.023	I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono
128.296	when the number of possibilities is so huge,
132.847	but I push you to consider the option of
137.446	focusing on just one task,
140.563	or maybe turning your digital senses totally off.
146.52	So nowadays, everyone could produce his mono product.
152.536	Why not? So find your monotask spot
156.28	within the multitasking world.
158.864	Thank you.
160.397	(Applause)
