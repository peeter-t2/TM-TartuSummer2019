12.5	Here's a question for you:
15.26	how many different scents
15.26	do you think you can smell,
18.42	and maybe even identify with accuracy?
26.9	1,000?
30.1	One study estimates that humans can
30.1	detect up to one trillion different odors.
36.1	A trillion.
37.74	It's hard to imagine,
39.58	but your nose has the molecular
39.58	machinery to make it happen.
44.78	Olfactory receptors --
46.58	tiny scent detectors --
48.54	are packed into your nose,
50.5	each one patiently waiting
50.5	to be activated by the odor,
53.94	or ligand,
55.26	that it's been assigned to detect.
58.34	It turns out we humans,
58.34	like all vertebrates,
61.46	have lots of olfactory receptors.
64.62	In fact, more of our DNA is devoted
64.62	to genes for different olfactory receptors
71.38	than for any other type of protein.
75.06	Why is that?
77.46	Could olfactory receptors
77.46	be doing something else
80.78	in addition to allowing us to smell?
85.66	In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel
85.66	uncovered the molecular identity
90.74	of olfactory receptors --
92.26	work which ultimately
92.26	led to a Nobel Prize.
96.38	At the time,
97.62	we all assumed that these receptors
97.62	were only found in the nose.
102.3	However, about a year or so later,
104.54	a report emerged of an olfactory
104.54	receptor expressed in a tissue
109.06	other than the nose.
111.18	And then another such report emerged,
113.86	and another.
115.7	We now know that these receptors
115.7	are found all over the body,
119.78	including in some pretty
119.78	unexpected places --
123.74	in muscle,
125.38	in kidneys,
126.98	lungs
128.54	and blood vessels.
130.34	But what are they doing there?
135.58	Well, we know that olfactory receptors
135.58	act as sensitive chemical sensors
140.299	in the nose --
141.54	that's how they mediate
141.54	our sense of smell.
144.3	It turns out they also act
144.3	as sensitive chemical sensors
148.5	in many other parts of the body.
151.1	Now, I'm not saying that your liver can
151.1	detect the aroma of your morning coffee
156.02	as you walk into the kitchen.
158.3	Rather, after you drink
158.3	your morning coffee,
161.46	your liver might use an olfactory receptor
164.46	to chemically detect
164.46	the change in concentration
167.66	of a chemical floating
167.66	through your bloodstream.
170.82	Many cell types and tissues in the body
170.82	use chemical sensors,
174.34	or chemosensors,
175.86	to keep track of the concentration
175.86	of hormones, metabolites
179.86	and other molecules,
181.34	and some of these chemosensors
181.34	are olfactory receptors.
187.14	If you are a pancreas or a kidney
189.02	and you need a specialized chemical sensor
191.86	that will allow you to keep track
191.86	of a specific molecule,
195.46	why reinvent the wheel?
199.46	One of the first examples
201.22	of an olfactory receptor
201.22	found outside the nose
204.18	showed that human sperm
204.18	express an olfactory receptor,
209.22	and that sperm with this receptor
209.22	will seek out the chemical
213.54	that the receptor responds to --
215.5	the receptor's ligand.
217.18	That is, the sperm
217.18	will swim toward the ligand.
222.06	This has intriguing implications.
225.26	Are sperm aided in finding the egg
228.3	by sniffing out the area
228.3	with the highest ligand concentration?
233.42	I like this example
233.42	because it clearly demonstrates
236.78	that an olfactory receptor's primary job
236.78	is to be a chemical sensor,
242.1	but depending on the context,
245.02	it can influence how you perceive a smell,
248.74	or in which direction sperm will swim,
253.42	and as it turns out,
254.74	a huge variety of other processes.
257.74	Olfactory receptors have been
257.74	implicated in muscle cell migration,
262.78	in helping the lung to sense
262.78	and respond to inhaled chemicals,
266.82	and in wound healing.
269.26	Similarly, taste receptors once thought
269.26	to be found only in the tongue,
273.86	are now known to be expressed
273.86	in cells and tissues throughout the body.
278.98	Even more surprisingly,
281.18	a recent study found
282.7	that the light receptors in our eyes
282.7	also play a role in our blood vessels.
290.62	In my lab,
291.9	we work on trying to understand the roles
291.9	of olfactory receptors and taste receptors
297.38	in the context of the kidney.
300.9	The kidney is a central
300.9	control center for homeostasis.
304.7	And to us,
305.94	it makes sense that a homeostatic
305.94	control center would be a logical place
309.74	to employ chemical sensors.
313.34	We've identified a number
313.34	of different olfactory and taste receptors
317.02	in the kidney,
318.38	one of which, olfactory receptor 78,
321.98	is known to be expressed
321.98	in cells and tissues
325.38	that are important
325.38	in the regulation of blood pressure.
330.1	When this receptor is deleted in mice,
333.38	their blood pressure is low.
337.26	Surprisingly, this receptor
337.26	was found to respond
340.74	to chemicals called
340.74	short-chain fatty acids
343.98	that are produced by the bacteria
343.98	that reside in your gut --
347.82	your gut microbiota.
350.66	After being produced
350.66	by your gut microbiota,
353.38	these chemicals are absorbed
353.38	into your bloodstream
356.22	where they can then
356.22	interact with receptors
358.34	like olfactory receptor 78,
361.38	meaning that the changes
361.38	in metabolism of your gut microbiota
366.26	may influence your blood pressure.
371.66	Although we've identified a number
371.66	of different olfactory and taste receptors
375.98	in the kidney,
377.26	we've only just begun
377.26	to tease out their different functions
380.42	and to figure out which chemicals
380.42	each of them responds to.
385.06	Similar investigations lie ahead
385.06	for many other organs and tissues --
389.02	only a small minority of receptors
389.02	has been studied to date.
395.06	This is exciting stuff.
397.9	It's revolutionizing our understanding
397.9	of the scope of influence
401.46	for one of the five senses.
404.42	And it has the potential
404.42	to change our understanding
407.1	of some aspects of human physiology.
411.38	It's still early,
412.62	but I think we've picked up on the scent
412.62	of something we're following.
416.9	(Laughter)
417.94	Thank you.
419.18	(Applause)
