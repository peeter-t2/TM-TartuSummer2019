12.485	Good morning.
13.669	My name is David Rose.
14.953	I am a serial entrepreneur
14.953	turned serial investor.
18.533	And by the use of pitching
18.533	PowerPoints to VCs,
22.153	I have personally raised
22.153	tens of millions of dollars
24.653	from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
27.547	And turning to the other side
27.547	of the equation,
29.749	I've personally supervised the investment
29.749	of tens of millions of dollars
33.189	into companies who have pitched me
33.189	with PowerPoint presentations.
36.28	So I think it's safe to say
37.629	I know a little bit
37.629	about the process of pitching.
40.305	So, the very first question
40.305	you've got to figure out is:
42.961	What is the single most important
42.961	thing that a VC is looking for
46.643	when you come to them
46.643	pitching your new business idea?
49.785	There are obviously all kinds of things --
51.814	business models and financials
51.814	and markets and this and that.
54.72	Overall, of all the things
54.72	that you have to do,
56.95	what is the single most important thing
58.881	the VC is going to be investing in?
61.903	Somebody? What?
63.16	Audience: People!
64.662	David Rose: People! You!
64.662	That's it -- you are the person.
68.065	Therefore, the entire purpose
68.065	of a VC pitch is to convince them
71.965	that you are the entrepreneur in whom
71.965	they are going to invest their money
75.583	and make a lot of money in return.
77.497	Now, how do you do this?
78.688	You can't just walk up and say,
80.212	"""Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,"
80.212	"and you should invest in me."" Right?"
84.18	So in the course of your VC pitch --
84.18	you have a very few minutes;
87.778	most VC pitches, angel pitches,
87.778	are about 15 minutes,
90.915	most should be less than half an hour --
93.359	people's attention span,
93.359	after 18 minutes, begins to drop off.
96.301	Tests have shown.
97.476	So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,
99.695	you have to convey a whole bunch
99.695	of different characteristics,
102.655	about 10 different characteristics,
104.741	while you're standing up there.
106.258	What's the single most important thing
106.258	you've got to convey? What?
109.896	Audience: Integrity.
111.114	DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
112.337	That's a straight line, look at that!
114.147	And I didn't even prompt him.
115.568	Right, integrity. The key thing.
117.52	I would much rather invest in,
117.52	take a chance on,
120.552	somebody who I know is straight
120.552	than where there's any possible question
124.203	of who are they looking out for,
124.203	and what's going on.
126.725	So the most important thing is integrity.
128.733	What's the second most important thing?
130.851	Let's see if you can get this one.
132.501	Audience: Self-confidence.
133.831	DR: Close enough. Passion.
135.878	Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition,
135.878	are people who are leaving something else,
139.715	starting a new world, creating and putting
139.715	their lifeblood into this thing.
143.421	You've got to convey passion.
144.83	If you're not passionate,
146.157	why should anyone else be,
146.157	or put money into your company
149.333	if you're not passionate about it?
151.048	Integrity, passion:
151.048	the most important things.
153.38	Then there's a whole panoply
153.38	of other things you've got to wrap up
156.585	in this package you're presenting to a VC.
158.799	Experience: you've got to be able to say,
160.877	"""Hey, you know, I've done this before."""
163.059	"""Done this before"" is starting"
163.059	an enterprise, creating value,
166.119	and taking something
166.119	from beginning to end.
168.152	That's why VCs love to fund
168.152	serial entrepreneurs --
170.691	even if you didn't do it right
170.691	the first time,
172.867	you've learned the lessons, which puts
172.867	you in good stead the next time.
176.23	Along with the experience of starting
176.23	an enterprise or running something --
179.807	doesn't have to be a business,
181.277	it can be an organization
181.277	in a school, a not-for-profit.
184.007	But experience
184.007	in creating an organization.
186.085	Next: knowledge.
187.26	If you tell me
188.435	you're going to be the developer
188.435	of the map of the human genome,
191.49	you better know what a human genome is;
191.49	I want you to have expertise.
194.904	I don't want somebody who says,
196.413	"""I've got a great idea"
196.413	in a business I know nothing about.
199.16	I don't know who the players are,
199.16	"what the market is like."""
201.963	You've got to know your market, your area.
204.003	And you have to have
204.003	the skills that it takes
206.13	to get a company going.
207.304	Those skills include
207.304	everything from technical skills
210.401	if it's a technology business,
212.147	to marketing and sales
212.147	and management and so on.
214.945	But, you know, not everybody
214.945	has all these skills.
217.651	Very few people have the full set
217.651	of skills it takes to run a company.
221.37	What else do you require?
221.37	Well, leadership.
223.421	You've got to be able to convince us
223.421	that you either have developed a team
226.951	that has all those factors
226.951	in it, or else you can.
229.799	And you have the charisma
229.799	and the management style
232.254	and the ability to get people
232.254	to follow your lead,
235.057	to inspire them, to motivate them
235.057	to be part of your team.
238.369	Having done all that,
239.941	what else do I want to know as a VC?
241.686	I want to know that you have commitment.
243.805	That you are going to be here to the end.
245.79	I want you to say --
245.79	or I want you to convey --
248.436	that you are going to die if you
248.436	have to, with your very last breath,
252.084	your fingernails scratching
252.084	as they draw you out.
254.434	You'll keep my money alive
254.434	and make more from it.
256.934	I don't want someone who'll
256.934	cut and run at the first opportunity.
260.016	Bad things happen.
261.191	There's never been a venture-funded
261.191	company where bad things didn't happen.
264.756	So know that you're committed
264.756	to the very end.
266.925	You've got to have vision
266.925	to see where this is going.
269.545	"I don't want another ""me too"" product."
271.382	I want somebody who can
271.382	change the world out there.
273.832	But on top of that, I need realism,
275.528	Because while changing the world
275.528	is great, it doesn't always happen.
279.709	And before you get to change the world,
281.662	bad things are going to take place;
283.357	you have to deal with that.
284.709	And you have to have rational projections.
286.738	Finally, you're asking for my money --
288.681	not just because it's my money,
288.681	but because it's me.
291.139	You need to be coachable.
292.359	I need to know
292.359	you have the ability to listen.
294.534	We've had a lot of experience.
295.998	People who are VCs or angels
295.998	investing in you have had experience,
299.301	and they'd like to know that you
299.301	want to hear that experience.
302.325	So how do you convey these 10 things
302.325	in 10 minutes without saying them?
305.705	"You can't say, ""I've got"
305.705	"integrity, invest in me!"""
308.104	You've got to do a whole pitch
308.104	that conveys this without conveying it.
311.45	Think about your pitch as a timeline.
313.241	It starts off, you walk in the door.
315.147	They know nothing whatsoever about you.
317.05	You can take them on an emotional --
317.05	all pitches, all sales presentations,
320.705	are emotional at some level.
322.095	You can go up, you can go down, right?
324.015	And it goes from beginning to end.
325.663	You walk in, the first thing
325.663	you've got to do,
327.837	the overall arc of your presentation,
327.837	it's got to start like a rocket.
331.231	You've got maybe 10 seconds --
332.99	between 10 and 30 seconds,
332.99	depending on how long the pitch is --
336.174	to get their attention.
337.722	In my case, I've invested.
339.192	I've gotten millions of dollars
339.192	from PowerPoint pitches.
342.01	"""I've invested millions."""
342.01	That should get you right there.
344.893	This can be a fact
344.893	or something counterintuitive.
347.231	It can be a story or an experience.
348.954	But you've got to grab
348.954	their emotional attention, focused on you,
352.062	within that first few seconds.
353.562	And then from there,
353.562	you've got to take them
355.654	on a very solid, steady, upward path,
355.654	right from beginning to end.
359.542	Everything has to reinforce this.
361.159	And you've got to get better
361.159	and better and better,
363.584	revving up to the very end,
364.98	then you've got to -- boom! --
366.511	knock them out of the park.
367.837	You want to get them
367.837	to such an emotional high
370.02	they're ready to write you a check,
370.02	throw money at you,
372.624	before you leave.
373.799	How do you do that?
374.974	First of all, logical progression.
376.812	Any time you go backwards,
376.812	any time you skip a step --
380.195	imagine walking up a staircase
380.195	where some of the treads are missing,
383.421	or the heights are different.
385.161	You stop, you need to figure out
385.161	a nice, logical progression.
388.078	Start with what the market is:
388.078	Why are you going to do X, Y or Z?
391.326	And then you've got to tell me
391.326	how you're going to do it,
394.041	and what you're going to do.
395.59	And it's got to flow
395.59	from beginning to end.
397.779	You've got to let me know
397.779	there are touchstones,
400.089	to tie in to the rest
400.089	of the world out there.
402.263	For example, reference
402.263	companies I've heard of,
405.585	or basic items in your business.
408.141	I want to know about things
408.141	that I can relate to:
410.918	validators, or anything that tells me
410.918	somebody else has approved this,
414.639	or there's outside validation.
416.366	It can be sales; it can be
416.366	you got an award for something;
419.414	it can be people have done it before;
422.136	it can be your beta tests
422.136	are going great, whatever.
425.14	I want to know validation --
425.14	not just what you're telling me,
428.061	but that somebody
428.061	or something else out there
430.184	says this makes sense.
431.442	And then, I'm looking for the upside;
431.442	I need a believable upside.
434.533	That's two parts; it's got
434.533	to be upside and believable.
437.183	The upside means if you tell me
437.183	that five years out,
439.687	you're making a million dollars a year,
439.687	that's not really upside.
442.77	Telling me you'll be making
442.77	a billion dollars a year --
445.375	that's not believable.
446.55	So it's got to be both.
447.725	On the other hand are things
447.725	that take the emotional level down.
450.77	You have to recover from those.
452.273	For example, anything
452.273	that I know is not true.
454.444	"""We have no competition."
454.444	"Nobody makes a widget like this."""
457.192	Odds are I know somebody
457.192	who's made a widget,
459.32	and the minute you tell me that,
460.952	I discount half of what
460.952	you're saying from then on.
463.604	Anything I don't understand,
466.373	where I have to make the leap
466.373	myself, in my own head,
468.929	will stop the flow of the presentation.
470.881	So you've got to take me
470.881	through like a sixth-grader --
473.486	dub, dub, dub --
473.486	but without patronizing me.
475.573	And it's a very tricky path.
477.16	But if you can do it,
477.16	it works really well.
479.315	Anything that's inconsistent
479.315	within your concept --
483.021	if you tell me sales of X, Y or Z
483.021	are 10 million dollars,
485.721	five slides later,
485.721	they're five million dollars ...
488.179	One may have been gross sales,
488.179	one may have been net sales,
490.987	but I want to know that all the numbers
490.987	make sense together.
493.894	And then, finally: anything
493.894	that's an error or a typo,
496.457	or a stupid mistake or a line
496.457	that's in the wrong place --
499.354	that shows me that if you can't do
499.354	a presentation, how can you run a company?
503.007	So this all feeds in together.
504.903	The best way to do this
504.903	is to look at our betters,
507.28	people who have done this before.
508.899	Let's look at the most successful
508.899	technology executive in the business,
512.301	and see how a presentation goes.
514.538	Bill Gates's PowerPoint
514.538	presentation over here.
516.795	Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.
518.867	Is this how to do a PowerPoint
518.867	presentation? What do you think?
522.017	No. Who do you think we should
522.017	look at as our role model?
524.724	Oh, isn't that funny!
524.724	There's another great one over here.
527.548	OK, Steve Jobs.
528.753	You want absolute --
528.753	this is the Zen of presentation, right?
532.263	Here he is, one little guy,
532.263	black jeans and stuff,
535.073	on a totally empty stage.
536.289	What are you focusing on?
537.891	You're focusing on him!
537.891	This is Steve Jobs.
539.964	So are these wonderful long bullet points,
539.964	whole list of things good?
543.948	No, they're not. The long
543.948	bullet points are bad.
546.503	What's good? Short. Short bullet points.
549.112	But you know what? Even better than short
549.112	bullet points are no bullet points.
552.792	Just give me the headline.
554.061	And you know what?
555.236	How many bullet points
555.236	does Steve Jobs use?
557.284	Basically, none.
558.679	What do you do?
559.855	Best of all, images. Just a simple image.
562.715	I look at the image;
562.715	a picture's worth a thousand words.
565.37	You look at the image
565.37	and you've got the whole thing.
567.878	Then you come back to me; you're focused
567.878	on me, why I'm such a great guy,
571.336	why you want to invest,
571.336	why this all makes sense.
573.67	That said, we only have a very short time,
575.785	so let's run through the things
575.785	to include in your presentation.
578.847	First of all, none of these big,
578.847	long-titled slides
581.352	with blah, blah, I'm presenting
581.352	to so-and-so on X date.
583.955	I know the day, I know who I am --
583.955	I don't need all that.
586.701	Just give me your company logo.
588.225	I look at the logo,
588.225	and it ties it to my brain.
590.456	Then I come back to you.
590.456	I'm focused on you, OK?
593.876	You give me your quick, 15-second
593.876	or 30-second intro, grab my attention.
597.825	Then you give me
597.825	a quick business overview.
599.854	This is not a five-minute pitch.
599.854	This is, you know, two sentences.
603.005	"""We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."""
605.058	"Or, ""We sell services to help do X."""
605.058	You know, whatever.
607.744	And that is like the picture
607.744	on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.
610.932	That lets me know the context.
612.413	It gives me the armature for the whole
612.413	thing you'll be going through;
615.689	it lets me put everything
615.689	in relation to what you've told me.
618.575	Then you've got to walk me through,
618.575	show me who your management team is.
622.881	I want to know the size of the market.
622.881	Why is this market worth getting at?
626.454	I want to know your product,
626.454	that's very important.
628.888	Now, this is not
628.888	a product pitch or sales pitch.
631.163	I don't want to know all the ins and outs,
631.163	just what the heck is it?
634.38	If it's a website, show me
634.38	a screenshot of your website.
637.466	Don't do a live demo.
637.466	Never do a live demo.
639.502	Do a canned demo,
639.502	or something that lets me know
641.776	why people are going
641.776	to buy whatever it is.
643.958	Now that I know what you're selling,
646.222	tell me how you make money on it.
647.821	For every X you sell, you get Y,
647.821	or services of Z.
652.327	I want to know what the business model
652.327	is on a per-unit basis,
655.297	or for the actual product you're selling.
657.281	I want to know who you're selling to
657.281	in terms of customers
660.025	and if you have any special
660.025	relationships that will help you,
662.935	whether it's a distribution relationship
662.935	or a producing partner.
665.969	Again, validation.
667.144	This helps to say you're bigger
667.144	than just one little thing over here.
670.419	But everybody has competition.
671.879	There's never been a company
671.879	with no competition,
674.213	even if the competition
674.213	is the old way of doing something.
676.966	I want to know exactly
676.966	what your competition is,
679.27	and that will help me judge
679.27	how you fit into the whole operation.
682.361	I want to know how you're special.
684.048	I know what your competition does --
685.794	how are you going to prevent
685.794	them from eating your lunch?
688.493	All this ties into the financial overview.
690.525	And you can't do a VC pitch
690.525	without giving me your financials.
693.477	I want to know a year or two back,
693.477	or as long as you've been in existence.
697.007	And I want to know
697.007	four or five years forward.
699.276	Five is a bit much. Probably four.
700.929	And I want to know how that business
700.929	model, on a product basis,
703.919	will translate into a company model:
703.919	How many widgets will you sell?
707.147	You make X amount per widget.
707.147	I want to know what the driver is.
710.174	We'll have 1,000 customers
710.174	this year and 10,000 the next,
712.869	our revenues will do this and that.
714.564	That gives me the whole picture
714.564	for the next several years
717.309	into which I'm investing.
718.527	And I want to know how the money
718.527	from me will help you get there.
721.612	You're going to open
721.612	an offshore plant in China,
723.877	you're going to spend it all
723.877	on sales and marketing,
726.34	you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever.
728.227	But then comes the ask,
728.227	where you tell me how much you want.
731.067	You're looking for 5 million --
731.067	at what valuation?
733.562	Two million? 100,000?
735.796	What's the money in so far? Who invested?
737.795	I hope you invested -- if you can't invest
737.795	in your own thing, why should I?
741.806	So I like to know if you have
741.806	friends and family,
744.12	or angel investors, or more VCs before.
746.009	What's the capital structure
746.009	up until this point?
748.379	Finally, having done all that,
748.379	you've now told me the whole thing,
751.507	so now you bring it back
751.507	to that conclusion.
754.022	This is that rocket going up.
755.442	Hopefully everything has been positive.
757.336	And everything you say clicks,
757.336	it all makes sense.
759.807	"And I'm thinking, ""This is really great!"""
761.808	Then you take me back
761.808	to just your logo on the screen.
764.379	And I look at the logo -- OK, good.
766.16	Now I come back to you.
766.16	Nothing else to look at, right?
768.764	Now you've got to wrap it up
768.764	to give me the final -- boom! --
772.311	the final pitch that's going
772.311	to send me into space.
774.724	Now, in the process of doing this,
776.8	how do you remember
776.8	the sequences and do it?
779.279	You've noticed I'm not looking
779.279	at the screen, right?
781.74	The screen is in front of me,
783.326	so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.
785.161	So how do I know what's going on?
786.76	Well, I have a laptop in front of me.
788.578	You're looking at me and at this.
790.177	What am I looking at?
791.352	You think that I'm looking at that?
793.048	No, I'm looking, actually,
794.358	at a special version
794.358	of PowerPoint over here,
796.722	which shows me the slides
796.722	ahead and behind, my notes,
799.452	so I can see what's going on.
800.873	PowerPoint has this built into
800.873	every copy of it that's shipped.
803.871	If you use Apple's Keynote,
803.871	it's got an even better version.
806.714	There's another program called
806.714	Ovation you can get from Adobe
809.771	that they bought last summer,
811.18	which helps you run the timers
811.18	and lets you figure out what's going on.
814.891	So, here's my wrap-up
814.891	to take you to the moon, right?
817.473	I usually do a Top 10,
817.473	but we don't have time,
819.651	so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.
821.564	Number five: always use presenter mode,
823.927	or Ovation, or presenter tools.
826.324	It lets you know
826.324	exactly where you're going,
828.428	helps you pace yourself,
828.428	gives you a timer, the whole bit.
831.328	Number four: always use remote control.
833.218	Have you seen me touch
833.218	the computer? No. Why not?
835.541	Because I'm using remote control.
835.541	Always use remote control.
838.382	Number three: the handouts you give
838.382	are not your presentation.
841.336	If you follow my suggestions,
842.748	you'll have a very spare,
842.748	Zen-like presentation,
845.023	which is great to convey who you are
845.023	and get people emotionally involved,
848.479	but not good as a handout.
849.749	You want a handout that gives more
849.749	information; it has to stand without you.
853.35	Number two: don't read your speech.
853.35	Can you imagine?
855.903	"(Reading) ""You should invest"
855.903	"in my company ... """
858.172	It doesn't work.
859.348	And the number one presentation tip:
859.348	never, ever look at the screen.
862.973	You're making a connection
862.973	with your audience,
865.181	and you always want
865.181	a one-on-one connection.
867.683	The screen should come up behind you
869.742	and supplement what you're doing,
869.742	instead of replace you.
872.437	And that is how to pitch to a VC.
