12.19	So infectious diseases, right?
13.72	Infectious diseases 
13.72	are still the main cause
15.87	of human suffering and death 
15.87	around the world.
18.197	Every year, millions of people die
18.197	of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,
23.367	around the world 
23.367	and even in the United States.
25.713	Every year, thousands of Americans
25.713	die of seasonal flu.
29.319	Now of course, humans,
29.319	we are creative. Right?
31.474	We have come up with ways to protect
31.474	ourselves against these diseases.
34.799	We have drugs and vaccines.
36.104	And we're conscious --
36.104	we learn from our experiences
39.489	and come up with creative solutions.
41.416	We used to think we're alone in this,
41.416	but now we know we're not.
44.481	We're not the only medical doctors.
46.3	Now we know that there's a lot of animals
46.3	out there that can do it too.
49.706	Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.
51.33	Not so much different from us,
52.831	they can use plants
52.831	to treat their intestinal parasites.
55.696	But the last few decades have shown us
55.696	that other animals can do it too:
59.143	elephants, porcupines,
59.143	sheep, goats, you name it.
62.522	And even more interesting than that
62.522	is that recent discoveries are telling us
66.161	that insects and other little animals with
66.161	smaller brains can use medication too.
71.603	The problem with infectious diseases,
71.603	as we all know,
74.132	is that pathogens continue to evolve,
76.081	and a lot of the drugs
76.081	that we have developed
78.317	are losing their efficacy.
79.976	And therefore, there is this great need
79.976	to find new ways to discover drugs
84.209	that we can use against our diseases.
86.113	Now, I think that we
86.113	should look at these animals,
88.667	and we can learn from them
88.667	how to treat our own diseases.
92.331	As a biologist, I have been studying
92.331	monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.
96.631	Now, monarchs are extremely famous
96.631	for their spectacular migrations
99.999	from the U.S. and Canada
99.999	down to Mexico every year,
103.109	where millions of them come together,
105.129	but it's not why I started studying them.
107.66	I study monarchs because they get sick.
110.051	They get sick like you.
110.051	They get sick like me.
112.513	And I think what they do
112.513	can tell us a lot about drugs
115.2	that we can develop for humans.
117.412	Now, the parasites
117.412	that monarchs get infected with
119.847	are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha --
119.847	a mouthful.
123.726	What they do is they produce spores,
125.492	millions of spores
125.492	on the outside of the butterfly
127.884	that are shown as little specks
127.884	in between the scales of the butterfly.
131.261	And this is really detrimental
131.261	to the monarch.
133.619	It shortens their lifespan,
135.267	it reduces their ability to fly,
137.372	it can even kill them
137.372	before they're even adults.
139.879	Very detrimental parasite.
141.76	As part of my job, I spend a lot of time
141.76	in the greenhouse growing plants,
145.916	and the reason for this is that monarchs
145.916	are extremely picky eaters.
149.469	They only eat milkweed as larvae.
151.464	Luckily, there are several
151.464	species of milkweed that they can use,
154.549	and all these milkweeds
154.549	have cardenolides in them.
156.905	These are chemicals that are toxic.
158.699	They're toxic to most animals,
158.699	but not to monarchs.
161.094	In fact, monarchs
161.094	can take up the chemicals,
163.316	put it in their own bodies,
163.316	and it makes them toxic
165.724	against their predators, such as birds.
168.003	And what they do, then,
168.003	is advertise this toxicity
170.377	through their beautiful
170.377	warning colorations
172.398	with this orange, black and white.
174.476	So what I did during my job
174.476	is grow plants in the greenhouse,
178.348	different ones, different milkweeds.
180.094	Some were toxic, including
180.094	the tropical milkweed,
182.848	with very high concentrations
182.848	of these cardenolides.
186.137	And some were not toxic.
187.315	And then I fed them to monarchs.
189.635	Some of the monarchs were healthy.
189.635	They had no disease.
192.258	But some of the monarchs were sick,
194.033	and what I found is that
194.033	some of these milkweeds are medicinal,
197.056	meaning they reduce the disease symptoms
197.056	in the monarch butterflies,
200.293	meaning these monarchs can live longer
200.293	when they are infected
203.41	when feeding on these medicinal plants.
205.324	And when I found this, I had this idea,
208.035	and a lot of people said
208.035	it was a crazy idea,
210.343	but I thought, 
210.343	what if monarchs can use this?
212.817	What if they can use these plants
212.817	as their own form of medicine?
215.876	What if they can act as medical doctors?
218.828	So my team and I
218.828	started doing experiments.
220.854	In the first types of experiments,
222.655	we had caterpillars,
222.655	and gave them a choice:
224.825	medicinal milkweed versus
224.825	non-medicinal milkweed.
227.566	And then we measured how much they ate
227.566	of each species over their lifetime.
231.186	And the result, as so often 
231.186	in science, was boring:
234.2	Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.
234.2	Fifty percent was not.
238.451	These caterpillars didn't do
238.451	anything for their own welfare.
242.611	So then we moved on to adult butterflies,
244.686	and we started asking the question
246.577	whether it's the mothers
246.577	that can medicate their offspring.
249.735	Can the mothers lay their eggs
249.735	on medicinal milkweed
252.509	that will make their
252.509	future offspring less sick?
255.708	We have done these experiments now
255.708	over several years,
258.236	and always get the same results.
260.024	What we do is we put
260.024	a monarch in a big cage,
262.186	a medicinal plant on one side,
262.186	a non-medicinal plant on the other side,
265.669	and then we measure the number of eggs
265.669	that the monarchs lay on each plant.
270.245	And what we find when we do that
270.245	is always the same.
273.354	What we find is that the monarchs
273.354	strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.
276.947	In other words,
276.947	what these females are doing
279.048	is they're laying 68 percent
279.048	of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
282.392	Intriguingly, what they do
282.392	is they actually transmit the parasites
286.612	when they're laying the eggs.
288.077	They cannot prevent this.
289.512	They can also not medicate themselves.
291.443	But what these experiments tell us
293.68	is that these monarchs, these mothers,
293.68	can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed
298.509	that will make their
298.509	future offspring less sick.
303.058	Now, this is a really
303.058	important discovery, I think,
305.581	not just because it tells us
305.581	something cool about nature,
308.415	but also because it may tell us something
308.415	more about how we should find drugs.
312.101	Now, these are animals that are very small
314.101	and we tend to think of them
314.101	as very simple.
316.2	They have tiny little brains,
317.757	yet they can do this
317.757	very sophisticated medication.
320.811	Now, we know that even today,
320.811	most of our drugs
323.389	derive from natural products,
323.389	including plants,
326.148	and in indigenous cultures,
327.76	traditional healers often look
327.76	at animals to find new drugs.
330.595	In this way, elephants have told us
330.595	how to treat stomach upset,
334.002	and porcupines have told people
334.002	how to treat bloody diarrhea.
337.291	What I think is important, 
337.291	though, is to move beyond
339.946	these large-brained mammals
339.946	and give these guys more credit,
343.754	these simple animals, these insects
343.754	that we tend to think of
346.656	as very, very simple
346.656	with tiny little brains.
349.905	The discovery that these animals
349.905	can also use medication
353.876	opens up completely new avenues,
356.355	and I think that maybe one day,
356.355	we will be treating human diseases
361.069	with drugs that were first
361.069	discovered by butterflies,
364.178	and I think that is an amazing opportunity
364.178	worth pursuing.
368.153	Thank you so much.
370.316	(Applause)
