13.573	Cancer.
15.121	Many of us have lost family,
15.121	friends or loved ones
18.21	to this horrible disease.
19.914	I know there are some of you
19.914	in the audience
22.034	who are cancer survivors,
23.299	or who are fighting cancer at this moment.
25.478	My heart goes out to you.
27.493	While this word often conjures up
27.493	emotions of sadness and anger and fear,
32.791	I bring you good news
32.791	from the front lines of cancer research.
36.329	The fact is, we are starting to win
36.329	the war on cancer.
41.138	In fact, we lie at the intersection
42.865	of the three of the most exciting
42.865	developments within cancer research.
47.078	The first is cancer genomics.
49.387	The genome is a composition
51.436	of all the genetic information
51.436	encoded by DNA
54.396	in an organism.
55.787	In cancers, changes
55.787	in the DNA called mutations
58.652	are what drive these cancers
58.652	to go out of control.
61.89	Around 10 years ago,
61.89	I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins
65.206	that first mapped
65.206	the mutations of cancers.
67.828	We did this first for colorectal,
70.038	breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.
72.984	And since then, there have been
72.984	over 90 projects in 70 countries
76.52	all over the world,
78.134	working to understand
78.134	the genetic basis of these diseases.
81.533	Today, tens of thousands
81.533	of cancers are understood
84.611	down to exquisite molecular detail.
88.02	The second revolution
88.02	is precision medicine,
90.346	"also known as ""personalized medicine."""
92.774	Instead of one-size-fits-all methods
92.774	to be able to treat cancers,
96.375	there is a whole new class of drugs
96.375	that are able to target cancers
100.054	based on their unique genetic profile.
102.737	Today, there are a host
102.737	of these tailor-made drugs,
105.691	called targeted therapies,
107.045	available to physicians even today
109.252	to be able to personalize
109.252	their therapy for their patients,
112.539	and many others are in development.
115.116	The third exciting revolution
115.116	is immunotherapy,
118.438	and this is really exciting.
120.865	Scientists have been able
120.865	to leverage the immune system
123.599	in the fight against cancer.
125.652	For example, there have been ways
125.652	where we find the off switches of cancer,
129.872	and new drugs have been able
129.872	to turn the immune system back on,
133.34	to be able to fight cancer.
134.952	In addition, there are ways
134.952	where you can take away immune cells
139.067	from the body,
140.251	train them, engineer them
140.251	and put them back into the body
143.362	to fight cancer.
144.763	Almost sounds like
144.763	science fiction, doesn't it?
147.91	While I was a researcher
147.91	at the National Cancer Institute,
150.95	I had the privilege of working
150.95	with some of the pioneers of this field
154.429	and watched the development firsthand.
156.699	It's been pretty amazing.
158.166	Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,
161.195	actively recruiting patients
161.195	to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.
166.484	While these three exciting
166.484	revolutions are ongoing,
169.569	unfortunately, this is only the beginning,
171.617	and there are still many, many challenges.
174.852	Let me illustrate with a patient.
178.021	Here is a patient
178.021	with a skin cancer called melanoma.
180.956	It's horrible; the cancer
180.956	has gone everywhere.
185.026	However, scientists were able
185.026	to map the mutations of this cancer
188.77	and give a specific treatment
188.77	that targets one of the mutations.
193.77	And the result is almost miraculous.
196.247	Tumors almost seem to melt away.
199.73	Unfortunately, this is not
199.73	the end of the story.
202.897	A few months later, this picture is taken.
205.977	The tumor has come back.
208.447	The question is: Why?
210.712	The answer is tumor heterogeneity.
213.927	Let me explain.
216.944	Even a cancer as small
216.944	as one centimeter in diameter
220.456	harbors over a hundred million
220.456	different cells.
223.668	While genetically similar,
225.573	there are small differences
225.573	in these different cancers
228.306	that make them differently prone
228.306	to different drugs.
231.187	So even if you have a drug
231.187	that's highly effective,
233.639	that kills almost all the cells,
235.398	there is a chance
235.398	that there's a small population
238.612	that's resistant to the drug.
240.41	This ultimately is the population
242.456	that comes back,
243.644	and takes over the patient.
245.707	So then the question is:
245.707	What do we do with this information?
248.59	Well, the key, then,
249.876	is to apply all these exciting
249.876	advancements in cancer therapy earlier,
254.77	as soon as we can,
256.016	before these resistance clones emerge.
259.05	The key to cancer and curing cancer
259.05	is early detection.
264.259	And we intuitively know this.
265.952	Finding cancer early
265.952	results in better outcomes,
269.062	and the numbers show this as well.
271.132	For example, in ovarian cancer,
271.132	if you detect cancer in stage four,
275.399	only 17 percent of the women
275.399	survive at five years.
279.088	However, if you are able to detect
279.088	this cancer as early as stage one,
283.54	over 92 percent of women will survive.
286.745	But the sad fact is, only 15 percent
286.745	of women are detected at stage one,
291.572	whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,
291.572	are detected in stages three and four.
297.168	We desperately need
297.168	better detection mechanisms for cancers.
301.873	The current best ways to screen cancer
301.873	fall into one of three categories.
306.175	First is medical procedures,
308.374	which is like colonoscopy
308.374	for colon cancer.
311.306	Second is protein biomarkers,
311.306	like PSA for prostate cancer.
315.946	Or third, imaging techniques,
318.882	such as mammography for breast cancer.
322.239	Medical procedures are the gold standard;
324.689	however, they are highly invasive
326.809	and require a large
326.809	infrastructure to implement.
330.502	Protein markers, while effective
330.502	in some populations,
333.73	are not very specific
333.73	in some circumstances,
336.243	resulting in high numbers
336.243	of false positives,
338.85	which then results in unnecessary work-ups
338.85	and unnecessary procedures.
345.142	Imaging methods,
345.142	while useful in some populations,
348.781	expose patients to harmful radiation.
351.702	In addition, it is not applicable
351.702	to all patients.
354.34	For example, mammography has problems
354.34	in women with dense breasts.
358.856	So what we need is a method
358.856	that is noninvasive,
362.274	that is light in infrastructure,
364.065	that is highly specific,
365.968	that also does not have false positives,
369.213	does not use any radiation
371.203	and is applicable to large populations.
374.158	Even more importantly,
375.356	we need a method
375.356	to be able to detect cancers
377.576	before they're 100 million cells in size.
380.88	Does such a technology exist?
382.828	Well, I wouldn't be up here
382.828	giving a talk if it didn't.
386.722	I'm excited to tell you about
386.722	this latest technology we've developed.
391.035	Central to our technology
391.035	is a simple blood test.
394.202	The blood circulatory system,
394.202	while seemingly mundane,
397.956	is essential for you to survive,
400.31	providing oxygen
400.31	and nutrients to your cells,
402.839	and removing waste and carbon dioxide.
405.468	Here's a key biological insight:
408.24	Cancer cells grow and die
408.24	faster than normal cells,
411.347	and when they die,
412.567	DNA is shed into the blood system.
415.312	Since we know the signatures
415.312	of these cancer cells
418.106	from all the different cancer
418.106	genome sequencing projects,
420.834	we can look for those signals in the blood
422.899	to be able to detect these cancers early.
426.229	So instead of waiting for cancers
426.229	to be large enough to cause symptoms,
430.052	or for them to be dense enough
430.052	to show up on imaging,
432.975	or for them to be prominent enough
435.441	for you to be able to visualize
435.441	on medical procedures,
438.705	we can start looking for cancers
438.705	while they are relatively pretty small,
442.721	by looking for these small amounts
442.721	of DNA in the blood.
447.635	So let me tell you how we do this.
449.334	First, like I said, we start off
449.334	with a simple blood test --
452.222	no radiation, no complicated equipment --
454.821	a simple blood test.
456.311	Then the blood is shipped to us,
457.871	and what we do
457.871	is extract the DNA out of it.
460.93	While your body is mostly healthy cells,
463.35	most of the DNA that's detected
463.35	will be from healthy cells.
467.654	However, there will be a small amount,
467.654	less than one percent,
470.745	that comes from the cancer cells.
473.365	Then we use molecular biology methods
473.365	to be able to enrich this DNA
477.595	for areas of the genome which are known
477.595	to be associated with cancer,
482.031	based on the information
482.031	from the cancer genomics projects.
485.484	We're able to then put this DNA
485.484	into DNA-sequencing machines
489.385	and are able to digitize the DNA
489.385	into A's, C's, T's and G's
494.099	and have this final readout.
496.271	Ultimately, we have information
496.271	of billions of letters
502.285	that output from this run.
506.455	We then apply statistical
506.455	and computational methods
509.699	to be able to find
509.699	the small signal that's present,
512.395	indicative of the small amount
512.395	of cancer DNA in the blood.
517.098	So does this actually work in patients?
519.547	Well, because there's no way
519.547	of really predicting right now
523.061	which patients will get cancer,
524.593	we use the next best population:
527.261	cancers in remission;
529.372	specifically, lung cancer.
532.225	The sad fact is, even with the best drugs
532.225	that we have today,
535.558	most lung cancers come back.
537.794	The key, then, is to see
539.118	whether we're able to detect
539.118	these recurrences of cancers
542.793	earlier than with standard methods.
545.159	We just finished a major trial
547.56	with Professor Charles Swanton
547.56	at University College London,
551.331	examining this.
552.521	Let me walk you through
552.521	an example of one patient.
556.586	Here's an example of one patient
556.586	who undergoes surgery
559.437	at time point zero,
560.629	and then undergoes chemotherapy.
563.529	Then the patient is under remission.
566.038	He is monitored using clinical exams
566.038	and imaging methods.
570.969	Around day 450, unfortunately,
570.969	the cancer comes back.
577.086	The question is:
577.086	Are we able to catch this earlier?
579.595	During this whole time,
579.595	we've been collecting blood serially
583.364	to be able to measure
583.364	the amount of ctDNA in the blood.
587.38	So at the initial time point, as expected,
590.701	there's a high level
590.701	of cancer DNA in the blood.
594.423	However, this goes away to zero
594.423	in subsequent time points
598.114	and remains negligible
598.114	after subsequent points.
602.813	However, around day 340, we see the rise
602.813	of cancer DNA in the blood,
608.11	and eventually, it goes up higher
608.11	for days 400 and 450.
613.235	Here's the key, if you've missed it:
615.691	At day 340, we see the rise
615.691	in the cancer DNA in the blood.
620.696	That means we are catching this cancer
620.696	over a hundred days earlier
624.936	than traditional methods.
626.921	This is a hundred days earlier
626.921	where we can give therapies,
629.758	a hundred days earlier
629.758	where we can do surgical interventions,
633.101	or even a hundred days less
633.101	for the cancer to grow
636.158	or a hundred days less
636.158	for resistance to occur.
640.502	For some patients, this hundred days
640.502	means the matter of life and death.
645.237	We're really excited
645.237	about this information.
648.359	Because of this assignment,
648.359	we've done additional studies now
651.48	in other cancers,
652.766	including breast cancer, lung cancer
656.125	and ovarian cancer,
657.888	and I can't wait to see how much earlier
657.888	we can find these cancers.
664.174	Ultimately, I have a dream,
666.214	a dream of two vials of blood,
669.356	and that, in the future, as part of all
669.356	of our standard physical exams,
673.245	we'll have two vials of blood drawn.
675.641	And from these two vials of blood
675.641	we will be able to compare
679.007	the DNA from all known
679.007	signatures of cancer,
682.542	and hopefully then detect cancers
682.542	months to even years earlier.
687.179	Even with the therapies we have currently,
689.374	this could mean that millions
689.374	of lives could be saved.
691.999	And if you add on to that
691.999	recent advancements in immunotherapy
696.194	and targeted therapies,
697.51	the end of cancer is in sight.
700.754	"The next time you hear the word ""cancer,"""
702.935	I want you to add to the emotions: hope.
706.123	Hold on.
708.162	Cancer researchers all around the world
708.162	are working feverishly
711.759	to beat this disease,
712.939	and tremendous progress is being made.
715.776	This is the beginning of the end.
718.2	We will win the war on cancer.
720.681	And to me, this is amazing news.
723.013	Thank you.
724.204	(Applause)
