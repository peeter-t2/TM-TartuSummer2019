17.69	This sound,
21.113	this smell,
24.848	this sight
28.953	all remind me of the campfires of my childhood,
32.481	when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.
39.877	There was this wondrous ending
42.8	when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.
47.366	It was dreaming time.
51.347	Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming,
54.684	although I'm known to make my dreams come true.
58.394	Last year, I created a one-man show.
61.685	For an hour and a half I shared with the audience
65.918	a lifetime of creativity,
68.585	how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.
73.019	And then TED challenged me:
75.368	"""Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"""
78.533	(Laughter)
79.923	Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.
83.45	But here I am.
85.713	One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery
88.075	in which every syllable, every second will have its importance
90.276	and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.
92.041	No, no, no.
93.459	No, the best way for me to start
96.34	is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.
100.009	So please join me for a minute of silence.
121.286	Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.
123.446	But hey, we're on TED time.
126.164	When I was six years old,
128.221	I fell in love with magic.
131.019	For Christmas I got a magic box
133.438	and a very old book on card manipulation.
137.893	Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation
141.046	than in all the silly little tricks in the box.
145.279	So I looked in the book for the most difficult move,
148.545	and it was this.
152.167	Now I'm not supposed to share that with you,
154.06	but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.
159.357	Now that manipulation
161.86	was broken down into seven moves
165.32	described over seven pages.
168.434	One, two, three,
171.029	four, five, six and seven.
174.643	And let me show you something else.
176.244	The cards were bigger than my hands.
186.693	Two months later, six years old,
189.296	I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
192.555	And I go to see a famous magician
194.695	"and proudly ask him, ""Well what do you think?"""
197.421	Six years old.
198.761	"The magician looked at me and said, ""This is a disaster."
202.143	You cannot do that in two seconds
205.029	and have a minuscule part of the card showing.
208.494	For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second
213.978	"and it has to be perfect."""
218.1	Two years later, one -- zoop.
222.713	And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.
230.53	Passion is the motto
236.899	of all my actions.
239.091	As I'm studying magic,
243.301	juggling is mentioned repeatedly
245.918	as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.
250.486	Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly
254.801	jugglers make objects fly.
257.035	So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.
260.963	I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,
264.751	and he agrees to sell me three clubs.
269.202	But in America you have to explain. What are clubs?
271.369	Nothing to do with golf.
272.885	They are those beautiful oblong objects,
277.419	but quite difficult to make.
279.019	They have to be precisely lathed.
280.885	Oh, when I was buying the clubs,
283.053	somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.
286.202	Well I didn't think much of it at the time.
288.552	Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.
292.518	But I could not understand.
294.854	I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.
298.62	The clubs were escaping me at each throw.
301.802	And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.
304.819	Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,
308.952	the world's greatest juggler.
311.12	And he was frowning.
312.635	"And he finally asked, ""Can I see those?"""
315.052	So I proudly showed him my clubs.
317.418	"He said, ""Philippe, you have been had."
319.835	These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.
323.236	"They are impossible to juggle."""
328.387	Tenacity is how I kept at it
334.752	against all odds.
336.634	So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,
340.186	and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.
342.668	It was more interesting; I heard.
344.586	I heard about those amazing men and women
346.953	who walk on thin air --
349.638	the high-wire walkers.
352.494	Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,
356.156	so that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.
360.879	I found two trees --
365.352	but not any kind of trees,
367.538	trees with character --
370.007	and then a very long rope.
371.756	And I put the rope around and around
373.541	and around and around and around till I had no more rope.
376.006	Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.
378.523	I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,
381.043	and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.
386.475	So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
390.093	What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.
393.571	So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots
397.41	and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.
400.593	Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.
404.604	So I cut one rope off.
406.647	And the next day one rope off.
408.392	And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.
413.191	Now you can imagine at that time
414.991	I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.
419.425	So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try --
424.392	this is how not to learn wire walking.
427.862	(Laughter)
429.376	Intuition is a tool essential in my life.
437.908	In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools
442.526	because instead of listening to the teachers,
444.194	I am my own teacher, progressing in my new art
448.225	and becoming a street juggler.
451.359	On the high wire, within months,
454.01	I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,
456.692	except I am not satisfied.
459.275	I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.
467.536	But nobody wanted to hire me.
470.24	So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.
475.659	Notre Dame,
479.545	the Sydney Harbor Bridge,
483.583	the World Trade Center.
486.677	And I developed a certitude, a faith
488.95	that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.
492.51	If not, I will never do that first step.
495.262	Well nonetheless,
497.461	on the top of the World Trade Center
500.474	my first step was terrifying.
508.371	All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.
512.644	Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.
515.48	The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall
518.76	whose chilling power I no longer feel.
522.493	I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.
525.359	I step over the beam.
527.091	I put my left foot on the cable,
530.489	the weight of my body raised on my right leg
533.858	anchored to the flank of the building.
537.138	Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?
540.957	My right leg will be unburdened,
543.474	my right foot will freely meet the wire.
546.977	On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.
551.549	On the other, the universe of the clouds,
554.274	so full of unknown we think it's empty.
557.842	At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.
564.057	It's a straight line, which sags,
567.438	which sways, which vibrates,
570.959	which rolls on itself,
572.523	which is ice,
574.258	which is three tons tight, ready to explode,
578.627	ready to swallow me.
581.241	An inner howl assails me,
584.207	the wild longing to flee.
587.224	But it is too late.
589.691	The wire is ready.
592.341	Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.
604.978	Faith is what replaces doubt
609.473	in my dictionary.
611.503	So after the walk
612.729	"people ask me, ""How can you top that?"""
614.573	Well I didn't have that problem.
616.878	I was not interested in collecting the gigantic,
619.48	in breaking records.
621.562	In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing
626.591	at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks --
630.141	or some completely different type of performance.
635.057	Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example.
641.219	So each time
643.687	I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement
646.908	and enter as the improvising comic silent character
651.751	I created 45 years ago,
653.676	I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.
657.723	But this here,
659.678	this is not the street.
662.009	So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.
664.585	So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?
666.758	You know that, right?
668.124	You don't want me to juggle, right?
670.373	(Applause)
678.595	(Music)
790.46	(Applause)
795.498	Thank you. Thank you.
809.98	Each time I street juggle
812.932	I use improvisation.
824.025	Now improvisation is empowering
826.227	because it welcomes the unknown.
830.427	And since what's impossible is always unknown,
834.559	it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.
842.149	Now I have done the impossible not once,
844.593	but many times.
846.778	So what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.
849.224	Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival
853.895	by a high-wire walk.
855.861	And I chose to put my wire
857.71	between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem
861.713	over the Ben Hinnom Valley.
863.644	And I thought it would be incredible
865.811	if in the middle of the wire
867.634	I stopped and, like a magician,
869.617	I produce a dove and send her in the sky
873.382	as a living symbol of peace.
875.732	Well now I must say,
878.549	it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.
881.533	And in my hotel room,
884.457	each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,
889.437	she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
892.056	So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.
894.821	I mean, a bird needs space to fly.
896.57	It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.
898.822	Now comes the day of the walk.
902.203	Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.
905.853	The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.
910.437	But he seemed nervous.
913.322	There was tension in my wire,
915.571	but I also could feel tension on the ground.
917.686	Because all those people
919.004	were made up of people who, for the most part,
922.103	considered each other enemies.
924.988	So I start the walk. Everything is fine.
927.724	I stop in the middle.
929.502	I make the dove appear.
932.221	People applaud in delight.
934.137	And then in the most magnificent gesture,
936.906	I send the bird of peace into the azure.
940.437	But the bird, instead of flying away,
942.186	goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.
945.237	(Laughter)
947.321	And people scream.
949.22	So I grab the dove,
951.838	and for the second time I send her in the air.
956.634	But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,
959.807	goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.
963.854	(Laughter)
965.17	You laugh, you laugh. But hey.
967.425	I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.
970.854	Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.
974.073	They must think this guy with this dove,
976.437	he must have spent years working with him.
978.603	What a genius, what a professional.
980.02	(Laughter)
981.991	So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.
984.97	And at the end I bang my hand against the pole
987.038	to dislodge the bird.
988.555	Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,
992.204	does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop
994.955	and ends up on the wire behind me.
996.988	And the entire valley goes crazy.
1000.004	Now but hold on, I'm not finished.
1002.087	So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival
1004.621	and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.
1007.27	And something happened.
1008.853	Somebody somewhere, a group of people,
1011.322	starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.
1014.504	And within seconds the entire valley
1016.353	is applauding in unison with each of my steps.
1020.337	But not an applause of delight like before,
1022.47	an applause encouragement.
1025.854	For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
1030.019	They had become one, pushing me to triumph.
1034.968	I want you just for a second
1037.635	to experience this amazing human symphony.
1040.648	So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.
1043.784	So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.
1047.684	(Clapping)
1053.898	(Applause)
1060.323	So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.
1063.179	And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me
1066.832	in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.
1069.267	He didn't know the true story.
1070.684	And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation
1074.332	to solve in this hard-to-manage city,
1076.732	instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,
1079.75	"""If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"""
1082.083	and he goes back to work.
1085.702	Inspiration.
1094.728	By inspiring ourselves
1097.176	we inspire others.
1099.366	I will never forget this music,
1101.149	and I hope now neither will you.
1103.666	Please take this music with you home,
1106.398	and start gluing feathers to your arms
1109.904	and take off and fly,
1112.222	and look at the world from a different perspective.
1118.23	And when you see mountains,
1120.675	remember mountains can be moved.
1123.468	(Applause)
1131.6	Thank you. Thank you.
1134.618	Thank you.
1138.29	(Applause)
