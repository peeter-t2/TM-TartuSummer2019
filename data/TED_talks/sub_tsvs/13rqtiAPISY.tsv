12.738	This is a vending machine in Los Angeles.
14.746	It's in a shopping mall,
14.746	and it sells fish eggs.
17.887	It's a caviar-vending machine.
21.837	This is the Art-o-mat,
21.837	an art-vending machine
23.974	that sells small artistic creations
23.974	by different artists,
26.708	usually on small wood blocks
26.708	or matchboxes, in limited edition.
30.423	This is Oliver Medvedik.
31.616	He is not a vending machine,
31.616	but he is one of the founders of Genspace,
35.136	a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,
37.127	where anybody can go and take classes
38.922	and learn how to do things
38.922	like grow E. coli that glows in the dark
42.1	or learn how to take strawberry DNA.
43.876	In fact, I saw Oliver do
43.876	one of these strawberry DNA extractions
46.951	about a year ago, and this is what led me
46.951	into this bizarre path
50.012	that I'm going to talk to you right now.
51.978	Strawberry DNA is really fascinating,
51.978	because it's so beautiful.
55.048	I'd never thought about DNA
55.048	being a beautiful thing before,
57.856	before I saw it in this form.
59.271	A lot of people, especially
59.271	in the art community,
61.597	don't necessarily engage
61.597	in science in this way.
63.867	I instantly joined Genspace after this,
65.766	"and asked Oliver, ""If we can do"
65.766	this with strawberries,
68.374	"can we do this with people?"""
69.785	About 10 minutes later,
69.785	we were both spitting in vials,
72.438	coming up with a protocol
72.438	for human DNA extraction.
74.98	I started doing this on my own.
76.507	This is what my DNA actually looks like.
78.493	And I was at a dinner party
78.493	with some artist friends,
81.068	and I was telling them about this project,
83.111	and they couldn't believe
83.111	that you could actually see DNA.
85.853	So I said, all right, let's get out
85.853	some supplies right now.
88.709	And I started having these bizarre
88.709	dinner parties on Friday nights,
91.885	where people would come over
91.885	and we'd do DNA extractions,
94.582	and I would capture them on video,
96.25	because it created
96.25	this kind of funny portrait as well.
98.956	(Laughter)
101.469	These are people who don't necessarily
101.469	regularly engage with science.
104.894	You can kind of tell from their reactions.
107.083	(Laughter)
108.906	But they became fascinated by it,
110.534	and it was really exciting for me
110.534	to see them get excited about science.
113.985	And so I started doing this regularly.
116.139	(Laughter)
117.736	It's an odd thing to do
117.736	with your Friday nights,
120.039	but this is what I started doing.
121.642	I started collecting a whole group
121.642	of my friends' DNA in small vials
124.883	and categorizing them.
126.084	This is what that looked like.
127.553	And it started to make me think
127.553	about a couple of things.
130.291	First, this looked a lot
130.291	like my Facebook wall.
132.523	So in a way, I created
132.523	sort of a genetic social network.
135.735	And the second thing was,
136.994	one time a friend came over
136.994	and looked at this on my table
139.807	and was like, 
139.807	"""Uh ... why are they numbered?"
142.024	Is this person more rare
142.024	"than the other one?"""
144.325	And I hadn't even thought about that.
146.135	They were just numbered
147.319	because that was the order
147.319	that I extracted the DNA in.
149.954	But that made me think
149.954	about collecting toys,
152.088	and what's going on right now
152.088	in the toy world with blind box toys,
155.327	and being able to collect these rare toys.
157.41	You buy these boxes, but aren't sure
157.41	what's going to be inside.
160.431	But when you open them,
160.431	you have different rarities of the toys.
163.462	I thought that was interesting;
163.462	I thought about this
165.925	and the caviar vending machine
165.925	and the Art-o-mat all together.
168.858	And for some reason, I was one night
168.858	drawing a vending machine,
171.84	thinking of doing paintings
171.84	of a vending machine.
174.199	The vial of my DNA was sitting there,
176.003	and I saw a beautiful collaboration
176.003	between the strands of DNA
178.953	and the coils of a vending machine.
180.65	So I decided to create an art installation
180.65	called the DNA Vending Machine.
184.171	Here it is.
185.429	(Music)
190.53	[DNA Vending Machine
190.53	is an art installation
192.612	about our increasing access
192.612	to biotechnology.]
194.838	(Music)
199.455	[For a reasonable cost,
199.455	you can purchase a sample of human DNA
202.437	from a traditional vending machine.]
206.719	(Music)
225.451	[Each sample comes packaged
226.789	with a collectible limited edition
226.789	portrait of the human specimen.]
230.009	(Music)
235.37	[DNA Vending Machine treats DNA
235.37	as a collectible material
238.127	and brings to light legal issues
238.127	over the ownership of DNA.]
240.967	(Music ends)
245.313	Gabriel Barcia-Colombo:
246.488	The DNA Vending Machine is currently
246.488	in a couple of galleries in New York,
250.025	and it's selling out pretty well.
251.648	We're in the first edition of 100 pieces,
253.66	hoping to do another edition pretty soon.
255.638	I'd like to get it
255.638	into more of a metro hub,
257.741	like Grand Central or Penn Station,
259.448	next to some of the other
259.448	vending machines in that location.
262.322	But really, with this
262.322	and a lot of my art projects,
264.727	I want to ask the audience a question:
266.583	When biotechnology and DNA sequencing
266.583	becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting
270.429	or 3D printing or buying caviar
270.429	from a vending machine,
274.339	will you submit your sample of DNA
274.339	to be part of the vending machine?
277.663	How much will these samples be worth?
279.474	Will you buy someone else's sample?
281.363	And what will you be able to do
281.363	with that sample?
285.096	Thank you.
286.294	(Applause)
