15.768	In the ocean,
16.8	what is the common point
18.64	between oil, plastic and radioactivity?
24.408	On the top line, this is the BP oil spill:
29.625	billions of barrels of oil gushing
31.648	in the Gulf of Mexico.
33.017	The middle line is millions of tons of
35.192	plastic debris accumulating in our ocean,
37.596	and the third line is radioactive material
40.316	leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant
42.612	in the Pacific Ocean.
43.95	Well, the three big problems have in common
48.533	that they are man-made problems
51.348	but they are controlled by natural forces.
53.404	This should make us feel very, terribly awful
57.812	as much as it should make us feel hopeful,
60.139	because if we have the power to create these problems,
62.948	we may as well have the power
64.628	to remediate these problems.
66.06	But what about natural forces?
68.004	Well, that's exactly what I want to talk about today,
70.987	is how we can use these natural forces
73.292	to remediate these man-made problems.
78.515	When the BP oil spill happened,
79.741	I was working at MIT, and I was in charge
82.506	of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.
84.903	And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico
88.316	and meet some fishermen and see
90.653	the terrible conditions in which they were working.
92.444	More than 700 of these boats,
95.525	which are fishermen boats repurposed
97.832	with oil absorbent in white
100.293	and oil containment in orange, were used,
102.688	but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface,
105.947	and the health of the cleaners
107.659	were very deeply affected.
109.572	I was working on a very interesting technology
113.566	at MIT, but it was a very long-term view
115.875	of how to develop technology,
117.309	and it was going to be a very expensive technology,
119.827	and also it would be patented.
122.275	So I wanted to develop something that we could
124.907	develop very fast, that would be cheap,
128.307	and that would be open-source, so, because
130.747	oil spills are not only happening in the Gulf of Mexico,
132.915	and that would be using renewable energy.
135.531	So I quit my dream job,
137.931	and I moved to New Orleans,
139.547	and I kept on studying how the oil spill was happening.
142.491	Currently, what they were doing is
144.563	that they were using these small fishing boats,
146.209	and they were cleaning clean lines in an ocean of dirt.
149.369	If you're using the exact same amount of surface
153.082	of oil absorbent, but you're just paying attention
155.235	to natural patterns, and if you're going up the winds,
157.568	you can collect a lot more material.
159.336	If you're multiplying the rig,
161.457	so you multiply how many layers of absorbent
164.032	you're using, you can collect a lot more.
165.934	But it's extremely difficult to move oil absorbent
168.535	against the winds, the surface currents and the waves.
172.167	These are enormous forces.
173.631	So the very simple idea was to use the ancient technique
176.654	of sailing and tacking of the wind
178.907	to capture or intercept the oil
181.525	that is drifting down the wind.
182.867	So this didn't require any invention.
186.364	We just took a simple sailing boat
188.067	and we tried to pull something long and heavy,
189.964	but as we tacked back and forth,
192.276	what we lost was two things:
193.947	we were losing pulling power and direction.
197.324	And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder
201.156	from the back of the boat to the front,
202.668	would we have better control?
204.411	So I built this small sailing robot
206.627	with the rudder at the front,
207.875	and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy,
210.34	so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull,
213.547	and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder,
216.459	I could control four meters of absorbent.
218.811	Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot,
222.627	and so you see the robot has
225.091	a front rudder here.
226.763	Normally it's at the back.
227.979	And, playing, I realized that the maneuverability
231.594	of this was really amazing,
232.874	and I could avoid an obstacle at the very last second,
234.802	more maneuverable than a normal boat.
236.474	Then I started publishing online, and
239.338	some friends from Korea, they started being
242.25	interested in this, and we made a boat
243.979	which has a front rudder and a back rudder,
245.787	so we started interacting with this,
247.845	and it was slightly better,
249.964	although it was very small and a bit off balance,
251.888	but then we thought,
252.968	what if we have more than two points of control?
254.856	What if the entire boat becomes a point of control?
256.848	What if the entire boat changes shape?
258.968	So â€” (Applause)
261.408	Thank you very much. (Applause)
263.304	And so that's the beginning of Protei,
265.889	and that's the first boat in history
267.528	that completely changed the shape of the hull
269.152	in order to control it,
270.322	and the properties of sailing that we get
273.208	are very superior compared to a normal boat.
276.106	When we're turning, we have the feeling of surfing,
278.76	and the way it's going up-wind, it's very efficient.
282.876	This is low speed, low wind speed,
285.576	and the maneuverability is very increased,
287.649	and here I'm going to do a small jibe,
289.96	and look at the position of the sail.
292.056	What's happening is that, because the boat changes shape,
295.656	the position of the front sail and the main sail
297.996	are different to the wind.
299.173	We're catching wind from both sides.
301.056	And this is exactly what we're looking [for]
303.315	if we want to pull something long and heavy.
305.099	We don't want to lose pulling power, nor direction.
307.488	So, I wanted to know if this was possible
310.328	to put this at an industrial level,
311.799	so we made a large boat with a large sail,
314.311	and with a very light hull, inflatable,
317.007	very small footprint,
318.512	so we have a very big size and power ratio.
321.336	After this, we wanted to see if we could
324.567	implement this and automate the system,
326.864	so we used the same system but we added
328.536	a structure to it so we could activate the machine.
330.906	So, we used the same bladder-inflated system,
334.12	and we took it for testing.
336.104	So this is happening in the Netherlands.
338.415	We tried in the water without any skin or ballast
340.946	just to see how it works.
343.517	And then we mounted a camera for controlling it,
346.202	but quickly we saw that we would need
349.104	a lot more weight at the bottom,
351.253	so we had to take it back to the lab,
352.79	and then we built a skin around it,
354.878	we put batteries, remote controllers, and then
358.165	we put it in the water and then we
359.613	let it go in the water and see how well it would work,
362.774	so let some rope out, and hope it's going to work,
366.198	and it worked okay, but we still have a long way.
369.421	Our small prototype has given us good insight
371.857	that it's working very well,
373.203	but we still need to work a lot more on this.
375.888	So what we are doing is an accelerated evolution
379.757	of sailing technology.
381.205	We went from a back rudder to a front rudder
383.132	to two rudders to multiple rudders
385.143	to the whole boat changing shape,
386.814	and the more we are moving forward,
388.67	and the more the design looks simple and cute. (Laughter)
394.717	But I wanted to show you a fish because --
397.094	In fact, it's very different from a fish.
400.164	A fish will move because -- by changing like this,
404.564	but our boat is propelled by the wind still,
407.663	and the hull controls the trajectory.
410.07	So I brought to you for the first time on the TED stage
413.724	Protei Number Eight. It's not the last one,
416.109	but it's a good one for making demos.
418.358	So the first thing as I show you in the video is
420.634	that we may be able to control the trajectory
424.621	of a sailing boat better,
426.085	or we may be able to never be in irons,
429.146	so never facing the wind,
430.446	we always can catch the wind from both sides.
432.561	But new properties of a sailing boat.
435.121	So if you're looking at the boat from this side,
439.377	this might remind you of an airplane profile.
441.585	An airplane, when you're moving in this direction,
443.998	starts to lift, and that's how it takes off.
446.263	Now, if you're taking the same system,
448.438	and you're putting vertical, you're bending,
450.806	and if you're moving this way forward,
452.806	your instinct will tell you that you might go this way,
455.933	but if you're moving fast enough,
457.74	you might create what we call lateral lift,
459.759	so we could get further or closer to the wind.
462.684	Other property is this:
465.628	A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here
468.789	and a rudder at the back,
470.781	and these two things are what creates most
473.331	resistance and turbulence behind the boat,
475.985	but because this doesn't have either
478.256	a centerboard or a rudder,
479.792	we hope that if we keep working on this hull design
482.664	we can improve and have less resistance.
484.856	The other thing is, most boats, when they reach
487.511	a certain speed, and they are going on waves,
489.735	they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water,
492.174	and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
495.471	But if we're going with the flow,
497.559	if we pay attention to natural patterns
499.695	instead of trying to be strong,
501.306	but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb
503.705	a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy,
506.902	to actually save some energy to move forward.
510.059	So we may have developed the technology
514.21	which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy,
516.877	but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology
521.094	if it doesn't reach the right hands?
523.04	Normal technology or innovation happens like this:
525.986	Somebody has an interesting idea,
528.416	some other scientist or engineer,
530.378	they take it to the next level, they make a theory about it
532.882	and maybe they patent it,
534.138	and then some industry will make a contract
536.674	of exclusivity to manufacture and sell it,
539.818	and then, eventually, a buyer will buy it,
541.914	and we hope that they are going to use [it] for a good purpose.
544.682	What we really want is that this innovation happens
548.378	continuously. The inventor and engineers
550.714	and also the manufacturers and everybody
552.45	works at the same time, but this would be sterile
554.834	if this was happening in a parallel and uncrossed process.
558.466	What you really want is not a sequential,
560.506	not parallel development.
561.898	You want to have a network of innovation.
563.507	You want everybody, like we're doing now,
565.586	to work at the same time, and that can only happen
568.755	if these people all together decide to share the information,
572.146	and that's exactly what open hardware is about.
575.086	It's to replace competition by collaboration.
578.755	It's to transform any new product into a new market.
582.906	So what is open hardware?
585.347	Essentially, open hardware is a license.
587.13	It's just an intellectual property setup.
589.202	It means that everybody is free to use,
592.226	modify and distribute, and in exchange
595.379	we only ask for two things:
596.657	The name is credited -- the name of the project --
598.752	and also the people who make improvement,
601.488	they share back with the community.
602.816	So it's a very simple condition.
604.152	And I started this project alone in a garage in New Orleans,
608.176	but quickly after I wanted to publish and share
610.352	this information, so I made a Kickstarter,
612.096	which is a crowd-fundraising platform,
614.336	and in about one month we fundraised 30,000 dollars.
616.768	With this money, I hired a team of young engineers
620.08	from all over the world, and we rented a factory
622.608	in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
624.128	We were peer-learning, we were engineering,
627.289	we were making things, prototyping,
630.472	but most importantly we were trying our prototypes
632.697	in the water as often as possible,
634.392	to fail as quickly as possible, to learn from.
637.544	This is a proud member of Protei from Korea,
640.056	and on the right side, this is a multiple-masts
642.516	design proposed by a team in Mexico.
644.449	This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine
647.634	in New York, and so she decided to prototype
650.229	this idea that she saw, and she documented
652.759	every step of the process,
654.188	and she published it on Instructables,
656.437	which is a website for sharing inventions.
658.669	Less than one week after,
660.564	this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
664.574	They made it, but they eventually published
666.904	a simplified design.
668.028	They also made it into an Instructable,
669.957	and in less than one week, they had
671.692	almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.
674.452	We're working on also simpler technology,
677.356	not that complex, with younger people
679.307	and also older people,
680.876	like this dinosaur is from Mexico. (Laughter)
684.027	So Protei is now an international network
686.844	of innovation for selling technology
689.692	using this shape-shifting hull.
691.484	And what puts us together is that we have a common,
695.519	at least, global understanding
698.308	"of what the word ""business"" is, or what it should be."
701.38	This is how most work today.
703.613	Business as usual is saying, what's most important
705.987	is to make lots of profit, and you'll be using
708.226	technology for that, and people will be your work force,
711.051	instrumentalized,
712.299	and environment is usually the last priority.
714.971	It will be just a way to, say, greenwash your audience
718.849	and, say, increase your price tag.
721.08	What we're trying to do, or what we believe,
723.609	because this is how we believe the world really works,
726.025	is that without the environment you have nothing.
728.195	We have the people so we need to protect each other, yes,
731.08	and we're a technology company,
732.744	and profit is necessary to make this happen. (Applause)
737.929	Thank you very much. (Applause)
741.534	If we have the courage to understand or accept
745.615	that this actually how the world really works,
747.535	and this is the order of priority that we need to choose,
750.552	then it makes obvious why we need
752.693	to choose open hardware for developing environmental
755.032	technology, because we need to share information.
756.912	What's next for us?
758.992	So, this small machine that you've seen,
761.527	we're hoping to make small toys like
763.671	one-meter remote control Protei that you can upgrade --
767.164	so replace the remote control parts by Androids,
770.15	so the mobile phone, and Arduino micro-controller,
773.929	so you could be controlling this
775.152	from your mobile phone, your tablet.
776.64	Then what we want to do is create six-meter versions
780.206	so we can test the maximum performance of these machines,
782.534	so we can go at very, very high speed.
784.098	So imagine yourself.
785.361	You are laying down in a flexible torpedo,
788.546	sailing at high speed,
790.04	controlling the shape of the hull with your legs
791.885	and controlling the sail with your arms.
794.547	So that's what we're looking for developing. (Applause)
798.872	And we replace the human being --
801.086	to go, for example, for measuring radioactivity,
803.23	you don't want a human to be sailing those robots --
805.409	with batteries, motors, micro-controllers and sensors.
808.744	This is what our teammates, we dream of at night.
812.678	We hope that we can sometime clean up oil spills,
815.33	or we can gather or collect plastic in the ocean,
819.307	or we can have swarms of our machines
822.741	controlled by multi-player video game engines
825.923	to control many of these machines,
827.874	to monitor coral reefs
829.625	or to monitor fisheries.
831.764	Our hope is that we can use open hardware technology
836.254	to better understand and protect our oceans.
839.785	Thank you very much. (Applause)
843.497	(Applause)
