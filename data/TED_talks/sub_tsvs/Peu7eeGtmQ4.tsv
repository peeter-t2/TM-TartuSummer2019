15.26	There was a time in my life
18.26	when everything seemed perfect.
21.26	Everywhere I went, I felt at home.
23.26	Everyone I met,
25.26	I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.
28.26	And I want to share with you how I came to that place
31.26	and what I've learned since I left it.
33.26	This is where it began.
36.26	And it raises an existential question,
38.26	which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,
41.26	why am I not visible in the photograph,
44.26	and where is this time and place?
47.26	This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
50.26	This is a police photo. That's actually my car.
53.26	We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,
56.26	called Cedars-Sinai.
58.26	And the situation is that a car full of paramedics
60.26	on their way home from the hospital after work
63.26	have run across the wreckage,
65.26	and they've advised the police
67.26	that there were no survivors inside the car,
69.26	that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.
72.26	And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive
75.26	to cut apart the vehicle
77.26	to extract the body of the driver.
79.26	And when they do, they find that behind the glass,
82.26	they find me.
84.26	And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;
86.26	all but two of my ribs,
88.26	my pelvis and both arms --
90.26	they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.
93.26	And they get me to that nearby hospital,
95.26	Cedars-Sinai,
97.26	where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,
102.26	which means full replacements of all the blood in me --
104.26	before they're able to staunch the flow.
106.26	I'm put on full life support,
108.26	and I have a massive stroke,
111.26	and my brain drops into a coma.
113.26	Now comas are measured
115.26	on a scale from 15 down to three.
117.26	Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
120.26	And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.
123.26	It's essentially there's no sign of life
125.26	from outside at all.
127.26	I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,
130.26	and it is inside that deepest level of coma,
132.26	on the rim between my life and my death,
135.26	that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
138.26	of inner space.
140.26	From my family looking in from outside,
143.26	what they're trying to figure out
145.26	is a different kind of existential question,
148.26	which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge
151.26	from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at
154.26	to an actual mind,
156.26	which I define simply
158.26	as the functioning of the brain
160.26	that is remaining inside my head.
162.26	Now to put this into a broader context,
164.26	I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien
167.26	watching the Earth from outer space,
169.26	and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television
172.26	is the Earth channel,
174.26	and your favorite show is the Human Show.
177.26	And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you
179.26	is because consciousness is so interesting.
181.26	It's so unpredictable
183.26	and so fragile.
185.26	And this is how we began.
187.26	We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.
190.26	The show began with tremendous special effects,
192.26	because there were catastrophic climate shifts --
195.26	which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
198.26	Because of the Earth tilting on its axis
200.26	and those catastrophic climate shifts,
203.26	we had to figure out how to find better food,
205.26	and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --
208.26	we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,
211.26	use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,
213.26	to grow our brains more.
215.26	So we actually grew our consciousness
217.26	in response to this global threat.
219.26	Now you also continue to watch
221.26	as consciousness evolved to the point
223.26	that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,
226.26	there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.
230.26	It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,
234.26	and it's the first known expression of art
236.26	on the planet.
238.26	And the reason it connects us with consciousness today
240.26	is that all of us still today,
242.26	the very first shape we draw as a child
245.26	is a circle.
247.26	And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.
250.26	We create an eye --
252.26	and the eye that evolves through all of our history.
254.26	There's the Egyptian god Horus,
256.26	which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.
259.26	And that comes down right way to the present
262.26	with the dollar bill in the United States,
264.26	which has on it an eye of providence.
267.26	So watching all of this show from outer space,
269.26	you think we get it, we understand
271.26	that the most precious resource on the blue planet
273.26	is our consciousness.
275.26	Because it's the first thing we draw;
277.26	we surround ourselves with images of it;
279.26	it's probably the most common image on the planet.
281.26	But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.
284.26	While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
287.26	Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.
289.26	And what I've learned since that event
291.26	and during my recovery
293.26	is that consciousness is under threat on this planet
296.26	in ways it's never been under threat before.
298.26	These are just some examples.
300.26	And the reason I'm so honored to be here
302.26	to talk today in India
304.26	is because India has the sad distinction
306.26	of being the head injury capital of the world.
309.26	That statistic is so sad.
311.26	There is no more drastic and sudden gap created
314.26	between potential and actual mind
316.26	than a severe head injury.
318.26	Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,
321.26	which means that India, unless something changes,
323.26	is accumulating a need
325.26	for millennia of rehabilitation.
329.26	What you find in the United States
331.26	is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --
334.26	stroke every 40 seconds,
336.26	Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.
339.26	All of these represent gaps
341.26	between potential mind and actual mind.
345.26	And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.
348.26	The World Health Organization tells us
350.26	that depression is the number one disease on Earth
353.26	in terms of years lived with disability.
356.26	We find that the number two source of disability
359.26	is depression in the age group
361.26	of 15 to 44.
363.26	Our children are becoming depressed
365.26	at an alarming rate.
367.26	I discovered during my recovery
369.26	the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers
371.26	is suicide.
373.26	If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.
375.26	Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents
377.26	are for concussions.
379.26	If I talk about migraine,
383.26	suffer episodic headaches.
385.26	Fifteen percent suffer migraines
387.26	that wipe them out for days on end.
389.26	All of this is leading -- computer addiction,
391.26	just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do
393.26	is use digital devices.
395.26	The average teenager
397.26	sends 3,300 texts every [month].
400.26	We're talking about a society that is retreating
402.26	into depression and disassociation
405.26	when we are potentially confronting
407.26	the next great catastrophic climate shift.
410.26	So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,
412.26	is are we going to confront and address
414.26	the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way
416.26	by growing our consciousness,
418.26	or are we going to continue to retreat?
420.26	And that then might lead you
422.26	to watch an episode one day
424.26	of Cedars-Sinai medical center
427.26	and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.
430.26	This is a dense array EEG MRI
433.26	tracking 156 channels of information.
435.26	It's not my EEG at Cedars;
438.26	it's your EEG tonight and last night.
441.26	It's the what our minds do every night
443.26	to digest the day
445.26	and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep
447.26	to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.
450.26	This is how I was when I returned from the hospital
453.26	after nearly four months.
455.26	The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull
457.26	is where they operated and went inside my brain
459.26	to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.
462.26	But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,
465.26	I'm looking down,
467.26	but let me tell you how I felt at that point.
470.26	I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
472.26	I felt empty and full, hot and cold,
475.26	euphoric and depressed
477.26	because the brain is the world's first
479.26	fully functional quantum computer;
481.26	it can occupy multiple states at the same time.
484.26	And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,
487.26	I felt everything simultaneously.
490.26	But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.
493.26	This is now flash-forward to the point in time
495.26	where I've been discharged by the health system.
498.26	Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.
500.26	I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.
503.26	But the system has moved me on
505.26	because, as my family started to discover,
508.26	there is no long-term concept
510.26	in the health care system.
512.26	Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,
515.26	requires a long-term perspective.
517.26	But let's take a look behind my eyes.
519.26	This is a gamma radiation spec scan
521.26	that uses gamma radiation
523.26	to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
526.26	It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,
528.26	but in two dimensions I think you can see
530.26	the beautiful symmetry and illumination
532.26	of a normal mind at work.
534.26	Here's my brain.
536.26	That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain
539.26	being destroyed by the stroke.
541.26	So my family, as we moved forward
543.26	and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,
546.26	had to try to find solutions and answers.
548.26	And during that process -- it took many years --
551.26	one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,
554.26	since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,
556.26	was miraculous.
558.26	And that was when I started to write a book,
560.26	because I didn't think it was miraculous.
562.26	I thought there were miraculous elements,
564.26	but I also didn't think it was right
566.26	that one should have to struggle and search for answers
568.26	when this is a pandemic within our society.
571.26	So from this experience of my recovery,
574.26	I want to share four particular aspects --
577.26	I call them the four C's of consciousness --
579.26	that helped me grow my potential mind
582.26	back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.
585.26	The first C is cognitive training.
587.26	Unlike the smashed glass of my car,
590.26	plasticity of the brain
592.26	means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,
595.26	to train the brain
597.26	so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.
600.26	Plasticity means that there was always
602.26	hope for our reason --
604.26	hope for our ability to rebuild that function.
607.26	Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,
609.26	and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva
612.26	back in the 1970's.
614.26	The global perspective
616.26	is that up to 30 percent of children in school
618.26	have learning weaknesses
620.26	that are not self-correcting,
622.26	but with appropriate treatment,
624.26	they can be screened for and detected and corrected
627.26	and avoid their academic failure.
629.26	But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone
632.26	who provides that treatment or care.
634.26	Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me
636.26	when I actually found somebody who could apply it.
639.26	I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.
642.26	Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.
644.26	Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --
646.26	how fast you can acquire information,
648.26	retain it and retrieve it --
650.26	that is essential for success in life today.
653.26	And you can see here there are three columns.
655.26	Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.
658.26	And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,
661.26	which is just below average.
664.26	In the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.
667.26	That's when I was discharged from the system.
669.26	What does average I.Q. really mean?
672.26	It meant that when I was given two and a half hours
675.26	to take a test that anyone here
677.26	would take in 50 minutes,
679.26	I might score an F.
682.26	This is a very, very low level
684.26	in order to be kicked out of the health care system.
686.26	Then I underwent cognitive training.
688.26	And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column
690.26	when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.
693.26	This is not supposed to occur.
696.26	I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify
699.26	at the age of eight.
701.26	Now the Journal of the National Medical Association
703.26	gave my memoir a full clinical review,
705.26	which is very unusual.
707.26	I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.
710.26	But they felt the evidences
712.26	that there was important, valuable information in the book,
715.26	and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.
718.26	"But they asked one question. They said, ""Is this repeatable?"""
721.26	That was a fair question
723.26	because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.
726.26	The answer is yes, and for the first time,
728.26	it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.
730.26	Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training
732.26	at ages seven and 11.
734.26	And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.
737.26	And this person is particularly interesting.
739.26	I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,
741.26	but they still had a neurologic issue.
743.26	But that person could be identified
745.26	as having a learning disability.
747.26	And with accommodation, they went on to college
749.26	and had a full life in terms of their opportunities.
752.26	Second aspect:
754.26	I still had crushing migraine headaches.
756.26	Two elements that worked for me here
758.26	are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain
762.26	is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.
764.26	The craniomandibular system is critical to that.
768.26	And when I underwent it and found solutions,
771.26	this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.
774.26	Up to 30 percent of the population
776.26	have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw
779.26	that affects the entire body.
781.26	I was fortunate to find a dentist
783.26	who applied this entire universe
785.26	of technology you're about to see
787.26	to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,
789.26	the headaches pretty much resolved,
791.26	but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.
793.26	He then held my jaw in the right position
795.26	while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.
799.26	So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.
802.26	This affected my entire body.
805.26	If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say
807.26	and rather a bold statement --
809.26	How can the jaw affect the entire body? --
811.26	let me simply point out to you,
813.26	if I ask you tomorrow
815.26	to put one grain of sand between your teeth
817.26	and go for a nice long walk,
819.26	how far would you last
821.26	before you had to remove that grain of sand?
823.26	That tiny misalignment.
825.26	Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
827.26	That's why the same between the before and after that this shows,
830.26	it's hard to see the difference.
832.26	Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth
834.26	and see the difference it makes.
836.26	I still had migraine headaches.
838.26	The next issue that resolved
840.26	was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain
842.26	is caused by imbalance,
844.26	the other 10 percent, largely --
846.26	if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer
848.26	and hormonal issues --
850.26	is the circulation.
852.26	Imagine the blood flowing through your body --
854.26	I was told at UCLA Medical Center --
856.26	as one sealed system.
858.26	There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,
860.26	and around that pipe are the nerves
862.26	drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.
864.26	That's basically it.
866.26	If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,
868.26	it bulges someplace else.
870.26	If that some place else where it bulges
872.26	is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,
875.26	you get a vascular migraine.
877.26	This is a level of pain that's only known
879.26	to other people who suffer vascular migraines.
882.26	Using this technology,
884.26	this is mapping in three dimensions.
886.26	This is an MRI MRA MRV,
888.26	a volumetric MRI.
890.26	Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center
893.26	were able to identify
895.26	where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
897.26	A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.
901.26	And in the following months and years,
903.26	I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.
906.26	Communication, the next C. This is critical.
909.26	All consciousness is about communication.
912.26	And here, by great fortune,
914.26	one of my father's clients
916.26	had a husband who worked
918.26	at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.
921.26	Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator
923.26	who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,
926.26	whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind
929.26	or movement to the paralyzed.
931.26	And I'm just going to give you an example today
933.26	of movement to the paralyzed.
935.26	I've brought with me, from Southern California,
938.26	the FM device.
940.26	This is it being held in the hand.
942.26	It weighs less than a gram.
944.26	So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.
947.26	Five of them would still weigh less
949.26	than a rupee coin.
951.26	Where does it go inside the body?
953.26	It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free
955.26	for over 80 years.
957.26	So it goes in and it stays there.
959.26	Here are the implantation sites.
961.26	The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --
964.26	is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body
966.26	where they're needed.
968.26	The main unit will then go inside the brain.
970.26	An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,
973.26	will send signals in real time
975.26	to the motor points in the relevant muscles
977.26	so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,
980.26	if they've lost control of their arm.
982.26	And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,
985.26	on contacting a surface,
987.26	will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,
990.26	so that the person feels a sense of touch.
993.26	Is this science fiction? No,
995.26	because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.
998.26	I don't have the ability to control my left foot.
1000.26	A radio device is controlling every step I take,
1003.26	and a sensor picks up my foot for me
1005.26	every time I walk.
1007.26	And in closing, I want to share
1009.26	the personal reason why this meant so much to me
1011.26	and changed the direction of my life.
1013.26	In my coma, one of the presences I sensed
1015.26	was someone I felt was a protector.
1017.26	And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,
1020.26	but I didn't remember my own past.
1023.26	Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.
1026.26	And I whispered the good news
1028.26	through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,
1030.26	to my night nurse.
1032.26	And the following morning, my mother came to explain
1034.26	that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,
1036.26	that I'd been working in film and television
1038.26	and that I had been in a crash
1040.26	and that, yes, I was married,
1043.26	but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.
1046.26	And during my time in coma,
1048.26	she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.
1052.26	Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me
1055.26	if everything that made today special was gone.
1058.26	And as I discovered these threats to consciousness
1061.26	and how they are surrounding the world
1063.26	and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,
1066.26	I discovered what truly remained.
1068.26	I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,
1071.26	that the Human Show can stay on the air
1073.26	for millennia to come.
1075.26	I believe that we can all rise and shine.
1078.26	Thank you very much.
1080.26	(Applause)
1086.26	Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second.
1089.26	(Applause)
1093.26	You know,
1096.26	when I heard Simon's --
1100.26	please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second --
1103.26	when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.
1106.26	And so I was sitting in this restaurant,
1109.26	waiting for a man to come by
1112.26	who obviously would have some difficulty ...
1114.26	I don't know what I had in my mind.
1116.26	And he was walking around.
1118.26	I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet
1120.26	to be him.
1122.26	And then we met and we talked,
1124.26	and I'm like, he doesn't look
1126.26	like somebody who was built out of nothing.
1130.26	And then I was amazed
1132.26	at what role technology played
1134.26	in your recovery.
1136.26	And we have his book outside
1138.26	in the bookshop.
1140.26	The thing that amazed me
1142.26	is the painstaking detail
1145.26	with which he has written
1147.26	every hospital he has been to,
1149.26	every treatment he got,
1151.26	every near-miss he had,
1154.26	and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.
1158.26	So I think this one detail
1163.26	went past people really quick.
1165.26	Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.
1168.26	Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this
1170.26	that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about --
1172.26	Well this is it. This is the control unit.
1175.26	And this records every single step I've taken
1177.26	for, ooh, five or six years now.
1179.26	And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
1184.26	That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.
1187.26	When I press it again, it'll chirp three times,
1190.26	and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.
1194.26	And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.
1197.26	And it works. It works.
1199.26	And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...
1202.26	What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.
1205.26	This down here, if the camera can see that,
1208.26	that is a small antenna.
1211.26	Underneath my heel, there is a sensor
1214.26	that detects when my foot leaves the ground --
1216.26	what's called the heel lift.
1218.26	This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.
1221.26	But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
1224.26	And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,
1227.26	it detects what's called the time interval,
1229.26	which is the interval between each heel lift.
1231.26	And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.
1235.26	The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk --
1238.26	is they've restored functional hearing
1240.26	to thousands of deaf people.
1242.26	I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,
1245.26	but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,
1247.26	[Dr. Schindler.]
1249.26	And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost,
1252.26	because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on
1255.26	because it was a small issue.
1257.26	But there's millions of deaf people in the world,
1260.26	and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
1263.26	It works.
1265.26	And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.
1268.26	And this, this is the implantable generation.
1271.26	Because what I didn't say in my talk
1273.26	is this is actually exoskeletal.
1275.26	I should clarify that.
1277.26	Because the first generation is exoskeletal,
1279.26	it's wrapped around the leg,
1281.26	around the affected limb.
1283.26	I must tell you, they're an amazing --
1285.26	there's a hundred people who work in that building --
1287.26	engineers, scientists,
1289.26	and other team members -- all the time.
1291.26	Alfred Mann has set up this foundation
1294.26	to advance this research
1296.26	because he saw
1298.26	there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.
1301.26	The audience is too small.
1303.26	You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,
1305.26	but the audience is too small,
1307.26	and the amount of research, the time it takes,
1310.26	the FDA clearances,
1312.26	the payback time is too long
1314.26	for V.C. to be interested.
1316.26	So he saw a need and he stepped in.
1318.26	He's a very, very remarkable man.
1321.26	He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.
1324.26	LP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.
1326.26	Thank you. Thank you.
1328.26	(Applause)
