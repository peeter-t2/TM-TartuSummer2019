25.56	Charles Van Doren, who was later
25.56	a senior editor of Britannica,
28.719	said the ideal encyclopedia
28.719	should be radical --
31.92	it should stop being safe.
33.48	But if you know anything about the history
33.48	of Britannica since 1962,
36.72	it was anything but radical:
38.08	still a very completely safe,
38.08	stodgy type of encyclopedia.
43	Wikipedia, on the other hand,
43	begins with a very radical idea,
47.2	and that's for all of us
47.2	to imagine a world
49.24	in which every single person on the planet
51.28	is given free access
51.28	to the sum of all human knowledge.
53.88	And that's what we're doing.
56	So Wikipedia --
57.183	you just saw the little
57.183	demonstration of it --
59.64	it's a freely licensed encyclopedia.
61.76	It's written by thousands of volunteers
63.642	all over the world
63.642	in many, many languages.
66.32	It's written using wiki software --
68.08	which is the type of software
68.08	he just demonstrated --
70.66	so anyone can quickly edit and save,
72.399	and it goes live
72.399	on the Internet immediately.
75.64	And everything about Wikipedia is managed
75.64	by virtually an all-volunteer staff.
80.28	So when Yochai is talking
80.28	about new methods of organization,
84.72	he's exactly describing Wikipedia.
87.24	And what I'm going to do today
88.693	is tell you a little bit more
88.693	about how it really works on the inside.
92.96	So Wikipedia's owned
92.96	by the Wikimedia Foundation,
96.12	which I founded,
97.36	a nonprofit organization.
98.8	And our goal, the core aim
98.8	of the Wikimedia Foundation,
102.84	is to get a free encyclopedia
102.84	to every single person on the planet.
106.04	And so, if you think
106.04	about what that means,
108.08	it means a lot more
108.08	than just building a cool website.
110.64	We're really interested
110.64	in all the issues of the digital divide,
113.68	poverty worldwide,
115.28	empowering people everywhere
115.28	to have the information that they need
118.68	to make good decisions.
119.92	And so we're going
119.92	to have to do a lot of work
122.52	that goes beyond just the Internet.
124.24	And so that's a big part of why
124.24	we've chosen the free licensing model,
127.56	because that empowers local
127.56	entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to --
130.823	they can take our content
130.823	and do anything they like with it --
133.759	you can copy it, redistribute it --
135.465	and you can do it
135.465	commercially or non-commercially.
137.901	So there's a lot of opportunities
137.901	that are going to arise around Wikipedia
141.425	all over the world.
143.48	We're funded by donations from the public,
145.52	and one of the more
145.52	interesting things about that
148	is how little money
148	it actually takes to run Wikipedia.
151.84	So Yochai showed you the graph
151.84	of what the cost of a printing press was.
156.4	And I'm going to tell you
156.4	what the cost of Wikipedia is.
159.76	But first, I'll show you how big it is.
161.642	So we've got over 600,000
161.642	articles in English.
166.04	We've got two million total articles
166.04	across many, many different languages.
170.52	The biggest languages
170.52	are German, Japanese, French --
173.8	all the Western-European
173.8	languages are quite big.
177.52	But only around one-third
177.52	of all of our traffic to our web
180.92	clusters to the English Wikipedia,
182.58	which is surprising to a lot of people.
184.462	A lot of people think in a very
184.462	English-centric way on the Internet,
187.84	but for us, we're truly global.
189.76	We're in many, many languages.
191.88	How popular we've gotten to be --
191.88	we're a top-50 website
195.04	and we're more popular
195.04	than the New York Times.
197.255	So this is where we get
197.255	to Yochai's discussion.
201.96	This shows the growth of Wikipedia --
201.96	we're the blue line there --
205.32	and this is the New York Times over there.
208.04	And what's interesting about this
209.64	is the New York Times website is a huge,
209.64	enormous corporate operation
214	with I have no idea
214	how many hundreds of employees.
216.52	We have exactly one employee,
218.56	and that employee
218.56	is our lead software developer.
221.2	And he's only been our employee
221.2	since January 2005,
224.4	all the other growth before that ...
226.24	So the servers are managed
226.24	by a ragtag band of volunteers.
229.88	All the editing is done by volunteers.
231.88	And the way that we're organized
233.44	is not like any traditional
233.44	organization you can imagine.
236.147	People are always asking,
236.147	"""Well, who's in charge of this?"""
238.886	"or ""Who does that?"""
240.08	And the answer is:
240.08	anybody who wants to pitch in.
242.4	It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.
246.48	We've got over 90 servers now
246.48	in three locations.
248.8	These are managed by volunteer
248.8	system administrators who are online.
254.08	I can go online
254.08	any time of the day or night
256.16	and see eight to 10 people waiting for me
260.48	to ask a question or something,
260.48	anything about the servers.
264.04	You could never afford
264.04	to do this in a company.
266.4	You could never afford
267.64	to have a standby crew of people
271.4	and do what we're doing at Wikipedia.
274.48	So we're doing around
274.48	1.4 billion page views monthly,
277.72	so it's really gotten to be a huge thing.
280.36	And everything is managed
280.36	by the volunteers.
282.76	And the total monthly cost
282.76	for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars.
287	And that's essentially our main cost.
288.96	We could actually do without the employee.
291.24	We hired Brian because he was
291.24	working part-time for two years
295.68	and full-time at Wikipedia,
297	so we actually hired him,
298.24	so he could get a life
298.24	and go to the movies sometimes.
301.955	So the big question when you've got
301.955	this really chaotic organization is,
305.36	why isn't it all rubbish?
306.6	Why is the website as good as it is?
308.995	First of all, how good is it?
310.4	Well, it's pretty good.
311.96	It isn't perfect,
313.2	but it's much better
313.2	than you would expect,
315.24	given our completely chaotic model.
316.947	So when you saw him make
316.947	a ridiculous edit to the page about me,
319.987	"you think, ""Oh, this is obviously"
319.987	"just going to degenerate into rubbish."""
323.76	But when we've seen quality tests --
325.515	and there haven't been enough of these yet
327.555	and I'm really encouraging
327.555	people to do more,
330.16	comparing Wikipedia
330.16	to traditional things --
332.32	we win hands down.
334.12	So a German magazine
334.12	compared German Wikipedia,
336.88	which is much, much smaller than English,
340.24	to Microsoft Encarta
340.24	and to Brockhaus multimedial,
344.36	and we won across the board.
345.84	They hired experts to come and look
345.84	at articles and compare the quality,
349.245	and we were very pleased with that result.
352.32	So a lot of people have heard about
352.32	the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy.
357.88	The media has covered this
357.88	somewhat extensively.
360.56	It started out
360.56	with an article in Red Herring.
363.4	The reporters called me up and they --
365.24	I mean, I have to say
365.24	they spelled my name right,
368.24	but they really wanted to say
368.24	the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious,
373.2	it's tearing apart
373.2	the Wikipedia community.
375.6	And so they quote me as saying,
377.12	"""They're the most contentious"
377.12	"in the history of Wikipedia."""
380.04	What I actually said
380.04	is they're not contentious at all.
382.64	So it's a slight misquote.
384.76	(Laughter)
386.56	The articles were edited quite heavily.
388.6	And it is true that we did
388.6	have to lock the articles
391.08	on a couple of occasions.
392.44	Time magazine recently reported that
394.84	"""Extreme action sometimes has to be taken,"
396.88	and Wales locked the entries
396.88	"on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004."""
401.76	This came after I told the reporter
401.76	that we had to lock it for --
406.04	occasionally a little bit here and there.
408.2	So the truth in general
408.2	is that the kinds of controversies
411.6	that you would probably think
411.6	we have within the Wikipedia community
414.815	are not really controversies at all.
417.56	Articles on controversial topics
417.56	are edited a lot,
420.08	but they don't cause much controversy
420.08	within the community.
423.08	And the reason for this is that most
423.08	people understand the need for neutrality.
427.6	The real struggle is not
427.6	between the right and the left --
434.32	that's where most people assume --
435.964	but it's between
435.964	the party of the thoughtful
438.04	and the party of the jerks.
439.36	And no side of the political spectrum
441.2	has a monopoly
441.2	on either of those qualities.
443.68	The actual truth
443.68	about the specific Bush-Kerry incident
446.28	is that the Bush-Kerry articles
449.28	were locked less than one percent
449.28	of the time in 2004,
452.28	and it wasn't because
452.28	they were contentious;
454.36	it was just because
454.36	there was routine vandalism --
456.72	which happens sometimes even on stage ...
460.44	(Laughter)
461.6	Sometimes even reporters have reported
461.6	to me that they vandalized Wikipedia
465.16	and were amazed
465.16	that it was fixed so quickly.
467.52	And I said -- you know, I always say,
467.52	please don't do that.
470.32	That's not a good thing.
471.92	So how do we do this?
473.44	How do we manage the quality control?
476.32	How does it work?
479.12	So there's a few elements,
480.84	mostly social policies
480.84	and some elements of the software.
484.12	So the biggest
484.12	and the most important thing
486.88	is our neutral point of view policy.
488.635	This is something
488.635	that I set down, from the very beginning,
491.421	as a core principle of the community
491.421	that's completely not debatable.
495.48	It's a social concept of cooperation,
498.4	so we don't talk a lot
498.4	about truth and objectivity.
501.92	The reason for this is if we say
504	we're only going to write
504	"the ""truth"" about some topic,"
506.6	that doesn't do us a damn bit of good
506.6	of figuring out what to write,
509.831	because I don't agree with you
509.831	about what's the truth.
512.391	But we have this
512.391	jargon term of neutrality,
514.76	which has its own long history
514.76	within the community,
517.24	which basically says,
517.24	any time there's a controversial issue,
520.68	Wikipedia itself should not
520.68	take a stand on the issue.
523.28	We should merely report on what
523.28	reputable parties have said about it.
526.543	So this neutrality policy
526.543	is really important for us
529.64	because it empowers a community
529.64	that is very diverse
532.92	to come together
532.92	and actually get some work done.
535.24	So we have very diverse contributors
537.4	in terms of political,
537.4	religious, cultural backgrounds.
540.64	By having this firm neutrality policy,
542.48	which is non-negotiable
542.48	from the beginning,
544.52	we ensure that people can work together
546.402	and that the entries
546.402	don't become simply a war
548.64	back and forth
548.64	between the left and the right.
550.807	If you engage in that type of behavior,
550.807	you'll be asked to leave the community.
556.24	So, real-time peer review.
557.72	Every single change on the site
557.72	"goes to the ""Recent changes"" page."
560.88	So as soon as he made his change,
560.88	"it went to the ""Recent changes"" page."
564.4	That recent changes page
564.4	was also fed into an IRC channel,
568.4	which is an Internet chat channel
570	that people are monitoring
570	with various software tools.
573.92	And people can get RSS feeds --
576.4	they can get email
576.4	notifications of changes.
579.52	And then users can set up
579.52	their own personal watch list.
582.2	So my page is on quite a few
582.2	volunteers' watch lists,
584.717	because it is sometimes vandalized.
586.437	And therefore, what happens is someone
586.437	will notice the change very quickly,
592.44	and then they'll just
592.44	simply revert the change.
595.84	"There's a ""new pages feed,"" for example,"
597.78	so you can go
597.78	to a certain page of Wikipedia
599.86	and see every new page as it's created.
601.82	This is really important
602.98	because a lot of new pages
602.98	are just garbage that has to be deleted,
606.2	"you know, ""ASDFASDF."""
607.48	But also, that's some
607.48	of the most interesting and fun things,
610.42	some of the new articles.
611.66	People will start an article
611.66	on some interesting topic,
614.26	other people will find that intriguing
616.1	and jump in and help
616.1	and make it much better.
618.52	So we do have edits by anonymous users,
620.44	which is one of the most controversial
620.44	and intriguing things about Wikipedia.
624.32	So, Chris was able to do his change --
624.32	he didn't have to log in or anything;
627.96	he just went on the website
627.96	and made a change.
630.8	But it turns out
630.8	that only about 18 percent
632.88	of all the edits to the website
634.4	are done by anonymous users.
635.76	And that's a really important
635.76	thing to understand:
638.12	the vast majority of the edits
638.12	that go on on the website
641.4	are from a very close-knit community
641.4	of maybe 600 to 1,000 people
645.12	who are in constant communication.
646.764	And we have over 40 IRC channels,
649.36	All these people know each other.
650.96	They communicate.
650.96	We have off-line meetings.
653.032	These are the people
653.032	who are doing the bulk of the site,
655.676	and they are, in a sense,
655.676	semi-professionals at what they're doing.
660.96	The standards we set for ourselves
663.32	are equal to or higher
663.32	than professional standards of quality.
666.4	We don't always meet those standards,
666.4	but that's what we're striving for.
669.94	And so that tight community
669.94	is who really cares for the site,
672.822	and these are some
672.822	of the smartest people I've ever met.
675.48	It's my job to say that,
675.48	but it's actually true.
677.76	The type of people who were drawn
677.76	to writing an encyclopedia for fun
681.52	tend to be pretty smart people.
683.88	The tools and the software:
683.88	there's lots of tools that allow us --
687	allow us, meaning the community --
688.644	to self-monitor
688.644	and to monitor all the work.
690.72	This is an example
690.72	"of a page history on ""flat Earth,"""
693.24	and you can see some changes
693.24	that were made.
695.32	What's nice about this page
695.32	is you can immediately take a look at this
698.64	"and see, ""OK, I understand now."""
700.24	When somebody goes and looks at --
702.04	they see that someone,
702.04	an anonymous IP number,
704.207	made an edit to my page.
705.72	That sounds suspicious.
705.72	Who is this person?
707.8	Somebody looks at it --
709.04	they can immediately see
709.04	highlighted in red
711.08	all of the changes that took place --
713	to see, OK, well, these words
713	have changed, things like this.
716.64	So that's one tool that we can use
718.284	to very quickly monitor
718.284	the history of a page.
721.52	Another thing that we do
721.52	within the community
723.84	is we leave everything very open-ended.
727.24	Most of the social rules
727.24	and the methods of work
730.64	are left completely open-ended
730.64	in the software.
733.08	All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
735.12	And so there's nothing
735.12	in the software that enforces the rules.
738.24	The example I've got up here
738.24	is the Votes for Deletion page.
742.28	So, I mentioned earlier,
742.28	"people type ""ASDFASDF"" --"
744.88	it needs to be deleted.
746.12	Cases like that,
746.12	the administrators just delete it.
748.62	There's no reason
748.62	to have a big argument about it.
750.98	But you can imagine there's a lot
750.98	of other areas where the question is,
754.339	is this notable enough
754.339	to go in an encyclopedia?
756.603	Is the information verifiable?
756.603	Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what?
760.2	So we needed a social method
760.2	for figuring out the answer to this.
763.28	And so the method that arose
763.28	organically within the community
766.162	is the Votes For Deletion page.
767.76	And in the particular
767.76	example we have here,
769.8	"it's a film, ""Twisted Issues,"""
771.32	and the first person says,
772.8	"""Now this is supposedly a film."
772.8	"It fails the Google test miserably."""
776.52	The Google test is you look in Google
776.52	and see if it's there,
779.36	because if something's not even in Google,
779.36	it probably doesn't exist at all.
783.28	It's not a perfect rule,
784.88	but it's a nice starting point
784.88	for quick research.
788.24	"So somebody says, ""Delete it, please."
788.24	"Delete it -- it's not notable."""
791.519	And then somebody says,
791.519	"""Wait, I found it. I found it in a book,"
794.559	'Film Threat Video Guide:
794.559	"the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'"""
797.84	"So the next persons says, ""Clean it up."""
799.769	"Somebody says, ""I've found it on IMDB."
799.769	"Keep, keep, keep."""
803.2	And what's interesting about this
803.2	is that the software is --
806.04	these votes are just text
806.04	typed into a page.
809.6	This is not really a vote
809.6	so much as it is a dialogue.
813.68	Now it is true that at the end of the day,
816.44	an administrator can go through here
816.44	and take a look at this and say,
819.703	"""OK, 18 deletes, two keeps:"
819.703	"we'll delete it."""
822.2	But in other cases,
822.2	this could be 18 deletes and two keeps,
826	and we would keep it,
826	because if those last two keeps say,
828.82	"""Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this"
828.82	but I found it in a book,
831.749	and I found a link
831.749	to a page that describes it,
833.971	and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow,
833.971	"so please don't delete it,"""
837.091	then it would survive.
838.3	And it also matters
838.3	who the people are who are voting.
840.92	Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.
842.849	Down here at the bottom,
842.849	"""Keep, real movie,"" RickK."
845.4	RickK is a very famous Wikipedian
845.4	who does an enormous amount of work
848.805	with vandalism, hoaxes
848.805	and votes for deletion.
851.56	His voice carries a lot of weight
851.56	within the community
854.4	because he knows what he's doing.
857.4	So how is all this governed?
859.36	People really want to know
859.36	about administrators, things like that.
862.52	So the Wikipedia governance model,
862.52	the governance of the community,
866.4	is a very confusing,
866.4	but workable mix of consensus --
870.84	meaning we try not to vote
870.84	on the content of articles,
873.4	because the majority view
873.4	is not necessarily neutral --
877.32	some amount of democracy --
878.64	all of the administrators --
880	these are the people
880	who have the ability to delete pages.
882.82	That doesn't mean that they have
882.82	the right to delete pages.
885.68	They still have to follow all the rules --
885.68	but they're elected by the community.
889.54	Sometimes people --
889.54	random trolls on the Internet --
891.994	like to accuse me
891.994	of handpicking the administrators
894.401	to bias the content of the encyclopedia.
896.33	I always laugh at this, because I have
896.33	no idea how they're elected, actually.
900.12	There's a certain amount of aristocracy.
902.12	You got a hint of that
902.12	when I mentioned, like,
904.287	RickK's voice would carry
904.287	a lot more weight
906.463	than someone we don't know.
907.783	I give this talk sometimes with Angela,
910.52	who was just re-elected to the board
910.52	from the community --
913.275	to the Board of the Foundation,
914.795	with more than twice the votes
914.795	of the person who didn't make it.
917.96	And I always embarrass her because I say,
920.92	"""Well, Angela, for example,"
922.24	could get away with doing
922.24	absolutely anything within Wikipedia,
925.68	"because she's so admired and so powerful."""
927.72	But the irony is, of course, that Angela
927.72	can do this because she's the one person
931.56	who you know would never, ever
931.56	break any rules of Wikipedia.
934.56	And I also like to say
934.56	she's the only person
936.64	who actually knows
936.64	all the rules of Wikipedia, so ...
939.88	And then there's monarchy,
941.143	and that's my role
941.143	on the community, so ...
943.183	(Laughter)
945.6	I was describing this in Berlin once,
948.24	and the next day
948.24	in the newspaper the headline said,
951.04	"""I am the Queen of England."""
952.632	(Laughter)
953.807	And that's not exactly what I said, but --
956.2	(Laughter)
957.72	the point is my role in the community --
960.32	Within the free software world,
960.32	there's been a long-standing tradition
965.04	"of the ""benevolent dictator"" model."
968.28	So if you look at most
968.28	of the major free software projects,
971.16	they have one single person in charge
972.96	who everyone agrees
972.96	is the benevolent dictator.
976.32	Well, I don't like the term
976.32	"""benevolent dictator,"""
978.84	and I don't think that it's my job
978.84	or my role in the world of ideas
982.84	to be the dictator of the future
982.84	of all human knowledge
986.2	compiled by the world.
987.44	It just isn't appropriate.
989.16	But there is a need still
989.16	for a certain amount of monarchy,
991.96	a certain amount of --
993.56	sometimes we have to make a decision
995.36	and we don't want
995.36	to get bogged down too heavily
997.623	in formal decision-making processes.
1000.36	So as an example
1000.36	of how this can be important:
1005.28	we recently had a situation where
1005.28	a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia,
1009.28	and they said,
1009.28	"""Oh, well, this is horrible,"
1012.16	this Jewish conspiracy of a website,
1014.08	and we're going to get certain articles
1014.08	deleted that we don't like.
1017.263	And we see they have a voting process,
1017.263	so we're going to send --
1020.287	we have 40,000 members
1020.287	and we're going to send them over
1023.12	and they're all going to vote
1023.12	"and get these pages deleted."""
1025.922	Well, they managed
1025.922	to get 18 people to show up.
1028.137	That's neo-Nazi math for you.
1030.92	They always think they've got
1034.4	But they managed to get 18 people
1034.4	to come and vote in a fairly absurd way
1037.92	to delete a perfectly valid article.
1039.96	Of course, the vote ended up
1039.96	being about 85 to 18,
1042.72	so there was no real danger
1042.72	to our democratic processes.
1046	On the other hand, people said,
1046	"""But what are we going to do?"
1049.319	I mean, this could happen.
1050.599	What if some group
1050.599	gets really seriously organized
1052.96	"and comes in and wants to vote?"""
1055.56	"Then I said, ""Well, fuck it,"
1055.56	"we'll just change the rules."""
1058.359	That's my job in the community:
1060.079	to say we won't allow
1060.079	our openness and freedom
1063.68	to undermine the quality of the content.
1066.28	And so, as long as people
1066.28	trust me in my role,
1069.599	then that's a valid place for me.
1071.48	Of course, because of the free licensing,
1073.54	if I do a bad job, the volunteers
1073.54	are more than happy to take and leave --
1077.041	I can't tell anyone what to do.
1079	So the final point here
1079	is that to understand how Wikipedia works,
1083.72	it's important to understand
1083.72	that our wiki model is the way we work,
1086.935	but we are not fanatical web anarchists.
1090.56	In fact, we're very flexible
1090.56	about the social methodology,
1093.96	because ultimately,
1093.96	the passion of the community
1096.4	is for the quality of the work,
1098.44	not necessarily for the process
1098.44	that we use to generate it.
1101.44	Thank you.
1102.68	(Applause)
1106.96	Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.
1108.76	Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality
1108.76	being a key to Wikipedia's success.
1112.92	It strikes me that much of the textbooks
1112.92	that are used to educate our children
1118.28	are inherently biased.
1120.08	Have you found Wikipedia
1120.08	being used by teachers
1123.72	and how do you see Wikipedia
1123.72	changing education?
1126.2	Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers
1126.2	are beginning to use Wikipedia.
1130.44	There's a media storyline about Wikipedia,
1130.44	which I think is false.
1135.04	It builds on the storyline
1135.04	of bloggers versus newspapers.
1138.64	And the storyline is,
1138.64	there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia,
1141.8	but academics hate it
1141.8	and teachers hate it.
1145.28	And that turns out to not be true.
1147.88	The last time I got an email
1147.88	from a journalist saying,
1150.44	"""Why do academics hate Wikipedia?"""
1152.18	I sent it from my Harvard email address
1154.062	because I was recently
1154.062	appointed a fellow there.
1156.339	"And I said, ""Well,"
1156.339	"they don't all hate it."""
1158.379	(Laughter)
1159.48	But I think there's going
1159.48	to be huge impacts.
1162.36	And we actually have a project
1162.36	that I'm personally really excited about,
1165.8	which is the Wikibooks project,
1167.32	which is an effort to create
1167.32	textbooks in all the languages.
1170.44	And that's a much bigger project.
1172.04	It's going to take 20 years or so
1172.04	to come to fruition.
1176.68	But part of that is to fulfill our mission
1178.72	of giving an encyclopedia
1178.72	to every single person on the planet.
1181.72	We don't mean we're going
1181.72	to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.
1184.6	We mean we're going to give them
1184.6	a tool that they can use.
1187.42	And for a lot of people in the world,
1189.22	if I give you an encyclopedia
1189.22	that's written at a university level,
1192.42	it doesn't do you any good
1192.42	without a whole host of literacy materials
1196	to build you up to the point
1196	where you can actually use it.
1198.8	The Wikibooks project
1198.8	is an effort to do that.
1200.967	And I think that we're going to see --
1200.967	it may not even come from us;
1204.2	there's all kinds of innovation going on.
1206.2	But freely licensed textbooks
1206.2	are the next big thing in education.
