12.604	When I was President of the American
12.604	Psychological Association,
15.7	they tried to media-train me.
17.35	And an encounter I had with CNN summarizes
23.05	what I'm going to be talking about today,
25.062	which is the eleventh reason
25.062	to be optimistic.
28.16	The editor of Discover told us 10 of them;
34.359	I'm going to give you the eleventh.
36.478	So they came to me, CNN,
36.478	"and they said, ""Professor Seligman --"
41.71	would you tell us about the state
41.71	of psychology today?
44.947	"We'd like to interview you about that."""
46.888	"And I said, ""Great."""
48.126	"And she said, ""But this is CNN,"
48.126	"so you only get a sound bite."""
53.469	"I said, ""Well, how many words do I get?"""
56.707	"And she said, ""Well, one."""
58.368	(Laughter)
60.178	And the cameras rolled, and she said,
62.541	"""Professor Seligman,"
62.541	"what is the state of psychology today?"""
67.388	"""Good."""
68.571	(Laughter)
70.723	"""Cut! Cut. That won't do."
75.064	We'd really better give
75.064	"you a longer sound bite."""
77.87	"""How many words do I get this time?"""
79.624	"""Well, you get two."""
81.064	(Laughter)
82.82	"""Doctor Seligman, what is the state"
82.82	"of psychology today?"""
87.767	"""Not good."""
88.963	(Laughter)
100.717	"""Look, Doctor Seligman,"
101.913	we can see you're really
101.913	not comfortable in this medium.
104.931	We'd better give you a real sound bite.
107.344	This time you can have three words.
110.449	Professor Seligman, what is the state
110.449	"of psychology today?"""
115.362	"""Not good enough."""
118.165	That's what I'm going to be talking about.
120.273	I want to say why psychology
120.273	was good, why it was not good,
124.406	and how it may become,
124.406	in the next 10 years, good enough.
128.902	And by parallel summary, I want to say
128.902	the same thing about technology,
133.238	about entertainment and design,
134.967	because I think the issues
134.967	are very similar.
137.495	So, why was psychology good?
140.547	Well, for more than 60 years, psychology
140.547	worked within the disease model.
145.16	Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane
147.16	and I introduced myself to my seatmate,
147.16	and told them what I did,
151.207	they'd move away from me,
154.022	because, quite rightly, they were saying
156.497	psychology is about finding
156.497	what's wrong with you.
159.12	Spot the loony.
160.555	And now, when I tell people
160.555	what I do, they move toward me.
164.951	What was good about psychology --
169.364	about the $30 billion
169.364	investment NIMH made,
172.41	about working in the disease model,
174.16	about what you mean by psychology --
176.641	is that, 60 years ago,
176.641	none of the disorders were treatable;
181.055	it was entirely smoke and mirrors.
182.991	And now, 14 of the disorders
182.991	are treatable,
185.478	two of them actually curable.
187.891	And the other thing that happened
187.891	is that a science developed,
192.64	a science of mental illness.
194.592	We found out we could take fuzzy concepts
199.392	like depression, alcoholism,
202.396	and measure them with rigor;
204.429	that we could create a classification
204.429	of the mental illnesses;
208.604	that we could understand
208.604	the causality of the mental illnesses.
213.309	We could look across time
213.309	at the same people --
217.16	people, for example, who were genetically
217.16	vulnerable to schizophrenia --
221.161	and ask what the contribution
221.161	of mothering, of genetics are,
226.397	and we could isolate third variables
228.785	by doing experiments
228.785	on the mental illnesses.
231.649	And best of all, we were able,
231.649	in the last 50 years,
235.175	to invent drug treatments
235.175	and psychological treatments.
239.882	And then we were able
239.882	to test them rigorously,
243.16	in random-assignment,
243.16	placebo-controlled designs,
246.477	throw out the things that didn't work,
248.753	keep the things that actively did.
250.856	The conclusion of that is,
254.043	psychology and psychiatry
254.043	of the last 60 years
257.16	can actually claim that we can make
257.16	miserable people less miserable.
262.818	And I think that's terrific.
264.994	I'm proud of it.
269.993	But what was not good,
269.993	the consequences of that,
273.675	were three things.
275.115	The first was moral;
276.917	that psychologists and psychiatrists
276.917	became victimologists, pathologizers;
281.735	that our view of human nature
281.735	was that if you were in trouble,
284.801	bricks fell on you.
286.574	And we forgot that people
286.574	made choices and decisions.
289.339	We forgot responsibility.
291.228	That was the first cost.
293.377	The second cost was
293.377	that we forgot about you people.
297.681	We forgot about improving normal lives.
301.26	We forgot about a mission to make
301.26	relatively untroubled people happier,
307.16	more fulfilled, more productive.
309.964	"And ""genius,"" ""high-talent,"""
309.964	became a dirty word.
313.687	No one works on that.
315.722	And the third problem
315.722	about the disease model is,
319.16	in our rush to do something
319.16	about people in trouble,
322.465	in our rush to do something
322.465	about repairing damage,
327.593	it never occurred to us
327.593	to develop interventions
330.232	to make people happier --
330.232	positive interventions.
334.495	So that was not good.
336.36	And so that's what led people
336.36	like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,
341.213	Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself
343.146	to work in something I call,
343.146	"""positive psychology,"""
346.03	which has three aims.
347.839	The first is that psychology
347.839	should be just as concerned
352.749	with human strength
352.749	as it is with weakness.
356.16	It should be just as concerned
356.16	with building strength
360.83	as with repairing damage.
362.992	It should be interested
362.992	in the best things in life.
365.699	And it should be just as concerned
367.597	with making the lives
367.597	of normal people fulfilling,
371.334	and with genius,
371.334	with nurturing high talent.
376.228	So in the last 10 years
376.228	and the hope for the future,
380.735	we've seen the beginnings
380.735	of a science of positive psychology,
384.16	a science of what makes life worth living.
386.699	It turns out that we can measure
386.699	different forms of happiness.
391.268	And any of you, for free,
391.268	can go to that website --
394.772	[www.authentichappiness.org]
396.187	and take the entire panoply
396.187	of tests of happiness.
398.69	You can ask, how do you stack
398.69	up for positive emotion, for meaning,
403.16	for flow, against literally tens
403.16	of thousands of other people?
407.878	We created the opposite of the diagnostic
407.878	manual of the insanities:
413.16	a classification of the strengths
413.16	and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,
418.405	how they're defined, how to diagnose them,
420.635	what builds them
420.635	and what gets in their way.
425.16	We found that we could discover
425.16	the causation of the positive states,
429.623	the relationship between left
429.623	hemispheric activity
433.16	and right hemispheric activity,
433.16	as a cause of happiness.
440.66	I've spent my life working
440.66	on extremely miserable people,
443.661	and I've asked the question:
445.072	How do extremely miserable people
445.072	differ from the rest of you?
448.749	And starting about six years ago,
448.749	we asked about extremely happy people.
453.16	How do they differ from the rest of us?
455.724	It turns out there's one way,
455.724	very surprising --
459.231	they're not more religious,
459.231	they're not in better shape,
461.923	they don't have more money,
461.923	they're not better looking,
465.035	they don't have more good events
465.035	and fewer bad events.
467.814	The one way in which they differ:
467.814	they're extremely social.
472.964	They don't sit in seminars
472.964	on Saturday morning.
475.689	(Laughter)
480.137	They don't spend time alone.
481.661	Each of them is in a romantic relationship
483.883	and each has a rich repertoire of friends.
487.055	But watch out here -- this is merely
487.055	correlational data, not causal,
491.456	and it's about happiness
491.456	"in the first, ""Hollywood"" sense,"
495.078	I'm going to talk about,
496.314	happiness of ebullience
496.314	and giggling and good cheer.
500.504	And I'm going to suggest to you
500.504	that's not nearly enough,
503.363	in just a moment.
505.584	We found we could begin to look
505.584	at interventions over the centuries,
509.989	from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.
511.806	About 120 interventions have been proposed
511.806	that allegedly make people happy.
517.016	And we find that we've been able
517.016	to manualize many of them,
521.662	and we actually carry out
523.605	random-assignment efficacy
523.605	and effectiveness studies.
527.271	That is, which ones actually
527.271	make people lastingly happier?
531.451	In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you
531.451	about some of those results.
534.702	But the upshot of this is that the mission
534.702	I want psychology to have,
541.16	in addition to its mission
541.16	of curing the mentally ill,
544.671	and in addition to its mission of making
544.671	miserable people less miserable,
548.969	is, can psychology actually
548.969	make people happier?
552.922	"And to ask that question -- ""happy"""
552.922	is not a word I use very much --
557.595	we've had to break it down
559.032	into what I think
559.032	"is askable about ""happy."""
561.588	And I believe there are three different --
565.339	"I call them ""different"" because different"
565.339	interventions build them,
568.646	it's possible to have one
568.646	rather than the other --
571.071	three different happy lives.
573.072	The first happy life is the pleasant life.
576.213	This is a life in which you have
576.213	as much positive emotion
579.622	as you possibly can,
581.16	and the skills to amplify it.
583.285	The second is a life of engagement:
585.489	a life in your work, your parenting,
585.489	your love, your leisure;
590.878	time stops for you.
593.302	That's what Aristotle was talking about.
595.374	And third, the meaningful life.
597.465	I want to say a little bit
597.465	about each of those lives
600.16	and what we know about them.
602.001	The first life is the pleasant life,
602.001	and it's simply, as best we can find it,
607.003	it's having as many
607.003	of the pleasures as you can,
609.314	as much positive emotion as you can,
611.713	and learning the skills -- savoring,
611.713	mindfulness -- that amplify them,
618.274	that stretch them over time and space.
621.16	But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,
625.16	and it's why positive psychology
625.16	is not happy-ology,
628.692	and why it doesn't end here.
631.041	The first drawback is,
631.041	it turns out the pleasant life,
634.16	your experience of positive emotion,
636.819	is about 50 percent heritable,
641.566	and, in fact, not very modifiable.
645.16	So the different tricks
645.16	that Matthieu and I and others know
649.723	about increasing the amount
649.723	of positive emotion in your life
653.358	are 15 to 20 percent tricks,
653.358	getting more of it.
657.656	Second is that positive
657.656	emotion habituates.
661.922	It habituates rapidly, indeed.
665.746	It's all like French vanilla ice cream:
668.14	the first taste is 100 percent;
670.779	by the time you're down
670.779	to the sixth taste,
672.972	it's gone.
675.817	And, as I said,
675.817	it's not particularly malleable.
680.6	And this leads to the second life.
682.491	I have to tell you about my friend Len,
684.453	to talk about why positive psychology
684.453	is more than positive emotion,
690.388	more than building pleasure.
692.16	In two of the three great arenas
692.16	of life, by the time Len was 30,
696.16	Len was enormously successful.
698.608	The first arena was work.
702.16	By the time he was 20,
702.16	he was an options trader.
704.82	By the time he was 25,
704.82	he was a multimillionaire
707.271	and the head of an options
707.271	trading company.
710.16	Second, in play, he's a national
710.16	champion bridge player.
717.366	But in the third great arena of life,
717.366	love, Len is an abysmal failure.
722.16	And the reason he was,
722.16	was that Len is a cold fish.
728.16	(Laughter)
730.254	Len is an introvert.
734.692	American women said to Len,
734.692	when he dated them,
738.16	"""You're no fun. You don't have"
738.16	"positive emotion. Get lost."""
742.947	And Len was wealthy enough to be able
742.947	to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,
748.16	who for five years tried
748.16	to find the sexual trauma
751.928	that had somehow locked
751.928	positive emotion inside of him.
755.897	But it turned out there wasn't
755.897	any sexual trauma.
759.075	It turned out that --
761.29	Len grew up in Long Island
763.693	and he played football
763.693	and watched football, and played bridge.
770.536	Len is in the bottom five percent
770.536	of what we call positive affectivities.
774.77	The question is: Is Len unhappy?
776.818	And I want to say, not.
778.587	Contrary to what psychology told us
781.57	about the bottom 50 percent
781.57	of the human race in positive affectivity,
785.746	I think Len is one
785.746	of the happiest people I know.
788.362	He's not consigned
788.362	to the hell of unhappiness,
791.032	and that's because Len, like most of you,
794.971	is enormously capable of flow.
797.057	When he walks onto the floor
797.057	of the American Exchange
800.055	at 9:30 in the morning,
802.318	time stops for him.
803.633	And it stops till the closing bell.
805.419	When the first card is played
805.419	till 10 days later,
808.343	when the tournament is over,
809.725	time stops for Len.
811.836	And this is indeed
811.836	what Mike Csikszentmihalyi
815.072	has been talking about, about flow.
816.998	And it's distinct from pleasure
816.998	in a very important way:
820.399	pleasure has raw feel -- you know
820.399	it's happening; it's thought and feeling.
825.827	But what Mike told you
825.827	yesterday -- during flow ...
831.079	you can't feel anything.
834.732	You're one with the music.
836.824	Time stops.
838.101	You have intense concentration.
840.019	And this is indeed the characteristic
840.019	of what we think of as the good life.
845.262	And we think there's a recipe for it,
848.071	and it's knowing what
848.071	your highest strengths are --
850.689	again, there's a valid test
853.007	of what your five highest strengths are --
855.414	and then re-crafting your life
858.167	to use them as much as you possibly can.
861.451	Re-crafting your work, your love,
864.16	your play, your friendship,
864.16	your parenting.
866.941	Just one example.
869.248	One person I worked with
869.248	was a bagger at Genuardi's.
873.316	Hated the job.
874.505	She's working her way through college.
876.929	Her highest strength
876.929	was social intelligence.
880.088	So she re-crafted bagging
880.088	to make the encounter with her
884.827	the social highlight
884.827	of every customer's day.
888.082	Now, obviously she failed.
889.822	But what she did was to take
889.822	her highest strengths,
893.16	and re-craft work to use them
893.16	as much as possible.
897.16	What you get out of that
897.16	is not smiley-ness.
899.532	You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.
901.459	You don't giggle a lot.
902.887	What you get is more absorption.
906.16	So, that's the second path.
908.258	The first path, positive emotion;
910.634	the second path is eudaemonian flow;
913.754	and the third path is meaning.
916.16	This is the most venerable
916.16	of the happinesses, traditionally.
920.16	And meaning, in this view, consists of --
923.683	very parallel to eudaemonia --
926.627	it consists of knowing
926.627	what your highest strengths are,
930.214	and using them to belong to
930.214	and in the service of
934.881	something larger than you are.
939.082	I mentioned that for all three
939.082	kinds of lives --
943.407	the pleasant life, the good life,
943.407	the meaningful life --
946.774	people are now
946.774	hard at work on the question:
948.962	Are there things that lastingly
948.962	change those lives?
953.928	And the answer seems to be yes.
956.951	And I'll just give you some samples of it.
959.53	It's being done in a rigorous manner.
961.718	It's being done in the same way
961.718	that we test drugs
964.579	to see what really works.
966.673	So we do random-assignment,
966.673	placebo-controlled,
971.51	long-term studies
971.51	of different interventions.
974.381	Just to sample the kind of interventions
974.381	that we find have an effect:
978.91	when we teach people
978.91	about the pleasant life,
982.16	how to have more pleasure in your life,
984.16	one of your assignments
984.16	is to take the mindfulness skills,
988.203	the savoring skills,
990.642	and you're assigned
990.642	to design a beautiful day.
994.333	Next Saturday, set a day aside,
994.333	design yourself a beautiful day,
999.371	and use savoring and mindfulness
999.371	to enhance those pleasures.
1003.589	And we can show in that way
1003.589	that the pleasant life is enhanced.
1009.898	Gratitude visit.
1013.243	I want you all to do this
1013.243	with me now, if you would.
1015.923	Close your eyes.
1018.972	I'd like you to remember someone
1023.34	who did something enormously important
1026.412	that changed your life
1026.412	in a good direction,
1030.16	and who you never properly thanked.
1033.307	The person has to be alive.
1036.16	Now, OK, you can open your eyes.
1038.347	I hope all of you have such a person.
1040.705	Your assignment, when you're learning
1040.705	the gratitude visit,
1044.327	is to write a 300-word
1044.327	testimonial to that person,
1048.694	call them on the phone in Phoenix,
1051.321	ask if you can visit, don't tell them why.
1053.992	Show up at their door,
1056.459	you read the testimonial --
1056.459	everyone weeps when this happens.
1061.739	And what happens is, when we test people
1064.665	one week later, a month later,
1064.665	three months later,
1067.808	they're both happier and less depressed.
1071.882	Another example is a strengths date,
1074.241	in which we get couples to identify
1074.241	their highest strengths
1078.447	on the strengths test,
1079.846	and then to design an evening
1079.846	in which they both use their strengths.
1084.951	We find this is a strengthener
1084.951	of relationships.
1088.948	And fun versus philanthropy.
1090.946	It's so heartening
1090.946	to be in a group like this,
1093.69	in which so many of you have turned
1093.69	your lives to philanthropy.
1097.314	Well, my undergraduates and the people
1097.314	I work with haven't discovered this,
1100.996	so we actually have people
1100.996	do something altruistic
1104.582	and do something fun,
1106.357	and contrast it.
1107.535	And what you find
1107.535	is when you do something fun,
1110.16	it has a square wave walk set.
1112.073	When you do something philanthropic
1112.073	to help another person,
1115.733	it lasts and it lasts.
1118.686	So those are examples
1118.686	of positive interventions.
1122.84	So the next to last thing
1122.84	I want to say is:
1127.16	we're interested in how much
1127.16	life satisfaction people have.
1130.303	This is really what you're about.
1132.267	And that's our target variable.
1134.16	And we ask the question as a function
1134.16	of the three different lives,
1138.16	how much life satisfaction do you get?
1140.907	So we ask -- and we've done this
1140.907	in 15 replications,
1144.036	involving thousands of people:
1146.438	To what extent does
1146.438	the pursuit of pleasure,
1148.957	the pursuit of positive emotion,
1151.303	the pleasant life,
1152.501	the pursuit of engagement,
1152.501	time stopping for you,
1155.933	and the pursuit of meaning
1155.933	contribute to life satisfaction?
1159.331	And our results surprised us;
1159.331	they were backward of what we thought.
1162.949	It turns out the pursuit of pleasure
1162.949	has almost no contribution
1166.477	to life satisfaction.
1168.16	The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.
1170.713	The pursuit of engagement
1170.713	is also very strong.
1175.16	Where pleasure matters
1175.16	is if you have both engagement
1179.818	and you have meaning,
1181.451	then pleasure's the whipped
1181.451	cream and the cherry.
1183.764	Which is to say, the full life --
1183.764	the sum is greater than the parts,
1190.306	if you've got all three.
1191.736	Conversely, if you have none
1191.736	of the three, the empty life,
1195.002	the sum is less than the parts.
1196.683	And what we're asking now is:
1196.683	Does the very same relationship --
1200.958	physical health, morbidity,
1200.958	how long you live and productivity --
1205.925	follow the same relationship?
1207.358	That is, in a corporation,
1209.86	is productivity a function of positive
1209.86	emotion, engagement and meaning?
1215.723	Is health a function
1215.723	of positive engagement,
1218.914	of pleasure, and of meaning in life?
1221.675	And there is reason to think the answer
1221.675	to both of those may well be yes.
1228.364	So, Chris said that the last
1228.364	speaker had a chance
1232.817	to try to integrate what he heard,
1235.262	and so this was amazing for me.
1236.992	I've never been in a gathering like this.
1240.961	I've never seen speakers stretch
1240.961	beyond themselves so much,
1244.709	which was one of the remarkable things.
1247.16	But I found that the problems
1247.16	of psychology seemed to be parallel
1251.16	to the problems of technology,
1251.16	entertainment and design
1255.399	in the following way:
1256.898	we all know that technology,
1256.898	entertainment and design
1260.404	have been and can be used
1260.404	for destructive purposes.
1266.531	We also know that technology,
1266.531	entertainment and design
1270.71	can be used to relieve misery.
1273.711	And by the way, the distinction
1273.711	between relieving misery
1277.16	and building happiness
1277.16	is extremely important.
1280.16	I thought, when I first became
1280.16	a therapist 30 years ago,
1283.795	that if I was good enough
1283.795	to make someone not depressed,
1289.16	not anxious, not angry,
1293.027	that I'd make them happy.
1295.062	And I never found that;
1296.461	I found the best you could ever do
1298.507	was to get to zero;
1300.51	that they were empty.
1301.748	And it turns out the skills of happiness,
1301.748	the skills of the pleasant life,
1307.378	the skills of engagement,
1307.378	the skills of meaning,
1309.773	are different from the skills
1309.773	of relieving misery.
1314.495	And so, the parallel thing holds
1314.495	with technology, entertainment
1319.89	and design, I believe.
1321.487	That is, it is possible
1321.487	for these three drivers of our world
1328.39	to increase happiness,
1330.918	to increase positive emotion.
1333.83	And that's typically
1333.83	how they've been used.
1336.041	But once you fractionate
1336.041	happiness the way I do --
1339.063	not just positive emotion,
1339.063	that's not nearly enough --
1342.16	there's flow in life,
1342.16	and there's meaning in life.
1345.666	As Laura Lee told us,
1347.16	design and, I believe,
1347.16	entertainment and technology,
1350.852	can be used to increase meaning
1350.852	engagement in life as well.
1355.607	So in conclusion,
1357.251	the eleventh reason for optimism,
1359.702	in addition to the space elevator,
1362.901	is that I think with technology,
1362.901	entertainment and design,
1368.056	we can actually increase
1368.056	the amount of tonnage
1371.828	of human happiness on the planet.
1374.681	And if technology can,
1374.681	in the next decade or two,
1378.968	increase the pleasant life,
1378.968	the good life and the meaningful life,
1382.856	it will be good enough.
1384.37	If entertainment can be diverted
1384.37	to also increase positive emotion,
1390.127	meaning eudaemonia,
1393.245	it will be good enough.
1394.708	And if design can increase
1394.708	positive emotion,
1400.742	eudaemonia, and flow and meaning,
1403.761	what we're all doing together
1403.761	will become good enough.
1407.324	Thank you.
1408.527	(Applause)
