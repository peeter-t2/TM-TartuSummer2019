12.4	Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards
15.489	from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.
19.115	My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,
22.262	was going berserk,
23.85	and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,
27.297	and frantic. My God.
30.093	I was there covering the 25th anniversary
32.843	of the world's worst nuclear accident,
35.993	as you can see by the look on my face,
37.942	reluctantly so, but with good reason,
40.833	because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days
44.296	back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation
48.712	as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,
50.928	and the sarcophagus, which is the covering
53.402	over reactor number four,
54.979	which was hastily built 27 years ago,
57.861	now sits cracked and rusted
59.779	and leaking radiation.
61.495	So I was filming.
63.173	I just wanted to get the job done
64.479	and get out of there fast.
67.066	But then, I looked into the distance,
69.35	and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,
72.627	and I'm thinking, who could be living here?
75.17	I mean, after all, Chernobyl's soil, water and air,
78.762	are among the most highly contaminated on Earth,
81.472	and the reactor sits at the the center of
83.09	a tightly regulated exclusion zone, or dead zone,
86.736	and it's a nuclear police state, complete with border guards.
90.081	You have to have dosimeter at all times, clicking away,
92.628	you have to have a government minder,
94.549	and there's draconian radiation rules
97.185	and constant contamination monitoring.
101.89	The point being, no human being
104.042	should be living anywhere near the dead zone.
106.928	But they are.
108.521	It turns out an unlikely community
111.174	of some 200 people are living inside the zone.
114.627	They're called self-settlers.
116.485	And almost all of them are women,
119.125	the men having shorter lifespans
120.993	in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,
123.31	if not radiation.
125.298	Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated
127.536	at the time of the accident,
129.156	but not everybody accepted that fate.
131.617	The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,
134.41	are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities
137.405	and, it would seem, common sense,
139.355	and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.
143.045	They did so illegally.
145.529	As one woman put it to a soldier
147.446	who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,
150.26	"""Shoot me and dig the grave."
152.083	"Otherwise, I'm going home."""
154.661	Now why would they return to such deadly soil?
157.196	I mean, were they unaware of the risks
159.104	or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
162.115	The thing is, they see their lives
163.587	and the risks they run decidedly differently.
167.119	Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,
170.372	eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,
174.703	totally contaminated.
176.626	Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,
179.765	but a few are left like this,
181.798	kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.
185.351	Others have a few residents in them,
187.662	"one or two ""babushkas,"" or ""babas,"""
190.127	which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.
193.316	Another village might have six or seven residents.
196.399	So this is the strange demographic of the zone --
199.129	isolated alone together.
201.998	And when I made my way to that piping chimney
204.201	I'd seen in the distance,
205.872	I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.
209.118	She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,
212.184	population eight.
214.146	(Laughter)
216.109	And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,
219.342	"""Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."""
223.351	And you have to remember, these women have
224.984	survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.
228.852	Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,
232.423	killed millions of Ukrainians,
234.254	and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,
236.277	who came through slashing, burning, raping,
239.253	and in fact many of these women
240.869	were shipped to Germany as forced labor.
243.954	So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,
246.414	Chernobyl happened,
247.609	they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy
250.671	that was invisible.
252.849	So they returned to their villages
254.838	and are told they're going to get sick and die soon,
258.058	but five happy years, their logic goes,
260.623	is better than 10 stuck in a high rise
263.178	on the outskirts of Kiev,
265.038	separated from the graves of their mothers
267.216	and fathers and babies,
269.536	the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon.
273.492	For them, environmental contamination
275.89	may not be the worst sort of devastation.
278.44	It turns out this holds true
279.76	for other species as well.
281.851	Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned
284.798	to the region in force,
286.548	the very real, very negative effects of radiation
289.803	being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus
293.361	of humans.
295.112	The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.
299.805	And there is a kind of heroic resilience,
302.863	a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those
305.734	who start their day at 5 a.m.
308.226	pulling water from a well
310.469	and end it at midnight
312.173	poised to beat a bucket with a stick
314.237	and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes,
317.137	their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.
322.289	And there's a patina of simple defiance among them.
325.699	"""They told us our legs would hurt, and they do. So what?"""
329.537	I mean, what about their health?
331.239	The benefits of hardy, physical living,
334.061	but an environment made toxic
335.665	by a complicated, little-understood enemy, radiation.
339.648	It's incredibly difficult to parse.
341.783	Health studies from the region
343.6	are conflicting and fraught.
346.34	The World Health Organization
347.733	puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths
350.463	at 4,000, eventually.
352.781	Greenpeace and other organizations
355.419	put that number in the tens of thousands.
358.577	Now everybody agrees that thyroid cancers
361.569	are sky high, and that Chernobyl evacuees
364.186	suffer the trauma of relocated peoples everywhere:
367.253	higher levels of anxiety, depression, alcoholism,
370.531	unemployment and, importantly,
372.711	disrupted social networks.
375.954	Now, like many of you,
378.36	I have moved maybe 20, 25 times in my life.
382.985	Home is a transient concept.
386.407	I have a deeper connection to my laptop
388.584	than any bit of soil.
392.926	So it's hard for us to understand, but home
395.165	is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka,
398.338	and connection to the land is palpable.
401.794	And perhaps because these Ukrainian women
403.585	were schooled under the Soviets
405.588	and versed in the Russian poets,
407.83	aphorisms about these ideas
409.388	slip from their mouths all the time.
411.585	"""If you leave, you die."""
414.592	"""Those who left are worse off now."
416.559	"They are dying of sadness."""
418.2	"""Motherland is motherland. I will never leave."""
422.687	What sounds like faith, soft faith,
425.943	may actually be fact,
429.068	because the surprising truth --
430.69	I mean, there are no studies, but the truth seems to be
433.076	that these women who returned to their homes
435.648	and have lived on some of the most radioactive land
437.728	on Earth for the last 27 years,
439.934	have actually outlived their counterparts
442.289	who accepted relocation,
444.336	by some estimates up to 10 years.
448.462	How could this be?
450.642	Here's a theory: Could it be
452.341	that those ties to ancestral soil,
455.406	the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms,
457.972	actually affect longevity?
460.836	The power of motherland
462.595	so fundamental to that part of the world
465.053	seems palliative.
466.865	Home and community are forces
469.662	that rival even radiation.
473.722	Now radiation or not,
476.2	these women are at the end of their lives.
478.804	In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,
482.797	and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,
487.024	full only of animals and occasionally
490.138	daring, flummoxed scientists.
493.23	But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,
496.332	whose numbers have been halved
498.039	in the three years I've known them,
500.181	will leave us with powerful new templates
502.379	to think about and grapple with,
504.395	about the relative nature of risk,
508.058	about transformative connections to home,
511.905	and about the magnificent tonic
515.451	of personal agency and self-determination.
519.304	Thank you.
521.239	(Applause)
