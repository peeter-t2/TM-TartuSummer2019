12.881	I have a question.
15.422	Can a computer write poetry?
18.959	This is a provocative question.
21.715	You think about it for a minute,
23.457	and you suddenly have a bunch
23.457	of other questions like:
26.769	What is a computer?
28.71	What is poetry?
30.707	What is creativity?
33.65	But these are questions
34.846	that people spend their entire
34.846	lifetime trying to answer,
37.94	not in a single TED Talk.
40.188	So we're going to have to try
40.188	a different approach.
42.657	So up here, we have two poems.
45.839	One of them is written by a human,
48.139	and the other one's written by a computer.
50.754	I'm going to ask you to tell me
50.754	which one's which.
53.858	Have a go:
55.038	Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /
55.038	My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.
59.118	Am I not / A fly like thee? /
59.118	Or art not thou / A man like me?
62.536	Poem 2: We can feel / Activist
62.536	through your life's / morning /
65.859	Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non
65.859	all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)
70.13	Alright, time's up.
71.513	Hands up if you think Poem 1
71.513	was written by a human.
77.547	OK, most of you.
79.061	Hands up if you think Poem 2
79.061	was written by a human.
83.172	Very brave of you,
84.855	because the first one was written
84.855	by the human poet William Blake.
89.784	The second one was written by an algorithm
92.757	that took all the language
92.757	from my Facebook feed on one day
96.473	and then regenerated it algorithmically,
99.26	according to methods that I'll describe
99.26	a little bit later on.
103.218	So let's try another test.
106.398	Again, you haven't got ages to read this,
108.515	so just trust your gut.
110.151	Poem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks.
110.151	It is interesting / and fascinating
114.22	that a bird will fly and not / roar
114.22	or bark. Enthralling stories about animals
118.547	are in my dreams and I will sing them all
118.547	if I / am not exhausted or weary.
122.631	Poem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate
122.631	sodas! / You are really beautiful!
126.64	Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins!
126.64	All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)
131.022	Alright, time's up.
132.204	So if you think the first poem
132.204	was written by a human,
135.365	put your hand up.
137.687	OK.
138.865	And if you think the second poem
138.865	was written by a human,
141.564	put your hand up.
143.779	We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.
148.157	It was much harder.
149.617	The answer is,
151.353	the first poem was generated
151.353	by an algorithm called Racter,
154.86	that was created back in the 1970s,
157.886	and the second poem was written
157.886	by a guy called Frank O'Hara,
161.099	who happens to be
161.099	one of my favorite human poets.
164.631	(Laughter)
168.046	So what we've just done now
168.046	is a Turing test for poetry.
172.018	The Turing test was first proposed
172.018	by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,
176.589	in order to answer the question,
178.177	can computers think?
180.245	Alan Turing believed that if
180.245	a computer was able
183.039	to have a to have a text-based
183.039	conversation with a human,
186.141	with such proficiency
186.141	such that the human couldn't tell
188.935	whether they are talking
188.935	to a computer or a human,
191.925	then the computer can be said
191.925	to have intelligence.
195.27	So in 2013, my friend
195.27	Benjamin Laird and I,
198.589	we created a Turing test
198.589	for poetry online.
201.601	It's called bot or not,
202.902	and you can go and play it for yourselves.
204.97	But basically, it's the game
204.97	we just played.
207.245	You're presented with a poem,
208.797	you don't know whether it was written
208.797	by a human or a computer
211.849	and you have to guess.
213.039	So thousands and thousands
213.039	of people have taken this test online,
216.254	so we have results.
217.727	And what are the results?
219.704	Well, Turing said that if a computer
219.704	could fool a human
	that it was a human,
225.65	then it passes the Turing test
225.65	for intelligence.
228.625	We have poems on the bot or not database
231.087	that have fooled 65 percent
231.087	of human readers into thinking
234.09	it was written by a human.
235.959	So, I think we have an answer
235.959	to our question.
239.546	According to the logic of the Turing test,
241.918	can a computer write poetry?
243.87	Well, yes, absolutely it can.
247.782	But if you're feeling
247.782	a little bit uncomfortable
250.152	with this answer, that's OK.
252.103	If you're having a bunch
252.103	of gut reactions to it,
254.443	that's also OK because
254.443	this isn't the end of the story.
258.594	Let's play our third and final test.
262	Again, you're going to have to read
263.774	and tell me which you think is human.
265.707	Poem 1: Red flags the reason
265.707	for pretty flags. / And ribbons.
269.449	Ribbons of flags / And wearing material /
269.449	Reasons for wearing material. (...)
273.794	Poem 2: A wounded deer leaps
273.794	highest, / I've heard the daffodil
277.736	I've heard the flag to-day /
277.736	I've heard the hunter tell; /
281.206	'Tis but the ecstasy of death, /
281.206	And then the brake is almost done (...)
284.932	OK, time is up.
286.555	So hands up if you think Poem 1
286.555	was written by a human.
291.973	Hands up if you think Poem 2
291.973	was written by a human.
295.035	Whoa, that's a lot more people.
298.327	So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1
301.319	was written by the very
301.319	human poet Gertrude Stein.
306.1	And Poem 2 was generated
306.1	by an algorithm called RKCP.
311.162	Now before we go on, let me describe
311.162	very quickly and simply,
314.505	how RKCP works.
316.873	So RKCP is an algorithm
316.873	designed by Ray Kurzweil,
320.747	who's a director of engineering at Google
322.993	and a firm believer
322.993	in artificial intelligence.
325.822	So, you give RKCP a source text,
329.837	it analyzes the source text in order
329.837	to find out how it uses language,
334.33	and then it regenerates language
336.302	that emulates that first text.
338.854	So in the poem we just saw before,
340.991	Poem 2, the one that you all
340.991	thought was human,
343.64	it was fed a bunch of poems
345.214	by a poet called Emily Dickinson
347.273	it looked at the way she used language,
349.486	learned the model,
350.675	and then it regenerated a model
350.675	according to that same structure.
356.732	But the important thing to know about RKCP
358.934	is that it doesn't know the meaning
358.934	of the words it's using.
362.359	The language is just raw material,
364.659	it could be Chinese,
364.659	it could be in Swedish,
366.843	it could be the collected language
366.843	from your Facebook feed for one day.
371.046	It's just raw material.
373.38	And nevertheless, it's able
373.38	to create a poem
376.101	that seems more human
376.101	than Gertrude Stein's poem,
379.452	and Gertrude Stein is a human.
382.846	So what we've done here is,
382.846	more or less, a reverse Turing test.
387.94	So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,
387.94	is able to write a poem
393.143	that fools a majority
393.143	of human judges into thinking
396.905	that it was written by a computer.
399.176	Therefore, according to the logic
399.176	of the reverse Turing test,
403.341	Gertrude Stein is a computer.
405.281	(Laughter)
407.358	Feeling confused?
409.193	I think that's fair enough.
411.546	So far we've had humans
411.546	that write like humans,
415.686	we have computers that write
415.686	like computers,
418.821	we have computers that write like humans,
421.9	but we also have,
421.9	perhaps most confusingly,
425.556	humans that write like computers.
428.938	So what do we take from all of this?
431.611	Do we take that William Blake
431.611	is somehow more of a human
434.792	than Gertrude Stein?
436.065	Or that Gertrude Stein is more
436.065	of a computer than William Blake?
439.135	(Laughter)
440.711	These are questions
440.711	I've been asking myself
443.058	for around two years now,
444.547	and I don't have any answers.
446.88	But what I do have are a bunch of insights
449.234	about our relationship with technology.
452.999	So my first insight is that,
452.999	for some reason,
456.632	we associate poetry with being human.
460.197	So that when we ask,
460.197	"""Can a computer write poetry?"""
463.936	we're also asking,
465.153	"""What does it mean to be human"
466.975	and how do we put boundaries
466.975	around this category?
470.171	How do we say who or what
470.171	"can be part of this category?"""
474.376	This is an essentially
474.376	philosophical question, I believe,
477.751	and it can't be answered
477.751	with a yes or no test,
480.004	like the Turing test.
481.805	I also believe that Alan Turing
481.805	understood this,
484.874	and that when he devised
484.874	his test back in 1950,
488.203	he was doing it
488.203	as a philosophical provocation.
493.124	So my second insight is that,
493.124	when we take the Turing test for poetry,
498.689	we're not really testing
498.689	the capacity of the computers
502.173	because poetry-generating algorithms,
505.09	they're pretty simple and have existed,
505.09	more or less, since the 1950s.
511.055	What we are doing with the Turing
511.055	test for poetry, rather,
514.197	is collecting opinions about what
514.197	constitutes humanness.
520.313	So, what I've figured out,
523.066	we've seen this when earlier today,
526.062	we say that William Blake
526.062	is more of a human
528.564	than Gertrude Stein.
530.153	Of course, this doesn't mean
530.153	that William Blake
532.639	was actually more human
534.491	or that Gertrude Stein
534.491	was more of a computer.
537.533	It simply means that the category
537.533	of the human is unstable.
543.45	This has led me to understand
545.548	that the human is not a cold, hard fact.
548.832	Rather, it is something
548.832	that's constructed with our opinions
551.988	and something that changes over time.
556.671	So my final insight is that
556.671	the computer, more or less,
561.174	works like a mirror
561.174	that reflects any idea of a human
565.204	that we show it.
566.958	We show it Emily Dickinson,
568.866	it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
571.768	We show it William Blake,
573.626	that's what it reflects back to us.
575.935	We show it Gertrude Stein,
577.798	what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
581.083	More than any other bit of technology,
583.475	the computer is a mirror that reflects
583.475	any idea of the human we teach it.
590.061	So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing
592.372	a lot about artificial
592.372	intelligence recently.
596.694	And much of the conversation is,
600.292	can we build it?
602.383	Can we build an intelligent computer?
605.542	Can we build a creative computer?
608.329	What we seem to be asking over and over
610.466	is can we build a human-like computer?
613.961	But what we've seen just now
615.541	is that the human
615.541	is not a scientific fact,
618.653	that it's an ever-shifting,
618.653	concatenating idea
622.207	and one that changes over time.
624.762	So that when we begin
624.762	to grapple with the ideas
627.938	of artificial intelligence in the future,
630.348	we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,
632.277	"""Can we build it?"""
633.669	But we should also be asking ourselves,
635.587	"""What idea of the human"
635.587	"do we want to have reflected back to us?"""
639.82	This is an essentially philosophical idea,
642.537	and it's one that can't be answered
642.537	with software alone,
645.558	but I think requires a moment
645.558	of species-wide, existential reflection.
651.04	Thank you.
652.217	(Applause)
