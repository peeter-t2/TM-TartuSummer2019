12.373	Bruno Giussani: Commissioner,
12.373	thank you for coming to TED.
15.196	Ant√≥nio Guterres: Pleasure.
16.537	BG: Let's start with a figure.
18.013	During 2015, almost one million refugees
18.013	and migrants arrived in Europe
22.178	from many different countries,
23.677	of course, from Syria and Iraq,
23.677	but also from Afghanistan
26.399	and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.
28.885	And there have been reactions
28.885	of two different kinds:
31.409	welcoming parties and border fences.
35.148	But I want to look at it a little bit
37.229	from the short-term
37.229	and the long-term perspective.
40.083	And the first question is very simple:
43.599	Why has the movement of refugees
43.599	spiked so fast in the last six months?
48.091	AG: Well, I think, basically,
48.091	what triggered this huge increase
51.408	was the Syrian refugee group.
53.353	There has been an increased movement
53.353	into Europe from Africa, from Asia,
58.113	but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
58.113	we had this massive increase
61.963	in the first months of this year.
64.421	Why? I think there are three reasons,
66.313	two long-term ones and the trigger.
68.37	The long-term ones,
68.37	in relation to Syrians,
70.942	is that hope is less and less
70.942	clear for people.
77.573	I mean, they look at their own country
79.629	and they don't see much hope
79.629	to go back home,
82.334	because there is no political solution,
84.303	so there is no light
84.303	at the end of the tunnel.
87.382	Second, the living conditions
89.03	of the Syrians in the neighboring
89.03	countries have been deteriorating.
92.38	We just had research with the World Bank,
94.657	and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan
99.017	and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon
101.942	live below the national poverty lines.
104.828	Only half of the children go to school,
107.785	which means that people
107.785	are living very badly.
110.831	Not only are they refugees, out of home,
112.779	not only have they suffered
112.779	what they have suffered,
115.255	but they are living in very,
115.255	very dramatic conditions.
117.848	And then the trigger
117.848	was when all of a sudden,
120.192	international aid decreased.
121.919	The World Food Programme was forced,
121.919	for lack of resources,
124.736	to cut by 30 percent food support
124.736	to the Syrian refugees.
127.824	They're not allowed to work,
129.271	so they are totally dependent
129.271	on international support,
132.823	"and they felt, ""The world"
132.823	"is abandoning us."""
135.151	And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.
137.135	All of a sudden, there was a rush,
138.794	and people started to move
138.794	in large numbers
140.833	and, to be absolutely honest,
142.415	if I had been in the same situation
144.638	and I would have been brave
144.638	enough to do it,
146.769	I think I would have done the same.
148.496	BG: But I think what surprised
148.496	many people is it's not only sudden,
152.785	but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.
155.009	The war in Syria has been
155.009	happening for five years.
157.446	Millions of refugees are in camps
157.446	and villages and towns around Syria.
161.13	You have yourself warned
161.13	about the situation
163.534	and about the consequences
163.534	of a breakdown of Libya, for example,
166.841	and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.
170.618	AG: Well, unprepared because divided,
173.101	and when you are divided,
173.101	you don't want to recognize the reality.
176.403	You prefer to postpone decisions,
178.284	because you do not have
178.284	the capacity to make them.
180.744	And the proof is that even when
180.744	the spike occurred,
184.23	Europe remained divided
185.557	and was unable to put in place
185.557	a mechanism to manage the situation.
191.25	You talk about one million people.
192.965	It looks enormous,
194.56	but the population of the European Union
194.56	is 550 million people,
199.084	which means we are talking about one
199.084	per every [550] Europeans.
203.473	Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
203.473	per three Lebanese.
207.426	And Lebanon? Struggling,
207.426	of course, but it's managing.
211.681	So, the question is: is this something
211.681	that could have been managed
215.971	if -- not mentioning the most
215.971	important thing,
219.016	which would have been
219.016	addressing the root causes,
221.412	but forgetting about root causes for now,
223.412	looking at the phenomenon as it is --
225.261	if Europe were able to come
225.261	together in solidarity
229.575	to create an adequate
229.575	reception capacity of entry points?
233.739	But for that, the countries at entry
233.739	points need to be massively supported,
238.447	and then screening the people
238.447	with security checks
241.476	and all the other mechanisms,
242.905	distributing those that are coming
242.905	into all European countries,
246.434	according to the possibilities
246.434	of each country.
248.691	I mean, if you look at
248.691	the relocation program
250.991	that was approved by the Commission,
250.991	always too little too late,
254.078	or by the Council, too little too late --
256.024	BG: It's already breaking down.
257.533	AG: My country is supposed
257.533	to receive four thousand.
260.014	Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.
262.045	So this is perfectly manageable
262.045	if it is managed,
265.838	but in the present circumstances,
265.838	the pressure is at the point of entry,
269.272	and then, as people move
269.272	in this chaotic way through the Balkans,
272.755	then they come to Germany,
272.755	Sweden, basically, and Austria.
276.125	They are the three countries that are,
276.125	in the end, receiving the refugees.
279.655	The rest of Europe is looking
279.655	without doing much.
282.211	BG: Let me try to bring up
282.211	three questions,
284.594	playing a bit devil's advocate.
286.115	I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.
289.061	But I think the questions are very present
291.124	in the minds of many people
291.124	in Europe right now,
293.401	The first, of course, is about numbers.
295.356	You say 550 million versus one million
295.356	is not much, but realistically,
300.186	how many people can Europe take?
302.16	AG: Well, that is a question
302.16	that has no answer,
305.696	because refugees have
305.696	the right to be protected.
309.947	And there is such a thing
309.947	as international law,
313.138	so there is no way you can say,
313.138	"""I take 10,000 and that's finished."""
317.531	I remind you of one thing:
319.342	in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,
319.342	I remember one minister saying,
323.242	"""Turkey will be able to receive"
323.242	"up to 100,000 people."""
326.241	Turkey has now two million
326.241	three-hundred thousand
329.71	or something of the sort,
329.71	if you count all refugees.
332.182	So I don't think it's fair to say
332.182	how many we can take.
336.395	What it is fair to say is:
336.395	how we can we organize ourselves
339.965	to assume our international
339.965	responsibilities?
342.734	And Europe has not been able to do so,
345.208	because basically, Europe is divided
345.208	because there is no solidarity
348.783	in the European project.
349.986	And it's not only about refugees;
349.986	there are many other areas.
353.136	And let's be honest, this is the moment
353.136	in which we need more Europe
356.794	instead of less Europe.
358.354	But as the public less and less believes
358.354	in European institutions,
362.997	it is also each time more difficult
362.997	to convince the public
366.303	that we need more Europe
366.303	to solve these problems.
368.629	BG: We seem to be at the point
370.1	where the numbers turn into political
370.1	shifts, particularly domestically.
373.535	We saw it again this weekend in France,
375.431	but we have seen it over
375.431	and over in many countries:
377.907	in Poland and in Denmark
377.907	and in Switzerland and elsewhere,
380.664	where the mood changes radically
380.664	because of the numbers,
384.237	although they are not very significant
384.237	in absolute numbers.
390.471	The Prime Minister of --
392.548	AG: But, if I may, on these:
394.294	I mean, what does a European see at home
397.619	in a village where there are no migrants?
400.239	What a European sees is, on television,
404.891	every single day, a few months ago,
404.891	opening the news every single day,
409.315	a crowd coming, uncontrolled,
411.777	moving from border to border,
413.541	and the images on television
413.541	were of hundreds
415.745	or thousands of people moving.
417.436	And the idea is that nobody
417.436	is taking care of it --
420.64	this is happening without any
420.64	kind of management.
424.013	And so their idea was,
424.013	"""They are coming to my village."""
426.862	So there was this completely false idea
426.862	that Europe was being invaded
430.959	and our way of life is going to change,
430.959	and everything will --
434.744	And the problem is that if this
434.744	had been properly managed,
438.633	if people had been properly received,
440.519	welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,
440.519	screened at point of entry,
445.258	and the moved by plane
445.258	to different European countries,
447.971	this would not have scared people.
450.153	But, unfortunately, we have
450.153	a lot of people scared,
452.82	just because Europe was not able
452.82	to do the job properly.
455.867	BG: But there are villages in Germany
457.883	with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.
461.243	So, what's your position?
463.241	How do you imagine these people reacting?
465.232	AG: If there would be a proper
465.232	management of the situation
468.129	and the proper distribution
468.129	of people all over Europe,
471.233	you would always have
471.233	the percentage that I mentioned:
474.233	one per each 2,000.
476.059	It is because things are not
476.059	properly managed
478.352	that in the end we have situations
480.136	that are totally impossible to live with,
480.136	and of course if you have a village --
486.577	in Lebanon, there are many villages
488.278	that have more Syrians than Lebanese;
488.278	Lebanon has been living with that.
491.71	I'm not asking for the same
491.71	to happen in Europe,
494.001	for all European villages to have
494.001	more refugees than inhabitants.
497.212	What I am asking is for Europe
497.212	to do the job properly,
500.291	and to be able to organize itself
500.291	to receive people
503.736	as other countries in the world
503.736	were forced to do in the past.
506.688	BG: So, if you look at the global
506.688	situation not only at Europe --
509.776	(Applause)
511.089	BG: Yes!
512.264	(Applause)
516.922	BG: If you look at the global situation,
516.922	so, not only at Europe,
519.967	I know you can make
519.967	a long list of countries
522.095	that are not really stepping up,
525.242	but I'm more interested
525.242	in the other part --
527.714	is there somebody
527.714	who's doing the right thing?
530.402	AG: Well, 86 percent
530.402	of the refugees in the world
532.857	are in the developing world.
534.936	And if you look at
534.936	countries like Ethiopia --
538.28	Ethiopia has received
538.28	more than 600,000 refugees.
542.486	All the borders in Ethiopia are open.
545.304	And they have, as a policy,
547.196	"they call the ""people to people"" policy"
547.196	that every refugee should be received.
551.316	And they have South Sudanese,
552.919	they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.
554.951	They have all the neighbors.
556.832	They have Eritreans.
558.929	And, in general,
560.248	African countries are extremely
560.248	welcoming of refugees coming,
564.452	and I would say that in the Middle East
567.048	and in Asia, we have seen a tendency
567.048	for borders to be open.
572.265	Now we see some problems
572.265	with the Syrian situation,
575.654	as the Syrian situation evolved
575.654	into also a major security crisis,
579.935	but the truth is that for a large period,
582.052	all borders in the Middle East were open.
584.068	The truth is that for Afghans,
585.544	the borders of Pakistan and Iran
585.544	were open for, at the time,
588.401	six million Afghans that came.
590.318	So I would say that even today,
590.318	the trend in the developing world
594.163	has been for borders to be open.
596.513	The trend in the developed world
596.513	is for these questions to become
600.949	more and more complex,
603.079	especially when there is,
603.079	in the public opinion,
605.674	a mixture of discussions between refugee
605.674	protections on one side
610.781	and security questions -- in my opinion,
610.781	misinterpreted -- on the other side.
614.444	BG: We'll come back to that too,
616.009	but you mentioned the cutting
616.009	of funding and the vouchers
618.773	from the World Food Programme.
620.257	That reflects the general underfunding
620.257	of the organizations
623.114	working on these issues.
626.155	Now that the world seems to have woken up,
628.734	are you getting more funding
628.734	and more support,
630.949	or it's still the same?
632.386	AG: We are getting more support.
634.209	I would say that we are coming
634.209	close to the levels of last year.
639.1	We were much worse during the summer.
641.799	But that is clearly insufficient
641.799	to address the needs of the people
645.681	and address the needs of the countries
647.595	that are supporting the people.
649.118	And here we have a basic review
649.118	of the criteria, the objectives,
655.068	the priorities of development
655.068	cooperation that is required.
657.884	For instance, Lebanon and Jordan
657.884	are middle-income countries.
660.911	Because they are middle-income countries,
662.909	they cannot receive soft loans
662.909	or grants from the World Bank.
665.844	Now, today this doesn't make any sense,
668.067	because they are providing
668.067	a global public good.
670.42	They have millions of refugees there,
672.254	and to be honest, they are pillars
672.254	of stability in the region,
675.768	with all the difficulties they face,
677.53	and the first line of defense
677.53	of our collective security.
680.244	So it doesn't make sense
681.431	that these countries
681.431	are not a first priority
683.598	in development cooperation policies.
685.367	And they are not.
686.55	And not only do the refugees live
686.55	in very dramatic circumstances
689.976	inside those countries,
691.23	but the local communities
691.23	themselves are suffering,
694.08	because salaries went down,
697.491	because there are more unemployed,
699.162	because prices and rents went up.
702.238	And, of course, if you look
702.238	at today's situation
706.206	of the indicators in these countries,
709.328	it is clear that, especially
709.328	their poor groups of the population,
714.835	are living worse and worse
714.835	because of the crisis they are facing.
718.094	BG: Who should be providing this support?
720.102	Country by country, international
720.102	organizations, the European Union?
723.447	Who should be coming up with this support?
725.519	AG: We need to join all efforts.
727.088	It's clear that bilateral
727.088	cooperation is essential.
729.657	It's clear that multilateral
729.657	cooperation is essential.
732.444	It's clear that international financial
732.444	institutions should have flexibility
736.063	in order to be able to invest
736.063	more massively
738.806	in support to these countries.
740.356	We need to combine all the instruments
740.356	and to understand that today,
743.626	in protracted situations,
743.626	at a certain moment,
746.096	that it doesn't make sense anymore
746.096	to make a distinction
748.79	between humanitarian aid
748.79	and development aid
752.463	or development processes.
754.836	Because you are talking
754.836	about children in school,
758.463	you are talking about health,
759.896	you are talking about infrastructure
759.896	that is overcrowded.
762.752	You are talking about things
762.752	that require a long-term perspective,
766.345	a development perspective
767.702	and not only an emergency
767.702	humanitarian aid perspective.
771.147	BG: I would like your comment on something
773.195	that was in newspapers this morning.
774.972	It is a statement made
774.972	by the current front-runner
780.368	for the Republican nomination
780.368	for US President, Donald Trump.
783.738	Yesterday, he said this.
785.128	(Laughter)
786.153	No, listen to this. It's interesting.
787.969	"I quote: ""I am calling for a total"
787.969	and complete shutdown
790.863	of Muslims entering the US,
792.585	until our country's representatives
792.585	"can figure out what's going on."""
797.425	How do you react to that?
798.808	AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.
800.916	We have seen several people
800.916	around the world
803.206	with political responsibility
803.206	saying, for instance,
805.643	that Muslims refugees
805.643	should not be received.
808.108	And the reason why they say this
811.632	is because they think
811.632	that by doing or saying this,
814.755	they are protecting
814.755	the security of their countries.
817.361	Now, I've been in government.
818.818	I am very keen on the need for governments
821.12	to protect the security of their countries
823.589	and their people.
824.764	But if you say, like that,
827.711	in the US or in any European country,
830.241	"""We are going to close our doors"
830.241	"to Muslim refugees,"""
834.211	what you are saying
834.211	is the best possible help
837.347	for the propaganda
837.347	of terrorist organizations.
840.146	Because what you are saying --
841.782	(Applause)
847.381	What you are saying will be heard
847.381	by all the Muslims in your own country,
852.988	and it will pave the way
852.988	for the recruitment
855.085	and the mechanisms that,
855.085	through technology,
857.73	Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,
857.73	and all those other groups
861.609	are today penetrating in our societies.
864.031	And it's just telling them,
864.031	"""You are right, we are against you."""
868.176	So obviously, this is creating
868.176	in societies that are all multiethnic,
874.59	multi-religious, multicultural,
876.363	this is creating a situation
876.363	in which, really,
879.759	it is much easier for the propaganda
879.759	of these terrorist organizations
883.173	to be effective in recruiting
883.173	people for terror acts
888.31	within the countries where these kinds
888.31	of sentences are expressed.
892.248	BG: Have the recent attacks in Paris
892.248	and the reactions to them
895.255	made your job more difficult?
897.262	AG: Undoubtedly.
898.645	BG: In what sense?
900.992	AG: In the sense that, I mean,
900.992	for many people the first reaction
905.332	in relation to these kinds of terrorist
905.332	attacks is: close all borders --
908.776	not understanding that the terrorist
908.776	problem in Europe is largely homegrown.
913.245	We have thousands and thousands
913.245	of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,
918.242	so this is not something that you solve
918.242	by just not allowing Syrians to come in.
922.496	And I must say, I am convinced
924.976	that the passport that appeared,
929.172	I believe, was put
929.172	by the person who has blown --
932.943	BG: -- himself up, yeah.
934.498	AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,
936.433	because part of the strategies
936.433	of Daesh is against refugees,
940.075	because they see refugees as people
940.075	that should be with the caliphate
943.512	and are fleeing to the crusaders.
945.988	And I think that is part of Daesh's
945.988	strategy to make Europe react,
950.075	closing its doors to Muslim refugees
952.49	and having an hostility
952.49	towards Muslims inside Europe,
956.205	exactly to facilitate Daesh's work.
959.751	And my deep belief is that
959.751	it was not the refugee movement
964.283	that triggered terrorism.
965.988	I think, as I said,
967.172	essentially terrorism in Europe
967.172	is today a homegrown movement
970.723	in relation to the global situation
970.723	that we are facing,
974.042	and what we need is exactly
974.042	to prove these groups wrong,
978.486	by welcoming and integrating effectively
981.983	those that are coming
981.983	from that part of the world.
984.41	And another thing that I believe
984.41	is that to a large extent,
987.45	what we are today paying for in Europe
989.937	is the failures of integration models
992.131	that didn't work in the '60s,
992.131	in the '70s, in the '80s,
995.296	in relation to big migration flows
995.296	that took place at that time
998.291	and generated what is today
998.291	in many of the people, for instance,
1002.104	of the second generation of communities,
1004.871	a situation of feeling marginalized,
1009.026	having no jobs,
1010.44	having improper education,
1012.003	living in some of the neighborhoods
1012.003	that are not adequately provided
1017.252	by public infrastructure.
1019.518	And this kind of uneasiness,
1019.518	sometimes even anger,
1024.375	that exists in this second generation
1026.868	is largely due to the failure
1026.868	of integration policies,
1029.915	to the failure of what should have been
1029.915	a much stronger investment
1033.82	in creating the conditions for people
1033.82	to live together and respect each other.
1038.232	For me it is clear.
1039.564	(Applause)
1042.829	For me it is clear that all societies
1042.829	will be multiethnic, multicultural,
1046.723	multi-religious in the future.
1048.666	To try to avoid it is,
1048.666	in my opinion, impossible.
1052.42	And for me it's a good thing
1052.42	that they will be like that,
1055.344	but I also recognize that,
1055.344	for that to work properly,
1058.746	you need a huge investment
1060.726	in the social cohesion
1060.726	of your own societies.
1063.186	And Europe, to a large extent,
1063.186	failed in that investment
1066.884	in the past few decades.
1070.121	BG: Question: You are stepping down
1070.121	from your job at the end of the year,
1074.141	after 10 years.
1075.698	If you look back at 2005,
1077.159	when you entered that office
1077.159	for the first time, what do you see?
1081.491	AG: Well, look:
1084.466	In 2005, we were helping
1084.466	one million people go back home
1089.867	in safety and dignity,
1089.867	because conflicts had ended.
1093.692	Last year, we helped 124,000.
1097.659	In 2005, we had about 38 million people
1097.659	displaced by conflict in the world.
1102.771	Today, we have more than 60 million.
1106.052	At that time, we had had, recently,
1109.143	some conflicts that were solved.
1112.393	Now, we see a multiplication
1112.393	of new conflicts
1114.724	and the old conflicts never died:
1116.589	Afghanistan, Somalia,
1116.589	Democratic Republic of Congo.
1119.969	It is clear that the world today
1119.969	is much more dangerous than it was.
1124.049	It is clear that the capacity
1124.049	of the international community
1126.917	to prevent conflicts
1126.917	and to timely solve them,
1129.817	is, unfortunately, much worse
1129.817	than what it was 10 years ago.
1133.995	There are no clear
1133.995	power relations in the world,
1136.764	no global governance mechanisms that work,
1139.281	which means that we live in a situation
1142.084	where impunity and unpredictability
1142.084	tend to prevail, and that means
1147.034	that more and more people suffer,
1149.473	namely those that are
1149.473	displaced by conflicts.
1151.89	BG: It's a tradition in American politics
1153.92	that when a President leaves
1153.92	the Oval Office for the last time,
1157.574	he leaves a handwritten note
1157.574	on the desk for his successor
1160.375	that walks in a couple of hours later.
1162.5	If you had to write such a note
1162.5	to your successor, Filippo Grandi,
1165.709	what would you write?
1166.885	AG: Well, I don't think
1166.885	I would write any message.
1169.973	You know, one of the terrible things
1169.973	when one leaves an office
1172.972	is to try to become the backseat driver,
1175.726	always telling the new one what to do.
1178.637	So that, I will not do.
1180.177	If I had to say something to him,
1182.145	"it would be, ""Be yourself,"
1182.145	"and do your best."""
1184.753	BG: Commissioner, thank you
1184.753	for the job you do.
1187.023	Thank you for coming to TED.
1188.552	(Applause)
