13.478	Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.
15.375	So he's Mario. He's our son.
18.931	He was born two and a half years ago,
21.79	and I had a pretty tough pregnancy
25.003	because I had to stay still
25.003	in a bed for, like, eight months.
29.153	But in the end everything
29.153	seemed to be under control.
32.212	So he got the right weight at birth.
35.066	He got the right Apgar index.
37.213	So we were pretty reassured by this.
40.298	But at the end, 10 days
40.298	later after he was born,
47.15	we discovered that he had a stroke.
49.697	As you might know,
51.567	a stroke is a brain injury.
54.133	A perinatal stroke could be something
56.843	that can happen
56.843	during the nine months of pregnancy
60.758	or just suddenly after the birth,
63.35	and in his case, as you can see,
66.247	the right part of his brain has gone.
70.439	So the effect that this stroke
70.439	could have on Mario's body
75.93	could be the fact that he couldn't
75.93	be able to control
79.174	the left side of his body.
81.95	Just imagine, if you have
81.95	a computer and a printer
85.775	and you want to transmit,
85.775	to input to print out a document,
89.964	but the printer doesn't
89.964	have the right drives,
93.408	so the same is for Mario.
96.192	It's just like,
96.192	he would like to move his left side
99.212	of his body, but he's not able
99.212	to transmit the right input
103.155	to move his left arm and left leg.
108.035	So life had to change.
110.277	We needed to change our schedule.
112.316	We needed to change the impact
112.316	that this birth had
118.227	on our life.
120.938	Roberto D'Angelo: As you may imagine,
122.94	unfortunately, we were not ready.
125.236	Nobody taught us how to deal
125.236	with such kinds of disabilities,
129.291	and as many questions as possible started
131.378	to come to our minds.
133.31	And that has been really a tough time.
136.339	Questions, some basics, like, you know,
138.636	why did this happen to us?
140.816	And what went wrong?
142.811	Some more tough, like, really,
145.314	what will be the impact on Mario's life?
147.021	I mean, at the end,
147.021	will he be able to work?
149.141	Will he be able to be normal?
150.595	And, you know, as a parent,
150.595	especially for the first time,
153.82	why is he not going to be better than us?
157.262	And this, indeed, really is tough to say,
160.54	but a few months later, we realized that
163.328	we were really feeling like a failure.
166.588	I mean, the only real product of our life,
169.609	at the end, was a failure.
171.449	And you know, it was not a failure
171.449	for ourselves in itself,
177.375	but it was a failure
177.375	that will impact his full life.
182.113	Honestly, we went down.
183.887	I mean we went really
183.887	down, but at the end,
187.422	we started to look at him,
189.316	and we said, we have to react.
191.565	So immediately, as Francesca
191.565	said, we changed our life.
194.443	We started physiotherapy,
194.443	we started the rehabilitation,
197.9	and one of the paths
197.9	that we were following
199.972	in terms of rehabilitation
199.972	is the mirror neurons pilot.
202.977	Basically, we spent months
202.977	doing this with Mario.
206.768	You have an object, and we showed him
209.613	how to grab the object.
211.634	Now, the theory of mirror
211.634	neurons simply says
214.218	that in your brains, exactly
214.218	now, as you watch me doing this,
218.39	you are activating
218.39	exactly the same neurons
220.9	as if you do the actions.
224.137	It looks like this is the leading
224.137	edge in terms of rehabilitation.
228.133	But one day we found that Mario
231.985	was not looking at our hand.
235.36	He was looking at us.
237.934	We were his mirror.
240.129	And the problem, as you might feel,
242.177	is that we were down, we were depressed,
244.622	we were looking at him as a problem,
246.994	not as a son, not
246.994	from a positive perspective.
251.499	And that day really
251.499	changed our perspective.
254.739	We realized that we had to become
258.059	a better mirror for Mario.
260.626	We restarted from our strengths,
262.714	and at the same time
262.714	we restarted from his strengths.
266.417	We stopped looking at him as a problem,
269.115	and we started to look at him
269.115	as an opportunity to improve.
273.515	And really, this was the change,
276.073	and from our side, we said,
279.232	"""What are our strengths"
279.232	"that we really can bring to Mario?"""
282.379	And we started from our passions.
283.975	I mean, at the end, my wife and myself
285.809	are quite different,
287.033	but we have many things in common.
289.121	We love to travel, we love music,
291.343	we love to be in places like this,
293.184	and we started to bring Mario with us
295.269	just to show to him the best
295.269	things that we can show to him.
299.967	This short video is from last week.
305.168	I am not saying --
306.773	(Applause) —
308.618	I am not saying it's a miracle.
308.618	That's not the message,
311.262	because we are just
311.262	at the beginning of the path.
313.811	But we want to share
313.811	what was the key learning,
317.433	the key learning that Mario drove to us,
319.715	and it is to consider
319.715	what you have as a gift
322.059	and not only what you miss,
326.747	and to consider what you
326.747	miss just as an opportunity.
330.94	And this is the message
330.94	that we want to share with you.
333.584	This is why we are here.
337.32	Mario!
339.235	And this is why --
340.998	(Applause) —
345.6	And this is why
350.822	we decided to share the best
350.822	mirror in the world with him.
356.308	And we thank you so much, all of you.
359.242	FF: Thank you. RD: Thank you. Bye.
361.365	(Applause)
365.202	FF: Thank you. (Applause)
