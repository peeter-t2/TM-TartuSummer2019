12.992	This year, Germany is celebrating
14.47	the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution
17.556	in East Germany.
19.092	In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,
23.858	the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,
27.32	the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,
31.485	in the East was unified
33.154	with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West
35.844	to found today's Germany.
39.117	Among many other things, Germany inherited
42.511	the archives of the East German secret police,
47.104	known as the Stasi.
50.42	Only two years after its dissolution,
52.96	its documents were opened to the public,
56.602	and historians such as me started
59.677	to study these documents
61.105	to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state
65.797	functioned.
67.507	Perhaps you have watched the movie
70.303	"""The Lives of Others."""
72.341	This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,
77.092	and as we live in an age where words
79.942	"such as ""surveillance"" or ""wiretapping"""
83.229	are on the front pages of newspapers,
85.979	I would like to speak about how the Stasi
88.802	really worked.
91.201	At the beginning, let's have a short look
93.97	at the history of the Stasi,
95.928	because it's really important for understanding
98.219	its self-conception.
101.706	Its origins are located in Russia.
104.418	In 1917, the Russian Communists founded
106.736	the Emergency Commission for Combating
108.93	Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,
111.731	shortly Cheka.
113.95	It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.
116.96	The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists
120.203	to establish their regime by terrorizing the population
123.96	and executing their enemies.
126.435	It evolved later into the well-known KGB.
132.244	The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.
135.75	They called themselves Chekists,
138.822	and even the emblem was very similar,
141.68	as you can see here.
144.661	In fact, the secret police of Russia
148.227	was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.
151.518	When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,
155.109	it immediately expanded there,
157.497	and soon it started to train the German Communists
161.118	to build up their own secret police.
164.366	By the way, in this hall where we are now,
167.886	the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.
173.566	Five years later, the Stasi was established,
176.95	and step by step, the dirty job of oppression
179.569	was handed over to it.
182.111	For instance, the central jail
184.542	for political prisoners,
185.856	which was established by the Russians,
188.604	was taken over by the Stasi
190.864	and used until the end of Communism.
194.048	You see it here.
195.85	At the beginning, every important step
199.485	took place under the attendance of the Russians.
203.04	But the Germans are known to be very effective,
206.141	so the Stasi grew very quickly,
209.519	and already in 1953, it had more employees
213.207	than the Gestapo had,
214.905	the secret police of Nazi Germany.
217.695	The number doubled in each decade.
220.133	In 1989, more than 90,000 employees
223.558	worked for the Stasi.
225.223	This meant that one employee
227.597	was responsible for 180 inhabitants,
230.81	which was really unique in the world.
234.809	At the top of this tremendous apparatus,
237.405	there was one man, Erich Mielke.
241.189	He ruled the Ministry of State Security
243.45	for more than 30 years.
245.769	He was a scrupulous functionary —
248.4	in his past, he killed two policemen
251.122	not far away from here —
253.13	who in fact personalized the Stasi.
257.197	But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?
261.69	Foremost, it was its enormous power,
264.6	because it united different functions
268.09	in one organization.
270.365	First of all, the Stasi
272.476	was an intelligence service.
275.571	It used all the imaginable instruments
278.05	for getting information secretly,
280.333	such as informers, or tapping phones,
283.934	as you can see it on the picture here.
286.802	And it was not only active in East Germany,
289.806	but all over the world.
292.543	Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.
296.506	It could stop people on the street
298.65	and arrest them in its own prisons.
303.078	Thirdly, the Stasi worked
304.58	as a kind of public prosecutor.
307.435	It had the right to open preliminary investigations
310.565	and to interrogate people officially.
314.262	Last but not least,
316.353	the Stasi had its own armed forces.
320.218	More than 11,000 soldiers were serving
322.222	in its so-called Guards Regiment.
325.732	It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.
330.148	Due to this concentration of power,
332.875	the Stasi was called a state in the state.
337.94	But let's look in more and more detail
340.199	at the tools of the Stasi.
342.816	Please keep in mind that at that time
344.459	the web and smartphones were not yet invented.
348.284	Of course, the Stasi used all kinds
351.525	of technical instruments to survey people.
354.598	Telephones were wiretapped,
356.711	including the phone of the
356.711	German chancellor in the West,
360.85	and often also the apartments.
363.802	Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened
367.195	by these machines.
370.541	The Stasi also shadowed
370.541	tens of thousands of people
374.239	using specially trained agents and secret cameras
377.471	to document every step one took.
381.006	In this picture, you can see me
383.674	as a young man just in front of this building
387.154	where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.
390.908	The Stasi even collected the smell of people.
395.304	It stored samples of it in closed jars
398.563	which were found after the peaceful revolution.
403.022	For all these tasks, highly specialized departments
407.258	were responsible.
409.626	The one which was tapping phone calls
411.806	was completely separated
413.696	from the one which controlled the letters,
416.242	for good reasons,
417.54	because if one agent quit the Stasi,
422.217	his knowledge was very small.
424.131	Contrast that with Snowden, for example.
428.119	But the vertical specialization was also important
431.196	to prevent all kinds of empathy
433.501	with the object of observation.
436.496	The agent who shadowed me
438.8	didn't know who I was
440.657	or why I was surveyed.
442.522	In fact, I smuggled forbidden books
444.136	from West to East Germany.
447.028	But what was even more typical for the Stasi
450.22	was the use of human intelligence,
453.384	people who reported secretly to the Stasi.
457.577	For the Minister of State Security,
459.379	these so-called unofficial employees
462.291	were the most important tools.
465.186	From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people
470.509	collaborated constantly with the Stasi,
473.346	more than one percent of the population.
478.222	And in a way, the minister was right,
480.95	because technical instruments
482.891	can only register what people are doing,
486.463	but agents and spies can also report
489.771	what people are planning to do
491.474	and what they are thinking.
493.834	Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.
498.615	The system of how to get them
501.459	and how to educate them, as it was called,
504.491	was very sophisticated.
507.181	The Stasi had its own university,
510.088	not far away from here,
511.608	where the methods were explored
513.535	and taught to the officers.
516.204	This guideline gave a detailed description
519.955	of every step you have to take
522.578	if you want to convince human beings
524.94	to betray their fellow citizens.
528.92	Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured
532.264	to becoming one,
533.72	but that's mostly not true,
536.314	because a forced informant is a bad informant.
540.225	Only someone who wants to give
540.225	you the information you need
543.312	is an effective whistleblower.
545.973	The main reasons why people
545.973	cooperated with the Stasi
550.83	were political conviction and material benefits.
556.33	The officers also tried to create a personal bond
559.44	between themselves and the informant,
562.848	and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows
568	that it's not so difficult to win someone
571.392	in order to betray others.
574.835	Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany
578.586	collaborated with the Stasi,
580.421	as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.
584.166	In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution
586.956	and he nearly became the first freely
586.956	elected Prime Minister of the GDR
591.33	until it came out that he was an informant.
596.475	The net of spies was really broad.
600.404	In nearly every institution,
602.11	even in the churches or in West Germany,
605.355	there were many of them.
607.543	I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,
611.032	"""If you had sent an informant to me,"
614.461	"I would surely have recognized him."""
617.091	His answer was,
618.95	"""We didn't send anyone."
620.393	"We took those who were around you."""
623.415	And in fact, two of my best friends
626.07	reported about me to the Stasi.
630.401	Not only in my case, informers were very close.
632.99	For example, Vera Lengsfeld,
632.99	another leading dissident,
636.693	in her case it was her husband who spied on her.
640.906	A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.
644.259	"This reminds me of the novel ""1984"" by George Orwell,"
648.151	where the only apparently trustable person
651.23	was an informer.
654.043	But why did the Stasi collect all this information
657.74	in its archives?
659.661	The main purpose was to control the society.
663.72	In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister
666.303	gave the order to find out who is who,
669.025	which meant who thinks what.
672.119	He didn't want to wait until somebody
673.87	tried to act against the regime.
676.39	He wanted to know in advance
678.28	what people were thinking and planning.
681.175	The East Germans knew, of course,
683.997	that they were surrounded by informers,
687.167	in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust
691.14	and a state of widespread fear,
694.234	the most important tools to oppress people
697.75	in any dictatorship.
699.909	That's why not many East Germans tried
702.512	to fight against the Communist regime.
706.796	If yes, the Stasi often used a method
711.378	which was really diabolic.
714.05	It was called Zersetzung,
716.236	and it's described in another guideline.
719.907	The word is difficult to translate because it means
722.707	"originally ""biodegradation."""
726.605	But actually, it's a quite accurate description.
729.959	The goal was to destroy secretly
733.518	the self-confidence of people,
736.408	for example by damaging their reputation,
739.521	by organizing failures in their work,
742.99	and by destroying their personal relationships.
747.62	Considering this, East Germany
747.62	was a very modern dictatorship.
752.995	The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.
757.366	It preferred to paralyze them,
760.457	and it could do so because
762.96	it had access to so much personal information
766.31	and to so many institutions.
770.24	Detaining someone was used only
772.512	as a last resort.
775.042	For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,
778.347	one in every district.
780.864	Here, the Stasi also developed
783.538	quite modern methods of detention.
787.98	Normally, the interrogation officer
789.763	didn't torture the prisoner.
793.226	Instead, he used a sophisticated system
795.802	of psychological pressure
797.94	in which strict isolation was central.
802.034	Nearly no prisoner resisted
804.318	without giving a testimony.
807.547	If you have the occasion,
809.609	do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin
813.06	and attend a guided tour
813.06	with a former political prisoner
816.649	who will explain to you how this worked.
819.505	One more question needs to be answered:
822.664	If the Stasi were so well organized,
825.106	why did the Communist regime collapse?
829.439	First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany
833.57	was uncertain what to do against
835.831	the growing protest of people.
838.768	It was especially confused
841.119	because in the mother country of socialism,
843.89	the Soviet Union,
845.41	a more liberal policy took place.
848.793	In addition, the regime was dependent
851.21	on the loans from the West.
854.602	Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising
857.15	was given to the Stasi.
860.227	Secondly, in the Communist ideology,
863.86	there's no place for criticism.
866.513	Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief
868.82	that socialism is a perfect system,
871.614	and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.
875.865	The consequence was
878.226	that despite all the information,
880.722	the regime couldn't analyze its real problems,
884.886	and therefore it couldn't solve them.
887.571	In the end, the Stasi died
890.275	because of the structures
892.068	that it was charged with protecting.
895.788	The ending of the Stasi
897.858	was something tragic,
899.905	because these officers
901.964	were kept busy during the peaceful revolution
905.032	with only one thing:
907.007	to destroy the documents
909.66	they had produced during decades.
913.351	Fortunately,
915.269	they had been stopped by human rights activists.
918.806	That's why today we can use the files
921.732	to get a better understanding
923.356	of how a surveillance state functions.
926.136	Thank you.
928.133	(Applause)
936.518	Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.
942.578	So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions
945.302	because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.
948.09	"""Mein Nachbar NSA."" My neighbor, the NSA."
952.964	And you just told us about my neighbor,
955.595	the spies and the informant from East Germany.
958.583	So there is a direct link between these two stories
961.283	or there isn't?
963.161	What's your reaction as a
963.161	historian when you see this?
965.183	Hubertus Knabe: I think there are
966.908	several aspects to mention.
968.811	At first, I think there's a difference
971.877	of why you are collecting this data.
975.965	Are you doing that for protecting your people
978.283	against terrorist attacks,
979.83	or are you doing that for oppressing your people?
982.6	So that makes a fundamental difference.
984.542	But on the other hand,
986.891	also in a democracy, these
986.891	instruments can be abused,
991.21	and that is something where we really have
993.376	to be aware to stop that,
994.761	and that also the intelligence services
997.634	are respecting the rules we have.
1000.755	The third point, probably,
1002.255	we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,
1005.543	because you can be sure that Russia and China
1009.223	are doing the same,
1010.755	but nobody speaks about that
1012.321	because nobody could do that.
1014.612	(Applause)
1021.398	BG: When the story came out first,
1023.451	last July, last year,
1025.646	you filed a criminal complaint
1028.474	with a German tribunal. Why?
1031.454	HK: Yeah, I did so because of
1031.454	the second point I mentioned,
1034.667	that I think especially in a democracy,
1037.564	the rules are for everybody.
1041.022	They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed
1043.386	that any institution doesn't respect the rules.
1047.177	In the criminal code of Germany, it's written
1049.155	that it's not allowed to tap somebody
1051.01	without the permission of the judge.
1053.398	Fortunately, it's written in
1053.398	the criminal code of Germany,
1057.219	so if it's not respected, then I think
1061.15	an investigation is necessary,
1063.046	and it took a very long time that
1065.025	the public prosecutor of Germany started this,
1067.131	and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,
1070.702	and not in the case of all the
1070.702	other people living in Germany.
1073.658	BG: That doesn't surprise me because —
1076.131	(Applause) —
1078.254	because of the story you told.
1081.697	Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,
1084.18	and I expected the Germans to react
1085.957	much more strongly, immediately.
1089.177	And instead, the reaction really came only
1091.789	when Chancellor Merkel was revealed
1093.646	as being wiretapped. Why so?
1097.201	HK: I take it as a good sign,
1099.064	because people feel secure in this democracy.
1103.394	They aren't afraid that they will be arrested,
1105.608	and if you leave this hall after the conference,
1108.771	nobody has to be afraid that the secret police
1111.335	is standing out and is arresting you.
1113.773	So that's a good sign, I think.
1115.367	People are not really scared, as they could be.
1118.242	But of course, I think, the institutions
1122.596	are responsible to stop illegal actions
1125.163	in Germany or wherever they happen.
1128.281	BG: A personal question,
1128.281	and this is the last one.
1131.474	There has been a debate in Germany about
1133.74	granting asylum to Edward Snowden.
1135.281	Would you be in favor or against?
1138.046	HK: Oh, that's a difficult question,
1139.734	but if you ask me,
1141.42	and if I answer honestly,
1143.075	I would give him the asylum,
1144.841	because I think it was really brave what he did,
1146.89	and he destroyed his whole life
1149.502	and his family and everything.
1151.171	So I think, for these people,
1151.171	we should do something,
1154.38	and especially if you see the German history,
1158.534	where so many people had to escape
1161.031	and they asked for asylum in other countries
1163.347	and they didn't get it,
1164.73	so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.
1167.567	(Applause)
1169.378	BG: Hubertus, thank you very much.
