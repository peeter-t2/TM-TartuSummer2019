12.875	I'm a lifelong traveler.
14.783	Even as a little kid,
16.442	I was actually working out
16.442	that it would be cheaper
19.922	to go to boarding school in England
22.048	than just to the best school down the road
22.048	from my parents' house in California.
27.168	So, from the time I was nine years old
30.547	I was flying alone several times a year
33.775	over the North Pole, just to go to school.
37.241	And of course the more I flew
37.241	the more I came to love to fly,
40.884	so the very week after I graduated
40.884	from high school,
44.15	I got a job mopping tables
46.864	so that I could spend
46.864	every season of my 18th year
51.065	on a different continent.
54.066	And then, almost inevitably,
54.066	I became a travel writer
58.187	so my job and my joy could become one.
62.636	And I really began to feel
62.636	that if you were lucky enough
66.522	to walk around
66.522	the candlelit temples of Tibet
69.954	or to wander along the seafronts in Havana
72.758	with music passing all around you,
75.138	you could bring those sounds 
75.138	and the high cobalt skies
78.435	and the flash of the blue ocean
80.777	back to your friends at home,
82.79	and really bring some magic
84.581	and clarity to your own life.
87.402	Except, as you all know,
89.868	one of the first things you learn
89.868	when you travel
92.7	is that nowhere is magical
92.7	unless you can bring the right eyes to it.
98.078	You take an angry man to the Himalayas,
100.557	he just starts complaining about the food.
103.873	And I found that the best way
106.395	that I could develop more attentive
106.395	and more appreciative eyes
110.439	was, oddly,
112.037	by going nowhere, just by sitting still.
115.505	And of course sitting still
115.505	is how many of us get
118.354	what we most crave and need
118.354	in our accelerated lives, a break.
124.124	But it was also the only way
125.846	that I could find to sift through
125.846	the slideshow of my experience
131.347	and make sense of the future and the past.
134.631	And so, to my great surprise,
137.673	I found that going nowhere
139.579	was at least as exciting
139.579	as going to Tibet or to Cuba.
143.697	And by going nowhere,
143.697	I mean nothing more intimidating
147.752	than taking a few minutes out of every day
150.584	or a few days out of every season,
152.555	or even, as some people do,
154.524	a few years out of a life
157.343	in order to sit still long enough
160.044	to find out what moves you most,
163.435	to recall where your truest happiness lies
166.779	and to remember that sometimes
168.549	making a living and making a life
171.264	point in opposite directions.
174.457	And of course, this is what wise beings
174.457	through the centuries
177.654	from every tradition have been telling us.
179.897	It's an old idea.
181.823	More than 2,000 years ago, 
181.823	the Stoics were reminding us
185.117	it's not our experience
185.117	that makes our lives,
188.171	it's what we do with it.
190.379	Imagine a hurricane suddenly 
190.379	sweeps through your town
194.231	and reduces every last thing to rubble.
198.739	One man is traumatized for life.
202.401	But another, maybe even his brother,
202.401	almost feels liberated,
206.265	and decides this is a great chance
206.265	to start his life anew.
210.507	It's exactly the same event,
212.357	but radically different responses.
214.909	There is nothing either good or bad,
214.909	"as Shakespeare told us in ""Hamlet,"""
219.3	but thinking makes it so.
222.72	And this has certainly been
222.72	my experience as a traveler.
226.06	Twenty-four years ago I took 
226.06	the most mind-bending trip
229.233	across North Korea.
231.915	But the trip lasted a few days.
234.804	What I've done with it sitting still,
234.804	going back to it in my head,
238.384	trying to understand it,
238.384	finding a place for it in my thinking,
242.056	that's lasted 24 years already
244.32	and will probably last a lifetime.
247.683	The trip, in other words,
247.683	gave me some amazing sights,
251.059	but it's only sitting still
253.124	that allows me to turn those
253.124	into lasting insights.
256.816	And I sometimes think
256.816	that so much of our life
259.762	takes place inside our heads,
261.779	in memory or imagination
261.779	or interpretation or speculation,
266.592	that if I really want to change my life
269.395	I might best begin by changing my mind.
273.43	Again, none of this is new;
274.95	that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics
274.95	were telling us this centuries ago,
279.25	but Shakespeare never had to face
283.503	(Laughter)
284.905	The Stoics, as far as I know,
284.905	were not on Facebook.
289.228	We all know that in our on-demand lives,
292.084	one of the things that's most on demand
294.192	is ourselves.
295.42	Wherever we are, any time of night or day,
298.052	our bosses, junk-mailers,
298.052	our parents can get to us.
302.443	Sociologists have actually found
302.443	that in recent years
305.772	Americans are working fewer hours
305.772	than 50 years ago,
309.23	but we feel as if we're working more.
312.396	We have more and more time-saving devices,
314.942	but sometimes, it seems,
314.942	less and less time.
318.742	We can more and more easily 
318.742	make contact with people
321.226	on the furthest corners of the planet,
323.585	but sometimes in that process
325.579	we lose contact with ourselves.
329.325	And one of my biggest surprises 
329.325	as a traveler
333.118	has been to find
333.118	that often it's exactly the people
336.296	who have most enabled us to get anywhere
339.413	who are intent on going nowhere.
342.128	In other words, precisely those beings
344.313	who have created the technologies
346.646	that override so many
346.646	of the limits of old,
350.196	are the ones wisest
350.196	about the need for limits,
353.207	even when it comes to technology.
356.883	I once went to the Google headquarters
359.512	and I saw all the things
359.512	many of you have heard about;
362.315	the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,
365.539	workers at that time enjoying 20 percent
365.539	of their paid time free
370.017	so that they could just let
370.017	their imaginations go wandering.
374.057	But what impressed me even more
376.975	was that as I was waiting
376.975	for my digital I.D.,
380.554	one Googler was telling me
380.554	about the program
383.323	that he was about to start
383.323	to teach the many, many Googlers
387.117	who practice yoga
387.117	to become trainers in it,
390.51	and the other Googler was telling me
390.51	about the book that he was about to write
394.764	on the inner search engine,
397.778	and the ways in which science
397.778	has empirically shown
400.771	that sitting still, or meditation,
403.308	can lead not just to better 
403.308	health or to clearer thinking,
406.92	but even to emotional intelligence.
410.44	I have another friend in Silicon Valley
412.753	who is really one 
412.753	of the most eloquent spokesmen
415.875	for the latest technologies,
417.678	and in fact was one of the founders
417.678	of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.
421.563	And Kevin wrote his last book
421.563	on fresh technologies
425.316	without a smartphone
425.316	or a laptop or a TV in his home.
429.879	And like many in Silicon Valley,
432.761	he tries really hard to observe
435.737	what they call an Internet sabbath,
439.643	whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week
442.741	they go completely offline
445.821	in order to gather the sense of direction
447.969	and proportion they'll need 
447.969	when they go online again.
451.463	The one thing perhaps
451.463	that technology hasn't always given us
455.19	is a sense of how to make
455.19	the wisest use of technology.
459.899	And when you speak of the sabbath,
462.564	look at the Ten Commandments --
464.501	there's only one word there
464.501	"for which the adjective ""holy"" is used,"
468.874	and that's the Sabbath.
471.15	I pick up the Jewish holy book
471.15	of the Torah --
474.18	its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.
477.521	And we all know that it's really
477.521	one of our greatest luxuries,
481.418	the empty space.
483.606	In many a piece of music, 
483.606	it's the pause or the rest
487.528	that gives the piece
487.528	its beauty and its shape.
490.638	And I know I as a writer
492.221	will often try to include
492.221	a lot of empty space on the page
496.354	so that the reader can complete
496.354	my thoughts and sentences
500.066	and so that her imagination
500.066	has room to breathe.
505.618	Now, in the physical domain, 
505.618	of course, many people,
508.196	if they have the resources,
509.72	will try to get a place in the country,
509.72	a second home.
513.2	I've never begun to have those resources,
516.342	but I sometimes remember
516.342	that any time I want,
520.057	I can get a second home in time,
520.057	if not in space,
524.422	just by taking a day off.
526.853	And it's never easy because, of course, 
526.853	whenever I do I spend much of it
530.418	worried about all the extra stuff
532.096	that's going to crash down on me
532.096	the following day.
534.77	I sometimes think I'd rather give up
534.77	meat or sex or wine
537.792	than the chance to check on my emails.
539.834	(Laughter)
540.958	And every season I do try to take
540.958	three days off on retreat
545.266	but a part of me still feels guilty
545.266	to be leaving my poor wife behind
549.568	and to be ignoring
549.568	all those seemingly urgent emails
552.616	from my bosses
554.37	and maybe to be missing
554.37	a friend's birthday party.
557.437	But as soon as I get
557.437	to a place of real quiet,
561.265	I realize that it's only by going there
563.734	that I'll have anything fresh
563.734	or creative or joyful to share
567.761	with my wife or bosses or friends.
570.267	Otherwise, really,
571.547	I'm just foisting on them
571.547	my exhaustion or my distractedness,
575.067	which is no blessing at all.
578.849	And so when I was 29,
581.317	I decided to remake my entire life
584.382	in the light of going nowhere.
587.099	One evening I was coming back
587.099	from the office,
589.6	it was after midnight, I was in a taxi
589.6	driving through Times Square,
593.779	and I suddenly realized
593.779	that I was racing around so much
597.279	I could never catch up with my life.
600.435	And my life then, as it happened,
602.251	was pretty much the one
602.251	I might have dreamed of as a little boy.
606.072	I had really interesting friends
606.072	and colleagues,
608.387	I had a nice apartment
608.387	on Park Avenue and 20th Street.
612.635	I had, to me, a fascinating job 
612.635	writing about world affairs,
617.068	but I could never separate myself
617.068	enough from them
620.056	to hear myself think --
621.759	or really, to understand
621.759	if I was truly happy.
625.885	And so, I abandoned my dream life
629.072	for a single room on the backstreets
629.072	of Kyoto, Japan,
634.382	which was the place
634.382	that had long exerted a strong,
637.668	really mysterious gravitational pull on me.
641.518	Even as a child
642.853	I would just look at a painting
642.853	of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;
646.224	I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.
649.471	But it's also, as you all know,
651.4	a beautiful city encircled by hills,
654.119	filled with more than 2,000 temples
654.119	and shrines,
657.748	where people have been sitting still
657.748	for 800 years or more.
662.86	And quite soon after I moved there,
662.86	I ended up where I still am
666.853	with my wife, formerly our kids,
669.432	in a two-room apartment
669.432	in the middle of nowhere
672.013	where we have no bicycle, no car,
674.401	no TV I can understand,
676.57	and I still have to support my loved ones
679.123	as a travel writer and a journalist,
681.654	so clearly this is not ideal
681.654	for job advancement
685.018	or for cultural excitement
686.845	or for social diversion.
689.212	But I realized that it gives me
689.212	what I prize most,
694.4	which is days
696.04	and hours.
697.773	I have never once had to use
697.773	a cell phone there.
700.4	I almost never have to look at the time,
703.943	and every morning when I wake up,
706.497	really the day stretches in front of me
708.858	like an open meadow.
711.832	And when life throws up
711.832	one of its nasty surprises,
715.028	as it will, more than once,
716.989	when a doctor comes into my room
719.17	wearing a grave expression,
721.065	or a car suddenly veers
721.065	in front of mine on the freeway,
724.693	I know, in my bones,
727.437	that it's the time I've spent
727.437	going nowhere
730.147	that is going to sustain me much more
732.149	than all the time I've spent
732.149	racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
738.306	I'll always be a traveler --
739.71	my livelihood depends on it --
741.614	but one of the beauties of travel
743.793	is that it allows you to bring stillness
747.899	into the motion and the commotion
747.899	of the world.
752.019	I once got on a plane
752.019	in Frankfurt, Germany,
755.397	and a young German woman 
755.397	came down and sat next to me
758.345	and engaged me
758.345	in a very friendly conversation
760.965	for about 30 minutes,
762.716	and then she just turned around
764.709	and sat still for 12 hours.
767.982	She didn't once turn on her video monitor,
770.616	she never pulled out a book,
770.616	she didn't even go to sleep,
773.911	she just sat still,
776.698	and something of her clarity and calm
776.698	really imparted itself to me.
781.999	I've noticed more and more people
781.999	taking conscious measures these days
786.321	to try to open up a space
786.321	inside their lives.
789.605	Some people go to black-hole resorts
791.935	where they'll spend hundreds
791.935	of dollars a night
794.295	in order to hand over
794.295	their cell phone and their laptop
797.453	to the front desk on arrival.
799.657	Some people I know,
799.657	just before they go to sleep,
802.622	instead of scrolling through
802.622	their messages
804.746	or checking out YouTube,
806.418	just turn out the lights
806.418	and listen to some music,
809.662	and notice that they sleep much better
812.088	and wake up much refreshed.
815.301	I was once fortunate enough
817.507	to drive into the high, dark mountains
817.507	behind Los Angeles,
822.547	where the great poet and singer
825.095	and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen
828.317	was living and working for many years
828.317	as a full-time monk
832.488	in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.
835.339	And I wasn't entirely surprised
837.304	when the record that he released
837.304	at the age of 77,
841.014	to which he gave the deliberately 
841.014	"unsexy title of ""Old Ideas,"""
846.296	went to number one in the charts 
846.296	in 17 nations in the world,
849.258	hit the top five in nine others.
852.488	Something in us, I think, is crying out
855.255	for the sense of intimacy and depth
855.255	that we get from people like that.
859.761	who take the time
859.761	and trouble to sit still.
863.543	And I think many
863.543	of us have the sensation,
865.781	I certainly do,
867.309	that we're standing about two inches away
867.309	from a huge screen,
871.767	and it's noisy and it's crowded
873.605	and it's changing with every second,
875.781	and that screen is our lives.
878.53	And it's only by stepping back,
878.53	and then further back,
882.153	and holding still,
883.891	that we can begin to see
883.891	what the canvas means
886.709	and to catch the larger picture.
889.005	And a few people do that for us
889.005	by going nowhere.
893.95	So, in an age of acceleration,
895.972	nothing can be more exhilarating
895.972	than going slow.
900.021	And in an age of distraction,
902.202	nothing is so luxurious
902.202	as paying attention.
906.715	And in an age of constant movement,
909.441	nothing is so urgent as sitting still.
913.214	So you can go on your next vacation
915.443	to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;
918.509	I bet you'll have a wonderful time.
922.049	But, if you want to come back home
922.049	alive and full of fresh hope,
927.117	in love with the world,
929.277	I think you might want
929.277	to try considering going nowhere.
933.713	Thank you.
934.86	(Applause)
