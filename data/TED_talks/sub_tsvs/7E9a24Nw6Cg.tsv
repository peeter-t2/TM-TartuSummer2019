9.068	Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful
9.068	to be on board one of these things.
12.869	(Engine roars)
15.123	It's an entirely different perspective.
17.019	You're not looking up at the universe.
18.943	You and the Earth are going
18.943	through the Universe together.
21.986	Fabien Cousteau: I think the oceans
21.986	still hold quite a few secrets,
26.301	but if we're to explore
26.301	the final frontier on this planet,
29.618	we need to live there.
31.504	[Journeyed around the world.]
32.945	Vincent Moon: I felt the need to travel
32.945	and to discover some other music,
36.403	to explore the world,
37.79	and actually it was also this idea
37.79	of nomadic cinema that I had in mind.
42.647	Daria van den Bercken: Recently, I flew
42.647	over a crowd of thousands of people
46.389	in Brazil, playing music
46.389	by George Frideric Handel.
50.742	I also drove along
50.742	the streets of Amsterdam.
53.691	I fell in love with the music,
55.771	and I wanted to share it
55.771	with as many people as possible.
60.306	Ben Saunders: It was a journey,
60.306	an expedition in Antarctica,
63.717	the coldest, windiest, driest,
66.125	and highest-altitude continent on Earth.
68.188	[And even traveled back in time.]
69.815	Allan Adams: Keep looking
69.815	further and further,
72.487	and then finally you see
72.487	a faint, fading afterglow,
76.69	and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.
79.245	[We took bold steps forward.]
80.807	Hugh Herr: We the people need not
80.807	accept our limitations,
84.004	but can transcend disability
84.004	through technological innovation.
87.673	[Helped medicine get personal.]
89.386	Leana Wen: When doctors
89.386	are willing to step off our pedestals,
92.42	take off our white coats
92.42	and show our patients who we are
95.145	and what medicine is all about,
96.693	that's when we begin to overcome
96.693	the sickness of fear.
99.697	That's when we establish trust.
101.652	Manu Prakash: It starts
101.652	with a single sheet of paper.
104.813	What you see here
104.813	is all the possible components
108.016	to build a functional, bright-field
108.016	and fluorescence microscope.
111.858	Jorge Soto: Catching cancer early
111.858	is basically the closest thing we have
115.286	to a silver-bullet cure against it,
117.307	and that is why my team and I
117.307	have decided to begin this journey,
120.471	to try to make cancer detection
120.471	at the early stages
123.134	easier, cheaper, smarter,
123.134	and more accessible.
127.074	[We re-examined power.]
128.997	Eric Liu: The problem we face today,
128.997	here in America in particular,
132.209	but all around the world,
133.516	is that far too many people
133.516	are profoundly illiterate in power.
137.849	Pia Mancini: If Internet
137.849	is the new printing press,
141.146	then what is democracy
141.146	for the Internet era?
145.176	Jeremy Heimans: Let's for a second
145.176	talk about what new power isn't.
148.449	New power is not your Facebook page.
151.269	Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.
154.563	I assure you that his Facebook page
157.023	has not embraced
157.023	the power of participation.
159.665	[Re-defined success.]
160.996	Simon Anholt: We don't admire countries
160.996	primarily because they're rich,
164.37	because they're powerful, successful,
166.198	modern, or technologically advanced.
168.133	We primarily admire countries
168.133	that are good.
171.12	Michael Green: GDP is a tool
171.12	to help us measure economic performance.
175.572	It's not a measure of our well-being.
178.58	[Reckoned with rising inequality.]
180.247	Nick Hanauer: No free
180.247	and open society can long sustain
183.584	this kind of rising economic inequality.
186.525	It has never happened.
186.525	There are no examples.
189.643	You show me a highly unequal society,
191.671	and I will show you
191.671	a police state or an uprising.
194.051	Thomas Piketty: When inequality
194.051	gets too extreme,
196.361	then it becomes useless for growth.
199.563	Charmian Gooch: My wish is for us to know
199.563	who owns and controls companies
205.008	so that they can no longer be used
205.008	anonymously against the public good.
209.547	[Wrestled with the power of big data.]
211.475	Kenneth Cukier: We have to be the master
211.475	of this technology, not its servant.
215.233	We are just at the outset
215.233	of the big data era.
217.451	Jennifer Golbeck:
217.451	By liking that Facebook page,
219.759	or by sharing this piece
219.759	of personal information,
222.139	you've now improved my ability to predict
222.139	whether you're using drugs
225.481	or whether you get along well
225.481	in the workplace.
227.799	Anne Milgram: I wanted
227.799	to introduce data and analytics
230.432	and rigorous statistical
230.432	analysis into our work.
233.261	In short, I wanted
233.261	to moneyball criminal justice.
236.229	[And debated the right to privacy.]
238.026	Glenn Greenwald: The United States
238.026	and its partners,
240.564	unbeknownst to the entire world,
240.564	has converted the Internet
243.918	into an unprecedented zone
243.918	of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.
249.213	Richard Ledgett: This is not NSA
249.213	running off and doing its own things.
252.543	This is a legitimate activity
252.543	of the United States foreign government
256.823	that was agreed to by all the branches.
258.904	Edward Snowden: We don't have to give up
258.904	our privacy to have good government.
264.155	Keren Elazari: I think we need hackers,
266.087	and in fact, they just might be
266.087	the immune system for the information age.
272.801	[We empathized with those who suffer.]
274.7	Melissa Fleming: Every day, 32,000 people
276.836	will be forcibly displaced
276.836	from their homes.
280.204	Kimberley Motley:
280.204	And what justness means to me,
282.623	it's using laws for their
282.623	intended purpose, to protect.
287.282	Eman Mohammed: My work is not
287.282	meant to hide the scars of war
290.146	but to show the full frame
290.146	of unseen stories of Gazans.
293.927	Sebastian Junger: I've been
293.927	covering wars for almost 20 years,
296.958	and one of the remarkable things
298.528	is how many soldiers
298.528	find themselves missing it.
300.818	Kevin Briggs: In my experience,
300.818	it's not just the talking that you do,
305.035	but the listening.
306.347	Listen to understand.
309.078	[Recognized creativity
309.078	as a constant pursuit.]
311.3	Sting: Day after day, you face
311.3	a blank page and nothing's coming,
314.461	and those days turn to weeks
314.461	and weeks to months,
316.812	and pretty soon, those months have turned
316.812	into years with very little to show.
320.573	Mark Ronson: You have to take
320.573	an element of those things
323.308	and bring something fresh and new to it.
325.273	Sarah Lewis: Mastery is about
325.273	sacrificing for your craft
327.994	and not for the sake
327.994	of crafting your career.
330.747	Elizabeth Gilbert: The only trick
330.747	is that you've got to identify
333.813	the best, worthiest thing
333.813	that you love most,
336.017	and then build your house
336.017	right on top of it
338.151	and don't budge from it.
339.597	[We watched language evolve.]
341.049	Jamila Lyiscott:
341.049	Let there be no confusion
343.062	Let there be no hesitation
344.597	This is not a promotion of ignorance
346.42	This is a linguistic celebration
349.08	Jill Shargaa: Webster's dictionary
349.08	"defines the word ""awesome"""
353.018	as fear mingled with
353.018	admiration or reverence.
356.873	With that in mind,
356.873	was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?
361.177	Anne Curzan: Multi-slacking
361.177	is the act of having
363.521	multiple windows up on your screen
365.469	so it looks like you're working when
365.469	you're actually goofing around on the web.
369.313	(Laughter)
370.457	[We saw the future.]
374.199	Nicholas Negroponte: So my prediction is
374.199	that we are going to ingest information.
379.598	You're going to swallow
379.598	a pill and know English.
381.949	You're going to swallow
381.949	a pill and know Shakespeare.
385.029	[And most importantly
386.386	we saw the best versions of ourselves.]
388.547	Dan Gilbert: Human beings
388.547	are works in progress
391.162	that mistakenly think they're finished.
394.102	"Isabel Allende: ""Tell me,"
394.102	what is it that you plan to do
397.392	"with your one wild and precious life?"""
401.34	Me, I intend to live passionately.
403.915	Ziauddin Yousafzai: People ask me,
403.915	what special is in my mentorship
407.653	which has made Malala so bold
407.653	and so courageous and poised.
412.344	I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
416.441	Ask me what I did not do.
420.208	I did not clip her wings.
423.212	Zak Ebrahim: Violence isn't inherent
423.212	in one's religion or race.
426.377	I choose to use my experience
426.377	to fight back against terrorism,
431.053	against the bigotry.
432.69	Mellody Hobson: I think it's time
432.69	for us to be comfortable
435.471	with the uncomfortable
435.471	conversation about race.
438.174	We cannot afford to be color blind.
440.369	We have to be color brave.
443.655	Geena Rocero: My deepest truth
445.57	allowed me to accept who I am. Will you?
451.199	Shaka Senghor: So what I'm asking today
453.114	is that you envision a world
455.276	where men and women
455.276	aren't held hostage to their past,
459.482	where misdeeds and mistakes don't
459.482	define you for the rest of your life.
463.054	Maysoon Zayid: I gotta tell you,
463.054	I got 99 problems and palsy is just one.
468.806	If there was an Oppression Olympics,
468.806	I would win the gold medal.
473.495	I'm Palestinian, Muslim,
476.631	I'm female, I'm disabled,
476.631	and I live in New Jersey.
480.916	(Laughter) (Applause)
485.083	Gabby Giffords: Be a leader.
485.083	Set an example.
488.479	Be passionate.
490.191	Be courageous. Be your best.
493.203	Andrew Solomon:
493.203	Forge meaning, build identity,
497.981	and then invite the world
497.981	to share your joy.
