13.166	I've been living in rural East Africa
13.166	for about 10 years,
16.26	and I want to share a field perspective
16.26	with you on global poverty.
19.934	I believe that the greatest failure
19.934	of the human race
22.532	is the fact that we've left more than
22.532	one billion of our members behind.
26.335	Hungry, extreme poverty:
28.701	these often seem like gigantic,
28.701	insurmountable problems,
32.013	too big to solve.
34.006	But as a field practitioner,
35.739	I believe these are actually
35.739	very solvable problems
38.567	if we just take the right strategies.
42.39	Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,
44.529	and he taught us that if we lean
44.529	on the right levers,
47.037	we can move the world.
48.959	In the fight against extreme poverty,
48.959	I believe there are three powerful levers
52.699	that we can lean on.
54.096	This talk is all about those levers,
54.096	and why they make poverty
57.122	a winnable fight in our lifetimes.
59.994	What is extreme poverty?
62.287	When I first moved to rural East Africa,
64.256	I stayed overnight with a farm family.
66.629	They were wonderful people.
68.753	They invited me into their home.
68.753	We sang songs together
71.649	and ate a simple dinner.
72.824	They gave me a blanket
72.824	to sleep on the floor.
75.359	In the morning, however,
75.359	there was nothing to eat.
78.265	And then at lunchtime, I watched
78.265	with an increasingly sick feeling
82.041	as the eldest girl in the family
82.041	cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.
86.703	For that meal, every child
86.703	drank one cup to survive.
91.575	And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt
93.589	when they handed one of those cups to me,
95.576	and I knew I had to accept
95.576	their hospitality.
98.781	Children need food not only to survive
98.781	but also to grow physically and mentally.
103.265	Every day they fail to eat,
103.265	they lose a little bit of their future.
107.114	Amongst the extreme poor,
107.114	one in three children
110.02	are permanently stunted
110.02	from a lifetime of not eating enough.
114.326	When that's combined
114.326	with poor access to health care,
116.862	one in 10 extremely poor children
116.862	die before they reach age five.
121.819	And only one quarter of children
121.819	complete high school
124.38	because they lack school fees.
125.908	Hunger and extreme poverty curb
125.908	human potential in every possible way.
132.771	We see ourselves as a thinking,
132.771	feeling and moral human race,
137.085	but until we solve these problems
137.085	for all of our members,
140.144	we fail that standard,
142.332	because every person
142.332	on this planet matters.
144.698	This child matters.
147.125	These children matter.
149.638	This girl matters.
152.209	You know, we see things like this,
153.922	and we're upset by them,
155.523	but they seem like such big problems.
157.349	We don't know how
157.349	to take effective action.
160.893	But remember our friend Archimedes.
163.572	Global poverty has powerful levers.
165.924	It's a problem like any other.
168.023	I live and work in the field,
168.023	and as a practitioner,
170.493	I believe these are very
170.493	solvable problems.
173.32	So for the next 10 minutes,
174.825	let's not be sad
174.825	about the state of the world.
177.003	Let's engage our brains.
178.858	Let's engage our collective passion
178.858	for problem-solving
181.627	and figure out what those levers are.
184.416	Lever number one: most
184.416	of the world's poor are farmers.
188.157	Think about how extraordinary this is.
190.244	If this picture represents
190.244	the world's poor,
192.729	then more than half engage in farming
192.729	as a major source of income.
196.368	This gets me really excited.
198.319	All of these people, one profession.
201.247	Think how powerful this is.
202.727	When farmers become more productive,
202.727	then more than half the world's poor
206.269	earn more money and climb out of poverty.
208.697	And it gets better.
209.941	The product of farming
209.941	is, of course, food.
212.22	So when farmers become more productive,
212.22	they earn more food,
215.849	and they don't just help themselves,
217.594	but they help to feed healthy communities
217.594	and thriving economies.
221.228	And when farmers become more productive,
221.228	they reduce environmental pressure.
225.443	We only have two ways
225.443	we can feed the world:
227.749	we can either make our existing farmland
227.749	a lot more productive,
231.096	or we can clear cut forest and savannah
231.096	to make more farmland,
234.4	which would be environmentally disastrous.
237.688	Farmers are basically
237.688	a really important leverage point.
241.496	When farmers become more productive,
243.453	they earn more income,
243.453	they climb out of poverty,
246.088	they feed their communities and they
246.088	reduce environmental land pressure.
250.187	Farmers stand at the center of the world.
254.306	And not a farmer like this one,
256.03	but rather this lady.
258.055	Most of the farmers I know
258.055	are actually women.
260.699	Look at the strength and the will
260.699	radiating from this woman.
263.995	She is physically strong, mentally tough,
266.231	and she will do whatever it takes
266.231	to earn a better life for her children.
269.686	If we're going to put the future
269.686	of humanity in one person's hands,
272.854	then I'm really glad it's her.
274.691	(Applause)
280.125	There's just one problem:
281.405	many smallholder farmers
281.405	lack access to basic tools and knowledge.
286.748	Currently, they take a little bit
286.748	of saved food grain from the prior year,
290.46	they plant it in the ground
290.46	and they till it with a manual hand hoe.
293.864	These are tools and techniques
293.864	that date to the Bronze Age,
296.653	and it's why many farmers
296.653	are still very poor.
300.755	But good news, again.
302.161	Lever number two:
303.336	humanity actually solved the problem
303.336	of agricultural poverty a century ago.
308.449	Let me walk you through the three
308.449	most basic factors in farming.
311.944	First, hybrid seed is created
311.944	when you cross two seeds together.
316.365	If you naturally pollinate
316.365	a high-yielding variety
319.193	together with a drought-resistant variety,
321.528	you get a hybrid that inherits
321.528	positive traits from both of its parents.
325.39	Next, conventional fertilizer,
325.39	if used responsibly,
329.111	is environmentally sustainable.
331.433	If you micro-dose
331.433	just a pinch of fertilizer
334.451	to a plant that's taller than I am,
336.559	you unlock enormous yield gain.
339.118	These are known as farm inputs.
341.241	Farm inputs need to be combined
341.241	with good practice.
343.865	When you space your seeds
343.865	and plant with massive amounts of compost,
347.983	farmers multiply their harvests.
350.946	These proven tools and practices
350.946	have more than tripled
353.546	agricultural productivity
353.546	in every major region of the world,
356.618	moving mass numbers of people
356.618	out of poverty.
359.928	We just haven't finished delivering
359.928	these things to everybody just yet,
363.291	particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.
365.925	So overall, this is amazing news.
367.671	Humanity actually solved
367.671	agricultural poverty a century ago,
371.677	in theory.
372.908	We just haven't delivered these things
372.908	to everybody just yet.
376.354	In this century, the reason
376.354	that people remain poor
378.765	is because maybe they live
378.765	in remote places.
380.995	They lack access to these things.
384.154	Therefore, ending poverty
384.154	is simply a matter
386.739	of delivering proven goods
386.739	and services to people.
390.185	We don't need more genius types right now.
392.507	The humble delivery guy is going
392.507	to end global poverty in our lifetime.
398.088	So these are the three levers,
399.6	and the most powerful lever
399.6	is simply delivery.
403.033	Wherever the world's companies,
403.033	governments and nonprofits
406.344	set up delivery networks
406.344	for life-improving goods,
409.4	we eliminate poverty.
412.023	OK, so that sounds really nice in theory,
414.04	but what about in practice?
415.354	What do these delivery networks look like?
418.006	I want to share the concrete example
418.006	that I know best,
420.565	my organization, One Acre Fund.
423.165	We only serve the farmer,
424.584	and our job is to provide her
424.584	with the tools that she needs to succeed.
428.284	We start off by delivering farm inputs
428.284	to really rural places.
431.262	Now, this may appear
431.262	initially very challenging,
433.552	but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.
435.787	We buy farm inputs with the combined power
435.787	of our farmer network,
438.871	and store it in 20 warehouses like this.
441.638	Then, during input delivery,
441.638	we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks
445.638	and send them out to where farmers
445.638	are waiting in the field.
448.953	They then get their individual orders
448.953	and walk it home to their farms.
452.415	It's kind of like Amazon
452.415	for rural farmers.
455.694	Importantly, realistic delivery
455.694	also includes finance, a way to pay.
460.536	Farmers pay us little by little over time,
460.536	covering most of our expenses.
465.587	And then we surround
465.587	all that with training.
468.151	Our rural field officers
468.151	deliver practical, hands-on training
471.826	to farmers in the field
473.255	every two weeks.
475.496	Wherever we deliver our services,
475.496	farmers use these tools
479.104	to climb out of poverty.
481.193	This is a farmer
481.193	in our program, Consolata.
484.033	Look at the pride on her face.
486.212	She has achieved a modest prosperity
486.212	that I believe is the human right
489.894	of every hardworking person on the planet.
493.264	Today, I'm proud to say that we're serving
493.264	about 400,000 farmers like Consolata.
498.19	(Applause)
503.881	The key to doing this
503.881	is scalable delivery.
506.482	In any given area, we hire
506.482	a rural field officer
509.395	who delivers our services
509.395	to 200 farmers, on average,
512.575	with more than 1,000 people
512.575	living in those families.
515.805	Today, we have 2,000
515.805	of these rural field officers
519.26	growing very quickly.
520.665	This is our delivery army,
522.991	and we're just one organization.
524.682	There are many companies,
524.682	governments and nonprofits
527.87	that have delivery armies just like this.
530.105	And I believe we stand at a moment in time
532.175	where collectively, we are capable of
532.175	delivering farm services to all farmers.
537.755	Let me show you how possible this is.
539.96	This is a map of Sub-Saharan Africa,
541.853	with a map of the United States for scale.
543.982	I chose Sub-Saharan Africa because
543.982	this is a huge delivery territory.
547.394	It's very challenging.
549.248	But we analyzed every 50-mile
549.248	by 50-mile block on the continent,
553.292	and we found that half of farmers
553.292	live in just these shaded regions.
559.265	That's a remarkably small area overall.
562.195	If you were to lay these boxes
562.195	next to each other
564.528	within a map of the United States,
566.188	they would only cover
566.188	the Eastern United States.
569.284	You can order pizza
569.284	anywhere in this territory
572.832	and it'll arrive to your house
572.832	hot, fresh and delicious.
576.581	If America can deliver pizza
576.581	to an area of this size,
579.872	then Africa's companies,
579.872	governments and non-profits
582.919	can deliver farm services
582.919	to all of her farmers.
585.966	This is possible.
588.995	I'm going to wrap up by generalizing
588.995	beyond just farming.
592.292	In every field of human development,
594.423	humanity has already invented
594.423	effective tools to end poverty.
598.276	We just need to deliver them.
600.322	So again, in every area
600.322	of human development,
602.587	super-smart people a long time ago
602.587	invented inexpensive,
606.013	highly effective tools.
607.869	Humanity is armed to the teeth
609.825	with simple, effective
609.825	solutions to poverty.
613.596	We just need to deliver these
613.596	to a pretty small area.
617.266	Again using the map
617.266	of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,
620.392	remember that rural poverty is
620.392	concentrated in these blue shaded areas.
624.44	Urban poverty is even more concentrated,
624.44	in these green little dots.
629.282	Again, using a map
629.282	of the United States for scale,
632.317	this is what I would call
632.317	a highly achievable delivery zone.
636.346	In fact, for the first time
636.346	in human history,
638.532	we have a vast amount of delivery
638.532	infrastructure available to us.
642.055	The world's companies,
642.055	governments and non-profits
644.803	have delivery armies
644.803	that are fully capable
647.05	of covering this relatively small area.
649.927	We just lack the will.
652.913	If we are willing,
654.348	every one of us has a role to play.
657.92	We first need more people to pursue
657.92	careers in human development,
661.315	especially if you live
661.315	in a developing nation.
663.487	We need more front line health workers,
663.487	teachers, farmer trainers,
666.997	sales agents for life-improving goods.
669.439	These are the delivery people
669.439	that dedicate their careers
672.133	to improving the lives of others.
674.532	But we also need a lot of support roles.
677.731	These are roles available
677.731	at just my organization alone,
680.606	and we're just one out of many.
682.399	This may surprise you, but no matter
682.399	what your technical specialty,
686.197	there is a role for you in this fight.
689.158	And no matter how logistically possible
689.158	it is to end poverty,
692.529	we need a lot more resources.
694.448	This is our number one constraint.
696.811	For private investors, we need
696.811	a big expansion of venture capital,
700.211	private equity, working capital,
700.211	available in emerging markets.
704.477	But there are also limits
704.477	to what private business can accomplish.
707.928	Private businesses often struggle
707.928	to profitably serve the extreme poor,
711.897	so philanthropy still has
711.897	a major role to play.
714.998	Anybody can give,
714.998	but we need more leadership.
718.112	We need more visionary philanthropists
720.083	and global leaders who will take
720.083	problems in human development
724.019	and lead humanity to wipe them
724.019	off the face of the planet.
728.276	If you're interested in these ideas,
728.276	check out this website.
731.122	We need more leaders.
734.174	Humanity has put people on the moon.
736.22	We've invented supercomputers
736.22	that fit into our pockets
738.821	and connect us with anybody on the planet.
740.901	We've run marathons
740.901	at a five-minute mile pace.
744.207	We are an exceptional people.
747.822	But we've left more than one billion
747.822	of our members behind.
751.485	Until every girl like this one
751.485	has an opportunity
753.807	to earn her full human potential,
756.047	we have failed to become
756.047	a truly moral and just human race.
760.516	Logistically speaking,
760.516	it's incredibly possible
763.296	to end extreme poverty.
765.22	We just need to deliver
765.22	proven goods and services
768.126	to everybody.
769.665	If we have the will, every one of us
769.665	has a role to play.
774.024	Let's deploy our time, our careers,
776.937	our collective wealth.
778.781	Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty
781.541	in this lifetime.
783.971	Thank you.
785.146	(Applause)
