15.641	Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.
19.354	And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)
23.607	We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,
27.942	a young superstar writer whose book involves
30.874	so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;
34.179	a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.
36.777	It's been fantastic.
38.186	Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.
42.037	Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research
45.716	shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.
50.047	So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.
52.98	Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,
54.88	in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib,
57.807	or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?
61.358	All right, good. These are all the liars.
63.262	Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)
66.555	No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.
68.701	The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,
71.553	or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,
74.213	very devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,
78.263	which suggests that lying is very pervasive.
81.617	It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality
85.578	to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can
88.018	tell the truth or make something up,
89.898	that has fascinated people throughout history.
92.749	Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.
95.378	Does anybody know what he was looking for?
98.058	A single honest man, and he died without finding one
101.842	back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East
104.859	who was really concerned with sincerity,
107.236	not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,
110.32	but that you believed in what you were doing.
113.474	You believed in your principles.
115.48	Now my first professional encounter with deception
118.411	is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.
121.874	I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.
125.673	Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.
128.499	You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,
132.281	that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)
137.311	Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception
140.848	while doing my duty here in customs,
143.903	one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,
146.787	and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.
148.539	But even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate
152.613	has been completely transformed. We email, we text,
155.91	we skype, we Facebook. It's insane.
158.523	Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed,
161.784	and of course that's had an impact on deception.
164.344	Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions
166.927	we've been tracking and documenting.
169.303	They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet
173.547	and the Chinese Water Army.
175.628	It sounds a little bit like a weird book,
177.525	but actually they're all new types of lies.
179.658	Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:
182.703	"""On my way."" Anybody ever written, ""On my way?"""
185.816	Then you've also lied. (Laughter)
189.579	We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.
193.776	"Here's another one: ""Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier."
196.539	"My battery was dead."" Your battery wasn't dead."
198.504	You weren't in a dead zone.
200.38	You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.
202.333	Here's the last one: You're talking to somebody,
204.13	"and you say, ""Sorry, got work, gotta go."""
206.62	But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.
210.417	Each of these is about a relationship,
212.833	and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,
217.238	you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.
220.203	And so these lies are being used by people
222.572	to create a buffer, like the butler used to do,
225.398	between us and the connections to everybody else.
228.805	But they're very special. They use ambiguity
230.512	that comes from using technology. You don't know
232.573	where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.
235.521	And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.
238.012	These aren't just people being jerks. These are people
240.593	that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,
242.969	or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.
245.393	Our relationship is still important.
247.793	Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,
249.307	is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't
251.65	about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.
254.715	Let me give you a very recent example,
256.717	as in, like, last week.
258.231	Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.
261.499	Here's one of his bestselling books.
263.519	Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.
266.932	My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,
269.589	"""Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."""
273.397	And of course, you might suspect
274.8	that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.
277.427	He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.
282.114	Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.
285.374	Walt Whitman also did this back in the day,
288.541	before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet
291.596	becomes interesting when we get to scale,
294.364	which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.
296.882	Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people
299.318	in China that are paid small amounts of money
302.366	to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be
305.4	propaganda. The government hires these people,
307.959	companies hire them, all over the place.
310.587	In North America, we call this Astroturfing,
314.204	and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
317.642	We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,
320.869	everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.
325.664	Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,
329.582	you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us
332.319	a deceptive species, especially when you think about
335.528	the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.
340.13	But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.
344.868	Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,
348.117	which I'm sure none of you have been in.
350.016	I can assure you there's deception there.
352.345	And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you
355.054	about getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)
358.282	Let's forget about that guy, too.
359.962	Let's focus on the conversations between our friends
362.906	and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.
365.053	Those are the conversations that really matter.
367.461	What does technology do to deception with those folks?
371.701	Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do
374.776	are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record
378.147	all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,
381.713	and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place
384.818	per conversation within a medium, and the finding
387.766	that we get that surprises people the most is that email
390.29	is the most honest of those three media.
393.569	And it really throws people for a loop because we think,
395.97	well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?
399.706	The phone, in contrast, the most lies.
404.01	Again and again and again we see the phone is the device
405.956	that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.
410.674	This tends to be very different from what people expect.
414.649	What about résumés? We did a study in which we had
417.873	people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job
420.417	either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,
423.931	which is a social networking site like Facebook,
426.753	but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé.
430.32	And what we found, to many people's surprise,
432.934	was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest
435.729	on the things that mattered to employers, like your
437.553	responsibilities or your skills at your previous job.
441.704	How about Facebook itself?
444	You know, we always think that hey, there are these
445.882	idealized versions, people are just showing the best things
448.011	that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.
450.667	My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.
453.735	Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.
457.556	They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.
461.774	Then they had strangers, many strangers,
463.73	judge the person's personality just from Facebook,
466.258	and what they found was those judgments of the personality
468.687	were pretty much identical, highly correlated,
471.196	meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.
475.569	All right, well, what about online dating?
478.141	I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.
479.641	"I'm sure you all have ""friends"" that have used online dating. (Laughter)"
483.176	And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair
485.234	when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.
488.264	Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did
491.4	is we brought people, online daters, into the lab,
494.507	and then we measured them. We got their height
495.987	up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight --
499.868	ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.
503.763	And what we found was very, very interesting.
508.074	Here's an example of the men and the height.
512.003	Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.
514.473	Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
519.335	That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,
522.411	they were telling exactly the truth.
523.965	Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.
527.078	What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.
529.945	In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,
532.886	"what we say in the lab as ""strong rounding up."" (Laughter)"
539.162	"You get to 5'8"" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9""."
543.665	But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.
545.663	They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found
548.229	was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie
550.637	on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.
554.232	One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,
557.256	a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,
560.857	game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied
564.476	subtly, not too much. They were constrained.
567.945	Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact
570.832	that despite our intuitions, mine included,
575.467	a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated
578.996	communication, is more honest than face to face?
583.024	That really is strange. How do we explain this?
585.513	Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
588.892	It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
593.237	It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,
595.899	hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
599.88	The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,
603.116	really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell
607.232	if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
610.616	That's really bad. Why is it so bad?
613.808	Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.
616.338	If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on
618.697	when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out
620.942	if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?
623.872	Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at
626.302	is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.
629.03	And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,
631.433	one of the top cues is eyes. But the research
634.296	over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue
638.12	to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of
641.117	the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.
643.472	The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.
645.902	Some situations, yes -- high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,
648.92	their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,
652.424	but not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.
657.256	Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me
660.634	doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,
663.053	but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.
665.96	We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain
668.327	or for somebody else's gain.
671.154	So there are some pathological liars, but they make up
673.084	a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.
676.597	Just because people can't see us doesn't mean
678.228	we're going to necessarily lie.
680.499	But I think there's actually something much more
682.052	interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big
685.326	thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going
689.123	way back in history to the origins of language.
692.262	Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere
696.149	between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.
699.317	A lot of humans have lived since then.
701.933	We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves
704.356	and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,
707.463	but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,
709.981	there's a lot of humans evolving speaking,
712.526	about 100 billion people in fact.
715.332	What's important though is that writing only emerged
718.114	about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that
721.701	all the people before there was any writing,
724.093	every word that they ever said, every utterance
729.679	disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.
734.431	So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which
738.496	there is no record. In fact, even the next big change
744.413	to writing was only 500 years ago now,
746.881	with the printing press, which is very recent in our past,
749.26	and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,
753.502	so even the people of the last two millennia,
756.886	most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.
761.918	Let's turn to now, the networked age.
765.509	How many of you have recorded something today?
770.221	Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?
773.398	It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.
777.624	In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more
780.672	than almost all of human pre-ancient history.
785.214	That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period
788.444	of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak
792.459	in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in
795.16	an environment where we're recording everything.
798.063	In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just
800.4	what we write that will be recorded, everything we do
802.749	will be recorded.
805.082	What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?
809.538	Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing
813.788	I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at
817.335	all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
820.946	I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
825.194	You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were
828.714	talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,
832.217	they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
834.921	So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of
837.356	looking at the language, is we paid people
839.851	to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.
843.386	The person never was at the James Hotel.
845.329	The other review is real. The person stayed there.
848.251	Now, your task now is to decide
851.778	which review is fake?
855.851	I'll give you a moment to read through them.
860.037	But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.
862.324	Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.
866.555	All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?
873.154	All right. Very good. About half.
875.296	And how many of you think that B is?
878.911	All right. Slightly more for B.
881.44	Excellent. Here's the answer.
884.032	B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)
890.613	You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,
893.459	it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits
896.205	with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here
898.851	in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.
902.621	Those cold, hard winters, I love it.
905.309	All right, so why do I care about this?
908.363	Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science
911.631	is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze
914.863	the linguistic traces of deception.
917.763	Let me highlight a couple of things here
919.596	in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think
923.039	about narrative. They make up a story:
924.627	Who? And what happened? And that's what happened here.
927.813	Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with
930.102	and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,
934.867	way more than the people that actually stayed there.
937.336	They were inserting themselves into the hotel review,
942.032	kind of trying to convince you they were there.
943.728	In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,
947.743	their bodies actually entered the physical space,
950.175	they talked a lot more about spatial information.
953.074	They said how big the bathroom was, or they said,
955.591	you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.
960.111	Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
964.272	Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate
967.03	than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
970.321	This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell
972.351	if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.
974.852	We believe that every lie now, every type of lie --
978.416	fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,
982.203	your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging --
985.117	those are all different lies. They're going to have
986.622	different patterns of language. But because everything's
989.481	recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.
994.17	Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.
998.163	It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn
1000.25	so much more about human thought and expression,
1004.052	about everything from love to attitudes,
1008.45	because everything is being recorded now, but
1010.41	what does it mean for the average citizen?
1012.814	What does it mean for us in our lives?
1015.616	Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,
1019.289	I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
1022.977	My outbox for email is massive,
1026.193	and I never look at it. I write all the time,
1029.53	but I never look at my record, at my trace.
1032.968	And I think we're going to see a lot more of that,
1034.535	where we can reflect on who we are by looking at
1037.696	what we wrote, what we said, what we did.
1041.314	Now, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple
1043.586	of take-away things here.
1045.563	First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?
1050.051	Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,
1052.757	but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,
1057.032	and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze
1058.792	with some computer algorithms.
1060.246	So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.
1063.419	But when it comes to lying and what we want to do
1067.573	with our lives, I think we can go back to
1070.126	Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned
1073.875	about whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about
1076.707	being true to the self, and I think this is really important.
1079.992	Now, when you are about to say or do something,
1084.175	we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,
1088.735	part of my personal record?
1091.448	Because in the digital age we live in now,
1094.105	in the networked age, we are all leaving a record.
1098.569	Thank you so much for your time,
1100.264	and good luck with your record. (Applause)
