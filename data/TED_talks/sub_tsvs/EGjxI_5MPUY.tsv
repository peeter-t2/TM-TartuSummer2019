16.26	The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,
19.26	wrote a volume called
21.26	"""People Who Led to My Plays."""
23.26	And if I were to write a volume,
25.26	it would be called,
27.26	"""Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"""
29.26	because my work,
31.26	in understanding art and in understanding culture,
34.26	has come by following artists,
37.26	by looking at what artists mean
40.26	and what they do and who they are.
43.26	"J.J. from ""Good Times,"""
45.26	(Applause)
48.26	significant to many people of course
50.26	"because of ""Dy-no-mite,"""
52.26	but perhaps more significant
54.26	as the first, really, black artist
57.26	on primetime TV.
60.26	Jean-Michel Basquiat,
62.26	important to me because [he was]
64.26	the first black artist in real time
67.26	that showed me the possibility of
69.26	who and what I was about to enter into.
72.26	My overall project is about art --
75.26	specifically, about black artists --
77.26	very generally
79.26	about the way in which art
81.26	can change the way we think
83.26	about culture and ourselves.
86.26	My interest is in artists
88.26	who understand and rewrite history,
91.26	who think about themselves
93.26	within the narrative
95.26	of the larger world of art,
97.26	but who have created new places
99.26	for us to see and understand.
102.26	I'm showing two artists here, 
102.26	Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,
105.26	two of many who really form for me
108.26	the essential questions that I wanted to bring
111.26	as a curator to the world.
113.26	I was interested in the idea
116.26	of why and how
118.26	I could create a new story,
121.26	a new narrative in art history
123.26	and a new narrative in the world.
125.26	And to do this, I knew
127.26	that I had to see the way in which artists work,
130.26	understand the artist's studio
132.26	as a laboratory,
134.26	imagine, then,
136.26	reinventing the museum as a think tank
139.26	and looking at the exhibition
142.26	as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,
145.26	providing the space
147.26	to look and to think about answers.
150.26	In 1994,
152.26	when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,
154.26	I made an exhibition called Black Male.
156.26	It looked at the intersection
158.26	of race and gender
160.26	in contemporary American art.
162.26	It sought to express
164.26	the ways in which art
166.26	could provide a space for dialogue --
168.26	complicated dialogue,
170.26	dialogue with many, many points of entry --
173.26	and how the museum could be the space
175.26	for this contest of ideas.
177.26	This exhibition included
179.26	over 20 artists
181.26	of various ages and races,
183.26	but all looking at black masculinity
186.26	from a very particular point of view.
192.26	What was significant about this exhibition
195.26	is the way in which
197.26	it engaged me in my role
200.26	as a curator, as a catalyst,
202.26	for this dialogue.
204.26	One of the things that happened
206.26	very distinctly in the course of this exhibition
208.26	is I was confronted with the idea
210.26	of how powerful images can be
212.26	in people's understanding 
212.26	of themselves and each other.
215.26	I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,
218.26	one on the left by Robert Colescott.
221.26	And in the course of the exhibition --
223.26	which was contentious, controversial
225.26	and ultimately, for me,
227.26	life-changing
229.26	in my sense of what art could be --
231.26	a woman came up to me on the gallery floor
234.26	to express her concern about the nature
237.26	of how powerful images could be
239.26	and how we understood each other.
241.26	And she pointed to the work on the left
243.26	to tell me how problematic this image was,
245.26	as it related, for her, to the idea of
248.26	how black people had been represented.
251.26	And she pointed to the image on the right
253.26	as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity
256.26	that needed to be portrayed
258.26	to work against those images in the media.
260.26	She then assigned these works racial identities,
263.26	basically saying to me that the work on the right,
265.26	clearly, was made by a black artist,
267.26	the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,
269.26	when, in effect,
271.26	that was the opposite case:
273.26	Bob Colescott, African-American artist;
275.26	Leon Golub, a white artist.
277.26	The point of that for me was
279.26	to say -- in that space, in that moment --
282.26	that I really, more than anything,
284.26	wanted to understand
286.26	how images could work, how images did work,
289.26	and how artists provided
291.26	a space bigger than one
293.26	that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives
295.26	to work through these images.
298.26	Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;
301.26	home for many of black America,
304.26	very much the psychic heart
307.26	of the black experience,
309.26	really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.
313.26	Harlem now, sort of explaining
316.26	and thinking of itself in this part of the century,
319.26	looking both backwards and forwards ...
321.26	I always say Harlem is an interesting community
323.26	because, unlike many other places,
325.26	it thinks of itself in the past, present
327.26	and the future simultaneously;
329.26	no one speaks of it just in the now.
331.26	It's always what it was and what it can be.
334.26	And, in thinking about that,
336.26	then my second project, the second question I ask is:
338.26	Can a museum
340.26	be a catalyst in a community?
342.26	Can a museum house artists
344.26	and allow them to be change agents
346.26	as communities rethink themselves?
349.26	This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,
352.26	thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.
356.26	So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,
358.26	thinking about exhibitions there,
360.26	thinking about what it means to
362.26	discover art's possibility.
364.26	Now, what does this mean to some of you?
366.26	In some cases, I know that many of you
369.26	are involved in cross-cultural dialogues,
371.26	you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
374.26	Think about the place that artists can play in that --
377.26	that is the kind of incubation and advocacy
380.26	that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.
383.26	Think about artists, not as content providers,
385.26	though they can be brilliant at that,
387.26	but, again, as real catalysts.
391.26	The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.
394.26	And I bring this up because it's important to locate
397.26	this practice in history.
399.26	To look at 1968,
401.26	in the incredible historic moment that it is,
403.26	and think of the arc that has happened since then,
406.26	to think of the possibilities that we are all
409.26	privileged to stand in today
411.26	and imagine that this museum
413.26	that came out of a moment of great protest
415.26	and one that was so much about
417.26	examining the history and the legacy
419.26	of important African-American artists
422.26	to the history of art in this country
424.26	like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,
426.26	Romare Bearden.
428.26	And then, of course,
430.26	to bring us to today.
432.26	In 1975, Muhammad Ali
434.26	gave a lecture at Harvard University.
436.26	After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,
439.26	"""Give us a poem."""
441.26	"And Mohammed Ali said, ""Me, we."""
443.26	A profound statement about the individual and the community.
446.26	The space in which now,
448.26	in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,
451.26	of trying to define
453.26	what might be
455.26	black art cultural movement of the 21st century.
458.26	What that might mean
460.26	for cultural movements all over this moment,
463.26	"the ""me, we"" seems"
465.26	incredibly prescient
467.26	totally important.
469.26	To this end,
471.26	the specific project that has made this possible for me
474.26	is a series of exhibitions,
476.26	all titled with an F --
478.26	Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --
480.26	which have set out to discover
482.26	and define
484.26	the young, black artists working in this moment
487.26	who I feel strongly
489.26	will continue to work over the next many years.
492.26	This series of exhibitions
494.26	was made specifically
496.26	to try and question
498.26	the idea of what it would mean
500.26	now, at this point in history,
502.26	to see art as a catalyst;
505.26	what it means now, at this point in history,
507.26	as we define and redefine culture,
510.26	black culture specifically in my case,
512.26	but culture generally.
514.26	I named this group of artists
516.26	around an idea, which I put out there
519.26	called post-black,
521.26	really meant to define them
523.26	as artists who came and start their work now,
526.26	looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.
530.26	It is really in this sense of discovery
533.26	that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.
536.26	This new set of questions is:
538.26	What does it mean, right now,
540.26	to be African-American in America?
543.26	What can artwork say about this?
546.26	Where can a museum exist
549.26	as the place for us all
552.26	to have this conversation?
554.26	Really, most exciting about this
556.26	is thinking about the energy and the excitement
559.26	that young artists can bring.
561.26	Their works for me are about,
563.26	not always just simply
565.26	about the aesthetic innovation
567.26	that their minds imagine, that their visions create
570.26	and put out there in the world,
572.26	but more, perhaps, importantly,
574.26	through the excitement of the community
576.26	that they create as important voices
579.26	that would allow us right now to understand our situation,
582.26	as well as in the future.
584.26	I am continually amazed
587.26	by the way in which
589.26	the subject of race
591.26	can take itself in many places
594.26	that we don't imagine it should be.
596.26	I am always amazed
599.26	by the way in which artists are willing
601.26	to do that in their work.
603.26	It is why I look to art.
605.26	It's why I ask questions of art.
607.26	It is why I make exhibitions.
610.26	Now, this exhibition, as I said,
615.26	and for me it's about considering the implications.
619.26	It's considering the implications of
621.26	what this generation has to say to the rest of us.
624.26	It's considering what it means for these artists
627.26	to be both out in the world as their work travels,
629.26	but in their communities
631.26	as people who are seeing and thinking
634.26	about the issues that face us.
637.26	It's also about thinking about
639.26	the creative spirit and nurturing it,
641.26	and imagining, particularly in urban America,
643.26	about the nurturing of the spirit.
646.26	Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
649.26	For me, it is about re-imagining
652.26	this cultural discourse in an international context.
655.26	So the last iteration of this project
658.26	has been called Flow,
660.26	with the idea now of creating
662.26	a real network
664.26	of artists around the world;
666.26	really looking, not so much
668.26	from Harlem and out, but looking across,
671.26	and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.
674.26	And as many of us think about that continent
677.26	and think about what if means
679.26	to us all in the 21st century,
681.26	I have begun that looking
683.26	through artists, through artworks,
685.26	and imagining what they can tell us about the future,
688.26	what they tell us about our future,
691.26	and what they create in their sense of
694.26	offering us this great possibility of watching
697.26	that continent emerge as part
699.26	of our bigger dialogue.
701.26	So, what do I discover
703.26	when I look at artworks?
705.26	What do I think about
707.26	when I think about art?
709.26	I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator
711.26	is not just the discovery of new works,
714.26	the discovery of exciting works.
716.26	But, really, it has been
718.26	what I've discovered about myself
720.26	and what I can offer
722.26	in the space of an exhibition,
724.26	to talk about beauty, to talk about power,
727.26	to talk about ourselves,
729.26	and to talk and speak to each other.
732.26	That's what makes me get up every day
735.26	and want to think about
737.26	this generation of black artists and artists around the world.
740.26	Thank you. (Applause)
