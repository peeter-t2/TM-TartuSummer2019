25	I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like
25	to talk a little bit about today
28.215	are some ideas that I think
28.215	have just tremendous resonance
31.96	with all the things that have been
31.96	talked about the last two days.
35.48	So many different points of resonance
37.28	that it's going to be difficult
37.28	to bring them all up,
39.781	but I'll try to do my best.
41.12	Does anybody remember these?
42.52	(Laughter)
44.32	OK, so these are LP records
44.32	and they've been replaced, right?
50.32	They've been swept away
50.32	over the last two decades
53.04	by these types of world-flattening
53.04	digitization technologies, right?
57.92	And I think it was best witnessed
60.56	when Thomas was playing the music
60.56	as we came in the room today.
64.4	What's happened in the music world
64.4	is there's a culture,
67.08	or an ecosystem that's been created
68.88	that, if you take some words from Apple,
71.48	the catchphrase --
71.48	that we create, rip, mix and burn.
75.48	What I mean by that is that anyone
75.48	in the world is free and allowed
78.68	to create new music and musical ideas.
81.04	Anyone in the world is allowed
81.04	to rip or copy musical ideas,
84.76	use them in innovative ways.
86.52	Anyone is allowed to mix them
86.52	in different types of ways,
89.519	draw connections between musical ideas,
91.72	and people can burn them or create
91.72	final products and continue the circle.
95.72	And what that's done
95.72	is it's created, like I said,
98.08	a vibrant community that's very inclusive,
100.104	with people continually working
100.104	to connect musical ideas,
103.84	innovate them and keep things
103.84	constantly up to date.
107.28	Today's hit single
107.28	is not last year's hit single.
111.08	But I'm not here
111.08	to talk about music today.
113.28	I'm here to talk about books.
114.76	In particular, textbooks
114.76	and the kind of educational materials
118.2	that we use every day in school.
120.64	Has anyone here ever been to school?
122.379	(Laughter)
123.8	OK, does anybody realize
123.8	there's a crisis in our schools,
127.8	around the world?
129.6	I'm not going to spend
129.6	too much time on that,
132.16	but what I want to talk about
132.16	is some of the disconnects
135.52	that appear when an author
135.52	publishes a book.
138.04	That in fact, the publishing process --
139.922	just because of the fact
139.922	that it's complicated,
142.137	it's heavy, books are expensive --
143.84	creates a sort of a wall
143.84	between authors of books
147.16	and the ultimate users of books,
148.72	be they teachers, students
148.72	or just general readers.
152.84	And this is even more true
152.84	if you happen to speak a language
156	other than one of the world's
156	major languages, and especially English.
159.96	I'm going to call these people
159.96	"below the barrier ""shutouts"""
162.8	because they're really
162.8	shut out of the process
164.967	of being able to share
164.967	their knowledge with the world.
167.519	And so what I want to talk about today
167.519	is trying to take these ideas
170.735	that we've seen in the musical culture
172.582	and try to bring these
172.582	towards reinventing the way
174.947	we think about writing books,
174.947	using them and teaching from them.
178.8	So, that's what I'd like to talk about
180.64	and, really, how we get
180.64	from where we are now
182.903	to where we need to go.
184.2	The first thing I'd like you to do
184.2	is a little thought experiment.
187.32	Imagine taking all the world's books.
189.106	OK, everybody imagine books
189.106	and imagine just tearing out the pages.
192.64	So, liberating these pages
194.76	and imagine digitizing them
194.76	and then storing them
198.04	in a vast, interconnected,
198.04	global repository.
200.96	Think of it as a massive iTunes
200.96	for book-type content.
206.6	And then take that material
206.6	and imagine making it all open,
209.88	so that people can modify it,
209.88	play with it, improve it.
212.96	Imagine making it free,
214.24	so that anyone in the world can have
214.24	access to all of this knowledge,
217.503	and imagine using information technology
219.88	so that you can update this content,
219.88	improve it, play with it,
223.24	on a timescale that's more
223.24	on the order of seconds instead of years.
227.92	Instead of editions of a book
227.92	coming out every two years,
230.8	imagine them coming out every 25 seconds.
233.76	So, imagine we could do that
233.76	and imagine we could put people into this.
238.04	So that we could truly build
238.04	an ecosystem with not just authors,
241.44	but all the people
241.44	who could be or want to be authors
245.04	in all the different
245.04	languages of the world,
247.12	and I think if you could do this,
247.12	it would be called --
249.72	I'm just going to refer to it
249.72	as a knowledge ecosystem.
252.32	So, really, this is the dream,
254.44	and in a sense what you can think of it
256.322	is we're trying
256.322	to enable anyone in the world,
258.489	I mean anyone in the world --
260.04	(Laughter)
261.28	to be their own educational DJ,
263.4	creating educational materials,
263.4	sharing them with the world,
266.24	constantly innovating on them.
268	So, this is the dream.
269.24	In fact, this dream
269.24	is actually being realized.
272.08	Over the last six-and-a-half years,
273.92	we've been working really hard
273.92	at Rice University
276.6	on a project called Connexions,
278.2	and so what I'd like to do
278.2	for the rest of the talk
280.64	is just tell you a little bit
282.045	about what people are doing
282.045	with Connexions,
284.12	which you can kind of
284.12	think of as the counterpoint
286.48	to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,
288.409	where they're working on the hardware
288.409	of bringing education to the world.
291.862	We're working on the open-source tools
294.36	and the content.
295.92	So, that's sort of
295.92	to put it in perspective here.
298.76	So, create.
300.36	What are some of the people
300.36	that are using these kind of tools?
303.36	Well, the first thing is,
304.6	there's a community
304.6	of engineering professors,
307.48	from Cambridge to Kyoto,
309.6	who are developing engineering content
309.6	in electrical engineering
313.56	to develop what you can think of
313.56	as a massive, super textbook
317.56	that covers the entire area
317.56	of electrical engineering.
320.52	And not only that --
321.76	it can be customized for use in each
321.76	of their own individual institutions.
327.12	If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --
330.6	a private music teacher and mom
330.6	from Champagne, Illinois,
335	who wanted to share her fantastic
335	music content with the world,
338.4	on how to teach kids how to play music --
340.68	Her material is now used
340.68	over 600,000 times per month.
346.16	Tremendous use.
347.68	In fact, a lot of this use coming
347.68	from United States K-12 schools,
351.96	because anyone who's involved
351.96	in a school scale back,
356.4	the first thing that's cut
356.4	is the music curriculum.
359.08	And so this is just indicating
359.08	the tremendous thirst
361.6	for this kind of open, free content.
363.76	A lot of teachers are using this stuff.
366.16	What about ripping?
366.16	What about copying, reusing?
369.24	A team of volunteers
369.24	at the University of Texas at El Paso --
372.68	graduate students translating
372.68	this engineering super textbook ideas.
377.56	And within about a week,
379.2	having this be some
379.2	of our most popular material
381.56	in widespread use all over Latin America,
381.56	and in particular in Mexico,
385.96	because of the open,
385.96	extensible nature of this.
388.8	People, volunteers and even companies
391.64	that are translating materials
391.64	into Asian languages
394.28	like Chinese, Japanese and Thai,
396.48	to spread the knowledge even further.
400.76	OK, what about people who are mixing?
402.56	"What does ""mixing"" mean?"
403.76	"""Mixing"" means"
403.76	building customized courses,
405.8	means building customized books.
409.32	Companies like National Instruments,
411.08	who are embedding very powerful,
411.08	interactive simulations
416.2	into the materials,
417.4	so that we can go way beyond
417.4	our regular kind of textbook
420.36	to an experience
421.6	that all the teaching materials
421.6	are things you can actually interact with
425.56	and play around with
425.56	and actually learn as you do.
429.52	We've been working
429.52	with Teachers Without Borders,
431.88	who are very interested
431.88	in mixing our materials.
434.143	They're going to be using
434.143	Connexions as their platform
436.84	to develop and deliver teaching materials
436.84	for teaching teachers how to teach
442.08	in 84 countries around the world.
444.68	TWB is currently in Iraq,
447.92	training 20,000 teachers
447.92	supported by USAID.
452.48	And to them, this idea
452.48	of being able to remix
455.32	and customize to the local context
455.32	is extraordinarily important,
460	because just providing
460	free content to people
462.76	has actually been likened
462.76	by people in the developing world
465.8	to a kind of cultural imperialism --
468.16	that if you don't empower people
469.72	with the ability
469.72	to re-contextualize the material,
472.12	translate it into their own language
472.12	and take ownership of it,
475.32	it's not good.
477.08	OK, other organizations
477.08	we've been working with, UC Merced --
481.48	people know about UC Merced.
483.28	It's a new university in California,
483.28	in the Central Valley,
487.2	working very closely
487.2	with community colleges.
489.96	They're actually developing
491.32	a lot of their science
491.32	and engineering curriculum
493.64	to spread widely
493.64	around the world in our system.
498.16	And they're also trying to develop
498.16	all of their software tools
501.089	completely open-source.
502.52	We've been working with AMD,
502.52	which has a project called 50x15,
507.28	which is trying to bring
507.28	Internet connectivity
510.04	to 50 percent of the world's
510.04	population by 2015.
513.68	We're going to be
513.68	providing content to them
515.72	in a whole range of different languages.
517.88	And we've also been working
517.88	with a number of other organizations.
521	In particular, a bunch of the projects
521	that are funded by Hewlett Foundation,
525.04	who have taken a real leadership role
525.04	in this area of open content.
529.52	OK, burn -- I think
529.52	this is, sort of, quite interesting.
533.12	"""Burn"" is the idea of trying"
533.12	to create the physical instantiation
537.4	of one of these courses.
538.64	And I think a lot of you received --
540.72	I think all of you received one
540.72	of these music books in your gift pack.
546.6	A little present for you.
548.08	Just to tell you quickly about it:
548.08	this is an engineering textbook.
551.6	It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.
556.2	This costs -- anybody guess?
560.32	How much would it cost in a bookstore?
562.4	(Audience) 65 dollars.
563.64	Richard Baraniuk:
563.64	OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.
568.4	Why does it cost 22 dollars?
569.76	Because it's published on demand
571.76	and it's developed
571.76	from this repository of open materials.
575.32	If this book were to be published
575.32	by a regular publisher,
578.04	it would cost at least 122 dollars.
581.24	So what we're seeing
582.48	is moving this burning
582.48	or publication process
585.4	from the regular,
585.4	sort of single-authored book
588.92	towards community-authored materials
591.32	that are modular, that are customized
591.32	to each individual class
595.08	and published on demand
595.08	very inexpensively,
597.76	either pushed out through Amazon
600.28	or published directly
600.28	through an on-demand press, like QOOP.
604.48	And I think that this is
604.48	an extraordinarily interesting area
607.92	because there is tremendous area
607.92	under this long tail in publishing.
613.76	We're not talking
613.76	about the Harry Potter end,
615.92	right at the left side.
617.16	We're talking about books
618.4	on hypergeometric
618.4	partial differential equations.
621.04	Books that might sell
625.36	There is tremendous
625.36	sustaining revenue under this long tail
630.24	to sustain open projects like ours,
632.68	but also to sustain this new emergence
632.68	of on-demand publishers,
637.56	like QOOP, who produced these two books.
639.88	And I think one of the things
639.88	that you should take away from this talk
643.19	is that there's an impending
643.19	cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,
647.24	that's going to be happening
647.24	in the publishing industry.
649.92	And it's going to reach a crescendo
649.92	over the next few years,
652.8	and I think that it's for our benefit,
652.8	really, and for the world's benefit.
656.64	OK, so what are the enablers?
658.32	What's really making all of this happen?
660.28	There's tons of technology,
661.92	and the only piece of technology
661.92	that I really want to talk about is XML.
665.8	How many people know about XML?
667.56	Oh, great.
668.8	So it's the future of the web, right?
670.6	It's semantic representation of content.
675	And what you can really
675	think of XML in this case
677.4	is it's the packaging
677.4	that we're putting around these pages.
680.32	Remember we took the book,
680.32	tore the pages out?
682.6	Well, what the XML is going to do
684.52	is it's going to turn those pages
684.52	into Lego blocks.
688.88	XML are the nubs on the Lego
690.8	that allow us to combine the content
690.8	together in a myriad different ways,
694.88	and it provides us a framework
694.88	to share content.
698.4	So, it lets you take this ecosystem
701.72	in its primordial state
701.72	of all this content,
704.32	all the pages you've torn out of books,
706.202	and create highly sophisticated
706.202	learning machines:
710.2	books, courses, course packs.
712.96	It gives you the ability
712.96	to personalize the learning experience
716.68	to each individual student,
718.4	so that every student
718.4	can have a book or a course
721.08	that's customized to their
721.08	learning style, their context,
724.56	their language and the things
724.56	that excite them.
727.32	It lets you reuse the same materials
727.32	in multiple different ways,
730.96	and surprising new ways.
732.96	It lets you interconnect ideas,
734.92	indicating how fields
734.92	relate to each other.
739.12	And I'll just give you my personal story.
741.4	We came up with this
741.4	six-and-a-half years ago
743.92	because I teach the stuff in the red box.
746.56	And my day job, as Chris said --
746.56	I'm an electrical engineering professor.
750.36	I teach signal processing
752.04	and my challenge
752.04	was to show that this math --
754.6	Wow, about half of you
754.6	have already fallen asleep
756.96	just looking at the equation.
758.44	(Laughter)
759.64	But this seemingly dry math
761.12	is actually the center
761.12	of this tremendously powerful web
765.48	that links technology --
767.2	that links really cool applications
767.2	like music synthesizers
770.96	to tremendous economic opportunities,
774.12	but also governed
774.12	by intellectual property.
776.28	And the thing that I realized
777.72	is there was no way
777.72	that I, as an engineer,
780	could write this book
780	that would get all of this across.
782.644	We needed a community to do it
784.097	and we needed new tools
784.097	to be able to interconnect these ideas.
788.16	And I think that really,
788.16	in a sense, what we're trying to do
791.04	is make Minsky's dream come to a reality,
793.04	where you can imagine
793.04	all the books in a library
795.32	actually starting to talk to each other.
797.28	And people who are teachers out here --
797.28	whoever taught, you know this --
801	it's the interconnections between ideas
801	that teaching is really all about.
805.52	OK, back to math.
807.6	Imagine -- this is possible:
810.12	that every single equation that you
810.12	click on in one of your new e-texts
814.72	is something that you're going to be able
814.72	to explore and experiment with.
818.48	So imagine your kid's
818.48	algebra textbook in seventh grade.
822.04	You can click on every single equation
823.96	and bring up a little tool
823.96	to be able to experiment with it,
826.84	tinker with it, understand it.
828.72	Because we really
828.72	don't understand until we do.
831.48	The same type of mark-up,
831.48	like MathML, for chemistry.
835.68	Imagine chemistry textbooks
837	that actually understand the structure
837	of how molecules are formed.
841.24	Imagine Music XML
843.2	that actually lets you delve
843.2	into the semantic structure of music,
846.64	play with it, understand it.
848.48	It's no wonder that everybody's
848.48	getting into it, right?
851.68	Even the three wise men.
852.96	(Laughter)
854.16	OK, the second big enabler,
854.16	and this is where I told a big lie.
859.72	The second big enabler
859.72	is intellectual property.
862.88	Because, in fact, I got up here
864.4	and I talked about how great
864.4	the music culture is.
866.76	We can share and rip, mix and burn,
866.76	but in fact, that's all illegal.
870.4	And we would be accused
870.4	of [piracy] for doing that,
873.8	because this music has been propertized.
877.16	It's now owned,
877.16	much of it by big industries.
881.48	So, really, the key thing here
881.48	is we can't let this happen.
884.266	We can't let this
884.266	Napster thing happen here.
887	So, what we have to do
887	is get it right from the very beginning.
889.977	And what we have to do
889.977	is find an intellectual property framework
893.4	that makes sharing safe
893.4	and makes it easily understandable.
898.48	And the inspiration here
898.48	is taken from open-source software.
902.32	Things like Linux and the GPL.
905.92	The Creative Commons licenses.
908.325	How many people
908.325	have heard of creative commons?
910.54	If you have not, you must learn about it.
912.52	Creativecommons.org.
914.12	At the bottom of every piece
914.12	of material in Connexions
917.48	and in lots of other projects,
919.36	you can find their logo.
920.96	Clicking on that logo
920.96	takes you to an absolute no-nonsense,
924.56	human-readable document, a deed,
927.72	that tells you exactly
927.72	what you can do with this content.
930.411	In fact, you're free to share it,
930.411	to do all of these things:
934.04	to copy it, to change it,
934.04	even to make commercial use of it,
937.12	as long as you attribute the author.
940.04	Because in academic publishing
940.04	and much of educational publishing,
944.48	it's really this idea of sharing knowledge
948.84	and making impact.
950.16	That's why people write,
950.16	not necessarily making bucks.
954.04	We're not talking
954.04	about Harry Potter, right?
956.16	We're at the long tail end here.
957.88	Behind that is the legal code,
957.88	very carefully constructed.
962.56	And Creative Commons is taking off --
964.44	over 43 million things out there,
968.6	licensed with a Creative Commons license.
970.72	Not just text,
973.84	but music, images, video.
976.36	And there's actually a tremendous uptake
978.4	of the number of people
978.4	that are actually licensing music
981.88	to make it free for people
981.88	who do this whole idea of re-sampling,
985.12	ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.
987.28	OK, I'd like to conclude
987.28	with just the last few points.
991	So, we've built this idea of a commons.
993.4	People are using it.
995.32	We get over 500,000 unique visitors
995.32	per month, just to our particular site.
1001.64	MIT OpenCourseWare,
1001.64	which is another large open-content site,
1005.72	gets a similar number of hits.
1007.96	But how do we protect this?
1009.64	How do we protect it into the future?
1011.44	And the first thing
1011.44	that people are probably thinking
1014.2	is quality control, right?
1015.84	Because we're saying that anybody
1015.84	can contribute things to this commons.
1020.56	Anybody can contribute anything.
1023.4	So that could be a problem.
1025.96	It didn't take long until people
1025.96	started contributing materials,
1030.2	for example, on lingerie,
1032.36	which is actually a pretty good module.
1034.36	The only problem is it's plagiarized
1034.36	from a major French feminist journal,
1039.96	and when you go
1039.96	to the supposed course website,
1042.8	it points to a lingerie-selling website.
1047	So this is a little bit of a problem.
1049.2	So we clearly need some kind
1049.2	of idea of quality control
1052.28	and this is really where the idea
1052.28	of review and peer review comes in.
1056	You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
1058.4	Because Chris and his team have ensured
1060.839	that things are
1060.839	very, very high quality, right?
1064.04	And so we need to be able
1064.04	to do the same thing.
1066.48	And we need to be able
1066.48	to design structures,
1069.56	and what we're doing
1069.56	is designing social software
1072.64	to enable anyone to build
1072.64	their own peer review process,
1075.76	"and we call these things ""lenses."""
1077.6	And basically what they allow
1079.04	is anyone out there can develop
1079.04	their own peer-review process,
1082.48	so that they can focus
1082.48	on the content in the repository
1086.48	that they think is really important.
1088.219	And you can think of TED
1088.219	as a potential lens.
1091.52	So I'd just like to end by saying:
1093.321	you can really view this
1093.321	as a call to action.
1098	Connexions and open content
1098	is all about sharing knowledge.
1103	All of you here are tremendously imbued
1103	with tremendous amounts of knowledge,
1108.04	and what I'd like to do
1108.04	is invite each and every one of you
1110.84	to contribute to this project
1110.84	and other projects of its type,
1114.08	because I think together
1114.08	we can truly change the landscape
1117.88	of education and educational publishing.
1120.12	So, thanks very much.
