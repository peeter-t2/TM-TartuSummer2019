12.245	Mobility in developing world cities
15.378	is a very peculiar challenge,
17.536	because different from health
19.341	or education or housing,
21.651	it tends to get worse as societies become richer.
25.085	Clearly, a unsustainable model.
27.869	Mobility, as most other developing country problems,
32.196	more than a matter of money or technology,
36.101	is a matter of equality, equity.
41.492	The great inequality in developing countries
44.601	makes it difficult to see, for example,
48.026	that in terms of transport,
50.59	an advanced city is not one
52.52	where even the poor use cars,
54.542	but rather one where even the rich
56.565	use public transport.
58.789	Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,
62.355	more than 30 percent of the population
64.385	uses bicycles,
65.92	despite the fact that the Netherlands has
67.818	a higher income per capita than the United States.
71.801	There is a conflict in developing world cities
75.658	for money, for government investment.
78.226	If more money is invested in highways,
80.727	of course there is less money for housing,
82.739	for schools, for hospitals,
85.096	and also there is a conflict for space.
89.072	There is a conflict for space between
91.498	those with cars and those without them.
94.023	Most of us accept today
95.866	that private property and a market economy
98.65	is the best way to manage
98.65	most of society's resources.
101.848	However, there is a problem with that,
104.253	that market economy needs
106.921	inequality of income in order to work.
109.639	Some people must make more money,
111.181	some others less.
112.732	Some companies succeed. Others fail.
115.301	Then what kind of equality
117.175	can we hope for today
118.78	with a market economy?
120.702	I would propose two kinds
122.638	which both have much to do with cities.
124.992	The first one is equality of quality of life,
128.098	especially for children,
129.886	that all children should have,
131.541	beyond the obvious health and education,
134.548	access to green spaces, to sports facilities,
138.407	to swimming pools, to music lessons.
141.433	And the second kind of equality
143.924	"is one which we could call ""democratic equality."""
148.207	The first article in every constitution states
151.156	that all citizens are equal before the law.
154.445	That is not just poetry.
156.9	It's a very powerful principle.
159.101	For example, if that is true,
161.687	a bus with 80 passengers
163.572	has a right to 80 times more road space
166.301	than a car with one.
169.173	We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,
173.566	that it's before our noses and we do not see it.
177.297	Less than 100 years ago,
179.573	women could not vote,
180.96	and it seemed normal,
183.166	in the same way that it seems normal today
186.85	to see a bus in traffic.
189.782	In fact, when I became mayor,
192.733	applying that democratic principle
195.701	that public good prevails over private interest,
198.113	that a bus with 100 people
201.013	has a right to 100 times
201.013	more road space than a car,
203.587	we implemented a mass transit system
206.601	based on buses in exclusive lanes.
209.07	We called it TransMilenio,
209.07	in order to make buses sexier.
213.512	And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful
213.512	democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,
221.309	expensive cars stuck in traffic,
225.473	it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.
231.8	In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.
235.629	It doesn't take Ph.D.'s.
237.521	A committee of 12-year-old children
239.793	would find out in 20 minutes
241.799	that the most efficient way to use scarce road space
245.503	is with exclusive lanes for buses.
248.987	In fact, buses are not sexy,
252.309	but they are the only possible means
255.456	to bring mass transit to all areas
258.739	of fast growing developing cities.
262.414	They also have great capacity.
264.589	For example, this system in Guangzhou
267.333	is moving more passengers our direction
270.038	than all subway lines in China,
272.862	except for one line in Beijing,
275.353	at a fraction of the cost.
277.69	We fought not just for space for buses,
281.804	but we fought for space for people,
284.86	and that was even more difficult.
288.073	Cities are human habitats,
290.858	and we humans are pedestrians.
294.587	Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly
297.651	or deer need to run, we need to walk.
300.443	There is a really enormous conflict,
303.774	when we are talking about developing country cities,
306.775	between pedestrians and cars.
309.454	Here, what you see is a picture that shows
312.385	insufficient democracy.
314.037	What this shows is that people who walk
317.129	are third-class citizens
318.804	while those who go in cars
320.139	are first-class citizens.
321.954	In terms of transport infrastructure,
324.361	what really makes a difference
325.564	between advanced and backward cities
328.11	is not highways or subways
330.202	but quality sidewalks.
332.466	Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,
335.232	and they forgot to make a sidewalk.
339.19	This is prevailing all over the world.
341.514	Not even schoolchildren
341.514	are more important than cars.
345.299	In my city of Bogotá,
347.54	we fought a very difficult battle
350.894	in order to take space from cars,
353.668	which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,
356.564	in order to make space for people that should reflect
359.679	dignity of human beings,
361.347	and to make space for protected bikeways.
364.196	First of all, I had black hair before that.
366.941	(Laughter)
368.917	And I was almost impeached in the process.
372.173	It is a very difficult battle.
374.317	However, it was possible, finally,
377.494	after very difficult battles, to make a city
380.732	that would reflect some respect for human dignity,
383.416	that would show that those who walk are equally
385.211	important to those who have cars.
387.032	Indeed, a very important ideological
387.032	and political issue anywhere
391.681	is how to distribute that most valuable resource
394.627	of a city, which is road space.
397.036	A city could find oil or diamonds underground
399.873	and it would not be so valuable as road space.
401.964	How to distribute it between pedestrians,
405.125	bicycles, public transport and cars?
408.227	This is not a technological issue,
411.018	and we should remember that in no constitution
414.542	parking is a constitutional right
416.863	when we make that distribution.
419.364	We also built, and this was 15 years ago,
422.995	before there were bikeways in New York
424.933	or in Paris or in London,
426.377	it was a very difficult battle as well,
428.824	more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.
433.644	I don't think protected bicycle ways
435.568	are a cute architectural feature.
438.322	They are a right, just as sidewalks are,
441.028	unless we believe that only those
443.226	with access to a motor vehicle
445.56	have a right to safe mobility,
447.627	without the risk of getting killed.
449.9	And just as busways are,
453.567	protected bikeways also are
455.658	a powerful symbol of democracy,
457.537	because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle
461.187	is equally important
463.609	to one in a $30,000 car.
467.551	And we are living in a unique moment in history.
471.268	In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities
475.72	which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.
480.282	In many developing country cities,
482.58	more than 80 and 90 percent
484.64	of the city which will exist in 2060
489.342	will be built over the next four or five decades.
491.703	But this is not just a matter
491.703	for developing country cities.
494.825	In the United States, for example,
496.814	more than 70 million new homes
499.479	must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.
502.176	That's more than all the homes that today exist
505.249	in Britain, France and Canada put together.
509.765	And I believe that our cities today
513.122	have severe flaws,
515.237	and that different, better ones could be built.
518.795	What is wrong with our cities today?
521.243	Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child
525.477	who is barely learning to speak
527.182	in any city in the world today,
528.693	"""Watch out, a car,"""
530.375	the child will jump in fright,
532.937	and with a very good reason, because there are
534.716	more than 10,000 children who are killed
537.273	by cars every year in the world.
540.742	We have had cities for 8,000 years,
543.35	and children could walk out of home and play.
547.686	In fact, only very recently,
549.978	towards 1900, there were no cars.
551.812	Cars have been here for really
551.812	less than 100 years.
555.813	They completely changed cities.
558.587	In 1900, for example,
560.535	nobody was killed by cars in the United States.
564.421	Only 20 years later,
566.336	between 1920 and 1930,
569.731	almost 200,000 people
572.089	were killed by cars in the United States.
574.599	Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children
578.63	were killed by cars in the United States.
582.582	So we could make different cities,
586.585	cities that will give more priority to human beings
589.346	than to cars, that will give more public space
591.805	to human beings than to cars,
593.929	cities which show great respect
596.684	for those most vulnerable citizens,
598.845	such as children or the elderly.
600.629	I will propose to you a couple of ingredients
604.434	which I think would make cities much better,
607.776	and it would be very simple to implement them
610.261	in the new cities which are only being created.
613.185	Hundreds of kilometers of greenways
616.238	criss-crossing cities in all directions.
619.388	Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.
622.132	They could go for dozens of kilometers safely
625.093	without any risk in wonderful greenways,
628.147	sort of bicycle highways,
630.563	and I would invite you to imagine the following:
633.668	a city in which every other street would be
636.906	a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.
641.992	In new cities which are going to be built,
644.223	this would not be particularly difficult.
646.768	When I was mayor of Bogotá,
650.295	in only three years, we were able to create
654.963	in one of the most dense cities in the world,
657.459	of these bicycle highways.
659.826	And this changes the way people live,
663.216	move, enjoy the city.
665.888	In this picture, you see in one
665.888	of the very poor neighborhoods,
668.509	we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,
671.579	and the cars still in the mud.
673.94	Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.
676.763	But what do we do first?
678.211	Ninety-nine percent of the people
678.211	in those neighborhoods don't have cars.
681.372	But you see, when a city is only being created,
683.845	it's very easy to incorporate
685.935	this kind of infrastructure.
688.111	Then the city grows around it.
690.809	And of course this is just a glimpse
693.852	of something which could be much better
696.647	if we just create it,
698.365	and it changes the way of life.
700.702	And the second ingredient,
700.702	which would solve mobility,
704.768	that very difficult challenge in developing countries,
707.346	in a very low-cost and simple way,
710.341	would be to have hundreds of kilometers
714.353	of streets only for buses,
716.875	buses and bicycles and pedestrians.
719.979	This would be, again, a very low-cost solution
723.018	if implemented from the start,
725.341	low cost, pleasant transit
727.864	with natural sunlight.
731.562	But unfortunately, reality is not as good
736.21	as my dreams.
737.962	Because of private property of land
741.144	and high land prices,
744.165	all developing country cities
744.165	have a large problem of slums.
747.202	In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes
750.112	in cities initially were illegal developments.
755.458	And of course it's very difficult to have
758.67	mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.
762.626	But even legal developments
764.672	have also been located in the wrong places,
767.644	very far from the city centers
770.445	where it's impossible to provide
772.482	low-cost, high-frequency public transport.
776.313	As a Latin American, and Latin America
779.193	was the most recently organized region in the world,
782.62	I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,
787.78	to those countries which are yet to urbanize --
791.89	Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950
796.911	to 80 percent urban in 2010 --
802.984	I would recommend Asian and African countries
806.144	which are yet to urbanize,
807.926	such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,
812.093	that governments should acquire
812.093	all land around cities.
815.068	In this way, their cities could grow in the right places
817.589	with the right spaces, with the parks,
819.364	with the greenways, with the busways.
822.74	The cities we are going to build
824.255	over the next 50 years
826.095	will determine quality of life and even happiness
828.492	for billions of people towards the future.
830.646	What a fantastic opportunity for leaders
834.224	and many young leaders to come,
836.466	especially in the developing countries.
838.533	They can create a much happier life
840.38	for billions towards the future.
841.949	I am sure, I am optimistic,
843.912	that they will make cities better
845.82	than our most ambitious dreams.
848.989	(Applause)
