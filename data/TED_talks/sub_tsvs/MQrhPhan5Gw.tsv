13.116	What stands between Africa's current
13.116	prostrate condition
17.251	and a future of prosperity and abundance
17.251	for its long-suffering populations?
22.912	One word:
24.725	knowledge.
26.798	If Africa is to become a continent
26.798	that offers the best life for humans,
31.34	it must become a knowledge society
34.322	immediately.
35.994	This is what I have called
35.994	"""Africa's knowledge imperative."""
41.923	Our universities must reduce emphasis
41.923	on producing manpower
45.778	for running our civil society,
48.333	our economy
50.123	and our political institutions.
53.148	They should be dedicated mainly
53.148	to knowledge production.
58.114	What sense is there
58.114	in producing civil engineers
62.068	who are not supported
62.068	by soil scientists and geologists,
65.719	who make it their business
65.719	to create knowledge about our soil
70.031	and our rocks?
72.417	What use is there in producing lawyers
75.66	without juries who produce knowledge
80.447	of the underlying philosophical
80.447	foundations of the legal system?
85.642	We must seek knowledge.
88.466	We must approach the matter of knowledge
91.556	with a maniacal commitment,
94.445	without let or hindrance.
97.48	Though we must seek knowledge
97.48	to solve problems we know of,
101.86	we must also seek knowledge
104.14	when there is no problem in view --
106.849	especially when there
106.849	is no problem in view.
111.263	We must seek to know as much
111.263	of what there is to know of all things,
116.439	limited only by the insufficiency
116.439	of our human nature,
120.742	and not only when the need arises.
124.534	Those who do not seek knowledge
124.534	when it is not needed
129.561	will not have it when they must have it.
134.777	The biggest crisis in Africa today
134.777	is the crisis of knowledge:
138.896	how to produce it,
140.94	how to manage it,
142.595	and how to deploy it effectively.
146.421	For instance, Africa does not
146.421	have a water crisis.
151.284	It has a knowledge crisis
151.284	regarding its water,
155.251	where and what types it is,
157.762	how it can be tapped and made available
157.762	where and when needed to all and sundry.
165.144	How does a continent that is home
167.827	to some of the largest
167.827	bodies of water in the world --
171.708	the Nile,
173.587	the Niger,
175.291	the Congo,
176.7	the Zambezi
178.274	and the Orange Rivers --
180.553	be said to have a water crisis,
183.02	including in countries
185.091	where those rivers are?
188.387	And that is only surface water.
191.045	While we wrongly dissipate our energies
191.045	fighting the wrong crises,
195.03	all those who invest in knowledge about us
197.736	are busy figuring out
197.736	how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers
203.458	to quench Europe's thirst.
206.811	Such is our knowledge
206.811	of our water resources
209.208	that many of our countries have given up
211.364	on making potable water a routine presence
214.125	in the lives of Africans,
215.908	rich or poor,
217.587	high and low,
219.066	rural and urban.
221.252	We eagerly accept
221.252	what the merchants of misery
224.746	and the global African Studies
224.746	safari professoriat
228.293	and their aid-addled,
230.273	autonomy-fearing African minions
233.146	in government, universities
233.146	and civil society
236.408	tell us regarding how nature
236.408	has been to stinting towards Africa
240.568	when it comes to the distribution
240.568	of water resources in the world.
244.947	We are content to run our cities
244.947	and rural dwellings alike
248.727	on boreholes.
252.213	How does one run metropolises
252.213	on boreholes and wells?
259.055	Does Africa have a food crisis?
261.861	Again, the answer is no.
265.429	It is yet another knowledge crisis
265.429	regarding Africa's agricultural resources,
270.68	what and where they are,
272.724	and how they can be best managed
272.724	to make Africans live more lives
277.261	that are worth living.
279.907	Otherwise, how does one explain the fact
282.279	that geography puts the source
282.279	of the River Nile in Ethiopia,
286.572	and its people cannot
286.572	have water for their lives?
290.736	And the same geography
290.736	puts California in the desert,
294.641	but it is a breadbasket.
297.578	The difference, obviously,
297.578	is not geography.
301.413	It is knowledge.
303.686	Colorado's aquifers
305.702	grow California's pistachios.
308.9	Why can't Libya's aquifers
311.102	grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?
314.882	Why does Nigeria not aspire
317.739	to feed the world,
319.866	not just itself?
321.797	If Africa's land is so poor,
321.797	as we are often told,
325.652	why are outsiders,
327.884	from the United Arab Emirates
327.884	all the way to South Korea,
332.073	buying up vast acreages of our land,
335.349	to grow food, no less,
337.541	to feed their people
339.262	in lands that are truly more
339.262	geographically stinting?
343.958	The new landowners are not planning
343.958	to import new topsoil
347.32	to make their African
347.32	acquisitions more arable.
350.246	Again, a singular instance
350.246	of knowledge deficiency.
356.99	In the 19th century,
359.43	our predecessors,
360.914	just years removed from the ravages
360.914	of slavery and the slave trade,
365.837	were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers
369.052	with a view to turning Africa's resources
369.052	to the advantage of its people
373.125	and to the rest of humanity,
375.513	and their 20th-century successors
375.513	were dreaming of harnessing
379.64	the powers of the River Congo
381.872	to light up the whole continent.
384.642	Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe
388.102	are scheming of doing the same,
390.502	but for exports to Europe
390.502	and South Africa.
394.736	And they are even suggesting
396.404	that Congolese may not
396.404	benefit from this scheme,
399.014	because, according to them,
399.014	Congolese communities are too small
403.029	to make providing them with electricity
406.123	a viable concern.
410.174	The solution?
411.977	Africa must become a knowledge society,
414.945	a defining characteristic
414.945	of the modern age.
418.866	We neither are, nor are we
418.866	on the path to becoming,
424.199	a knowledge society.
427.01	Things have not always been this way
430.696	when it comes to knowledge
430.696	production and Africa.
433.655	In antiquity, the world went to Africa
433.655	for intellectual enrichment.
439.339	There were celebrated centers of learning,
442.482	attracting questers from all parts
442.482	of the then-known world,
446.586	seeking knowledge about that world.
449.804	What happened then
449.804	has implications for our present.
453.968	For example,
455.81	how Roman Africa managed the relationship
455.81	between settlers and natives
462.5	between the second and fourth
462.5	centuries of our era
466.116	might have something to teach us
466.116	when it comes to confronting
469.132	not-too-dissimilar problems
469.132	at the present time.
473.345	But how many classics departments
473.345	do we have in our universities?
478.423	Because we do not invest in knowledge,
480.97	people come to Africa now
483.051	not as a place of intellectual enrichment,
486.171	but as a place where they sate
486.171	their thirst for exotica.
492.538	Yet for the last half-millennium,
495.544	Africa has been hemorrhaging
495.544	and exporting knowledge
499.057	to the rest of the world.
501.273	Regardless of the popular description
501.273	of it as a trade in bodies,
505.986	the European trans-Atlantic
505.986	slave trade and slavery
509.787	was one of the most radical
509.787	and longest programs
513.232	of African brains export in history.
516.831	American slave owners may have pretended
516.831	that Africans were mere brutes,
521.929	beasts of burden,
523.597	almost as inert and dumb
523.597	as other farm implements
527.566	they classified them with
527.566	in their ledgers.
531.052	And that's what they did.
533.099	The enslaved Africans, on the other hand,
535.563	knew their were embodiments of knowledge.
538.659	They were smiths, they were poets,
541.223	they were political counselors,
541.223	they were princes and princesses,
544.57	they were mythologists,
544.57	they were herbologists,
549.689	they were chefs.
551.206	The list is endless.
553.367	They, to take a single example,
555.885	brought the knowledge of rice cultivation
558.905	to the American South.
562.101	They created some of the most
562.101	original civilizational elements
566.6	for which the United States
566.6	is now celebrated.
570.237	They deployed their knowledge,
570.237	for the most part,
573.361	without compensation.
575.867	For the last half-millennium,
575.867	beginning with the slave trade,
579.399	Africa has been exporting brains
582.069	while simultaneously breaking
582.069	the chains of knowledge transmission
586.815	on the continent itself,
588.569	with dire consequences for the systems
588.569	of knowledge production in Africa.
593.664	Successive generations are cut off
593.664	from the intellectual production
598.258	of their predecessors.
600.363	We keep producing for external markets
603.43	while beggaring our own internal needs.
607.411	At present,
608.763	much of the best knowledge about Africa
611.39	is neither produced nor housed there,
614.722	even when it is produced by Africans.
618.634	Because we are dominated
618.634	by immediate needs
621.119	and relevant solutions when it comes
621.119	to what we should know,
624.65	we are happy to hand over to others
627.199	the responsibility to produce knowledge,
629.683	including knowledge about, of and for us,
633.985	and to do so far away from us.
636.853	We are ever eager to consume knowledge
640.02	and have but a mere portion of it
642.443	without any anxiety about
642.443	ownership and location.
647.707	African universities
647.707	are now all too content
651.334	to have e-connections
651.334	with libraries elsewhere,
654.884	having given up ambitions
654.884	on building libraries
657.782	to which the world would come
657.782	for intellectual edification.
662.411	Control over who decides
662.411	what should be stocked on our shelves
666.633	and how access to collections
666.633	should be determined
670.297	are made to rest on our trust
670.297	in our partners' good faith
674.152	that they will not abandon us
674.152	down the road.
677.981	This must change.
681.093	Africa must become
681.093	a place of knowledge again.
685.433	Knowledge production
685.433	actually expands the economy.
691.262	Take archaeological digs, for instance,
694.361	and their impact on tourism.
697.527	Our desires to unearth our antiquity,
700.931	especially those remote times
700.931	of which we have no written records,
705.728	requires investment in archaeology
705.728	and related disciplines,
710.766	e.g., paleoanthropology.
713.715	Yet, although it is our past
713.715	we seek to know,
717.557	by sheer serendipity,
719.935	archaeology may shed light
719.935	on the global human experience
723.824	and yield economic payoffs
726.011	that were no part
726.011	of the original reasons for digging.
730.969	We must find a way to make knowledge
730.969	and its production sexy and rewarding;
737.985	rewarding, not in the crass
737.985	sense of moneymaking
741.6	but in terms of making it worthwhile
741.6	to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,
747.101	support the existence
748.519	of knowledge-producing
748.519	groups and intellectuals,
751.72	ensuring that the continent
755.499	becomes the immediate locus
755.499	of knowledge production,
758.729	distribution and consumption,
761.385	and that instead of having
761.385	its depositories
763.904	beyond Africa's boundaries,
765.921	people once more come
765.921	from the rest of the world,
769.706	even if in virtual space,
769.706	to learn from us.
774.037	All this we do as custodians
774.037	on behalf of common humanity.
782.157	Creating a knowledge society in Africa,
785.501	for me, would be one way to celebrate
785.501	and simultaneously enhance diversity
791.454	by infinitely enriching it with material
791.454	and additional artifacts --
796.887	artifacts that we furnish
799.02	by our strivings
801.019	in the knowledge field.
803.047	Thank you very much.
804.477	(Applause)
