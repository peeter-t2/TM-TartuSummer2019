25.031	This is really a two-hour presentation
25.031	I give to high school students,
28.345	cut down to three minutes.
29.62	And it all started one day
29.62	on a plane, on my way to TED,
32.285	seven years ago.
33.603	And in the seat next to me
33.603	was a high school student, a teenager,
38	and she came from a really poor family.
40.483	And she wanted to make
40.483	something of her life,
43	and she asked me a simple little question.
45.063	"She said, ""What leads to success?"""
47.032	And I felt really badly,
48.435	because I couldn't give her a good answer.
50.92	So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
53	And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle
53	of a room of successful people!
56.754	So why don't I ask them
56.754	what helped them succeed,
59.389	and pass it on to kids?
61.817	So here we are, seven years,
65.45	and I'm going to tell you
65.45	what really leads to success
68.414	and makes TEDsters tick.
70.367	And the first thing is passion.
72.787	Freeman Thomas says,
72.787	"""I'm driven by my passion."""
75.763	TEDsters do it for love;
75.763	they don't do it for money.
78.247	"Carol Coletta says, ""I would pay"
78.247	"someone to do what I do."""
81.755	And the interesting thing is:
83.19	if you do it for love,
83.19	the money comes anyway.
85.866	Work! Rupert Murdoch said
85.866	"to me, ""It's all hard work."
89	Nothing comes easily.
89	"But I have a lot of fun."""
92.107	Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
95.001	(Laughter)
96.501	TEDsters do have fun working.
96.501	And they work hard.
99.271	I figured, they're not workaholics.
99.271	They're workafrolics.
102.248	(Laughter)
103.862	Good!
104.943	(Applause)
105.968	"Alex Garden says, ""To be successful,"
105.968	put your nose down in something
109.338	"and get damn good at it."""
110.608	There's no magic;
110.608	it's practice, practice, practice.
113.474	And it's focus.
114.517	Norman Jewison said to me,
116.275	"""I think it all has to do"
116.275	"with focusing yourself on one thing."""
119.773	And push!
121.235	"David Gallo says, ""Push yourself."
123.247	Physically, mentally,
123.247	"you've got to push, push, push."""
125.913	You've got to push through shyness
125.913	and self-doubt.
128.548	Goldie Hawn says,
128.548	"""I always had self-doubts."
131	I wasn't good enough;
131	I wasn't smart enough.
133.12	"I didn't think I'd make it."""
135.264	Now it's not always easy to push yourself,
137.327	and that's why they invented mothers.
139.439	(Laughter)
140.439	(Applause)
142	Frank Gehry said to me,
145	"""My mother pushed me."""
146.394	(Laughter)
147.632	Serve!
149.427	Sherwin Nuland says,
149.427	"""It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."""
153.093	A lot of kids want to be millionaires.
155.227	The first thing I say is:
156.501	"""OK, well you can't serve yourself;"
158.427	you've got to serve others
158.427	something of value.
160.688	Because that's the way
160.688	"people really get rich."""
164.074	Ideas!
165.123	"TEDster Bill Gates says, ""I had an idea:"
168	founding the first micro-computer
168	"software company."""
171	I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
173	And there's no magic to creativity
173	in coming up with ideas --
176	it's just doing some very simple things.
178.359	And I give lots of evidence.
180.291	Persist!
181.799	Joe Kraus says,
182.824	"""Persistence is the number"
182.824	"one reason for our success."""
185.832	You've got to persist through failure.
185.832	You've got to persist through crap!
189.398	"Which of course means ""Criticism,"
189.398	"Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."""
192.937	(Laughter)
195.727	So, the answer to this question is simple:
199.47	Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
201.619	(Laughter)
202.836	Or failing that, do
202.836	the eight things -- and trust me,
205.598	these are the big eight things
205.598	that lead to success.
208.842	Thank you TEDsters
208.842	for all your interviews!
211.585	(Applause)
