12.724	I used to think
14.027	the whole purpose of life
14.027	was pursuing happiness.
18.5	Everyone said the path
18.5	to happiness was success,
21.908	so I searched for that ideal job,
24.43	that perfect boyfriend,
24.43	that beautiful apartment.
28.818	But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,
31.84	I felt anxious and adrift.
35.015	And I wasn't alone; my friends --
35.015	they struggled with this, too.
40.54	Eventually, I decided to go
40.54	to graduate school for positive psychology
44.833	to learn what truly makes people happy.
48.791	But what I discovered there
48.791	changed my life.
52.272	The data showed that chasing happiness
52.272	can make people unhappy.
57.787	And what really struck me was this:
60.878	the suicide rate has been rising
60.878	around the world,
63.689	and it recently reached
63.689	a 30-year high in America.
67.573	Even though life is getting
67.573	objectively better
70.36	by nearly every conceivable standard,
73.074	more people feel hopeless,
75.297	depressed and alone.
78.034	There's an emptiness
78.034	gnawing away at people,
80.871	and you don't have to be
80.871	clinically depressed to feel it.
84.165	Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:
87.604	Is this all there is?
90.987	And according to the research,
90.987	what predicts this despair
94.217	is not a lack of happiness.
96.068	It's a lack of something else,
98.637	a lack of having meaning in life.
102.782	But that raised some questions for me.
105.675	Is there more to life than being happy?
109.036	And what's the difference
109.036	between being happy
111.483	and having meaning in life?
114.699	Many psychologists define happiness
114.699	as a state of comfort and ease,
119.323	feeling good in the moment.
121.918	Meaning, though, is deeper.
124.098	The renowned psychologist
124.098	Martin Seligman says
126.686	meaning comes from belonging to
126.686	and serving something beyond yourself
131.357	and from developing the best within you.
135.437	Our culture is obsessed with happiness,
138.056	but I came to see that seeking meaning
138.056	is the more fulfilling path.
142.187	And the studies show that people
142.187	who have meaning in life,
145.14	they're more resilient,
146.574	they do better in school and at work,
149.155	and they even live longer.
151.805	So this all made me wonder:
153.85	How can we each live more meaningfully?
157.8	To find out, I spent five years
157.8	interviewing hundreds of people
161.502	and reading through thousands
161.502	of pages of psychology,
164.427	neuroscience and philosophy.
167.186	Bringing it all together,
168.999	I found that there are what I call
168.999	four pillars of a meaningful life.
174.364	And we can each create lives of meaning
176.822	by building some or all
176.822	of these pillars in our lives.
181.248	The first pillar is belonging.
184.198	Belonging comes
184.198	from being in relationships
186.529	where you're valued
186.529	for who you are intrinsically
189.258	and where you value others as well.
192.038	But some groups and relationships
192.038	deliver a cheap form of belonging;
196.752	you're valued for what you believe,
198.669	for who you hate,
199.939	not for who you are.
202.24	True belonging springs from love.
205.047	It lives in moments among individuals,
208.056	and it's a choice -- you can choose
208.056	to cultivate belonging with others.
212.481	Here's an example.
214.112	Each morning, my friend Jonathan
214.112	buys a newspaper
217.691	from the same street vendor in New York.
220.322	They don't just conduct
220.322	a transaction, though.
222.626	They take a moment to slow down, talk,
225.333	and treat each other like humans.
227.858	But one time, Jonathan
227.858	didn't have the right change,
231.276	and the vendor said,
232.52	"""Don't worry about it."""
234.064	But Jonathan insisted on paying,
236.575	so he went to the store
236.575	and bought something he didn't need
239.611	to make change.
241.812	But when he gave the money to the vendor,
244.459	the vendor drew back.
246.64	He was hurt.
248.535	He was trying to do something kind,
250.408	but Jonathan had rejected him.
253.933	I think we all reject people in small ways
253.933	like this without realizing it.
258.108	I do.
259.33	I'll walk by someone I know
259.33	and barely acknowledge them.
262.417	I'll check my phone
262.417	when someone's talking to me.
265.498	These acts devalue others.
267.451	They make them feel
267.451	invisible and unworthy.
270.95	But when you lead with love,
270.95	you create a bond
273.726	that lifts each of you up.
276.85	For many people, belonging
276.85	is the most essential source of meaning,
280.502	those bonds to family and friends.
282.996	For others, the key to meaning
282.996	is the second pillar: purpose.
287.664	Now, finding your purpose
287.664	is not the same thing
290.603	as finding that job that makes you happy.
293.34	Purpose is less about what you want
293.34	than about what you give.
296.823	A hospital custodian told me
296.823	her purpose is healing sick people.
301.335	Many parents tell me,
303.07	"""My purpose is raising my children."""
305.347	The key to purpose
305.347	is using your strengths to serve others.
310.201	Of course, for many of us,
310.201	that happens through work.
313.733	That's how we contribute and feel needed.
316.736	But that also means
316.736	that issues like disengagement at work,
320.62	unemployment,
322.057	low labor force participation --
324.308	these aren't just economic problems,
324.308	they're existential ones, too.
328.641	Without something worthwhile to do,
330.878	people flounder.
333.313	Of course, you don't have to find
333.313	purpose at work,
335.953	but purpose gives you
335.953	something to live for,
338.706	"some ""why"" that drives you forward."
342.967	The third pillar of meaning
342.967	is also about stepping beyond yourself,
346.291	but in a completely different way:
348.157	transcendence.
349.768	Transcendent states are those rare moments
352.169	when you're lifted above
352.169	the hustle and bustle of daily life,
355.605	your sense of self fades away,
357.334	and you feel connected
357.334	to a higher reality.
361.034	For one person I talked to,
361.034	transcendence came from seeing art.
364.748	For another person, it was at church.
367.302	For me, I'm a writer,
367.302	and it happens through writing.
370.88	Sometimes I get so in the zone
370.88	that I lose all sense of time and place.
376.577	These transcendent
376.577	experiences can change you.
379.747	One study had students look up
379.747	at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees
384.295	for one minute.
386.083	But afterwards
386.083	they felt less self-centered,
388.261	and they even behaved more generously
390.229	when given the chance to help someone.
393.402	Belonging, purpose, transcendence.
398.194	Now, the fourth pillar
398.194	of meaning, I've found,
400.941	tends to surprise people.
403.186	The fourth pillar is storytelling,
405.944	the story you tell yourself
405.944	about yourself.
409.436	Creating a narrative from the events
409.436	of your life brings clarity.
413.604	It helps you understand
413.604	how you became you.
417.489	But we don't always realize
417.489	that we're the authors of our stories
420.609	and can change the way we're telling them.
422.796	Your life isn't just a list of events.
425.311	You can edit, interpret
425.311	and retell your story,
428.551	even as you're constrained by the facts.
431.501	I met a young man named Emeka,
431.501	who'd been paralyzed playing football.
436.74	After his injury, Emeka told himself,
439.223	"""My life was great playing football,"
441.952	"but now look at me."""
445.822	People who tell stories like this --
448.138	"""My life was good. Now it's bad."" --"
450.686	tend to be more anxious and depressed.
453.532	And that was Emeka for a while.
456.393	But with time, he started
456.393	to weave a different story.
460.235	His new story was,
461.992	"""Before my injury,"
461.992	my life was purposeless.
465.283	I partied a lot and was
465.283	a pretty selfish guy.
468.56	But my injury made me realize
468.56	"I could be a better man."""
473.308	That edit to his story
473.308	changed Emeka's life.
476.873	After telling the new story to himself,
479.328	Emeka started mentoring kids,
481.274	and he discovered what his purpose was:
483.664	serving others.
485.921	The psychologist Dan McAdams
485.921	"calls this a ""redemptive story,"""
489.323	where the bad is redeemed by the good.
492.447	People leading meaningful
492.447	lives, he's found,
494.654	tend to tell stories about their lives
496.609	defined by redemption, growth and love.
500.543	But what makes people
500.543	change their stories?
503.545	Some people get help from a therapist,
505.497	but you can do it on your own, too,
507.331	just by reflecting
507.331	on your life thoughtfully,
510.115	how your defining experiences shaped you,
512.226	what you lost, what you gained.
514.409	That's what Emeka did.
516.832	You won't change your story overnight;
518.902	it could take years and be painful.
521.271	After all, we've all suffered,
521.271	and we all struggle.
524.777	But embracing those painful memories
524.777	can lead to new insights and wisdom,
529.14	to finding that good that sustains you.
534.404	Belonging, purpose,
534.404	transcendence, storytelling:
539.683	those are the four pillars of meaning.
543.446	When I was younger,
545.076	I was lucky enough to be surrounded
545.076	by all of the pillars.
549.201	My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
549.201	from our home in Montreal.
554.506	Sufism is a spiritual practice
554.506	associated with the whirling dervishes
559.013	and the poet Rumi.
561.25	Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home
563.849	to meditate, drink Persian tea,
563.849	and share stories.
568.029	Their practice also involved
568.029	serving all of creation
571.01	through small acts of love,
572.844	which meant being kind
572.844	even when people wronged you.
576.209	But it gave them a purpose:
576.209	to rein in the ego.
580.732	Eventually, I left home for college
583.372	and without the daily grounding
583.372	of Sufism in my life,
587.098	I felt unmoored.
588.71	And I started searching for those things
588.71	that make life worth living.
592.322	That's what set me on this journey.
594.832	Looking back, I now realize
596.613	that the Sufi house
596.613	had a real culture of meaning.
599.879	The pillars were part of the architecture,
602.409	and the presence of the pillars
602.409	helped us all live more deeply.
606.234	Of course, the same principle applies
608.579	in other strong communities as well --
610.804	good ones and bad ones.
613.376	Gangs, cults:
615.429	these are cultures of meaning
615.429	that use the pillars
618.466	and give people
618.466	something to live and die for.
621.868	But that's exactly why we as a society
624.759	must offer better alternatives.
626.892	We need to build these pillars
626.892	within our families and our institutions
630.667	to help people become their best selves.
634.344	But living a meaningful life takes work.
636.954	It's an ongoing process.
638.853	As each day goes by,
638.853	we're constantly creating our lives,
642.606	adding to our story.
644.651	And sometimes we can get off track.
648.182	Whenever that happens to me,
650.117	I remember a powerful experience
650.117	I had with my father.
655.641	Several months after
655.641	I graduated from college,
658.312	my dad had a massive heart attack
658.312	that should have killed him.
662.853	He survived, and when I asked him
662.853	what was going through his mind
666.091	as he faced death,
667.737	he said all he could think about
667.737	was needing to live
670.444	so he could be there
670.444	for my brother and me,
672.606	and this gave him the will
672.606	to fight for life.
675.883	When he went under anesthesia
675.883	for emergency surgery,
679.205	instead of counting backwards from 10,
681.559	he repeated our names like a mantra.
685.61	He wanted our names to be
685.61	the last words he spoke on earth
689.445	if he died.
692.853	My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.
697.005	It's a humble life,
698.576	but a good life.
700.384	Lying there facing death,
700.384	he had a reason to live:
704.32	love.
705.752	His sense of belonging within his family,
708.227	his purpose as a dad,
709.98	his transcendent meditation,
709.98	repeating our names --
713.018	these, he says, are the reasons
713.018	why he survived.
715.823	That's the story he tells himself.
719.567	That's the power of meaning.
722.463	Happiness comes and goes.
725.279	But when life is really good
727.152	and when things are really bad,
729.061	having meaning gives you
729.061	something to hold on to.
732.142	Thank you.
733.39	(Applause)
