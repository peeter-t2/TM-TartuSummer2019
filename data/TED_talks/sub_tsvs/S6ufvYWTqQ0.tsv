12.3	So I would like to start by telling you
12.3	about one of my greatest friends,
17.02	Okoloma Maduewesi.
19.54	Okoloma lived on my street
21.18	and looked after me like a big brother.
23.5	If I liked a boy,
23.5	I would ask Okoloma's opinion.
27.98	Okoloma died in the notorious
27.98	Sosoliso plane crash
31.86	in Nigeria in December of 2005.
34.82	Almost exactly seven years ago.
37.9	Okoloma was a person I could argue with,
37.9	laugh with and truly talk to.
43.5	He was also the first person
43.5	to call me a feminist.
47.34	I was about fourteen,
47.34	we were at his house, arguing.
50.78	Both of us bristling
50.78	with half bit knowledge
53.3	from books that we had read.
55.38	I don't remember what this
55.38	particular argument was about,
59.14	but I remember
59.14	that as I argued and argued,
61.22	Okoloma looked at me and said,
61.22	"""You know, you're a feminist."""
65.7	It was not a compliment.
66.94	(Laughter)
68.38	I could tell from his tone,
69.74	the same tone that you would use
69.74	to say something like,
72.54	"""You're a supporter of terrorism."""
74.3	(Laughter)
77.1	I did not know exactly
77.1	"what this word ""feminist"" meant,"
80.78	and I did not want Okoloma
80.78	to know that I did not know.
84.02	So I brushed it aside,
84.02	and I continued to argue.
87.06	And the first thing
87.06	I planned to do when I got home
89.5	was to look up the word
89.5	"""feminist"" in the dictionary."
92.1	Now fast forward to some years later,
95.26	I wrote a novel about a man
95.26	who among other things beats his wife
99.42	and whose story doesn't end very well.
102.42	While I was promoting
102.42	the novel in Nigeria,
104.5	a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,
107.54	told me he wanted to advise me.
111.1	And for the Nigerians here,
112.46	I'm sure we're all familiar
113.98	with how quick our people are
113.98	to give unsolicited advice.
121.58	He told me that people were saying
121.58	that my novel was feminist
125.06	and his advice to me --
126.7	and he was shaking his head
126.7	sadly as he spoke --
129.9	was that I should never
129.9	call myself a feminist
132.1	because feminists
132.1	are women who are unhappy
134.7	because they cannot find husbands.
136.66	(Laughter)
141.1	So I decided to call myself
141.1	"""a happy feminist."""
144.86	Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me
147.54	that feminism was not our culture
149.26	and that feminism wasn't African,
150.9	and that I was calling myself a feminist
152.86	because I had been corrupted
152.86	"by ""Western books."""
155.94	Which amused me,
157.18	because a lot of my early readings
157.18	were decidedly unfeminist.
160.54	I think I must have read every single
160.54	Mills &amp; Boon romance published
163.78	before I was sixteen.
165.78	And each time I tried to read those books
167.78	"called ""the feminist classics,"""
169.62	I'd get bored, and I really
169.62	struggled to finish them.
172.42	But anyway, since feminism was un-African,
175.18	I decided that I would now call myself
175.18	"""a happy African feminist."""
179.66	At some point I was a happy African
179.66	feminist who does not hate men
184.1	and who likes lip gloss
185.46	and who wears high heels
185.46	for herself but not for men.
187.98	(Laughter)
189.74	Of course a lot of this
189.74	was tongue-in-cheek,
191.94	but that word feminist is so heavy
191.94	with baggage, negative baggage.
196.58	You hate men, you hate bras,
198.94	you hate African culture,
198.94	that sort of thing.
202.06	Now here's a story from my childhood.
204.82	When I was in primary school,
206.62	my teacher said at the beginning of term
206.62	that she would give the class a test
211.18	and whoever got the highest score
211.18	would be the class monitor.
214.14	Now, class monitor was a big deal.
217.06	If you were a class monitor,
218.82	you got to write down
218.82	the names of noisemakers --
221.3	(Laughter)
222.98	which was having enough power of its own.
226.3	But my teacher would also give you
226.3	a cane to hold in your hand
231.1	while you walk around
231.1	and patrol the class for noisemakers.
235.18	Now, of course you were not
235.18	actually allowed to use the cane.
238.74	But it was an exciting prospect
238.74	for the nine-year-old me.
242.18	I very much wanted
242.18	to be the class monitor.
244.98	And I got the highest score on the test.
247.62	Then, to my surprise, my teacher said
247.62	that the monitor had to be a boy.
252.06	She had forgotten
252.06	to make that clear earlier
254.18	because she assumed it was ... obvious.
256.062	(Laughter)
258.14	A boy had the second highest
258.14	score on the test,
260.94	and he would be monitor.
263.78	Now, what was even more
263.78	interesting about this
265.98	is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul
269.82	who had no interest
269.82	in patrolling the class with the cane,
273.94	while I was full of ambition to do so.
278.38	But I was female and he was male,
280.5	and so he became the class monitor.
283.06	And I've never forgotten that incident.
285.98	I often make the mistake of thinking
287.9	that something that is obvious to me
287.9	is just as obvious to everyone else.
291.38	Now, take my dear friend Louis
292.98	for example.
294.34	Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,
296.22	and we would have conversations
296.22	and he would tell me,
298.74	"""I don't know what you mean by things"
298.74	being different or harder for women.
302.78	"Maybe in the past, but not now."""
305.38	And I didn't understand how Louis
305.38	could not see what seems so self-evident.
309.98	Then one evening, in Lagos,
309.98	Louis and I went out with friends.
314.14	And for people here
314.14	who are not familiar with Lagos,
316.62	there's that wonderful Lagos' fixture,
318.54	the sprinkling of energetic men
318.54	who hang around outside establishments
323.22	and very dramatically
323.22	"""help"" you park your car."
327.82	I was impressed
327.82	with the particular theatrics
331.14	of the man who found us
331.14	a parking spot that evening.
334.14	And so as we were leaving,
334.14	I decided to leave him a tip.
338.58	I opened my bag,
340.02	put my hand inside my bag,
341.42	brought out my money
341.42	that I had earned from doing my work,
344.98	and I gave it to the man.
347.42	And he, this man who was
347.42	very grateful and very happy,
351.82	took the money from me,
353.62	looked across at Louis
355.06	"and said, ""Thank you, sir!"""
356.94	(Laughter)
362.98	Louis looked at me, surprised,
366.26	"and asked, ""Why is he thanking me?"
366.26	"I didn't give him the money."""
370.66	Then I saw realization
370.66	dawn on Louis' face.
374.86	The man believed that whatever money I had
377.3	had ultimately come from Louis.
381.54	Because Louis is a man.
384.42	Men and women are different.
386.26	We have different hormones,
386.26	we have different sexual organs,
389.14	we have different biological abilities.
391.22	Women can have babies, men can't.
394.62	At least not yet.
395.86	(Laughter)
397.3	Men have testosterone and are
397.3	in general physically stronger than women.
402.34	There's slightly more women
402.34	than men in the world,
405.02	about 52 percent of the world's
405.02	population is female.
408.14	But most of the positions of power
408.14	and prestige are occupied by men.
412.66	The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,
415.14	Wangari Maathai,
416.5	put it simply and well when she said:
419.42	"""The higher you go,"
419.42	"the fewer women there are."""
423.74	In the recent US elections we kept hearing
423.74	of the Lilly Ledbetter law,
428.38	and if we go beyond the nicely
428.38	alliterative name of that law,
431.82	it was really about a man and a woman
433.98	doing the same job,
433.98	being equally qualified,
436.78	and the man being paid more
436.78	because he's a man.
439.98	So in the literal way, men rule the world,
443.34	and this made sense a thousand years ago
446.94	because human beings lived then in a world
449.82	in which physical strength was
449.82	the most important attribute for survival.
454.02	The physically stronger person
454.02	was more likely to lead,
459.1	and men, in general,
459.1	are physically stronger.
461.7	Of course there are many exceptions.
463.439	(Laughter)
465.02	But today we live
465.02	in a vastly different world.
469.54	The person more likely to lead
469.54	is not the physically stronger person;
473.62	it is the more creative person,
473.62	the more intelligent person,
477.14	the more innovative person,
479.58	and there are no hormones
479.58	for those attributes.
482.26	A man is as likely as a woman
482.26	to be intelligent,
484.9	to be creative, to be innovative.
487.62	We have evolved;
488.94	but it seems to me that our ideas
488.94	of gender had not evolved.
493.58	Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby
493.58	of one of the best Nigerian hotels.
498.1	I thought about naming the hotel,
498.1	but I thought I probably shouldn't.
501.38	And a guard at the entrance stopped me
501.38	and asked me annoying questions,
505.78	because their automatic assumption is
507.62	that a Nigerian female walking
507.62	into a hotel alone is a sex worker.
512.82	And by the way,
514.06	why do these hotels
514.06	focus on the ostensible supply
517.22	rather than the demand for sex workers?
521.34	In Lagos I cannot go alone
521.34	"into many ""reputable"" bars and clubs."
526.619	They just don't let you in
526.619	if you're a woman alone,
529.06	you have to be accompanied by a man.
531.42	Each time I walk into
531.42	a Nigerian restaurant with a man,
534.18	the waiter greets the man and ignores me.
538.14	The waiters are products --
539.66	(Laughter)
540.82	At this some women
540.82	"felt like, ""Yes! I thought that!"""
543.74	The waiters are products of a society
545.7	that has taught them that men
545.7	are more important than women.
550.06	And I know that waiters
550.06	don't intend any harm.
552.94	But it's one thing to know intellectually
552.94	and quite another to feel it emotionally.
557.26	Each time they ignore me,
557.26	I feel invisible.
559.66	I feel upset.
561.54	I want to tell them
561.54	that I am just as human as the man,
564.9	that I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.
568.58	These are little things,
569.86	but sometimes it's the little things
569.86	that sting the most.
573.14	And not long ago, I wrote an article
574.9	about what it means
574.9	to be young and female in Lagos,
578.22	and the printers told me,
580.94	"""It was so angry."""
582.78	Of course it was angry!
584.18	(Laughter)
588.66	I am angry.
590.34	Gender as it functions today
590.34	is a grave injustice.
593.5	We should all be angry.
595.26	Anger has a long history
595.26	of bringing about positive change;
599.14	but, in addition to being angry,
599.14	I'm also hopeful.
602.7	Because I believe deeply
602.7	in the ability of human beings
605.34	to make and remake
605.34	themselves for the better.
608.74	Gender matters everywhere in the world,
610.66	but I want to focus on Nigeria
613.34	and on Africa in general,
614.82	because it is where I know,
614.82	and because it is where my heart is.
618.42	And I would like today to ask
620.38	that we begin to dream about
620.38	and plan for a different world,
624.54	a fairer world,
628.06	a world of happier men and happier women
628.06	who are truer to themselves.
632.26	And this is how to start:
633.82	we must raise our daughters differently.
636.3	We must also raise our sons differently.
639.82	We do a great disservice to boys
639.82	on how we raise them;
643.5	we stifle the humanity of boys.
646.3	We define masculinity
646.3	in a very narrow way,
648.9	masculinity becomes this hard, small cage
652.42	and we put boys inside the cage.
654.74	We teach boys to be afraid of fear.
657.3	We teach boys to be afraid
657.3	of weakness, of vulnerability.
662.02	We teach them to mask their true selves,
664.5	because they have to be,
664.5	"in Nigerian speak, ""hard man!"""
670.26	In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
670.26	both of them teenagers,
674.42	both of them with the same amount
674.42	of pocket money, would go out
677.94	and then the boy
677.94	would be expected always to pay,
680.74	to prove his masculinity.
683.26	And yet we wonder why boys are more likely
683.26	to steal money from their parents.
689.06	What if both boys and girls were raised
692.58	not to link masculinity with money?
695.54	What if the attitude
695.54	"was not ""the boy has to pay"""
698.58	"but rather ""whoever has more should pay?"""
702.18	Now, of course because
702.18	of that historical advantage,
704.78	it is mostly men who will have more today,
707.26	but if we start
707.26	raising children differently,
709.9	then in fifty years, in a hundred years,
712.46	boys will no longer have the pressure
712.46	of having to prove this masculinity.
717.5	But by far the worst thing we do to males,
720.54	by making them feel
720.54	that they have to be hard,
722.9	is that we leave them
722.9	with very fragile egos.
726.94	"The more ""hard man"""
726.94	the man feels compelled to be,
731.14	the weaker his ego is.
734.78	And then we do a much greater
734.78	disservice to girls
737.82	because we raise them
737.82	to cater to the fragile egos of men.
742.02	We teach girls to shrink themselves,
742.02	to make themselves smaller,
745.54	we say to girls,
747.46	"""You can have ambition, but not too much."""
749.66	(Laughter)
751.06	"""You should aim to be successful,"
751.06	but not too successful,
753.78	"otherwise you would threaten the man."""
756.54	If you are the breadwinner
756.54	in your relationship with a man,
759.46	you have to pretend that you're not,
761.46	especially in public,
763.14	otherwise you will emasculate him.
766.54	But what if we question
766.54	the premise itself?
768.9	Why should a woman's success
768.9	be a threat to a man?
773.02	What if we decide
773.02	to simply dispose of that word,
776.58	and I don't think there's an English word
776.58	"I dislike more than ""emasculation."""
782.54	A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me
784.86	if I was worried that men
784.86	would be intimidated by me.
788.38	I was not worried at all.
790.14	In fact, it had not occurred
790.14	to me to be worried
792.42	because a man who would
792.42	be intimidated by me
794.66	is exactly the kind of man
794.66	I would have no interest in.
797.3	(Laughter)
798.54	(Applause)
805.94	But still I was really struck by this.
809.46	Because I'm female,
809.46	I'm expected to aspire to marriage;
813.78	I'm expected to make my life choices
815.58	always keeping in mind
815.58	that marriage is the most important.
819.86	A marriage can be a good thing;
821.86	it can be a source of joy
821.86	and love and mutual support.
826.3	But why do we teach girls
826.3	to aspire to marriage
828.78	and we don't teach boys the same?
832.66	I know a woman
832.66	who decided to sell her house
834.86	because she didn't want
834.86	to intimidate a man who might marry her.
839.7	I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria
839.7	who, when she goes to conferences,
844.18	wears a wedding ring
845.58	because according to her,
846.82	she wants the other participants
846.82	"in the conference to ""give her respect."""
851.94	I know young women
851.94	who are under so much pressure
854.3	from family, from friends,
854.3	even from work to get married,
858.42	and they're pushed
858.42	to make terrible choices.
861.34	A woman at a certain age who is unmarried,
863.98	our society teaches her
863.98	to see it as a deep, personal failure.
868.86	And a man at a certain age
868.86	who is unmarried,
871.66	we just think he hasn't come around
871.66	to making his pick.
874.3	(Laughter)
876.18	It's easy for us to say,
877.82	"""Oh, but women can"
877.82	"just say no to all of this."""
880.1	But the reality is more difficult
880.1	and more complex.
883.18	We're all social beings.
884.98	We internalize ideas
884.98	from our socialization.
887.5	Even the language we use
889.5	in talking about marriage
889.5	and relationships illustrates this.
892.94	The language of marriage
892.94	is often the language of ownership
895.82	rather than the language of partnership.
898.62	"We use the word ""respect"""
901.34	to mean something a woman shows a man
904.14	but often not something
904.14	a man shows a woman.
907.98	Both men and women in Nigeria will say --
910.46	this is an expression
910.46	I'm very amused by --
912.78	"""I did it for peace in my marriage."""
916.22	Now, when men say it,
917.82	it is usually about something
917.82	that they should not be doing anyway.
921.02	(Laughter)
922.98	Sometimes they say it to their friends,
925.78	it's something to say to their friends
925.78	in a kind of fondly exasperated way,
929.74	you know, something that ultimately
929.74	proves how masculine they are,
932.9	how needed, how loved.
934.38	"""Oh, my wife said"
934.38	I can't go to the club every night,
936.9	so for peace in my marriage,
936.9	"I do it only on weekends."""
939.74	(Laughter)
941.46	Now, when a woman says,
941.46	"""I did it for peace in my marriage,"""
945.74	she's usually talking
945.74	about giving up a job,
949.3	a dream,
950.78	a career.
952.9	We teach females that in relationships,
955.34	compromise is what women do.
958.9	We raise girls to see
958.9	each other as competitors --
961.5	not for jobs or for accomplishments,
961.5	which I think can be a good thing,
964.98	but for attention of men.
967.74	We teach girls that they
967.74	cannot be sexual beings
970.7	in the way that boys are.
972.22	If we have sons, we don't mind
972.22	knowing about our sons' girlfriends.
976.3	But our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.
978.66	(Laughter)
980.3	But of course when the time is right,
982.14	we expect those girls to bring back
982.14	the perfect man to be their husbands.
986.06	We police girls,
986.06	we praise girls for virginity,
989.46	but we don't praise boys for virginity,
991.42	and it's always made me wonder how exactly
991.42	this is supposed to work out because ...
995.349	(Laughter)
997.7	(Applause)
1005.58	I mean, the loss of virginity
1005.58	is usually a process that involves ...
1010.5	Recently a young woman
1010.5	was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,
1014.7	I think some of us know about that.
1016.42	And the response of many young Nigerians,
1016.42	both male and female,
1019.7	was something along the lines of this:
1022.22	"""Yes, rape is wrong."
1024.42	But what is a girl doing
1024.42	"in a room with four boys?"""
1028.74	Now, if we can forget
1028.74	the horrible inhumanity of that response,
1033.9	these Nigerians have been raised
1033.9	to think of women as inherently guilty,
1039.139	and they have been raised
1039.139	to expect so little of men
1042.3	that the idea of men as savage beings
1042.3	without any control
1046.02	is somehow acceptable.
1048.659	We teach girls shame.
1050.7	"""Close your legs."" ""Cover yourself."""
1053.26	We make them feel
1053.26	as though by being born female
1055.54	they're already guilty of something.
1057.659	And so, girls grow up to be women
1060.02	who cannot see they have desire.
1062.18	They grow up to be women
1062.18	who silence themselves.
1066.9	They grow up to be women
1066.9	who cannot say what they truly think,
1070.34	and they grow up --
1071.7	and this is the worst thing
1071.7	we did to girls --
1073.9	they grow up to be women
1073.9	who have turned pretense into an art form.
1078.06	(Applause)
1084.26	I know a woman who hates domestic work,
1087.7	she just hates it,
1089.22	but she pretends that she likes it,
1092.02	because she's been taught
1092.02	"that to be ""good wife material"""
1096.14	she has to be --
1096.14	to use that Nigerian word --
1098.54	"very ""homely."""
1101.26	And then she got married,
1102.82	and after a while her husband's family
1102.82	began to complain that she had changed.
1106.66	(Laughter)
1108.26	Actually, she had not changed,
1109.74	she just got tired of pretending.
1112.54	The problem with gender,
1115.7	is that it prescribes how we should be
1118.26	rather than recognizing how we are.
1121.22	Now imagine how much happier we would be,
1123.7	how much freer to be
1123.7	our true individual selves,
1127.22	if we didn't have the weight
1127.22	of gender expectations.
1131.06	Boys and girls are
1131.06	undeniably different biologically,
1135.86	but socialization
1135.86	exaggerates the differences
1138.86	and then it becomes
1138.86	a self-fulfilling process.
1141.46	Now, take cooking for example.
1144.1	Today women in general are more likely
1144.1	to do the housework than men,
1147.62	the cooking and cleaning.
1148.9	But why is that?
1150.5	Is it because women
1150.5	are born with a cooking gene?
1153.38	(Laughter)
1154.82	Or because over years they have been
1154.82	socialized to see cooking as their role?
1159.1	Actually, I was going to say that maybe
1159.1	women are born with a cooking gene,
1162.7	until I remember that the majority
1162.7	of the famous cooks in the world,
1166.18	"whom we give the fancy title of ""chefs,"""
1168.5	are men.
1170.78	I used to look up to my grandmother
1172.5	who was a brilliant, brilliant woman,
1174.58	and wonder how she would have been
1176.34	if she had the same opportunities
1176.34	as men when she was growing up.
1180.78	Now today, there are
1180.78	many more opportunities for women
1183.38	than there were
1183.38	during my grandmother's time
1185.66	because of changes in policy,
1185.66	changes in law,
1188.3	all of which are very important.
1189.9	But what matters even more
1189.9	is our attitude, our mindset,
1194.46	what we believe
1194.46	and what we value about gender.
1197.78	What if in raising children
1200.22	we focus on ability instead of gender?
1203.82	What if in raising children
1203.82	we focus on interest instead of gender?
1208.82	I know a family
1208.82	who have a son and a daughter,
1211.06	both of whom are brilliant at school,
1212.98	who are wonderful, lovely children.
1214.9	When the boy is hungry,
1214.9	the parents say to the girl,
1217.46	"""Go and cook Indomie noodles"
1217.46	"for your brother."""
1219.7	(Laughter)
1220.94	Now, the daughter doesn't
1220.94	particularly like to cook Indomie noodles,
1224.46	but she's a girl, and so she has to.
1227.26	Now, what if the parents,
1229.06	from the beginning,
1230.7	taught both the boy and the girl
1230.7	to cook Indomie?
1235.74	Cooking, by the way,
1235.74	is a very useful skill for boys to have.
1238.78	I've never thought it made sense
1238.78	to leave such a crucial thing,
1243.66	the ability to nourish oneself --
1245.58	(Laughter)
1246.82	in the hands of others.
1248.38	(Applause)
1253.58	I know a woman who has the same degree
1253.58	and the same job as her husband.
1257.46	When they get back from work,
1257.46	she does most of the housework,
1260.38	which I think is true for many marriages.
1262.58	But what struck me about them
1264.34	was that whenever her husband
1264.34	changed the baby's diaper,
1267.34	"she said ""thank you"" to him."
1270.86	Now, what if she saw this
1270.86	as perfectly normal and natural
1275.3	that he should, in fact,
1275.3	care for his child?
1278.66	(Laughter)
1281.5	I'm trying to unlearn
1281.5	many of the lessons of gender
1285.02	that I internalized when I was growing up.
1287.34	But I sometimes still feel very vulnerable
1287.34	in the face of gender expectations.
1292.42	The first time I taught
1292.42	a writing class in graduate school,
1296.18	I was worried.
1297.46	I wasn't worried
1297.46	about the material I would teach
1299.82	because I was well-prepared,
1301.18	and I was going to teach
1301.18	what I enjoy teaching.
1303.42	Instead, I was worried about what to wear.
1306.5	I wanted to be taken seriously.
1309.3	I knew that because I was female
1310.9	I will automatically
1310.9	have to prove my worth.
1315.06	And I was worried
1315.06	that if I looked too feminine,
1317.34	I would not be taken seriously.
1319.14	I really wanted to wear
1319.14	my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt,
1323.5	but I decided not to.
1325.34	Instead, I wore a very serious,
1327.74	very manly and very ugly suit.
1330.34	(Laughter)
1331.86	Because the sad truth is
1331.86	that when it comes to appearance
1334.58	we start off with men
1334.58	as the standard, as the norm.
1337.78	If a man is getting ready
1337.78	for a business meeting,
1340.14	he doesn't worry
1340.14	about looking too masculine
1342.3	and therefore not being taken for granted.
1344.82	If a woman has to get ready
1344.82	for business meeting,
1347.34	she has to worry
1347.34	about looking too feminine
1350.14	and what it says and whether or not
1350.14	she will be taken seriously.
1355.82	I wish I had not worn
1355.82	that ugly suit that day.
1359.26	I've actually banished it
1359.26	from my closet, by the way.
1362.42	Had I then the confidence
1362.42	that I have now to be myself,
1367.38	my students would have benefited
1367.38	even more from my teaching,
1370.34	because I would have been more comfortable
1372.42	and more fully and more truly myself.
1375.62	I have chosen to no longer
1375.62	be apologetic for my femaleness
1379.66	and for my femininity.
1381.5	(Applause)
1387.62	And I want to be respected
1387.62	in all of my femaleness
1390.5	because I deserve to be.
1393.02	Gender is not an easy
1393.02	conversation to have.
1396.9	For both men and women,
1398.5	to bring up gender is sometimes
1398.5	to encounter almost immediate resistance.
1402.46	I can imagine some people here
1402.46	are actually thinking,
1405.74	"""Women too do sef."""
1409.34	Some of the men here might be thinking,
1411.54	"""OK, all of this is interesting,"
1413.3	"but I don't think like that."""
1415.78	And that is part of the problem.
1418.02	That many men do not
1418.02	actively think about gender
1421.02	or notice gender
1422.54	is part of the problem of gender.
1424.58	That many men, say, like my friend Louis,
1427.26	that everything is fine now.
1429.98	And that many men do nothing to change it.
1432.86	If you are a man and you walk
1432.86	into a restaurant with a woman
1435.74	and the waiter greets only you,
1438.22	does it occur to you to ask the waiter,
1440.74	"""Why haven't you greeted her?"""
1445.14	Because gender can be --
1446.66	(Laughter)
1456.7	Actually, we may repose
1456.7	part of a longer version of this talk.
1461.22	So, because gender can be
1461.22	a very uncomfortable conversation to have,
1464.82	there are very easy ways to close it,
1464.82	to close the conversation.
1467.94	So some people will bring up
1467.94	evolutionary biology and apes,
1472.14	how, you know, female apes
1472.14	bow down to male apes
1475.82	and that sort of thing.
1477.7	But the point is we're not apes.
1479.78	(Laughter)
1481.22	(Applause)
1485.98	Apes also live on trees
1485.98	and have earthworms for breakfast,
1490.82	and we don't.
1493.06	Some people will say,
1493.06	"""Well, poor men also have a hard time."""
1497.7	And this is true.
1499.74	But that is not what this --
1501.1	(Laughter)
1502.22	But this is not
1502.22	what this conversation is about.
1506.3	Gender and class
1506.3	are different forms of oppression.
1510.1	I actually learned quite a bit
1510.1	about systems of oppression
1513.78	and how they can be blind to one another
1516.26	by talking to black men.
1519.14	I was once talking
1519.14	to a black man about gender
1522.34	and he said to me,
1523.74	"""Why do you have to say"
1523.74	'my experience as a woman'?
1527.22	Why can't it be
1528.46	"'your experience as a human being'?"""
1531.66	Now, this was the same man
1532.94	who would often talk
1532.94	about his experience as a black man.
1539.18	Gender matters.
1540.42	Men and women
1540.42	experience the world differently.
1542.94	Gender colors the way
1542.94	we experience the world.
1545.78	But we can change that.
1548.34	Some people will say,
1550.3	"""Oh, but women have the real power,"
1552.78	"bottom power."""
1554.58	And for non-Nigerians,
1554.58	bottom power is an expression
1557.5	which I suppose means
1557.5	something like a woman
1559.38	who uses her sexuality
1559.38	to get favors from men.
1563.02	But bottom power is not power at all.
1568.22	Bottom power means that a woman
1571.02	simply has a good root to tap into,
1571.02	from time to time --
1573.94	somebody else's power.
1576.46	And then, of course, we have to wonder
1578.34	what happens when
1578.34	that somebody else is in a bad mood,
1581.02	or sick
1582.42	or impotent.
1584.1	(Laughter)
1587.54	Some people will say that a woman
1587.54	being subordinate to a man is our culture.
1594.46	But culture is constantly changing.
1596.46	I have beautiful twin nieces
1596.46	who are fifteen and live in Lagos.
1601.14	If they had been born a hundred years ago
1603.82	they would have been
1603.82	taken away and killed.
1605.98	Because it was our culture,
1605.98	it was our culture to kill twins.
1610.86	So what is the point of culture?
1613.3	I mean there's the decorative,
1614.9	the dancing ...
1616.54	but also, culture really is about
1616.54	preservation and continuity of a people.
1621.18	In my family,
1622.46	I am the child who is most interested
1622.46	in the story of who we are,
1625.66	in our traditions,
1626.94	in the knowledge about ancestral lands.
1629.14	My brothers are not as interested as I am.
1631.74	But I cannot participate,
1634.02	I cannot go to umunna meetings,
1636.06	I cannot have a say.
1637.82	Because I'm female.
1639.9	Culture does not make people,
1642.02	people make culture.
1644.74	So if it is in fact true --
1646.54	(Applause)
1650.06	So if it is in fact true
1651.7	that the full humanity of women
1651.7	is not our culture,
1654.62	then we must make it our culture.
1657.86	I think very often of my dear friend,
1657.86	Okoloma Maduewesi.
1663.5	May he and all the others
1663.5	who passed away in that Sosoliso crash
1667.5	continue to rest in peace.
1670.22	He will always be remembered
1670.22	by those of us who loved him.
1674.7	And he was right that day many years ago
1674.7	when he called me a feminist.
1679.22	I am a feminist.
1681.22	And when I looked up the word
1681.22	in the dictionary that day,
1683.94	this is what it said:
1685.22	"""Feminist: a person"
1685.22	who believes in the social, political
1688.62	"and economic equality of the sexes."""
1692.34	My great grandmother,
1692.34	from the stories I've heard,
1695.3	was a feminist.
1696.9	She ran away from the house of the man
1696.9	she did not want to marry
1700.3	and ended up marrying
1700.3	the man of her choice.
1702.98	She refused, she protested, she spoke up
1705.98	whenever she felt she was being deprived
1705.98	of access, of land, that sort of thing.
1711.3	My great grandmother
1711.3	"did not know that word ""feminist,"""
1714.62	but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.
1717.98	More of us should reclaim that word.
1721.86	My own definition of feminist is:
1725.02	"""A feminist is a man or a woman"
1727.42	who says --
1729.3	(Laughter)
1732.46	(Applause)
1738.42	A feminist is a man or a woman who says,
1741.7	"""Yes, there's a problem"
1741.7	with gender as it is today,
1745.02	and we must fix it.
1746.34	"We must do better."""
1749.78	The best feminist I know
1751.86	is my brother Kene.
1754.74	He's also a kind,
1754.74	good-looking, lovely man,
1758.66	and he's very masculine.
1761.14	Thank you.
1762.38	(Applause)
