15.941	Blah blah blah blah blah.
18.472	Blah blah blah blah,
20.399	blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah.
22.994	Blah blah blah, blah.
26.997	So what the hell was that?
29.17	Well, you don't know
29.17	because you couldn't understand it.
33.32	It wasn't clear.
36.53	But hopefully, it was said
36.53	with enough conviction
39.768	that it was at least
39.768	alluringly mysterious.
44.792	Clarity or mystery?
47.973	I'm balancing these two things
47.973	in my daily work as a graphic designer,
52.199	as well as my daily life as a New Yorker
57.031	every day,
58.561	and there are two elements
58.561	that absolutely fascinate me.
63.028	Here's an example.
65.39	Now, how many people know what this is?
71.703	Okay. Now how many people
71.703	know what this is?
76.727	Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes
76.727	by the genius Charles M. Schulz,
84.41	we now have seven deft strokes
84.41	that in and of themselves
87.454	create an entire emotional life,
90.984	one that has enthralled
90.984	hundreds of millions of fans
93.863	for over 50 years.
95.906	This is actually a cover of a book
98.42	that I designed about the work
98.42	of Schulz and his art,
101.711	which will be coming out this fall,
104.497	and that is the entire cover.
106.378	There is no other typographic information
106.378	or visual information on the front,
111.324	and the name of the book
111.324	"is ""Only What's Necessary."""
115.317	So this is sort of symbolic about
115.317	the decisions I have to make every day
120.79	about the design that I'm perceiving,
124.706	and the design I'm creating.
127.525	So clarity.
129.332	Clarity gets to the point.
131.421	It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.
135.748	We ask ourselves this.
135.748	"[""When should you be clear?""]"
139.37	Now, something like this,
139.37	whether we can read it or not,
144.818	needs to be really, really clear.
148.418	Is it?
152.586	This is a rather recent example
152.586	of urban clarity that I just love,
159.284	mainly because I'm always late
159.284	and I am always in a hurry.
164.742	So when these meters started showing up
164.742	a couple of years ago on street corners,
171.288	I was thrilled, because now I finally knew
174.748	how many seconds I had
174.748	to get across the street
177.673	before I got run over by a car.
180.553	Six? I can do that. (Laughter)
185.475	So let's look at the yin
185.475	to the clarity yang,
189.283	and that is mystery.
192.812	Mystery is a lot more complicated
192.812	by its very definition.
198.176	Mystery demands to be decoded,
201.659	and when it's done right,
201.659	we really, really want to.
204.643	"[""When should you be mysterious?""]"
206.303	In World War II, the Germans
206.303	really, really wanted to decode this,
212.107	and they couldn't.
214.731	Here's an example of a design
214.731	that I've done recently
217.912	for a novel by Haruki Murakami,
220.234	who I've done design work for
220.234	for over 20 years now,
223.438	and this is a novel about a young man
223.438	who has four dear friends
229.15	who all of a sudden,
229.15	after their freshman year of college,
232.819	completely cut him off
232.819	with no explanation,
236.116	and he is devastated.
237.973	And the friends' names each have
237.973	a connotation in Japanese to a color.
243.376	So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue,
243.376	there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.
248.77	Tsukuru Tazaki, his name
248.77	does not correspond to a color,
252.16	so his nickname is Colorless, and
252.16	as he's looking back on their friendship,
256.61	he recalls that they were like
256.61	five fingers on a hand.
259.776	So I created this sort of abstract
259.776	representation of this,
264.257	but there's a lot more going on
264.257	underneath the surface of the story,
268.437	and there's more going on underneath
268.437	the surface of the jacket.
273.11	The four fingers are now four train lines
277.515	in the Tokyo subway system,
279.582	which has significance within the story.
282.813	And then you have
282.813	the colorless subway line
285.61	intersecting with each
285.61	of the other colors,
288.173	which basically he does
288.173	later on in the story.
290.82	He catches up with each of these people
292.802	to find out why they treated him
292.802	the way they did.
296.332	And so this is the three-dimensional
296.332	finished product
300.558	sitting on my desk in my office,
302.879	and what I was hoping for here
302.879	is that you'll simply be allured
307.546	by the mystery of what this looks like,
311.401	and will want to read it
314.196	to decode and find out and make more clear
314.196	why it looks the way it does.
320.163	"[""The Visual Vernacular.""]"
321.858	This is a way to use a more
321.858	familiar kind of mystery.
326.177	What does this mean?
327.938	This is what it means.
327.938	"[""Make it look like something else.""]"
330.772	The visual vernacular is the way
330.772	we are used to seeing a certain thing
335.302	applied to something else so that
335.302	we see it in a different way.
339.691	This is an approach I wanted to take
339.691	to a book of essays by David Sedaris
343.84	that had this title at the time.
343.84	"[""All the Beauty You Will Ever Need""]"
347.211	Now, the challenge here was that
347.211	this title actually means nothing.
351.402	It's not connected to any
351.402	of the essays in the book.
354.792	It came to the author's boyfriend
354.792	in a dream.
359.993	Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) --
359.993	so usually, I am creating a design
365.659	that is in some way based on the text,
365.659	but this is all the text there is.
369.722	So you've got this mysterious title
369.722	that really doesn't mean anything,
374.111	so I was trying to think:
376.61	Where might I see a bit of mysterious text
376.61	that seems to mean something but doesn't?
382.848	And sure enough, not long after,
385.255	one evening after a Chinese meal,
388.57	this arrived, and I thought,
388.57	"""Ah, bing, ideagasm!"" (Laughter)"
395.472	I've always loved the hilariously
395.472	mysterious tropes of fortune cookies
400.673	that seem to mean something extremely deep
403.575	but when you think about them -- if you
403.575	think about them -- they really don't.
407.662	"This says, ""Hardly anyone knows how much"
407.662	"is gained by ignoring the future."""
414.537	Thank you. (Laughter)
417.389	But we can take this visual vernacular
417.389	and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,
423.046	and we are so familiar
423.046	with how fortune cookie fortunes look
428.657	that we don't even need
428.657	the bits of the cookie anymore.
431.424	We're just seeing this strange thing
434.419	and we know we love David Sedaris,
436.416	and so we're hoping that
436.416	we're in for a good time.
439.76	"[""'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff""]"
439.76	David Rakoff was a wonderful writer
443.048	"and he called his first book ""Fraud"""
446.211	because he was getting sent
446.211	on assignments by magazines
450.171	to do things that he
450.171	was not equipped to do.
452.841	So he was this skinny little urban guy
455.163	and GQ magazine would send him
455.163	down the Colorado River
458.762	whitewater rafting to see
458.762	if he would survive.
463.378	And then he would write about it,
463.378	and he felt that he was a fraud
466.679	and that he was misrepresenting himself.
468.978	And so I wanted the cover of this book
468.978	to also misrepresent itself
473.645	and then somehow show
473.645	a reader reacting to it.
478.916	This led me to graffiti.
482.167	I'm fascinated by graffiti.
484.21	I think anybody who lives
484.21	in an urban environment
486.903	encounters graffiti all the time,
486.903	and there's all different sorts of it.
490.943	This is a picture I took
490.943	on the Lower East Side
494.55	of just a transformer box on the sidewalk
497.398	and it's been tagged like crazy.
499.372	Now whether you look at this and think,
499.372	"""Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"""
504.991	or you look at it and say,
504.991	"""That's illegal abuse of property,"""
509.379	the one thing I think we can all agree on
511.724	is that you cannot read it.
514.905	Right? There is no clear message here.
518.458	There is another kind of graffiti
518.458	that I find far more interesting,
523.682	which I call editorial graffiti.
526.538	This is a picture I took recently
526.538	in the subway,
530.744	and sometimes you see
530.744	lots of prurient, stupid stuff,
534.61	but I thought this was interesting,
534.61	and this is a poster that is saying
539.517	rah-rah Airbnb,
541.747	and someone has taken a Magic Marker
544.51	and has editorialized about
544.51	what they think about it.
548.434	And it got my attention.
551.266	So I was thinking, how do we
551.266	apply this to this book?
554.692	So I get the book by this person,
554.692	and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,
560.405	this guy is not who he says 
560.405	he is; he's a fraud.
565.079	And I get out a red Magic Marker,
568.54	and out of frustration just
568.54	scribble this across the front.
573.151	Design done. (Laughter)
577.815	And they went for it! (Laughter)
582.19	Author liked it, publisher liked it,
584.107	and that is how the book
584.107	went out into the world,
586.824	and it was really fun to see
586.824	people reading this on the subway
591.723	and walking around with it
591.723	and what have you,
593.859	and they all sort of looked
593.859	like they were crazy.
597.76	(Laughter)
600.59	"[""'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy""]"
600.59	Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,
604.633	a good friend, I've worked
604.633	with him for many years.
607.117	He is probably best known as the author
609.325	"of ""The Black Dahlia"""
609.325	"and ""L.A. Confidential."""
612.295	His most recent novel was called this,
612.295	which is a very mysterious name
617.15	that I'm sure a lot of people know
617.15	what it means, but a lot of people don't.
620.756	And it's a story about a Japanese-American
620.756	detective in Los Angeles in 1941
627.814	investigating a murder.
629.834	And then Pearl Harbor happens,
632.247	and as if his life
632.247	wasn't difficult enough,
635.357	now the race relations
635.357	have really ratcheted up,
640.2	and then the Japanese-American
640.2	internment camps are quickly created,
644.718	and there's lots of tension
646.738	and horrible stuff as he's still
646.738	trying to solve this murder.
650.824	And so I did at first think
650.824	very literally about this in terms of
656.656	all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor
656.656	and we'll add it to Los Angeles
660.539	and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn
660.539	on the horizon of the city.
668.146	And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor
670.561	just grafted onto Los Angeles.
673.625	My editor in chief said,
673.625	"""You know, it's interesting"
676.899	but I think you can do better
676.899	"and I think you can make it simpler."""
682.286	And so I went back
682.286	to the drawing board, as I often do.
686.506	But also, being alive to my surroundings,
691.197	I work in a high-rise in Midtown,
694.83	and every night,
694.83	before I leave the office,
698.5	I have to push this button to get out,
700.745	and the big heavy glass doors open
700.745	and I can get onto the elevator.
704.483	And one night, all of a sudden,
707.979	I looked at this and I saw it in a way
707.979	that I hadn't really noticed it before.
713.75	Big red circle, danger.
716.279	And I thought this was so obvious
719.158	that it had to have been
719.158	done a zillion times,
721.875	and so I did a Google image search,
721.875	and I couldn't find another book cover
726.449	that looked quite like this,
728.608	and so this is really
728.608	what solved the problem,
731.232	and graphically it's more interesting
733.763	and creates a bigger tension
733.763	between the idea
737.989	of a certain kind of sunrise
737.989	coming up over L.A. and America.
743.506	"[""'Gulp' A tour of the human"
743.506	"digestive system by Mary Roach.""]"
746.492	Mary Roach is an amazing writer
748.53	who takes potentially mundane
748.53	scientific subjects
752.152	and makes them not mundane at all;
752.152	she makes them really fun.
755.54	So in this particular case,
757.167	it's about the human digestive system.
760.279	So I'm trying to figure out what
760.279	is the cover of this book going to be.
766.141	This is a self-portrait. (Laughter)
769.845	Every morning I look at myself
769.845	in the medicine cabinet mirror
775.905	to see if my tongue is black.
778.622	And if it's not, I'm good to go.
782.17	(Laughter)
787.185	I recommend you all do this.
790.296	But I also started thinking,
790.296	here's our introduction.
794.243	Right? Into the human digestive system.
797.962	But I think what we can all agree on
800.21	is that actual photographs
800.21	of human mouths, at least based on this,
804.46	are off-putting. (Laughter)
808.244	So for the cover, then,
808.244	I had this illustration done
812.145	which is literally more palatable
814.374	and reminds us that it's best
814.374	to approach the digestive system
818.902	from this end.
821.2	(Laughter)
823.847	I don't even have to complete
823.847	the sentence. All right.
827.533	"[""Unuseful mystery""]"
829.079	What happens when clarity
829.079	and mystery get mixed up?
833.516	And we see this all the time.
835.489	This is what I call unuseful mystery.
837.997	I go down into the subway --
837.997	I take the subway a lot --
840.946	and this piece of paper
840.946	is taped to a girder.
846.59	Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,
850.243	and the train's about to come and I'm
850.243	trying to figure out what this means,
854.12	and thanks a lot.
856.914	Part of the problem here is that
856.914	they've compartmentalized the information
860.914	in a way they think is helpful,
860.914	and frankly, I don't think it is at all.
864.42	So this is mystery we do not need.
867.694	What we need is useful clarity,
867.694	so just for fun, I redesigned this.
875.78	This is using all the same elements.
878.259	(Applause)
881.532	Thank you. I am still waiting
881.532	for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)
886.447	You know, I'm actually not even
886.447	using more colors than they use.
889.506	They just didn't even bother
889.506	to make the 4 and the 5 green,
892.803	those idiots. (Laughter)
896.851	So the first thing we see
896.851	is that there is a service change,
899.92	and then, in two complete sentences
899.92	with a beginning, a middle and an end,
903.613	it tells us what the change is
903.613	and what's going to be happening.
908.383	Call me crazy! (Laughter)
913.63	"[""Useful mystery""]"
913.63	All right.
916.161	Now, here is a piece
916.161	of mystery that I love:
921.841	packaging.
923.498	This redesign of the Diet Coke can
926.772	by Turner Duckworth
926.772	is to me truly a piece of art.
932.2	It's a work of art. It's beautiful.
935.716	But part of what makes it
935.716	so heartening to me as a designer
938.893	is that he's taken the visual
938.893	vernacular of Diet Coke --
943.351	the typefaces, the colors,
943.351	the silver background --
946.889	and he's reduced them
946.889	to their most essential parts,
951.974	so it's like going back
951.974	to the Charlie Brown face.
954.714	It's like, how can you give them just
954.714	enough information so they know what it is
958.661	but giving them the credit
958.661	for the knowledge that they already have
962.539	about this thing?
964.396	It looks great, and you would go
964.396	into a delicatessen
968.181	and all of a sudden see that on the shelf,
968.181	and it's wonderful.
972.631	Which makes the next thing --
976.33	"[""Unuseful clarity""] --"
976.33	all the more disheartening,
978.862	at least to me.
980.51	So okay, again, going back
980.51	down into the subway,
984.35	after this came out,
986.44	these are pictures that I took.
988.46	Times Square subway station:
990.503	Coca-Cola has bought out
990.503	the entire thing for advertising. Okay?
995.681	And maybe some of you

1060.731	that's not a period, that's a trademark.
1067.141	So thanks a lot.
1068.421	So to me, this was just so bizarre
1072.433	about how they could get the packaging
1072.433	so mysteriously beautiful and perfect
1078.447	and the message so unbearably,
1078.447	clearly wrong.
1082.905	It was just incredible to me.
1086.365	So I just hope that I've been able
1086.365	to share with you some of my insights
1091.891	on the uses of clarity
1091.891	and mystery in my work,
1095.699	and maybe how you might decide
1095.699	to be more clear in your life,
1101.005	or maybe to be a bit more mysterious
1101.005	and not so over-sharing.
1107.273	(Laughter)
1111	And if there's just one thing
1111	that I leave you with from this talk,
1115.806	I hope it's this:
1117.757	Blih blih blih blah. Blah blah blih blih.
1117.757	"[""'Judge This,' Chip Kidd""]"
1121.022	Blih blih blah blah blah.
1121.022	Blah blah blah.
1124.086	Blah blah.
