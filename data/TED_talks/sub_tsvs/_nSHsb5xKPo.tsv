12.84	In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17,
16.96	boarded a flight from Minneapolis
18.92	to the Horn of Africa.
21.24	And while Burhan was the youngest recruit,
23.68	he was not alone.
25.36	Al-Shabaab managed to recruit
25.36	over two dozen young men
28.76	in their late teens and early 20s
31.36	with a heavy presence
31.36	on social media platforms like Facebook.
35.4	With the Internet and other technologies,
37.68	they've changed our everyday lives,
39.4	but they've also changed
39.4	recruitment, radicalization
43.24	and the front lines of conflict today.
47.68	What about the links connecting Twitter,
50.16	Google and protesters
50.16	fighting for democracy?
54.12	These numbers represent
54.12	Google's public DNS servers,
58.16	effectively the only
58.16	digital border crossing
60.72	protesters had and could use
62.8	to communicate with each other,
62.8	to reach the outside world
65.64	and to spread viral awareness
67.28	of what was happening
67.28	in their own country.
70.96	Today, conflict is essentially borderless.
73.4	If there are bounds to conflict today,
76.08	they're bound by digital,
76.08	not physical geography.
80	And under all this is a vacuum of power
83.08	where non-state actors, individuals
83.08	and private organizations
87.16	have the advantage over slow, outdated
87.16	military and intelligence agencies.
93.24	And this is because,
93.24	in the digital age of conflict,
96.04	there exists a feedback loop
98.32	where new technologies,
98.32	platforms like the ones I mentioned,
101.2	and more disruptive ones,
102.68	can be adapted, learned, and deployed
102.68	by individuals and organizations
107.48	faster than governments can react.
111.84	To understand the pace
111.84	of our own government thinking on this,
115.96	I like to turn to something aptly named
117.96	the Worldwide Threat Assessment,
121.12	where every year the Director
121.12	of National Intelligence in the US
124.84	looks at the global threat landscape,
127.68	"and he says, ""These are the threats,"
127.68	these are the details,
130.96	"and this is how we rank them."""
133.04	In 2007, there was absolutely
133.04	no mention of cyber security.
136.48	It took until 2011,
136.48	when it came at the end,
140.199	where other things, like West
140.199	African drug trafficking, took precedence.
144.12	In 2012, it crept up, still behind things
144.12	like terrorism and proliferation.
149.64	In 2013, it became the top threat,
151.76	in 2014 and for the foreseeable future.
156.24	What things like that show us
157.92	is that there is
157.92	a fundamental inability today
160.92	on the part of governments
160.92	to adapt and learn in digital conflict,
166.12	where conflict can be immaterial,
166.12	borderless, often wholly untraceable.
171.56	And conflict isn't just online to offline,
171.56	as we see with terrorist radicalization,
176.2	but it goes the other way as well.
179.52	We all know the horrible events
179.52	that unfolded in Paris this year
183.08	with the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks.
185.057	What an individual hacker or a small group
185.057	of anonymous individuals did
189.56	was enter those social media conversations
189.56	that so many of us took part in.
194.2	#JeSuisCharlie.
196.36	On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google,
198.6	all sorts of places where millions
198.6	of people, myself included,
202.08	were talking about the events
203.72	and saw images like this,
205.2	the emotional, poignant image of a baby
205.2	"with ""Je suis Charlie"" on its wrist."
210.36	And this turned into a weapon.
212.48	What the hackers did
212.48	was weaponize this image,
214.84	where unsuspecting victims,
216.52	like all of us in those conversations,
218.44	saw this image, downloaded it
221.08	but it was embedded with malware.
223.24	And so when you downloaded this image,
225.24	it hacked your system.
227.32	It took six days to deploy
227.32	a global malware campaign.
232.4	The divide between physical
232.4	and digital domains today
235.16	ceases to exist,
236.6	where we have offline attacks
236.6	like those in Paris
239.56	appropriated for online hacks.
243.32	And it goes the other way as well,
243.32	with recruitment.
245.8	We see online radicalization of teens,
248.28	who can then be deployed globally
248.28	for offline terrorist attacks.
253.48	With all of this, we see that there's
253.48	a new 21st century battle brewing,
258.36	and governments
258.36	don't necessarily take a part.
261.56	So in another case,
261.56	Anonymous vs. Los Zetas.
266.92	In early September 2011 in Mexico,
269.48	Los Zetas, one of the most
269.48	powerful drug cartels,
272.56	hung two bloggers with a sign that said,
274.92	"""This is what will happen"
274.92	"to all Internet busybodies."""
279.72	A week later, they beheaded a young girl.
281.72	They severed her head,
281.72	put it on top of her computer
284.2	with a similar note.
285.44	And taking the digital counteroffensive
288.32	because governments couldn't even
288.32	understand what was going on or act,
291.63	Anonymous, a group we might not associate
291.63	as the most positive force in the world,
295.55	took action,
296.76	not in cyber attacks, but threatening
296.76	information to be free.
301.92	On social media, they said,
303.64	"""We will release information"
305.32	that ties prosecutors and governors
305.32	"to corrupt drug deals with the cartel."""
310.8	And escalating that conflict,
313.2	"Los Zetas said, ""We will kill 10 people"
313.2	"for every bit of information you release."""
319.88	And so it ended there because
319.88	it would become too gruesome to continue.
325.56	But what was powerful about this
328.64	was that anonymous individuals,
331.24	not federal policia,
331.24	not military, not politicians,
334.88	could strike fear deep into the heart
339.08	of one of the most powerful,
339.08	violent organizations in the world.
344.32	And so we live in an era
346.52	that lacks the clarity
346.52	of the past in conflict,
350.08	in who we're fighting,
350.08	in the motivations behind attacks,
353.92	in the tools and techniques used,
355.8	and how quickly they evolve.
358.72	And the question still remains:
360.24	what can individuals,
360.24	organizations and governments do?
365.8	For answers to these questions,
365.8	it starts with individuals,
368.64	and I think peer-to-peer security
368.64	is the answer.
372.8	Those people in relationships
372.8	that bought over teens online,
376.76	we can do that with peer-to-peer security.
378.84	Individuals have more power
378.84	than ever before
381.4	to affect national
381.4	and international security.
385.36	And we can create those positive
385.36	peer-to-peer relationships
388.64	on and offline,
390.72	we can support and educate the next
390.72	generation of hackers, like myself,
395.08	"instead of saying, ""You can either be"
395.08	"a criminal or join the NSA."""
399.36	That matters today.
401.84	And it's not just individuals --
401.84	it's organizations, corporations even.
407.16	They have an advantage
407.16	to act across more borders,
409.72	more effectively and more rapidly
409.72	than governments can,
413.28	and there's a set
413.28	of real incentives there.
417.44	It's profitable and valuable
419.16	to be seen as trustworthy
419.16	in the digital age,
422.68	and will only be more so
422.68	in future generations to come.
426.68	But we still can't ignore government,
428.52	because that's who we turn to
428.52	for collective action
431.88	to keep us safe and secure.
436.08	But we see where that's gotten us so far,
439.12	where there's an inability to adapt
439.12	and learn in digital conflict,
442.88	where at the highest levels of leadership,
445.96	the Director of the CIA,
445.96	Secretary of Defense,
448.36	"they say, ""Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen."""
448.36	"""Cyber 9/11 is imminent."""
455.08	But this only makes us
455.08	more fearful, not more secure.
459.2	By banning encryption in favor
459.2	of mass surveillance and mass hacking,
462.96	sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you.
466.88	But that doesn't mean
466.88	that they're the only ones that can.
469.619	Capabilities are cheap, even free.
471.8	Technical ability
471.8	is rising around the world,
474.44	and individuals and small groups
474.44	have the advantage.
479.52	So today it might just be
479.52	the NSA and GCHQ,
482.48	but who's to say that the Chinese
482.48	can't find that backdoor?
486.12	Or in another generation,
486.12	some kid in his basement in Estonia?
490.88	And so I would say that it's
490.88	not what governments can do,
495.68	it's that they can't.
497.72	Governments today
497.72	need to give up power and control
502.24	in order to help make us more secure.
505.6	Giving up mass surveillance and hacking
505.6	and instead fixing those backdoors
509.72	means that, yeah, they can't spy on us,
512	but neither can the Chinese
513.36	or that hacker in Estonia
513.36	a generation from now.
517.28	And government support
517.28	for technologies like Tor and Bitcoin
520.76	mean giving up control,
522.36	but it means that developers, translators,
522.36	anybody with an Internet connection,
526.679	in countries like Cuba, Iran and China,
526.679	can sell their skills, their products,
530.799	in the global marketplace,
532.2	but more importantly sell their ideas,
534.44	show us what's happening
534.44	in their own countries.
538.08	And so it should be not fearful,
540.4	it should be inspiring
540.4	to the same governments
542.84	that fought for civil rights,
542.84	free speech and democracy
545.72	in the great wars of the last century,
547.76	that today, for the first time
547.76	in human history,
550.84	we have a technical opportunity
553.08	to make billions of people
553.08	safer around the world
555.72	that we've never had before
555.72	in human history.
558.28	It should be inspiring.
561.84	(Applause)
