15.368	We conventionally divide space
18.771	into private and public realms,
20.333	and we know these legal
20.333	distinctions very well
23.6	because we've become experts
25.608	at protecting our private
25.608	property and private space.
29.468	But we're less attuned
31.372	to the nuances of the public.
34.927	What translates generic public
34.927	space into qualitative space?
38.85	I mean, this is something
40.256	that our studio has been working on
42.081	for the past decade.
43.589	And we're doing this
43.589	through some case studies.
45.852	A large chunk of our work
47.341	has been put into transforming
48.881	this neglected industrial ruin
51.677	into a viable post-industrial space
54.75	that looks forward and backward
56.251	at the same time.
57.512	And another huge chunk of our work
60.014	has gone into making relevant
62.052	a site that's grown
62.052	out of sync with its time.
64.748	We've been working
64.748	on democratizing Lincoln Center
67.792	for a public that doesn't
67.792	usually have $300
71.51	to spend on an opera ticket.
75.275	So we've been eating, drinking,
76.966	thinking, living public space
79.26	for quite a long time.
81.231	And it's taught us really one thing,
83.5	and that is to truly
83.5	make good public space,
87.468	you have to erase the distinctions
90.718	between architecture, urbanism,
93.343	landscape, media design
95.218	and so on.
96.802	It really goes beyond distinction.
98.831	Now we're moving onto Washington, D.C.
101.885	and we're working
101.885	on another transformation,
104.218	and that is for the existing
104.218	Hirshhorn Museum
106.843	that's sited
108.468	on the most revered
108.468	public space in America,
110.76	the National Mall.
113.693	The Mall is a symbol
115.26	of American democracy.
118.093	And what's fantastic is that this symbol
121.093	is not a thing, it's not an image,
123.302	it's not an artifact,
125.01	actually it's a space,
126.718	and it's kind of just defined
126.718	by a line of buildings
129.568	on either side.
131.599	It's a space where citizens
131.599	can voice their discontent
135.343	and show their power.
136.636	It's a place where pivotal
136.636	moments in American history
139.552	have taken place.
141.708	And they're inscribed in there forever --
144.114	like the march on Washington
144.114	for jobs and freedom
146.493	and the great speech that Martin
146.493	Luther King gave there.
149.585	The Vietnam protests,
149.585	the commemoration of all that died
153.968	in the pandemic of AIDS,
156.01	the march for women's reproductive rights,
158.552	right up until almost the present.
162.01	The Mall is the greatest civic stage
165.172	in this country for dissent.
168.843	And it's synonymous with free speech,
172.731	even if you're not sure what it
172.731	is that you have to say.
175.422	It may just be a place
175.422	for civic commiseration.
180.452	There is a huge disconnect, we believe,
184.093	between the communicative
184.093	and discursive space of the Mall
188.26	and the museums that line
188.26	it to either side.
192.302	And that is that those
192.302	museums are usually passive,
195.927	they have passive relationships
195.927	between the museum
199.302	as the presenter and the audience,
200.946	as the receiver of information.
203.218	And so you can see dinosaurs
204.968	and insects and collections of locomotives
209.052	and all of that,
210.377	but you're really not involved;
211.908	you're being talked to.
213.552	When Richard Koshalek took
213.552	over as director of the Hirshhorn
218.255	in 2009,
220.052	he was determined to take advantage
222.468	of the fact that this museum was sited
225.718	at the most unique place:
227.468	at the seat of power in the U.S.
229.343	And while art and politics
231.552	are inherently and implicitly
231.552	together always and all the time,
237.01	there could be some very
237.01	special relationship
241.177	that could be forged
241.177	here in its uniqueness.
245.093	The question is, is it possible ultimately
247.718	for art to insert itself
249.468	into the dialogue of national
249.468	and world affairs?
252.593	And could the museum be
252.593	an agent of cultural diplomacy?
256.462	There are over 180 embassies
256.462	in Washington D.C.
261.523	There are over 500 think tanks.
264.51	There should be a way
266.01	of harnessing all of that intellectual
266.01	and global energy
268.927	into, and somehow through, the museum.
271.077	There should be some kind of brain trust.
274.156	So the Hirshhorn, as we began
274.156	to think about it,
277.468	and as we evolved the mission,
279.968	with Richard and his team --
281.802	it's really his life blood.
283.927	But beyond exhibiting contemporary art,
288.012	the Hirshhorn will become a public forum,
290.802	a place of discourse
292.927	for issues around arts,
295.135	culture, politics and policy.
300.218	It would have the global reach
300.218	of the World Economic Forum.
304.218	It would have the interdisciplinarity
304.218	of the TED Conference.
307.1	It would have the informality
307.1	of the town square.
311.558	And for this new initiative,
313.487	the Hirshhorn would have to expand
315.302	or appropriate a site
316.679	for a contemporary, deployable structure.
319.573	This is it. This is the Hirshhorn --
321.312	so a 230-foot-diameter concrete doughnut
324.427	designed in the early '70s
326.635	by Gordon Bunshaft.
328.387	It's hulking, it's silent,
329.677	it's cloistered, it's arrogant,
331.427	it's a design challenge.
333.76	Architects love to hate it.
335.333	One redeeming feature
337.343	is it's lifted up off the ground
339.052	and it's got this void,
340.802	and it's got an empty core
342.427	kind of in the spirit and that facade
345.343	very much corporate and federal style.
349.093	And around that space,
351.01	the ring is actually galleries.
352.552	Very, very difficult
352.552	to mount shows in there.
355.177	When the Hirshhorn opened,
357.135	Ada Louise Huxstable,
357.135	the New York Times critic,
359.445	had some choice words:
360.956	"""Neo-penitentiary modern."""
362.758	"""A maimed monument and a maimed Mall"
365.617	"for a maimed collection."""
367.052	Almost four decades later,
368.808	how will this building expand
370.552	for a new progressive program?
372.581	Where would it go?
374.093	It can't go in the Mall.
375.335	There is no space there.
376.592	It can't go in the courtyard.
378.135	It's already taken up by landscape
378.135	and by sculptures.
383.343	Well there's always the hole.
384.748	But how could it take
384.748	the space of that hole
389.26	and not be buried in it invisibly?
391.26	How could it become iconic?
393.01	And what language would it take?
396.558	The Hirshhorn sits
396.558	among the Mall's monumental institutions.
399.76	Most are neoclassical, heavy and opaque,
402.604	made of stone or concrete.
405.402	And the question is,
407.292	if one inhabits that space,
408.708	what is the material of the Mall?
412.07	It has to be different
412.07	from the buildings there.
414.718	It has to be something entirely different.
416.742	It has to be air.
418.53	In our imagination, it has to be light.
421.052	It has to be ephemeral.
421.052	It has to be formless.
423.267	And it has to be free.
425.291	(Video)
436.647	So this is the big idea.
439.778	It's a giant airbag.
442.343	The expansion takes
442.343	the shape of its container
445.998	and it oozes out wherever it can --
447.737	the top and sides.
449.76	But more poetically,
451.51	we like to think of the structure
453.552	as inhaling the democratic
453.552	air of the Mall,
455.624	bringing it into itself.
459.385	The before and the after.
463.356	"It was dubbed ""the bubble"" by the press."
466.51	That was the lounge.
469.052	It's basically one big volume of air
472.014	that just oozes out in every direction.
474.302	The membrane is translucent.
476.335	It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
480.024	And it's inflated twice a year
480.024	for one month at a time.
484.116	This is the view from the inside.
487.301	So you might have been wondering
489.147	how in the world
491.125	did we get this approved
491.125	by the federal government.
493.578	It had to be approved
493.578	by actually two agencies.
497.458	And one is there to preserve
501.343	the dignity and sanctity of the Mall.
503.708	I blush whenever I show this.
506.441	It is yours to interpret.
510.26	But one thing I can say
512.302	is that it's a combination
514.76	of iconoclasm
517.01	and adoration.
520.637	There was also some creative
520.637	interpretation involved.
523.753	The Congressional Buildings Act of 1910
526.677	limits the height of buildings in D.C.
528.635	to 130 feet,
530.593	except for spires, towers,
530.593	domes and minarets.
533.468	This pretty much exempts monuments
533.468	of the church and state.
538.135	And the bubble is 153 ft.
541.26	That's the Pantheon next to it.
543.885	It's about 1.2 million cubic
543.885	feet of compressed air.
547.177	And so we argued it
549.093	on the merits of being a dome.
551.093	So there it is,
553.177	very stately,
554.351	among all the stately
554.351	buildings in the Mall.
557.802	And while this Hirshhorn
557.802	is not landmarked,
560.843	it's very, very historically sensitive.
563.218	And so we couldn't really
563.218	touch its surfaces.
565.593	We couldn't leave any traces behind.
567.332	So we strained it from the edges,
569.51	and we held it by cables.
571.635	It's a study of some bondage techniques,
575.01	which are actually very important
576.693	because it's hit by wind all the time.
578.618	There's one permanent
578.618	steel ring at the top,
580.733	but it can't be seen
580.733	from any vantage point on the Mall.
583.448	There are also some restrictions
585.635	about how much it could be lit.
587.136	It glows from within, it's translucent.
589.177	But it can't be more lit than the Capitol
592.343	or some of the monuments.
593.76	So it's down the hierarchy on lighting.
596.14	So it comes to the site twice a year.
598.26	It's taken off the delivery truck.
601.218	It's hoisted.
602.718	And then it's inflated
605.01	with this low-pressure air.
606.76	And then it's restrained with the cables.
608.737	And then it's ballasted
608.737	with water at the very bottom.
611.927	This is a very strange moment
616.052	where we were asked
616.052	by the bureaucracy at the Mall
618.468	how much time would it take to install.
621.677	And we said, well the first
621.677	erection would take one week.
624.416	And they really connected with that idea.
627.76	And then it was really
627.76	easy all the way through.
631.76	So we didn't really have
631.76	that many hurdles, I have to say,
635.843	with the government
635.843	and all the authorities.
637.915	But some of the toughest hurdles
639.463	have been the technical ones.
640.968	This is the warp and weft.
642.26	This is a point cloud.
644.302	There are extreme pressures.
646.427	This is a very, very unusual building
648.213	in that there's no gravity load,
650.135	but there's load in every direction.
651.874	And I'm just going to zip
651.874	through these slides.
656.427	And this is the space in action.
659.552	So flexible interior for discussions,
662.385	just like this, but in the round --
664.718	luminous and reconfigurable.
666.177	Could be used for anything,
668.593	for performances, films,
670.343	for installations.
672.885	And the very first program
675.302	will be one of cultural
675.302	dialogue and diplomacy
677.517	organized in partnership
678.802	with the Council on Foreign Relations.
681.427	Form and content are together here.
683.177	The bubble is an anti-monument.
685.843	The ideals of participatory democracy
688.385	are represented through suppleness
690.51	rather than rigidity.
691.956	Art and politics
693.385	occupy an ambiguous site
693.385	outside the museum walls,
697.025	but inside of the museum's core,
700.618	blending its air
702.468	with the democratic air of the Mall.
704.835	And the bubble will inflate
710.385	hopefully for the first time
712.01	at the end of 2013.
714.218	Thank you.
716.718	(Applause)
