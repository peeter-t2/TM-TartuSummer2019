15.617	I'm going to talk about religion.
19.482	But it's a broad and very delicate subject,
24.734	so I have to limit myself.
26.405	And therefore I will limit myself
28.885	to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.
33.294	(Laughter)
34.86	This is a very serious talk.
37.42	So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.
41.515	It's when the young couple whisper,
43.86	"""Tonight we are going to make a baby."""
47.032	My talk will be about the impact of religions
52.368	on the number of babies per woman.
56.537	This is indeed important,
58.202	because everyone understands
59.732	that there is some sort of limit
62.014	on how many people we can be on this planet.
65.242	And there are some people
67.189	who say that the world population is growing like this --
70.608	three billion in 1960,
72.415	seven billion just last year --
75.054	and it will continue to grow
76.6	because there are religions that stop women from having few babies,
80.38	and it may continue like this.
82.783	To what extent are these people right?
86.685	When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,
91.565	and today, 2000, there's almost two billion.
95.74	What has happened since,
97.442	and what do the experts predict will happen
100.137	with the number of children during this century?
102.62	This is a quiz. What do you think?
105.238	Do you think it will decrease to one billion?
109.14	Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?
112.968	Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,
116.685	or will it continue in the same fast rate
119.189	and be four billion children up there?
121.678	I will tell you by the end of my speech.
125.103	But now, what does religion have to do with it?
130.125	When you want to classify religion,
132.457	it's more difficult than you think.
133.988	You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.
137.192	It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,
142.725	but that's not detailed enough.
144.497	So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.
148.306	But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism
152.952	into many subgroups,
154.555	which was too detailed.
156.06	Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map,
159.478	and it looks like this.
161.851	Each country's a bubble.
165.254	The size is the population -- big China, big India here.
168.678	And the color now is the majority religion.
172.792	It's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people
176.023	say that they belong.
177.278	It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.
181.995	Islam is the majority religion
183.968	all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,
187.743	Southern Europe and through Asia
190.023	all the way to Indonesia.
192.26	That's where we find Islamic majority.
195.177	And Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.
199.98	And that is most countries in America and Europe,
204.005	many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.
207.675	The white here are countries which cannot be classified,
210.355	because one religion does not reach 50 percent
212.98	or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.
216.337	So we were careful with that.
218.097	So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.
221.955	This is in 1960.
223.968	And now I show the number of babies per woman here:
227.5	two, four or six --
230.586	many babies, few babies.
232.777	And here the income per person in comparable dollars.
235.958	The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first
239.555	before you get few babies.
241.225	So low income here, high income there.
244.857	And indeed in 1960,
246.495	you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.
249.232	The exception was Japan.
251.506	Japan here was regarded as an exception.
254.743	Otherwise it was only Christian countries.
256.771	But there was also many Christian countries
258.98	that had six to seven babies per woman.
261.552	But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.
267.029	And countries with Islam as the majority religion,
271.202	all of them almost had six to seven children per woman,
275.832	irregardless of the income level.
278.257	And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.
282.5	Now let's see what has happened in the world.
284.42	I start the world, and here we go.
286.34	Now 1962 -- can you see they're getting a little richer,
289.558	but the number of babies per woman is falling?
292.232	Look at China. They're falling fairly fast.
294.405	And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,
299.168	as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.
304.131	And when we enter into this century,
306.66	you'll find more than half of mankind down here.
310.02	And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans
314.946	who live in countries with about two children per woman.
319.26	(Applause)
322.798	It's a quite amazing development which has happened.
326.758	(Applause)
328.135	And these are countries from United States here,
331.337	with $40,000 per capita,
333.498	France, Russia, Iran,
336.445	Mexico, Turkey, Algeria,
340.097	Indonesia, India
342.322	and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,
345.051	which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States
349.094	and the same amount of babies per woman.
352.251	I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman
355.482	is surprisingly good in all countries.
357.571	We get that from the census data.
359.518	It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.
362.911	So what we can conclude
364.217	is you don't have to get rich to have few children.
366.998	It has happened across the world.
369.34	And then when we look at religions,
371.918	we can see that the Eastern religions,
374.445	indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion
377.445	that has more than three children.
379.34	Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,
383.392	you see countries all the way.
385.3	But there's no major difference.
387.078	There's no major difference between these religions.
390.58	There is a difference with income.
392.931	The countries which have many babies per woman here,
396.86	they have quite low income.
398.792	Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
402.223	But there are also countries here
404.885	like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,
409.002	like Yemen and Afghanistan.
411.808	Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo,
415.685	which have suffered severe conflicts,
419.135	that they don't have fast population growth.
421.892	It's the other way around.
423.669	In the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates
427.562	that have the fastest population growth.
429.798	Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.
433.786	These countries have six children per woman.
436.694	They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.
440.826	But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.
444.645	Congo will go from 60 to 120.
448.052	That's where we have the fast population growth.
450.943	And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.
455.288	Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,
458.802	with a Christian dominated country, Ghana.
461.26	I take them backwards here to their independence,
464.857	when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.
468.54	Just look what they have done.
470.638	It's an amazing improvement,
472.189	from seven children per woman,
474.426	they've gone all the way down to between four and five.
477.491	It's a tremendous improvement.
479.078	So what does it take?
480.503	Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries.
484.1	You need to have children to survive.
486.589	You need to get out of the deepest poverty
489.202	so children are not of importance for work in the family.
492.78	You need to have access to some family planning.
495.651	And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.
499.983	But let me illustrate that fourth factor
502.891	by looking at Qatar.
504.992	Here we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.
508.792	If I take these countries back to the years of their independence,
512.429	which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 --
515.5	it's a quite amazing development which had happened.
519.374	Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.
521.18	With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop
524.438	in number of babies per woman.
526.552	And what is the reason in Qatar?
528.555	Well I do as I always do.
530.214	I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage --
533.986	It's a very good webpage. I recommend it --
536.117	and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here --
542.608	and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.
546.675	Very interesting. Lots to read.
549.02	I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.
553.592	These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,
557.143	and they say the most important factors are:
559.798	"""Increased age at first marriage,"
561.74	increased educational level of Qatari woman
564.765	"and more women integrated in the labor force."""
568.078	I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.
571.82	This is a country that indeed has gone through
574.337	a very, very interesting modernization.
577.872	So what it is, is these four:
580.497	Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,
583.58	women should get education and join the labor force
586.482	and family planning should be accessible.
588.755	Now look again at this.
592.143	The average number of children in the world
594.435	is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today.
597.857	There are countries up here which are very poor.
600.894	And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.
604.845	I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.
608.632	And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.
614.091	So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,
617.703	it's two.
619.245	We have reached peak child.
621.774	The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.
624.663	We are still debating peak oil,
626.655	but we have definitely reached peak child.
629.586	And the world population will stop growing.
632.309	The United Nations Population Division has said
634.411	it will stop growing at 10 billion.
636.851	But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?
640.891	Well I will show you here.
643.337	I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.
647.112	They are quite useful for educational purposes.
650.946	Each card box is one billion people.
653.854	And there are two billion children in the world.
656.522	There are two billion young people between 15 and 30.
663.392	These are rounded numbers.
664.862	Then there is one billion between 30 and 45,
669.888	almost one between 45 and 60.
673.731	And then it's my box.
675.355	This is me: 60-plus.
677.38	We are here on top.
679.542	"So what will happen now is what we call ""the big fill-up."""
684.774	You can see that it's like three billion missing here.
687.762	They are not missing because they've died; they were never born.
692.069	Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born
696.177	than there were during the last 30 years.
698.934	So what will happen now is quite straightforward.
702.088	The old, sadly, we will die.
704.885	The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.
709.54	Then the old will die.
712.148	The rest will grow older and get two billion children.
716.186	And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.
721.955	(Applause)
724.209	This is the great fill-up.
727.842	It's inevitable.
730.614	And can you see that this increase took place
733.26	without life getting longer and without adding children?
738.063	Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.
742.968	All the religions in the world are fully capable
746.237	to maintain their values and adapt to this new world.
751.362	And we will be just 10 billion in this world,
756.645	if the poorest people get out of poverty,
760.229	their children survive, they get access to family planning.
763.402	That is needed.
765.302	But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.
771.017	So when you discuss and when you plan
774.229	for the resources and the energy needed for the future,
777.632	for human beings on this planet,
779.965	you have to plan for 10 billion.
782.122	Thank you very much.
784.272	(Applause)
