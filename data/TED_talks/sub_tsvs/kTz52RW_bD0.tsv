12.843	What if I told you that time has a race,
17.622	a race in the contemporary way
17.622	that we understand race
20.406	in the United States?
21.98	Typically, we talk about race
21.98	in terms of black and white issues.
27.366	In the African-American communities
27.366	from which I come,
30.246	we have a long-standing
30.246	multi-generational joke
33.062	"about what we call ""CP time,"""
35.623	"or ""colored people's time."""
38.079	Now, we no longer refer
38.079	"to African-Americans as ""colored,"""
41.384	but this long-standing joke
43.17	about our perpetual lateness to church,
45.567	to cookouts, to family events
47.273	and even to our own funerals, remains.
50.936	I personally am a stickler for time.
53.774	It's almost as if my mother,
53.774	when I was growing up, said,
56.486	"""We will not be those black people."""
58.436	So we typically arrive to events
62.018	But today, I want to talk to you
62.018	more about the political nature of time,
66.919	for if time had a race,
68.862	it would be white.
70.883	White people own time.
74.141	I know, I know.
75.883	"Making such ""incendiary statements"""
75.883	makes us uncomfortable:
80.434	Haven't we moved past the point
80.434	where race really matters?
84.575	Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?
87.79	Shouldn't we go ahead
87.79	with our enlightened, progressive selves
90.861	and relegate useless concepts like race
90.861	to the dustbins of history?
94.95	How will we ever get over racism
94.95	if we keep on talking about race?
101.599	Perhaps we should lock up our concepts
101.599	of race in a time capsule,
105.207	bury them and dig them up
105.207	in a thousand years,
108.152	peer at them with the clearly
108.152	more enlightened,
110.544	raceless versions of ourselves
110.544	that belong to the future.
114.317	But you see there,
115.635	that desire to mitigate the impact
115.635	of race and racism shows up
120.25	in how we attempt to manage time,
122.588	in the ways we narrate history,
124.672	in the ways we attempt to shove
124.672	the negative truths of the present
127.842	into the past,
129.024	in the ways we attempt to argue
129.024	that the future that we hope for
132.104	is the present in which
132.104	we're currently living.
135.209	Now, when Barack Obama
135.209	became President of the US in 2008,
138.375	many Americans declared
138.375	that we were post-racial.
142.16	I'm from the academy
143.473	where we're enamored
143.473	with being post-everything.
146.304	We're postmodern, we're post-structural,
146.304	we're post-feminist.
151.193	"""Post"" has become"
151.193	a simple academic appendage
153.649	that we apply to a range of terms
155.613	to mark the way we were.
158.155	But prefixes alone don't have the power
158.155	to make race and racism
162.331	a thing of the past.
164.115	"The US was never ""pre-race."""
166.759	So to claim that we're post-race when we
166.759	have yet to grapple with the impact
170.674	of race on black people,
170.674	Latinos or the indigenous
173.596	is disingenuous.
175.902	Just about the moment
175.902	we were preparing to celebrate
178.795	our post-racial future,
180.19	our political conditions became
180.19	the most racial they've been
183.169	in the last 50 years.
185.249	So today, I want to offer to you
185.249	three observations,
188.806	about the past, the present
188.806	and the future of time,
192.216	as it relates to the combating
192.216	of racism and white dominance.
196.817	First: the past.
199.622	Time has a history,
201.533	and so do black people.
203.524	But we treat time as though
203.524	it is timeless,
206.214	as though it has always been this way,
208.642	as though it doesn't have
208.642	a political history
210.955	bound up with the plunder
210.955	of indigenous lands,
213.189	the genocide of indigenous people
215.162	and the stealing of Africans
215.162	from their homeland.
218.802	When white male European philosophers
220.702	first thought to conceptualize
220.702	time and history, one famously declared,
225.726	"""[Africa] is no historical"
225.726	"part of the World."""
230.29	He was essentially saying
231.888	that Africans were people
231.888	outside of history
234.279	who had had no impact on time
236.789	or the march of progress.
238.923	This idea, that black people
238.923	have had no impact on history,
243.392	is one of the foundational ideas
243.392	of white supremacy.
246.888	It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson
246.888	"created ""Negro History Week"" in 1926."
251.746	It's the reason that we continue
251.746	to celebrate Black History Month
254.885	in the US every February.
258.6	Now, we also see this idea
260.974	that black people are people either
260.974	alternately outside of the bounds of time
265.521	or stuck in the past,
267.053	in a scenario where,
267.053	much as I'm doing right now,
269.952	a black person stands up and insists
269.952	that racism still matters,
274.102	and a person, usually white,
276.452	says to them,
277.642	"""Why are you stuck in the past?"
279.602	Why can't you move on?
281.907	We have a black president.
283.835	"We're past all that."""
286.571	William Faulkner famously said,
288.804	"""The past is never dead."
290.923	"It's not even past."""
293.816	But my good friend
293.816	Professor Kristie Dotson says,
296.929	"""Our memory is longer than our lifespan."""
301.024	We carry, all of us,
303.35	family and communal
303.35	hopes and dreams with us.
308.9	We don't have the luxury
308.9	of letting go of the past.
313.806	But sometimes,
315.749	our political conditions are so troubling
317.758	that we don't know
317.758	if we're living in the past
319.971	or we're living in the present.
322.088	Take, for instance,
322.088	when Black Lives Matter protesters
324.787	go out to protest unjust killings
324.787	of black citizens by police,
328.832	and the pictures that emerge
328.832	from the protest
331.957	look like they could have been
331.957	taken 50 years ago.
335.615	The past won't let us go.
338.516	But still, let us press our way
338.516	into the present.
343.357	At present, I would argue
345.813	that the racial struggles
345.813	we are experiencing
348.174	are clashes over time and space.
352.005	What do I mean?
354.12	Well, I've already told you
354.12	that white people own time.
357.662	Those in power dictate
357.662	the pace of the workday.
361.413	They dictate how much money
361.413	our time is actually worth.
365.793	And Professor George Lipsitz argues
367.959	that white people even dictate
367.959	the pace of social inclusion.
371.894	They dictate how long
371.894	it will actually take
374.674	for minority groups to receive the rights
374.674	that they have been fighting for.
379.135	Let me loop back to the past quickly
379.135	to give you an example.
382.921	If you think about
382.921	the Civil Rights Movement
385.088	and the cries of its leaders
385.088	"for ""Freedom Now,"""
388.045	they were challenging the slow pace
388.045	of white social inclusion.
392.137	By 1965, the year
392.137	the Voting Rights Act was passed,
396.189	there had been a full 100 years
397.843	between the end of the Civil War
399.71	and the conferral of voting rights
399.71	on African-American communities.
402.88	Despite the urgency of a war,
405.119	it still took a full 100 years
405.119	for actual social inclusion to occur.
410.318	Since 2012,
412.277	conservative state legislatures
412.277	across the US have ramped up attempts
415.978	to roll back African-American
415.978	voting rights
418.191	by passing restrictive voter ID laws
420.69	and curtailing early voting opportunities.
423.672	This past July, a federal court
423.672	struck down North Carolina's voter ID law
427.646	"saying it ""... targeted African-Americans"
427.646	"with surgical precision."""
434.425	Restricting African-American inclusion
434.425	in the body politic
437.861	is a primary way that we attempt
437.861	to manage and control people
442.877	by managing and controlling time.
446.008	But another place that we see
446.008	these time-space clashes
449.6	is in gentrifying cities
449.6	like Atlanta, Brooklyn,
453.092	Philadelphia, New Orleans
453.092	and Washington, DC --
456.583	places that have had
456.583	black populations for generations.
460.231	But now, in the name
460.231	of urban renewal and progress,
463.547	these communities are pushed out,
465.558	in service of bringing them
465.558	into the 21st century.
468.724	Professor Sharon Holland asked:
471.996	What happens when a person
471.996	who exists in time
475.687	meets someone who only occupies space?
480.717	These racial struggles
482.336	are battles over those
482.336	who are perceived to be space-takers
485.94	and those who are perceived
485.94	to be world-makers.
489.861	Those who control the flow
489.861	and thrust of history
492.874	are considered world-makers
492.874	who own and master time.
497.015	In other words: white people.
500.09	But when Hegel famously said that Africa
500.09	was no historical part of the world,
504.219	he implied that it was merely
504.219	a voluminous land mass
506.748	taking up space
506.748	at the bottom of the globe.
509.34	Africans were space-takers.
512.348	So today, white people continue to control
512.348	the flow and thrust of history,
516.655	while too often treating black people
516.655	as though we are merely taking up space
521.222	to which we are not entitled.
523.53	Time and the march of progress
523.53	is used to justify
527.501	a stunning degree of violence
527.501	towards our most vulnerable populations,
531.94	who, being perceived as space-takers
531.94	rather than world-makers,
537.039	are moved out of the places
537.039	where they live,
539.38	in service of bringing them
539.38	into the 21st century.
543.688	Shortened life span according to zip code
543.688	is just one example of the ways
547.842	that time and space cohere
547.842	in an unjust manner
550.593	in the lives of black people.
552.793	Children who are born
552.793	in New Orleans zip code 70124,
557.338	which is 93 percent white,
559.29	can expect to live a full 25 years longer
562.543	than children born
562.543	in New Orleans zip code 70112,
566.822	which is 60 percent black.
569.856	Children born in Washington, DC's
569.856	wealthy Maryland suburbs
574.004	can expect to live a full 20 years longer
577.134	than children born
577.134	in its downtown neighborhoods.
581.492	Ta-Nehisi Coates argues
584.2	"that, ""The defining feature"
584.2	of being drafted into the Black race
589.864	"is the inescapable robbery of time."""
593.518	We experience time discrimination,
595.334	he tells us,
596.585	not just as structural,
598.089	but as personal:
599.564	in lost moments of joy,
601.412	lost moments of connection,
603.652	lost quality of time with loved ones
606.173	and lost years of healthy quality of life.
611.829	In the future, do you see black people?
616.344	Do black people have a future?
620.209	What if you belong
620.209	to the very race of people
622.463	who have always been pitted against time?
626.145	What if your group is the group
626.145	for whom a future was never imagined?
631.911	These time-space clashes --
633.631	between protesters and police,
636.196	between gentrifiers and residents --
638.59	don't paint a very pretty picture
640.611	of what America hopes
640.611	for black people's future.
644.21	If the present is any indicator,
645.948	our children will be under-educated,
648.023	health maladies will take their toll
650.405	and housing will continue
650.405	to be unaffordable.
653.912	So if we're really ready
653.912	to talk about the future,
656.958	perhaps we should begin
656.958	by admitting that we're out of time.
661.814	We black people
661.814	have always been out of time.
665.085	Time does not belong to us.
667.233	Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.
670.453	Time is used to displace us,
673.009	or conversely, we are urged
673.009	into complacency
676.043	through endless calls to just be patient.
679.805	But if past is prologue,
682.281	let us seize upon the ways in which
682.281	we're always out of time anyway
685.558	to demand with urgency
687.23	freedom now.
689.587	I believe the future is what we make it.
692.466	But first, we have to decide
692.466	that time belongs to all of us.
697.637	No, we don't all get equal time,
700.364	but we can decide that the time
700.364	we do get is just and free.
704.406	We can stop making your zip code
704.406	the primary determinant
707.075	of your lifespan.
708.844	We can stop stealing learning time
708.844	from black children
711.588	through excessive use
711.588	of suspensions and expulsions.
714.668	We can stop stealing time
714.668	from black people
716.761	through long periods
716.761	of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.
720.767	The police can stop
720.767	stealing time and black lives
723.787	through use of excessive force.
726.997	I believe the future is what we make it.
730.244	But we can't get there
730.244	on colored people's time
734.283	or white time
736.235	or your time
738.071	or even my time.
740.801	It's our time.
742.883	Ours.
744.179	Thank you.
745.36	(Applause)
