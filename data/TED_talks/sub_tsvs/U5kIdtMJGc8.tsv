12.817	Chris Anderson: You were something
12.817	of a mathematical phenom.
15.675	You had already taught at Harvard
15.675	and MIT at a young age.
18.763	And then the NSA came calling.
21.464	What was that about?
23.207	Jim Simons: Well the NSA --
23.207	that's the National Security Agency --
27.154	they didn't exactly come calling.
29.465	They had an operation at Princeton,
29.465	where they hired mathematicians
33.963	to attack secret codes
33.963	and stuff like that.
37.294	And I knew that existed.
39.315	And they had a very good policy,
41.519	because you could do half your time
41.519	at your own mathematics,
45.393	and at least half your time
45.393	working on their stuff.
49.559	And they paid a lot.
51.057	So that was an irresistible pull.
54.132	So, I went there.
56.068	CA: You were a code-cracker.
57.43	JS: I was.
58.62	CA: Until you got fired.
59.801	JS: Well, I did get fired. Yes.
61.408	CA: How come?
63.28	JS: Well, how come?
65.611	I got fired because,
65.611	well, the Vietnam War was on,
70.591	and the boss of bosses in my organization
70.591	was a big fan of the war
76.353	and wrote a New York Times article,
76.353	a magazine section cover story,
80.772	about how we would win in Vietnam.
82.566	And I didn't like that war,
82.566	I thought it was stupid.
85.719	And I wrote a letter to the Times,
85.719	which they published,
88.408	saying not everyone
88.408	who works for Maxwell Taylor,
92.446	if anyone remembers that name,
92.446	agrees with his views.
97.553	And I gave my own views ...
99.235	CA: Oh, OK. I can see that would --
101.423	JS: ... which were different
101.423	from General Taylor's.
104.002	But in the end, nobody said anything.
105.932	But then, I was 29 years old at this time,
105.932	and some kid came around
109.657	and said he was a stringer
109.657	from Newsweek magazine
112.769	and he wanted to interview me
112.769	and ask what I was doing about my views.
118.16	"And I told him, ""I'm doing"
118.16	mostly mathematics now,
122.083	and when the war is over,
122.083	"then I'll do mostly their stuff."""
126.123	Then I did the only
126.123	intelligent thing I'd done that day --
128.972	I told my local boss
128.972	that I gave that interview.
133.153	"And he said, ""What'd you say?"""
134.636	And I told him what I said.
136.126	And then he said,
136.126	"""I've got to call Taylor."""
138.465	He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes.
140.866	I was fired five minutes after that.
143.59	CA: OK.
144.836	JS: But it wasn't bad.
146.011	CA: It wasn't bad,
146.011	because you went on to Stony Brook
148.528	and stepped up your mathematical career.
151.685	You started working with this man here.
154.161	Who is this?
156.352	JS: Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern.
157.788	Chern was one of the great
157.788	mathematicians of the century.
160.916	I had known him when
160.916	I was a graduate student at Berkeley.
166.173	And I had some ideas,
168.068	and I brought them to him
168.068	and he liked them.
170.539	Together, we did this work
170.539	which you can easily see up there.
177.189	There it is.
179.198	CA: It led to you publishing
179.198	a famous paper together.
182.828	Can you explain at all what that work was?
187.028	JS: No.
188.21	(Laughter)
190.966	JS: I mean, I could
190.966	explain it to somebody.
193.054	(Laughter)
195.153	CA: How about explaining this?
197.041	JS: But not many. Not many people.
201.144	CA: I think you told me
201.144	it had something to do with spheres,
203.982	so let's start here.
205.868	JS: Well, it did,
205.868	but I'll say about that work --
209.492	it did have something to do with that,
209.492	but before we get to that --
212.716	that work was good mathematics.
216.28	I was very happy with it; so was Chern.
219.91	It even started a little sub-field
219.91	that's now flourishing.
224.638	But, more interestingly,
224.638	it happened to apply to physics,
229.956	something we knew nothing about --
229.956	at least I knew nothing about physics,
234.275	and I don't think Chern
234.275	knew a heck of a lot.
236.581	And about 10 years
236.581	after the paper came out,
240.568	a guy named Ed Witten in Princeton
240.568	started applying it to string theory
245.072	and people in Russia started applying it
245.072	"to what's called ""condensed matter."""
249.948	Today, those things in there
249.948	called Chern-Simons invariants
254.865	have spread through a lot of physics.
256.754	And it was amazing.
257.952	We didn't know any physics.
259.714	It never occurred to me
259.714	that it would be applied to physics.
262.592	But that's the thing about mathematics --
262.592	you never know where it's going to go.
266.404	CA: This is so incredible.
267.92	So, we've been talking about
267.92	how evolution shapes human minds
272.308	that may or may not perceive the truth.
274.84	Somehow, you come up
274.84	with a mathematical theory,
278.177	not knowing any physics,
280.049	discover two decades later
280.049	that it's being applied
282.571	to profoundly describe
282.571	the actual physical world.
285.626	How can that happen?
286.803	JS: God knows.
287.984	(Laughter)
290.849	But there's a famous physicist
290.849	named [Eugene] Wigner,
294.023	and he wrote an essay on the unreasonable
294.023	effectiveness of mathematics.
299.635	Somehow, this mathematics,
299.635	which is rooted in the real world
303.611	in some sense -- we learn to count,
303.611	measure, everyone would do that --
308.63	and then it flourishes on its own.
310.976	But so often it comes
310.976	back to save the day.
314.293	General relativity is an example.
316.495	[Hermann] Minkowski had this geometry,
316.495	and Einstein realized,
319.636	"""Hey! It's the very thing"
319.636	"in which I can cast general relativity."""
323.507	So, you never know. It is a mystery.
327.056	It is a mystery.
328.297	CA: So, here's a mathematical
328.297	piece of ingenuity.
331.617	Tell us about this.
332.983	JS: Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere,
332.983	and it has a lattice around it --
338.931	you know, those squares.
342.697	What I'm going to show here was
342.697	originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,
347.627	the great mathematician, in the 1700s.
350.223	And it gradually grew to be
350.223	a very important field in mathematics:
355.428	algebraic topology, geometry.
359.039	That paper up there had its roots in this.
363.427	So, here's this thing:
365.285	it has eight vertices,
369.761	And if you look at the difference --
369.761	vertices minus edges plus faces --
373.615	you get two.
374.791	OK, well, two. That's a good number.
377.034	Here's a different way of doing it --
377.034	these are triangles covering --
381.306	this has 12 vertices and 30 edges
385.907	and 20 faces, 20 tiles.
390.576	And vertices minus edges
390.576	plus faces still equals two.
395.191	And in fact, you could do this
395.191	any which way --
398.062	cover this thing with all kinds
398.062	of polygons and triangles
401.484	and mix them up.
402.828	And you take vertices minus edges
402.828	plus faces -- you'll get two.
406.131	Here's a different shape.
408.48	This is a torus, or the surface
408.48	of a doughnut: 16 vertices
413.754	covered by these rectangles,
418.53	Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.
421.238	It'll always come out to zero.
422.737	Every time you cover a torus
422.737	with squares or triangles
427.071	or anything like that,
427.071	you're going to get zero.
432.514	So, this is called
432.514	the Euler characteristic.
434.928	And it's what's called
434.928	a topological invariant.
438.849	It's pretty amazing.
440.029	No matter how you do it,
440.029	you're always get the same answer.
442.844	So that was the first sort of thrust,
442.844	from the mid-1700s,
449.167	into a subject which is now called
449.167	algebraic topology.
452.96	CA: And your own work
452.96	took an idea like this and moved it
455.967	into higher-dimensional theory,
458.44	higher-dimensional objects,
458.44	and found new invariances?
461.552	JS: Yes. Well, there were already
461.552	higher-dimensional invariants:
466.219	Pontryagin classes --
466.219	actually, there were Chern classes.
470.7	There were a bunch
470.7	of these types of invariants.
474.272	I was struggling to work on one of them
478.431	and model it sort of combinatorially,
482.658	instead of the way it was typically done,
485.704	and that led to this work
485.704	and we uncovered some new things.
490.087	But if it wasn't for Mr. Euler --
493.612	who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics
497.617	and had 13 children,
499.372	who he apparently would dandle on his knee
499.372	while he was writing --
505.838	if it wasn't for Mr. Euler, there wouldn't
505.838	perhaps be these invariants.
512.157	CA: OK, so that's at least given us
512.157	a flavor of that amazing mind in there.
516.804	Let's talk about Renaissance.
518.371	Because you took that amazing mind
518.371	and having been a code-cracker at the NSA,
524.251	you started to become a code-cracker
524.251	in the financial industry.
527.504	I think you probably didn't buy
527.504	efficient market theory.
530.218	Somehow you found a way of creating
530.218	astonishing returns over two decades.
536.629	The way it's been explained to me,
538.324	what's remarkable about what you did
538.324	wasn't just the size of the returns,
541.847	it's that you took them
541.847	with surprisingly low volatility and risk,
545.754	compared with other hedge funds.
547.602	So how on earth did you do this, Jim?
550.071	JS: I did it by assembling
550.071	a wonderful group of people.
554.206	When I started doing trading, I had
554.206	gotten a little tired of mathematics.
558.186	I was in my late 30s,
558.186	I had a little money.
562.133	I started trading and it went very well.
565.063	I made quite a lot of money
565.063	with pure luck.
567.835	I mean, I think it was pure luck.
569.525	It certainly wasn't mathematical modeling.
571.658	But in looking at the data,
571.658	after a while I realized:
575.513	it looks like there's some structure here.
578.09	And I hired a few mathematicians,
578.09	and we started making some models --
581.811	just the kind of thing we did back
581.811	at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses].
586.1	You design an algorithm,
586.1	you test it out on a computer.
588.957	Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on.
591.443	CA: Can we take a look at this?
592.946	Because here's a typical graph
592.946	of some commodity.
598.487	I look at that, and I say,
598.487	"""That's just a random, up-and-down walk --"
602.552	maybe a slight upward trend
602.552	"over that whole period of time."""
605.438	How on earth could you trade
605.438	looking at that,
607.575	and see something that wasn't just random?
609.925	JS: In the old days -- this is
609.925	kind of a graph from the old days,
613.196	commodities or currencies
613.196	had a tendency to trend.
617.504	Not necessarily the very light trend
617.504	you see here, but trending in periods.
623.583	And if you decided, OK,
623.583	I'm going to predict today,
627.663	by the average move in the past 20 days --
632.655	maybe that would be a good prediction,
632.655	and I'd make some money.
635.786	And in fact, years ago,
635.786	such a system would work --
641.418	not beautifully, but it would work.
643.833	You'd make money, you'd lose
643.833	money, you'd make money.
646.366	But this is a year's worth of days,
648.588	and you'd make a little money
648.588	during that period.
653.884	It's a very vestigial system.
656.525	CA: So you would test
656.525	a bunch of lengths of trends in time
660.078	and see whether, for example,
662.538	a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend
662.538	was predictive of what happened next.
666.043	JS: Sure, you would try all those things
666.043	and see what worked best.
673.515	Trend-following would
673.515	have been great in the '60s,
676.889	and it was sort of OK in the '70s.
679.045	By the '80s, it wasn't.
680.942	CA: Because everyone could see that.
683.783	So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?
687.046	JS: We stayed ahead of the pack
687.046	by finding other approaches --
693.202	shorter-term approaches to some extent.
697.107	The real thing was to gather
697.107	a tremendous amount of data --
700.478	and we had to get it by hand
700.478	in the early days.
704.08	We went down to the Federal Reserve
704.08	and copied interest rate histories
707.57	and stuff like that,
707.57	because it didn't exist on computers.
710.859	We got a lot of data.
712.526	And very smart people -- that was the key.
717.463	I didn't really know how to hire
717.463	people to do fundamental trading.
721.749	I had hired a few -- some made money,
721.749	some didn't make money.
724.722	I couldn't make a business out of that.
726.626	But I did know how to hire scientists,
728.692	because I have some taste
728.692	in that department.
732.105	So, that's what we did.
733.967	And gradually these models
733.967	got better and better,
737.222	and better and better.
738.581	CA: You're credited with doing
738.581	something remarkable at Renaissance,
741.819	which is building this culture,
741.819	this group of people,
744.444	who weren't just hired guns
744.444	who could be lured away by money.
747.61	Their motivation was doing
747.61	exciting mathematics and science.
751.86	JS: Well, I'd hoped that might be true.
754.283	But some of it was money.
757.887	CA: They made a lot of money.
759.304	JS: I can't say that no one came
759.304	because of the money.
761.865	I think a lot of them
761.865	came because of the money.
764.142	But they also came
764.142	because it would be fun.
766.187	CA: What role did machine learning
766.187	play in all this?
768.699	JS: In a certain sense,
768.699	what we did was machine learning.
772.879	You look at a lot of data, and you try
772.879	to simulate different predictive schemes,
779.194	until you get better and better at it.
781.4	It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself
781.4	the way we did things.
785.191	But it worked.
788.15	CA: So these different predictive schemes
788.15	can be really quite wild and unexpected.
792.233	I mean, you looked at everything, right?
794.171	You looked at the weather,
794.171	length of dresses, political opinion.
797.512	JS: Yes, length of dresses we didn't try.
800.373	CA: What sort of things?
802.454	JS: Well, everything.
803.636	Everything is grist for the mill --
803.636	except hem lengths.
808.852	Weather, annual reports,
811.176	quarterly reports, historic data itself,
811.176	volumes, you name it.
815.932	Whatever there is.
817.107	We take in terabytes of data a day.
819.752	And store it away and massage it
819.752	and get it ready for analysis.
825.446	You're looking for anomalies.
826.852	You're looking for -- like you said,
829.829	the efficient market
829.829	hypothesis is not correct.
832.305	CA: But any one anomaly
832.305	might be just a random thing.
835.796	So, is the secret here to just look
835.796	at multiple strange anomalies,
839.478	and see when they align?
841.238	JS: Any one anomaly
841.238	might be a random thing;
844.475	however, if you have enough data
844.475	you can tell that it's not.
847.538	You can see an anomaly that's persistent
847.538	for a sufficiently long time --
852.512	the probability of it being
852.512	random is not high.
857.511	But these things fade after a while;
857.511	anomalies can get washed out.
862.393	So you have to keep on top
862.393	of the business.
864.837	CA: A lot of people look
864.837	at the hedge fund industry now
867.533	and are sort of ... shocked by it,
871.955	by how much wealth is created there,
874.151	and how much talent is going into it.
877.523	Do you have any worries
877.523	about that industry,
881.553	and perhaps the financial
881.553	industry in general?
883.991	Kind of being on a runaway train that's --
886.719	I don't know --
886.719	helping increase inequality?
890.773	How would you champion what's happening
890.773	in the hedge fund industry?
894.628	JS: I think in the last
894.628	three or four years,
897.26	hedge funds have not done especially well.
899.387	We've done dandy,
900.811	but the hedge fund industry as a whole
900.811	has not done so wonderfully.
904.836	The stock market has been on a roll,
904.836	going up as everybody knows,
909.762	and price-earnings ratios have grown.
913.231	So an awful lot of the wealth
913.231	that's been created in the last --
916.318	let's say, five or six years --
916.318	has not been created by hedge funds.
920.458	People would ask me,
920.458	"""What's a hedge fund?"""
923.703	"And I'd say, ""One and 20."""
925.987	Which means -- now it's two and 20 --
929.577	it's two percent fixed fee
929.577	and 20 percent of profits.
932.954	Hedge funds are all
932.954	different kinds of creatures.
935.33	CA: Rumor has it you charge
935.33	slightly higher fees than that.
939.339	JS: We charged the highest fees
939.339	in the world at one time.
942.444	Five and 44, that's what we charge.
945.694	CA: Five and 44.
947.116	So five percent flat,
950.374	You still made your investors
950.374	spectacular amounts of money.
953.181	JS: We made good returns, yes.
954.657	People got very mad:
954.657	"""How can you charge such high fees?"""
957.681	"I said, ""OK, you can withdraw."""
959.332	"But ""How can I get more?"""
959.332	was what people were --
962.174	(Laughter)
963.702	But at a certain point,
963.702	as I think I told you,
966.166	we bought out all the investors
966.166	because there's a capacity to the fund.
971.365	CA: But should we worry
971.365	about the hedge fund industry
974.093	attracting too much of the world's
974.093	great mathematical and other talent
979.555	to work on that, as opposed
979.555	to the many other problems in the world?
982.817	JS: Well, it's not just mathematical.
984.77	We hire astronomers and physicists
984.77	and things like that.
987.833	I don't think we should worry
987.833	about it too much.
990.288	It's still a pretty small industry.
993.454	And in fact, bringing science
993.454	into the investing world
999.475	has improved that world.
1001.658	It's reduced volatility.
1001.658	It's increased liquidity.
1005.752	Spreads are narrower because
1005.752	people are trading that kind of stuff.
1008.965	So I'm not too worried about Einstein
1008.965	going off and starting a hedge fund.
1014.478	CA: You're at a phase in your life now
1014.478	where you're actually investing, though,
1018.666	at the other end of the supply chain --
1022.424	you're actually boosting
1022.424	mathematics across America.
1026.552	This is your wife, Marilyn.
1028.441	You're working on
1028.441	philanthropic issues together.
1033.221	Tell me about that.
1034.408	JS: Well, Marilyn started --
1038.081	there she is up there,
1038.081	my beautiful wife --
1041.552	she started the foundation
1041.552	about 20 years ago.
1044.548	I think '94.
1045.723	I claim it was '93, she says it was '94,
1047.842	but it was one of those two years.
1050.437	(Laughter)
1052.596	We started the foundation,
1052.596	just as a convenient way to give charity.
1060.346	She kept the books, and so on.
1062.877	We did not have a vision at that time,
1062.877	but gradually a vision emerged --
1069.615	which was to focus on math and science,
1069.615	to focus on basic research.
1075.569	And that's what we've done.
1078.365	Six years ago or so, I left Renaissance
1078.365	and went to work at the foundation.
1084.744	So that's what we do.
1086.339	CA: And so Math for America
1086.339	is basically investing
1089.272	in math teachers around the country,
1091.934	giving them some extra income,
1091.934	giving them support and coaching.
1095.76	And really trying
1095.76	to make that more effective
1098.835	and make that a calling
1098.835	to which teachers can aspire.
1101.46	JS: Yeah -- instead of beating up
1101.46	the bad teachers,
1106.274	which has created morale problems
1106.274	all through the educational community,
1111.151	in particular in math and science,
1113.616	we focus on celebrating the good ones
1113.616	and giving them status.
1119.77	Yeah, we give them extra money,
1122.725	We have 800 math and science teachers
1122.725	in New York City in public schools today,
1127.216	as part of a core.
1129.054	There's a great morale among them.
1132.764	They're staying in the field.
1135.294	Next year, it'll be 1,000
1135.294	and that'll be 10 percent
1138.213	of the math and science teachers
1138.213	in New York [City] public schools.
1141.781	(Applause)
1147.71	CA: Jim, here's another project
1147.71	that you've supported philanthropically:
1151.144	Research into origins of life, I guess.
1153.565	What are we looking at here?
1155.536	JS: Well, I'll save that for a second.
1157.442	And then I'll tell you
1157.442	what you're looking at.
1159.628	Origins of life is a fascinating question.
1162.708	How did we get here?
1165.17	Well, there are two questions:
1166.965	One is, what is the route
1166.965	from geology to biology --
1172.857	how did we get here?
1174.262	And the other question is,
1174.262	what did we start with?
1176.65	What material, if any,
1176.65	did we have to work with on this route?
1179.776	Those are two very,
1179.776	very interesting questions.
1183.773	The first question is a tortuous path
1183.773	from geology up to RNA
1189.631	or something like that --
1189.631	how did that all work?
1191.913	And the other,
1191.913	what do we have to work with?
1194.325	Well, more than we think.
1196.12	So what's pictured there
1196.12	is a star in formation.
1201.836	Now, every year in our Milky Way,
1201.836	which has 100 billion stars,
1205.285	about two new stars are created.
1207.804	Don't ask me how, but they're created.
1210.298	And it takes them about a million
1210.298	years to settle out.
1214.132	So, in steady state,
1216.332	there are about two million stars
1216.332	in formation at any time.
1220.204	That one is somewhere
1220.204	along this settling-down period.
1224.067	And there's all this crap
1224.067	sort of circling around it,
1227.027	dust and stuff.
1229.479	And it'll form probably a solar system,
1229.479	or whatever it forms.
1232.526	But here's the thing --
1234.726	in this dust that surrounds a forming star
1241.098	have been found, now,
1241.098	significant organic molecules.
1247.958	Molecules not just like methane,
1247.958	but formaldehyde and cyanide --
1254.121	things that are the building blocks --
1254.121	the seeds, if you will -- of life.
1261.136	So, that may be typical.
1264.395	And it may be typical
1264.395	that planets around the universe
1271.353	start off with some of these
1271.353	basic building blocks.
1275.83	Now does that mean
1275.83	there's going to be life all around?
1278.569	Maybe.
1279.957	But it's a question
1279.957	of how tortuous this path is
1284.108	from those frail beginnings,
1284.108	those seeds, all the way to life.
1288.526	And most of those seeds
1288.526	will fall on fallow planets.
1293.742	CA: So for you, personally,
1295.175	finding an answer to this question
1295.175	of where we came from,
1297.921	of how did this thing happen,
1297.921	that is something you would love to see.
1301.603	JS: Would love to see.
1303.413	And like to know --
1304.927	if that path is tortuous enough,
1304.927	and so improbable,
1310.121	that no matter what you start with,
1310.121	we could be a singularity.
1315.336	But on the other hand,
1316.512	given all this organic dust
1316.512	that's floating around,
1320.014	we could have lots of friends out there.
1324.947	It'd be great to know.
1326.132	CA: Jim, a couple of years ago,
1326.132	I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk,
1329.636	and I asked him the secret of his success,
1332.497	and he said taking
1332.497	physics seriously was it.
1336.696	Listening to you, what I hear you saying
1336.696	is taking math seriously,
1340.723	that has infused your whole life.
1344.123	It's made you an absolute fortune,
1344.123	and now it's allowing you to invest
1348.71	in the futures of thousands and thousands
1348.71	of kids across America and elsewhere.
1353.567	Could it be that science actually works?
1356.449	That math actually works?
1359.245	JS: Well, math certainly works.
1359.245	Math certainly works.
1363.641	But this has been fun.
1364.863	Working with Marilyn and giving it away
1364.863	has been very enjoyable.
1369.833	CA: I just find it --
1369.833	it's an inspirational thought to me,
1372.793	that by taking knowledge seriously,
1372.793	so much more can come from it.
1376.824	So thank you for your amazing life,
1376.824	and for coming here to TED.
1379.866	Thank you.
1380.651	Jim Simons!
1381.806	(Applause)
