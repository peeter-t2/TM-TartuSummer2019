12.97	I am a plant geneticist.
15.292	I study genes that make plants
15.292	resistant to disease
18.867	and tolerant of stress.
21.189	In recent years,
23.465	millions of people around the world
23.465	have come to believe
26.367	that there's something sinister
26.367	about genetic modification.
30.5	Today, I am going to provide
30.5	a different perspective.
36.003	First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.
38.569	He's an organic farmer.
41.192	On his farm, he plants
41.192	a variety of different crops.
45.14	This is one of the many
45.14	ecological farming practices
48.181	he uses to keep his farm healthy.
51.664	Imagine some of the reactions we get:
54.822	"""Really? An organic farmer"
54.822	and a plant geneticist?
58.398	"Can you agree on anything?"""
61.439	Well, we can, and it's not difficult,
61.439	because we have the same goal.
66.415	We want to help nourish
66.415	the growing population
69.543	without further destroying
69.543	the environment.
72.283	I believe this is the greatest
72.283	challenge of our time.
77.066	Now, genetic modification is not new;
81.199	virtually everything we eat
81.199	has been genetically modified
85.169	in some manner.
87.264	Let me give you a few examples.
90.376	On the left is an image
92.657	of the ancient ancestor of modern corn.
97.208	You see a single roll of grain
97.208	that's covered in a hard case.
101.109	Unless you have a hammer,
103.64	teosinte isn't good for making tortillas.
108.655	Now, take a look at
108.655	the ancient ancestor of banana.
113.31	You can see the large seeds.
115.064	And unappetizing brussel sprouts,
118.5	and eggplant, so beautiful.
122.122	Now, to create these varieties,
124.305	breeders have used many different
124.305	genetic techniques over the years.
127.489	Some of them are quite creative,
129.053	like mixing two different species together
131.607	using a process called grafting
133.72	to create this variety
133.72	that's half tomato and half potato.
139.525	Breeders have also used
139.525	other types of genetic techniques,
144.076	such as random mutagenesis,
146.119	which induces uncharacterized mutations
149.509	into the plants.
151.808	The rice in the cereal
151.808	that many of us fed our babies
156.134	was developed using this approach.
159.957	Now, today, breeders have
159.957	even more options to choose from.
163.626	Some of them are extraordinarily precise.
167.364	I want to give you a couple examples
167.364	from my own work.
171.172	I work on rice, which is a staple food
171.172	for more than half the world's people.
177.047	Each year, 40 percent
177.047	of the potential harvest
180.181	is lost to pest and disease.
183.037	For this reason,
183.037	farmers plant rice varieties
186.167	that carry genes for resistance.
189.023	This approach has been used
189.023	for nearly 100 years.
192.761	Yet, when I started graduate school,
195.942	no one knew what these genes were.
198.195	It wasn't until the 1990s
198.195	that scientists finally uncovered
203.28	the genetic basis of resistance.
206.414	In my laboratory, we isolated a gene
206.414	for immunity to a very serious
211.174	bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.
213.937	We found we could engineer the gene
213.937	into a conventional rice variety
219.277	that's normally susceptible,
221.088	and you can see the two leaves
221.088	on the bottom here
223.526	are highly resistant to infection.
226.499	Now, the same month
226.499	that my laboratory published
229.888	our discovery on the rice immunity gene,
232.675	my friend and colleague Dave Mackill
232.675	stopped by my office.
236.274	"He said, ""Seventy million rice farmers"
236.274	"are having trouble growing rice."""
244.864	That's because their fields are flooded,
247.651	and these rice farmers are living
247.651	on less than two dollars a day.
252.272	Although rice grows well
252.272	in standing water,
255.824	most rice varieties will die
255.824	if they're submerged
258.634	for more than three days.
260.932	Flooding is expected
260.932	to be increasingly problematic
264.253	as the climate changes.
267.062	He told me that his graduate student
267.062	Kenong Xu and himself
271.497	were studying an ancient variety of rice
271.497	that had an amazing property.
276.466	It could withstand two weeks
276.466	of complete submergence.
282.178	He asked if I would be willing
282.178	to help them isolate this gene.
287.448	I said yes -- I was very excited,
287.448	because I knew if we were successful,
291.999	we could potentially help
291.999	millions of farmers grow rice
295.993	even when their fields were flooded.
299.453	Kenong spent 10 years
299.453	looking for this gene.
303.516	Then one day, he said,
305.513	"""Come look at this experiment."
305.513	"You've got to see it."""
309.135	I went to the greenhouse and I saw
310.992	that the conventional variety
310.992	that was flooded for 18 days had died,
316.292	but the rice variety that we
316.292	had genetically engineered
319.955	with a new gene we had discovered,
319.955	called Sub1, was alive.
324.459	Kenong and I were amazed and excited
326.944	that a single gene could have
326.944	this dramatic effect.
330.775	But this is just a greenhouse experiment.
334.417	Would this work in the field?
337.783	Now, I'm going to show you
337.783	a four-month time lapse video
340.523	taken at the International
340.523	Rice Research Institute.
343.565	Breeders there developed
343.565	a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene
348.59	using another genetic technique
348.59	called precision breeding.
352.226	On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,
354.826	and on the right
354.826	is the conventional variety.
358.471	Both varieties do very well at first,
360.933	but then the field is flooded for 17 days.
364.346	You can see the Sub1 variety does great.
367.271	In fact, it produces
367.271	three and a half times more grain
372.124	than the conventional variety.
375.468	I love this video
377.465	because it shows the power
377.465	of plant genetics to help farmers.
381.76	Last year, with the help
381.76	of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
385.15	three and a half million farmers
385.15	grew Sub1 rice.
389.26	(Applause)
393.439	Thank you.
397.168	Now, many people don't mind
397.168	genetic modification
401.31	when it comes to moving rice genes around,
404.05	rice genes in rice plants,
405.397	or even when it comes
405.397	to mixing species together
408.787	through grafting or random mutagenesis.
413.036	But when it comes to taking genes
413.036	from viruses and bacteria
418.214	and putting them into plants,
420.002	"a lot of people say, ""Yuck."""
423.299	Why would you do that?
425.458	The reason is that sometimes
425.458	it's the cheapest, safest,
428.221	and most effective technology
431.333	for enhancing food security
431.333	and advancing sustainable agriculture.
436.627	I'm going to give you three examples.
439.668	First, take a look at papaya.
439.668	It's delicious, right?
442.78	But now, look at this papaya.
445.287	This papaya is infected
445.287	with papaya ringspot virus.
449.49	In the 1950s, this virus
449.49	nearly wiped out the entire production
455.248	of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.
461.169	Many people thought
461.169	that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,
465.465	but then, a local Hawaiian,
468.529	a plant pathologist
468.529	named Dennis Gonsalves,
471.2	decided to try to fight this disease
471.2	using genetic engineering.
475.631	He took a snippet of viral DNA
475.631	and he inserted it
479.299	into the papaya genome.
481.412	This is kind of like a human
481.412	getting a vaccination.
484.686	Now, take a look at his field trial.
487.217	You can see the genetically
487.217	engineered papaya in the center.
490.839	It's immune to infection.
493.022	The conventional papaya around the outside
493.022	is severely infected with the virus.
498.65	Dennis' pioneering work is credited
498.65	with rescuing the papaya industry.
505.369	Today, 20 years later, there's still no
505.369	other method to control this disease.
510.134	There's no organic method.
510.134	There's no conventional method.
513.338	Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya
513.338	is genetically engineered.
517.588	Now, some of you may still feel a little
517.588	queasy about viral genes in your food,
522.463	but consider this:
524.6	The genetically engineered papaya
524.6	carries just a trace amount of the virus.
531.38	If you bite into an organic
531.38	or conventional papaya
534.77	that is infected with the virus,
537.625	you will be chewing on tenfold
537.625	more viral protein.
542.641	Now, take a look at this pest
542.641	feasting on an eggplant.
546.593	The brown you see is frass,
548.98	what comes out
548.98	the back end of the insect.
552.161	To control this serious pest,
555.365	which can devastate the entire
555.365	eggplant crop in Bangladesh,
560.891	Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides
564.327	two to three times a week,
567.694	sometimes twice a day,
567.694	when pest pressure is high.
572.408	But we know that some insecticides
572.408	are very harmful to human health,
576.448	especially when farmers and their families
580.035	cannot afford proper protection,
580.035	like these children.
584.4	In less developed countries,
584.4	it's estimated that 300,000 people
589.903	die every year because of
589.903	insecticide misuse and exposure.
595.313	Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists
595.313	decided to fight this disease
599.121	using a genetic technique that builds
599.121	on an organic farming approach.
604.373	Organic farmers like my husband Raoul
604.373	spray an insecticide called B.T.,
609.263	which is based on a bacteria.
612.239	This pesticide is very specific
612.239	to caterpillar pests,
618.067	and in fact, it's nontoxic
618.067	to humans, fish and birds.
621.643	It's less toxic than table salt.
624.754	But this approach
624.754	does not work well in Bangladesh.
627.332	That's because these insecticide sprays
629.746	are difficult to find, they're expensive,
631.999	and they don't prevent the insect
631.999	from getting inside the plants.
636.341	In the genetic approach, scientists
636.341	cut the gene out of the bacteria
639.545	and insert it directly into
639.545	the eggplant genome.
642.726	Will this work to reduce
642.726	insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?
646.116	Definitely.
647.555	Last season, farmers reported they were
647.555	able to reduce their insecticide use
652.106	by a huge amount, almost down to zero.
656.471	They're able to harvest
656.471	and replant for the next season.
660.7	Now, I've given you a couple examples
660.7	of how genetic engineering can be used
664.505	to fight pests and disease
666.293	and to reduce the amount of insecticides.
669.033	My final example is an example
672.4	where genetic engineering
672.4	can be used to reduce malnutrition.
678.024	In less developed countries,
	because of lack of Vitamin A.
685.239	More than half will die.
688.004	For this reason, scientists supported
688.004	by the Rockefeller Foundation
691.857	genetically engineered a golden rice
694.713	to produce beta-carotene,
694.713	which is the precursor of Vitamin A.
699.264	This is the same pigment
699.264	that we find in carrots.
702.589	Researchers estimate that just one cup
702.589	of golden rice per day
707.321	will save the lives
707.321	of thousands of children.
711.748	But golden rice is virulently opposed
713.958	by activists who are
713.958	against genetic modification.
716.918	Just last year,
718.528	activists invaded and destroyed
718.528	a field trial in the Philippines.
722.923	When I heard about the destruction,
725.339	I wondered if they knew that they
725.339	were destroying much more
729.1	than a scientific research project,
731.283	that they were destroying medicines
731.283	that children desperately needed
734.504	to save their sight and their lives.
737.967	Some of my friends and family still worry:
740.71	How do you know genes
740.71	in the food are safe to eat?
743.961	I explained the genetic engineering,
745.679	the process of moving
745.679	genes between species,
748.047	has been used for more than 40 years
750.857	in wines, in medicine,
750.857	in plants, in cheeses.
755.172	In all that time, there hasn't been
755.172	a single case of harm
758.296	to human health or the environment.
762.164	But I say, look, I'm not
762.164	asking you to believe me.
764.835	Science is not a belief system.
768.062	My opinion doesn't matter.
770.871	Let's look at the evidence.
773.681	After 20 years of careful study
773.681	and rigorous peer review
777.187	by thousands of independent scientists,
780.229	every major scientific organization
780.229	in the world has concluded
784.269	that the crops currently
784.269	on the market are safe to eat
787.891	and that the process
787.891	of genetic engineering
790.143	is no more risky than older methods
790.143	of genetic modification.
794.996	These are precisely the same
794.996	organizations that most of us trust
798.632	when it comes to other
798.632	important scientific issues
801.656	such as global climate change
801.656	or the safety of vaccines.
807.081	Raoul and I believe that, instead of
807.081	worrying about the genes in our food,
811.5	we must focus on how we can help
811.5	children grow up healthy.
815.192	We must ask if farmers
815.192	in rural communities can thrive,
818.327	and if everyone can afford the food.
820.951	We must try to minimize
820.951	environmental degradation.
824.642	What scares me most about
824.642	the loud arguments and misinformation
828.241	about plant genetics
829.797	is that the poorest people
829.797	who most need the technology
832.839	may be denied access because of
832.839	the vague fears and prejudices
836.577	of those who have enough to eat.
839.804	We have a huge challenge in front of us.
842.73	Let's celebrate scientific
842.73	innovation and use it.
846.515	It's our responsibility
848.465	to do everything we can to help
848.465	alleviate human suffering
851.902	and safeguard the environment.
853.736	Thank you.
855.988	(Applause)
857.915	Thank you.
860.493	Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued.
862.397	The people who argue against GMOs,
864.556	as I understand it, the core piece
864.556	comes from two things.
868.387	One, complexity and
868.387	unintended consequence.
871.277	Nature is this incredibly complex machine.
873.318	If we put out these brand new genes
873.318	that we've created,
875.902	that haven't been challenged
875.902	by years of evolution,
878.326	and they started mixing up
878.326	with the rest of what's going on,
881.233	couldn't that trigger some kind
881.233	of cataclysm or problem,
884.67	especially when you add in
884.67	the commercial incentive
887.241	that some companies have
887.241	to put them out there?
890.794	The fear is that those incentives
892.512	mean that the decision is not made
892.512	on purely scientific grounds,
896.246	and even if it was, that there would be
896.246	unintended consequences.
899.292	How do we know that there isn't
899.292	a big risk of some unintended consequence?
903.425	Often our tinkerings with nature
903.425	do lead to big, unintended consequences
907.302	and chain reactions.
908.997	Pamela Ronald: Okay,
908.997	so on the commercial aspects,
911.575	one thing that's really important
911.575	to understand is that,
914.245	in the developed world,
914.245	farmers in the United States,
916.911	almost all farmers, whether
916.911	they're organic or conventional,
919.732	they buy seed produced by seed companies.
921.83	So there's definitely a commercial
921.83	interest to sell a lot of seed,
924.932	but hopefully they're selling seed
924.932	that the farmers want to buy.
927.935	It's different in the
927.935	less developed world.
930.196	Farmers there cannot afford the seed.
932.309	These seeds are not being sold.
933.935	These seeds are being distributed freely
936.303	through traditional kinds
936.303	of certification groups,
941.365	so it is very important
941.365	in less developed countries
943.848	that the seed be freely available.
945.473	CA: Wouldn't some activists say that this
945.473	is actually part of the conspiracy?
949.097	This is the heroin strategy.
950.513	You seed the stuff,
950.513	and people have no choice
952.765	but to be hooked on these seeds forever?
954.704	PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories
954.704	for sure, but it doesn't work that way.
960.091	For example, the seed that's being
960.091	distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,
964.067	this is distributed freely
965.912	through Indian and Bangladeshi
965.912	seed certification agencies,
970.029	so there's no commercial interest at all.
972.444	The golden rice was developed through
972.444	support of the Rockefeller Foundation.
976.368	Again, it's being freely distributed.
978.365	There are no commercial profits
980.152	in this situation.
982.498	And now to address your other question
982.498	about, well, mixing genes,
985.771	aren't there some unintended consequences?
988.024	Absolutely -- every time
988.024	we do something different,
991.019	there's an unintended consequence,
992.8	but one of the points I was trying to make
994.827	is that we've been doing
994.827	kind of crazy things to our plants,
998.159	mutagenesis using radiation
998.159	or chemical mutagenesis.
1002.257	This induces thousands
1002.257	of uncharacterized mutations,
1006.204	and this is even a higher risk
1006.204	of unintended consequence
1010.128	than many of the modern methods.
1011.916	And so it's really important
1011.916	not to use the term GMO
1015.051	because it's scientifically meaningless.
1017.767	I feel it's very important to talk
1017.767	about a specific crop
1022.109	and a specific product, and think about
1022.109	the needs of the consumer.
1025.431	CA: So part of what's happening here
1025.431	is that there's a mental model
1028.608	in a lot of people that nature is nature,
1028.608	and it's pure and pristine,
1032.46	and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.
1034.697	It's making something that's pure
1034.697	dangerous in some way,
1038.343	and I think you're saying
1038.343	that that whole model
1040.684	just misunderstands how nature is.
1042.797	Nature is a much more chaotic
1042.797	interplay of genetic changes
1046.698	that have been happening
