0.703	[The must-watch TED Talks of 2016]
4.351	[Sam Harris: Can we build AI
4.351	without losing control over it?]
6.89	At a certain point,
8.265	we will build machines
8.265	that are smarter than we are.
10.641	And once we have machines
10.641	that are smarter than we are,
12.589	they will begin to improve themselves.
14.32	We're in the process
14.32	of building some sort of god.
16.999	Now would be a good time
16.999	to make sure it's a god we can live with.
21.07	[Jennifer Kahn: Gene editing
21.07	can wipe out mosquitoes forever]
22.352	Gene drives have risks,
22.352	and those need to be discussed.
25.187	But malaria exists now
25.187	and kills 1,000 people a day.
29.09	Remember that.
30.632	It can be frightening to act,
30.632	but sometimes, not acting is worse.
35.54	[Jamila Raqib: The secret
35.54	to effective nonviolent resistance]
37.883	We're not going to end war
39.322	by telling people
39.322	that violence is morally wrong.
42.052	Instead, we must offer them a tool
44.049	that's at least as powerful
44.049	and as effective as violence.
47.915	[Alexander Betts: Here's how
47.915	we can fix the refugee system]
49.808	Rather than seeing refugees
51.14	as inevitably dependent
51.14	upon humanitarian assistance,
54.424	we need to provide them
54.424	with opportunities for human flourishing.
58.455	[Adam Foss: A prosecutor's vision for justice]
60.531	Every day, thousands of times a day,
62.419	prosecutors around the United States
62.419	wield power so great
65.262	that it can bring about catastrophe
66.787	as quickly as it can bring about
66.787	opportunity, intervention, support
72.06	and yes, even love.
75.465	[Dalia Mogahed: What do you think
75.465	when you look at me?]
77.493	What will you choose
77.493	at this time of fear and bigotry?
82.754	Will you play it safe?
85.252	Or will you join those who say,
85.252	"""We are better than that?"""
90.378	[Tim Urban: Inside the mind
90.378	of a procrastinator]
91.605	Both brains have a Rational
91.605	Decision-Maker in them,
94.014	but the procrastinator's brain
94.014	also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
98.523	Now, what does this mean
98.523	for the procrastinator?
100.132	Well, it means everything's fine,
100.132	until this happens.
103.981	[Allan Adams: The discovery
103.981	of gravitational waves]
106.104	Two black holes,
106.104	the densest thing in the universe,
109.133	one with a mass of 29 Suns
109.133	and one with a mass of 36 Suns,
114.181	whirling around each other
117.947	And we know it because we heard it.
120.661	[Kenneth Lacovara: Hunting for dinosaurs
120.661	showed me our place in the universe]
123.488	Why study the ancient past?
123.488	Because it gives us perspective.
127.122	The dinosaurs died
127.122	in the world's fifth mass extinction,
130.316	snuffed out in a cosmic accident
130.316	through no fault of their own.
134.173	They didn't have a choice.
135.718	We, on the other hand, do have a choice.
139.765	[Camille A. Brown: The visual
139.765	history of social dance]
142.213	Why do we dance?
143.689	To move, to let loose, to express.
147.483	Why do we dance together?
149.338	To heal, to remember,
151.555	"to say: ""We speak a common language."
154.236	"We exist, and we are free."""
