12.96	I was a new mother
15.2	and a young rabbi
16.48	in the spring of 2004
18.36	and the world was in shambles.
21.24	Maybe you remember.
22.52	Every day, we heard devastating reports
22.52	from the war in Iraq.
25.68	There were waves of terror
25.68	rolling across the globe.
29.56	It seemed like humanity
29.56	was spinning out of control.
33	I remember the night that I read
34.88	about the series of coordinated bombings
37.04	in the subway system in Madrid,
39.76	and I got up and I walked over to the crib
41.84	where my six-month-old baby girl
44.28	lay sleeping sweetly,
46.16	and I heard the rhythm of her breath,
48.52	and I felt this sense of urgency
48.52	coursing through my body.
52.12	We were living through a time
52.12	of tectonic shifts in ideologies,
56.2	in politics, in religion, in populations.
58.88	Everything felt so precarious.
61.48	And I remember thinking,
62.76	"""My God, what kind of world"
62.76	did we bring this child into?
66.96	And what was I as a mother
66.96	and a religious leader
70.04	willing to do about it?
74.84	Of course, I knew it was clear
77.64	that religion would be
77.64	a principle battlefield
80.56	in this rapidly changing landscape,
83.04	and it was already clear
84.76	that religion was a significant
84.76	part of the problem.
88.12	The question for me was,
89.4	could religion
89.4	also be part of the solution?
92.48	Now, throughout history,
94.12	people have committed
94.12	horrible crimes and atrocities
97.36	in the name of religion.
100.16	And as we entered the 21st century,
102.64	it was very clear that religious extremism
102.64	was once again on the rise.
107.76	Our studies now show
109.04	that over the course
109.04	of the past 15, 20 years,
112.32	hostilities and religion-related violence
114.48	have been on the increase
114.48	all over the world.
117.44	But we don't even need
117.44	the studies to prove it,
119.72	because I ask you,
119.72	how many of us are surprised today
122.92	when we hear the stories
122.92	of a bombing or a shooting,
126.72	when we later find out
126.72	that the last word that was uttered
129.56	before the trigger is pulled
129.56	or the bomb is detonated
132.4	is the name of God?
134.04	It barely raises an eyebrow today
136.72	when we learn that yet another person
138.68	has decided to show his love of God
141.24	by taking the lives of God's children.
144.68	In America, religious extremism
147.12	looks like a white,
147.12	antiabortion Christian extremist
151.68	walking into Planned Parenthood
151.68	in Colorado Springs
154.92	and murdering three people.
156.8	It also looks like a couple
159.08	inspired by the Islamic State
160.92	walking into an office party
160.92	in San Bernardino and killing 14.
165.56	And even when religion-related extremism
165.56	does not lead to violence,
170.4	it is still used
170.4	as a political wedge issue,
173.44	cynically leading people
173.44	to justify the subordination of women,
177.56	the stigmatization of LGBT people,
180.04	racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.
184.32	This ought to concern deeply
186.44	those of us who care
186.44	about the future of religion
189.4	and the future of faith.
191.64	We need to call this what it is:
194.04	a great failure of religion.
197.12	But the thing is, this isn't even the only
197.12	challenge that religion faces today.
204.04	At the very same time
205.8	that we need religion
205.8	to be a strong force against extremism,
209.44	it is suffering
209.44	from a second pernicious trend,
212.48	what I call religious routine-ism.
215.84	This is when our institutions
215.84	and our leaders
218.44	are stuck in a paradigm
218.44	that is rote and perfunctory,
222.24	devoid of life, devoid of vision
224.32	and devoid of soul.
226.52	Let me explain what I mean like this.
228.92	One of the great blessings
228.92	of being a rabbi
231.72	is standing under the chuppah,
231.72	under the wedding canopy, with a couple,
236.4	and helping them proclaim publicly
238.68	and make holy the love
238.68	that they found for one another.
241.96	I want to ask you now, though,
243.92	to think maybe from your own experience
245.84	or maybe just imagine it
247.28	about the difference
247.28	between the intensity of the experience
250.2	under the wedding canopy,
251.96	and maybe the experience
251.96	of the sixth or seventh anniversary.
255.2	(Laughter)
257.68	And if you're lucky enough
257.68	to make it 16 or 17 years,
261.6	if you're like most people,
261.6	you probably wake up in the morning
264.6	realizing that you forgot to make
264.6	a reservation at your favorite restaurant
268.16	and you forgot so much as a card,
269.8	and then you just hope and pray
269.8	that your partner also forgot.
273.959	Well, religious ritual and rites
276.6	were essentially designed
276.6	to serve the function of the anniversary,
280.16	to be a container in which
280.16	we would hold on to the remnants
284.2	of that sacred, revelatory encounter
287.12	that birthed the religion
287.12	in the first place.
289.24	The problem is that after a few centuries,
291.76	the date remains on the calendar,
294.68	but the love affair is long dead.
297.56	That's when we find ourselves
297.56	in endless, mindless repetitions
301.88	of words that don't mean anything to us,
304.12	rising and being seated
304.12	because someone has asked us to,
307.88	holding onto jealously guarded doctrine
310.8	that's completely and wildly out of step
310.8	with our contemporary reality,
314.68	engaging in perfunctory practice
317.24	simply because that's the way
317.24	things have always been done.
322.08	Religion is waning in the United States.
325.6	Across the board,
325.6	churches and synagogues and mosques
329.56	are all complaining
331.96	about how hard it is to maintain relevance
336	for a generation of young people
336	who seem completely uninterested,
340.16	not only in the institutions
340.16	that stand at the heart of our traditions
343.84	but even in religion itself.
346.44	And what they need to understand
349.28	is that there is today
349.28	a generation of people
352.04	who are as disgusted by the violence
352.04	of religious extremism
355.92	as they are turned off
357.64	by the lifelessness
357.64	of religious routine-ism.
362.44	Of course there is
362.44	a bright spot to this story.
366.96	Given the crisis of these two
366.96	concurrent trends in religious life,
371.28	about 12 or 13 years ago,
371.28	I set out to try to determine
375	if there was any way
376.56	that I could reclaim the heart
376.56	of my own Jewish tradition,
380.76	to help make it meaningful
380.76	and purposeful again
383.4	in a world on fire.
385.52	I started to wonder,
386.96	what if we could harness
386.96	some of the great minds of our generation
391.12	and think in a bold and robust
391.12	and imaginative way again
395.12	about what the next iteration
395.12	of religious life would look like?
398.24	Now, we had no money,
398.24	no space, no game plan,
401.32	but we did have email.
402.8	So my friend Melissa and I
402.8	sat down and we wrote an email
406.52	which we sent out
406.52	to a few friends and colleagues.
409.4	It basically said this:
411.24	"""Before you bail on religion,"
414.44	why don't we come together
414.44	this Friday night
416.64	and see what we might make
416.64	"of our own Jewish inheritance?"""
421.28	We hoped maybe 20 people would show up.
423.92	It turned out 135 people came.
427	They were cynics and seekers,
429.56	atheists and rabbis.
431.32	Many people said that night
431.32	that it was the first time
433.88	that they had a meaningful religious
433.88	experience in their entire lives.
438.2	And so I set out to do the only
438.2	rational thing
440.56	that someone would do
440.56	in such a circumstance:
442.72	I quit my job and tried to build
442.72	this audacious dream,
447.68	a reinvented, rethought religious life
451.52	"which we called ""IKAR,"""
453.76	"which means ""the essence"""
453.76	"or ""the heart of the matter."""
456.96	Now, IKAR is not alone
459.08	out there in the religious
459.08	landscape today.
461.64	There are Jewish and Christian
461.64	and Muslim and Catholic religious leaders,
465.48	many of them women, by the way,
467.8	who have set out to reclaim
467.8	the heart of our traditions,
471.84	who firmly believe that now is the time
471.84	for religion to be part of the solution.
477.6	We are going back
477.6	into our sacred traditions
480.08	and recognizing that all of our traditions
482.84	contain the raw material
482.84	to justify violence and extremism,
487.16	and also contain the raw material
487.16	to justify compassion,
492	coexistence and kindness --
494.44	that when others choose to read our texts
494.44	as directives for hate and vengeance,
499.28	we can choose to read those same texts
501.92	as directives for love
501.92	and for forgiveness.
506.12	I have found now
507.64	in communities as varied
507.64	as Jewish indie start-ups on the coasts
512.88	to a woman's mosque,
514.8	to black churches
514.8	in New York and in North Carolina,
518.48	to a holy bus loaded with nuns
520.8	that traverses this country
520.8	with a message of justice and peace,
525.039	that there is a shared religious ethos
527.919	that is now emerging in the form
527.919	of revitalized religion in this country.
533.6	And while the theologies
533.6	and the practices vary very much
537.76	between these independent communities,
540.48	what we can see are some common,
540.48	consistent threads between them.
543.92	I'm going to share with you
543.92	four of those commitments now.
547.8	The first is wakefulness.
550.04	We live in a time today
551.96	in which we have unprecedented access
554.48	to information about every global tragedy
557.4	that happens on every corner
557.4	of this Earth.
559.88	Within 12 hours, 20 million people
562.6	saw that image
562.6	of Aylan Kurdi's little body
565.2	washed up on the Turkish shore.
567.6	We all saw this picture.
570.92	We saw this picture
570.92	of a five-year-old child
573.28	pulled out of the rubble
573.28	of his building in Aleppo.
577.16	And once we see these images,
579.56	we are called to a certain kind of action.
582.52	My tradition tells a story
582.52	of a traveler who is walking down a road
586.96	when he sees a beautiful house on fire,
590.52	"and he says, ""How can it be"
590.52	that something so beautiful would burn,
594.08	"and nobody seems to even care?"""
596.64	So too we learn that our world is on fire,
599.76	and it is our job to keep our hearts
599.76	and our eyes open,
603.52	and to recognize
603.52	that it's our responsibility
606.08	to help put out the flames.
608.68	This is extremely difficult to do.
610.76	Psychologists tell us that the more
610.76	we learn about what's broken in our world,
614.56	the less likely we are to do anything.
616.92	It's called psychic numbing.
618.52	We just shut down at a certain point.
621.52	Well, somewhere along the way,
621.52	our religious leaders forgot
625.6	that it's our job
625.6	to make people uncomfortable.
628.92	It's our job to wake people up,
631	to pull them out of their apathy
633.16	and into the anguish,
634.64	and to insist that we do
634.64	what we don't want to do
638.12	and see what we do not want to see.
641.48	Because we know
641.48	that social change only happens --
643.88	(Applause)
644.96	when we are awake enough
644.96	to see that the house is on fire.
649.76	The second principle is hope,
651.72	and I want to say this about hope.
653.364	Hope is not naive,
655.52	and hope is not an opiate.
657.48	Hope may be the single
657.48	greatest act of defiance
661.56	against a politics of pessimism
663.92	and against a culture of despair.
666.36	Because what hope does for us
668.28	is it lifts us out of the container
671.08	that holds us and constrains us
671.08	from the outside,
674.8	"and says, ""You can dream"
674.8	and think expansively again.
678.56	"That they cannot control in you."""
681.76	I saw hope made manifest
681.76	in an African-American church
684.8	in the South Side of Chicago this summer,
687.36	where I brought my little girl,
689.04	who is now 13
690.28	and a few inches taller than me,
692	to hear my friend Rev. Otis Moss preach.
695.56	That summer, there had already been
695.56	3,000 people shot
701.08	between January and July in Chicago.
705.04	We went into that church
705.04	and heard Rev. Moss preach,
708.16	and after he did,
710.12	this choir of gorgeous women,
714.4	stood up and began to sing.
717.2	"""I need you. You need me."
720.36	"I love you. I need you to survive."""
723.72	And I realized in that moment
725.44	that this is what religion
725.44	is supposed to be about.
729.04	It's supposed to be about
729.04	giving people back a sense of purpose,
733.76	a sense of hope,
735.28	a sense that they and their dreams
735.28	fundamentally matter in this world
740.24	that tells them
740.24	that they don't matter at all.
743.76	The third principle
743.76	is the principle of mightiness.
746.56	There's a rabbinic tradition
746.56	that we are to walk around
749.24	with two slips of paper in our pockets.
751.56	"One says, ""I am but dust and ashes."""
755	It's not all about me.
756.72	I can't control everything,
756.72	and I cannot do this on my own.
760.96	The other slip of paper says,
760.96	"""For my sake the world was created."""
765.16	Which is to say it's true
765.16	that I can't do everything,
769.04	but I can surely do something.
772.16	I can forgive.
773.84	I can love.
775.56	I can show up.
777.08	I can protest.
778.72	I can be a part of this conversation.
781.92	We even now have a religious ritual,
784.8	a posture,
786.04	that holds the paradox
786.04	between powerlessness and power.
789.76	In the Jewish community,
791	the only time of year
791	that we prostrate fully to the ground
794.32	is during the high holy days.
796	It's a sign of total submission.
798.84	Now in our community,
798.84	when we get up off the ground,
801.92	we stand with our hands
801.92	raised to the heavens,
805.44	"and we say, ""I am strong,"
805.44	I am mighty, and I am worthy.
811.08	I can't do everything,
811.08	"but I can do something."""
815.72	In a world that conspires
815.72	to make us believe that we are invisible
820.64	and that we are impotent,
822.2	religious communities and religious ritual
824.96	can remind us that for whatever
824.96	amount of time we have here on this Earth,
828.6	whatever gifts and blessings
828.6	we were given,
831.08	whatever resources we have,
832.84	we can and we must use them
835.2	to try to make the world
835.2	a little bit more just
837.8	and a little bit more loving.
839.92	The fourth and final
839.92	is interconnectedness.
842.88	A few years ago, there was a man
842.88	walking on the beach in Alaska,
846.16	when he came across a soccer ball
848.12	that had some Japanese
848.12	letters written on it.
850.64	He took a picture of it
850.64	and posted it up on social media,
854	and a Japanese teenager contacted him.
856.72	He had lost everything in the tsunami
856.72	that devastated his country,
860.52	but he was able
860.52	to retrieve that soccer ball
863.24	after it had floated
863.24	all the way across the Pacific.
866.28	How small our world has become.
869.08	It's so hard for us to remember
869.08	how interconnected we all are
873.92	as human beings.
876.72	And yet, we know
878.72	that it is systems of oppression
881.44	that benefit the most
881.44	from the lie of radical individualism.
885.56	Let me tell you how this works.
887.4	I'm not supposed to care
889.36	when black youth are harassed by police,
891.84	because my white-looking Jewish kids
894.16	probably won't ever get pulled over
894.16	for the crime of driving while black.
898.08	Well, not so, because
898.08	this is also my problem.
902.12	And guess what?
902.12	Transphobia and Islamophobia
905.32	and racism of all forms,
905.32	those are also all of our problems.
908.88	And so too is anti-Semitism
908.88	all of our problems.
912.36	Because Emma Lazarus was right.
914.08	(Applause)
919.56	Emma Lazarus was right
919.56	when she said until all of us are free,
922.92	we are none of us free.
924.88	We are all in this together.
927.8	And now somewhere at the intersection
927.8	of these four trends,
931.32	of wakefulness and hope
931.32	and mightiness and interconnectedness,
936.08	there is a burgeoning, multifaith
936.08	justice movement in this country
940.64	that is staking a claim on a countertrend,
942.92	saying that religion can and must be
942.92	a force for good in the world.
948.08	Our hearts hurt from
948.08	the failed religion of extremism,
952.12	and we deserve more
952.12	than the failed religion of routine-ism.
956.36	It is time for religious leaders
956.36	and religious communities
960.16	to take the lead in the spiritual
960.16	and cultural shift
963.56	that this country and the world
963.56	so desperately needs --
967.28	a shift toward love,
969.44	toward justice, toward equality
969.44	and toward dignity for all.
973.36	I believe that our children
973.36	deserve no less than that.
977.36	Thank you.
978.6	(Applause)
