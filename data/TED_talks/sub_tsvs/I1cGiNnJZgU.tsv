12.798	So have you ever wondered
12.798	what it would be like
15.924	to live in a place with no rules?
19.653	That sounds pretty cool.
20.828	(Laughter)
21.89	You wake up one morning, however,
23.551	and you discover that the reason
23.551	there are no rules
26.055	is because there's no government,
26.055	and there are no laws.
29.44	In fact, all social institutions
29.44	have disappeared.
34.738	So there's no schools,
36.095	there's no hospitals,
37.285	there's no police,
38.617	there's no banks,
39.976	there's no athletic clubs,
42.554	there's no utilities.
44.704	Well, I know a little bit
44.704	about what this is like,
47.92	because when I was
47.92	a medical student in 1999,
50.793	I worked in a refugee camp
50.793	in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.
56.829	When the war was over,
58.003	I got permission -- unbelievably --
58.003	from my medical school
61.085	to take some time off
62.26	and follow some of the families
62.26	that I had befriended in the camp
66.455	back to their village in Kosovo,
68.902	and understand how they navigated
68.902	life in this postwar setting.
76.331	Postwar Kosovo
76.331	was a very interesting place
79.575	because NATO troops were there,
82.768	mostly to make sure
82.768	the war didn't break out again.
86.428	But other than that,
86.428	it was actually a lawless place,
89.945	and almost every social institution,
89.945	both public and private,
93.234	had been destroyed.
95.439	So I can tell you
99.352	that when you go into one
99.352	of these situations and settings,
103.891	it is absolutely thrilling ...
107.722	for about 30 minutes,
109.098	because that's about how long it takes
109.098	before you run into a situation
113.794	where you realize
113.794	how incredibly vulnerable you are.
119.54	For me, that moment came
119.54	when I had to cross the first checkpoint,
123.331	and I realized as I drove up
125.148	that I would be negotiating passage
125.148	through this checkpoint
129.27	with a heavily armed individual
131.508	who, if he decided to shoot me
131.508	right then and there,
134.918	actually wouldn't be doing
134.918	anything illegal.
138.811	But the sense of vulnerability that I had
138.811	was absolutely nothing
143.698	in comparison to the vulnerability
143.698	of the families that I got to know
147.62	over that year.
149.304	You see, life in a society
149.304	where there are no social institutions
154.441	is riddled with danger and uncertainty,
157.909	and simple questions like,
157.909	"""What are we going to eat tonight?"""
162.245	are very complicated to answer.
166.559	Questions about security,
166.559	when you don't have any security systems,
170.933	are terrifying.
172.375	Is that altercation I had
172.375	with the neighbor down the block
175.162	going to turn into a violent episode
175.162	that will end my life
178	or my family's life?
179.843	Health concerns
179.843	when there is no health system
182.793	are also terrifying.
185.114	I listened as many families
185.114	had to sort through questions like,
188.756	"""My infant has a fever."
188.756	"What am I going to do?"""
192.243	"""My sister, who is pregnant,"
192.243	is bleeding. What should I do?
195.947	"Who should I turn to?"""
197.145	"""Where are the doctors,"
197.145	where are the nurses?
199.299	If I could find one, are they trustworthy?
202.084	How will I pay them?
202.084	"In what currency will I pay them?"""
204.841	"""If I need medications,"
204.841	where will I find them?
208.664	If I take those medications,
208.664	"are they actually counterfeits?"""
211.583	And on and on.
214.765	So for life in these settings,
217.161	the dominant theme,
217.161	the dominant feature of life,
221.665	is the incredible vulnerability
221.665	that people have to manage
225.632	day in and day out,
227.205	because of the lack of social systems.
230.063	And it actually turns out
231.323	that this feature of life
231.323	is incredibly difficult to explain
235.374	and be understood by people
235.374	who are living outside of it.
239.041	I discovered this when I left Kosovo.
243.701	I came back to Boston,
243.701	I became a physician,
246.93	I became a global public
246.93	health policy researcher.
250.965	I joined the Harvard Medical School
252.779	and Brigham and Women's Hospital
252.779	Division of Global Health.
255.645	And I, as a researcher,
256.903	really wanted to get started
256.903	on this problem right away.
259.581	"I was like, ""How do we reduce"
259.581	the crushing vulnerability
263.173	of people living in these types
263.173	of fragile settings?
266.968	Is there any way
266.968	we can start to think about
269.461	how to protect and quickly recover
272.19	the institutions
272.19	that are critical to survival,
275.023	"like the health system?"""
276.56	And I have to say,
276.56	I had amazing colleagues.
280.402	But one interesting thing about it was,
282.312	this was sort of an unusual
282.312	question for them.
284.82	They were kind of like,
284.82	"""Oh, if you work in war,"
287.153	doesn't that mean
287.153	you work on refugee camps,
289.426	and you work on documenting
289.426	"mass atrocities?"" --"
291.882	which is, by the way, very,
291.882	very, very important.
295.297	So it took me a while to explain
295.297	why I was so passionate about this issue,
300.475	until about six years ago.
302.19	That's when this landmark study
304.279	that looked at and described
304.279	the public health consequences of war
308.412	was published.
309.778	They came to an incredible,
309.778	provocative conclusion.
315.671	These researchers concluded
318.344	that the vast majority of death
318.344	and disability from war
321.842	happens after the cessation of conflict.
324.499	So the most dangerous time to be a person
324.499	living in a conflict-affected state
329.561	is after the cessation of hostilities;
331.628	it's after the peace deal has been signed.
333.653	It's when that political solution
333.653	has been achieved.
336.238	That seems so puzzling,
336.238	but of course it's not,
339.796	because war kills people
339.796	by robbing them of their clinics,
345.625	of their hospitals,
346.826	of their supply chains.
348.714	Their doctors are targeted, are killed;
348.714	they're on the run.
352.329	And more invisible
352.329	and yet more deadly is the destruction
356.272	of the health governance institutions
356.272	and their finances.
360.938	So this is really not
360.938	surprising at all to me.
365.61	But what is surprising
365.61	and somewhat dismaying,
368.184	is how little impact this insight has had,
372.182	in terms of how we think
372.182	about human suffering and war.
376.499	Let me give you a couple examples.
378.926	Last year, you may remember,
380.861	Ebola hit the West African
380.861	country of Liberia.
385.981	There was a lot of reporting
385.981	about this group, Doctors Without Borders,
389.873	sounding the alarm
389.873	and calling for aid and assistance.
393.322	But not a lot of that reporting
393.322	answered the question:
397.208	Why is Doctors Without Borders
397.208	even in Liberia?
399.784	Doctors Without Borders
399.784	is an amazing organization,
402.484	dedicated and designed to provide
402.484	emergency care in war zones.
407.461	Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 --
410.302	that was 11 years
410.302	before Ebola even struck.
414.452	When Ebola struck Liberia,
416.196	there were less than 50 doctors
416.196	in the entire country
419.847	of 4.5 million people.
422.529	Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia
424.737	because Liberia still doesn't really have
424.737	a functioning health system,
429.833	When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,
433.169	the outpouring of international
433.169	aid was phenomenal.
436.726	But did you know that only
436.726	two percent of that funding
440.421	went to rebuild
440.421	Haitian public institutions,
443.287	including its health sector?
445.697	From that perspective,
447.138	Haitians continue to die
447.138	from the earthquake even today.
451.663	I recently met this gentleman.
453.764	This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.
455.866	He's the Minister of Health
455.866	in the northern autonomous region of Iraq,
459.726	in Kurdistan.
461.181	Here he is announcing
461.181	that in the last nine months,
465.087	his country, his region, has increased
465.087	from four million people
469.153	to five million people.
470.709	That's a 25 percent increase.
472.601	Thousands of these new arrivals
472.601	have experienced incredible trauma.
476.979	His doctors are working
482.867	His budget has not increased
482.867	by 25 percent;
485.714	it has decreased by 20 percent,
488.133	as funding has flowed to security concerns
488.133	and to short-term relief efforts.
493.569	When his health sector fails --
495.197	and if history is any guide, it will --
497.634	how do you think that's going to influence
499.704	the decision making
499.704	of the five million people in his region
502.96	as they think about
502.96	whether they should flee
505.803	that type of vulnerable living situation?
509.55	So as you can see,
509.55	this is a frustrating topic for me,
512.508	and I really try to understand:
514.034	Why the reluctance to protect and support
517.582	indigenous health systems
517.582	and security systems?
521.242	I usually tier two concerns,
521.242	two arguments.
524.747	The first concern is about corruption,
526.958	and the concern that people
526.958	in these settings are corrupt
529.701	and they are untrustworthy.
532.076	And I will admit that I have met
532.076	unsavory characters
535.161	working in health sectors
535.161	in these situations.
537.541	But I will tell you that the opposite
537.541	is absolutely true
541.265	in every case I have worked on,
543.319	from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo,
543.319	to Haiti, to Liberia --
547.156	I have met inspiring people,
549.279	who, when the chips were down
549.279	for their country,
551.798	they risked everything
551.798	to save their health institutions.
555.131	The trick for the outsider
555.131	who wants to help
558.503	is identifying who those individuals are,
561.431	and building a pathway for them to lead.
563.763	That is exactly what happened
563.763	in Afghanistan.
567.534	One of the unsung and untold
567.534	success stories
570.887	of our nation-building effort
570.887	in Afghanistan
573.829	involved the World Bank in 2002
573.829	investing heavily
577.349	in identifying, training and promoting
577.349	Afghani health sector leaders.
583.869	These health sector leaders
583.869	have pulled off an incredible feat
587.746	in Afghanistan.
589.142	They have aggressively increased
589.142	access to health care
593.113	for the majority of the population.
595.153	They are rapidly improving
595.153	the health status
597.381	of the Afghan population,
598.676	which used to be the worst in the world.
601.765	In fact, the Afghan Ministry
601.765	of Health does things
604.611	that I wish we would do in America.
606.331	They use things like data to make policy.
608.727	It's incredible.
609.936	(Laughter)
612.352	The other concern I hear a lot about is:
614.305	"""We just can't afford it,"
614.305	we just don't have the money.
616.931	"It's just unsustainable."""
619.239	I would submit to you
619.239	that the current situation
621.996	and the current system we have
623.755	is the most expensive, inefficient system
623.755	we could possibly conceive of.
627.817	The current situation
627.817	is that when governments like the US --
631.219	or, let's say, the collection
631.219	of governments
633.307	that make up the European Commission --
635.205	every year, they spend 15 billion dollars
637.878	on just humanitarian and emergency
637.878	and disaster relief worldwide.
641.908	That's nothing about foreign aid,
641.908	that's just disaster relief.
645.895	Ninety-five percent of it
645.895	goes to international relief agencies,
650.964	that then have to import resources
650.964	into these areas,
655.325	and knit together some type
655.325	of temporary health system, let's say,
659.738	which they then dismantle and send away
659.738	when they run out of money.
664.001	So our job, it turns out, is very clear.
669.001	We, as the global health
669.001	community policy experts,
673.8	our first job is to become experts
673.8	in how to monitor
679.369	the strengths and vulnerabilities
679.369	of health systems
681.84	in threatened situations.
684.431	And that's when we see doctors fleeing,
686.465	when we see health resources drying up,
688.426	when we see institutions crumbling --
690.885	that's the emergency.
692.522	That's when we need to sound the alarm
692.522	and wave our arms.
695.656	OK?
697.074	Not now.
698.249	Everyone can see that's an emergency,
698.249	they don't need us to tell them that.
702.942	Number two:
704.905	places like where I work at Harvard
704.905	need to take their cue
708.266	from the World Bank experience
708.266	in Afghanistan,
710.488	and we need to -- and we will --
712.169	build robust platforms to support
712.169	health sector leaders like these.
718.291	These people risk their lives.
720.017	I think we can match their courage
720.017	with some support.
724.245	Number three:
725.423	we need to reach out
725.423	and make new partnerships.
728.025	At our global health center,
729.923	we have launched a new initiative
729.923	with NATO and other security policy makers
733.959	to explore with them what they can do
733.959	to protect health system institutions
739.349	during deployments.
741.088	We want them to see
742.652	that protecting health systems
742.652	and other critical social institutions
747.376	is an integral part of their mission.
749.843	It's not just about avoiding
749.843	collateral damage;
753.004	it's about winning the peace.
756.545	But the most important partner
756.545	we need to engage is you,
760.152	the American public,
760.152	and indeed, the world public.
763.608	Because unless you understand
763.608	the value of social institutions,
769.328	like health systems
769.328	in these fragile settings,
772.886	you won't support efforts to save them.
775.158	You won't click on that article
777.58	"that talks about ""Hey, all those"
777.58	doctors are on the run in country X.
782.57	I wonder what that means.
785.011	I wonder what that means
786.887	for that health system's ability
786.887	"to, let's say, detect influenza."""
791.673	"""Hmm, it's probably not good."""
791.673	That's what I'd tell you.
795.59	Up on the screen,
796.778	I've put up my three favorite American
796.778	institution defenders and builders.
803.666	Over here is George C. Marshall,
806.575	he was the guy that proposed
806.575	the Marshall Plan
809.428	to save all of Europe's economic
809.428	institutions after World War II.
814.119	And this Eleanor Roosevelt.
816.496	Her work on human rights
816.496	really serves as the foundation
819.666	for all of our international
819.666	human rights organizations.
823.15	Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin,
825.214	who did many things
825.214	in terms of creating institutions,
828.446	but was the midwife of our constitution.
832.402	And I would say to you
834.15	that these are folks who, when our
834.15	country was threatened,
837.927	or our world was threatened,
839.958	they didn't retreat.
841.285	They didn't talk about building walls.
843.65	They talked about building institutions
843.65	to protect human security,
849.828	for their generation and also for ours.
853.014	And I think our generation
853.014	should do the same.
856.503	Thank you.
857.687	(Applause)
