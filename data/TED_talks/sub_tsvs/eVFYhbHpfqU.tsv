12.423	Do you remember
12.423	these glow-in-the-dark little stars
14.997	which you had on the ceiling
14.997	when you were a boy or a girl?
17.911	Yes?
19.145	It is light.
20.365	It is pure light.
21.573	I think I stared at them way too long
23.499	when I was a five-year-old, you know?
25.296	It's so beautiful:
26.544	no energy bill, no maintenance.
29.325	It is there.
30.553	So two years ago, we went back to the lab,
32.634	making it more durable,
32.634	more light-emitting,
34.956	with the experts.
36.36	And at the same time,
36.36	we got a request from this guy --
40.065	Van Gogh, the famous
40.065	Van Gogh Foundation --
42.667	who wanted to celebrate
42.667	his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.
47.052	And they came to me and asked,
48.941	"""Can you make a place"
48.941	where he feels more alive again
52.766	"in the Netherlands?"""
53.996	And I liked that question a lot,
55.574	so in way,
56.752	we sort of started to connect
56.752	these two different worlds.
60.847	This is how my brain works,
62.168	by the way.
63.342	(Laughter)
64.417	I would love to keep on
64.417	doing this for an hour,
66.652	but OK --
67.827	(Laughter)
68.859	And this is the result that we made:
70.661	a bicycle path which charges
70.661	at daytime via the sun
73.407	and glows at night, up to eight hours.
75.553	(Applause)
76.805	Thank you.
78.155	... hinting towards a future
78.155	which should be energy friendly
82.546	and linking up the local grounds
84.266	as Van Gogh literally walked
84.266	and lived there in 1883.
87.717	And you can go there every night
87.717	for free, no ticket needed.
91.048	People experience the beauty
91.048	of cycling through the starry night,
94.278	thinking about green energy and safety.
96.327	I want to create places
96.327	where people feel connected again.
100.586	And it was somehow great
100.586	to make these projects happen
103.698	with the industry,
103.698	with the infrastructure companies.
106.568	So when these sheikhs of Qatar
106.568	started to call:
108.881	"""How much for 10 kilometers?"""
110.406	(Laughter)
111.445	Yeah, really, that's a weird call
111.445	you're going to get.
114.181	But it's fascinating
115.365	that this is not just a sort
115.365	of one-off, nice-to-have special.
118.797	I think this kind of creative thinking,
118.797	these kinds of connections --
122.244	it's the new economy.
123.452	The World Economic Forum,
123.452	the think tank in Geneva,
126.223	did an interview
126.223	with a lot of smart people
128.646	all around the world,
129.826	"asking, ""What are the top 10 skills"
129.826	"you and I need to become successful?"""
134.672	And what is interesting,
134.672	what you see here:
137.016	it's not about money
139.579	or being really good in C++,
142.504	although these are great skills
142.504	to have, I have to admit.
145.545	But look at number three, creativity;
147.925	number two, critical thinking;
150.161	number one, complex problem-solving --
153.285	all the things a robot or a computer
153.285	is really bad at.
158.482	And this makes me very optimistic,
158.482	very hopeful for the new world,
162.159	that as we will live
162.159	in this hyper-technological world,
165.059	our human skills --
166.525	our desire for empathy,
167.893	our desire for curiosity,
170.183	our desire for beauty --
171.922	will be more appreciated again,
173.68	and we will live in a world
173.68	where creativity is our true capital.
178.604	And a creative process like that --
181.087	I don't know how it works for you,
182.81	but in my brain, it always starts
182.81	with a question:
185.525	Why?
187.704	Why does a jellyfish emit light?
190.251	Or a firefly?
191.63	Or why do be accept pollution?
193.9	This is from my room
193.9	in Beijing three years ago.
196.173	Left image is a good day -- Saturday.
198.341	I can see the cars
198.341	and the people, the birds;
200.586	life is OK in a dense urban city.
203.202	And on the right image --
205.058	holy moly.
206.882	Pollution -- complete layers.
208.919	I couldn't even see
208.919	the other side of the city.
211.651	And this image made me really sad.
213.511	This is not the bright future
213.511	we envision here at TED --
216.584	this is the horror.
217.781	We live five to six years shorter;
219.556	children have lung cancer
219.556	when they're six years old.
222.648	And so in a weird, beautiful way,
225.158	I, at that moment, became inspired
225.158	by Beijing smog.
229.669	And the governments all around the world
229.669	are fighting their war on smog,
233.176	but I wanted to make something
233.176	within the now.
235.838	So we decided to build
235.838	the largest smog vacuum cleaner
239.66	in the world.
241.095	It sucks up polluted air, cleans it
243.068	and then releases it.
244.516	And we built the first one.
246.685	So it sucks up 30,000
246.685	cubic meters per hour,
249.346	cleans it on the nano level --
249.346	the PM2.5, PM10 particles --
253.157	using very little electricity,
255.156	and then releases the clean air,
257.647	so we have parks, playgrounds,
257.647	which are 55 to 75 percent more clean
263.124	than the rest of the city.
264.715	(Applause)
266.408	Yes!
267.86	(Applause)
269.401	And every month or so,
272.322	it opens like a spaceship --
276.237	like a Marilyn Monroe with the --
276.237	well, you know what.
278.92	Anyway.
280.134	(Laughter)
281.234	So this ...
282.708	this is the stuff we are capturing.
285.13	This is Beijing smog.
287.58	This is in our lungs right now.
289.222	If you live next to a highway,
289.222	it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.
292.668	Are we insane?
293.842	When did we say yes to that?
295.848	And we had buckets
295.848	of this disgusting material
299.115	in our studio,
300.683	and on a Monday morning,
300.683	we were discussing, we were like,
303.516	"""Shit, what should we do with it?"
303.516	"Should we throw it away?"""
306.39	"Like, ""Help!"""
307.569	And then we realized:
307.569	no, no, no, no, no --
309.754	waste should not exist.
310.97	Waste for the one should be
310.97	food for the other.
314.17	So, here, maybe show it around.
316.69	Do not put this in your coffee.
318.277	(Laughter)
319.312	And we realized that 42 percent
319.312	is made out of carbon,
322.347	and carbon, of course,
322.347	under high pressure,
324.539	you get ...
326.691	diamonds.
328.119	So, inspired by that,
328.119	we compress it for 30 minutes --
332.274	(Cracking sound)
333.385	and make smog-free rings.
335.489	(Laughter)
336.536	And so by sharing -- yeah, really!
338.536	And so by sharing a ring,
340.198	you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air
342.828	to the city the tower is in.
344.517	(Applause)
345.553	I have one here --
346.807	(Applause)
348.011	A little floating cube.
351.983	I will give one to you.
353.157	I'm not going to propose, don't worry.
355.411	(Laughter)
356.723	Are we good?
357.912	You can show it around.
359.178	And we put this online --
359.178	Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.
362.612	And people started to preorder it,
364.425	but more importantly,
364.425	they started to prepay it.
367.279	So the finance we made with the jewelry
367.279	helped us to realize,
370.672	to build the first tower.
372.693	And that's powerful.
373.867	So the waste the activator,
373.867	it was the enabler.
376.528	Also, the feedback from the community --
378.562	this is a wedding couple from India,
380.402	where he proposed to her
380.402	with the smog-free ring
382.887	as a sign of true beauty,
384.184	as a sign of hope.
386.077	And she said yes.
387.939	(Laughter)
389.678	I love this image so much
389.678	for a lot of different reasons.
393.185	(Laughter)
394.436	And right now, the project
394.436	is touring through China,
397.155	actually with the support
397.155	of China's central government.
400.051	So the first goal is to create
400.051	local clean-air parks,
403.168	and that works already quite well --
407.476	And at the same time,
408.849	we team up with the NGOs,
410.27	with the governors,
411.458	with the students,
412.682	with the tech people,
413.857	"to say, ""Hey, what do we need to do"
413.857	"to make a whole city smog-free?"""
417.236	It's about the dream of clean air.
419.043	We do workshops. New ideas pop up.
421.313	These are smog-free bicycles
421.313	which -- I'm Dutch, yes? --
424.131	"I have this ""bicycle DNA"""
424.131	inside of me somewhere.
426.594	And so it sucks up polluted air,
428.268	it cleans it and releases it,
429.851	in the fight against the car,
431.368	in the celebration of the bicycle.
433.273	And so right now, we're working
433.273	"on a sort of ""package deal,"" so to speak,"
437.458	"where we say, ""Smog-free towers,"
437.458	"smog-free rings."""
440.736	We go to the mayors
440.736	or the governors of this world,
443.256	"and say, ""We can guarantee"
443.256	a short-term reduction of pollution
447.383	between 20 and 40 percent.
449.49	"Please sign here right now."""
451.411	Yes?
452.586	(Applause)
454.337	Thank you.
455.511	(Applause)
457.365	So it's all about connecting
457.365	new technology with creative thinking.
462.316	And if you start thinking about that,
464.282	there is so much you can imagine,
466.467	so much more you can do.
468.014	We worked on dance floors
468.014	which produce electricity
471.349	when you dance on them.
472.632	We did the design for that -- 2008.
475.134	So it moves eight or nine millimeters,
477.153	produces 25 watts.
478.855	The electricity that we generate
478.855	is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.
482.876	So some of the sustainability
482.876	is about doing more,
485.564	not about doing less.
487.251	But also on a larger scale,
488.761	the Netherlands, where I'm
488.761	from, we live below sea level.
492.234	So because of these beauties --
494.536	the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers,
494.536	built by hand in 1932 --
500	we live with the water,
501.791	we fight with the water,
503.345	we try to find harmony,
505.515	but sometimes we forget.
507.983	"And therefore, we made ""Waterlicht,"""
509.95	a combination of LEDs and lenses,
512.194	which show how high
512.194	the water level would be --
514.832	global change --
516.679	if we stop.
518.228	If, today, we all go home and we say,
520.953	"""Oh, whatever, somebody else"
520.953	"will do it for us,"""
523.398	or we'll wait for government or whomever.
525.442	You know, we're not going to do that.
527.332	It goes wrong.
528.515	And we placed this in public spaces
528.515	all around the world.
531.255	Thousands of people showed up.
532.87	(Applause)
534.142	Thank you.
535.937	You're too nice, you're too nice.
535.937	That's not good for a designer.
539.522	So thousands of people showed up,
541.546	and some, actually, were scared.
543.34	And they left; they experienced
543.34	the floods in 1953.
546.705	And others were mesmerized.
548.121	Can we make floating cities?
549.964	Can we generate electricity
549.964	from the change in tides?
553.864	So I think it's so important
553.864	to make experiences --
556.839	collective experiences --
558.397	where people feel connected
558.397	with a vision, with a future
562.075	and trigger what is possible.
564.642	At the same time,
566.036	you know, these kinds of things --
566.036	they're not easy, yes?
570.554	It's a struggle.
571.832	And what I experienced in my life
573.522	is that a lot of people say
573.522	they want innovation,
575.945	and they want the next
575.945	and the new, the future.
578.567	But the moment you present a new idea,
581.628	there's this weird tendency
581.628	to reply to every new idea
586.038	starting with two words.
589.288	Which are?
590.494	(Audience guesses)
591.864	"No, not ""How much?"" It's more annoying."
594.07	(Laughter)
595.102	What is it, guys?
596.279	Or you're really blessed people?
596.279	That's really good.
598.844	"""Yes, but."" Very good."
600.064	"""Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too"
600.064	cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,
603.78	it's too beautiful, it's too ugly,
603.78	"it cannot be done, it already exists."""
607.287	I heard everything about the same project
609.398	in the same week.
610.582	And I got really, really annoyed.
612.535	I got a bit of gray hair, started to dress
612.535	in black like a true architect.
616.797	(Laughter)
619.269	And one morning I woke up
619.269	"and I said, ""Daan, stop."
622.751	This is dragging you down.
624.126	You have to do something with this.
625.905	You have to use it
625.905	"as an ingredient, as a component."""
628.624	And so we decided to build,
630.613	"to realize the famous ""Yes, but"" chair."
634.62	(Laughter)
638.281	And this is an existing chair
638.281	by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.
641.659	"But we gave it a little ""update,"""
644.467	"a little ""hack,"" so to speak."
646.822	We placed a little voice-recognition
646.822	element right here.
650.92	So the moment you sit on that chair,
653.741	and you say those two horrible,
657.051	creative-destructive,
657.051	annoying little words --
661.525	(Laughter)
662.64	you get a short --
664.319	(Laughter)
665.966	but pretty intense
667.563	little shock on the back side
667.563	of your bottom.
670.402	(Laughter)
671.583	(Applause)
672.996	And --
674.191	(Applause)
675.243	and that works; yeah, that works.
677.065	Some clients have left us,
677.065	they got really mad.
679.864	Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.
681.869	And, of course, we also
681.869	apply it to ourselves.
684.28	But ladies and gentlemen,
684.28	let's not be afraid.
687.45	Let's be curious, yes?
689.245	And, you know, walking
689.245	through TED in these days
691.787	and hearing the other speakers
693.51	and feeling the energy of the crowd,
695.954	I was remembering this quote
695.954	of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,
700.277	who once famously said,
702.316	"""On spacecraft earth,"
704.219	there are no passengers.
705.759	"We are all crew."""
708.846	And I think this so beautiful.
711.088	This is so beautiful!
712.564	We're not just consumers; we're makers:
714.834	we make decisions,
716.064	we make new inventions,
717.259	we make new dreams.
718.896	And I think
720.081	if we start implementing
720.081	that kind of thinking even more
724.17	within today,
726.371	there's still a whole new world
726.371	to be explored.
730.365	All right, thank you.
731.823	(Applause)
733.975	Thank you.
735.149	(Applause)
