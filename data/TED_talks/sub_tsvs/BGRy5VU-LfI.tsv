12.36	It's a pleasure to be here
13.779	in Edinburgh, Scotland,
15.728	the birthplace of the needle and syringe.
18.891	Less than a mile from here in this direction,
21.732	in 1853 a Scotsman
23.706	filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe.
26.134	His name was Alexander Wood,
28.236	and it was at the Royal College of Physicians.
31.987	This is the patent.
34.465	What blows my mind when I look at it even today
37.176	is that it looks almost identical
39.349	to the needle in use today.
41.106	Yet, it's 160 years old.
44.666	So we turn to the field of vaccines.
47.161	Most vaccines are delivered with
49.39	the needle and syringe, 
49.39	this 160-year-old technology.
53.534	And credit where it's due -- on many levels,
55.445	vaccines are a successful technology.
59.096	After clean water and sanitation,
62.985	vaccines are the one technology that has increased
67.259	our life span the most.
69.789	That's a pretty hard act to beat.
72.264	But just like any other technology,
74.057	vaccines have their shortcomings,
75.902	and the needle and syringe
78.538	is a key part within that narrative --
80.741	this old technology.
83.67	So let's start with the obvious:
85.969	Many of us don't like the needle and syringe.
89.451	I share that view.
91.365	However, 20 percent of the population
94.557	have a thing called needle phobia.
96.833	That's more than disliking the needle;
98.594	that is actively avoiding being vaccinated
101.063	because of needle phobia.
102.927	And that's problematic in terms 
102.927	of the rollout of vaccines.
106.934	Now, related to this is another key issue,
109.079	which is needlestick injuries.
111.412	And the WHO has figures
113.384	that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year
117.219	take place due to cross-contamination
119.611	with needlestick injuries.
120.895	These are early deaths that take place.
123.577	Now, these are two things that 
123.577	you probably may have heard of,
126.558	but there are two other shortcomings
128.438	of the needle and syringe you 
128.438	may not have heard about.
130.922	One is it could be holding back
132.903	the next generation of vaccines
134.382	in terms of their immune responses.
136.671	And the second is that it could be responsible
139.598	for the problem of the cold chain
139.598	that I'll tell you about as well.
144.21	I'm going to tell you about some work
145.792	that my team and I are doing in Australia
147.86	at the University of Queensland
149.601	on a technology designed to 
149.601	tackle those four problems.
153.998	And that technology is called the Nanopatch.
158.343	Now, this is a specimen of the Nanopatch.
164.817	To the naked eye
166.466	it just looks like a square
168.65	smaller than a postage stamp,
171.549	but under a microscope
174.215	what you see are thousands of tiny projections
176.533	that are invisible to the human eye.
178.754	And there's about 4,000 projections
180.511	on this particular square compared to the needle.
183.907	And I've designed those projections
186.551	to serve a key role, which is to 
186.551	work with the skin's immune system.
190.601	So that's a very important function
192.996	tied in with the Nanopatch.
194.452	Now we make the Nanopatch
196.699	with a technique
199.236	called deep reactive ion etching.
201.615	And this particular technique 
201.615	is one that's been borrowed
203.659	from the semiconductor industry,
205.286	and therefore is low cost
207.122	and can be rolled out in large numbers.
209.316	Now we dry-coat vaccines to 
209.316	the projections of the Nanopatch
214.382	and apply it to the skin.
216.201	Now, the simplest form of application
220.757	is using our finger,
222.779	but our finger has some limitations,
225.399	so we've devised an applicator.
227.483	And it's a very simple device --
228.97	you could call it a sophisticated finger.
231.088	It's a spring-operated device.
234.128	What we do is when we apply 
234.128	the Nanopatch to the skin as so --
237.95	(Click) --
239.819	immediately a few things happen.
242.736	So firstly, the projections on the Nanopatch
246.783	breach through the tough outer layer
248.46	and the vaccine is very quickly released --
250.506	within less than a minute, in fact.
252.854	Then we can take the Nanopatch off
255.42	and discard it.
257.358	And indeed we can make 
257.358	a reuse of the applicator itself.
263.244	So that gives you an idea of the Nanopatch,
265.98	and immediately you can see some key advantages.
268.556	We've talked about it being needle-free --
270.496	these are projections that you can't even see --
272.73	and, of course, we get around
274.441	the needle phobia issue as well.
277.514	Now, if we take a step back and think about
279.445	these other two really important advantages:
282.841	One is improved immune 
282.841	responses through delivery,
286.877	and the second is getting rid of the cold chain.
290.471	So let's start with the first one, 
290.471	this immunogenicity idea.
292.843	It takes a little while to get our heads around,
294.849	but I'll try to explain it in simple terms.
298.578	So I'll take a step back and explain to you
300.428	how vaccines work in a simple way.
303.838	So vaccines work by introducing into our body
306.415	a thing called an antigen
308.518	which is a safe form of a germ.
311.695	Now that safe germ, that antigen,
313.715	tricks our body into mounting an immune response,
317.22	learning and remembering 
317.22	how to deal with intruders.
321.288	When the real intruder comes along
323.656	the body quickly mounts an immune response
325.417	to deal with that vaccine
327.053	and neutralizes the infection.
328.953	So it does that well.
330.643	Now, the way it's done today 
330.643	with the needle and syringe,
332.98	most vaccines are delivered that way --
335.431	with this old technology and the needle.
337.115	But it could be argued that the needle 
337.115	is holding back our immune responses;
342.264	it's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin.
345.706	To describe this idea,
348.702	we need to take a journey through the skin,
351.191	starting with one of those projections
353.815	and applying the Nanopatch to the skin.
356.26	And we see this kind of data.
358.66	Now, this is real data --
360.469	that thing that we can see there is one projection
362.815	from the Nanopatch that's been applied to the skin
365.271	and those colors are different layers.
367.196	Now, to give you an idea of scale,
368.48	if the needle was shown here, it would be too big.
370.42	It would be 10 times bigger
371.945	than the size of that screen,
371.945	going 10 times deeper as well.
374.867	It's off the grid entirely.
377.082	You can see immediately that we 
377.082	have those projections in the skin.
380.275	That red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin,
383.327	but the brown layer and the magenta layer
385.841	are jammed full of immune cells.
389.022	As one example, in the brown layer
390.878	there's a certain type of cell 
390.878	called a Langerhans cell --
393.232	every square millimeter of our body
395.445	is jammed full of those Langerhans cells,
398.465	those immune cells, and 
398.465	there's others shown as well
400.568	that we haven't stained in this image.
402.363	But you can immediately see that the Nanopatch
404.543	achieves that penetration indeed.
406.28	We target thousands upon thousands 
406.28	of these particular cells
409.709	just residing within a hair's width
412.047	of the surface of the skin.
415.328	Now, as the guy that's invented
415.328	this thing and designed it to do that,
419.09	I found that exciting. But so what?
422.526	So what if you've targeted cells?
424.478	In the world of vaccines, what does that mean?
427.281	The world of vaccines is getting better.
429.702	It's getting more systematic.
431.426	However, you still don't really know
433.648	if a vaccine is going to work
435.392	until you roll your sleeves up
436.731	and vaccinate and wait.
438.946	It's a gambler's game even today.
441.648	So, we had to do that gamble.
444.16	We obtained an influenza vaccine,
446.64	we applied it to our Nanopatches
448.256	and we applied the Nanopatches to the skin,
450.727	and we waited --
452.46	and this is in the live animal.
454.288	We waited a month,
456.139	and this is what we found out.
457.951	This is a data slide showing the immune responses
460.276	that we've generated with a Nanopatch
462.599	compared to the needle and syringe into muscle.
466.375	So on the horizontal axis we have 
466.375	the dose shown in nanograms.
469.969	On the vertical axis we have 
469.969	the immune response generated,
472.674	and that dashed line indicates 
472.674	the protection threshold.
478.189	If we're above that line it's considered protective;
480.642	if we're below that line it's not.
483.568	So the red line is mostly below that curve
486.136	and indeed there's only one point that 
486.136	is achieved with the needle that's protective,
489.66	and that's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms.
492.869	But notice immediately the distinctly different curve
495.402	that we achieve with the blue line.
498.466	That's what's achieved with the Nanopatch;
500.366	the delivered dose of the Nanopatch is
502.103	a completely different immunogenicity curve.
505.464	That's a real fresh opportunity.
507.297	Suddenly we have a brand new lever
509.675	in the world of vaccines.
511.203	We can push it one way,
512.714	where we can take a vaccine 
512.714	that works but is too expensive
515.305	and can get protection
516.964	with a hundredth of the dose 
516.964	compared to the needle.
519.788	That can take a vaccine that's suddenly 
523.839	and that's particularly important 
523.839	within the developing world.
527.019	But there's another angle to this as well --
528.886	you can take vaccines that currently don't work
531.938	and get them over that line
533.134	and get them protective.
535.092	And certainly in the world of vaccines
537.32	that can be important.
538.54	Let's consider the big three:
540.038	HIV, malaria, tuberculosis.
542.735	They're responsible for about 
542.735	7 million deaths per year,
545.327	and there is no adequate vaccination 
545.327	method for any of those.
548.534	So potentially, with this new lever 
548.534	that we have with the Nanopatch,
551.066	we can help make that happen.
552.901	We can push that lever to help get those 
552.901	candidate vaccines over the line.
557.771	Now, of course, we've worked within my lab
559.589	with many other vaccines that have attained
561.379	similar responses and similar curves to this,
564.197	what we've achieved with influenza.
567.962	I'd like to now switch to talk about
570.121	another key shortcoming of today's vaccines,
573.453	and that is the need to maintain the cold chain.
576.873	As the name suggests -- the cold chain --
579.547	it's the requirements of keeping 
579.547	a vaccine right from production
582.487	all the way through to when the vaccine is applied,
585.163	to keep it refrigerated.
588.261	Now, that presents some logistical challenges
591.507	but we have ways to do it.
594.497	This is a slightly extreme case in point
599.033	but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges,
601.516	in particular in resource-poor settings,
603.906	of what's required to get vaccines
607.192	refrigerated and maintain the cold chain.
608.91	If the vaccine is too warm the vaccine breaks down,
612.724	but interestingly it can be too cold
614.931	and the vaccine can break down as well.
617.492	Now, the stakes are very high.
620.874	The WHO estimates that within Africa,
623.409	up to half the vaccines used there
626.06	are considered to not be working properly
627.913	because at some point the 
627.913	cold chain has fallen over.
630.903	So it's a big problem, and it's tied 
630.903	in with the needle and syringe
633.469	because it's a liquid form vaccine, and 
633.469	when it's liquid it needs the refrigeration.
638.702	A key attribute of our Nanopatch
641.213	is that the vaccine is dry,
643.186	and when it's dry it doesn't need refrigeration.
645.975	Within my lab we've shown that we can keep
648.387	the vaccine stored at 23 degrees Celsius
651.067	for more than a year without 
651.067	any loss in activity at all.
654.783	That's an important improvement.
657.17	(Applause)
663.77	We're delighted about it as well.
666.233	And the thing about it is that
666.233	we have well and truly proven
670.529	the Nanopatch within the laboratory setting.
673.192	And as a scientist, I love that and I love science.
677.165	However, as an engineer,
679.673	as a biomedical engineer
681.386	and also as a human being,
683.589	I'm not going to be satisfied
684.82	until we've rolled this thing 
684.82	out, taken it out of the lab
687.513	and got it to people in large numbers
689.944	and particularly the people that need it the most.
693.48	So we've commenced this particular journey,
696.182	and we've commenced this 
696.182	journey in an unusual way.
698.843	We've started with Papua New Guinea.
701.832	Now, Papua New Guinea is an example 
701.832	of a developing world country.
707.637	It's about the same size as France,
710.773	but it suffers from many of the key barriers
713.608	existing within the world of today's vaccines.
717.676	There's the logistics:
719.289	Within this country there are only 800 
719.289	refrigerators to keep vaccines chilled.
723.647	Many of them are old, like this one in Port Moresby,
723.647	many of them are breaking down
727.94	and many are not in the Highlands 
727.94	where they are required.
730.856	That's a challenge.
732.319	But also, Papua New Guinea has the 
732.319	world's highest incidence of HPV,
737.502	human papillomavirus, the 
737.502	cervical cancer [risk factor].
741.733	Yet, that vaccine is not available in large numbers
744.434	because it's too expensive.
746.348	So for those two reasons, with 
746.348	the attributes of the Nanopatch,
749.094	we've got into the field and 
749.094	worked with the Nanopatch,
751.709	and taken it to Papua New Guinea
754.16	and we'll be following that up shortly.
758.143	Now, doing this kind of work is not easy.
761.625	It's challenging,
762.973	but there's nothing else in 
762.973	the world I'd rather be doing.
766.297	And as we look ahead
768.32	I'd like to share with you a thought:
772.062	It's the thought of a future where
776.07	the 17 million deaths per year
778.003	that we currently have due to infectious disease
780.347	is a historical footnote.
782.981	And it's a historical footnote that has been achieved
785.077	by improved, radically improved vaccines.
788.545	Now standing here today in front of you
790.828	at the birthplace of the needle and syringe,
792.501	a device that's 160 years old,
795.298	I'm presenting to you an alternative approach
797.634	that could really help make that happen --
799.883	and it's the Nanopatch with its attributes 
799.883	of being needle-free, pain-free,
803.865	the ability for removing the cold chain
803.865	and improving the immunogenicity.
808.296	Thank you.
810.249	(Applause)
