13.166	For much of the past century,
14.882	architecture was under the spell
14.882	of a famous doctrine.
18.396	"""Form follows function"" had become"
18.396	modernity's ambitious manifesto
22.015	and detrimental straitjacket,
24.292	as it liberated architecture
24.292	from the decorative,
27.285	but condemned it to utilitarian rigor
27.285	and restrained purpose.
32.418	Of course, architecture is about function,
35.148	but I want to remember a rewriting
35.148	of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,
38.839	and I want to propose
38.839	a completely different quality.
43.14	If form follows fiction,
45.556	we could think of architecture
45.556	and buildings as a space of stories --
49.763	stories of the people that live there,
52.267	of the people that work
52.267	in these buildings.
55.088	And we could start to imagine
55.088	the experiences our buildings create.
59.965	In this sense, I'm interested in fiction
62.592	not as the implausible but as the real,
66.194	as the reality of what architecture means
68.216	for the people that live
68.216	in it and with it.
71.666	Our buildings are prototypes,
71.666	ideas for how the space of living
75.289	or how the space of working
75.289	could be different,
78.728	and what a space of culture
78.728	or a space of media could look like today.
83.246	Our buildings are real;
83.246	they're being built.
85.35	They're an explicit engagement
85.35	in physical reality
88.233	and conceptual possibility.
92.013	I think of our architecture
92.013	as organizational structures.
96.276	At their core is indeed
96.276	structural thinking, like a system:
99.928	How can we arrange things
99.928	in both a functional
103.103	and experiential way?
106.188	How can we create structures
106.188	that generate a series
108.88	of relationships and narratives?
111.672	And how can fictive stories
113.287	of the inhabitants and users
113.287	of our buildings
116.125	script the architecture,
118.101	while the architecture scripts
118.101	those stories at the same time?
122.428	And here comes the second term into play,
124.437	"what I call ""narrative hybrids"" --"
126.699	structures of multiple
126.699	simultaneous stories
129.468	that unfold throughout
129.468	the buildings we create.
132.706	So we could think of architecture
132.706	as complex systems of relationships,
137.59	both in a programmatic and functional way
140.898	and in an experiential
140.898	and emotive or social way.
147.187	This is the headquarters
147.187	for China's national broadcaster,
149.958	which I designed together
149.958	with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.
153.882	When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002,
153.882	the city planners showed us this image:
158.045	a forest of several hundred skyscrapers
160.236	to emerge in the central
160.236	business district,
162.331	except at that time,
162.331	only a handful of them existed.
165.389	So we had to design in a context
165.389	that we knew almost nothing about,
168.676	except one thing:
168.676	it would all be about verticality.
172.366	Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --
172.366	it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,
177.169	the top always the best,
177.169	the bottom the worst,
179.609	and the taller you are,
179.609	the better, so it seems.
183.661	And we wanted to ask ourselves,
185.194	could a building be about
185.194	a completely different quality?
188.011	Could it undo this hierarchy,
188.011	and could it be about a system
191.988	that is more about collaboration,
191.988	rather than isolation?
195.236	So we took this needle
195.236	and bent it back into itself,
198.314	into a loop of interconnected activities.
201.866	Our idea was to bring all aspects
201.866	of television-making
205.169	into one single structure: news,
205.169	program production, broadcasting,
209.18	research and training, administration --
211.426	all into a circuit
211.426	of interconnected activities
215.118	where people would meet in a process
215.118	of exchange and collaboration.
219.959	I still very much like this image.
221.801	It reminds one of biology classes,
221.801	if you remember the human body
224.948	with all its organs
224.948	and circulatory systems, like at school.
227.876	And suddenly you think of architecture
227.876	no longer as built substance,
231.897	but as an organism, as a life form.
234.436	And as you start to dissect this organism,
236.807	you can identify a series
236.807	of primary technical clusters --
241.56	program production,
241.56	broadcasting center and news.
244.857	Those are tightly intertwined
244.857	with social clusters:
248.361	meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --
251.449	informal spaces for people
251.449	to meet and exchange.
255.26	So the organizational structure
255.26	of this building was a hybrid
259.522	between the technical and the social,
261.992	the human and the performative.
264.333	And of course, we used the loop
264.333	of the building as a circulatory system,
267.997	to thread everything together
267.997	and to allow both visitors and staff
271.93	to experience all these different
271.93	functions in a great unity.
277.118	With 473,000 square meters,
280.202	it is one of the largest buildings
280.202	ever built in the world.
283.237	It has a population of over 10,000 people,
285.929	and of course, this is a scale
285.929	that exceeds the comprehension
289.539	of many things and the scale
289.539	of typical architecture.
292.323	So we stopped work for a while
293.975	and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks
293.975	and glued them onto a model,
298.304	just simply to confront ourselves
298.304	with what that quantity actually meant.
303.261	But of course, it's not a number,
304.895	it is the people, it is a community
304.895	that inhabits the building,
309.528	and in order to both comprehend
309.528	this, but also script this architecture,
314.005	we identified five characters,
314.005	hypothetical characters,
317.275	and we followed them throughout their day
317.275	in a life in this building,
321.868	thought of where they would meet,
321.868	what they would experience.
324.775	So it was a way to script and design
324.775	the building, but of course,
327.938	also to communicate its experiences.
329.999	This was part of an exhibition
329.999	with the Museum of Modern Art
333.311	in both New York and Beijing.
336.865	This is the main broadcast control room,
339.088	a technical installation so large,
340.93	it can broadcast over 200
340.93	channels simultaneously.
345.643	And this is how the building
345.643	stands in Beijing today.
349.801	Its first broadcast live
349.801	was the London Olympics 2012,
353.119	after it had been completed
353.119	from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.
357.998	And you can see at the very tip
357.998	of this 75-meter cantilever,
362.085	those three little circles.
363.663	And they're indeed part of a public loop
363.663	that goes through the building.
367.188	They're a piece of glass
367.188	that you can stand on
369.764	and watch the city pass by
369.764	below you in slow motion.
375.524	The building has become
375.524	part of everyday life in Beijing.
378.798	It is there.
380.313	It has also become a very popular backdrop
383.425	for wedding photography.
384.934	(Laughter)
390.621	But its most important moment
390.621	is maybe sill this one.
393.619	"""That's Beijing"" is similar to ""Time Out,"""
395.697	a magazine that broadcasts what
395.697	is happening in town during the week,
400.571	and suddenly you see the building
400.571	portrayed no longer as physical matter,
405.558	but actually as an urban actor,
407.097	as part of a series of personas
407.097	that define the life of the city.
412.987	So architecture suddenly
412.987	assumes the quality of a player,
417.921	of something that writes stories
417.921	and performs stories.
422.619	And I think that could be one
422.619	of its primary meanings
426.955	that we believe in.
428.226	But of course, there's another
428.226	story to this building.
430.861	It is the story of the people
430.861	that made it --
	that I was guiding
436.656	over almost a decade of collaborative work
439.271	that we spent together
439.271	in scripting this building,
442.262	in imagining its reality
444.192	and ultimately getting it built in China.
449.737	This is a residential development
449.737	in Singapore, large scale.
454.541	If we look at Singapore like most of Asia
454.541	and more and more of the world,
458.795	of course, it is dominated by the tower,
462.366	a typology that indeed creates
462.366	more isolation than connectedness,
466.911	and I wanted to ask, how
466.911	could we think about living,
470.146	not only in terms of the privacy
470.146	and individuality of ourselves
473.995	and our apartment,
475.455	but in an idea of a collective?
478.115	How could we think about creating
478.115	a communal environment
481.538	in which sharing things was as great
481.538	as having your own?
486.664	The typical answer to the question --
486.664	we had to design 1,040 apartments --
491.384	would have looked like this:
	by the planning authorities,
	but residual in between --
499.533	a very tight system that,
499.533	although the tower isolates you,
502.47	it doesn't even give you privacy,
502.47	because you're so close to the next one,
506.001	that it is very questionable
506.001	what the qualities of this would be.
510.488	So I proposed to topple the towers,
510.488	throw the vertical into the horizontal
514.806	and stack them up,
516.62	and what looks a bit random from the side,
519.191	if you look from the viewpoint
519.191	of the helicopter,
522.009	you can see its organizational structure
522.009	is actually a hexagonal grid,
526.762	in which these horizontal
526.762	building blocks are stacked up
530.523	to create huge outdoor courtyards --
530.523	central spaces for the community,
535.616	programmed with a variety
535.616	of amenities and functions.
539.8	And you see that these courtyards
539.8	are not hermetically sealed spaces.
543.111	They're open, permeable;
543.111	they're interconnected.
545.627	"We called the project ""The Interlace,"""
547.875	thinking that we interlace
547.875	and interconnect
550.873	the human beings and the spaces alike.
554.502	And the detailed quality
554.502	of everything we designed
557.417	was about animating the space
557.417	and giving the space to the inhabitants.
561.273	And, in fact, it was a system
562.694	where we would layer
562.694	primarily communal spaces,
566.186	stacked to more and more
566.186	individual and private spaces.
570.662	So we would open up a spectrum
572.529	between the collective and the individual.
576.203	A little piece of math:
577.378	if we count all the green
577.378	that we left on the ground,
579.953	minus the footprint of the buildings,
582.062	and we would add back
582.062	the green of all the terraces,
585.513	we have 112 percent green space,
587.591	so more nature than not
587.591	having built a building.
590.463	And of course this little piece of math
590.463	shows you that we are multiplying
594.489	the space available
594.489	to those who live there.
597.83	This is, in fact, the 13th floor
597.83	of one of these terraces.
601.038	So you see new datum planes,
601.038	new grounds planes for social activity.
606.792	We paid a lot of attention
606.792	to sustainability.
610.212	In the tropics, the sun is the most
610.212	important thing to pay attention to,
613.815	and, in fact, it is seeking
613.815	protection from the sun.
616.901	We first proved that all apartments
616.901	would have sufficient daylight
620.062	through the year.
621.648	We then went on to optimize
621.648	the glazing of the facades
624.333	to minimize the energy
624.333	consumption of the building.
627.981	But most importantly, we could prove
627.981	that through the geometry
631.42	of the building design,
633.02	the building itself would provide
633.02	sufficient shading to the courtyards
636.406	so that those would be usable
636.406	throughout the entire year.
639.432	We further placed water bodies
639.432	along the prevailing wind corridors,
642.934	so that evaporative cooling
642.934	would create microclimates
646.678	that, again, would enhance
646.678	the quality of those spaces
650.187	available for the inhabitants.
653.773	And it was the idea of creating
653.773	this variety of choices,
657.543	of freedom to think
657.543	where you would want to be,
661.64	where you would want to escape, maybe,
663.568	within the own complexity
663.568	of the complex in which you live.
669.036	But coming from Asia to Europe:
671.1	a building for a German
671.1	media company based in Berlin,
674.98	transitioning from the traditional
674.98	print media to the digital media.
679.83	And its CEO asked a few
679.83	very pertinent questions:
683.146	Why would anyone today
683.146	still want to go to the office,
685.775	because you can actually work anywhere?
687.988	And how could a digital identity
687.988	of a company be embodied
691.885	in a building?
694.147	We created not only an object,
694.147	but at the center of this object
697.994	we created a giant space,
699.613	and this space was about
699.613	the experience of a collective,
703.311	the experience of collaboration
703.311	and of togetherness.
707.011	Communication, interaction
707.011	as the center of a space
710.65	that in itself would float,
713.213	like what we call the collaborative cloud,
715.349	in the middle of the building,
716.881	surrounded by an envelope
716.881	of standard modular offices.
720.944	So with only a few steps
720.944	from your quiet work desk,
724.118	you could participate
724.118	in the giant collective experience
727.869	of the central space.
732.159	Finally, we come to London,
732.159	a project commissioned
735.762	by the London Legacy
735.762	Development Corporation
738.364	of the Mayor of London.
740.309	We were asked to undertake a study
742.521	and investigate the potential of a site
745.337	out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.
748.229	In the 19th century, Prince Albert
748.229	had created Albertopolis.
752.513	And Boris Johnson thought
752.513	of creating Olympicopolis.
757.211	The idea was to bring together
757.211	some of Britain's greatest institutions,
761.507	some international ones,
761.507	and to create a new system of synergies.
765.803	Prince Albert, as yet, created
765.803	Albertopolis in the 19th century,
770.351	thought of showcasing
770.351	all achievements of mankind,
772.838	bringing arts and science closer together.
776.082	And he built Exhibition Road,
776.082	a linear sequence of those institutions.
781.836	But of course, today's society
781.836	has moved on from there.
785.551	We no longer live in a world
787.531	in which everything
787.531	is as clearly delineated
790.235	or separated from each other.
791.761	We live in a world in which
791.761	boundaries start to blur
795.174	between the different domains,
796.666	and in which collaboration and interaction
796.666	becomes far more important
800.68	than keeping separations.
803.408	So we wanted to think
803.408	of a giant culture machine,
806.451	a building that would orchestrate
806.451	and animate the various domains,
811.252	but allow them to interact
811.252	and collaborate.
815.211	At the base of it is a very simple module,
817.34	a ring module.
818.515	It can function as a double-loaded
818.515	corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.
822.182	It can be glazed over
823.357	and turned into a giant
823.357	exhibitional performance space.
826.254	These modules were stacked together
828.403	with the idea that almost any
828.403	function could, over time,
832.189	occupy any of these modules.
833.95	So institutions could shrink or contract,
837.09	as, of course, the future of culture
837.09	is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.
842.733	This is how the building sits,
842.733	adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,
845.712	opposite the Olympic Stadium.
848.608	And you can see how
848.608	its cantilevering volumes
850.965	project out and engage the public space
853.779	and how its courtyards
853.779	animate the public inside.
859.313	The idea was to create a complex system
862.565	in which institutional entities
862.565	could maintain their own identity,
867.477	in which they would not
867.477	be subsumed in a singular volume.
870.434	Here's a scale comparison
870.434	to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.
873.624	It both shows the enormous scale
873.624	and potential of the project,
877.013	but also the difference:
878.324	here, it is a multiplicity
878.324	of a heterogeneous structure,
882.523	in which different entities can interact
885.058	without losing their own identity.
888.395	And it was this thought: to create
888.395	an organizational structure
892.369	that would allow for multiple
892.369	narratives to be scripted --
895.226	for those in the educational parts
895.226	that create and think culture;
900.704	for those that present
900.704	the visual arts, the dance;
904.234	and for the public to be
904.234	admitted into all of this
907.067	with a series of possible trajectories,
909.737	to script their own reading
909.737	of these narratives
912.493	and their own experience.
916.475	And I want to end on a project
916.475	that is very small,
919.905	in a way, very different:
921.896	a floating cinema
921.896	in the ocean of Thailand.
923.968	Friends of mine had founded
923.968	a film festival,
927.528	and I thought,
929.226	if we think of the stories
929.226	and narratives of movies,
932.529	we should also think of the narratives
932.529	of the people that watch them.
936.096	So I designed a small
936.096	modular floating platform,
939.405	based on the techniques
939.405	of local fishermen,
941.703	how they built their lobster
941.703	and fish farms.
943.814	We collaborated with the local community
946.217	and built, out of recycled
946.217	materials of their own,
949.973	this fantastical floating platform
952.119	that gently moved in the ocean
954.064	as we watched films
954.064	from the British film archive,
956.972	"[1903] ""Alice in Wonderland,"" for example."
959.987	The most primordial
959.987	experiences of the audience
963.068	merged with the stories of the movies.
967.84	So I believe that architecture exceeds
967.84	the domain of physical matter,
972.674	of the built environment,
974.158	but is really about how
