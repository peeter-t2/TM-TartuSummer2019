12.991	Imagine that you are a product designer.
16.686	And you've designed a product,
18.156	a new type of product,
18.156	called the human immune system.
23.161	You're pitching this product
24.65	to a skeptical, strictly
24.65	no-nonsense manager.
28.378	Let's call him Bob.
29.848	I think we all know
29.848	at least one Bob, right?
33.542	How would that go?
35.925	Bob, I've got this incredible idea
37.981	for a completely new type
37.981	of personal health product.
40.637	It's called the human immune system.
43.447	I can see from your face that
43.447	you're having some problems with this.
46.7	Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.
48.8	I don't want to take you
48.8	through the gory details,
51.481	I just want to tell you about some
51.481	of the amazing features of this product.
55.733	First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy
58.686	by having millions of copies
58.686	of each component --
61.842	leukocytes, white blood cells --
64.051	before they're actually needed,
65.825	to create a massive buffer
65.825	against the unexpected.
70.276	And it cleverly leverages diversity
73.66	by having not just leukocytes
73.66	but B cells, T cells,
77.405	natural killer cells, antibodies.
79.943	The components don't really matter.
81.669	The point is that together,
83.263	this diversity of different approaches
83.263	can cope with more or less anything
87.903	that evolution has been able to throw up.
91.933	And the design is completely modular.
95.86	You have the surface barrier
95.86	of the human skin,
99.173	you have the very rapidly reacting
99.173	innate immune system
102.418	and then you have the highly targeted
102.418	adaptive immune system.
107.017	The point is, that if one system fails,
107.017	another can take over,
110.886	creating a virtually foolproof system.
115.17	I can see I'm losing you, Bob,
115.17	but stay with me,
117.485	because here is the really killer feature.
121.773	The product is completely adaptive.
124.789	It's able to actually develop
124.789	targeted antibodies
129.355	to threats that it's never
129.355	even met before.
132.68	It actually also does this
132.68	with incredible prudence,
137.081	detecting and reacting
137.081	to every tiny threat,
141.203	and furthermore, remembering
141.203	every previous threat,
145.562	in case they are ever encountered again.
148.624	What I'm pitching you today
148.624	is actually not a stand-alone product.
153.569	The product is embedded
153.569	in the larger system of the human body,
158.008	and it works in complete harmony
158.008	with that system,
160.945	to create this unprecedented level
160.945	of biological protection.
164.023	So Bob, just tell me honestly,
164.023	what do you think of my product?
168.342	And Bob may say something like,
170.89	I sincerely appreciate
170.89	the effort and passion
173.829	that have gone into your presentation,
176.696	blah blah blah --
177.874	(Laughter)
179.078	But honestly, it's total nonsense.
184.081	You seem to be saying that the key
184.081	selling points of your product
187.474	are that it is inefficient and complex.
190.76	Didn't they teach you 80-20?
193.693	And furthermore, you're saying
193.693	that this product is siloed.
197.676	It overreacts,
199.105	makes things up as it goes along
200.668	and is actually designed
200.668	for somebody else's benefit.
203.183	I'm sorry to break it to you,
203.183	but I don't think this one is a winner.
207.267	If we went with Bob's philosophy,
209.237	I think we'd actually end up
209.237	with a more efficient immune system.
212.729	And efficiency is always important
212.729	in the short term.
216.875	Less complex, more efficient,
216.875	more bang for the buck.
220.322	Who could say no to that?
222.151	Unfortunately, there's one
222.151	very tiny problem,
224.562	and that is that the user
224.562	of this product, you or I,
227.851	would probably die
227.851	within one week of the next winter,
231.548	when we encountered a new strain
231.548	of the influenza virus.
237.191	I first became interested
237.191	in biology and business,
241.385	and longevity and resilience,
243.788	when I was asked a very unusual question
246.063	by the CEO of a global tech company.
249.257	And the question was:
250.731	What do we have to do to make sure
250.731	that our company lasts 100 years?
258.811	A seemingly innocent question,
260.405	but actually, it's a little trickier
260.405	than you might think,
264.341	considering that the average
264.341	US public company now
268.591	can expect a life span of only 30 years.
273.033	That is less than half of the life span
275.778	that its employees can expect to enjoy.
279.743	Now, if you were the CEO
279.743	of such a company,
282.961	badgered by investors
282.961	and buffeted by change,
286.379	we might forgive you
286.379	for not even worrying too much
288.918	about what happens 30 years out.
291.09	But here's something that should
291.09	keep you awake at night:
295.84	the probability that your company
295.84	will not be around in five year's time,
299.449	on average, is now
299.449	a staggering 32 percent.
304.164	That's a one in three chance
304.164	that your company will be taken over
308.232	or will fail within just five years.
313.696	Let's come back
313.696	to our tech CEO's question.
316.034	Where better to turn
316.034	for advice than nature,
319.837	that's been in the business
319.837	of life and death
322.455	for longer than any company?
327.147	As a lapsed biologist,
328.954	I decided to immediately call
328.954	a real biologist,
332.339	my friend Simon Levin,
334.377	Professor of Biology and Mathematics
334.377	at Princeton University.
338.461	Together, we looked at a variety
338.461	of biological systems,
342.115	ranging from natural tropical rainforests
345.405	through to managed forests and fisheries.
348.351	And we asked ourselves the question:
350.099	What makes these systems
350.099	resilient and enduring?
356.176	And what we found
356.176	was that the same six principles
360.345	that we saw underpinning
360.345	the miracle of the human immune system
363.394	actually cropped up again and again,
367.157	from redundancy through to embeddedness.
371.129	In fact, we saw these principles
371.129	not only in biologically enduring systems,
375.299	we also found them
375.299	being very characteristic
378.194	of long-lived social systems,
380.605	like the Roman Empire
380.605	and the Catholic Church,
382.847	believe it or not.
384.169	We also went on to look at business,
386.031	and found that these very same properties
386.031	also characterized businesses
390.911	that were resilient and long-lived,
392.895	and we noted their absence
392.895	from ones which were short-lived.
399.162	Let's first take a look at what happens
399.162	when the corporate immune system
403.208	collapses.
405.202	This beautiful building is part
405.202	of the Shitennoji Temple Complex
409.768	in Osaka, Japan.
411.672	In fact, it's one of the oldest
411.672	temples in Japan.
415.165	It was built by a Korean artisan,
417.417	because at the time,
417.417	Japan was not yet building temples.
420.933	And this Korean artisan went on
420.933	to found a temple-building company.
427.017	Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,
430.446	was still around 1,428 years later.
435.694	In fact, it became the oldest
435.694	continuously operating company
439.318	in the world.
441.986	So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?
446.28	Not too well, I'm afraid.
448.559	It borrowed very heavily
449.936	during the bubble period
449.936	of the Japanese economy,
452.738	to invest in real estate.
454.225	And when the bubble burst,
454.225	it couldn't refinance its loans.
458.463	The company failed,
459.775	and it was taken over
459.775	by a major construction company.
464.735	Tragically, after 40 generations
464.735	of very careful stewardship
469.466	by the Kongō family,
471.834	Kongō Gumi succumbed
471.834	to a spectacular lapse
475.538	in the ability to apply
475.538	a principle of prudence.
480.439	Speaking of company failures:
483.552	we're all familiar
483.552	with the failure of Kodak,
486.908	the company that declared bankruptcy
489.494	in January 2012.
493.322	Much more interesting,
493.322	however, is the question:
497.285	Why did Fujifilm --
499.662	same product, same pressures
499.662	from digital technology, same time --
504.929	why was Fujifilm
504.929	able to survive and flourish?
510.846	Fujifilm used its capabilities
510.846	in chemistry, material science and optics
517.558	to diversify into a number of areas,
520.953	ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals,
524.025	to medical systems to biomaterials.
526.035	Some of these diversification
526.035	attempts failed.
529.9	But in aggregate,
531.088	it was able to adapt
531.088	its portfolio sufficiently
535.452	to survive and flourish.
538.633	As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,
541.5	the strategy succeeded
541.5	"because it had ""more pockets and drawers"""
545.76	than the rivals.
547.175	He meant, of course,
548.35	that they were able to create
548.35	more options than the rivals.
553.137	Fujifilm survived because it applied
553.137	the principles of prudence,
557.574	diversity
558.989	and adaptation.
561.615	A catastrophic factory fire,
561.615	like the one we see here,
565.308	completely wiped out, in one evening,
568.88	the only plant which supplied Toyota
568.88	with valves for car-braking systems.
576.313	The ultimate test of resilience.
580.193	Car production ground
580.193	to a screeching halt.
584.629	How was it, then, that Toyota
584.629	was able to recover car production?
590.261	Can you imagine how long it took?
592.208	Just five days.
594.005	From having no braking valves
594.005	to complete recovery in five days.
598.966	How was this possible?
600.747	Toyota managed its network of suppliers
600.747	in such a collaborative manner
606.057	that it could work very quickly
606.057	and smoothly with suppliers
610.317	to repurpose production,
613.099	fill the missing braking valve capacity
615.653	and have car production come online again.
620.093	Toyota applied the principles
620.093	of modularity of its supply network,
624.419	embeddedness in an integrated system
627.154	and the functional redundancy
627.154	to be able to repurpose, smoothly,
631.214	existing capacity.
634.15	Now fortunately, few companies
634.15	succumb to catastrophic fires.
639.189	But we do read in the newspaper
639.189	every day about companies
642.306	succumbing to the disruption
642.306	of technology.
646.612	How is it, then, that the consumer
646.612	optics giant Essilor
650.558	is able to avoid technology disruption,
650.558	and even profit from it?
655.095	And yes, technology disruption
655.095	is not only a big deal
658.563	in software and electronics.
661.917	Essilor carefully scans
661.917	the competitive environment
666.262	for potentially disruptive technologies.
669.483	It acquires those technologies very early,
672.317	before they've become expensive
672.317	or competitors have mobilized around them,
676.117	and it then develops
676.117	those technologies itself,
679.297	even at the risk of failure
681.263	or the risk of self-disruption.
684.409	Essilor stays ahead of its game,
687.051	and has delivered spectacular performance
689.081	for over 40 years,
690.548	by using the principles
690.548	of prudence and adaptation.
695.901	OK, if these principles are so powerful,
695.901	you might be thinking,
699.986	why are they not commonplace in business?
702.917	Why do we not use these words every day?
705.625	Well, change has to first
705.625	start in the mind.
707.976	If we think back to our pitch to Bob,
710.045	in order to apply the principles
712.457	that underpin the miracle
712.457	of the human immune system,
715.827	we first need to think differently
718.255	about business.
719.838	Now typically, when we think
719.838	about business,
722.569	"we use what I call ""mechanical thinking."""
725.962	We set goals,
727.623	we analyze problems,
729.186	we construct and we adhere to plans,
731.537	and more than anything else,
732.904	we stress efficiency
732.904	and short-term performance.
736.333	Now, don't get me wrong --
737.618	this is a splendidly practical
737.618	and effective way
740.756	of addressing relatively simple challenges
743.22	in relatively stable environments.
746.005	It's the way that Bob -- and probably
746.005	many of us, myself included --
749.491	process most business problems
749.491	we're faced with every day.
753.374	In fact, it was a pretty good
753.374	mental model for business --
757.036	overall --
758.581	until about the mid-1980s,
760.633	when the conjunction of globalization
764.021	and a revolution in technology
764.021	and telecommunications
766.568	made business far more
766.568	dynamic and unpredictable.
769.497	But what about those more dynamic
769.497	and unpredictable situations
772.599	that we now increasingly face?
775.597	I think in addition
775.597	to the mechanical thinking,
778.036	we now need to master the art
778.036	of biological thinking,
782.417	as embodied by our six principles.
785.245	In other words, we need to think
785.245	more modestly and subtly
788.922	about when and how
791.242	we can shape, rather than control,
794.928	unpredictable and complex situations.
799.551	It's a little like the difference
799.551	between throwing a ball
803.403	and releasing a bird.
805.685	The ball would head in a straight line,
807.652	probably towards the intended target,
809.894	and the bird certainly would not.
815.455	So what do you think?
817.073	Sounds a little impractical,
817.073	a little theoretical, perhaps?
821.821	Not at all.
823.657	Every small entrepreneurial company
827.038	naturally thinks and acts biologically.
830.404	Why?
831.579	Because it lacks the resources
831.579	to shape its environment
834.233	through brute force.
835.551	It lacks the scale to buffer change,
839.254	and it's constantly thinking
839.254	about the tough odds
842.451	for a start-up to survive.
846.637	Now, the irony is, of course,
848.059	that every large company started off
848.059	as a small, entrepreneurial company.
851.66	But along the way somewhere,
853.255	many have lost this ability
853.255	to think and act biologically.
858.604	They need to rejuvenate
858.604	their ability to think biologically
863.603	in order to survive and thrive
863.603	in today's environment.
868.704	So let's not just think
868.704	about short-term performance.
872.079	Every company I know spends plenty of time
874.979	thinking about the central
874.979	question of strategy:
877.4	How good is our competitive game?
879.802	In addition, let's also consider
882.168	the second, more biological
882.168	and equally important question:
886.253	How long will that game last?
889.081	Thank you very much.
890.286	(Applause)
