15.888	Salaam alaikum.
18.804	Welcome to Doha.
20.49	I am in charge of making this country's food secure.
23.892	That is my job for the next two years,
25.943	to design an entire master plan,
28.359	and then for the next 10 years to implement it --
31.892	of course, with so many other people.
33.912	But first, I need to talk to you about a story, which is my story,
38.559	about the story of this country that you're all here in today.
42.427	And of course, most of you have had three meals today,
45.977	and probably will continue to have after this event.
50.51	So going in, what was Qatar in the 1940s?
54.943	We were about 11,000 people living here.
59.143	There was no water. There was no energy, no oil, no cars, none of that.
66.159	Most of the people who lived here
67.554	either lived in coastal villages, fishing,
70.026	or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water.
75.976	None of the glamour that you see today existed.
79.378	No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh.
84.526	It wasn't that they couldn't develop cities.
87.143	Resources weren't there to develop them.
89.242	And you can see that life expectancy was also short.
92.075	Most people died around the age of 50.
93.977	So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
100.993	But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially
105.793	until after the Second World War.
108.243	What did it do?
110.377	It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
113.677	It also made all those people who roamed around the desert --
117.409	looking for water, looking for food,
120.693	trying to take care of their livestock -- urbanize.
124.796	You might find this strange,
126.76	but in my family we have different accents.
130.609	My mother has an accent that is so different to my father,
134.609	and we're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country.
139.643	There are about five or six accents in this country as I speak.
143.177	"Someone says, ""How so? How could this happen?"""
146.993	Because we lived scattered.
148.776	We couldn't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources.
153.928	And when the resources came, be it oil,
157.739	we started building these fancy technologies
160.793	and bringing people together because we needed the concentration.
164.443	People started to get to know each other.
166.827	And we realized that there are some differences in accents.
170.776	So that is the chapter two: the oil era.
173.711	Let's look at today.
175.826	This is probably the skyline that most of you know about Doha.
180.552	So what's the population today?
181.943	It's 1.7 million people.
184.193	That is in less than 60 years.
186.892	The average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years.
192.794	Lifespan has increased to 78.
195.627	Water consumption has increased to 430 liters.
200.436	And this is amongst the highest worldwide.
203.843	From having no water whatsoever
206.01	to consuming water to the highest degree, higher than any other nation.
211.494	I don't know if this was a reaction to lack of water.
215.26	But what is interesting about the story that I've just said?
221.46	The interesting part is that we continue to grow
231.243	Now that is historic. It's never happened before in history.
236.193	Cities were totally wiped out because of the lack of water.
240.126	This is history being made in this region.
242.642	Not only cities that we're building,
244.559	but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists, doctors.
249.712	Build a nice home, bring the architect, design my house.
252.861	These people are adamant that this is a livable space when it wasn't.
259.06	But of course, with the use of technology.
261.029	So Brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain.
267.543	Qatar has 74, and we have that growth rate.
270.394	The question is how.
272.41	How could we survive that?
275.676	We have no water whatsoever.
277.76	Simply because of this gigantic, mammoth machine called desalination.
284.059	Energy is the key factor here. It changed everything.
288.227	It is that thing that we pump out of the ground, we burn tons of,
292.726	probably most of you used it coming to Doha.
295.726	So that is our lake, if you can see it.
298.627	That is our river.
300.476	That is how you all happen to use and enjoy water.
305.818	This is the best technology that this region could ever have: desalination.
312.444	So what are the risks?
314.712	Do you worry much?
316.262	I would say, perhaps if you look at the global facts,
320.178	you will realize, of course I have to worry.
322.769	There is growing demand, growing population.
325.278	We've turned seven billion only a few months ago.
328.527	And so that number also demands food.
332.019	And there's predictions that we'll be nine billion by 2050.
335.227	So a country that has no water
338.083	has to worry about what happens beyond its borders.
341.734	There's also changing diets.
344.066	By elevating to a higher socio-economic level,
348.132	they also change their diet.
350.315	They start eating more meat and so on and so forth.
353.315	On the other hand, there is declining yields
355.668	because of climate change and because of other factors.
358.366	And so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen.
363.534	This is the situation in Qatar, for those who don't know.
367.349	We only have two days of water reserve.
370.699	We import 90 percent of our food,
372.983	and we only cultivate less than one percent of our land.
376.683	The limited number of farmers that we have
379.132	have been pushed out of their farming practices
382.666	as a result of open market policy and bringing the big competitions, etc., etc.
388.215	So we also face risks.
391.466	These risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity.
398.649	The question is, is there a solution?
401.167	Is there a sustainable solution?
403.349	Indeed there is.
405.333	This slide sums up thousands of pages of technical documents
409.366	that we've been working on over the past two years.
412.05	Let's start with the water.
413.482	So we know very well -- I showed you earlier -- that we need this energy.
417.251	So if we're going to need energy, what sort of energy?
420.349	A depletable energy? Fossil fuel?
422.648	Or should we use something else?
425.043	Do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy?
428.382	I guess most of you by now realize that we do: 300 days of sun.
432.516	And so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need.
437.848	And we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems
443.249	to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water.
445.858	And that is a lot of water.
447.882	That water will go then to the farmers,
450.15	and the farmers will be able to water their plants,
452.387	and they will be able then to supply society with food.
456.517	But in order to sustain the horizontal line --
458.634	because these are the projects, these are the systems that we will deliver --
461.965	we need to also develop the vertical line:
464.599	system sustenance, high-level education, research and development,
469.917	industries, technologies, to produce these technologies for application, and finally markets.
474.979	But what gels all of it, what enables it, is legislation, policies, regulations.
481.112	Without it we can't do anything.
483.345	So that's what we are planning to do.
484.897	Within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan
488.428	and taking it to implementation.
490.395	Our objective is to be a millennium city, just like many millennium cities around:
497.095	Istanbul, Rome, London, Paris, Damascus, Cairo.
504.23	We are only 60 years old, but we want to live forever
508.325	as a city, to live in peace.
512.886	Thank you very much.
514.831	(Applause)
