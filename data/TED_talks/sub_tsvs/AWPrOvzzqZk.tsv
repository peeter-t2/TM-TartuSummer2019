13.354	Technology has brought us so much:
16.489	the moon landing, the Internet,
18.508	the ability to sequence the human genome.
21.133	But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears,
24.857	and about 30 years ago,
26.713	the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book
29.266	"called ""Amusing Ourselves to Death,"""
31.381	which lays this out really brilliantly.
34.14	And here's what he said,
35.79	comparing the dystopian visions
38.053	of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley.
41.626	He said, Orwell feared we would become
44.752	a captive culture.
47	Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture.
50.752	Orwell feared the truth would be
52.897	concealed from us,
54.82	and Huxley feared we would be drowned
57.01	in a sea of irrelevance.
59.703	In a nutshell, it's a choice between
61.873	Big Brother watching you
64.473	and you watching Big Brother.
66.969	(Laughter)
68.9	But it doesn't have to be this way.
70.634	We are not passive consumers
70.634	of data and technology.
73.97	We shape the role it plays in our lives
76.373	and the way we make meaning from it,
78.503	but to do that,
80.106	we have to pay as much attention to how we think
83.619	as how we code.
85.649	We have to ask questions, and hard questions,
88.747	to move past counting things
90.616	to understanding them.
93.218	We're constantly bombarded with stories
95.664	about how much data there is in the world,
98.14	but when it comes to big data
99.72	and the challenges of interpreting it,
102.316	size isn't everything.
104.404	There's also the speed at which it moves,
107.307	and the many varieties of data types,
109.003	and here are just a few examples:
111.501	images,
113.699	text,
117.706	video,
119.801	audio.
121.631	And what unites this disparate types of data
124.673	is that they're created by people
126.894	and they require context.
129.669	Now, there's a group of data scientists
132.114	out of the University of Illinois-Chicago,
134.419	and they're called the Health Media Collaboratory,
136.973	and they've been working with
136.973	the Centers for Disease Control
139.56	to better understand
141.065	how people talk about quitting smoking,
143.913	how they talk about electronic cigarettes,
146.593	and what they can do collectively
148.578	to help them quit.
150.562	The interesting thing is, if you want to understand
152.575	how people talk about smoking,
154.791	first you have to understand
156.692	"what they mean when they say ""smoking."""
159.257	And on Twitter, there are four main categories:
163.183	number one, smoking cigarettes;
166.18	number two, smoking marijuana;
168.987	number three, smoking ribs;
171.63	and number four, smoking hot women.
175.183	(Laughter)
178.176	So then you have to think about, well,
180.602	how do people talk about electronic cigarettes?
182.742	And there are so many different ways
184.767	that people do this, and you can see from the slide
187.366	it's a complex kind of a query.
189.976	And what it reminds us is that
193.2	language is created by people,
195.611	and people are messy and we're complex
197.951	and we use metaphors and slang and jargon
200.718	and we do this 24/7 in many, many languages,
203.997	and then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up.
207.221	So did these ads that the CDC put on,
212.339	these television ads that featured a woman
214.769	with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic
216.79	and very disturbing,
218.694	did they actually have an impact
220.579	on whether people quit?
223.25	And the Health Media Collaboratory
223.25	respected the limits of their data,
226.557	but they were able to conclude
228.562	that those advertisements —
228.562	and you may have seen them —
231.874	that they had the effect of jolting people
234.465	into a thought process
236.287	that may have an impact on future behavior.
239.954	And what I admire and 
239.954	appreciate about this project,
243.845	aside from the fact, including the fact
245.334	that it's based on real human need,
249.391	is that it's a fantastic example of courage
252.237	in the face of a sea of irrelevance.
256.68	And so it's not just big data that causes
259.985	challenges of interpretation, because let's face it,
262.586	we human beings have a very rich history
265.18	of taking any amount of data, no matter how small,
267.873	and screwing it up.
269.49	So many years ago, you may remember
273.227	that former President Ronald Reagan
275.5	was very criticized for making a statement
277.491	that facts are stupid things.
280.501	And it was a slip of the tongue, let's be fair.
283.295	He actually meant to quote John Adams' defense
285.725	of British soldiers in the Boston Massacre trials
288.476	that facts are stubborn things.
291.626	But I actually think there's
294.25	a bit of accidental wisdom in what he said,
297.668	because facts are stubborn things,
300.444	but sometimes they're stupid, too.
303.367	I want to tell you a personal story
305.255	about why this matters a lot to me.
308.803	I need to take a breath.
311.24	My son Isaac, when he was two,
313.994	was diagnosed with autism,
316.411	and he was this happy, hilarious,
318.572	loving, affectionate little guy,
320.607	but the metrics on his developmental evaluations,
323.509	which looked at things like 
323.509	the number of words —
325.579	at that point, none —
329.236	communicative gestures and minimal eye contact,
333.176	put his developmental level
335.179	at that of a nine-month-old baby.
339.14	And the diagnosis was factually correct,
342.1	but it didn't tell the whole story.
345.309	And about a year and a half later,
346.71	when he was almost four,
348.812	I found him in front of the computer one day
351.175	running a Google image search on women,
356.628	"spelled ""w-i-m-e-n."""
360.244	And I did what any obsessed parent would do,
362.984	which is immediately started 
362.984	"hitting the ""back"" button"
364.885	to see what else he'd been searching for.
368.248	And they were, in order: men,
370.419	school, bus and computer.
377.686	And I was stunned,
379.756	because we didn't know that he could spell,
381.758	much less read, and so I asked him,
383.524	"""Isaac, how did you do this?"""
385.717	And he looked at me very seriously and said,
388.395	"""Typed in the box."""
391.747	He was teaching himself to communicate,
395.481	but we were looking in the wrong place,
398.485	and this is what happens when assessments
400.78	and analytics overvalue one metric —
403.176	in this case, verbal communication —
405.785	and undervalue others, such
405.785	as creative problem-solving.
411.488	Communication was hard for Isaac,
413.795	and so he found a workaround
415.707	to find out what he needed to know.
418.564	And when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense,
420.454	because forming a question
422.535	is a really complex process,
425.1	but he could get himself a lot of the way there
427.622	by putting a word in a search box.
431.714	And so this little moment
434.65	had a really profound impact on me
437.486	and our family
438.795	because it helped us change our frame of reference
441.936	for what was going on with him,
444.144	and worry a little bit less and appreciate
447.12	his resourcefulness more.
449.302	Facts are stupid things.
452.163	And they're vulnerable to misuse,
454.56	willful or otherwise.
456.213	I have a friend, Emily Willingham, who's a scientist,
459.239	and she wrote a piece for Forbes not long ago
462.04	"entitled ""The 10 Weirdest Things"
464.02	"Ever Linked to Autism."""
465.83	It's quite a list.
468.835	The Internet, blamed for everything, right?
472.367	And of course mothers, because.
476.124	And actually, wait, there's more,
477.711	there's a whole bunch in 
477.711	"the ""mother"" category here."
481.141	And you can see it's a pretty 
481.141	rich and interesting list.
485.956	I'm a big fan of
488.149	being pregnant near freeways, personally.
491.853	The final one is interesting,
493.392	"because the term ""refrigerator mother"""
496.395	was actually the original hypothesis
499	for the cause of autism,
500.431	and that meant somebody 
500.431	who was cold and unloving.
503.166	And at this point, you might be thinking,
504.728	"""Okay, Susan, we get it,"
506.385	you can take data, you can 
506.385	"make it mean anything."""
508.167	And this is true, it's absolutely true,
512.87	but the challenge is that
518.48	we have this opportunity
520.928	to try to make meaning out of it ourselves,
523.212	because frankly, data doesn't 
523.212	create meaning. We do.
528.564	So as businesspeople, as consumers,
531.82	as patients, as citizens,
534.359	we have a responsibility, I think,
536.755	to spend more time
538.949	focusing on our critical thinking skills.
541.819	Why?
542.897	Because at this point in our history, as we've heard
546.075	many times over,
547.781	we can process exabytes of data
549.762	at lightning speed,
551.915	and we have the potential to make bad decisions
555.43	far more quickly, efficiently,
557.264	and with far greater impact than we did in the past.
562.292	Great, right?
563.68	And so what we need to do instead
566.71	is spend a little bit more time
569.04	on things like the humanities
571.786	and sociology, and the social sciences,
575.25	rhetoric, philosophy, ethics,
577.558	because they give us context that is so important
580.414	for big data, and because
582.99	they help us become better critical thinkers.
585.408	Because after all, if I can spot
589.615	a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter
592.101	whether it's expressed in words or in numbers.
594.86	And this means
597.579	teaching ourselves to find 
597.579	those confirmation biases
602	and false correlations
603.822	and being able to spot a naked emotional appeal
605.96	from 30 yards,
607.622	because something that happens after something
610.144	doesn't mean it happened 
610.144	because of it, necessarily,
613.226	and if you'll let me geek out on you for a second,
615.345	the Romans called this 
615.345	"""post hoc ergo propter hoc,"""
619.642	after which therefore because of which.
622.938	And it means questioning
622.938	disciplines like demographics.
626.695	Why? Because they're based on assumptions
629.215	about who we all are based on our gender
631.521	and our age and where we live
632.983	as opposed to data on what 
632.983	we actually think and do.
636.461	And since we have this data,
638.124	we need to treat it with appropriate privacy controls
641.263	and consumer opt-in,
644.839	and beyond that, we need to be clear
647.832	about our hypotheses,
649.935	the methodologies that we use,
652.531	and our confidence in the result.
655.335	As my high school algebra teacher used to say,
657.809	show your math,
659.34	because if I don't know what steps you took,
662.781	I don't know what steps you didn't take,
664.772	and if I don't know what questions you asked,
667.21	I don't know what questions you didn't ask.
670.407	And it means asking ourselves, really,
671.93	the hardest question of all:
673.409	Did the data really show us this,
676.909	or does the result make us feel
679.22	more successful and more comfortable?
683.098	So the Health Media Collaboratory,
685.682	at the end of their project, they were able
687.381	to find that 87 percent of tweets
690.789	about those very graphic and disturbing
692.933	anti-smoking ads expressed fear,
696.971	but did they conclude
698.827	that they actually made people stop smoking?
701.988	No. It's science, not magic.
704.53	So if we are to unlock
707.72	the power of data,
710.582	we don't have to go blindly into
714.03	Orwell's vision of a totalitarian future,
717.466	or Huxley's vision of a trivial one,
720.583	or some horrible cocktail of both.
723.603	What we have to do
725.982	is treat critical thinking with respect
728.7	and be inspired by examples
730.729	like the Health Media Collaboratory,
733.339	and as they say in the superhero movies,
735.667	let's use our powers for good.
737.489	Thank you.
739.84	(Applause)
