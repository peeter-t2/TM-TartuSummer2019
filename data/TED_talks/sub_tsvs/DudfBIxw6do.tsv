25	Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED.
26	Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great.
30	CA: Have you met anyone interesting?
32	RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
35	I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,
37	because I had an apology to make to her.
40	I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --
45	she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
50	And I went home to my wife that night
53	and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,
55	massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
58	And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler
60	and get it cut off.
62	So -- (Laughter) --
66	so apologies to Goldie.
67	CA: That's pretty good.
69	So, we're going to put up some slides
72	of some of your companies here.
74	You've started one or two in your time.
77	So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --
80	I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.
83	And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this?
89	RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:
92	you must not talk about your own business, and this,
94	and now you ask me.
95	So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,
97	since you asked the question.
99	(Laughter)
100	CA: It depends what the answer is though.
103	RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,
109	you can really run any companies.
110	I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,
114	inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.
120	And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive
125	and I love taking on, you know, the status quo
129	and trying to turn it upside down.
131	So I've seen life as one long learning process.
135	And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline
139	and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,
147	the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.
150	And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go.
156	CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,
157	because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.
162	And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.
167	I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,
170	at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records
174	and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,
176	and his view was that you were trading, you know,
179	the world's fourth biggest record company
181	for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.
185	Why did you do that?
187	RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.
193	And I think if you start a business without financial backing,
197	you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.
200	We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.
207	They were trying to put our airline out of business,
210	and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.
215	And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down
220	unless I chipped in a chip.
222	And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,
226	and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,
230	I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline.
236	CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,
239	for that as well.
240	RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.
246	But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on.
252	CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot
254	and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.
257	What does the brand stand for in your head?
260	RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,
262	that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they --
266	CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit?
268	RB: No, but I was going to move on this.
270	We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.
276	As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,
279	and I think, you know, we do it differently
283	and I think that industries are not quite the same
285	as a result of Virgin attacking the market.
287	CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done
290	where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
292	I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?
295	(Laughter)
297	RB: We couldn't find any customers.
299	(Laughter)
302	(Applause)
303	CA: I was actually also curious why --
305	I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
308	I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?
312	Ain't virgin no longer, or something.
315	RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.
317	I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,
323	you know, you can deal with them.
325	But about three months after the launch of the condom company,
327	I had a letter, a complaint,
330	and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.
334	But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.
337	And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,
343	I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby
346	asking if I'd be godfather, which I became.
351	So, it all worked out well.
353	CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful.
356	RB: I should have.
357	CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.
359	I mean, what are the numbers on this?
361	I mean, how big is the group overall?
363	How much -- what's the total revenue?
365	RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
368	CA: And how many employees?
369	RB: About 55,000.
372	CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times
376	and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.
384	What was that? Was that real?
388	RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.
391	No, I mean, I think --
392	CA: But is that your hair?
393	RB: No.
397	CA: What was that one?
399	RB: Dropping in for tea.
400	CA: OK.
401	(Laughter)
404	RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which --
407	CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --
409	it was a TEDster event there, I think.
412	Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?
414	(Laughter)
415	RB: It's a tough job, isn't it?
416	CA: I mean, it is a tough job.
418	(Laughter)
419	When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well
423	and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,
425	it's very strange.
426	RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but --
431	CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about --
432	"RB: ""Pammy"" we launched, you know --"
434	mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,
436	"and we launched a cola bottle called ""The Pammy"""
441	and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
444	But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --
447	(Laughter)
450	CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?
452	RB: Of course.
454	CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.
459	And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think?
466	RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols'
471	"""God Save The Queen,"" and I'd certainly never expected"
474	that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.
477	But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think.
481	CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.
484	Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how?
487	RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.
489	Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard
492	and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.
496	But nowhere else anyway.
500	CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ...
505	RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems
509	getting a booking in a restaurant or something,
511	that might be worth using it.
512	CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson.
517	RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
520	CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
523	I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,
527	and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video)
534	So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
537	RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months
542	and then we do 12 months extensive testing.
545	And then 24 months from now,
547	people will be able to take a ride into space.
554	CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed?
557	RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:
562	the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.
567	And basically, he's just taken an eye
570	and the space station will be one giant eye,
575	so when you're in space,
577	you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.
580	And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.
586	But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design.
590	CA: But you didn't have him design the engine?
593	RB: Philippe is quite erratic,
595	so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no.
599	CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago.
601	RB: Yeah? No, he is a --
602	CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,
604	some people found it completely bizarre.
606	But, I personally found it wonderful.
608	RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ...
614	CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.
620	Have you ever regretted that?
622	RB: Many times.
623	I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.
630	Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --
634	and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.
638	So in those moments,
640	you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or --
643	CA: What was the closest you got to --
645	when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out?
649	RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,
654	each one, actually, I think we came close.
657	And, I mean, first of all we --
660	nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,
664	so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,
671	and we weren't quite sure,
673	when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,
675	whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
681	And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,
687	as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --
690	the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,
695	the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,
699	and it just took off.
701	And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
705	And we were just crossing every finger,
708	praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
714	But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --
719	something seemed to go wrong every time,
721	and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me
727	jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.
732	(Laughter)
735	"CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, ""I'm out of here!"" and ..."
738	RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,
742	the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ...
748	CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
751	RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,
755	with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,
758	trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --
763	and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
765	But, anyway, we managed to survive it.
767	CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
769	RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,
775	and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,
779	I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.
782	So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried
786	to make sure that I was making the right decision.
789	And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,
793	looked down at those clouds again,
794	climbed back into the capsule again.
796	And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.
799	I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,
802	it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?
807	And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,
812	and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.
816	And the balloon hit the sea
818	and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
822	But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and --
825	CA: What did you write to your family?
828	RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:
832	just I love you very much. And
835	I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --
840	just in case anything had happened.
842	But fortunately, they never had to use it.
847	CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.
854	The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,
859	you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.
863	And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy
867	doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.
872	How much was the PR value part of this?
877	RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,
884	the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,
889	and crashing into the seas.
892	(Laughter)
896	CA: They have a point, Richard.
898	RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,
902	you know, come on, Richard,
904	there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.
907	(Laughter)
908	CA: To do all this,
910	you must have been a genius from the get-go, right?
914	RB: Well, I won't contradict that.
917	(Laughter)
918	CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK.
922	Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school?
926	RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.
937	I certainly would have failed IQ tests.
940	And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.
947	And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.
955	As somebody who's dyslexic,
956	you also have some quite bizarre situations.
958	I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,
963	I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,
966	but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.
972	And so the board meetings have been fascinating.
975	(Laughter)
976	And so, it's like, good news or bad news?
978	And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news.
981	CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?
984	(Laughter)
985	RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --
988	(Laughter) --
991	I've got it right.
993	CA: No, trust me, it's gross.
995	(Laughter)
998	RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,
1002	"""Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram."
1005	Here's a net in the sea,
1007	and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.
1011	And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,
1014	"everything else is eaten."""
1016	And I finally worked it all out.
1019	(Laughter)
1020	(Applause)
1022	CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,
1025	you know, doing pretty miserably academically,
1027	but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.
1030	So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,
1032	but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ...
1038	RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,
1046	yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,
1048	and so at least I had something to excel at, at school.
1053	CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.
1055	I mean, there's the story about your mother
1057	"allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying ""OK, walk home."""
1062	Did this really happen?
1063	RB: She was, you know,
1065	she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.
1068	So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,
1072	such as pushing us out of the car,
1076	and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,
1078	about five miles before we actually got there.
1082	And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.
1085	And we were never allowed to watch television and the like.
1088	CA: But is there a risk here?
1089	I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,
1092	and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.
1095	Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think
1098	they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,
1100	we're going to raise a generation of privileged ...
1102	RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,
1105	you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.
1112	So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
1118	CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...
1121	Your headmaster said to you --
1123	I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --
1126	he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,
1129	and I'm not sure which.
1131	Which of those happened first?
1134	(Laughter)
1135	RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.
1139	I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.
1145	I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act
1149	and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.
1151	On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --
1157	we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.
1161	And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.
1164	And there's an ancient law that says
1165	you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.
1169	So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us
1172	if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.
1174	We changed it to social diseases
1176	and people came along with acne and spots,
1178	but nobody came with VD any more.
1180	So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.
1184	"And then subsequently, ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,"""
1188	the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested
1195	for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.
1198	And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.
1202	And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert
1207	to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.
1211	And so I rang up Nottingham University,
1213	and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.
1215	"And he said, ""Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever."
1220	"It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century."""
1224	(Laughter)
1227	"And he went, ""Furthermore, I'm a priest myself."""
1231	"And so I said, ""Would you mind coming to the court?"""
1233	And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --
1235	"and he said, ""Would you like me to wear my dog collar?"""
1237	"And I said, ""Yes, definitely. Please."""
1239	(Laughter)
1241	CA: That's great.
1242	RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually
1244	"""Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols."""
1246	(Laughter)
1248	And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...
1251	(Laughter)
1252	CA: That is outrageous.
1255	(Applause)
1257	So seriously, is there a dark side?
1262	A lot of people would say there's no way
1264	that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses
1267	without knifing a few people in the back,
1270	you know, doing some ugly things.
1272	You've been accused of being ruthless.
1274	There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.
1276	Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it?
1280	RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype
1283	of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,
1288	generally speaking, works.
1290	I think if you treat people well,
1292	people will come back and come back for more.
1297	And I think all you have in life is your reputation
1300	and it's a very small world.
1305	And I actually think that the best way
1309	of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,
1316	and I like to think that's how we run Virgin.
1321	CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --
1325	you keep getting caught up in these new projects,
1327	but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.
1330	You get excited by an idea and, kapow!
1332	I mean, do you think about life balance?
1335	How do your family feel about
1337	each time you step into something big and new?
1340	RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,
1344	so from the time the kids were very young,
1347	you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.
1351	And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.
1357	Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,
1360	we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --
1364	so I can take them there and we can bring friends,
1368	and we can play together,
1370	but I can also keep in touch with what's going on.
1374	CA: You started talking in recent years
1376	about this term capitalist philanthropy.
1378	What is that?
1380	RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.
1384	You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.
1389	But the problem with capitalism is
1391	extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,
1394	and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.
1399	And I think it's important that the individuals,
1403	who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing
1408	for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,
1410	but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs
1416	or to tackle issues around the world.
1420	CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,
1423	want to turn your resources toward?
1427	RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.
1430	I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind
1437	and we are putting a lot of time and energy into,
1441	A, trying to come up with alternative fuels
1445	and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize
1454	in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,
1458	in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions
1461	cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.
1464	We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way
1468	of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.
1471	And we just -- you know, there weren't really people
1474	working on that before, so we wanted people to try to --
1478	all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,
1481	and also to try to extract the methane
1483	out of the Earth's atmosphere as well.
1486	And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms
1491	saying they want to give it a go.
1493	And so we only need one, so we're hopeful.
1496	CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects?
1500	RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called
1504	the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.
1506	We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room
1510	to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,
1514	all the different social problems in Africa,
1517	and try to look at best practices.
1521	So, for instance,
1524	there's a doctor in Africa that's found that
1527	if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,
1533	that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.
1540	And so disseminating that information to
1545	around the rest of Africa is important.
1547	CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.
1550	And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West
1555	get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,
1559	getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly
1562	in their ability to make a difference in the world.
1564	Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,
1567	we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,
1570	I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --
1573	here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation
1577	and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that?
1582	RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --
1589	we're working with the government on it.
1591	I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting
1595	HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,
1600	of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,
1606	it's a way of working with him, with his government.
1609	It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,
1611	they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.
1614	It's got to be consistent.
1616	But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how
1622	and help governments approach things slightly differently.
1626	For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa
1629	where we're going to be giving
1631	free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment
1633	and free malaria treatment.
1636	But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,
1639	so that people pay for some other aspects.
1643	CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,
1647	or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by
1650	some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,
1653	for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.
1658	What would you say to them?
1659	RB: Well, I think that everybody --
1661	people do things for a whole variety of different reasons
1665	and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,
1667	I will want to feel that I've made a difference
1670	to other people's lives.
1672	And that may be a selfish thing to think,
1675	but it's the way I've been brought up.
1677	I think if I'm in a position to
1679	radically change other people's lives for the better,
1682	I should do so.
1684	CA: How old are you?
1685	RB: I'm 56.
1686	CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him
1691	and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by
1697	this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.
1706	and a search for legacy.
1708	I mean, it seems like you're still
1710	a little bit in the growth phases,
1712	you're still doing these incredible new plans.
1714	How much do you think about legacy,
1716	and what would you like your legacy to be?
1721	RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.
1724	I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,
1730	so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.
1734	No, I just want to live life to its full.
1740	You know, if I can make a difference,
1742	I hope to be able to make a difference.
1744	And I think one of the positive things at the moment is
1747	you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,
1751	who are good friends.
1753	And, thank God, you've got two people
1756	who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.
1760	If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,
1763	it would be very worrying.
1765	And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.
1768	And I think it's important
1770	that people in that kind of position do make a difference.
1774	CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,
1775	I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --
1778	I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless
1780	and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.
1784	And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,
1786	well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.
1788	So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,
1791	and for coming to TED today. Thank you.
1793	Thank you so much.
1794	(Applause)
