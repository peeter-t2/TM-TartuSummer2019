12.466	Four years ago today, exactly, actually,
14.563	I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.
17.659	Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine
21.779	for teenage girls called Rookiemag.com.
25.654	My name's Tavi Gevinson, and
29.845	"the title of my talk is ""Still Figuring It Out,"""
32.985	and the MS Paint quality of my slides
35.232	was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme,
38.544	and has nothing to do with my inability
40.16	to use PowerPoint. (Laughter)
43.505	So I edit this site for teenage girls. I'm a feminist.
48.065	I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about
50.936	what makes a strong female character,
53.352	and, you know, movies and TV shows,
55.44	these things have influence. My own website.
59.706	So I think the question of what makes a strong female
62.497	character often goes misinterpreted,
64.874	and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen
68.167	who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot,
71.759	like a Catwoman type,
74.352	or she plays her sexuality up a lot,
78.23	and it's seen as power.
79.422	But they're not strong characters who happen to be female.
82.821	They're completely flat,
84.549	and they're basically cardboard characters.
87.033	The problem with this is that then
88.866	people expect women to be that easy to understand,
92.712	and women are mad at themselves
95.039	for not being that simple,
96.381	when, in actuality, women are complicated,
99.338	women are multifaceted -- not because women are crazy,
102.736	but because people are crazy,
104.488	and women happen to be people. (Laughter)
108.15	So the flaws are the key.
110.435	I'm not the first person to say this.
112.278	What makes a strong female character
114.326	is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws,
119.23	who is maybe not immediately likable,
121.214	but eventually relatable.
123.676	I don't like to acknowledge a problem
125.145	without also acknowledging those who work to fix it,
127.811	"so just wanted to acknowledge shows like ""Mad Men,"""
130.878	"movies like ""Bridesmaids,"" whose female characters"
133.758	or protagonists are complex, multifaceted.
137.889	Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO
142.105	"that premiers next month, ""Girls,"""
144.296	she said she wanted to start it because she felt that
146.813	every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions,
149.801	and that feels accurate for all people,
152.009	but you don't see women represented like that as much.
154.673	Congrats, guys. (Laughs)
158.257	But I don't feel that — I still feel that there are some types
161.96	of women who are not represented that way,
164.496	and one group that we'll focus on today are teens,
166.952	because I think teenagers are especially contradictory
170.232	and still figuring it out,
173.272	"and in the '90s there was ""Freaks and Geeks"""
176.621	"and ""My So-Called Life,"" and their characters,"
179.4	Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase,
182.056	I mean, the whole premise of the shows
184.744	were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically,
188.19	but those shows only lasted a season each,
191.288	and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.
196.25	So this is a scientific diagram of my brain — (Laughter) —
202.636	around the time when I was,
204.108	when I started watching those TV shows.
206.75	I was ending middle school, starting high school --
208.945	I'm a sophomore now —
211.209	and I was trying to reconcile
213.965	all of these differences that you're told you can't be
216.624	when you're growing up as a girl.
217.971	You can't be smart and pretty.
220.591	You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.
223.414	You can't care about clothes if it's not for the sake
227.308	of what other people, usually men, will think of you.
230.341	So I was trying to figure all that out,
233.312	and I felt a little confused,
236.613	and I said so on my blog,
238.355	and I said that I wanted to start
242.54	a website for teenage girls
245.044	that was not this kind of one-dimensional
248.482	strong character empowerment thing
251.186	because I think one thing that can be very alienating
254.176	about a misconception of feminism is that
256.808	girls then think that to be a feminist, they have to live up to
260.403	being perfectly consistent in your beliefs,
262.894	never being insecure, never having doubts,
266.305	having all of the answers. And this is not true,
269.207	and, actually, reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling
273.26	became easier once I understood that feminism
277.019	was not a rulebook but a discussion,
279.206	a conversation, a process,
281.33	and this is a spread from a zine that I made last year
284.501	when I -- I mean, I think I've let myself go a bit
287.851	on the illustration front since.
289.954	But, yeah.
293.944	So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication
298.343	for teenage girls and ask people to submit
300.832	their writing, their photography, whatever,
302.952	to be a member of our staff.
304.603	I got about 3,000 emails.
307.527	My editorial director and I went through them and
310.199	put together a staff of people,
313.202	and we launched last September.
315.802	And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter,
318.157	where I say that Rookie, we don't have all the answers,
321.511	we're still figuring it out too, but the point is not to
324.24	give girls the answers, and not even give them permission
328.199	to find the answers themselves,
330.773	but hopefully inspire them to understand that
332.941	they can give themselves that permission,
334.664	they can ask their own questions, find their own answers,
337.548	all of that, and Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it
340.299	a nice place for all of that to be figured out.
345.642	"So I'm not saying, ""Be like us,"""
347.577	"and ""We're perfect role models,"" because we're not,"
349.945	but we just want to help represent girls
355.057	in a way that shows those different dimensions.
358.078	I mean, we have articles called
361.872	"""On Taking Yourself Seriously: How to Not Care What People Think of You,"""
365.054	but we also have articles like,
367.021	oops -- I'm figuring it out!
370.982	Ha ha. (Laughter)
373.508	If you use that, you can get away with anything.
377.306	We also have articles called
378.497	"""How to Look Like You Weren't Just Crying in Less than Five Minutes."""
382.003	So all of that being said, I still really appreciate
385.036	those characters in movies and
389.003	articles like that on our site,
390.816	that aren't just about being totally powerful,
394.059	maybe finding your acceptance with yourself
397.109	and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those.
402.668	So what I you to take away from my talk,
406.286	the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.
410.508	Like, that's all you have to do. (Laughter)
413.882	Because my favorite thing about her,
416.761	other than, like, everything, is that
419.821	she is very -- has always been
422.229	unapologetically present on stage,
425.134	and unapologetic about her flaws
427.941	and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings
432.079	and she makes you listen to them and think about them,
435.671	and yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.
437.053	Thank you. (Applause)
