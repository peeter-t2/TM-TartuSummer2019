15.609	I would like to talk to you
15.609	about why many ehealth projects fail.
20.157	And I really think
20.157	that the most important thing of it
22.902	is that we stopped listening to patients.
25.85	And one thing we did at Radboud University
27.901	is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.
29.936	Not in a very scientific way --
31.567	she puts up a little cup
31.567	of coffee or a cup of tea
34.952	and asks patients, family, relatives,
37.619	"""What's up?"
38.806	"How could we help you?"""
40.723	And we think, we like to think,
42.391	that this is one of the major problems
44.244	why all -- maybe not all --
46.396	but most of the ehealth projects fail,
48.26	since we stopped listening.
50.466	This is my weight scale.
52.136	It's a very simple thing.
52.136	It's got one knob, on/off.
55.317	And every morning I hop on it.
58.108	And yes, I've got a challenge,
60.059	as you might see.
61.889	And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
64.899	But the thing is that
64.899	it's made this simple
67.496	that whenever I hop on,
69.111	it sends my data to Google Health as well.
72.551	And it's collected
72.551	by my general practitioner as well,
75.837	so he can see what's my problem in weight,
79.26	not on the very moment
79.26	that I need cardiologic support
82.961	or something like it,
84.176	but also looking backward.
86.834	But there's another thing.
88.218	As some of you might know,
89.721	I've got more than 4000
89.721	followers on Twitter.
92.071	So every morning, I hop on my weight scale
95.713	and before I'm in my car,
97.001	people start talking to me,
98.334	"""I think you need"
98.334	"a light lunch today, Lucien."""
100.656	(Laughter)
101.831	But that's the nicest thing
101.831	that could happen,
103.998	since this is peer pressure.
105.577	Peer pressure used to help patients --
109.261	since this could be used for obesity,
111.127	it could be used
111.127	to stop patients from smoking.
114.744	But on the other hand,
116.007	it also could be used
116.007	to get people out of their chairs
119.564	and try to work together
119.564	in some kind of gaming activity
123.214	to get more control of their health.
125.486	As of next week,
125.486	it will soon be available,
128.26	there will be this little
128.26	blood-pressure meter
130.598	connected to an iPhone
130.598	or something or other.
133.84	And people will be able, from their homes,
136.612	to take their blood pressure,
138.192	send it to their doctor
139.905	and eventually share it
139.905	with others, for instance,
142.615	for over a 100 dollars.
144.546	And this is the point
144.546	where patients get into position
147.539	and can collect,
147.539	not only their own control again,
150.523	be captain of their own ship,
152.468	but also can help us in health care
154.809	due to the challenges that we face,
156.811	like health-care cost explosion,
159.673	doubled demand and things like that,
161.544	make techniques that are easy to use
163.75	and start with this
163.75	to embrace patients in the team.
167.118	And you can do this
167.118	with techniques like this,
169.403	but also by crowdsourcing.
171.372	And one of the things we did,
172.999	that I would like to share with you
172.999	introduced by a little video.
176.35	(Music)
244.095	(Heart-beat)
248.341	We've all got
248.341	navigation controls in our car.
251.001	We maybe even have it in our cellphone.
253.663	We perfectly know where all the ATMs are,
256.056	just about the city of Maastricht.
257.989	The other thing is we know
257.989	where all the gas stations are.
261.049	And sure, we could find fast food chains.
264.129	But where would be the nearest AED
264.129	to help this patient?
268.33	We asked around, and nobody knew.
270.931	Nobody knew where
270.931	the nearest lifesaving AED
273.866	was to be obtained right now.
275.946	So what we did,
275.946	we crowdsourced the Netherlands.
278.402	We set up a website, and asked the crowd,
281.106	"""If you see an AED, please submit it,"
283.442	tell us where it is,
283.442	"tell us when it's open,"""
286.26	since sometimes in office hours
286.26	it's closed, of course.
289.246	And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands
291.446	already have been submitted.
292.908	The next step we took
292.908	was to find the applications for it.
295.829	And we built an iPad application.
297.905	We made an application
297.905	for Layar: Augmented Reality,
300.954	to find these AEDs.
302.722	And whenever you are
302.722	in a city like Maastricht,
305.029	and somebody collapses,
305.029	you can use your iPhone,
307.653	and within the next weeks
307.653	also your Microsoft cellphone,
311.223	to find the nearest AED,
312.662	which can save lives.
314.692	And as of today,
316.02	we would like to introduce this,
316.02	not only as AED4EU,
318.738	which is what the product is called,
320.477	but also AED4US.
322.26	And we would like to start this
322.26	on a worldwide level.
324.804	And ask all of our colleagues
324.804	in the rest of the world,
327.771	colleague universities, to help us
329.842	to find and work and act like a hub
332.49	to crowdsource all these AEDs
332.49	all around the world,
335.844	that whenever you're on holiday
335.844	and somebody collapses,
338.833	might it be your own relative
338.833	or someone just in front of you,
342.338	you can find this.
343.935	The other thing we would like to ask
345.674	is of companies also all over the world
347.773	that will be able to help us
347.773	validate these AEDs.
350.83	These might be courier services
352.672	or cable guys, for instance,
354.387	just to see whether
354.387	the AED that is submitted
356.773	is still in place.
358.363	So please help us on this one
360.26	and try to make not only
360.26	health a little bit better,
363.236	but take control of it.
364.428	Thank you.
365.618	(Applause)
