180.697	Water
187.659	Boy
190.343	(Guitar strum)
191.398	where are you hidin'?
195.743	(Guitar strum)
196.774	If you don't come right here,
198.34	if you don't come right here,
199.798	if you don't come right here,
201.229	I'm gonna tell
207.935	your pa
211.408	on you.
215.165	(Guitar strum)
216.232	(Applause)
226.136	Thank you.
230.292	That was a song based on
230.292	numerous work songs,
233.403	and it was arranged by Odetta,
235.466	a hero of mine.
237.142	And this next song, well,
239.841	I do a lot of historical music,
242.045	starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops
244.091	and continuing on in my solo endeavors.
246.341	And I believe that knowing
246.341	your history as a musician
250.024	is super important --
251.248	it's important as a person,
252.877	it's important as a country,
254.409	it's important as a people.
255.823	So I read a lot about where
255.823	the music comes from
258.918	and where this country comes from.
260.563	I've been reading a lot
260.563	about the Civil War
262.711	and about slavery.
263.919	And it's really tough.
265.57	You know?
266.748	It's really tough reading.
268.024	And so as an artist,
268.024	what I do with all that emotion,
270.568	reading these people's stories,
272.182	"not just, ""Oh, slavery was terrible."""
274.015	Yes, it was.
275.345	But it's reading individual narratives
275.345	of how it was for these people.
280.297	You know?
281.48	"Then it's like, ""Yeah,"
281.48	"that could've been me."""
283.836	And it is people now. You know?
285.554	So what you do with all that emotion
287.317	is you've got to do something with it.
289.174	As an artist, I write.
290.351	So I wrote a song based on
290.351	some of those narratives that I read,
293.494	"and it's called, ""Come Love Come."""
295.585	We're going to do it for you now.
300.897	(Claps)
306.913	(Sings) Come love come,
308.728	the road lies low,
310.312	the way is long and hard, I know.
313.58	Come love come,
315.114	the road lies free,
317.028	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
320.541	(Music)
333.403	(Sings) When I was four,
335.029	my loving mam was cornered
335.029	by the boss's man.
339.903	She turned her head and got struck down,
343.221	they buried her in the cold, cold ground.
346.527	Come love come,
348.131	the road lies low,
349.917	the way is long and hard, I know.
353.098	Come love come,
354.88	the road lies free,
356.492	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
359.413	(Music)
366.287	When I was 12,
367.687	my father dear
369.42	was strong of arm and free of fear
372.84	until the day he raised his hand,
375.989	then he was sold to Alabama.
379.211	Come love come,
381.091	the road lies low,
382.93	the way is long and hard, I know.
386.074	Come love come,
387.639	the road lies free,
389.422	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
392.564	(Music)
405.499	When I was 16, found my bloom
408.79	and found my man,
410.272	we jumped the broom.
411.842	We pledged each other
411.842	the rest of our lives
414.92	and on Saturday nights
414.92	we were man and wife.
418.357	Come love come,
420.037	the road lies low,
421.699	the way is long and hard, I know.
424.884	Come love come,
426.525	the road lies free,
428.141	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
431.479	(Music)
444.088	When I was 18,
445.759	bugles called
447.356	and boys in blue came o'er the wall.
450.514	I took my chance and followed free,
453.726	they led the way to Tennessee.
457.078	Come love come,
458.794	the road lies low,
460.47	the way is long and hard, I know.
463.623	Come love come,
465.314	the road lies free,
466.961	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
470.969	(Music)
482.689	Now here I sit in a tiny shack
485.763	with 13 others at my back.
488.926	I've sent you word,
490.521	so all I can do
492.139	is wait and wait and wait and wait
495.288	and wait
500.736	and wait for you.
504.761	Come love come,
506.55	the road lies low,
508.18	the way is long and hard, I know.
511.268	Come love come,
512.86	the road lies free,
514.576	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
517.703	Come love come,
519.381	the road lies low,
520.957	the way is long and hard, I know.
524.18	Come love come,
525.784	the road lies free,
527.428	I'll wait for you in Tennessee.
538.235	Oh,
543.558	oh,
549.514	oh.
552.396	Whoa ... oh I'll wait for you.
559.311	I'll wait for you.
562.416	I'll wait for you
567.225	I'll wait for you.
569.951	(Applause)
583.465	Thank you.
585.001	So, with the dark
585.001	you have to have the light.
589.208	And in the African-American community,
591.132	it's been the work of many
591.132	hundreds of years
593.377	to find a way to lift ourselves up.
595.487	So I'm going to end with a couple
595.487	of tunes from Sister Rosetta Tharpe,
599.774	one of the more influential
599.774	American music figures
602.809	that most of you probably never heard of.
604.859	If you have, I'm so happy.
606.999	She's one of the innovators
606.999	of rock 'n' roll guitar,
609.487	and one of the first crossover artists
609.487	from gospel to secular.
613.14	She's an incredibly important figure,
614.938	and I'm going to talk about her
614.938	whenever I can.
617.155	So these are a couple of her tunes.
618.846	And don't worry -- you're going to get
618.846	your chance to sing.
621.879	(Music)
