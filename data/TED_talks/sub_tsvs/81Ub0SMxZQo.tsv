12.719	Everyone needs a coach.
15.612	It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player,
18.713	a tennis player, a gymnast
21.991	or a bridge player.
24.212	(Laughter)
26.701	My bridge coach, Sharon Osberg,
29.16	says there are more pictures of the back of her head
31.415	than anyone else's in the world. (Laughter)
34.932	Sorry, Sharon. Here you go.
38.594	We all need people who will give us feedback.
42.185	That's how we improve.
44.422	Unfortunately, there's one group of people
47.402	who get almost no systematic feedback
50.208	to help them do their jobs better,
52.393	and these people
53.792	have one of the most important jobs in the world.
56.942	I'm talking about teachers.
59.171	When Melinda and I learned
61.11	how little useful feedback most teachers get,
64.322	we were blown away.
66.276	Until recently, over 98 percent of teachers
70.4	just got one word of feedback:
73.053	Satisfactory.
75.773	If all my bridge coach ever told me
78.266	"was that I was ""satisfactory,"""
80.651	I would have no hope of ever getting better.
83.428	How would I know who was the best?
86.726	How would I know what I was doing differently?
90.326	Today, districts are revamping
92.71	the way they evaluate teachers,
94.994	but we still give them almost no feedback
98.303	that actually helps them improve their practice.
101.476	Our teachers deserve better.
104.808	The system we have today isn't fair to them.
108.036	It's not fair to students,
109.857	and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.
114.887	So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers
118.346	get the tools for improvement they want and deserve.
122.604	Let's start by asking who's doing well.
126.47	Well, unfortunately there's no international ranking tables
129.938	for teacher feedback systems.
131.864	So I looked at the countries
133.654	whose students perform well academically,
136.759	and looked at what they're doing
139.064	to help their teachers improve.
142.103	Consider the rankings for reading proficiency.
145.336	The U.S. isn't number one.
147.826	We're not even in the top 10.
149.881	We're tied for 15th with Iceland and Poland.
154.819	Now, out of all the places
157.045	that do better than the U.S. in reading,
159.635	how many of them have a formal system
162.174	for helping teachers improve?
165.165	Eleven out of 14.
168	The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading,
170.565	but we're 23rd in science and 31st in math.
175.166	So there's really only one area where we're near the top,
178.25	and that's in failing to give our teachers
180.422	the help they need to develop their skills.
184.043	Let's look at the best academic performer:
187.6	the province of Shanghai, China.
190.765	Now, they rank number one across the board,
194.098	in reading, math and science,
197.017	and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success
200.388	is the way they help teachers keep improving.
204.022	They made sure that younger teachers
206.351	get a chance to watch master teachers at work.
210.018	They have weekly study groups,
212.292	where teachers get together and talk about what's working.
215.126	They even require each teacher to observe
218.481	and give feedback to their colleagues.
221.619	You might ask, why is a system like this so important?
225.318	It's because there's so much variation
228.176	in the teaching profession.
230.257	Some teachers are far more effective than others.
234.414	In fact, there are teachers throughout the country
237.103	who are helping their students make extraordinary gains.
240.656	If today's average teacher
242.899	could become as good as those teachers,
245.495	our students would be blowing away the rest of the world.
249.671	So we need a system that helps all our teachers
252.578	be as good as the best.
254.59	What would that system look like?
257.187	Well, to find out, our foundation
259.212	has been working with 3,000 teachers
261.663	in districts across the country
263.847	on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching.
268.066	We had observers watch videos
270.417	of teachers in the classroom
272.163	and rate how they did on a range of practices.
275.751	For example, did they ask their students
277.589	challenging questions?
279.68	Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea?
283.997	We also had students fill out surveys with questions like,
288.497	"""Does your teacher know"
290.21	"when the class understands a lesson?"""
292.767	"""Do you learn to correct your mistakes?"""
295.923	And what we found is very exciting.
298.752	First, the teachers who did well on these observations
302.871	had far better student outcomes.
305.322	So it tells us we're asking the right questions.
308.58	And second, teachers in the program told us
311.393	that these videos and these surveys from the students
314.943	were very helpful diagnostic tools,
317.626	because they pointed to specific places
320.255	where they can improve.
322.283	I want to show you what this video component of MET
326.326	looks like in action.
328.91	(Music)
331.857	(Video) Sarah Brown Wessling: Good morning everybody.
333.538	Let's talk about what's going on today.
335.706	To get started, we're doing a peer review day, okay?
339.055	A peer review day, and our goal by the end of class
341.51	is for you to be able to determine
343.393	whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays.
346.347	My name is Sarah Brown Wessling.
347.816	I am a high school English teacher
349.501	at Johnston High School in Johnston, Iowa.
351.564	Turn to somebody next to you.
353.311	Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about --
356.11	I think that there is a difference for teachers
358.771	between the abstract of how we see our practice
362.244	and then the concrete reality of it.
363.887	Okay, so I would like you to please bring up your papers.
367.437	I think what video offers for us
370.08	is a certain degree of reality.
372.394	You can't really dispute what you see on the video,
375.03	and there is a lot to be learned from that,
377.989	and there are a lot of ways that we can grow
379.918	as a profession when we actually get to see this.
382.849	I just have a flip camera and a little tripod
385.842	and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens.
389.252	At the beginning of class, I just perch it
391.76	in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot.
394.185	It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on.
396.923	But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot.
400.203	And I'm able to learn a lot from it.
402.252	So it really has been a simple
405.137	but powerful tool in my own reflection.
407.983	All right, let's take a look at the long one first, okay?
411.032	Once I'm finished taping, then I put it in my computer,
413.8	and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it.
416.436	If I don't write things down, I don't remember them.
418.548	So having the notes is a part of my thinking process,
422.203	and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing.
426.29	I really have used it for my own personal growth
428.319	and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy
431.245	and methodology and classroom management,
434.514	and just all of those different facets of the classroom.
438.02	I'm glad that we've actually done the process before
440.694	so we can kind of compare what works, what doesn't.
443.219	I think that video exposes
446.544	so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers
450.028	in ways that help us learn and help us understand,
453.185	and then help our broader communities understand
455.792	what this complex work is really all about.
459.628	I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate
463.76	things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan,
466.675	things you cannot convey in a standard,
468.828	things that you cannot even sometimes convey
471.057	in a book of pedagogy.
473.867	Alrighty, everybody, have a great weekend.
476.233	I'll see you later.
477.469	[Every classroom could look like that]
479.756	(Applause)
485.183	Bill Gates: One day, we'd like every classroom in America
488.155	to look something like that.
490.839	But we still have more work to do.
493.46	Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve
496.18	is only half the battle.
498.767	We also have to give them the tools they need
501.152	to act on the diagnosis.
503.65	If you learn that you need to improve
505.565	the way you teach fractions,
507.306	you should be able to watch a video
509.814	of the best person in the world teaching fractions.
513.526	So building this complete teacher feedback
516.268	and improvement system won't be easy.
519.378	For example, I know some teachers
521.388	aren't immediately comfortable with the idea
523.856	of a camera in the classroom.
526.656	That's understandable, but our experience with MET
529.972	suggests that if teachers manage the process,
533.417	if they collect video in their own classrooms,
535.902	and they pick the lessons they want to submit,
538.878	a lot of them will be eager to participate.
542.639	Building this system will also require
545.592	a considerable investment.
548.615	Our foundation estimates that it could cost
551.972	up to five billion dollars.
554.127	Now that's a big number, but to put it in perspective,
558.481	it's less than two percent
560.474	of what we spend every year on teacher salaries.
564.769	The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.
568.081	We would finally have a way to give them feedback,
572.038	as well as the means to act on it.
574.735	But this system would have
575.92	an even more important benefit for our country.
579.71	It would put us on a path to making sure
582.883	all our students get a great education,
586.082	find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding,
588.773	and have a chance to live out their dreams.
592.012	This wouldn't just make us a more successful country.
596.366	It would also make us a more fair and just one, too.
601.87	I'm excited about the opportunity
604.605	to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve.
609.354	I hope you are too.
611.081	Thank you.
612.852	(Applause)
