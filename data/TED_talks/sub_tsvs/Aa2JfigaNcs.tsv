15.33	I study how the brain processes
17.33	information. That is, how it takes
19.33	information in from the outside world, and
21.33	converts it into patterns of electrical activity,
23.33	and then how it uses those patterns
25.33	to allow you to do things --
27.33	to see, hear, to reach for an object.
29.33	So I'm really a basic scientist, not
31.33	a clinician, but in the last year and a half
33.33	I've started to switch over, to use what
35.33	we've been learning about these patterns
37.33	of activity to develop prosthetic devices,
40.33	and what I wanted to do today is show you
42.33	an example of this.
44.33	It's really our first foray into this.
46.33	It's the development of a prosthetic device
48.33	for treating blindness.
50.33	So let me start in on that problem.
52.33	There are 10 million people in the U.S.
54.33	and many more worldwide who are blind
56.33	or are facing blindness due to diseases
58.33	of the retina, diseases like
60.33	macular degeneration, and there's little
62.33	that can be done for them.
64.33	There are some drug treatments, but
66.33	they're only effective on a small fraction
68.33	of the population. And so, for the vast
70.33	majority of patients, their best hope for
72.33	regaining sight is through prosthetic devices.
74.33	The problem is that current prosthetics
76.33	don't work very well. They're still very
78.33	limited in the vision that they can provide.
80.33	And so, you know, for example, with these
82.33	devices, patients can see simple things
84.33	like bright lights and high contrast edges,
86.33	not very much more, so nothing close
88.33	to normal vision has been possible.
91.33	So what I'm going to tell you about today
93.33	is a device that we've been working on
95.33	that I think has the potential to make
97.33	a difference, to be much more effective,
99.33	and what I wanted to do is show you
101.33	how it works. Okay, so let me back up a
103.33	little bit and show you how a normal retina
105.33	works first so you can see the problem
107.33	that we were trying to solve.
109.33	Here you have a retina.
111.33	So you have an image, a retina, and a brain.
113.33	So when you look at something, like this image
115.33	of this baby's face, it goes into your eye
117.33	and it lands on your retina, on the front-end
119.33	cells here, the photoreceptors.
121.33	Then what happens is the retinal circuitry,
123.33	the middle part, goes to work on it,
125.33	and what it does is it performs operations
127.33	on it, it extracts information from it, and it
129.33	converts that information into a code.
131.33	And the code is in the form of these patterns
133.33	of electrical pulses that get sent
135.33	up to the brain, and so the key thing is
137.33	that the image ultimately gets converted
139.33	into a code. And when I say code,
141.33	I do literally mean code.
143.33	"Like this pattern of pulses here actually means ""baby's face,"""
146.33	and so when the brain gets this pattern
148.33	of pulses, it knows that what was out there
150.33	was a baby's face, and if it
152.33	got a different pattern it would know
154.33	that what was out there was, say, a dog,
156.33	or another pattern would be a house.
158.33	Anyway, you get the idea.
160.33	And, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,
162.33	meaning that it's changing all the time,
164.33	so the patterns of pulses are changing
166.33	all the time because the world you're
168.33	looking at is changing all the time too.
171.33	So, you know, it's sort of a complicated
173.33	thing. You have these patterns of pulses
175.33	coming out of your eye every millisecond
177.33	telling your brain what it is that you're seeing.
179.33	So what happens when a person
181.33	gets a retinal degenerative disease like
183.33	macular degeneration? What happens is
185.33	is that, the front-end cells die,
187.33	the photoreceptors die, and over time,
189.33	all the cells and the circuits that are
191.33	connected to them, they die too.
193.33	Until the only things that you have left
195.33	are these cells here, the output cells,
197.33	the ones that send the signals to the brain,
199.33	but because of all that degeneration
201.33	they aren't sending any signals anymore.
203.33	They aren't getting any input, so
205.33	the person's brain no longer gets
207.33	any visual information --
209.33	that is, he or she is blind.
212.33	So, a solution to the problem, then,
214.33	would be to build a device that could mimic
216.33	the actions of that front-end circuitry
218.33	and send signals to the retina's output cells,
220.33	and they can go back to doing their
222.33	normal job of sending signals to the brain.
224.33	So this is what we've been working on,
226.33	and this is what our prosthetic does.
228.33	So it consists of two parts, what we call
230.33	an encoder and a transducer.
232.33	And so the encoder does just
234.33	what I was saying: it mimics the actions
236.33	of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images
238.33	in and converts them into the retina's code.
240.33	And then the transducer then makes the
242.33	output cells send the code on up
244.33	to the brain, and the result is
246.33	a retinal prosthetic that can produce
249.33	normal retinal output.
251.33	So a completely blind retina,
253.33	even one with no front-end circuitry at all,
255.33	no photoreceptors,
257.33	can now send out normal signals,
259.33	signals that the brain can understand.
262.33	So no other device has been able
264.33	to do this.
266.33	Okay, so I just want to take
268.33	a sentence or two to say something about
270.33	the encoder and what it's doing, because
272.33	it's really the key part and it's
274.33	sort of interesting and kind of cool.
276.33	"I'm not sure ""cool"" is really the right word, but"
278.33	you know what I mean.
280.33	So what it's doing is, it's replacing
282.33	the retinal circuitry, really the guts of
284.33	the retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,
286.33	a set of equations that we can implement
288.33	on a chip. So it's just math.
290.33	In other words, we're not literally replacing
293.33	the components of the retina.
295.33	It's not like we're making a little mini-device
297.33	for each of the different cell types.
299.33	We've just abstracted what the
301.33	retina's doing with a set of equations.
303.33	And so, in a way, the equations are serving
305.33	as sort of a codebook. An image comes in,
307.33	goes through the set of equations,
310.33	and out comes streams of electrical pulses,
312.33	just like a normal retina would produce.
316.33	Now let me put my money
318.33	where my mouth is and show you that
320.33	we can actually produce normal output,
322.33	and what the implications of this are.
324.33	Here are three sets of
326.33	firing patterns. The top one is from
328.33	a normal animal, the middle one is from
330.33	a blind animal that's been treated with
332.33	this encoder-transducer device, and the
334.33	bottom one is from a blind animal treated
336.33	with a standard prosthetic.
338.33	So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art
340.33	device that's out there right now, which is
342.33	basically made up of light detectors,
344.33	but no encoder. So what we did was we
346.33	presented movies of everyday things --
348.33	people, babies, park benches,
350.33	you know, regular things happening -- and
352.33	we recorded the responses from the retinas
354.33	of these three groups of animals.
356.33	Now just to orient you, each box is showing
358.33	the firing patterns of several cells,
360.33	and just as in the previous slides,
362.33	each row is a different cell,
364.33	and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller
366.33	and thinner so I could show you
369.33	a long stretch of data.
371.33	So as you can see, the firing patterns
373.33	from the blind animal treated with
375.33	the encoder-transducer really do very
377.33	closely match the normal firing patterns --
379.33	and it's not perfect, but it's pretty good --
381.33	and the blind animal treated with
383.33	the standard prosthetic,
385.33	the responses really don't.
387.33	And so with the standard method,
390.33	the cells do fire, they just don't fire
392.33	in the normal firing patterns because
394.33	they don't have the right code.
396.33	How important is this?
398.33	What's the potential impact
400.33	on a patient's ability to see?
403.33	So I'm just going to show you one
405.33	bottom-line experiment that answers this,
407.33	and of course I've got a lot of other data,
409.33	so if you're interested I'm happy
411.33	to show more. So the experiment
413.33	is called a reconstruction experiment.
415.33	So what we did is we took a moment
417.33	in time from these recordings and asked,
420.33	what was the retina seeing at that moment?
422.33	Can we reconstruct what the retina
424.33	was seeing from the responses
426.33	from the firing patterns?
428.33	So, when we did this for responses
431.33	from the standard method and from
434.33	our encoder and transducer.
436.33	So let me show you, and I'm going to
438.33	start with the standard method first.
440.33	So you can see that it's pretty limited,
442.33	and because the firing patterns aren't
444.33	in the right code, they're very limited in
446.33	what they can tell you about
448.33	what's out there. So you can see that
450.33	there's something there, but it's not so clear
452.33	what that something is, and this just sort of
454.33	circles back to what I was saying in the
456.33	beginning, that with the standard method,
458.33	patients can see high-contrast edges, they
460.33	can see light, but it doesn't easily go
462.33	further than that. So what was
464.33	the image? It was a baby's face.
467.33	So what about with our approach,
469.33	adding the code? And you can see
471.33	that it's much better. Not only can you
473.33	tell that it's a baby's face, but you can
475.33	tell that it's this baby's face, which is a
477.33	really challenging task.
479.33	So on the left is the encoder
481.33	alone, and on the right is from an actual
483.33	blind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.
485.33	But the key one really is the encoder alone,
487.33	because we can team up the encoder with
489.33	the different transducer.
491.33	This is just actually the first one that we tried.
493.33	I just wanted to say something about the standard method.
495.33	When this first came out, it was just a really
497.33	exciting thing, the idea that you
499.33	even make a blind retina respond at all.
502.33	But there was this limiting factor,
505.33	the issue of the code, and how to make
507.33	the cells respond better,
509.33	produce normal responses,
511.33	and so this was our contribution.
513.33	Now I just want to wrap up,
515.33	and as I was mentioning earlier
517.33	of course I have a lot of other data
519.33	if you're interested, but I just wanted to give
521.33	this sort of basic idea
523.33	of being able to communicate
526.33	with the brain in its language, and
528.33	the potential power of being able to do that.
531.33	So it's different from the motor prosthetics
533.33	where you're communicating from the brain
535.33	to a device. Here we have to communicate
537.33	from the outside world
539.33	into the brain and be understood,
541.33	and be understood by the brain.
543.33	And then the last thing I wanted
545.33	to say, really, is to emphasize
547.33	that the idea generalizes.
549.33	So the same strategy that we used
551.33	to find the code for the retina we can also
553.33	use to find the code for other areas,
555.33	for example, the auditory system and
557.33	the motor system, so for treating deafness
559.33	and for motor disorders.
561.33	So just the same way that we were able to
563.33	jump over the damaged
565.33	circuitry in the retina to get to the retina's
567.33	output cells, we can jump over the
569.33	damaged circuitry in the cochlea
571.33	to get the auditory nerve,
573.33	or jump over damaged areas in the cortex,
575.33	in the motor cortex, to bridge the gap
578.33	produced by a stroke.
580.33	I just want to end with a simple
582.33	message that understanding the code
584.33	is really, really important, and if we
586.33	can understand the code,
588.33	the language of the brain, things become
590.33	possible that didn't seem obviously
592.33	possible before. Thank you.
594.33	(Applause)
