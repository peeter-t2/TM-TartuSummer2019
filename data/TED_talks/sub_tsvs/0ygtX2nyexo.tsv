13.42	I would like to tell you
13.42	about the most embarrassing thing
17.26	that has ever happened to me in my years
17.26	of working as a palliative care physician.
22.66	This happened a couple of years ago.
24.42	I was asked as a consultant
24.42	to see a woman in her 70s --
28.38	retired English professor
28.38	who had pancreatic cancer.
32.3	I was asked to see her because
32.3	she had pain, nausea, vomiting ...
37.74	When I went to see her,
37.74	we talked about those symptoms
40.42	and in the course of that consultation,
42.34	she asked me whether I thought
42.34	that medical marijuana might help her.
48.38	I thought back to everything
50.5	that I had learned in medical school
50.5	about medical marijuana,
53.86	which didn't take very long
53.86	because I had learned absolutely nothing.
58.58	And so I told her that as far as I knew,
61.46	medical marijuana
61.46	had no benefits whatsoever.
64.94	And she smiled and nodded and reached
64.94	into the handbag next to the bed,
69.62	and pulled out a stack of about a dozen
69.62	randomized controlled trials
73.66	showing that medical
73.66	marijuana has benefits
76.339	for symptoms like nausea
76.339	and pain and anxiety.
80.62	She handed me those articles and said,
83.54	"""Maybe you should read these"
83.54	before offering an opinion ...
88.7	"doctor."""
89.94	(Laughter)
91.18	So I did.
93.06	That night I read all of those articles
93.06	and found a bunch more.
96.58	When I came to see her the next morning,
98.74	I had to admit that it looks like
98.74	there is some evidence
102.5	that marijuana can offer medical benefits
105.86	and I suggested that if she
105.86	really was interested,
109.54	she should try it.
111.62	You know what she said?
113.98	This 73-year-old,
113.98	retired English professor?
118.02	"She said, ""I did try it"
118.02	about six months ago.
120.46	It was amazing.
122.02	I've been using it every day since.
124.74	It's the best drug I've discovered.
127.02	I don't know why it took me 73 years
127.02	"to discover this stuff. It's amazing."""
131.18	(Laughter)
132.22	That was the moment at which I realized
134.38	I needed to learn something
134.38	about medical marijuana
137.66	because what I was prepared for
137.66	in medical school
140.54	bore no relationship to reality.
143.78	So I started reading more articles,
143.78	I started talking to researchers,
147.3	I started talking to doctors,
148.74	and most importantly,
148.74	I started listening to patients.
152.18	I ended up writing a book
152.18	based on those conversations,
154.98	and that book really revolved
154.98	around three surprises --
158.1	surprises to me, anyway.
160.1	One I already alluded to --
161.66	that there really are some benefits
161.66	to medical marijuana.
164.82	Those benefits may not be
164.82	as huge or as stunning
168.58	as some of the most avid proponents
168.58	of medical marijuana
171.54	would have us believe,
172.78	but they are real.
174.74	Surprise number two:
176.18	medical marijuana does have some risks.
178.9	Those risks may not be
178.9	as huge and as scary
181.94	as some of the opponents of medical
181.94	marijuana would have us believe,
185.3	but they are real risks, nonetheless.
188.26	But it was the third surprise
188.26	that was most ...
190.74	surprising.
192.22	And that is that a lot
192.22	of the patients I talked with
195.26	who've turned to medical
195.26	marijuana for help,
197.98	weren't turning to medical marijuana
197.98	because of its benefits
200.94	or the balance of risks and benefits,
202.98	or because they thought
202.98	it was a wonder drug,
205.38	but because it gave them
205.38	control over their illness.
209.14	It let them manage their health
211.34	in a way that was productive and efficient
214.54	and effective and comfortable for them.
218.02	To show you what I mean,
218.02	let me tell you about another patient.
221.02	Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.
223.22	She looked though
223.22	like she was in her late 60s.
226.62	She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis
226.62	for the last 20 years,
229.9	her hands were gnarled by arthritis,
232.34	her spine was crooked,
234.1	she had to rely
234.1	on a wheelchair to get around.
236.74	She looked weak and frail,
238.38	and I guess physically she probably was,
240.66	but emotionally,
240.66	cognitively, psychologically,
243.66	she was among the toughest
243.66	people I've ever met.
248.06	And when I sat down next to her
249.58	in a medical marijuana dispensary
249.58	in Northern California
252.26	to ask her about why she turned
252.26	to medical marijuana,
255.7	what it did for her and how it helped her,
258.7	she started out by telling me things
260.46	that I had heard
260.46	from many patients before.
262.5	It helped with her anxiety;
264.5	it helped with her pain;
265.9	when her pain was better,
265.9	she slept better.
267.98	And I'd heard all that before.
269.46	But then she said something
269.46	that I'd never heard before,
272.14	and that is that it gave her
272.14	control over her life
275.94	and over her health.
277.66	She could use it when she wanted,
279.78	in the way that she wanted,
281.22	at the dose and frequency
281.22	that worked for her.
283.66	And if it didn't work for her,
283.66	then she could make changes.
287.06	Everything was up to her.
288.5	The most important thing she said
290.22	was she didn't need
290.22	anybody else's permission --
292.9	not a clinic appointment,
292.9	not a doctor's prescription,
295.54	not a pharmacist's order.
297.1	It was all up to her.
299.02	She was in control.
301.62	And if that seems like a little thing
301.62	for somebody with chronic illness,
305.06	it's not -- not at all.
307.1	When we face a chronic serious illness,
309.3	whether it's rheumatoid arthritis
309.3	or lupus or cancer or diabetes,
314.62	or cirrhosis,
316.14	we lose control.
317.98	"And note what I said: ""when,"" not ""if."""
320.54	All of us at some point in our lives
320.54	will face a chronic serious illness
324.82	that causes us to lose control.
327.34	We'll see our function decline,
327.34	some of us will see our cognition decline,
331.22	we'll be no longer able
331.22	to care for ourselves,
333.9	to do the things that we want to do.
336.18	Our bodies will betray us,
338.3	and in that process, we'll lose control.
340.9	And that's scary.
342.82	Not just scary -- that's frightening,
344.98	it's terrifying.
346.58	When I talk to my patients,
346.58	my palliative care patients,
349.26	many of whom are facing illnesses
349.26	that will end their lives,
353.18	they have a lot of be frightened of --
355.26	pain, nausea, vomiting,
355.26	constipation, fatigue,
358.9	their impending mortality.
360.22	But what scares them
360.22	more than anything else
362.82	is this possibility that at some point,
365.02	tomorrow or a month from now,
367.22	they're going to lose
367.22	control of their health,
370.38	of their lives,
372.02	of their healthcare,
373.42	and they're going to become
373.42	dependent on others,
375.94	and that's terrifying.
378.54	So it's no wonder really
378.54	that patients like Robin,
382.1	who I just told you about,
384.14	who I met in that clinic,
385.58	turn to medical marijuana
387.14	to try to claw back
387.14	some semblance of control.
390.62	How do they do it though?
391.9	How do these medical
391.9	marijuana dispensaries --
394.58	like the one where I met Robin --
396.58	how do they give patients like Robin
396.58	back the sort of control that they need?
403.3	And how do they do it
404.62	in a way that mainstream
404.62	medical hospitals and clinics,
408.7	at least for Robin, weren't able to?
411.06	What's their secret?
412.9	So I decided to find out.
415.58	I went to a seedy clinic
415.58	in Venice Beach in California
419.74	and got a recommendation
421.06	that would allow me
421.06	to be a medical marijuana patient.
424.62	I got a letter of recommendation
424.62	that would let me buy medical marijuana.
428.66	I got that recommendation illegally,
430.5	because I'm not
430.5	a resident of California --
432.58	I should note that.
433.82	I should also note, for the record,
435.58	that I never used that letter
435.58	of recommendation to make a purchase,
439.14	and to all of you DEA agents out there --
441.86	(Laughter)
443.1	love the work that you're doing,
444.7	keep it up.
445.94	(Laughter)
446.98	Even though it didn't let me
446.98	make a purchase though,
450.26	that letter was priceless
450.26	because it let me be a patient.
454.14	It let me experience
454.14	what patients like Robin experience
458.38	when they go to a medical
458.38	marijuana dispensary.
461.42	And what I experienced --
462.86	what they experience every day,
465.1	hundreds of thousands
465.1	of people like Robin --
468.58	was really amazing.
470.82	I walked into the clinic,
472.1	and from the moment that I entered
472.1	many of these clinics and dispensaries,
475.78	I felt like that dispensary, that clinic,
478.38	was there for me.
480.7	There were questions
480.7	at the outset about who I am,
483.62	what kind of work I do,
485.5	what my goals are in looking
485.5	for a medical marijuana prescription,
489.58	or product,
492.42	what my goals are,
492.42	what my preferences are,
494.82	what my hopes are,
496.1	how do I think, how do I hope
496.1	this might help me,
498.78	what am I afraid of.
500.42	These are the sorts of questions
502.02	that patients like Robin
502.02	get asked all the time.
504.5	These are the sorts of questions
504.5	that make me confident
507.46	that the person I'm talking with
507.46	really has my best interests at heart
511.14	and wants to get to know me.
514.02	The second thing I learned
514.02	in those clinics
516.74	is the availability of education.
518.94	Education from the folks
518.94	behind the counter,
521.78	but also education
521.78	from folks in the waiting room.
525.02	People I met were more than happy,
525.02	as I was sitting next to them --
528.58	people like Robin --
529.859	to tell me about who they are,
529.859	why they use medical marijuana,
533.66	what helps them, how it helps them,
535.9	and to give me advice and suggestions.
537.86	Those waiting rooms really are
537.86	a hive of interaction, advice and support.
544.46	And third, the folks behind the counter.
546.74	I was amazed at how willing
546.74	those people were
550.14	to spend sometimes an hour or more
550.14	talking me through the nuances
554.7	of this strain versus that strain,
556.78	smoking versus vaporizing,
558.5	edibles versus tinctures --
560.26	all, remember, without me
560.26	making any purchase whatsoever.
565.06	Think about the last time
565.06	you went to any hospital or clinic
568.9	and the last time anybody spent an hour
568.9	explaining those sorts of things to you.
574.5	The fact that patients like Robin
574.5	are going to these clinics,
578.14	are going to these dispensaries
579.74	and getting that sort
579.74	of personalized attention
582.7	and education and service,
584.58	really should be a wake-up call
584.58	to the healthcare system.
588.02	People like Robin are turning away
588.02	from mainstream medicine,
591.02	turning to medical marijuana dispensaries
593.38	because those dispensaries
593.38	are giving them what they need.
598.26	If that's a wake-up call
598.26	to the medical establishment,
600.86	it's a wake-up call that many
600.86	of my colleagues are either not hearing
604.66	or not wanting to hear.
607.06	When I talk to my colleagues,
607.06	physicians in particular,
609.82	about medical marijuana,
611.18	"they say, ""Oh, we need more evidence."
613.86	We need more research into benefits,
613.86	"we need more evidence about risks."""
618.42	And you know what? They're right.
620.3	They're absolutely right.
621.58	We do need much more evidence
621.58	about the benefits of medical marijuana.
625.78	We also need to ask the federal government
625.78	to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,
631.18	or to deschedule it entirely
631.18	to make that research possible.
635.58	We also need more research
635.58	into medical marijuana's risks.
639.26	Medical marijuana's risks --
640.66	we know a lot about
640.66	the risks of recreational use,
643.06	we know next to nothing
643.06	about the risks of medical marijuana.
645.98	So we absolutely do need research,
648.58	but to say that we need research
650.94	and not that we need
650.94	to make any changes now
654.02	is to miss the point entirely.
655.98	People like Robin
655.98	aren't seeking out medical marijuana
658.58	because they think it's a wonder drug,
660.46	or because they think
660.46	it's entirely risk-free.
663.22	They seek it out because the context
663.22	in which it's delivered and administered
667.9	and used,
669.14	gives them the sort of control
669.14	they need over their lives.
672.7	And that's a wake-up call
672.7	we really need to pay attention to.
676.86	The good news though is that
676.86	there are lessons we can learn today
680.62	from those medical marijuana dispensaries.
683.62	And those are lessons
683.62	we really should learn.
685.78	These are often small,
685.78	mom-and-pop operations
688.54	run by people with no medical training.
691.02	And while it's embarrassing to think
693.62	that many of these clinics
693.62	and dispensaries are providing services
697.7	and support and meeting patients' needs
700.1	in ways that billion-dollar
700.1	healthcare systems aren't --
704.14	we should be embarrassed by that --
705.86	but we can also learn from that.
707.78	And there are probably
707.78	three lessons at least
709.94	that we can learn
709.94	from those small dispensaries.
712.66	One: we need to find ways
712.66	to give patients more control
716.34	in small but important ways.
718.38	How to interact with healthcare providers,
720.46	when to interact
720.46	with healthcare providers,
722.66	how to use medications
722.66	in ways that work for them.
726.3	In my own practice,
727.54	I've gotten much more
727.54	creative and flexible
730.3	in supporting my patients
730.3	in using drugs safely
733.46	to manage their symptoms --
734.98	with the emphasis on safely.
736.38	Many of the drugs I prescribe
736.38	are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines
740.86	which can be dangerous if overused.
743.66	But here's the point.
744.9	They can be dangerous if they're overused,
746.98	but they can also be ineffective
746.98	if they're not used in a way
749.9	that's consistent with
749.9	what patients want and need.
752.58	So that flexibility,
752.58	if it's delivered safely,
755.82	can be extraordinarily valuable
755.82	for patients and their families.
758.94	That's number one.
760.18	Number two: education.
762.22	Huge opportunities
763.46	to learn from some of the tricks
763.46	of those medical marijuana dispensaries
766.94	to provide more education
768.34	that doesn't require
768.34	a lot of physician time necessarily,
771.1	or any physician time,
772.86	but opportunities to learn
772.86	about what medications we're using
777.26	and why,
778.5	prognoses, trajectories of illness,
780.58	and most importantly,
781.82	opportunities for patients
781.82	to learn from each other.
784.58	How can we replicate what goes on
786.54	in those clinic and medical
786.54	dispensary waiting rooms?
789.98	How patients learn from each other,
789.98	how people share with each other.
794.3	And last but not least,
795.7	putting patients first the way
795.7	those medical marijuana dispensaries do,
799.78	making patients feel
799.78	legitimately like what they want,
804.62	what they need,
805.9	is why, as healthcare providers,
807.62	we're here.
809.46	Asking patients about their hopes,
809.46	their fears, their goals and preferences.
813.7	As a palliative care provider,
815.18	I ask all my patients what they're
815.18	hoping for and what they're afraid of.
819.38	But here's the thing.
820.66	Patients shouldn't have to wait
820.66	until they're chronically seriously ill,
824.18	often near the end of life,
826.02	they shouldn't have to wait
826.02	until they're seeing a physician like me
830.34	before somebody asks them,
832.1	"""What are you hoping for?"""
833.38	"""What are you afraid of?"""
834.66	That should be baked into the way
834.66	that healthcare is delivered.
839.54	We can do this --
841.02	we really can.
842.26	Medical marijuana dispensaries
842.26	and clinics all across the country
845.66	are figuring this out.
847.46	They're figuring this out
848.74	in ways that larger, more mainstream
848.74	health systems are years behind.
854.26	But we can learn from them,
855.66	and we have to learn from them.
857.22	All we have to do is swallow our pride --
859.58	put aside the thought for a minute
861.26	that because we have
861.26	lots of letters after our name,
863.78	because we're experts,
865.06	because we're chief medical officers
865.06	of a large healthcare system,
868.22	we know all there is to know
868.22	about how to meet patients' needs.
872.42	We need to swallow our pride.
873.86	We need to go visit
873.86	a few medical marijuana dispensaries.
876.94	We need to figure out what they're doing.
878.94	We need to figure out
878.94	why so many patients like Robin
881.54	are leaving our mainstream medical clinics
883.74	and going to these medical
883.74	marijuana dispensaries instead.
887.14	We need to figure out
887.14	what their tricks are,
889.26	what their tools are,
890.54	and we need to learn from them.
892.7	If we do,
893.98	and I think we can,
893.98	and I absolutely think we have to,
896.94	we can guarantee all of our patients
896.94	will have a much better experience.
900.86	Thank you.
902.1	(Applause)
