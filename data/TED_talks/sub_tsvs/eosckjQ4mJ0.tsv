15.984	This is poo,
18.232	and what I want to do today is share my passion
20.715	for poo with you,
23.858	which might be quite difficult,
26.671	but I think what you might find more fascinating
29.764	is the way these small animals deal with poo.
32.965	So this animal here has got a brain
35.317	about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things
39.277	that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
43.027	And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,
47.149	which is dung.
49.283	So the question is, where do we start this story?
51.862	And it seems appropriate to start at the end,
54.887	because this is a waste product that comes out
57.672	of other animals, but it still contains nutrients
61.245	and there are sufficient nutrients in there
63.202	for dung beetles basically to make a living,
66.165	and so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae
69.1	are also dung-feeders.
71.255	They are grown completely in a ball of dung.
74.485	Within South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,
78.28	in Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,
81.55	and in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.
86.148	So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
91.286	Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails
93.958	and root through the dung itself, you'll never see
99.018	because they go directly into the dung,
101.424	straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth
104.036	between the dung at the soil surface
106.091	and a nest they make underground.
109.031	So the question is, how do they deal with this material?
114.276	And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
118.256	Ten percent of the species actually make a ball,
121.936	and this ball they roll away from the dung source,
126.098	usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,
129.534	and they have a very particular behavior
132.839	by which they are able to roll their balls.
137.814	So this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.
141.407	You can see it's a male
142.642	because he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,
144.883	and he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.
149.952	And then he's about to become a victim
151.864	of a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)
157.113	And this is a clear indication
159.811	that this is a valuable resource.
162.422	And so valuable resources have to be looked after
166.547	and guarded in a particular way, and we think
169.866	the reason they roll the balls away is because of this,
173.168	because of the competition that is involved
175.578	in getting hold of that dung.
177.453	So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat
183.096	and we think it's the intense competition
186.145	that makes the beetles so well-adapted
190.025	to rolling balls of dung.
192.714	So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here
194.747	moving across the African veld.
198.35	Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
201.698	It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,
207.069	and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.
209.935	This is Africa. It's hot.
211.923	So what I want to share with you now
213.63	are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues
216.805	have used to investigate how dung beetles
221.646	deal with these problems.
223.698	So watch this beetle,
226.235	and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
230.379	The first is how it deals with this obstacle
232.941	that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,
235.829	and then it carries on in exactly the same direction
238.763	that it took in the first place.
242.453	A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
246.219	So clearly this animal knows where it's going
249.596	and it knows where it wants to go,
250.935	and that's a very, very important thing,
252.82	because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,
255.235	you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,
259.758	and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
262.651	So we gave them some more tasks to deal with,
267.03	and what we did here is we turned the world
271.19	under their feet. And watch its response.
280.547	So this animal has actually had the whole world
283.343	turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
286.19	But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,
288.662	and it heads off in that particular direction.
291.63	So our next question then was,
293.822	how are they doing this?
295.782	What are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.
299.231	It was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball
302.358	and they'd take a look at the world around them.
304.99	And what do you think they could be looking at
306.71	as they climb on top of the ball?
308.386	What are the obvious cues that this animal could use
311.941	to direct its movement? And the most obvious one
316.119	is to look at the sky, and so we thought,
320.338	now what could they be looking at in the sky?
322.602	And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.
326.711	So a classic experiment here,
329.665	in that what we did was we moved the sun.
333.204	What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board
335.945	and then move the sun with a mirror
337.915	to a completely different position.
339.781	And look at what the beetle does.
341.693	It does a little double dance,
344.524	and then it heads back in exactly the same direction
346.803	it went in the first place.
349.212	What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.
352.939	The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
356.201	The thing is the sun is not always available to you,
358.826	because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.
363.242	What is happening in the sky here
365.826	is that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky
369.485	that you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.
373.236	But the sun is at the horizon over here
376.939	and we know that when the sun is at the horizon,
379.906	say it's over on this side,
381.45	there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky
386.035	of polarized light that we can't see
388.508	that the beetles can see.
391.306	So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
394.165	What we do is we get a great big polarization filter,
397.107	pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles
401.531	to the polarization pattern of the sky.
404.181	The beetle comes out from underneath the filter
408.351	and it does a right-hand turn,
410.854	because it comes back under the sky
413.048	that it was originally orientated to
415.867	and then reorientates itself back
418.212	to the direction it was originally going in.
422.134	So obviously beetles can see polarized light.
427.951	Okay, so what we've got so far is,
430.708	what are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.
433.484	How are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.
436.499	How are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?
440.077	Well, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,
442.772	some of which you and I can't see.
445.016	But how do they pick up those celestial cues?
446.7	That was what was of interest to us next.
449.744	And it was this particular little behavior, the dance,
452.932	that we thought was important, because look,
455.851	it takes a pause every now and then,
457.407	and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.
461.886	So what are they doing when they do this dance?
466.123	How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
470.465	And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them
473.961	into a channel, and you can see he wasn't
476.623	particularly forced into this particular channel,
479.361	and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees
484.659	until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction
488.395	that it wanted to go in, in the first place.
490.96	And let's see what his reaction is
493.761	as he's headed through 90 degrees here,
496.371	and now he's going to -- when he ends up down here,
498.475	he's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
501.522	And see what his response is.
503.82	He does a little dance, he turns around,
507.013	and heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.
510.747	He knows exactly what the problem is,
513.026	and he knows exactly how to deal with it,
514.621	and the dance is this transition behavior
517.322	that allows them to reorientate themselves.
520.131	So that's the dance, but after spending many years
524.923	sitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,
528.579	we noticed that there was another behavior
530.93	associated with the dance behavior.
533.419	Every now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,
537.357	they wipe their face.
540.763	And you see him do it again.
543.726	Now we thought, now what could be going on here?
546.707	Clearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,
549.611	they dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,
552.346	they wipe the bottom of their face.
554.316	And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.
557.015	We thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to
559.025	get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face
562.466	to cool their head down.
564.882	So what we did was design a couple of arenas.
569.324	one was hot, one was cold.
571.423	We shaded this one. We left that one hot.
573.8	And then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.
577.267	So what you're looking at here is a heat image
581.683	of the system, and what you can see here emerging
585.604	from the poo is a cool dung ball.
589.213	So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,
592.492	dung is cool. (Laughter)
597.472	So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature
600.69	of the beetle against the background.
603.33	So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.
607.274	The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about
611.953	so this is a great big ball of ice cream
614.619	that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
617.746	It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because
620.449	its body temperature is actually relatively low.
623.29	It's about the same as yours and mine.
626.363	And what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.
631.327	But if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,
635.634	look at the temperature of the soil.
637.784	It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
641.234	Watch how often the beetle dances.
644.676	And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
649.218	So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,
652.141	and the beetle climbs on top of the ball
654.075	and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,
658.714	we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.
664.384	And what we did then was put little boots on these legs,
668.316	because this was a way to test if the legs
671.278	were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.
675.036	And if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball
679.013	far less often when they had no boots on.
683.204	So we described these as cool boots.
685.531	It was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.
688.453	And we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able
691.34	to put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,
694.989	and they climbed onto that ball far less often
697.54	than when they had a hot ball.
699.076	So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior
702.05	that you and I do if we cross the beach,
703.958	we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel --
706.676	"""Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel."" --"
707.899	and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,
710.463	and that way you don't burn your feet.
712.668	And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
715.469	However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,
718.684	and that's this particular species.
720.256	It's from a genus called Pachysoma.
723.049	There are 13 species in the genus, and they have
726.081	a particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.
732.219	This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.
736.879	Can you spot the difference?
739.569	They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.
742.801	but it's walking forwards,
744.595	and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.
748.156	This is a different species in the same genus
750.61	but exactly the same foraging behavior.
754.482	There's one more interesting aspect of this
757.273	dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,
761.576	and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
766.082	So watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do
768.773	is set up a nest.
771.493	And he doesn't like this first position,
773.202	but he comes up with a second position,
774.825	and about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,
778.682	and he heads off to forage and provision
782.409	at a pile of dry dung pellets.
784.763	And what I want you to notice is the outward path
787.929	compared to the homeward path, and compare the two.
792.538	And by and large, you'll see that the homeward path
795.198	is far more direct than the outward path.
798.029	On the outward path, he's always on the lookout
800.844	for a new blob of dung.
803.309	On the way home, he knows where home is,
804.86	and he wants to go straight to it.
808.078	The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,
811.653	as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated
815.043	back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.
819.348	And watch, you're going to see
820.29	another South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)
824.3	And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
828.914	So what we're looking at here
832.051	is a behavior called path integration.
835.379	And what's taking place is that the beetle
837.996	has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path
842.299	looking for food, and then when it finds food,
845.39	it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
849.698	Now there's two ways it could be doing that,
852.723	and we can test that by displacing the beetle
855.683	to a new position when it's at the foraging site.
858.38	If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
861.674	If it is using something called path integration,
865.089	it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,
868.873	and what it's doing here if it's using path integration
871.297	is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
875.168	It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.
878.865	If you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.
881.993	So let's see what happens when we put this beetle
884.57	to the test with a similar experiment.
887.886	So here's our cunning experimenter.
892.272	He displaces the beetle,
894.673	and now we have to see what is going to take place.
899.522	What we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.
902.616	The forage has been displaced to a new position.
905.563	If he's using landmark orientation,
907.922	he should be able to find the burrow,
909.682	because he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.
912.405	If he's using path integration,
915.448	then it should end up in the wrong spot over here.
919.172	So let's watch what happens
921.482	when we put the beetle through the whole test.
924.773	So there he is there.
926.769	He's about to head home, and look what happens.
933.029	Shame.
935.522	It hasn't a clue.
937.756	It starts to search for its house in the right distance
940.676	away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
946.651	So we know now that this animal uses path integration
950.869	to find its way around, and the callous experimenter
954.948	leads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)
958.069	So what we're looking at here are a group of animals
962.124	that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass
964.203	to find their way around,
965.843	and they have some sort of system
968.368	for measuring that distance,
970.331	and we know that these species here actually
973.668	count the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,
976.349	a step-counting system, to find their way back home.
981.486	We don't know yet what dung beetles use.
984.309	So what have we learned from these animals
986.588	with a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?
989.589	Well, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line
993.7	using celestial cues.
995.845	We know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior
998.973	and it's also a thermoregulation behavior,
1001.387	and we also know that they use a path integration system
1005.585	for finding their way home.
1007.674	So for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance
1011.844	we can actually learn an awful lot from these things
1014.613	doing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.
1018.245	Thank you. (Applause)
