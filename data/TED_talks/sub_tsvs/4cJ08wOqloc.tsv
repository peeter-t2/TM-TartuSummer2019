12.594	How many of you have checked your email today?
15.133	Come on, raise your hands.
17.029	How many of you are checking it right now?
19.16	(Laughter)
20.718	And how about finances? Anybody check that today?
23.218	Credit card, investment account?
25.706	How about this week?
29.659	Now, how about your household energy use?
32.776	Anybody check that today?
34.714	This week? Last week?
38.866	A few energy geeks spread out across the room.
41.994	It's good to see you guys.
44.563	But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people
47.798	who are passionate about the future of this planet,
50.78	and even we aren't paying attention
52.611	to the energy use that's driving climate change.
55.571	The woman in the photo with me is Harriet.
58.226	We met her on our first family vacation.
60.763	Harriet's paying attention to her energy use,
63.125	and she is decidedly not an energy geek.
65.985	This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention.
71.224	This is coal,
73.253	the most common source of electricity on the planet,
76.61	and there's enough energy in this coal
79.834	to light this bulb for more than a year.
83.786	But unfortunately, between here and here,
85.857	most of that energy is lost to things
87.289	like transmission leakage and heat.
90.174	In fact, only 10 percent ends up as light.
93.753	So this coal will last a little bit more than a month.
97.761	If you wanted to light this bulb for a year,
100.37	you'd need this much coal.
105.408	The bad news here is that, for every unit of energy we use,
108.452	we waste nine.
110.525	That means there's good news,
112.156	because for every unit of energy we save,
114.739	we save the other nine.
118.004	So the question is, how can we get the people in this room
123.3	and across the globe to start paying attention
126.266	to the energy we're using,
128.352	and start wasting less of it?
131.328	The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment
133.715	that was run one hot summer, 10 years ago,
137.096	and only 90 miles from here,
139.232	in San Marcos, California.
142.608	Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood,
145.289	asking people to turn off their air conditioning
148.11	and turn on their fans.
150.32	One quarter of the homes received a message that said,
152.608	did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer?
154.926	Turn off your air conditioning, turn on your fans.
156.744	Another group got an environmental message.
158.578	And still a third group got a message about
160.667	being good citizens, preventing blackouts.
163.347	Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all.
167.064	In fact, none of these messages worked.
169.677	They had zero impact on energy consumption.
172.533	It was as if the grad students hadn't shown up at all.
176.654	But there was a fourth message,
178.474	and this message simply said,
180.597	"""When surveyed, 77 percent of your neighbors"
184.507	said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans.
186.997	Please join them. Turn off your air conditioning
188.802	"and turn on your fans."""
190.063	And wouldn't you know it, they did.
192.76	The people who received this message
194.714	showed a marked decrease in energy consumption
197.236	simply by being told what their neighbors were doing.
200.647	So what does this tell us?
202.347	Well, if something is inconvenient,
204.564	even if we believe in it,
206.553	moral suasion, financial incentives, don't do much to move us --
210.431	but social pressure, that's powerful stuff.
214.101	And harnessed correctly, it can be a powerful force for good.
217.719	In fact, it already is.
219.884	Inspired by this insight, my friend Dan Yates and I
222.516	started a company called Opower.
224.692	We built software and partnered with utility companies
227.161	who wanted to help their customers save energy.
229.964	We deliver personalized home energy reports
233.03	that show people how their consumption
234.748	compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes.
237.62	Just like those effective door hangers,
239.86	we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors,
242.324	and then we give everyone targeted recommendations
244.84	to help them save.
246.49	We started with paper, we moved to a mobile application,
248.796	web, and now even a controllable thermostat,
251.725	and for the last five years we've been running
253.742	the largest behavioral science experiment in the world.
258.145	And it's working.
259.809	Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved
261.906	more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills,
265.046	and we're just getting started.
266.559	This year alone, in partnership with more than 80 utilities
269.819	in six countries, we're going to generate
272.073	another two terawatt hours of electricity savings.
275.225	Now, the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours,
277.266	but for the rest of us, two terawatt hours
279.305	is more than enough energy to power every home
282.644	in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined
285.938	for more than a year.
287.506	Two terawatt hours, it's roughly half
289.472	what the U.S. solar industry produced last year.
292.058	And two terawatt hours? In terms of coal,
295.649	we'd need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows
298.806	every minute around the clock every day for an entire year
302.802	to get two terawatt hours of electricity.
304.906	And we're not burning anything.
306.223	We're just motivating people to pay attention
307.951	and change their behavior.
310.964	But we're just one company, and this is just
313.254	scratching the surface.
315.391	Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted,
318.956	and when I say wasted, I don't mean that people have
320.96	inefficient lightbulbs. They may.
324.313	I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms,
327.457	and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody's home.
330.487	That's 40 billion dollars a year wasted
333.571	on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being
336.82	but does contribute to climate change.
339.467	That's 40 billion -- with a B --
341.587	every year in the U.S. alone.
343.87	That's half our coal usage right there.
347.235	Now thankfully, some of the world's best material scientists
350.007	are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources
353.513	like these,
354.651	and this is both fantastic and essential.
358.149	But the most overlooked resource to get us
360.187	to a sustainable energy future, it isn't on this slide.
363.733	It's in this room. It's you, and it's me.
368.389	And we can harness this resource
371.073	with no new material science
372.91	simply by applying behavioral science.
376.102	We can do it today, we know it works,
378.186	and it will save us money right away.
381.914	So what are we waiting for?
384.665	Well, in most places, utility regulation
387.392	hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
391.708	Utilities are still rewarded when their customers
394.638	waste energy.
396.202	They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
400.005	But this story is much more than about household energy use.
403.411	Take a look at the Prius.
405.473	It's efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science
408.495	but because they invested in behavioral science.
410.97	The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy
413.11	they're saving in real time
415.074	makes former speed demons
416.589	drive more like cautious grandmothers.
419.342	Which brings us back to Harriet.
421.906	We met her on our first family vacation.
424.094	She came over to meet my young daughter,
426.281	and she was tickled to learn that my daughter's name
428.452	is also Harriet.
430.506	She asked me what I did for a living,
431.931	and I told her, I work with utilities
433.476	to help people save energy.
435.352	It was then that her eyes lit up.
437.578	She looked at me, and she said,
439.51	"""You're exactly the person I need to talk to."
441.738	You see, two weeks ago, my husband and I got a letter
443.921	in the mail from our utility.
446.241	"It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors."""
449.439	(Laughter)
452.869	"""And for the last two weeks, all we can think about,"
455.689	talk about, and even argue about,
457.977	is what we should be doing to save energy.
459.697	We did everything that letter told us to do,
462.562	and still I know there must be more.
465.364	Now I'm here with a genuine expert.
467.042	"Tell me. What should I do to save energy?"""
471.801	There are many experts who can help answer Harriet's question.
475.853	My goal is to make sure
477.915	we are all asking it.
480.213	Thank you.
481.571	(Applause)
