12.897	Sarge Salman: All the way from
12.897	Los Altos Hills, California,
15.293	Mr. Henry Evans.
17.354	(Applause)
32.477	Henry Evans: Hello.
34.105	My name is Henry Evans,
35.96	and until August 29, 2002,
39.551	I was living my version of the American dream.
44.575	I grew up in a typical American town near St. Louis.
49.073	My dad was a lawyer.
50.928	My mom was a homemaker.
53.917	My six siblings and I were good kids,
56.368	but caused our fair share of trouble.
59.86	After high school, I left home to study
62.25	and learn more about the world.
65.153	I went to Notre Dame University
67.81	and graduated with degrees
67.81	in accounting and German,
71.356	including spending a year of study in Austria.
74.3	Later on, I earned an MBA at Stanford.
79.181	I married my high school sweetheart, Jane.
83.193	I am lucky to have her.
85.555	Together, we raised four wonderful children.
90.2	I worked and studied hard
90.2	to move up the career ladder,
93.281	eventually becoming a chief financial officer
95.676	in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.
100.476	My family and I bought our first and only home
103.253	on December 13, 2001,
107.089	a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot
109.298	of Los Altos Hills, California,
111.738	from where I am speaking to you now.
114.974	We were looking forward to rebuilding it,
117.584	but eight months after we moved in,
119.819	I suffered a stroke-like attack
119.819	caused by a birth defect.
124.211	Overnight, I became a mute quadriplegic
129.15	at the ripe old age of 40.
132.493	It took me several years,
134.646	but with the help of an incredibly supportive family,
138.215	I finally decided life was still worth living.
143.074	I became fascinated with using technology
145.619	to help the severely disabled.
150.043	Head tracking devices sold commercially
152.565	by the company Madentec
155.316	convert my tiny head movements
155.316	into cursor movements,
159.174	and enable my use of a regular computer.
163.46	I can surf the web, exchange email with people,
166.719	and routinely destroy my friend Steve Cousins
169.647	in online word games.
171.764	This technology allows me to remain engaged,
174.65	mentally active,
176.003	and feel like I am a part of the world.
179.754	One day, I was lying in bed watching CNN,
183.059	when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp
185.645	of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech
188.396	demonstrating a PR2 robot.
191.24	I emailed Charlie and
191.24	Steve Cousins of Willow Garage,
195.287	and we formed the Robots for Humanity project.
200.139	For about two years, Robots for Humanity
203.04	developed ways for me to use the PR2
205.421	as my body surrogate.
208.801	I shaved myself for the first time in 10 years.
213.894	From my home in California,
215.668	I shaved Charlie in Atlanta. (Laughter)
219.647	I handed out Halloween candy.
224.064	I opened my refrigerator on my own.
230.091	I began doing tasks around the house.
234.163	I saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities
237.731	to live and contribute,
240.396	both for myself and others in my circumstance.
245.022	All of us have disabilities in one form or another.
249.63	For example, if either of us
249.63	wants to go 60 miles an hour,
255.056	both of us will need an assistive device called a car.
260.4	Your disability doesn't make you
260.4	any less of a person,
263.716	and neither does mine.
266.14	By the way, check out my sweet ride. (Laughter)
270.913	Since birth, we have both suffered from the inability
273.81	to fly on our own.
276.754	Last year, Kaijen Hsiao of Willow Garage
280.864	connected with me Chad Jenkins.
283.436	Chad showed me how easy it is
285.909	to purchase and fly aerial drones.
289.565	It was then I realized that I could also use
292.153	an aerial drone to expand the worlds
294.381	of bedridden people through flight,
297.519	giving a sense of movement and control
300.442	that is incredible.
303.519	Using a mouse cursor I control with my head,
306.396	these web interfaces allow me
308.285	to see video from the robot
309.895	and send control commands
311.528	by pressing buttons in a web browser.
315.255	With a little practice, I became
315.255	good enough with this interface
319.164	to drive around my home on my own.
325.884	I could look around our garden
328.592	and see the grapes we are growing.
332.702	I inspected the solar panels on our roof. (Laughter)
338.722	One of my challenges as a pilot is to land the drone
341.721	on our basketball hoop.
347.257	I went even further by seeing if I could use
349.688	a head-mounted display, the Oculus Rift,
352.711	as modified by Fighting Walrus,
354.759	to have an immersive experience
356.406	controlling the drone.
360.361	With Chad's group at Brown,
362.288	I regularly fly drones around his lab
364.768	several times a week,
364.768	from my home 3,000 miles away.
370.517	All work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic,
374.042	so we also find time to play friendly games
377.072	of robot soccer. (Laughter)
380.789	I never thought I would be able to casually
383.179	move around a campus like Brown on my own.
388.151	I just wish I could afford the tuition. (Laughter)
396.505	Chad Jenkins: Henry, all joking aside,
398.953	I bet all of these people here
401.142	would love to see you fly this drone
403.348	from your bed in California 3,000 miles away.
406.513	(Applause)
417.54	Okay, Henry, have you been to D.C. lately?
421.33	(Laughter)
424.838	Are you excited to be at TEDxMidAtlantic?
428.347	(Laughter) (Applause)
435.901	Can you show us how excited you are?
438.831	(Laughter)
443.113	All right, big finish.
444.764	Can you show us how good of a pilot you are?
449.818	(Applause)
454.468	All right, we still have a little ways to go with that,
456.954	but I think it shows the promise.
459.466	What makes Henry's story amazing
462.102	is it's about understanding Henry's needs,
465.23	understanding what people in Henry's situation
468.224	need from technology,
470.133	and then also understanding
471.79	what advanced technology can provide,
474.168	and then bringing those two things together
476.241	for use in a wise and responsible way.
479.483	What we're trying to do is democratize robotics,
481.593	so that anybody can be a part of this.
483.494	We're providing affordable,
483.494	off-the-shelf robot platforms
486.49	such as the A.R. drone, 300 dollars,
489.03	the Suitable Technologies beam,
489.03	only 17,000 dollars,
493.618	along with open-source robotics software
495.978	so that you can be a part of what we're trying to do.
498.155	And our hope is that, by providing these tools,
501.039	that you'll be able to think of better ways
502.687	to provide movement for the disabled,
504.588	to provide care for our aging population,
507.31	to help better educate our children,
509.294	to think about what the new types
511.608	of middle class jobs could be for the future,
514.2	to both monitor and protect our environment,
516.803	and to explore the universe.
518.882	Back to you, Henry.
522.813	HE: Thank you, Chad.
525.599	With this drone setup, we show the potential
528.421	for bedridden people to once again be able
530.887	to explore the outside world,
533.558	and robotics will eventually provide
535.935	a level playing field
537.278	where one is only limited by their mental acuity
539.981	and imagination,
542.226	where the disabled are able to perform
544.385	the same activities as everyone else,
547.08	and perhaps better,
549.982	and technology will even allow us to provide
552.622	an outlet for many people who are presently
554.783	considered vegetables.
557.211	One hundred years ago,
559.218	I would have been treated like a vegetable.
562.569	Actually, that's not true.
564.999	I would have died.
567.194	It is up to us, all of us, to decide how
570.016	robotics will be used, for good or for evil,
573.381	for simply replacing people
575.006	or for making people better,
576.643	for allowing us to do and enjoy more.
580.583	Our goal for robotics is to
580.583	unlock everyone's mental power
584.209	by making the world more physically accessible
586.878	to people such as myself and others like me
589.421	around the globe.
591.603	With the help of people like you,
593.486	we can make this dream a reality.
596.626	Thank you.
599.307	(Applause)
