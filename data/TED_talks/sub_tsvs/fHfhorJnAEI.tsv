13.114	So over the past few centuries,
13.114	microscopes have revolutionized our world.
21.036	They revealed to us a tiny world
21.036	of objects, life and structures
26.252	that are too small for us
26.252	to see with our naked eyes.
29.158	They are a tremendous contribution
29.158	to science and technology.
32.177	Today I'd like to introduce you
32.177	to a new type of microscope,
35.404	a microscope for changes.
37.982	It doesn't use optics
37.982	like a regular microscope
40.884	to make small objects bigger,
42.881	but instead it uses a video camera
42.881	and image processing
47.257	to reveal to us the tiniest motions
47.257	and color changes in objects and people,
52.513	changes that are impossible
52.513	for us to see with our naked eyes.
56.355	And it lets us look at our world
56.355	in a completely new way.
60.475	So what do I mean by color changes?
62.385	Our skin, for example,
62.385	changes its color very slightly
65.217	when the blood flows under it.
67.214	That change is incredibly subtle,
69.611	which is why, when you
69.611	look at other people,
71.674	when you look at the person
71.674	sitting next to you,
73.925	you don't see their skin
73.925	or their face changing color.
77.5	When we look at this video of Steve here,
77.5	it appears to us like a static picture,
81.86	but once we look at this video
81.86	through our new, special microscope,
85.72	suddenly we see
85.72	a completely different image.
88.32	What you see here are small changes
88.32	in the color of Steve's skin,
92.25	magnified 100 times
92.25	so that they become visible.
96.686	We can actually see a human pulse.
99.953	We can see how fast
99.953	Steve's heart is beating,
103.18	but we can also see the actual way
103.18	that the blood flows in his face.
108.544	And we can do that not just
108.544	to visualize the pulse,
111.175	but also to actually 
111.175	recover our heart rates,
114.646	and measure our heart rates.
116.439	And we can do it with regular cameras
116.439	and without touching the patients.
120.892	So here you see the pulse and heart rate
120.892	we extracted from a neonatal baby
126.509	from a video we took
126.509	with a regular DSLR camera,
129.39	and the heart rate measurement we get
131.206	is as accurate as the one you'd get
131.206	with a standard monitor in a hospital.
136.017	And it doesn't even have to be
136.017	a video we recorded.
138.659	We can do it essentially
138.659	with other videos as well.
141.654	So I just took a short clip
141.654	"from ""Batman Begins"" here"
145.555	just to show Christian Bale's pulse.
147.459	(Laughter)
149.281	And you know, presumably
149.281	he's wearing makeup,
151.404	the lighting here is kind of challenging,
153.357	but still, just from the video,
153.357	we're able to extract his pulse
156.308	and show it quite well.
158.326	So how do we do all that?
160.246	We basically analyze the changes
160.246	in the light that are recorded
164.844	at every pixel in the video over time,
167.115	and then we crank up those changes.
168.913	We make them bigger
168.913	so that we can see them.
171.075	The tricky part is that those signals,
172.977	those changes that we're after,
172.977	are extremely subtle,
175.91	so we have to be very careful
175.91	when you try to separate them
178.689	from noise that always exists in videos.
182.52	So we use some clever
182.52	image processing techniques
185.515	to get a very accurate measurement
185.515	of the color at each pixel in the video,
189.509	and then the way the color
189.509	changes over time,
192.179	and then we amplify those changes.
194.872	We make them bigger to create those types
194.872	of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,
198.852	that actually show us those changes.
201.024	But it turns out we can do that
201.024	not just to show tiny changes in color,
205.262	but also tiny motions,
207.503	and that's because the light
207.503	that gets recorded in our cameras
211.079	will change not only if the color
211.079	of the object changes,
213.889	but also if the object moves.
216.257	So this is my daughter
216.257	when she was about two months old.
219.893	It's a video I recorded
219.893	about three years ago.
222.892	And as new parents, we all want
222.892	to make sure our babies are healthy,
226.1	that they're breathing,
226.1	that they're alive, of course.
228.642	So I too got one of those baby monitors
230.784	so that I could see my daughter
230.784	when she was asleep.
233.253	And this is pretty much what you'll see
233.253	with a standard baby monitor.
236.78	You can see the baby's sleeping, but 
236.78	there's not too much information there.
240.474	There's not too much we can see.
242.078	Wouldn't it be better,
242.078	or more informative, or more useful,
244.902	if instead we could look
244.902	at the view like this.
247.892	So here I took the motions
247.892	and I magnified them 30 times,
254.248	and then I could clearly see that my
254.248	daughter was indeed alive and breathing.
258.074	(Laughter)
260.327	Here is a side-by-side comparison.
262.249	So again, in the source video,
262.249	in the original video,
264.732	there's not too much we can see,
266.368	but once we magnify the motions,
266.368	the breathing becomes much more visible.
270.075	And it turns out, there's
270.075	a lot of phenomena
272.145	we can reveal and magnify
272.145	with our new motion microscope.
275.768	We can see how our veins and arteries
275.768	are pulsing in our bodies.
280.332	We can see that our eyes
280.332	are constantly moving
282.96	in this wobbly motion.
284.847	And that's actually my eye,
286.356	and again this video was taken
286.356	right after my daughter was born,
289.421	so you can see I wasn't getting
289.421	too much sleep. (Laughter)
293.623	Even when a person is sitting still,
296.339	there's a lot of information
296.339	we can extract
298.383	about their breathing patterns,
298.383	small facial expressions.
301.912	Maybe we could use those motions
303.537	to tell us something about
303.537	our thoughts or our emotions.
306.691	We can also magnify small
306.691	mechanical movements,
309.946	like vibrations in engines,
311.501	that can help engineers detect
311.501	and diagnose machinery problems,
315.193	or see how our buildings and structures
315.193	sway in the wind and react to forces.
319.931	Those are all things that our society
319.931	knows how to measure in various ways,
324.512	but measuring those motions is one thing,
326.965	and actually seeing those
326.965	motions as they happen
329.241	is a whole different thing.
331.795	And ever since we discovered
331.795	this new technology,
334.836	we made our code available online so that 
334.836	others could use and experiment with it.
338.789	It's very simple to use.
340.664	It can work on your own videos.
342.708	Our collaborators at Quanta Research
342.708	even created this nice website
345.901	where you can upload your videos
345.901	and process them online,
348.579	so even if you don't have any experience
348.579	in computer science or programming,
352.395	you can still very easily experiment
352.395	with this new microscope.
355.331	And I'd like to show you
355.331	just a couple of examples
357.735	of what others have done with it.
360.47	So this video was made by
360.47	a YouTube user called Tamez85.
365.787	I don't know who that user is,
367.25	but he, or she, used our code
369.595	to magnify small belly
369.595	movements during pregnancy.
373.31	It's kind of creepy.
374.912	(Laughter)
376.525	People have used it to magnify
376.525	pulsing veins in their hands.
381.486	And you know it's not real science
381.486	unless you use guinea pigs,
385.268	and apparently this guinea pig
385.268	is called Tiffany,
388.658	and this YouTube user claims
388.658	it is the first rodent on Earth
391.607	that was motion-magnified.
394.295	You can also do some art with it.
396.483	So this video was sent to me
396.483	by a design student at Yale.
399.501	She wanted to see
399.501	if there's any difference
401.638	in the way her classmates move.
403.16	She made them all stand still,
403.16	and then magnified their motions.
407.369	It's like seeing 
407.369	still pictures come to life.
410.747	And the nice thing with 
410.747	all those examples
413.18	is that we had nothing to do with them.
415.476	We just provided this new tool,
415.476	a new way to look at the world,
419.33	and then people find other interesting,
419.33	new and creative ways of using it.
424.462	But we didn't stop there.
426.226	This tool not only allows us
426.226	to look at the world in a new way,
429.477	it also redefines what we can do
431.845	and pushes the limits of what
431.845	we can do with our cameras.
435.026	So as scientists, we started wondering,
437.255	what other types of physical phenomena
437.255	produce tiny motions
441.04	that we could now use
441.04	our cameras to measure?
443.943	And one such phenomenon
443.943	that we focused on recently is sound.
447.944	Sound, as we all know,
447.944	is basically changes
450.049	in air pressure that
450.049	travel through the air.
452.232	Those pressure waves hit objects
452.232	and they create small vibrations in them,
455.853	which is how we hear
455.853	and how we record sound.
458.385	But it turns out that sound
458.385	also produces visual motions.
462.053	Those are motions
462.053	that are not visible to us
464.886	but are visible to a camera
464.886	with the right processing.
467.887	So here are two examples.
469.46	This is me demonstrating
469.46	my great singing skills.
473.064	(Singing)
474.698	(Laughter)
476.134	And I took a high-speed video
476.134	of my throat while I was humming.
479.12	Again, if you stare at that video,
480.884	there's not too much
480.884	you'll be able to see,
482.96	but once we magnify the motions 100 times,
482.96	we can see all the motions and ripples
487.292	in the neck that are involved
487.292	in producing the sound.
490.566	That signal is there in that video.
493.306	We also know that singers
493.306	can break a wine glass
495.976	if they hit the correct note.
497.439	So here, we're going to play a note
499.204	that's in the resonance
499.204	frequency of that glass
501.73	through a loudspeaker that's next to it.
503.778	Once we play that note
503.778	and magnify the motions 250 times,
508.197	we can very clearly see 
508.197	how the glass vibrates
510.535	and resonates in response to the sound.
514.105	It's not something you're used
514.105	to seeing every day.
516.525	But this made us think.
516.525	It gave us this crazy idea.
520.054	Can we actually invert this process
520.054	and recover sound from video
525.662	by analyzing the tiny vibrations
525.662	that sound waves create in objects,
529.697	and essentially convert those
529.697	back into the sounds that produced them.
534.474	In this way, we can turn
534.474	everyday objects into microphones.
538.931	So that's exactly what we did.
541.163	So here's an empty bag of chips
541.163	that was lying on a table,
543.979	and we're going to turn that 
543.979	bag of chips into a microphone
546.804	by filming it with a video camera
548.395	and analyzing the tiny motions
548.395	that sound waves create in it.
551.623	So here's the sound
551.623	that we played in the room.
554.419	"(Music: ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"")"
562.007	And this is a high-speed video
562.007	we recorded of that bag of chips.
565.032	Again it's playing.
566.306	There's no chance you'll be able
566.306	to see anything going on in that video
569.648	just by looking at it,
570.706	but here's the sound we were able
570.706	to recover just by analyzing
573.69	the tiny motions in that video.
575.873	"(Music: ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"")"
592.985	I call it -- Thank you.
594.471	(Applause)
601.878	I call it the visual microphone.
604.223	We actually extract audio signals
604.223	from video signals.
607.613	And just to give you a sense
607.613	of the scale of the motions here,
610.799	a pretty loud sound will cause that bag
610.799	of chips to move less than a micrometer.
616.135	That's one thousandth of a millimeter.
618.874	That's how tiny the motions are
618.874	that we are now able to pull out
622.435	just by observing how light
622.435	bounces off objects
625.678	and gets recorded by our cameras.
627.814	We can recover sounds
627.814	from other objects, like plants.
631.064	"(Music: ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"")"
639.214	And we can recover speech as well.
641.211	So here's a person speaking in a room.
643.788	Voice: Mary had a little lamb
643.788	whose fleece was white as snow,
647.991	and everywhere that Mary went,
647.991	that lamb was sure to go.
652.221	Michael Rubinstein: And here's
652.221	that speech again recovered
654.98	just from this video
654.98	of that same bag of chips.
658.254	Voice: Mary had a little lamb
658.254	whose fleece was white as snow,
663.085	and everywhere that Mary went,
663.085	that lamb was sure to go.
667.944	"MR: We used ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"""
670.29	because those are said to be
670.29	the first words
672.413	that Thomas Edison spoke 
672.413	into his phonograph in 1877.
676.574	It was one of the first sound
676.574	recording devices in history.
679.802	It basically directed the sounds
679.802	onto a diaphragm
683.129	that vibrated a needle that essentially
683.129	engraved the sound on tinfoil
687.208	that was wrapped around the cylinder.
689.483	Here's a demonstration of recording and 
689.483	replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.
695.426	(Video) Voice: Testing,
695.426	testing, one two three.
698.446	Mary had a little lamb
698.446	whose fleece was white as snow,
701.859	and everywhere that Mary went,
701.859	the lamb was sure to go.
705.528	Testing, testing, one two three.
708.268	Mary had a little lamb
708.268	whose fleece was white as snow,
712.424	and everywhere that Mary went,
712.424	the lamb was sure to go.
717.648	MR: And now, 137 years later,
721.665	we're able to get sound
721.665	in pretty much similar quality
725.752	but by just watching objects
725.752	vibrate to sound with cameras,
729.831	and we can even do that when the camera
731.765	is 15 feet away from the object,
731.765	behind soundproof glass.
735.999	So this is the sound that we were 
735.999	able to recover in that case.
739.219	Voice: Mary had a little lamb
739.219	whose fleece was white as snow,
744.513	and everywhere that Mary went,
744.513	the lamb was sure to go.
749.404	MR: And of course, surveillance is
749.404	the first application that comes to mind.
753.034	(Laughter)
756.029	But it might actually be useful
756.029	for other things as well.
760.085	Maybe in the future, we'll be able
760.085	to use it, for example,
762.925	to recover sound across space,
765.177	because sound can't travel
765.177	in space, but light can.
768.753	We've only just begun exploring
771.157	other possible uses
771.157	for this new technology.
774.176	It lets us see physical processes
774.176	that we know are there
777.008	but that we've never been able
777.008	to see with our own eyes until now.
780.564	This is our team.
781.768	Everything I showed you today
781.768	is a result of a collaboration
784.647	with this great group
784.647	of people you see here,
786.838	and I encourage you and welcome you
786.838	to check out our website,
790.005	try it out yourself,
791.451	and join us in exploring
791.451	this world of tiny motions.
794.423	Thank you.
796.048	(Applause)
