16.69	Good evening.
17.734	We are in this wonderful
19.669	open-air amphitheater
21.549	and we are enjoying ourselves
23.303	in that mild evening
25.005	temperature tonight,
26.293	but when Qatar will host
30.61	the football World Cup
35.469	we already heard it will be
36.701	in the hot, very hot and sunny
40.349	summer months of June and July.
42.693	And when Qatar has been assigned
45.006	to the World Cup all, many
46.637	people around the world have been
48.538	wondering, how would it be
49.889	possible that football players
52.112	show spectacular football,
54.273	run around in this desert
55.478	climate? How would it be
57.009	possible that spectators sit,
59.904	enjoy themselves in open-air
62.896	stadia in this hot environment?
66.105	Together with the architects of
67.746	Albert Speer &amp; Partner, our engineers
69.688	from Transsolar have been
71.544	supporting, have been developing
73.328	open-air stadia based on 100 percent
76.991	solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.
81.425	Let me tell you about that,
82.832	but let me start with comfort.
84.496	Let me start with the aspect
85.807	of comfort, because many people
87.513	are confusing
90.535	ambient temperature
92.689	with thermal comfort.
94.417	We are used to looking at charts like
95.945	that, and you see this red line
97.936	showing the air temperature
99.288	in June and July, and yes, that's right,
100.77	it's picking up to 45 degrees C.
103.041	It's actually very hot.
105.881	But air temperature is not
108.4	the full set of climatic
110.001	parameters which define comfort.
112.414	Let me show you analysis
114.305	a colleague of mine did looking
117.833	on different football, World Cups,
120.409	Olympic Games around the world,
122.321	looking on the comfort
123.617	and analyzing the comfort
125.048	people have perceived at these
127.848	different sport activities,
129.552	and let me start with Mexico.
131.401	Mexico temperature has been, air
132.97	temperature has been something between
137.721	enjoyed themselves.
139.497	It was a very comfortable game
141.369	in Mexico City. Have a look.
143.664	Orlando, same kind of stadium,
146.097	open-air stadium. People have
148.658	been sitting in the strong sun,
151.402	in the very high humidity
153.249	in the afternoon, and they
154.364	did not enjoy. It was not comfortable.
156.17	The air temperature was not too high, but it was not
158.137	comfortable during these games.
160.985	What about Seoul? Seoul, because
162.68	of broadcast rights, all the
165.112	games have been in the late
166.417	afternoon. Sun has already been
167.944	set, so the games have been
170.337	perceived as comfortable.
172.897	What about Athens? Mediterranean
175.761	climate, but in the sun it was
178.05	not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.
180.776	And we know that from Spain,
182.417	"we know that ""sol y sombra."""
184.929	If you have a ticket, and you
187.097	get a ticket for the shade,
188.809	you pay more, because you're
191.017	in a more comfortable environment.
194.778	What about Beijing?
196.057	It's again, sun in the day
198.721	and high humidity,
200.449	and it was not comfortable.
201.712	So if I overlay, and if you
202.992	overlay all these comfort
204.681	envelopes, what we see is,
206.6	in all these places, air temperature has
208.856	been ranging something from 25
212.69	to 35, and if you go on
214.594	the line, 30, of 30 degrees C
217.353	ambient temperatures. If you
218.802	go along that line you see
220.455	there has been all kind of
222.976	comfort, all kinds of perceived
225.209	outdoor comfort, ranging from
227.018	very comfortable
228.203	to very uncomfortable.
230.074	So why is that?
232.923	This is because there are
234.619	more parameters influencing
236.706	our thermal comfort, which is
238.612	the sun, the direct sun,
241.005	the diffuse sun, which is wind,
243.493	strong wind, mild wind, which is
246.181	air humidity, which is
248.467	the radiant temperature of the
250.696	surroundings where we are in.
252.803	And this is air temperature.
254.484	All these parameters go into
255.463	the comfort feeling of our
257.517	human body, and scientists
259.15	have developed a parameter,
261.503	which is the perceived
263.006	temperature, where all these
265.131	parameters go in and help
267.387	designers to understand
270.294	which is the driving parameter
272.428	that I feel comfort or that
274.06	I don't feel comfort.
275.539	Which is the driving parameter
277.172	which gives me a perceived
278.524	temperature? And these parameters,
281.184	these climatic parameters are
282.852	related to the human metabolism.
287.012	Because of our metabolism,
289.251	we as human beings,
291.204	we produce heat.
292.844	I'm excited, I'm talking to you,
294.359	I'm probably producing
297.116	at the moment. You are sitting,
298.452	you are relaxed, you're looking
300.14	at me. It's probably 100
301.487	watts each person is producing,
303.421	and we need to get rid of that
305.42	energy. I need, with my body,
307.171	to get rid of the energy, and
308.673	the harder it is for myself,
310.644	for my body, to get rid of the
312.724	energy, the less comfort I feel.
314.963	That's it. And if I don't
317.279	get rid of the energy,
318.421	I will die.
319.86	If we overlay what happens
324.212	during the football World Cup,
326.46	what will happen in June, July,
328.229	we will see, yes, air
329.156	temperature will be much higher,
331.036	but because the games and
332.692	the plays will be in the afternoon,
335.212	it's probably the same comfort
337.045	rating we've found in other
338.692	places which has perceived
340.188	as non-comfortable.
341.899	So we sat together with a team
344.043	which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,
346.373	that we said, let's aim
349.148	for perceived temperature,
351.107	for outdoor comfort in this range,
353.75	which is perceived with a
355.421	temperature of 32 degrees
358.624	Celsius perceived temperature,
360.245	which is extremely comfortable.
362.405	People would feel really fine
364.998	in an open outdoor environment.
366.892	But what does it mean?
368.851	If we just look on what happens,
370.9	we see, temperature's too high.
373.011	If we apply the best architectural design,
375.804	climate engineering design,
377.268	we won't get much better.
379.371	So we need to do something active.
382.092	We need, for instance, to bring
383.962	in radiant cooling technology,
386.058	and we need to combine this
387.947	with so-called soft conditioning.
390.164	And how does it look like in a stadium?
391.6	So the stadium has a few
393.928	elements which create that
395.673	outdoor comfort. First of all,
396.915	it's shading. It needs
399.151	to protect where the people
401.465	are sitting against strong
403.129	and warm wind.
404.328	But that's not all what we need
405.967	to do. We need to use
408.978	active systems.
411.147	Instead of blowing a hurricane
413.587	of chilled air through the stadium,
415.962	we can use radiant
417.71	cooling technologies, like a
419.744	floor heating system where water
421.944	pipes are embedded in the floor.
424.327	And just by using cold water
426.145	going through the water pipes,
427.473	you can release the heat
429.129	which is absorbed during the day
431.209	in the stadium, so you can
432.446	create that comfort, and then by
434.329	adding dry air instead of
436.889	down-chilled air, the spectators
439.121	and the football players can
441.003	adjust to their individual
443.336	comfort needs, to their
445.113	individual energy balance.
446.769	They can adjust and find
448.746	their comfort they need to find.
451.121	There are 12 stadia probably
455.577	to come, but there are
459.856	all the individual countries
461.553	are going to train.
462.737	We applied the same concept:
464.634	shading of the training pitch,
466.864	using a shelter against wind,
469.704	then using the grass.
471.593	Natural-watered lawn is a
474.113	very good cooling source
475.592	stabilizing temperature,
476.809	and using dehumidified air to
478.745	create comfort.
479.824	But even the best passive design
483.698	wouldn't help.
484.444	We need active system.
485.454	And how do we do that?
486.504	Our idea for the bid was
490.609	based on the idea that we use
492.704	the roof of the stadia,
494.344	we cover the roofs of the stadia
496.287	with PV systems.
497.879	We don't borrow any energy
500.439	from history.
501.863	We are not using fossil energies.
503.656	We are not borrowing energy
505.472	from our neighbors.
506.528	We're using energy we can harvest
508.648	on our roofs, and also on the
511.408	training pitches, which will be
513.495	covered with large, flexible
516.167	membranes, and we will see
517.88	in the next years an industry
519.584	coming up with flexible
520.767	photovoltaics, giving
522.392	the possibilities of shading
524.169	against strong sun and producing
525.849	electric energy in the same time.
528.344	And this energy now is
530.055	harvested throughout the year,
531.687	sent into the grid,
533.255	is replacing fossils
535.24	in the grid, and when I need it
537.391	for the cooling, I take it
540.288	back from the grid and I
542.105	use the solar energy
544.472	which I have brought to the grid
546.544	back when I need
547.832	it for the solar cooling.
548.664	And I can do that in the first
550.087	year and I can balance that
551.135	in the next 10, and the next
554.304	which is necessary to condition
556.927	a World Cup in Qatar,
558.626	the next 20 years, this energy
560.585	goes into the grid of Qatar.
563.166	So this -- (Applause)
564.379	Thank you very much. (Applause)
565.483	This is not only useful
568.164	for stadia. We can use that also
570.139	in open-air places and streets,
572.548	and we've been working on
573.731	the City of the Future
575.1	in Masdar, which is in the
576.487	United Emirates, Abu Dhabi.
577.747	And I had the pleasure to work
579.459	on the central plaza.
580.763	And the same idea to use there,
582.898	to create outdoor conditions
584.604	which are perceived
585.755	as comfortable. People enjoy
587.011	going there instead of going
589.211	into a shopping mall, which is
590.98	chilled down and which is
592.164	cooled. We wanted to create
594.243	an outdoor space
595.78	which is so comfortable that
597.747	people can go there in the
599.324	early afternoon, even in these
601.448	sunny and hot summer months,
603.44	and they can enjoy and meet there
604.786	with their families. (Applause)
606.592	And the same concept:
607.939	shade against the sun,
609.376	shade against the wind,
610.647	and use, use and take advantage
614.471	of the sun you can harvest
617.184	on your footprint.
618.279	And these beautiful umbrellas.
620.288	So I'd like to encourage you
624.576	to pay attention to your
626.944	thermal comfort, to your
628.608	thermal environment,
629.655	tonight and tomorrow,
632.344	and if you'd like to learn more
634.151	about that, I invite you
635.273	to go to our website.
636.552	We uploaded a very simple
638.696	perceived temperature calculator
640.808	where you can check out
641.8	about your outdoor comfort.
643.215	And I also hope that you
646.687	share the idea that
648.009	if engineers and designers
650.015	can use all these different
651.527	climatic parameters,
653.488	it will be possible to create
656.495	really good and comfortable
659.584	outdoor conditions,
660.864	to change our thermal perception
663.993	that we feel comfortable
665.871	in an outdoor environment,
667.959	and we can do that
670.351	with the best passive design,
672.215	but also using the energy source
675.391	of the site in Qatar which is
678.375	the sun.
679.229	(Applause)
681.745	Thank you very much. (Applause)
683.27	Shukran. (Applause)
