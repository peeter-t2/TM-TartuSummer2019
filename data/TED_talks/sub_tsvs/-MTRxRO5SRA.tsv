12.954	I'm here today to talk about
12.954	the two ideas that,
15.904	at least based on
15.904	my observations at Khan Academy,
18.286	are kind of the core,
18.286	or the key leverage points for learning.
22.188	And it's the idea of mastery
24.228	and the idea of mindset.
26.037	I saw this in the early days
26.037	working with my cousins.
28.895	A lot of them were having trouble
28.895	with math at first,
31.399	because they had all of these gaps
31.399	accumulated in their learning.
34.477	And because of that, at some point
34.477	they got to an algebra class
37.49	and they might have been a little bit
37.49	shaky on some of the pre-algebra,
40.916	and because of that, they thought
40.916	they didn't have the math gene.
44.385	Or they'd get to a calculus class,
46.072	and they'd be a little bit
46.072	shaky on the algebra.
48.858	I saw it in the early days
50.452	when I was uploading
50.452	some of those videos on YouTube,
54.004	and I realized that people
54.004	who were not my cousins were watching.
57.305	(Laughter)
59.194	And at first, those comments
59.194	were just simple thank-yous.
63.084	I thought that was a pretty big deal.
65.077	I don't know how much time
65.077	you all spend on YouTube.
67.553	"Most of the comments are not ""Thank you."""
69.664	(Laughter)
71.145	They're a little edgier than that.
72.807	But then the comments
72.807	got a little more intense,
75.262	student after student saying
75.262	that they had grown up not liking math.
79.742	It was getting difficult as they got
79.742	into more advanced math topics.
82.965	By the time they got to algebra,
84.517	they had so many gaps in their knowledge
84.517	they couldn't engage with it.
87.869	They thought they didn't
87.869	have the math gene.
89.966	But when they were a bit older,
91.47	they took a little agency
91.47	and decided to engage.
93.737	They found resources like Khan Academy
95.613	and they were able to fill in those gaps
95.613	and master those concepts,
98.787	and that reinforced their mindset
98.787	that it wasn't fixed;
101.401	that they actually were capable
101.401	of learning mathematics.
104.99	And in a lot of ways, this is how
104.99	you would master a lot of things in life.
109.067	It's the way you would
109.067	learn a martial art.
111.39	In a martial art, you would
111.39	practice the white belt skills
114.58	as long as necessary,
116.017	and only when you've mastered it
117.592	you would move on to become a yellow belt.
119.751	It's the way you learn
119.751	a musical instrument:
121.846	you practice the basic piece
121.846	over and over again,
124.164	and only when you've mastered it,
125.776	you go on to the more advanced one.
127.471	But what we point out --
128.835	this is not the way a traditional
128.835	academic model is structured,
133.344	the type of academic model
133.344	that most of us grew up in.
136.703	In a traditional academic model,
138.269	we group students together,
138.269	usually by age,
140.712	and around middle school,
142.015	by age and perceived ability,
143.885	and we shepherd them all
143.885	together at the same pace.
147.038	And what typically happens,
148.359	let's say we're in a middle school
148.359	pre-algebra class,
150.884	and the current unit is on exponents,
152.702	the teacher will give
152.702	a lecture on exponents,
154.916	then we'll go home, do some homework.
157.225	The next morning,
157.225	we'll review the homework,
159.303	then another lecture, homework,
159.303	lecture, homework.
161.675	That will continue for about
161.675	two or three weeks,
163.96	and then we get a test.
165.159	On that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,
168.501	maybe you get a 90 percent,
169.942	maybe you get a 95 percent.
171.95	And even though the test identified
171.95	gaps in our knowledge,
174.721	I didn't know 25 percent of the material.
176.704	Even the A student, what was
176.704	the five percent they didn't know?
179.7	Even though we've identified the gaps,
181.537	the whole class will then
181.537	move on to the next subject,
184.099	probably a more advanced subject
184.099	that's going to build on those gaps.
187.525	It might be logarithms
187.525	or negative exponents.
190.922	And that process continues,
190.922	and you immediately start to realize
193.977	how strange this is.
195.176	I didn't know 25 percent
195.176	of the more foundational thing,
197.971	and now I'm being pushed
197.971	to the more advanced thing.
200.44	And this will continue for months, years,
200.44	all the way until at some point,
204.176	I might be in an algebra class
204.176	or trigonometry class
206.64	and I hit a wall.
207.921	And it's not because algebra
207.921	is fundamentally difficult
210.599	or because the student isn't bright.
214.615	It's because I'm seeing an equation
214.615	and they're dealing with exponents
217.95	and that 30 percent
217.95	that I didn't know is showing up.
220.703	And then I start to disengage.
224.469	To appreciate how absurd that is,
227.919	imagine if we did other things
227.919	in our life that way.
231.124	Say, home-building.
232.602	(Laughter)
236.878	So we bring in the contractor and say,
240.296	"""We were told we have"
240.296	two weeks to build a foundation.
242.868	"Do what you can."""
244.228	(Laughter)
246.985	So they do what they can.
248.801	Maybe it rains.
249.981	Maybe some of the supplies don't show up.
251.974	And two weeks later,
251.974	the inspector comes, looks around,
255.308	"says, ""OK, the concrete"
255.308	is still wet right over there,
257.997	that part's not quite up to code ...
260.838	"I'll give it an 80 percent."""
262.22	(Laughter)
263.308	"You say, ""Great! That's a C."
263.308	"Let's build the first floor."""
266.067	(Laughter)
267.109	Same thing.
268.287	We have two weeks, do what you can,
268.287	inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.
272.15	Great, that's a D-plus.
273.333	Second floor, third floor,
274.603	and all of a sudden,
274.603	while you're building the third floor,
277.405	the whole structure collapses.
278.865	And if your reaction is the reaction
278.865	you typically have in education,
282.133	or that a lot of folks have,
283.498	you might say, maybe
283.498	we had a bad contractor,
285.628	or maybe we needed better inspection
285.628	or more frequent inspection.
288.745	But what was really broken
288.745	was the process.
291.018	We were artificially constraining
291.018	how long we had to something,
294.071	pretty much ensuring a variable outcome,
296.468	and we took the trouble of inspecting
296.468	and identifying those gaps,
300.016	but then we built right on top of it.
301.973	So the idea of mastery learning
301.973	is to do the exact opposite.
304.934	Instead of artificially
304.934	constraining, fixing
307.426	when and how long you work on something,
309.438	pretty much ensuring
309.438	that variable outcome,
311.68	the A, B, C, D, F --
313.98	do it the other way around.
315.844	What's variable is when and how long
317.66	a student actually has
317.66	to work on something,
319.778	and what's fixed is that
319.778	they actually master the material.
323.445	And it's important to realize
325.12	that not only will this make the student
325.12	learn their exponents better,
328.509	but it'll reinforce
328.509	the right mindset muscles.
331.491	It makes them realize that if you got
334.943	it doesn't mean that you have
334.943	a C branded in your DNA somehow.
338.356	It means that you should just
338.356	keep working on it.
340.814	You should have grit;
340.814	you should have perseverance;
343.33	you should take agency over your learning.
345.908	Now, a lot of skeptics might say,
345.908	well, hey, this is all great,
348.922	philosophically, this whole idea
348.922	of mastery-based learning
351.667	and its connection to mindset,
353.127	students taking agency
353.127	over their learning.
355.25	It makes a lot of sense,
355.25	but it seems impractical.
358.409	To actually do it, every student
358.409	would be on their own track.
361.83	It would have to be personalized,
363.478	you'd have to have private tutors
363.478	and worksheets for every student.
366.684	And these aren't new ideas --
368.207	there were experiments
368.207	in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,
371.057	where they did mastery-based learning
371.057	and saw great results,
373.899	but they said it wouldn't scale
373.899	because it was logistically difficult.
377.22	The teacher had to give different
377.22	worksheets to every student,
380.151	give on-demand assessments.
381.463	But now today, it's no longer impractical.
383.748	We have the tools to do it.
385.138	Students see an explanation
385.138	at their own time and pace?
387.757	There's on-demand video for that.
389.376	They need practice? They need feedback?
391.472	There's adaptive exercises
391.472	readily available for students.
396.311	And when that happens,
396.311	all sorts of neat things happen.
398.929	One, the students can actually
398.929	master the concepts,
401.726	but they're also building
401.726	their growth mindset,
403.945	they're building grit, perseverance,
405.766	they're taking agency over their learning.
407.813	And all sorts of beautiful things
407.813	can start to happen
410.394	in the actual classroom.
412.054	Instead of it being focused
412.054	on the lecture,
414.136	students can interact with each other.
415.978	They can get deeper mastery
415.978	over the material.
418.16	They can go into simulations,
418.16	Socratic dialogue.
420.537	To appreciate what we're talking about
423.24	and the tragedy of lost potential here,
427.311	I'd like to give a little bit
427.311	of a thought experiment.
430.985	If we were to go 400 years
430.985	into the past to Western Europe,
436.075	which even then, was one of the more
436.075	literate parts of the planet,
439.263	you would see that about 15 percent
439.263	of the population knew how to read.
443.556	And I suspect that if you asked someone
443.556	who did know how to read,
447.218	say a member of the clergy,
449.138	"""What percentage of the population"
449.138	"do you think is even capable of reading?"""
452.774	"They might say, ""Well,"
452.774	with a great education system,
456.359	"maybe 20 or 30 percent."""
459.424	But if you fast forward to today,
461.035	we know that that prediction
461.035	would have been wildly pessimistic,
464.074	that pretty close to 100 percent
464.074	of the population is capable of reading.
468.223	But if I were to ask you
468.223	a similar question:
471.494	"""What percentage of the population"
471.494	do you think is capable
475.057	of truly mastering calculus,
477.954	or understanding organic chemistry,
480.991	or being able to contribute
480.991	"to cancer research?"""
484.301	"A lot of you might say, ""Well,"
484.301	with a great education system,
487.222	"maybe 20, 30 percent."""
489.778	But what if that estimate
491.115	is just based on your own experience
491.115	in a non-mastery framework,
494.526	your own experience with yourself
494.526	or observing your peers,
497.382	where you're being pushed
497.382	at this set pace through classes,
500.195	accumulating all these gaps?
501.558	Even when you got that 95 percent,
503.223	what was that five percent you missed?
505.059	And it keeps accumulating --
505.059	you get to an advanced class,
507.81	all of a sudden you hit a wall and say,
509.706	"""I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;"
511.733	not meant to be a physicist;
511.733	"not meant to be a mathematician."""
514.685	I suspect that that actually is the case,
516.686	but if you were allowed to be operating
516.686	in a mastery framework,
520.536	if you were allowed to really
520.536	take agency over your learning,
523.977	and when you get something wrong,
525.597	embrace it -- view that failure
525.597	as a moment of learning --
528.413	that number, the percent
528.413	that could really master calculus
532.394	or understand organic chemistry,
534.178	is actually a lot closer to 100 percent.
537.601	"And this isn't even just a ""nice to have."""
541.019	I think it's a social imperative.
543.511	We're exiting what you could call
543.511	the industrial age
547.386	and we're going into
547.386	this information revolution.
551.646	And it's clear that some
551.646	things are happening.
553.844	In the industrial age,
553.844	society was a pyramid.
555.981	At the base of the pyramid,
555.981	you needed human labor.
561.085	In the middle of the pyramid,
561.085	you had an information processing,
564.442	a bureaucracy class,
566.064	and at the top of the pyramid,
566.064	you had your owners of capital
569.762	and your entrepreneurs
571.785	and your creative class.
573.904	But we know what's happening already,
575.724	as we go into this information revolution.
577.763	The bottom of that pyramid,
577.763	automation, is going to take over.
580.74	Even that middle tier,
580.74	information processing,
583.089	that's what computers are good at.
584.739	So as a society, we have a question:
586.51	All this new productivity is happening
586.51	because of this technology,
589.652	but who participates in it?
591.006	Is it just going to be that very top
591.006	of the pyramid, in which case,
594.225	what does everyone else do?
595.59	How do they operate?
596.78	Or do we do something
596.78	that's more aspirational?
599.581	Do we actually attempt
599.581	to invert the pyramid,
602.715	where you have a large creative class,
604.74	where almost everyone
604.74	can participate as an entrepreneur,
608.445	an artist, as a researcher?
610.85	And I don't think that this is utopian.
612.804	I really think that this
612.804	is all based on the idea
615.192	that if we let people
615.192	tap into their potential
617.4	by mastering concepts,
619.388	by being able to exercise agency
619.388	over their learning,
622.989	that they can get there.
624.672	And when you think of it
624.672	as just a citizen of the world,
628.696	it's pretty exciting.
629.983	I mean, think about
629.983	the type of equity we can we have,
632.635	and the rate at which civilization
632.635	could even progress.
636.339	And so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.
638.576	I think it's going to be
638.576	a pretty exciting time to be alive.
642.163	Thank you.
643.353	(Applause)
