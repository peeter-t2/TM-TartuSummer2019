12.051	What I'm going to do is,
12.051	I'm going to explain to you
15.014	an extreme green concept
17.066	that was developed
17.066	at NASA's Glenn Research Center
20.058	in Cleveland, Ohio.
22.06	But before I do that, we have to go over
24.49	the definition of what green is,
26.027	'cause a lot of us have a
26.027	different definition of it.
29.024	Green. The product is created through
31.017	environmentally and socially
31.017	conscious means.
33.48	There's plenty of things that
33.48	are being called green now.
36.668	What does it actually mean?
38.28	We use three metrics to determine green.
41.923	The first metric is: Is it sustainable?
45.015	Which means, are you preserving
45.015	what you are doing for future use
48.539	or for future generations?
51.034	Is it alternative? Is it different
51.034	than what is being used today,
55.007	or does it have a lower carbon footprint
57.812	than what's used conventionally?
60.396	And three: Is it renewable?
63.231	Does it come from Earth's
63.231	natural replenishing resources,
66.987	such as sun, wind and water?
70.087	Now, my task at NASA is to develop
73.619	the next generation of aviation fuels.
76.815	Extreme green. Why aviation?
79.644	The field of aviation uses
79.644	more fuel than just about
83.001	every other combined. We
83.001	need to find an alternative.
88.017	Also it's a national
88.017	aeronautics directive.
91.017	One of the national aeronautics
91.017	goals is to develop
93.685	the next generation of fuels, biofuels,
96.381	using domestic and safe,
96.381	friendly resources.
100.091	Now, combating that challenge
102.959	we have to also meet
102.959	the big three metric —
105.849	Actually, extreme green
105.849	for us is all three together;
109.662	that's why you see the plus
109.662	there. I was told to say that.
112.052	So it has to be the big three at
112.052	GRC. That's another metric.
117.049	Ninety-seven percent of the
117.049	world's water is saltwater.
123	How about we use that?
123	Combine that with number three.
127.01	Do not use arable land.
130.042	Because crops are already
130.042	growing on that land
132.222	that's very scarce around the world.
135.019	Number two: Don't compete with food crops.
138.026	That's already a well established
138.026	entity, they don't need another entry.
142.443	And lastly the most precious
142.443	resource we have on this Earth
146.391	is fresh water. Don't use fresh water.
151.051	If 97.5 percent
151.051	of the world's water is saltwater,
154.022	2.5 percent is fresh water.
154.022	Less than a half percent
157.299	of that is accessible for human use.
159.06	But 60 percent of the population
159.06	lives within that one percent.
163.021	So, combating my problem was,
163.021	now I have to be extreme green
168.013	and meet the big three.
168.013	Ladies and gentlemen,
170.261	welcome to the GreenLab Research Facility.
174.007	This is a facility dedicated
174.007	to the next generation
176.942	of aviation fuels using halophytes.
180.087	A halophyte is a salt-tolerating plant.
183.065	Most plants don't like salt,
183.065	but halophytes tolerate salt.
187.093	We also are using weeds
190.088	and we are also using algae.
193.019	The good thing about our lab is, we've had
195.01	3,600 visitors in the last two years.
198.02	Why do you think that's so?
200.022	Because we are on to something special.
204.028	So, in the lower you see
204.028	the GreenLab obviously,
206.597	and on the right hand
206.597	side you'll see algae.
209.049	If you are into the business
209.049	of the next generation
212.002	of aviation fuels, algae
212.002	is a viable option,
214.322	there's a lot of funding right now,
216.001	and we have an algae to fuels program.
218.022	There's two types of algae growing.
220.022	One is a closed photobioreactor
220.022	that you see here,
223.015	and what you see on the other
223.015	side is our species —
227.036	we are currently using a species
227.036	called Scenedesmus dimorphus.
231.006	Our job at NASA is to take the
231.006	experimental and computational
235.312	and make a better mixing for
235.312	the closed photobioreactors.
240.007	Now the problems with closed
240.007	photobioreactors are:
242.044	They are quite expensive,
242.044	they are automated,
244.775	and it's very difficult
244.775	to get them in large scale.
247.803	So on large scale what do they use?
249.428	We use open pond systems.
249.428	Now, around the world
252.921	they are growing algae,
252.921	with this racetrack design
256.442	that you see here. Looks like an oval with
258.891	a paddle wheel and mixes really well,
261.028	but when it gets around the last turn,
261.028	which I call turn four — it's stagnant.
265.086	We actually have a solution for that.
267.076	In the GreenLab in our open pond system
270.04	we use something that happens
270.04	in nature: waves.
273.055	We actually use wave technology
273.055	on our open pond systems.
276.747	We have 95 percent mixing
276.747	and our lipid content is higher
281.431	than a closed photobioreactor system,
284.049	which we think is significant.
286.03	There is a drawback to algae,
286.03	however: It's very expensive.
290.062	Is there a way to produce
290.062	algae inexpensively?
295.165	And the answer is: yes.
297.026	We do the same thing
297.026	we do with halophytes,
300.049	and that is: climatic adaptation.
304.004	In our GreenLab we have
304.004	six primary ecosystems
306.816	that range from freshwater
306.816	all the way to saltwater.
310.787	What we do: We take a potential
310.787	species, we start at freshwater,
314.546	we add a little bit more salt,
314.546	when the second tank here
317.274	will be the same ecosystem as Brazil —
319.406	right next to the sugar cane
319.406	fields you can have our plants —
322.502	the next tank represents Africa,
322.502	the next tank represents Arizona,
326.745	the next tank represents Florida,
329.056	and the next tank represents
329.056	California or the open ocean.
332.919	What we are trying to do is to
332.919	come up with a single species
337.014	that can survive anywhere in the
337.014	world, where there's barren desert.
343.019	We are being very successful so far.
345.057	Now, here's one of the problems.
347.701	If you are a farmer, you need five things
347.701	to be successful: You need seeds,
353.428	you need soil, you need
353.428	water and you need sun,
357.043	and the last thing that you
357.043	need is fertilizer.
360.613	Most people use chemical fertilizers.
360.613	But guess what?
364.168	We do not use chemical fertilizer.
366.868	Wait a second! I just saw lots of greenery
366.868	in your GreenLab. You have to use fertilizer.
372.023	Believe it or not, in our analysis
372.023	of our saltwater ecosystems
	are in these tanks themselves.
380.028	The 20 percent that's missing
380.028	is nitrogen and phosphorous.
384.027	We have a natural solution: fish.
386.083	No we don't cut up the fish
386.083	and put them in there.
389.971	Fish waste is what we use.
389.971	As a matter of fact
393.854	we use freshwater mollies, that we've
393.854	used our climatic adaptation technique
398.019	from freshwater all the way to seawater.
401.041	Freshwater mollies: cheap,
401.041	they love to make babies,
408.037	and they love to go to the bathroom.
409.846	And the more they go to the
409.846	bathroom, the more fertilizer we get,
412.001	the better off we are, believe it or not.
414.54	It should be noted that we use
414.54	sand as our soil,
419.805	regular beach sand. Fossilized coral.
424.03	So a lot of people ask me,
424.03	"""How did you get started?"""
428.001	Well, we got started in what we
428.001	call the indoor biofuels lab.
433.006	It's a seedling lab. We have 26
433.006	different species of halophytes,
437.412	and five are winners. What we do here is —
440.684	actually it should be called
440.684	a death lab, 'cause we try to
443.509	kill the seedlings, make them rough —
446.098	and then we come to the GreenLab.
448.418	What you see in the lower corner
450.176	is a wastewater treatment plant experiment
452.364	that we are growing, a macro-algae
452.364	that I'll talk about in a minute.
456.057	And lastly, it's me actually working
456.057	in the lab to prove to you I do work,
460.043	I don't just talk about what I do.
463.775	Here's the plant species.
463.775	Salicornia virginica.
467.005	It's a wonderful plant. I love that plant.
470.564	Everywhere we go we see it. It's
470.564	all over the place, from Maine
474.03	all the way to California.
474.03	We love that plant.
477.041	Second is Salicornia bigelovii. Very
477.041	difficult to get around the world.
482.006	It is the highest lipid
482.006	content that we have,
484.052	but it has a shortcoming: It's short.
488.042	Now you take europaea, which is the
488.042	largest or the tallest plant that we have.
493.163	And what we are trying to do
495.081	with natural selection or adaptive
495.081	biology — combine all three
499.462	to make a high-growth, high-lipid plant.
503.578	Next, when a hurricane decimated the
503.578	Delaware Bay — soybean fields gone —
510.842	we came up with an idea:
510.842	Can you have a plant
513.706	that has a land reclamation positive
513.706	in Delaware? And the answer is yes.
519.017	It's called seashore mallow.
519.017	Kosteletzkya virginica —
522.991	say that five times fast if you can.
526.009	This is a 100 percent usable plant. The
526.009	seeds: biofuels. The rest: cattle feed.
533.597	It's there for 10 years;
533.597	it's working very well.
537.036	Now we get to Chaetomorpha.
540.363	This is a macro-algae that loves
543.585	excess nutrients. If you
543.585	are in the aquarium industry
546.007	you know we use it
546.007	to clean up dirty tanks.
548.818	This species is so significant to us.
553.029	The properties are very close to plastic.
557	We are trying right now to convert
557	this macro-algae into a bioplastic.
562.378	If we are successful, we will
562.378	revolutionize the plastics industry.
567.051	So, we have a seed to fuel program.
570.573	We have to do something with
570.573	this biomass that we have.
573.53	And so we do G.C. extraction, lipid
573.53	optimization, so on and so forth,
578.039	because our goal really is to come up with
581.726	the next generation of aviation fuels,
581.726	aviation specifics, so on and so forth.
585.636	So far we talked about water and fuel,
590.056	but along the way we found out
590.056	something interesting about Salicornia:
597	It's a food product.
600.686	So we talk about ideas
600.686	worth spreading, right?
603.499	How about this: In sub-Saharan
603.499	Africa, next to the sea, saltwater,
610.353	barren desert,
610.353	how about we take that plant,
615.212	plant it, half use for food,
615.212	half use for fuel.
620.044	We can make that happen, inexpensively.
623.845	You can see
623.845	there's a greenhouse in Germany
626.543	that sells it as a health food product.
629.007	This is harvested, and in the middle here
629.007	is a shrimp dish, and it's being pickled.
634.233	So I have to tell you a joke.
634.233	Salicornia is known as sea beans,
638.846	saltwater asparagus and pickle weed.
642.319	So we are pickling pickle
642.319	weed in the middle.
645.05	Oh, I thought it was funny. (Laughter)
647.852	And at the bottom is seaman's mustard.
647.852	It does make sense,
651.225	this is a logical snack. You have mustard,
653.612	you are a seaman, you see the
653.612	halophyte, you mix it together,
656.76	it's a great snack with some crackers.
659.022	And last, garlic with Salicornia,
659.022	which is what I like.
666.022	So, water, fuel and food.
670.997	None of this is possible
670.997	without the GreenLab team.
674.548	Just like the Miami Heat has the big
674.548	three, we have the big three at NASA GRC.
679.529	That's myself, professor Bob Hendricks,
679.529	our fearless leader, and Dr. Arnon Chait.
685.008	The backbone of the GreenLab is students.
689.537	Over the last two years
689.537	we've had 35 different students
693.452	from around the world working at GreenLab.
696.607	As a matter fact my division chief says
696.607	"a lot, ""You have a green university."""
701.016	"I say, ""I'm okay with that,"
701.016	'cause we are nurturing
703.551	the next generation of extreme
703.551	"green thinkers, which is significant."""
708.575	So, in first summary I presented
708.575	to you what we think
713.896	is a global solution
713.896	for food, fuel and water.
720.023	There's something missing to be complete.
723.017	Clearly we use electricity.
723.017	We have a solution for you —
727.808	We're using clean energy sources here.
731.057	So, we have two wind turbines
731.057	connected to the GreenLab,
735.478	we have four or five more
735.478	hopefully coming soon.
739.005	We are also using something
739.005	that is quite interesting —
742.615	there is a solar array field at
742.615	NASA's Glenn Research Center,
747.238	hasn't been used for 15 years.
750.38	Along with some of my electrical
750.38	engineering colleagues,
753.143	we realized that they are still viable,
755.286	so we are refurbishing them right now.
758.042	In about 30 days or so they'll be
758.042	connected to the GreenLab.
763.078	And the reason why you see
763.078	red, red and yellow, is
766.004	a lot of people think NASA employees
766.004	don't work on Saturday —
769.271	This is a picture taken on Saturday.
772.189	There are no cars around, but you see my truck
772.189	in yellow. I work on Saturday. (Laughter)
776.814	This is a proof to you that I'm working.
778.647	'Cause we do what it takes to get the
778.647	job done, most people know that.
782.547	Here's a concept with this:
785.425	We are using the GreenLab
785.425	for a micro-grid test bed
790.981	for the smart grid concept in Ohio.
795.044	We have the ability to do that,
795.044	and I think it's going to work.
800.951	So, GreenLab Research Facility.
806.044	A self-sustainable renewable energy
806.044	ecosystem was presented today.
811.067	We really, really hope this
811.067	concept catches on worldwide.
817.014	We think we have a solution for food,
817.014	water, fuel and now energy. Complete.
826.064	It's extreme green, it's sustainable,
826.064	alternative and renewable
832.189	and it meets the big three at GRC:
836.027	Don't use arable land, don't
836.027	compete with food crops,
841.018	and most of all, don't use fresh water.
844.08	So I get a lot of questions about,
844.08	"""What are you doing in that lab?"""
849.054	"And I usually say, ""None of your business,"
849.054	"that's what I'm doing in the lab."" (Laughter)"
854.807	And believe it or not, my number one goal
858.35	for working on this project is
861.06	I want to help save the world.
