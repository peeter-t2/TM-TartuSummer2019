12.867	Zika fever:
15.94	our newest dread disease.
19.67	What is it? Where'd it come from?
22.69	What do we do about it?
24.85	Well for most adults,
24.85	it's a relatively mild disease --
28.144	a little fever, a little headache,
28.144	joint pain, maybe a rash.
32.83	In fact, most people who get it
32.83	don't even know they've had it.
36.64	But the more we find out
36.64	about the Zika virus
40.378	the more terrifying it becomes.
41.95	For example, doctors
41.95	have noticed an uptick
45.481	of something called Guillain-Barré
45.481	syndrome in recent outbreaks.
49.219	In Guillain-Barré, your immune system
49.219	attacks your nerve cells
52.395	it can partially
52.395	or even totally paralyze you.
56.092	Fortunately, that's quite rare,
56.092	and most people recover.
60.04	But if you're pregnant
60.04	when you're infected
65.72	you're at risk of something terrible.
68.524	Indeed, a child with a deformed head.
72.5	Here's a normal baby.
75.134	Here's that infant
75.134	with what's called microcephaly.
78.895	a brain in a head that's too small.
82.213	And there's no known cure.
84.941	It was actually doctors
84.941	in northeastern Brazil
90.695	who first noticed, just a year ago,
90.695	after a Zika outbreak,
95.829	that there was a peak
95.829	in the incidence of microcephaly.
100.583	It took medical doctors another year
102.33	to be sure that it was caused
102.33	by the Zika virus,
105.146	but they're now sure.
106.321	"And if you're a ""bring on"
106.321	"the evidence"" type,"
109.027	check out this publication.
111.58	So where did it come from,
111.58	and how did it get here?
114.548	And it is here.
115.881	Like many of our viruses,
115.881	it came out of Africa,
119.261	specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.
123.596	Researchers at the nearby
123.596	Yellow Fever Research Institute
128.398	identified an unknown virus
128.398	in a monkey in the Zika forest
132.708	which is how it got its name.
135.413	The first human cases of Zika fever
137.65	surfaced a few years later
137.65	in Uganda-Tanzania.
141.299	The virus then spread through West Africa
145.036	and east through equatorial Asia --
145.036	Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.
152.164	But it was still mostly in monkeys
152.164	and, of course, mosquitoes.
157.692	In fact in the 60 years between the time
157.692	it was first identified in 1947 and 2007
163.514	there were only 13 reported cases
163.514	of human Zika fever.
167.551	And then something extraordinary happened
167.551	on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.
173.52	There was an outbreak that affected
173.52	fully 75 percent of the population.
179.686	How did it get there? By air.
183.4	Today we have two billion
183.4	commercial airline passengers.
187.16	An infected passenger can board a plane,
187.16	fly halfway around the world
191.427	before developing symptoms --
191.427	if they develop symptoms at all.
195.96	Then when they land, the local mosquitoes
195.96	begin to bite them and spread the fever.
200.937	Zika fever then next surfaced
200.937	in 2013 in French Polynesia.
207.18	By December of that year, it was being
207.18	transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.
212.834	That led to an explosive outbreak in which
212.834	almost 30,000 people were affected.
218.191	From there it radiated around the Pacific.
220.612	There were outbreaks in the Cook
220.612	Islands, in New Caledonia,
225.524	in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands
227.968	and almost all the way around to the coast
227.968	of South America and Easter Island.
232.88	And then, in early 2015,
236.356	there was an upsurge of cases
236.356	of a dengue-like syndrome
241.213	in the city of Natal
241.213	in northeastern Brazil.
245.141	The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika,
245.141	and it spread rapidly --
251.267	Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan
251.267	center, soon became the epicenter.
257.235	Well people have speculated that it was
262.861	that brought the virus into the country.
265.66	But others have speculated that perhaps
265.66	it was Pacific Islanders
269.755	participating in championship canoe races
272.438	that were held in Rio that year
272.438	that brought it in.
275.65	Well today, this is only a year later.
279.583	The virus is being locally transmitted
279.583	by mosquitoes
283.024	virtually throughout South America,
283.024	Central America, Mexico
286.309	and the Caribbean Islands
288.5	Until this year, the many
288.5	thousands of cases
291.911	that have been diagnosed in the US
291.911	were contracted elsewhere.
296.896	But as of this summer, it's being
296.896	transmitted locally in Miami.
302.078	It's here.
303.343	So what do we do about it?
304.99	Well, preventing infection
309.855	is either about protecting people
309.855	or about eliminating the mosquitoes.
314.08	Let's focus on people first.
316.51	You can get vaccinated.
318.892	You can not travel to Zika areas.
322.889	Or you can cover up
322.889	and apply insect repellent.
326.658	Getting vaccinated is not an option,
326.658	because there isn't a vaccine yet
330.087	and there probably won't be
330.087	for a couple of years.
333.673	Staying home isn't
333.673	a foolproof protection either
337.64	because we now know that
337.64	it can be sexually transmitted.
342	Covering up and applying
342	insect repellent does work ...
345.476	until you forget.
347.642	(Laughter)
349.444	So that leaves the mosquitoes,
349.444	and here's how we control them now:
353.055	spraying insecticides.
356.134	The protective gear is necessary
356.134	because these are toxic chemicals
360.024	that kill people as well as bugs.
362.649	Although it does take quite a lot more
362.649	to kill a person than to kill a bug.
366.44	These are pictures from
366.44	Brazil and Nicaragua.
370.64	But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.
373.59	And we of course can spray
373.59	insecticides from planes.
379.28	Last summer, mosquito control officials
379.28	in Dorchester County, South Carolina,
385.518	authorized spraying of Naled,
385.518	an insecticide,
389.447	early one morning,
389.447	as recommended by the manufacturer.
392.81	Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters
397.049	that her bee yard looked
397.049	like it had been nuked.
401.644	Oops.
403.699	Bees are the good guys.
405.46	The citizens of Florida protested,
405.46	but spraying continued.
413.071	Unfortunately, so did the increase
413.071	in the number of Zika fever cases.
418.02	That's because insecticides
418.02	aren't very effective.
422.21	So are there any approaches that are
422.21	perhaps more effective than spraying
430.38	but with less downsides
430.38	than toxic chemicals?
436.15	I'm a huge fan of biological controls,
439.665	and I share that view with Rachel Carson,
439.665	"author of ""Silent Spring,"""
444.182	the book that is credited with starting
444.182	the environmental movement.
449.22	In this book she tells the story,
449.22	as an example,
452.8	of how a very nasty insect
452.8	pest of livestock
458.482	was eliminated in the last century.
461.97	No one knows that
461.97	extraordinary story today.
464.446	So Jack Block and I,
464.446	when we were writing an editorial
468.709	about the mosquito problem today,
468.709	retold that story.
471.947	And in capsule form, it's that pupae --
471.947	that's the immature form of the insect --
476.637	were irradiated until they were sterile,
476.637	grown to adulthood
481.44	and then released from planes
481.44	all over the Southwest,
485.074	the Southeast and down into Mexico
485.074	and into Central America
489.511	literally by the hundreds of millions
489.511	from little airplanes,
493.629	eventually eliminating
493.629	that terrible insect pest
498.502	for most of the Western Hemisphere.
501.995	Our real purpose in writing this editorial
504.423	was to introduce readers
504.423	to how we can do that today --
507.819	not with radiation
507.819	but with our knowledge of genetics.
511.898	Let me explain.
513.73	This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti.
516.23	It's the most common insect
516.23	vector of diseases,
520.915	not just Zika but dengue,
520.915	Chikungunya, West Nile virus
524.733	and that ancient plague, yellow fever.
528.79	It's an urban mosquito,
530.679	and it's the female
530.679	that does the dirty work.
534.609	She bites to get a blood meal
534.609	to feed her offspring.
540.07	Males don't bite; they don't even
540.07	have the mouth parts to bite.
544.419	A little British company called Oxitec
544.419	genetically modified that mosquito
550.601	so that when it mates with a wild female,
550.601	its eggs don't develop to adulthood.
556.97	Let me show you.
558.477	This is the normal reproductive cycle.
561.715	Oxitec designed the mosquito so that
561.715	when the male mates with the wild female
566.897	the eggs don't develop.
568.6	Sounds impossible?
570.56	Well let me show you
570.56	just diagrammatically how they do it.
574.36	Now this represents the nucleus
574.36	of a mosquito cell,
577.836	and that tangle in the middle
577.836	represents its genome,
580.812	the sum total of its genes.
583.336	Scientists added a single gene
586.709	that codes for a protein represented
586.709	by this orange ball
591.042	that feeds back on itself
591.042	to keep cranking out more of that protein.
597.06	The extra copies, however,
597.06	go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes,
601.837	killing the organism.
604.06	To keep it alive in the laboratory
604.06	they use a compound called tetracycline.
608.456	Tetracycline shuts off that gene
608.456	and allows normal development.
613.844	They added another little wrinkle
613.844	so that they could study what happens.
618.201	And that is they added a gene
618.201	that makes the insect glow under UV light
625.456	so that when they released it
625.456	they could follow exactly how far it went
628.822	how long it lived
628.822	and all of the kinds of data
632.6	for a good scientific study.
634.97	Now this is the pupal stage,
634.97	and at this stage
639.106	the females are larger than the males.
642.42	That allows them to sort them
642.42	into the males and the females
646.312	and they allow only the males
646.312	to grow to adulthood.
651.058	And let me remind you
651.058	that males don't bite.
653.4	From there it's pretty simple.
655.02	They take beakers full of male mosquitoes,
658.646	load them into milk cartons,
658.646	and drive around the city,
661.25	releasing them guided by GPS.
664.678	Here's the mayor of a city
664.678	releasing the first batch
667.219	"of what they call the ""friendly Aedes."""
670.23	Now I wish I could tell you
670.23	this is an American city, but it's not.
673.515	It's Piracicaba, Brazil.
675.991	The amazing thing is that in just a year
680.808	it brought down the cases
680.808	of dengue by 91 percent.
686.31	That's better than any insecticide
686.31	spraying can do.
690.24	So why aren't we using this remarkable
690.24	biological control in the US?
695.77	That's because it's a GMO:
695.77	a genetically modified organism.
702.72	Notice the subtitle here says
702.72	if the FDA would let them
707.664	they could do the same thing here,
707.664	when Zika arrives.
710.39	And of course it has arrived.
712.428	So now I have to tell you the short form
716.16	of the long, torturous story
716.16	of GM regulation in the US
722.747	In the US, there are three agencies that
722.747	regulate genetically modified organisms:
729.985	the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration,
732.5	the EPA, the Environmental
732.5	Protection Agency,
734.746	and the USDA, US Department
734.746	of Agriculture.
738.34	Took these folks two years
738.34	to decide that it would be the FDA
743.157	that would regulate the genetically
743.157	modified mosquito.
746.084	And they would do it as a new animal drug,
746.084	if that makes any sense.
753.13	Took them another five years going back
753.13	and forth and back and forth
756.685	to convince the FDA
756.685	that this would not harm people,
762.096	and it would not harm the environment.
765.1	They finally gave them, this summer,
765.1	permission to run a little test
770.451	in the Florida Keys,
772.014	where they had been invited years earlier
772.014	when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.
779.604	Would that it were that easy.
782.17	When the local residents heard
784.4	that there would be genetically modified
784.4	mosquitoes tested in their community
788.519	some of them began to organize protests.
791.368	They even organized a petition on
791.368	the internet with this cuddly logo,
796.963	which eventually accumulated
796.963	some 160,000 signatures
803.224	And they demanded a referendum
804.93	which will be conducted
804.93	in just a couple of weeks
807.826	about whether the trials
807.826	would be permitted at all.
812.135	Well it's Miami that really needs
812.135	these better ways of controlling insects.
818.556	And there the attitudes are changing.
820.721	In fact, very recently a bipartisan group
820.721	of more than 60 legislators
826.76	wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell
829.966	asking that she, at the Federal level,
829.966	expedite access for Florida
835.334	to this new technology.
838.02	So the bottom line is this:
839.631	biological control of harmful insects
843.583	can be both more effective and
843.583	very much more environmentally friendly
848.519	than using insecticides,
848.519	which are toxic chemicals.
853.336	That was true in Rachel Carson's
853.336	time; it's true today.
856.8	What's different is that we have
856.8	enormously more information
862.538	about genetics than we had then,
864.459	and therefore more ability
864.459	to use that information
868.999	to affect these biological controls.
872.26	And I hope that what I've done
872.26	is aroused your curiosity enough
877.212	to start your own inquiry --
877.212	not into just GM mosquitoes
882.52	but to the other genetically modified
882.52	organisms that are so controversial today.
889.567	I think if you do that, and you dig down
889.567	through all of the misinformation,
894.288	and the marketing
895.622	on the part of the organic food industry
895.622	and the Greenpeaces
899.034	and find the science,
899.034	the accurate science,
902.208	you'll be surprised and pleased.
904.94	Thank you.
906.114	(Applause)
