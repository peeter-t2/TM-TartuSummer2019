16.048	What I want to do this afternoon
17.675	is something a little different than what's scheduled.
20.54	Foreign policy, you can figure that out
22.486	by watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,
25.52	but — (Laughter) —
27.354	I want to talk about young people and structure,
30.916	young people and structure.
32.883	This was last Wednesday afternoon
35.131	at a school in Brooklyn, New York,
37.635	at Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.
40.569	And I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.
44.406	They were around me in three directions.
46.873	You'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.
49.669	You'll notice that the building is rather austere.
51.514	It's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.
55.645	They still have old blackboards and whatnot.
58.176	And there are about 300 kids in this school,
60.767	and the school's been going now for four years,
63.419	and they're about to graduate their first class.
66.373	Twenty-two people are graduating,
68.444	and all 22 are going to college.
70.687	They all come from homes where there is, for the most part,
73.427	just one person in the home,
75.95	usually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,
78.856	and they come here for their education
81.343	and for their structure.
82.756	Now I had this picture taken, and it was put up
85.564	on my Facebook page last week,
88.057	and somebody wrote in,
89.691	"""Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"""
94.677	"And then they said, ""But he looks good."" (Laughter)"
99.048	He does look good, because kids need structure,
101.758	and the trick I play in all of my school appearances
105.264	is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,
108.163	I then invite them to ask questions,
110.347	"and when they raise their hands, I say, ""Come up,"""
112.212	and I make them come up and stand in front of me.
114.551	I make them stand at attention like a soldier.
116.665	Put your arms straight down at your side,
118.447	look up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,
121.899	and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.
125.334	No slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.
128.591	(Laughter)
129.962	And this young man, his name is -- his last name Cruz --
133.227	he loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.
137.064	(Laughter)
139.251	So people think I'm being unkind to this kid.
141.994	No, we're having a little fun.
143.638	And the thing about it, I've done this for years,
146.052	the younger they are, the more fun it is.
149.212	When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,
152.152	I have to figure out how to keep them quiet.
154.031	You know that they'll always start yakking.
156.034	And so I play a little game with them
157.639	before I make them stand at attention.
159.211	"I say, ""Now listen. In the army,"
161.484	when we want you to pay attention,
163.812	we have a command. It's called 'at ease.'
166.997	It means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.
170.571	"Do you understand?"""
171.709	"""Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."""
176.574	"And I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, ""At ease!"""
179.871	"""Huh!"" (Laughter)"
183.376	"""Yes, General. Yes, General."""
185.898	Try it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)
188.301	I don't think so.
191.354	But anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously
194.368	from my military experience.
196.09	Because for the majority of my adult life,
199.519	I worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.
203.579	And we would bring them into the army,
206.024	and the first thing we would do is to put them
208.473	in an environment of structure, put them in ranks,
212.56	make them all wear the same clothes,
213.983	cut all their hair off so they look alike,
216.477	make sure that they are standing in ranks.
218.681	We teach them how to go right face, left face,
220.461	so they can obey instructions and know
222.378	the consequences of not obeying instructions.
225.306	It gives them structure.
226.771	And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.
230.951	And they hate him.
232.825	And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,
235.173	and telling them to do all kinds of awful things.
239.022	But then the most amazing thing happens over time.
242.026	Once that structure is developed,
245.052	once they understand the reason for something,
248.27	"once they understand, ""Mama ain't here, son."
252.276	I'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.
256.096	And that's just the way it is. You got that, son?
258.708	Yeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:
261.546	yes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.
263.942	Don't start telling me why you didn't do something.
266.105	"It's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."""
268.757	"""You didn't shave.""""But sir —"""
269.88	"""No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning."
273.135	"I'm telling you you didn't shave."""
274.875	"""No excuse, sir.""""Attaboy, you're learning fast."""
278.081	But you'd be amazed at what you can do with them
280.469	once you put them in that structure.
282.923	In 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.
287.781	And you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant
290.898	and they never forget the drill sergeant.
292.796	They come to respect him.
295.431	And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect
299.346	in the lives of our children.
301.377	I spend a lot of time with youth groups,
303.35	"and I say to people, ""When does the education process begin?"""
306.641	"We're always talking about, ""Let's fix the schools."
308.32	Let's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.
312.067	"Let's get it all online."""
315.008	That isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.
318.314	But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school
321.576	with structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.
326.184	When does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?
329.053	No, no, it begins the first time
331.236	a child in a mother's arms
333.917	looks up at the mother
336.681	"and says, ""Oh, this must be my mother."
340.045	She's the one who feeds me.
342.418	Oh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,
344.624	she takes care of me.
347.138	"It's her language I will learn."""
350.161	And at that moment they shut out all the other languages
352.91	that they could be learning at that age,
355.266	but by three months, that's her.
358.215	And if the person doing it, whether it's the mother
360.535	or grandmother, whoever's doing it,
362.528	that is when the education process begins.
364.742	That's when language begins.
366.47	That's when love begins. That's when structure begins.
368.719	That's when you start to imprint on the child
371.207	"that ""you are special,"
373.425	you are different from every other child in the world.
376.614	"And we're going to read to you."""
378.698	A child who has not been read to
380.769	is in danger when that child gets to school.
382.913	A child who doesn't know his or her colors
384.973	or doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,
387.987	doesn't know how to do those things,
389.386	and doesn't know how to do something that
392.056	goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.
394.932	Mind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!
398.82	This is the way children are raised properly.
402.343	And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along
405.138	and they're, much to the distress of my children,
409.231	they are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.
413.907	And that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.
419.132	And I'm working at all the energy I have
421.391	to sort of communicate this message that
423.721	we need preschool, we need Head Start,
427.6	we need prenatal care.
430.12	The education process begins even before the child is born,
434.335	and if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.
437.043	And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities
439.457	and so many of our schools where kids are coming
442.502	to first grade and their eyes are blazing,
444.813	they've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,
448.424	and then they realize they're not like the other first graders
451.825	who know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.
456.289	And by the third grade, the kids who didn't have
458.983	that structure and minding in the beginning
463.129	start to realize they're behind, and what do they do?
465.039	They act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way
468.36	to jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.
471.446	It's predictable.
473.31	If you're not at the right reading level at third grade,
476.276	you are a candidate for jail at age 18,
480.353	and we have the highest incarceration rate
482.59	because we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.
485.518	The last chapter in my book is called
487.734	"""The Gift of a Good Start."""
490.645	The gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.
494.337	I was privileged to have that kind of good start.
497.04	I was not a great student.
498.931	I was a public school kid in New York City,
501.599	and I didn't do well at all.
504.239	I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript
508.051	from kindergarten through college.
510.494	I wanted it when I was writing my first book.
512.764	I wanted to see if my memory was correct,
514.803	and, my God, it was. (Laughter)
518.078	Straight C everywhere.
520.866	And I finally bounced through high school,
523.307	got into the City College of New York
525.386	with a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,
529.026	and then I started out in engineering,
531.765	and that only lasted six months. (Laughter)
534.323	"And then I went into geology, ""rocks for jocks."" This is easy."
538.336	And then I found ROTC.
540.338	I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,
544.272	and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.
548.166	And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.
552.152	And I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up
554.82	and as this structure is being developed inside of you,
557.421	always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,
560.457	and when you find those two things together, man, you got it.
563.594	That's what's going on. And that's what I found.
565.958	Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.
568.612	I'd been there four and a half going on five years,
570.413	and my grades were not doing particularly well,
574.823	and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.
577.965	"And so they said, ""But he does so well in ROTC."
580.879	"Look, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."""
584.229	"And so they said, ""Look, let's take his ROTC grades"
588.585	"and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."""
592.031	And they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)
598.747	Yep. (Laughter) (Applause)
602.481	"They said, ""It's good enough for government work."
605.53	"Give him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."""
609.028	So they shipped me off to the army,
610.88	and lo and behold, many years later,
614.548	I'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)
618.854	So, I tell young people everywhere,
622.056	it ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life
626.247	that determines where you end up in life,
629.858	and you are blessed to be living in a country that,
632.543	no matter where you start, you have opportunities
635.729	so long as you believe in yourself,
638.433	you believe in the society and the country,
641.424	and you believe that you can self-improve
644.843	and educate yourself as you go along.
647.254	And that's the key to success.
649.487	But it begins with the gift of a good start.
652.837	If we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,
655.31	if we don't invest at the earliest age,
658.988	we're going to be running into difficulties.
661.73	It's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall
665.996	and almost 50 percent of our minority population
668.718	living in low-income areas,
672.192	because they're not getting the gift of a good start.
674.973	My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,
678.951	a good family, but having a family that said to me,
682.506	"""Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats"
686.453	in 1920 and 1924.
689.815	We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.
693.99	We're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose
697.516	"or get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."""
701.896	If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people
704.947	"that, ""You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"""
707.416	"they'd said, ""We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."""
710.073	(Laughter)
716.431	They had expectations for all of the cousins
718.957	and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,
722.54	but they had more than just expectations for us.
725.699	They stuck into our hearts like a dagger
729.61	"a sense of shame: ""Don't you shame this family."""
734.472	Sometimes I would get in trouble,
736.135	and my parents were coming home,
737.978	and I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,
741.459	"and I would sit there saying to myself, ""Okay, look,"
743.67	"take the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."""
748.445	It devastated me when my mother did that to me.
751.202	And I also had this extended network.
753.366	Children need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,
756.354	a family, a community.
758.235	In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.
762.459	I don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,
764.315	but there were these tenement buildings,
766.236	and these women were always hanging out one of the windows,
769.449	leaning on a pillow.
771.071	They never left. (Laughter)
773.83	I, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,
776.864	and they were always there.
778.346	They never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)
781.22	They never did anything.
783.766	But what they did was keep us in play.
786.479	They kept us in play.
788.765	And they didn't care
791.023	whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,
795.77	and they never expected any generals in the family,
798.863	as long as you got an education and then you got a job.
802.723	"""Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff."
804.714	You get a job and get out of the house.
807.529	We don't have time to waste for that.
810.007	"And then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."""
813.582	And so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture
819.104	back into our families, all families.
823.386	And it is so important that all of you here today
826.721	who are successful people,
829.397	and I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,
833.952	it's not enough. You've got to reach out and back
835.69	and find kids like Mr. Cruz
838.341	who can make it if you give them the structure,
841.711	if you reach back and help, if you mentor,
843.698	if you invest in boys and girls clubs,
846.072	if you work with your school system,
847.963	make sure it's the best school system,
849.237	and not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,
854.06	not just downtown Montessori on the West Side.
856.882	All of us have to have a commitment to do that.
861.035	And we're not just investing in the kids.
863.685	We're investing in our future.
865.738	We're going to be a minority-majority country
868.559	in one more generation.
870.552	Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.
873.921	And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.
876.501	We have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders
878.732	of this great country of ours,
881.684	a country that is like no other,
885.16	a country that amazes me every single day,
886.845	a country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.
889.465	That's how the system's supposed to work.
892.437	It's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.
896.016	We touch every nation. Every nation touches us.
900.012	We are a nation of immigrants.
901.697	That's why we need sound immigration policy.
904.841	It's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy
908.076	to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,
911.159	or we can send back home with an education
913.312	to help their people rise up out of poverty.
916.693	One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love
920.536	of going to my hometown of New York
921.933	and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day
923.727	and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by
926.208	from all over the world.
927.662	But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners
931.3	and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.
934.686	Gotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)
937.837	And no matter where I am or what I'm doing,
940.817	I've got to do that.
942.092	I even did it when I was Secretary of State.
944.757	I'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria
947.658	— (Laughter)&nbsp;—
950.738	be walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street
954.049	looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.
956.36	In those days, I had five bodyguards around me
958.559	and three New York City police cars would roll alongside
961.453	to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)
966.273	And I would order the hot dog from the guy,
967.941	and he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around
970.387	at the bodyguards and the police cars --
972.064	"""I've got a green card! I've got a green card!"" (Laughter)"
974.146	"""It's okay, it's okay."""
978.482	But now I'm alone. I'm alone.
980.93	I've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.
983.721	But I gotta have my hot dog.
986.383	I did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening
990.147	down by Columbus Circle.
992.447	And the scene repeats itself so often.
995.302	I'll go up and ask for my hot dog,
998.656	and the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,
1001.018	"he'll say, ""I know you. I see you on television."
1003.72	"You're, well, you're General Powell."""
1005.614	"""Yes, yes.""""Oh ... """
1008.304	I hand him the money.
1009.455	"""No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid."
1014.38	America has paid me. I never forget where I came from.
1018.143	"But now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."""
1021.333	I accept the generosity, continue up the street,
1023.601	and it washes over me, my God,
1025.83	it's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.
1029.848	So we are still that magnificent country,
1032.035	but we are fueled by young people coming up
1034.81	from every land in the world,
1037.814	and it is our obligation as contributing citizens
1041.341	to this wonderful country of ours
1043.127	to make sure that no child gets left behind.
1046.274	Thank you very much.
1048.352	(Applause)
