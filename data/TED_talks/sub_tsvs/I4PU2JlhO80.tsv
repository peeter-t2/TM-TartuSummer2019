12.323	I'll tell you a little bit about my story
12.323	and who I am.
14.788	I'm a fashion photographer
14.788	based in New York City.
17.436	I've worked for lots 
17.436	of different magazines in New York,
20.258	I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire,
25.056	and for Interview and for GQ,
26.998	and I got to work 
26.998	with some really beautiful people.
29.505	My studio is in New York,
30.826	but I also lived in Milan
30.826	for about eight years,
33.047	and in Paris as well,
34.746	and worked for the house 
34.746	of Yves St. Laurent.
37.644	I also did portraiture as well.
42.475	I've worked for lots 
42.475	of different magazines,
44.904	lots of great clients.
46.653	But I was always told,
46.653	every single day, who was beautiful.
49.294	I was forced to work
50.826	within certain parameters 
50.826	of the beauty standard.
53.268	"I was told, ""This is the most "
53.268	amazing model of the moment,
55.841	you've got to photograph her.
57.227	"She's incredible, you've got to."""
59.305	And then the next season,
59.305	it would change again,
61.421	and I'd have to shift my ideas of beauty,
63.768	and so we'd go to the next model,
65.474	and it was kind of really crazy,
65.474	because I'm an artist.
68.205	I saw beauty everywhere.
69.849	I didn't see beauty 
69.849	just on a magazine cover.
72.769	I did a shoot with, of 
72.769	course, Cindy, for Revlon,
75.764	and really fantastic, beautiful people.
78.602	But I thought,
79.888	someone's always telling me 
79.888	who's beautiful.
82.59	And I was kind of frustrated.
84.086	I left my studio one 
84.086	afternoon in New York,
85.84	and I was walking down Park Avenue,
87.461	and I saw, waiting for a bus 
87.461	at the corner of Park and 20th,
90.552	this gorgeous kid.
92.593	She had long, white, beautiful hair,
92.593	and pale, pale skin.
96.406	She had a genetic condition 
96.406	called albinism.
99.109	I didn't know much about it, 
99.109	but she was stunning,
100.939	and I'd never met 
100.939	a model like this before.
102.721	And I went to grab her and say,
104.281	"""I have to take your photograph, "
104.281	"you're amazing!"""
106.431	And the bus came, she got on, 
106.431	and then she took off,
108.392	and I was really glad because she was 12,
110.413	and I'd be in prison at the moment.
110.413	(Laughter)
112.324	But really, it was 
112.324	extraordinary to see this kid.
115.057	So I continued right down to Union Square,
117.505	to the huge Barnes and Noble,
118.916	and started pulling any books,
118.916	or any information I could
121.548	about this genetic condition, albinism.
123.644	And I found really kind of sad images.
125.975	I didn't find images of this kid.
127.673	I found images of people 
127.673	sitting in hospital beds, looking sad,
131.171	looking downtrodden, 
131.171	just images of despair.
134.742	I found images 
134.742	of a bright red eye, the albino eye.
138.105	I'm thinking, 
138.105	this kid had beautiful blue eyes,
140.32	she didn't have red eyes.
141.785	And then I started seeing 
141.785	images from Africa,
143.812	where kids were surrounded by tribes 
143.812	pointing spears at them
147.322	or in cancer wards and clinics,
149.261	or they're just in beds, 
149.261	and images of illness,
152.114	of sadness, of sickness.
154.107	And then, I started, of course,
155.661	going through
155.661	those same medical textbooks,
157.161	and started finding 
157.161	these typical images
159.362	of kids and adults in their underwear, 
159.362	against walls in doctor's offices,
162.996	with the black bar across their eyes 
162.996	"saying ""disease."""
166.118	This is a disease, defined by a disease.
168.572	And I was like, this is crazy.
171.186	And then I started going into it further,
172.964	looking on the Internet,
174.308	and all these different medical textbooks,
176.068	and everything was so sad, 
176.068	and so negative.
178.978	I then started finding images 
178.978	of the albino freak family in the circus,
183.125	and then of course, 
183.125	all the movie references,
185.145	"from ""Powder,"" who had albinism because"
185.145	his mother was struck by lightning,
189.835	"to ""The Princess Bride"" and "
189.835	"to ""The Matrix Reloaded,"""
193.467	there were the ghost-like twins 
193.467	that came in and wreaked havoc,
196.157	and destroyed things and then disappeared.
198.552	"Even most recently, ""The Da Vinci Code,"""
200.808	there was like the evil albino 
200.808	driving around Paris at night,
203.698	killing people, shooting at people.
205.944	Well, I found out, through my research,
207.949	that people with albinism 
207.949	have a visual impairment.
210.193	There's always vision, 
210.193	but they're considered legally blind.
213.507	So they certainly wouldn't be driving 
213.507	around Paris at night
215.831	shooting at anybody
215.831	and expect to hit anything.
217.971	So I'm thinking, this is crazy.
220.358	So I contact NOAH.
221.852	Now, NOAH is the National Organization 
221.852	for Albinism and Hypopigmentation.
226.753	It's a support group for people 
226.753	living with this condition,
229.229	and their families.
230.575	"And I'm like, ""Hey, I'm a "
230.575	fashion photographer.
232.611	Let's show the world 
232.611	"the beauty of albinism!"""
234.847	"And they said, ""Get lost."""
236.661	And I'm pretty persistent. I'm 
236.661	"like, ""Won't you talk to me?"""
239.003	And they made it very clear to me
240.934	about their fears of exploitation,
243.135	that every time there 
243.135	was a magazine article
244.884	that came out about a kid with albinism,
246.753	it was a story about a victim.
248.46	It was sad, or it was exploitative,
250.915	or sensational — never 
250.915	positive, always negative.
254.316	"And I said, ""Okay, well then, "
254.316	"what do we do here?"""
257.351	So, let's form a nontraditional partnership —
260.067	fashion photographer, 
260.067	genetic support group —
262.685	and we'll work together.
264.092	And you can keep an eye on me
265.15	to make sure that we create 
265.15	something positive and powerful,
268.228	showing the world the beauty of albinism.
270.797	And they said okay.
271.988	And I was like, fantastic, let's do this!
273.694	So in walks the first person 
273.694	I'm about to photograph.
275.834	Her name is Christine, 
275.834	and Christine is a knockout.
279.421	Long white hair, really tall. 
279.421	She's stunning.
282.196	She walks into my studio.
283.968	The way that she walks in, though, 
283.968	instead of this gorgeous girl,
287.005	she walks in like this, her head's down,
289.538	shoulders hunched, one-word answers, 
289.538	she looks down, no eye contact.
294.068	This kid has been teased her whole life 
294.068	because of her difference.
298.02	And it was so apparent in the fact 
298.02	that it left her with zero self-esteem.
303.852	And I'm thinking, oh, this 
303.852	kid is just so fragile.
307.879	And just the day before, 
307.879	I was shooting Cindy
309.752	on the same set, in my studio.
311.801	I'm thinking well, 
311.801	I have to be so careful with her — no,
315.391	out of respect for this gorgeous kid,
317.151	I'm going to photograph her 
317.151	like I would anybody else.
318.983	So the fan went on, the music went on,
321.534	and I grabbed a mirror 
321.534	that was next to the set,
323.075	and I held it up to her, and I said
324.992	Christine, look at yourself. 
324.992	You're magnificent.
329.071	And she looked in the mirror, 
329.071	and she got it.
331.852	And she went from this to that.
334.768	And that's our Christine, 
334.768	and she just exploded in front of the set.
338.48	By the time she left the studio, 
338.48	she was kissing everybody on both cheeks,
342.602	"and saying, ""Ciao!"" "
342.602	and she was unbelievable.
345.602	And I saw this transformation 
345.602	right in front of the lens,
348.799	through photography, 
348.799	that she was now transformed,
351.596	with a powerful and positive sense 
351.596	of who she is.
354.943	The next day, she goes to school,
356.787	she's going to change the way 
356.787	her community sees her difference.
359.847	Instead of walking into 
359.847	that classroom like this,
362.185	she's walking in like this.
363.608	So it's all about ambassadors for change.
366.046	It was extraordinary.
367.104	And those first images, right after,
367.104	we did a series of them,
369.894	using several individuals 
369.894	with this condition,
373.327	they were in Life magazine in 1998.
376.541	So it was a while ago.
377.911	It was a cover story, 
377.911	it was a five-page spread.
380.153	It was really a fantastic editorial.
380.153	It was great; I loved it.
384.325	Then we used a lot of the images, 
384.325	though, from Life,
387.632	and put them in other magazines, 
387.632	magazines worldwide.
390.768	Magazines in the U.K., in France, 
390.768	in Italy and Canada,
394.435	and other magazines in the States.
394.435	It was amazing.
397.237	So this is from the U.K., Christine again.
399.475	Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, 
399.475	and Kristen.
402.351	That's Lauren. 
402.351	We did a campaign for sunglasses.
405.913	A lot of kids with this condition 
405.913	are photophobic,
408.606	so they have 
408.606	a real strong light sensitivity.
411.018	So we thought, 
411.018	perfect for a sunglass campaign.
415.487	People magazine did a great story.
417.518	So it was circulating, 
417.518	people were saying all this great stuff.
420.586	It was fantastic.
422.174	So I was getting calls, though.
423.724	Getting calls from the U.K.,
423.724	saying, well we just saw this spread,
426.428	can you come photograph our 
426.428	kids with this condition?
429.725	We have a support group here, 
429.725	can you come meet our families?
432.253	People in Africa were calling in the same.
434.37	New Zealand, can you help 
434.37	us start a support group?
436.342	I'm like, fantastic! 
436.342	This is great! Let's do it!
439.133	So I would travel in all these places,
441.527	as I was shooting 
441.527	and doing my commercial work,
443.951	I was at a local chapter conference 
443.951	in Philadelphia.
446.436	Small family conference, 
446.436	about 40 families,
448.503	did my presentation of kids with albinism,
450.934	this mom came up to me, and she said,
452.947	"""My son Randy, when he was a little boy,"
455.281	he'd come home from school, 
455.281	and I could see the kids were teasing him,
457.848	and he'd be in tears.
459.225	And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone,
459.225	or a toy truck,
462.313	"and he'd forget about it."""
463.655	"She said, ""Now he's in high school."
463.655	He comes home from school,
466.574	I can see the pain, 
466.574	the anguish in his eyes.
470.018	He walks in, he walks right past me,
472.914	goes up to his room, slams the door,
474.482	and I don't see him until the next day.
476.365	He's not going to want to be photographed,
477.976	he has zero self-esteem,
479.317	this kid has such poor body image,
479.317	and he's just so shy.
484.383	But if you could just show him 
484.383	photographs of kids his own age,
487.852	"so that he knows he's not alone."""
490.068	"I'm like, ""Of course. Where is he? Show me!"""
492.095	She points over to Randy.
493.385	Now Randy's sitting there — 
493.385	his pants are hanging down to here,
495.306	his underwear's hanging out, 
495.306	he has this long, great big shirt,
498.158	he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo.
498.158	He's amazing, this kid.
501.24	I crawl over to Randy.
502.874	"I'm like, ""Randy, "
502.874	I speak to moms and dads every single day,
506.244	terrified about the future 
506.244	of their kids with albinism.
509.484	All they have to do 
509.484	is take one look at you,
511.169	and they're going to be fine.
512.403	Please let me take a photo of you.
513.957	Your mother said, she told me,
515.122	"that you didn't want to be photographed."""
516.848	"He said, ""Rick, "
516.848	what do you mean?
518.685	You have to understand, I'm 16 years old.
521.402	"I don't talk to my mother."""
523.139	"And then he said, ""I want to be photographed."
526.727	I want to show the world that who I am,
528.784	with my albinism, but also 
528.784	"other things about me —"""
530.192	You see how shy he was.
531.686	Very, very shy, Randy.
533.183	But Randy created, 
533.183	early days in this idea,
535.895	of this nonprofit group 
535.895	Positive Exposure,
538.027	the idea of networking stories,
539.549	sharing experiences and the images 
539.549	around the world.
542.939	I'll kind of quickly go through the album.
545.419	I was very interested, at that point,
547.192	getting calls from everybody in the world,
549.251	to find out more about this idea, 
549.251	a message, about albinism,
552.559	or perceptions of people in communities 
552.559	about this syndrome, albinism.
556.795	So I started hearing about stigmas, 
556.795	and discrimination,
560.322	so what I looked at is really trying 
560.322	to explore cultural perceptions
563.695	and attitudes towards this condition.
566.221	This is my friend [unclear], 
566.221	who's a Kuna Indian
568.928	in the San Blas region of the world,
571.268	the San Blas region of Panama.
574.602	She's extraordinary.
576.064	So the incidence of albinism 
576.064	is about one in 20,000 worldwide.
579.618	In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, 
579.618	the highest incidence in the world.
584.858	We went to Fiji, actually, where we 
584.858	found out at the turn of the 19th century,
588.458	a tribe could not hold their territory
590.767	unless they had somebody with albinism 
590.767	in a powerful political position.
595.225	My great friend Keke, 
595.225	I photographed in New Zealand,
598.022	she's from India, from Delhi,
600.769	but her family left Delhi 
600.769	because she was getting death threats.
604.037	Now I'm thinking, 
604.037	this is horrible that they had to move,
606.295	because she's eight years old.
607.733	And we actually started 
607.733	a support group in Delhi,
610.072	we found out that there are many kids
610.072	that we worked with in their communities,
612.946	after we started this group in India,
614.829	that have had really positive experiences.
617.078	So one of the things 
617.078	we want to make very clear
619.137	is that we're not making generalizations
621.099	about a community or a culture,
622.611	and their reaction 
622.611	to people that are different.
624.545	Keke's experiences were very different,
626.235	but we've met many kids there
627.827	that have been embraced 
627.827	by their communities throughout India.
631.209	A great friend Sue Anna from Korea.
635.458	Tom, who was just adopted 
635.458	by an American family, from China,
639.414	This is my great friend 
639.414	Harry from Puerto Rico.
642.685	And Natalia.
643.928	She and I started 
643.928	the first albinism society in Russia.
647.591	Maizan and her sister 
647.591	and mom in Malaysia.
651.726	Ceara. All she ever wanted to do 
651.726	was be a dancer.
654.725	She was told that 
654.725	because of her visual impairment,
656.841	she'll never dance.
658.217	She'll never be able to follow 
658.217	the choreography or the dance steps.
661.283	She's like, they said, 
661.283	find another love, another passion.
665.804	She's like, no.
667.221	She's New Zealand's Celtic dance champion,
669.367	and just started a school for dance 
669.367	for kids with visual impairment.
672.647	I'm going to zip through this. 
672.647	Roz, from Australia.
675.85	I spend a lot of time in Africa,
677.534	where there's a high incidence 
677.534	of mortality associated with albinism,
680.31	due to skin cancer.
681.956	This is my friend Siri, 
681.956	who when she was born,
684.603	the father's family 
684.603	put her out of the house,
686.504	thinking she was cursed.
688.865	and Mom, not knowing what to do,
690.686	put Siri in the sun to get her dark 
690.686	like her brothers and sisters.
693.771	So you can see, it's all sun damage.
696.672	A lot of kids that I met throughout Africa
696.672	were put in special schools,
700.98	schools for the blind,
703.168	not because the tools were better there 
703.168	for kids with visual impairment,
706.237	but more importantly, 
706.237	because the teasing was so great,
708.64	the discrimination is so great,
709.879	these kids don't do well 
709.879	in mainstream schools.
713.218	I started an albinism society in Kenya 
713.218	with my friend C.K.,
716.688	who actually went to a mainstream school.
718.188	I'm like, C.K., how is it possible 
718.188	you went to a mainstream school?
721.092	Nobody in Africa goes 
721.092	to mainstream schools.
722.943	"She said, ""It's because "
722.943	"of my twin sister, Delphine."""
725.383	Fantastic. She said Delphine would get 
725.383	all the work off the board,
729.237	the things I couldn't see, 
729.237	she'd help me with it.
731.627	If the type was too small, 
731.627	she'd blow it up for me, she said.
734.276	But more importantly, 
734.276	when kids would tease me,
736.408	Delphine would beat them up.
738.136	(Laughter)
739.734	But on a sadder note, I was spending 
739.734	a lot of time in Tanzania,
742.093	where witch doctors are saying,
743.28	bring me the bones of an albino,
745.49	and I'll make a potion
745.49	that will make you rich.
747.76	So we're working very closely 
747.76	with the government there,
749.922	I've been there six times 
749.922	in the last two years,
751.638	to create public awareness programs
751.638	to save these kids.
757.862	This is the dancer.
759.711	This is in the Shinyanga region.
761.9	This is one of the visuals 
761.9	that we created in East Africa,
765.739	trying to fight and educate the public.
768.718	I received the Art of Reporting award, 
768.718	from an organization
771.986	called the Chromosome 18 Registry.
774.04	The larger organization 
774.04	was the Genetic Alliance,
777.789	which was a coalition 
777.789	of all the genetic support groups,
779.768	and it was the award 
779.768	for the Life magazine piece.
782.788	The president at the time said,
784.268	I'm also the founder and director
785.637	of the Chromosome 18 Research Society 
785.637	and Registry.
788.346	I'm like, fantastic! 
788.346	That's great. What's that?
790.587	She's like, well, if you have an anomaly 
790.587	on your 18th chromosome,
793.803	then you have all kinds of problems 
793.803	and difficulties and challenges,
797.071	and then we look after you, 
797.071	through this support group, like NOAH is.
800.387	So I'm like, that's great.
802.462	She said, 
802.462	I see there's a universal message here,
804.427	about all kids with differences, 
804.427	so it's not just about albinism.
807.094	Would you come and speak 
807.094	to our families in San Antonio
809.793	with these chromosome 18 anomalies?
811.472	I'm like, sure! 
811.472	I went back to them thinking,
814.102	what the hell is 
814.102	a chromosome 18 anomaly?
815.502	I was an art major
815.502	at the school of visual arts,
816.952	I had no idea.
818.641	But I looked it up, 
818.641	these are the images that I saw.
822.07	I'm thinking, albinism was so easy, 
822.07	this is going to be rough.
824.886	But I went to San Antonio,
826.961	walked down to the auditorium 
826.961	where the kids and young adults were,
829.596	opened the door, 
829.596	and I was instantly surrounded
831.488	by kids screaming with laughter.
832.92	There were kids with cleft palates, 
832.92	kids with mobility issues,
836.404	feeding tubes, trachs, 
836.404	but they were kids, first and foremost.
839.346	That's Rebecca and Pauline.
840.917	My great friend, that's Ellington. 
840.917	He's awesome.
844.593	Remy.
846.247	That's Emory.
848.693	Byron.
850.386	Taylor.
852.248	Elizabeth.
853.795	And my great friend Sean.
855.872	So we decided at that point 
855.872	to involve other organizations
859.733	to be part of this larger exhibition
862.975	that was going to be sent out from 
862.975	the People's Genome Celebration in 2001.
868.187	The National Human Genome Research 
868.187	Institute and the Genetic Alliance
871.435	invited me to create an exhibition 
871.435	at the Smithsonian,
874.476	commemorating the mapping 
874.476	of the human genome.
876.666	So we actually invited 
876.666	other genetic support groups
879.109	to be part of this exhibition, 
879.109	not just on albinism, but all groups,
882.428	again illustrating 
882.428	the universal applicability.
884.874	I saw these images 
884.874	from the Marfan Foundation,
887.102	these kids grow very, very tall, 
887.102	at risk of an aortic dissection,
890.574	but they're amazing kids,
890.574	and I thought, how gorgeous.
892.891	And I understood 
892.891	the importance of this image,
895.811	how important it was 
895.811	to show how beautiful,
897.92	and to show how the image presents itself.
899.919	But isn't there another way to show it?
901.778	Because nobody, and I've photographed 
901.778	thousands of kids now,
903.94	with Marfan Syndrome,
905.022	and nobody stands like this, 
905.022	with a portable black bar.
908.055	It's extraordinary. 
908.055	So we decided to put them in a pool,
910.734	show Billy swimming --
910.734	"[""Bill with Marfan Syndrome""] --"
912.98	show how it presents itself, 
912.98	but keep going,
914.897	and keep presenting how these kids look,
917.574	but put the humanity 
917.574	back in these gorgeous images.
920.481	I only have a few seconds here, 
920.481	so I'm going to go through.
923.709	Cool girls at the Costello Conference.
925.528	These are great friends 
925.528	Danielle and Maggie,
927.628	who actually met 
927.628	at the last Costello Conference.
929.958	For both, the first time they ever met 
929.958	anybody with the same syndrome.
932.87	They go to the same conferences 
932.87	every year and I go and photograph them.
936.701	And this year, 
936.701	they were there again in Florida,
938.187	but this time it's a little different.
940.103	They're gangsters now. (Laughter)
940.103	But they're pretty amazing kids.
943.299	I just want to talk very briefly 
943.299	about this really great kid,
949.55	to talk very briefly about a project 
949.55	that we're taking these images,
953.793	and bringing them into high schools.
955.348	I can photograph a great kid in my studio,
958.068	and she's having a brilliant time, 
958.068	and she feels 10,000 feet tall.
961.267	By the time she leaves my studio 
961.267	and gets to Park Avenue,
965.282	five people point at her, 
965.282	point at her birthmark,
967.583	or at her white hair, or her wheelchair.
970.094	So we have to make it relevant 
970.094	for all of us, for all these kids,
973.213	to make people understand what the idea 
973.213	of celebrating diversity actually means.
977.606	So we started a project 
977.606	called the PEARLS Project,
979.512	where these photographs 
979.512	are going into high schools,
981.986	and the kids that are in the images 
981.986	are blogging,
984.333	and the students
984.333	are following their blogs.
986.46	And they all have 
986.46	these great video intros.
988.329	I just want to give you this last one, 
988.329	and this is actually Byron,
990.885	who is actually one of our bloggers.
992.997	(Video) Byron: Hi, my name is Byron.
994.899	I live in the D.C. area. I'm 14.
997.601	When I was 10 months old,
999.339	I had a left hemispherectomy.
1002.375	I had the left half of my brain removed,
1006.277	because I have something 
1006.277	called Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
1011.063	I wear a brace
1011.063	on my right leg and right arm.
1015.835	I only see out of 
1015.835	the right side of each eye,
1019.394	so sometimes it's harder 
1019.394	for me to see things on the right side.
1026.875	So playing sports can be frustrating, 
1026.875	because I might not see a ball coming.
1039.122	I didn't see that coming. Excuse me.
1042.224	Rick Guidotti: So we're using 
1042.224	all the visual art
1045.7	to change public perceptions 
1045.7	through these great kids.
1048.454	I feel as an artist, 
1048.454	it's my responsibility.
1050.751	I know that when I was a kid,
1051.992	and I saw someone that was different 
1051.992	walking down the street,
1054.553	If I stared, I got slapped by my mom.
1056.846	So the idea was
1056.846	if you don't stare, look away.
1060.3	And I think as an artist, 
1060.3	it's my responsibility,
1062.317	and all of our responsibilities,
1064.004	to steady that gaze a little bit longer.
1066.242	Because you stand there, 
1066.242	and you'll see a difference.
1069.543	You'll start seeing beauty 
1069.543	in that difference.
1071.979	And you'll start seeing 
1071.979	beautiful gorgeousness,
1074.072	and then this light just spreads, 
1074.072	and once you're enlightened,
1077.059	it just changes your whole world.
1078.736	It's about seeing 
1078.736	the beauty in all differences.
1081.186	Thank you so much, I'm sorry I ran over.
1082.667	Thank you guys, thank you.
