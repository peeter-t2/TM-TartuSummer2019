17.029	So, why does good sex so often fade,
20.132	even for couples who continue
20.132	to love each other as much as ever?
24.986	And why does good intimacy
24.986	not guarantee good sex,
27.79	contrary to popular belief?
30.963	Or, the next question would be,
32.615	can we want what we already have?
35.188	That's the million-dollar question, right?
37.901	And why is the forbidden so erotic?
39.614	What is it about transgression
39.614	that makes desire so potent?
43.913	And why does sex make babies,
45.362	and babies spell erotic
45.362	disaster in couples?
47.996	(Laughter)
49.627	It's kind of the fatal
49.627	erotic blow, isn't it?
52.274	And when you love, how does it feel?
54.611	And when you desire, how is it different?
57.885	These are some of the questions
59.432	that are at the center of my exploration
59.432	on the nature of erotic desire
64.922	and its concomitant
64.922	dilemmas in modern love.
68.77	So I travel the globe,
70.344	and what I'm noticing is that everywhere
70.344	where romanticism has entered,
75.727	there seems to be a crisis of desire.
78.9	A crisis of desire,
78.9	as in owning the wanting --
83.42	desire as an expression
83.42	of our individuality,
86.43	of our free choice,
86.43	of our preferences, of our identity --
90.419	desire that has become a central concept
93.745	as part of modern love
93.745	and individualistic societies.
96.969	You know, this is the first time
96.969	in the history of humankind
100.21	where we are trying to experience
100.21	sexuality in the long term
106.64	not because we want 14 children,
110.026	for which we need to have even more
110.026	because many of them won't make it,
114.222	and not because it is exclusively
114.222	a woman's marital duty.
118.391	This is the first time
118.391	that we want sex over time
123.19	about pleasure and connection
123.19	that is rooted in desire.
127.69	So what sustains desire,
127.69	and why is it so difficult?
131.515	And at the heart of sustaining
131.515	desire in a committed relationship,
136.347	I think, is the reconciliation
136.347	of two fundamental human needs.
141.954	On the one hand, our need
141.954	for security, for predictability,
147.116	for safety, for dependability,
151.035	for reliability, for permanence.
154.508	All these anchoring,
154.508	grounding experiences of our lives
157.626	that we call home.
159.596	But we also have an equally
159.596	strong need -- men and women --
163.728	for adventure, for novelty,
166.177	for mystery, for risk, for danger,
169.312	for the unknown,
169.312	for the unexpected, surprise --
172.602	you get the gist.
174.533	For journey, for travel.
176.508	So reconciling our need for security
176.508	and our need for adventure
180.057	into one relationship,
181.631	or what we today like to call
181.631	a passionate marriage,
184.514	used to be a contradiction in terms.
187.208	Marriage was an economic institution
190.51	in which you were
190.51	given a partnership for life
193.572	in terms of children and social status
196.316	and succession and companionship.
199.123	But now we want our partner
199.123	to still give us all these things,
203.152	but in addition I want you
203.152	to be my best friend
205.604	and my trusted confidant
205.604	and my passionate lover to boot,
208.838	and we live twice as long.
210.242	(Laughter)
213.162	So we come to one person,
213.162	and we basically are asking them
217.166	to give us what once
217.166	an entire village used to provide.
220.789	Give me belonging, give me identity,
223.394	give me continuity,
224.733	but give me transcendence
224.733	and mystery and awe all in one.
228.79	Give me comfort, give me edge.
230.423	Give me novelty, give me familiarity.
232.345	Give me predictability, give me surprise.
234.635	And we think it's a given,
236.008	and toys and lingerie
236.008	are going to save us with that.
238.633	(Laughter)
240.558	(Applause)
244.527	So now we get to the existential
244.527	reality of the story, right?
248.71	Because I think, in some way --
252.442	and I'll come back to that --
254.123	but the crisis of desire
254.123	is often a crisis of the imagination.
257.574	So why does good sex so often fade?
261.197	What is the relationship
261.197	between love and desire?
263.745	How do they relate,
263.745	and how do they conflict?
267.026	Because therein lies
267.026	the mystery of eroticism.
270.082	So if there is a verb, for me,
270.082	"that comes with love, it's ""to have."""
274.353	And if there is a verb that comes
274.353	"with desire, it is ""to want."""
278.726	In love, we want to have,
278.726	we want to know the beloved.
282.527	We want to minimize the distance.
284.833	We want to contract that gap.
286.813	We want to neutralize the tensions.
289.109	We want closeness.
291.031	But in desire,
292.451	we tend to not really want to go back
292.451	to the places we've already gone.
296.266	Forgone conclusion
296.266	does not keep our interest.
299.92	In desire, we want an Other,
302.149	somebody on the other side
302.149	that we can go visit,
305.198	that we can go spend some time with,
307.38	that we can go see what goes on
307.38	in their red-light district.
311.135	You know?
312.16	In desire, we want a bridge to cross.
314.553	Or in other words,
314.553	I sometimes say, fire needs air.
317.928	Desire needs space.
320.249	And when it's said like that,
320.249	it's often quite abstract.
323.727	But then I took a question with me.
325.418	And I've gone to more than 20 countries
325.418	in the last few years
328.347	"with ""Mating in Captivity,"""
328.347	and I asked people,
330.735	when do you find yourself
330.735	most drawn to your partner?
333.891	Not attracted sexually,
333.891	per Se, but most drawn.
337.353	And across culture, across religion,
337.353	and across gender -- except for one --
341.788	there are a few answers
341.788	that just keep coming back.
346.103	So the first group is:
347.96	I am most drawn to my partner
347.96	when she is away,
353.175	when we are apart, when we reunite.
357.317	Basically, when I get back in touch
360.777	with my ability to imagine myself
360.777	with my partner,
364.488	when my imagination comes
364.488	back in the picture,
367.57	and when I can root it
367.57	in absence and in longing,
372.234	which is a major component of desire.
374.995	But then the second group
374.995	is even more interesting.
378.182	I am most drawn to my partner
379.867	when I see him in the studio,
382.413	when she is onstage,
383.984	when he is in his element,
385.684	when she's doing something
385.684	she's passionate about,
388.222	when I see him at a party
388.222	and other people are really drawn to him,
391.627	when I see her hold court.
393.881	Basically, when I look at my partner
393.881	radiant and confident.
398.279	Probably the biggest
398.279	turn-on across the board.
401.552	Radiant, as in self-sustaining.
404.213	I look at this person --
404.213	by the way, in desire
407.23	people rarely talk about it,
407.23	when we are blended into one,
410.007	five centimeters from each other.
411.651	I don't know in inches how much that is.
413.586	But it's also not when the other person
413.586	is that far apart
416.501	that you no longer see them.
418.261	It's when I'm looking at my partner
418.261	from a comfortable distance,
422.285	where this person that is already
422.285	so familiar, so known,
426.634	is momentarily once again
426.634	somewhat mysterious, somewhat elusive.
431.582	And in this space between me
431.582	and the other lies the erotic Ã©lan,
436.328	lies that movement toward the other.
438.921	Because sometimes, as Proust says,
441.084	mystery is not
441.084	about traveling to new places,
443.759	but it's about looking with new eyes.
445.938	And so, when I see my partner
445.938	on his own or her own,
449.791	doing something
449.791	in which they are enveloped,
452.624	I look at this person and I momentarily
452.624	get a shift in perception,
457.039	and I stay open to the mysteries
457.039	that are living right next to me.
462.311	And then, more importantly,
462.311	in this description about the other
467.055	or myself -- it's the same --
468.905	what is most interesting
468.905	is that there is no neediness in desire.
472.986	Nobody needs anybody.
475.314	There is no caretaking in desire.
477.796	Caretaking is mightily loving.
479.964	It's a powerful anti-aphrodisiac.
481.692	(Laughter)
482.717	I have yet to see somebody
482.717	who is so turned on
485.07	by somebody who needs them.
486.772	Wanting them is one thing.
488.512	Needing them is a shot down
490.265	and women have known that forever,
492.166	because anything
492.166	that will bring up parenthood
494.773	will usually decrease the erotic charge.
497.136	(Laughter)
498.373	For good reasons, right?
500.113	And then the third group
500.113	of answers usually would be:
503.366	when I'm surprised,
503.366	when we laugh together,
507.786	as somebody said to me
507.786	in the office today,
510.071	when he's in his tux, so I said, you know,
512.095	it's either the tux or the cowboy boots.
515.227	But basically it's when there is novelty.
518.633	But novelty isn't about new positions.
521.469	It isn't a repertoire of techniques.
523.424	Novelty is, what parts
523.424	of you do you bring out?
526.669	What parts of you are just being seen?
529.475	Because in some way one could say
529.475	sex isn't something you do, eh?
533.417	Sex is a place you go.
535.142	It's a space you enter
536.651	inside yourself
536.651	and with another, or others.
540.197	So where do you go in sex?
542.395	What parts of you do you connect to?
544.871	What do you seek to express there?
547.07	Is it a place for transcendence
547.07	and spiritual union?
550.26	Is it a place for naughtiness
550.26	and is it a place to be safely aggressive?
554.587	Is it a place where you
554.587	can finally surrender
556.931	and not have to take
556.931	responsibility for everything?
560.099	Is it a place where you can
560.099	express your infantile wishes?
563.075	What comes out there? It's a language.
565.355	It isn't just a behavior.
567.781	And it's the poetic of that language
567.781	that I'm interested in,
570.667	which is why I began to explore
570.667	this concept of erotic intelligence.
574.786	You know, animals have sex.
576.826	It's the pivot, it's biology,
576.826	it's the natural instinct.
580.36	We are the only ones
580.36	who have an erotic life,
583.614	which means that it's sexuality
583.614	transformed by the human imagination.
589.716	We are the only ones
589.716	who can make love for hours,
593.026	have a blissful time, multiple orgasms,
595.898	and touch nobody,
595.898	just because we can imagine it.
599.833	We can hint at it.
599.833	We don't even have to do it.
602.651	We can experience that powerful
602.651	thing called anticipation,
606.145	which is a mortar to desire.
608.593	The ability to imagine it,
608.593	as if it's happening,
612.236	to experience it as if it's happening,
614.634	while nothing is happening
616.144	and everything is happening,
616.144	at the same time.
618.829	So when I began to think about eroticism,
621.359	I began to think about the poetics of sex.
624.708	And if I look at it as an intelligence,
627.04	then it's something that you cultivate.
629.237	What are the ingredients?
630.809	Imagination, playfulness,
633.48	novelty, curiosity, mystery.
637.044	But the central agent is really
637.044	that piece called the imagination.
641.827	But more importantly,
641.827	for me to begin to understand
644.986	who are the couples
644.986	who have an erotic spark,
647.582	what sustains desire,
649.408	I had to go back
649.408	to the original definition of eroticism,
652.822	the mystical definition,
654.679	and I went through it
654.679	through a bifurcation
656.79	by looking, actually, at trauma,
658.912	which is the other side.
660.703	And I looked at it,
661.928	looking at the community
661.928	that I had grown up in,
664.282	which was a community in Belgium,
664.282	all Holocaust survivors,
668.12	and in my community,
668.12	there were two groups:
670.75	those who didn't die,
670.75	and those who came back to life.
674.676	And those who didn't die lived
674.676	often very tethered to the ground,
677.961	could not experience
677.961	pleasure, could not trust,
681.476	because when you're vigilant,
681.476	worried, anxious, and insecure,
685.501	you can't lift your head
685.501	to go and take off in space
689.064	and be playful and safe and imaginative.
692.498	Those who came back to life
694.315	were those who understood
694.315	the erotic as an antidote to death.
697.625	They knew how to keep themselves alive.
701.201	And when I began to listen
702.775	to the sexlessness
702.775	of the couples that I work with,
705.305	I sometimes would hear people
705.305	"say, ""I want more sex,"""
708.273	but generally, people want better sex,
710.826	and better is to reconnect
710.826	with that quality of aliveness,
714.08	of vibrancy, of renewal, of vitality,
716.883	of Eros, of energy
718.508	that sex used to afford them,
720.203	or that they've hoped
720.203	it would afford them.
722.901	And so I began to ask
722.901	a different question.
726.171	"""I shut myself off when ..."""
726.171	began to be the question.
730.551	"""I turn off my desires when ..."""
732.565	Which is not the same question as,
734.258	"""What turns me off is ..."""
734.258	"and ""You turn me off when ..."""
738.111	And people began to say,
738.111	"""I turn myself off when"
741.292	I feel dead inside,
741.292	when I don't like my body,
744.197	when I feel old,
745.466	when I haven't had time for myself,
747.213	when I haven't had a chance
747.213	to even check in with you,
749.837	when I don't perform well at work,
751.581	when I feel low self esteem,
753.03	when I don't have a sense of self-worth,
755.021	when I don't feel like I have
755.021	a right to want, to take,
757.9	"to receive pleasure."""
760.424	And then I began to ask
760.424	the reverse question.
762.59	"""I turn myself on when ..."""
764.424	Because most of the time,
764.424	people like to ask the question,
767.249	"""You turn me on, what turns me on,"""
769.459	and I'm out of the question, you know?
771.732	Now, if you are dead inside,
773.363	the other person can do
773.363	a lot of things for Valentine's.
776.108	It won't make a dent.
776.108	There is nobody at the reception desk.
779.037	(Laughter)
780.335	So I turn myself on when,
782.737	I turn on my desires, I wake up when ...
786.748	Now, in this paradox
786.748	between love and desire,
791.366	what seems to be so puzzling
793.492	is that the very ingredients
793.492	that nurture love --
797.385	mutuality, reciprocity,
799.834	protection, worry,
799.834	responsibility for the other --
803.595	are sometimes the very ingredients
803.595	that stifle desire.
807.69	Because desire comes
807.69	with a host of feelings
811.782	that are not always
811.782	such favorites of love:
815.66	jealousy, possessiveness,
817.453	aggression, power, dominance,
820.025	naughtiness, mischief.
821.803	Basically most of us will get turned on
821.803	at night by the very same things
826.115	that we will demonstrate
826.115	against during the day.
828.865	You know, the erotic mind
828.865	is not very politically correct.
832.164	If everybody was fantasizing
832.164	on a bed of roses,
834.82	we wouldn't be having such
834.82	interesting talks about this.
837.468	(Laughter)
838.493	But no, in our mind up there
838.493	are a host of things going on
843.85	that we don't always know
843.85	how to bring to the person that we love,
847.017	because we think love
847.017	comes with selflessness
849.972	and in fact desire comes
849.972	with a certain amount of selfishness
853.542	in the best sense of the word:
855.519	the ability to stay connected
855.519	to one's self in the presence of another.
860.335	So I want to draw
860.335	that little image for you,
862.897	because this need to reconcile
862.897	these two sets of needs,
866.606	we are born with that.
868.15	Our need for connection,
868.15	our need for separateness,
871.046	or our need for security and adventure,
873.255	or our need for togetherness
873.255	and for autonomy,
876.109	and if you think about the little kid
876.109	who sits on your lap
879.284	and who is cozily nested here
879.284	and very secure and comfortable,
883.187	and at some point all of us
883.187	need to go out into the world
887.453	to discover and to explore.
889.596	That's the beginning of desire,
891.454	that exploratory need,
891.454	curiosity, discovery.
896.454	And then at some point they turn
896.454	around and they look at you.
900.2	And if you tell them,
901.973	"""Hey kiddo, the world's a great place."
903.994	"Go for it. There's so much fun out there,"""
906.143	then they can turn away
906.143	and they can experience
908.693	connection and separateness
908.693	at the same time.
910.898	They can go off in their imagination,
910.898	off in their body,
914.712	off in their playfulness,
916.364	all the while knowing that there's
916.364	somebody when they come back.
919.879	But if on this side
919.879	there is somebody who says,
922.316	"""I'm worried. I'm anxious. I'm depressed."
925.896	My partner hasn't taken care
925.896	of me in so long.
928.175	What's so good out there?
929.547	Don't we have everything
929.547	"you need together, you and I?"""
932.693	then there are a few little reactions
934.806	that all of us can pretty much recognize.
938.219	Some of us will come back,
941.149	came back a long time ago,
942.926	and that little child who comes back
945.335	is the child who will forgo
945.335	a part of himself
948.288	in order not to lose the other.
950.431	I will lose my freedom
950.431	in order not to lose connection.
954.445	And I will learn to love in a certain way
957.35	that will become burdened with extra worry
961.19	and extra responsibility
961.19	and extra protection,
964.734	and I won't know how to leave you
967.198	in order to go play,
967.198	in order to go experience pleasure,
970.742	in order to discover,
970.742	to enter inside myself.
973.982	Translate this into adult language.
976.866	It starts very young.
978.379	It continues into our sex lives
978.379	up to the end.
982.127	Child number two comes back
984.521	but looks like that
984.521	over their shoulder all the time.
987.587	"""Are you going to be there?"
989.366	Are you going to curse me, scold me?
991.462	"Are you going to be angry with me?"""
993.243	And they may be gone,
993.243	but they're never really away.
996.862	And those are often the people
996.862	that will tell you,
999.267	"""In the beginning, it was super hot."""
1001.393	Because in the beginning,
1003.57	the growing intimacy wasn't yet so strong
1006.922	that it actually led
1006.922	to the decrease of desire.
1009.815	The more connected I became,
1009.815	the more responsible I felt,
1013.843	the less I was able to let go
1013.843	in your presence.
1016.966	The third child doesn't really come back.
1019.606	So what happens,
1019.606	if you want to sustain desire,
1023.038	it's that real dialectic piece.
1025.278	On the one hand you want the security
1025.278	in order to be able to go.
1028.959	On the other hand if you can't go,
1028.959	you can't have pleasure,
1032.711	you can't culminate,
1032.711	you don't have an orgasm,
1035.755	you don't get excited
1035.755	because you spend your time
1038.174	in the body and the head
1038.174	of the other and not in your own.
1041.612	So in this dilemma about reconciling
1041.612	these two sets of fundamental needs,
1047.676	there are a few things that I've come
1047.676	to understand erotic couples do.
1051.849	One, they have a lot of sexual privacy.
1054.826	They understand
1054.826	that there is an erotic space
1057.332	that belongs to each of them.
1059.383	They also understand
1059.383	that foreplay is not something you do
1062.542	five minutes before the real thing.
1064.75	Foreplay pretty much starts
1064.75	at the end of the previous orgasm.
1068.293	They also understand
1068.293	that an erotic space isn't about,
1071.849	you begin to stroke the other.
1073.404	It's about you create a space
1073.404	where you leave Management Inc.,
1076.81	maybe where you leave the Agile program --
1079.469	(Laughter)
1082.177	And you actually just enter that place
1082.177	where you stop being the good citizen
1086.453	who is taking care of things
1086.453	and being responsible.
1089.117	Responsibility and desire just butt heads.
1092.661	They don't really do well together.
1095.49	Erotic couples also understand
1095.49	that passion waxes and wanes.
1099.492	It's pretty much like the moon.
1101.316	It has intermittent eclipses.
1103.061	But what they know
1103.061	is they know how to resurrect it.
1105.684	They know how to bring it back.
1107.376	And they know how to bring it back
1109.02	because they have
1109.02	demystified one big myth,
1111.406	which is the myth of spontaneity,
1113.779	which is that it's just going
1113.779	to fall from heaven
1116.21	while you're folding the laundry
1116.21	like a deus ex machina,
1119.192	and in fact they understood
1121.161	that whatever is going to just happen
1121.161	in a long-term relationship, already has.
1126.327	Committed sex is premeditated sex.
1129.113	It's willful. It's intentional.
1132.43	It's focus and presence.
1135.374	Merry Valentine's.
1136.518	(Applause)
