15.26	When I go to parties,
16.835	it doesn't usually take very long
18.619	for people to find out
19.659	that I'm a scientist and I study sex.
22.767	And then I get asked questions.
27.668	And the questions usually have a very particular format.
30.835	They start with the phrase,
32.067	"""A friend told me,"""
33.968	and then they end with the phrase,
35.868	"""Is this true?"""
37.785	And most of the time
39.171	I'm glad to say that I can answer them,
41.29	but sometimes I have to say,
43.137	"""I'm really sorry,"
44.27	but I don't know
45.454	"because I'm not that kind of a doctor."""
48.538	That is, I'm not a clinician,
50.454	I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.
53.645	And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals
56.578	and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work
59.895	when everything's going right,
61.396	rather than trying to figure out
63.014	how to fix things when they go wrong,
64.597	like so many of you.
65.798	And what I do is I look for similarities and differences
68.197	in the solutions that they've evolved
70.464	for fundamental biological problems.
72.048	So today I'm here to argue
73.897	that this is not at all
77.763	an esoteric Ivory Tower activity
79.664	that we find at our universities,
80.981	but that broad study
82.964	across species, tissue types and organ systems
85.916	can produce insights
87.551	that have direct implications for human health.
90.935	And this is true both of my recent project
93.433	on sex differences in the brain,
95.157	and my more mature work
97.076	on the anatomy and function of penises.
99.91	And now you know why I'm fun at parties.
102.54	(Laughter)
103.508	So today I'm going to give you an example
105.791	drawn from my penis study
107.508	to show you how knowledge
109.125	drawn from studies of one organ system
110.892	provided insights into a very different one.
113.873	Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows --
116.891	I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week --
120.407	penises are structures that transfer sperm
124.158	from one individual to another.
125.458	And the slide behind me
126.958	barely scratches the surface
128.691	of how widespread they are in animals.
130.656	There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.
132.641	You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,
136.515	as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder
140.361	that we're all familiar with --
141.996	or at least half of you are.
144.278	(Laughter)
146.679	And I think we see this tremendous variation
149.417	because it's a really effective solution
152.568	to a very basic biological problem,
154.734	and that is getting sperm in a position
157.217	to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.
159.769	Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,
163.718	but when internal fertilization evolves,
166.184	penises often follow.
168.184	And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,
172.601	"""What made you interested in this subject?"""
175.517	And the answer is skeletons.
179.467	You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises
182.034	have very much to do with one another.
183.885	And that's because we tend to think of skeletons
186.017	as stiff lever systems
187.667	that produce speed or power.
189.35	And my first forays into biological research,
192.917	doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,
195.735	were really squarely in that realm.
197.286	But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,
200.403	I really wanted to find a dissertation project
202.868	that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.
205.767	I tried a bunch of different stuff.
207.569	A lot of it didn't pan out.
209.217	But then one day I started thinking
211.051	about the mammalian penis.
212.833	And it's really an odd sort of structure.
216.851	Before it can be used for internal fertilization,
219.668	its mechanical behavior has to change
221.151	in a really dramatic fashion.
222.868	Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
225.466	It's easy to bend.
226.75	But before it's brought into use
228.744	during copulation
229.962	it has to become rigid,
231.72	it has to become difficult to bend.
233.735	And moreover, it has to work.
235.752	A reproductive system that fails to function
238.502	produces an individual that has no offspring,
241.817	and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.
244.988	"And so I thought, ""Here's a problem"
247.449	that just cries out for a skeletal system --
250.697	not one like this one,
253.909	but one like this one --
256.966	because, functionally,
259.383	a skeleton is any system
260.95	that supports tissue and transmits forces.
263.982	And I already knew that animals like this earthworm,
266.332	indeed most animals,
267.778	don't support their tissues
269.071	by draping them over bones.
270.865	Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.
273.698	They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.
277.565	And a hydrostatic skeleton
279.631	uses two elements.
281.549	The skeletal support comes from an interaction
283.699	between a pressurized fluid
285.473	and a surrounding wall of tissue
287.079	that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.
291.55	And the interaction is crucial.
293.798	Without both elements you have no support.
297.166	If you have fluid
298.448	with no wall to surround it
300.482	and keep pressure up,
301.916	you have a puddle.
303.82	And if you have just the wall
305.92	with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,
307.654	you've got a little wet rag.
309.604	When you look at a penis in cross section,
312.236	it has a lot of the hallmarks
314.669	of a hydrostatic skeleton.
316.719	It has a central space
318.228	of spongy erectile tissue
319.748	that fills with fluid -- in this case blood --
322.326	surrounded by a wall of tissue
324.725	that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.
328.576	But at the time when I started this project,
331.076	the best explanation I could find for penal erection
334.277	was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,
338.561	and the spongy tissues filled with blood
340.26	and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.
343.528	And that explained to me expansion --
347.493	made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand --
351.06	but it didn't actually explain erection.
354.077	Because there was no mechanism in this explanation
357.968	for making this structure hard to bend.
360.935	And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.
363.651	So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.
366.253	It has to be part of the explanation.
368.619	And this was the point
371.154	at which my graduate adviser said,
373.751	"""Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."""
377.134	Because after about six months of me talking about this,
380.502	I think he finally figured out
381.818	that I was really serious about the penis thing.
384.867	(Laughter)
387.914	So he sat me down, and he warned me.
389.963	"He was like, ""Be careful going down this path."
392.139	"I'm not sure this project's going to pan out."""
394.906	Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap.
397.438	I was taking on a socially embarrassing question
402.255	with an answer that he thought
404.59	might not be particularly interesting.
406.972	And that was because
408.505	every hydrostatic skeleton
410.023	that we had found in nature up to that point
412.091	had the same basic elements.
413.888	It had the central fluid,
415.105	it had the surrounding wall,
416.905	and the reinforcing fibers in the wall
420.041	were arranged in crossed helices
422.459	around the long axis of the skeleton.
424.516	So the image behind me
425.837	shows a piece of tissue
427.466	in one of these cross helical skeletons
429.491	cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.
432.024	The arrow shows you the long axis.
433.742	And you can see two layers of fibers,
435.592	one in blue and one in yellow,
437.293	arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.
440.091	And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,
442.34	those fibers would be going in helices
445.041	around the long axis of the skeleton --
446.791	something like a Chinese finger trap,
448.924	where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.
450.825	And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,
453.908	which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.
455.94	It's a model skeleton
457.091	that I made out of a piece of cloth
459.274	that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.
461.827	The cloth's cut on the bias.
463.525	So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,
466.274	and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,
470.586	which means the skeleton's flexible.
472.015	It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily
474.488	in response to internal or external forces.
478.035	Now my adviser's concern
479.331	was what if the penile wall tissue
481.697	is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.
483.371	What are you going to contribute?
485.298	What new thing are you contributing
486.765	to our knowledge of biology?
488.413	"And I thought, ""Yeah, he does have a really good point here."""
491.831	So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
493.581	And one thing kept bothering me,
495.715	and that's, when they're functioning,
498.165	penises don't wiggle.
500.098	(Laughter)
502.437	So something interesting had to be going on.
505.338	So I went ahead, collected wall tissue,
508.639	prepared it so it was erect,
510.238	sectioned it, put it on slides
512.437	and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,
515.089	fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
520.125	But instead I saw this.
522.523	There's an outer layer and an inner layer.
525.524	The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.
528.074	I was really surprised at this.
530.643	Everyone I showed it
531.588	was really surprised at this.
532.788	Why was everyone surprised at this?
534.325	That's because we knew theoretically
537.309	that there was another way
540.124	of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,
543.158	and that was with fibers at zero degrees
545.429	and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.
549.295	The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.
552.857	And now I was looking at one.
555.557	Those fibers in that particular orientation
558.291	give the skeleton a very, very different behavior.
561.506	I'm going to show a model
562.691	made out of exactly the same materials.
564.636	So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,
566.694	same balloon, same internal pressure.
569.983	But the only difference
572.45	is that the fibers are arranged differently.
574.832	And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,
577.483	this model resists extension and contraction
580.433	and resists bending.
581.884	Now what that tells us
582.918	is that wall tissues are doing so much more
585.014	than just covering the vascular tissues.
587.517	They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
591.011	If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,
593.548	if it wasn't reinforced in this way,
595.713	the shape would change,
596.865	but the inflated penis would not resist bending,
599.249	and erection simply wouldn't work.
601.296	It's an observation with obvious medical applications
603.897	in humans as well,
605.679	but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,
608.614	to the design of prosthetics, soft robots,
611.046	basically anything
612.113	where changes of shape and stiffness are important.
615.431	So to sum up:
617.179	Twenty years ago,
618.396	I had a college adviser tell me,
620.146	when I went to the college and said,
622.197	"""I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"""
623.346	"they said, ""Anatomy's a dead science."""
625.23	He couldn't have been more wrong.
627.847	I really believe that we still have a lot to learn
630.58	about the normal structure and function of our bodies.
633.713	Not just about its genetics and molecular biology,
636.527	but up here in the meat end of the scale.
639.926	We've got limits on our time.
641.361	We often focus on one disease,
643.626	one model, one problem,
644.81	but my experience suggests
646.384	that we should take the time
648.162	to apply ideas broadly between systems
650.727	and just see where it takes us.
652.601	After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons
656.201	can give us insights
657.667	about mammalian reproductive systems,
659.752	there could be lots of other wild and productive connections
663.801	lurking out there just waiting to be found.
666.25	Thank you.
668.102	(Applause)
