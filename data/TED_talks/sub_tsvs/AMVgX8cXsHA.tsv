12.94	"""These are the times,"""
15.26	said Thomas Paine,
17.3	"""that try men's souls."""
19.98	And they're trying ours now.
21.46	This is a fateful moment
21.46	in the history of the West.
25.66	We've seen divisive elections
25.66	and divided societies.
31.18	We've seen a growth of extremism
33.74	in politics and religion,
36.54	all of it fueled by anxiety,
36.54	uncertainty and fear,
40.98	of a world that's changing
40.98	almost faster than we can bear,
46.3	and the sure knowledge
46.3	that it's going to change faster still.
51.26	I have a friend in Washington.
52.74	I asked him, what was it like
52.74	being in America
54.94	during the recent presidential election?
58.7	"He said to me, ""Well,"
60.7	it was like the man
63.5	sitting on the deck of the Titanic
66.54	with a glass of whiskey in his hand
70.14	and he's saying,
70.14	'I know I asked for ice --
73.94	(Laughter)
79.5	"but this is ridiculous.'"""
83.38	So is there something we can do,
86.82	each of us,
89.18	to be able to face
89.18	the future without fear?
92.06	I think there is.
94.62	And one way into it is to see
96.82	that perhaps the most simple way
96.82	into a culture and into an age
102.74	is to ask: What do people worship?
105.74	People have worshipped
105.74	so many different things --
108.26	the sun, the stars, the storm.
110.66	Some people worship many gods,
110.66	some one, some none.
114.66	In the 19th and 20th centuries,
117.54	people worshipped the nation,
119.74	the Aryan race, the communist state.
122.22	What do we worship?
125.26	I think future anthropologists
128.22	will take a look at the books we read
131.14	on self-help, self-realization,
134.26	self-esteem.
136.22	They'll look at the way
136.22	we talk about morality
139.06	as being true to oneself,
141.26	the way we talk about politics
143.7	as a matter of individual rights,
146.5	and they'll look at this wonderful
146.5	new religious ritual we have created.
151.86	You know the one?
153.66	"Called the ""selfie."""
156.26	And I think they'll conclude
156.26	that what we worship in our time
159.9	is the self, the me, the I.
163.5	And this is great.
165.42	It's liberating.
165.42	It's empowering. It's wonderful.
169.34	But don't forget that biologically,
169.34	we're social animals.
175.02	We've spent most
175.02	of our evolutionary history
178.66	in small groups.
180.54	We need those face-to-face interactions
184.26	where we learn
184.26	the choreography of altruism
188.7	and where we create those spiritual goods
191.78	like friendship and trust
191.78	and loyalty and love
196.02	that redeem our solitude.
199.38	"When we have too much of the ""I"""
199.38	"and too little of the ""we,"""
203.34	we can find ourselves vulnerable,
206.22	fearful and alone.
208.9	It was no accident
208.9	that Sherry Turkle of MIT
211.9	called the book she wrote
211.9	on the impact of social media
215.02	"""Alone Together."""
218.22	So I think the simplest way
218.22	"of safeguarding the future ""you"""
223.26	"is to strengthen the future ""us"""
226.34	in three dimensions:
227.62	the us of relationship,
229.66	the us of identity
231.94	and the us of responsibility.
233.7	So let me first
233.7	take the us of relationship.
236.3	And here, forgive me if I get personal.
239.22	Once upon a time,
241.62	a very long time ago,
244.1	I was a 20-year-old undergraduate
246.78	studying philosophy.
248.46	I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer
248.46	and Sartre and Camus.
252.34	I was full of ontological uncertainty
256.74	and existential angst.
258.3	It was terrific.
260.1	(Laughter)
261.9	I was self-obsessed
261.9	and thoroughly unpleasant to know,
265.14	until one day I saw
267.74	across the courtyard
269.899	a girl
271.3	who was everything that I wasn't.
274.9	She radiated sunshine.
276.94	She emanated joy.
280.5	I found out her name was Elaine.
282.42	We met. We talked.
283.9	We married.
285.34	And 47 years, three children
285.34	and eight grandchildren later,
289.7	I can safely say
291.26	it was the best decision
291.26	I ever took in my life,
294.22	because it's the people not like us
297.86	that make us grow.
300.22	And that is why I think
303.26	we have to do just that.
305.86	The trouble with Google filters,
307.98	Facebook friends
309.94	and reading the news by narrowcasting
309.94	rather than broadcasting
313.7	means that we're surrounded
313.7	almost entirely by people like us
318.54	whose views, whose opinions,
318.54	whose prejudices, even,
322.06	are just like ours.
324.02	And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown
326.74	that if we surround ourselves
326.74	with people with the same views as us,
331.14	we get more extreme.
334.26	I think we need to renew
334.26	those face-to-face encounters
338.06	with the people not like us.
341.1	I think we need to do that
343.22	in order to realize
343.22	that we can disagree strongly
347.3	and yet still stay friends.
350.62	It's in those face-to-face encounters
352.74	that we discover
352.74	that the people not like us
356.74	are just people, like us.
360.62	And actually, every time
363.46	we hold out the hand of friendship
365.78	to somebody not like us,
367.82	whose class or creed
367.82	or color are different from ours,
373.86	we heal
375.58	one of the fractures
377.22	of our wounded world.
379.02	That is the us of relationship.
381.94	Second is the us of identity.
385.22	Let me give you a thought experiment.
388.06	Have you been to Washington?
388.06	Have you seen the memorials?
390.78	Absolutely fascinating.
392.5	There's the Lincoln Memorial:
394.14	Gettysburg Address on one side,
394.14	Second Inaugural on the other.
398.58	You go to the Jefferson Memorial,
400.34	screeds of text.
402.3	Martin Luther King Memorial,
404.34	more than a dozen quotes
404.34	from his speeches.
406.78	I didn't realize,
406.78	in America you read memorials.
411.62	Now go to the equivalent
411.62	in London in Parliament Square
415.54	and you will see that the monument
415.54	to David Lloyd George
418.94	contains three words:
420.98	David Lloyd George.
423.14	(Laughter)
425.38	Nelson Mandela gets two.
427.18	Churchill gets just one:
429.54	Churchill.
430.78	(Laughter)
432.1	Why the difference?
432.1	I'll tell you why the difference.
434.62	Because America was from the outset
434.62	a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,
438.94	so it had to create an identity
441.14	which it did by telling a story
443.5	which you learned at school,
443.5	you read on memorials
446.18	and you heard repeated
446.18	in presidential inaugural addresses.
450.06	Britain until recently
450.06	wasn't a nation of immigrants,
453.14	so it could take identity for granted.
455.62	The trouble is now
458.86	that two things have happened
458.86	which shouldn't have happened together.
462.38	The first thing is in the West
462.38	we've stopped telling this story
465.7	of who we are and why,
467.26	even in America.
469.26	And at the same time,
470.86	immigration is higher
470.86	than it's ever been before.
475.74	So when you tell a story
475.74	and your identity is strong,
479.06	you can welcome the stranger,
481.22	but when you stop telling the story,
483.74	your identity gets weak
485.3	and you feel threatened by the stranger.
488.82	And that's bad.
490.42	I tell you, Jews have been scattered
490.42	and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.
496.74	We never lost our identity.
498.46	Why? Because at least once a year,
500.58	on the festival of Passover,
502.34	we told our story
502.34	and we taught it to our children
505.3	and we ate the unleavened
505.3	bread of affliction
507.58	and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.
510.02	So we never lost our identity.
512.1	I think collectively
513.82	we've got to get back
513.82	to telling our story,
516.7	who we are, where we came from,
518.74	what ideals by which we live.
522.22	And if that happens,
524.1	we will become strong enough
526.54	to welcome the stranger and say,
529.22	"""Come and share our lives,"
532.34	share our stories,
534.54	"share our aspirations and dreams."""
538.7	That is the us of identity.
540.62	And finally, the us of responsibility.
544.66	Do you know something?
545.94	My favorite phrase in all of politics,
548.58	very American phrase,
551.34	"is: ""We the people."""
554.94	"Why ""we the people?"""
556.18	Because it says that we all
556.18	share collective responsibility
561.3	for our collective future.
563.86	And that's how things
563.86	really are and should be.
567.74	Have you noticed how magical thinking
571.1	has taken over our politics?
574.66	So we say, all you've got to do
574.66	is elect this strong leader
580.5	and he or she will solve
580.5	all our problems for us.
586.46	Believe me, that is magical thinking.
591.22	And then we get the extremes:
592.82	the far right, the far left,
595.74	the extreme religious
595.74	and the extreme anti-religious,
599.46	the far right dreaming
599.46	of a golden age that never was,
604.42	the far left dreaming
604.42	of a utopia that never will be
609.22	and the religious and anti-religious
609.22	equally convinced
613.26	that all it takes is God
613.26	or the absence of God
617.62	to save us from ourselves.
620.58	That, too, is magical thinking,
623.78	because the only people
623.78	who will save us from ourselves
628.46	is we the people,
630.86	all of us together.
633.06	And when we do that,
636.66	and when we move from the politics of me
640.06	to the politics of all of us together,
643.46	we rediscover those beautiful,
643.46	counterintuitive truths:
650.26	that a nation is strong
652.54	when it cares for the weak,
655.06	that it becomes rich
656.9	when it cares for the poor,
659.06	it becomes invulnerable
659.06	when it cares about the vulnerable.
663.7	That is what makes great nations.
666.14	(Applause)
674.94	So here is my simple suggestion.
678.54	It might just change your life,
682.06	and it might just help
682.06	to begin to change the world.
686.22	Do a search and replace operation
690.18	on the text of your mind,
692.94	and wherever you encounter
692.94	"the word ""self,"""
696.06	"substitute the word ""other."""
699.22	So instead of self-help, other-help;
702.5	instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.
707.06	And if you do that,
709.06	you will begin to feel the power
712.66	of what for me is one
712.66	of the most moving sentences
716.7	in all of religious literature.
719.94	"""Though I walk through the valley"
719.94	of the shadow of death,
724.86	I will fear no evil,
727.34	"for you are with me."""
730.22	We can face any future without fear
734.78	so long as we know
736.54	we will not face it alone.
739.9	"So for the sake of the future ""you,"""
743.98	together let us strengthen
746.86	"the future ""us."""
749.14	Thank you.
750.38	(Applause)
