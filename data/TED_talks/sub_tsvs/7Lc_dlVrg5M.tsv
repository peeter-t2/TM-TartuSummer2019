13.52	In case you are wondering,
15.28	no, I'm not wearing a dress,
18.84	and no, I'm not saying
18.84	what I'm wearing underneath.
22.48	(Laughter)
25.32	This is a gho.
27.92	This is my national dress.
30.2	This is how all men dress in Bhutan.
34.52	That is how our women dress.
38.32	Like our women,
40.52	we men get to wear pretty bright colors,
44.96	but unlike our women,
47.24	we get to show off our legs.
48.84	(Laughter)
50.88	Our national dress is unique,
52.32	but this is not the only thing
52.32	that's unique about my country.
56.04	Our promise to remain
56.04	carbon neutral is also unique,
59.2	and this is what I'd like
59.2	to speak about today,
61.44	our promise to remain carbon neutral.
64.72	But before I proceed,
64.72	I should set you the context.
68.68	I should tell you our story.
71.44	Bhutan is a small country
71.44	in the Himalayas.
76.16	We've been called Shangri-La,
78.32	even the last Shangri-La.
81.04	But let me tell you right off the bat,
81.04	we are not Shangri-La.
84.48	My country is not one big monastery
87.24	populated with happy monks.
88.92	(Laughter)
90.6	The reality is that
90.6	there are barely 700,000 of us
96.32	sandwiched between two
96.32	of the most populated countries on earth,
101.28	China and India.
104.76	The reality is that we are a small,
104.76	underdeveloped country
108.56	doing our best to survive.
111.6	But we are doing OK. We are surviving.
115	In fact, we are thriving,
118.32	and the reason we are thriving
118.32	is because we've been blessed
122.8	with extraordinary kings.
125.12	Our enlightened monarchs
125.12	have worked tirelessly
128.16	to develop our country,
130.04	balancing economic growth carefully
133.64	with social development,
133.64	environmental sustainability
136.56	and cultural preservation,
138.44	all within the framework
138.44	of good governance.
142.199	We call this holistic approach
142.199	to development
145.08	"""Gross National Happiness,"" or GNH."
149.44	Back in the 1970s,
151.48	our fourth king famously
151.48	pronounced that for Bhutan,
155.04	Gross National Happiness is more important
155.04	than Gross National Product.
159.6	(Applause)
164.4	Ever since,
166.32	all development in Bhutan
166.32	is driven by GNH,
171.08	a pioneering vision
171.08	that aims to improve the happiness
175	and well-being of our people.
178.76	But that's easier said than done,
180.96	especially when you are one
180.96	of the smallest economies in the world.
185.36	Our entire GDP is less
185.36	than two billion dollars.
189.92	I know that some of you here
189.92	are worth more --
192.44	(Laughter)
193.72	individually
195.28	than the entire economy of my country.
200.64	So our economy is small,
202.88	but here is where it gets interesting.
206	Education is completely free.
208.36	All citizens are guaranteed
208.36	free school education,
211.44	and those that work hard
211.44	are given free college education.
214.44	Healthcare is also completely free.
216.92	Medical consultation,
216.92	medical treatment, medicines:
220	they are all provided by the state.
223.44	We manage this
225.56	because we use our limited
225.56	resources very carefully,
229.6	and because we stay faithful
229.6	to the core mission of GNH,
235.28	which is development with values.
239.6	Our economy is small,
239.6	and we must strengthen it.
242.52	Economic growth is important,
244.72	but that economic growth must not come
244.72	from undermining our unique culture
249.88	or our pristine environment.
254.68	Today, our culture is flourishing.
257.08	We continue to celebrate
257.08	our art and architecture,
260.8	food and festivals,
263.88	monks and monasteries.
266.76	And yes, we celebrate
266.76	our national dress, too.
272.48	This is why I can wear my gho with pride.
277.2	Here's a fun fact:
279.52	you're looking
279.52	at the world's biggest pocket.
282.76	(Laughter)
285.12	It starts here,
287.16	goes around the back,
289.36	and comes out from inside here.
292.4	In this pocket
293.92	we store all manner of personal goods
296.96	from phones and wallets
300.28	to iPads, office files and books.
303.32	(Laughter)
304.56	(Applause)
306.28	But sometimes --
308.84	sometimes even precious cargo.
314.2	So our culture is flourishing,
316.56	but so is our environment.
	is under forest cover.
323.44	Our constitution demands
323.44	that a minimum of 60 percent
328.44	of Bhutan's total land
328.44	shall remain under forest cover
332.16	for all time.
333.4	(Applause)
339.08	Our constitution,
341.24	this constitution,
344	imposes forest cover on us.
347.88	Incidentally, our king
347.88	used this constitution
352.12	to impose democracy on us.
354.64	You see, we the people
354.64	didn't want democracy.
357.84	We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,
360.84	and we certainly didn't fight for it.
363.28	Instead, our king imposed democracy on us
368	by insisting that he include it
368	in the constitution.
372.52	But he went further.
374.48	He included provisions in the constitution
378.32	that empower the people
378.32	to impeach their kings,
382.08	and included provisions in here
382.08	that require all our kings to retire
387.64	at the age of 65.
390.44	(Applause)
391.92	Fact is, we already have
391.92	a king in retirement:
396.84	our previous king, the Great Fourth,
400.16	retired 10 years ago
402.64	at the peak of his popularity.
405.72	He was all of 51 years at that time.
411.08	So as I was saying,
	is under forest cover,
416.92	and all that forest is pristine.
419.72	That's why we are one of the few remaining
422.12	global biodiversity hotspots in the world,
425.16	and that's why we are
425.16	a carbon neutral country.
428.36	In a world that is threatened
428.36	with climate change,
430.72	we are a carbon neutral country.
435.48	Turns out, it's a big deal.
437.92	Of the 200-odd countries
437.92	in the world today,
440.32	it looks like we are the only one
442.56	that's carbon neutral.
445.52	Actually, that's not quite accurate.
449.04	Bhutan is not carbon neutral.
451.92	Bhutan is carbon negative.
455.6	Our entire country generates
455.6	2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,
462.56	but our forests, they sequester
462.56	more than three times that amount,
467.72	so we are a net carbon sink
469.88	for more than four million tons
469.88	of carbon dioxide each year.
475.16	But that's not all.
476.44	(Applause)
478.56	We export most
478.56	of the renewable electricity
481.68	we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.
485.16	So today, the clean energy that we export
488.6	offsets about six million tons
488.6	of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.
494.24	By 2020, we'll be exporting
494.24	enough electricity
498.2	to offset 17 million tons
498.2	of carbon dioxide.
502.68	And if we were to harness
502.68	even half our hydropower potential,
505.96	and that's exactly what we are working at,
509.12	the clean, green energy that we export
511.52	would offset something like
518.32	That is more CO2 than what the entire city
518.32	of New York generates in one year.
525.159	So inside our country,
525.159	we are a net carbon sink.
528.28	Outside, we are offsetting carbon.
530.84	And this is important stuff.
533.24	You see, the world is getting warmer,
535.84	and climate change is a reality.
539.44	Climate change is affecting my country.
542.28	Our glaciers are melting,
544.36	causing flash floods and landslides,
546.88	which in turn are causing disaster
546.88	and widespread destruction in our country.
553.56	I was at that lake recently.
555.76	It's stunning.
558.24	That's how it looked 10 years ago,
561.24	and that's how it looked 20 years ago.
564.32	Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.
567.88	It was a solid glacier.
571.52	A few years ago, a similar lake
574.76	breached its dams
577.92	and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.
582.36	That destruction
582.36	was caused by one glacier lake.
585.4	We have 2,700 of them to contend with.
590.64	The point is this:
592.8	my country and my people have done nothing
596.64	to contribute to global warming,
599.92	but we are already bearing the brunt
599.92	of its consequences.
605.64	And for a small, poor country,
605.64	one that is landlocked and mountainous,
609.6	it is very difficult.
612.32	But we are not going to sit
612.32	on our hands doing nothing.
614.96	We will fight climate change.
616.92	That's why we have promised
616.92	to remain carbon neutral.
622.48	We first made this promise in 2009
626.84	during COP 15 in Copenhagen,
630.8	but nobody noticed.
632.96	Governments were so busy
632.96	arguing with one another
635.64	and blaming each other
635.64	for causing climate change,
638.6	that when a small country
638.6	raised our hands and announced,
642.28	"""We promise to remain"
642.28	"carbon neutral for all time,"""
645.4	nobody heard us.
647.88	Nobody cared.
651.4	Last December in Paris,
654.48	at COP 21, we reiterated our promise
657.76	to remain carbon neutral
657.76	for all time to come.
661.76	This time, we were heard.
663.88	We were noticed, and everybody cared.
669.2	What was different in Paris
669.2	was that governments came round together
674.16	to accept the realities of climate change,
676.8	and were willing to come together
676.8	and act together and work together.
681	All countries, from the very small
681	to the very large,
685.44	committed to reduce
685.44	the greenhouse gas emissions.
690.68	The UN Framework Convention
690.68	on Climate Change
693.8	says that if these so-called
693.8	intended commitments are kept,
699.4	we'd be closer
699.4	to containing global warming
701.64	by two degrees Celsius.
706.44	By the way,
708.64	I've requested the TED organizers here
711.4	to turn up the heat in here
711.4	by two degrees,
716.52	so if some of you
716.52	are feeling warmer than usual,
719.36	you know who to blame.
723.52	It's crucial that all of us
723.52	keep our commitments.
727.6	As far as Bhutan is concerned,
729.08	we will keep our promise
729.08	to remain carbon neutral.
733.56	Here are some of the ways we are doing it.
736.76	We are providing free electricity
736.76	to our rural farmers.
740.24	The idea is that, with free electricity,
740.24	they will no longer have to use firewood
746.56	to cook their food.
748.52	We are investing in sustainable transport
751.36	and subsidizing the purchase
751.36	of electric vehicles.
754.84	Similarly, we are subsidizing
754.84	the cost of LED lights,
759	and our entire government
759	is trying to go paperless.
763.32	We are cleaning up our entire country
763.32	through Clean Bhutan, a national program,
767.84	and we are planting trees
767.84	throughout our country
771	through Green Bhutan,
773.16	another national program.
776.32	But it is our protected areas
778.52	that are at the core
778.52	of our carbon neutral strategy.
782.32	Our protected areas are our carbon sink.
785.56	They are our lungs.
788.88	Today, more than half
788.88	our country is protected,
792.4	as national parks, nature reserves
794.8	and wildlife sanctuaries.
797.4	But the beauty is that we've connected
797.4	them all with one another
801.52	through a network of biological corridors.
806.12	Now, what this means
807.4	is that our animals are free
807.4	to roam throughout our country.
813.76	Take this tiger, for example.
815.2	It was spotted
815.2	at 250 meters above sea level
818.92	in the hot, subtropical jungles.
822.04	Two years later, that same tiger
825.04	was spotted near 4,000 meters
828.56	in our cold alpine mountains.
831.84	Isn't that awesome?
833.72	(Applause)
837.8	We must keep it that way.
840.48	We must keep our parks awesome.
843.84	So every year, we set aside resources
843.84	to prevent poaching, hunting,
848.56	mining and pollution in our parks,
850.96	and resources to help communities
850.96	who live in those parks
856.12	manage their forests,
857.64	adapt to climate change,
859.12	and lead better lives while continuing
859.12	to live in harmony with Mother Nature.
864.6	But that is expensive.
866.64	Over the next few years,
866.64	our small economy won't have the resources
872.4	to cover all the costs that are required
872.4	to protect our environment.
877.56	In fact, when we run the numbers,
879.2	it looks like it'll take us
879.2	at least 15 years
881.92	before we can fully finance
881.92	all our conservation efforts.
887.28	But neither Bhutan,
889.72	nor the world
891.48	can afford to spend 15 years
891.48	going backwards.
896.6	This is why His Majesty the King
899.72	started Bhutan For Life.
902.32	Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.
904.92	It gives us breathing room.
907.12	It is essentially a funding mechanism
909.52	to look after our parks,
911.48	to protect our parks,
913.68	until our government
913.68	can take over on our own fully.
917.72	The idea is to raise a transition fund
921.52	from individual donors,
921.52	corporations and institutions,
925.84	but the deal is closed only
925.84	after predetermined conditions are met
930.4	and all funds committed.
932.92	So multiparty, single closing:
936.36	an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.
939.68	This means that individual donors
939.68	can commit without having to worry
944	that they'll be left
944	supporting an underfunded plan.
949.48	It's something like a Kickstarter project,
951.76	only with a 15-year time horizon
954.16	and millions of tons
954.16	of carbon dioxide at stake.
958.4	Once the deal is closed,
961.32	we use the transition fund
961.32	to protect our parks,
965.4	giving our government time
965.4	to increase our own funding gradually
970.6	until the end of the 15-year period.
972.64	After that, our government
972.64	guarantees full funding forever.
980.12	We are almost there.
981.8	We expect to close later this year.
984.64	Naturally, I'm pretty excited.
986.36	(Applause)
992.28	The World Wildlife Fund
992.28	is our principle partner in this journey,
998.96	and I want to give them a big shoutout
1001.04	for the excellent work
1001.04	they are doing in Bhutan
1004.16	and across the world.
1005.44	(Applause)
1009.04	Whew, it is getting warm in here.
1024.32	I thank you for listening to our story,
1027.12	a story of how we are keeping
1027.12	our promise to remain carbon neutral,
1031.68	a story of how we are keeping
1031.68	our country pristine,
1036.359	for ourselves, our children,
1038.76	for your children and for the world.
1042.56	But we are not here
1042.56	to tell stories, are we?
1045.64	We are here to dream together.
1049.319	So in closing, I'd like to share
1049.319	one more dream that I have.
1054.2	What if we could mobilize
1054.2	our leadership and our resources,
1057.839	our influence and our passion,
1060.52	to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea
1060.52	to other countries
1063.84	so that they too
1066.64	can conserve their
1066.64	protected areas for all time.
1070.16	After all, there are many other countries
1070.16	who face the same issues that we face.
1073.946	They too have natural resources
1076.16	that can help win the world's fight
1076.16	for sustainability,
1080.16	only they may not have the ability
1080.16	to invest in them now.
1083.08	So what if we set up Earth For Life,
1086.12	a global fund, to kickstart
1086.12	the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?
1092.32	I invite you to help me,
1094.72	to carry this dream beyond our borders
1097.2	to all those who care
1097.2	about our planet's future.
1102.88	After all, we're here to dream together,
1107	to work together,
1108.8	to fight climate change together,
1108.8	to protect our planet together.
1113.08	Because the reality is
1116.28	we are in it together.
1118.72	Some of us might dress differently,
1121.52	but we are in it together.
1123.72	Thank you very much,
1125.32	and kadrin chhe la. Thank you.
1127.24	(Applause)
1128.88	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
