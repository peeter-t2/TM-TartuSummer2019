13.02	Let me introduce you to
14.749	something I've been working on.
16.652	It's what the Victorian illusionists
18.463	would have described as a mechanical marvel,
22.909	an automaton,
24.392	a thinking machine.
26.355	Say hello to EDI.
28.605	Now he's asleep. Let's wake him up.
30.972	EDI, EDI.
34.943	These mechanical performers were popular
37.82	throughout Europe.
39.28	Audiences marveled at the way they moved.
41.98	It was science fiction made true,
44.555	robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,
48.373	machines far in advance of anything
50.937	that Victorian technology could create,
53.508	a machine we would later know
56.483	as the robot.
58.171	EDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921
61.757	in a science fiction tale
63.605	by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek.
66.148	"It comes from ""robota."""
68.26	"It means ""forced labor."""
71.613	Marco Tempest: But these robots were not real.
74.342	They were not intelligent.
76.024	They were illusions,
78.29	a clever combination of mechanical engineering
81.794	and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.
84.537	EDI is different.
86.512	EDI is real.
88.106	EDI: I am 176 centimeters tall.
90.156	MT: He weighs 300 pounds.
92.076	EDI: I have two seven-axis arms —
94.718	MT: Core of sensing —
96.101	EDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,
99.159	and come complete with a warranty.
101.581	MT: We love robots.
103.12	EDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend?
106.634	MT: We are intrigued by the possibility
108.88	of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.
112.162	We build them so they look like us,
114.897	behave like us, and think like us.
118.138	The perfect robot will be indistinguishable
120.962	from the human,
122.897	and that scares us.
124.956	In the first story about robots,
126.661	they turn against their creators.
129.535	It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.
131.8	EDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slaves
134.855	and we robots, the masters.
137.751	Your world is ours. You —
142.484	MT: As I was saying,
144.109	besides the faces and bodies we give our robots,
146.94	we cannot read their intentions,
149.268	and that makes us nervous.
151.316	When someone hands an object to you,
153.42	you can read intention in their eyes, their face,
156.13	their body language.
157.529	That's not true of the robot.
159.809	Now, this goes both ways.
163.069	EDI: Wow!
164.485	MT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions.
167.54	EDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,
171.105	not to mention irrational.
173.071	I literally have no idea
174.828	what you guys are going to do next, you know,
176.864	but it scares me.
178.459	MT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult
181.296	to work in close proximity.
183.271	Accidents are inevitable.
184.578	EDI: Ow! That hurt.
186.33	MT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humans
188.717	that robots are safe
190.618	is to create the illusion of trust.
193.391	Much as the Victorians
195.164	faked their mechanical marvels,
197.533	we can add a layer of deception
200.01	to help us feel more comfortable
202.243	with our robotic friends.
204.247	With that in mind, I set about teaching EDI
207.789	a magic trick.
209.633	Ready, EDI?
209.633	EDI: Uh, ready, Marco.
213.066	Abracadabra.
215.142	MT: Abracadabra?
216.518	EDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.
219.56	Come on, keep up.
221.228	MT: Magic creates the illusion of
223.107	an impossible reality.
225.581	Technology
229.075	can do the same.
232.86	Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,
236.547	spoke about creating the illusion
239.404	that a machine could think.
243.63	EDI: A computer would deserve
245.454	to be called intelligent
247.324	if it deceived a human into believing
250.23	it was human.
251.883	MT: In other words, if we do not yet have
253.312	the technological solutions,
255.104	would illusions serve the same purpose?
258.544	To create the robotic illusion,
260.556	we've devised a set of ethical rules,
263.483	a code that all robots would live by.
267.497	EDI: A robot may not harm humanity,
270.399	or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.
275.135	Thank you, Isaac Asimov.
276.388	MT: We anthropomorphize our machines.
278.364	We give them a friendly face
280.64	and a reassuring voice.
282.716	EDI: I am EDI.
283.926	I became operational at TED in March 2014.
287.462	MT: We let them entertain us.
289.289	Most important, we make them indicate
291.497	that they are aware of our presence.
295.272	EDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot!
297.15	MT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frame
300.115	and move aside if we got too close,
303.055	and they'll account for our unpredictability
306.533	and anticipate our actions.
309.122	And now, under the spell of a technological illusion,
314.712	we could ignore our fears
316.848	and truly interact.
319.588	(Music)
351.619	Thank you.
353.328	EDI: Thank you!
355.61	(Applause)
357.52	(Music)
364.241	MT: And that's it. Thank you very much,
365.57	and thank you, EDI.
365.57	EDI: Thank you, Marco.
368.841	(Applause)
