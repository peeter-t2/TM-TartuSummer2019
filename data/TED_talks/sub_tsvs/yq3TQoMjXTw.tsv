16.066	Okay, this morning I'm speaking
17.841	on the question of corruption.
21.03	And corruption is defined
23.19	as the abuse of a position of trust
28.926	for the benefit of yourself -- or, in the case of our context,
32.566	your friends, your family or your financiers.
35.189	Okay? Friends, family and financiers.
39.712	But we need to understand what we understand about corruption,
43.727	and we need to understand that
46.525	we have been miseducated about it, and we have to admit that.
49.874	We have to have the courage to admit that
51.431	to start changing how we deal with it.
53.876	The first thing is that the big myth, number one,
56.799	is that in fact it's not really a crime.
59.17	When we get together with friends and family
60.96	and we discuss crime in our country,
62.839	crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella,
66.432	nobody's speaking about corruption.
67.962	That's the honest truth.
69.512	When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime,
72.549	he isn't speaking about corruption.
74.559	And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security
76.875	is speaking about crime, he's not talking about corruption either.
80.75	The point I'm making is that it is a crime.
83.365	It is an economic crime, because we're involving the looting of taxpayers' money.
88.215	Public and private corruption is a reality.
90.983	As somebody who comes from the private sector,
92.714	I can tell you there's a massive amount of corruption
95.11	in the private sector that has nothing to do with government.
97.889	The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table,
100.731	it all takes place in the private sector.
103.199	Today, I'm focusing on public sector corruption,
106.8	which the private sector also participates in.
109.935	The second important myth to understand --
112.231	because we have to destroy these myths,
113.965	dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them --
116.425	the second important myth to understand
118.371	is the one that says
120.863	that in fact corruption is only a small problem --
124.132	if it is a problem, it's only a small problem,
126.462	that in fact it's only a little 10 or 15 percent,
130.156	it's been going on forever, it probably will continue forever,
134.047	and there's no point passing any laws, because there's little we can do about it.
137.831	And I want to demonstrate that that, too,
140.191	is a dangerous myth, very dangerous.
142.128	It's a piece of public mischief.
144.549	And I want to speak a little bit,
147.143	take us back about 30 years.
149.391	We're coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago,
151.385	a resource-rich, small Caribbean country,
154.583	and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country's wealth,
159.629	and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices.
163.122	We call them petrodollars. The treasury was bursting with money.
166.157	And it's ironic, because
169.845	we're standing today in the Central Bank.
171.883	You see, history's rich in irony.
174.079	We're standing today in the Central Bank,
175.901	and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I'm going to be speaking about.
179.279	Okay? We're talking about irresponsibility in public office.
182.604	We're speaking about the fact that across the terrace,
185.352	the next tower is the Ministry of Finance,
187.391	and there's a lot of connection with us today,
189.079	so we're speaking within your temple today. Okay?
191.929	(Applause)
196.829	The first thing I want to talk about is that
199.071	when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago,
202.767	we embarked, the government of the day embarked
204.854	on a series of government-to-government arrangements
206.964	to have rapidly develop the country.
208.998	And some of the largest projects in the country
211.264	were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements
214.462	with some of the leading countries in the world,
216.278	the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on.
218.986	As I said, even this building we're standing in -- that's one of the ironies --
222.054	this building was part of that series of complexes,
223.738	what they called the Twin Towers.
227.846	It became so outrageous, the whole situation,
230.806	that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed,
233.686	and it reported in 1982, 30 years ago it reported --
237.689	the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago,
240.438	and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped.
244.374	The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament
246.282	to give a budget speech, and he said some things that I'll never forget.
249.479	They went right in here. I was a young man at the time.
251.776	It went right into my heart.
253.156	And he said that, in fact — Let me see if this thing works.
257.913	Are we getting a, yeah?—
260.39	That's what he told us.
262.389	He told us that, in fact,
266.529	two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars
269.451	that we spent, the taxpayers' money,
271.835	was wasted or stolen.
273.919	So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief.
277.962	As we say, it's a nancy-story. Forget it.
280.071	That's for little children. We are big people,
281.766	and we're trying to deal with what's happening in our society.
284.553	Okay? This is the size of the problem.
286.698	Okay? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted.
289.71	That was 30 years ago. 1982 was Ballah.
293.152	So what has changed?
295.211	I don't like to bring up embarrassing secrets
296.898	to an international audience, but I have to.
299.457	Four months ago, we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country.
302.97	We call it the Section 34 fiasco, the Section 34 fiasco,
307.868	a suspicious piece of law, and I'm going to say it like it is,
310.514	a suspicious piece of law
311.869	was passed at a suspicious time
314.012	to free some suspects. (Laughter)
315.91	And it was called, those people are called
322.643	the Piarco Airport accused.
324.217	I'm going to have my own lexicon speaking here today.
327.094	They are the Piarco Airport accused.
328.921	It was a constitutional outrage of the first order,
331.814	and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament.
335.87	Our highest institution in our country was perverted.
338.969	We are dealing with perverts here
340.942	of an economic and financial nature.
342.664	Do you get how serious this problem is?
344.513	There was massive protest. A lot of us in this room
346.623	took part in the protest in different forms.
349.333	Most importantly, the American embassy complained,
352.152	so Parliament was swiftly reconvened,
354.639	and the law was reversed, it was repealed.
356.544	That's the word lawyers use. It was repealed.
358.491	But the point is
361.608	that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events,
365.303	because what really happened is that,
367.789	because of the suspicious passage of that law,
370.863	the law was actually passed into effect
373.184	on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence,
376.442	our jubilee of independence.
378.002	So that is the kind of outrage of the thing.
380.024	It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation, but we got it,
383.435	because we all understood it,
385.122	and for the first time that I could remember,
386.88	there were mass protests against this corruption.
390.43	And that gave me a lot of hope. Okay?
392.621	Those of us who are, sometimes you feel like
394.484	you're a little bit on your own doing some of this work.
397.853	That passage of the law and the repeal of the law
401.301	fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused.
405.277	So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place.
409.888	But what were they accused of?
411.784	What was it that they were accused of?
412.887	I'm being a bit mysterious for those of you out there. What were they accused of?
416.166	We were trying to build, or reconstruct largely,
418.748	an airport that had grown outdated.
421.35	The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars,
425.14	Trinidad and Tobago dollars,
427.707	and in fact, we had a lot of bid-rigging
430.87	and suspicious activity, corrupt activity took place.
434.057	And to get an idea of what it consisted of,
438.147	and to put it in context in relationship to this whole
441.027	second myth about it being no big thing,
443.46	we can look at this second slide here.
446.231	And what we have here -- I am not saying so,
449.924	this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement. He said so.
454.731	And he's telling us that for the $1.6 billion cost of the project,
459.205	one billion dollars has been traced
461.397	to offshore bank accounts.
463.16	One billion dollars of our taxpayers' money
465.323	has been located in offshore bank accounts.
468.721	Being the kind of suspicious person I am,
470.834	I am outraged at that, and I'm going to pause here,
473.551	I'm going to pause now and again and bring in different things.
476.047	I'm going to pause here and bring in something I saw
477.861	in November last year at Wall Street. I was at Zuccotti Park.
481.605	It was autumn. It was cool. It was damp. It was getting dark.
485.797	And I was walking around with the protesters
487.73	looking at the One Wall Street, Occupy Wall Street movement walking around.
492.023	And there was a lady with a sign, a very simple sign,
494.343	a kind of battered-looking blonde lady,
496.767	and the sign was made out of Bristol board, as we say in these parts,
499.59	and it was made with a marker.
501.582	And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center.
504.103	"It said, ""If you're not outraged, you haven't been paying attention."""
508.51	If you're not outraged by all of this, you haven't been paying attention.
511.492	So listen up, because we're getting into even deeper waters.
515.623	My brain started thinking.
517.78	Well, what if --
520.671	because I'm suspicious like that. I read a lot of spy novels and stuff.
523.877	What if -- (Laughter)
525.555	But to make it in these wrongs,
528.079	you have to read a lot of spy novels
529.704	and follow some of that stuff, right? (Laughter)
532.271	But what if this wasn't the first time?
536.838	What if this is just the first time
539.425	that the so-and-sos had been caught?
541.76	What if it had happened before? How would I find out?
546.886	Now, the previous two examples I gave
549.376	were to do with construction sector corruption, okay?
553.432	And I have the privilege at this time
555.463	to lead the Joint Consultative Council, which is a not-for-profit.
558.841	We're at jcc.org.tt, and we have the -- we are the leaders
562.438	in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system
565.664	about how public money is transacted.
567.824	So those of you interested in finding out more about it,
570.029	or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions, please get involved.
574.309	But I'm going to segue to another thing that relates,
576.568	because one of my private campaigns I've been conducting
579.344	for over three and a half years
581.68	is for transparency and accountability
584.169	around the bailout of CL Financial.
587.268	CL Financial is the Caribbean's largest ever conglomerate, okay?
592.269	And without getting into all of the details,
595.192	it is said to have collapsed — I'm using my words very carefully —
598.208	it's said to have collapsed in January of '09,
601.035	which is just coming up to nearly four years.
604.713	In an unprecedented fit of generosity --
607.525	and you have to be very suspicious about these people --
610.008	in an unprecedented — and I'm using that word carefully —
612.639	unprecedented fit of generosity, the government of the day
616.523	signed, made a written commitment, to repay all of the creditors.
620.178	And I can tell you without fear of contradiction
622.5	that hasn't happened anywhere else on the planet.
625.682	Let's understand, because we lack context.
627.593	People are telling us it's just like Wall Street. It's not just like Wall Street.
630.598	Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something.
635.087	It's not just like anywhere. (Applause)
639.831	It's not just like anywhere. It's not just like anywhere.
644.985	Here is here, and out there is out there. Okay?
647.816	I'm serious now.
649.146	Listen. They've had bailouts on Wall Street.
652.129	They've had bailouts in London.
654.08	They've had bailouts in Europe.
656.217	In Africa, they've had bailouts. In Nigeria, six of the major
658.887	commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours, eh?
661.452	It's interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has --
663.693	how they've treated it, and they've treated it
666.083	very well compared to us.
667.954	Nowhere on the planet
669.886	have all the creditors been bailed out
672.592	in excess of what their statutory entitlements were.
674.884	Only here. So what was the reason for the generosity?
678.466	Is our government that generous? And maybe they are.
681.271	Let's look at it. Let's look into it.
683.287	So I started digging and writing and so and so on,
686.055	and that work can be found, my personal work
687.867	can be found at AfraRaymond.com, which is my name.
691.247	It's a not-for-profit blog that I run.
694.119	Not as popular as some of the other people, but there you go.
696.643	(Laughter)
698.901	But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34,
703.39	that plot to pervert Parliament, that bitter experience
705.847	that took place in August,
708.933	when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence,
711.831	going into September, forced me to check myself
716.495	and recalculate my bearings,
718.554	and to go back into some of the work, some of the stuff I'd written
720.776	and some of the exchanges I'd had with the officials
723.045	to see what was really what.
725.049	As we say in Trinidad and Tobago, who is who and what is what?
729.159	Okay? We want to try to recalculate.
730.983	And I made a Freedom of Information application
733.407	in May this year to the Ministry of Finance.
737.321	The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over.
739.379	This is the other context.
741.054	The Ministry of Finance, we are told,
743.13	is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
746.959	I'm going to take you through a worked example of whether that's really so.
750.263	The Central Bank in which we stand this morning
753.151	is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
757.348	So in fact, you can't ask them anything,
759.027	and they don't have to answer anything.
760.72	That is the law since 1999.
763.542	So I plunged into this struggle, and I asked four questions.
767.118	And I'll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply,
770.807	so you could understand, as I said, where we are.
773.422	Here is not like anywhere else.
774.943	Question number one:
777.921	I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial,
780.511	and if you can't show me the accounts --
782.983	the Minister of Finance is making statements,
784.948	passing new laws and giving speeches and so on.
787.563	What are the figures he's relying on?
789.854	It's like that joke: I want whatever he's drinking.
792.474	And they wrote back and said to me,
794.073	well what do you really mean?
795.784	So they hit my question with a question.
798.175	Second point: I want to see
801.296	who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid?
804.995	Let me pause here to point out to you all
806.999	that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this.
810.68	That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars
813.079	coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich --
816.575	Caribbean country. Okay?
818.947	And I asked the question,
820.495	who was getting that three and a half billion dollars?
824.641	And I want to pause again to bring up context,
826.898	because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing.
830.301	There's a particular individual who is in the government now.
832.871	The name of the person doesn't matter.
834.591	And that person made a career
837.143	out of using the Freedom of Information Act
839.504	to advance his political cause.
841.623	Okay? His name isn't important.
844.866	I wouldn't dignify it. I'm on a point.
847.199	The point is, that person made a career out of using
849.619	the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause.
852.583	And the most famous case
854.897	was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal,
857.79	where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money
860.679	that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships,
863.551	and the scholarships hadn't been advertised, and so and so on and so on.
866.275	And he was able to get the court, using that act of Parliament,
869.266	Freedom of Information Act,
870.899	to release the information,
872.876	and I thought that was excellent.
876.241	Fantastic.
879.407	But you see, the question is this:
881.357	If it's right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act
885.57	and to use the court
889.3	to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money,
894.042	it must be right and proper
895.733	for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars.
899.874	You see? But the Ministry of Finance,
902.462	the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance,
904.064	wrote me and said to me, that information is exempt too.
907.121	You see? This is what we're dealing with, okay?
910.11	The third thing I will tell you
912.244	is that I also asked
915.249	for the directors of CL Financial,
918.245	whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act.
922.59	We have an Integrity in Public Life Act
924.208	as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation's interest.
928.957	And public officials are supposed to file
931.245	to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities.
937.71	And of course I've since discovered that they're not filing,
940.125	and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file.
943.004	So here we have it. We have a situation where
947.921	the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability
952.815	and transparency have all been discarded.
954.808	I've asked the question in the legal and required fashion.
957.052	It's been ignored.
959.54	The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34,
962.715	we need to continue to work on that. We can't forget it.
965.317	I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country's history.
968.915	It's also the single largest example
971.496	of public corruption according to this equation.
976.508	And this is my reality check.
979.477	Where you have an expenditure of public money
981.823	and it is without accountability
984.778	and it's without transparency,
986.418	it will always be equal to corruption,
988.674	whether you're in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska,
991.879	it will always be equal to corruption, and that is what we are dealing with here.
996.079	I'm going to continue the work
998.39	to press on, to get some resolution
1002.736	of those matters at the Ministry of Finance.
1004.446	If it is I have to go to court personally, I will do that.
1006.998	We will continue to press on.
1008.186	We will continue to work within JCC.
1010.137	But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context
1012.838	and bring something new to the table
1014.757	in terms of an international example.
1016.583	We had the journalist [Heather] Brooke speaking
1019.484	about her battle against government corruption,
1021.801	and she introduced me to this website, Alaveteli.com.
1027.238	And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database
1031.908	for Freedom of Information applications,
1034.687	and speak with each other.
1036.803	I could see what you're applying for.
1039.04	You could see what I applied for and what replies I got.
1042.572	We can work on it together. We need to build a collective database
1045.508	and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point.
1048.812	We need to increase the consciousness.
1050.452	The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one,
1054.506	which is a lovely website from India
1056.284	called IPaidABribe.com.
1058.726	They have international branches,
1060.512	and it's important for us to tune into this one.
1062.956	IPaidABribe.com is really important,
1065.412	a good one to log on to and see.
1067.828	I'm going to pause there. I'm going to ask you for your courage.
1070.455	Discard the first myth; it is a crime.
1072.676	Discard the second myth; it is a big thing.
