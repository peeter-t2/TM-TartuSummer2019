12.976	As a conceptual artist,
14.394	I'm constantly looking for creative ways
14.394	to spark challenging conversations.
18.726	I do this though painting, sculpture,
18.726	video and performance.
22.449	But regardless of the format,
23.912	two of my favorite materials
23.912	are history and dialogue.
27.796	"In 2007, I created ""Lotus,"""
30.259	a seven-and-a-half-foot diameter,
	of a lotus blossom.
35.937	In Buddhism, the lotus is a symbol
35.937	for transcendence
39.43	and for purity of mind and spirit.
41.882	But a closer look at this lotus
44.327	reveals each petal
44.327	to be the cross-section of a slave ship.
47.985	This iconic diagram was taken
47.985	from a British slaving manual
51.684	and later used by abolitionists to show
51.684	the atrocities of slavery.
56.104	In America, we don't like
56.104	to talk about slavery,
58.533	nor do we look at it as a global industry.
61.397	But by using this Buddhist symbol,
63.049	I hope to universalize and transcend
65.676	the history and trauma of black America
68.089	and encourage discussions
68.089	about our shared past.
72.033	"To create ""Lotus,"""
72.033	we carved over 6,000 figures.
76.469	And this later led to a commission
76.469	by the City of New York
79.216	to create a 28-foot version in steel
81.494	as a permanent installation
81.494	at the Eagle Academy for Young Men,
84.96	a school for black and latino students,
87.122	the two groups most affected
87.122	by this history.
90.244	The same two groups are very affected
90.244	by a more recent phenomenon,
93.819	but let me digress.
95.84	I've been collecting
95.84	wooden African figures
98.031	from tourist shops and flea markets
98.031	around the world.
100.539	The authenticity and origin
100.539	of them is completely debatable,
103.645	but people believe these
103.645	to be imbued with power,
106.327	or even magic.
107.683	Only recently have I figured out
107.683	how to use this in my own work.
111.412	(Gun shots)
125.253	Since 2012, the world has witnessed
125.253	the killings of Trayvon Martin,
129.445	Michael Brown, Eric Garner,
129.445	Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice
133.209	and literally countless other
133.209	unarmed black citizens
136.193	at the hands of the police,
137.646	who frequently walk away
137.646	with no punishment at all.
140.775	In consideration of these victims
142.828	and the several times that even I,
144.662	a law-abiding, Ivy League professor,
147.159	have been targeted and harassed
147.159	at gunpoint by the police.
150.647	I created this body of work
150.647	"simply entitled ""BAM."""
156.389	It was important to erase
156.389	the identity of each of these figures,
159.912	to make them all look the same
159.912	and easier to disregard.
163.685	To do this, I dip them in a thick,
163.685	brown wax
165.909	before taking them to a shooting range
167.896	where I re-sculpted them using bullets.
171.098	And it was fun,
172.303	playing with big guns and
172.303	high-speed video cameras.
175.164	But my reverence for these figures
175.164	kept me from actually pulling the trigger,
178.845	somehow feeling as if I would
178.845	be shooting myself.
181.995	Finally, my cameraman, Raul,
181.995	fired the shots.
186.503	I then took the fragments of these
188.396	and created molds,
188.396	and cast them first in wax,
192.749	and finally in bronze
192.749	like the image you see here,
195.876	which bears the marks
195.876	of its violent creation
198.004	like battle wounds or scars.
200.583	When I showed this work recently in Miami,
202.615	a woman told me she felt
202.615	every gun shot to her soul.
205.424	But she also felt that these artworks
208.039	memorialized the victims of these killings
210.063	as well as other victims of
210.063	racial violence throughout US history.
213.812	"But ""Lotus"" and ""BAM"" are larger"
213.812	than just US history.
216.87	While showing in Berlin last year,
218.758	a philosophy student asked me
218.758	what prompted these recent killings.
222.343	I showed him a photo
222.343	of a lynching postcard
224.985	from the early 1900s
226.374	and reminded him that these killings
226.374	have been going on for over 500 years.
231.922	But it's only through questions like his
233.852	and more thoughtful dialogue
233.852	about history and race
236.718	can we evolve as individuals and society.
239.709	I hope my artwork creates a safe space
242.566	for this type of honest exchange
245.002	and an opportunity for people
245.002	to engage one another
247.765	in real and necessary conversation.
250.751	Thank you.
251.925	(Applause)
