12.359	Hi. I am an architect.
14.008	I am the only architect in the world
16.456	making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube,
19.772	and this exhibition is the first one I did
22.338	using paper tubes.
28.271	about ecological issues and environmental issues,
32.474	I just started testing the paper tube
35.764	in order to use this as a building structure.
38.499	It's very complicated to test the new material for the building,
43.652	but this is much stronger than I expected,
46.15	and also it's very easy to waterproof,
48.362	and also, because it's industrial material,
50.257	it's also possible to fireproof.
52.96	Then I built the temporary structure, 1990.
56.793	This is the first temporary building made out of paper.
59.8	There are 330 tubes, diameter 55 [centimeters],
63.87	there are only 12 tubes with a diameter
65.512	of 120 centimeters, or four feet, wide.
68.282	As you see it in the photo, inside is the toilet.
70.902	In case you're finished with toilet paper,
73.553	you can tear off the inside of the wall. (Laughter)
75.873	So it's very useful.
78.265	Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.
82.304	I was asked to design the building,
84.923	because the theme of the expo was environmental issues.
87.717	So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes,
92.205	recyclable paper.
93.932	My goal of the design is not when it's completed.
96.902	My goal was when the building was demolished,
98.986	because each country makes a lot of pavilions
102.962	but after half a year, we create a lot of industrial waste,
106.062	so my building has to be reused or recycled.
110.743	After, the building was recycled.
112.846	So that was the goal of my design.
115.492	Then I was very lucky to win the competition
118.58	to build the second Pompidou Center in France
121.238	in the city of Metz.
122.713	Because I was so poor,
124.209	I wanted to rent an office in Paris,
126.376	but I couldn't afford it,
127.893	so I decided to bring my students to Paris
129.934	to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris
133.45	by ourselves.
134.685	So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints
138.014	to complete the 35-meter-long office.
142.099	We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.
145.133	(Laughter) (Applause)
149.004	Thank you. I had one big problem.
151.391	Because we were part of the exhibition,
153.745	even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
157.049	That was the problem.
159.252	Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
162.02	It's a very popular museum now,
163.974	and I created a big monument for the government.
167.14	But then I was very disappointed
169.039	at my profession as an architect,
171.635	because we are not helping, we are not working for society,
175.663	but we are working for privileged people,
178.907	rich people, government, developers.
182.099	They have money and power.
184.619	Those are invisible.
186.416	So they hire us to visualize their power and money
190.244	by making monumental architecture.
192.477	That is our profession, even historically it's the same,
194.642	even now we are doing the same.
196.994	So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society,
200.318	even though there are so many people
204.32	who lost their houses by natural disasters.
207.212	But I must say they are no longer natural disasters.
210.255	For example, earthquakes never kill people,
213.24	but collapse of the buildings kill people.
215.413	That's the responsibility of architects.
217.453	Then people need some temporary housing,
219.19	but there are no architects working there
220.852	because we are too busy working for privileged people.
224.512	So I thought, even as architects,
228.391	we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing.
233.147	We can make it better.
234.939	So that is why I started working in disaster areas.
242.698	Two tribes, Hutu and Tutsi, fought each other.
245.43	Over two million people became refugees.
247.928	But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp
251.679	organized by the U.N.
253.913	They're so poor, and they are freezing
257.207	with blankets during the rainy season,
259.33	In the shelters built by the U.N.,
262.085	they were just providing a plastic sheet,
264.391	and the refugees had to cut the trees, and just like this.
268.54	But over two million people cut trees.
270.306	It just became big, heavy deforestation
273.097	and an environmental problem.
274.83	That is why they started providing aluminum pipes, aluminum barracks.
278.06	Very expensive, they throw them out for money,
280.347	then cutting trees again.
282.273	So I proposed my idea to improve the situation
286.294	using these recycled paper tubes
288.454	because this is so cheap and also so strong,
291.387	but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit.
294.134	We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test
297.095	for the durability and moisture and termites, so on.
302.801	And then, year afterward, 1995, in Kobe, Japan,
307.381	we had a big earthquake.
309.174	Nearly 7,000 people were killed,
311.686	and the city like this Nagata district,
314.677	all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake.
317.995	And also I found out there's many Vietnamese refugees
321.936	suffering and gathering at a Catholic church --
324.531	all the building was totally destroyed.
326.45	So I went there and also I proposed to the priests,
329.951	"""Why don't we rebuild the church out of paper tubes?"""
332.569	"And he said, ""Oh God, are you crazy?"
335.709	"After a fire, what are you proposing?"""
337.818	So he never trusted me, but I didn't give up.
341.446	I started commuting to Kobe,
343.328	and I met the society of Vietnamese people.
345.957	They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets
348.624	in the park.
349.905	So I proposed to rebuild. I raised -- did fundraising.
353.147	I made a paper tube shelter for them,
355.703	and in order to make it easy to be built by students
358.661	and also easy to demolish,
360.244	I used beer crates as a foundation.
363.453	I asked the Kirin beer company to propose,
366.043	because at that time, the Asahi beer company
368.763	made their plastic beer crates red,
370.775	which doesn't go with the color of the paper tubes.
373.189	The color coordination is very important.
375.507	And also I still remember, we were expecting
378.7	to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate,
381.055	but it came empty. (Laughter)
382.949	So I remember it was so disappointing.
386.341	So during the summer with my students,
388.579	we built over 50 units of the shelters.
390.765	Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
393.536	"He said, ""As long as you collect money by yourself,"
395.827	"bring your students to build, you can do it."""
398.081	So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
400.564	It was meant to stay there for three years,
404.062	but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
407.36	Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake,
411.169	and we proposed to donate this church,
415.119	so we dismantled them,
416.72	we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
418.965	It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
422.589	So this building became a permanent building.
425.08	Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
429.729	Even a building made in paper
431.662	can be permanent as long as people love it.
435.192	Even a concrete building can be very temporary
437.488	if that is made to make money.
439.505	In 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake,
442.215	I went there to use the local material to build a shelter.
450.219	In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake
454.3	and tsunami, I rebuilt Islamic fishermen's villages.
457.981	And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China,
463.432	nearly 70,000 people were killed,
466.358	and also especially many of the schools were destroyed
469.443	because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor.
472.893	I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.
475.861	I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students.
479.647	In one month, we completed nine classrooms,
482.508	over 500 square meters.
484.16	It's still used, even after the current earthquake in China.
488.632	In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila, also they had a big earthquake.
494.096	And this is a very interesting photo:
496.448	former Prime Minister Berlusconi
499.165	and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso --
503.583	you know, because we have to change the prime minister ever year.
507.464	And they are very kind, affording my model.
512.426	I proposed a big rebuilding, a temporary music hall,
516.825	because L'Aquila is very famous for music
519.269	and all the concert halls were destroyed,
520.694	so musicians were moving out.
522.826	So I proposed to the mayor,
524.253	I'd like to rebuild the temporary auditorium.
526.488	"He said, ""As long as you bring your money, you can do it."""
529.434	And I was very lucky.
530.617	Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit,
532.918	and our former prime minister came,
535.024	so they helped us to collect money,
538.229	and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government
541.072	to rebuild this temporary auditorium.
543.959	Year 2010 in Haiti, there was a big earthquake,
548.679	but it's impossible to fly over,
550.27	so I went to Santo Domingo, next-door country,
553.287	to drive six hours to get to Haiti
556.202	with the local students in Santo Domingo
559.493	to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes.
562.946	This is what happened in Japan two years ago, in northern Japan.
566.559	After the earthquake and tsunami,
568.434	people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium.
572.221	But look at this. There's no privacy.
574.122	People suffer mentally and physically.
576.989	So we went there to build partitions
580.38	with all the student volunteers with paper tubes,
583.643	just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain.
587.874	However, some of the facility authority
590.39	doesn't want us to do it, because, they said,
592.437	simply, it's become more difficult to control them.
595.634	But it's really necessary to do it.
598.116	They don't have enough flat area to build
600.621	standard government single-story housing like this one.
603.906	Look at this. Even civil government is doing
606.156	such poor construction of the temporary housing,
610.285	so dense and so messy because there is no storage, nothing, water is leaking,
616.816	so I thought, we have to make multi-story building
620.085	because there's no land and also it's not very comfortable.
623.11	So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions.
628.04	Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village
631.671	in Miyagi.
632.991	He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball [fields].
637.377	I used the shipping container
640.103	and also the students helped us to make
642.556	all the building furniture
645.354	to make them comfortable,
647.046	within the budget of the government
649.321	but also the area of the house is exactly the same,
653.23	but much more comfortable.
654.37	Many of the people want to stay here forever.
657.502	I was very happy to hear that.
660.064	Now I am working in New Zealand, Christchurch.
664.001	About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened,
667.848	also they had a big earthquake,
669.353	and many Japanese students were also killed,
671.914	and the most important cathedral of the city,
674.233	the symbol of Christchurch, was totally destroyed.
677.004	And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral.
681.102	So this is under construction.
683.389	And I'd like to keep building monuments
686.729	that are beloved by people.
688.959	Thank you very much.
690.398	(Applause)
692.334	Thank you. (Applause)
695.067	Thank you very much. (Applause)
