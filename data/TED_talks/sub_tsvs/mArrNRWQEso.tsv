13.381	Charlie Rose: So Larry sent me an email
17.007	and he basically said,
18.994	we've got to make sure that 
18.994	we don't seem like we're
22.723	a couple of middle-aged boring men.
27.214	I said, I'm flattered by that --
30.256	(Laughter) —
32.628	because I'm a bit older,
36.143	and he has a bit more net worth than I do.
40.294	Larry Page: Well, thank you.
42.893	CR: So we'll have a conversation about
45.873	the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,
48.571	and we'll have a conversation about search
50.005	and privacy,
51.372	and also about your philosophy
52.927	and a sense of how you've connected the dots
55.383	and how this journey that began
57.474	some time ago
58.758	has such interesting prospects.
60.653	Mainly we want to talk about the future.
63.249	So my first question: Where is Google
64.838	and where is it going?
66.884	LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,
68.343	and our mission we defined a long time ago
71.918	is to organize the world's information
74.181	and make it universally accessible and useful.
77.619	And people always say,
79.661	is that really what you guys are still doing?
81.876	And I always kind of think about that myself,
83.994	and I'm not quite sure.
86.19	But actually, when I think about search,
90.197	it's such a deep thing for all of us,
92.813	to really understand what you want,
95.056	to understand the world's information,
97.424	and we're still very much in the early stages of that,
100.956	which is totally crazy.
102.769	We've been at it for 15 years already,
105.287	but it's not at all done.
108.862	CR: When it's done, how will it be?
111.538	LP: Well, I guess,
114.255	in thinking about where we're going --
116.655	you know, why is it not done? --
118.942	a lot of it is just computing's kind of a mess.
121.378	You know, your computer
121.378	doesn't know where you are,
123.181	it doesn't know what you're doing,
125.216	it doesn't know what you know,
126.898	and a lot we've been trying to do recently
129.474	is just make your devices work,
132.769	make them understand your context.
135.11	Google Now, you know, knows where you are,
137.113	knows what you may need.
139.295	So really having computing 
139.295	work and understand you
143.403	and understand that information,
145.459	we really haven't done that yet.
147.769	It's still very, very clunky.
149.318	CR: Tell me, when you look at what Google is doing,
151.684	where does Deep Mind fit?
154.653	LP: Yeah, so Deep Mind is a company
156.237	we just acquired recently.
158.768	It's in the U.K.
161.85	First, let me tell you the way we got there,
164.504	which was looking at search
166.732	and really understanding,
168.355	trying to understand everything,
170.588	and also make the computers not clunky
172.193	and really understand you --
174.394	like, voice was really important.
176.506	So what's the state of the art 
176.506	on speech recognition?
179.367	It's not very good.
181.027	It doesn't really understand you.
183.093	So we started doing machine learning research
185.096	to improve that.
186.633	That helped a lot.
188.336	And we started just looking at things like YouTube.
190.703	Can we understand YouTube?
192.671	But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube
195.357	and it discovered cats, just by itself.
199.442	Now, that's an important concept.
201.533	And we realized there's really something here.
204.524	If we can learn what cats are,
206.641	that must be really important.
208.716	So I think Deep Mind,
211.345	what's really amazing about Deep Mind
213.709	is that it can actually --
215.713	they're learning things in this unsupervised way.
219.27	They started with video games,
221.837	and really just, maybe I can show the video,
224.33	just playing video games,
226.534	and learning how to do that automatically.
228.549	CR: Take a look at the video games
230.401	and how machines are coming to be able
232.811	to do some remarkable things.
235.267	LP: The amazing thing about this
236.596	is this is, I mean, obviously,
238.276	these are old games,
239.75	but the system just sees what you see, the pixels,
244.548	and it has the controls and it has the score,
246.979	and it's learned to play all of these games,
249.19	same program.
250.769	It's learned to play all of these games
252.806	with superhuman performance.
254.592	We've not been able to do things like this
256.447	with computers before.
257.965	And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.
260.26	This is boxing, and it figures out it can
263.065	sort of pin the opponent down.
265.699	The computer's on the left,
267.438	and it's just racking up points.
270.523	So imagine if this kind
272.609	of intelligence were thrown at your schedule,
274.736	or your information needs, or things like that.
279.373	We're really just at the beginning of that,
281.991	and that's what I'm really excited about.
284.356	CR: When you look at all that's taken place
286.826	with Deep Mind and the boxing,
289.41	also a part of where we're going
291.75	is artificial intelligence.
294.639	Where are we, when you look at that?
297.438	LP: Well, I think for me,
299.223	this is kind of one of the most exciting things
300.726	I've seen in a long time.
302.638	The guy who started this company, Demis,
305.051	has a neuroscience and a
305.051	computer science background.
307.829	He went back to school
309.459	to get his Ph.D. to study the brain.
312.585	And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work
315.205	going on that sort of crosses computer science
318.286	and neuroscience
320.036	in terms of really understanding
322.361	what it takes to make something smart
324.815	and do really interesting things.
326.53	CR: But where's the level of it now?
328.668	And how fast do you think we are moving?
331.374	LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,
334.643	understanding cats on YouTube
336.774	and things like that,
338.057	improving voice recognition.
340.204	We used a lot of machine learning
342.622	to improve things incrementally,
345.101	but I think for me, this example's really exciting,
348.495	because it's one program
350.738	that can do a lot of different things.
352.782	CR: I don't know if we can do this,
353.92	but we've got the image of the cat.
355.105	It would be wonderful to see this.
356.859	This is how machines looked at cats
359.368	and what they came up with.
360.483	Can we see that image?
361.538	LP: Yeah.
361.538	CR: There it is. Can you see the cat?
363.94	Designed by machines, seen by machines.
365.967	LP: That's right.
367.077	So this is learned from just watching YouTube.
369.684	And there's no training,
371.551	no notion of a cat,
372.935	but this concept of a cat
375.496	is something important that you would understand,
378.304	and now that the machines can kind of understand.
380.827	Maybe just finishing
381.999	also on the search part,
384.221	it started with search, really understanding
387.007	people's context and their information.
389.571	I did have a video
391.431	I wanted to show quickly on that
393.441	that we actually found.
395.088	"(Video) [""Soy, Kenya""]"
400.58	Zack Matere: Not long ago,
402.452	I planted a crop of potatoes.
405.038	Then suddenly they started
405.038	dying one after the other.
408.438	I checked out the books and 
408.438	they didn't tell me much.
411.188	So, I went and I did a search.
413.134	"[""Zack Matere, Farmer""]"
417.609	Potato diseases.
420.756	One of the websites told me
422.484	that ants could be the problem.
424.386	It said, sprinkle wood ash over the plants.
426.657	Then after a few days the ants disappeared.
428.941	I got excited about the Internet.
431.535	I have this friend
433.2	who really would like to expand his business.
436.818	So I went with him to the cyber cafe
440.013	and we checked out several sites.
442.554	When I met him next, he was going to put a windmill
445.095	at the local school.
447.789	I felt proud because
449.393	something that wasn't there before
451.421	was suddenly there.
453.308	I realized that not everybody
455.998	can be able to access
457.532	what I was able to access.
459.018	I thought that I need to have an Internet
460.856	that my grandmother can use.
462.657	So I thought about a notice board.
465.114	A simple wooden notice board.
467.03	When I get information on my phone,
469.345	I'm able to post the information
471.582	on the notice board.
473.304	So it's basically like a computer.
476.162	I use the Internet to help people.
480.051	I think I am searching for
483.461	a better life
485.002	for me and my neighbors.
489.116	So many people have access to information,
493.1	but there's no follow-up to that.
495.681	I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.
498.189	When people have the knowledge,
499.795	they can find solutions
501.425	without having to helped out.
503.44	Information is powerful,
505.561	but it is how we use it that will define us.
510.163	(Applause)
514.544	LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,
517.09	actually, was we just read about it in the news,
518.556	and we found this gentlemen,
521.061	and made that little clip.
523.376	CR: When I talk to people about you,
524.767	they say to me, people who know you well, say,
527.372	Larry wants to change the world,
529.263	and he believes technology can show the way.
533.375	And that means access to the Internet.
535.233	It has to do with languages.
536.964	It also means how people can get access
539.793	and do things that will affect their community,
542.499	and this is an example.
544.992	LP: Yeah, that's right, and I think for me,
548.568	I have been focusing on access more,
550.95	if we're talking about the future.
553.148	We recently released this Loon Project
555.822	which is using balloons to do it.
558.122	It sounds totally crazy.
559.782	We can show the video here.
562.321	Actually, two out of three people in the world
563.801	don't have good Internet access now.
566.187	We actually think this can really help people
569.093	sort of cost-efficiently.
571.15	CR: It's a balloon.
571.15	LP: Yeah, get access to the Internet.
574.521	CR: And why does this balloon give you access
576.664	to the Internet?
577.877	Because there was some interesting things
579.092	you had to do to figure out how
580.926	to make balloons possible,
583.057	they didn't have to be tethered.
584.806	LP: Yeah, and this is a good example of innovation.
586.887	Like, we've been thinking about this idea
589.431	for five years or more
591.203	before we started working on it,
592.804	but it was just really,
594.123	how do we get access points up high, cheaply?
597.643	You normally have to use satellites
599.435	and it takes a long time to launch them.
602.374	But you saw there how easy it is to launch a balloon
604.868	and get it up,
606.387	and actually again, it's the power of the Internet,
608.388	I did a search on it,
610.168	and I found, 30, 40 years ago,
612.472	someone had put up a balloon
614.361	and it had gone around the Earth multiple times.
617.166	And I thought, why can't we do that today?
620.001	And that's how this project got going.
622.368	CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?
624.698	LP: Yeah, but it turns out,
626.82	we did some weather simulations
628.313	which probably hadn't really been done before,
630.86	and if you control the altitude of the balloons,
632.97	which you can do by pumping air into them
635.251	and other ways,
637.073	you can actually control roughly where they go,
640.002	and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh
642.207	of these balloons that can cover the whole planet.
645.546	CR: Before I talk about the future and transportation,
647.788	where you've been a nerd for a while,
649.683	and this fascination you have with transportation
652.107	and automated cars and bicycles,
654.17	let me talk a bit about what's been the subject here
655.907	earlier with Edward Snowden.
658.35	It is security and privacy.
661.456	You have to have been thinking about that.
663.796	LP: Yeah, absolutely.
665.15	I saw the picture of Sergey with
665.15	Edward Snowden yesterday.
667.993	Some of you may have seen it.
670.863	But I think, for me, I guess,
674.034	privacy and security are a really important thing.
677.696	We think about it in terms of both things,
679.941	and I think you can't have privacy without security,
682.844	so let me just talk about security first,
685.215	because you asked about Snowden and all of that,
687.811	and then I'll say a little bit about privacy.
690.252	I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing
694.052	that the government
695.491	secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.
697.821	I don't think we can have a democracy
701.124	if we're having to protect you and our users
704.554	from the government
706.25	for stuff that we've never had a conversation about.
709.053	And I don't mean we have to know
710.949	what the particular terrorist attack is they're worried
712.644	about protecting us from,
714.406	but we do need to know
716.204	what the parameters of it is,
718.614	what kind of surveillance the government's
720.658	going to do and how and why,
722.826	and I think we haven't had that conversation.
725.103	So I think the government's actually done
727.67	itself a tremendous disservice
729.838	by doing all that in secret.
731.999	CR: Never coming to Google
733.614	to ask for anything.
735.139	LP: Not Google, but the public.
737.169	I think we need to 
737.169	have a debate about that,
740.942	or we can't have a functioning democracy.
743.441	It's just not possible.
744.847	So I'm sad that Google's
747.091	in the position of protecting you and our users
749.707	from the government
751.241	doing secret thing that nobody knows about.
753.485	It doesn't make any sense.
755.232	CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.
758.222	LP: Yes. The privacy side,
760.649	I think it's -- the world is changing.
762.618	You carry a phone. It knows where you are.
766.523	There's so much more information about you,
769.608	and that's an important thing,
772.454	and it makes sense why people are asking
774.726	difficult questions.
776.762	We spend a lot of time thinking about this
780.129	and what the issues are.
782.84	I'm a little bit --
784.569	I think the main thing that we need to do
785.829	is just provide people choice,
788.191	show them what data's being collected --
790.703	search history, location data.
795.454	We're excited about incognito mode in Chrome,
798.226	and doing that in more ways,
800.475	just giving people more choice
801.871	and more awareness of what's going on.
805.164	I also think it's very easy.
807.557	What I'm worried is that we throw out
808.834	the baby with the bathwater.
810.924	And I look at, on your show, actually,
813.838	I kind of lost my voice,
815.557	and I haven't gotten it back.
816.888	I'm hoping that by talking to you
818.532	I'm going to get it back.
820.185	CR: If I could do anything, I would do that.
821.917	LP: All right. So get out your voodoo doll
824.097	and whatever you need to do.
826.516	But I think, you know what, I look at that,
828.844	I made that public,
830.674	and I got all this information.
831.891	We got a survey done on medical conditions
834.62	with people who have similar issues,
837.991	and I look at medical records, and I say,
842.732	wouldn't it be amazing
844.137	if everyone's medical records were available
846.187	anonymously
847.87	to research doctors?
850.506	And when someone accesses your medical record,
853.547	a research doctor,
855.156	they could see, you could see which doctor
857.79	accessed it and why,
859.65	and you could maybe learn about
861.23	what conditions you have.
862.86	I think if we just did that,
864.362	we'd save 100,000 lives this year.
866.527	CR: Absolutely. Let me go — (Applause)
869.475	LP: So I guess I'm just very worried that
872.237	with Internet privacy,
874.043	we're doing the same thing we're 
874.043	doing with medical records,
876.347	is we're throwing out the baby with the bathwater,
878.876	and we're not really thinking
880.704	about the tremendous good that can come
882.914	from people sharing information
885.105	with the right people in the right ways.
887.682	CR: And the necessary condition
889.919	that people have to have confidence
891.621	that their information will not be abused.
894.076	LP: Yeah, and I had this problem with my voice stuff.
895.853	I was scared to share it.
897.361	Sergey encouraged me to do that,
899.251	and it was a great thing to do.
901.078	CR: And the response has been overwhelming.
902.812	LP: Yeah, and people are super positive.
904.472	We got thousands and thousands of people
907.305	with similar conditions,
908.593	which there's no data on today.
911.621	So it was a really good thing.
912.977	CR: So talking about the future, what is it about you
915.996	and transportation systems?
919.754	LP: Yeah. I guess I was just frustrated
921.931	with this when I was at college in Michigan.
924.47	I had to get on the bus and take it
925.92	and wait for it.
927.562	And it was cold and snowing.
929.741	I did some research on how much it cost,
932.396	and I just became a bit obsessed
932.396	with transportation systems.
938.821	CR: And that began the idea of an automated car.
941.191	LP: Yeah, about 18 years ago I learned about
942.885	people working on automated cars,
946.067	and I became fascinated by that,
947.69	and it takes a while to 
947.69	get these projects going,
950.467	but I'm super excited about the possibilities of that
955.564	improving the world.
957.232	There's 20 million people or more injured per year.
961.758	It's the leading cause of death
963.744	for people under 34 in the U.S.
965.874	CR: So you're talking about saving lives.
967.425	LP: Yeah, and also saving space
969.78	and making life better.
973.695	Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads,
977.94	half of the area,
979.673	and most cities are not far behind, actually.
982.5	It's just crazy
984.064	that that's what we use our space for.
985.657	CR: And how soon will we be there?
988	LP: I think we can be there very, very soon.
989.926	We've driven well over 100,000 miles
993.427	now totally automated.
997.52	I'm super excited about getting that out quickly.
1001.172	CR: But it's not only you're
1001.172	talking about automated cars.
1003.577	You also have this idea for bicycles.
1005.963	LP: Well at Google, we got this idea
1008.209	that we should just provide free bikes to everyone,
1011.66	and that's been amazing, most of the trips.
1014.428	You see bikes going everywhere,
1016.014	and the bikes wear out.
1017.58	They're getting used 24 hours a day.
1019.034	CR: But you want to put them above the street, too.
1021.194	LP: Well I said, how do we get people
1022.769	using bikes more?
1024.296	CR: We may have a video here.
1025.921	LP: Yeah, let's show the video.
1027.199	I just got excited about this.
1030.291	(Music)
1036.213	So this is actually how you might separate
1038.638	bikes from cars with minimal cost.
1046.711	Anyway, it looks totally crazy,
1048.466	but I was actually thinking about our campus,
1050.793	working with the Zippies and stuff,
1052.853	and just trying to get a lot more bike usage,
1055.151	and I was thinking about,
1056.699	how do you cost-effectively separate
1059.53	the bikes from traffic?
1060.944	And I went and searched,
1062.094	and this is what I found.
1063.465	And we're not actually working on this,
1065.31	that particular thing,
1066.602	but it gets your imagination going.
1068.656	CR: Let me close with this.
1070.42	Give me a sense of the philosophy 
1070.42	of your own mind.
1072.765	You have this idea of [Google X].
1075.253	You don't simply want
1078.249	to go in some small, measurable arena of progress.
1083.845	LP: Yeah, I think
1085.558	many of the things we just 
1085.558	talked about are like that,
1087.689	where they're really --
1090.641	I almost use the economic concept of additionality,
1094.271	which means that you're doing something
1096.461	that wouldn't happen unless 
1096.461	you were actually doing it.
1099.409	And I think the more you can do things like that,
1102.549	the bigger impact you have,
1104.62	and that's about doing things
1107.61	that people might not think are possible.
1111.217	And I've been amazed,
1113.046	the more I learn about technology,
1115.275	the more I realize I don't know,
1117.471	and that's because this technological horizon,
1120.808	the thing that you can see to do next,
1123.705	the more you learn about technology,
1125.545	the more you learn what's possible.
1128.147	You learn that the balloons are possible
1130.393	because there's some material
1130.393	that will work for them.
1132.73	CR: What's interesting about 
1132.73	you too, though, for me,
1135.109	is that, we have lots of people
1136.82	who are thinking about the future,
1138.962	and they are going and looking
1138.962	and they're coming back,
1142.23	but we never see the implementation.
1144.357	I think of somebody you knew
1145.962	and read about, Tesla.
1148.869	The principle of that for you is what?
1152.673	LP: Well, I think invention is not enough.
1154.458	If you invent something,
1155.679	Tesla invented electric power that we use,
1158.874	but he struggled to get it out to people.
1161.535	That had to be done by other people.
1163.219	It took a long time.
1164.845	And I think if we can actually combine both things,
1168.712	where we have an innovation and invention focus,
1172.243	plus the ability to really -- a company
1175.215	that can really commercialize things
1177.213	and get them to people
1178.843	in a way that's positive for the world
1180.918	and to give people hope.
1182.974	You know, I'm amazed with the Loon Project
1185.748	just how excited people were about that,
1188.534	because it gave them hope
1190.348	for the two thirds of the world
1191.969	that doesn't have Internet right now that's any good.
1194.695	CR: Which is a second thing about corporations.
1196.817	You are one of those people who believe
1199.293	that corporations are an agent of change
1201.61	if they are run well.
1203.081	LP: Yeah. I'm really dismayed
1204.902	most people think companies are basically evil.
1208.196	They get a bad rap.
1209.962	And I think that's somewhat correct.
1212.203	Companies are doing the same incremental thing
1215.073	that they did 50 years ago
1216.836	or 20 years ago.
1218.467	That's not really what we need.
1219.837	We need, especially in technology,
1222.055	we need revolutionary change,
1224.172	not incremental change.
1225.585	CR: You once said, actually,
1226.754	as I think I've got this about right,
1228.572	that you might consider,
1230.217	rather than giving your money,
1231.97	if you were leaving it to some cause,
1235.29	just simply giving it to Elon Musk,
1237.296	because you had confidence
1238.459	that he would change the future,
1240.301	and that you would therefore —
1242.078	LP: Yeah, if you want to go Mars,
1243.662	he wants to go to Mars,
1245.383	to back up humanity,
1247.354	that's a worthy goal, but it's a company,
1249.026	and it's philanthropical.
1251.581	So I think we aim to do kind of similar things.
1254.533	And I think, you ask, we have a lot of employees
1257.52	at Google who have become pretty wealthy.
1260.835	People make a lot of money in technology.
1263.355	A lot of people in the room are pretty wealthy.
1265.511	You're working because you
1265.511	want to change the world.
1267.825	You want to make it better.
1269.587	Why isn't the company that you work for
1273.032	worthy not just of your time
1274.975	but your money as well?
1277.126	I mean, but we don't have a concept of that.
1278.848	That's not how we think about companies,
1281.152	and I think it's sad,
1282.619	because companies are most of our effort.
1286.386	They're where most of people's time is,
1288.901	where a lot of the money is,
1290.755	and so I think I'd like for us to help out
1293.107	more than we are.
1294.233	CR: When I close conversations with lots of people,
1295.954	I always ask this question:
1297.733	What state of mind,
1299.248	what quality of mind is it
1301.057	that has served you best?
1302.824	People like Rupert Murdoch have said curiosity,
1305.345	and other people in the media have said that.
1307.973	Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have said focus.
1310.997	What quality of mind,
1312.424	as I leave this audience,
1313.798	has enabled you to think about the future
1317.328	and at the same time
1318.975	change the present?
1321.18	LP: You know, I think the most important thing --
1322.85	I looked at lots of companies
1324.462	and why I thought they don't succeed over time.
1327.765	We've had a more rapid turnover of companies.
1330.598	And I said, what did they fundamentally do wrong?
1333.367	What did those companies all do wrong?
1335.534	And usually it's just that they missed the future.
1338.806	And so I think, for me,
1341.25	I just try to focus on that and say,
1343.674	what is that future really going to be
1345.858	and how do we create it,
1347.645	and how do we cause our organization,
1352.312	to really focus on that
1354.752	and drive that at a really high rate?
1358.077	And so that's been curiosity,
1359.437	it's been looking at things
1361.17	people might not think about,
1362.888	working on things that no one else is working on,
1365.993	because that's where the additionality really is,
1369.299	and be willing to do that,
1370.85	to take that risk.
1372.232	Look at Android.
1373.297	I felt guilty about working on Android
1376.082	when it was starting.
1377.398	It was a little startup we bought.
1379.356	It wasn't really what we were really working on.
1382.026	And I felt guilty about spending time on that.
1384.521	That was stupid.
1385.975	That was the future, right?
1387.026	That was a good thing to be working on.
1389.311	CR: It is great to see you here.
1390.728	It's great to hear from you,
1392.188	and a pleasure to sit at this table with you.
1394.485	Thanks, Larry.
1395.413	LP: Thank you.
1397.516	(Applause)
1401.448	CR: Larry Page.
