19.706	and I'm turning 50 in one month.
22.887	That means I was born in 1964
22.887	in a small town in Germany.
28.437	It was a gray November day,
30.155	and I was overdue.
32.035	The hospital's maternity ward
32.035	was really stressed out
35.518	because a lot of babies were born
35.518	on this gray November day.
40.023	As a matter of fact,
	birth rate ever in Germany:
46.571	more than 1.3 million.
48.591	Last year, we just hit over 600,000,
51.725	so half of my number.
53.49	What you can see here
53.49	is the German age pyramid,
57.321	and there, the small black point
57.321	at the top, that's me.
60.13	(Laughter) (Applause)
66.307	In red, you can see the potential
66.307	working-age population,
70.44	so people over 15 and under 65,
74.689	and I'm actually only interested
74.689	in this red area.
78.404	Now, let's do a simple simulation
80.447	of how this age structure will develop
80.447	over the next couple of years.
84.975	As you can see,
86.414	the peak is moving to the right,
88.713	and I, with many other baby boomers,
88.713	will retire in 2030.
95.238	By the way, I don't need any forecasts
97.513	of birth rates for predicting
97.513	this red area.
100.406	The red area,
101.678	so the potential
101.678	working-age population in 2030,
105.291	is already set in stone today,
108.589	except for much higher migration rates.
112.141	And if you compare this red area in 2030
112.141	with the red area in 2014,
118.271	it is much, much smaller.
121.382	So before I show you
121.382	the rest of the world,
123.82	what does this mean for Germany?
127.117	So what we know from
127.117	this picture is that the labor supply,
131.204	so people who provide labor,
133.131	will go down in Germany,
133.131	and will go down significantly.
136.8	Now, what about labor demand?
139.4	That's where it gets tricky.
142.163	As you might know, the consultant's
142.163	favorite answer to any question is,
146.97	"""It depends."""
148.711	So I would say it depends.
151.079	We didn't want to forecast the future.
153.448	Highly speculative.
154.957	We did something else.
156.513	We looked at the GDP
156.513	and productivity growth of Germany
159.903	over the last 20 years,
161.598	and calculated the following scenario:
164.082	if Germany wants to continue
164.082	this GDP and productivity growth,
168.563	we could directly calculate
170.676	how many people Germany would need
170.676	to support this growth.
174.647	And this is the green line: labor demand.
177.619	So Germany will run into
177.619	a major talent shortage very quickly.
183.331	Eight million people are missing,
185.165	which is more than 20 percent
185.165	of our current workforce,
187.928	so big numbers, really big numbers.
190.598	And we calculated several scenarios,
192.711	and the picture always looked like this.
196.565	Now, to close the gap,
198.446	Germany has to significantly
198.446	increase migration,
202.509	get many more women in the workforce,
204.715	increase retirement age —
206.48	by the way, we just
206.48	lowered it this year —
208.895	and all these measures at once.
211.658	If Germany fails here,
211.658	Germany will stagnate.
215.721	We won't grow anymore. Why?
218.043	Because the workers are not there
218.043	who can generate this growth.
221.456	And companies will look
221.456	for talents somewhere else.
225.913	But where?
228.73	Now, we simulated labor supply
228.73	and labor demand
232.776	for the largest 15 economies in the world,
235.945	representing more than 70 percent
235.945	of world GDP,
239.637	and the overall picture
239.637	looks like this by 2020.
243.584	Blue indicates a labor surplus,
246.277	red indicates a labor shortfall,
248.762	and gray are those countries
248.762	which are borderline.
252.454	So by 2020, we still see a labor surplus
252.454	in some countries,
258.56	like Italy, France, the U.S.,
260.743	but this picture will change
260.743	dramatically by 2030.
265.34	By 2030, we will face
265.34	a global workforce crisis
269.961	in most of our largest economies,
272.956	including three
272.956	out of the four BRIC countries.
275.371	China, with its former
275.371	one-child policy, will be hit,
278.529	as well as Brazil and Russia.
282.453	Now, to tell the truth,
286.168	in reality, the situation
286.168	will be even more challenging.
290.974	What you can see here are average numbers.
294.317	We de-averaged them
296.013	and broke them down
296.013	into different skill levels,
298.633	and what we found
299.95	were even higher shortfalls
299.95	for high-skilled people
303.884	and a partial surplus
303.884	for low-skilled workers.
308.063	So on top of an overall labor shortage,
311.221	we will face a big
311.221	skill mismatch in the future,
315.477	and this means huge challenges
317.2	in terms of education, qualification,
319.289	upskilling for governments and companies.
324.397	Now, the next thing we looked into
324.397	was robots, automation, technology.
330.375	Will technology change this picture
330.375	and boost productivity?
335.728	Now, the short answer would be
337.798	that our numbers already include
337.798	a significant growth in productivity
342.359	driven by technology.
345.093	A long answer would go like this.
348.628	Let's take Germany again.
351.113	The Germans have
351.113	a certain reputation in the world
353.667	when it comes to productivity.
356.244	In the '90s, I worked in our Boston office
356.244	for almost two years,
360.841	and when I left, an old senior partner
360.841	told me, literally,
364.998	"""Send me more of these Germans,"
364.998	"they work like machines."""
368.48	(Laughter)
372.967	That was 1998.
376.259	Sixteen years later,
376.259	you'd probably say the opposite.
379.742	"""Send me more of these machines."
379.742	"They work like Germans."""
383.41	(Laughter) (Applause)
390.108	Technology will replace
390.108	a lot of jobs, regular jobs.
394.811	Not only in the production industry,
396.808	but even office workers are in jeopardy
398.69	and might be replaced by robots,
401.521	artificial intelligence,
401.521	big data, or automation.
405.12	So the key question is not
405.12	if technology replaces some of these jobs,
410.042	but when, how fast, and to what extent?
413.688	Or in other words,
415.383	will technology help us
415.383	to solve this global workforce crisis?
421.334	Yes and no.
423.254	This is a more sophisticated
423.254	"version of ""it depends."""
426.156	(Laughter)
427.227	Let's take the automotive industry
427.227	as an example,
432.31	because there, more than 40 percent
432.31	of industrial robots are already working
436.814	and automation has already taken place.
441.332	In 1980, less than 10 percent
441.332	of the production cost of a car
446.659	was caused by electronic parts.
449.329	Today, this number is more than 30 percent
452.58	and it will grow
452.58	to more than 50 percent by 2030.
457.427	And these new electronic parts
457.427	and applications
461.632	require new skills
461.632	and have created a lot of new jobs,
465.652	like the cognitive systems engineer
468.223	who optimizes the interaction
468.223	between driver and electronic system.
474.081	In 1980, no one had the slightest clue
474.081	that such a job would ever exist.
481.534	As a matter of fact,
483.051	the overall number of people
483.051	involved in the production of a car
487.246	has only changed slightly
487.246	in the last decades,
490.659	in spite of robots and automation.
493.677	So what does this mean?
495.443	Yes, technology
495.443	will replace a lot of jobs,
497.88	but we will also see a lot of new jobs
497.88	and new skills on the horizon,
503.731	and that means technology will worsen
503.731	our overall skill mismatch.
509.768	And this kind of de-averaging
511.51	reveals the crucial challenge
511.51	for governments and businesses.
517.175	So people, high-skilled people,
521.006	talents, will be the big thing
521.006	in the next decade.
525.046	If they are the scarce resource,
525.046	we have to understand them much better.
530.688	Are they actually willing to work abroad?
533.637	What are their job preferences?
536.552	To find out, this year we conducted
536.552	a global survey
541.617	among more than 200,000 job seekers
541.617	from 189 countries.
548.021	Migration is certainly
548.021	one key measure to close a gap,
553.469	at least in the short term,
555.013	so we asked about mobility.
557.613	More than 60 percent
557.613	of these 200,000 job seekers
562.234	are willing to work abroad.
564.834	For me, a surprisingly high number.
566.994	If you look at the employees
566.994	aged 21 to 30,
570.407	this number is even higher.
572.706	If you split this number up by country,
576.026	yes, the world is mobile, but only partly.
581.227	The least mobile countries
581.227	are Russia, Germany and the U.S.
586.358	Now where would these people like to move?
589.632	Number seven is Australia,
589.632	where 28 percent could imagine moving.
594.462	Then France, Switzerland,
594.462	Germany, Canada, U.K.,
598.804	and the top choice
598.804	worldwide is the U.S.
602.744	Now, what are the job preferences
602.744	of these 200,000 people?
606.263	So, what are they looking for?
609.043	Out of a list of 26 topics,
609.043	salary is only number eight.
615.475	The top four topics
615.475	are all around culture.
620.003	Number four,
621.558	having a great relationship with the boss;
624.554	three, enjoying a great work-life balance;
628.571	two, having a great relationship
628.571	with colleagues;
632.332	and the top priority worldwide
635.751	is being appreciated for your work.
640.321	So, do I get a thank you?
643.152	Not only once a year
643.152	with the annual bonus payment,
646.496	but every day.
648.701	And now, our global workforce crisis
648.701	becomes very personal.
653.926	People are looking for recognition.
656.967	Aren't we all looking
656.967	for recognition in our jobs?
663.302	Now, let me connect the dots.
666.882	We will face a global workforce crisis
669.25	which consists
669.25	of an overall labor shortage
672.222	plus a huge skill mismatch,
674.173	plus a big cultural challenge.
677.307	And this global workforce crisis
677.307	is approaching very fast.
681.231	Right now, we are
681.231	just at the turning point.
683.971	So what can we, what can governments,
683.971	what can companies do?
688.359	Every company,
689.962	but also every country,
691.749	needs a people strategy,
693.677	and to act on it immediately,
696.649	and such a people strategy
696.649	consists of four parts.
700.596	Number one, a plan
702.407	for how to forecast supply and demand
702.407	for different jobs and different skills.
708.537	Workforce planning will become 
708.537	more important than financial planning.
714.109	Two, a plan for
714.109	how to attract great people:
717.732	generation Y, women, but also retirees.
721.865	Three, a plan for how to educate
721.865	and upskill them.
725.878	There's a huge
725.878	upskilling challenge ahead of us.
729.666	And four,
731.5	for how to retain the best people,
734.053	or in other words,
735.423	how to realize an appreciation
735.423	and relationship culture.
743.643	However, one crucial underlying factor
743.643	is to change our attitudes.
750.424	Employees are resources, are assets,
754.627	not costs, not head counts,
757.096	not machines,
758.505	not even the Germans.
760.176	Thank you.
761.302	(Applause)
