12.8	In India, we have these huge families.
15.84	I bet a lot of you all
15.84	must have heard about it.
18.44	Which means that there are
18.44	a lot of family events.
21.84	So as a child, my parents
21.84	used to drag me to these family events.
26.36	But the one thing
26.36	that I always looked forward to
29.4	was playing around with my cousins.
32.16	And there was always this one uncle
34.48	who used to be there,
35.76	always ready, jumping around with us,
37.64	having games for us,
39.16	making us kids have the time of our lives.
42.92	This man was extremely successful:
45.28	he was confident and powerful.
47.92	But then I saw this hale and hearty person
47.92	deteriorate in health.
53.24	He was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
56.76	Parkinson's is a disease that causes
56.76	degeneration of the nervous system,
60.84	which means that this person
60.84	who used to be independent
63.84	suddenly finds tasks like drinking coffee,
63.84	because of tremors, much more difficult.
69.8	My uncle started using a walker to walk,
72.48	and to take a turn,
73.72	he literally had to take
73.72	one step at a time, like this,
77.8	and it took forever.
80.24	So this person, who used to be
80.24	the center of attention
83.44	in every family gathering,
85.52	was suddenly hiding behind people.
88.4	He was hiding from the pitiful look
88.4	in people's eyes.
92.44	And he's not the only one in the world.
95.28	Every year, 60,000 people
95.28	are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's,
100.8	and this number is only rising.
104.36	As designers, we dream that our designs
104.36	solve these multifaceted problems,
109.8	one solution that solves it all,
112.64	but it need not always be like that.
115.68	You can also target simple problems
118.52	and create small solutions for them
118.52	and eventually make a big impact.
123.12	So my aim here was
123.12	to not cure Parkinson's,
126.52	but to make their everyday tasks
126.52	much more simple,
129.72	and then make an impact.
132.04	Well, the first thing I targeted
132.04	was tremors, right?
136.44	My uncle told me that he had stopped
136.44	drinking coffee or tea in public
141	just out of embarrassment,
143	so, well, I designed the no-spill cup.
147.08	It works just purely on its form.
149.96	The curve on top deflects the liquid
149.96	back inside every time they have tremors,
155.24	and this keeps the liquid inside
155.24	compared to a normal cup.
158.8	But the key here is that it is not tagged
158.8	as a Parkinson's patient product.
164.04	It looks like a cup that could be used
164.04	by you, me, any clumsy person,
168.48	and that makes it much more comforting
168.48	for them to use, to blend in.
173.92	So, well, one problem solved,
176.6	many more to go.
178.64	All this while, I was interviewing him,
181.08	questioning him,
182.64	and then I realized that I was getting
182.64	very superficial information,
186.36	or just answers to my questions.
189.2	But I really needed to dig deeper
189.2	to get a new perspective.
193	So I thought, well,
193	let's observe him in his daily tasks,
196.76	while he's eating, while he's watching TV.
199.8	And then, when I was actually
199.8	observing him walking to his dining table,
203.88	it struck me, this man who finds it
203.88	so difficult to walk on flat land,
209.08	how does he climb a staircase?
211.32	Because in India we do not have
211.32	a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase
215.04	like in the developed countries.
217.08	One actually has to climb the stairs.
219.92	So he told me,
221.2	"""Well, let me show you how I do it."""
223.88	Let's take a look at what I saw.
228.96	So he took really long
228.96	to reach this position,
231.64	and then all this while, I'm thinking,
233.52	"""Oh my God, is he really going to do it?"
235.48	Is he really, really going to do it
235.48	"without his walker?"""
238.4	And then ...
242.28	(Laughter)
248.68	And the turns, he took them so easily.
253.24	So -- shocked?
254.92	Well, I was too.
259.32	So this person who could not
259.32	walk on flat land
262.32	was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs.
265.72	On researching this, I realized that
265.72	it's because it's a continuous motion.
270.399	There's this other man
270.399	who also suffers from the same symptoms
273.56	and uses a walker,
275	but the moment he's put on a cycle,
277.12	all his symptoms vanish,
278.84	because it is a continuous motion.
281.56	So the key for me was to translate
281.56	this feeling of walking on a staircase
285.88	back to flat land.
287.88	And a lot of ideas
287.88	were tested and tried on him,
290.84	but the one that finally worked
290.84	was this one. Let's take a look.
297.44	(Laughter)
300.52	(Applause)
305	He walked faster, right?
306.48	(Applause)
311.24	I call this the staircase illusion,
314.04	and actually when the staircase illusion
314.04	abruptly ended, he froze,
318.64	and this is called freezing of gait.
320.68	So it happens a lot,
321.92	so why not have a staircase illusion
321.92	flowing through all their rooms,
325.88	making them feel much more confident?
329.44	You know, technology is not always it.
332.12	What we need are human-centered solutions.
334.92	I could have easily
334.92	made it into a projection,
337.16	or a Google Glass, or something like that.
339.52	But I stuck to simple print on the floor.
342.36	This print could be taken into hospitals
345.32	to make them feel much more welcome.
348.6	What I wish to do
348.6	is make every Parkinson's patient
351.72	feel like my uncle felt that day.
354.2	He told me that I made him feel
354.2	like his old self again.
359.12	"""Smart"" in today's world"
359.12	has become synonymous to high tech,
363.96	and the world is only getting
363.96	smarter and smarter day by day.
367.8	But why can't smart be something
367.8	that's simple and yet effective?
372.32	All we need is a little bit of empathy
372.32	and some curiosity,
376.32	to go out there, observe.
378.6	But let's not stop at that.
380.52	Let's find these complex problems.
380.52	Don't be scared of them.
384.2	Break them, boil them down
384.2	into much smaller problems,
387.8	and then find simple solutions for them.
390.32	Test these solutions, fail if needed,
393.36	but with newer insights to make it better.
396.24	Imagine what we all could do
396.24	if we all came up with simple solutions.
400.52	What would the world be like
400.52	if we combined all our simple solutions?
404.88	Let's make a smarter world,
404.88	but with simplicity.
407.92	Thank you.
409.16	(Applause)
