15.26	I have a question for you:
18.26	Are you religious?
20.26	Please raise your hand right now
22.26	if you think of yourself as a religious person.
25.26	Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
28.26	I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
31.26	(Laughter)
33.26	Okay, here's another question:
35.26	Do you think of yourself as spiritual
37.26	in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
39.26	Okay, that's the majority.
42.26	My Talk today
44.26	is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
46.26	why most people consider themselves
48.26	to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
50.26	My Talk today is about self-transcendence.
53.26	It's just a basic fact about being human
56.26	that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
59.26	And when that happens,
61.26	the feeling is ecstatic
64.26	and we reach for metaphors of up and down
66.26	to explain these feelings.
68.26	We talk about being uplifted
70.26	or elevated.
72.26	Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this
75.26	without a good concrete metaphor.
77.26	So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
80.26	Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,
83.26	most of which we're very familiar with.
86.26	But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears
89.26	from out of nowhere
91.26	and it opens onto a staircase.
94.26	We climb the staircase
96.26	and experience a state of altered consciousness.
100.26	In 1902,
102.26	the great American psychologist William James
104.26	wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
107.26	He collected all kinds of case studies.
109.26	He quoted the words of all kinds of people
111.26	who'd had a variety of these experiences.
113.26	One of the most exciting to me
115.26	is this young man, Stephen Bradley,
117.26	had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
120.26	And here's what Bradley said about it.
126.26	(Music)
129.26	(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape
132.26	for about one second in the room,
134.26	with arms extended,
136.26	"appearing to say to me, ""Come."""
139.26	The next day I rejoiced with trembling.
142.26	My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
145.26	This world had no place in my affections.
148.26	Previous to this time,
150.26	I was very selfish and self-righteous.
152.26	But now I desired the welfare of all mankind
155.26	and could, with a feeling heart,
157.26	forgive my worst enemies.
161.26	JH: So note
163.26	how Bradley's petty, moralistic self
165.26	just dies on the way up the staircase.
167.26	And on this higher level
169.26	he becomes loving and forgiving.
173.26	The world's many religions have found so many ways
175.26	to help people climb the staircase.
177.26	Some shut down the self using meditation.
179.26	Others use psychedelic drugs.
181.26	This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll
185.26	showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom
188.26	and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
192.26	Others use dancing, spinning and circling
194.26	to promote self-transcendence.
196.26	But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
199.26	Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
202.26	Others overcome their self at raves.
205.26	But here's the weirdest place of all:
208.26	war.
210.26	So many books about war say the same thing,
212.26	that nothing brings people together
214.26	like war.
216.26	And that bringing them together opens up the possibility
219.26	of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
222.26	I'm going to play for you an excerpt
224.26	from this book by Glenn Gray.
226.26	Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
229.26	And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers
232.26	and wrote about the experience of men in battle.
234.26	Here's a key passage
236.26	where he basically describes the staircase.
241.26	(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit
243.26	that the experience of communal effort in battle
246.26	has been the high point of their lives.
249.26	"""I"" passes insensibly into a ""we,"""
252.26	"""my"" becomes ""our"""
254.26	and individual faith
256.26	loses its central importance.
259.26	I believe that it is nothing less
261.26	than the assurance of immortality
264.26	that makes self-sacrifice at these moments
267.26	so relatively easy.
270.26	I may fall, but I do not die,
273.26	for that which is real in me goes forward
276.26	and lives on in the comrades
278.26	for whom I gave up my life.
282.26	JH: So what all of these cases have in common
285.26	is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,
288.26	and it feels good, it feels really good,
290.26	in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
293.26	It feels somehow uplifting.
296.26	This idea that we move up was central in the writing
299.26	of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
302.26	Durkheim even called us Homo duplex,
304.26	or two-level man.
306.26	The lower level he called the level of the profane.
309.26	Now profane is the opposite of sacred.
312.26	It just means ordinary or common.
314.26	And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
317.26	We want to satisfy our individual desires.
320.26	We pursue our individual goals.
322.26	But sometimes something happens
324.26	that triggers a phase change.
326.26	Individuals unite
328.26	into a team, a movement or a nation,
331.26	which is far more than the sum of its parts.
334.26	Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred
337.26	because he believed that the function of religion
339.26	was to unite people into a group,
341.26	into a moral community.
344.26	Durkheim believed that anything that unites us
347.26	takes on an air of sacredness.
349.26	And once people circle around
351.26	some sacred object or value,
353.26	they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
356.26	Durkheim wrote
358.26	about a set of intense collective emotions
360.26	that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,
363.26	of making a group out of individuals.
365.26	Think of the collective joy in Britain
368.26	on the day World War II ended.
371.26	Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,
374.26	which brought down a dictator.
377.26	And think of the collective grief
379.26	in the United States
381.26	that we all felt, that brought us all together,
384.26	after 9/11.
387.26	So let me summarize where we are.
390.26	I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence
392.26	is just a basic part of being human.
395.26	I'm offering the metaphor
397.26	of a staircase in the mind.
399.26	I'm saying we are Homo duplex
401.26	and this staircase takes us up from the profane level
404.26	to the level of the sacred.
406.26	When we climb that staircase,
408.26	self-interest fades away,
410.26	we become just much less self-interested,
412.26	and we feel as though we are better, nobler
414.26	and somehow uplifted.
417.26	So here's the million-dollar question
420.26	for social scientists like me:
422.26	Is the staircase
424.26	a feature of our evolutionary design?
427.26	Is it a product of natural selection,
430.26	like our hands?
432.26	Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system --
435.26	this religious stuff is just something
437.26	that happens when the wires cross in the brain --
440.26	Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,
442.26	it's just a mistake?
444.26	Well many scientists who study religion take this view.
448.26	The New Atheists, for example,
450.26	argue that religion is a set of memes,
452.26	sort of parasitic memes,
454.26	that get inside our minds
456.26	and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,
459.26	self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
461.26	And after all,
463.26	how could it ever be good for us
465.26	to lose ourselves?
467.26	How could it ever be adaptive
469.26	for any organism
471.26	to overcome self-interest?
474.26	Well let me show you.
476.26	"In ""The Descent of Man,"""
478.26	Charles Darwin wrote a great deal
480.26	about the evolution of morality --
482.26	where did it come from, why do we have it.
485.26	Darwin noted that many of our virtues
487.26	are of very little use to ourselves,
489.26	but they're of great use to our groups.
491.26	He wrote about the scenario
493.26	in which two tribes of early humans
495.26	would have come in contact and competition.
497.26	"He said, ""If the one tribe included"
500.26	a great number of courageous, sympathetic
502.26	and faithful members
504.26	who are always ready to aid and defend each other,
506.26	this tribe would succeed better
508.26	"and conquer the other."""
510.26	"He went on to say that ""Selfish and contentious people"
512.26	will not cohere,
514.26	and without coherence
516.26	"nothing can be effected."""
518.26	In other words,
520.26	Charles Darwin believed
522.26	in group selection.
524.26	Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,
527.26	but it's about to make a major comeback this year,
530.26	especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,
533.26	making a very strong case
535.26	that we, and several other species,
537.26	are products of group selection.
539.26	But really the way to think about this
541.26	is as multilevel selection.
543.26	So look at it this way:
545.26	You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
548.26	So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
551.26	Within this team
553.26	there's competition.
555.26	There are guys competing with each other.
557.26	The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
560.26	And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
562.26	Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
565.26	So within the team,
567.26	their interests are actually pitted against each other.
570.26	And sometimes it would be advantageous
572.26	for one of these guys
574.26	to try to sabotage the other guys.
576.26	Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival
578.26	to the coach.
580.26	But while that competition is going on
582.26	within the boat,
584.26	this competition is going on across boats.
587.26	And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,
590.26	now they've got no choice but to cooperate
592.26	because they're all in the same boat.
595.26	They can only win
597.26	if they all pull together as a team.
599.26	I mean, these things sound trite,
601.26	but they are deep evolutionary truths.
603.26	The main argument against group selection
605.26	has always been
607.26	that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,
610.26	but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,
612.26	they're just going to get taken over by free-riders,
615.26	individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
618.26	Let me illustrate this for you.
620.26	Suppose we've got a group of little organisms --
623.26	they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what --
626.26	and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
629.26	Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other,
631.26	they work together, they generate wealth.
634.26	And as you'll see in this simulation,
636.26	as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,
639.26	and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,
641.26	and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
643.26	But suppose then that one of them mutates.
646.26	There's a mutation in the gene
648.26	and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
650.26	It takes advantage of the others.
652.26	And so when a green interacts with a blue,
655.26	you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
657.26	So here's how things play out.
659.26	We start with just one green,
661.26	and as it interacts
663.26	it gains wealth or points or food.
666.26	And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
669.26	The free-riders have taken over.
672.26	If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem
675.26	then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation
678.26	and group selection cannot get started.
681.26	But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
683.26	It's not that hard a problem.
685.26	In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
688.26	And nature's favorite solution
690.26	is to put everyone in the same boat.
693.26	For example,
695.26	why is it that the mitochondria in every cell
698.26	has its own DNA,
700.26	totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
703.26	It's because they used to be
705.26	separate free-living bacteria
707.26	and they came together
709.26	and became a superorganism.
711.26	Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why --
714.26	but once they got a membrane around them,
716.26	they were all in the same membrane,
718.26	now all the wealth-created division of labor,
721.26	all the greatness created by cooperation,
723.26	stays locked inside the membrane
725.26	and we've got a superorganism.
728.26	And now let's rerun the simulation
730.26	putting one of these superorganisms
732.26	into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters
735.26	and look what happens.
738.26	A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
740.26	It's so big and powerful and efficient
743.26	that it can take resources
745.26	from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
749.26	And pretty soon the whole population
751.26	is actually composed of these new superorganisms.
754.26	What I've shown you here
756.26	is sometimes called a major transition
758.26	in evolutionary history.
761.26	Darwin's laws don't change,
763.26	but now there's a new kind of player on the field
766.26	and things begin to look very different.
769.26	Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature
771.26	that just happened with some bacteria.
773.26	It happened again
775.26	about 120 or a 140 million years ago
777.26	when some solitary wasps
780.26	began creating little simple, primitive
782.26	nests, or hives.
785.26	Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,
788.26	they had no choice but to cooperate,
790.26	because pretty soon they were locked into competition
792.26	with other hives.
794.26	And the most cohesive hives won,
796.26	just as Darwin said.
798.26	These early wasps
800.26	gave rise to the bees and the ants
802.26	that have covered the world
804.26	and changed the biosphere.
806.26	And it happened again,
808.26	even more spectacularly,
810.26	in the last half-million years
812.26	when our own ancestors
814.26	became cultural creatures,
816.26	they came together around a hearth or a campfire,
819.26	they divided labor,
821.26	they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,
824.26	and eventually they worshiped their own gods.
827.26	Once they were all in the same tribe,
829.26	they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
832.26	And they unlocked the most powerful force
834.26	ever known on this planet,
836.26	which is human cooperation --
838.26	a force for construction
840.26	and destruction.
843.26	Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive
845.26	as beehives.
847.26	Human groups may look like hives for brief moments,
850.26	but they tend to then break apart.
852.26	We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
855.26	In fact, often,
857.26	as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,
859.26	often those divisions are along religious lines.
863.26	Nonetheless, when people do come together
866.26	and put themselves all into the same movement,
868.26	they can move mountains.
871.26	Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
874.26	Do you think they're there
876.26	pursuing their self-interest?
878.26	Or are they pursuing communal interest,
881.26	which requires them to lose themselves
884.26	and become simply a part of a whole?
889.26	Okay, so that was my Talk
891.26	delivered in the standard TED way.
893.26	And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again
895.26	in three minutes
897.26	in a more full-spectrum sort of way.
900.26	(Music)
902.26	(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties
904.26	of religious experience,
906.26	as William James explained.
908.26	One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
911.26	and losing ourselves.
913.26	The staircase takes us
915.26	from the experience of life as profane or ordinary
918.26	upwards to the experience of life as sacred,
920.26	or deeply interconnected.
922.26	We are Homo duplex,
924.26	as Durkheim explained.
926.26	And we are Homo duplex
928.26	because we evolved by multilevel selection,
930.26	as Darwin explained.
933.26	I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation
935.26	rather than a bug,
937.26	but if it is an adaptation,
939.26	then the implications are profound.
941.26	If it is an adaptation,
943.26	then we evolved to be religious.
946.26	I don't mean that we evolved
948.26	to join gigantic organized religions.
950.26	Those things came along too recently.
952.26	I mean that we evolved
954.26	to see sacredness all around us
956.26	and to join with others into teams
958.26	and circle around sacred objects,
960.26	people and ideas.
962.26	This is why politics is so tribal.
965.26	Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,
968.26	but politics is also about sacredness.
971.26	It's about joining with others
973.26	to pursue moral ideas.
975.26	It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,
978.26	and we all believe we're on the good team.
981.26	And most importantly,
983.26	if the staircase is real,
985.26	it explains the persistent undercurrent
987.26	of dissatisfaction in modern life.
989.26	Because human beings are, to some extent,
992.26	hivish creatures like bees.
994.26	We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
997.26	We broke down the old institutions
1000.26	and brought liberty to the oppressed.
1002.26	We unleashed Earth-changing creativity
1004.26	and generated vast wealth and comfort.
1007.26	Nowadays we fly around
1009.26	like individual bees exulting in our freedom.
1011.26	But sometimes we wonder:
1013.26	Is this all there is?
1015.26	What should I do with my life?
1017.26	What's missing?
1019.26	What's missing is that we are Homo duplex,
1021.26	but modern, secular society was built
1024.26	to satisfy our lower, profane selves.
1027.26	It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
1030.26	Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
1033.26	One great challenge of modern life
1035.26	is to find the staircase amid all the clutter
1038.26	and then to do something good and noble
1041.26	once you climb to the top.
1044.26	I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
1047.26	They all want to find a cause or calling
1049.26	that they can throw themselves into.
1051.26	They're all searching for their staircase.
1054.26	And that gives me hope
1056.26	because people are not purely selfish.
1058.26	Most people long to overcome pettiness
1060.26	and become part of something larger.
1062.26	And this explains the extraordinary resonance
1065.26	of this simple metaphor
1067.26	conjured up nearly 400 years ago.
1070.26	"""No man is an island"
1072.26	entire of itself.
1074.26	Every man is a piece of the continent,
1077.26	"a part of the main."""
1080.26	JH: Thank you.
1082.26	(Applause)
