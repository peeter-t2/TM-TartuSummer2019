12.51	So, imagine that you take
12.51	a 19-hour, very long drive
19.842	to Disney World,
21.186	with two kids in the back seat.
24.076	And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,
30.351	the immutable laws of nature dictate
33.089	that you get the question:
35.169	"""Are we there yet?"""
36.557	(Laughter)
38.369	So you answer this question
38.369	a hundred more times, easily,
41.85	in the negative,
43.033	but you finally arrive.
44.457	You have a wonderful,
44.457	wonderful, wonderful trip.
47.254	You drive 19 long hours back home.
53.358	And when you get there,
54.919	the police are waiting on you.
57.041	They accuse you of committing a crime
59.453	that occurred while you
59.453	were away in Florida.
63.684	You tell anybody and everybody
63.684	who will listen,
66.59	"""I didn't do it!"
68.077	I couldn't have done it!
70.502	I was hanging out with Mickey
70.502	"and Minnie and my kids!"""
74.504	But no one believes you.
77.104	Ultimately, you're arrested,
79.624	you're tried,
80.891	you're convicted
82.215	and you are sentenced.
84.098	And you spend 25 years in jail,
88.054	until someone comes along and proves --
93.384	has the evidence to prove --
94.832	that you actually were in Florida
98.5	when this crime was committed.
101.626	So.
103.651	So, I'm a Harvard Law professor,
105.329	and the last several years,
105.329	I have worked on
110.105	winning the release of innocent people
113.193	who've been wrongfully convicted --
116.041	people like Jonathan Fleming,
118.582	who spent 24 years, eight months in jail
121.895	for a murder that was committed
121.895	in Brooklyn, New York,
125.517	while he was in Disney World
129.024	with his kids.
130.966	How do we know this?
132.702	Because when he was arrested,
135.108	among his property in his back pocket
138.686	was a receipt --
140.865	time-stamped receipt
142.706	that showed that he was in Disney World.
146.142	That receipt was put in the police file,
149.291	a copy of it was put
149.291	in the prosecutor's file,
151.941	and they never gave it
151.941	to his public defender.
155.197	In fact, nobody even knew it was there.
157.163	It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.
160.746	My team looked through the file,
160.746	and we found it,
165.227	did the rest of the investigation,
166.973	and figured out someone else
166.973	committed the crime.
169.284	Mr. Fleming was in Disney World,
172.448	and he is now released.
174.971	Let me give you a little bit of context.
177.622	So about three years ago, I got a call
177.622	from the Brooklyn District Attorney.
181.784	He asked whether I'd be interested
181.784	in designing a program
185.891	"called a ""conviction review unit."""
187.893	So I said yes.
189.198	A conviction review unit is essentially
189.198	a unit in a prosecutor's office
193.889	where prosecutors look at their past cases
197.03	to determine whether or not
197.03	they made mistakes.
200.285	Over the course of the first year,
202.341	we found about 13 wrongful convictions,
205.459	people having been in jail for decades,
208.018	and we released all of them.
209.677	It was the most in New York history.
212.379	The program is still going on,
213.895	and they're up to 21 releases now --
	significant time behind bars.
222.077	So let me tell you about a couple other
222.077	of the men and women
227.555	that I interacted with
227.555	in the course of this program.
230.863	One name is Roger Logan.
234.019	Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years
237.146	and wrote me a letter.
238.65	It was a simple letter; it basically said,
240.817	"""Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent."
240.817	I've been framed.
243.895	"Can you look at my case?"""
246.099	At first blush, the case seemed
246.099	like it was open and shut,
249.267	but my research had shown
252.312	that single-witness identification cases
254.959	are prone to error.
257.197	It doesn't mean he was innocent,
259.02	it just means we ought to look
259.02	a little bit closer at those cases.
262.361	So we did.
263.695	And the facts were relatively simple.
265.72	The eyewitness said she heard a shot,
268.826	and she ran to the next building
268.826	and turned around and looked,
271.901	and there was Mr. Logan.
274.252	And he was tried and convicted
274.252	and in jail for 17-some-odd years.
278.56	But it was a single-witness case,
278.56	so we took a look at it.
281.398	I sent some people to the scene,
281.398	and there was an inconsistency.
284.542	And to put it politely:
289.703	Usain Bolt couldn't have run
289.703	from where she said she was
293.386	to the other spot.
294.598	Right?
295.774	So we knew that wasn't true.
298.745	So it still didn't mean
298.745	that he didn't do it,
300.866	but we knew something was maybe fishy
300.866	about this witness.
305.454	So we looked through the file,
307.512	a piece of paper in the file
307.512	had a number on it.
309.875	The number indicated
309.875	that this witness had a record.
312.865	We went back through 20 years
312.865	of non-digitized papers
316.697	to figure out what this record was about,
319.297	and it turned out -- it turned out --
321.808	the eyewitness was in jail
325.34	when she said she saw what she saw.
329.538	The man spent 17 years behind bars.
333.296	The last one is a case about two boys,
338.087	Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.
340.822	They were arrested at 15,
343.14	and their conviction was vacated
348.685	Now this was a case,
350.503	once again -- first blush,
350.503	it looked open and shut.
353.331	They had confessed.
355.57	But my research showed
355.57	that juvenile confessions
358.345	without a parent present
359.858	are prone to error.
361.317	The DNA cases proved this several times.
363.607	So we took a close look.
365.528	We looked at the confession,
367.401	and it turned out,
368.589	there was something in the confession
370.475	that those boys could not have known.
372.467	The only people who knew it
372.467	were police and prosecutors.
375.222	We knew what really happened;
377.517	someone told them to say this.
379.1	We don't exactly know who,
380.993	which person did,
382.484	but any rate, the confession was coerced,
385.403	we determined.
387.242	We then went back and did forensics
389.098	and did a fulsome investigation
390.808	and found that two other,
392.228	much older, different heights,
392.228	different hairstyle,
395.111	two other people committed the crime,
397.469	not these two boys.
399.161	I actually went to court that day,
401.23	"for what's called a ""vacatur hearing,"""
404.796	where the conviction is thrown out.
406.931	I went to court; I wanted to see
409.281	Mr. McCallum walk out of there.
411.812	So I went to court,
412.99	and the judge said something
412.99	that judges say all the time,
415.783	but this took on a really special meaning.
418.513	He looked up after the arguments and said,
421.157	"""Mr. McCallum,"""
422.928	he said five beautiful words:
425.414	"""You are free to go."""
430.359	Can you imagine?
431.997	After just about 30 years:
435.135	"""You are free to go."""
438.545	And he walked out of that courtroom.
441.415	Unfortunately,
441.415	his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,
444.619	didn't get the benefit of that.
447.297	You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison
450	at 34 years old,
452.112	and his mother sat
452.112	at counsel table in his place.
456.718	I'll never forget this
456.718	the rest of my life.
459.3	She just rocked at the table, saying,
462.301	"""I knew my baby didn't do this."
464.285	"I knew my baby didn't do this."""
466.528	And her baby didn't do this.
468.633	Two other guys did it.
470.937	If there's anything that we've learned,
470.937	anything that I've learned,
474.247	with this conviction integrity work,
477.459	it's that justice doesn't happen.
481.599	People make justice happen.
488.261	Justice is not a thing
488.261	that just descends from above
492.18	and makes everything right.
494.422	If it did, Mr. Stuckey
494.422	wouldn't have died in prison.
499.576	Justice is something
501.323	that people of goodwill make happen.
505.705	Justice is a decision.
512.212	Justice is a decision.
515.281	We make justice happen.
518.126	You know, the scary thing is,
520.069	in each of these three cases I described,
522.71	it would have only taken
522.71	just an extra minute --
525.336	an extra minute --
526.975	for someone to look through the file
529.142	and find this receipt.
531.624	Just one -- to look through the file,
531.624	find the receipt,
535.504	give it to the public defender.
538.702	It would have taken someone just a minute
541.268	to look at the video confession
541.268	"and say, ""That cannot be."""
546.999	Just a minute.
549.524	And perhaps Mr. Stuckey
549.524	would be alive today.
553.271	It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.
556.676	It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays
556.676	would always recite,
560.983	"and he called it ""God's Minute."""
562.72	And it goes something like this:
564.317	"""I have only just a minute,"
566.458	only 60 seconds in it,
568.509	forced upon me, can't refuse it,
570.808	didn't seek it, didn't choose it.
573.098	But it's up to me to use it.
574.676	I must suffer if I lose it,
574.676	give account if I abuse it.
578.995	Just a tiny little minute,
581.925	"but eternity is in it."""
585.723	If I were to charge
587.297	each and every one of us,
589.754	I would want to say something like,
593.782	"""Every day,"
595.688	every day,
597.755	take just one extra minute
601.62	and do some justice.
604.752	You don't have to --
606.178	I mean, some people spend
606.178	their careers and their lives,
610.215	like public defenders,
611.477	doing justice every day.
614.026	But in your professional lives,
614.026	whatever you do,
616.37	take time out
618.084	to just
620.396	do some justice.
621.707	Make a colleague feel better.
623.903	If you hear something that's sexist,
627.208	don't laugh, speak up.
630.217	If someone is down, lift them up,
632.561	one extra minute each day,
636.073	and it'll be a great, great place.
638.419	I want to show you something.
641.777	Now, above me is a picture
644.776	of David McCallum.
647.173	This is the day
647.173	he was released from prison.
650.077	After 30 years, he got to hug a niece
653.158	he had never been able to touch before.
657.198	And I asked him then,
659.383	"I said, ""What's the first thing"
659.383	"you want to do?"""
662.106	"And he said, ""I just want"
662.106	to walk on the sidewalk
664.509	"without anybody telling me where to go."""
667.29	Wasn't bitter,
669.019	just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.
671.655	I spoke to Mr. McCallum
671.655	about two weeks ago.
675.189	I went to New York.
676.387	It was on the two-year anniversary
679.174	of his release.
681.1	And we talked,
682.764	we laughed, we hugged, we cried.
685.855	And he's doing quite well.
688.084	And one of the things he said
688.084	when we met with him
691.994	is that he now has dedicated his life
695.148	and his career
696.541	to ensuring that nobody else
696.541	is locked up unjustly.
701.771	Justice, my friends,
705.416	is a decision.
707.346	Thank you very much.
708.577	(Applause)
