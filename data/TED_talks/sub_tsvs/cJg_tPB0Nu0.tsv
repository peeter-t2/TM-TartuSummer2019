14.134	When I was a kid,
15.317	I experienced something so powerful,
17.849	I spent the rest of my life
17.849	searching for it,
20.947	and in all the wrong places.
23.327	What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.
26.633	It was music.
28.251	And this is where the story begins.
31.797	That's me,
33.191	"listening to the Beatles' ""White Album."""
35.161	And the look on my face is the feeling
38.353	that I've been searching for ever since.
41.938	Music goes straight to the emotional vein,
44.548	into your bloodstream
46.178	and right into your heart.
48.157	It deepens every experience.
51.717	Fellas?
53.454	(Music)
59.472	This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert
61.648	and Joshua Roman.
63.551	Music --
64.738	(Applause)
65.956	Yeah.
68.63	Music makes everything
68.63	have more emotional resonance.
73.229	Let's see how it does for this talk.
75.825	The right piece of music
75.825	at the right time fuses with us
79.593	on a cellular level.
81.382	When I hear that one song
84.502	from that one summer
86.488	with that one girl,
88.48	I'm instantly transported
88.48	back there again.
91.963	Hey, Stacey.
94.908	Here's a part of the story, though,
94.908	where I got a little greedy.
98.21	I thought if I added more layers
98.21	on top of the music,
102.394	I could make the feelings
102.394	even more powerful.
105.67	So I got into directing music videos.
109.432	This is what they looked like.
114.429	That's my brother, Jeff.
116.799	Sorry about this, Jeff.
118.145	(Laughter)
119.256	Here's me, just so we're even.
122.682	Incredible moves.
124.444	Should've been a dancer.
125.809	(Laughter)
126.955	These experiments grew,
128.291	and in time, started
128.291	to look more like this.
133.852	In both, I'm searching
133.852	for the same thing, though,
136.516	to capture that lightning in a bottle.
140.192	Except, I'm not.
141.889	Adding moving pictures over the music
141.889	added narrative dimension, yes,
146.261	but never quite equated the power
148.809	that just raw music had for me on its own.
152.795	This is not a great thing to realize
152.795	when you've devoted your life
155.973	and professional career
155.973	to becoming a music video director.
158.836	I kept asking myself,
158.836	did I take the wrong path?
162.353	So I started thinking: if I could
162.353	involve you, the audience, more,
166.228	I might be able to make you
166.228	feel something more as well.
169.901	So Aaron Koblin and I began
169.901	auditioning new technologies
173.11	that could put more of you
173.11	inside of the work,
176.272	like your childhood home
176.272	"in ""The Wilderness Downtown,"""
180.75	your hand-drawn portraits,
180.75	"in ""The Johnny Cash Project,"""
185.581	and your interactive dreams
187.791	"in ""3 Dreams of Black."""
191.469	We were pushing beyond the screen,
193.45	trying to connect more deeply
195.455	to people's hearts and imaginations.
198.745	But it wasn't quite enough.
201.258	It still didn't have the raw
201.258	experiential power of pure music for me.
207.443	So I started chasing a new technology
209.528	that I only had read about
209.528	in science fiction.
212.826	And after years of searching,
212.826	I found a prototype.
215.871	It was a project from Nonny de la Peña
215.871	in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.
221.102	And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
225.095	I could taste the lightning.
227.334	It was called virtual reality.
230.047	This was it five years ago
230.047	when I ran into it.
233.53	This is what it looks like now.
236.846	I quickly started building things
236.846	in this new medium,
240.775	and through that process
240.775	we realized something:
243.664	that VR is going to play
243.664	an incredibly important role
247.105	in the history of mediums.
249.681	In fact, it's going to be the last one.
253.39	I mean this because it's the first medium
253.39	that actually makes the jump
257.029	from our internalization
257.029	of an author's expression
260.341	of an experience,
262.035	to our experiencing it firsthand.
265.691	You look confused.
265.691	I'll explain. Don't worry.
267.879	(Laughter)
269.83	If we go back to the origins of mediums,
273.044	by all best guesses,
274.432	it starts around a fire,
274.432	with a good story.
277.986	Our clan leader is telling us
279.475	about how he hunted the woolly mammoth
279.475	on the tundra that day.
284.069	We hear his words
286.09	and translate them
286.09	into our own internal truths.
290.839	The same thing happens
292.028	when we look at the cave painting
292.028	version of the story,
296.241	the book about the mammoth hunt,
298.472	the play,
300.109	the radio broadcast,
301.749	the television show
303.582	or the movie.
305.532	All of these mediums require
305.532	"what we call ""suspension of disbelief,"""
309.288	because there's a translation gap
309.288	between the reality of the story
313.37	and our consciousness
313.37	interpreting the story
316.816	into our reality.
319.081	"I'm using the word ""consciousness"""
319.081	as a feeling of reality that we get
323.181	from our senses experiencing
323.181	the world around us.
328.58	Virtual reality bridges that gap.
331.985	Now, you are on the tundra
331.985	hunting with the clan leader.
336.222	Or you are the clan leader.
338.6	Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.
341.326	(Laughter)
346.218	So here's what special about VR.
348.726	In all other mediums,
350.329	your consciousness interprets the medium.
353.044	In VR, your consciousness is the medium.
358.399	So the potential for VR is enormous.
360.857	But where are we now?
362.555	What is the current state of the art?
366.318	Well,
368.746	we are here.
370.724	We are the equivalent
370.724	of year one of cinema.
373.896	This is the Lumière Brothers film
375.546	that allegedly sent a theater full
375.546	of people running for their lives
378.929	as they thought a train
378.929	was coming toward them.
382.136	Similar to this early stage
382.136	of this medium,
385.436	in VR, we also have to move
385.436	past the spectacle
389.001	and into the storytelling.
390.911	It took this medium decades
392.682	to figure out its preferred
392.682	language of storytelling,
395.364	in the form of a feature film.
397.164	In VR today, we're more learning grammar
400.542	than writing language.
402.88	We've made 15 films in the last year
402.88	at our VR company, Vrse,
406.455	and we've learned a few things.
408.801	We found that we have a unique,
408.801	direct path into your senses,
412.14	your emotions, even your body.
415.897	So let me show you some things.
417.596	For the purpose of this demo,
419.018	we're going to take every direction
419.018	that you could possibly look,
422.107	and stretch it into this giant rectangle.
425.083	OK, here we go.
429.642	So, first: camera movement
429.642	is tricky in VR.
433.947	Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.
436.93	We found if you move the camera
436.93	at a constant speed in a straight line,
441.453	you can actually get away with it, though.
443.694	The first day in film school,
445.445	they told me you have to learn
445.445	every single rule
448.056	before you can break one.
449.838	We have not learned every single rule.
452.036	We've barely learned any at all,
453.588	but we're already trying to break them
455.429	to see what kind of creative things
455.429	we can accomplish.
457.982	In this shot here, where we're moving up
457.982	off the ground, I added acceleration.
461.718	I did that because I wanted
461.718	to give you a physical sensation
464.575	of moving up off the ground.
465.982	In VR, I can give that to you.
469.797	(Music)
475.882	Not surprisingly, music matters a lot
475.882	in this medium as well.
479.842	It guides us how to feel.
482.354	In this project we made
482.354	with the New York Times, Zach Richter
485.699	and our friend, JR,
487.478	we take you up in a helicopter,
489.387	and even though you're flying
489.387	2,000 feet above Manhattan,
493.349	you don't feel afraid.
494.961	You feel triumphant for JR's character.
499.022	The music guides you there.
500.525	(Music)
509.364	Contrary to popular belief,
510.995	there is composition in virtual reality,
513.685	but it's completely
513.685	different than in film,
515.77	where you have a rectangular frame.
517.519	Composition is now
517.519	where your consciousness exists
520.055	and how the world moves around you.
522.927	"In this film, ""Waves of Grace,"""
522.927	which was a collaboration between Vrse,
526.315	the United Nations, Gabo Arora,
526.315	and Imraan Ismail,
529.248	we also see the changing role
529.248	of the close-up in virtual reality.
533.139	A close-up in VR means
533.139	you're actually close up to someone.
537.954	It brings that character inside
537.954	of your personal space,
540.621	a space that we'd usually reserve
540.621	for the people that we love.
544.49	And you feel an emotional
544.49	closeness to the character
547.684	because of what you feel
547.684	to be a physical closeness.
556.639	Directing VR is not like
556.639	directing for the rectangle.
561.002	It's more of a choreography
561.002	of the viewer's attention.
564.864	One tool we can use
564.864	to guide your attention
567.482	"is called ""spatialized sound."""
568.939	I can put a sound anywhere
568.939	in front of you, to left or right,
571.931	even behind you,
573.334	and when you turn your head,
573.334	the sound will rotate accordingly.
576.354	So I can use that to direct your attention
576.354	to where I want you to see.
580.308	Next time you hear someone
580.308	singing over your shoulder,
582.91	it might be Bono.
584.195	(Laughter)
590.539	VR makes us feel
590.539	like we are part of something.
594.459	For most of human history,
594.459	we lived in small family units.
597.992	We started in caves,
599.527	then moved to clans and tribes,
599.527	then villages and towns,
602.984	and now we're all global citizens.
606.211	But I believe that we are still
606.211	hardwired to care the most
610.035	about the things that are local to us.
613.325	And VR makes anywhere
613.325	and anyone feel local.
618.307	That's why it works as an empathy machine.
620.839	"Our film ""Clouds Over Sidra"""
620.839	takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,
624.087	and instead of watching a story
624.087	about people over there,
628.662	it's now a story about us here.
634.386	But where do we go from here?
636.432	The tricky thing is that
636.432	with all previous mediums,
638.913	the format is fixed at its birth.
642.182	Film has been a sequence of rectangles,
644.095	from Muybridge and his horses to now.
647.377	The format has never changed.
649.654	But VR as a format, as a medium,
654.37	isn't complete yet.
656.767	It's not using physical celluloid
656.767	or paper or TV signals.
659.99	It actually employs what we use
659.99	to make sense of the world.
664.642	We're using your senses
664.642	as the paints on the canvas,
668.569	but only two right now.
671.653	Eventually, we can see if we will have
671.653	all of our human senses employed,
675.517	and we will have agency to live
675.517	the story in any path we choose.
680.575	And we call it virtual reality right now,
683.055	but what happens when we move
683.055	past simulated realities?
687.345	What do we call it then?
689.503	What if instead of verbally
689.503	telling you about a dream,
692.363	I could let you live inside that dream?
695.86	What if instead of just experiencing
695.86	visiting some reality on Earth,
699.511	you could surf gravitational waves
699.511	on the edge of a black hole,
703.961	or create galaxies from scratch,
706.761	or communicate with each other
706.761	not using words
709.869	but using our raw thoughts?
713.254	That's not a virtual reality anymore.
716.052	And honestly I don't know
716.052	what that's called.
718.884	But I hope you see where we're going.
722.629	But here I am, intellectualizing
722.629	a medium I'm saying is experiential.
726.839	So let's experience it.
728.845	In your hands, you hopefully hold
728.845	a piece of cardboard.
733.143	Let's open the flap.
734.8	Tap on the power button
734.8	to unlock the phone.
738.145	For the people watching at home,
739.793	we're going to put up a card right now
741.653	to show you how to download
741.653	this experience on your phone yourself,
744.907	and even get a Google cardboard
744.907	of your own to try it with.
749.275	We played in cardboard boxes as kids,
751.826	and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find
751.826	a little bit of that lightning
756.434	by sticking our head in one again.
761.615	You're about to participate
763.068	in the largest collective
763.068	VR viewing in history.
768.236	And in that classic old-timey
768.236	style of yesteryear,
771.878	we're all going to watch something
774.133	at the exact same time, together.
777.019	Let's hope it works.
778.466	What's the countdown
778.466	look like? I can't see.
784.564	Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,
791.582	8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
802.327	(Birds singing)
814.508	(Train engine)
825.351	Audience: (Shreiks)
843.285	(Video) JR: Let me tell you
844.599	how I shot the cover
844.599	of the New York Times Magazine,
847.1	"""Walking New York."""
858.577	I just got strapped on
858.577	outside the helicopter,
862.011	and I had to be perfectly
862.011	vertical so I could grab it.
866.279	And when I was perfectly above --
867.921	you know, with the wind,
867.921	we had to redo it a few times --
870.682	then I kept shooting.
879.598	(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,
881.9	protect us from evil,
884.654	for you are the Lord,
887.044	the light.
893.824	You who gave us life took it away.
898.191	Let your will be done.
900.941	Please bring peace to the many
900.941	who have lost loved ones.
905.529	Help us to live again.
910.564	(Music)
929.066	(Video) (Children's voices)
931.504	Child's voice: There are more kids
931.504	in Zaatari than adults right now.
941.924	Sometimes I think
943.977	we are the ones in charge.
951.41	Chris Milk: How was it?
952.809	(Applause)
956.548	That was a cheap way of getting you
956.548	to do a standing ovation.
959.501	I just made you all stand.
959.501	I knew you'd applaud at the end.
962.333	(Applause)
963.998	I believe that everyone on Earth
963.998	needs to experience
967.841	what you just experienced.
970.036	That way we can collectively
970.036	start to shape this,
973.227	not as a tech platform
975.025	but as a humanity platform.
977.498	And to that end, in November of last year,
980.706	the New York Times and Vrse made
980.706	"a VR project called ""The Displaced."""
984.016	It launched with one million
984.016	Google Cardboards
986.386	sent out to every Sunday subscriber
986.386	with their newspaper.
989.883	But a funny thing happened
989.883	that Sunday morning.
992.425	A lot of people got them
993.771	that were not the intended recipients
993.771	on the mailing label.
998.001	And we started seeing this
998.001	all over Instagram.
1005.059	Look familiar?
1008.252	Music led me on a path
1010.419	of searching for what seemed
1010.419	like the unattainable
1013.492	for a very long time.
1015.466	Now, millions of kids just had
1015.466	the same formative experience
1019.461	in their childhood
1021.226	that I had in mine.
1024.316	Only I think this one
1026.569	surpasses it.
1028.358	Let's see
1029.859	where this
1031.573	leads them.
1033.384	Thank you.
1034.559	(Applause)
