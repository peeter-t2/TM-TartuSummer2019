12.6	When you come to TEDx,
12.6	you always think about technology,
15.32	the world changing,
15.32	becoming more innovative.
17.68	You think about the driverless.
19.48	Everyone's talking
19.48	about driverless cars these days,
22.92	and I love the concept
22.92	of a driverless car,
26.04	but when I go in one, you know,
29.56	I want it really slow,
32.24	I want access to the steering wheel
32.24	and the brake, just in case.
37.72	I don't know about you,
37.72	but I am not ready for a driverless bus.
42.56	I am not ready for a driverless airplane.
46.52	How about a driverless world?
50	And I ask you that
52.44	because we are increasingly in one.
56.8	It's not supposed to be that way.
58.8	We're number one,
60.6	the United States is large and in charge.
64.52	Americanization and globalization
64.52	for the last several generations
69.36	have basically been the same thing.
72.04	Right? Whether it's
72.04	the World Trade Organization
75.88	or it's the IMF, the World Bank,
78.24	the Bretton Woods Accord on currency,
80.1	these were American institutions,
81.88	our values, our friends, our allies,
81.88	our money, our standards.
86.52	That was the way the world worked.
90.28	So it's sort of interesting,
90.28	if you want to look at how the US looks,
95.2	here it is.
96.44	This is our view of how the world is run.
99.76	President Obama has got the red carpet,
102.6	he goes down Air Force One,
104.44	and it feels pretty good,
104.44	it feels pretty comfortable.
107	Well, I don't know how many of you
107	saw the China trip last week
110.64	and the G20.
112.72	Oh my God. Right?
114.96	This is how we landed
116.64	for the most important meeting
116.64	of the world's leaders in China.
120.16	The National Security Advisor
120.16	was actually spewing expletives
124.16	on the tarmac --
126	no red carpet,
127.44	kind of left out the bottom of the plane
130.12	along with all the media
130.12	and everybody else.
133.92	Later on in the G20,
135.92	well, there's Obama.
138.36	(Laughter)
139.72	Hi, George.
141.36	Hi, Norman.
144.48	They look like they're
144.48	about to get into a cage match, right?
148.24	And they did. It was 90 minutes long,
148.24	and they talked about Syria.
151.36	That's what Putin wanted to talk about.
153.28	He's increasingly calling the shots.
155.04	He's the one willing to do stuff there.
157.68	There's not a lot of mutual like or trust,
161.88	but it's not as if the Americans
161.88	are telling him what to do.
164.76	How about when the whole 20
164.76	are getting together?
167.12	Surely, when the leaders are all onstage,
169.097	then the Americans
169.097	are pulling their weight.
171.2	Uh-oh.
172.64	(Laughter)
175.76	Xi Jinping seems fine.
178.88	Angela Merkel has -- she always does --
180.8	that look, she always does that.
183.2	But Putin is telling
183.2	Turkish president Erdogan what to do,
186.24	and Obama is like,
186.24	what's going on over there?
191.84	You see. And the problem is
191.84	it's not a G20,
195.2	the problem is
196.44	it's a G-Zero world that we live in,
199.44	a world order where there is
199.44	no single country or alliance
203.88	that can meet the challenges
203.88	of global leadership.
207.28	The G20 doesn't work,
209.88	the G7, all of our friends,
209.88	that's history.
214	So globalization is continuing.
216.4	Goods and services and people
216.4	and capital are moving across borders
220.08	faster and faster than ever before,
222.12	but Americanization is not.
225.84	So if I've convinced you of that,
227.48	I want to do two things
227.48	with the rest of this talk.
230.24	I want to talk
230.24	about the implications of that
233.72	for the whole world.
235	I'll go around it.
236.56	And then I want to talk about
238.2	what we think right here
241.12	in the United States and in New York.
244.56	So why? What are the implications.
244.56	Why are we here?
247.2	Well, we're here
249.04	because the United States,
252.44	we spent two trillion dollars
252.44	on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
256.28	that were failed.
257.52	We don't want to do that anymore.
259.16	We have large numbers
259.16	of middle and working classes
262.84	that feel like they've not benefited
262.84	from promises of globalization,
266.96	so they don't want to see it particularly.
269.64	And we have an energy revolution
272.32	where we don't need OPEC
272.32	or the Middle East the way we used to.
275.52	We produce all that right here
275.52	in the United States.
278	So the Americans don't want
278	to be the global sheriff for security
283.36	or the architect of global trade.
285.68	The Americans don't want to even be
285.68	the cheerleader of global values.
289.12	Well, then you look to Europe,
292.8	and the most important
292.8	alliance in the world
294.92	has been the transatlantic relationship.
297.68	But it is now weaker than it has been
297.68	at any point since World War II,
302.08	all of the crises,
302.08	the Brexit conversations,
304.68	the hedging going on
304.68	between the French and the Russians,
308.8	or the Germans and the Turks,
308.8	or the Brits and the Chinese.
313	China does want to do more leadership.
314.96	They do, but only in the economic sphere,
318	and they want their own values,
318	standards, currency,
321.12	in competition with that of the US.
323.24	The Russians want to do more leadership.
325.2	You see that in Ukraine,
327.28	in the Baltic states, in the Middle East,
330.16	but not with the Americans.
331.92	They want their own preferences and order.
334.56	That's why we are where we are.
337.48	So what happens going forward?
340.8	Let's start easy,
342.96	with the Middle East.
345.16	(Laughter)
348.56	You know, I left a little out,
351.2	but you get the general idea.
354.56	Look, there are three reasons
356	why the Middle East
356	has had stability such as it is. Right?
361.08	One is because there was
361.08	a willingness to provide
365.2	some level of military security
365.2	by the US and allies.
368.6	Number two, it was easy to take
368.6	a lot of cheap money out of the ground
373.28	because oil was expensive.
375.08	And number three
376.44	was no matter how bad the leaders were,
376.44	the populations were relatively quiescent.
381.56	They didn't have the ability,
381.56	and many didn't have the will
384.36	to really rise up against.
385.84	Well, I can tell you, in a G-Zero world,
388.4	all three of those things
388.4	are increasingly not true,
392.04	and so failed states,
394.4	terrorism, refugees and the rest.
397.64	Does the entire Middle East fall apart?
399.6	No, the Kurds will do better,
399.6	and Iraq, Israel, Iran over time.
403.48	But generally speaking,
403.48	it's not a good look.
405.88	OK, how about this guy?
409.28	He's playing a poor hand very well.
411.76	There's no question
411.76	he's hitting above his weight.
414.68	But long term -- I didn't mean that.
417.96	But long term, long term,
422.28	if you think that the Russians
423.96	were antagonized by the US and Europe
423.96	expanding NATO right up to their borders
429.6	when we said they weren't going to,
431.27	and the EU encroaching them,
433.68	just wait until the Chinese
433.68	put hundreds of billions of dollars
437.16	in every country around Russia
437.16	they thought they had influence in.
440.32	The Chinese are going to dominate it.
440.32	The Russians are picking up the crumbs.
444	In a G-Zero world, this is going to be
444	a very tense 10 years for Mr. Putin.
453.04	It's not all bad. Right?
455.72	Asia actually looks a lot better.
458	There are real leaders across Asia,
461.2	they have a lot of political stability.
463.6	They're there for a while.
464.88	Mr. Modi in India,
467.16	Mr. Abe, who is probably
467.16	about to get a third term written in
471.16	in the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan,
473.16	of course Xi Jinping
473.16	who is consolidating enormous power,
476.32	the most powerful leader in China
478.68	since Mao.
480.36	Those are the three
480.36	most important economies in Asia.
483.6	Now look, there are problems in Asia.
485.44	We see the sparring
485.44	over the South China Sea.
488.12	We see that Kim Jong Un,
488.12	just in the last couple of days,
490.84	tested yet another nuclear weapon.
494.04	But the leaders in Asia
494.04	do not feel the need
498.32	to wave the flag,
499.88	to go xenophobic,
501.72	to actually allow escalation
504.8	of the geopolitical
504.8	and cross-border tensions.
507.32	They want to focus on long-term
507.32	economic stability and growth.
512.72	And that's what they're actually doing.
515.6	Let's turn to Europe.
518.32	Europe does look a little scared
518.32	in this environment.
520.92	So much of what is happening
520.92	in the Middle East
523.24	is washing up quite literally
523.24	onto European shores.
528	You see Brexit and you see
528	the concerns of populism
531.799	across all of the European states.
535.4	Let me tell you that over the long term,
538.08	in a G-Zero world,
539.88	European expansion
539.88	will be seen to have gone too far.
544.52	Europe went right up to Russia,
544.52	went right down to the Middle East,
548.32	and if the world were truly becoming
548.32	more flat and more Americanized,
552.6	that would be less of a problem,
554.2	but in a G-Zero world,
554.2	those countries nearest Russia
557.72	and nearest the Middle East
559.36	actually have different
559.36	economic capabilities,
562.76	different social stability
564.6	and different political preferences
564.6	and systems than core Europe.
568.8	So Europe was able to truly expand
571.84	under the G7,
573.92	but under the G-Zero,
573.92	Europe will get smaller.
576.48	Core Europe around Germany
576.48	and France and others
580.52	will still work, be functional,
580.52	stable, wealthy, integrated.
584.6	But the periphery,
586.04	countries like Greece
586.04	and Turkey and others,
588.52	will not look that good at all.
592.2	Latin America, a lot of populism,
595.6	made the economies not go so well.
597.64	They had been more opposed
597.64	to the United States for decades.
600.52	Increasingly, they're coming back.
602.48	We see that in Argentina.
604.16	We see it with the openness in Cuba.
605.92	We will see it in Venezuela
605.92	when Maduro falls.
609.16	We will see it in Brazil
609.16	after the impeachment
612.2	and when we finally see
612.2	a new legitimate president elected there.
616.72	The only place you see
616.72	that is moving in another direction
619.84	is the unpopularity
619.84	of Mexican president Peña Nieto.
623.44	There you could actually see
623.44	a slip away from the United States
627.32	over the coming years.
628.6	The US election matters a lot
628.6	on that one, too.
631.64	(Laughter)
633.6	Africa, right?
635.44	A lot of people have said
635.44	it's going to be Africa's decade, finally.
638.68	In a G-Zero world,
638.68	it is absolutely an amazing time
642.24	for a few African countries,
644	those governed well
644	with a lot of urbanization,
646.68	a lot of smart people,
646.68	women really getting into the workforce,
650.2	entrepreneurship taking off.
652.2	But for most of the countries in Africa,
655	it's going to be a lot more dicey:
656.92	extreme climate conditions,
659.96	radicalism both from Islam
659.96	and also Christianity,
664.2	very poor governance,
665.64	borders you can't defend,
665.64	lots of forced migration.
668.68	Those countries can fall off the map.
670.8	So you're really going to see
670.8	an extreme segregation going on
674.56	between the winners
674.56	and the losers across Africa.
677.92	Finally, back to the United States.
681.84	What do I think about us?
684.48	Because there are a lot of upset people,
687.24	not here at TEDx, I know,
689.92	but in the United States, my God,
691.72	after 15 months of campaigning,
691.72	we should be upset.
694.2	I understand that.
696.2	But a lot of people are upset
696.2	"because they say, ""Washington's broken,"
699.48	we don't trust the establishment,
699.48	"we hate the media."""
702	Heck, even globalists like me
702	are taking it on the chin.
706.16	Look, I do think we have to recognize,
710.8	my fellow campers,
713.04	that when you are being
713.04	chased by the bear,
717.48	in the global context,
717.48	you need not outrun the bear,
721.8	you need to only outrun
721.8	your fellow campers.
724.44	(Laughter)
727.72	Now, I just told you
729.88	about our fellow campers.
732	Right? And from that perspective,
734.96	we look OK.
737	A lot of people in that context say,
739.04	"""Let's go dollar."
739.04	Let's go New York real estate.
742.56	Let's send our kids
742.56	"to American universities."""
745.64	You know, our neighbors are awesome:
747.8	Canada, Mexico
747.8	and two big bodies of water.
750.68	You know how much Turkey
750.68	would love to have neighbors like that?
755.08	Those are awesome neighbors.
758.4	Terrorism is a problem
758.4	in the United States.
760.72	God knows we know it here in New York.
764.04	But it's a much bigger problem
764.04	in Europe than the US.
766.541	It's a much bigger problem
766.541	in the Middle East
768.88	than it is in Europe.
770.48	These are factors of large magnitude.
772.64	We just accepted 10,000 Syrian refugees,
772.64	and we're complaining bitterly about it.
777.64	You know why?
777.64	Because they can't swim here.
780.48	Right? I mean, the Turks would love
780.48	to have only 10,000 Syrian refugees.
785.2	The Jordanians,
785.2	the Germans, the Brits. Right?
788.52	That's not the situation.
789.8	That's the reality of the United States.
793	Now, that sounds pretty good.
796.44	Here's the challenge.
798.6	In a G-Zero world, the way you lead
802.64	is by example.
804.24	If we know we don't want to be
804.24	the global cop anymore,
807.28	if we know we're not going to be
807.28	the architect of global trade,
810.257	we're not going to be
810.257	the cheerleader of global values,
812.88	we're not going to do it
812.88	the way we used to,
815	the 21st century is changing,
816.405	we need to lead by example --
816.405	be so compelling
819.28	that all these other people
819.28	are going to still say,
821.72	it's not just they're faster campers.
823.56	Even when the bear is not chasing us,
823.56	this is a good place to be.
826.68	We want to emulate them.
828.88	The election process this year
828.88	is not proving a good option
834.04	for leading by example.
836.64	Hillary Clinton says
836.64	it's going to be like the '90s.
839.12	We can still be
839.12	that cheerleader on values.
842.08	We can still be
842.08	the architect of global trade.
844.6	We can still be the global sheriff.
846.32	And Donald Trump wants
846.32	to bring us back to the '30s.
850.56	"He's saying, ""Our way or the highway."
850.56	"You don't like it, lump it."" Right?"
854.52	Neither are recognizing
854.52	a fundamental truth of the G-Zero,
858.4	which is that even though
858.4	the US is not in decline,
862.2	it is getting objectively harder
864.76	for the Americans to impose their will,
867.96	even have great influence,
869.68	on the global order.
872.28	Are we prepared to truly lead by example?
876.2	What would we have to do to fix this
879.28	after November,
880.52	after the next president comes in?
882.72	Well, either we have to have
882.72	another crisis that forces us to respond.
887.4	A depression would do that.
889.08	Another global financial
889.08	crisis could do this.
891.28	God forbid, another 9/11 could do that.
893.32	Or, absent crisis,
895.8	we need to see that the hollowing out,
895.8	the inequality, the challenges
901.96	that are growing and growing
901.96	in the United States,
904.36	are themselves urgent enough
906.56	to force our leaders to change,
908.92	and that we have those voices.
911.4	Through our cell phones, individually,
913.32	we have those voices
913.32	to compel them to change.
917.48	There is, of course, a third choice,
920.2	perhaps the most likely one,
922.2	which is that we do
922.2	neither of those things,
924.92	and in four years time you invite me back,
927.52	and I will give this speech yet again.
930.32	Thank you very, very much.
932.2	(Applause)
