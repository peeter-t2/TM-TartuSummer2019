12	I'd like to begin this song I wrote
15	about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want
20	with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes
25	by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:
28	"""I find no peace, and all my war is done;"
33	I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;
40	I fly above the wind,
43	and yet I cannot arise;
46	And naught I have,
49	"and all the world I seize upon."""
58	♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
60	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
62	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
64	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
66	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
68	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
70	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
72	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
75	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
77	♫ Have but I don't have ♫
78	♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫
80	♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫
82	♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫
84	♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫
88	♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
91	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
93	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
95	♫ Have but I don't have ♫
98	♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫
101	♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫
106	♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫
109	"♫ ""Good things come to those who wait"" ♫"
113	♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫
116	♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫
120	♫ Stand the cold air ♫
123	♫ Glad-handed ♫
125	"♫ Sick and tired of the ""Later, maybe"" ♫"
129	♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫
133	♫ And I gotta just tame it ♫
135	♫ I gotta just name it ♫
137	♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh please, oh please ♫
140	♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫
142	♫ My mind won't stop ♫
144	♫ And my heart says go ♫
147	♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫
150	♫ My mind won't stop -- and my heart says go-ooooo ... ♫
172	♫ Good things must be here -- yes, right here ♫
177	♫ Here, right here, right here ♫
180	♫ I won't live this life forever ♫
185	♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫
189	"♫ Sick and tired of the ""Later, maybe"" ♫"
193	♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫
197	♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫
200	♫ I gotta just seize ♫
202	♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫
205	♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
208	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
210	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
212	♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫
214	♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫
218	♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫
222	♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫
227	♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
232	♫ Have but I -- have what I want ♫
235	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
237	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
240	♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫
242	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
244	♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
246	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
248	♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫
250	♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫
252	♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫
258	(Applause)
