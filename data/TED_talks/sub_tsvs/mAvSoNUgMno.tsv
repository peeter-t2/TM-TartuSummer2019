12.984	My job at Twitter
14.275	is to ensure user trust,
16.253	protect user rights and keep users safe,
19.09	both from each other
20.35	and, at times, from themselves.
24.249	Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.
28.524	Back in January 2009,
31.394	we saw more than two million new tweets each day
34.725	on the platform.
36.489	January 2014, more than 500 million.
42.397	We were seeing two million tweets
44.889	in less than six minutes.
47.065	That's a 24,900-percent increase.
54.049	Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter
57.302	puts no one in harm's way.
58.805	There's no risk involved.
60.74	My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.
66.493	Sounds straightforward, right?
68.466	You might even think it'd be easy,
69.618	given that I just said the vast majority
71.788	of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.
75.598	Why spend so much time
77.767	searching for potential calamities
80.51	in innocuous activities?
83.41	Given the scale that Twitter is at,
86.35	a one-in-a-million chance happens
93.583	It's the same for other companies
95.028	dealing at this sort of scale.
96.499	For us, edge cases,
98.207	those rare situations that are unlikely to occur,
101.832	are more like norms.
104.454	Say 99.999 percent of tweets
108.396	pose no risk to anyone.
110.284	There's no threat involved.
111.35	Maybe people are documenting travel landmarks
114.304	like Australia's Heart Reef,
116.267	or tweeting about a concert they're attending,
119.188	or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.
123.935	After you take out that 99.999 percent,
128.444	that tiny percentage of tweets remaining
131.973	works out to roughly
137.837	The sheer scale of what we're dealing with
140.293	makes for a challenge.
142.605	You know what else makes my role
143.783	particularly challenging?
146.89	People do weird things.
152.013	(Laughter)
153.842	And I have to figure out what they're doing,
156.233	why, and whether or not there's risk involved,
158.482	often without much in terms of context
160.65	or background.
162.497	I'm going to show you some examples
164.574	that I've run into during my time at Twitter --
166.579	these are all real examples â€”
168.199	of situations that at first seemed cut and dried,
170.852	but the truth of the matter was something
172.495	altogether different.
174.045	The details have been changed
176.022	to protect the innocent
177.279	and sometimes the guilty.
180.512	We'll start off easy.
183.517	"[""Yo bitch""]"
185.31	If you saw a Tweet that only said this,
188.538	you might think to yourself,
190.232	"""That looks like abuse."""
191.885	After all, why would you
191.885	want to receive the message,
194.992	"""Yo, bitch."""
197.21	Now, I try to stay relatively hip
201.873	to the latest trends and memes,
204.385	"so I knew that ""yo, bitch"""
207.089	was also often a common greeting between friends,
210.243	"as well as being a popular ""Breaking Bad"" reference."
214.505	I will admit that I did not expect
216.992	to encounter a fourth use case.
219.833	It turns out it is also used on Twitter
222.937	when people are role-playing as dogs.
225.999	(Laughter)
231.278	And in fact, in that case,
232.944	it's not only not abusive,
234.553	it's technically just an accurate greeting.
237.692	(Laughter)
240.581	So okay, determining whether or not
242.652	something is abusive without context,
244.5	definitely hard.
246.092	Let's look at spam.
248.809	Here's an example of an account engaged
250.769	in classic spammer behavior,
252.437	sending the exact same message
253.996	to thousands of people.
255.8	While this is a mockup I put
255.8	together using my account,
258.593	we see accounts doing this all the time.
261.594	Seems pretty straightforward.
263.573	We should just automatically suspend accounts
265.626	engaging in this kind of behavior.
268.933	Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.
272.143	Turns out that that message
272.143	could also be a notification
275.026	you signed up for that the International
275.026	Space Station is passing overhead
278.915	because you wanted to go outside
280.761	and see if you could see it.
282.709	You're not going to get that chance
283.934	if we mistakenly suspend the account
285.781	thinking it's spam.
288.047	Okay. Let's make the stakes higher.
291.573	Back to my account,
293.489	again exhibiting classic behavior.
296.994	This time it's sending the same message and link.
299.637	This is often indicative of 
299.637	something called phishing,
302.411	somebody trying to steal another
302.411	person's account information
305.589	by directing them to another website.
307.792	That's pretty clearly not a good thing.
311.986	We want to, and do, suspend accounts
313.916	engaging in that kind of behavior.
316.54	So why are the stakes higher for this?
319.787	Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally
322.786	who managed to record a video
324.696	of a police officer beating a non-violent protester
327.966	who's trying to let the world know what's happening.
330.941	We don't want to gamble
332.584	on potentially silencing that crucial speech
335.101	by classifying it as spam and suspending it.
338.03	That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters
340.909	when looking at account behaviors,
342.597	and even then, we can still get it wrong
344.613	and have to reevaluate.
346.849	Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against,
350.557	it's crucial that I not only predict
353.253	but also design protections for the unexpected.
357.037	And that's not just an issue for me,
359.379	or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.
361.466	It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating
363.872	something that you think is going to be amazing
365.797	and will let people do awesome things.
368.586	So what do I do?
371.452	I pause and I think,
374.77	how could all of this
376.865	go horribly wrong?
380.658	I visualize catastrophe.
385.111	And that's hard. There's a sort of
387.574	inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that,
390.422	like when you're writing your wedding vows
392.234	at the same time as your prenuptial agreement.
394.88	(Laughter)
396.576	But you still have to do it,
398.949	particularly if you're marrying 
403.395	"What do I mean by ""visualize catastrophe?"""
406.492	I try to think of how something as
409.254	benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat
412.482	could lead to death,
413.586	and what to do to prevent that.
415.912	Which happens to be my next example.
418.295	This is my cat, Eli.
421.405	We wanted to give users the ability
423.386	to add photos to their tweets.
425.459	A picture is worth a thousand words.
427.056	You only get 140 characters.
429.065	You add a photo to your tweet,
430.265	look at how much more content you've got now.
433.303	There's all sorts of great things you can do
434.98	by adding a photo to a tweet.
436.987	My job isn't to think of those.
439.267	It's to think of what could go wrong.
442.014	How could this picture
443.906	lead to my death?
447.445	Well, here's one possibility.
450.605	There's more in that picture than just a cat.
453.691	There's geodata.
455.783	When you take a picture with your smartphone
457.995	or digital camera,
459.294	there's a lot of additional information
460.948	saved along in that image.
462.564	In fact, this image also contains
464.496	the equivalent of this,
466.301	more specifically, this.
469.38	Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try
471.336	to track me down and do me harm
473.621	based upon image data associated
475.405	with a picture I took of my cat,
477.353	but I start by assuming the worst will happen.
481.004	That's why, when we launched photos on Twitter,
483.342	we made the decision to strip that geodata out.
487.163	(Applause)
493.01	If I start by assuming the worst
495.623	and work backwards,
496.57	I can make sure that the protections we build
499.123	work for both expected
500.891	and unexpected use cases.
502.969	Given that I spend my days and nights
505.914	imagining the worst that could happen,
508.455	it wouldn't be surprising if 
508.455	my worldview was gloomy.
512.712	(Laughter)
514.495	It's not.
515.912	The vast majority of interactions I see --
519.788	and I see a lot, believe me -- are positive,
523.689	people reaching out to help
525.613	or to connect or share information with each other.
529.061	It's just that for those of us dealing with scale,
532.384	for those of us tasked with keeping people safe,
536.184	we have to assume the worst will happen,
538.73	because for us, a one-in-a-million chance
542.957	is pretty good odds.
545.706	Thank you.
547.57	(Applause)
