12.92	In 1987, Tina Lord
12.92	found herself in quite the pickle.
16.56	See, this gold digger made sure
16.56	she married sweet Cord Roberts
19.88	just before he inherited millions.
22.56	But when Cord found out
22.56	Tina loved his money
24.8	as much as she loved him,
26.44	he dumped her.
27.72	Cord's mother Maria was thrilled
29.64	until they hooked up again.
31.16	So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina
33.84	and then made sure Cord didn't find out
33.84	Tina was pregnant with his baby.
37.6	So Tina, still married
37.6	but thinking Cord didn't love her
40.52	flew to Argentina with Max.
42.72	Cord finally figured out what was going on
44.84	and rushed after them,
44.84	but he was too late.
47.84	Tina had already been kidnapped,
49.44	strapped to a raft
49.44	and sent over a waterfall.
52.36	She and her baby were presumed dead.
55.32	Cord was sad for a bit,
58.36	but then he bounced right back
59.84	with a supersmart
59.84	archaeologist named Kate,
63.24	and they had a gorgeous wedding
64.76	until Tina, seemingly back from the dead,
64.76	ran into the church holding a baby.
69.08	"""Stop!"" she screamed."
71.2	"""Am I too late?"
72.72	Cord, I've come so far.
75.6	"This is your son."""
79.4	And that, ladies and gentlemen,
80.92	"is how the soap opera ""One Life to Live"""
80.92	introduced a love story
84.12	that lasted 25 years.
86.2	(Laughter)
87.56	Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,
89.68	you know the stories and the characters
89.68	can be exaggerated, larger than life,
94.6	and if you're a fan,
94.6	you find that exaggeration fun,
97.88	and if you're not,
99.6	maybe you find them
99.6	melodramatic or unsophisticated.
102.32	Maybe you think watching soap operas
104.56	is a waste of time,
105.84	that their bigness means
105.84	their lessons are small or nonexistent.
110.56	But I believe the opposite to be true.
113.44	Soap operas reflect life, just bigger.
117.92	So there are real life lessons
117.92	we can learn from soap operas,
121.36	and those lessons
121.36	are as big and adventurous
124.2	as any soap opera storyline.
127.32	Now, I've been a fan since I ran home
127.32	from the bus stop in second grade
130.92	desperate to catch the end
130.92	of Luke and Laura's wedding,
133.64	the biggest moment
133.64	"in ""General Hospital"" history."
137.04	(Applause)
138.32	So you can imagine
138.32	how much I loved my eight years
141.68	as the assistant casting director
141.68	"on ""As the World Turns."""
144.68	My job was watching soap operas,
146.72	reading soap opera scripts
148.16	and auditioning actors
148.16	to be on soap operas.
150.96	So I know my stuff.
153.28	(Laughter)
154.56	And yes, soap operas
156.88	are larger than life,
159.2	drama on a grand scale,
160.92	but our lives can be filled
160.92	with as much intensity,
164.68	and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.
167.84	We cycle through tragedy and joy
170.16	just like these characters.
172.12	We cross thresholds, fight demons
172.12	and find salvation unexpectedly,
176.6	and we do it again and again and again,
179.6	but just like soaps,
179.6	we can flip the script,
182.36	which means we can learn
182.36	from these characters
184.64	that move like bumblebees,
186.48	looping and swerving through life.
189.08	And we can use those lessons
191.36	to craft our own life stories.
193.88	Soap operas teach us to push away doubt
197.6	and believe in our capacity
199.8	for bravery, vulnerability,
202.44	adaptability and resilience.
205.28	And most importantly, they show us
207.6	it's never too late to change your story.
211.12	So with that, let's start
211.12	with soap opera lesson one:
214.12	surrender is not an option.
216.12	(Laughter)
218.12	"""All My Children""'s Erica Kane"
218.12	was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,
222.72	a hyperbolically self-important princess
225.2	who deep down was scrappy and daring.
228.8	Now, in her 41 years on TV,
228.8	perhaps Erica's most famous scene
232.44	is her alone in the woods
234.44	suddenly face to face with a grizzly bear.
237.2	She screamed at the bear,
239.48	"""You may not do this!"
240.92	Do you understand me?
242.6	You may not come near me!
244.52	I am Erica Kane
246.44	"and you are a filthy beast!"""
249.08	(Laughter)
250.92	And of course the bear left,
252.6	so what that teaches us
254.44	is obstacles are to be expected
256.52	and we can choose to surrender
256.52	or we can stand and fight.
261.24	Pandora's Tim Westergren
261.24	knows this better than most.
264.08	You might even call him
264.08	the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.
268	Tim and his cofounders
268	launched the company
270.079	with two million dollars in funding.
271.839	They were out of cash the next year.
274.84	Now, lots of companies fold at that point,
274.84	but Tim chose to fight.
278.6	He maxed out 11 credit cards
278.6	and racked up six figures in personal debt
282.8	and it still wasn't enough.
284.68	So every two weeks for two years on payday
284.68	he stood in front of his employees
289.56	and he asked them
289.56	to sacrifice their salaries,
293.12	and it worked.
294.52	More than 50 people deferred
294.52	two million dollars,
297.36	and now, more than a decade later,
299.24	Pandora is worth billions.
302.36	When you believe that there is a way
304.84	around or through
304.84	whatever is in front of you,
307.24	that surrender is not an option,
309.8	you can overcome enormous obstacles.
313.96	Which brings us to soap opera lesson two:
315.96	sacrifice your ego
315.96	and drop the superiority complex.
320.72	Now, this is scary.
322.32	It's an acknowledgment
322.32	of need or fallibility.
325.52	Maybe it's even an admission
326.92	that we're not as special
326.92	as we might like to think.
331.12	Stephanie Forrester
331.12	"of ""The Bold and the Beautiful"""
333.56	thought she was pretty darn special.
335.32	She thought she was so special,
336.84	she didn't need to mix
336.84	with the riffraff from the valley,
339.56	and she made sure
339.56	valley girl Brooke knew it.
342.44	But after nearly 25 years
342.44	of epic fighting,
345.88	Stephanie got sick and let Brooke in.
349.48	They made amends,
350.72	archenemies became soul mates
352.76	and Stephanie died in Brooke's arms,
355.12	and here's our takeaway.
357.44	Drop your ego.
359	Life is not about you.
360.92	It's about us,
362.56	and our ability to experience joy
365.4	and love and to improve our reality
367.92	comes only when we make
367.92	ourselves vulnerable
370.96	and we accept responsibility
370.96	for our actions
374.12	and our inactions,
375.52	kind of like Howard Schultz,
375.52	the CEO of Starbucks.
378.92	Now, after a great run as CEO,
380.96	Howard stepped down in 2000,
383.28	and Starbucks quickly overextended itself
385.52	and stock prices fell.
387.52	Howard rejoined the team in 2008,
389.48	and one of the first things he did
391.52	was apologize to all 180,000 employees.
396.92	He apologized.
398.8	And then he asked for help,
398.8	honesty, and ideas in return.
402.8	And now, Starbucks has more than doubled
405.4	its net revenue since Howard came back.
408.16	So sacrifice your desire
408.16	to be right or safe all the time.
412.12	It's not helping anyone, least of all you.
415.24	Sacrifice your ego.
419.24	Soap opera lesson three:
420.72	evolution is real.
424.24	You're not meant to be static characters.
426.96	On television, static equals boring
426.96	and boring equals fired.
430.92	Characters are supposed
430.92	to grow and change.
434.56	Now, on TV, those dynamic changes
437.04	can make for some rough transitions,
439.32	particularly when a character
439.32	is played by one person yesterday
442.72	and played by someone new today.
445.84	Recasting happens all the time on soaps.
449.56	Over the last 20 years,
451.4	four different actors
451.4	have played the same key role
454.28	"of Carly Benson on ""General Hospital."""
457.72	Each new face triggered a change
457.72	in the character's life and personality.
462.88	Now, there was always
462.88	an essential nugget of Carly in there,
466.96	but the character and the story
466.96	adapted to whomever was playing her.
471.64	And here's what that means for us.
474.4	While we may not swap faces
474.4	in our own lives,
477.04	we can evolve too.
478.96	We can choose to draw a circle
478.96	around our feet and stay in that spot,
484.32	or we can open ourselves to opportunities
486.88	like Carly, who went
486.88	from nursing student to hotel owner,
491.52	or like Julia Child.
493.72	Julia was a World War II spy,
496.4	and when the war ended,
496.4	she got married, moved to France,
499.76	and decided to give
499.76	culinary school a shot.
503.08	Julia, her books and her TV shows
503.08	revolutionized the way America cooks.
509.64	We all have the power
509.64	to initiate change in our lives,
512.96	to evolve and adapt.
515.56	We make the choice,
517.4	but sometimes life chooses for us,
517.4	and we don't get a heads up.
521	Surprise slams us in the face.
523.2	You're flat on the ground,
523.2	the air is gone,
525.36	and you need resuscitation.
527.96	So thank goodness
527.96	for soap opera lesson four:
531.159	resurrection is possible.
533.44	(Laughter)
534.88	(Applause)
538.96	"In 1983, ""Days of Our Lives""'"
538.96	Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,
543.16	but not really, because in 1984
545.72	he died when his car
545.72	plunged into the harbor,
548.48	and yet he was back in 1985
548.48	with a brain tumor.
552.04	(Laughter)
553.08	But before the tumor could kill him,
555.72	Marlena shot him, and he tumbled
555.72	off a catwalk to his death.
560.44	And so it went for 30 years.
562.76	(Laughter)
565.28	Even when we saw the body,
567.44	we knew better.
568.68	He's called the Phoenix for a reason.
572.72	And here's what that means for us.
575	As long as the show is still on the air,
577.48	or you're still breathing,
579.6	nothing is permanent.
581.28	Resurrection is possible.
585.56	Now, of course, just like life,
588.28	soap operas do ultimately
588.28	meet the big finale.
592.32	CBS canceled my show,
592.32	"""As The World Turns,"" in December 2009,"
597.28	and we shot our final episode
598.88	in June 2010.
600.64	It was six months of dying
602.36	and I rode that train
602.36	right into the mountain.
606.24	And even though we were
606.24	in the middle of a huge recession
609	and millions of people
609	were struggling to find work,
612.84	I somehow thought everything would be OK.
615.16	So I packed up the kids
615.16	and the Brooklyn apartment,
617.88	and we moved in with my in-laws
620.24	in Alabama.
621.48	(Laughter)
624.92	Three months later, nothing was OK.
627.68	That was when I watched
627.68	the final episode air,
632.92	and I realized the show
632.92	was not the only fatality.
637.04	I was one too.
639.12	I was unemployed
639.12	and living on the second floor
641.72	of my in-laws' home,
643.32	and that's enough
643.32	to make anyone feel dead inside.
646.12	(Laughter)
648.04	But I knew my story wasn't over,
650.2	that it couldn't be over.
652.44	I just had to tap into everything
652.44	I had ever learned about soap operas.
658.36	I had to be brave like Erica
658.36	and refuse to surrender,
661.92	so every day, I made a decision to fight.
666	I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie
668.6	and sacrifice my ego.
670.16	I had to ask for help
670.16	a lot of times across many states.
674.76	I had to be adaptable like Carly
678.24	and evolve my skills,
678.24	my mindset, and my circumstances,
681.8	and then I had to be
681.8	resilient, like Stefano,
684.8	and resurrect myself and my career
687.48	like a phoenix from the ashes.
690.76	Eventually I got an interview.
693.64	After 15 years in news and entertainment,
696.6	nine months of unemployment
698.56	and this one interview,
701.84	I had an offer for an entry level job.
705.04	I was 37 years old
706.92	and I was back from the dead.
710.24	We will all experience
710.24	what looks like an ending,
713.36	and we can choose to make it a beginning.
716.12	Kind of like Tina, who miraculously
716.12	survived that waterfall,
720.24	and because I hate to leave
720.24	a cliffhanger hanging,
722.96	Tina and Cord did get divorced,
725.16	but they got remarried three times
725.16	before the show went off the air in 2012.
731.08	So remember,
732.84	as long as there is breath in your body,
736.32	it's never too late to change your story.
739.48	Thank you.
740.72	(Applause)
