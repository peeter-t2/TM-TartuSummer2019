15.26	From all outward appearances,
18.26	John had everything going for him.
21.26	He had just signed the contract
23.26	to sell his New York apartment
25.26	at a six-figure profit,
27.26	and he'd only owned it for five years.
30.26	The school where he graduated from with his master's
32.26	had just offered him a teaching appointment,
34.26	which meant not only a salary,
36.26	but benefits for the first time in ages.
40.26	And yet, despite everything going really well for John,
43.26	he was struggling,
45.26	fighting addiction and a gripping depression.
50.26	On the night of June 11th, 2003,
52.26	he climbed up to the edge
54.26	of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge
57.26	and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.
62.26	Remarkably --
64.26	no, miraculously --
66.26	he lived.
69.26	The fall shattered his right arm,
72.26	broke every rib that he had,
74.26	punctured his lung,
76.26	and he drifted in and out of consciousness
78.26	as he drifted down the East River,
81.26	under the Brooklyn Bridge
83.26	and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,
86.26	where passengers on the ferry
88.26	heard his cries of pain,
90.26	contacted the boat's captain
92.26	who contacted the Coast Guard
94.26	who fished him out of the East River
96.26	and took him to Bellevue Hospital.
99.26	And that's actually where our story begins.
102.26	Because once John committed himself
104.26	to putting his life back together --
107.26	first physically, then emotionally,
110.26	and then spiritually --
112.26	he found that there were very few resources available
115.26	to someone who has attempted to end their life
117.26	in the way that he did.
120.26	Research shows
122.26	that 19 out of 20 people
124.26	who attempt suicide
126.26	will fail.
129.26	But the people who fail
131.26	are 37 times more likely to succeed
134.26	the second time.
137.26	This truly is
139.26	an at-risk population
141.26	with very few resources to support them.
144.26	And what happens
146.26	when people try to assemble themselves back into life,
149.26	because of our taboos around suicide,
151.26	we're not sure what to say,
153.26	and so quite often we say nothing.
156.26	And that furthers the isolation
158.26	that people like John found themselves in.
163.26	I know John's story very well
165.26	because I'm John.
169.26	And this is, today,
172.26	the first time in any sort of public setting
175.26	I've ever acknowledged
177.26	the journey that I have been on.
181.26	But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006
184.26	and a good friend last year to suicide,
188.26	and sitting last year at TEDActive,
191.26	I knew that I needed to step out of my silence
194.26	and past my taboos
196.26	to talk about an idea worth spreading --
199.26	and that is that people
201.26	who have made the difficult choice
204.26	to come back to life
206.26	need more resources and need our help.
210.26	As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.
213.26	It gets way better.
216.26	And I'm choosing to come out
218.26	of a totally different kind of closet today
220.26	to encourage you, to urge you,
223.26	that if you are someone
225.26	who has contemplated or attempted suicide,
229.26	or you know somebody who has,
232.26	talk about it; get help.
235.26	It's a conversation worth having
238.26	and an idea worth spreading.
241.26	Thank you.
243.26	(Applause)
