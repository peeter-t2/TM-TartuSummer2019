13.166	So, Ma was trying to explain
13.166	something to me
15.463	about Grandma and when they grew up,
17.278	but I couldn't pay attention to her
19.009	because I was five years old,
19.009	and I was petrified.
21.965	I had just seen The Green Lady.
24.974	Now, about a week earlier,
24.974	"I'd watched that movie ""Godzilla,"""
27.997	the one about that huge lizard-like beast
27.997	storming a major city,
31.168	and the thought of a green monster
31.168	coming for me was stuck in my mind.
35.85	And yet there I was,
35.85	at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,
39.163	just staring at her:
40.968	her horns,
42.151	her muscles --
43.336	all of it just frightened me.
44.741	And I didn't know
44.741	whether she was a monster or a hero.
49.138	So I decided to consult
49.138	the Google of the day --
52.384	"""Ma! Ma!"""
53.688	(Laughter)
55.608	My mother explained that The Green Lady
55.608	is actually the Statue of Liberty
60.073	and that she was waving immigrants in.
62.368	Now, the part of her explanation
62.368	that really messed with my young head
66.687	was the fact that, according to Ma,
69.346	long before us,
71.403	The Green Lady was actually brown,
75.202	brown like me,
76.579	and that she changed
76.579	colors over the years,
79.904	much like America.
81.262	Now, the part that really
81.262	is intriguing about this
86.58	is that when she changed colors,
88.235	she made me think about myself.
90.481	It all made sense to me,
91.9	because as a first-generation American,
93.921	I was surrounded by immigrants.
95.422	In fact, within my immediate social circle
95.422	of the people who support me,
99.256	who enrich my life,
100.568	at least two are foreign-born.
103.199	My life as a US citizen is in many ways
103.199	shaped by newcomers,
106.875	and chances are,
108.058	so is yours.
109.534	There are more than 40 million
109.534	immigrants in the USA.
113.211	According to census data,
114.745	a quarter of the nation's children
114.745	have at least one foreign-born parent.
119.431	I know all these statistics
119.431	because I study global migration patterns.
124.566	I'm a journalist,
124.566	and for the last few years,
126.752	I've been documenting
126.752	the lives of US citizens
129.183	who've lost people to deportation.
131.135	And the numbers are enormous.
134.036	From 2008 to 2016,
136.608	more than three million people
136.608	"were ""ordered removed"" --"
139.926	that's the technical term
139.926	for being deported.
143.415	There is an economic, a political,
143.415	a psychological and an emotional cost
148.956	to those deportations --
150.876	the moments when these circles are broken.
153.702	I once asked a US soldier,
155.472	"""Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"""
157.831	And she told me,
159.034	"""Because I'm proud to defend my country."""
161.044	But I pressed to know --
162.234	"""Really, when you're on base,"
164.115	and you hear bombs
164.115	exploding in the distance,
166.378	and you see soldiers coming back
166.378	who are gravely injured,
170.179	in that moment,
170.179	when you know you could be next,
174.362	"what does 'my country' mean?"""
176.806	She looked at me.
178.568	"""My country is my wife,"
180.459	my family,
181.797	"my friends, my soldiers."""
183.381	What she was telling me
184.722	"is that ""my country"" is a collection"
184.722	of these strong relationships;
188.114	these social circles.
190.406	When the social circles are weakened,
192.65	a country itself is weaker.
195.255	We're missing a crucial aspect
195.255	in the debate about immigration policy.
198.869	Rather than focusing on individuals,
200.916	we should focus
200.916	on the circles around them,
203.967	because these are the people
203.967	who are left behind:
206.98	the voters, the taxpayers,
208.884	the ones who are suffering that loss.
211.186	And it's not just the children
211.186	of the deported
213.492	who are impacted.
214.857	You have brothers and sisters
214.857	who are separated by borders.
217.758	You have classmates, teachers,
217.758	law enforcement officers,
220.589	technologists, scientists, doctors,
222.845	who are all scrambling
222.845	to make sense of new realities
226.587	when their social circles are broken.
229.885	These are the real lives
229.885	behind all these statistics
233.564	that dominate discussions
233.564	about immigration policy.
236.036	But we don't often think about them.
238.021	And I'm trying to change that.
239.917	Here's just one of the real-life stories
239.917	that I've collected.
244.55	And it still haunts me.
246.482	I met Ramon and his son in 2016,
250.251	the same year both of them
250.251	were being ordered out of the country.
254.459	Ramon was being deported to Latin America,
258.373	while his son, who was a sergeant
258.373	in the US military,
261.722	was being deployed.
264.596	Deported ...
266.479	deployed.
268.308	If you just look at Ramon's case,
271.318	it wouldn't be clear how deeply
271.318	connected to the country he is.
275.307	But consider his son:
277.159	a US citizen defending a country
277.159	that's banished his father.
281.499	The social circle is what's key here.
283.955	Here's another example
283.955	that illustrates those critical bonds.
287.408	A group of citizens in Philadelphia
287.408	were concerned about their jobs,
290.77	because the legal owner
290.77	of the restaurant where they worked
293.785	was an undocumented immigrant,
295.549	and immigration officials
295.549	had picked him up.
298.218	They rallied behind him.
299.585	An immigration lawyer argued
301.032	he was too important
301.032	to the local community
303.23	to be deported.
304.702	At the hearing, they even submitted
304.702	restaurant reviews --
308.784	restaurant reviews!
310.645	In the end, a judge exercised
310.645	"what's called ""judicial discretion"""
315.337	and allowed him to stay in the country,
317.297	but only because they considered
317.297	the social circle.
321.647	There are 23 million
321.647	noncitizens in the USA,
326.434	according to verifiable federal data.
328.526	And that doesn't include the undocumented,
330.712	because numbers for that population
330.712	are at best complex estimates.
334.09	Let's just work with what we have.
336.372	That's 23 million social circles --
339.438	about 100 million individuals
342.367	whose lives could be impacted
342.367	by deportation.
345.49	And the stress of it all is trickling down
345.49	through the population.
349.341	A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents
352.986	found that 30 percent
352.986	of citizens in LA County
356.783	are stressed about deportation,
359.128	not because they themselves
359.128	could be removed,
362.128	but rather, because members
362.128	of their social circle were at risk.
367.823	I am not suggesting that no one
367.823	should ever be deported;
370.542	don't confuse me with that.
372.417	But what I am saying is that we need
372.417	to look at the bigger picture.
377.692	If you are within the sound of my voice,
380.069	I want you to close your eyes for a moment
382.543	and examine your own social circle.
385.923	Who are your foreign-born?
388.12	What would it feel like
388.12	if the circle were broken?
392.488	Share your story.
394.55	I'm building a global archive
394.55	of first-person accounts
397.198	and linking them with mapping technology,
399.483	so that we can see exactly
399.483	where these circles break,
403.411	because this is not
403.411	just an American issue.
406.816	There are a quarter-billion migrants
406.816	around the world;
410.061	people living, loving and learning
410.061	in countries where they were not born.
414.16	And in my career, in my life,
414.16	I've been one of them:
416.816	in China, in Africa, in Europe.
419.822	And each time I become
419.822	one of these foreigners --
422.996	one of these strange-looking
422.996	guys in a new land --
426.173	I can't help but think back to that day
428.166	when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom
430.546	all those decades ago,
432.474	when I was scared,
434.096	and I had just spotted that green lady.
437.624	And I guess the question
437.624	that I keep on thinking about
441.754	when I see her
443.03	and all the younger replicas of her
443.03	that are so obviously brown,
447.314	and even the paintings
447.314	that showcase her in the beginning
450.151	as not quite green --
453.532	when I look at all of that,
456.038	the question that my research
456.038	seeks to answer
459.41	becomes, to me, the same one
459.41	that confounded me all those years ago:
464.652	Is she a monster
467.011	or a hero?
469.271	Thank you.
470.445	(Applause)
