12.536	So I wanted to tell a story
13.819	that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book,
17.291	and it's a story of something that happened
20.838	3,000 years ago,
22.411	when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
25.638	And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah
28.37	in what is now Israel.
30.7	And the reason the story obsessed me is that
32.948	I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it
36.034	and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
40.14	Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border,
44.957	there's a mountain range.
46.273	Still same is true of Israel today.
48.132	And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities
51.065	of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.
55.523	And then there's a coastal plain
57.748	along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.
61.103	And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain
64.503	is an area called the Shephelah,
66.436	which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west,
70.855	and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah
74.034	to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.
76.787	And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know
78.481	it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.
80.889	It's gorgeous, with forests of oak
83.807	and wheat fields and vineyards.
86.222	But more importantly, though, in the history of that region,
89.601	it's served, it's had a real strategic function,
93.366	and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies
96.279	on the coastal plain find their way,
98.862	get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.
102.484	And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.
105.511	The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies
109.788	of the Kingdom of Israel,
111.29	are living in the coastal plain.
113.002	They're originally from Crete. They're a seafaring people.
116.298	And they may start to make their way
118.721	through one of the valleys of the Shephelah
120.961	up into the mountains,
122.128	because what they want to do is occupy the highland area
124.384	right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.
128.385	And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul,
131.65	obviously catches wind of this,
133.383	and Saul brings his army down from the mountains
136.252	and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah,
139.907	one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.
142.365	And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge,
145.233	and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge,
149.49	and the two armies just sit there for weeks
152.225	and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.
154.347	Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side
156.82	you've got to come down the mountain into the valley
160.076	and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.
162.593	So finally, to break the deadlock,
164.785	the Philistines send their mightiest warrior
167.999	down into the valley floor, and he calls out
170.476	and he says to the Israelites,
171.932	"""Send your mightiest warrior down,"
174.56	"and we'll have this out, just the two of us."""
176.567	This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.
180.402	It was a way of settling disputes
182.197	without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.
186.321	And the Philistine who is sent down,
189.281	their mighty warrior, is a giant.
191.448	He's 6 foot 9.
193.223	He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor,
197.936	and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin
200.995	and he's got his spear. He is absolutely terrifying.
203.723	And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.
208.213	It's a death wish, right? There's no way they think they can take him.
212.848	And finally the only person who will come forward
215.141	is this young shepherd boy,
217.652	"and he goes up to Saul and he says, ""I'll fight him."""
220.33	"And Saul says, ""You can't fight him. That's ridiculous."
223.448	"You're this kid. This is this mighty warrior."""
225.77	"But the shepherd is adamant. He says, ""No, no, no,"
228.193	you don't understand, I have been defending my flock
231.186	"against lions and wolves for years. I think I can do it."""
235.355	And Saul has no choice. He's got no one else who's come forward.
238.569	"So he says, ""All right."""
239.91	And then he turns to the kid, and he says,
241.122	"""But you've got to wear this armor. You can't go as you are."""
244.816	So he tries to give the shepherd his armor,
247.219	"and the shepherd says, ""No."""
248.47	"He says, ""I can't wear this stuff."""
250.883	"The Biblical verse is, ""I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"""
254.957	"meaning, ""I've never worn armor before. You've got to be crazy."""
258.134	So he reaches down instead on the ground
260.74	and picks up five stones
262.495	and puts them in his shepherd's bag
264.956	and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.
269.468	And the giant sees this figure approaching,
271.674	"and calls out, ""Come to me so I can feed your flesh"
274.817	"to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field."""
278.794	He issues this kind of taunt towards this person
282.229	coming to fight him.
283.964	And the shepherd draws closer and closer,
287.31	and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.
290.298	That's all he's carrying.
291.47	Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff,
293.338	and he says -- he's insulted --
295.91	"""Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?"""
299.267	And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones
302.33	out of his pocket, puts it in his sling
305.57	and rolls it around and lets it fly
307.865	and it hits the giant right between the eyes --
310.266	right here, in his most vulnerable spot --
312.364	and he falls down either dead or unconscious,
315.685	and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword
318.179	and cuts off his head,
319.865	and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.
325.416	And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath
329.777	and the name of the shepherd boy is David,
332.306	and the reason that story has obsessed me
335.436	over the course of writing my book
336.874	is that everything I thought I knew about that story
339.966	turned out to be wrong.
342.717	So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?
346.505	In fact, that term, David and Goliath,
348.642	has entered our language as a metaphor for
351.623	improbable victories
353.161	by some weak party over someone far stronger.
356.272	Now why do we call David an underdog?
358.462	Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid,
361.937	a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.
365.473	We also call him an underdog
367.128	because Goliath is an experienced warrior,
371.05	and David is just a shepherd.
372.986	But most importantly, we call him an underdog
375.336	because all he has is -- it's that Goliath is outfitted with
380.346	all of this modern weaponry,
382.351	this glittering coat of armor
384.127	and a sword and a javelin and a spear,
387.962	and all David has is this sling.
391.792	Well, let's start there with the phrase
393.49	"""All David has is this sling,"""
395.934	because that's the first mistake that we make.
398.801	In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.
402.358	There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
405.789	There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers,
408.915	armed foot soldiers with swords and shields
411.805	and some kind of armor.
413.305	And there's artillery, and artillery are archers,
416.533	but, more importantly, slingers.
418.705	And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch
421.766	with two long cords attached to it,
424.563	and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball,
427.765	inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this
430.886	and they let one of the cords go,
433.529	and the effect is to send the projectile forward
437.399	towards its target.
440.704	That's what David has, and it's important to understand
443.439	that that sling is not a slingshot.
446.286	It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.
448.905	It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
452.73	When David rolls it around like this,
455.706	he's turning the sling around probably
458.935	at six or seven revolutions per second,
461.607	and that means that when the rock is released,
465.452	it's going forward really fast,
467.652	probably 35 meters per second.
469.425	That's substantially faster than a baseball
472.99	thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.
476.623	More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah
480.506	were not normal rocks. They were barium sulphate,
483.162	which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.
486.481	If you do the calculations on the ballistics,
489.118	on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling,
493.002	it's roughly equal to the stopping power
495.323	of a [.45 caliber] handgun.
498.88	This is an incredibly devastating weapon.
501.874	Accuracy, we know from historical records
506.472	that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit
510.97	and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.
516.993	From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers
519.963	were capable of hitting birds in flight.
522.321	They were incredibly accurate.
524.755	When David lines up -- and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath,
528.312	he's quite close to Goliath --
529.921	when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath,
533.336	he has every intention and every expectation
536.398	of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot
539.101	between his eyes.
540.429	If you go back over the history of ancient warfare,
542.445	you will find time and time again
545.257	that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry
549.26	in one kind of battle or another.
554.285	So what's Goliath? He's heavy infantry,
558.181	and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel
563.38	is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.
567.235	"When he says, ""Come to me that I might"
569.406	"feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"""
572.358	"the key phrase is ""Come to me."""
574.358	Come up to me because we're going to fight,
576.496	hand to hand, like this.
578.207	Saul has the same expectation.
580.335	"David says, ""I want to fight Goliath,"""
582.694	and Saul tries to give him his armor,
584.515	"because Saul is thinking, ""Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,'"
587.242	you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,'
590.509	"infantry on infantry."""
592.697	But David has absolutely no expectation.
595.671	He's not going to fight him that way. Why would he?
598.222	He's a shepherd. He's spent his entire career
601.23	using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.
605.443	That's where his strength lies.
607.193	So here he is, this shepherd, experienced
609.725	in the use of a devastating weapon,
611.764	up against this lumbering giant
614.158	weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor
617.458	and these incredibly heavy weapons
618.959	that are useful only in short-range combat.
622.056	Goliath is a sitting duck. He doesn't have a chance.
626.793	So why do we keep calling David an underdog,
629.599	and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?
635.423	There's a second piece of this that's important.
638.263	It's not just that we misunderstand David
641.661	and his choice of weaponry.
643.566	It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.
646.905	Goliath is not what he seems to be.
650.139	There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text,
654.127	things that are in retrospect quite puzzling
656.932	and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.
660.709	So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath
664.086	is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.
668.051	Now that is weird, right?
670.26	Here is this mighty warrior
672.39	challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.
675.197	Why is he being led by the hand
677.909	by some young boy, presumably,
680.959	to the point of combat?
683.421	Secondly, the Bible story makes special note
687.775	of how slowly Goliath moves,
690.864	another odd thing to say when you're describing
692.89	the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.
696.94	And then there's this whole weird thing
698.763	about how long it takes Goliath to react
702.575	to the sight of David.
704.571	So David's coming down the mountain,
707.349	and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.
711.286	There is nothing about him that says,
713.254	"""I am about to fight you like this."""
715.288	He's not even carrying a sword.
717.019	Why does Goliath not react to that?
719.701	It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.
723.929	And then there's that strange comment he makes to David:
727.876	"""Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"""
732.171	Sticks? David only has one stick.
735.994	Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal
738.253	of speculation within the medical community over the years
741.294	about whether there is something
743.82	fundamentally wrong with Goliath,
746.709	an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.
750.118	There have been many articles written.
751.28	The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal,
755.274	and it started a chain of speculation
757.629	that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.
760.752	So Goliath is head and shoulders above
763.675	all of his peers in that era,
765.837	and usually when someone is that far out of the norm,
769.819	there's an explanation for it.
771.416	So the most common form of giantism
774.649	is a condition called acromegaly,
777.384	and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor
780.287	on your pituitary gland
782.79	that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.
785.506	And throughout history, many of the most famous giants
789.065	have all had acromegaly.
790.834	So the tallest person of all time
792.898	was a guy named Robert Wadlow
794.465	who was still growing when he died at the age of 24
797.516	and he was 8 foot 11.
800.405	He had acromegaly.
801.819	Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?
804.354	Famous. He had acromegaly.
806.037	There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
810.576	Anyone who's unusually tall,
811.654	that's the first explanation we come up with.
814.407	And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects
818.402	associated with it,
819.627	principally having to do with vision.
823.189	The pituitary tumor, as it grows,
826.485	often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain,
830.533	with the result that people with acromegaly
833.037	have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
838.508	So when people have started to speculate
841.101	about what might have been wrong with Goliath,
844.332	"they've said, ""Wait a minute,"
845.243	he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone
848.433	"who has acromegaly."""
850.006	And that would also explain so much of what was strange
852.99	about his behavior that day.
855.117	Why does he move so slowly
856.938	and have to be escorted down into the valley floor
860.466	by an attendant?
861.825	Because he can't make his way on his own.
864.813	Why is he so strangely oblivious to David
868.07	that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him
870.719	until the very last moment?
872.866	Because he can't see him.
875.375	"When he says, ""Come to me that I might feed your flesh"
878.692	"to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"""
881.188	"the phrase ""come to me"" is a hint also of his vulnerability."
885.832	Come to me because I can't see you.
888.816	"And then there's, ""Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?"""
894.03	He sees two sticks when David has only one.
899.36	So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge
902.324	looking down on him thought he was
904.521	this extraordinarily powerful foe.
907.632	What they didn't understand was that
909.608	the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength
912.905	was also the source of his greatest weakness.
916.66	And there is, I think, in that,
918.617	a very important lesson for all of us.
921.822	Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.
925.684	And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.
929.173	Thank you.
930.96	(Applause)
