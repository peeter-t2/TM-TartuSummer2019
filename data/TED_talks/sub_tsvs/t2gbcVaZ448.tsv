13.162	When I was young,
13.162	I prided myself as a nonconformist
17.704	in the conservative
17.704	U.S. state I live in, Kansas.
22.429	I didn't follow along with the crowd.
24.742	I wasn't afraid to try
24.742	weird clothing trends or hairstyles.
28.173	I was outspoken and extremely social.
31.762	Even these pictures and postcards 
31.762	of my London semester abroad 16 years ago
38.093	show that I obviously didn't care
38.093	if I was perceived as weird or different.
44.097	(Laughter)
46.681	But that same year 
46.681	I was in London, 16 years ago,
51.29	I realized something about myself
51.29	that actually was somewhat unique,
56.699	and that changed everything.
61.169	I became the opposite
61.169	of who I thought I once was.
65.079	I stayed in my room
65.079	instead of socializing.
68.005	I stopped engaging in clubs
68.005	and leadership activities.
72.385	I didn't want to stand out
72.385	in the crowd anymore.
76.26	I told myself it was because
76.26	I was growing up and maturing,
80.325	not that I was suddenly
80.325	looking for acceptance.
83.559	I had always assumed I was immune
83.559	to needing acceptance.
86.58	After all, I was a bit unconventional.
89.814	But I realize now
91.351	that the moment I realized
91.351	something was different about me
95.516	was the exact same moment
95.516	that I began conforming and hiding.
101.728	Hiding is a progressive habit,
104.2	and once you start hiding,
105.948	it becomes harder and harder
105.948	to step forward and speak out.
111.888	In fact, even now,
113.822	when I was talking to people
113.822	about what this talk was about,
117.697	I made up a cover story
119.533	and I even hid the truth
119.533	about my TED Talk.
124.388	So it is fitting and scary
129.329	that I have returned 
129.329	to this city 16 years later
133.519	and I have chosen this stage
133.519	to finally stop hiding.
140.093	What have I been hiding
140.093	for 16 years?
146.205	I am a lesbian.
149.602	(Applause)
165.513	Thank you.
168.038	I've struggled to say those words,
170.397	because I didn't want
170.397	to be defined by them.
173.573	Every time I would think
173.573	about coming out in the past,
176.202	I would think to myself,
176.202	but I just want to be known as Morgana,
181.266	uniquely Morgana,
183.43	"but not ""my lesbian friend Morgana,"""
183.43	"or ""my gay coworker Morgana."""
188.439	Just Morgana.
190.893	For those of you from large
190.893	metropolitan areas,
194.302	this may not seem like a big deal to you.
196.895	It may seem strange 
196.895	that I have suppressed the truth
199.839	and hidden this for so long.
203.035	But I was paralyzed by my fear
203.035	of not being accepted.
208.818	And I'm not alone, of course.
211.459	A 2013 Deloitte study found
211.459	that a surprisingly large number of people
216.308	hide aspects of their identity.
219.078	Of all the employees they surveyed,
	of their behavior or their appearance
227.568	in order to fit in at work.
229.841	Of all the gay, lesbian
229.841	and bisexual employees,
	some aspects of themselves
239.26	so they would not 
239.26	"appear at work ""too gay."""
244.417	The study found that even in companies
247.34	with diversity policies
247.34	and inclusion programs,
251.253	employees struggle
251.253	to be themselves at work
254.006	because they believe 
254.006	conformity is critical
256.989	to their long-term career advancement.
260.496	And while I was surprised
260.496	that so many people just like me
265.438	waste so much energy
265.438	trying to hide themselves,
269.231	I was scared when I discovered
269.231	that my silence
273.122	has life-or-death consequences
273.122	and long-term social repercussions.
281.117	Twelve years:
283.308	the length by which 
283.308	life expectancy is shortened
286.979	for gay, lesbian and bisexual people
286.979	in highly anti-gay communities
293.017	compared to accepting communities.
296.603	Twelve years reduced life expectancy.
301.301	When I read that in The Advocate 
301.301	magazine this year,
304.429	I realized I could no longer
304.429	afford to keep silent.
308.904	The effects of personal stress and
308.904	social stigmas are a deadly combination.
316.692	The study found that gays
316.692	in anti-gay communities
319.963	had higher rates of heart disease,
319.963	violence and suicide.
325.71	What I once thought
325.71	was simply a personal matter
329.04	I realized had a ripple effect
331.226	that went into the workplace
331.226	and out into the community
333.82	for every story just like mine.
337.185	My choice to hide
337.185	and not share who I really am
341.005	may have inadvertently contributed
341.005	to this exact same environment
345.048	and atmosphere of discrimination.
348.192	I'd always told myself
348.192	there's no reason to share that I was gay,
353.592	but the idea that my silence
353.592	has social consequences
357.809	was really driven home this year
357.809	when I missed an opportunity
362.669	to change the atmosphere of discrimination
362.669	in my own home state of Kansas.
368.421	In February, the Kansas House of 
368.421	Representatives brought up a bill for vote
373.623	that would have essentially
373.623	allowed businesses
376.147	to use religious freedom as a reason
376.147	to deny gays services.
385.063	A former coworker and friend of mine
388.245	has a father who serves
388.245	in the Kansas House of Representatives.
393.068	He voted in favor of the bill,
398.253	in favor of a law that would allow 
398.253	businesses to not serve me.
406.647	How does my friend feel
408.436	about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
408.436	queer and questioning people?
413.922	How does her father feel?
416.611	I don't know, because I was never honest 
416.611	with them about who I am.
422.499	And that shakes me to the core.
425.773	What if I had told her my story years ago?
429.204	Could she have told 
429.204	her father my experience?
431.853	Could I have ultimately
431.853	helped change his vote?
436.885	I will never know,
439.348	and that made me realize
439.348	I had done nothing
443.48	to try to make a difference.
447.053	How ironic that I work
447.053	in human resources,
451.074	a profession that works to welcome,
453.512	connect and encourage
453.512	the development of employees,
457.097	a profession that advocates
457.097	that the diversity of society
460.339	should be reflected in the workplace,
463.004	and yet I have done nothing
463.004	to advocate for diversity.
468.779	When I came to this company one year ago,
471.649	I thought to myself, this company 
471.649	has anti-discrimination policies
476.724	that protect gay, lesbian,
476.724	bisexual and transgender people.
480.777	Their commitment to diversity is evident
480.777	through their global inclusion programs.
486.483	When I walk through the doors
486.483	of this company, I will finally come out.
492.551	But I didn't.
494.54	Instead of taking advantage
494.54	of the opportunity,
498.25	I did nothing.
511.838	(Applause)
519.737	When I was looking through
519.737	my London journal and scrapbook
523.652	from my London semester
523.652	abroad 16 years ago,
526.902	I came across this modified quote
526.902	"from Toni Morrison's book, ""Paradise."""
533.547	"""There are more scary things"
533.547	"inside than outside."""
537.841	And then I wrote a note
537.841	to myself at the bottom:
541.099	"""Remember this."""
543.983	I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself
543.983	to get out and explore London,
548.685	but the message I missed was the need 
548.685	to start exploring and embracing myself.
555.762	What I didn't realize
555.762	until all these years later
559.465	is that the biggest obstacles
559.465	I will ever have to overcome
564.371	are my own fears and insecurities.
568.438	I believe that by facing my fears inside,
568.438	I will be able to change reality outside.
577.498	I made a choice today
579.791	to reveal a part of myself
579.791	that I have hidden for too long.
586.333	I hope that this means
586.333	I will never hide again,
590.644	and I hope that by coming out today,
590.644	I can do something to change the data
597.492	and also to help others who feel different
597.492	be more themselves and more fulfilled
603.903	in both their professional
603.903	and personal lives.
608.394	Thank you.
611.147	(Applause)
