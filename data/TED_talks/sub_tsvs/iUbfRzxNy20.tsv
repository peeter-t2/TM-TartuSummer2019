15.26	I think we have to do something
17.26	about a piece of the culture
17.26	of medicine that has to change.
20.26	And I think it starts
20.26	with one physician, and that's me.
23.26	And maybe I've been around long enough
25.26	that I can afford to give away
25.26	some of my false prestige
27.951	to be able to do that.
29.26	Before I actually begin
29.26	the meat of my talk,
31.38	let's begin with a bit of baseball.
33.26	Hey, why not?
35.26	We're near the end, we're getting
35.26	close to the World Series.
38.26	We all love baseball, don't we?
41.26	(Laughter)
43.26	Baseball is filled
43.26	with some amazing statistics.
46.26	And there's hundreds of them.
49.26	"""Moneyball"" is about to come out,"
49.26	and it's all about statistics
52.284	and using statistics to build
52.284	a great baseball team.
54.785	I'm going to focus on one stat
57.26	that I hope a lot of you have heard of.
59.26	It's called batting average.
61.26	So we talk about a 300,
61.26	a batter who bats 300.
64.26	That means that ballplayer
64.26	batted safely, hit safely
68.26	three times out of 10 at bats.
71.26	That means hit the ball into the outfield,
73.284	it dropped, it didn't get caught,
75.26	and whoever tried to throw it to first
75.26	base didn't get there in time
78.523	and the runner was safe.
80.26	Three times out of 10.
83.26	Do you know what they call a 300 hitter
86.26	in Major League Baseball?
88.26	Good, really good,
91.26	maybe an all-star.
94.26	Do you know what they call
96.26	a 400 baseball hitter?
98.26	That's somebody who hit, by the way,
100.26	four times safely out of every 10.
102.26	Legendary --
105.26	as in Ted Williams legendary --
107.26	the last Major League Baseball player
109.26	to hit over 400 during a regular season.
112.26	Now let's take this back
112.26	into my world of medicine
114.618	where I'm a lot more comfortable,
116.26	or perhaps a bit less comfortable
118.26	after what I'm going to talk to you about.
121.26	Suppose you have appendicitis
123.26	and you're referred to a surgeon
125.26	who's batting 400 on appendectomies.
127.26	(Laughter)
130.26	Somehow this isn't working out, is it?
133.26	Now suppose you live
135.26	in a certain part
135.26	of a certain remote place
138.26	and you have a loved one
140.26	who has blockages in two coronary arteries
143.26	and your family doctor refers
143.26	that loved one to a cardiologist
146.26	who's batting 200 on angioplasties.
150.26	But, but, you know what?
152.26	She's doing a lot better this year.
152.26	She's on the comeback trail.
154.26	And she's hitting a 257.
157.26	Somehow this isn't working.
159.26	But I'm going to ask you a question.
161.26	What do you think a batting average
163.26	for a cardiac surgeon
163.26	or a nurse practitioner
165.427	or an orthopedic surgeon,
167.26	an OBGYN, a paramedic
169.26	is supposed to be?
172.26	1,000, very good.
175.26	Now truth of the matter is,
177.26	nobody knows in all of medicine
179.26	what a good surgeon
181.26	or physician or paramedic
183.26	is supposed to bat.
185.26	What we do though is we send
185.26	each one of them, including myself,
187.26	out into the world
189.26	with the admonition, be perfect.
191.26	Never ever, ever make a mistake,
193.26	but you worry about the details,
193.26	about how that's going to happen.
196.427	And that was the message that I absorbed
198.427	when I was in med school.
200.26	I was an obsessive compulsive student.
203.26	In high school, a classmate once said
206.26	that Brian Goldman would study
206.26	for a blood test.
208.57	(Laughter)
211.26	And so I did.
213.26	And I studied in my little garret
215.26	at the nurses' residence
215.26	at Toronto General Hospital,
217.808	not far from here.
219.26	And I memorized everything.
221.26	I memorized in my anatomy class
223.26	the origins and exertions of every muscle,
225.284	every branch of every artery
225.284	that came off the aorta,
228.26	differential diagnoses obscure and common.
231.26	I even knew the differential diagnosis
233.26	in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.
235.284	And all the while,
237.26	I was amassing more and more knowledge.
239.26	And I did well, I graduated with honors,
241.26	cum laude.
243.26	And I came out of medical school
246.26	with the impression
248.26	that if I memorized everything
248.26	and knew everything,
250.713	or as much as possible,
252.26	as close to everything as possible,
254.26	that it would immunize me
254.26	against making mistakes.
257.26	And it worked
259.26	for a while,
262.26	until I met Mrs. Drucker.
265.26	I was a resident at a teaching
265.26	hospital here in Toronto
267.26	when Mrs. Drucker was brought
267.26	to the emergency department
270.26	of the hospital where I was working.
272.26	At the time I was assigned
272.26	to the cardiology service
274.76	on a cardiology rotation.
276.26	And it was my job,
278.26	when the emergency staff called
278.26	for a cardiology consult,
280.999	to see that patient in emerg.
283.26	and to report back to my attending.
285.26	And I saw Mrs. Drucker,
285.26	and she was breathless.
288.26	And when I listened to her,
288.26	she was making a wheezy sound.
291.26	And when I listened to her
291.26	chest with a stethoscope,
293.26	I could hear crackly sounds on both sides
295.26	that told me that she was in congestive
295.26	heart failure.
298.26	This is a condition
298.26	in which the heart fails,
301.26	and instead of being able
301.26	to pump all the blood forward,
303.26	some of the blood backs up into the lung,
303.26	the lungs fill up with blood,
306.26	and that's why you have
306.26	shortness of breath.
308.38	And that wasn't a difficult
308.38	diagnosis to make.
311.26	I made it and I set to work treating her.
314.26	I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications
314.26	to relieve the strain on her heart.
317.26	I gave her medications that we call
317.26	diuretics, water pills,
320.26	to get her to pee out the access fluid.
323.26	And over the course
323.26	of the next hour and a half or two,
325.904	she started to feel better.
327.26	And I felt really good.
330.26	And that's when I made my first mistake;
333.26	I sent her home.
335.26	Actually, I made two more mistakes.
338.26	I sent her home
340.26	without speaking to my attending.
342.26	I didn't pick up the phone and do
342.26	what I was supposed to do,
345.26	which was call my attending
345.26	and run the story by him
347.761	so he would have a chance
347.761	to see her for himself.
350.26	And he knew her,
352.26	he would have been able to furnish
352.26	additional information about her.
355.523	Maybe I did it for a good reason.
357.26	Maybe I didn't want to be
357.26	a high-maintenance resident.
360.26	Maybe I wanted to be so successful
362.26	and so able to take responsibility
364.26	that I would do so
366.26	and I would be able to take
366.26	care of my attending's patients
368.26	without even having to contact him.
370.26	The second mistake that I made was worse.
374.26	In sending her home,
376.26	I disregarded a little voice
376.26	deep down inside
378.427	that was trying to tell me,
380.26	"""Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this."""
383.26	In fact, so lacking in confidence was I
386.26	that I actually asked the nurse
388.26	who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,
390.26	"""Do you think it's okay if she goes home?"""
393.26	And the nurse thought about it
395.26	and said very matter-of-factly,
395.26	"""Yeah, I think she'll do okay."""
397.26	I can remember that like it was yesterday.
400.26	So I signed the discharge papers,
402.26	and an ambulance came, paramedics
402.26	came to take her home.
405.26	And I went back to my work on the wards.
408.26	All the rest of that day,
410.26	that afternoon,
412.26	I had this kind of gnawing
412.26	feeling inside my stomach.
415.26	But I carried on with my work.
418.26	And at the end of the day,
418.26	I packed up to leave the hospital
420.26	and walked to the parking lot
422.26	to take my car and drive home
424.26	when I did something
424.26	that I don't usually do.
428.26	I walked through the emergency
428.26	department on my way home.
431.26	And it was there that another nurse,
433.26	not the nurse who was looking
433.26	after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,
436.856	said three words to me
439.26	that are the three words
441.26	that most emergency
441.26	physicians I know dread.
444.26	Others in medicine dread them as well,
446.26	but there's something particular
446.26	about emergency medicine
448.999	because we see patients so fleetingly.
452.26	The three words are:
454.26	Do you remember?
458.26	"""Do you remember"
458.26	"that patient you sent home?"""
461.26	the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.
463.26	"""Well she's back,"""
465.26	in just that tone of voice.
467.26	Well she was back all right.
469.26	She was back and near death.
472.26	About an hour after she had arrived home,
474.26	after I'd sent her home,
476.26	she collapsed and her family called 911
479.26	and the paramedics brought her
479.26	back to the emergency department
481.26	where she had a blood pressure of 50,
483.26	which is in severe shock.
485.26	And she was barely breathing
485.26	and she was blue.
488.26	And the emerg. staff
488.26	pulled out all the stops.
491.26	They gave her medications
491.26	to raise her blood pressure.
494.26	They put her on a ventilator.
496.26	And I was shocked
499.26	and shaken to the core.
501.26	And I went through this roller coaster,
503.26	because after they stabilized her,
505.26	she went to the intensive care unit,
507.26	and I hoped against hope
507.26	that she would recover.
509.26	And over the next two or three days,
511.26	it was clear that she was never
511.26	going to wake up.
513.618	She had irreversible brain damage.
516.26	And the family gathered.
518.26	And over the course
518.26	of the next eight or nine days,
521.26	they resigned themselves
521.26	to what was happening.
523.523	And at about the nine day
523.523	mark, they let her go --
526.26	Mrs. Drucker,
528.26	a wife, a mother
530.26	and a grandmother.
533.26	They say you never forget the names
535.26	of those who die.
537.26	And that was my first time
537.26	to be acquainted with that.
540.26	Over the next few weeks,
542.26	I beat myself up
545.26	and I experienced for the first time
547.26	the unhealthy shame that exists
549.26	in our culture of medicine --
551.26	where I felt alone, isolated,
554.26	not feeling the healthy kind
554.26	of shame that you feel,
556.26	because you can't talk
556.26	about it with your colleagues.
558.808	You know that healthy kind,
560.26	when you betray a secret that a best
560.26	friend made you promise never to reveal
563.904	and then you get busted
565.26	and then your best friend confronts you
567.26	and you have terrible discussions,
569.26	but at the end of it
569.26	all that sick feeling guides you
572.26	and you say, I'll never
572.26	make that mistake again.
574.57	And you make amends and you
574.57	never make that mistake again.
577.57	That's the kind of shame
577.57	that is a teacher.
580.26	The unhealthy shame I'm talking about
582.26	is the one that makes you so sick inside.
585.26	It's the one that says,
587.26	not that what you did was bad,
589.26	but that you are bad.
591.26	And it was what I was feeling.
594.26	And it wasn't because of my attending;
594.26	he was a doll.
597.26	He talked to the family, and I'm quite
597.26	sure that he smoothed things over
600.713	and made sure that I didn't get sued.
603.26	And I kept asking myself these questions.
606.26	Why didn't I ask my attending?
606.26	Why did I send her home?
609.26	And then at my worst moments:
611.26	Why did I make such a stupid mistake?
614.26	Why did I go into medicine?
616.26	Slowly but surely,
618.26	it lifted.
620.26	I began to feel a bit better.
622.26	And on a cloudy day,
624.26	there was a crack in the clouds
624.26	and the sun started to come out
627.237	and I wondered,
628.26	maybe I could feel better again.
630.26	And I made myself a bargain
633.26	that if only I redouble
633.26	my efforts to be perfect
638.26	and never make another mistake again,
640.26	please make the voices stop.
642.26	And they did.
644.26	And I went back to work.
646.26	And then it happened again.
649.26	Two years later I was an attending
649.26	in the emergency department
652.26	at a community hospital
652.26	just north of Toronto,
654.475	and I saw a 25 year-old
654.475	man with a sore throat.
657.26	It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
659.26	He kept pointing here.
661.26	I looked at his throat,
661.26	it was a little bit pink.
663.618	And I gave him a prescription
663.618	for penicillin
665.738	and sent him on his way.
667.26	And even as he was walking out the door,
669.26	he was still sort
669.26	of pointing to his throat.
672.26	And two days later I came to do
672.26	my next emergency shift,
675.26	and that's when my chief asked
675.26	to speak to me quietly in her office.
678.523	And she said the three words:
682.26	Do you remember?
685.26	"""Do you remember that patient"
685.26	"you saw with the sore throat?"""
688.26	Well it turns out, he didn't
688.26	have a strep throat.
690.618	He had a potentially
690.618	life-threatening condition
692.881	called epiglottitis.
694.26	You can Google it,
696.26	but it's an infection, not
696.26	of the throat, but of the upper airway,
699.427	and it can actually cause
699.427	the airway to close.
702.26	And fortunately he didn't die.
705.26	He was placed on intravenous antibiotics
708.26	and he recovered after a few days.
710.26	And I went through the same period
710.26	of shame and recriminations
714.26	and felt cleansed and went back to work,
718.26	until it happened again
718.26	and again and again.
723.26	Twice in one emergency shift,
723.26	I missed appendicitis.
726.26	Now that takes some doing,
729.26	especially when you work in a hospital
731.26	that at the time saw
731.26	but 14 people a night.
734.26	Now in both cases, I didn't send them home
737.26	and I don't think there
737.26	was any gap in their care.
739.618	One I thought had a kidney stone.
741.26	I ordered a kidney X-ray. When
741.26	it turned out to be normal,
743.26	my colleague who was doing
743.26	a reassessment of the patient
746.26	noticed some tenderness in the right
746.26	lower quadrant and called the surgeons.
749.26	The other one had a lot of diarrhea.
751.26	I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him
754.26	and asked my colleague to reassess him.
757.26	And he did
759.26	and when he noticed some tenderness in the right
759.26	lower quadrant, called the surgeons.
761.26	In both cases,
763.26	they had their operations
763.26	and they did okay.
766.26	But each time,
768.26	they were gnawing at me, eating at me.
770.26	And I'd like to be able to say to you
772.26	that my worst mistakes only happened
772.26	in the first five years of practice
775.713	as many of my colleagues
775.713	say, which is total B.S.
778.26	(Laughter)
780.26	Some of my doozies have
780.26	been in the last five years.
786.26	Alone, ashamed and unsupported.
788.26	Here's the problem:
790.26	If I can't come clean
792.26	and talk about my mistakes,
796.26	if I can't find the still-small voice
798.26	that tells me what really happened,
800.26	how can I share it with my colleagues?
802.26	How can I teach them about what I did
805.26	so that they don't do the same thing?
809.26	If I were to walk into a room --
811.26	like right now, I have no
811.26	idea what you think of me.
814.26	When was the last time
814.26	you heard somebody talk
816.26	about failure after failure after failure?
818.284	Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party
820.26	and you might hear
820.26	about some other doctor,
822.332	but you're not going to hear somebody
824.26	talking about their own mistakes.
826.26	If I were to walk into a room
826.26	filled with my colleages
829.26	and ask for their support right now
831.26	and start to tell what I've just
831.26	told you right now,
833.713	I probably wouldn't get
833.713	through two of those stories
836.26	before they would start
836.26	to get really uncomfortable,
838.761	somebody would crack a joke,
840.26	they'd change the subject
840.26	and we would move on.
845.26	And in fact, if I knew
845.26	and my colleagues knew
848.26	that one of my orthopedic colleagues
848.26	took off the wrong leg in my hospital,
852.26	believe me, I'd have trouble
854.26	making eye contact with that person.
856.26	That's the system that we have.
858.26	It's a complete denial of mistakes.
861.26	It's a system
863.26	in which there are two kinds
863.26	of physicians --
867.26	those who make mistakes
869.26	and those who don't,
871.26	those who can't handle sleep
871.26	deprivation and those who can,
874.26	those who have lousy outcomes
876.26	and those who have great outcomes.
879.26	And it's almost
879.26	like an ideological reaction,
881.427	like the antibodies begin
881.427	to attack that person.
885.26	And we have this idea
887.26	that if we drive the people
887.26	who make mistakes
889.427	out of medicine,
891.26	what will we be left
891.26	with, but a safe system.
895.26	But there are two problems with that.
898.26	In my 20 years or so
900.26	of medical broadcasting and journalism,
903.26	I've made a personal study of medical
903.26	malpractice and medical errors
906.523	to learn everything I can,
908.26	from one of the first articles
908.26	I wrote for the Toronto Star
911.094	"to my show ""White Coat, Black Art."""
913.26	And what I've learned
915.26	is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
918.26	We work in a system
920.26	where errors happen every day,
922.26	where one in 10 medications
924.26	are either the wrong
924.26	medication given in hospital
926.618	or at the wrong dosage,
928.26	where hospital-acquired infections
928.26	are getting more and more numerous,
931.618	causing havoc and death.
934.26	In this country,
936.26	as many as 24,000 Canadians die
938.26	of preventable medical errors.
940.26	In the United States, the Institute
940.26	of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.
944.26	In both cases, these
944.26	are gross underestimates,
947.26	because we really aren't
947.26	ferreting out the problem
949.665	as we should.
951.26	And here's the thing.
954.26	In a hospital system
957.26	where medical knowledge is doubling
959.26	every two or three years,
959.26	we can't keep up with it.
962.26	Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
965.26	We can't get rid of it.
967.26	We have our cognitive biases,
969.26	so that I can take a perfect history
969.26	on a patient with chest pain.
972.427	Now take the same patient with chest pain,
974.451	make them moist and garrulous
976.26	and put a little bit
976.26	of alcohol on their breath,
978.26	and suddenly my history
978.26	is laced with contempt.
980.523	I don't take the same history.
982.26	I'm not a robot;
984.26	I don't do things the same way each time.
986.26	And my patients aren't cars;
988.26	they don't tell me their symptoms
988.26	in the same way each time.
991.26	Given all of that,
991.26	mistakes are inevitable.
994.26	So if you take the system,
994.26	as I was taught,
997.26	and weed out all the error-prone
997.26	health professionals,
1001.26	well there won't be anybody left.
1006.26	And you know that business
1008.26	about people not wanting
1010.26	to talk about their worst cases?
1013.26	"On my show, on ""White Coat, Black Art,"""
1015.26	I made it a habit of saying,
1015.26	"""Here's my worst mistake,"""
1017.904	I would say to everybody
1019.26	from paramedics to the chief
1019.26	of cardiac surgery,
1022.26	"""Here's my worst mistake,"""
1022.26	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
1024.26	"""What about yours?"" and I would point"
1024.26	the microphone towards them.
1027.427	And their pupils would dilate,
1029.26	they would recoil,
1031.26	then they would look down and swallow hard
1034.26	and start to tell me their stories.
1037.26	They want to tell their stories.
1037.26	They want to share their stories.
1040.426	They want to be able to say,
1042.26	"""Look, don't make the same mistake I did."""
1044.283	What they need is an environment
1044.283	to be able to do that.
1046.927	What they need is a redefined
1046.927	medical culture.
1050.26	And it starts
1050.26	with one physician at a time.
1053.26	The redefined physician is human,
1056.26	knows she's human,
1058.26	accepts it, isn't proud
1058.26	of making mistakes,
1060.331	but strives to learn one thing
1062.26	from what happened
1064.26	that she can teach to somebody else.
1066.26	She shares her experience with others.
1068.26	She's supportive when other
1068.26	people talk about their mistakes.
1071.26	And she points out other
1071.26	people's mistakes,
1073.332	not in a gotcha way,
1075.26	but in a loving, supportive way
1078.26	so that everybody can benefit.
1080.26	And she works in a culture of medicine
1082.26	that acknowledges
1084.26	that human beings run the system,
1086.26	and when human beings run the system,
1086.26	they will make mistakes from time to time.
1090.094	So the system is evolving
1093.26	to create backups
1097.26	that make it easier
1097.26	to detect those mistakes
1100.26	that humans inevitably make
1103.26	and also fosters
1103.26	in a loving, supportive way
1106.26	places where everybody who is observing
1109.26	in the health care system
1111.26	can actually point out things
1111.26	that could be potential mistakes
1114.26	and is rewarded for doing so,
1116.26	and especially people like me,
1116.26	when we do make mistakes,
1118.951	we're rewarded for coming clean.
1122.26	My name is Brian Goldman.
1125.26	I am a redefined physician.
1128.26	I'm human. I make mistakes.
1130.26	I'm sorry about that,
1132.26	but I strive to learn one thing
1134.26	that I can pass on to other people.
1137.26	I still don't know what you think of me,
1140.26	but I can live with that.
1142.26	And let me close
1142.26	with three words of my own:
1145.26	I do remember.
1149.26	(Applause)
