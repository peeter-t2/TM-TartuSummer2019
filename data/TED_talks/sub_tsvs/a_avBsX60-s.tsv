12.804	So, my mother's a pediatrician,
15.792	and when I was young,
15.792	she'd tell the craziest stories
19.63	that combined science
19.63	with her overactive imagination.
23.444	One of the stories she told
23.444	was that if you eat a lot of salt,
27.619	all of the blood rushes up your legs,
31.312	through your body,
32.588	and shoots out the top of your head,
34.691	killing you instantly.
36.417	(Laughter)
37.501	"She called it ""high blood pressure."""
39.337	(Laughter)
41.005	This was my first experience
41.005	with science fiction,
43.939	and I loved it.
45.771	So when I started to write
45.771	my own science fiction and fantasy,
48.922	I was surprised that it
48.922	was considered un-African.
52.114	So naturally, I asked, what is African?
54.753	And this is what I know so far:
57.555	Africa is important.
59.843	Africa is the future.
61.298	It is, though.
63.074	And Africa is a serious place
63.074	where only serious things happen.
67.421	So when I present my work somewhere,
67.421	someone will always ask,
71.92	"""What's so important about it?"
74.515	How does it deal with real African issues
77.058	"like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?"""
82.45	And it doesn't.
84.107	My work is about Nairobi pop bands
84.107	that want to go to space
89.468	or about seven-foot-tall robots
92.62	that fall in love.
94.493	It's nothing incredibly important.
97.73	It's just fun, fierce and frivolous,
101.137	as frivolous as bubble gum --
103.772	"""AfroBubbleGum."""
106.241	So I'm not saying that
106.241	agenda art isn't important;
109.53	I'm the chairperson of a charity
111.829	that deals with films and theaters
111.829	that write about HIV and radicalization
118.81	and female genital mutilation.
121.097	It's vital and important art,
123.402	but it cannot be the only art
123.402	that comes out of the continent.
128.192	We have to tell more stories
130.552	that are vibrant.
133.097	The danger of the single story
133.097	is still being realized.
137.879	And maybe it's because of the funding.
139.722	A lot of art is still dependent
139.722	on developmental aid.
143.649	So art becomes a tool for agenda.
147.73	Or maybe it's because we've only seen
147.73	one image of ourselves for so long
152.172	that that's all we know how to create.
154.643	Whatever the reason, we need a new way,
157.84	and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.
160.391	It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.
164.489	It's the advocacy of art
164.489	that is not policy-driven
167.509	or agenda-driven
169.065	or based on education,
171.028	just for the sake of imagination:
174.418	AfroBubbleGum art.
176.649	And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.
179.059	We have to judge our work
179.059	for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.
183.129	We have to have tests
183.129	that are similar to the Bechdel test,
189.184	and ask questions like:
191.475	Are two or more Africans
191.475	in this piece of fiction healthy?
196.916	Are those same Africans financially stable
196.916	and not in need of saving?
203.193	Are they having fun and enjoying life?
206.105	And if we can answer yes
206.105	to two or more of these questions,
209.227	then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.
211.855	(Laughter)
213.428	(Applause)
218.229	And fun is political,
220.267	because imagine if we have
220.267	images of Africans who were vibrant
224.543	and loving and thriving
226.61	and living a beautiful, vibrant life.
228.922	What would we think of ourselves then?
231.327	Would we think that maybe
231.327	we're worthy of more happiness?
234.799	Would we think of our shared humanity
234.799	through our shared joy?
239.387	I think of these things when I create.
241.767	I think of the people and the places
241.767	that give me immeasurable joy,
244.992	and I work to represent them.
246.999	And that's why I write stories
248.66	about futuristic girls that risk
248.66	everything to save plants
253.154	or to race camels
255.407	or even just to dance,
257.871	to honor fun,
259.616	because my world is mostly happy.
261.763	And I know happiness is a privilege
261.763	in this current splintered world
265.557	where remaining hopeful
265.557	requires diligence.
271.105	But maybe, if you join me
271.105	in creating, curating and commissioning
276.472	more AfroBubbleGum art,
278.525	there might be hope
278.525	for a different view of the world,
281.327	a happy Africa view
283.507	where children are strangely traumatized
285.559	by their mother's dark sense of humor,
287.526	(Laughter)
288.587	but also they're claiming fun,
288.587	fierce and frivolous art
293.173	in the name of all things
293.173	unseriously African.
297.91	Because we're AfroBubbleGumists
300.556	and there's so many more of us
300.556	than you can imagine.
303.91	Thank you so much.
305.138	(Applause)
