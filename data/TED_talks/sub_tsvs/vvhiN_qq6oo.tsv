16.26	This is Shivdutt Yadav,
18.26	and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.
21.26	Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office
24.26	in Uttar Pradesh,
26.26	and he discovered
28.26	that official records were listing him as dead.
30.26	His land was no longer registered
32.26	in his name.
34.26	His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,
37.26	were also listed as dead.
39.26	Family members had bribed officials
41.26	to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land
44.26	by having the brothers declared dead,
46.26	allowing them to inherit
48.26	their father's share of the ancestral farmland.
51.26	Because of this, all three brothers and their families
54.26	had to vacate their home.
57.26	According to the Yadav family,
59.26	the local court has been scheduling a case review
61.26	since 2001,
63.26	but a judge has never appeared.
66.26	There are several instances in Uttar Pradesh
68.26	of people dying
70.26	before their case is given a proper review.
73.26	Shivdutt's father's death and a want for his property
76.26	led to this corruption.
79.26	He was laid to rest in the Ganges River,
81.26	where the dead are cremated along the banks of the river
83.26	or tied to heavy stones and sunk in the water.
87.26	Photographing these brothers
89.26	was a disorienting exchange
91.26	because on paper they don't exist,
93.26	and a photograph is so often used as an evidence of life.
96.26	Yet, these men remain dead.
99.26	This quandary led to the title of the project,
101.26	which considers in many ways
104.26	that we are all the living dead
106.26	and that we in some ways represent
108.26	ghosts of the past and the future.
113.26	So this story is the first of 18 chapters
115.26	"in my new body of work titled ""A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters."""
120.26	And for this work,
122.26	I traveled around the world over a four-year period
124.26	researching and recording bloodlines
126.26	and their related stories.
129.26	I was interested in ideas surrounding fate
132.26	and whether our fate is determined
134.26	by blood, chance or circumstance.
139.26	The subjects I documented
141.26	ranged from feuding families in Brazil
143.26	to victims of genocide in Bosnia
145.26	to the first woman to hijack an airplane
147.26	and the living dead in India.
150.26	In each chapter, you can see the external forces
153.26	of governance, power and territory or religion
156.26	colliding with the internal forces
158.26	of psychological and physical inheritance.
162.26	Each work that I make
164.26	is comprised of three segments.
166.26	On the left are one or more portrait panels
169.26	in which I systematically order
171.26	the members of a given bloodline.
173.26	This is followed by a text panel, it's designed in scroll form,
176.26	in which I construct
178.26	the narrative at stake.
180.26	And then on the right is what I refer to as a footnote panel.
183.26	It's a space that's more intuitive
185.26	in which I present fragments of the story,
187.26	beginnings of other stories, photographic evidence.
190.26	And it's meant to kind of reflect
193.26	how we engage with histories or stories on the Internet,
195.26	in a less linear form.
197.26	So it's more disordered.
199.26	And this disorder is in direct contrast
202.26	to the unalterable order of a bloodline.
207.26	In my past projects I've often worked in serial form,
210.26	documenting things that have
212.26	the appearance of being comprehensive
214.26	through a determined title and a determined presentation,
217.26	but in fact, are fairly abstract.
220.26	In this project I wanted to work in the opposite direction
222.26	and find an absolute catalog,
225.26	something that I couldn't interrupt, curate or edit by choice.
229.26	This led me to blood.
231.26	A bloodline is determined and ordered.
234.26	But the project centers
236.26	on the collision of order and disorder --
238.26	the order of blood butting up against the disorder
241.26	represented in the often chaotic and violent stories
244.26	that are the subjects of my chapters.
247.26	In chapter two, I photograph the descendants of Arthur Ruppin.
251.26	He was sent in 1907 to Palestine
254.26	by the Zionist organization
256.26	to look at areas for Jewish settlement
259.26	and acquire land for Jewish settlement.
262.26	He oversaw land acquisition
264.26	on behalf of the Palestine Land Development Company
267.26	whose work led to the establishment
269.26	of a Jewish state.
272.26	Through my research at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem,
275.26	I wanted to look at the early paperwork
277.26	of the establishment of the Jewish state.
279.26	And I found these maps which you see here.
282.26	And these are studies
284.26	commissioned by the Zionist organization
286.26	for alternative areas for Jewish settlement.
288.26	In this, I was interested in the consequences
290.26	of geography
292.26	and imagining how the world would be different
294.26	if Israel were in Uganda,
297.26	which is what these maps demonstrate.
299.26	These archives in Jerusalem,
301.26	they maintain a card index file
303.26	of the earliest immigrants and applicants for immigration
306.26	to Palestine, and later Israel,
308.26	from 1919 to 1965.
313.26	Chapter three:
315.26	Joseph Nyamwanda Jura Ondijo
318.26	treated patients outside of Kisumu, Kenya
321.26	for AIDS, tuberculosis, infertility,
324.26	mental illness, evil spirits.
326.26	He's most often paid for his services
329.26	in cash, cows or goats.
332.26	But sometimes when his female patients
334.26	can't afford his services,
336.26	their families give the women to Jura
339.26	in exchange for medical treatment.
341.26	As a result of these transactions,
343.26	Jura has nine wives,
347.26	and 63 grandchildren.
349.26	In his bloodline you see the children and grandchildren here.
354.26	Two of his wives were brought to him
356.26	suffering from infertility
358.26	and he cured them,
361.26	three for evil spirits,
363.26	one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain
366.26	and two wives Ondijo claims he took for love,
369.26	paying their families a total of 16 cows.
372.26	One wife deserted him
374.26	and another passed away during treatment for evil spirits.
378.26	Polygamy is widely practiced in Kenya.
381.26	It's common among a privileged class
383.26	capable of paying numerous dowries
385.26	and keeping multiple homes.
387.26	Instances of prominent social and political figures
390.26	in polygamous relationships
392.26	has led to the perception of polygamy
395.26	as a symbol of wealth, status and power.
400.26	You may notice in several of the chapters that I photographed
403.26	there are empty portraits.
405.26	These empty portraits represent individuals,
407.26	living individuals, who couldn't be present.
410.26	And the reasons for their absence are given in my text panel.
413.26	They include dengue fever,
415.26	imprisonment, army service,
417.26	women not allowed to be photographed
419.26	for religious and cultural reasons.
422.26	And in this particular chapter,
424.26	it's children whose mothers
426.26	wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot
428.26	for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.
434.26	Twenty-four European rabbits
436.26	were brought to Australia in 1859
438.26	by a British settler
440.26	for sporting purposes, for hunting.
443.26	And within a hundred years,
445.26	that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
449.26	The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia,
452.26	and it competes with native wildlife
454.26	and damages native plants
456.26	and degrades the land.
458.26	Since the 1950s,
460.26	Australia has been introducing lethal diseases
463.26	into the wild rabbit population
465.26	to control growth.
467.26	These rabbits were bred at a government facility,
470.26	Biosecurity Queensland,
472.26	where they bred three bloodlines of rabbits
474.26	and have infected them with a lethal disease
476.26	and are monitoring their progress
478.26	to see if it will effectively kill them.
481.26	So they're testing its virulence.
483.26	During the course of this trial, all of the rabbits died,
486.26	except for a few, which were euthanized.
489.26	Haigh's Chocolate,
491.26	in collaboration
493.26	with the Foundation for Rabbit-Free Australia,
496.26	stopped all production of the Easter Bunny in chocolate
499.26	and has replaced it with the Easter Bilby.
502.26	Now this was done to counter
504.26	the annual celebration of rabbits
506.26	and presumably make the public more comfortable
508.26	with the killing of rabbits
510.26	and promote an animal that's native to Australia,
512.26	and actually an animal that is threatened
514.26	by the European rabbit.
518.26	In chapter seven, I focus on the effects
520.26	of a genocidal act
522.26	on one bloodline.
524.26	So over a two-day period,
526.26	six individuals from this bloodline
528.26	were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
530.26	This is the only work
532.26	in which I visually represent the dead.
534.26	But I only represent those
536.26	that were killed in the Srebrenica massacre,
538.26	which is recorded as the largest mass murder in Europe
541.26	since the Second World War.
544.26	And during this massacre,
546.26	8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys
548.26	were systematically executed.
551.26	So when you look at a detail of this work,
554.26	you can see, the man on the upper-left
556.26	is the father of the woman sitting next to him.
558.26	Her name is Zumra.
560.26	She is followed by her four children,
563.26	all of whom were killed in the Srebrenica massacre.
566.26	Following those four children is Zumra's younger sister
569.26	who is then followed by her children
571.26	who were killed as well.
574.26	During the time I was in Bosnia,
576.26	the mortal remains of Zumra's eldest son
578.26	were exhumed from a mass grave.
580.26	And I was therefore able to photograph
582.26	the fully assembled remains.
584.26	However, the other individuals
586.26	are represented by these blue slides,
588.26	which show tooth and bone samples
590.26	that were matched to DNA evidence collected from family members
593.26	to prove they were the identities
595.26	of those individuals.
597.26	They've all been given a proper burial,
599.26	so what remains are these blue slides
601.26	at the International Commission for Missing Persons.
606.26	These are personal effects
608.26	dug up from a mass grave
610.26	that are awaiting identification from family members
613.26	and graffiti at the Potochari battery factory,
616.26	which was where the Dutch U.N. soldiers were staying,
619.26	and also the Serbian soldiers later
621.26	during the times of the executions.
625.26	This is video footage used at the Milosevic trial,
627.26	which from top to bottom
629.26	shows a Serbian scorpion unit
631.26	being blessed by an Orthodox priest
634.26	before rounding up the boys and men
636.26	and killing them.
640.26	Chapter 15 is more of a performance piece.
644.26	I solicited China's State Council Information Office in 2009
648.26	to select a multi-generational bloodline
651.26	to represent China for this project.
654.26	They chose a large family from Beijing for its size,
657.26	and they declined to give me
659.26	any further reasoning for their choice.
661.26	This is one of the rare situations
663.26	where I have no empty portraits.
665.26	Everyone showed up.
667.26	You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy
670.26	as it travels through the bloodline.
674.26	Previously known as the Department of Foreign Propaganda,
677.26	the State Council Information Office
680.26	is responsible for all of China's external publicity operations.
684.26	It controls all foreign media and image production
687.26	outside of China
689.26	from foreign media working within China.
691.26	It also monitors the Internet
693.26	and instructs local media
695.26	on how to handle any potentially controversial issues,
698.26	including Tibet, ethnic minorities,
701.26	Human Rights, religion,
703.26	democracy movements and terrorism.
706.26	For the footnote panel in this work,
709.26	this office instructed me
711.26	to photograph their central television tower in Beijing.
714.26	And I also photographed the gift bag they gave me
716.26	when I left.
722.26	These are the descendants of Hans Frank
724.26	who was Hitler's personal legal advisor
727.26	and governor general of occupied Poland.
730.26	Now this bloodline includes numerous empty portraits,
733.26	highlighting a complex relationship
735.26	to one's family history.
738.26	The reasons for these absences
740.26	include people who declined participation.
743.26	There's also parents who participated
746.26	who wouldn't let their children participate
748.26	because they thought they were too young to decide for themselves.
751.26	Another section of the family
753.26	presented their clothing, as opposed to their physical presence,
756.26	because they didn't want to be identified
758.26	with the past that I was highlighting.
760.26	And finally, another individual
762.26	sat for me from behind
764.26	and later rescinded his participation,
766.26	so I had to pixelate him out so he's unrecognizable.
772.26	In the footnote panel that accompanies this work
774.26	I photographed an official Adolph Hitler postage stamp
778.26	and an imitation of that stamp
780.26	produced by British Intelligence
782.26	with Hans Frank's image on it.
784.26	It was released in Poland
786.26	to create friction between Frank and Hitler,
788.26	so that Hitler would imagine
790.26	Frank was trying to usurp his power.
794.26	Again, talking about fate,
796.26	I was interested in the stories and fate
798.26	of particular works of art.
800.26	These paintings were taken by Hans Frank
803.26	during the time of the Third Reich.
805.26	And I'm interested in the impact of their absence and presence through time.
809.26	"They are Leonardo da Vinci's ""Lady With an Ermine,"""
812.26	"Rembrandt's ""Landscape With Good Samaritan"""
815.26	"and Raphael's ""Portrait of a Youth,"""
817.26	which has never been found.
821.26	Chapter 12 highlights
823.26	people being born into a battle that is not of their making,
826.26	but becomes their own.
828.26	So this is the Ferraz family
830.26	and the Novaes family.
832.26	And they are in an active blood feud.
835.26	This feud has been going on since 1991
838.26	in Northeast Brazil in Pernambuco,
841.26	and it involved the deaths
843.26	of 20 members of the families
845.26	and 40 others associated with the feud,
847.26	including hired hit men, innocent bystanders
850.26	and friends.
853.26	Tensions between these two families date back to 1913
856.26	when there was a dispute over local political power.
859.26	But it got violent in the last two decades
862.26	and includes decapitation
864.26	and the death of two mayors.
866.26	Installed into a protective wall
868.26	surrounding the suburban home of Louis Novaes,
871.26	who's the head of the Novaes family,
873.26	are these turret holes,
875.26	which were used for shooting and looking.
878.26	Brazil's northeast state of Pernambuco
881.26	is one of the nation's most violent regions.
884.26	It's rooted in a principle of retributive justice,
886.26	or an eye for an eye,
888.26	so retaliatory killings
890.26	have led to several deaths in the area.
893.26	This story, like many of the stories in my chapters,
896.26	reads almost as an archetypal episode,
899.26	like something out of Shakespeare,
901.26	that's happening now and will happen again in the future.
904.26	I'm interested in these ideas of repetition.
909.26	So after I returned home, I received word
911.26	that one member of the family
913.26	had been shot 30 times in the face.
918.26	Chapter 17
920.26	is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline
923.26	and the absence of a history.
925.26	Children at this Ukrainian orphanage
927.26	are between the ages of six and 16.
930.26	This piece is ordered by age
932.26	because it can't be ordered by blood.
934.26	In a 12-month period when I was at the orphanage,
937.26	only one child had been adopted.
940.26	Children have to leave the orphanage at age 16,
943.26	despite the fact that there's often nowhere for them to go.
948.26	It's commonly reported in Ukraine
950.26	that children, when leaving the orphanage
952.26	are targeted for human trafficking,
954.26	child pornography and prostitution.
957.26	Many have to turn to criminal activity for their survival,
960.26	and high rates of suicide are recorded.
965.26	This is a boys' bedroom.
967.26	There's an insufficient supply of beds at the orphanage
969.26	and not enough warm clothing.
971.26	Children bathe infrequently
973.26	because the hot water isn't turned on until October.
976.26	This is a girls' bedroom.
978.26	And the director listed the orphanage's most urgent needs
982.26	as an industrial size washing machine and dryer,
985.26	four vacuum cleaners, two computers,
987.26	a video projector, a copy machine,
990.26	winter shoes and a dentist's drill.
993.26	This photograph, which I took at the orphanage of one of the classrooms,
997.26	shows a sign which I had translated when I got home.
1000.26	"And it reads: ""Those who do not know their past"
1003.26	"are not worthy of their future."""
1007.26	There are many more chapters in this project.
1009.26	This is just an abridged rendering
1011.26	of over a thousand images.
1013.26	And this mass pile of images and stories
1016.26	forms an archive.
1018.26	And within this accumulation of images and texts,
1021.26	I'm struggling to find patterns
1023.26	and imagine that the narratives that surround the lives we lead
1027.26	are just as coded as blood itself.
1031.26	But archives exist
1033.26	because there's something that can't necessarily be articulated.
1036.26	Something is said in the gaps
1038.26	between all the information that's collected.
1041.26	And there's this relentless persistence
1044.26	of birth and death
1046.26	and an unending collection of stories in between.
1049.26	It's almost machine-like
1051.26	the way people are born and people die,
1053.26	and the stories keep coming and coming.
1056.26	And in this, I'm considering,
1059.26	is this actual accumulation
1061.26	leading to some sort of evolution,
1064.26	or are we on repeat
1066.26	over and over again?
1069.26	Thank you.
1071.26	(Applause)
