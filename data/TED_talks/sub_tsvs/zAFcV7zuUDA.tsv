15.776	I'm used to thinking of the TED audience
17.767	as a wonderful collection
17.767	of some of the most effective,
20.475	intelligent, intellectual, savvy,
23.26	worldly and innovative
23.26	people in the world.
25.378	And I think that's true.
26.919	However, I also have reason to believe
26.919	that many, if not most, of you
31.703	are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.
34.156	(Laughter)
35.26	Now I know that seems ludicrous.
38.216	I know that seems ludicrous.
39.703	And believe me, I lived the same sad life
39.703	until about three years ago.
43.82	And what happened to me
45.431	was I bought, what was for me,
45.431	a very expensive pair of shoes.
48.859	But those shoes came
48.859	with round nylon laces,
51.799	and I couldn't keep them tied.
53.26	So I went back to the store
53.26	and said to the owner,
55.64	"""I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."""
57.878	He took a look and said,
57.878	"""Oh, you're tying them wrong."""
61.229	Now up until that moment,
62.841	I would have thought that, by age 50,
65.523	one of the life skills
65.523	that I had really nailed
68.654	was tying my shoes.
69.893	(Laughter)
70.918	But not so -- let me demonstrate.
75.132	This is the way
77.149	that most of us
77.149	were taught to tie our shoes.
82.917	Now as it turns out -- thank you.
84.8	(Applause)
85.949	Wait, there's more.
87.733	As it turns out --
89.235	(Laughter)
90.26	there's a strong form
90.26	and a weak form of this knot,
93.372	and we were taught the weak form.
94.981	And here's how to tell.
96.26	If you pull the strands
96.26	at the base of the knot,
98.975	you will see that the bow
98.975	will orient itself
101.26	down the long axis of the shoe.
103.669	That's the weak form of the knot.
105.542	But not to worry.
107.732	If we start over
109.748	and simply go the other direction
109.748	around the bow,
114.206	we get this, the strong form of the knot.
117.214	And if you pull the cords under the knot,
119.379	you will see that the bow orients itself
122.125	along the transverse axis of the shoe.
124.633	This is a stronger knot.
126.228	It will come untied less often.
128.244	It will let you down less,
128.244	and not only that, it looks better.
132.848	We're going to do this one more time.
134.697	(Applause)
138.119	Start as usual --
139.436	(Applause)
141.73	go the other way around the loop.
143.651	This is a little hard for children,
145.402	but I think you can handle it.
149.26	Pull the knot.
151.404	There it is: the strong form
151.404	of the shoe knot.
154.26	Now, in keeping with today's theme,
158.26	I'd like to point out --
158.26	something you already know --
160.815	that sometimes a small advantage
160.815	someplace in life
164.671	can yield tremendous results
164.671	someplace else.
167.488	(Laughter)
168.587	Live long and prosper.
170.017	(Applause)
