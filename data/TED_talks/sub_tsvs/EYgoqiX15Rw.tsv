15.671	Today I'm going to unpack for you
17.931	three examples of iconic design,
20.661	and it makes perfect sense
21.946	that I should be the one to do it
24.635	because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.
28.562	(Laughter)
29.908	But I'm also a famous
31.331	minor television personality
33.392	and an avid collector of
35.462	Design Within Reach catalogs,
37.038	so I pretty much know
39.345	everything there is.
40.865	Now, I'm sure you
42.236	recognize this object;
43.571	many of you probably saw it
45.265	as you were landing your private zeppelins
46.733	at Los Angeles International Airport
49.221	over the past couple of days.
51.414	This is known as the Theme Building;
54.757	that is its name for reasons
56.497	that are still very murky.
59.248	And it is perhaps
60.669	the best example we have in Los Angeles
63.959	of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
68.977	It was first excavated in 1961
71.79	as they were building LAX,
73.68	although scientists believe that
75.329	it dates back to the year 2000
77.916	Before Common Era,
79.981	when it was used as
81.322	a busy transdimensional space port
83.697	by the ancient astronauts
85.745	who first colonized this planet
87.827	and raised our species
89.337	from savagery by giving us
91.053	the gift of written language
92.747	and technology and
94.545	the gift of revolving restaurants.
97.025	It is thought to have been
100.078	a replacement for the older space ports
102.7	located, of course, at Stonehenge
105.553	and considered to be
106.749	quite an improvement
107.876	due to the uncluttered design,
109.953	the lack of druids hanging around all the time
112.573	and obviously, the much better
114.362	access to parking.
116.082	When it was uncovered,
118.372	it ushered in a new era
120.578	of streamlined, archaically futuristic design
123.842	called Googie,
125.271	which came to be synonymous with
127.153	the Jet Age, a misnomer.
129.352	After all, the ancient astronauts who used it
132.086	did not travel by jet very often,
133.924	preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent
137.212	powered by crystal skulls.
139.868	(Applause)
142.15	(Music)
145.736	Ah yes, a table.
149.398	We use these every day.
150.858	And on top of it,
152.604	the juicy salif.
154.759	This is a design by Philippe Starck,
156.213	who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.
158.276	And you can tell it is a Starck design
160.191	by its precision, its playfulness,
163.617	its innovation and
165.858	its promise of imminent violence.
169.11	(Laughter)
171.175	It is a design that challenges your intuition --
174.133	it is not what you think it is when you first see it.
176.482	It is not a fork designed
178.305	to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time,
181.679	which would be useful out in the lobby,
183.455	I would say.
184.624	And despite its obvious
185.893	influence by the ancient astronauts
187.649	and its space agey-ness and tripodism,
191.839	it is not something
193.281	designed to attach to your brain
195.418	and suck out your thoughts.
197.589	It is in fact a citrus juicer
199.914	and when I say that,
201.793	you never see it as anything else again.
204.585	It is also not a monument to design,
208.644	it is a monument to design's utility.
211.237	You can take it home with you,
213.309	unlike the Theme Building,
215.137	which will stay where it is forever.
217.698	This is affordable
219.272	and can come home with you
220.881	and, as such, it can sit
222.941	on your kitchen counter --
225.329	it can't go in your drawers;
226.435	trust me, I found that out the hard way --
229.155	and make your kitchen counter into
231.141	a monument to design.
232.714	One other thing about it,
233.985	if you do have one at home,
235.531	let me tell you one of the features you may not know:
237.75	when you fall asleep,
239.696	it comes alive
243.087	and it walks around your house
245.329	and goes through your mail
246.668	and watches you as you sleep.
248.918	(Applause)
253.1	Okay, what is this object?
259.551	I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.
263.192	It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?
264.994	I don't get it.
266.402	Does anyone know? Chi?
268.479	It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.
270.282	Oh yes, that's right, I remember those;
272.596	I had my whole bathroom tiles
274.577	redone with those back in the good old days.
277.846	No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
279.855	Here is my well-loved iPhone.
281.571	I do so many things on this little device.
284.615	I like to read books on it.
286.625	More than that, I like to buy books on it
289.137	that I never have to feel guilty about not reading
291.068	because they go in here and I never look at them again
292.769	and it's perfect.
295.715	I use it every day to
297.871	measure the weight of an ox,
300.306	for example.
302.067	Every now and then,
303.654	I admit that I complete
305.107	a phone call on it occasionally.
307.359	And yet I forget about it all the time.
311.057	This is a design
312.839	that once you saw it,
314.46	you forgot about it.
315.702	It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement
318.405	that occurred in 2007 when you first
321.487	touched this thing because it became
324.257	so quickly pervasive
325.894	and because of how instantly
328.32	we adopted these gestures
330.69	and made it an extension of our life.
333.685	Unlike the Theme Building,
336.191	this is not alien technology.
338.214	Or I should say,
339.976	what it did was it took technology
341.775	which, unlike people in this room,
343.207	to many other people in the world,
344.301	still feels very alien,
345.532	and made it immediately and instantly feel
347.645	familiar and intimate.
349.884	And unlike the juicy salif,
352.083	it does not threaten
353.715	to attach itself to your brain,
355.907	rather, it simply
357.875	attaches itself to your brain.
359.718	(Laughter)
361.786	And you didn't even notice it happened.
364.56	So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.
366.682	I just explained design.
369.907	Thank you very much.
371.718	(Applause)
