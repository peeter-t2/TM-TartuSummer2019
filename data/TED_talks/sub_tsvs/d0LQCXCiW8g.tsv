12.396	This is an ambucycle.
15.373	This is the fastest way
15.373	to reach any medical emergency.
20.412	It has everything an ambulance
20.412	has except for a bed.
24.914	You see the defibrillator.
24.914	You see the equipment.
28.67	We all saw the tragedy
28.67	that happened in Boston.
31.836	When I was looking at these pictures,
33.916	it brought me back many years to my past
36.906	when I was a child.
38.476	I grew up in a small
38.476	neighborhood in Jerusalem.
41.554	When I was six years old,
41.554	I was walking back from school
45.645	on a Friday afternoon
45.645	with my older brother.
49.38	We were passing by a bus stop.
51.632	We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.
55.675	The bus was on fire, and many people
55.675	were hurt and killed.
60.72	I remembered an old man
62.652	yelling to us and crying
62.652	to help us get him up.
66.12	He just needed someone helping him.
68.583	We were so scared and we just ran away.
72.117	Growing up, I decided I wanted
72.117	to become a doctor and save lives.
75.907	Maybe that was because of what I saw
75.907	when I was a child.
78.908	When I was 15, I took an EMT course,
82.2	and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.
85.26	For two years, I volunteered
85.26	on an ambulance in Jerusalem.
88.677	I helped many people,
90.529	but whenever someone really needed help,
93.444	I never got there in time.
93.444	We never got there.
95.786	The traffic is so bad. The
95.786	distance, and everything.
98.295	We never got there when
98.295	somebody really needed us.
101.12	One day, we received a call
101.12	about a seven-year-old child
103.811	choking from a hot dog.
105.394	Traffic was horrific,
105.394	and we were coming from
107.561	the other side of town
107.561	in the north part of Jerusalem.
111.172	When we got there, 20 minutes later,
113.458	we started CPR on the kid.
115.976	A doctor comes in from a block away,
119.46	stop us, checks the kid,
119.46	and tells us to stop CPR.
124.656	That second he declared this child dead.
128.413	At that moment, I understood
131.41	that this child died for nothing.
134.281	If this doctor, who lived
134.281	one block away from there,
137.836	would have come 20 minutes earlier,
139.527	not have to wait
139.527	until that siren he heard before
142.553	coming from the ambulance,
143.839	if he would have heard
143.839	about it way before,
146.773	he would have saved this child.
148.506	He could have run from a block away.
150.637	He could have saved this child.
152.324	I said to myself, there
152.324	must be a better way.
155.009	Together with 15 of my friends --
156.958	we were all EMTs —
158.729	we decided, let's protect
158.729	our neighborhood,
160.801	so when something like that happens again,
162.825	we will be there running to the scene
162.825	a lot before the ambulance.
166.239	So I went over to the manager
166.239	of the ambulance company
169.212	"and I told him, ""Please,"
169.212	whenever you have a call
171.57	coming into our neighborhood,
173.231	we have 15 great guys who are willing
175.136	to stop everything they're
175.136	doing and run and save lives.
177.827	Just alert us by beeper.
179.255	We'll buy these beepers,
179.255	just tell your dispatch
181.596	to send us the beeper,
181.596	"and we will run and save lives."""
185.507	Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old.
185.507	I was a kid.
192.484	And he said to me — I remember
192.484	this like yesterday —
195.87	he was a great guy, but he said to me,
198.227	"""Kid, go to school, or go"
198.227	open a falafel stand.
202.663	We're not really interested
202.663	in these kinds of new adventures.
206.664	"We're not interested in your help."""
206.664	And he threw me out of the room.
210.279	"""I don't need your help,"" he said."
212.938	I was a very stubborn kid.
216.517	As you see now, I'm walking
216.517	around like crazy, meshugenah.
219.935	(Laughter) (Applause)
224.907	So I decided to use the Israeli
224.907	very famous technique
228.96	you've probably all heard of, chutzpah.
228.96	(Laughter)
232.615	And the next day, I went
232.615	and I bought two police scanners,
237.299	"and I said, ""The hell"
237.299	with you, if you don't want
238.913	to give me information, I'll get
238.913	"the information myself."""
241.864	And we did turns, who's going
241.864	to listen to the radio scanners.
245.129	The next day, while I was listening
245.129	to the scanners,
247.898	I heard about a call coming
247.898	in of a 70-year-old man
251.214	hurt by a car only one block away from me
254.824	on the main street of my neighborhood.
257.515	I ran there by foot. I had
257.515	no medical equipment.
260.218	When I got there, the 70-year-old man
263.168	was lying on the floor, blood
263.168	was gushing out of his neck.
266.082	He was on Coumadin.
267.295	I knew I had to stop his bleeding
267.295	or else he would die.
272.289	I took off my yarmulke,
272.289	because I had no medical equipment,
275.232	and with a lot of pressure,
275.232	I stopped his bleeding.
277.685	He was bleeding from his neck.
279.2	When the ambulance arrived
282.657	I gave them over a patient who was alive.
285.244	(Applause)
293.224	When I went to visit him two days later,
295.386	he gave me a hug and was crying
297.721	and thanking me for saving his life.
300.743	At that moment, when I realized
300.743	this is the first person
303.764	I ever saved in my life after two years
303.764	volunteering in an ambulance,
307.074	I knew this is my life's mission.
309.766	So today, 22 years later,
309.766	we have United Hatzalah.
313.931	(Applause)
320.321	"""Hatzalah"" means ""rescue,"""
320.321	for all of you who don't know Hebrew.
323.393	I forgot I'm not in Israel.
325.345	So we have thousands of volunteers
328.28	who are passionate about saving lives,
331.199	and they're spread all around,
331.199	so whenever a call comes in,
334.033	they just stop everything
334.033	and go and run and save a life.
338.429	Our average response time today
340.986	went down to less
340.986	than three minutes in Israel.
344.7	(Applause)
348.346	I'm talking about heart attacks,
349.894	I'm talking about car accidents,
351.526	God forbid bomb attacks,
351.526	shootings, whatever it is,
354.4	even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning
356.339	falling in her home and needs
356.339	someone to help her.
358.744	Three minutes, we'll have
358.744	a guy with his pajamas
361.108	running to her house
361.108	and helping her get up.
364.757	The reasons why we're so successful
364.757	are because of three things.
367.829	Thousands of passionate volunteers
369.651	who will leave everything they do
371.371	and run to help people
371.371	they don't even know.
374.282	We're not there to replace ambulances.
376.625	We're just there
378.229	to get the gap between the ambulance
378.229	call until they arrive.
384.279	And we save people that otherwise
384.279	would not be saved.
389.166	The second reason
389.166	is because of our technology.
392.525	You know, Israelis are good in technology.
394.549	Every one of us has on his phone,
394.549	no matter what kind of phone,
397.782	a GPS technology done by NowForce,
400.858	and whenever a call comes in,
402.305	the closest five volunteers get the call,
404.48	and they actually get there really quick,
407.378	and navigated by a traffic navigator
407.378	to get there and not waste time.
411.102	And this is a great technology
411.102	we use all over the country
413.301	and reduce the response time.
414.891	And the third thing are these ambucycles.
417.027	These ambucycles
417.027	are an ambulance on two wheels.
420.336	We don't transfer people,
420.336	but we stabilize them,
422.646	and we save their lives.
423.887	They never get stuck in traffic.
423.887	They could even go on a sidewalk.
427.054	They never, literally,
427.054	get stuck in traffic.
429.419	That's why we get there so fast.
431.224	A few years after I started
431.224	this organization,
433.706	in a Jewish community,
435.451	two Muslims from east
435.451	Jerusalem called me up.
438.254	They ask me to meet. They
438.254	wanted to meet with me.
440.952	Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.
443.443	When Muhammad told me his personal story,
445.42	how his father, 55 years
445.42	old, collapsed at home,
448.275	had a cardiac arrest,
449.531	and it took over an hour
449.531	for an ambulance arrive,
451.951	and he saw his father die
451.951	in front of his eyes,
454.214	"he asked me, ""Please start"
454.214	"this in east Jerusalem."""
457.009	I said to myself, I saw so
457.009	much tragedy, so much hate,
460.834	and it's not about saving Jews.
460.834	It's not about saving Muslims.
464.118	It's not about saving Christians.
464.118	It's about saving people.
467.69	So I went ahead, full force --
470.103	(Applause) —
474.694	and I started United
474.694	Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,
478.361	and that's why the names United
480.18	and Hatzalah match so well.
482.26	We started hand in hand
482.26	saving Jews and Arabs.
486.112	Arabs were saving Jews.
486.112	Jews were saving Arabs.
488.375	Something special happened.
490.376	Arabs and Jews, they don't
490.376	always get along together,
493.041	but here in this situation,
494.351	the communities, literally,
496.144	it's an unbelievable
496.144	situation that happened,
498.311	the diversities, all of a sudden
498.311	they had a common interest:
500.905	Let's save lives together.
502.347	Settlers were saving Arabs
502.347	and Arabs were saving settlers.
505.133	It's an unbelievable
505.133	concept that could work
507.253	only when you have such a great cause.
510.008	And these are all volunteers.
511.881	No one is getting money.
513	They're all doing it
513	for the purpose of saving lives.
516.876	When my own father
516.876	collapsed a few years ago
519.161	from a cardiac arrest,
519.161	one of the first volunteers
521.566	to arrive to save my father
523.331	was one of these Muslim
523.331	volunteers from east Jerusalem
525.927	who was in the first
525.927	course to join Hatzalah.
529.472	And he saved my father.
530.549	Could you imagine
530.549	how I felt in that moment?
535.056	When I started this organization,
535.056	I was 17 years old.
538.165	I never imagined that one day
538.165	I'd be speaking at TEDMED.
541.575	I never even knew what TEDMED was then.
543.457	I don't think it existed,
543.457	but I never imagined,
546.601	I never imagined that it's going
546.601	to go all around,
549.006	it's going to spread around,
550.088	and this last year we started
550.088	in Panama and Brazil.
553.156	All I need is a partner
553.156	who is a little meshugenah like me,
556.538	passionate about saving
556.538	lives, and willing to do it.
559.928	And I'm actually starting
559.928	it in India very soon
563.437	with a friend who I met
563.437	in Harvard just a while back.
567.09	Hatzalah actually started
567.09	in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew
570.958	years before us in Williamsburg,
573.236	and now it's all over the Jewish
573.236	community in New York,
575.959	even Australia and Mexico
575.959	and many other Jewish communities.
579.219	But it could spread everywhere.
580.813	It's very easy to adopt.
583.369	You even saw these volunteers in New York
585.645	saving lives in the World Trade Center.
588.761	Last year alone, we treated
588.761	in Israel 207,000 people.
592.306	Forty-two thousand of them were
592.306	life-threatening situations.
597.029	And we made a difference.
599.206	I guess you could call this
599.206	a lifesaving flash mob,
601.954	and it works.
604.377	When I look all around here,
606.824	I see lots of people
606.824	who would go an extra mile,
610.215	run an extra mile to save other people,
612.936	no matter who they are,
612.936	no matter what religion,
615.673	no matter who, where they come from.
618.589	We all want to be heroes.
620.374	We just need a good idea, motivation
623.76	and lots of chutzpah,
625.595	and we could save millions of people
627.76	that otherwise would not be saved.
629.932	Thank you very much.
631.617	(Applause)
