25	At the break, I was asked by several people
27	about my comments about the aging debate.
30	And this will be my only comment on it.
32	And that is, I understand
34	that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
36	(Laughter)
41	What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is
44	how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code
48	to the first stages of beginning
50	to write the code ourselves.
53	It's only 10 years ago this month
55	when we published the first sequence
57	of a free-living organism,
59	that of haemophilus influenzae.
61	That took a genome project
63	from 13 years down to four months.
67	We can now do that same genome project
69	in the order of
71	two to eight hours.
73	So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:
76	most human pathogens,
79	a couple of plants,
81	several insects and several mammals,
84	including the human genome.
87	Genomics at this stage of the thinking
90	from a little over 10 years ago
92	was, by the end of this year, we might have
94	between three and five genomes sequenced;
97	it's on the order of several hundred.
100	We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
103	to sequence 130 genomes this year,
106	as a side project from environmental organisms.
110	So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
114	But as we look, what's out there,
116	we've barely scratched the surface
118	on what is available on this planet.
122	Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible,
125	but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
129	whereas all animals only make up about
132	one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
134	And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
137	but if you ever make it to the sea,
139	and you swallow a mouthful of seawater,
142	keep in mind that each milliliter
144	has about a million bacteria
146	and on the order of 10 million viruses.
149	Less than 5,000 microbial species
152	have been characterized as of two years ago,
154	and so we decided to do something about it.
156	And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,
159	where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,
162	trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
167	We started in Bermuda for our test project,
169	then moved up to Halifax,
171	working down the U.S. East Coast,
173	the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,
178	through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,
180	and we're in the process now of working our way
182	across the Indian Ocean.
184	It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
187	in part to help excite young people
189	about going into science.
192	The experiments are incredibly simple.
194	We just take seawater and we filter it,
197	and we collect different size organisms on different filters,
201	and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
204	where we can sequence a hundred million letters
207	of the genetic code every 24 hours.
209	And with doing this,
211	we've made some amazing discoveries.
213	For example, it was thought that the visual pigments
215	that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms
218	in the environment that had these same pigments.
222	It turns out, almost every species
224	in the upper parts of the ocean
226	in warm parts of the world
228	have these same photoreceptors,
230	and use sunlight as the source of their energy
233	and communication.
235	From one site, from one barrel of seawater,
238	we discovered 1.3 million new genes
241	and as many as 50,000 new species.
245	We've extended this to the air
247	now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
250	We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria
252	all of us are breathing in and out every day,
255	particularly on airplanes
257	or closed auditoriums.
259	(Laughter)
262	We filter through some simple apparatuses;
264	we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
267	filtering on top of a building in New York City.
271	And we're in the process of sequencing all that
273	at the present time.
275	Just on the data collection side,
277	just where we are through the Galapagos,
280	we're finding that almost every 200 miles,
282	we see tremendous diversity
284	in the samples in the ocean.
287	Some of these make logical sense,
289	in terms of different temperature gradients.
292	So this is a satellite photograph
294	based on temperatures -- red being warm,
296	blue being cold --
299	and we found there's a tremendous difference between
302	the warm water samples and the cold water samples,
304	in terms of abundant species.
307	The other thing that surprised us quite a bit
309	is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,
313	and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
317	And these vary tremendously from region to region.
320	Maybe not surprisingly,
322	in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,
324	the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
328	When there's a lot of chlorophyll around,
330	they see a lot of green light.
332	But they vary even more,
334	possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet
337	in the extremes.
340	Just to try and get an assessment
342	of what our gene repertoire was,
344	we assembled all the data --
346	including all of ours thus far from the expedition,
349	which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --
352	and it totaled around 29 million genes.
356	And we tried to put these into gene families
358	to see what these discoveries are:
360	Are we just discovering new members of known families,
363	or are we discovering new families?
365	And it turns out we have about 50,000
367	major gene families,
370	but every new sample we take in the environment
373	adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
376	So we're at the earliest stages of discovery
378	about basic genes,
381	components and life on this planet.
385	When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,
388	we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
392	Of those roughly 29 million genes,
396	we only have around 24,000
398	in our genome.
400	And if you take all animals together,
402	we probably share less than 30,000
405	and probably maybe a dozen
408	or more thousand different gene families.
412	I view that these genes are now
414	not only the design components of evolution.
417	And we think in a gene-centric view --
419	maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --
422	than in a genome-centric view,
424	which are different constructs of these gene components.
429	Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,
432	has changed at sort of the same pace
434	that DNA sequencing has
436	over the last decade or two,
438	and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
441	Our first thought about synthetic genomics came
443	when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
447	and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
449	And we have really nice T-shirts that say,
452	"you know, ""I heart my genitalium."""
454	This is actually just a microorganism.
458	But it has roughly 500 genes.
462	Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
464	And we simply asked the question,
466	if one species needs 800, another 500,
468	is there a smaller set of genes
470	that might comprise a minimal operating system?
474	So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.
477	Transposons are just small pieces of DNA
480	that randomly insert in the genetic code.
482	And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.
486	So we made a map of all the genes
488	that could take transposon insertions
490	"and we called those ""non-essential genes."""
493	But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
496	and you can only
498	define an essential or non-essential gene
501	based on exactly what's in the environment.
505	We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
507	with the genomes of 13 related organisms,
512	and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
516	And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
520	common to all 13 organisms.
523	The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
525	one intracellular parasite;
527	it expanded even more
529	when we looked at core sets of genes
531	of around 310 or so.
533	So we think that we can expand
535	or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
538	to maybe 300 to 400 genes
541	from the minimal of 500.
543	The only way to prove these ideas
546	was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
549	and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
552	We found that synthesizing accurate DNA
554	in large pieces was extremely difficult.
557	Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
560	developed an exciting new method
562	that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
565	in only a two-week period
567	that was 100 percent accurate,
570	in terms of its sequence and its biology.
573	It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
577	injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
579	that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
584	that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
587	This was not the first synthetic virus --
589	a polio virus had been made a year before --
593	but it was only one ten-thousandth as active
595	and it took three years to do.
598	This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
602	This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
606	and that's the notions that we have with biology.
610	People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,
614	and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
618	and a special committee the U.S. government has set up
620	to review this area.
622	And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
625	versus what happens with people's imaginations.
629	Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today --
632	that genome can be made.
634	And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
638	but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
642	So even if somebody made the smallpox genome,
645	that DNA itself would not cause infections.
649	The real concern that security departments have
652	is designer viruses.
654	And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
658	that had major efforts
660	on trying to create biological warfare agents.
663	If that research is truly discontinued,
666	there should be very little activity
668	on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
672	I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.
676	And possibly eukaryotic cells,
679	those that we have,
681	are possible within a decade.
684	So we're now making several dozen different constructs,
688	because we can vary the cassettes and the genes
691	that go into this artificial chromosome.
693	The key is, how do you put all of the others?
695	We start with these fragments,
697	and then we have a homologous recombination system
700	that reassembles those into a chromosome.
704	This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,
707	that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
713	It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst
717	in about 12 to 24 hours,
719	after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.
722	This organism is ubiquitous on the planet,
724	and exists perhaps now
726	in outer space due to all our travel there.
730	This is a glass beaker after
732	about half a million rads of radiation.
734	The glass started to burn and crack,
736	while the microbes sitting in the bottom
738	just got happier and happier.
740	Here's an actual picture of what happens:
742	the top of this shows the genome
744	after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
747	The chromosome is literally blown apart.
749	And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled
755	It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
758	and we probably have thousands,
760	if not tens of thousands, of different species
762	on this planet that are capable of doing that.
765	After these genomes are synthesized,
767	the first step is just transplanting them
769	into a cell without a genome.
773	So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,
777	not only for understanding the basis of biology
780	but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
783	For example, from the third organism we sequenced,
786	Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;
790	its energy source is hydrogen
792	and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
797	So we know lots of different pathways,
799	thousands of different organisms now
802	that live off of CO2,
804	and can capture that back.
806	So instead of using carbon from oil
809	for synthetic processes,
811	we have the chance of using carbon
814	and capturing it back from the atmosphere,
817	converting that into biopolymers
819	or other products.
821	We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
824	and we use as a reducing power
826	to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
830	Also, there's numerous pathways
832	that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
836	And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
840	to capture and convert the methane
842	from the gas fields there into useful products.
846	Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field
848	"called ""Combinatorial Genomics,"""
850	because with these new synthesis capabilities,
853	these vast gene array repertoires
856	and the homologous recombination,
858	we think we can design a robot to make
860	maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
864	And therefore, as with all biology,
866	you get selection through screening,
869	whether you're screening for hydrogen production,
871	or chemical production, or just viability.
874	To understand the role of these genes
876	is going to be well within reach.
878	We're trying to modify photosynthesis
881	to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
884	Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,
887	and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase
890	that we think will totally change this process.
895	We're also combining cellulases,
897	the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
900	and fermentation in the same cell
903	for producing ethanol.
906	Pharmaceutical production is already under way
908	in major laboratories
910	using microbes.
912	The chemistry from compounds in the environment
915	is orders of magnitude more complex
917	than our best chemists can produce.
920	I think future engineered species
922	could be the source of food,
924	hopefully a source of energy,
926	environmental remediation
929	and perhaps
931	replacing the petrochemical industry.
933	Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.
937	We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
941	until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review
944	as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
948	Every major religion participated in this.
951	It was actually a very strange study,
953	because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
958	and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
961	so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
964	were biological warfare aspects of this,
968	but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
971	for the reasons we were doing them.
973	Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded
975	a multi-institutional study on this,
978	to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
981	and the rules that scientific teams such as my own
984	should be using in this area,
986	and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
990	These are complex issues.
992	Except for the threat of bio-terrorism,
994	they're very simple issues in terms of,
996	can we design things to produce clean energy,
1000	perhaps revolutionizing
1002	what developing countries can do
1005	and provide through various simple processes.
1008	Thank you very much.
