12.809	So, there's an actor
12.809	called Dustin Hoffman.
16.285	And years ago, he made this movie
16.285	which some of you may have heard of,
19.643	"called ""The Graduate."""
21.261	And there's two key scenes in that movie.
24.559	The first one is the seduction scene.
26.677	I'm not going to talk about that tonight.
28.694	(Laughter)
30.185	The second scene is where he's taken out
30.185	by the old guy to the pool,
34.799	and as a young college graduate,
34.799	the old guy basically says one word,
39.842	just one word.
41.835	And of course, all of you know
41.835	what that word is.
44.151	"It's ""plastics."""
45.365	(Laughter)
47.19	And the only problem with that is,
47.19	it was completely the wrong advice.
51.146	(Laughter)
53.229	Let me tell you why it was so wrong.
55.401	"The word should have been ""silicon."""
58.163	And the reason it should have been silicon
60.211	is because the basic patents
60.211	for semiconductors had already been made,
65.416	had already been filed,
66.817	and they were already building them.
68.606	So Silicon Valley was just
68.606	being built in 1967,
71.717	when this movie was released.
73.549	And the year after the movie was released,
75.661	Intel was founded.
77.327	So had the graduate heard
77.327	the right one word,
80.177	maybe he would have ended up
80.177	onstage -- oh, I don't know --
83.733	maybe with these two.
84.915	(Laughter)
91.955	So as you're thinking of that,
94.626	let's see what bit of advice
94.626	we might want to give
98.088	so that your next graduate doesn't become
98.088	a Tupperware salesman.
101.702	(Laughter)
103.606	So in 2015, what word of advice
103.606	would you give people,
107.375	when you took a college
107.375	graduate out by the pool
110.04	and you said one word, just one word?
112.698	"I think the answer would be ""lifecode."""
115.312	"So what is ""lifecode?"""
116.495	Lifecode is the various ways
116.495	we have of programming life.
119.256	So instead of programming computers,
121.115	we're using things to program viruses
123.812	or retroviruses or proteins
125.86	or DNA or RNA
128.501	or plants or animals,
128.501	or a whole series of creatures.
131.632	And as you're thinking
131.632	about this incredible ability
134.186	to make life do what you want it to do,
136.463	what it's programmed to do,
138.604	what you end up doing
140.421	is taking what we've been doing
140.421	for thousands of years,
143.89	which is breeding, changing,
147.035	mixing, matching
149.13	all kinds of life-forms,
151.163	and we accelerate it.
152.648	And this is not something new.
154.172	This humble mustard weed has been modified
157.139	so that if you change it in one way,
157.139	you get broccoli.
160.714	And if you change it
160.714	in a second way, you get kale.
163.764	And if you change it in a third way,
165.804	you get cauliflower.
167.662	So when you go to these
167.662	all-natural, organic markets,
171.038	you're really going to a place
172.642	where people have been changing
172.642	the lifecode of plants for a long time.
177.464	The difference today,
178.652	to pick a completely
178.652	politically neutral term --
180.921	[Intelligent design]
182.636	(Laughter)
183.817	We're beginning to practice
183.817	intelligent design.
186.819	That means that instead
186.819	of doing this at random
189.081	and seeing what happens over generations,
191.161	we're inserting specific genes,
191.161	we're inserting specific proteins,
194.871	and we're changing lifecode
194.871	for very deliberate purposes.
198.745	And that allows us to accelerate
198.745	how this stuff happens.
202.473	Let me just give you one example.
206.928	Some of you occasionally
206.928	might think about sex.
211.299	And we kind of take it for granted
211.299	how we've changed sex.
214.552	So we think it's perfectly normal
214.552	and natural to change it.
217.96	What's happened with sex over time is --
220.323	normally, sex equals baby, eventually.
223.971	But in today's world,
225.505	sex plus pill equals no baby.
228.408	(Laughter)
229.916	And again, we think
229.916	that's perfectly normal and natural,
232.678	but that has not been the case
232.678	for most of human history.
235.552	And it's not the case for animals.
237.608	What it is does is it gives us control,
239.614	so sex becomes separate from conception.
242.955	And as you're thinking
242.955	of the consequences of that,
245.424	then we've been playing with stuff
247.112	that's a little bit more
247.112	advanced, like art.
249.447	Not in the sense
249.447	of painting and sculpture,
251.549	but in the sense of assisted
251.549	reproductive technologies.
257.405	So what are assisted
257.405	reproductive technologies?
259.865	Assisted reproductive technologies
259.865	are things like in vitro fertilization.
264.289	And when you do in vitro fertilization,
264.289	there's very good reasons to do it.
267.862	Sometimes you just
267.862	can't conceive otherwise.
271.622	But when you do that,
272.801	what you’re doing is separating
272.801	sex, conception, baby.
277.786	So you haven't just taken control
277.786	of when you have a baby,
280.714	you've separated when the baby
280.714	and where the baby is fertilized.
284.73	So you've separated the baby
286.946	from the body from the act.
289.332	And as you're thinking
289.332	of other things we've been doing,
292.436	think about twins.
295.029	So you can freeze sperm,
295.029	you can freeze eggs,
297.173	you can freeze fertilized eggs.
299.778	And what does that mean?
301.567	Well, that's a good thing
301.567	if you're a cancer patient.
304.085	You're about to go under chemotherapy
304.085	or under radiation,
307.113	so you save these things.
308.367	You don't irradiate them.
310.072	But if you can save them
310.072	and you can freeze them,
312.422	and you can have a surrogate mother,
314.548	it means that you've
314.548	decoupled sex from time.
317.71	It means you can have twins
317.71	born -- oh, in 50 years?
323.287	(Laughter)
327	In a hundred years?
329.342	Two hundred years?
331.566	And these are three
331.566	really profound changes
334.377	that are not, like, future stuff.
336	This is stuff we take for granted today.
338.911	So this lifecode stuff
338.911	turns out to be a superpower.
342.52	It turns out to be this incredibly
342.52	powerful way of changing viruses,
346.88	of changing plants, of changing animals,
349.84	perhaps even of evolving ourselves.
352.118	It's something that Steve Gullans and I
352.118	have been thinking about for a while.
356.749	Let's have some risks.
358.408	Like every powerful technology,
358.408	like electricity, like an automobile,
362.576	like computers, this stuff
362.576	potentially can be misused.
366.631	And that scares a lot of people.
369.02	And as you apply these technologies,
370.809	you can even turn human
370.809	beings into chimeras.
373.815	Remember the Greek myth
373.815	where you mix animals?
376.378	Well, some of these treatments
378.388	actually end up changing your blood type.
381.406	Or they'll put male cells
381.406	in a female body or vice versa,
386.326	which sounds absolutely horrible
387.938	until you realize, the reason
387.938	you're doing that
390.239	is you're substituting bone marrow
390.239	during cancer treatments.
393.668	So by taking somebody else's bone marrow,
395.94	you may be changing
395.94	some fundamental aspects of yourself,
398.656	but you're also saving your life.
400.568	And as you're thinking about this stuff,
402.738	here's something
402.738	that happened 20 years ago.
405.337	This is Emma Ott.
406.886	She's a recent college admittee.
409.719	She's studying accounting.
411.648	She played two varsity sports.
411.648	She graduated as a valedictorian.
415.687	And that's not particularly extraordinary,
417.731	except that she's the first human being
417.731	born to three parents.
422.244	Why?
423.419	Because she had a deadly
423.419	mitochondrial disease
425.609	that she might have inherited.
427.118	So when you swap out a third person's DNA
429.523	and you put it in there,
431.275	you save the lives of people.
433.84	But you also are doing
433.84	germline engineering,
436.245	which means her kids,
436.245	if she has kids, will be saved
440.412	and won't go through this.
441.846	And [their] kids will be saved,
443.361	and their grandchildren will be saved,
445.22	and this passes on.
446.929	That makes people nervous.
448.578	So 20 years ago,
448.578	the various authorities said,
450.952	why don't we study this for a while?
453.903	There are risks to doing stuff,
453.903	and there are risks to not doing stuff,
457.741	because there were a couple dozen people
457.741	saved by this technology,
461.113	and then we've been thinking about it
461.113	for the next 20 years.
465.002	So as we think about it,
466.209	"as we take the time to say, ""Hey,"
466.209	maybe we should have longer studies,
470.043	maybe we should do this,
470.043	"maybe we should do that,"""
472.468	there are consequences to acting,
472.468	and there are consequences to not acting.
477.203	Like curing deadly diseases --
479.688	which, by the way,
479.688	is completely unnatural.
482.997	It is normal and natural
482.997	for humans to be felled
486.103	by massive epidemics of polio,
486.103	of smallpox, of tuberculosis.
490.196	When we put vaccines into people,
490.196	we are putting unnatural things
493.863	into their body
495.253	because we think the benefit
495.253	outweighs the risk.
500.129	Because we've built unnatural plants,
500.129	unnatural animals,
503.866	we can feed about seven billion people.
506.413	We can do things
506.413	like create new life-forms.
510.302	And as you create new life-forms,
510.302	again, that sounds terribly scary
513.843	and terribly bothersome,
515.548	until you realize that those life-forms
515.548	live on your dining room table.
519.539	Those flowers you've got
519.539	on your dining room table --
522.06	there's not a lot
522.06	that's natural about them,
524.253	because people have been breeding
524.253	the flowers to make this color,
527.369	to be this size, to last for a week.
529.153	You don't usually give
529.153	your loved one wildflowers
531.566	because they don't last
531.566	a whole lot of time.
536.532	What all this does
538.421	is it flips Darwin completely on his head.
541.159	See, for four billion years,
542.924	what lived and died on this planet
542.924	depended on two principles:
546.608	on natural selection and random mutation.
550.016	And so what lived and died,
550.016	what was structured,
553.167	has now been flipped on its head.
556.262	And what we've done
557.485	is created this completely
557.485	parallel evolutionary system
560.12	where we are practicing unnatural
560.12	selection and non-random mutation.
563.473	So let me explain these things.
565.192	This is natural selection.
567.09	This is unnatural selection.
568.519	(Laughter)
571.903	So what happens with this stuff is,
574.571	we started breeding wolves
574.571	thousands of years ago
577.309	in central Asia to turn them into dogs.
579.523	And then we started
579.523	turning them into big dogs
581.841	and into little dogs.
583.616	But if you take one of the chihuahuas
585.427	you see in the Hermès bags on Fifth Avenue
588.299	and you let it loose on the African plain,
590.98	you can watch natural selection happen.
592.988	(Laughter)
598.419	Few things on Earth
598.419	are less natural than a cornfield.
602.188	You will never, under any scenario,
602.188	walk through a virgin forest
605.785	and see the same plant
605.785	growing in orderly rows
608.494	at the same time,
609.842	nothing else living there.
612.398	When you do a cornfield,
613.581	you're selecting what lives and what dies.
616.08	And you're doing that
616.08	through unnatural selection.
618.443	It's the same with a wheat field,
618.443	it's the same with a rice field.
621.604	It's the same with a city,
621.604	it's the same with a suburb.
624.243	In fact, half the surface of Earth
626.162	has been unnaturally engineered
627.693	so that what lives and what dies
627.693	there is what we want,
630.9	which is the reason why
630.9	you don't have grizzly bears
633.387	walking through downtown Manhattan.
637.077	How about this random mutation stuff?
638.96	Well, this is random mutation.
640.427	This is Antonio Alfonseca.
642.35	He's otherwise known
642.35	as the Octopus, his nickname.
645.085	He was the Relief Pitcher
645.085	of the Year in 2000.
647.955	And he had a random mutation
647.955	that gave him six fingers
650.743	on each hand,
652.995	which turns out to be really useful
652.995	if you're a pitcher.
655.661	(Laughter)
658.119	How about non-random mutation?
660.415	A non-random mutation is beer.
663.412	It's wine. It's yogurt.
665.928	How many times have you walked
665.928	through the forest
668.288	and found all-natural cheese?
670.859	Or all-natural yogurt?
673.046	So we've been engineering this stuff.
674.855	Now, the interesting thing is,
676.347	we get to know the stuff better.
678.364	We found one of the single most powerful
678.364	gene-editing instruments,
682.101	CRISPR, inside yogurt.
685.028	And as we start engineering cells,
687.042	we're producing eight out of the top 10
687.042	pharmaceutical products,
692.246	including the stuff that you use
692.246	to treat arthritis,
694.795	which is the number one
694.795	best-selling drug, Humira.
697.985	So this lifecode stuff.
700.229	It really is a superpower.
702.156	It really is a way of programming stuff,
704.094	and there's nothing
704.094	that's going to change us
706.675	more than this lifecode.
709.597	So as you're thinking of lifecode,
711.602	let's think of five principles
714.231	as to how we start guiding,
716.11	and I'd love you to give me more.
718.315	So, principle number one:
720.282	we have to take responsibility
720.282	for this stuff.
723.042	The reason we have to take responsibility
725.617	is because we're in charge.
727.002	These aren't random mutations.
728.939	This is what we are doing,
728.939	what we are choosing.
731.266	"It's not, ""Stuff happened."""
732.989	It didn't happen at random.
734.486	It didn't come down
734.486	by a verdict of somebody else.
737.114	We engineer this stuff,
738.955	and it's the Pottery Barn rule:
738.955	you break it, you own it.
742.962	Principle number two:
744.515	we have to recognize and celebrate
744.515	diversity in this stuff.
747.667	There have been at least
750.825	that have walked around this Earth.
752.912	Most all of them went extinct except us.
755.804	But the normal and natural
755.804	state of this Earth
757.989	is we have various versions of humans
757.989	walking around at the same time,
761.4	which is why most of us
761.4	have some Neanderthal in us.
764.559	Some of us have some Denisova in us.
767.023	And some in Washington
767.023	have a lot more of it.
769.396	(Laughter)
771.998	Principle number three:
773.907	we have to respect other people's choices.
776.608	Some people will choose to never alter.
778.907	Some people will choose to alter all.
780.741	Some people will choose
780.741	to alter plants but not animals.
783.391	Some people will choose
783.391	to alter themselves.
785.466	Some people will choose
785.466	to evolve themselves.
787.753	Diversity is not a bad thing,
789.346	because even though we think
789.346	of humans as very diverse,
792.012	we came so close to extinction
794.321	that all of us descend
794.321	from a single African mother
796.96	and the consequence of that
798.309	is there's more genetic diversity
798.309	in 55 African chimpanzees
802.838	than there are in seven billion humans.
806.254	Principle number four:
809.079	we should take about
809.079	a quarter of the Earth
811.78	and only let Darwin run the show there.
814.981	It doesn't have to be contiguous,
816.606	doesn't have to all be tied together.
818.404	It should be part
818.404	in the oceans, part on land.
820.634	But we should not run every
820.634	evolutionary decision on this planet.
824.474	We want to have
824.474	our evolutionary system running.
826.936	We want to have Darwin's
826.936	evolutionary system running.
829.537	And it's just really important to have
829.537	these two things running in parallel
833.237	and not overwhelm evolution.
834.778	(Applause)
842.307	Last thing I'll say.
844.654	This is the single most exciting
844.654	adventure human beings have been on.
847.94	This is the single greatest superpower
847.94	humans have ever had.
851.005	It would be a crime for you
851.005	not to participate in this stuff
853.897	because you're scared of it,
855.333	because you're hiding from it.
857.096	You can participate in the ethics.
857.096	You can participate in the politics.
860.491	You can participate in the business.
862.264	You can participate in just thinking
862.264	about where medicine is going,
865.446	where industry is going,
866.631	where we're going to take the world.
868.458	It would be a crime for all of us
870.347	not to be aware when somebody
870.347	shows up at a swimming pool
874.429	and says one word, just one word,
877.499	if you don't listen
877.499	"if that word is ""lifecode."""
879.922	Thank you very much.
881.224	(Applause)
