15.26	It is actually a reality today
18.26	that you can download products from the Web --
22.26	product data, I should say, from the Web --
25.26	perhaps tweak it and personalize it
28.26	to your own preference or your own taste,
30.26	and have that information sent
33.26	to a desktop machine
36.26	that will fabricate it for you on the spot.
38.26	We can actually build for you,
40.26	very rapidly,
42.26	a physical object.
45.26	And the reason we can do this
47.26	is through an emerging technology
49.26	called additive manufacturing,
51.26	or 3D printing.
54.26	This is a 3D printer.
56.26	They have been around
58.26	for almost 30 years now,
60.26	which is quite amazing to think of,
62.26	but they're only just starting
64.26	to filter into the public arena.
66.26	And typically, you would take data,
69.26	like the data of a pen here,
72.26	which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,
75.26	and we would pass that data with material
77.26	into a machine.
79.26	And a process that would happen in the machine
81.26	would mean layer by layer that product would be built.
83.26	And we can take out the physical product,
86.26	and ready to use,
88.26	or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.
91.26	But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,
94.26	why don't we know about them?
96.26	Because typically they've been too inefficient,
99.26	inaccessible,
102.26	they've not been fast enough,
104.26	they've been quite expensive.
106.26	But today,
108.26	it is becoming a reality
110.26	that they are now becoming successful.
112.26	Many barriers are breaking down.
114.26	That means that you guys
116.26	will soon be able to access one of these machines,
118.26	if not this minute.
121.26	And it will change and disrupt
123.26	the landscape of manufacturing,
125.26	and most certainly our lives, our businesses
128.26	and the lives of our children.
130.26	So how does it work?
133.26	It typically reads CAD data,
135.26	which is a product design data
137.26	created on professional product design programs.
139.26	And here you can see an engineer --
141.26	it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --
144.26	create a product in 3D.
147.26	And this data gets sent to a machine
149.26	that slices the data
152.26	into two-dimensional representations of that product
154.26	all the way through --
156.26	almost like slicing it like salami.
159.26	And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,
162.26	starting at the base of the product
164.26	and depositing material, layer upon layer,
167.26	infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer
171.26	in an additive process.
173.26	And this material that's deposited
176.26	either starts as a liquid form
178.26	or a material powder form.
181.26	And the bonding process can happen
183.26	by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
186.26	In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
189.26	It's actually using a laser
191.26	to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
194.26	And over time --
196.26	quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --
198.26	we can build a physical product,
200.26	ready to take out of the machine and use.
202.26	And this is quite an extraordinary idea,
206.26	but it is reality today.
209.26	So all these products that you can see on the screen
212.26	were made in the same way.
214.26	They were all 3D printed.
216.26	And you can see,
218.26	they're ranging from shoes,
220.26	rings that were made out of stainless steal,
223.26	phone covers out of plastic,
225.26	all the way through to spinal implants, for example,
228.26	that were created out of medical-grade titanium,
230.26	and engine parts.
232.26	But what you'll notice about all of these products
234.26	is they're very, very intricate.
236.26	The design is quite extraordinary.
239.26	Because we're taking this data in 3D form,
242.26	slicing it up before it gets past the machine,
245.26	we can actually create structures
247.26	that are more intricate
249.26	than any other manufacturing technology --
252.26	or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.
256.26	And you can create parts with moving components,
259.26	hinges, parts within parts.
261.26	So in some cases, we can abolish totally
264.26	the need for manual labor.
266.26	It sounds great.
268.26	It is great.
270.26	We can have 3D printers today
272.26	that build structures like these.
274.26	This is almost three meters high.
277.26	And this was built
279.26	by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer
282.26	in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --
286.26	slowly growing this structure.
288.26	This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.
291.26	And you can actually walk into it.
293.26	And on the other end of the spectrum,
295.26	this is a microstructure.
297.26	It's created depositing layers
299.26	of about four microns.
302.26	So really the resolution is quite incredible.
305.26	The detail that you can get today
307.26	is quite amazing.
310.26	So who's using it?
312.26	Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,
315.26	it's been used by product designers,
318.26	or anyone who wanted to prototype a product
321.26	and very quickly create or reiterate a design.
324.26	And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well
328.26	is that you can create bespoke products en masse.
331.26	There's very little economies of scale.
334.26	So you can now create one-offs very easily.
337.26	Architects, for example,
339.26	they want to create prototypes of buildings.
341.26	Again you can see,
343.26	this is a building of the Free University in Berlin
346.26	and it was designed by Foster and Partners.
348.26	Again, not buildable in any other way.
351.26	And very hard to even create this by hand.
356.26	Now this is an engine component.
359.26	It was developed by a company called Within Technologies
362.26	and 3T RPD.
365.26	It's very, very, very detailed
367.26	inside with the design.
369.26	Now 3D printing
371.26	can break away barriers in design
373.26	which challenge the constraints
375.26	of mass production.
377.26	If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,
380.26	you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,
384.26	which means it's a more efficient product.
387.26	You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques
390.26	even if you tried to do it manually.
392.26	It's more efficient
394.26	because we can now create all these cavities within the object
397.26	that cool fluid.
399.26	And it's used by aerospace
401.26	and automotive.
404.26	It's a lighter part
407.26	and it uses less material waste.
409.26	So it's overall performance and efficiency
412.26	just exceeds standard mass produced products.
415.26	And then taking this idea
417.26	of creating a very detailed structure,
419.26	we can apply it to honeycomb structures
421.26	and use them within implants.
424.26	Typically an implant
426.26	is more effective within the body
428.26	if it's more porous,
430.26	because our body tissue will grow into it.
432.26	There's a lower chance of rejection.
435.26	But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.
438.26	With 3D printing,
440.26	we're seeing today
442.26	that we can create much better implants.
444.26	And in fact, because we can create
446.26	bespoke products en masse, one-offs,
449.26	we can create implants
451.26	that are specific to individuals.
453.26	So as you can see,
455.26	this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
459.26	And we're starting to see it being used
461.26	for final end products.
463.26	And in fact, as the detail is improving,
465.26	the quality is improving,
467.26	the price of the machines are falling
470.26	and they're becoming quicker.
472.26	They're also now small enough
474.26	to sit on a desktop.
476.26	You can buy a machine today for about $300
478.26	that you can create yourself,
480.26	which is quite incredible.
482.26	But then it begs the question,
484.26	why don't we all have one in our home?
487.26	Because, simply, most of us here today
489.26	don't know how to create the data
491.26	that a 3D printer reads.
493.26	If I gave you a 3D printer,
495.26	you wouldn't know how to direct it
497.26	to make what you want it to.
499.26	But there are more and more
501.26	technologies, software and processes today
503.26	that are breaking down those barriers.
505.26	I believe we're at a tipping point
507.26	where this is now something
510.26	that we can't avoid.
512.26	This technology
514.26	is really going to disrupt
516.26	the landscape of manufacturing
518.26	and, I believe, cause a revolution
520.26	in manufacturing.
522.26	So today,
524.26	you can download products from the Web --
526.26	anything you would have on your desktop,
528.26	like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.
531.26	You can use software like Google SketchUp
534.26	to create products from scratch
536.26	very easily.
539.26	3D printing can be also used
541.26	to download spare parts from the Web.
544.26	So imagine you have, say,
546.26	a Hoover in your home
548.26	and it has broken down. You need a spare part,
551.26	but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.
554.26	Can you imagine going online --
556.26	this is a reality --
558.26	and finding that spare part
560.26	from a database of geometries
562.26	of that discontinued product
564.26	and downloading that information, that data,
567.26	and having the product made for you at home,
569.26	ready to use, on your demand?
572.26	And in fact, because we can create spare parts
574.26	with things the machines
576.26	are quite literally making themselves.
578.26	You're having machines fabricate themselves.
581.26	These are parts of a RepRap machine,
583.26	which is a kind of desktop printer.
586.26	But what interests my company the most
589.26	is the fact that you can create
591.26	individual unique products en masse.
594.26	There's no need to do a run
596.26	of thousands of millions
598.26	or send that product to be injection molded in China.
601.26	You can just make it physically on the spot.
605.26	Which means
607.26	that we can now present to the public
609.26	the next generation of customization.
612.26	This is something that is now possible today,
614.26	that you can direct personally
616.26	how you want your products to look.
619.26	We're all familiar with the idea
621.26	of customization or personalization.
623.26	Brands like Nike are doing it.
625.26	It's all over the Web.
627.26	In fact, every major household name
629.26	is allowing you
631.26	to interact with their products
633.26	on a daily basis --
635.26	all the way from Smart Cars
637.26	to Prada
639.26	to Ray Ban, for example.
641.26	But this is not really mass customization;
643.26	it's known as variant production,
645.26	variations of the same product.
648.26	What you could do is really influence your product now
651.26	and shape-manipulate your product.
654.26	I'm not sure about you guys,
656.26	but I've had experiences
658.26	when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted
660.26	and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp
663.26	that I know where I want to sit in my house
665.26	and I just can't find the right thing,
667.26	or that perfect piece of jewelry
670.26	as a gift or for myself.
672.26	Imagine that you can now
674.26	engage with a brand
677.26	and interact,
679.26	so that you can pass your personal attributes
682.26	to the products that you're about to buy.
686.26	You can today
688.26	download a product with software like this,
690.26	view the product in 3D.
692.26	This is the sort of 3D data
694.26	that a machine will read.
696.26	This is a lamp.
698.26	And you can start iterating the design.
700.26	You can direct what color that product will be,
702.26	perhaps what material.
704.26	And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,
707.26	but within boundaries that are safe.
709.26	Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.
712.26	The piece of software will keep an individual
715.26	within the bounds of the possible.
719.26	And when somebody is ready to purchase the product
721.26	in their personalized design,
723.26	"they click ""Enter"" and this data gets converted"
726.26	into the data that a 3D printer reads
730.26	and gets passed to a 3D printer,
735.26	perhaps on someone's desktop.
738.26	But I don't think that that's immediate.
740.26	I don't think that will happen soon.
742.26	What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,
744.26	is that data gets sent
746.26	to a local manufacturing center.
748.26	This means lower carbon footprint.
751.26	We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,
754.26	we're sending data across the Internet.
756.26	Here's the product being built.
759.26	You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece
761.26	and the electronics were inserted later.
763.26	It's this lamp, as you can see here.
765.26	So as long as you have the data,
767.26	you can create the part on demand.
769.26	And you don't necessarily need to use this
771.26	for just aesthetic customization,
773.26	you can use it for functional customization,
775.26	scanning parts of the body
777.26	and creating things that are made to fit.
779.26	So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,
782.26	which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.
785.26	Or we can create very specific prosthetics
789.26	for that individual.
791.26	Scanning teeth today,
793.26	you can have your teeth scanned
795.26	and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.
797.26	While you wait at the dentist,
799.26	a machine will quietly be creating this for you
802.26	ready to insert in the teeth.
804.26	And the idea of now creating implants,
808.26	scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody
811.26	can now be converted into 3D data
813.26	and we can create very specific implants for them.
817.26	And applying this
819.26	to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.
821.26	You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.
824.26	It's very intricate.
826.26	You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.
828.26	But with MRI data,
830.26	we can just build the product,
832.26	as you can see, very intricately.
836.26	Using this process,
838.26	pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.
841.26	So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,
844.26	and he has been working
846.26	on layering cells to create body parts --
848.26	bladders, valves, kidneys.
852.26	Now this is not something that's ready for the public,
854.26	but it is in working progress.
857.26	So just to finalize, we're all individual.
859.26	We all have different preferences, different needs.
862.26	We like different things.
864.26	We're all different sizes and our companies the same.
866.26	Businesses want different things.
868.26	Without a doubt in my mind,
870.26	I believe that this technology
872.26	is going to cause a manufacturing revolution
874.26	and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.
877.26	Thank you.
879.26	(Applause)
