12.865	Do you think it's possible
12.865	to control someone's attention?
17.664	Even more than that,
17.664	what about predicting human behavior?
22.157	I think those are interesting ideas.
24.036	For me, that would be
24.036	the perfect superpower,
26.259	actually kind of an evil way
26.259	of approaching it.
28.616	But for myself, in the past,
28.616	I've spent the last 20 years
31.743	studying human behavior
31.743	from a rather unorthodox way:
35.245	picking pockets.
37.201	When we think of misdirection,
38.741	we think of something
38.741	as looking off to the side,
41.106	when actually the things
41.106	right in front of us
43.355	are often the hardest to see,
44.978	the things that you look at every day
44.978	that you're blinded to.
47.941	For example, how many of you still have
47.941	your cell phones on you right now?
52.671	Great. Double-check.
53.912	Make sure you still have them.
55.489	I was doing some shopping before.
57.195	(Laughter)
58.274	You've looked at them a few times today,
60.216	but I'll ask you a question.
61.59	Without looking at it directly yet,
63.467	can you remember the icon
63.467	in the bottom right corner?
67.95	Bring them out, check and see
67.95	how accurate you were.
74.382	How'd you do?
75.557	Show of hands. Did we get it?
78.326	Now that you're done, close them down.
80.184	Every phone has something in common.
81.936	No matter how you organize the icons,
83.943	you still have a clock on the front.
85.703	So, without looking at your phone,
85.703	what time was it?
89.568	You just looked at your clock, right?
91.56	Interesting idea.
92.735	Let's take that a step further
92.735	with a game of trust.
95.203	Close your eyes.
96.966	I realize I'm asking you to do
96.966	that while you just heard
99.632	there's a pickpocket in the room,
99.632	but close your eyes.
102.655	Now, you've been watching me
102.655	for about 30 seconds.
106.303	With your eyes closed, what am I wearing?
109.742	Make your best guess.
111.163	What color is my shirt?
111.163	What color is my tie?
114.671	Now open your eyes.
116.046	Show of hands, were you right?
118.776	Interesting, isn't it?
119.951	Some of us are a little bit
119.951	more perceptive than others, it seems.
123.095	But I have a different theory
123.095	about that model of attention.
126.055	They have fancy models of attention,
126.055	Posner's trinity model of attention.
129.614	For me, I like to think of it very
129.614	simple, like a surveillance system.
132.972	It's kind of like you have
132.972	all these fancy sensors,
135.763	and inside your brain
135.763	is a little security guard.
138.121	For me, I like to call him Frank.
140.532	So Frank is sitting at a desk.
142.512	He's got lots of cool
142.512	information in front of him,
144.875	high-tech equipment, he's got cameras,
146.749	he's got a little phone
146.749	that he can pick up, listen to the ears,
149.879	all these senses, all these perceptions.
152.354	But attention is what steers
152.354	your perceptions,
154.923	it's what controls your reality.
156.717	It's the gateway to the mind.
158.576	If you don't attend to something,
158.576	you can't be aware of it.
161.411	But ironically, you can attend
161.411	to something without being aware of it.
164.922	For example, the cocktail effect:
166.588	You're in a party, having
166.588	conversations with someone,
169.092	and yet you can recognize your name
170.799	without realizing
170.799	you were listening to that.
172.976	Now, for my job, I have to play
172.976	with techniques to exploit this,
176.05	to play with your attention
176.05	as a limited resource.
178.919	So if I could control
178.919	how you spend your attention,
182.054	if I could maybe steal your attention
182.054	through a distraction.
185.087	Now, instead of doing it like misdirection
187.871	and throwing it off to the side,
189.419	instead, what I choose
189.419	to focus on is Frank,
191.903	to be able to play with the Frank
191.903	inside your head,
194.474	your security guard,
195.649	and get you, instead of focusing
195.649	on your external senses,
198.48	just to go internal for a second.
201.365	So if I ask you to access
201.365	a memory, like, what is that?
204.575	What just happened? Do you have a wallet?
206.552	Do you have an American Express
206.552	in your wallet?
208.815	And when I do that,
208.815	your Frank turns around.
211.85	He accesses the file.
211.85	He has to rewind the tape.
214.16	What's interesting is,
214.16	he can't rewind the tape
216.383	at the same time that he's trying
216.383	to process new data.
219.263	This sounds like a good theory,
220.789	but I could talk for a long time,
220.789	tell you lots of things,
223.564	and a portion of them may be true,
225.294	but I think it's better if I tried
225.294	to show that to you here live.
228.378	If I come down, I'm going
228.378	to do a bit of shopping.
230.941	Just hold still where you are.
235.503	Hello, how are you?
235.503	It's lovely to see you.
238.211	Wonderful job onstage.
239.386	Lovely watch, it doesn't
239.386	come off very well.
241.474	Do you have a ring as well?
242.902	Good. Just taking inventory.
242.902	You're like a buffet.
245.272	Hard to tell where to start,
245.272	so many great things.
247.765	Hi, how are you? Good to see you.
249.449	Hi, sir, could you stand up, please?
249.449	Just right where you are.
252.386	You're married,
252.386	you follow directions well.
254.43	Nice to meet you, sir.
255.604	You don't have a lot in your pockets.
255.604	Anything down here?
259.288	Hopefully so. Have a seat. There you go.
259.288	You're doing well.
262.082	Hi, sir, how are you?
263.566	Good to see you, sir.
263.566	You have a ring, a watch.
265.795	Do you have a wallet on you? Joe: I don't.
267.898	AR: Well, we'll find one for you.
267.898	Come on up this way, Joe.
270.703	Give Joe a round of applause.
270.703	Come on up, Joe. Let's play a game.
273.798	(Applause)
278.437	AR: Pardon me.
280.535	I don't think I need this clicker anymore.
282.651	Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
284.603	Come on up to the stage, Joe.
284.603	Let's play a little game now.
287.437	Anything in your front pockets?
289.132	J: Money.
290.307	AR: Money! All right, let's try that.
292.56	Can you stand right over this way for me?
295.352	Turn around and, let's see,
296.701	if I give you something
296.701	that belongs to me,
298.741	this is just something I have,
300.952	a poker chip.
302.131	Hold out your hand for me.
304.044	Watch it closely.
305.218	This is a task for you to focus on.
307.439	You have your money in your front pocket?
309.598	J: Yup.
309.598	AR: Good.
310.773	I won't put my hand in your pocket.
310.773	I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
314.489	Once a guy had a hole in his pocket,
316.246	and that was rather traumatizing for me.
318.183	I wanted his wallet,
318.183	he gave me his number.
320.22	Big miscommunication.
321.403	(Laughter)
322.428	Let's do this simply.
322.428	Squeeze your hand tight.
324.61	Do you feel the poker chip in your hand?
326.555	J: I do.
327.729	AR: Would you be surprised
327.729	if I took it? Say yes.
330.052	J: Very.
330.052	AR: Good.
331.227	Open your hand. Thank you very much.
333.034	I'll cheat if you give me a chance.
334.758	Make it harder for me. Just use your hand.
336.846	Grab my wrist, but squeeze, squeeze firm.
338.841	Did you see it go? Joe: No.
341.039	AR: No, it's not here. Open your hand.
342.873	While we're focused on the hand,
342.873	it's sitting on your shoulder.
347.055	Go ahead and take it off.
348.566	Now, let's try that again.
350.038	Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.
351.968	Put your hand up a little bit higher,
351.968	but watch it close.
354.809	If I did it slowly,
354.809	it'd be on your shoulder.
357.983	(Laughter)
359.423	Joe, we're going to keep doing
359.423	this till you catch it.
362.019	You'll get it eventually.
362.019	I have faith in you.
364.217	Squeeze firm.
364.217	You're human, you're not slow.
366.331	It's back on your shoulder.
368.241	You were focused on your hand, distracted.
370.463	While you were watching,
370.463	I couldn't get your watch off.
373.353	Yet you had something inside your pocket.
375.616	Do you remember what it was?
377.418	J: Money.
378.593	AR: Check your pocket. Is it still there?
380.661	(Laughter)
381.686	Oh, there it was. Put it away.
383.656	We're just shopping.
384.831	This trick's more about the timing.
386.543	I'm going to try to push it
386.543	inside your hand.
388.709	Put your other hand on top, would you?
390.903	It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
392.696	Looks a lot like the watch
392.696	I was wearing, doesn't it?
395.225	(Laughter) (Applause)
396.55	J: That's pretty good.
396.55	AR: Oh, thanks.
398.94	(Applause)
401.226	But it's only a start.
401.226	Let's try it a little bit differently.
404.13	Hold your hands together.
404.13	Your other hand on top.
406.504	If you're watching this little token,
408.3	this obviously has become
408.3	a little target, like a red herring.
411.272	If we watch this kind of close,
411.272	it looks like it goes away.
414.073	It's not back on your shoulder.
415.673	It falls out of the air,
415.673	lands right back in the hand.
418.269	Did you see it go?
420.276	Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy.
420.276	He's union, works up there all day.
423.694	If I do it slowly it goes straight away,
423.694	it lands by your pocket.
426.869	Is it in this pocket, sir?
428.146	Don't reach in your pocket.
428.146	That's a different show.
430.623	(Squeaking)
431.717	That's rather strange.
431.717	They have shots for that.
434.085	Can I show them? Rather bizarre.
434.085	Is this yours, sir?
436.6	I have no idea how that works.
436.6	We'll send that over there.
439.677	I need help with this one.
441.074	Step over this way for me.
442.367	Don't run away. You had something
442.367	down by your pants pocket.
445.239	I was checking mine.
445.239	I couldn't find everything,
447.516	but I noticed you had something here.
449.314	Can I feel the outside for a moment?
451.212	Down here I noticed this.
451.212	Is this something of yours, sir?
454.45	I have no idea. That's a shrimp.
456.034	J: Yeah. I'm saving it for later.
458.16	AR: You've entertained
458.16	all of these people in a wonderful way,
461.208	better than you know.
462.382	So we'd love to give you this
462.382	lovely watch as a gift.
465.425	(Laughter)
466.45	Hopefully it matches his taste.
467.972	We have a couple of other things,
469.659	a little bit of cash.
471.373	And we have a few other things,
472.882	these all belong to you,
474.072	along with a big round of applause
474.072	from all your friends.
476.774	(Applause)
477.805	Joe, thank you very much.
479.035	(Applause)
483.913	(Applause ends)
485.934	So, same question I asked you before,
488.608	but this time you don't have
488.608	to close your eyes.
491.866	What am I wearing?
493.611	Audience: Oh!
494.786	(Laughter)
496.739	(Hesitant applause)
501.522	(Applause ends)
502.974	Attention is a powerful thing.
504.899	Like I said, it shapes your reality.
507.86	So, I guess I'd like to pose
507.86	that question to you.
510.319	If you could control somebody's attention,
512.485	what would you do with it?
514.6	Thank you.
515.783	(Applause)
