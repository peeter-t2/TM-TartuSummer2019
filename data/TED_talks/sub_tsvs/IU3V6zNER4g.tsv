26.063	I'm not quite sure whether
26.063	I really want to see a snare drum
29.724	at nine o'clock or so in the morning.
31.82	(Laughter)
33.242	But anyway, it's just great
33.242	to see such a full theater,
37.336	and really, I must thank
37.336	Herbie Hancock and his colleagues
40.645	for such a great presentation.
43.173	(Applause)
46.268	One of the interesting things, of course,
48.478	is the combination of that raw hand
48.478	on the instrument and technology,
55.911	and what he said about listening
55.911	to our young people.
60.575	Of course, my job is all about listening.
65.094	And my aim, really,
65.094	is to teach the world to listen.
71.063	That's my only real aim in life.
75.394	And it sounds quite simple,
75.394	but actually, it's quite a big, big job.
81.555	Because you know, when you look
81.555	at a piece of music, for example,
86.849	if I just open my little motorbike bag --
91.647	we have here, hopefully,
94.679	a piece of music that is full
94.679	of little black dots on the page.
101.494	And, you know, we open it up ...
107.732	And I read the music.
109.554	So technically, I can actually read this.
114	I will follow the instructions,
114	the tempo markings, the dynamics.
118.586	I will do exactly as I'm told.
122.717	And so therefore, because time is short,
126.133	if I just played you, literally,
126.133	the first, maybe, two lines or so --
133.738	It's very straightforward; there's nothing
133.738	too difficult about the piece.
137.258	But here, I'm being told
137.258	that the piece of music is very quick.
141.55	I'm being told where to play on the drum.
144.58	I'm being told which part
144.58	of the stick to use.
148.847	And I'm being told the dynamic.
151.469	And I'm also being told
151.469	that the drum is without snares.
156.094	Snares on, snares off.
159.13	So therefore, if I translate
159.13	this piece of music,
165.006	we have this idea.
168.074	(Drum sounds)
195.823	(Drum sounds end)
198.266	And so on.
199.557	My career would probably last
199.557	about five years.
203.063	(Laughter)
204.091	However, what I have to do as a musician
208.638	is do everything that is not on the music;
212.77	everything that there isn't time
212.77	to learn from a teacher,
217.798	or to talk about, even, from a teacher.
221.382	But it's the things you notice when
221.382	you're not actually with your instrument
226.259	that, in fact, become so interesting,
226.259	and that you want to explore
231.53	through this tiny, tiny surface of a drum.
235.022	So there, we experience the translation.
237.747	Now we'll experience the interpretation.
242.082	(Drum sounds)
283.976	(Drum sounds end)
287.513	(Applause)
295.058	Now my career may last a little longer.
297.793	(Laughter)
299.144	But in a way, you know,
299.144	it's the same if I look at you
302.453	and I see a nice, bright young lady
302.453	with a pink top on.
306.817	I see that you're clutching
306.817	a teddy bear, etc., etc.
310.259	So I get a basic idea
310.259	as to what you might be about,
314.841	what you might like, what you might do
314.841	as a profession, etc., etc.
319.642	However, that's just the initial idea
319.642	I may have that we all get
326.027	when we actually look
326.027	and we try to interpret.
329.633	But actually it's so unbelievably shallow.
331.957	In the same way, I look
331.957	at the music; I get a basic idea;
334.886	I wonder what technically might be hard,
334.886	or, you know, what I want to do.
339.204	Just the basic feeling.
340.718	However, that is simply not enough.
343.405	And I think what Herbie said:
343.405	please listen, listen.
347.743	We have to listen
347.743	to ourselves, first of all.
351.403	If I play, for example,
351.403	holding the stick --
355.172	where literally I do not let go
355.172	of the stick --
358.249	(Drum sound)
360.838	you'll experience quite a lot
360.838	of shock coming up through the arm.
364.679	And you feel really quite --
364.679	believe it or not --
367.028	detached from the instrument
367.028	and from the stick,
370.295	even though I'm actually holding
370.295	the stick quite tightly.
374.441	(Drum sound)
375.89	By holding it tightly,
375.89	I feel strangely more detached.
379.871	If I just simply let go
381.612	and allow my hand, my arm,
381.612	to be more of a support system,
386.831	suddenly --
388.053	(Drum sound)
390.091	I have more dynamic with less effort.
393.572	Much more --
394.771	(Drum sound)
396.546	and I just feel, at last,
396.546	one with the stick
399.503	and one with the drum.
401.186	And I'm doing far, far less.
403.323	So in the same way that I need
403.323	time with this instrument,
406.759	I need time with people
406.759	in order to interpret them.
412.11	Not just translate them,
412.11	but interpret them.
414.822	If, for example, I play just
414.822	a few bars of a piece of music
422.289	for which I think of myself
422.289	as a technician --
427.703	that is, someone who is basically
427.703	a percussion player --
431.983	(Marimba sounds)
442.973	(Marimba sounds end)
444.894	And so on, if I think of myself
444.894	as a musician --
448.106	(Marimba sounds)
467.867	(Marimba sounds end)
469.934	And so on.
471.132	There is a little bit of a difference
471.132	there that is worth just --
475.018	(Applause)
477.593	thinking about.
479	And I remember when I was 12 years old,
482.933	and I started playing timpani
482.933	and percussion,
486.075	and my teacher said,
488.529	"""Well, how are we going to do this?"
488.529	"You know, music is about listening."""
494.206	"And I said, ""Yes, I agree with that,"
494.206	"so what's the problem?"""
498.901	"And he said, ""Well,"
498.901	how are you going to hear this?
501.344	"How are you going to hear that?"""
502.926	"And I said, ""Well, how do you hear it?"""
505.507	"He said, ""Well, I think"
505.507	"I hear it through here."""
509	"And I said, ""Well, I think I do too,"
509	but I also hear it through my hands,
514.398	through my arms, cheekbones, my scalp,
517.961	"my tummy, my chest, my legs and so on."""
521.002	And so we began our lessons
521.002	every single time
525.858	tuning drums, in particular,
525.858	the kettle drums, or timpani
529.824	to such a narrow pitch interval,
529.824	so something like --
535.606	(Marimba sounds)
540.04	that of a difference.
541.237	Then gradually:
542.463	(Marimba sounds)
543.644	And gradually:
544.848	(Marimba sounds)
546.663	And it's amazing that when you do
546.663	open your body up,
550.746	and open your hand up to allow
550.746	the vibration to come through,
554.745	that in fact the tiny, tiny difference --
557.092	(Marimba sounds)
559.175	can be felt with just the tiniest
559.175	part of your finger, there.
565.281	And so what we would do
565.281	is that I would put my hands
568.171	on the wall of the music room,
570.51	"and together, we would ""listen"""
570.51	to the sounds of the instruments,
575.728	and really try to connect
575.728	with those sounds
579.588	far, far more broadly
579.588	than simply depending on the ear.
584.005	Because of course, the ear
584.005	is subject to all sorts of things.
588.672	The room we happen to be in,
588.672	the amplification,
591.665	the quality of the instrument,
591.665	the type of sticks --
594.424	(Marimba sounds)
600.844	(Marimba sounds end)
602.815	Etc., etc., they're all different.
604.658	(Marimba sounds)
609.117	(Marimba sounds end)
611.238	Same amount of weight,
611.238	but different sound colors.
615.847	And that's basically what we are;
615.847	we're just human beings,
618.775	but we all have our own
618.775	little sound colors, as it were,
621.964	that make up these extraordinary
621.964	personalities and characters
625.637	and interests and things.
627.534	And as I grew older, I then auditioned
630.558	for the Royal Academy of Music in London,
633	"and they said, ""Well, no, we won't"
633	accept you, because we haven't a clue,
637.298	you know, of the future
637.298	"of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"""
641.975	And I just couldn't quite accept that.
646.526	And so therefore, I said to them,
646.526	"""Well, look, if you refuse --"
653.118	if you refuse me through those reasons,
656.467	as opposed to the ability to perform
661.259	and to understand and love
661.259	the art of creating sound --
668	then we have to think very, very hard
668	"about the people you do actually accept."""
674.263	And as a result,
674.263	once we got over a little hurdle,
678.545	and having to audition twice,
680.578	they accepted me.
682.817	And not only that,
684.207	what had happened was that it changed
684.207	the whole role of the music institutions
689.874	throughout the United Kingdom.
691.85	Under no circumstances were they to refuse
695.822	any application whatsoever
699.761	on the basis of whether someone
699.761	had no arms, no legs --
703.293	they could still perhaps play a wind
703.293	instrument if it was supported on a stand.
708.368	No circumstances at all
708.368	were used to refuse any entry.
714.647	And every single entry
714.647	had to be listened to, experienced,
719.509	and then, based on the musical ability,
722.09	then that person
722.09	could either enter or not.
727.366	And so therefore, this in turn meant
730.544	that there was an extremely
730.544	interesting bunch of students
734.205	who arrived in these various
734.205	music institutions,
737.579	and I have to say, many of them now
737.579	in the professional orchestras
742.092	throughout the world.
744.095	The interesting thing
744.095	about this as well, though --
746.805	(Applause)
751	is quite simply that not only were people
751	connected with sound --
757.814	which is basically all of us --
759.349	we well know that music
759.349	really is our daily medicine.
764.295	"I say ""music,"" but actually"
764.295	"I mean ""sound."""
767	Because some of the extraordinary
767	things I've experienced as a musician --
771.649	when you may have a 15-year-old lad
775.812	who has got the most
775.812	incredible challenges,
780.565	who may not be able
780.565	to control his movements,
783.326	who may be deaf,
783.326	who may be blind, etc., etc. --
786.363	suddenly, if that young lad
786.363	sits close to this instrument,
792.417	and perhaps even lies
792.417	underneath the marimba,
795.252	and you play something
795.252	that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --
801	I don't really have
801	the right sticks, perhaps --
803.884	but something like this --
803.884	let me change --
809.935	(Soft marimba sounds)
855.167	(Soft marimba sounds end)
857.826	Something that's so unbelievably simple --
860.732	but he would be experiencing
860.732	something that I wouldn't be,
865.076	because I'm on top of the sound.
867.518	I have the sound coming this way.
869.808	He would have the sound
869.808	coming through the resonators.
873.39	If there were no resonators
873.39	on here, we would have:
876.894	(Marimba sounds)
883.106	So he would have a fullness of sound
885.449	that those of you in the front few rows
885.449	wouldn't experience,
888.471	those of you in the back few rows
888.471	wouldn't experience, either.
891.64	Every single one of us,
891.64	depending on where we're sitting,
894.757	will experience this sound
894.757	quite, quite differently.
898.558	And of course, being
898.558	the participator of the sound,
901.452	and that is, starting from the idea
901.452	of what type of sound
906.302	I want to produce,
906.302	for example, this sound:
910	(No sound)
916.171	Can you hear anything?
919.108	Exactly -- because
919.108	I'm not even touching it.
921.878	(Laughter)
923.427	But yet, we get the sensation
923.427	of something happening.
928.078	In the same way
928.078	that when I see a tree moves,
930.661	then I imagine that tree
930.661	making a rustling sound.
934.903	Do you see what I mean?
936.153	Whatever the eye sees,
936.153	then there's always sound happening.
940.294	So there's always, always that huge --
944.513	I mean, just this kaleidoscope
944.513	of things to draw from.
948.823	So all of my performances
948.823	are based on entirely what I experience,
954.816	and not by learning a piece of music,
957.336	putting on someone else's
957.336	interpretation of it,
959.562	buying all the CDs possible
959.562	of that particular piece of music,
962.765	and so on and so forth,
964.155	because that isn't giving me enough
964.155	of something that is so raw and so basic,
970.531	and something that I can fully
970.531	experience the journey of.
975.682	So it may be that, in certain halls,
979.933	this dynamic may well work.
985.169	(Soft marimba sounds)
992.37	(Soft marimba sounds end)
994.396	It may be that in other halls,
995.952	they're simply not going
995.952	to experience that at all,
999.211	and so therefore, my level of soft,
999.211	gentle playing may have to be --
1003.443	(Marimba sounds)
1025.47	(Marimba sounds end)
1027.495	Do you see what I mean?
1028.861	So, because of this explosion
1028.861	in access to sound,
1035.143	especially through the Deaf community,
1037.678	this has not only affected
1037.678	how music institutions,
1042.129	how schools for the deaf treat sound,
1042.129	and not just as a means of therapy --
1048.922	although, of course,
1048.922	being a participator of music,
1051.559	that definitely is the case as well --
1054.181	but it's meant that acousticians
1054.181	have had to really think
1059.304	about the types of halls
1059.304	they put together.
1063.35	There are so few halls in this world
1065.838	that actually have
1065.838	very good acoustics, dare I say.
1071.179	But by that I mean, where you can
1071.179	absolutely do anything you imagine.
1076.788	The tiniest, softest, softest sound
1076.788	to something that is so broad,
1081.63	so huge, so incredible.
1084.376	There's always something:
1085.794	it may sound good up there,
1085.794	may not be so good there;
1088.322	it may be great there,
1088.322	but terrible up there;
1090.489	maybe terrible over there,
1090.489	but not too bad there, etc., etc.
1094.697	So to find an actual hall is incredible --
1099.143	for which you can play
1099.143	exactly what you imagine,
1103.243	without it being cosmetically enhanced.
1106.374	So therefore, acousticians
1106.374	are actually in conversation
1111.455	with people who are hearing impaired,
1114.774	and who are participators of sound.
1119.649	And this is quite interesting.
1121.5	I cannot give you any detail
1125.511	as far as what is actually happening
1125.511	with those halls,
1129.272	but it's just the fact
1129.272	that they are going to a group of people
1133.404	for whom so many years, we've been saying,
1137.374	"""Well, how on earth can they experience"
1137.374	"music? They're deaf."""
1140.739	We go like that, and we imagine
1140.739	that's what deafness is about.
1144.078	Or we go like that, and we imagine
1144.078	that's what blindness is about.
1147.238	If we see someone in a wheelchair,
1147.238	we assume they cannot walk.
1151.084	It may be that they can walk
1151.084	three, four, five steps.
1154.632	That, to them, means they can walk.
1158.594	In a year's time,
1158.594	it could be two extra steps.
1162.299	In another year's time, three extra steps.
1165.076	Those are hugely important
1165.076	aspects to think about.
1169.803	So when we do listen to each other,
1174	it's unbelievably important for us
1177.713	to really test our listening skills,
1182.355	to really use our bodies
1182.355	as a resonating chamber,
1185.851	to stop the judgment.
1187.524	For me, as a musician who deals
1187.524	with 99 percent of new music,
1191.419	it's very easy for me to say,
1193.367	"""Oh yes, I like that piece."
1193.367	"No, I don't like that piece,"" and so on."
1196.992	And I just find that I have to give
1196.992	those pieces of music real time.
1202.145	It may be that the chemistry
1202.145	isn't quite right between myself
1205.442	and that particular piece of music,
1207.243	but that doesn't mean I have the right
1207.243	to say it's a bad piece of music.
1212.077	And you know, one of the great things
1212.077	about being a musician
1217.201	is that it is so unbelievably fluid.
1220.781	So there are no rules, no right,
1220.781	no wrong, this way, that way.
1225.209	If I asked you to clap --
1225.209	maybe I can do this.
1230.061	"If I can just say, ""Please clap"
1230.061	"and create the sound of thunder."""
1236.459	I'm assuming we've all
1236.459	experienced thunder.
1239.782	Now, I don't mean just the sound;
1241.388	I mean really listen
1241.388	to that thunder within yourselves.
1246.329	And please try to create that
1246.329	through your clapping.
1248.811	Try, just -- please try.
1250.784	(Loud clapping sounds)
1258.561	(Clapping ends)
1260.103	Snow.
1261.485	(Laughter)
1263.645	Snow.
1264.837	(Soft clapping sounds)
1267.097	Have you ever heard snow?
1268.666	Audience: No.
1269.841	Evelyn Glennie: Well, then, stop clapping.
1272.023	(Laughter)
1273.446	Try again. Try again: snow.
1277.016	(No sound)
1280.822	See, you're awake.
1283.095	Rain.
1284.714	(Light clapping sounds)
1286.887	EG: (Laughs)
1289.354	Not bad. Not bad.
1292.108	The interesting thing here, though,
1292.108	is that I asked a group of kids
1296.888	not so long ago
1298.615	exactly the same question.
1300.804	Now -- great imagination,
1300.804	thank you very much.
1304.207	However, not one of you got out
1304.207	of your seats to think,
1307.053	"""Right! How can I clap?"
1308.744	OK, maybe:
1309.99	(Clapping sounds)
1312.523	Maybe I can use my jewelry
1312.523	to create extra sounds.
1315.379	Maybe I can use the other parts
1315.379	"of my body to create extra sounds."""
1319.439	Not a single one of you thought
1319.439	about clapping in a slightly different way
1324.856	other than sitting in your seats
1324.856	there and using two hands.
1327.998	In the same way, when we listen to music,
1330.167	we assume that it's all being
1330.167	fed through here.
1334.132	This is how we experience music.
1336.7	Of course, it's not.
1338.395	We experience thunder, thunder, thunder.
1341.242	Think, think, think.
1342.463	Listen, listen, listen.
1344.852	Now, what can we do with thunder?
1349.266	I remember my teacher, when I first
1349.266	started, my very first lesson,
1354.684	I was all prepared
1354.684	with sticks, ready to go.
1358.093	And instead of him saying,
1358.093	"""OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,"
1362.913	arms at a more or less 90-degree angle,
1362.913	sticks in a more or less V shape,
1368.777	keep this amount of space here, etc.
1371.845	Please keep your back straight,
1371.845	"etc., etc., etc."" --"
1374.423	where I was just probably going to end up
1374.423	absolutely rigid, frozen,
1378.611	and I would not be able to strike the drum
1380.644	because I was thinking
1380.644	of so many other things,
1382.888	"he said, ""Evelyn, take this drum"
1382.888	away for seven days,
1385.475	"and I'll see you next week."""
1387.284	So -- heavens! What was I to do?
1389.713	I no longer required the sticks.
1392.215	I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
1394.387	I had to basically look
1394.387	at this particular drum,
1398.048	see how it was made,
1399.745	what these little lugs did,
1399.745	what the snares did.
1402.785	Turned it upside down,
1402.785	experimented with the shell.
1405.761	(Drum sounds)
1407.498	Experimented with the head.
1408.868	(Drum sounds)
1410.354	Experimented with my body.
1412.158	(Drum sounds)
1413.976	Experimented with jewelry.
1415.824	Experimented with all sorts of things.
1417.936	(Drum sounds)
1424.356	(Drum sounds end)
1428.182	And of course, I returned
1428.182	with all sorts of bruises.
1431.406	(Laughter)
1432.681	But nevertheless, it was such
1432.681	an unbelievable experience,
1436.065	because where on earth are you going
1436.065	to experience that in a piece of music?
1440.791	Where on earth are you going
1440.791	to experience that in a study book?
1444.801	So we never, ever dealt
1444.801	with actual study books.
1448.53	So for example,
1448.53	one of the things that we learn
1451.21	when we are dealing
1451.21	with being a percussion player
1455.918	as opposed to a musician,
1457.301	is basically, straightforward
1457.301	single-stroke rolls.
1460.93	(Drum sounds)
1464.578	Like that, and then
1464.578	we get a little faster --
1466.712	(Drum sounds)
1467.904	and a little faster --
1469.124	(Drum sounds)
1470.326	and a little faster,
1470.326	and so on and so forth.
1472.832	What does this piece require?
1474.295	Single-stroke rolls.
1475.694	(Drum sound)
1478.917	So why can't I then do that
1478.917	whilst learning a piece of music?
1482.403	And that's exactly what he did.
1485.245	And interestingly, the older I became,
1485.245	and when I became a full-time student
1490.619	"at a so-called ""music institution,"""
1490.619	all of that went out of the window.
1495.901	We had to study from study books.
1498.666	"And constantly, the question, ""Well, why?"
1498.666	Why? What is this relating to?
1502.791	"I need to play a piece of music."""
1504.415	"""Well, this will help your control."""
1506.196	"""Well, how? Why do I need to learn that?"
1508.779	I need to relate it to a piece of music.
1511.308	You know, I need to say something.
1513.894	Why am I practicing paradiddles?
1516.024	(Drum sounds)
1520.03	Is it just literally for control,
1520.03	for hand-stick control?
1523.921	Why am I doing that?
1525.329	I need to have the reason,
1527.753	and the reason has to be by saying
1527.753	"something through the music."""
1533.358	And by saying something through music,
1533.358	which basically is sound,
1537.875	we then can reach all sorts
1537.875	of things to all sorts of people.
1542.271	But I don't want to take responsibility
1542.271	of your emotional baggage.
1546.544	That's up to you,
1546.544	when you walk through a hall,
1548.792	because that then determines
1548.792	what and how we listen to certain things.
1554.15	I may feel sorrowful, or happy,
1554.15	or exhilarated, or angry
1559.455	when I play certain pieces of music,
1561.267	but I'm not necessarily wanting you
1561.267	to feel exactly the same thing.
1566.168	So please, the next time
1566.168	you go to a concert,
1569.296	just allow your body to open up,
1572.965	allow your body to be
1572.965	this resonating chamber.
1576.071	Be aware that you're not going
1576.071	to experience the same thing
1579.372	as the performer is.
1581.102	The performer is in the worst possible
1581.102	position for the actual sound,
1584.866	because they're hearing
1584.866	the contact of the stick --
1588.446	(Drum sound)
1589.982	on the drum, or the mallet
1589.982	on the bit of wood,
1592.875	or the bow on the string, etc.,
1595.086	or the breath that's creating
1595.086	the sound from wind and brass.
1599.248	They're experiencing that rawness there.
1601.793	But yet they're experiencing
1601.793	something so unbelievably pure,
1605.665	which is before the sound
1605.665	is actually happening.
1609.519	Please take note of the life of the sound
1609.519	after the actual initial strike,
1616.099	or breath, is being pulled.
1618.528	Just experience the whole
1618.528	journey of that sound
1622.8	in the same way that I wished
1622.8	I'd experienced the whole journey
1626.422	of this particular conference,
1626.422	rather than just arriving last night.
1630.875	But I hope maybe we can share
1630.875	one or two things as the day progresses.
1635.556	But thank you very much for having me!
1638.319	(Applause)
1644.262	(Applause ends)
1657.957	(Music)
1922.631	(Music ends)
1928.244	(Applause)
