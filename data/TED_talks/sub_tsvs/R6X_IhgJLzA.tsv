447.26	Thank you.
449.26	Imagining a solo cello concert,
452.26	one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach
455.26	unaccompanied cello suites.
458.26	As a child
460.26	studying these eternal masterpieces,
463.26	Bach's music would intermingle
465.26	with the singing voices of Muslim prayers
468.26	from the neighboring Arab village
470.26	of the northern Kibbutz in Israel
472.26	where I grew up.
474.26	Late at night, after hours of practicing,
476.26	I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday
479.26	as the sounds of tango music
481.26	would be creeping from my parents' stereo.
484.26	It all became music to me.
487.26	I didn't hear the boundaries.
490.26	I still start every day
492.26	practicing playing Bach.
494.26	His music never ceases
496.26	to sound fresh and surprising to me.
498.26	But as I was moving away
500.26	from the traditional classical repertoire
502.26	and trying to find new ways
504.26	of musical expression,
506.26	I realized that with today's technological resources,
509.26	there's no reason to limit
511.26	what can be produced at one time
514.26	from a single string instrument.
516.26	The power and coherency
518.26	that comes from one person hearing, perceiving and playing all the voices
522.26	makes a very different experience.
525.26	The excitement of a great orchestra performance
528.26	comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians
531.26	producing one unified whole concept.
534.26	The excitement from using multi-tracking,
537.26	the way I did in the piece you will hear next,
541.26	comes from the attempt
543.26	to build and create a whole universe
546.26	with many diverse layers,
549.26	all generated from a single source.
552.26	My cello and my voice are layered
554.26	to create this large sonic canvas.
557.26	When composers write music for me,
560.26	I ask them to forget what they know about the cello.
562.26	I hope to arrive at new territories
565.26	to discover sounds I have never heard before.
568.26	I want to create endless possibilities
570.26	with this cello.
572.26	I become the medium through which the music is being channeled,
575.26	and in the process, when all is right,
578.26	the music is transformed
580.26	and so am I.
