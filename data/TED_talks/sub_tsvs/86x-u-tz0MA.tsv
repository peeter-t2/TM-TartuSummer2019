13.145	I am a writer.
14.712	Writing books is my profession
14.712	but it's more than that, of course.
18.472	It is also my great lifelong
18.472	love and fascination.
22.396	And I don't expect
22.396	that that's ever going to change.
25.311	But, that said, something
25.311	kind of peculiar has happened recently
30.346	in my life and in my career,
32.595	which has caused me to have to recalibrate
32.595	my whole relationship with this work.
37.362	And the peculiar thing
37.362	is that I recently wrote this book,
40.996	"this memoir called ""Eat, Pray, Love"""
42.964	which, decidedly
42.964	unlike any of my previous books,
47.529	went out in the world
47.529	for some reason, and became this big,
50.597	mega-sensation, international
50.597	bestseller thing.
53.963	The result of which
53.963	is that everywhere I go now,
57.029	people treat me like I'm doomed.
59.629	Seriously -- doomed, doomed!
62.511	Like, they come up to me now,
62.511	all worried, and they say,
65.202	"""Aren't you afraid you're never"
65.202	going to be able to top that?
69.4	Aren't you afraid you're going
69.4	to keep writing for your whole life
72.646	and you're never again
72.646	going to create a book
74.813	that anybody in the world
74.813	cares about at all,
77.379	"ever again?"""
79.879	So that's reassuring, you know.
82.228	But it would be worse,
82.228	except for that I happen to remember
85.039	that over 20 years ago,
85.039	when I was a teenager,
88.298	when I first started telling people
88.298	that I wanted to be a writer,
91.445	I was met with this same
91.445	sort of fear-based reaction.
94.016	"And people would say, ""Aren't you afraid"
94.016	you're never going to have any success?
97.85	Aren't you afraid the humiliation
97.85	of rejection will kill you?
100.797	Aren't you afraid that you're going
100.797	to work your whole life at this craft
104.281	and nothing's ever going to come of it
106.161	and you're going to die
106.161	on a scrap heap of broken dreams
108.82	with your mouth filled
108.82	"with bitter ash of failure?"""
111.311	(Laughter)
112.664	Like that, you know.
114.516	The answer -- the short answer
114.516	"to all those questions is, ""Yes."""
119.677	Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
121.977	And I always have been.
123.242	And I'm afraid of many,
123.242	many more things besides
125.552	that people can't even guess at,
127.477	like seaweed and other
127.477	things that are scary.
131.458	But, when it comes to writing,
133.709	the thing that I've been sort of thinking
133.709	about lately, and wondering about lately,
137.693	is why?
138.867	You know, is it rational?
140.161	Is it logical that anybody
140.161	should be expected
142.408	to be afraid of the work that they feel
142.408	they were put on this Earth to do.
147.06	And what is it specifically
147.06	about creative ventures
151.46	that seems to make us really nervous
151.46	about each other's mental health
154.932	in a way that other careers
154.932	kind of don't do, you know?
157.959	Like my dad, for example,
157.959	was a chemical engineer
161.982	and I don't recall once in his 40 years
161.982	of chemical engineering
165.359	anybody asking him if he was afraid
165.359	to be a chemical engineer, you know?
169.041	"""That chemical-engineering block,"
169.041	"John, how's it going?"""
174.852	It just didn't come up
174.852	like that, you know?
177.016	But to be fair,
177.016	chemical engineers as a group
180.85	haven't really earned
180.85	a reputation over the centuries
183.398	for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
186.094	(Laughter)
187.542	We writers, we kind of do have
187.542	that reputation,
190.376	and not just writers,
190.376	but creative people across all genres,
194.359	it seems, have this reputation
194.359	for being enormously mentally unstable.
199.06	And all you have to do is look
199.06	at the very grim death count
202.876	in the 20th century alone,
202.876	of really magnificent creative minds
206.459	who died young and often
206.459	at their own hands, you know?
209.585	And even the ones
209.585	who didn't literally commit suicide
212.851	seem to be really undone
212.851	by their gifts, you know.
216.227	Norman Mailer, just before he died,
216.227	last interview, he said,
219.126	"""Every one of my books"
219.126	"has killed me a little more."""
223.227	An extraordinary statement
223.227	to make about your life's work.
226.826	But we don't even blink
226.826	when we hear somebody say this,
229.786	because we've heard
229.786	that kind of stuff for so long
232.392	and somehow we've completely
232.392	internalized and accepted collectively
236.393	this notion that creativity and suffering
236.393	are somehow inherently linked
241.06	and that artistry, in the end,
241.06	will always ultimately lead to anguish.
246.126	And the question that I want
246.126	to ask everybody here today
248.817	is are you guys all cool with that idea?
251.334	Are you comfortable with that?
253.541	Because you look at it
253.541	even from an inch away and, you know --
256.565	I'm not at all comfortable
256.565	with that assumption.
259.692	I think it's odious.
261.178	And I also think it's dangerous,
263.131	and I don't want to see it
263.131	perpetuated into the next century.
266.06	I think it's better if we encourage
266.06	our great creative minds to live.
269.934	And I definitely know that,
269.934	in my case -- in my situation --
275.709	it would be very dangerous for me to start
275.709	sort of leaking down that dark path
280.872	of assumption,
282.093	particularly given the circumstance
282.093	that I'm in right now in my career.
286.246	Which is -- you know, like check it out,
288.785	I'm pretty young,
288.785	I'm only about 40 years old.
291	I still have maybe another four
291	decades of work left in me.
294.294	And it's exceedingly likely that anything
294.294	I write from this point forward
298.811	is going to be judged by the world
298.811	as the work that came after
301.788	the freakish success
301.788	of my last book, right?
305.111	I should just put it bluntly, because
305.111	we're all sort of friends here now --
309.073	it's exceedingly likely
309.073	that my greatest success is behind me.
313.354	So Jesus, what a thought!
315.554	That's the kind of thought
315.554	that could lead a person
317.984	to start drinking gin
317.984	at nine o'clock in the morning,
320.612	and I don't want to go there.
323.549	(Laughter)
324.607	I would prefer to keep doing
324.607	this work that I love.
327.061	And so, the question becomes, how?
330.399	And so, it seems to me,
330.399	upon a lot of reflection,
333.283	that the way that I have to work now,
333.283	in order to continue writing,
336.648	is that I have to create some sort of
336.648	protective psychological construct, right?
340.482	I have to sort of find some way
340.482	to have a safe distance
343.982	between me, as I am writing,
343.982	and my very natural anxiety
348.867	about what the reaction to that writing
348.867	is going to be, from now on.
352.732	And, as I've been looking,
352.732	over the last year,
355.143	for models for how to do that,
357	I've been sort of looking across time,
359.148	and I've been trying
359.148	to find other societies
361.25	to see if they might have had
361.25	better and saner ideas than we have
365	about how to help creative people
367.227	sort of manage the inherent
367.227	emotional risks of creativity.
371.033	And that search has led me
371.033	to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
376.048	So stay with me, because
376.048	it does circle around and back.
378.739	But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --
380.895	people did not happen
380.895	to believe that creativity
383.461	came from human beings back then, OK?
385.879	People believed that creativity
385.879	was this divine attendant spirit
390.338	that came to human beings
390.338	from some distant and unknowable source,
394.339	for distant and unknowable reasons.
396.788	The Greeks famously called these divine
396.788	"attendant spirits of creativity ""daemons."""
402.039	Socrates, famously, believed
402.039	that he had a daemon
405.139	who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
407.596	The Romans had the same idea,
409.213	but they called that sort of disembodied
409.213	creative spirit a genius.
413.823	Which is great, because the Romans
413.823	did not actually think
416.562	that a genius was a particularly
416.562	clever individual.
419.356	They believed that a genius was this,
419.356	sort of magical divine entity,
423.039	who was believed to literally
423.039	live in the walls of an artist's studio,
428.361	kind of like Dobby the house elf,
430.905	and who would come out
432.443	and sort of invisibly assist
432.443	the artist with their work
435.069	and would shape the outcome of that work.
437.538	So brilliant -- there it is, right there,
437.538	that distance that I'm talking about --
441.42	that psychological construct to protect
441.42	you from the results of your work.
445.622	And everyone knew that this
445.622	is how it functioned, right?
449.23	So the ancient artist was protected
449.23	from certain things,
451.921	like, for example,
451.921	too much narcissism, right?
454.322	If your work was brilliant,
454.322	you couldn't take all the credit for it,
457.537	everybody knew that you had this
457.537	disembodied genius who had helped you.
461.256	If your work bombed,
461.256	not entirely your fault, you know?
464.625	Everyone knew your genius
464.625	was kind of lame.
467.143	(Laughter)
468.201	And this is how people
468.201	thought about creativity in the West
471.723	for a really long time.
473.055	And then the Renaissance came
473.055	and everything changed,
475.655	and we had this big idea,
475.655	and the big idea was,
477.97	let's put the individual human being
477.97	at the center of the universe
481.189	above all gods and mysteries,
482.754	and there's no more room
482.754	for mystical creatures
485.063	who take dictation from the divine.
486.855	And it's the beginning
486.855	of rational humanism,
488.99	and people started
488.99	to believe that creativity
491.157	came completely from the self
491.157	of the individual.
493.521	And for the first time in history,
495.371	you start to hear people referring
495.371	to this or that artist as being a genius,
500.482	rather than having a genius.
502.323	And I got to tell you,
502.323	I think that was a huge error.
505.647	You know, I think that allowing
505.647	somebody, one mere person
509.893	to believe that he or she is like,
509.893	the vessel,
512.656	you know, like the font
512.656	and the essence and the source
515.252	of all divine, creative,
515.252	unknowable, eternal mystery
518.605	is just a smidge too much responsibility
518.605	to put on one fragile, human psyche.
524.69	It's like asking somebody
524.69	to swallow the sun.
528.205	It just completely warps
528.205	and distorts egos,
530.856	and it creates all these unmanageable
530.856	expectations about performance.
534.406	And I think the pressure of that
536.405	has been killing off our artists
536.405	for the last 500 years.
539.622	And, if this is true,
542.287	and I think it is true,
543.873	the question becomes, what now?
546.738	Can we do this differently?
548.607	Maybe go back to some more
548.607	ancient understanding
552.003	about the relationship between humans
552.003	and the creative mystery.
556.504	Maybe not.
557.857	Maybe we can't just erase 500 years
557.857	of rational humanistic thought
561.739	in one 18 minute speech.
563.897	And there's probably
563.897	people in this audience
566.606	who would raise really
566.606	legitimate scientific suspicions
570.721	about the notion of, basically, fairies
573.1	who follow people around rubbing fairy
573.1	juice on their projects and stuff.
578.088	I'm not, probably, going to bring
578.088	you all along with me on this.
582.405	But the question
582.405	that I kind of want to pose is --
585.19	you know, why not?
587.387	Why not think about it this way?
589.309	Because it makes as much sense
589.309	as anything else I have ever heard
593.421	in terms of explaining
593.421	the utter maddening capriciousness
597.377	of the creative process.
598.922	A process which, as anybody
598.922	who has ever tried to make something --
602.137	which is to say basically
602.137	everyone here ---
604.227	knows does not always behave rationally.
607.338	And, in fact, can sometimes
607.338	feel downright paranormal.
611.921	I had this encounter recently
613.697	where I met the extraordinary
613.697	American poet Ruth Stone,
617.406	who's now in her 90s,
617.406	but she's been a poet her entire life
620.241	and she told me that when
620.241	she was growing up in rural Virginia,
623.471	she would be out working in the fields,
625.353	and she said she would feel
625.353	and hear a poem
628.229	coming at her from over the landscape.
630.236	And she said it was like
630.236	a thunderous train of air.
633.393	And it would come barreling down
633.393	at her over the landscape.
636.221	And she felt it coming, because it
636.221	would shake the earth under her feet.
639.723	She knew that she had
639.723	only one thing to do at that point,
642.522	and that was to,
642.522	"in her words, ""run like hell."""
644.773	And she would run like hell to the house
646.805	and she would be getting
646.805	chased by this poem,
648.991	and the whole deal was that she had
648.991	to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
652.621	fast enough so that when it thundered
652.621	through her, she could collect it
656.026	and grab it on the page.
657.232	And other times
657.232	she wouldn't be fast enough,
659.345	so she'd be running and running,
659.345	and she wouldn't get to the house
662.572	and the poem would barrel
662.572	through her and she would miss it
665.41	and she said it would continue
665.41	on across the landscape,
668.054	"looking, as she put it ""for another poet."""
670.162	And then there were these times --
671.832	this is the piece I never forgot --
673.711	she said that there were moments
673.711	where she would almost miss it, right?
677.193	So, she's running to the house
677.193	and she's looking for the paper
680.244	and the poem passes through her,
681.861	and she grabs a pencil just
681.861	as it's going through her,
684.495	and then she said, it was like
684.495	she would reach out with her other hand
687.863	and she would catch it.
689.17	She would catch the poem by its tail,
691.151	and she would pull it
691.151	backwards into her body
693.729	as she was transcribing on the page.
695.589	And in these instances, the poem would
695.589	come up on the page perfect and intact
700.444	but backwards, from the last
700.444	word to the first.
703.849	(Laughter)
705.561	So when I heard that I was like --
705.561	that's uncanny,
710.278	that's exactly what my creative
710.278	process is like.
712.779	(Laughter)
716.392	That's not at all what my creative
716.392	process is -- I'm not the pipeline!
719.758	I'm a mule, and the way
719.758	that I have to work
721.812	is I have to get up
721.812	at the same time every day,
724.079	and sweat and labor and barrel
724.079	through it really awkwardly.
726.913	But even I, in my mulishness,
728.776	even I have brushed
728.776	up against that thing, at times.
732.644	And I would imagine
732.644	that a lot of you have too.
734.907	You know, even I have had work
734.907	or ideas come through me from a source
738.212	that I honestly cannot identify.
740.723	And what is that thing?
742.319	And how are we to relate to it in a way
742.319	that will not make us lose our minds,
746.357	but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
749.243	And for me, the best contemporary
749.243	example that I have of how to do that
753.022	is the musician Tom Waits,
755.354	who I got to interview several years ago
755.354	on a magazine assignment.
759.895	And we were talking about this,
761.396	and you know, Tom, for most of his life,
761.396	he was pretty much the embodiment
764.957	of the tormented
764.957	contemporary modern artist,
767.077	trying to control and manage and dominate
769.404	these sort of uncontrollable
769.404	creative impulses
771.878	that were totally internalized.
773.765	But then he got older, he got calmer,
775.77	and one day he was driving down
775.77	the freeway in Los Angeles,
778.693	and this is when it all changed for him.
780.629	And he's speeding along,
780.629	and all of a sudden
782.719	he hears this little fragment of melody,
786.265	that comes into his head as inspiration
786.265	often comes, elusive and tantalizing,
790.294	and he wants it, it's gorgeous,
792.422	and he longs for it,
792.422	but he has no way to get it.
794.747	He doesn't have a piece of paper,
794.747	or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
797.922	So he starts to feel all of that old
797.922	anxiety start to rise in him
801.006	"like, ""I'm going to lose this thing,"
802.771	and I'll be be haunted
802.771	by this song forever.
804.891	"I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."""
806.82	And instead of panicking, he just stopped.
808.854	He just stopped that whole mental process
808.854	and he did something completely novel.
812.996	He just looked up at the sky, and he said,
815.479	"""Excuse me, can you not"
815.479	"see that I'm driving?"""
818.493	(Laughter)
822.194	"""Do I look like I can write"
822.194	down a song right now?
824.928	If you really want to exist,
824.928	come back at a more opportune moment
828.773	when I can take care of you.
830.435	Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
833.512	"Go bother Leonard Cohen."""
836.808	And his whole work process
836.808	changed after that.
839.94	Not the work, the work was still
839.94	oftentimes as dark as ever.
843.548	But the process, and the heavy
843.548	anxiety around it
846.607	was released when he took
846.607	the genie, the genius out of him
849.554	where it was causing nothing but trouble,
849.554	and released it back where it came from,
853.465	and realized that this didn't have to be
853.465	this internalized, tormented thing.
857.126	It could be this peculiar,
857.126	wondrous, bizarre collaboration,
860.264	kind of conversation between
860.264	Tom and the strange, external thing
864.396	that was not quite Tom.
866.629	When I heard that story,
866.629	it started to shift a little bit
869.336	the way that I worked too,
869.336	and this idea already saved me once.
872.365	It saved me when I was in the middle
872.365	"of writing ""Eat, Pray, Love,"""
875.493	and I fell into one of those
875.493	sort of pits of despair
878.026	that we all fall into when we're working
878.026	on something and it's not coming
881.506	and you start to think this is going to be
881.506	a disaster, the worst book ever written.
885.69	Not just bad, but the worst
885.69	book ever written.
888.064	And I started to think I should
888.064	just dump this project.
891.479	But then I remembered Tom
891.479	talking to the open air
894.554	and I tried it.
896.602	So I just lifted my face
896.602	up from the manuscript
899.094	and I directed my comments
899.094	to an empty corner of the room.
902.024	"And I said aloud, ""Listen you, thing,"
905.602	you and I both know
905.602	that if this book isn't brilliant
908.8	that is not entirely my fault, right?
910.601	Because you can see that I am putting
910.601	everything I have into this,
913.857	I don't have any more than this.
915.496	If you want it to be better, you've got
915.496	to show up and do your part of the deal.
919.305	But if you don't do that,
919.305	you know what, the hell with it.
922.146	I'm going to keep writing anyway
922.146	because that's my job.
924.852	And I would please
924.852	like the record to reflect today
927.312	"that I showed up for my part of the job."""
929.334	(Laughter)
932.349	Because --
934.436	(Applause)
936.51	Because in the end it's like this, OK --
938.682	centuries ago in the deserts
938.682	of North Africa,
941.083	people used to gather for these moonlight
941.083	dances of sacred dance and music
945.75	that would go on for hours
945.75	and hours, until dawn.
948.454	They were always magnificent,
948.454	because the dancers were professionals
951.698	and they were terrific, right?
953.152	But every once in a while, very rarely,
953.152	something would happen,
956.473	and one of these performers
956.473	would actually become transcendent.
959.985	And I know you know
959.985	what I'm talking about,
962.269	because I know you've all seen,
962.269	at some point in your life,
965.089	a performance like this.
966.389	It was like time would stop,
968.318	and the dancer would sort of step
968.318	through some kind of portal
971.247	and he wasn't doing anything different
973.151	than he had ever done,
973.151	1,000 nights before,
975.184	but everything would align.
976.935	And all of a sudden, he would
976.935	no longer appear to be merely human.
980.102	He would be lit from within,
980.102	and lit from below
982.501	and all lit up on fire with divinity.
986.291	And when this happened, back then,
988.436	people knew it for what it was,
988.436	you know, they called it by its name.
992.652	They would put their hands together
992.652	and they would start to chant,
995.819	"""Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."""
999.384	That's God, you know.
1002.486	Curious historical footnote:
1005.166	when the Moors invaded southern Spain,
1005.166	they took this custom with them
1010.007	and the pronunciation
1010.007	changed over the centuries
1012.317	"from ""Allah, Allah, Allah,"""
1012.317	"to ""Olé, olé, olé,"""
1015.117	which you still hear in bullfights
1015.117	and in flamenco dances.
1018.291	In Spain, when a performer has done
1018.291	something impossible and magic,
1021.944	"""Allah, olé, olé, Allah,"
1021.944	"magnificent, bravo,"""
1025.093	incomprehensible, there it is
1025.093	-- a glimpse of God.
1028.547	Which is great, because we need that.
1030.669	But, the tricky bit
1030.669	comes the next morning,
1034.52	for the dancer himself,
1034.52	when he wakes up and discovers
1037.947	that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m.,
1037.947	and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
1041.394	He's just an aging mortal
1041.394	with really bad knees,
1044.886	and maybe he's never going
1044.886	to ascend to that height again.
1049.126	And maybe nobody will ever chant
1049.126	God's name again as he spins,
1052.853	and what is he then to do
1052.853	with the rest of his life?
1055.711	This is hard.
1057.093	This is one of the most painful
1057.093	reconciliations to make
1059.935	in a creative life.
1062.026	But maybe it doesn't have to be
1062.026	quite so full of anguish
1065.209	if you never happened
1065.209	to believe, in the first place,
1068.476	that the most extraordinary aspects
1068.476	of your being came from you.
1072.581	But maybe if you just believed
1072.581	that they were on loan to you
1075.442	from some unimaginable source
1075.442	for some exquisite portion of your life
1079.05	to be passed along when you're finished,
1081.09	with somebody else.
1082.941	And, you know, if we think about it
1082.941	this way, it starts to change everything.
1087.746	This is how I've started to think,
1089.61	and this is certainly how I've been
1089.61	thinking in the last few months
1092.959	as I've been working on the book
1092.959	that will soon be published,
1095.888	as the dangerously, frighteningly
1095.888	over-anticipated follow up
1099.443	to my freakish success.
1102.103	And what I have to
1102.103	sort of keep telling myself
1105.026	when I get really psyched out
1105.026	about that is don't be afraid.
1109.226	Don't be daunted. Just do your job.
1112.575	Continue to show up for your piece of it,
1112.575	whatever that might be.
1115.695	If your job is to dance, do your dance.
1118.46	If the divine, cockeyed genius
1118.46	assigned to your case
1122.425	decides to let some sort of wonderment
1122.425	be glimpsed, for just one moment
1127.509	"through your efforts, then ""Olé!"""
1130.213	And if not, do your dance anyhow.
1133.148	"And ""Olé!"" to you, nonetheless."
1134.829	I believe this and I feel
1134.829	that we must teach it.
1137.139	"""Olé!"" to you, nonetheless,"
1138.617	just for having the sheer
1138.617	human love and stubbornness
1141.93	to keep showing up.
1143.775	Thank you.
1145.45	(Applause)
1147.525	Thank you.
1149.016	(Applause)
1152.13	June Cohen: Olé!
1153.963	(Applause)
