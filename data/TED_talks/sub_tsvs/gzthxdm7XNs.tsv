13.527	Something happened in the early morning hours
16.315	of May 2nd, 2000, that had a profound effect
19.9	on the way our society operates.
22.206	Ironically, hardly anyone noticed at the time.
25.484	The change was silent, imperceptible,
28.144	unless you knew exactly what to look for.
30.989	On that morning, U.S. President Bill Clinton
33.34	ordered that a special switch be thrown
35.612	in the orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System.
39.045	Instantaneously, every civilian GPS receiver
42.909	around the globe went from errors the size of a football field
47.471	to errors the size of a small room.
54.314	It's hard to overstate the effect that this change
58.105	in accuracy has had on us.
60.657	Before this switch was thrown, we didn't have
62.904	in-car navigation systems giving turn-by-turn
65.163	directions, because back then, GPS couldn't tell you
67.755	what block you were on, let alone what street.
70.449	For geolocation, accuracy matters,
73.697	and things have only improved over the last 10 years.
76.955	With more base stations, more ground stations,
79.074	better receivers and better algorithms,
82.043	GPS can now not only tell you what street you are on,
85.106	but what part of the street.
89.608	This level of accuracy
91.854	has unleashed a firestorm of innovation.
94.78	In fact, many of you navigated here today
97.451	with the help of your TomTom or your smartphone.
101.044	Paper maps are becoming obsolete.
104.269	But we now stand on the verge of another revolution
108.408	in geolocation accuracy.
110.403	What if I told you that the two-meter positioning
113.136	that our current cell phones and our TomToms give us
116.567	is pathetic compared to what we could be getting?
120.464	For some time now, it's been known that if you pay attention
123.297	to the carrier phase of the GPS signal,
125.832	and if you have an Internet connection,
128.313	then you can go from meter level to centimeter level,
131.129	even millimeter-level positioning.
134.096	So why don't we have this capability on our phones?
137.376	Only, I believe, for a lack of imagination.
141.746	Manufacturers haven't built this carrier phase technique
144.913	into their cheap GPS chips
147.019	because they're not sure what the general public would do
149.173	with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint
152.749	the wrinkles in the palm of your hand.
156.587	But you and I and other innovators,
158.974	we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy.
163.014	Imagine, for example, an augmented reality app
165.726	that overlays a virtual world to millimeter-level precision
169.263	on top of the physical world.
171.271	I could build for you a structure up here in 3D,
174.158	millimeter accurate, that only you could see,
176.526	or my friends at home.
179.419	So this level of positioning, this is what we're looking for,
183.934	and I believe that, within the next few years, I predict,
187.858	that this kind of hyper-precise, carrier phase-based positioning
192.841	will become cheap and ubiquitous,
196.065	and the consequences will be fantastic.
198.61	The Holy Grail, of course, is the GPS dot.
203.266	"Do you remember the movie ""The Da Vinci Code?"""
205.946	Here's Professor Langdon examining a GPS dot,
209.394	which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device
212.771	accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe,
215.832	but we know that in the world of nonfiction,
218.738	the GPS dot is impossible, right?
221.602	For one thing, GPS doesn't work indoors,
224.226	and for another, they don't make devices quite this small,
227.41	especially when those devices have to relay
229.738	their measurements back over a network.
232.713	Well, these objections were perfectly reasonable
235.051	a few years ago, but things have changed.
238.065	There's been a strong trend toward miniaturization,
240.921	better sensitivity, so much so that, a few years ago,
244.64	a GPS tracking device looked like this clunky box
247.344	to the left of the keys.
249.52	Compare that with the device released just months ago
252.171	that's now packaged into something the size of a key fob,
255.963	and if you take a look at the state of the art
258.516	for a complete GPS receiver, which is only a centimeter
261.262	on a side and more sensitive than ever,
263.349	you realize that the GPS dot will soon move
266.858	from fiction to nonfiction.
271.257	Imagine what we could do with a world full of GPS dots.
275.499	It's not just that you'll never lose your wallet or your keys
278.405	anymore, or your child when you're at Disneyland.
282.976	You'll buy GPS dots in bulk, and you'll stick them on
286.757	everything you own worth more than a few tens of dollars.
290.724	I couldn't find my shoes one recent morning,
293.196	and, as usual, had to ask my wife if she had seen them.
296.564	But I shouldn't have to bother my wife with that kind of triviality.
300.356	I should be able to ask my house where my shoes are.
302.967	(Laughter)
305.106	Those of you who have made the switch to Gmail,
308.614	remember how refreshing it was to go from
311.492	organizing all of your email to simply searching it.
315.636	The GPS dot will do the same for our possessions.
320.138	Now, of course, there is a flip side to the GPS dot.
324.824	I was in my office some months back
327.213	and got a telephone call.
329.756	The woman on the other end of the line, we'll call her Carol,
333.377	was panicked.
335.456	Apparently, an ex-boyfriend of Carol's from California
338.249	had found her in Texas and was following her around.
341.564	So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.
345.401	Well, so did I.
346.8	But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.
350.791	Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up,
353.525	at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations,
357.875	he was carrying an open laptop,
360.571	and over time Carol realized that he had planted
363.414	a GPS tracking device on her car,
365.962	so she was calling me for help to disable it.
368.871	"""Well, you should go to a good mechanic"
370.859	"and have him look at your car,"" I said."
374.143	"""I already have,"" she told me."
376.847	"""He didn't see anything obvious,"
378.991	"and he said he'd have to take the car apart piece by piece."""
382.528	"""Well then, you'd better go to the police,"" I said."
385.849	"""I already have,"" she replied."
388.953	"""They're not sure this rises to the level of harassment,"
391.399	"and they're not set up technically to find the device."""
395.152	"""Okay, what about the FBI?"""
396.658	"""I've talked to them too, and same story."""
400.821	We then talked about her coming to my lab
402.491	and us performing a radio sweep of her car,
405.039	but I wasn't even sure that would work,
407.538	given that some of these devices are configured
409.589	to only transmit when they're inside safe zones
411.823	or when the car is moving.
415.127	So, there we were.
416.621	Carol isn't the first, and certainly won't be the last,
419.59	to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment,
424.525	worrisome situation caused by GPS tracking.
430.41	In fact, as I looked into her case,
432.213	I discovered to my surprise that it's not clearly illegal
435.675	for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else's car.
440.108	The Supreme Court ruled last month that a policeman
443.988	has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged tracking,
448.32	but the law isn't clear about civilians doing this to one another,
451.836	so it's not just Big Brother we have to worry about,
454.466	but Big Neighbor. (Laughter)
457.737	There is one alternative that Carol could have taken,
462.385	very effective. It's called the Wave Bubble.
468.088	It's an open-source GPS jammer,
471.023	developed by Limor Fried,
473.578	a graduate student at MIT, and Limor calls it
477.371	"""a tool for reclaiming our personal space."""
481.256	With a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you
483.521	within which GPS signals can't reside.
485.768	They get drowned out by the bubble.
488.124	And Limor designed this, in part, because, like Carol,
491.771	she felt threatened by GPS tracking.
494.417	Then she posted her design to the web,
496.993	and if you don't have time to build your own,
500.735	you can buy one.
501.509	Chinese manufacturers now sell thousands
503.567	of nearly identical devices on the Internet.
507.34	So you might be thinking, the Wave Bubble sounds great.
511.492	I should have one. Might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car.
515.145	But you should be aware that its use is very much illegal
518.927	in the United States.
520.726	And why is that?
521.473	Well, because it's not a bubble at all.
524.566	Its jamming signals don't stop at the edge
526.965	of your personal space or at the edge of your car.
529.437	They go on to jam innocent GPS receivers for miles around you. (Laughter)
535.673	Now, if you're Carol or Limor,
538.424	or someone who feels threatened by GPS tracking,
541.049	it might not feel wrong to turn on a Wave Bubble,
544.824	but in fact, the results can be disastrous.
548.804	Imagine, for example, you're the captain of a cruise ship
551.524	trying to make your way through a thick fog
554.043	and some passenger in the back turns on a Wave Bubble.
557.883	All of a sudden your GPS readout goes blank,
560.598	and now it's just you and the fog
563.884	and whatever you can pull off the radar system
566.484	if you remember how to work it.
569.608	They -- in fact, they don't update or upkeep lighthouses
575.544	anymore, and LORAN, the only backup to GPS,
580.197	was discontinued last year.
582.617	Our modern society has a special relationship with GPS.
587.53	We're almost blindly reliant on it.
589.8	It's built deeply into our systems and infrastructure.
593.451	"Some call it ""the invisible utility."""
597.079	So, turning on a Wave Bubble might not just cause inconvenience.
600.801	It might be deadly.
605.171	But as it turns out, for purposes of protecting your privacy
609.379	at the expense of general GPS reliability,
612.868	there's something even more potent
615.028	and more subversive than a Wave Bubble,
618.82	and that is a GPS spoofer.
622.209	The idea behind the GPS spoofer is simple.
625.034	Instead of jamming the GPS signals, you fake them.
629.011	You imitate them, and if you do it right, the device
632.129	you're attacking doesn't even know it's being spoofed.
635.296	So let me show you how this works.
636.928	In any GPS receiver, there's a peak inside
639.653	that corresponds to the authentic signals.
642.288	These three red dots represent the tracking points
645.103	that try to keep themselves centered on that peak.
647.982	But if you send in a fake GPS signal,
651.047	another peak pops up, and if you can get these two peaks
655.513	perfectly aligned, the tracking points can't tell the difference,
660.231	and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal,
663.542	with the authentic peak getting forced off.
667.502	At this point, the game is over.
669.669	The fake signals now completely control this GPS receiver.
673.406	So is this really possible?
674.901	Can someone really manipulate
676.624	the timing and positioning of a GPS receiver
678.606	just like that, with a spoofer?
681.485	Well, the short answer is yes.
683.5	The key is that civil GPS signals
686.304	are completely open.
687.406	They have no encryption. They have no authentication.
691.397	They're wide open, vulnerable to a kind of spoofing attack.
694.892	Even so, up until very recently,
697.467	nobody worried about GPS spoofers.
699.859	People figured that it would be too complex
701.837	or too expensive for some hacker to build one.
704.652	But I, and a friend of mine from graduate school,
708.604	we didn't see it that way.
710.756	We knew it wasn't going to be so hard,
713.229	and we wanted to be the first to build one
715.157	so we could get out in front of the problem
717.237	and help protect against GPS spoofing.
721.343	I remember vividly the week it all came together.
724.688	We built it at my home, which means that
728.137	I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.
732.526	Here's Ramon — (Laughter) —
734.944	looking for a little attention from Dad that week.
738.629	At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables
740.899	and computers, though we eventually got it packaged
743.781	into a small box.
745.453	Now, the Dr. Frankenstein moment,
748.262	when the spoofer finally came alive
750.989	and I glimpsed its awful potential,
753.59	came late one night when I tested the spoofer
756.326	against my iPhone.
758.412	Let me show you some actual footage from that
760.029	very first experiment.
761.965	I had come to completely trust this little blue dot
765.559	and its reassuring blue halo.
767.194	They seemed to speak to me.
768.269	"They'd say, ""Here you are. Here you are."" (Laughter)"
772.929	"And ""you can trust us."""
775.799	So something felt very wrong about the world.
780.917	It was a sense, almost, of betrayal,
783.5	when this little blue dot started at my house,
787.691	and went running off toward the north
789.303	leaving me behind. I wasn't moving.
793.198	What I then saw in this little moving blue dot
797.431	was the potential for chaos.
800.149	I saw airplanes and ships veering off course, with the captain
804.291	learning only too late that something was wrong.
808.565	I saw the GPS-derived timing
811.065	of the New York Stock Exchange
812.796	being manipulated by hackers.
814.746	You can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc
817.714	you could cause if you knew what you were doing
820.364	with a GPS spoofer.
823.717	There is, though, one redeeming feature
828.861	of the GPS spoofer.
831.317	It's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of GPS dots.
835.918	Imagine, for example, you're being tracked.
839.005	Well, you can play the tracker for a fool,
841.529	pretending to be at work when you're really on vacation.
844.49	Or, if you're Carol, you could lure your ex-boyfriend
847.205	into some empty parking lot
848.522	where the police are waiting for him.
850.823	So I'm fascinated by this conflict, a looming conflict,
856.026	between privacy on the one hand
858.691	and the need for a clean radio spectrum on the other.
862.89	We simply cannot tolerate GPS jammers and spoofers,
865.935	and yet, given the lack of effective legal means
869.671	for protecting our privacy from the GPS dot,
873.77	can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on,
875.642	for wanting to use them?
878.058	I hold out hope that we'll be able to reconcile
881.111	this conflict with some sort of,
884.297	some yet uninvented technology.
889.727	But meanwhile, grab some popcorn,
892.853	because things are going to get interesting.
894.98	Within the next few years,
896.32	many of you will be the proud owner of a GPS dot.
900.574	Maybe you'll have a whole bag full of them.
902.922	You'll never lose track of your things again.
906.374	The GPS dot will fundamentally reorder your life.
910.403	But will you be able to resist the temptation
913.085	to track your fellow man?
916.077	Or will you be able to resist the temptation
917.909	to turn on a GPS spoofer or a Wave Bubble
921.204	to protect your own privacy?
923.972	So, as usual, what we see just beyond the horizon
927.604	is full of promise and peril.
930.944	It'll be fascinating to see how this all turns out.
934.132	Thanks. (Applause)
