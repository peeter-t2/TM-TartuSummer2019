12.546	I was in New York during Hurricane Sandy,
14.793	and this little white dog called Maui
17.033	was staying with me.
18.918	Half the city was dark because of a power cut,
21.39	and I was living on the dark side.
23.614	Now, Maui was terrified of the dark,
25.723	so I had to carry him up the stairs,
27.827	actually down the stairs first, for his walk,
30.915	and then bring him back up.
32.803	I was also hauling gallons of bottles of water
35.784	up to the seventh floor every day.
37.883	And through all of this,
39.456	I had to hold a torch between my teeth.
41.76	The stores nearby were out of flashlights
44.404	and batteries and bread.
47.341	For a shower, I walked 40 blocks
50.004	to a branch of my gym.
51.978	But these were not the major preoccupations of my day.
55.057	It was just as critical for me to be the first person in
58.358	at a cafe nearby with extension cords and chargers
61.65	to juice my multiple devices.
63.499	I started to prospect under the benches of bakeries
66.224	and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points.
69.849	I wasn't the only one.
71.418	Even in the rain, people stood between Madison and 5th Avenue
75.182	under their umbrellas charging their cell phones
77.646	from outlets on the street.
79.683	Nature had just reminded us
81.94	that it was stronger than all our technology,
84.256	and yet here we were, obsessed about being wired.
87.525	I think there's nothing like a crisis
89.401	to tell you what's really important and what's not,
92.59	and Sandy made me realize that our devices
96.152	and their connectivity matter to us
98.418	right up there with food and shelter.
102.936	The self as we once knew it no longer exists,
106.253	and I think that an abstract, digital universe
108.745	has become a part of our identity,
111.27	and I want to talk to you about what I think that means.
115.522	I'm a novelist, and I'm interested in the self
118.365	because the self and fiction have a lot in common.
120.834	They're both stories, interpretations.
124.151	You and I can experience things without a story.
126.604	We might run up the stairs too quickly
128.686	and we might get breathless.
130.373	But the larger sense that we have of our lives,
132.903	the slightly more abstract one, is indirect.
136.263	Our story of our life is based on direct experience,
139.383	but it's embellished.
141.277	A novel needs scene after scene to build,
144.125	and the story of our life needs an arc as well.
147.273	It needs months and years.
149.964	Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
152.982	But the story is not about these chapters.
155.572	It's the whole book.
157.517	It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness,
160.86	the victories and the disappointments,
163.039	but it's because how because of these,
165.244	and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these,
168.397	we find our place in the world
170.492	and we change it and we change ourselves.
173.572	Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time:
176.965	a long arc of time that is our lifespan,
179.98	and the timeframe of direct experience
182.483	that is the moment.
183.936	Now the self that experiences directly
186.066	can only exist in the moment,
187.967	but the one that narrates needs several moments,
190.729	a whole sequence of them,
192.843	and that's why our full sense of self
195.088	needs both immersive experience
198.02	and the flow of time.
200.465	Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything,
203.614	in the erosion of a grain of sand,
206.182	in the budding of a little bud into a rose.
209.974	Without it, we would have no music.
212.509	Our own emotions and state of mind
214.547	often encode time,
216.66	regret or nostalgia about the past,
219.218	hope or dread about the future.
222.718	I think that technology has altered that flow of time.
226.663	The overall time that we have for our narrative,
229.186	our lifespan, has been increasing,
231.36	but the smallest measure, the moment, has shrunk.
234.477	It has shrunk because our instruments enable us
236.813	in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time,
240.073	and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding
243.343	of the material world,
245.216	and this granular understanding
246.652	has generated reams of data
248.955	that our brains can no longer comprehend
251.316	and for which we need more and more complicated computers.
254.751	All of this to say that the gap
257.025	between what we can perceive and what we can measure
259.606	is only going to widen.
261.528	Science can do things with and in a picosecond,
264.564	but you and I are never going to have the inner experience
267.267	of a millionth of a millionth of a second.
270.453	You and I answer only to nature's rhythm and flow,
274.495	to the sun, the moon and the seasons,
277.434	and this is why we need that long arc of time
280.174	with the past, the present and the future
282.403	to see things for what they are,
284.167	to separate signal from noise
286.01	and the self from sensations.
288.566	We need time's arrow to understand cause and effect,
292.175	not just in the material world,
293.93	but in our own intentions and our motivations.
297.22	What happens when that arrow goes awry?
301.21	What happens when time warps?
304.694	So many of us today have the sensation
306.643	that time's arrow is pointing everywhere
308.887	and nowhere at once.
311.152	This is because time doesn't flow in the digital world
313.839	in the same way that it does in the natural one.
317.828	We all know that the Internet has shrunk space
320.528	as well as time.
321.758	Far away over there is now here.
324.071	News from India is a stream on my smartphone app
326.8	whether I'm in New York or New Delhi.
329.679	And that's not all.
331.114	Your last job, your dinner reservations from last year,
333.583	your former friends, lie on a flat plain with today's friends,
336.859	because the Internet also archives,
338.994	and it warps the past.
340.788	With no distinction left between the past,
342.938	the present and the future, and the here or there,
346.21	we are left with this moment everywhere,
350.026	this moment that I'll call the digital now.
352.45	Just how can we prioritize
354.618	in the landscape of the digital now?
356.977	This digital now is not the present,
358.882	because it's always a few seconds ahead,
360.935	with Twitter streams that are already trending
362.768	and news from other time zones.
364.745	This isn't the now of a shooting pain in your foot
367.455	or the second that you bite into a pastry
369.943	or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book.
373.28	This now bears very little physical
375.132	or psychological reference to our own state.
378.073	Its focus, instead, is to distract us
380.333	at every turn on the road.
382.283	Every digital landmark is an invitation
384.454	to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else
386.869	and do something else.
388.488	Are you reading an interview by an author?
390.481	Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
393.121	Like it. Find other books exactly like his.
395.85	Find other people reading those books.
398.718	Travel can be liberating,
400.762	but when it is incessant, we become
402.523	permanent exiles without repose.
404.75	Choice is freedom, but not when it's constantly
407.494	for its own sake.
409.541	Not just is the digital now far from the present,
412.129	but it's in direct competition with it,
414.791	and this is because not just am I absent from it,
417.173	but so are you.
418.266	Not just are we absent from it, but so is everyone else.
421.057	And therein lies its greatest convenience and horror.
424.747	I can order foreign language books in the middle of the night,
427.575	shop for Parisian macarons,
429.374	and leave video messages that get picked up later.
431.831	At all times, I can operate
433.806	at a different rhythm and pace from you,
436.042	while I sustain the illusion
437.959	that I'm tapped into you in real time.
441.487	Sandy was a reminder
443.096	of how such an illusion can shatter.
445.201	There were those with power and water,
447.065	and those without.
448.561	There are those who went back to their lives,
450.894	and those who are still displaced
452.931	after so many months.
455.286	For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate
457.988	the illusion for those who have it that everyone does,
461.434	and then, like an ironic slap in the face,
464.062	it makes it true.
466.18	For example, it's said that there are more people
467.857	in India with access to cell phones than toilets.
470.991	Now if this rift, which is already so great
473.413	in many parts of the world,
474.875	between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology,
478.23	isn't somehow bridged,
479.812	there will be ruptures between the digital
481.863	and the real.
484.038	For us as individuals who live in the digital now
487.676	and spend most of our waking moments in it,
490.155	the challenge is to live in two streams of time
492.332	that are parallel and almost simultaneous.
495.276	How does one live inside distraction?
499.376	We might think that those younger than us,
501.326	those who are born into this, will adapt more naturally.
504.94	Possibly, but I remember my childhood.
508.078	I remember my grandfather revising
509.782	the capitals of the world with me.
512.044	Buda and Pest were separated by the Danube,
514.794	and Vienna had a Spanish riding school.
517.569	If I were a child today, I could easily learn this information
520.468	with apps and hyperlinks,
522.633	but it really wouldn't be the same,
524.544	because much later, I went to Vienna,
526.824	and I went to the Spanish riding school,
528.792	and I could feel my grandfather right beside me.
532.157	Night after night, he took me up on the terrace,
534.727	on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter
537.505	and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
540.733	And even here, when I look at the Great Bear,
543.428	I get back that feeling of being a child,
546.184	hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself
548.562	on his shoulder,
550.782	and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
553.982	What I had with my grandfather was wrapped
556.449	so often in information and knowledge and fact,
559.691	but it was about so much more
561.715	than information or knowledge or fact.
565.505	Time-warping technology challenges
567.629	our deepest core,
569.581	because we are able to archive the past
573.348	and some of it becomes hard to forget,
576.589	even as the current moment
579.193	is increasingly unmemorable.
581.812	We want to clutch, and we are left instead
584.552	clutching at a series of static moments.
587.015	They're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them.
589.721	By archiving everything, we think that we can store it,
592.514	but time is not data.
594.479	It cannot be stored.
596.612	You and I know exactly what it means like
598.628	to be truly present in a moment.
600.532	It might have happened while we were
601.749	playing an instrument,
603.508	or looking into the eyes of someone we've known
605.356	for a very long time.
607.54	At such moments, our selves are complete.
610.571	The self that lives in the long narrative arc
612.639	and the self that experiences the moment
614.722	become one.
616.114	The present encapsulates the past
618.056	and a promise for the future.
620.487	The present joins a flow of time
622.455	from before and after.
624.698	I first experienced these feelings with my grandmother.
628.255	I wanted to learn to skip, and she found an old rope
630.594	and she tucked up her sari
631.946	and she jumped over it.
633.674	I wanted to learn to cook, and she kept me in the kitchen,
636.328	cutting, cubing and chopping for a whole month.
640.436	My grandmother taught me that things happen
642.843	in the time they take, that time can't be fought,
646.564	and because it will pass and it will move,
648.397	we owe the present moment our full attention.
651.511	Attention is time.
654.155	One of my yoga instructors once said
656.338	that love is attention,
658.581	and definitely from my grandmother,
660.415	love and attention were one and the same thing.
664.741	The digital world cannibalizes time,
667.324	and in doing so, I want to suggest
670.704	that what it threatens
672.378	is the completeness of ourselves.
674.808	It threatens the flow of love.
677.166	But we don't need to let it.
679.187	We can choose otherwise.
680.655	We've seen again and again
682.732	just how creative technology can be,
684.962	and in our lives and in our actions,
687.202	we can choose those solutions and those innovations
691.191	and those moments that restore the flow of time
694.299	instead of fragmenting it.
697.92	We can slow down and we can tune in
700.5	to the ebb and flow of time.
703.172	We can choose to take time back.
707.12	Thank you.
709.32	(Applause)
