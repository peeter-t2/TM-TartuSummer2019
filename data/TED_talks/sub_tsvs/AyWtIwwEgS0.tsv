13.734	Guys, we have an issue.
16.294	(Laughter)
17.416	Growth is fading away,
17.416	and it's a big deal.
21.136	Our global economy stops growing.
24.018	And it's not new.
25.441	Growth has actually declined
25.441	for the last 50 years.
29.213	If we continue like this, we need to learn
31.777	how to live in a world
31.777	with no growth in the next decade.
36.249	This is scary because
36.249	when the economy doesn't grow,
39.75	our children don't get better lives.
42.535	What's even scarier is that
42.535	when the pie does not grow,
45.972	each of us get a smaller piece.
47.552	We're then ready to fight
47.552	for a bigger one.
50.07	This creates tensions
50.07	and serious conflicts.
53.585	Growth matters a lot.
57.35	If we look at the history of growth,
59.662	times of big growth
59.662	have always been fueled
62.198	by big manufacturing revolutions.
64.818	It happened three times,
64.818	every 50-60 years.
68.419	The steam engine
68.419	in the middle of the 19th century,
72.467	the mass-production model
72.467	in the beginning of the 20th century --
76.252	thanks, Mr. Ford.
78.384	And the first automation
78.384	wave in the 1970s.
82.157	Why did these manufacturing revolutions
84.377	create huge growth in our economies?
87.677	Because they have injected
87.677	huge productivity improvement.
91.591	It's rather simple:
93.08	in order to grow,
93.08	you need to be producing more,
96.339	putting more into our economy.
99.241	This means either more labor
99.241	or more capital or more productivity.
104.877	Each time, productivity
104.877	has been the growth lever.
109.744	I'm here today to tell you
112.511	that we are on the verge
112.511	of another huge change,
116.245	and that this change, surprisingly enough,
119.731	is going to come
119.731	from manufacturing, again.
123.394	It will get us out of our growth slump
126.526	and it will change radically
126.526	the way globalization has been shaped
130.394	over the last decade.
131.935	I'm here to tell you about the amazing
131.935	fourth manufacturing revolution
137.23	that is currently underway.
139.213	It's not as if we've done nothing
139.213	with manufacturing
141.698	since the last revolution.
143.011	Actually, we've made
143.011	some pretty lame attempts
145.45	to try to revitalize it.
147.075	But none of them
147.075	have been the big overhaul
150.076	we really need to get us growing again.
152.384	For example, we've tried
152.384	to relocate our factories offshore
157.002	in order to reduce cost
157.002	and take advantage of cheap labor.
161.048	Not only did this not
161.048	inspire productivity,
164.655	but it only saved money
164.655	for a short period of time,
167.151	because cheap labor
167.151	didn't stay cheap for long.
170.455	Then, we've tried to make
170.455	our factories larger
174.401	and we specialized them by product.
177.318	The idea was that we can
177.318	make a lot of one product
180.655	and stockpile it to be sold with demand.
184.022	This did help productivity for a while.
186.625	But it introduced a lot of rigidities
186.625	in our supply chain.
191.432	Let's take fashion retail.
193.232	Traditional clothing companies
195.374	have built offshore,
195.374	global, rigid supply chains.
200.787	When fast-fashion competitors like Zara
203.562	started replenishing their stocks faster
206.097	from two collections a year
206.097	to one collection a month,
209.8	none of them have been able
209.8	to keep up with the pace.
212.368	Most of them are
212.368	in great difficulties today.
216.008	Yet, with all of their shortcomings,
219.236	those are the factories we know today.
221.539	When you open the doors,
223.181	they look the same
223.181	as they did 50 years ago.
226.396	We've just changed the location,
226.396	the size, the way they operate.
232.273	Can you name anything else
232.273	that looks the same
234.641	as it did 50 years ago?
236.22	It's crazy.
237.836	We've made all the tweaks
237.836	to the model that we could,
240.892	and now we hit its limits.
245.032	After all of our attempts to fix
245.032	the manufacturing model failed,
249.893	we thought growth could come
249.893	from elsewhere.
252.722	We turned to the tech sector --
254.786	there's been quite a lot
254.786	of innovations there.
257.178	Just to name one: the Internet.
259.906	We hoped it could produce growth.
261.735	And indeed, it changed our lives.
264.251	It made big waves in the media,
264.251	the service, the entertainment spaces.
269.081	But it hasn't done much for productivity.
272.011	Actually, what's surprising
272.011	is that productivity is on the decline
276.331	despite all of those innovation efforts.
279.523	Imagine that -- sitting at work,
279.523	scrolling through Facebook,
283.305	watching videos on YouTube
283.305	has made us less productive.
287.133	Weird.
288.308	(Laughter)
289.916	This is why we are not growing.
292.58	We failed at reinventing
292.58	the manufacturing space,
295.88	and large technological innovations
295.88	have played away from it.
301.184	But what if we could combine those forces?
303.927	What if the existing manufacturing
303.927	and large technological innovation
308.819	came together to create
308.819	the next big manufacturing reinvention.
313.406	Bingo!
314.688	This is the fourth
314.688	manufacturing revolution,
317.195	and it's happening right now.
319.355	Major technologies are entering
319.355	the manufacturing space,
322.645	big time.
324.316	They will boost industrial productivity
324.316	by more than a third.
328.217	This is massive, and it will do
328.217	a lot in creating growth.
333.286	Let me tell you about some of them.
336.091	Have you already met advanced
336.091	manufacturing robots?
339.583	They are the size of humans,
341.702	they actually collaborate with them,
343.747	and they can be programmed
345.35	in order to perform
345.35	complex, non-repetitive tasks.
349.628	Today in our factories, only
349.628	8 percent of the tasks are automated.
354.59	The less complex,
354.59	the more repetitive ones.
358.551	It will be 25 percent in 10 years.
361.452	It means that by 2025,
364.289	advanced robots will complement workers
366.877	to be, together,
369.744	to manufacture 20 percent more outputs,
371.769	to achieve 20 percent additional growth.
375.118	This isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.
378.425	These robots are working for us right now.
381.993	Last year in the US, they helped
381.993	Amazon prepare and ship all the products
387.563	required for Cyber Monday,
389.681	the annual peak of online retail.
392.401	Last year in the US,
394.049	it was the biggest online shopping day
394.049	of the year and of history.
400.626	Consumers spent 3 billion dollars
400.626	on electronics that day.
404.276	That's real economic growth.
407.502	Then there's additive
407.502	manufacturing, 3D printing.
411.574	3D printing has already improved
411.574	plastic manufacturing
415.606	and it's now making its way through metal.
418.614	Those are not small industries.
420.875	Plastic and metals represent 25 percent
423.915	of global manufacturing production.
426.717	Let's take a real example.
429.005	In the aerospace industry,
431.967	fuel nozzles are some of the most
431.967	complex parts to manufacture,
436.484	for one reason:
437.806	they are made up of 20 different parts
441.019	that need to be separately produced
443.854	and then painstakingly assembled.
447.301	Aerospace companies
447.301	are now using 3D printing,
450.451	which allows them to turn
450.451	those 20 different parts
453.539	into just one.
455.368	The results?
462.56	for this specific industry.
465.283	But actually, the most exciting part
465.283	of this new manufacturing revolution
471.457	goes much beyond productivity.
474.692	It's about producing better,
474.692	smarter products.
478.287	It's about scale customization.
481.099	Imagine a world where you can buy
481.099	the exact products you want
485.858	with the functionalities you need,
488.092	with the design you want,
490.064	with the same cost and lead time
491.674	as a product that's been mass produced,
493.58	like your car, or your clothes
493.58	or your cell phone.
497.113	The new manufacturing revolution
497.113	makes it possible.
500.577	Advanced robots can be programmed
503.422	in order to perform
503.422	any product configuration
506.565	without any setup time or ramp up.
509.791	3D printers instantaneously produce
509.791	any customized design.
515.675	We are now able to produce
515.675	a batch of one product, your product,
521.368	at the same cost and lead time
521.368	as a batch of many.
525.629	Those are only a few examples
525.629	of the manufacturing revolution at play.
530.468	Not only will manufacturing
530.468	become more productive,
534.579	it will also become more flexible,
537.538	and those were exactly the elements
537.538	of growth that we are missing.
543.106	But actually, there are even
543.106	some bigger implications
546.748	for all of us when manufacturing
546.748	will find its way back into the limelight.
552.441	It will create a huge macroeconomic shift.
556.683	First, our factories will be relocated
556.683	into our home markets.
561.877	In the world of scale customization,
564.144	consumer proximity is the new norm.
567.722	Then, our factories
567.722	will be smaller, agile.
571.918	Scale does not matter anymore,
571.918	flexibility does.
575.802	They will be operating on a multi-product,
575.802	made-to-order basis.
579.859	The change will be drastic.
582.59	Globalization will enter a new era.
587.145	The East-to-West trade flows
590.084	will be replaced by regional trade flows.
592.789	East for East, West for West.
595.687	When you think about that,
597.884	the old model was pretty much insane.
601.065	Piling up stocks, making products
601.065	travel the whole world
604.84	before they reach their end consumers.
606.743	The new model, producing
606.743	just next to the consumer market,
611.007	will be much cleaner,
611.007	much better for our environment.
616.678	In mature economies,
616.678	manufacturing will be back home,
620.487	creating more employment,
622.587	more productivity and more growth.
625.93	Good news, isn't it?
628.541	But here's the thing with growth --
630.37	it does not come automatically.
632.328	Mature economies will have to seize it.
635.196	We'll have to massively
635.196	re-train our workforce.
638.547	In most countries,
638.547	like in my country, France,
641.231	we've told our children
641.231	that manufacturing had no future.
644.357	That it was something happening far away.
646.358	We need to reverse that
648.18	and teach manufacturing again
648.18	at university.
651.203	Only the countries
651.203	that will boldly transform
654.712	will be able to seize this growth.
658.64	It's also a chance
658.64	for developing economies.
662.461	Of course China
662.461	and other emerging economies
666.118	won't be the factory of the world anymore.
669.545	Actually, it was not a sustainable
669.545	model in the long term,
674.187	as those countries are becoming richer.
677.779	Last year, it was already
677.779	as expensive to produce in Brazil
682.827	as to produce in France.
686.184	By 2018, manufacturing costs in China
686.184	will be on par with the US.
693.35	The new manufacturing revolution
695.625	will accelerate the transition
695.625	of those emerging economies
700.429	towards a model driven
700.429	by domestic consumption.
703.675	And this is good,
704.876	because this is where growth
704.876	will be created.
707.915	In the next five years,
709.543	the next billion consumers in China
709.543	will inject more growth in our economies
714.871	than the top five
714.871	European markets together.
719.944	This fourth manufacturing revolution
719.944	is a chance for all of us.
725.046	If we play it right,
727.024	we'll see sustainable growth
727.024	in all of our economies.
730.969	This means more wealth
730.969	distributed to all of us
734.658	and a better future for our children.
737.189	Thank you.
738.374	(Applause)
