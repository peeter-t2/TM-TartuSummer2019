12.64	So when I decided to create
12.64	an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,
16.4	the neighborhood of the Cairo
16.4	garbage collectors in Egypt,
19.4	I never thought this project would be
21.24	the most amazing human experience
21.24	that I would ever live.
24.64	As an artist, I had
24.64	this humanist intention
27.36	of beautifying a poor
27.36	and neglected neighborhood
29.76	by bringing art to it and hopefully
29.76	shining light on this isolated community.
36	The first time I heard about
36	this Christian Coptic community
39.64	was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities
39.64	under the regime of Hosni Mubarak
45.08	decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs
45.08	using the pretext of H1N1 virus.
51.56	Originally, they are pig breeders.
53.52	Their pigs and other animals
53.52	are fed with the organic waste
56.72	that they collect on a daily basis.
58.72	This event killed their livelihood.
61.08	The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser,
61.08	it felt like a maze.
64.56	I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery
64.56	on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.
68.28	So you go right, then straight,
68.28	then right again, then left
71.48	to reach all the way to the top.
73.2	But to reach there, you must dodge between
73.2	the trucks overpacked with garbage
77.64	and slalom between the tuk-tuks,
79.24	the fastest vehicle to move around
79.24	in the neighborhood.
83.04	The smell of the garbage
83.04	unloaded from those trucks was intense,
86.2	and the noise of the traffic
86.2	was loud and overbearing.
89.6	Add to it the din created by the crushers
89.6	in those warehouses along the way.
94.92	From outside it looks chaotic,
94.92	but everything is perfectly organized.
100.6	The Zaraeeb, that’s how
100.6	they call themselves,
103.08	which means the pig breeders,
104.64	have been collecting the garbage of Cairo
107.04	and sorting it in their own
107.04	neighborhood for decades.
109.84	They have developed
109.84	one of the most efficient
112	and highly profitable systems
112	on a global level.
115.32	Still, the place is perceived
115.32	as dirty, marginalized and segregated
119.96	because of their association
119.96	with the trash.
123.08	So my initial idea
123.08	was to create an anamorphic piece,
125.96	a piece that you can only see
125.96	from one vantage point.
128.84	I wanted to challenge myself artistically
128.84	by painting over several buildings
133.2	and having it only fully visible
133.2	from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.
138.36	The Muqattam Mountain
138.36	is the pride of the community.
140.96	This is where they built
140.96	the St. Simon Monastery,
143.44	a 10,000-seat cave church
143.44	that they carved into the mountain itself.
149.2	So, the first time
149.2	I stood on top of the mountain
153.28	and I looked at the neighborhood,
154.92	I asked myself, how on earth
154.92	will I convince all those owners
157.84	to let me paint on their buildings?
160.04	And then Magd came.
161.44	Magd is a guide from the Church.
163.84	He told me the only person I needed
163.84	to convince was Father Samaan,
167.96	who is the leader of the community.
170.44	But to convince Father Samaan,
170.44	I needed to convince Mario,
173.68	who is a Polish artist
173.68	who moved to Cairo 20 years ago
176.76	and who created all the artwork
176.76	of the Cave Church.
180.6	I am really grateful to Mario.
180.6	He was the key of the project.
184.28	He managed to get me
184.28	a meeting with Father Samaan,
186.68	and surprisingly, he loved the idea.
188.44	He asked me about where I painted before
190.72	and how I will make it happen.
192.2	And he was mainly concerned
192.2	by what I was going to write.
196.76	In every work that I create,
196.76	I write messages
198.92	with my style of Arabic calligraphy.
200.72	I make sure those messages are relevant
200.72	to the place where I am painting
204.48	but have this universal dimension,
206.124	so anybody around the world
206.124	can relate to it.
209.56	So for Manshiyat Naser,
210.84	I decided to write in Arabic
210.84	the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,
215.64	a Coptic bishop from the third century,
217.6	who said: (Arabic),
222.2	which means in English,
223.48	"""Anyone who wants"
223.48	to see the sunlight clearly
225.64	"needs to wipe his eyes first."""
227.8	It was really important for me
229.6	that the community
229.6	felt connected to the words.
232.52	And for me this quote was perfectly
232.52	reflecting the spirit of the project.
236.48	So Father Samaan blessed the project,
238.92	and his approval brought
238.92	all the residents on board.
242.64	Hundreds of liters of paint,
242.64	a dozen blue manual lifts,
246.96	several trips back and forth to Cairo,
249.12	a strong and solid team from France,
249.12	North Africa, Middle East and the US,
253.28	and after a year of planning
253.28	and logistics, there we are,
256.76	my team and some members
256.76	from the local community
259.4	creating a piece that will
259.4	spread over 50 buildings,
262.92	some filling up the space
262.92	of the calligraphy
265.84	that I trace with colors.
267.28	Here some blue, there some yellow,
267.28	there some orange.
270.36	Some others carrying some sand bags
272.519	and putting them
272.519	on the top of the buildings
274.64	to hold those manual lifts,
276	and some others assembling
276	and disassembling those same lifts
278.92	and moving them around
278.92	the different buildings.
282.2	At the beginning of the project,
283.92	I numbered all those
283.92	buildings on my sketch,
287.6	and there was no real interaction
287.6	with the community.
290.12	People didn’t get the point of all this.
292.28	But fast enough, those building numbers
292.28	became family names.
296.8	The first building
296.8	was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.
300.04	Uncle Ibrahim is such
300.04	an enthusiastic person.
302.2	He was always singing and making jokes,
304.28	and his daughters and sons
304.28	saved me from his bull
308.64	who wanted to attack me
308.64	on the fourth floor.
311.12	(Laughter)
312.44	Actually, the bull saw me from the window
312.44	and came out on the balcony.
315.76	(Laughter)
317.12	Yeah.
321.68	Uncle Ibrahim was always
321.68	hanging out on the balcony
324.36	and talking to me while I was painting.
326.36	I remember him saying that he didn’t
326.36	go to the mountain for 10 years,
330.36	and that he never takes a day off.
332.2	He said that if he stopped working,
332.2	who will stop the garbage?
336	But surprisingly,
336	at the end of the project,
339.44	he came all the way to the mountain
339.44	to look at the piece.
342.28	He was really proud
342.28	to see his house painted,
345.08	and he said that this project
345.08	was a project of peace and --
350.4	sorry --
353	(Applause)
366.4	Thank you.
368.32	He said that it was a project
368.32	of peace and unity
373.32	and that it brought people together.
375.68	So his perception
375.68	towards the project changed,
378.92	and my perception towards
378.92	the community changed also,
382.84	and towards what they do.
384.8	All the garbage that everybody
384.8	is disgusted by is not theirs.
389.44	They just work out of it.
390.96	Actually, they don’t live in the garbage.
390.96	They live from the garbage.
394.24	So I started doubting myself and wondering
396.48	what was the real purpose
396.48	of this whole project?
400.28	It was not about beautifying
400.28	a place by bringing art to it.
404.4	It was about switching perception
404.4	and opening a dialogue
407.48	on the connection that we have
407.48	with communities that we don’t know.
411.52	So day after day,
412.8	the calligraphy circle was taking shape,
415.2	and we were always excited to go back
415.2	on the mountain to look at the piece.
419.28	And standing exactly at this point
419.28	every day made my realize
422.44	the symbolism behind
422.44	this anamorphic piece.
425.28	If you want to see
425.28	the real image of somebody,
427.48	maybe you should change your angle.
430.44	There was doubts and difficulties,
432.28	like fears and stress.
433.56	It wasn't simple
433.56	to work in such environments,
435.76	sometimes having pigs under you
435.76	while you paint
438	or climbing a stack of garbage
438	to reach a lift.
440.84	But we all got over the fear
440.84	of the heights, the swinging lifts,
444.2	the strength of the smell
445.48	and also the stress
445.48	of not finishing on time.
447.64	But the kindness of all those people
447.64	made us forget everything.
451.6	The building number 3 was the house
451.6	of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.
455.8	In Egyptian, they have
455.8	"this expression that says, ""Ahsen Nas,"""
459.08	"which means ""the best people."""
460.64	They were the best people.
461.92	We used to take our break
461.92	in front of their houses,
465.08	and all the kids of the neighborhood
467.48	used to join us.
468.84	I was impressed and amazed
468.84	by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.
473.2	For the first few days, they were always
473.2	refusing anything we were offering them,
477.36	even a snack or a drink.
479.44	"So I asked Aunty Fareeda, ""Why is that?"""
481.4	And she told me they teach
481.4	their kids to refuse anything
485.28	from somebody that they don't know
486.96	because maybe this person
486.96	needs it more than they do.
490.88	So at this exact point I realized actually
494.92	the Zaraeeb community
494.92	was the ideal context
497.08	to raise the topic of perception.
499.24	We need to question
499.24	our level of misconception
502.56	and judgment we can have as a society
505.24	upon communities
505.24	based on their differences.
508.96	I remember how we got delayed
508.96	on Uncle Ibrahim's house
512.44	when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop
514.6	were eating the sand bags
514.6	that hold the lifts.
517.2	(Laughter)
519.64	The house of Uncle Bakheet
519.64	and Aunty Fareeda
522.6	was this kind of meeting point.
524.28	Everybody used to gather there.
526.159	I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant
528.12	when he said that was
528.12	a project of peace and unity,
530.76	because I really felt
530.76	that people were coming together.
534.32	Everyone was greeting us
534.32	with a smile, offering us a drink
537.52	or inviting us into their
537.52	own house for lunch.
541.56	Sometime, you are
541.56	at the first level of a building,
544.6	and somebody opens his window
544.6	and offers you some tea.
547.16	And then the same thing happens
547.16	on the second floor.
549.64	And you keep going all the way to the top.
551.68	(Laughter)
552.92	(Applause)
554.4	I think I never drink as much tea
554.4	as I did in Egypt.
556.88	(Laughter)
558.72	And to be honest with you,
558.72	we could have finished earlier,
561.48	but I think it took us three weeks
561.48	because of all those tea breaks.
564.68	(Laughter)
568.52	In Egypt, they have another expression,
568.52	"which is ""Nawartouna,"""
572.08	"which means, ""You brought light to us."""
575.2	In Manshiyat Naser
575.2	they were always telling us this.
578.12	The calligraphy, actually --
580.28	I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint
580.28	for the calligraphy
584.36	so at the end of the project,
584.36	we rented some black light projectors
588.56	and lit up the whole neighborhood,
590.96	surprising everybody around.
592.36	We wanted to tell them
593.64	that they are the ones
593.64	who brought light to us.
598.28	(Applause)
609	The Zaraeeb community
609	are strong, honest, hard workers,
613.08	and they know their value.
614.84	The people of Cairo
614.84	"call them ""the Zabaleen,"""
617	"which means ""the people of the garbage,"""
619	but ironically,
619	the people of Manshiyat Naser
621.76	call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.
623.64	They say, they are the ones
623.64	who produce the garbage, not them.
626.6	(Laughter)
627.84	(Applause)
629.24	The goal was to leave something
629.24	to this community,
631.64	but I feel that they are the ones
631.64	who left something in our lives.
634.8	You know, the art project
634.8	was just a pretext
636.92	for this amazing human experience.
638.6	The art piece at some point
638.6	will disappear, vanish,
641.04	and actually there is somebody
641.04	who is building a second floor
643.96	in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,
645.64	so it's covering part of the painting,
647.52	so I might need to go back
647.52	and paint over it.
649.68	(Laughter)
651.32	It was about the experience,
652.72	about the story,
654.16	about the moment.
656.56	From the streets of the neighborhood,
658.48	the painting appears in fragments,
660.124	isolated from one another,
662.04	standing alone.
663.32	But connected with the sign of calligraphy
665.52	that today reveals the powerful message
665.52	that we should all think about
669.4	before we want to judge somebody.
671.64	Anyone who wants to see
671.64	the sunlight clearly
673.8	needs to wipe his eyes first.
675.76	Thank you.
677.2	(Applause)
