15.26	The things we make
17.26	have one supreme quality --
20.26	they live longer than us.
22.26	We perish, they survive;
24.26	we have one life, they have many lives,
27.26	and in each life they can mean different things.
30.26	Which means that, while we all have one biography,
33.26	they have many.
35.26	I want this morning to talk
37.26	about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --
40.26	of one particular object,
43.26	one remarkable thing.
45.26	It doesn't, I agree,
47.26	look very much.
49.26	It's about the size of a rugby ball.
52.26	It's made of clay,
54.26	and it's been fashioned
56.26	into a cylinder shape,
59.26	covered with close writing
61.26	and then baked dry in the sun.
64.26	And as you can see,
66.26	it's been knocked about a bit,
68.26	which is not surprising
70.26	because it was made two and a half thousand years ago
73.26	and was dug up
75.26	in 1879.
77.26	But today,
79.26	this thing is, I believe,
81.26	a major player
83.26	in the politics of the Middle East.
85.26	And it's an object
87.26	with fascinating stories
89.26	and stories that are by no means over yet.
93.26	The story begins
95.26	in the Iran-Iraq war
99.26	and that series of events
101.26	that culminated
103.26	in the invasion of Iraq
105.26	by foreign forces,
107.26	the removal of a despotic ruler
109.26	and instant regime change.
112.26	And I want to begin
114.26	with one episode from that sequence of events
116.26	that most of you would be very familiar with,
119.26	Belshazzar's feast --
121.26	because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war
123.26	of 539 BC.
126.26	And the parallels
128.26	between the events
130.26	of 539 BC and 2003 and in between
133.26	are startling.
135.26	What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,
137.26	now in the National Gallery in London,
139.26	illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel
141.26	in the Hebrew scriptures.
144.26	And you all know roughly the story.
146.26	Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,
149.26	Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem
152.26	and captured the people
154.26	and taken the Jews back to Babylon.
156.26	Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
159.26	He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
162.26	And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem
165.26	had been taken to Babylon.
168.26	Belshazzar, his son,
170.26	decides to have a feast.
172.26	And in order to make it even more exciting,
174.26	he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,
177.26	and he brings out the temple vessels.
180.26	He's already at war with the Iranians,
183.26	with the king of Persia.
185.26	And that night, Daniel tells us,
188.26	at the height of the festivities
190.26	a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,
193.26	"""You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,"
196.26	and your kingdom is handed over
198.26	"to the Medes and the Persians."""
200.26	And that very night
202.26	Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon
206.26	and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.
211.26	It is, of course, a great moment
213.26	in the history
215.26	of the Jewish people.
217.26	It's a great story. It's story we all know.
219.26	"""The writing on the wall"""
221.26	is part of our everyday language.
224.26	What happened next
226.26	was remarkable,
228.26	and it's where our cylinder
230.26	enters the story.
232.26	Cyrus, king of the Persians,
234.26	has entered Babylon without a fight --
236.26	the great empire of Babylon,
238.26	which ran from central southern Iraq
240.26	to the Mediterranean,
242.26	falls to Cyrus.
244.26	And Cyrus makes a declaration.
248.26	And that is what this cylinder is,
251.26	the declaration made by the ruler guided by God
254.26	who had toppled the Iraqi despot
258.26	and was going to bring freedom to the people.
260.26	In ringing Babylonian --
262.26	it was written in Babylonian --
264.26	"he says, ""I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,"
267.26	the great king, the powerful king,
269.26	"king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."""
273.26	They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
276.26	This is probably
278.26	the first real press release
280.26	by a victorious army
282.26	that we've got.
284.26	And it's written, as we'll see in due course,
286.26	by very skilled P.R. consultants.
289.26	So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
292.26	And what is the great king, the powerful king,
294.26	the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?
297.26	He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,
300.26	he will at once let all the peoples
303.26	that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar --
305.26	have captured and enslaved
307.26	go free.
309.26	He'll let them return to their countries.
311.26	And more important,
313.26	he will let them all recover
315.26	the gods, the statues,
317.26	the temple vessels
319.26	that had been confiscated.
321.26	All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed
324.26	will go home,
326.26	and they'll take with them their gods.
329.26	And they'll be able to restore their altars
332.26	and to worship their gods
334.26	in their own way, in their own place.
337.26	This is the decree,
339.26	this object is the evidence
342.26	for the fact that the Jews,
344.26	after the exile in Babylon,
346.26	the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,
349.26	weeping when they remembered Jerusalem,
352.26	those Jews were allowed to go home.
355.26	They were allowed to return to Jerusalem
357.26	and to rebuild the temple.
359.26	It's a central document
361.26	in Jewish history.
363.26	And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures
367.26	reported in ringing terms.
369.26	This is the Jewish version
371.26	of the same story.
373.26	"""Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,"
375.26	'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,
378.26	and he has charged me
380.26	to build him a house in Jerusalem.
382.26	Who is there among you of his people?
384.26	The Lord God be with him,
386.26	"and let him go up.'"""
389.26	"""Go up"" -- aaleh."
391.26	The central element, still,
394.26	of the notion of return,
396.26	a central part
398.26	of the life of Judaism.
400.26	As you all know, that return from exile,
402.26	the second temple,
404.26	reshaped Judaism.
406.26	And that change,
408.26	that great historic moment,
410.26	was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,
414.26	reported for us in Hebrew in scripture
417.26	and in Babylonian in clay.
420.26	Two great texts,
422.26	what about the politics?
424.26	What was going on
426.26	was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.
429.26	The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,
432.26	united under Cyrus,
434.26	became the first great world empire.
438.26	Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
441.26	And by the time of his son Darius,
445.26	the whole of the eastern Mediterranean
448.26	is under Persian control.
450.26	This empire is, in fact,
452.26	the Middle East as we now know it,
454.26	and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
457.26	It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
459.26	Much more important,
461.26	it was the first
463.26	multicultural, multifaith state
465.26	on a huge scale.
467.26	And it had to be run in a quite new way.
469.26	It had to be run in different languages.
471.26	The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.
474.26	And it had to recognize their different habits,
476.26	different peoples, different religions, different faiths.
479.26	All of those are respected by Cyrus.
482.26	Cyrus sets up a model
484.26	of how you run
486.26	a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.
491.26	And the result of that
493.26	was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,
496.26	and which survived for 200 years of stability
499.26	until it was shattered by Alexander.
502.26	It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,
504.26	and a unit where people of different faiths
506.26	could live together.
508.26	The Greek invasions ended that.
510.26	And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government
513.26	and it fragmented.
515.26	But what Cyrus represented
517.26	remained absolutely central.
519.26	The Greek historian Xenophon
522.26	"wrote his book ""Cyropaedia"""
524.26	promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.
526.26	And throughout European culture afterward,
529.26	Cyrus remained the model.
532.26	This is a 16th century image
534.26	to show you how widespread
536.26	his veneration actually was.
539.26	And Xenophon's book on Cyrus
541.26	on how you ran a diverse society
544.26	was one of the great textbooks
546.26	that inspired the Founding Fathers
548.26	of the American Revolution.
550.26	Jefferson was a great admirer --
552.26	the ideals of Cyrus
554.26	obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals
556.26	of how you create religious tolerance
558.26	in a new state.
563.26	Meanwhile, back in Babylon,
565.26	things had not been going well.
567.26	After Alexander, the other empires,
570.26	Babylon declines, falls into ruins,
573.26	and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost --
577.26	until 1879
579.26	when the cylinder is discovered
582.26	by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.
585.26	And it enters now another story.
588.26	It enters that great debate
590.26	in the middle of the 19th century:
592.26	Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?
595.26	We only knew
597.26	about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus
599.26	from the Hebrew scriptures.
601.26	No other evidence.
603.26	Suddenly, this appeared.
605.26	And great excitement
607.26	to a world where those who believed in the scriptures
609.26	had had their faith in creation shaken
611.26	by evolution, by geology,
613.26	here was evidence
615.26	that the scriptures were historically true.
617.26	It's a great 19th century moment.
620.26	But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated --
625.26	the facts were true,
627.26	hurrah for archeology,
630.26	but the interpretation was rather more complicated.
633.26	Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account
636.26	differ in one key respect.
638.26	The Babylonian cylinder
640.26	is written by the priests
642.26	of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.
644.26	And, not surprisingly,
646.26	they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.
648.26	"""Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."""
651.26	Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand,
654.26	calls him to shepherd his people
656.26	and gives him the rule of Babylon.
659.26	Marduk tells Cyrus
661.26	that he will do these great, generous things
663.26	of setting the people free.
665.26	And this is why we should all be grateful to
667.26	and worship Marduk.
669.26	The Hebrew writers
671.26	in the Old Testament,
673.26	you will not be surprised to learn,
676.26	take a rather different view of this.
678.26	For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk
680.26	that made all this happen.
682.26	It can only be Jehovah.
684.26	And so in Isaiah,
686.26	we have the wonderful texts
688.26	giving all the credit of this,
690.26	not to Marduk
691.26	but to the Lord God of Israel --
694.26	the Lord God of Israel
696.26	who also called Cyrus by name,
698.26	also takes Cyrus by the hand
701.26	and talks of him shepherding his people.
703.26	It's a remarkable example
705.26	of two different priestly appropriations of the same event,
709.26	two different religious takeovers
711.26	of a political fact.
713.26	God, we know,
715.26	is usually on the side of the big battalions.
717.26	The question is, which god was it?
720.26	And the debate unsettles
722.26	everybody in the 19th century
724.26	to realize that the Hebrew scriptures
726.26	are part of a much wider world of religion.
729.26	And it's quite clear
731.26	the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,
734.26	and yet, Jehovah is speaking
736.26	in words very similar
738.26	to those used by Marduk.
740.26	And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,
743.26	because he says,
745.26	this is God speaking, of course,
748.26	"""I have called thee by thy name"
750.26	"though thou hast not known me."""
752.26	I think it's recognized
754.26	that Cyrus doesn't realize
756.26	that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.
759.26	And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.
762.26	Because interestingly, of course,
764.26	Cyrus is a good Iranian
766.26	with a totally different set of gods
768.26	who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
770.26	(Laughter)
772.26	That's 1879.
776.26	and we're in 1917,
779.26	and the cylinder enters a different world.
781.26	This time, the real politics
783.26	of the contemporary world --
785.26	the year of the Balfour Declaration,
788.26	the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,
791.26	decides that it will declare
793.26	a Jewish national home,
795.26	it will allow
797.26	the Jews to return.
799.26	And the response to this
801.26	by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.
804.26	And across Eastern Europe,
806.26	Jews display pictures of Cyrus
808.26	and of George V
810.26	side by side --
812.26	the two great rulers
814.26	who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.
817.26	And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view
820.26	and the text of this
822.26	as a demonstration of why what is going to happen
825.26	after the war is over in 1918
828.26	is part of a divine plan.
831.26	You all know what happened.
833.26	The state of Israel is setup,
836.26	and 50 years later, in the late 60s,
839.26	it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.
842.26	And another story of the cylinder begins.
845.26	The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,
847.26	has to be kept safe from communism,
850.26	and the superpower that will be created to do this
853.26	would be Iran, the Shah.
855.26	And so the Shah invents an Iranian history,
858.26	or a return to Iranian history,
860.26	that puts him in the center of a great tradition
863.26	and produces coins
865.26	showing himself
867.26	with the Cyrus cylinder.
869.26	When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,
872.26	he summons the cylinder
874.26	and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,
877.26	and is part of those great celebrations
879.26	of the Pahlavi dynasty.
882.26	Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
888.26	Iranian Revolution, 1979.
890.26	Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus;
892.26	we're not interested in that history,
894.26	we're interested in Islamic Iran --
897.26	until Iraq,
899.26	the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,
902.26	attacks.
904.26	Then another Iran-Iraq war.
906.26	And it becomes critical for the Iranians
908.26	to remember their great past,
911.26	their great past
913.26	when they fought Iraq and won.
916.26	It becomes critical to find a symbol
918.26	that will pull together all Iranians --
921.26	Muslims and non-Muslims,
923.26	Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,
926.26	people who are devout, not devout.
928.26	And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
931.26	So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem
934.26	cooperate and work together, as we've been doing,
936.26	the Iranians ask for one thing only
938.26	as a loan.
940.26	It's the only object they want.
942.26	They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
944.26	And last year,
946.26	the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran
950.26	for the second time.
953.26	It's shown being presented here, put into its case
956.26	by the director of the National Museum of Tehran,
959.26	one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,
962.26	Mrs. Ardakani.
964.26	It was a huge event.
966.26	This is the other side of that same picture.
969.26	It's seen in Tehran
972.26	by between one and two million people
974.26	in the space of a few months.
976.26	This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition
978.26	in the West.
980.26	And it's the subject of a huge debate
983.26	about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,
986.26	but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder --
989.26	Cyrus as the defender of the homeland,
992.26	the champion, of course, of Iranian identity
994.26	and of the Iranian peoples,
996.26	tolerant of all faiths.
998.26	And in the current Iran,
1000.26	Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places
1003.26	in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.
1006.26	To see this object in Tehran,
1009.26	thousands of Jews living in Iran
1011.26	came to Tehran to see it.
1013.26	It became a great emblem,
1015.26	a great subject of debate
1017.26	about what Iran is at home and abroad.
1020.26	Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?
1023.26	Will Iran set free the people
1025.26	that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?
1028.26	This is heady national rhetoric,
1031.26	and it was all put together
1033.26	in a great pageant
1035.26	launching the return.
1037.26	Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage
1040.26	with great figures from Iranian history
1043.26	gathering to take their place
1045.26	in the heritage of Iran.
1048.26	It was a narrative presented
1050.26	by the president himself.
1053.26	And for me,
1055.26	to take this object to Iran,
1057.26	to be allowed to take this object to Iran
1059.26	was to be allowed to be part
1061.26	of an extraordinary debate
1063.26	led at the highest levels
1065.26	about what Iran is,
1067.26	what different Irans there are
1070.26	and how the different histories of Iran
1072.26	might shape the world today.
1075.26	It's a debate that's still continuing,
1078.26	and it will continue to rumble,
1080.26	because this object
1082.26	is one of the great declarations
1084.26	of a human aspiration.
1086.26	It stands with the American constitution.
1090.26	It certainly says far more about real freedoms
1093.26	than Magna Carta.
1095.26	It is a document that can mean so many things,
1098.26	for Iran and for the region.
1101.26	A replica of this
1103.26	is at the United Nations.
1105.26	In New York this autumn, it will be present
1108.26	when the great debates
1110.26	about the future of the Middle East take place.
1113.26	And I want to finish by asking you
1115.26	what the next story will be
1117.26	in which this object figures.
1119.26	It will appear, certainly,
1121.26	in many more Middle Eastern stories.
1123.26	And what story of the Middle East,
1125.26	what story of the world,
1127.26	do you want to see
1129.26	reflecting what is said,
1131.26	what is expressed in this cylinder?
1133.26	The right of peoples
1135.26	to live together in the same state,
1137.26	worshiping differently, freely --
1139.26	a Middle East, a world,
1141.26	in which religion is not the subject of division
1143.26	or of debate.
1146.26	In the world of the Middle East at the moment,
1149.26	the debates are, as you know, shrill.
1152.26	But I think it's possible
1154.26	that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them
1158.26	may well be the voice
1160.26	of this mute thing,
1162.26	the Cyrus cylinder.
1164.26	Thank you.
1166.26	(Applause)
