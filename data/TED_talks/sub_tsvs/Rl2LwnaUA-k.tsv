25	Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,
29	the functions and structure of the human brain.
31	And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.
35	Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly
39	you can hold in the palm of your hand,
42	and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
46	It can contemplate the meaning of infinity
48	and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.
53	And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,
58	which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,
62	and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.
65	OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?
68	I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,
72	little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,
75	and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities
79	that we call human nature and human consciousness.
82	How does this happen?
83	Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.
86	One approach, the one we use mainly,
89	is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,
94	where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.
96	What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction
100	in all your mental capacities,
102	a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
105	What you get is a highly selective loss of one function,
108	with other functions being preserved intact,
110	and this gives you some confidence in asserting
112	that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.
116	So you can then map function onto structure,
118	and then find out what the circuitry's doing
121	to generate that particular function.
123	So that's what we're trying to do.
125	So let me give you a few striking examples of this.
128	In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
132	The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
136	If you look at the first slide there,
138	that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --
143	the lobes that constitute the brain.
145	And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --
149	you can't see it there --
151	is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
153	And that's been called the face area in the brain,
156	because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.
159	You can still recognize them from their voice
161	"and say, ""Oh yeah, that's Joe,"""
163	but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?
166	You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.
168	I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,
171	and you know it's a mirror,
173	but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
176	OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.
180	But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,
183	that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
187	This is called the Capgras delusion,
189	and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,
192	has had a head injury, comes out of coma,
195	otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother
198	"and says, ""This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,"
201	but she's an impostor.
203	"She's some other woman pretending to be my mother."""
205	Now, why does this happen?
207	Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent
210	in all other respects, but when he sees his mother,
212	his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.
215	Now, the most common interpretation of this,
217	which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,
219	is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --
223	and the same argument applies to women, by the way,
225	but I'll just talk about guys.
227	When you're a little baby, a young baby,
230	you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
232	This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.
234	I'm not saying I believe this,
236	but this is the standard Freudian view.
238	And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,
241	and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.
245	Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
249	And then what happens is,
251	there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,
253	allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,
257	flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably
260	you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.
263	"And you say, ""My God, if this is my mom,"
265	how come I'm being sexually turned on?
267	"She's some other woman. She's an impostor."""
269	It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
273	This has never made much sense to me, this argument.
276	It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --
279	(Laughter)
281	-- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,
286	a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
288	(Laughter)
289	"He'll say, ""Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,"
294	"but it's some other dog."" Right?"
296	Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
298	(Laughter)
299	You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,
303	or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
306	Now, what's really going on?
308	So, to explain this curious disorder,
310	we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.
314	Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,
317	go to the visual areas in the brain.
319	There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,
322	and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure
325	called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.
330	There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.
332	You can call it the face area of the brain, right?
335	I talked about that earlier.
337	Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?
341	But from that area, the message cascades
344	into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,
347	the emotional core of the brain,
349	and that structure, called the amygdala,
351	gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
353	Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?
357	Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,
359	or a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --
363	or a shoe, or something like that? OK?
365	Which you can completely ignore.
367	So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,
370	the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.
373	Your heart starts beating faster.
375	You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to
378	create from muscular exertion.
380	And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm
384	and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.
388	So I can determine, when you're looking at something,
390	whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?
394	And I'll get to that in a minute.
396	So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his --
400	any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,
404	however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,
407	and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,
410	or your mother, for that matter, OK?
412	And then the message cascades into the amygdala,
415	and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.
417	But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,
422	the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.
425	So because the fusiform is intact,
427	the chap can still recognize his mother,
430	"and says, ""Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."""
432	But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,
435	"he says, ""But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"""
439	Or terror, as the case may be? Right?
441	(Laughter)
442	"And therefore, he says, ""How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?"
448	This can't be my mother.
450	"It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."""
452	How do you test this?
454	Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,
456	and measure your galvanic skin response,
459	and show pictures on the screen,
461	I can measure how you sweat when you see an object,
464	like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
467	If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?
472	And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --
475	I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.
477	You don't even have to be Jewish.
479	(Laughter)
481	Now, what happens if you show this patient?
485	You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen
489	and measure his galvanic skin response.
491	Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,
496	but when you show him a picture of his mother,
498	the galvanic skin response is flat.
500	There's no emotional reaction to his mother,
502	because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
507	So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,
510	his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --
513	but the wire from vision to emotions is cut
516	and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.
519	It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:
522	take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome
526	and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,
528	that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation
532	in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.
534	By the way, if this patient then goes,
536	and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --
541	"and he picks up the phone, and he says, ""Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"""
545	There's no delusion through the phone.
547	"Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, ""Who are you?"
549	"You look just like my mother."" OK?"
551	The reason is there's a separate pathway
553	going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,
557	and that's not been cut by the accident.
559	So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
564	When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
567	OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?
571	Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
574	And we approach this problem
576	by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.
580	And you all know what a phantom limb is.
582	When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,
585	or you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,
587	it's now a serious problem --
589	you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,
593	and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.
596	In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
598	Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.
601	I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --
605	who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps
610	at the appropriate time of the month.
612	And in fact, one student asked me the other day,
614	"""Do they get phantom PMS?"""
616	(Laughter)
617	A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
621	OK, now the next question is,
624	what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
627	One of the things we've found was,
629	about half the patients with phantom limbs
631	claim that they can move the phantom.
633	It'll pat his brother on the shoulder,
635	it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
637	These are very compelling, vivid sensations.
640	The patient's not delusional.
642	He knows that the arm is not there,
644	but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
647	But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
650	"The phantom limb -- they'll say, ""But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed."
654	It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
657	"If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."""
660	Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?
663	It sounds like an oxymoron.
665	But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,
668	these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,
670	the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.
674	The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,
677	was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
679	So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,
682	in a sling for a few months or a year, and then,
686	in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,
689	the surgeon amputates the arm,
691	and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?
695	And this is a serious clinical problem.
697	Patients become depressed.
699	Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?
701	So, how do you treat this syndrome?
703	Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
705	When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,
709	and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,
712	and the actual arm had been paralyzed,
715	and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,
719	and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
725	Why does this happen?
727	When the arm was intact, but paralyzed,
729	"the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, ""Move,"""
732	"but it's getting visual feedback saying, ""No."""
734	Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.
738	And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,
741	and we call this learned paralysis, OK?
744	The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,
748	that the mere command to move the arm
751	creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
753	And then, when you've amputated the arm,
755	this learned paralysis carries over into your body image
759	and into your phantom, OK?
762	Now, how do you help these patients?
764	How do you unlearn the learned paralysis,
766	so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm
770	of the phantom arm?
772	Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,
777	but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?
781	Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
784	How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
786	But that costs millions of dollars.
788	So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,
791	but don't tell my funding agencies.
793	(Laughter)
794	OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
798	You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,
800	and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.
804	He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
807	He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut
810	and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.
814	He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.
816	It was a paralyzed phantom arm.
818	So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,
822	which I call a mirror box, right?
825	And the patient puts his phantom left arm,
828	which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,
830	and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,
832	and makes the same posture, the clenched posture,
836	and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?
839	He looks at the phantom being resurrected,
842	because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,
846	and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.
848	"""Now,"" I said, ""now, look, wiggle your phantom --"
851	"your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."""
855	He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?
859	That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,
861	"the patient then says, ""Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,"
864	"and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."""
866	And remember, my first patient who came in --
869	(Applause)
870	-- thank you. (Applause)
874	My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,
877	"and I said, ""Look at your reflection of your phantom."""
880	"And he started giggling, he says, ""I can see my phantom."""
882	But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
884	He knows it's a mirror reflection,
886	but it's a vivid sensory experience.
888	"Now, I said, ""Move your normal hand and phantom."""
891	"He said, ""Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."""
893	"I said, ""Move your normal hand."""
895	"And he says, ""Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!"
897	"And my pain is being relieved."" OK?"
900	"And then I said, ""Close your eyes."""
901	He closes his eyes.
903	"""And move your normal hand."""
904	"""Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."""
905	"""OK, open your eyes."""
907	"""Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"""
908	So, he was like a kid in a candy store.
910	So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis
915	and the critical role of visual input,
917	but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize
919	for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
921	(Laughter)
922	(Applause)
923	It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.
926	(Laughter)
927	But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis
931	that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --
936	there may be a learned component to this,
938	which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.
941	"So, I said, ""Look, Derek"" --"
943	well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --
946	"I said, ""Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two."
950	Maybe, after a period of practice,
952	you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,
954	and start moving your paralyzed arm,
956	"and then, relieve yourself of pain."""
958	So he said OK, and he took it home.
960	"I said, ""Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."""
962	So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,
965	"and he said, ""Doctor, you're not going to believe this."""
967	"I said, ""What?"""
968	"He said, ""It's gone."""
970	"I said, ""What's gone?"""
971	I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.
973	(Laughter)
974	"He said, ""No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?"
977	"It's disappeared."""
979	And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,
981	I mean I've changed this guy's body image,
983	what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?
986	"And I said, ""Derek, does this bother you?"""
988	"He said, ""No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm"
991	and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,
994	no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.
997	But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,
1001	"and your box doesn't reach."""
1003	(Laughter)
1004	"""So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,"
1007	"so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"""
1010	He thought I was some kind of magician.
1012	Now, why does this happen?
1013	It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
1016	It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
1019	On the other hand, there's no proprioception,
1021	muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
1025	And your motor command saying there is an arm,
1027	and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,
1030	there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
1033	It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.
1035	And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears
1039	because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
1043	So, that's the bonus.
1045	Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients
1047	by other groups in Helsinki,
1049	so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,
1052	and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
1054	Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,
1057	nothing you can do about it.
1059	But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,
1064	and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
1067	This has also gone through clinical trials,
1069	helping lots and lots of patients.
1071	OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,
1075	which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
1079	This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
1082	He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
1084	He pointed out that certain people in the population,
1086	who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:
1090	every time they see a number, it's colored.
1093	Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,
1097	nine is indigo, OK?
1099	Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.
1102	Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.
1105	C sharp is blue, F sharp is green,
1108	another tone might be yellow, right?
1111	Why does this happen?
1113	This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,
1115	a mingling of the senses.
1117	In us, all the senses are distinct.
1119	These people muddle up their senses.
1121	Why does this happen?
1122	One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
1124	Synesthesia runs in families,
1126	so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.
1129	Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point
1133	about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --
1136	synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists
1141	and other creative people than in the general population.
1144	Why would that be?
1145	I'm going to answer that question.
1147	It's never been answered before.
1149	OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
1150	Well, there are many theories.
1151	One theory is they're just crazy.
1153	Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.
1156	Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?
1160	Now, there may be some truth to this,
1162	because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.
1164	(Laughter)
1165	OK. Now, the third theory is that --
1168	well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?
1173	So, we found that the color area and the number area
1176	are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
1179	So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring
1181	between color and numbers in the brain.
1184	So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,
1187	and that's why you get synesthesia.
1189	Now remember -- why does this happen?
1191	Why would there be crossed wires in some people?
1193	Remember I said it runs in families?
1195	That gives you the clue.
1197	And that is, there is an abnormal gene,
1199	a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
1202	In all of us, it turns out
1204	we are born with everything wired to everything else.
1208	So, every brain region is wired to every other region,
1211	and these are trimmed down to create
1213	the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.
1216	So, if there's a gene causing this trimming
1218	and if that gene mutates,
1220	then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.
1223	And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.
1226	If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
1229	So far, so good.
1231	Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,
1233	so everything is cross-connected?
1234	Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,
1240	the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,
1243	linking seemingly unrelated ideas,
1245	"such as, ""It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."""
1248	Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,
1250	does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?
1252	I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?
1255	Normal people say, she's warm like the sun,
1258	she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.
1260	Instantly, you've found the links.
1262	Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring
1265	and concepts are also in different parts of the brain,
1268	then it's going to create a greater propensity
1271	towards metaphorical thinking and creativity
1274	in people with synesthesia.
1276	And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia
1279	among poets, artists and novelists.
1281	OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
1284	The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?
1286	(Applause)
1288	OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.
1293	Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,
1297	A is A, B is B, C is C.
1300	Different shapes for different phonemes, right?
1303	Here, you've got Martian alphabet.
1305	One of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.
1307	Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?
1309	How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.
1311	Well, it's one or two mutants.
1313	(Laughter)
1314	How many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
1316	Ninety-nine percent of you.
1318	Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?
1320	It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,
1325	meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,
1329	in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,
1334	mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
1337	Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you
1340	is your brain is engaging in a primitive --
1342	it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,
1344	but these photons in your eye are doing this shape,
1348	and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,
1351	but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.
1356	It's a primitive form of abstraction,
1358	and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,
1363	because when that's damaged,
1364	these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,
1368	but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
1370	"If you ask this guy, what -- ""all that glitters is not gold,"""
1374	"what does that mean?"""
1376	"The patient says, ""Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold."
1378	"You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"""
1381	So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.
1384	So, this area is about eight times the size in higher --
1387	especially in humans -- as in lower primates.
1390	Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,
1393	because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,
1396	and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.
1400	And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities
1403	like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.
1406	All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,
1409	we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,
1413	and by studying patients and asking the right questions.
1415	Thank you.
1417	(Applause)
1418	Sorry about that.
1419	(Laughter)
