144.148	Guillaume Néry! National record!
149.745	Guillaume Néry: Thank you.
151.015	(Applause)
154.84	Thank you very much,
154.84	thanks for the warm welcome.
157.418	That dive you just watched is a journey --
160.646	a journey between two breaths.
163.367	A journey that takes place
163.367	between two breaths --
165.686	the last one before diving into the water,
167.964	and the first one,
167.964	coming back to the surface.
171.394	That dive is a journey
171.394	to the very limits of human possibility,
175.792	a journey into the unknown.
178.315	But it's also, and above all,
178.315	an inner journey,
181.87	where a number of things happen,
184.288	physiologically as well as mentally.
186.641	And that's why I'm here today,
188.681	to share my journey with you
188.681	and to take you along with me.
192.038	So, we start with the last breath.
195.987	(Breathing in)
209.279	(Breathing out)
211.143	As you noticed, that last breath
211.143	in is slow, deep and intense.
215.61	It ends with a special technique
215.61	called the carp,
218.19	which allows me to store one to two
218.19	extra liters of air in my lungs
221.855	by compressing it.
223.992	When I leave the surface,
223.992	I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.
229.539	As soon as I leave the surface
229.539	the first mechanism kicks in:
233.084	the diving reflex.
234.544	The first thing the diving reflex does
234.544	is make your heart rate drop.
239.452	My heart beat will drop
239.452	from about 60-70 per minute
242.309	to about 30-40 beats per minute
244.113	in a matter of seconds;
244.113	almost immediately.
247.058	Next, the diving reflex causes
247.058	peripheral vasoconstriction,
250.171	which means that the blood flow
250.171	will leave the body's extremities
254.365	to feed the most important organs:
258.382	the lungs, the heart and the brain.
262.602	This mechanism is innate.
266.11	I cannot control it.
267.55	If you go underwater,
267.55	even if you've never done it before,
270.366	you'll experience the exact same effects.
272.735	All human beings
272.735	share this characteristic.
276.382	And what's extraordinary
278.332	is that we share this instinct
278.332	with marine mammals --
281.873	all marine mammals:
281.873	dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.
285.555	When they dive deep into the ocean,
285.555	these mechanisms become activated,
290.175	but to a greater extent.
291.532	And, of course, it works
291.532	much better for them.
295.97	It's absolutely fascinating.
297.388	Right as I leave the surface,
298.838	nature gives me a push
298.838	in the right direction,
301.171	allowing me to descend with confidence.
303.587	So as I dive deeper into the blue,
305.627	the pressure slowly starts
305.627	to squeeze my lungs.
310.338	And since it's the amount of air
310.338	in my lungs that makes me float,
313.613	the farther down I go,
313.613	the more pressure there is on my lungs,
316.565	the less air they contain
316.565	and the easier it is for my body to fall.
320.192	And at one point,
320.192	around 35 or 40 meters down,
323.019	I don't even need to swim.
326.468	My body is dense and heavy enough
326.468	to fall into the depths by itself,
331.263	and I enter what's called
331.263	the free fall phase.
333.882	The free fall phase
333.882	is the best part of the dive.
336.628	It's the reason I still dive.
338.53	Because it feels like
338.53	you're being pulled down
343.401	and you don't need to do anything.
345.122	I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters
345.122	without making a single movement.
349.04	I let myself be pulled by the depths,
351.006	and it feels like I'm flying underwater.
352.968	It's truly an amazing feeling --
352.968	an extraordinary feeling of freedom.
356.975	And so I slowly continue
356.975	sliding to the bottom.
362.607	and between 50 and 60 meters,
362.607	a second physiological response kicks in.
367.702	My lungs reach residual volume,
370.242	below which they're not supposed
370.242	to be compressed, in theory.
375.205	And this second response
375.205	is called blood shift,
378.755	"or ""pulmonary erection"" in French."
382.236	"I prefer ""blood shift."""
383.569	(Laughter)
384.75	So blood shift -- how does it work?
387.519	The capillaries in the lungs
387.519	become engorged with blood --
392.117	which is caused by the suction --
393.734	so the lungs can harden
395.469	and protect the whole chest cavity
395.469	from being crushed.
398.165	It prevents the two walls
398.165	of the lungs from collapsing,
402.092	from sticking together and caving in.
404.078	Thanks to this phenomenon,
404.078	which we also share with marine mammals,
407.991	I'm able to continue with my dive.
	I keep falling, faster and faster,
413.318	because the pressure is crushing
413.318	my body more and more.
416.254	Below 80 meters,
418.355	the pressure becomes a lot stronger,
420.394	and I start to feel it physically.
422.489	I really start to feel the suffocation.
424.518	You can see what it looks like --
424.518	not pretty at all.
427.002	The diaphragm is completely collapsed,
427.002	the rib cage is squeezed in,
431.824	and mentally, there is something
431.824	going on as well.
434.331	You may be thinking,
434.331	"""This doesn't look enjoyable."
437.122	"How do you do it?"""
438.445	If I relied on my earthly reflexes --
440.27	what do we do above water
440.27	when there's a problem?
443.757	We resist, we go against it.
445.99	We fight.
447.357	Underwater, that doesn't work.
448.913	If you try that underwater,
448.913	you might tear your lungs,
451.529	spit up blood, develop an edema
453.119	and you'll have to stop diving
453.119	for a good amount of time.
456.278	So what you need to do, mentally,
456.278	is to tell yourself
459.476	that nature and the elements
459.476	are stronger than you.
462.27	And so I let the water crush me.
464.92	I accept the pressure and go with it.
468.481	At this point, my body
468.481	receives this information,
470.849	and my lungs start relaxing.
472.731	I relinquish all control,
472.731	and relax completely.
475.898	The pressure starts crushing me,
475.898	and it doesn't feel bad at all.
479.772	I even feel like
479.772	I'm in a cocoon, protected.
483.106	And the dive continues.
493.024	In every sport, it's a magic number.
494.91	For swimmers and athletes
494.91	and also for us, free divers,
497.764	it's a number everyone dreams of.
499.434	Everyone wishes one day
499.434	to be able to get to 100 meters.
502.856	And it's a symbolic number for us,
504.665	because in the 1970s,
504.665	doctors and physiologists did their math,
508.556	and predicted that the human body
508.556	would not be able to go below 100 meters.
513.889	Below that, they said,
513.889	the human body would implode.
516.769	And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --
518.905	you all know him as the hero
518.905	"in ""The Big Blue"" --"
521.222	came along and dived down to 100 meters.
524.499	He even reached 105 meters.
526.088	"At that time, he was doing ""no limits."""
528.008	He'd use weights to descend faster
528.008	and come back up with a balloon,
531.381	just like in the movie.
532.577	Today, we go down 200 meters
532.577	in no limit free diving.
535.179	I can do 123 meters
535.179	by simply using muscle strength.
538.059	And in a way, it's all thanks to him,
538.059	because he challenged known facts,
541.814	and with a sweep of his hand,
541.814	got rid of the theoretical beliefs
546.205	and all the mental limits
546.205	that we like to impose on ourselves.
549.63	He showed us that the human body
549.63	has an infinite ability to adapt.
553.27	So I carry on with my dive.
557.171	The bottom is getting closer.
561.679	I'm at the bottom.
562.982	And now, I'd like to ask you to join me
562.982	and put yourself in my place.
566.616	Close your eyes.
568.752	Imagine you get to 123 meters.
573.541	The surface is far, far away.
576.72	You're alone.
579.864	There's hardly any light.
582.324	It's cold --
583.603	freezing cold.
584.984	The pressure is crushing you completely --
590.214	And I know what you're thinking:
592.147	"""This is horrible."
594.12	What the hell am I doing here?
596	"He's insane."""
598.484	But no.
600.031	That's not what I think
600.031	when I'm down there.
602.315	When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.
604.064	I get this extraordinary
604.064	feeling of well-being.
606.345	Maybe it's because I've completely
606.345	released all tensions
609.258	and let myself go.
611.003	I feel great, without the need to breathe.
617.238	Although, you'd agree,
617.238	I should be worried.
621.999	I feel like a tiny dot,
621.999	a little drop of water,
624.346	floating in the middle of the ocean.
626.22	And each time, I picture the same image.
629.736	[The Pale Blue Dot]
632.473	It's that small dot
632.473	the arrow is pointing to.
634.951	Do you know what it is?
637.48	It's planet Earth.
639.478	Planet Earth, photographed
639.478	by the Voyager probe,
642.163	from 4 billion kilometers away.
644.339	And it shows that our home
644.339	is that small dot over there,
648.459	floating in the middle of nothing.
650.126	That's how I feel
652.071	when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.
654.246	I feel like a small dot,
655.985	a speck of dust, stardust,
658.564	floating in the middle of the cosmos,
660.803	in the middle of nothing,
660.803	in the immensity of space.
663.271	It's a fascinating sensation,
664.736	because when I look up, down,
664.736	left, right, in front, behind,
668.815	I see the same thing:
668.815	the infinite deep blue.
672.03	Nowhere else on Earth
672.03	you can experience this --
675.07	looking all around you,
675.07	and seeing the same thing.
678.657	It's extraordinary.
680.562	And at that moment,
682.026	I still get that feeling each time,
682.026	building up inside of me --
685.051	the feeling of humility.
688.875	Looking at this picture,
688.875	I feel very humble --
691.805	just like when I'm all the way
691.805	down at the bottom --
694.36	because I'm nothing,
695.661	I'm a little speck of nothingness
695.661	lost in all of time and space.
699.652	And it still is absolutely fascinating.
702.66	I decide to go back to the surface,
702.66	because this is not where I belong.
706.487	I belong up there, on the surface.
708.74	So I start heading back up.
712.018	I get something of a shock
716.293	at the very moment when I decide to go up.
718.78	First, because it takes a huge effort
718.78	to tear yourself away from the bottom.
722.711	It pulled you down on the way in,
725.215	and will do the same on the way up.
727.122	You have to swim twice as hard.
730.48	Then, I'm hit with another
730.48	phenomenon known as narcosis.
733.522	I don't know if you've heard of that.
735.318	It's called nitrogen narcosis.
737.469	It's something that happens
737.469	to scuba divers,
739.63	but it can happen to free divers.
741.273	It's caused by nitrogen
741.273	dissolving in the blood,
744.826	which causes confusion
746.744	between the conscious
746.744	and unconscious mind.
750.212	A flurry of thoughts goes spinning
750.212	through your head.
754.443	You can't control them,
754.443	and you shouldn't try to --
757.463	you have to let it happen.
759.071	The more you try to control it,
759.071	the harder it is to manage.
763.223	Then, a third thing happens:
764.715	the desire to breathe.
766.008	I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,
768.342	and the desire to breathe
768.342	reminds me of that fact.
771.887	Around 60, 70 meters,
775.551	you start to feel the need to breathe.
779.65	And with everything else that's going on,
782.11	you can very easily lose your ground
785.071	and start to panic.
787.871	When that happens, you think,
787.871	"""Where's the surface?"
790.316	"I want to go up. I want to breathe now."""
792.275	You should not do that.
793.931	Never look up to the surface --
795.789	not with your eyes, or your mind.
799.161	You should never
799.161	picture yourself up there.
801.914	You have to stay in the present.
803.576	I look at the rope right in front of me,
803.576	leading me back to the surface.
808.834	And I focus on that,
808.834	on the present moment.
811.829	Because if I think
811.829	about the surface, I panic.
814.029	And if I panic, it's over.
816.925	Time goes faster this way.
819.16	And at 30 meters: deliverance.
821.279	I'm not alone any more.
822.707	The safety divers,
822.707	my guardian angels, join me.
826.13	They leave the surface,
826.13	we meet at 30 meters,
828.477	and they escort me
828.477	for the final few meters,
830.655	where potential problems could arise.
833.881	Every time I see them, I think to myself,
837.253	"""It's thanks to you."""
838.865	It's thanks to them,
838.865	my team, that I'm here.
840.985	It brings back the sense of humility.
843.611	Without my team, without all
843.611	the people around me,
847.08	the adventure into the deep
847.08	would be impossible.
849.459	A journey into the deep
849.459	is above all a group effort.
853.359	So I'm happy to finish
853.359	my journey with them,
855.641	because I wouldn't be here
855.641	if it weren't for them.
859.774	my lungs slowly return
859.774	to their normal volume.
862.045	Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.
864.416	Five meters below the surface,
864.416	I start to breathe out,
867.988	so that as soon as I get
867.988	to the surface all I do is breathe in.
871.277	And so I arrive at the surface.
873.544	(Breathing in)
879.667	Air floods into my lungs.
881.685	It's like being born again, a relief.
884.896	It feels good.
886.075	Though the journey was extraordinary,
887.965	I do need to feel those small
887.965	oxygen molecules fueling my body.
892.385	It's an extraordinary sensation,
892.385	but at the same time it's traumatizing.
895.994	It's a shock to the system,
895.994	as you can you imagine.
898.415	I go from complete darkness
898.415	to the light of day,
901.212	from the near-silence of the depths
901.212	to the commotion up top.
906.388	In terms of touch, I go from the soft,
906.388	velvety feeling of the water,
910.945	to air rubbing across my face.
913.271	In terms of smell,
916.272	there is air rushing into my lungs.
918.932	And in return, my lungs open up.
921.368	They were completely squashed
921.368	just 90 seconds ago,
923.935	and now, they've opened up again.
925.647	So all of this affects
925.647	quite a lot of things.
929.507	I need a few seconds to come back,
931.851	"and to feel ""all there"" again."
933.454	But that needs to happen quickly,
935.06	because the judges are there
935.06	to verify my performance;
938.196	I need to show them
938.196	I'm in perfect physical condition.
940.805	You saw in the video,
940.805	I was doing a so-called exit protocol.
943.681	Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds
943.681	to take off my nose clip,
948.684	give this signal and say
948.684	"(English) ""I am OK."""
951.989	Plus, you need to be bilingual.
953.511	(Laughter)
954.977	On top of everything --
956.167	that's not very nice.
958.897	Once the protocol is completed,
958.897	the judges show me a white card,
962.572	and that's when the joy starts.
964.501	I can finally celebrate
964.501	what has just happened.
967.976	So, the journey I've just described to you
970.278	is a more extreme version of free diving.
973.921	Luckily, it's far from just that.
976.136	For the past few years,
977.367	I've been trying to show
977.367	another side of free diving,
980.078	because the media mainly talks
980.078	about competitions and records.
983.209	But free diving is more than just that.
985.114	It's about being at ease in the water.
987.066	It's extremely beautiful,
987.066	very poetic and artistic.
990.074	So my wife and I decided to film it
992.162	and try to show another side of it,
995.284	mostly to make people want
995.284	to go into the water.
998.089	Let me show you some images
998.089	to finish my story.
1003.854	It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.
1006.06	(Music)
1007.236	I'd like you to know that if one day
1007.236	you try to stop breathing,
1012.319	you'll realize that
1012.319	when you stop breathing,
1014.639	you stop thinking, too.
1017.355	It calms your mind.
1019.934	Today, in the 21st century,
1019.934	we're under so much pressure.
1023.244	Our minds are overworked,
1023.244	we think at a million miles an hour,
1026.295	we're always stressed.
1028.199	Being able to free dive
1028.199	lets you, just for a moment,
1031.227	relax your mind.
1033.362	Holding your breath underwater
1035.378	means giving yourself the chance
1035.378	to experience weightlessness.
1039.398	It means being underwater, floating,
1042.376	with your body completely relaxed,
1042.376	letting go of all your tensions.
1046.223	This is our plight in the 21st century:
1048.126	our backs hurt, our necks hurt,
1048.126	everything hurts,
1050.467	because we're stressed
1050.467	and tense all the time.
1052.7	But when you're in the water,
1054.153	you let yourself float,
1054.153	as if you were in space.
1057.151	You let yourself go completely.
1058.859	It's an extraordinary feeling.
1060.376	You can finally get in touch
1060.376	with your body, mind and spirit.
1066.476	Everything feels better, all at once.
1069.952	Learning how to free dive is also
1069.952	about learning to breathe correctly.
1074.718	We breathe with our first breath
1074.718	at birth, up until our last one.
1079.2	Breathing gives rhythm to our lives.
1082.778	Learning how to breathe better
1082.778	is learning how to live better.
1086.746	Holding your breath in the sea,
1086.746	not necessarily at 100 meters,
1089.905	but maybe at two or three,
1091.204	putting on your goggles,
1091.204	a pair of flippers,
1093.294	means you can go see another world,
1095.014	another universe, completely magical.
1097.096	You can see little fish, seaweed,
1097.096	the flora and fauna,
1100.525	you can watch it all discreetly,
1102.867	sliding underwater, looking around,
1102.867	and coming back to the surface,
1106.177	leaving no trace.
1108.096	It's an amazing feeling
1108.096	to become one with nature like that.
1113.219	And if I may say one more thing,
1116.509	holding your breath, being in the water,
1116.509	finding this underwater world --
1121.7	it's all about connecting with yourself.
1123.693	You heard me talk a lot
1123.693	about the body's memory
1128.621	that dates back millions of years,
1128.621	to our marine origins.
1131.546	The day you get back into the water,
1134.236	when you hold your breath
1134.236	for a few seconds,
1136.751	you will reconnect with those origins.
1140.243	And I guarantee
1141.786	it's absolute magic.
1143.151	I encourage you to try it out.
1144.628	Thank you.
1145.818	(Applause)
