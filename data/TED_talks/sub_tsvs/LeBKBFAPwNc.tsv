12.11	I'm a veteran of the starship Enterprise.
16.539	I soared through the galaxy
19.899	driving a huge starship
22.635	with a crew made up of people
24.034	from all over this world,
26.97	many different races, many different cultures,
30.42	many different heritages,
32.264	all working together,
34.221	and our mission was to explore strange new worlds,
37.866	to seek out new life and new civilizations,
41.742	to boldly go where no one has gone before.
46.705	Well —
48.19	(Applause) —
54.906	I am the grandson of immigrants from Japan
59.561	who went to America,
61.692	boldly going to a strange new world,
65.177	seeking new opportunities.
68.013	My mother was born in Sacramento, California.
71.499	My father was a San Franciscan.
73.94	They met and married in Los Angeles,
76.685	and I was born there.
80.406	I was four years old
82.659	when Pearl Harbor was bombed
84.489	on December 7, 1941 by Japan,
89.231	and overnight, the world was plunged
93.24	into a world war.
96.674	America suddenly was swept up
99.627	by hysteria.
103.551	Japanese-Americans,
105.025	American citizens of Japanese ancestry,
108.185	were looked on
109.52	with suspicion and fear
113.542	and with outright hatred
116.514	simply because we happened to look like
119.174	the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.
121.87	And the hysteria grew and grew
125.34	until in February 1942,
128.93	the president of the United States,
131.074	Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
133.244	ordered all Japanese-Americans
135.917	on the West Coast of America
138.026	to be summarily rounded up
140.942	with no charges, with no trial,
144.147	with no due process.
146.574	Due process, this is a core pillar
149.165	of our justice system.
150.778	That all disappeared.
153.207	We were to be rounded up
155.306	and imprisoned in 10 barbed-wire prison camps
159.567	in some of the most desolate places in America:
163.759	the blistering hot desert of Arizona,
167.186	the sultry swamps of Arkansas,
170.651	the wastelands of Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,
174.344	and two of the most desolate places in California.
179.778	On April 20th, I celebrated my fifth birthday,
184.546	and just a few weeks after my birthday,
188.163	my parents got my younger brother,
190.934	my baby sister and me
192.992	up very early one morning,
195.021	and they dressed us hurriedly.
198.246	My brother and I were in the living room
200.24	looking out the front window,
203.303	and we saw two soldiers marching up our driveway.
207.147	They carried bayonets on their rifles.
211.669	They stomped up the front porch
214.47	and banged on the door.
216.989	My father answered it,
219.094	and the soldiers ordered us out of our home.
223.835	My father gave my brother and me
226.16	small luggages to carry,
227.902	and we walked out and stood on the driveway
231.418	waiting for our mother to come out,
234.413	and when my mother finally came out,
237.728	she had our baby sister in one arm,
240.791	a huge duffel bag in the other,
244.163	and tears were streaming down both her cheeks.
249.305	I will never be able to forget that scene.
253.092	It is burned into my memory.
257.44	We were taken from our home
260.231	and loaded on to train cars
262.749	with other Japanese-American families.
265.759	There were guards stationed
267.239	at both ends of each car,
270.699	as if we were criminals.
273.398	We were taken two thirds of
273.398	the way across the country,
277.555	rocking on that train for four days and three nights,
281.767	to the swamps of Arkansas.
285.502	I still remember the barbed wire fence
287.515	that confined me.
290.125	I remember the tall sentry tower
292.712	with the machine guns pointed at us.
296.965	I remember the searchlight that followed me
299.654	when I made the night runs
301.093	from my barrack to the latrine.
304.344	But to five-year-old me,
306.504	I thought it was kind of nice that they'd lit the way
308.8	for me to pee.
312.054	I was a child,
313.947	too young to understand the circumstances
316.572	of my being there.
319.003	Children are amazingly adaptable.
323.769	What would be grotesquely abnormal
327.326	became my normality
330.18	in the prisoner of war camps.
333.794	It became routine for me to line up three times a day
337.484	to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall.
342.231	It became normal for me to go with my father
344.436	to bathe in a mass shower.
347.384	Being in a prison, a barbed-wire prison camp,
351.645	became my normality.
355.269	When the war ended,
356.91	we were released,
358.962	and given a one-way ticket
360.968	to anywhere in the United States.
364.534	My parents decided to go back home
366.435	to Los Angeles,
369.003	but Los Angeles was not a welcoming place.
373.384	We were penniless.
374.78	Everything had been taken from us,
377.256	and the hostility was intense.
379.689	Our first home was on Skid Row
382.54	in the lowest part of our city,
387.493	living with derelicts, drunkards
390.06	and crazy people,
392.08	the stench of urine all over,
394.674	on the street, in the alley,
397.787	in the hallway.
400.108	It was a horrible experience,
402.81	and for us kids, it was terrorizing.
406.226	I remember once
408.738	a drunkard came staggering down,
411.69	fell down right in front of us,
414.207	and threw up.
415.857	"My baby sister said, ""Mama, let's go back home,"""
421.174	because behind barbed wires
423.48	was for us
426.096	home.
428.939	My parents worked hard
430.59	to get back on their feet.
432.547	We had lost everything.
433.666	They were at the middle of their lives
436.17	and starting all over.
437.805	They worked their fingers to the bone,
440.354	and ultimately they were able
443.632	to get the capital together to buy
446.12	a three-bedroom home in a nice neighborhood.
449.285	And I was a teenager,
450.876	and I became very curious
452.67	about my childhood imprisonment.
455.94	I had read civics books that told me about
458.98	the ideals of American democracy.
462.691	All men are created equal,
465.356	we have an inalienable right
468.267	to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
473.206	and I couldn't quite make that fit
475.44	with what I knew to be my childhood imprisonment.
478.829	I read history books,
480.91	and I couldn't find anything about it.
483.781	And so I engaged my father after dinner
487.685	in long, sometimes heated conversations.
492.245	We had many, many conversations like that,
495.013	and what I got from them
497.792	was my father's wisdom.
499.982	He was the one that suffered the most
502.294	under those conditions of imprisonment,
505.76	and yet he understood American democracy.
509.737	He told me that our democracy
512.464	is a people's democracy,
514.571	and it can be as great as the people can be,
517.63	but it is also as fallible as people are.
522.821	He told me that American democracy
525.081	is vitally dependent on good people
529.077	who cherish the ideals of our system
533.048	and actively engage in the process
536.548	of making our democracy work.
539.278	And he took me to a campaign headquarters —
543.343	the governor of Illinois was
543.343	running for the presidency —
547.134	and introduced me to American electoral politics.
551.822	And he also told me about
554.183	young Japanese-Americans
555.961	during the Second World War.
559.021	When Pearl Harbor was bombed,
561.825	young Japanese-Americans,
561.825	like all young Americans,
564.806	rushed to their draft board
567.304	to volunteer to fight for our country.
570.712	That act of patriotism
573.144	was answered with a slap in the face.
577.462	We were denied service,
580.466	and categorized as enemy non-alien.
586.328	It was outrageous to be called an enemy
589.372	when you're volunteering to fight for your country,
592.59	"but that was compounded with the word ""non-alien,"""
596.96	which is a word that means
600.07	"""citizen"" in the negative."
604.111	"They even took the word ""citizen"" away from us,"
607.761	and imprisoned them for a whole year.
612.389	And then the government realized
614.377	that there's a wartime manpower shortage,
618.747	and as suddenly as they'd rounded us up,
623.126	they opened up the military for service
625.253	by young Japanese-Americans.
628.171	It was totally irrational,
630.838	but the amazing thing,
633.072	the astounding thing,
635.429	is that thousands of young
637.382	Japanese-American men and women
640.34	again went from behind those barbed-wire fences,
644.303	put on the same uniform as that of our guards,
647.76	leaving their families in imprisonment,
651.288	to fight for this country.
653.602	They said that they were going to fight
655.563	not only to get their families out
658.829	from behind those barbed-wire fences,
661.387	but because they cherished the very ideal
664.617	of what our government stands for,
666.84	should stand for,
668.731	and that was being abrogated
671.232	by what was being done.
675.145	All men are created equal.
677.479	And they went to fight for this country.
681.3	They were put into a segregated
682.98	all Japanese-American unit
685.202	and sent to the battlefields of Europe,
687.826	and they threw themselves into it.
690.897	They fought with amazing,
693.742	incredible courage and valor.
697.2	They were sent out on the most dangerous missions
700.962	and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate
703.843	of any unit proportionally.
707.649	There is one battle that illustrates that.
710.944	It was a battle for the Gothic Line.
713.988	The Germans were embedded
716.29	in this mountain hillside,
718.877	rocky hillside,
720.449	in impregnable caves,
722.929	and three allied battalions
726.2	had been pounding away at it
727.978	for six months,
729.462	and they were stalemated.
731.892	The 442nd was called in
734.786	to add to the fight,
738.108	but the men of the 442nd
740.274	came up with a unique
743.434	but dangerous idea:
745.734	The backside of the mountain
747.529	was a sheer rock cliff.
750.19	The Germans thought an attack from the backside
753.599	would be impossible.
756.109	The men of the 442nd decided to do the impossible.
760.48	On a dark, moonless night,
764.223	they began scaling that rock wall,
768.471	a drop of more than 1,000 feet,
772.09	in full combat gear.
774.737	They climbed all night long
777.581	on that sheer cliff.
782.279	In the darkness,
784.232	some lost their handhold
786.312	or their footing
787.925	and they fell to their deaths
790.122	in the ravine below.
792.203	They all fell silently.
796.63	Not a single one cried out,
799.195	so as not to give their position away.
802.427	The men climbed for eight hours straight,
806.285	and those who made it to the top
809.404	stayed there until the first break of light,
813.886	and as soon as light broke,
816.965	they attacked.
818.558	The Germans were surprised,
820.212	and they took the hill
821.96	and broke the Gothic Line.
824.97	A six-month stalemate
827.258	was broken by the 442nd
829.463	in 32 minutes.
832.444	It was an amazing act,
836.08	and when the war ended,
838.93	the 442nd returned to the United States
842.147	as the most decorated unit
844.563	of the entire Second World War.
847.48	They were greeted back on the White House Lawn
850.21	by President Truman, who said to them,
852.816	"""You fought not only the enemy"
856.074	"but prejudice, and you won."""
860.694	They are my heroes.
864.29	They clung to their belief
867.337	in the shining ideals of this country,
870.389	and they proved that being an American
874.68	is not just for some people,
877.89	that race is not how we define being an American.
883.323	They expanded what it means to be an American,
886.9	including Japanese-Americans
889.224	that were feared and suspected and hated.
893.398	They were change agents,
896.609	and they left for me
899.091	a legacy.
901.308	They are my heroes
903.097	and my father is my hero,
905.448	who understood democracy
907.258	and guided me through it.
911.329	They gave me a legacy,
913.819	and with that legacy comes a responsibility,
917.181	and I am dedicated
919.597	to making my country
921.586	an even better America,
924.79	to making our government
927	an even truer democracy,
930.497	and because of the heroes that I have
934.237	and the struggles that we've gone through,
937.859	I can stand before you
939.858	as a gay Japanese-American,
942.717	but even more than that,
945.184	I am a proud American.
949.192	Thank you very much.
951.379	(Applause)
