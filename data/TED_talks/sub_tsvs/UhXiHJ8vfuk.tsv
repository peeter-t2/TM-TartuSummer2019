26	What I'd like to start off with is an observation,
28	which is that if I've learned anything over the last year,
30	it's that the supreme irony
32	of publishing a book about slowness
34	is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
37	I seem to spend most of my time these days
39	zipping from city to city, studio to studio,
42	interview to interview,
44	serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.
46	Because everyone these days
48	wants to know how to slow down,
50	but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...
53	so I did a spot on CNN the other day
55	where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
59	And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?
61	Because that's kind of the world that we live in now,
63	a world stuck in fast-forward.
66	A world obsessed with speed,
68	with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more
71	into less and less time.
73	Every moment of the day feels like
75	a race against the clock.
77	To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is
79	in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again --
81	"""These days even instant gratification takes too long."" (Laughter)"
84	And
86	if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?
88	No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.
91	We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.
94	And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.
97	And even things that are by their very nature slow --
100	we try and speed them up too.
103	So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym
105	that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.
108	And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
111	So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals
114	who want to, you know, salute the sun,
116	but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
119	I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,
121	and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
123	But there's a very serious point,
125	and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,
128	we often lose sight of the damage
131	that this roadrunner form of living does to us.
134	We're so marinated in the culture of speed
137	that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes
139	on every aspect of our lives --
141	on our health, our diet, our work,
143	our relationships, the environment and our community.
146	And sometimes it takes
148	a wake-up call, doesn't it,
150	to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,
153	instead of actually living them; that we're
155	living the fast life, instead of the good life.
157	And I think for many people, that wake-up call
159	takes the form of an illness.
161	You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,
164	"""I can't take it anymore,"" and throws in the towel."
166	Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke
168	because we haven't had the time, or the patience,
170	or the tranquility,
172	to be with the other person, to listen to them.
174	And my wake-up call came when I started
176	reading bedtime stories to my son,
179	and I found that at the end of day,
181	I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know,
184	"I'd be speed reading ""The Cat In The Hat."""
186	I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here,
188	paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page,
190	and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.
193	And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,
196	the most tender moment of the day,
198	when a dad sits down to read to his son,
201	became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,
204	a clash between my speed
206	and his slowness.
209	And this went on for some time,
211	until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article
213	with timesaving tips for fast people.
215	And one of them made reference to a series of books called
217	"""The One-Minute Bedtime Story."""
219	And I wince saying those words now,
222	but my first reaction at the time was very different.
224	My first reflex was to say,
226	"""Hallelujah -- what a great idea!"
228	"This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."""
231	But thankfully,
233	a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,
236	and I took a step back, and I thought,
238	"""Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?"
240	Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared
242	"to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"""
246	And I put away the newspaper --
248	and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there,
250	and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.
252	I just thought, and I thought long and hard.
255	And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.
258	I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,
261	and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
264	And I had two questions in my head.
266	The first was, how did we get so fast?
269	And the second is, is it possible,
271	or even desirable, to slow down?
274	Now, if you think about
276	how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.
279	You think of, you know, urbanization,
281	consumerism, the workplace, technology.
284	But I think if you cut through
286	those forces, you get to what might be the deeper
289	driver, the nub of the question,
292	which is how we think about time itself.
294	In other cultures, time is cyclical.
297	It's seen as moving in great,
300	unhurried circles.
302	It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
304	Whereas in the West, time is linear.
306	It's a finite resource;
308	it's always draining away.
310	You either use it, or lose it.
312	"""Time is money,"" as Benjamin Franklin said."
315	And I think what that does to us psychologically
317	is it creates an equation.
319	Time is scarce, so what do we do?
321	Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?
323	We try and do more and more with less and less time.
325	We turn every moment of every day
327	into a race to the finish line --
329	a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,
332	but a finish line nonetheless.
334	And I guess that the question is,
336	is it possible to break free from that mindset?
338	And thankfully, the answer is yes, because
340	what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is
342	a global backlash against this culture that
345	tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
348	Right across the world, people are doing the unthinkable:
351	they're slowing down, and finding that,
353	although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,
356	the opposite turns out to be true:
358	that by slowing down at the right moments,
360	people find that they do everything better.
362	They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;
365	they work better; they live better.
368	And, in this kind of cauldron
371	of moments and places and acts of deceleration,
374	lie what a lot of people now refer to as
377	"the ""International Slow Movement."""
379	Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy,
384	I'll just give you a very quick overview of
387	what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,
390	many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
392	Started in Italy, but has spread across the world,
394	and now has 100,000 members
396	in 50 countries.
398	And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,
401	which is that we get more pleasure and more health
404	from our food when we
406	cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
410	I think also the explosion of
412	the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,
415	are other illustrations
418	of the fact that people are desperate to get away from
421	eating and cooking and cultivating their food
423	on an industrial timetable.
425	They want to get back to slower rhythms.
428	And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something
431	called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,
434	but has spread right across Europe and beyond.
436	And in this, towns
438	begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,
441	so that people are encouraged to slow down
444	and smell the roses and connect with one another.
446	So they might curb traffic,
448	or put in a park bench, or some green space.
451	And in some ways, these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts,
454	because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,
457	it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
459	It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,
462	that we believe that in the 21st century,
468	In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned
470	with the kind of quick-fix mentality
472	you find in conventional medicine.
474	And millions of them around the world are turning
476	to complementary and alternative forms of medicine,
479	which tend to tap into sort of
481	slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.
484	Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,
487	and I personally doubt that the coffee enema
490	will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.
493	But other treatments
495	such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,
498	clearly have some kind of benefit.
500	And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere
502	are starting to study these things to find out how they work,
505	and what we might learn from them.
507	Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around, isn't there?
509	I was coming to --
512	well -- no pun intended there.
515	I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,
518	and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,
520	a men's magazine, and it said on the front,
522	"""How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."""
525	So, you know, even sex
527	is on a stopwatch these days.
529	Now, you know,
531	I like a quickie as much as the next person,
533	but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained
536	from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.
538	You know, you tap into that -- those deeper,
541	sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,
544	and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.
547	You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
549	I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,
552	"when they sang the praises of ""a lover with a slow hand."""
555	Now, we all laughed at Sting
557	a few years ago when he went Tantric,
559	but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages
562	flocking to workshops, or maybe just
564	on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways
567	to put on the brakes and have better sex.
570	And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know
572	where to find their pleasure --
574	they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.
578	The workplace.
580	Right across much of the world --
582	North America being a notable exception --
584	working hours have been coming down.
586	And Europe is an example of that,
588	and people finding that their quality of life improves
591	as they're working less, and also
593	that their hourly productivity goes up.
595	Now, clearly there are problems with
597	the 35-hour workweek in France --
599	too much, too soon, too rigid.
601	But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,
604	are showing that it's possible
606	to have a kick-ass economy
608	without being a workaholic.
610	And Norway, Sweden,
612	Denmark and Finland now rank
614	among the top six most competitive nations on Earth,
617	and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American
619	weep with envy.
621	And if you go beyond sort of the country level,
624	down at the micro-company level,
626	more and more companies now are realizing
627	that they need to allow their staff
629	either to work fewer hours or just to unplug --
631	to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,
635	to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back --
639	mobile phones,
641	during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge
644	and for the brain to slide into that
646	kind of creative mode of thought.
650	It's not just, though, these days,
653	adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.
656	I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,
659	and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they
661	race around with more homework,
663	more tutoring, more extracurriculars
665	than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.
668	And some of the most heartrending emails
670	that I get on my website
672	are actually from adolescents
675	hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me
677	to write to their parents,
679	to help them slow down, to help them get off this
682	full-throttle treadmill.
685	But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,
687	and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States
689	are now banding together and banning extracurriculars
692	on a particular day of the month, so that people can,
694	you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
698	Homework is another thing. There are homework bans
702	springing up all over the developed world
704	in schools which had been piling on the homework for years,
707	and now they're discovering that less can be more.
709	So there was a case up in Scotland recently
711	where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school
713	banned homework
715	for everyone under the age of 13,
717	and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,
719	"""What are you -- you know, our kids will fall"" -- the headmaster said,"
721	"""No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."""
724	And just this last month, the exam results came in,
727	and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent
730	on average last year.
732	And I think what's very revealing is that
734	the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason
737	that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,
739	are starting to notice the caliber of students
742	coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;
745	they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,
748	to the point that would make your eyes water.
750	But they lack spark; they lack
752	the ability to think creatively and think outside --
754	they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,
757	and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message
759	to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.
762	And in Harvard, for instance, they send out
765	a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen --
768	telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,
771	if they put on the brakes, if they do less,
773	but give time to things, the time that things need,
776	to enjoy them, to savor them.
778	And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
780	And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think --
782	"""Slow Down!"" -- with an exclamation mark on the end."
785	So wherever you look, the message, it seems to me, is the same:
788	that less is very often more,
790	that slower is very often
793	better. But that said, of course,
795	it's not that easy to slow down, is it?
797	I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket
799	while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,
801	and that's true, but that's not all of it.
803	I was actually en route to a dinner
805	held by Slow Food at the time.
807	And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.
810	And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,
813	you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.
815	(Laughter)
818	But why is it so hard to slow down?
820	I think there are various reasons.
822	One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.
825	It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.
828	I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension --
830	that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off
832	from the bigger, deeper questions.
834	We fill our head with distraction, with busyness,
836	so that we don't have to ask,
838	am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?
841	Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?
845	Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --
847	why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo
850	that we've erected against slowing down.
853	"""Slow"" is a dirty word in our culture."
855	"It's a byword for ""lazy,"" ""slacker,"""
857	for being somebody who gives up.
859	"You know, ""he's a bit slow."" It's actually synonymous"
861	with being stupid.
864	I guess what the Slow Movement -- the purpose of the Slow Movement,
866	or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,
868	and to say that yes,
871	sometimes slow is not the answer,
873	"that there is such a thing as ""bad slow."""
875	You know, I got stuck on the M25,
877	which is a ring road around London, recently,
879	and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,
881	that's really bad slow.
883	But the new idea,
885	the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,
887	"is that there is such a thing as ""good slow,"" too."
889	And good slow is, you know, taking the time
891	to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
894	Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles
897	in the office to make the best decision
899	at work.
901	Or even simply just taking the time
903	to slow down
905	and savor your life.
907	Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting
910	about all of this stuff that's happened around the book
913	since it came out, is the reaction to it.
916	And I knew that when my book on slowness came out,
918	it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,
920	but it's also been taken up, with great gusto,
923	by the corporate world -- you know,
925	business press, but also
927	big companies and leadership organizations.
929	Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,
932	are starting to realize that there's too much
934	speed in the system,
936	there's too much busyness, and it's time to find,
939	or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.
943	Another encouraging sign, I think,
945	is that it's not just in the developed world
947	that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,
950	in countries that are on the verge of making that leap
952	into first world status -- China, Brazil,
954	Thailand, Poland, and so on --
956	these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,
959	many people in them, and there's a debate going on
962	in their media, on the streets.
964	Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,
966	"""Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,"
969	"but we're not so sure about that."""
971	So all of that said, is it,
973	I guess, is it possible?
976	That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible
979	to slow down? And
981	I'm happy to be able to say to you
983	that the answer is a resounding yes.
985	And I present myself as Exhibit A,
988	a kind of reformed and rehabilitated
991	speed-aholic.
993	I still love speed. You know, I live in London,
995	and I work as a journalist,
997	and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,
999	and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.
1001	I play squash and ice hockey,
1003	two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.
1007	But I've also, over the last year or so,
1010	got in touch with my inner tortoise.
1012	(Laughter)
1013	And what that means is that
1015	I no longer
1018	overload myself gratuitously.
1021	My default mode is no longer
1024	to be a rush-aholic.
1027	I no longer hear
1029	time's winged chariot drawing near,
1031	or at least not as much as I did before.
1033	I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
1037	And the upshot of all of that is that
1039	I actually feel a lot happier, healthier,
1042	more productive than I ever have.
1045	I feel like I'm living
1047	my life rather than actually just racing through it.
1051	And perhaps, the most important
1053	measure of the success of this
1055	is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,
1058	richer, stronger.
1060	And for me, I guess, the litmus test
1063	for whether this would work, and what it would mean,
1065	was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where
1068	the journey began. And there too the news is
1071	rosy. You know,
1073	at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.
1075	I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,
1077	so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,
1079	and I just slow down to his pace and we read.
1083	And because children have their own tempo and internal clock,
1086	they don't do quality time,
1088	where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
1090	They need you to move at their rhythm.
1093	I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,
1095	"my son will suddenly say, ""You know,"
1097	"something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."""
1099	And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
1102	And I now find that bedtime stories
1105	used to be
1107	a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,
1110	because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
1112	It's become my reward at the end of the day,
1114	something I really cherish.
1116	And I have a kind of Hollywood ending
1118	to my talk this afternoon,
1120	which goes a little bit like this:
1122	a few months ago, I was getting ready to go on
1125	another book tour, and I had my bags packed.
1128	I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,
1131	and my son came down the stairs and
1133	he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.
1135	He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,
1137	and put a sticker of his favorite
1140	character, Tintin, on the front.
1142	And he said to me,
1144	or he handed this to me, and I read it,
1146	"and it said, ""To Daddy, love Benjamin."""
1148	"And I thought, ""Aw, that's really sweet."
1151	"Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"""
1154	"And he said, ""No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card"
1156	"for being the best story reader in the world."""
1158	"And I thought, ""Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."""
1161	Thank you very much.
