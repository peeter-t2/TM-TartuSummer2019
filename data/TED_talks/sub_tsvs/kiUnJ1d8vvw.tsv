12.714	Hey guys.
14.041	It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,
15.811	because that was, like, I loved it,
17.751	and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill
23.071	"and I was like, ""Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."""
25.792	And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter)
29.943	And it worked really well there.
32.875	And you know, it had a profound effect on me.
36.696	It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,
38.924	the way the world works can be changed,
41.796	and it can be changed by me in these small ways.
43.947	And my relationship to
45.661	especially human-made objects
47.153	which someone else said they work like this,
49.038	well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.
52.188	And so, about 20 years later,
54.686	I didn't realize the full effect of this,
56.194	but I went to Costa Rica
57.971	and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,
60.138	and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,
63.64	and they could make beds out of trees,
66.809	and they could -- I watched this woman for three days.
69.043	I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,
72.29	these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together
75.427	and make little thicker threads, like strings,
78.145	and she would weave the strings together,
80.966	and as the materiality of this exact very bag
84.446	formed before my eyes over those three days,
87.334	the materiality of the way the world works,
90.641	of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,
93.115	because I realized that this bag and these clothes
96.463	and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,
98.847	everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock
102.98	or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,
105.324	maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.
109.235	And so I had to start studying,
111.427	who is it that's making these decisions?
113.137	Who's making these things? How did they make them?
114.946	What stops us from making them?
116.44	Because this is how reality is created.
119.345	So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,
121.932	and I was studying the maker movement
124.481	and makers and creativity.
126.031	And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís
128.158	doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.
131.203	So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,
134.548	where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out
137.8	and willing to try anything.
139.287	"So I said, ""Let's go into the woods near this stream"
141.58	and just put stuff together, you know, make something,
143.609	I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.
146.196	We won't bring anything with us.
147.845	And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults
150.364	and teens to do.
151.452	Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,
154.587	and the shape of an oak leaf being made
157.171	by other small oak leaves being put together.
160.365	A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.
163.102	The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom
165.798	being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.
169.17	And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects
172.735	like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade
175.962	and put in a circle like a wreath.
177.806	And the creator of this, he said,
180.422	"""This is fire. I call this fire."""
182.092	"And someone asked him, ""How do you get those sticks"
184.319	"to stay on that tree?"""
186.08	"And he's like, ""I don't know, but I can show you."""
189.19	"And I'm like, ""Wow, that's really amazing."
190.822	"He doesn't know, but he can show you."""
192.205	So his hands know and his intuition knows,
194.785	but sometimes what we know gets in the way
197.641	of what could be, especially
199.678	when it comes to the human-made, human-built world.
202.605	We think we already know how something works,
204.902	so we can't imagine how it could work.
207.045	We know how it's supposed to work,
208.391	so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible.
211.798	So kids don't have as hard of a time with this,
215.645	and I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.
218.93	I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,
221.138	"""Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon."
223.315	I'm going to give you some building blocks
225.648	and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,
228.798	"so it's totally legit."""
230.612	But he doesn't really know what to do with these.
232.886	I didn't show him.
234.458	"And so he's like, ""Okay, I'll just mess around with this."""
235.966	This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.
239.869	Just going to try to put them in shapes
242.341	and push on them and stuff.
244.117	And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism
246.781	where you can almost launch and catapult objects around,
250.451	and he enlists us in helping him.
252.716	And at this point, I'm starting to wonder,
254.651	what kind of tools can we give people,
257.452	especially adults, who know too much,
260.406	so that they can see the world as malleable,
262.697	so they see themselves as agents of change
264.174	in their everyday lives.
265.636	Because the most advanced scientists are really
268.122	just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,
270.854	pushing what matter can do,
272.031	the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,
274.812	and any sufficiently complicated task,
276.758	whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child --
279.683	anything that's complicated --
281.369	comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,
283.896	and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,
287.222	"""Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this."
289.35	I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.
292.029	"I'm going to use them a different way."""
294.214	So let me show you a little demo.
299.013	This is a little piano circuit right in here,
303.575	and this is an ordinary paintbrush
305.666	that I smashed it together with. (Beeping)
308.661	And so, with some ketchup,
310.524	— (musical notes) —
313.998	and then I can kind of
315.287	— (musical notes) —
321.782	(Laughter) (Applause)
323.741	And that's awesome, right?
326.464	But this is not what's awesome.
327.774	What's awesome is what happens
329.336	when you give the piano circuit to people.
332.755	A pencil is not just a pencil.
334.138	Look what it has in the middle of it.
335.806	That's a wire running down the middle,
338.558	and not only is it a wire,
339.999	if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack
342.359	into the middle of a pencil,
344.298	and you can lay out wire on the page, too,
347.218	and get electrical current to run through it.
349.639	And so you can kind of hack a pencil,
351.521	just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.
357.042	And the electricity runs through your body too.
358.982	And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.
362.328	You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.
365.782	All you do is connect to the bristles,
367.589	and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,
369.581	and the person's body conducts,
372.15	and leather is great to paint on,
374.149	and then you can start hooking to everything,
376.854	even the kitchen sink.
377.849	The metal in the sink is conductive.
379.768	Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.
383.321	(Musical notes)
388.303	And you can even hook to the trees.
389.557	Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,
392.953	and you can use those together.
394.727	So — (Laughter) —
396.183	I took this to those same teens, because those teens are
399.338	really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.
401.795	I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
404.778	And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,
408.799	and as the hula hoop traveled around her body,
411.212	she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.
413.983	You can see her pointing to it in the picture.
416.024	And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,
418.44	it would connect two little pieces of copper tape,
420.623	and it would make a sound, and the next sound,
422.359	and it would loop the same sounds over and over again.
424.895	I ran these workshops everywhere.
426.824	In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl
429.834	made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan
433.496	and some electrical tape and hot glue.
435.28	And professional designers were making artifacts
437.361	with this thing strapped onto it.
439.14	And big companies like Intel
441.354	or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,
445.007	were inviting me to give workshops,
446.559	just to practice this idea of smashing electronics
448.954	and everyday objects together.
450.786	And then we came up with this idea
453.447	to not just use electronics,
455.235	but let's just smash computers with everyday objects
458.207	and see how that goes over.
460.767	And so I just want to do a quick demo.
464.366	So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,
466.991	and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.
469.89	So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.
473.923	And I'll just hook up the forward arrow.
476.56	You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.
480.001	And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.
483.647	And now, if I touch this piece of pizza,
486.171	the slides that I showed you before should go forward.
489.235	And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it
492.667	to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,
495.939	now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,
498.96	so I should be able to go forwards and backwards
501.16	and forwards and backwards. Awesome.
504.264	"And so we're like, ""We gotta put a video out about this."""
506.808	Because no one really believed that this was important
509.376	or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.
512.355	So we made a video to prove that
514.04	there's lots of stuff you can do.
515.58	You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh
517.612	and just Google for game controllers.
521.546	Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.
524.233	And you can literally draw joysticks
525.934	and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)
533.057	And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?
536.56	Well, if you take those out, they hold water great,
538.768	but you can totally cut your toes,
540.904	so yeah, just be careful.
543.592	You know the Happiness Project, where the experts
546.464	are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?
549.222	Well, I think it's cool,
550.432	but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.
552.775	It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.
555.858	We should all be participating
557.833	in changing the way the world works together.
559.753	Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.
561.94	Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.
565.124	"Hover the mouse over the ""take a photo"" button,"
567.184	and you've got a little cat photo booth.
568.759	And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.
571.448	If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.
574.536	And so we put it up on Kickstarter,
577.437	and hundreds of people bought it in the first day.
580.432	And then 30 days later,
584.725	And then what the best part is, we started getting
586.84	a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.
590.912	"So this is ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by eating lunch,"
593.574	including drinking Listerine.
595.648	And we actually sent this guy materials.
597.114	"We're like, ""We're sponsoring you, man."
598.595	"You're, like, a pro maker."""
600.705	Okay, just wait for this one. This is good.
604.32	(Laughter)
606.139	(Applause)
609.624	And these guys at the exploratorium are
611.501	playing house plants as if they were drums.
616.723	And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.
620.297	And then this brother -- look at this diagram.
622.649	"See where it says ""sister""?"
623.937	I love when people put humans on the diagram.
626.393	I always add humans to any technical --
628.861	if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.
630.993	And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister
635.463	so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,
637.536	jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.
640.281	And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.
646.134	And this is fun,
648.579	and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?
651.466	But it's also very serious because
653.986	all this accessibility stuff started coming up,
656.154	where people can't use computers, necessarily.
659.11	Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy
661.802	and he can't use a normal keyboard.
663.674	And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford
667.245	to buy all these custom controllers.
669.087	And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make
670.713	these gloves to allow him to navigate the web.
673.607	And a huge eruption of discussion
675.767	around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.
678.722	We didn't plan for that at all.
680.623	And then all these professional musicians started using it,
683.431	like at Coachella, just this weekend
685.559	Jurassic 5 was using this onstage,
688.711	and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,
692.412	and he put this up last month.
694.423	And I love the carrot on the turntable.
696.527	"(Music: Massive Attack — ""Teardrop"")"
703.355	Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)
706.101	And when this started to get serious,
707.523	I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,
710.95	because otherwise people are going to be getting this
712.652	and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,
714.891	and governments will be crumbling,
716.183	and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.
718.542	And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid
720.871	"of the box, it says, ""The world is a construction kit."""
723.731	And as you start to mess around this way,
725.578	I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see
728.677	the landscape of your everyday life
730.729	a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,
733.622	and a little bit more like you could participate
735.861	in designing the future of the way the world works.
738.325	And so next time you're on an escalator
742.113	and you drop an M&amp;M by accident,
743.789	you know, maybe that's an M&amp;M surfboard, not an escalator,
746.949	so don't pick it up right away.
748.156	Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets
750.344	and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.
753.653	I used to want to design a utopian society
758.615	or a perfect world or something like that.
760.987	But as I'm kind of getting older
762.441	and kind of messing with all this stuff,
764.017	I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world
766.785	really can't be designed by one person
768.801	or even by a million experts.
770.357	It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,
773.525	each following their own passions,
775.933	and each kind of like a mosaic coming up
778.121	and creating this world in their backyards
779.622	and in their kitchens.
781.13	And that's the world I really want to live in.
783.696	Thank you.
785.08	(Applause)
