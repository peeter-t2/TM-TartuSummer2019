12.84	I believe that the secret to producing
12.84	extremely drought-tolerant crops,
17.08	which should go some way
17.08	to providing food security in the world,
20.32	lies in resurrection plants,
23.04	pictured here, in an extremely
23.04	droughted state.
26.2	You might think
26.2	that these plants look dead,
29.08	but they're not.
30.4	Give them water,
31.88	and they will resurrect, green up,
31.88	start growing, in 12 to 48 hours.
38.32	Now, why would I suggest
39.64	that producing drought-tolerant crops
39.64	will go towards providing food security?
45.04	Well, the current world population
45.04	is around 7 billion.
48.96	And it's estimated that by 2050,
51.48	we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people,
54.2	with the bulk of this growth
54.2	happening in Africa.
57.88	The food and agricultural
57.88	organizations of the world
60.36	have suggested that we need
60.36	a 70 percent increase
63.52	in current agricultural practice
65.72	to meet that demand.
67.72	Given that plants
67.72	are at the base of the food chain,
70.44	most of that's going
70.44	to have to come from plants.
73.36	That percentage of 70 percent
76.08	does not take into consideration
76.08	the potential effects of climate change.
80.32	This is taken from a study by Dai
80.32	published in 2011,
85.24	where he took into consideration
87.2	all the potential effects
87.2	of climate change
89.6	and expressed them --
89.6	amongst other things --
91.76	increased aridity due to lack of rain
91.76	or infrequent rain.
96.4	The areas in red shown here,
98.2	are areas that until recently
100.28	have been very successfully
100.28	used for agriculture,
103.48	but cannot anymore
103.48	because of lack of rainfall.
106.64	This is the situation
106.64	that's predicted to happen in 2050.
110.84	Much of Africa,
110.84	in fact, much of the world,
113.04	is going to be in trouble.
114.96	We're going to have to think of some
114.96	very smart ways of producing food.
118.64	And preferably among them,
118.64	some drought-tolerant crops.
121.96	The other thing
121.96	to remember about Africa is
124.04	that most of their agriculture is rainfed.
128.08	Now, making drought-tolerant crops
128.08	is not the easiest thing in the world.
131.56	And the reason for this is water.
134	Water is essential to life on this planet.
137.16	All living, actively
137.16	metabolizing organisms,
141.32	from microbes to you and I,
143.4	are comprised predominately of water.
145.76	All life reactions happen in water.
148.32	And loss of a small amount
148.32	of water results in death.
151.36	You and I are 65 percent water --
153.44	we lose one percent of that, we die.
155.84	But we can make behavioral
155.84	changes to avoid that.
159.92	Plants can't.
161.52	They're stuck in the ground.
163.16	And so in the first instance they have
163.16	a little bit more water than us,
166.56	about 95 percent water,
167.84	and they can lose
167.84	a little bit more than us,
169.96	like 10 to about 70 percent,
169.96	depending on the species,
174	but for short periods only.
176.68	Most of them will either try
176.68	to resist or avoid water loss.
180.88	So extreme examples of resistors
180.88	can be found in succulents.
184.84	They tend to be small, very attractive,
187.68	but they hold onto their water
187.68	at such great cost
190.44	that they grow extremely slowly.
193.44	Examples of avoidance of water loss
193.44	are found in trees and shrubs.
198.04	They send down very deep roots,
199.64	mine subterranean water supplies
201.36	and just keep flushing
201.36	it through them at all times,
203.84	keeping themselves hydrated.
205.72	The one on the right is called a baobab.
207.72	It's also called the upside-down tree,
209.8	simply because the proportion
209.8	of roots to shoots is so great
213.6	that it looks like the tree
213.6	has been planted upside down.
216.32	And of course the roots are required
216.32	for hydration of that plant.
220.76	And probably the most common strategy
220.76	of avoidance is found in annuals.
225.84	Annuals make up the bulk
225.84	of our plant food supplies.
229.04	Up the west coast of my country,
230.76	for much of the year
230.76	you don't see much vegetation growth.
234.32	But come the spring rains, you get this:
237	flowering of the desert.
239	The strategy in annuals,
240.88	is to grow only in the rainy season.
243.96	At the end of that season
243.96	they produce a seed,
246.28	which is dry, eight to 10 percent water,
249.12	but very much alive.
250.8	And anything that is
250.8	that dry and still alive,
253.72	we call desiccation-tolerant.
255.84	In the desiccated state,
257.28	what seeds can do
257.28	is lie in extremes of environment
259.96	for prolonged periods of time.
261.64	The next time the rainy season comes,
263.88	they germinate and grow,
265.4	and the whole cycle just starts again.
268.12	It's widely believed that the evolution
268.12	of desiccation-tolerant seeds
272.2	allowed the colonization and the radiation
274.4	of flowering plants,
274.4	or angiosperms, onto land.
278.96	But back to annuals
278.96	as our major form of food supplies.
282.8	Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent
282.8	of our plant food supplies.
288.48	And it's been a great strategy
290.04	because in a short space of time
290.04	you can produce a lot of seed.
293.24	Seeds are energy-rich
293.24	so there's a lot of food calories,
295.884	you can store it in times of plenty
295.884	for times of famine,
300.48	but there's a downside.
302.56	The vegetative tissues,
303.96	the roots and leaves of annuals,
306.16	do not have much
307.44	by way of inherent resistance,
307.44	avoidance or tolerance characteristics.
311.56	They just don't need them.
312.88	They grow in the rainy season
314.32	and they've got a seed
314.32	to help them survive the rest of the year.
317.72	And so despite concerted
317.72	efforts in agriculture
320.44	to make crops with improved properties
323	of resistance, avoidance and tolerance --
325.2	particularly resistance and avoidance
327.12	because we've had good models
327.12	to understand how those work --
330.04	we still get images like this.
332.4	Maize crop in Africa,
333.88	two weeks without rain
335.32	and it's dead.
337.56	There is a solution:
339.52	resurrection plants.
341.32	These plants can lose 95 percent
341.32	of their cellular water,
345.12	remain in a dry, dead-like state
345.12	for months to years,
349	and give them water,
350.76	they green up and start growing again.
353.56	Like seeds, these are
353.56	desiccation-tolerant.
356.88	Like seeds, these can withstand extremes
356.88	of environmental conditions.
361.76	And this is a really rare phenomenon.
363.8	There are only 135 flowering
363.8	plant species that can do this.
368.2	I'm going to show you a video
369.64	of the resurrection process
369.64	of these three species
372.28	in that order.
373.52	And at the bottom,
374.8	there's a time axis
374.8	so you can see how quickly it happens.
416.16	(Applause)
422.24	Pretty amazing, huh?
423.8	So I've spent the last 21 years
423.8	trying to understand how they do this.
428.04	How do these plants dry without dying?
431.08	And I work on a variety
431.08	of different resurrection plants,
433.88	shown here in the hydrated and dry states,
436.32	for a number of reasons.
437.8	One of them is that each
437.8	of these plants serves as a model
440.68	for a crop that I'd like
440.68	to make drought-tolerant.
443.08	So on the extreme top left,
443.08	for example, is a grass,
446.04	it's called Eragrostis nindensis,
448.32	it's got a close relative
448.32	called Eragrostis tef --
450.72	"a lot of you might know it as ""teff"" --"
452.76	it's a staple food in Ethiopia,
454.52	it's gluten-free,
455.8	and it's something we would like
455.8	to make drought-tolerant.
458.84	The other reason for looking
458.84	at a number of plants,
461.28	is that, at least initially,
462.68	I wanted to find out:
462.68	do they do the same thing?
464.96	Do they all use the same mechanisms
466.68	to be able to lose
466.68	all that water and not die?
469.28	So I undertook what we call
469.28	a systems biology approach
472	in order to get
472	a comprehensive understanding
474.2	of desiccation tolerance,
476.24	in which we look at everything
477.72	from the molecular to the whole plant,
477.72	ecophysiological level.
480.657	For example we look at things like
482.316	changes in the plant anatomy
482.316	as they dried out
484.537	and their ultrastructure.
485.8	We look at the transcriptome,
485.8	which is just a term for a technology
489	in which we look at the genes
490.44	that are switched on or off,
490.44	in response to drying.
492.88	Most genes will code for proteins,
492.88	so we look at the proteome.
496.12	What are the proteins made
496.12	in response to drying?
499.48	Some proteins would code for enzymes
499.48	which make metabolites,
503.4	so we look at the metabolome.
505	Now, this is important
505	because plants are stuck in the ground.
508.32	They use what I call
508.32	a highly tuned chemical arsenal
512.44	to protect themselves from all
512.44	the stresses of their environment.
515.88	So it's important that we look
517.4	at the chemical changes
517.4	involved in drying.
520.52	And at the last study
520.52	that we do at the molecular level,
523.2	we look at the lipidome --
524.48	the lipid changes in response to drying.
526.559	And that's also important
527.84	because all biological membranes
527.84	are made of lipids.
530.679	They're held as membranes
530.679	because they're in water.
533.28	Take away the water,
533.28	those membranes fall apart.
536.24	Lipids also act as signals
536.24	to turn on genes.
540.2	Then we use physiological
540.2	and biochemical studies
542.92	to try and understand
542.92	the function of the putative protectants
546.16	that we've actually discovered
546.16	in our other studies.
549.12	And then use all of that
549.12	to try and understand
551.32	how the plant copes
551.32	with its natural environment.
555.48	I've always had the philosophy that
555.48	I needed a comprehensive understanding
559.84	of the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
562.12	in order to make a meaningful suggestion
562.12	for a biotic application.
567	I'm sure some of you are thinking,
568.68	"""By biotic application,"
569.96	does she mean she's going to make
569.96	"genetically modified crops?"""
574.24	And the answer to that question is:
575.96	depends on your definition
575.96	of genetic modification.
579.2	All of the crops that we eat today,
579.2	wheat, rice and maize,
582.04	are highly genetically modified
582.04	from their ancestors,
585.28	but we don't consider them GM
587.28	because they're being produced
587.28	by conventional breeding.
590.88	If you mean, am I going to put
590.88	resurrection plant genes into crops,
594.68	your answer is yes.
596	In the essence of time,
596	we have tried that approach.
599.16	More appropriately,
599.16	some of my collaborators at UCT,
602.04	Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen,
604	have spearheaded that approach
605.64	and I'm going to show you some data soon.
609.2	But we're about to embark
609.2	upon an extremely ambitious approach,
613.24	in which we aim to turn on
613.24	whole suites of genes
616.72	that are already present in every crop.
619.44	They're just never turned on
619.44	under extreme drought conditions.
622.8	I leave it up to you to decide
624.28	whether those should be called GM or not.
627.56	I'm going to now just give you
627.56	some of the data from that first approach.
631.04	And in order to do that
632.32	I have to explain a little bit
632.32	about how genes work.
635	So you probably all know
636.28	that genes are made
636.28	of double-stranded DNA.
638.36	It's wound very tightly into chromosomes
640.32	that are present in every cell
640.32	of your body or in a plant's body.
644.08	If you unwind that DNA, you get genes.
647.84	And each gene has a promoter,
650.32	which is just an on-off switch,
652.72	the gene coding region,
654.16	and then a terminator,
655.44	which indicates that this is the end
655.44	of this gene, the next gene will start.
659.72	Now, promoters are not
659.72	simple on-off switches.
662.64	They normally require
662.64	a lot of fine-tuning,
665.36	lots of things to be present and correct
665.36	before that gene is switched on.
670.24	So what's typically done
670.24	in biotech studies
673.32	is that we use an inducible promoter,
675.16	we know how to switch it on.
676.76	We couple that to genes of interest
678.8	and put that into a plant
678.8	and see how the plant responds.
682.12	In the study that I'm going
682.12	to talk to you about,
684.72	my collaborators used
684.72	a drought-induced promoter,
687.2	which we discovered
687.2	in a resurrection plant.
689.64	The nice thing about this promoter
689.64	is that we do nothing.
692.8	The plant itself senses drought.
695.6	And we've used it to drive antioxidant
695.6	genes from resurrection plants.
700.72	Why antioxidant genes?
702.6	Well, all stresses,
702.6	particularly drought stress,
705.68	results in the formation of free radicals,
708	or reactive oxygen species,
710.36	which are highly damaging
710.36	and can cause crop death.
713.68	What antioxidants do is stop that damage.
717.36	So here's some data from a maize strain
717.36	that's very popularly used in Africa.
721.28	To the left of the arrow
721.28	are plants without the genes,
724.6	to the right --
725.88	plants with the antioxidant genes.
727.96	After three weeks without watering,
729.8	the ones with the genes
729.8	do a hell of a lot better.
733.72	Now to the final approach.
735.08	My research has shown
735.08	that there's considerable similarity
738.64	in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance
738.64	in seeds and resurrection plants.
743.08	So I ask the question,
744.52	are they using the same genes?
746.48	Or slightly differently phrased,
748.76	are resurrection plants using genes
748.76	evolved in seed desiccation tolerance
753.28	in their roots and leaves?
754.56	Have they retasked these seed genes
756.64	in roots and leaves
756.64	of resurrection plants?
759.76	And I answer that question,
761.64	as a consequence of a lot
761.64	of research from my group
764.08	and recent collaborations from a group
764.08	of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands,
767.64	Mel Oliver in the United States
769.24	and Julia Buitink in France.
771.88	The answer is yes,
773.32	that there is a core set of genes
773.32	that are involved in both.
776.2	And I'm going to illustrate this
776.2	very crudely for maize,
779.64	where the chromosomes below the off switch
782.08	represent all the genes that are required
782.08	for desiccation tolerance.
785.68	So as maize seeds dried out
785.68	at the end of their period of development,
789.96	they switch these genes on.
792.68	Resurrection plants
792.68	switch on the same genes
795.6	when they dry out.
797.28	All modern crops, therefore,
799.08	have these genes
799.08	in their roots and leaves,
801.16	they just never switch them on.
802.92	They only switch them on in seed tissues.
805.44	So what we're trying to do right now
807.2	is to understand the environmental
807.2	and cellular signals
809.84	that switch on these genes
809.84	in resurrection plants,
813.28	to mimic the process in crops.
815.68	And just a final thought.
817.44	What we're trying to do very rapidly
819.68	is to repeat what nature did
819.68	in the evolution of resurrection plants
823.52	some 10 to 40 million years ago.
826.16	My plants and I thank you
826.16	for your attention.
828.68	(Applause)
