25	I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened
27	over the past six million years.
30	All right.
32	We all have come from a long way,
35	here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,
38	which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
44	And I say that not because I am African,
47	but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence
50	for human ancestors, upright walking traces,
55	even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
58	So we all are Africans, and welcome home.
61	All right.
63	I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define
66	man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.
70	And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,
74	to tell you a story of all of us.
76	Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl
80	who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
84	She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
88	You don't need to remember that.
90	That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team
94	in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
97	It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
99	And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
102	We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
108	And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines
112	gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
115	After I was invited by TED, I did some digging,
118	because that's what we do, to know about my host.
121	You don't just jump into an invitation.
123	And I learned that the first technology appeared
125	in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
128	First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
133	And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.
139	And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
144	And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees
148	teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago
152	and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
158	I think knowing this is a very useful context
160	within which we can think of our ancestry.
164	However, DNA analysis informs us only about
168	the beginning and the end, telling us nothing
172	about what happened in the middle.
174	So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,
179	the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap
182	and see the different stages of development.
185	Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about --
188	(Laughter) --
192	it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about
195	how we looked like and how we behaved at different times,
199	and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.
204	That then gives you an access
206	to explore the biological mechanisms
209	and forces that are responsible for this gradual change
212	that made us what we are today.
215	But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
219	It's a systematic and scientific approach,
222	which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
228	Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,
230	where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers
234	from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
238	It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,
245	but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
250	With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
254	I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
258	When you get there, this is what you see,
261	and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
266	And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
270	(Laughter)
272	And you find nothing for years and years.
275	When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,
279	it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
283	But what you find are not the human remains,
286	such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
289	You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
293	But you could ask, how could these large mammals
295	live in this desert environment?
297	Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already
299	that the environment and the carrying capacity
302	of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
307	A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
311	Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
317	And our ancestors lived in that game park,
320	but were just the minorities. They were not as successful
322	and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
327	To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,
330	I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,
335	and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
338	"They would find a bone and tell me, ""Here is what you're looking for."""
340	"I would say, ""No, that's an elephant."""
341	"Again, another one, ""That's a monkey."" ""That's a pig,"" etc."
344	"So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, ""Listen, Zeray."
347	You either don't know what you're looking for,
349	"or you're looking in the wrong place,"" he said."
352	(Laughter)
353	"And I said, ""Why?"" ""Because there were elephants and lions,"
356	and the people were scared and went somewhere else.
358	"Let's go somewhere else."""
360	Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
362	It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,
367	and you see the face here covered by sandstone.
370	And here is actually the spinal column
372	and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,
376	because she was buried by a river.
379	What you have here seems to be nothing,
381	but contains an incredible amount of scientific information
385	that helps us explore what makes us human.
388	This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor
392	ever found in the history of paleoanthropology,
394	an amazing piece of our long, long history.
398	There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,
401	that's why I am not in.
403	How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,
406	but you are in the middle of nowhere?
408	The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,
413	of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,
416	of making sure everything is safe.
419	Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,
424	preparation and description, which was very long,
428	as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block
431	I just showed you in the previous slide.
433	It took five years.
434	In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,
439	but the labor was very long.
442	And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
446	And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,
449	who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
453	And you see me worried and trying to protect my child,
456	because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,
459	even a minister.
462	So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
466	(Laughter)
469	Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.
473	We were able to tell that she belonged
475	to the human family tree because the legs, the foot,
479	and some features clearly showed that she walked upright,
483	and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
486	But in addition, if you compare the skull
489	with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,
492	you see that you have vertical forehead.
496	And you see that in humans, because of the development
499	of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
501	You don't see that in chimpanzees,
504	and you don't see this very projecting canine.
508	So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,
511	you do detailed analysis, and we know now
513	that she belongs to the Lucy species,
515	known as Australopithecus afarensis.
518	The next exciting question is, girl or boy?
521	And how old was she when she died?
523	You can determine the sex of the individual
526	based on the size of the teeth.
529	How?
530	You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon
532	called sexual dimorphism, which simply means
534	males are larger than females and males have larger teeth
536	than the females.
538	But to do that, you need the permanent dentition,
540	which you don't see here, because what you have here
542	are the baby teeth.
544	But using the CT scanning technology,
546	which is normally used for medical purposes,
548	you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image
551	showing you both the baby teeth here
553	and the still-growing adult teeth here.
557	So when you measure those teeth,
559	it was clear that she turned out to be a girl
562	with very small canine teeth.
565	And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is
567	you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required
573	to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
578	So, this girl died when she was about three,
581	3.3 million years ago.
583	So, with all that information, the big question is --
586	what do we actually -- what does she tell us?
590	To answer this question, we can phrase another question.
592	What do we actually know about our ancestors?
595	We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,
597	how they walked around,
599	and how they lived and grew up.
602	And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton
607	are included: first, this skeleton documents,
612	for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
617	And second, she tells us that she walked upright,
620	but had some adaptation for tree climbing.
623	And more interesting, however,
625	is the brain in this child was still growing.
627	At age three, if you have a still-growing brain,
630	it's a human behavior.
632	In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
637	That's why they can cope with their environment
640	very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.
643	But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
645	That's why we need care from our parents.
648	But that care means also you learn.
650	You spend more time with your parents.
652	And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,
655	which is this extended dependence of human children
658	on their family or parents.
661	So, the still-growing brain in this individual
665	tells us that childhood, which requires
668	an incredible social organization,
671	a very complex social organization,
673	emerged over three million years ago.
675	So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,
679	Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account
684	on what makes us human.
687	But not everything was human, and I will give you
690	a very exciting example.
692	This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
694	It supports your tongue from behind.
696	It's, in a way, your voice box.
699	It determines the type of voice you produce.
703	It was not known in the fossil record,
705	and we have it in this skeleton.
708	When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear
712	that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
716	So if you were there 3.3 million years ago,
720	to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,
723	she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
726	"Maybe you're wondering, ""So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature."
730	"What does that tell us?"""
732	You know, that is very exciting for us,
734	because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,
737	and that evolution is in the making.
740	To summarize the significance of this fossil,
743	we can say the following.
745	Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors
749	came essentially from adult individuals
753	because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
756	They don't preserve well, as you know.
758	So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,
762	on how they looked like, how they behaved,
764	was kind of biased toward adults.
769	Imagine somebody coming from Mars
772	and his job is to report on the type of people
774	occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,
777	the children, and he goes back and reports.
781	Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?
785	That's what somehow we were doing so far
787	in the absence of the fossil children,
789	so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
794	So, I think the most important question at the end is,
799	what do we actually learn from specimens like this
802	and from our past in general?
805	Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount
808	of scientific information as to what makes us human,
811	you know, the many human ancestors that have existed
814	over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 --
818	they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications
821	that we, Homo sapiens, have today.
823	But if this species, ancient species,
827	would travel in time and see us today,
830	they would very much be very proud of their legacy,
835	because they became the ancestors of
837	the most successful species in the universe.
839	And they were probably not aware of this future legacy,
841	but they did great.
843	Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today
846	are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
852	So the question is, are we up to the challenge?
855	And can we really do better than these primitive,
858	small-brained ancestors?
861	Among the most pressing challenges that our species
865	is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
870	Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people
873	to talk about this.
876	Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.
882	One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,
888	carrying guns, that depends on other people forever,
893	or to promote an Africa which is confident,
898	peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems
902	and great values at the same time.
906	I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
911	And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
921	That's because we Africans concentrate --
925	I am from Ethiopia, by the way --
927	we concentrate too much on how we are seen
929	from elsewhere, or from outside.
932	I think it's important to promote in a more positive way
937	on how we see ourselves.
940	That's what I call positive African attitude.
943	So finally, I would like to say,
946	so let's help Africa walk upright and forward,
951	then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
956	Thank you.
958	(Applause)
