25	I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out
29	exactly what technology means in my life.
32	I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
39	Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
42	Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
47	But at the other hand, a couple of years ago
49	I gave up all of my possessions,
52	sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --
54	and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
60	fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
63	(Laughter)
64	And I've since then tried to keep technology
66	at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
70	At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
74	where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
78	So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
84	as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
88	as it relates to the spiritual.
91	And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
95	And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
101	This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
106	It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with
110	the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
116	Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.
121	I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
125	He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
129	(Laughter)
130	So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.
134	Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --
136	he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
140	(Laughter)
141	Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
146	But I was interested in another definition of technology.
149	Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
153	Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
159	I came up with a way of framing the question
162	that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
164	And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
167	So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
172	The question that I came up with was this question:
176	what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
179	does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
184	what are its inherent trends and biases?
186	What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
191	thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
195	And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
198	to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
202	So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
205	And I'm applying a similar trick to say,
208	what if we looked at the universe in our culture
211	through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
216	Obviously, this in an incomplete question,
218	just as looking at an organism as only a gene
220	is an incomplete way of looking at it.
222	But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,
226	if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
230	And I think once we ask that question
233	we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
238	if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
241	I think we come back to life at some point.
243	So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
246	And like you heard from the previous speakers,
249	we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
252	We have really no idea.
254	Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt
258	to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
261	Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try
264	and actually discover all the species on Earth.
266	And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
269	and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
274	just to see what's on life. And if we did that
276	with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
279	we would begin to see some incredible species.
283	This is not on another planet. These are things
285	that are hidden away on our planet.
287	This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
292	Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen
295	from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --
298	what they're doing, each one of them,
300	is they're hacking the rules of life.
303	I can't think of a single general principle of biology
308	that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
312	Every single thing that we can think of --
314	and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,
317	you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
320	because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
324	This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
328	that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
334	This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
337	and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
343	swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in
345	the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
352	These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
357	of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
361	six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,
365	the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria
368	and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
371	Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
377	But a more interesting way,
379	the current way to take the long view,
382	is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
385	And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
391	go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
394	So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
398	of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
402	You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
406	But what I like about this is it shows that
407	every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
413	Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
417	They've been around just as long and gone through
419	just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
423	But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
428	and has a different way of finding out how to do life.
430	And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,
434	what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
437	One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
443	have we ever been where we don't find life.
447	We find life at the bottom of every long-term,
451	long-distance drilling core into the center of rock
454	that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
458	And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
462	More and more of the inert matter of the globe
465	is being touched and animated by life.
468	The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
472	We see the movement from a general-purpose cell
475	to the more specific and specialized.
479	And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
483	And actually, we have current data that does show
485	that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
489	And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
491	One of the things we see about life is that it moves
494	from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
498	that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
502	Like those chloroplast cells --
504	they're completely surrounded by other life.
505	They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
511	And so the general, long-term trends of evolution
514	are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,
518	complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
523	OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
528	And again, my question is, what does technology want?
532	And so, remarkably, I discovered
535	that there's also a drift toward specialization.
538	That we see there's a general hammer,
541	and hammers become more and more specific over time.
544	There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
549	This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
551	I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,
554	and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
556	and count the number of species of technology in our household.
560	And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
563	I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
566	had only about 7,000 items in his household.
569	And he was the King of England,
570	and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
572	So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
577	This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out
581	and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
584	Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
588	And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
591	Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
594	and not non-technology, or even life.
597	And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex
600	is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,
604	I was partly responsible for that cliche
606	that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
609	So the major trends in technology evolution actually
615	are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
620	towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,
623	towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
627	because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
632	you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
636	I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
641	That its operations and how it works is so similar
645	that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
649	And so it would be sort of approximately up there,
652	coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
658	we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.
661	This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould
666	of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
668	But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
671	He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
675	And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
678	and to do a morphological analysis,
680	and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
684	This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
686	But the most interesting aspect about this
689	is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,
692	those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet
699	that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
703	When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
706	But that does happen in technology. And it turns out
709	that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,
713	and you can actually use it to determine
716	that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
720	In fact, this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important
724	that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
728	And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
733	So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
735	"""Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?"
740	"They're not around anymore."" Well actually, they are."
744	In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
751	And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts
754	for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked
758	is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --
761	(Laughter) --
762	for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.
767	And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
772	Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
775	So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog
780	and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --
783	I took a page that was actually more difficult than others
786	because lots of the pages are filled with things
788	that are still being made. But I took this page
791	and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
795	And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
800	And the answer is: all of them.
803	All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
810	I don't know who needs a corn sheller.
812	Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;
816	all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --
819	you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
822	brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
827	In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
834	made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
838	It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
842	what's important is that this information actually never died out.
845	It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
847	And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes
850	until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
857	Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it's actually very hard.
861	So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
865	We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
867	We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
869	took what I could find, the examples in history
872	where there have been prohibitions against technology,
875	and then I tried to find out when they came back in,
878	because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
881	the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
883	is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
888	but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
891	what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
896	That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
899	And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
905	and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --
911	we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --
914	what they're really about is accelerating and changing
917	the way in which evolution happens.
920	They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
923	So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,
927	the evolution of evolvability.
929	So what's happening over time in life is
931	that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
934	are increasing. And the real tricks are ways
938	in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
941	And then what we see in the singularity,
943	that prophesized by Kurzweil and others --
946	his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
950	It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
953	So if you have life hacking --
956	life means hacking, the game of survival --
958	then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
962	And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
966	"That is what we call an ""infinite game."""
969	"That's the definition of ""infinite game."" A finite game is play to win,"
972	and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
975	And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
980	The origins of technology was not in 1829,
983	but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
986	and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
990	were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
994	and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
997	That's the definition. There was no temperature.
999	There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
1002	what it expanded was the potential for difference.
1005	So as it expands and as things expand what we have
1008	is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,
1013	opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
1015	Those are all basically the same thing.
1017	And those are the things that technology brings us.
1021	That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
1025	That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
1029	And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
1033	And that's why we continue to grab technology --
1036	because we want those things. Those things are good.
1038	Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
1042	And each time we make a new opportunity place,
1044	we're allowing a platform to make new ones.
1048	And I think it's really important. Because if you can imagine
1051	Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented --
1054	what a loss to society there would be.
1056	Imagine Van Gogh being born
1058	before the technologies of cheap oil paints.
1061	Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
1065	Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born
1070	whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
1075	We have a moral obligation to invent technology
1078	so that every person on the globe has the potential
1080	to realize their true difference.
1083	We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
1086	That's what technology really wants.
1089	I'm going to skip through some of the objections
1091	because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
1095	I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
1098	bad technologies. I don't have an answer to
1100	how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that
1104	maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,
1110	maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
1113	Maybe in some ways
1115	the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
1120	It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
1123	but it's a really good thing to use
1125	to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
1129	Our humanity is actually defined by technology.
1132	All the things that we think that we really like about humanity
1135	is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
1140	That's what we're talking about.
1142	You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
1146	It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
1152	And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
1157	That's what technology wants.
1159	And so when I think about what technology wants,
1162	I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --
1167	every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
1172	to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
1175	That recursive nature is the infinite game.
1178	And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,
1181	so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
1185	That is the infinite game. And what technology is
1188	is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
1191	And so I think that we should embrace technology
1194	because it is an essential part of our journey
1197	in finding out who we are.
1199	Thank you.
1201	(Applause)
