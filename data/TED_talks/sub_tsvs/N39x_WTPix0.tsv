12.527	Anyone in the room thought about sex today?
15.372	(Laughter)
16.532	Yeah, you did.
17.737	Thank you for putting your hand up over there.
20.203	Well, I'm here to provide you with
21.923	some biological validation
23.618	for your sordid daydreams.
25.048	I'm here to tell you a few things
26.442	that you might not have known about wild sex.
29.948	Now, when humans think about sex,
31.796	male and female forms
33.526	are generally what come to mind,
35.197	but for many millions of years,
37.65	such specific categories didn't even exist.
40.271	Sex was a mere fusion of bodies
42.874	or a trickle of DNA
44.484	shared between two or more beings.
47.026	It wasn't until about 500 million years ago
49.351	that we start to see structures akin to a penis
52.715	or a thing that gives DNA out,
55.373	and a vagina, something that receives it.
58.527	Now invariably, you're probably thinking about
60.852	what belongs to our own species,
63.272	these very familiar structures,
65.17	but the diversity that we see in sexual structures
67.456	in the animal kingdom that has evolved
69.444	in response to the multitude of factors
72.092	surrounding reproduction
73.753	is pretty mind-blowing.
76.147	Penile diversity is especially profuse.
79.788	So this is a paper nautilus.
81.933	It's a close relative of squid and octopus,
84.843	and males have a hectocotylus.
87.965	Just what is a hectocotylus?
89.715	A detachable, swimming penis.
93.894	It leaves the [body of the male],
96.303	finds the female through
96.303	pheromonal cues in the water,
99.503	attaches itself to her body
101.414	and deposits the sperm.
102.722	For many decades, biologists actually felt
105.246	that the hectocotylus was a
105.246	separate organism altogether.
109.691	Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.
112.679	And the tapir has a prehensile penis.
115.627	It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis
118.669	much akin to what we have with our hands.
121.095	And it uses this dexterity
122.767	to bypass the vagina altogether
124.983	and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,
128.354	not to mention it's a pretty good size.
131.908	The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,
133.837	however, is not that of the tapir.
135.532	The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio
137.864	in the animal kingdom actually belongs
139.558	to the meager beach barnacle,
141.809	and this video is actually showing you
144.001	what the human penis would look like
146.085	if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.
149.546	(Laughter)
152.732	Mm-hm. (Laughter)
154.995	So with all of this diversity in structure,
157.793	one might think, then, that penises
159.95	are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place
162.921	for the purposes of successful reproduction.
164.998	Simply insert part A into slot B,
167.543	and we should all be good to go.
169.618	But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,
171.947	and that's because we can't
171.947	just take form into account.
174.875	We have to think about function as well,
177.157	and when it comes to sex,
178.947	function relates to the contributions made
181.473	by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.
184.272	And these contributions are far from equal.
187.606	Eggs are very expensive to make,
189.992	so it makes sense for females to be very choosy
192.943	about who she shares them with.
195.38	Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,
199.193	so it makes more sense for males
201.045	to have a more-sex-is-better strategy
203.195	when it comes to siring members
204.607	of future generations.
206.453	So how do animals cope
208.165	with these very incongruent
208.165	needs between the sexes?
211.05	I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,
214.299	or if she has the ability to store sperm
216.738	and she simply has enough,
218.415	then it makes more sense for her to spend her time
220.488	doing other biologically relevant things:
223.166	avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,
226.023	gathering and ingesting food.
228.193	This is, of course, bad news for any male
230.506	who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,
233.057	and this sets the scene for
233.057	some pretty drastic strategies
236.162	for successful fertilization.
239.468	This is bedbug sex,
241.475	and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.
245.749	Males have a spiked, barbed penis
248.543	that they literally stab into the female,
251.147	and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.
254.008	They stab it anywhere in her body,
256.143	and the sperm simply migrates
257.94	through her hemolymph to her ovaries.
261.244	If a female gets too many stab wounds,
263.388	or if a stab wound happens to become infected,
265.734	she can actually die from it.
268.113	Now if you've ever been out for a nice,
269.884	peaceful walk by the lake
271.775	and happened to see some ducks having sex,
274.517	you've undoubtedly been alarmed,
276.212	because it looks like gang rape.
278.723	And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.
281.384	A group of males will grab a female,
283.604	hold her down,
284.773	and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis
289.203	into her corkscrew-shaped vagina
292.287	over and over and over again.
295.193	From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.
298.982	Now the female actually
298.982	gets the last laugh, though,
301.117	because she can actually manipulate her posture
303.944	so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors
307.049	better access to her ovaries.
310.311	Now, I like to share stories
310.311	like this with my audiences
312.421	because, yeah, we humans,
313.877	we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,
317.022	there's romance, and there's orgasm.
319.263	But orgasm didn't actually evolve
320.945	until about 65 million years ago
323.031	with the advent of mammals.
324.798	But some animals had it going
324.798	on quite a bit before that.
327.662	There are some more primitive ways
329.416	of pleasing one's partner.
331.817	Earwig males have either
333.873	really large penile appendages
335.631	or really small ones.
337.032	It's a very simple genetically inherited trait
339.853	and the males are not otherwise any different.
341.839	Those that have long penile appendages
343.801	are not bigger or stronger
345.569	or otherwise any different at all.
347.073	So going back to our biological minds, then,
349.614	we might think that females should choose
351.731	to have sex with the guys that
351.731	have the shorter appendages,
354.712	because she can use her time for other things:
357.277	avoiding predators, taking care of young,
358.953	finding and ingesting food.
360.801	But biologists have repeatedly observed
363.617	that females choose to have sex
365.585	with the males that have the long appendages.
369.714	Why do they do this?
371.677	Well, according to the biological literature,
374.076	"""During copulation, the genitalia of certain males"
376.903	may elicit more favorable female responses
379.523	through superior mechanical
379.523	or stimulatory interaction
382.6	"with the female reproductive tract."""
386.158	Mm-hm.
388.549	These are Mexican guppies,
390.486	and what you see on their upper maxilla
392.617	is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,
395.019	and these filaments basically form
396.864	a fish mustache, if you will.
399.462	Now males have been observed to prod
401.804	the female's genital opening
403.468	prior to copulating with her,
405.415	and in what I have lovingly termed
405.415	the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,
408.924	females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found
412.936	with males that have these fish mustaches.
416.901	A little guppy porn for you right there.
420.198	So we've seen very different strategies
422.954	that males are using when it comes to
425.192	winning a female partner.
426.788	We've seen a coercion strategy in which
426.788	sexual structures are used in a forceful way
431.776	to basically make a female have sex.
433.549	We've also seen a titillation strategy
435.606	where males are actually
437.543	pleasing their female partners into choosing them
439.691	as a sex partner.
441.41	Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,
443.855	it's the coercion strategy that we see
446.271	time and time again.
448.01	It's very common in many phyla,
450.357	from invertebrates to avian species,
452.99	mammals, and, of course, even in primates.
455.536	Now interestingly, there 
455.536	are a few mammalian species
459.073	in which females have evolved specialized genitalia
462.305	that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.
466.974	Female elephants and female hyenas
469.342	have a penile clitoris,
471.716	or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,
475.523	much like a penis,
477.082	and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals
479.466	by merely looking at their external morphology.
482.633	So before a male can insert
482.633	his penis into a female's vagina,
486.225	she has to take this penile clitoris
488.08	and basically inside-out it in her own body.
491.643	I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.
494.58	It's simply not going to happen
496.112	unless the female is on board with the action.
499.434	Now, even more interesting is the fact
501.247	that elephant and hyena societies
503.256	are entirely matriarchal:
505.685	they're run by females, groups of females,
508.187	sisters, aunts and offspring,
510.433	and when young males attain sexual maturity,
513.636	they're turfed out of the group.
515.513	In hyena societies, adult males
517.596	are actually the lowest on the social scale.
520.858	They can take part in a kill only after
523.291	everybody else, including the offspring.
526.021	So it seems that when you take the penis power
528.339	away from a male,
530.177	you take away all the social power he has.
534.236	So what are my take-home
534.236	messages from my talk today?
536.878	Well, sex is just so much more
539.559	than insert part A into slot B
542.158	and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.
545.3	The sexual strategies and reproductive structures
547.957	that we see in the animal kingdom basically
550.98	dictate how males and females
550.98	will react to each other,
554.908	which then dictates how populations and societies
557.654	form and evolve.
559.284	So it may not be surprising to any of you
561.753	that animals, including ourselves,
563.561	spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,
567.171	but what might surprise you is the extent to which
570.347	so many other aspects of their lives and our lives
574.418	are influenced by it.
576.24	So thank you, and happy daydreaming.
578.203	(Applause)
