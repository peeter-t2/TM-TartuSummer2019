13.8	When I was a kid,
13.8	my parents would tell me,
16.64	"""You can make a mess,"
16.64	"but you have to clean up after yourself."""
20.44	So freedom came with responsibility.
23.8	But my imagination would take me
23.8	to all these wonderful places,
27.4	where everything was possible.
29.52	So I grew up in a bubble of innocence --
32.44	or a bubble of ignorance, I should say,
34.8	because adults would lie to us
34.8	to protect us from the ugly truth.
39.92	And growing up, I found out
39.92	that adults make a mess,
43.52	and they're not very good
43.52	at cleaning up after themselves.
47.36	Fast forward, I am an adult now,
49.52	and I teach citizen science and invention
49.52	at the Hong Kong Harbour School.
54.52	And it doesn't take too long
55.88	before my students walk on a beach
55.88	and stumble upon piles of trash.
60.12	So as good citizens,
60.12	we clean up the beaches --
62.8	and no, he is not drinking alcohol,
62.8	and if he is, I did not give it to him.
67.88	(Laughter)
69.96	And so it's sad to say,
71.2	but today more than 80 percent 
71.2	of the oceans have plastic in them.
75	It's a horrifying fact.
76.8	And in past decades,
78.2	we've been taking those big ships out
78.2	and those big nets,
81.68	and we collect those plastic bits
81.68	that we look at under a microscope,
85.04	and we sort them,
86.28	and then we put this data onto a map.
88.44	But that takes forever,
88.44	it's very expensive,
90.8	and so it's quite risky
90.8	to take those big boats out.
93.96	So with my students, ages six to 15,
96.92	we've been dreaming
96.92	of inventing a better way.
99.16	So we've transformed our tiny
99.16	Hong Kong classroom into a workshop.
103.6	And so we started building
103.6	this small workbench,
106.28	with different heights,
106.28	so even really short kids can participate.
109.48	And let me tell you, kids with power tools
109.48	are awesome and safe.
113.68	(Laughter)
115.04	Not really.
116.96	And so, back to plastic.
118.2	We collect this plastic and we grind it
118.2	to the size we find it in the ocean,
121.84	which is very small
121.84	because it breaks down.
124.04	And so this is how we work.
125.44	I let the imaginations
125.44	of my students run wild.
128.6	And my job is to try to collect
128.6	the best of each kid's idea
132.88	and try to combine it into something
132.88	that hopefully would work.
137.92	And so we have agreed
137.92	that instead of collecting plastic bits,
141.08	we are going to collect only the data.
143.08	So we're going to get an image
143.08	of the plastic with a robot --
146.08	so robots, kids get very excited.
148.48	And the next thing we do --
148.48	"we do what we call ""rapid prototyping."""
151.647	We are so rapid at prototyping
153.36	that the lunch is still in the lunchbox
153.36	when we're hacking it.
156.56	(Laughter)
157.88	And we hack table lamps and webcams,
157.88	into plumbing fixtures
162.16	and we assemble that into a floating robot
162.16	that will be slowly moving through water
167.32	and through the plastic
167.32	that we have there --
169.44	and this is the image
169.44	that we get in the robot.
171.655	So we see the plastic pieces
171.655	floating slowly through the sensor,
175.4	and the computer on board
175.4	will process this image,
178.72	and measure the size of each particle,
180.84	so we have a rough estimate
180.84	of how much plastic there is in the water.
185.52	So we documented
185.52	this invention step by step
188.56	on a website for inventors
188.56	called Instructables,
191.96	in the hope that somebody
191.96	would make it even better.
195.838	What was really cool about this project
195.838	was that the students saw a local problem,
199.72	and boom -- they are trying
199.72	to immediately address it.
202.411	[I can investigate my local problem]
204.76	But my students in Hong Kong
204.76	are hyperconnected kids.
208	And they watch the news,
208	they watch the Internet,
210.32	and they came across this image.
213.84	This was a child, probably under 10,
213.84	cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed,
218.6	in the Sundarbans, which is the world's
218.6	largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh.
223.12	So they were very shocked,
225.6	because this is the water they drink,
225.6	this is the water they bathe in,
228.92	this is the water they fish in --
228.92	this is the place where they live.
232.32	And also you can see the water is brown,
232.32	the mud is brown and oil is brown,
236.24	so when everything is mixed up,
237.741	it's really hard to see
237.741	what's in the water.
240.24	But, there's a technology
240.24	that's rather simple,
242.52	that's called spectrometry,
244.08	that allows you see what's in the water.
246.009	So we built a rough prototype
246.009	of a spectrometer,
249.08	and you can shine light
249.08	through different substances
252.04	that produce different spectrums,
254.48	so that can help you
254.48	identify what's in the water.
258.36	So we packed this prototype of a sensor,
261.28	and we shipped it to Bangladesh.
263.989	So what was cool about this project
265.68	was that beyond addressing
265.68	a local problem,
268.839	or looking at a local problem,
270.293	my students used their empathy
270.293	and their sense of being creative
274.24	to help, remotely, other kids.
276.52	[I can investigate a remote problem]
278.259	So I was very compelled
278.259	by doing the second experiments,
280.903	and I wanted to take it even further --
283.44	maybe addressing an even harder problem,
283.44	and it's also closer to my heart.
288.56	So I'm half Japanese and half French,
291.2	and maybe you remember in 2011
291.2	there was a massive earthquake in Japan.
297.12	It was so violent that it triggered
297.12	several giant waves --
300.96	they are called tsunami --
302.4	and those tsunami destroyed many cities
302.4	on the eastern coast of Japan.
310.68	More than 14,000 people
310.68	died in an instant.
315.6	Also, it damaged the nuclear
315.6	power plant of Fukushima,
319.36	the nuclear power plant just by the water.
322.48	And today, I read the reports
324.92	and an average of 300 tons
328	are leaking from the nuclear power plant
328	into the Pacific Ocean.
331.6	And today the whole Pacific Ocean
331.6	has traces of contamination of cesium-137.
338	If you go outside on the West Coast,
338	you can measure Fukushima everywhere.
342.44	But if you look at the map,
342.44	it can look like most of the radioactivity
345.76	has been washed away
345.76	from the Japanese coast,
347.88	and most of it is now --
347.88	it looks like it's safe, it's blue.
350.72	Well, reality is a bit
350.72	more complicated than this.
354.16	So I've been going to Fukushima
354.16	every year since the accident,
357.84	and I measure independently
357.84	and with other scientists,
360.4	on land, in the river --
362.28	and this time we wanted to take the kids.
365.04	So of course we didn't take the kids,
365.04	the parents wouldn't allow that to happen.
368.84	(Laughter)
370.2	But every night we would report
370.2	"to ""Mission Control"" --"
374.16	different masks they're wearing.
376.36	It could look like they didn't take
376.36	the work seriously, but they really did
380.76	because they're going to have to live
380.76	with radioactivity their whole life.
385.64	And so what we did with them
387.72	is that we'd discuss the data
387.72	we collected that day,
390.36	and talk about where
390.36	we should be going next --
392.575	strategy, itinerary, etc...
394.72	And to do this, we built
394.72	a very rough topographical map
398.36	of the region around
398.36	the nuclear power plant.
401.24	And so we built the elevation map,
403.28	we sprinkled pigments to represent
403.28	real-time data for radioactivity,
407.92	and we sprayed water
407.92	to simulate the rainfall.
412.28	And with this we could see
412.28	that the radioactive dust
415.28	was washing from the top of the mountain
415.28	into the river system,
418.36	and leaking into the ocean.
419.92	So it was a rough estimate.
422.68	But with this in mind,
422.68	we organized this expedition,
425.64	which was the closest civilians have been
425.64	to the nuclear power plant.
429.28	We are sailing 1.5 kilometers away
429.28	from the nuclear power plant,
433.64	and with the help of the local fisherman,
435.617	we are collecting sediment from the seabed
437.88	with a custom sediment sampler
437.88	we've invented and built.
441.36	We pack the sediment into small bags,
444.64	we then dispatch them
444.64	to hundreds of small bags
446.92	that we send to different universities,
448.88	and we produce the map
448.88	of the seabed radioactivity,
451.88	especially in estuaries
451.88	where the fish will reproduce,
454.44	and I will hope that we will have improved
456.52	the safety of the local fishermen
456.52	and of your favorite sushi.
459.64	(Laughter)
460.96	You can see a progression here --
462.56	we've gone from a local problem
462.56	to a remote problem to a global problem.
467.12	And it's been super exciting
467.12	to work at these different scales,
470.097	with also very simple,
470.097	open-source technologies.
473.68	But at the same time,
473.68	it's been increasingly frustrating
477.04	because we have only started to measure
477.04	the damage that we have done.
480.76	We haven't even started
480.76	to try to solve the problems.
485.64	And so I wonder
485.64	if we should just take a leap
488.44	and try to invent better ways
488.44	to do all these things.
493.52	And so the classroom
493.52	started to feel a little bit small,
497.12	so we found an industrial
497.12	site in Hong Kong,
499.84	and we turned it into
499.84	the largest mega-space
503.12	focused on social
503.12	and environmental impact.
506.32	It's in central Hong Kong,
507.64	and it's a place we can work
507.64	with wood, metal, chemistry,
510.88	a bit of biology, a bit of optics,
512.53	basically you can build
512.53	pretty much everything there.
515.047	And its a place where
515.047	adults and kids can play together.
518.04	It's a place where
518.04	kids' dreams can come true,
521.64	with the help of adults,
523	and where adults can be kids again.
524.84	Student: Acceleration! Acceleration!
528	Cesar Harada: We're asking
528	questions such as,
530.159	can we invent the future of mobility
530.159	with renewable energy?
533	For example.
535.32	Or, can we help the mobility
535.32	of the aging population
539.64	by transforming very standard wheelchairs
539.64	into cool, electric vehicles?
545.24	So plastic, oil and radioactivity
545.24	are horrible, horrible legacies,
551.8	but the very worst legacy
551.8	that we can leave our children is lies.
556.76	We can no longer afford
556.76	to shield the kids from the ugly truth
562	because we need their imagination
562	to invent the solutions.
566.72	So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers --
571.72	we must prepare the next generation
574.44	that cares about
574.44	the environment and people,
577.52	and that can actually
577.52	do something about it.
580.2	Thank you.
581.44	(Applause)
