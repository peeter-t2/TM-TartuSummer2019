33.98	"(Music: ""This Too Shall Pass"")"
39.98	(Singing)
51.38	You know you can't keep
51.38	letting it get you down,
54.58	and you can't keep dragging
54.58	that dead weight around.
63.58	If there ain't all that much to lug around
66.58	better run like hell
66.58	when you hit the ground
74.46	When the morning comes
80.42	When the morning comes
86.7	You can't stop these kids from dancing,
89.38	but why would you want to,
90.82	especially when you're
90.82	already getting yours?
94.62	(Xylophone)
98.58	(Singing) 'Cause if your mind
98.58	don't move and your knees don't bend,
101.98	well don't go blaming the kids again.
105.3	(Xylophone)
109.7	(Singing) When the morning comes
115.66	When the morning comes

148.78	this too shall pass
156.22	Let it go,
160.74	this too shall pass
167.58	You know you can't keep
167.58	letting it get you down,
171.18	you can't keep letting it get you down --
174.02	this too shall pass
179.86	If there ain't
179.86	all that much to lug around,
183.02	you can't keep letting it get you down --
186.26	this too shall pass
190.74	When the morning comes --
192.58	you can't keep letting it get you down,
194.86	no you can't keep letting it
196.74	When the morning comes --
198.5	you can't keep letting it get you down,
200.9	no you can't keep letting it
202.78	When the morning comes --
204.62	you can't keep letting it get you down,
206.9	no you can't keep letting it
208.82	When the morning comes --
210.7	you can't keep letting it get you down,
212.94	no you can't keep letting it

232.54	Damian Kulash:
232.54	Thank you, thanks very much.
234.62	We are OK Go,
236.5	and we've been together
236.5	as a band since 1998.
240.26	But in the last decade,
241.54	we've become known as much
241.54	for the elaborate music videos,
244.58	like the one we just saw,
245.86	as for the songs they accompany.
248.5	So we will play along with another
248.5	one of those in a few minutes,
251.62	but in the meantime,
252.86	we want to address this question
252.86	that we get asked all the time
256.22	but we've really never come up
256.22	with an adequate answer for it,
259.22	and that is, how do we
259.22	think of those ideas?
263.22	The videos are not all
263.22	Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.
265.98	Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,
268.099	and once we set up an obstacle course
271.899	out of thousands of musical
271.899	instruments in the desert,
274.66	and then played them
274.66	by stunt driving a car through them.
277.38	(Laughter)
278.42	For one of the videos,
279.7	we choreographed
279.7	hundreds of people with umbrellas
282.1	in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,
284.5	and then filmed them from a drone
284.5	a half a mile in the air.
288.34	So it's all of these ideas
288.34	that people are curious about,
291.98	and the reason we've had so much trouble
291.98	describing how we think of these ideas
296.26	is that it doesn't really feel
296.26	like we think of them at all.
300.22	It feels like we find them.
303.78	And by way of explanation --
305.7	well, I have a compulsive habit.
308.9	I play parallax and perspective games
308.9	with my eyes pretty much all the time,
313.98	and it's something I've been doing
313.98	since I was a teenager.
316.74	And I think the big contributing
316.74	factor may have been
319.5	that this is how I decorated
319.5	my high school bedroom.
322.1	(Laughter)
323.74	And being a teenager,
325.02	what I did in there, of course,
325.02	was just talk on the phone
327.78	for staggering amounts of time.
330.98	So I was in this visual maelstrom
333.38	just pretty much
333.38	usually sitting in one place,
335.58	and I guess just
335.58	the overload in general --
338.38	my brain kind of tried
338.38	to make sense of it, and I would --
341.58	If I could move my head off
341.58	to one side a little bit,
344.1	the edge of the desk
344.1	would line up just perfectly
346.46	with that poster on the opposite wall;
348.3	or if I put my thumb out,
349.58	I could close first my left eye
349.58	and then my right,
351.98	and my thumb would bounce back and forth
353.94	between Jimi Hendrix's
353.94	left eye and his right.
356.14	(Laughter)
357.38	It was not a conscious thing, of course,
359.74	this is just kind of the equivalent
359.74	of doodling while you're talking,
363.02	and it's still something
363.02	I do all the time.
365.14	This is my wife, Kristin --
366.5	(Applause)
367.7	Yeah!
369.18	Woo!
371.22	And it's not uncommon
371.22	that we are out at dinner,
374.74	and in the middle of a great conversation
374.74	she'll just stop mid-sentence,
378.18	and when she stops is when I realize
378.18	that I'm the one who's acting weird
381.62	because I'm like bobbing and weaving.
383.46	And what I'm trying to do
383.46	is get that ficus back there
386.06	to stick out of her head like a ponytail.
388.06	(Laughter)
390.42	The point of telling you
390.42	all this is that --
393.34	for me this is what it feels like
393.34	to have an idea.
395.74	It's like they're made
395.74	of these disparate parts,
399.3	these disparate chunks
399.3	sort of floating out there.
401.7	And if you're receptive
401.7	and you're observant,
404.78	and crucially, if you're
404.78	in exactly the right place,
407.38	you can get them to just line up.
410.26	So if you get used to --
411.54	if it's your job
411.54	to think of ideas this way,
414.1	they'll start beckoning to you
416.38	the way that Jimi's eyes
416.38	beckoned from that poster,
418.82	or the ficus beckons
418.82	from behind Kristin's head.
421.46	Writing music feels like that process
421.46	just over and over again,
424.46	like you've got a bunch of sounds
424.46	or a groove or a chord progression
428.86	and you're just looking
428.86	for that thing on the other side,
431.58	that little chunk over there,
431.58	that puzzle piece that clicks right in.
435.18	And when it does click,
436.54	it doesn't feel like you
436.54	thought up that puzzle piece,
439.22	it feels like you found it --
440.9	like it was a set of relationships
440.9	that you unlocked.
445.58	But with the videos in particular,
448.22	we're usually looking
448.22	for this specific feeling
450.46	which is wonder.
451.74	And there's always a component
451.74	of surprise to wonder,
454.66	so we're not just looking for good ideas,
457.02	we're looking for good ideas
457.02	that surprise us in some way.
460.26	And this causes something of a problem,
462.5	because ...
465.06	the process that we all use to make stuff,
467.5	it actually has a very strong bias
467.5	against surprising ideas.
471.06	The process I'm talking about
471.06	is the one you all know --
473.74	we all do it all the time.
475.02	You think of an idea.
476.46	You just sit and think
476.46	of your brilliant idea
478.62	and then you come up with a plan
480.22	for how you're going to make
480.22	that idea happen.
482.42	And then with that plan in mind,
484.02	you go back and double-check
484.02	your original idea
486.26	and maybe revise it,
487.54	and then bouncing back and forth
487.54	between the idea and the plan,
490.54	the plan and the idea,
491.78	eventually you come up
491.78	with a truly great plan.
494.02	And then once you have that,
494.02	and only then,
496.1	do you go out and you execute.
498.26	And this is like --
499.94	this is sort of a flawless system
502.26	in terms of maximizing your resources,
504.26	because this -- super cheap.
507.42	Thinking usually costs very little,
509.14	but this is really expensive
509.14	most of the time,
511.34	so by the time you get there,
512.78	you want to make sure
512.78	you're super prepared
514.86	and you can squeeze every last drop
514.86	out of what you've got.
517.7	But there are problems with this,
519.34	and math will help us
519.34	reveal the biggest one.
522.7	Go back to that video
522.7	that we just showed you.
525.26	That Rube Goldberg machine,
527.02	it had about 130 interactions in it.
529.34	That was 130 things
532.02	that we had to have go
532.02	according to our plan.
534.859	So let's assume that we want
534.859	to make a new video now,
538.74	similarly complex -- 130 moving parts.
542.62	If we're really good planners
542.62	in that system,
545.18	it seems like maybe
545.18	we could be good enough
548.46	to get every part of that system
548.46	to be 90 percent reliable.
554.62	Well, it's not.
555.9	It's terrible actually.
555.9	The numbers say so.
558.22	The chance of getting all 130 things
558.22	to not fail at the same time
562.98	is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.
566.26	So calculate that out and you get ...
568.18	(Ding)
569.74	.000001,
575.34	which is one ten-thousandth
575.34	of one percent,
577.82	so your chance for success
577.82	is literally one in a million.
581.62	(Whistle)
583.26	(Laughter)
584.98	I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,
587.46	so let's ratchet up
587.46	that reliability to 99 percent.
591.46	.99 to the 130th power is ...
594.34	(Ding)
595.5	.27 -- 27 percent.
597.46	Significantly less daunting --
599.06	like this might even be usable.
600.58	But really think about that.
601.98	How many parts of your lives
601.98	are 99 percent reliable?
606.34	And could you really get 130 of them
606.34	all in one place at once?
611.02	And if you really could,
613.34	doesn't it seem
613.34	like you deserve to succeed?
615.82	Like that is --
617.34	that thing is going to work, right?
619.06	But no, it actually fails three times
619.06	more often than it succeeds.
622.5	So the upshot of all this
624.22	is that if your project
624.22	is pretty complex --
627.46	like, you know,
627.46	every ambitious project is --
630.58	if you've got a lot of moving parts,
632.34	you're basically constrained
632.34	to just reshuffling ideas
635.98	that have already demonstrably
635.98	proven that they're 100 percent reliable.
640.86	So now go back to me sitting
640.86	with my thumb in the air
643.38	trying to line up something surprising.
645.46	If the only things I'm allowed
645.46	to consider in the first place
648.58	are ideas that have already been done
648.58	over and over and over again,
652.7	I am screwed.
655.82	However, there are ways around this,
657.58	because we all know that there are
657.58	tons of untried ideas still out there,
662.02	and plenty of them will turn out
662.02	to be every bit as reliable as we need,
665.7	it's just that we don't yet know
665.7	they are reliable
668.1	when we are at this planning phase.
670.06	So what we do is we try
670.06	to identify some place
673.78	where there might just be
673.78	a ton of those untried ideas.
676.98	We try to find a sandbox
679.22	and then we gamble
679.22	a whole bunch of our resources
681.78	on getting in that sandbox and playing.
684.62	(Laughter)
686.26	Because we have to trust
686.26	that it's the process in the sandbox
689.3	that will reveal to us
689.3	which ideas are not only surprising,
693.18	but surprisingly reliable.
695.42	So some of the sandboxes
695.42	that we've started videos with.
698.46	Let's play with optical illusions.
702.02	Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.
704.54	Let's try to make toast
704.54	with a laser cutter.
708.02	Or let's do something in one
708.02	of those zero-gravity airplanes.
713.22	But then instead
713.22	of actually trying to sit there
715.5	and think out what that something is,
717.34	we spent a full third of our budget
717.34	getting in an actual Vomit Comet
721.3	and bouncing off the walls for a week.
724.02	So this may seem to you like testing,
727.94	but it really isn't,
729.58	because at this point
729.58	we don't yet know what our idea is,
732.54	we don't have a plan to be testing.
735.3	So we're just --
736.82	we're just playing,
738.06	we're just trying everything
738.06	we can think of,
740.22	because we need to get this idea space
740.22	filled up with a chaos
744.34	like the one in my high school bedroom.
746.5	Because then, if we can
746.5	do the bob and weave thing,
749.46	if we can put our thumbs up
749.46	and get just a few things to line up --
753.5	(Ding)
754.74	chances are no one else has ever made
754.74	those same things line up before.
759.1	And when we're done with that project,
760.94	people will ask us again
760.94	how we thought of that idea,
763.46	and we'll be stumped,
763.46	because from our perspective,
765.9	it doesn't feel like
765.9	we thought of it at all,
768.06	it just feels like we found it.
769.62	So we'll play another video for you now
769.62	and the song along with it.
772.82	"This is for the song ""The One Moment,"""
774.7	and for this one,
774.7	the sandbox was ballistics and math.
779.06	So I spent a full month putting together
779.06	a giant spreadsheet for this.
784.54	It was like my playspace
784.54	was 400 lines long
787.7	and 25 columns wide --
790.42	which I presume that if anybody is going
790.42	to understand that, it's this crowd.
794.06	(Laughter)
795.34	Nothing is better
795.34	than a giant spreadsheet, right?
797.74	(Laughter)
798.98	Well, thank you everyone, very much.
800.74	We are OK Go,
801.98	"and this is called ""The One Moment."""
803.74	(Applause)
807.74	[The One Moment]
809.86	(Explosions)
816.02	[What you just saw was real
818.3	and it took 4.2 seconds]
819.58	(Video) Let me know when it's safe.
822.406	(Percussion)
823.58	[Here's the same moment ...
826.18	slowed down.]
828.26	(Music)
833.94	(Guitar)
857.06	(Singing) You're right,
860.02	there's nothing more lovely,
863.82	there's nothing more profound
868.18	than the certainty,
870.1	than the certainty
870.1	that all of this will end
879.34	That all of this will end
884.14	So open your arms to me,
886.38	open your arms to me
888.1	And this will be
888.1	the one moment that matters,
891.74	and this will be
891.74	the one thing we remember,
895.5	and this will be
895.5	the reason to have been here,
899.42	and this will be
899.42	the one moment that matters --
903.5	Oh ...
904.94	(Guitar)
911.1	(Singing) So while the mud
911.1	reclaims our footprints,
917.98	and while our bones keep looking back
921.86	at the overgrowth
921.86	that's swallowing the path --
925.74	but for the grace of God go we,
929.58	but for the grace of God go we
933.5	But for the grace of time and chance
933.5	and entropy's cruel hands --
938.3	So open your arms to me,
940.46	open your arms to me
942.3	And this will be
942.3	the one moment that matters,
945.9	and this will be
945.9	the one thing we remember,
949.78	and this will be
949.78	the reason to have been here,
953.62	and this will be
953.62	the one moment that matters
957.66	Oh ...
960.98	So won't you stay here with me
963.54	and we'll build
963.54	'til we've blistered our hands
968.82	So won't you stay here with me
968.82	and we'll build us some temples,
973.42	build us some castles,
975.42	build us some monuments
977.1	and burn them all right down
979.82	(Music)
990.54	(Singing) So open your arms to me
994.5	And this will be
994.5	the one moment that matters,
998.1	and this will be
998.1	the reason to have been here,
1002.02	and this will be
1002.02	the one thing we remember,
1005.86	and this will be
1005.86	the one moment that matters
1010.02	So won't you stay here with me,
1011.94	we'll build 'til we blister our hands
1014.22	And this will be
1014.22	the one moment that matters --
1017.38	So won't you stay here with me
1017.38	and build us some temples --
1021.86	This will be the one
1021.86	moment that matters --
1025.82	Build us some temples --
1027.42	The one moment that matters --
1029.3	Build us some monuments --
1031.3	The one moment that matters
1033.34	Build us some temples --
1035.14	The one moment that matters.
1037.38	Build us some monuments --
1038.86	The one moment that matters, oh
1041.74	(Guitar)
1046.78	(Applause)
