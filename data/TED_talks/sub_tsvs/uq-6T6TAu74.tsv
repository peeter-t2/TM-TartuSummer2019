12.76	There's a man out there, somewhere,
14.88	who looks a little bit
14.88	like the actor Idris Elba,
17.88	or at least he did 20 years ago.
20.28	I don't know anything else about him,
22.12	except that he once saved my life
24.04	by putting his own life in danger.
26.6	This man ran across four lanes of freeway
26.6	traffic in the middle of the night
32	to bring me back to safety
33.8	after a car accident
33.8	that could have killed me.
36.6	And the whole thing
36.6	left me really shaken up, obviously,
39.28	but it also left me with this
39.28	kind of burning, gnawing need
43.28	to understand why he did it,
45.76	what forces within him
45.76	caused him to make the choice
48.56	that I owe my life to,
50.44	to risk his own life
50.44	to save the life of a stranger?
54.08	In other words, what are the causes of his
54.08	or anybody else's capacity for altruism?
59.84	But first let me tell you what happened.
61.88	That night, I was 19 years old
63.36	and driving back to my home
63.36	in Tacoma, Washington,
65.76	down the Interstate 5 freeway,
67.6	when a little dog
67.6	darted out in front of my car.
70.16	And I did exactly
70.16	what you're not supposed to do,
72.52	which is swerve to avoid it.
74.48	And I discovered why
74.48	you're not supposed to do that.
77.319	I hit the dog anyways,
79.08	and that sent the car into a fishtail,
81.72	and then a spin across the freeway,
84.32	until finally it wound up
84.32	in the fast lane of the freeway
87.92	faced backwards into oncoming traffic
90.88	and then the engine died.
93.48	And I was sure in that moment
93.48	that I was about to die too,
97.88	but I didn't
99.12	because of the actions
99.12	of that one brave man
101.88	who must have made the decision
103.4	within a fraction of a second
103.4	of seeing my stranded car
106.44	to pull over and run
106.44	across four lanes of freeway traffic
110.72	in the dark
112.68	to save my life.
114.68	And then after he got my car working again
117.6	and got me back to safety
117.6	and made sure I was going to be all right,
121.24	he drove off again.
122.8	He never even told me his name,
125.16	and I'm pretty sure
125.16	I forgot to say thank you.
128.44	So before I go any further,
130.4	I really want to take a moment
131.88	to stop and say thank you
131.88	to that stranger.
135.28	(Applause)
142.919	I tell you all of this
144.16	because the events of that night changed
144.16	the course of my life to some degree.
148.4	I became a psychology researcher,
150.04	and I've devoted my work to understanding
150.04	the human capacity to care for others.
154.84	Where does it come from,
154.84	and how does it develop,
157.2	and what are the extreme forms
157.2	that it can take?
160.12	These questions are really important
160.12	to understanding basic aspects
163.32	of human social nature.
165.32	A lot of people,
165.32	and this includes everybody
167.44	from philosophers
167.44	and economists to ordinary people
170.36	believe that human nature
170.36	is fundamentally selfish,
173.64	that we're only ever really motivated
173.64	by our own welfare.
177.84	But if that's true, why do some people,
177.84	like the stranger who rescued me,
182.16	do selfless things,
182.16	like helping other people
184.68	at enormous risk and cost to themselves?
187.88	Answering this question
189.2	requires exploring the roots
189.2	of extraordinary acts of altruism,
193.32	and what might make people
193.32	who engage in such acts
195.72	different than other people.
197.6	But until recently, very little work
197.6	on this topic had been done.
201.92	The actions of the man who rescued me
203.76	meet the most stringent
203.76	definition of altruism,
206.76	which is a voluntary, costly behavior
209.4	motivated by the desire
209.4	to help another individual.
212.64	So it's a selfless act
212.64	intended to benefit only the other.
216.56	What could possibly
216.56	explain an action like that?
220.12	One answer is compassion, obviously,
222.08	which is a key driver of altruism.
224.52	But then the question becomes,
226.16	why do some people
226.16	seem to have more of it than others?
230.12	And the answer may be that the brains
230.12	of highly altruistic people
234.04	are different in fundamental ways.
237.12	But to figure out how,
239.04	I actually started from the opposite end,
242.16	with psychopaths.
244.68	A common approach to understanding
244.68	basic aspects of human nature,
247.8	like the desire to help other people,
249.84	is to study people
249.84	in whom that desire is missing,
253	and psychopaths are exactly such a group.
256.2	Psychopathy is a developmental disorder
258.6	with strongly genetic origins,
260.72	and it results in a personality
260.72	that's cold and uncaring
263.64	and a tendency to engage in antisocial
263.64	and sometimes very violent behavior.
268.04	Once my colleagues and I
268.04	at the National Institute of Mental Health
271.32	conducted some of the first ever
271.32	brain imaging research
273.959	of psychopathic adolescents,
276.12	and our findings, and the findings
276.12	of other researchers now,
279	have shown that people
279	who are psychopathic
281.32	pretty reliably exhibit
281.32	three characteristics.
285.16	First, although they're not generally
285.16	insensitive to other people's emotions,
289.8	they are insensitive to signs
289.8	that other people are in distress.
293.6	And in particular,
294.84	they have difficulty recognizing
294.84	fearful facial expressions like this one.
298.76	And fearful expressions convey
298.76	urgent need and emotional distress,
302.48	and they usually elicit
302.48	compassion and a desire to help
305.12	in people who see them,
306.4	so it makes sense that people
306.4	who tend to lack compassion
309.12	also tend to be insensitive to these cues.
312.52	The part of the brain
313.76	that's the most important
313.76	for recognizing fearful expressions
316.68	is called the amygdala.
317.96	There are very rare cases of people
317.96	who lack amygdalas completely,
321.4	and they're profoundly impaired
321.4	in recognizing fearful expressions.
325.28	And whereas healthy adults and children
327.68	usually show big spikes
327.68	in amygdala activity
330.32	when they look at fearful expressions,
332.48	psychopaths' amygdalas
332.48	are underreactive to these expressions.
335.64	Sometimes they don't react at all,
337.32	which may be why they have
337.32	trouble detecting these cues.
341.24	Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
341.24	are smaller than average
344.4	by about 18 or 20 percent.
346.92	So all of these findings
346.92	are reliable and robust,
350.76	and they're very interesting.
352.24	But remember that my main interest
353.92	is not understanding
353.92	why people don't care about others.
357.48	It's understanding why they do.
359.88	So the real question is,
362.2	could extraordinary altruism,
364.48	which is the opposite of psychopathy
366.72	in terms of compassion
366.72	and the desire to help other people,
370.16	emerge from a brain that is also
370.16	the opposite of psychopathy?
374.2	A sort of antipsychopathic brain,
377.88	better able to recognize
377.88	other people's fear,
381	an amygdala that's more reactive
381	to this expression
383.44	and maybe larger than average as well?
385.92	As my research has now shown,
387.96	all three things are true.
389.44	And we discovered this
390.72	by testing a population
390.72	of truly extraordinary altruists.
393.76	These are people who have given
393.76	one of their own kidneys
396.44	to a complete stranger.
398.6	So these are people who have volunteered
398.6	to undergo major surgery
401.72	so that one of their own
401.72	healthy kidneys can be removed
404.36	and transplanted into a very ill stranger
406.44	that they've never met and may never meet.
409.04	"""Why would anybody do this?"""
409.04	is a very common question.
412.52	And the answer may be
413.92	that the brains of these
413.92	extraordinary altruists
416.2	have certain special characteristics.
419.04	They are better at recognizing
419.04	other people's fear.
422.28	They're literally better at detecting
422.28	when somebody else is in distress.
425.72	This may be in part because their amygdala
425.72	is more reactive to these expressions.
430.4	And remember, this is the same part
430.4	of the brain that we found
433.36	was underreactive
433.36	in people who are psychopathic.
435.72	And finally, their amygdalas
435.72	are larger than average as well,
438.64	by about eight percent.
439.88	So together, what these data suggest
441.64	is the existence of something
441.64	like a caring continuum in the world
445.28	that's anchored at the one end
445.28	by people who are highly psychopathic,
448.84	and at the other by people
448.84	who are very compassionate
451.36	and driven to acts of extreme altruism.
454.76	But I should add that what makes
454.76	extraordinary altruists so different
458.72	is not just that they're
458.72	more compassionate than average.
461.44	They are,
462.68	but what's even more unusual about them
464.6	is that they're compassionate
464.6	and altruistic
466.72	not just towards people
466.72	who are in their own innermost circle
469.68	of friends and family. Right?
471.68	Because to have compassion for people
471.68	that you love and identify with
474.96	is not extraordinary.
478.04	Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
478.04	extends way beyond that circle,
482.24	even beyond their wider
482.24	circle of acquaintances
484.48	to people who are outside
484.48	their social circle altogether,
487.44	total strangers,
489	just like the man who rescued me.
491.96	And I've had the opportunity now
491.96	to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors
495.48	how it is that they manage to generate
495.48	such a wide circle of compassion
499.88	that they were willing to give
499.88	a complete stranger their kidney.
503.24	And I found it's a really difficult
503.24	question for them to answer.
506.76	"I say, ""How is it that"
506.76	you're willing to do this thing
510.84	when so many other people don't?
512.84	You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans
515.28	who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.
517.92	"What is it that makes you so special?"""
520.4	And what do they say?
523.4	"They say, ""Nothing."
526.2	There's nothing special about me.
528	"I'm just the same as everybody else."""
531.2	And I think that's actually
531.2	a really telling answer,
534.32	because it suggests that the circles
534.32	of these altruists don't look like this,
539.24	they look more like this.
541.24	They have no center.
543.32	These altruists literally
543.32	don't think of themselves
545.76	as being at the center of anything,
548.04	as being better or more inherently
548.04	important than anybody else.
552	When I asked one altruist
552	why donating her kidney made sense to her,
555.24	"she said, ""Because it's not about me."""
559.04	Another said,
560.8	"""I'm not different. I'm not unique."
563.08	Your study here is going to find out
563.08	"that I'm just the same as you."""
566.44	I think the best description
566.44	for this amazing lack of self-centeredness
570.56	is humility,
572.44	which is that quality
572.44	that in the words of St. Augustine
575.56	makes men as angels.
578.12	And why is that?
579.84	It's because if there's
579.84	no center of your circle,
582.64	there can be no inner rings
582.64	or outer rings,
585.2	nobody who is more or less worthy
585.2	of your care and compassion
588.12	than anybody else.
589.92	And I think that this is what really
589.92	distinguishes extraordinary altruists
593.44	from the average person.
595.4	But I also think that this is a view
595.4	of the world that's attainable by many
599	and maybe even most people.
601	And I think this
601	because at the societal level,
603.28	expansions of altruism and compassion
603.28	are already happening everywhere.
607.92	The psychologist Steven Pinker
607.92	and others have shown
610.4	that all around the world people
610.4	are becoming less and less accepting
613.68	of suffering in ever-widening
613.68	circles of others,
616.16	which has led to declines
616.16	of all kinds of cruelty and violence,
619.24	from animal abuse to domestic violence
619.24	to capital punishment.
623.48	And it's led to increases
623.48	in all kinds of altruism.
626.32	A hundred years ago, people
626.32	would have thought it was ludicrous
629.44	how normal and ordinary it is
630.96	for people to donate
630.96	their blood and bone marrow
634.28	to complete strangers today.
636.72	Is it possible that
636.72	a hundred years from now
638.84	people will think
638.84	that donating a kidney to a stranger
641.44	is just as normal and ordinary
642.92	as we think donating blood
642.92	and bone marrow is today?
645.96	Maybe.
647.8	So what's at the root
647.8	of all these amazing changes?
650.72	In part it seems to be
652.52	increases in wealth
652.52	and standards of living.
656.6	As societies become
656.6	wealthier and better off,
659.36	people seem to turn
659.36	their focus of attention outward,
662	and as a result, all kinds of altruism
662	towards strangers increases,
665.88	from volunteering to charitable donations
665.88	and even altruistic kidney donations.
671.44	But all of these changes also yield
674.44	a strange and paradoxical result,
677.68	which is that even as the world is
677.68	becoming a better and more humane place,
681.24	which it is,
682.48	there's a very common perception
682.48	that it's becoming worse
685.2	and more cruel, which it's not.
688.08	And I don't know exactly why this is,
689.92	but I think it may be
689.92	that we now just know so much more
693.52	about the suffering
693.52	of strangers in distant places,
696.72	and so we now care a lot more
699.16	about the suffering
699.16	of those distant strangers.
702.24	But what's clear is the kinds
702.24	of changes we're seeing show
705.96	that the roots of altruism and compassion
708.44	are just as much a part of human nature
708.44	as cruelty and violence,
711.48	maybe even more so,
713.2	and while some people do seem
713.2	to be inherently more sensitive
717.28	to the suffering of distant others,
719.4	I really believe that the ability
719.4	to remove oneself
722.2	from the center of the circle
724	and expand the circle of compassion
724	outward to include even strangers
728.08	is within reach for almost everyone.
732.08	Thank you.
733.32	(Applause)
