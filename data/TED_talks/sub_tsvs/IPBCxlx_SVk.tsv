15.26	As a child,
18.26	I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --
21.26	three old women
23.26	who took care of me while my parents worked.
27.26	The year is 1963.
30.26	We're at the ocean.
32.26	It's twilight.
34.26	We're watching the rising of the stars
38.26	and the shifting of the tides.
41.26	It's a stretch of beach we know so well.
45.26	The smooth stones on the sand
48.26	are familiar to us.
52.26	If you saw these women on the street
54.26	in their faded clothes,
56.26	you might dismiss them
58.26	as poor and simple.
60.26	That would be a mistake.
63.26	These women are descendants
65.26	of Polynesian navigators,
67.26	trained in the old ways
70.26	by their elders,
72.26	and now they're passing it on to me.
75.26	They teach me the names of the winds and the rains,
79.26	of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.
83.26	There's a new moon on the horizon.
86.26	Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.
89.26	They begin to chant.
92.26	[Hawaiian chant]
122.26	When they finish,
124.26	they sit in a circle
126.26	and ask me to come to join them.
129.26	They want to teach me about my destiny.
133.26	I thought every seven-year-old went through this.
135.26	(Laughter)
139.26	"""Baby girl,"
141.26	someday the world will be in trouble.
144.26	People will forget their wisdom.
147.26	It will take elders' voices
150.26	from the far corners of the world
153.26	to call the world into balance.
157.26	You will go far away.
159.26	It will sometimes be a lonely road.
162.26	We will not be there.
164.26	But you will look into the eyes
166.26	of seeming strangers,
169.26	and you will recognize your ohana,
172.26	your family.
174.26	And it will take all of you.
177.26	"It will take all of you."""
181.26	These words, I hold onto
184.26	all my life.
186.26	Because the idea of doing it alone
189.26	terrifies me.
192.26	The year is 2007.
195.26	I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.
198.26	Satawal is one half-mile long
201.26	by one mile wide.
204.26	It's the home of my mentor.
206.26	His name is Pius Mau Piailug.
208.26	Mau is a palu,
210.26	a navigator priest.
212.26	He's also considered
214.26	the greatest wave finder in the world.
217.26	There are fewer than a handful
219.26	of palu left on this island.
222.26	Their tradition is so extraordinary
225.26	that these mariners sailed
227.26	three million square miles across the Pacific
230.26	without the use of instruments.
233.26	They could synthesize patterns in nature
236.26	using the rising and setting of stars,
239.26	the sequence and direction of waves,
242.26	the flight patterns of certain birds.
245.26	Even the slightest hint of color
248.26	on the underbelly of a cloud
250.26	would inform them
252.26	and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.
258.26	When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe
261.26	and watch him go into the hull,
263.26	it appeared that an old man
265.26	was going to rest.
267.26	In fact, the hull of the canoe
269.26	is the womb of the vessel.
271.26	It is the most accurate place
274.26	to feel the rhythm and sequence
277.26	and direction of waves.
279.26	Mau was, in fact,
281.26	gathering explicit data
283.26	using his entire body.
286.26	It's what he had been trained to do
288.26	since he was five years old.
291.26	Now science may dismiss this methodology,
295.26	but Polynesian navigators use it today
299.26	because it provides them
302.26	an accurate determination
304.26	of the angle and direction
306.26	of their vessel.
308.26	The palu also had
310.26	an uncanny ability
312.26	to forecast weather conditions
314.26	days in advance.
316.26	Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night
319.26	and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,
322.26	and he would look out,
325.26	and then he would say,
327.26	"""Okay, we go."""
329.26	He saw that first glint of light --
331.26	he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.
335.26	Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically,
338.26	are extraordinary,
340.26	and they are so relevant
342.26	for these times that we are in
344.26	when we are riding out storms.
348.26	We are in such a critical moment
351.26	of our collective history.
356.26	They have been compared
358.26	to astronauts --
360.26	these elder navigators
362.26	who sail vast open oceans
365.26	in double-hulled canoes
368.26	thousands of miles
370.26	from a small island.
373.26	Their canoes, our rockets;
376.26	their sea, our space.
380.26	The wisdom of these elders
382.26	is not a mere collection
384.26	of stories about old people
387.26	in some remote spot.
389.26	This is part of our collective narrative.
392.26	It's humanity's DNA.
395.26	We cannot afford to lose it.
398.26	The year is 2010.
402.26	Just as the women in Hawaii
405.26	that raised me predicted,
407.26	the world is in trouble.
411.26	We live in a society
414.26	bloated with data,
416.26	yet starved for wisdom.
420.26	We're connected 24/7,
424.26	yet anxiety,
426.26	fear, depression and loneliness
429.26	is at an all-time high.
431.26	We must course-correct.
435.26	An African shaman said,
438.26	"""Your society worships the jester"
441.26	while the king stands
443.26	"in plain clothes."""
450.26	The link between the past and the future
453.26	is fragile.
455.26	This I know intimately,
457.26	because even as I travel
460.26	throughout the world
462.26	to listen to these stories and record them,
466.26	I struggle.
473.26	I am haunted
476.26	by the fact that I no longer remember
480.26	the names of the winds and the rains.
489.26	Mau passed away
492.26	five months ago,
494.26	but his legacy and lessons live on.
498.26	And I am reminded
502.26	that throughout the world
505.26	there are cultures
507.26	with vast sums of knowledge in them,
511.26	as potent as the Micronesian navigators,
515.26	that are going dismissed,
517.26	that this is a testament
519.26	to brilliant, brilliant
521.26	technology and science and wisdom
524.26	that is vanishing rapidly.
526.26	Because when an elder dies a library is burned,
529.26	and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.
533.26	I am grateful for the fact
536.26	that I had a mentor like Mau
539.26	who taught me how to navigate.
542.26	And I realize
544.26	through a lesson that he shared
547.26	that we continue to find our way.
549.26	And this is what he said:
552.26	"""The island is the canoe;"
554.26	"the canoe, the island."""
557.26	And what he meant was,
560.26	if you are voyaging
562.26	and far from home,
564.26	your very survival depends
566.26	on everyone aboard.
569.26	You cannot make the voyage alone,
572.26	you were never meant to.
574.26	This whole notion of every man for himself
576.26	is completely unsustainable.
578.26	It always was.
581.26	So in closing I would offer you this:
585.26	The planet is our canoe,
589.26	and we are the voyagers.
592.26	True navigation
594.26	begins in the human heart.
597.26	It's the most important map of all.
600.26	Together, may we journey well.
603.26	(Applause)
