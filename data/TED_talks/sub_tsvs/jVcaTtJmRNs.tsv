64.744	Maya Penn: I've been drawing ever
64.744	since I could hold a crayon,
68.033	and I've been making animated flip books
70.116	since I was three years old.
72.056	At that age, I also learned
72.056	about what an animator was.
75.25	There was a program on TV about jobs
77.583	most kids don't know about.
79.345	When I understood that an animator
81.101	makes the cartoons I saw on TV,
82.933	"I immediately said, ""That's what I want to be."""
86.714	I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud,
89.016	but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.
92.9	Animation and art has always been my first love.
97.227	It was my love for technology that sparked the idea
99.35	"for ""Malicious Dishes."""
101.216	There was a virus on my computer,
102.955	and I was trying to get rid of it,
104.602	and all of a sudden, I just thought,
106.478	what if viruses have their own
106.478	little world inside the computer?
109.418	Maybe a restaurant where they meet up
111.537	and do virusy things?
113.13	"And thus, ""Malicious Dishes"" was born."
116.502	At four years old, my dad showed me
118.645	how to take apart a computer
118.645	and put it back together again.
121.513	That started my love for technology.
124.123	I built my first website myself in HTML,
127.154	and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.
129.671	I'm also working on an animated series
131.41	"called ""The Pollinators."""
132.665	It's about bees and other
132.665	pollinators in our environment
134.881	and why they're so important.
137.25	If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators,
139.86	then all creatures, including ourselves,
141.769	that depend on these plants, would starve.
144.285	So I decided to take these cool creatures
146.493	and make a superhero team.
150.312	(Applause)
158.202	(Foot stomp)
161.376	(Music)
168.028	(Roar)
170.154	Pollinator: Deforestsaurus! I should have known!
172.631	I need to call on the rest of the Pollinators!
175.049	(Music)
187.032	Thank you. (Applause)
189.524	All of my animations start with ideas,
192.602	but what are ideas?
196.337	Ideas can spark a movement.
199.34	Ideas are opportunities and innovation.
203.009	Ideas truly are what make the world go round.
206.628	If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be
209.055	where we are now with technology, medicine,
211.038	art, culture, and how we even live our lives.
215.125	At eight years old, I took my ideas
217.387	and started my own business called Maya's Ideas,
220.331	and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
223.107	(Laughter)
224.853	And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
228.304	I'm 13 now, and although I started my business
230.974	in 2008,
232.386	my artistic journey started way before then.
235.696	I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to
237.986	incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
241.006	I would find different fabrics around the house,
243.009	and say, &amp;quot;This could be a scarf or a hat,&amp;quot;
245.264	and I had all these ideas for designs.
248.374	I noticed when I wore my creations,
250.227	people would stop me and say,
251.675	"""Wow, that's really cute. Where can I get one?"""
253.732	And I thought, I can start my own business.
256.915	Now I didn't have any business plans
258.789	at only eight years old.
260.557	I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations
262.584	that were safe for the environment
263.839	and I wanted to give back.
265.877	My mom taught me how to sew,
267.7	and on my back porch, I would sit and make
269.697	little headbands out of ribbon,
271.218	and I would write down the names
271.218	and the price of each item.
273.818	I started making more items like hats,
275.888	scarves and bags.
278.094	Soon, my items began selling all over the world,
280.489	and I had customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia,
283.318	Canada and more.
285.925	Now, I had a lot to learn about my business,
288.509	like branding and marketing,
290.184	staying engaged with my customers,
291.942	and seeing what sold the most and the least.
295.423	Soon, my business really started to take off.
297.837	Then one day, Forbes magazine 
297.837	contacted me when I was 10 years old.
302.084	(Laughter)
303.677	They wanted to feature me and my company
306.014	in their article.
308.036	Now a lot of people ask me,
310.117	why is your business eco-friendly?
312.543	I've had a passion for protecting the environment
315.067	and its creatures since I was little.
317.108	My parents taught me at an early age
319.025	about giving back and being a
319.025	good steward to the environment.
322.319	I heard about how the dyes in some clothing
324.385	or the process of even making the items
326.531	was harmful to the people and the planet,
329.11	so I started doing my own research,
331.259	and I discovered that even
331.259	after dyeing has being completed,
334.364	there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact
336.39	on the environment.
338.004	For example, the grinding of materials,
339.987	or the dumping of dried powder materials.
342.718	These actions can pollute the air,
344.418	making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
348.181	So when I started my business,
349.645	I knew two things:
352.001	All of my items had to be eco-friendly,
354.713	and 10 to 20 percent of the profits I made
356.982	went to local and global charities
358.642	and environmental organizations.
360.719	(Applause)
364.587	I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs
367.136	that not only seeks to have a successful business,
369.398	but also a sustainable future.
372.174	I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers
374.163	without compromising the
374.163	ability of future generations
376.993	to live in a greener tomorrow.
379.581	We live in a big, diverse and beautiful world,
382.18	and that makes me even more passionate to save it.
384.636	But it's never enough to just
384.636	to get it through your heads
387.014	about the things that are happening in our world.
389.196	It takes to get it through your hearts,
391.496	because when you get it through your heart,
393.104	that is when movements are sparked.
395.275	That is when opportunities
396.574	and innovation are created,
398.246	and that is why ideas come to life.
401.279	Thank you, and peace and blessings.
406.312	(Applause)
411.944	Thank you. (Applause)
414.715	Pat Mitchell: So, you heard Maya talk about
418.015	the amazing parents who are behind
420.838	this incredible woman. Where are they?
423.055	Please, Mr. and Mrs. Penn. Would you just -- Ah!
426.053	(Applause)
