12.8	When I moved to Harare in 1985,
16.12	social justice was at the core
16.12	of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
20.92	The new government emerged
20.92	from a long war of independence
24.64	and immediately proclaimed
24.64	a socialist agenda:
27.48	health care services, primary education
30.88	became essentially free.
32.76	A massive expansion
32.76	of rural health centers
36.64	placed roughly 80 percent
36.64	of the population
39.36	less than a two-hour walk
39.36	from these facilities,
42.56	a truly remarkable accomplishment.
45.36	In 1980, the year of independence,
	were fully immunized.
52.24	By 1990, a mere decade later,
55.56	this proportion stood at 80 percent.
58.92	I felt tremendously privileged
58.92	to be part of this transformation,
64.12	a revolution.
65.6	The excitement,
65.6	the camaraderie, was palpable.
70.12	Working side by side
70.12	with brilliant Zimbabweans --
73.48	scientists, doctors, activists --
76.44	I felt connected not only
76.44	to an African independence movement,
81.44	but to a global progressive
81.44	public health movement.
86.68	But there were daunting challenges.
90.04	Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case
90.04	in 1985, the year I arrived.
95.64	I had taken care of a few patients
95.64	with AIDS in the early 1980s,
99.44	when I did my medical training
99.44	at Harlem Hospital, but --
104.88	we had no idea
104.88	what lay in store for Africa.
109.6	Infection rate stood at about
109.6	two percent in my early days there.
113.36	These would soar
115.2	to one out of every four adults
118.6	by the time I left Harare 17 years later.
122.56	By the mid-1990s,
124.24	I'd told hundreds of people
124.24	in the prime of life
128.4	that they were HIV-positive.
130.64	I saw colleagues and friends die,
133.76	my students, hospital patients, die.
138.72	In response, my colleagues and I
138.72	set up a clinic.
142.16	We did condom demonstrations.
144.72	We launched school education
144.72	and workplace interventions.
150.16	We did research. We counseled
150.16	the partners of infected men
154.76	about how to protect themselves.
156.4	We worked hard, and at the time,
156.4	I believed that I was doing my best.
161.96	I was providing excellent treatment,
164.08	such as it was.
165.84	But I was not talking
165.84	about structural change.
171.24	Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan
171.24	has spoken candidly
175.4	about his personal failure
177.48	leading to the Rwandan genocide.
179.36	In 1994, he was head
179.36	of the UN peacekeeping department.
183.44	At a 10-year memorial for the genocide,
186	"he reflected, ""I believed at the time"
186	I was doing my best,
190.08	but I realized after the genocide
192	that there was more
192	I could and should have done
196.76	"to sound the alarm and rally support."""
202.4	The AIDS epidemic caught
202.4	the health community unprepared,
207.16	and today, when the World
207.16	Health Organization estimates
210.52	that 39 million people
210.52	have lost their lives to this disease,
215.88	I'm not alone in feeling
215.88	remorse and regret
220	at not having done more earlier.
223.96	But while living in Zimbabwe,
226.04	I didn't see my role
226.04	as an advocacy or a political one.
230.76	I was there for my technical skills,
232.72	both my clinical and my research
232.72	epidemiology skills.
237.2	And in my mind, my job
237.2	was to take care of patients
242.2	and to do research to better understand
242.2	the population patterns of transmission,
247.36	and I hoped that we'd slow
247.36	the spread of the virus.
251.52	I was aware that socially marginalized
251.52	populations were at disproportionate risk
256.72	of getting and dying of AIDS.
258.76	And on the sugar plantations,
260.84	which really more closely
260.84	resembled feudal fiefdoms
264.64	than any modern enterprise,
269.32	tested HIV-positive.
272.279	I worked to show how getting infected
272.279	was not a moral failure
276.2	but instead related
276.2	to a culture of male superiority,
280	to forced migrant labor
280	and to colonialism.
283.56	Whites were largely unscathed.
286.96	As health professionals,
288.92	our tools were pitifully weak:
292.2	imploring people to change
292.2	their individual behaviors,
296.08	use condoms, reduce number of partners.
298.96	Infection rates climbed,
302.24	and when treatment
302.24	became available in the West,
306.2	treatment that remains
306.2	our most potent weapon
308.64	against this virus,
310.36	it was unaffordable
310.36	to the public sector across Africa.
314.76	I didn't speak out
316.52	about the unequal access
316.52	to these life-saving drugs
321.2	or about the underlying
321.2	economic and political systems
324.88	that were driving infection rates
327.76	in such huge swaths of the population.
333.4	I rationalized my silence
335.96	by reminding myself
335.96	that I was a guest in the country,
338.92	that sounding the alarm
338.92	could even get me kicked out,
341.88	keep me from doing good work,
343.56	taking care of my patients,
345.08	doing much-needed research.
348.52	So I didn't speak out
349.92	about the government's
349.92	early stance on AIDS.
353.8	I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
357.64	Many doctors, health professionals,
360.84	may think I did nothing wrong.
363.52	Our pact with our patients,
365.56	the Hippocratic Oath and its variants,
368.32	is about the sanctity
368.32	of the patient-doctor relationship.
373.84	And I did everything I could
377.36	for each and every patient of mine.
382.68	But I knew
384.4	that epidemics emerge
384.4	along the fissures of our society,
388.16	reflecting not only biology,
390.2	but more importantly
390.2	patterns of marginalization, exclusion,
395.84	discrimination related to race,
395.84	gender, sexuality, class and more.
402.04	It was true of AIDS.
404.16	It was true just recently of Ebola.
408.88	Medical anthropologists
408.88	such as Paul Farmer,
411.44	who worked on AIDS in Haiti,
413.4	call this structural violence:
416.44	structural because inequities are embedded
420.56	in the political and economic
420.56	organization of our social world,
425.56	often in ways that are invisible
425.56	to those with privilege and power;
431.4	and violence because its impact --
434.52	premature deaths,
434.52	suffering, illness -- is violent.
441.24	We do little for our patients
444.04	if we fail to recognize
446.92	these social injustices.
448.88	Sounding the alarm is the first step
448.88	towards doing public health right,
455.24	and it's how we may rally support
458.32	to break through
458.32	and create real change together.
463.44	So these days, I'm not staying quiet.
466.84	I'm speaking up about a lot of things,
470.04	even when it makes listeners
470.04	uncomfortable,
473.72	even when it makes me uncomfortable.
477.36	And a lot of this
477.36	is about racial disparities
480.48	and institutionalized racism,
483.04	things that we're not supposed
483.04	to have in this country anymore,
486.8	certainly not in the practice of medicine
490.16	or public health.
491.4	But we have them,
493.28	and we pay for them in lives cut short.
498.32	That's why sounding the alarm
501	about the impact of racism on health
501	in the United States,
505.8	the ongoing institutional
505.8	and interpersonal violence
510.12	that people of color face,
512.12	compounded by our tragic legacy
516.48	of 250 years of slavery,
522.8	and 60 years of imperfect equality,
526.72	sounding the alarm about this
529.12	is central to doing my job right
532.48	as New York City's Health Commissioner.
535.76	In New York City, premature mortality --
535.76	that's death before the age of 65 --
540.4	is 50 percent higher
540.4	for black men than white ones.
544.2	A black woman in 2012
547.04	faced more than 10 times
547.04	the risk of dying related to childbirth
551.8	as a white woman.
553.88	And though we've made enormous strides
556.92	in reducing infant mortality rates,
560	a black baby still faces
562.56	nearly three times the risk
562.56	of death in its first year of life
567.8	as compared to a white baby.
571.2	New York City's not exceptional.
573.28	These statistics are paralleled
577.12	by statistics found
577.12	across the United States.
582.24	A recent New York Times analysis
585.52	reported that there are 1.5 million
585.52	missing black men across the country.
593.64	They noted that more than one
596.6	out of every six black men
598.92	who today should be
598.92	between the ages of 25 and 54 years
604.24	have disappeared from daily life,
607.84	lost either to prison or premature death.
612.96	There is great injustice
615.4	in the daily and disproportionate violence
615.4	faced by young black men,
619.4	the focus of recent protests
619.4	under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
625.12	But we have to remember
626.76	that enduring and disparate rates
630.2	and the occurrence and outcome
630.2	of common medical conditions --
634.16	heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV --
637.32	diseases that may kill slowly and quietly
641.6	and take even more
641.6	black lives prematurely.
646.88	As the #BlackLivesMatter
646.88	movement unfolded,
650.76	I felt frustrated and angry
654.32	that the medical community
655.64	has been reluctant
655.64	"to even use the word ""racism"""
660.12	in our research and our work.
662.84	You've probably felt something
662.84	every time I've said it.
666.52	Our medical students
666.52	held die-ins in their white coats,
669.8	but the medical community
669.8	has largely stood by passively
673.84	as ongoing discrimination
673.84	continues to affect
677.28	the disease profile and mortality.
680.12	And I worry
681.92	that the trend towards personalized
681.92	and precision medicine,
686.48	looking for biological or genetic targets
686.48	to better tailor treatment,
691.68	may inadvertently cause us
691.68	to lose sight of the big picture,
696.72	that it is the daily context,
699.24	where a person lives, grows,
702.96	works, loves,
705.44	that most importantly
705.44	determines population health,
710.36	and for too many of us, poor health.
714.36	As health professionals in our daily work,
718.04	whether in the clinic or doing research,
721.76	we are witness to great injustice:
725.16	the homeless person
725.16	who is unable to follow medical advice
728.96	because he has more pressing priorities;
731.4	the transgender youth
731.4	who is contemplating suicide
736.16	because our society is just so harsh;
738.8	the single mother who has been made
738.8	to feel that she is responsible
743.88	for the poor health of her child.
746.96	Our role as health professionals
749.4	is not just to treat our patients
753	but to sound the alarm
755.36	and advocate for change.
759.88	Rightfully or not,
761.6	our societal position
761.6	gives our voices great credibility,
765.6	and we shouldn't waste that.
768.28	I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,
772.68	and I've promised myself
774.96	that as New York City's
774.96	Health Commissioner,
777.6	I will use every opportunity I have
781.92	to sound the alarm
783.8	and rally support for health equity.
786.28	I will speak out against racism,
789.08	and I hope you will join me,
791.24	and I will join you
791.24	when you speak out against sexism
794.6	or any other form of inequality.
797.88	It's time for us to rise up
801.32	and collectively speak up
804.04	about structural inequality.
807.64	We don't have to have all the answers
810.96	to call for change.
813.12	We just need courage.
816.32	The health of our patients,
819.48	the health of us all, depends on it.
823.6	(Applause)
