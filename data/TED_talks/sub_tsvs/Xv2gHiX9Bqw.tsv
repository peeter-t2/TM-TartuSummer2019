12.999	A year ago, we were invited
12.999	by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
16.365	to present our art projects.
18.999	We are used to invitations,
18.999	but this invitation really thrilled us.
23.586	The Swiss Embassy in Berlin is special.
26.451	It is the only old building
26.451	in the government district
29.443	that was not destroyed
29.443	during the Second World War,
32.423	and it sits right next
32.423	to the Federal Chancellery.
35.723	No one is closer to Chancellor Merkel
35.723	than the Swiss diplomats.
39.863	(Laughter)
42.656	The government district in Berlin
42.656	also contains the Reichstag --
46.499	Germany's parliament --
46.499	and the Brandenburg Gate,
49.334	and right next to the gate
49.334	there are other embassies,
52.299	in particular the US
52.299	and the British Embassy.
56.657	Although Germany is an advanced democracy,
59.897	citizens are limited
59.897	in their constitutional rights
62.882	in its government district.
64.299	The right of assembly and the right
64.299	to demonstrate are restricted there.
69.607	And this is interesting
69.607	from an artistic point of view.
73.299	The opportunities to exercise
73.299	participation and to express oneself
78.035	are always bound to a certain order
80.299	and always subject
80.299	to a specific regulation.
83.798	With an awareness of the dependencies
83.798	of these regulations,
88.581	we can gain a new perspective.
91.299	The given terms and conditions
91.299	shape our perception, our actions
95.977	and our lives.
98.168	And this is crucial in another context.
101.299	Over the last couple of years,
102.801	we learned that from the roofs
102.801	of the US and the British Embassy,
107.299	the secret services have been listening
107.299	to the entire district,
112.06	including the mobile phone
112.06	of Angela Merkel.
115.299	The antennas of the British GCHQ are
115.299	hidden in a white cylindrical radome,
120.299	while the listening post
120.299	of the American NSA
123.34	is covered by radio transparent screens.
127.342	But how to address these hidden
127.342	and disguised forces?
130.903	With my colleague, Christoph Wachter,
133.299	we accepted the invitation
133.299	of the Swiss Embassy.
136.783	And we used this opportunity
136.783	to exploit the specific situation.
142.508	If people are spying on us,
142.508	it stands to reason
145.674	that they have to listen
145.674	to what we are saying.
148.299	(Laughter)
152.299	On the roof of the Swiss Embassy,
152.299	we installed a series of antennas.
158.729	They weren't as sophisticated as those
158.729	used by the Americans and the British.
163.007	(Laughter)
164.298	They were makeshift can antennas,
166.045	not camouflaged but totally
166.045	obvious and visible.
170.299	The Academy of Arts joined the project,
172.818	and so we built another
172.818	large antenna on their rooftop,
176.532	exactly between the listening posts
176.532	of the NSA and the GCHQ.
180.574	(Laughter)
182.454	Never have we been observed in such detail
182.454	while building an art installation.
187.299	A helicopter circled over our heads
189.575	with a camera registering
189.575	each and every move we made,
192.829	and on the roof of the US Embassy,
192.829	security officers patrolled.
197.499	Although the government district
197.499	is governed by a strict police order,
202.712	there are no specific laws
202.712	relating to digital communication.
207.548	Our installation
207.548	was therefore perfectly legal,
211.055	and the Swiss Ambassador
211.055	informed Chancellor Merkel about it.
215.101	"We named the project ""Can You Hear Me?"""
218.004	(Laughter)
220.805	The antennas created an open
220.805	and free Wi-Fi communication network
225.09	in which anyone who wanted to
225.09	would be able to participate
228.299	using any Wi-Fi-enabled device
228.299	without any hindrance,
231.435	and be able to send messages
233.38	to those listening on the frequencies
233.38	that were being intercepted.
238.51	Text messages, voice chat, file sharing --
241.029	anything could be sent anonymously.
244.852	And people did communicate.
247.299	Over 15,000 messages were sent.
250.299	Here are some examples.
253.299	"""Hello world, hello Berlin,"
253.299	"hello NSA, hello GCHQ."""
259.208	"""NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing!"
259.208	"Blow the whistle!"""
264.884	"""This is the NSA. In God we trust."
264.884	"All others we track!!!!!"""
268.612	(Laughter)
272.233	"""#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ -"
272.233	we are part of your organizations.
276.299	"# expect us. We will #shutdown"""
279.483	"""This is the NSA's Achilles heel."
279.483	"Open Networks."""
282.967	"""Agents, what twisted story of yourself"
282.967	"will you tell your grandchildren?"""
288.454	"""@NSA My neighbors are noisy."
288.454	"Please send a drone strike."""
292.894	(Laughter)
296.529	"""Make Love, Not cyberwar."""
299.602	We invited the embassies
299.602	and the government departments
302.299	to participate in the open network, too,
305.129	and to our surprise, they did.
307.066	Files appeared on the network,
307.066	including classified documents
310.01	leaked from the parliamentary
310.01	investigation commission,
312.652	which highlights that the free exchange
312.652	and discussion of vital information
316.366	is starting to become difficult,
316.366	even for members of a parliament.
321.746	We also organized guided tours
321.746	to experience and sound out
325.092	the power constellations on-site.
327.166	The tours visited the restricted zones
327.166	around the embassies,
330.527	and we discussed the potential
330.527	and the highlights of communication.
336.299	If we become aware of the constellation,
340.502	the terms and conditions of communication,
343.322	it not only broadens our horizon,
345.677	it allows us to look behind
345.677	the regulations that limit our worldview,
349.573	our specific social, political
349.573	or aesthetic conventions.
354.461	Let's look at an actual example.
357.383	The fate of people living
357.383	in the makeshift settlements
360.494	on the outskirts of Paris
362.245	is hidden and faded from view.
365.299	It's a vicious circle.
367.299	It's not poverty, not racism,
367.299	not exclusion that are new.
370.575	What is new is how
370.575	these realities are hidden
374.117	and how people are made invisible
375.769	in an age of global and overwhelming
375.769	communication and exchange.
380.595	Such makeshift settlements
380.595	are considered illegal,
383.454	and therefore those living in them
383.454	don't have a chance
386.75	of making their voices heard.
388.575	On the contrary, every time they appear,
388.575	every time they risk becoming visible,
394.025	merely gives grounds
394.025	for further persecution,
396.759	expulsion and suppression.
398.792	What interested us was how we could
398.792	come to know this hidden side.
404.02	We were searching for an interface
404.02	and we found one.
407.433	It's not a digital interface,
407.433	but a physical one: it's a hotel.
411.72	"We named the project ""Hotel Gelem."""
414.783	Together with Roma families,
414.783	we created several Hotel Gelems in Europe,
418.64	for example, in Freiburg in Germany,
418.64	in Montreuil near Paris,
421.623	and also in the Balkans.
423.299	These are real hotels.
424.684	People can stay there.
426.299	But they aren't a commercial enterprise.
428.299	They are a symbol.
430.575	You can go online and ask
430.575	for a personal invitation
434.251	to come and live for a few days
434.251	in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes,
438.661	eating, working and living
438.661	with the Roma families.
442.748	Here, the Roma families
442.748	are not the travelers;
445.939	the visitors are.
447.584	Here, the Roma families
447.584	are not a minority;
450.663	the visitors are.
453.833	The point is not to make judgments,
457.826	but rather to find out
457.826	about the context that determines
460.604	these disparate and seemingly
460.604	insurmountable contradictions.
464.299	In the world of globalization,
466.563	the continents are drifting
466.563	closer to each other.
469.299	Cultures, goods and people
469.299	are in permanent exchange,
471.847	but at the same time, the gap
471.847	between the world of the privileged
475.125	and the world of the excluded is growing.
479.591	We were recently in Australia.
481.299	For us, it was no problem
481.299	to enter the country.
483.924	We have European passports,
483.924	visas and air tickets.
487.059	But asylum seekers who arrive
487.059	by boat in Australia
490.785	are deported or taken to prison.
493.299	The interception of the boats
494.798	and the disappearance of the people
494.798	into the detention system
497.903	are veiled by the Australian authorities.
501.062	These procedures are declared
501.062	to be secret military operations.
505.768	After dramatic escapes
505.768	from crisis zones and war zones,
508.936	men, women and children
508.936	are detained by Australia without trial,
513.071	sometimes for years.
517.036	During our stay, however,
519.156	we managed to reach out and work
519.156	with asylum seekers who were imprisoned,
523.299	despite strict screening and isolation.
526.057	From these contexts was born
526.057	an installation in the art space
530.19	of the Queensland University
530.19	of Technology in Brisbane.
534.635	On the face of it,
534.635	it was a very simple installation.
538.182	On the floor, a stylized compass
538.182	gave the direction
541.611	to each immigration detention center,
543.643	accompanied by the distance
543.643	and the name of the immigration facility.
548.299	But the exhibition step
548.299	came in the form of connectivity.
552.642	Above every floor marking,
552.642	there was a headset.
556.299	Visitors were offered the opportunity
556.299	to talk directly to a refugee
560.939	who was or had been imprisoned
563.299	in a specific detention facility
565.511	and engage in a personal conversation.
568.916	In the protected context
568.916	of the art exhibition,
571.806	asylum seekers felt free
571.806	to talk about themselves,
574.457	their story and their situation,
574.457	without fear of consequences.
578.694	Visitors immersed themselves
578.694	in long conversations
581.73	about families torn apart,
581.73	about dramatic escapes from war zones,
585.507	about suicide attempts,
587.143	about the fate of children in detention.
590.618	Emotions ran deep. Many wept.
592.626	Several revisited the exhibition.
595.032	It was a powerful experience.
598.459	Europe is now facing a stream of migrants.
603.413	The situation for the asylum seekers
603.413	is made worse by contradictory policies
607.299	and the temptation
607.299	of militarized responses.
611.299	We have also established
611.299	communication systems
614.013	in remote refugee centers
614.013	in Switzerland and Greece.
617.622	They are all about providing
617.622	basic information -- weather forecasts,
620.877	legal information, guidance.
623.163	But they are significant.
625.211	Information on the Internet
626.553	that could ensure survival
626.553	along dangerous routes
629.307	is being censored,
630.724	and the provision of such information
630.724	is becoming increasingly criminalized.
636.601	This brings us back to our network
636.601	and to the antennas
639.675	on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin
641.929	"and the ""Can You Hear Me?"" project."
644.725	We should not take it for granted
644.725	to be boundlessly connected.
647.959	We should start making
647.959	our own connections,
650.016	fighting for this idea of an equal
650.016	and globally interconnected world.
654.54	This is essential to overcome
654.54	our speechlessness
657.299	and the separation provoked
657.299	by rival political forces.
660.839	It is only in truly exposing ourselves
664.054	to the transformative power
664.054	of this experience
666.944	that we can overcome
666.944	prejudice and exclusion.
670.299	Thank you.
671.477	(Applause)
676.835	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Mathias.
678.546	The other half of your
678.546	artistic duo is also here.
680.895	Christoph Wachter, come onstage.
682.556	(Applause)
687.938	First, tell me just a detail:
689.367	the name of the hotel
689.367	is not a random name.
691.47	Gelem means something specific
691.47	in the Roma language.
694.755	"Mathias Jud: Yes, ""Gelem, Gelem"""
694.755	is the title of the Romani hymn,
699.597	the official, and it means
699.597	"""I went a long way."""
702.98	BG: That's just to add
702.98	the detail to your talk.
705.223	But you two traveled
705.223	to the island of Lesbos
707.931	very recently, you're just back
707.931	a couple of days ago,
710.646	in Greece, where thousands
710.646	of refugees are arriving
713.078	and have been arriving
713.078	over the last few months.
715.39	What did you see there
715.39	and what did you do there?
717.856	Christoph Wachter: Well, Lesbos is one
717.856	of the Greek islands close to Turkey,
721.681	and during our stay,
723.1	many asylum seekers arrived by boat
723.1	on overcrowded dinghies,
728.545	and after landing, they were left
728.545	completely on their own.
732.228	They are denied many services.
736.043	For example, they are not allowed
736.043	to buy a bus ticket
738.561	or to rent a hotel room,
739.99	so many families literally
739.99	sleep in the streets.
744.7	And we installed networks there
744.7	to allow basic communication,
749.36	because I think, I believe,
751.487	it's not only that we have to speak
751.487	about the refugees,
756.95	I think we need to start talking to them.
760.655	And by doing so, we can realize
760.655	that it is about human beings,
764.299	about their lives
764.299	and their struggle to survive.
767.086	BG: And allow them to talk as well.
769.02	Christoph, thank you for coming to TED.
770.959	Mathias, thank you for coming to TED
770.959	and sharing your story.
774.001	(Applause)
