13.12	As a lover of human anatomy,
15.56	I'm so excited that we're finally
15.56	putting our bodies at the center of focus.
19.6	Through practices
19.6	such as preventive medicine,
22.2	patient empowerment
23.68	and self-monitoring --
25.28	down to now obsessing
25.28	over every single step we take in a day.
29.84	All of this works to promote
31.48	a healthy connection
31.48	between ourselves and our bodies.
37.64	Despite all this focus
37.64	on the healthy self,
41.04	general public knowledge
41.04	of the anatomical self is lacking.
45.8	Many people don't know
45.8	the location of their vital organs,
48.539	or even how they function.
50.32	And that's because human anatomy
52.8	is a difficult and time-intensive
52.8	subject to learn.
56.72	How many of you here
56.72	made it through anatomy?
59.88	Wow, good --
61.12	most of you are in medicine.
63.48	I, like you, spent countless hours
63.48	memorizing hundreds of structures.
69	Something no student of anatomy
69	could do without the help of visuals.
75.48	Because at the end of the day,
76.959	whether you remember
76.959	every little structure or not,
79.64	these medical illustrations are what
79.64	makes studying anatomy so intriguing.
84.24	In looking at them,
85.72	we're actually viewing
85.72	a manual of our very selves.
90.28	But what happens when we're done studying?
92.96	These beautiful illustrations
92.96	are then shut back
96	into the pages of a medical textbook,
98	or an app,
99.24	referenced only when needed.
101.32	And for the public,
102.68	medical illustrations
102.68	may only be encountered passively
105.56	on the walls of a doctor's office.
108.28	From the beginnings of modern medicine,
110.44	medical illustration,
111.76	and therefore anatomy,
113.36	have existed primarily within
113.36	the realm of medical education.
118.4	Yet there's something fascinating
118.4	happening right now.
121.52	Artists are breaking anatomy
121.52	out of the confines of the medical world
125.04	and are thrusting it
125.04	into the public space.
127.92	For the past nine years,
127.92	I have been cataloguing and sharing
130.8	this rise in anatomical art
130.8	with the public --
133.32	all from my perspective
133.32	as a medical illustrator.
137.24	But before I get into showing you
137.24	how artists are reclaiming anatomy today,
141.84	it's important to understand
141.84	how art influenced anatomy in the past.
147.08	Now, anatomy is by its
147.08	very nature a visual science,
150	and the first anatomists to understand
150	this lived during the Renaissance.
154.36	They relied on artists
156.36	to help advertise their discoveries
156.36	to their peers in the public.
160.68	And this drive to not only teach
160.68	but also to entertain
165.96	resulted in some of the strangest
165.96	anatomical illustrations.
171.96	Anatomy was caught in a struggle
171.96	between science, art and culture
176.16	that lasted for over 500 years.
181.2	Artists rendered
181.2	dissected cadavers as alive,
186.88	posed in these humorous
186.88	anatomical stripteases.
190.32	Imagine seeing that
190.32	in your textbooks today.
194.08	They also showed them as very much dead --
197.88	unwillingly stripped of their skin.
201.8	Disembodied limbs were often
201.8	posed in literal still lives.
208.52	And some illustrations
208.52	even included pop culture references.
212.68	This is Clara,
214	a famous rhinoceros that was
214	traveling Europe in the mid-1700s,
217.36	at a time when seeing a rhino
217.36	was an exciting rarity.
220.4	Including her in this illustration
220.4	was akin to celebrity sponsorship today.
226.72	The introduction of color
229.08	then brought a whole new
229.08	depth and clarity to anatomy
232.16	that made it stunning.
236.36	By the early 20th century,
237.8	the perfect balance of science
237.8	and art had finally been struck
241.28	with the emergence
241.28	of medical illustrators.
244.12	They created a universal
244.12	representation of anatomy --
247	something that was neither alive nor dead,
249.88	that was free from those influences
249.88	of artistic culture.
254.36	And this focus on no-frills accuracy
256.92	was precisely for the benefit
256.92	of medical education.
260.56	And this is what we
260.56	get to study from today.
266.44	But why is it that medical illustration --
268.92	both past and present --
270.519	captures our imaginations?
273.12	Now, we are innately tuned
273.12	into the beauty of the human body.
277.8	And medical illustration is still art.
282.24	Nothing can elicit
282.24	an emotional response --
284.88	from joy to complete disgust --
287.48	more than the human body.
289.4	And today,
290.64	artists armed with that emotion,
293.04	are grasping anatomy
293.04	from the medical world,
295.76	and are reinvigorating it through art
295.76	in the most imaginative ways.
301.72	A perfect example of this is Spanish
301.72	contemporary artist Fernando Vicente.
307.04	He takes 19th century anatomical
307.04	illustrations of the male body
313.08	and envelops them in a female sensuality.
318.48	The women in his paintings taunt us
318.48	to view beyond their surface anatomy,
323.48	thereby introducing a strong femininity
326.44	that was previously lacking in the history
326.44	of anatomical representation.
332.04	Artistry can also be seen in the repair
332.04	and recovery of the human body.
337.24	This is an X-ray of a woman
337.24	who fractured and dislocated her ankle
340.4	in a roller-skating accident.
342.48	As a tribute to her trauma,
344.72	she commissioned Montreal-based
344.72	architect Federico Carbajal
348.44	to construct a wire sculpture
348.44	of her damaged lower leg.
353.36	Now, notice those bright red screws
353.36	magnified in the sculpture.
357.68	These are the actual surgical screws
357.68	used in reconstructing her ankle.
362.64	It's medical hardware
362.64	that's been repurposed as art.
368.76	People often ask me how I choose
368.76	the art that I showcase online
372.48	or feature in gallery shows.
374.44	And for me it's a balance
374.44	between the technique
377.12	and a concept that pushes the boundaries
377.12	of anatomy as a way to know thyself,
381.88	which is why the work
381.88	of Michael Reedy struck me.
385.48	His serious figure drawings
385.48	are often layered in elements of humor.
389.6	For instance, take a look at her face.
393.84	Notice those red marks.
396.2	Michael manifests the consuming
396.2	insecurity of a skin condition
400.52	as these maniacal cartoon monsters
402.52	annoying and out of control
402.52	in the background.
405.52	On the mirrored figure,
407.64	he renders the full anatomy
409.8	and covers it in glitter,
411.96	making it look like candy.
414.64	By doing this,
415.88	Michael downplays
415.88	the common perception of anatomy
418.28	so closely tied to just disease and death.
423.68	Now, this next concept
423.68	might not make much sense,
426.64	but human anatomy
426.64	is no longer limited to humans.
430.4	When you were a child,
431.68	did you ever wish
431.68	that your toys could come to life?
434.16	Well, Jason Freeny
434.16	makes those dreams come true
436.4	with his magical toy dissections.
438.04	(Laughter)
440.64	One might think that this
440.64	would bring a morbid edge
443.08	to one's innocent childhood characters,
445.56	but Jason says of his dissections,
448.08	"""One thing I've never seen"
448.08	"in a child's reaction to my work is fear."""
453.64	It's always wonder,
455.2	amazement
456.6	and wanting to explore.
458.68	Fear of anatomy and guts
458.68	is a learned reaction.
464.04	This anatomization also extends to
464.04	politically and socially charged objects.
471.36	"In Noah Scalin's ""Anatomy of War,"""
473.48	we see a gun dissected
473.48	to reveal human organs.
477.8	But if you look closely,
479.92	you'll notice that it lacks a brain.
482.96	And if you keep looking,
482.96	you might also notice
485.16	that Noah has so thoughtfully
485.16	placed the rectum
488.28	at the business end of that gun barrel.
493.64	Now, this next artist
493.64	I've been following for many years,
496.88	watching him excite
496.88	the public about anatomy.
501.08	Danny Quirk is a young artist
503.24	who paints his subjects
503.24	in the process of self-dissection.
507.56	He bends the rules of medical illustration
509.64	by inserting a very dramatic
509.64	light and shadow.
512.8	And this creates a 3-D illusion
515.2	that lends itself very well
515.2	to painting directly on the human skin.
521.52	Danny makes it look as if a person's
521.52	skin has actually been removed.
526.08	And this effect --
527.799	also cool and tattoo-like --
530.96	easily transitions
530.96	into a medical illustration.
535.24	Now Danny is currently
535.24	traveling the world,
537.32	teaching anatomy to the public
537.32	via his body paintings,
540.36	which is why it was
540.36	so shocking to find out
542.44	that he was rejected
542.44	from medical illustration programs.
545.88	But he's doing just fine.
550.2	Then there are artists
551.76	who are extracting anatomy from both
551.76	the medical world and the art world
555.56	and are placing it
555.56	directly on the streets.
558.4	London-based SHOK-1 paints
558.4	giant X-rays of pop culture icons.
563.2	His X-rays show how culture
563.2	can come to have an anatomy of its own,
567.48	and conversely how culture can become
567.48	part of the anatomy of a person.
572	You come to admire his work
573.36	because reproducing X-rays by hand,
573.36	let alone with spray paint,
576.44	is extremely difficult.
578.52	But then again this is a street artist,
580.44	who also happens to hold
580.44	a degree in applied chemistry.
585.12	Nychos, an Austrian street artist,
587.64	"takes the term ""exploded view"""
587.64	to a whole new level,
590.76	splattering human and animal dissections
590.76	on walls all over the world.
595.68	Influenced by comics and heavy metal,
598.32	Nychos inserts a very youthful
598.32	and enticing energy into anatomy
603.16	that I just love.
606.96	Street artists believe
606.96	that art belongs to the public.
610.8	And this street anatomy is so captivating
613.68	because it is the furthest removed
613.68	from the medical world.
616.92	It forces you to look at it,
618.56	and confront your own
618.56	perceptions about anatomy,
621.4	whether you find it beautiful,
623.68	gross,
624.92	morbid
626.16	or awe-inspiring, like I do.
628.92	That it elicits these responses at all
630.88	is due to our intimate
630.88	and often changing relationship with it.
636.12	All of the artists
636.12	that I showed you here today
638.36	referenced medical
638.36	illustrations for their art.
641.04	But for them,
642.28	anatomy isn't just something to memorize,
645	but a base from which to understand
645	the human body on a meaningful level;
650.08	to depict it in ways that we can relate,
652.48	whether it be through cartoons,
654.84	body painting
656.08	or street art.
657.84	Anatomical art has the power
660.08	to reach far beyond
660.08	the pages of a medical textbook,
663.12	to ignite an excitement in the public,
665.32	and reinvigorate an enthusiasm
665.32	in the medical world,
668.76	ultimately connecting our innermost selves
668.76	with our bodies through art.
675.88	Thank you.
677.12	(Applause)
