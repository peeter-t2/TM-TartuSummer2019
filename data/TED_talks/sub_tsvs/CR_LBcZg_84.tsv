15.66	The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do
18.511	is almost like the weatherman.
20.677	We are always chasing storms.
24.193	We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms, that is.
29.076	And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives,
31.844	but we rarely see or listen to one.
35.294	So I always like to start these talks
36.928	by actually introducing you to one of them.
39.91	Actually, the first time we recorded more than one neuron --
43.337	a hundred brain cells simultaneously --
45.56	we could measure the electrical sparks
48.029	of a hundred cells in the same animal,
50.709	this is the first image we got,
52.511	the first 10 seconds of this recording.
54.826	So we got a little snippet of a thought,
58.177	and we could see it in front of us.
61.082	I always tell the students
62.094	that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer,
66.2	because we are dealing with a system
67.826	that is only comparable in terms of number of cells
70.743	to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe.
73.679	And here we are, out of billions of neurons,
76.709	just recording, 10 years ago, a hundred.
79.527	We are doing a thousand now.
81.11	And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature.
86.51	Because, if you don't know yet,
88.442	everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms,
93.692	comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains
98.343	and define our memories, our beliefs,
102.228	our feelings, our plans for the future.
104.928	Everything that we ever do,
107.326	everything that every human has ever done, do or will do,
112.393	requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms.
117.827	And the sound of a brainstorm, if you've never heard one,
120.31	is somewhat like this.
123.659	You can put it louder if you can.
126.805	"My son calls this ""making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station."""
133.208	This is a brain.
134.693	This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker
138.127	and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing,
140.993	your brain will sound like this -- my brain, any brain.
145.615	And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time
149.377	is to actually listen to these symphonies, these brain symphonies,
154.727	and try to extract from them the messages they carry.
158.127	In particular, about 12 years ago
160.978	we created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces.
164.026	And you have a scheme here that describes how it works.
166.728	The idea is, let's have some sensors that listen to these storms, this electrical firing,
172.294	and see if you can, in the same time that it takes
175.376	for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal --
180.345	about half a second --
183.209	let's see if we can read these signals,
185.56	extract the motor messages that are embedded in it,
188.96	translate it into digital commands
191.232	and send it to an artificial device
193.118	that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time.
199.011	And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message
202.859	when we compare to the way the body does that.
206.377	And if we can actually provide feedback,
209.243	sensory signals that go back from this robotic, mechanical, computational actuator
214.977	that is now under the control of the brain,
217.228	back to the brain,
218.539	how the brain deals with that,
220.66	of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery.
225.561	And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
227.882	We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora
230.843	that became one of the superstars of this field.
233.311	And Aurora liked to play video games.
235.61	As you can see here,
236.983	she likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.
241.927	And as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.
246.598	So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross
250.881	with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick,
253.731	Aurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.
257.682	And if she's doing that,
259.151	because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor,
262.465	she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice.
265.415	And I can tell you, any monkey will do anything for you
268.365	if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice.
271.465	Actually any primate will do that.
274.196	Think about that.
275.53	Well, while Aurora was playing this game, as you saw,
278.93	and doing a thousand trials a day
281.365	and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice,
285.248	we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head
288.647	and sending them to a robotic arm
290.294	that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making.
294.165	Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface
297.948	and have Aurora play the game just by thinking,
302.648	without interference of her body.
305.265	Her brainstorms would control an arm
308.181	that would move the cursor and cross the target.
310.89	And to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.
314.081	She played the game without moving her body.
318.281	So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now,
320.518	this is the exact first moment she got that.
323.73	That's the exact first moment
325.514	a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate
332.281	and could act outside, in that outside world,
335.981	just by controlling an artificial device.
338.947	And Aurora kept playing the game, kept finding the little target
343.864	and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get, that she craved for.
347.781	Well, she did that because she, at that time, had acquired a new arm.
354.482	The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later,
357.445	after the first video that I showed to you,
360.131	is under the control of Aurora's brain
362.781	and is moving the cursor to get to the target.
365.949	And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm,
369.848	but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases.
375.564	She can scratch her back, she can scratch one of us, she can play another game.
379.631	By all purposes and means,
381.231	Aurora's brain has incorporated that artificial device
385.347	as an extension of her body.
388.097	The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind
391.63	has been expanded to get one more arm.
395.714	Well, we did that 10 years ago.
398.064	Just fast forward 10 years.
400.897	Just last year we realized that you don't even need to have a robotic device.
405.88	You can just build a computational body, an avatar, a monkey avatar.
411.364	And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them,
415.614	or you can train them to assume in a virtual world
420.053	the first-person perspective of that avatar
423.097	and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar's arms or legs.
428.748	And what we did basically was to train the animals
431.514	to learn how to control these avatars
434.564	and explore objects that appear in the virtual world.
438.463	And these objects are visually identical,
440.764	but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects,
444.647	they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object
451.047	that goes back directly to the monkey's brain,
455.063	informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching.
460.115	And in just four weeks, the brain learns to process this new sensation
464.88	and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense.
471.314	And you truly liberate the brain now
473.73	because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar.
478.114	And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain
483.114	without the interference of the skin.
485.547	So what you see here is this is the design of the task.
488.081	You're going to see an animal basically touching these three targets.
492.331	And he has to select one because only one carries the reward,
496.68	the orange juice that they want to get.
498.547	And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm, an arm that doesn't exist.
504.18	And that's exactly what they do.
506.18	This is a complete liberation of the brain
509.615	from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task.
513.897	The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets.
518.064	And he's sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain.
523.715	And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward.
527.598	The legends that you see in the movie don't appear for the monkey.
531.43	And by the way, they don't read English anyway,
533.914	so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position.
539.13	And yet, they can find them by tactile discrimination,
543.064	and they can press it and select it.
546.281	So when we look at the brains of these animals,
548.963	on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells
552.63	showing what happens with the brain activity, the electrical storms,
556.831	of this sample of neurons in the brain
558.898	when the animal is using a joystick.
561.014	And that's a picture that every neurophysiologist knows.
563.614	The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions.
568.797	The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving
574.48	and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar.
580.614	As fast as we can reset our computers,
583.68	the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool,
589.498	as if this too was a part of that primate's body.
594.748	The brain is assimilating that too, as fast as we can measure.
599.463	So that suggests to us that our sense of self
603.081	does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies,
607.231	but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we're commanding with our brains.
612.949	Our violins, our cars, our bicycles, our soccer balls, our clothing --
617.713	they all become assimilated by this voracious, amazing, dynamic system called the brain.
624.564	How far can we take it?
626.263	Well, in an experiment that we ran a few years ago, we took this to the limit.
630.481	We had an animal running on a treadmill
632.963	at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States,
635.23	producing the brainstorms necessary to move.
637.93	And we had a robotic device, a humanoid robot,
642.021	in Kyoto, Japan at ATR Laboratories
644.415	that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain,
650.509	a human brain, or a primate brain.
653.782	What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey
658.38	was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk
661.847	while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke,
665.914	so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her.
671.147	So she could be rewarded, not by what her body was doing
675.214	but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet
680.175	controlled by her brain activity.
682.784	Funny thing, that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less
689.902	than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head, the head of the monkey,
694.052	and reach its own muscle.
697.922	The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger, across the planet.
703.952	This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously.
710.352	This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan
715.619	under the control of the brain activity of a primate.
719.319	So where are we taking all this?
721.308	What are we going to do with all this research,
723.651	besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears?
729.319	Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology
734.152	and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world.
739.636	Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms
744.219	into action, into movement.
746.335	Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements,
751.569	they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord.
756.736	So our idea is to create a bypass,
759.186	is to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals,
763.218	larger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again,
767.268	bypass the lesion using computational microengineering
771.237	and send it to a new body, a whole body called an exoskeleton,
778.351	a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients.
783.918	And you can see an image produced by this consortium.
788.044	This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project
792.103	that is putting together scientists from Europe,
794.886	from here in the United States, and in Brazil
796.751	together to work to actually get this new body built --
801.268	a body that we believe, through the same plastic mechanisms
804.602	that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface
810.404	and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life.
816.034	This same mechanism, we hope, will allow these patients,
819.718	not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make
823.486	and translate them into movements of this new body,
826.693	but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls.
833.451	So I was told about 10 years ago
837.302	that this would never happen, that this was close to impossible.
842.368	And I can only tell you that as a scientist,
844.819	I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid-'60s
847.805	watching a few crazy guys telling [us] that they would go to the Moon.
852.853	And I was five years old,
854.314	and I never understood why NASA didn't hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job;
858.554	after all, they were very proficient --
860.986	but just seeing that as a kid
864.436	made me believe, as my grandmother used to tell me,
867.421	"that ""impossible is just the possible"
869.266	"that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true."""
873.17	So they told me that it's impossible to make someone walk.
876.969	I think I'm going to follow my grandmother's advice.
880.22	Thank you.
881.67	(Applause)
