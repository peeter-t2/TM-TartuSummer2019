15.728	I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,
20.259	how globalized we aren't,
22.767	and why it's important to actually be accurate
26.311	in making those kinds of assessments.
29.092	And the leading point of view on this, whether measured
32.832	by number of books sold, mentions in media,
37.023	or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from
40.239	my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,
44.316	is this view that national borders
47.43	really don't matter very much anymore,
50.983	cross-border integration is close to complete,
55.039	and we live in one world.
57.334	And what's interesting about this view
59.566	is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers
63.16	like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,
67.934	but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant
71.86	globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives
76.751	if it hasn't already done so.
79.635	The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.
83.659	I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent
87.37	some time going back, trying to see the first mention
91.351	of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote
95.07	that I could find was one from David Livingstone,
98.914	writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,
104.959	and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly
109.426	with the rest of the world.
112.797	Now clearly, David Livingstone
114.977	was a little bit ahead of his time,
117.997	but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,
121.54	"""Just how global are we?"""
123.636	before we think about where we go from here.
126.339	So the best way I've found of trying to get people
130.877	to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,
135.526	may not even be close to flat, is with some data.
139.541	So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years
142.92	is really compiling data on things that could either happen
146.887	within national borders or across national borders,
151.042	and I've looked at the cross-border component
154.545	as a percentage of the total.
156.958	I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,
160.923	but let me just give you a few data points.
164.529	I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,
168.863	one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,
173.731	and, of course, trade in products and services.
177.212	So let's start off with plain old telephone service.
181.791	Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,
186.884	what percentage do you think were accounted for
191.532	by cross-border phone calls?
193.857	Pick a percentage in your own mind.
197.933	The answer turns out to be two percent.
201.028	If you include Internet telephony, you might be able
205.166	to push this number up to six or seven percent,
208.593	but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.
213.25	Or let's turn to people moving across borders.
216.995	One particular thing we might look at, in terms of
220.212	long-term flows of people, is what percentage
223.939	of the world's population is accounted for
227.451	by first-generation immigrants?
230.459	Again, please pick a percentage.
234.754	Turns out to be a little bit higher.
237.179	It's actually about three percent.
240.246	Or think of investment. Take all the real investment
245.117	that went on in the world in 2010.
248.285	What percentage of that was accounted for
251.141	by foreign direct investment?
255.078	Not quite ten percent.
258.445	And then finally, the one statistic
261.084	that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:
264.261	the export-to-GDP ratio.
266.989	If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate
270.758	a little bit above 30 percent.
273.317	However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,
278.406	in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier
283.337	ships something to China to be put into an iPod,
286.949	and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,
289.75	that component ends up getting counted multiple times.
293.587	So nobody knows how bad this bias
296.356	with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would
300.143	ask the person who's spearheading the effort
302.727	to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,
305.992	the Director of the World Trade Organization,
308.504	what his best guess would be
310.831	of exports as a percentage of GDP,
314.006	without the double- and triple-counting,
316.429	and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than
320.963	the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.
324.732	So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers
328.915	or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,
332.483	"""World 3.0,"" that we're very, very far from"
336.87	the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply
340.924	internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.
347.827	So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors
351.435	have overstated the case.
354.395	But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,
358.587	who are prone to this kind of overstatement.
361.812	I've also spent some time surveying audiences
365.209	in different parts of the world
367.207	on what they actually guess these numbers to be.
371.267	Let me share with you the results of a survey
374.336	that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run
377.675	of its readership as to what people's guesses
381.195	along these dimensions actually were.
385.61	So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.
391.545	First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.
396.46	Okay. (Laughter)
399.263	Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities
404.736	whose average value is less than 10 percent,
407.715	you have people guessing three, four times that level.
411.817	Even though I'm an economist, I find that
414.905	a pretty large error.
417.309	And third, this is not just confined to the readers
421.171	of the Harvard Business Review.
423.131	I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts
426.529	of the world, and in all cases except one,
429.879	where a group actually underestimated
432.751	the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency
437.063	towards overestimation, and so I thought it important
440.222	to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to
443.527	as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars
448.104	and the light gray bars.
451.111	Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be
455.247	a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important
459.439	to just spend a little bit of time thinking about
462.703	why we might be prone to globaloney.
466.462	A couple of different reasons come to mind.
469.305	First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.
473.607	Let me give you an example. When I first published
476.788	some of these data a few years ago
479.384	in a magazine called Foreign Policy,
481.921	one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,
485.491	was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled
489.446	"""Why the World Isn't Flat,"" that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)"
494.356	What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,
498.637	"which was, ""Ghemawat's data are narrow."""
503.575	And this caused me to scratch my head, because
506.594	as I went back through his several-hundred-page book,
509.731	I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,
514.364	reference or footnote.
517.092	So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here
521.699	to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you
525.091	to go away and look for your own data
528.076	to try and actually assess whether some of these
531.564	hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with
535.925	actually are correct.
537.837	So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.
541.369	A second reason has to do with peer pressure.
545.284	I remember, I decided to write my
548.465	"""Why the World Isn't Flat"" article, because"
551.09	I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,
554.279	and the interviewer's first question to me was,
557.954	"""Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe"
561.905	"that the world is round?"" And I started laughing,"
566.085	because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)
569.858	And as I was laughing, I was thinking,
572.197	I really need a more coherent response, especially
575.084	on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)
579.194	But what I can't quite capture for you
582.163	was the pity and disbelief
584.763	with which the interviewer asked her question.
588.241	The perspective was, here is this poor professor.
592.581	He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.
597.267	He really has no idea
599.915	as to what's actually going on in the world.
602.873	So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,
606.346	if you like. You'll find that it's very cool
609.787	to talk about the world being one, etc.
613.075	If you raise questions about that formulation,
616.378	you really are considered a bit of an antique.
620.275	And then the final reason, which I mention,
623.729	especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,
627.442	"has to do with what I call ""techno-trances."""
630.787	If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,
634.314	it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)
637.666	Something similar seems to happen
641.124	with exaggerated conceptions of how technology
646.434	is going to overpower in the very immediate run
650.603	all cultural barriers, all political barriers,
653.936	all geographic barriers, because at this point
657.529	I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,
660.113	but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,
663.086	hands go up, and people ask me,
665.85	"""Yeah, but what about Facebook?"""
669.329	And I got this question often enough that I thought
671.942	I'd better do some research on Facebook.
674.69	Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology
678.41	to think about. Theoretically, it makes it
682.079	as easy to form friendships halfway around the world
685.457	as opposed to right next door.
688.459	What percentage of people's friends on Facebook
694.545	are actually located in countries other than where
697.665	people we're analyzing are based?
700.938	The answer is probably somewhere between
707.161	Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local
710.972	or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level
715.979	that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.
719.385	We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random
723.377	on Facebook. The technology is overlaid
728.199	on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,
732.934	and those relationships are what the technology
736.002	doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why
739.233	we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends
743.277	being located in countries other than where we are.
747.085	So does all this matter? Or is globaloney
752.566	just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention
757.978	to globalization-related issues?
760.69	I want to suggest that actually,
762.897	globaloney can be very harmful to your health.
767.467	First of all, recognizing that the glass
770.619	is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing
775.075	that there might be potential for additional gains
778.459	from additional integration,
780.49	whereas if we thought we were already there,
783.334	there would be no particular point to pushing harder.
786.758	It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference
789.97	on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open
794.151	to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about
797.483	at this conference.
798.898	So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are
803.688	is critical to even being able to notice
806.747	that there might be room for something more,
810.426	something that would contribute further to global welfare.
814.394	Which brings me to my second point.
817.226	Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful
821.449	because it reduces and in some cases even reverses
826.244	some of the fears that people have about globalization.
831.049	"So I actually spend most of my ""World 3.0"" book"
834.434	working through a litany of market failures and fears
838.978	that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.
844.118	I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,
847.786	so let me just present to you two headlines
851.054	as an illustration of what I have in mind.
854.335	Think of France and the current debate about immigration.
858.651	When you ask people in France what percentage
861.883	of the French population is immigrants,
864.096	the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.
868.596	Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent
873.226	might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric
877.64	that we see around the immigration issue.
880.978	Or to take an even more striking example,
885.122	when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
887.299	did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess
890.646	what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,
894.873	the guess was 30 percent, which is
898.554	"slightly in excess of the actual level — (""actually about ... 1%"") (Laughter) —"
903.914	of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.
907.288	The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,
910.695	when it was pointed out to people how far
913.376	their estimates were from the actual data,
916.585	some of them — not all of them — seemed to become
919.68	more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.
923.667	So foreign aid is actually a great way
926.791	of sort of wrapping up here, because
929.985	if you think about it, what I've been talking about today
933.073	is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --
937.162	that most things are very home-biased.
940.144	"""Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"""
943.369	is about the most home-biased thing you can find.
947.092	If you look at the OECD countries and how much
950.13	they spend per domestic poor person,
953.272	and compare it with how much they spend
955.524	per poor person in poor countries,
959.696	the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —
963.968	turns out to be about 30,000 to one.
968.644	Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,
974.84	would like to see that ratio being brought down
978.009	to one-is-to-one.
980.241	I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim
983.632	for that to make substantial progress from where we are.
987.793	If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,
992.86	we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed
996.23	at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit
999.747	that ended last week made no further progress on.
1003.609	So in summary, while radical openness is great,
1007.414	given how closed we are,
1009.427	even incremental openness could make things
1012.401	dramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)
1016.032	(Applause)
