12.602	Approximately 30 years ago,
14.94	when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital
17.633	in Philadelphia,
19.022	a father and a son walked into my office
22.176	and they both had their right eye missing,
25.32	and as I took the history, it became apparent
28.131	that the father and the son had a rare form
30.9	of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,
34.442	and the father knew that he had passed that fate
37.556	on to his son.
39.431	That moment changed my life.
41.843	It propelled me to go on
43.747	and to co-lead a team that discovered
47.279	the first cancer susceptibility gene,
50.476	and in the intervening decades since then,
53.197	there has been literally a seismic shift
56.617	in our understanding of what goes on,
58.643	what genetic variations are sitting behind
61.531	various diseases.
63.09	In fact, for thousands of human traits,
66.474	a molecular basis that's known for that,
68.692	and for thousands of people, every day,
71.987	there's information that they gain
74.068	about the risk of going on to get this disease
76.51	or that disease.
78.736	At the same time, if you ask,
81.041	"""Has that impacted the efficiency,"
83.748	"how we've been able to develop drugs?"""
85.84	the answer is not really.
87.622	If you look at the cost of developing drugs,
89.952	how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.
93.341	And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose
97.814	yet not the power to fully treat.
100.626	And there are two commonly given reasons
103.092	for why that happens.
104.56	One of them is it's early days.
108.032	We're just learning the words, the fragments,
111.622	the letters in the genetic code.
113.398	We don't know how to read the sentences.
115.553	We don't know how to follow the narrative.
118.123	The other reason given is that
120.602	most of those changes are a loss of function,
122.82	and it's actually really hard to develop drugs
125.745	that restore function.
127.66	But today, I want us to step back
129.842	and ask a more fundamental question,
131.87	"and ask, ""What happens if we're thinking"
134.059	"about this maybe in the wrong context?"""
136.792	We do a lot of studying of those who are sick
139.951	and building up long lists
142.551	of altered components.
145.669	But maybe, if what we're trying to do
148.068	is to develop therapies for prevention,
151.29	maybe what we should be doing
152.843	is studying those who don't get sick.
155.225	Maybe we should be studying those
157.572	that are well.
159.747	A vast majority of those people
161.544	are not necessarily carrying a particular
163.88	genetic load or risk factor.
165.816	They're not going to help us.
167.8	There are going to be those individuals
169.399	who are carrying a potential future risk,
172.068	they're going to go on to get some symptom.
173.912	That's not what we're looking for.
175.7	What we're asking and looking for is,
177.548	are there a very few set of individuals
180.318	who are actually walking around
183.154	with the risk that normally would cause a disease,
187.173	but something in them, something hidden in them
190.136	is actually protective
191.97	and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?
195.145	If you're going to do a study
195.145	like that, you can imagine
197.198	you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.
200.03	We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,
203.322	and we realized that actually
205.057	one way to think of this is,
206.586	let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,
210.863	and let's make sure that we look at those
213.833	who were healthy as kids.
215.313	They might have had individuals in their families
217.715	who had had a childhood disease,
219.527	but not necessarily.
221.033	And let's go and then screen those
223.8	to find those who are carrying genes
225.793	for childhood diseases.
227.471	Now, some of you, I can see you
229.035	"putting your hands up going, ""Uh, a little odd."
232.33	What's your evidence
233.747	"that this could be feasible?"""
235.409	I want to give you two examples.
237.473	The first comes from San Francisco.
240.421	It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,
243.362	and you may know the story where
245.756	there were individuals who had very high levels
248.153	of the virus HIV.
249.421	They went on to get AIDS.
251.9	But there was a very small set of individuals
254.217	who also had very high levels of HIV.
257.185	They didn't get AIDS.
258.571	And astute clinicians tracked that down,
261.533	and what they found was
261.533	they were carrying mutations.
264.92	Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth
268.005	that were protective, that were protecting them
270.02	from going on to get AIDS.
271.661	You may also know that actually a line of therapy
274.826	has been coming along based on that fact.
277.946	Second example, more recent, is elegant work
281.17	done by Helen Hobbs,
282.573	"who said, ""I'm going to look at individuals"
285.235	who have very high lipid levels,
287.951	and I'm going to try to find those people
289.89	with high lipid levels
291.692	"who don't go on to get heart disease."""
293.86	And again, what she found was
296.298	some of those individuals had mutations
298.858	that were protective from birth that kept them,
301.577	even though they had high lipid levels,
303.022	and you can see this is an interesting way
306.393	of thinking about how you could develop
308.354	preventive therapies.
310.614	The project that we're working on
312.558	"is called ""The Resilience Project:"
315.02	"A Search for Unexpected Heroes,"""
316.42	because what we are interested in doing is saying,
318.91	can we find those rare individuals
321.558	who might have these hidden protective factors?
325.883	And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,
328.863	a sort of resilience decoder ring
330.789	that we're going to try to build.
332.421	We've realized that we should 
332.421	do this in a systematic way,
336.27	so we've said, let's take every single
338.897	childhood inherited disease.
340.14	Let's take them all, and let's
340.14	pull them back a little bit
342.704	by those that are known to have severe symptoms,
345.89	where the parents, the child,
347.81	those around them would know
348.86	that they'd gotten sick,
350.19	and let's go ahead and then frame them again
353.89	by those parts of the genes where we know
356.471	that there is a particular alteration
358.978	that is known to be highly penetrant
361.776	to cause that disease.
364.43	Where are we going to look?
365.658	Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.
368.146	But we began to think, maybe we should look
370.407	all over the world.
371.858	Maybe we should look not just here
373.511	but in remote places where their might be
375.471	a distinct genetic context,
378.501	there might be environmental factors
380.143	that protect people.
381.525	And let's look at a million individuals.
385.987	Now the reason why we think it's a good time
388.957	to do that now
390.029	is, in the last couple of years,
391.789	there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost
394.377	to do this type of analysis,
396.612	this type of data generation,
398.351	to where it actually costs less to do
400.959	the data generation and analysis
403.153	than it does to do the sample
403.153	processing and the collection.
406.337	The other reason is that in the last five years,
410.641	there have been awesome tools,
412.605	things about network biology, systems biology,
415.267	that have come up that allow us to think
417.228	that maybe we could decipher
419.168	those positive outliers.
421.649	And as we went around talking to researchers
423.821	and institutions
425.725	and telling them about our story,
427.294	something happened.
428.961	"They started saying, ""This is interesting."
431.19	I would be glad to join your effort.
434.537	"I would be willing to participate."""
436.464	"And they didn't say, ""Where's the MTA?"""
439.043	"They didn't say, ""Where is my authorship?"""
442.336	"They didn't say, ""Is this data going "
442.336	"to be mine? Am I going to own it?"""
446.947	"They basically said, ""Let's work on this"
449.226	in an open, crowd-sourced, team way
452.107	"to do this decoding."""
455.181	Six months ago, we locked down
457.696	the screening key for this decoder.
461.011	My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt
465.589	at the Icahn Mount Sinai
465.589	School of Medicine in New York,
468.895	and his team,
470.287	locked in that decoder key ring,
473.156	and we began looking for samples,
475.551	because what we realized is,
477.037	maybe we could just go and look
478.831	at some existing samples to
478.831	get some sense of feasibility.
481.917	Maybe we could take two, three 
481.917	percent of the project on,
484.494	and see if it was there.
485.911	And so we started asking people
487.909	such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
491.446	We asked Leif up in Finland.
493.691	We talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,
497.364	and Wang Jun at BGI,
499.131	and again, something remarkable happened.
501.319	"They said, ""Huh,"
503.128	not only do we have samples,
504.872	but often we've analyzed them,
507.068	and we would be glad to go into
508.555	our anonymized samples
509.958	and see if we could find those
512.02	"that you're looking for."""
513.183	And instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,
515.89	last month we passed one half million samples
519.042	that we've already analyzed.
520.947	So you must be going,
522.44	"""Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"""
528.065	And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.
530.648	We found dozens of these strong candidate
533.686	unexpected heroes.
535.415	So we think that the time is now
538.112	to launch the beta phase of this project
540.452	and actually start getting prospective individuals.
543.569	Basically all we need is information.
546.74	We need a swab of DNA
548.399	"and a willingness to say, ""What's inside me?"
551.804	"I'm willing to be re-contacted."""
555.067	Most of us spend our lives,
558.858	when it comes to health and disease,
560.812	acting as if we're voyeurs.
563.892	We delegate the responsibility
566.229	for the understanding of our disease,
568.272	for the treatment of our disease,
570.144	to anointed experts.
573.68	In order for us to get this project to work,
577.02	we need individuals to step up
579.17	in a different role and to be engaged,
583.062	to realize this dream,
585.987	this open crowd-sourced project,
589.122	to find those unexpected heroes,
592.802	to evolve from the current concepts
595.462	of resources and constraints,
597.796	to design those preventive therapies,
601.047	and to extend it beyond childhood diseases,
603.82	to go all the way up to ways
605.397	that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,
609.268	we're going to need us
611.53	to be looking inside ourselves and asking,
614.636	"""What are our roles?"
616.84	"What are our genes?"""
618.513	and looking within ourselves for information
621.298	we used to say we should go to the outside,
623.94	to experts,
625.148	and to be willing to share that with others.
629.2	Thank you very much.
632.758	(Applause)
