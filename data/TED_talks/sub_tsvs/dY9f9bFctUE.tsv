12.46	Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people
12.46	experience armed conflict.
18.7	In response, people are forced
18.7	to flee their country,
21.42	leaving over 15 million refugees.
25.34	Children, without a doubt,
26.7	are the most innocent
26.7	and vulnerable victims ...
30.46	but not just from
30.46	the obvious physical dangers,
33.1	but from the often unspoken effects
33.1	that wars have on their families.
38.1	The experiences of war
38.1	leave children at a real high risk
41.34	for the development
41.34	of emotional and behavioral problems.
45.78	Children, as we can only imagine,
47.66	will feel worried, threatened and at risk.
50.38	But there is good news.
52.22	The quality of care
52.22	that children receive in their families
55.98	can have a more significant
55.98	effect on their well-being
59.46	than from the actual experiences of war
59.46	that they have been exposed to.
64.26	So actually, children can be protected
67.02	by warm, secure parenting
67.02	during and after conflict.
73.74	In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student
77.1	in the University of Manchester
77.1	School of Psychological Sciences.
80.86	Like many of you here,
82.34	I watched the crisis in Syria
82.34	unfold in front of me on the TV.
86.38	My family is originally from Syria,
88.7	and very early on,
89.98	I lost several family members
89.98	in really horrifying ways.
93.58	I'd sit and I'd gather with my family
93.58	and watch the TV.
97.02	We've all seen those scenes:
98.46	bombs destroying buildings,
100.54	chaos, destruction
102.86	and people screaming and running.
105.26	It was always the people screaming
105.26	and running that really got me the most,
109.22	especially those
109.22	terrified-looking children.
113.22	I was a mother to two young,
113.22	typically inquisitive children.
116.94	They were five and six then,
118.54	at an age where they typically
118.54	asked lots and lots of questions,
121.62	and expected real, convincing answers.
124.94	So, I began to wonder
124.94	what it might be like
127.62	to parent my children
127.62	in a war zone and a refugee camp.
132.06	Would my children change?
134.5	Would my daughter's bright,
134.5	happy eyes lose their shine?
138.34	Would my son's really relaxed and carefree
138.34	nature become fearful and withdrawn?
144.62	How would I cope?
147.26	Would I change?
150.46	As psychologists and parent trainers,
152.7	we know that arming parents
152.7	with skills in caring for their children
156.62	can have a huge effect
156.62	on their well-being,
160.02	and we call this parent training.
162.5	The question I had was,
164.46	could parent training programs
164.46	be useful for families
168.22	while they were still in war zones
168.22	or refugee camps?
171.26	Could we reach them
171.26	with advice or training
173.86	that would help them
173.86	through these struggles?
177.66	So I approached my PhD supervisor,
180.42	Professor Rachel Calam,
181.94	with the idea of using my academic skills
181.94	to make some change in the real world.
186.58	I wasn't quite sure
186.58	what exactly I wanted to do.
189.86	She listened carefully and patiently,
191.74	and then to my joy she said,
193.34	"""If that's what you want to do,"
193.34	and it means so much to you,
196.22	then let's do it.
197.5	Let's find ways to see if parent programs
200.5	can be useful for families
200.5	"in these contexts."""
203.78	So for the past five years,
203.78	myself and my colleagues --
206.7	Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright --
209.3	have been working
209.3	on ways to support families
211.54	that have experienced
211.54	war and displacement.
215.38	Now, to know how to help families
215.38	that have been through conflict
218.82	support their children,
220.26	the first step must obviously be
220.26	to ask them what they're struggling with,
224.1	right?
225.34	I mean, it seems obvious.
226.74	But it's often those
226.74	that are the most vulnerable,
229.14	that we're trying to support,
230.58	that we actually don't ask.
231.94	How many times have we just assumed
231.94	we know exactly the right thing
235.14	that's going to help someone or something
235.14	without actually asking them first?
239.22	So I travelled to refugee camps
239.22	in Syria and in Turkey,
242.9	and I sat with families, and I listened.
246.06	I listened to their parenting challenges,
248.82	I listened to their parenting struggles
251.1	and I listened to their call for help.
253.34	And sometimes that was just paused,
255.38	as all I could do was hold hands with them
257.46	and just join them
257.46	in silent crying and prayer.
260.42	They told me about their struggles,
262.86	they told me about the rough,
262.86	harsh refugee camp conditions
266.66	that made it hard to focus
266.66	on anything but practical chores
269.899	like collecting clean water.
272.42	They told me how they watched
272.42	their children withdraw;
275.74	the sadness, depression, anger,
278.94	bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,
278.94	fear of loud noises,
282.14	fear of nightmares --
284.02	terrifying, terrifying nightmares.
286.78	These families had been through
286.78	what we had been watching on the TV.
291.06	The mothers --
292.3	almost half of them
292.3	were now widows of war,
294.5	or didn't even know
294.5	if their husbands were dead or alive --
297.3	described how they felt
297.3	they were coping so badly.
301.3	They watched their children change
301.3	and they had no idea how to help them.
305.38	They didn't know how to answer
305.38	their children's questions.
309.26	What I found incredibly astonishing
309.26	and so motivational
312.62	was that these families were
312.62	so motivated to support their children.
317.54	Despite all these challenges they faced,
319.98	they were trying to help their children.
322.26	They were making attempts
322.26	at seeking support from NGO workers,
325.9	from refugee camp teachers,
327.82	professional medics,
329.06	other parents.
330.86	One mother I met had only been
330.86	in a camp for four days,
334.1	and had already made two attempts
335.74	at seeking support
335.74	for her eight-year-old daughter
338.18	who was having terrifying nightmares.
341.82	But sadly, these attempts
341.82	are almost always useless.
345.5	Refugee camp doctors, when available,
347.58	are almost always too busy,
349.38	or don't have the knowledge or the time
349.38	for basic parenting supports.
354.18	Refugee camp teachers and other parents
354.18	are just like them --
357.94	part of a new refugee community
357.94	who's struggling with new needs.
362.82	So then we began to think.
365.58	How could we help these families?
369.06	The families were struggling with things
369.06	much bigger than they could cope with.
373.22	The Syrian crisis made it clear
374.94	how incredibly impossible it would be
374.94	to reach families on an individual level.
380.26	How else could we help them?
382.26	How would we reach families
382.26	at a population level
386.22	and low costs
388.94	in these terrifying, terrifying times?
392.7	After hours of speaking to NGO workers,
395.3	one suggested a fantastic innovative idea
397.78	of distributing parenting
397.78	information leaflets via bread wrappers --
402.82	bread wrappers that were being delivered
402.82	to families in a conflict zone in Syria
407.18	by humanitarian workers.
409.18	So that's what we did.
410.82	The bread wrappers haven't changed
410.82	at all in their appearance,
413.82	except for the addition
413.82	of two pieces of paper.
416.62	One was a parenting information leaflet
416.62	that had basic advice and information
421.54	that normalized to the parent
421.54	what they might be experiencing,
424.98	and what their child
424.98	might be experiencing.
427.02	And information on how they could
427.02	support themselves and their children,
430.86	such as information like spending
430.86	time talking to your child,
435.1	showing them more affection,
437.22	being more patient with your child,
439.3	talking to your children.
441.14	The other piece of paper
441.14	was a feedback questionnaire,
443.74	and of course, there was a pen.
445.98	So is this simply leaflet distribution,
449.5	or is this actually a possible means
449.5	of delivering psychological first aid
453.34	that provides warm,
453.34	secure, loving parenting?
456.42	We managed to distribute
456.42	3,000 of these in just one week.
461.98	What was incredible was
461.98	we had a 60 percent response rate.
	families responded.
469.9	I don't know how many
469.9	researchers we have here today,
472.42	but that kind of response
472.42	rate is fantastic.
474.78	To have that in Manchester
474.78	would be a huge achievement,
478.06	let alone in a conflict zone in Syria --
480.78	really highlighting how important
480.78	these kinds of messages were to families.
487.02	I remember how excited and eager we were
487.02	for the return of the questionnaires.
490.98	The families had left
490.98	hundreds of messages --
493.5	most incredibly positive and encouraging.
495.9	But my favorite has got to be,
497.66	"""Thank you for not forgetting"
497.66	"about us and our children."""
502.1	This really illustrates
502.1	the potential means
504.18	of the delivery of psychological
504.18	first aid to families,
506.98	and the return of feedback, too.
509.1	Just imagine replicating this
509.1	using other means
511.62	such as baby milk distribution,
511.62	or female hygiene kits,
516.22	or even food baskets.
519.841	But let's bring this closer to home,
521.58	because the refugee crisis
522.9	is one that is having an effect
522.9	on every single one of us.
526.34	We're bombarded with images daily
526.34	of statistics and of photos,
530.979	and that's not surprising,
532.58	because by last month,
533.859	over one million refugees
533.859	had reached Europe.
536.98	One million.
538.78	Refugees are joining our communities,
541.94	they're becoming our neighbors,
543.46	their children are attending
543.46	our children's schools.
547.1	So we've adapted the leaflet
547.1	to meet the needs of European refugees,
551.42	and we have them online, open-access,
553.78	in areas with a really high
553.78	refugee influx.
556.46	For example, the Swedish healthcare
556.46	uploaded it onto their website,
559.7	and within the first 45 minutes,
561.42	it was downloaded 343 times --
565.3	really highlighting how important it is
567.22	for volunteers, practitioners
567.22	and other parents
569.78	to have open-access,
569.78	psychological first-aid messages.
575.1	In 2013, I was sitting on the cold,
575.1	hard floor of a refugee camp tent
581.3	with mothers sitting around me
581.3	as I was conducting a focus group.
585.26	Across from me stood an elderly lady
587.58	with what seemed to be
587.58	a 13-year-old girl lying beside her,
591.06	with her head on the elderly lady's knees.
593.9	The girl stayed quiet
593.9	throughout the focus group,
596.7	not talking at all,
598.02	with her knees
598.02	curled up against her chest.
600.86	Towards the end of the focus group,
602.58	and as I was thanking
602.58	the mothers for their time,
605.58	the elderly lady looked at me
605.58	while pointing at the young girl,
608.58	"and said to me, ""Can you help us with...?"""
611.9	Not quite sure what she expected me to do,
614.3	I looked at the young girl and smiled,
616.18	and in Arabic I said,
617.58	"""Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?"""
619.62	"""What's your name?"""
621.54	She looked at me really
621.54	confused and unengaged,
624.3	"but then said, ""Halul."""
626.66	Halul is the pet's name
626.66	for the Arabic female name, Hala,
631.22	and is only really used
631.22	to refer to really young girls.
635.14	At that point I realized that actually
635.14	Hala was probably much older than 13.
639.62	It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old
639.62	mother to three young children.
644.74	Hala had been a confident,
644.74	bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother
648.74	to her children,
649.98	but the war had changed all of that.
652.82	She had lived through bombs
652.82	being dropped in her town;
657.22	she had lived through explosions.
660.26	When fighter jets
660.26	were flying around their building,
662.74	dropping bombs,
663.98	her children would be screaming,
663.98	terrified from the noise.
666.74	Hala would frantically grab pillows
666.74	and cover her children's ears
669.86	to block out the noise,
671.26	all the while screaming herself.
673.9	When they reached the refugee camp
675.62	and she knew they were finally
675.62	in some kind of safety,
678.86	she completely withdrew
678.86	to acting like her old childhood self.
682.9	She completely rejected her family --
686.3	her children, her husband.
689.02	Hala simply could no longer cope.
692.42	This is a parenting struggle
692.42	with a really tough ending,
695.34	but sadly, it's not uncommon.
697.18	Those who experience
697.18	armed conflict and displacement
700.18	will face serious emotional struggles.
703.54	And that's something we can all relate to.
706.74	If you have been through
706.74	a devastating time in your life,
710.42	if you have lost someone
710.42	or something you really care about,
715.22	how would you continue to cope?
718.5	Could you still be able
718.5	to care for yourself and for your family?
723.3	Given that the first years
723.3	of a child's life are crucial
726.46	for healthy physical
726.46	and emotional development,
729.74	and that 1.5 billion people
729.74	are experiencing armed conflict --
734.74	many of whom are now
734.74	joining our communities --
737.46	we cannot afford to turn a blind eye
739.38	to the needs of those
739.38	who are experiencing war and displacement.
744.62	We must prioritize
744.62	these families' needs --
747.1	both those who are internally displaced,
747.1	and those who are refugees worldwide.
752.9	These needs must be prioritized
752.9	by NGO workers, policy makers,
757.94	the WHO, the UNHCR
757.94	and every single one of us
762.26	in whatever capacity it is
762.26	that we function in our society.
767.42	When we begin to recognize
767.42	the individual faces of the conflict,
772.62	when we begin to notice
772.62	those intricate emotions on their faces,
777.14	we begin to see them as humans, too.
779.82	We begin to see
779.82	the needs of these families,
782.54	and these are the real human needs.
785.66	When these family needs are prioritized,
788.38	interventions for children
788.38	in humanitarian settings
791.7	will prioritize and recognize the primary
791.7	role of the family in supporting children.
797.66	Family mental health
797.66	will be shouting loud and clear
800.26	in global, international agenda.
802.9	And children will be less likely
802.9	to enter social service systems
806.62	in resettlement countries
808.22	because their families
808.22	would have had support earlier on.
812.34	And we will be more open-minded,
815.1	more welcoming, more caring
816.94	and more trusting to those
816.94	who are joining our communities.
821.62	We need to stop wars.
824.54	We need to build a world where children
824.54	can dream of planes dropping gifts,
829.22	and not bombs.
831.14	Until we stop armed conflicts
831.14	raging throughout the world,
835.22	families will continue to be displaced,
837.94	leaving children vulnerable.
839.9	But by improving parenting
839.9	and caregiver support,
842.98	it may be possible to weaken the links
842.98	between war and psychological difficulties
848.26	in children and their families.
850.66	Thank you.
851.9	(Applause)
