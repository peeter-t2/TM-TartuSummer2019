12.927	I want to talk to you about one thing
15.108	and just one thing only,
16.864	and this has to do with when people ask me,
20.62	what do you do?
23.867	To which I usually respond,
25.767	I do computer music.
28.907	Now, a number of people
30.852	just stop talking to me right then and there,
33.089	and the rest who are left usually have
35.502	this blank look in their eye,
37.75	as if to say, what does that mean?
39.919	And I feel like I'm actually depriving them
42.137	of information by telling them this,
45.342	at which point I usually panic
47.07	and spit out the first thing that comes to my mind,
48.66	which is, I have no idea what I'm doing.
52.442	Which is true.
54.054	That's usually followed by a second thought,
56.91	which is, whatever it is that I'm doing,
60.21	I love it.
61.902	And today, I want to, well,
65.699	share with you something I love,
67.87	and also why.
69.354	And I think we'll begin with just this question:
73.283	What is computer music?
74.62	And I'm going to try to do my
74.62	best to provide a definition,
78.4	maybe by telling you a story
80.131	that goes through some of the stuff
81.778	I've been working on.
83.704	And the first thing, I think, in our story
85.516	is going to be something called ChucK.
88.064	Now, ChucK is a programming language for music,
93.437	and it's open-source, it's freely available,
96.146	and I like to think that it crashes equally well
98.066	on all modern operating systems.
100.41	And instead of telling you more about it,
103.37	I'm just going to give you a demo.
105.196	By the way, I'm just going to nerd out
106.352	for just a few minutes here,
107.981	so I would say, don't freak out.
110.779	In fact, I would invite all of you to join me
112.85	in just geeking out.
114.034	If you've never written a line
114.034	of code before in your life,
117.096	do not worry.
118.282	I'll bet you'll be able to come along on this.
121.799	First thing I'm going to do is to make
123.218	a sine wave oscillator,
125.051	and we're going to called the sine wave generator
128.085	"""Ge."""
130.847	"And then we're going to connect ""Ge"" to the DAC."
132.937	Now this is kind of the abstraction
134.091	for the sound output on my computer. Okay?
136.699	So I've connected myself into the speaker.
139.899	Next, I'm going to say my frequency
141.491	is 440 hertz,
143.459	and I'm going to let time advance
147.278	by two seconds through this operation.
150	All right, so if I were to play this --
154.068	(Tone) —
156.74	you would hear a sine wave
156.74	at 440 hertz for two seconds.
159.161	Okay, great. Now I'm going to copy and paste this,
162.187	and then just change some of these numbers,
167.891	and .5 and 880.
170.331	By doubling the frequency,
171.693	we're actually going up in successive octaves,
174.21	and then we have this sequence --
175.547	(Tones) — of tones.
177.674	Okay, great, now I can imagine creating
179.58	all kinds of really horrible
181.022	single sine wave pieces of music with this,
183.42	but I'm going to do something
183.42	that computers are really good at,
186.332	which is repetition.
188.156	I'm going to put this all in a while loop,
189.86	and you actually don't need to indent,
191.156	but this is purely for aesthetic reasons.
193.28	It's good practice.
194.884	And when we do this —
196.464	(Tones) —
200.961	that's going to go on for a while.
202.134	In fact, it's probably not going to stop
203.628	until this computer disintegrates.
205.411	And I can't really empirically prove that to you,
208.11	but I hope you'll believe me when I say that.
211.779	Next, I'm going to replace this 220
213.655	by math.random2f.
216.461	I'm going to generate a random number
217.739	between 30 and 1,000 and send that
220.879	to the frequency of me.
222.965	And I'm going to do this every half a second.
225.065	(Tones)
228.007	Let's do this every 200 milliseconds.
230.668	(Tones)
235.29	One hundred.
236.745	(Tones)
238.357	All right.
239.591	At this point, we've reached something
241.535	that I would like to think of as
242.605	the canonical computer music.
246.626	This is, to me, the sound that mainframes
250.443	are supposed to be making
251.565	when they're thinking really hard.
254.807	It's this sound, it's like,
256.9	the square root of five million.
262.427	So is this computer music?
266.211	Yeah, I guess by definition,
268.19	it's kind of computer music.
269.395	It's probably not the kind of music you would listen to
272.403	cruising down the highway,
273.891	but it's a foundation of computer-generated music,
278.907	and using ChucK,
281.11	we've actually been building instruments
282.803	in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,
284.699	based right here at Stanford Center for
284.699	Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.
288.9	Now the Laptop Orchestra is an ensemble of laptops,
291.683	humans and special hemispherical speaker arrays.
294.312	Now the reason we have these
295.909	is so that for the instruments that we create
298.379	out of the laptop, we want the sound to come
300.603	out of somewhere near the instrument
303.123	and the performer,
304.491	kind of much like a traditional, acoustic instrument.
307.193	Like, if I were to play a violin here,
309.079	the sound would naturally not come out of
311.19	the P.A. system, but from the artifact itself.
313.964	So these speakers are meant to emulate that.
317.171	In fact, I'm going to show you
318.5	how we actually built them.
321.243	The first step is to go to IKEA
323.307	and buy a salad bowl.
324.687	This is an 11-inch Blanda Matt.
327.917	That's the actual name,
329.415	and I actually use one of these
330.837	to make salad at home as well, I kid you not.
333.065	And the first step is you turn it upside down,
336.236	and then you drill holes in them,
338.711	six holes per hemi,
341.22	and then make a base plate,
342.934	put car speaker drivers in them
345.614	along with amplifiers in the enclosure,
348.205	and you put that all together and you have
349.559	these hemispherical speaker arrays.
351.333	Add people, add laptops,
352.896	you have a laptop orchestra.
355.584	And what might a laptop orchestra sound like?
359.114	Well, let me give you a demonstration
361.033	of about 200 instruments we've created so far
364.268	for the Laptop Orchestra.
367.511	And what I'm going to do is
367.511	actually come over to this thing.
369.938	This thing I have in front of me
372.143	actually used to be a commodity gaming controller
375.355	called a Gametrak.
377.145	This thing actually has a glove
377.145	you can put on your hands.
379.021	It's tethered to the base,
380.581	and this will track the position of your hands
383.11	in real time.
384.163	It was originally designed as a golfing controller
387.537	to detect the motion of your swing.
389.453	That turned out to be a rather large
391.984	commercial non-success,
393.688	at which point they slashed prices to 10 dollars,
397.442	at which point computer music researchers
399.45	"said, ""This is awesome!"
401.508	"We can prototype instruments out of this."""
404.257	So let me show you one instrument we've created,
407.201	one of many, and this instrument
409.113	"is called ""Twilight,"""
410.682	and it's meant to go with this metaphor
413.368	of pulling a sound out of the ground.
416.401	So let me see if this will work.
419.752	(Music)
428.968	And put it back.
430.791	And then if you go to the left,
434.886	right,
441.427	it sounds like an elephant in pain.
445.231	This is a slightly metallic sound.
448.259	Turn it just a bit.
451.613	(Music)
457.211	It's like a hovering car.
464.406	Okay.
465.799	This third one is a ratchet-like interaction, so
471.36	let me turn it up.
476.915	(Music)
482.068	So it's a slightly different interaction.
483.948	The fourth one is a drone.
487.583	(Music)
500.613	And finally, let's see,
503.319	this is a totally different interaction,
505.13	and I think you have to imagine that there's
506.94	this giant invisible drum sitting right here on stage,
509.872	and I'm going to bang it.
514.255	(Drum)
516.902	(Laughter)
520.241	So there we go, so that's one of many instruments
522.685	in the Laptop Orchestra.
524.455	(Applause)
528.009	Thank you.
530.29	And when you put that together,
532.396	you get something that sounds like this.
536.464	(Music)
585.47	Okay, and so, I think from the experience
587.82	of building a lot of instruments
587.82	for the Laptop Orchestra,
590.343	and I think from the curiosity of wondering,
592.847	what if we took these
594.35	hopefully expressive instruments
595.942	and we brought it to a lot of people,
598.575	plus then a healthy bout of insanity —
600.982	put those three things together —
602.471	led to me actually co-founding a startup company
605.987	in 2008 called Smule.
608.446	Now Smule's mission is to create
610.366	expressive, mobile music things,
614.223	and one of the first musical instruments
618.985	we created is called Ocarina.
620.845	And I'm going to just demo this for you real quick.
627.234	So Ocarina —
629.65	(Music) —
633.248	is based on this ancient flute-like instrument
636.371	called the ocarina,
637.78	and this one is the four-hole
637.78	English pendant configuration,
641.163	and you're literally blowing into the microphone
644.566	to make the sound.
647.492	And there's actually a little ChucK script
649.125	running in here that's detecting
650.293	the strength of your blowing
651.775	and also synthesizing the sound.
653.893	(Music)
657.478	And vibrato is mapped to the accelerometer,
660.808	so you can get —
662.461	(Music)
665.79	All right. So let me play a little ditty for you,
671.533	a little Bach.
673.349	And here, you'll hear a little
673.349	accompaniment with the melody.
675.941	The accompaniment actually follows the melody,
678.509	not the other way around.
682.29	(Music)
695.132	And this was designed
696.789	to let you take your time
698.065	and figure out where your expressive space is,
701.27	and you can just hang out here
703.077	for a while, for a really
703.077	dramatic effect, if you want,
706.139	and whenever you're ready —
709.205	(Music)
724.981	And on these longer notes,
726.089	I'm going to use more vibrato
728.19	towards the end of the notes
729.082	to give it a little bit more of an expressive quality.
732.134	(Music)
739.473	Huh, that's a nice chord to end this excerpt on.
743.16	(Applause)
746.581	Thank you.
751.75	So I think a good question to ask about Ocarina is,
755.746	is this a toy or it an instrument? Maybe it's both,
760.493	but for me, I think the more important question is,
762.502	is it expressive?
764.043	And at the same time, I think
766.117	creating these types of instruments
767.421	asks a question about the role of technology,
770.783	and its place for how we make music.
772.477	Apparently, for example,
774.214	not that long ago, like only a hundred years ago —
776.12	that's not that long in the course of human history —
777.64	families back then
779.621	used to make music together
781.509	as a common form of entertainment.
784.557	I don't think that's really happening
785.802	that much anymore.
787.337	You know, this is before radio, before recording.
789.007	In the last hundred years, with all this technology,
791.214	we now have more access to music
793.388	as listeners and consumers,
795.021	but somehow, I think we're making less music
798.084	than ever before.
799.77	I'm not sure why that would be.
801.401	Maybe it's because it's too easy just to hit play.
804.05	And while listening to music is wonderful,
806.509	there's a special joy to making music
809.918	that's all its own.
811.573	And I think that's one part
812.836	of the goal of why I do what I do
814.926	is kind of to take us back to the past a little bit. Right?
819.682	Now, if that's one goal, the other goal
821.462	is to look to the future and think about
822.892	what kind of new musical things can we make
825.229	that we don't perhaps yet have names for
827.822	that's enabled by technology, but ultimately
830.685	might change the way that humans make music.
833.126	And I'll just give you one example here,
835.498	and this is Ocarina's other feature.
841.723	This is a globe,
843.91	and here you're actually listening
846.683	to other users of Ocarina
848.735	blow into their iPhones to play something.
852.715	"This is ""G.I.R."" from Texas,"
857.568	"""R.I.K."" I don't know why it's these"
857.568	three-letter names today, Los Angeles.
863.501	They're all playing pretty,
868.519	somewhat minimal music here.
871.879	(Music)
877.327	And the idea with this is that, well,
879.933	technology should not be foregrounded here,
883.85	and — (Laughter) —
885.933	we've actually opened this up.
888.646	The first thought is that, hey, you know
890.153	there's somebody somewhere out there
893.343	playing some music,
894.613	and this is a small but I think important
896.393	human connection to make
897.613	that perhaps the technology affords.
900.611	As a final example,
903.435	and perhaps my favorite example,
904.79	is that in the wake of the 2011 earthquake
907.941	and tsunami disaster in Japan,
910.427	a woman reached out in one of our singing apps
913.27	to try to get people to join in to sing with her
916.157	"on a version of ""Lean on Me."""
917.762	Now, in these apps, there's this thing that allows
920.81	any user to add their voice
922.511	to an existing performance by any other user
925.309	or group of users,
926.363	so in some sense, she's created this kind of
928.388	global ad hoc corral of strangers,
931.772	and within weeks, thousands of people
933.98	joined in on this,
935.612	and you can kind of see people
935.612	coming from all around the world
937.991	and all these lines converging on the origin
940.272	where the first rendition of the song was sung,
942.62	and that's in Tokyo.
944.254	And this is what it sounds like 
944.254	when there's 1,000 people.
947.686	This is 1,000 voices.

995.726	Is this computer music?
997.296	(Applause)
1002.728	Was that computer music?
1004.696	Yeah, I guess so; it's something that you really
1006.743	couldn't have done without computers.
1009.028	But at the same time, it's also just human,
1013.264	and I think what I've essentially answered so far
1016.353	is maybe why I do the stuff that I do,
1019.744	and let's just finally return to the first question:
1022.136	What is computer music?
1024.248	And I think that the catch here is that,
1026.552	at least to me, computer music
1027.808	isn't really about computers.
1029.656	It is about people.
1031.182	It's about how we can use technology
1032.816	to change the way we think
1034.862	and do and make music,
1036.306	and maybe even add to how we can
1039.992	connect with each other through music.
1042.502	And with that, I want to say,
1044.655	this is computer music, and thank you for listening.
1047.752	(Applause)
