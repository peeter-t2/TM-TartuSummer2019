12.342	For a long time in my life,
15.101	I felt like I'd been living two different lives.
19.692	There's the life that everyone sees,
23.097	and then there's the life that only I see.
26.804	And in the life that everyone sees,
29.324	who I am is a friend,
31.798	a son, a brother,
34.353	a stand-up comedian and a teenager.
37.979	That's the life everyone sees.
39.82	If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,
41.346	that's what they would tell you.
43.185	And that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.
45.183	And if you were to ask me to describe myself,
47.993	I'd probably say some of those same things.
50.915	And I wouldn't be lying,
54.476	but I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,
58.006	because the truth is,
59.533	that's just the life everyone else sees.
62.705	In the life that only I see, who I am,
66.468	who I really am,
68.395	is someone who struggles intensely with depression.
72.83	I have for the last six years of my life,
75.507	and I continue to every day.
80.626	Now, for someone who has never experienced depression
83.123	or doesn't really know what that means,
84.325	that might surprise them to hear,
85.708	because there's this pretty popular misconception
87.613	that depression is just being sad
90.36	when something in your life goes wrong,
92.848	when you break up with your girlfriend,
94.49	when you lose a loved one,
95.881	when you don't get the job you wanted.
97.632	But that's sadness. That's a natural thing.
99.619	That's a natural human emotion.
101.531	Real depression isn't being sad
105.729	when something in your life goes wrong.
108.358	Real depression is being sad
110.144	when everything in your life is going right.
113.413	That's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.
115.898	And to be totally honest,
118.023	that's hard for me to stand up here and say.
120.837	It's hard for me to talk about,
122.558	and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,
125.321	so much so that no one's talking about it.
127.689	And no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,
130.083	because right now it's a massive problem.
133.825	It's a massive problem.
135.495	But we don't see it on social media, right?
137.297	We don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.
139.385	We don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,
141.207	it's not fun, it's not light.
142.836	And so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.
146.431	But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:
150.19	every 30 seconds,
151.913	every 30 seconds, somewhere,
154.117	someone in the world takes their own life
156.31	because of depression,
157.387	and it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,
159.627	it might be two continents away, but it's happening,
161.157	and it's happening every single day.
163.727	And we have a tendency, as a society,
166.691	"to look at that and go, ""So what?"""
171.937	"So what? We look at that, and we go, ""That's your problem."
176.592	"That's their problem."""
178.995	We say we're sad and we say we're sorry,
180.847	"but we also say, ""So what?"""
182.224	Well, two years ago it was my problem,
186.907	because I sat on the edge of my bed
190.964	where I'd sat a million times before
194.324	and I was suicidal.
197.14	I was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,
201.066	you wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.
203.308	You'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,
205.424	the drama and theater student of the year,
207.485	the English student of the year,
208.444	someone who was consistently on the honor roll
210.272	and consistently at every party.
213.945	So you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say
215.586	I wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.
218.297	You would be wrong. So I sat there that night
219.736	beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand
223.774	and I thought about taking my own life
225.762	and I came this close to doing it.
229.114	I came this close to doing it.
230.796	And I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,
233.924	one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge
236.059	and look down but not jump,
238.32	one of the lucky ones who survives.
240.325	Well, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,
242.722	and my story is this:
245.127	In four simple words, I suffer from depression.
248.48	I suffer from depression,
250.91	and for a long time, I think,
258.23	I was living two totally different lives,
260.826	where one person was always afraid of the other.
262.687	I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,
264.786	that I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,
268.028	that beneath my smile, there was struggle,
270.453	and beneath my light, there was dark,
272.416	and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.
276.793	See, some people might fear girls not liking them back.
279.43	Some people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.
281.519	But for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.
286.212	I feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,
288.904	and that fear made me feel
291.126	like I was forced into a corner,
293.483	like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,
296.513	and so I thought about that way every single day.
300.306	I thought about it every single day,
301.753	and if I'm being totally honest, standing here
303.424	I've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,
306.797	that's the struggle, that's depression,
308.731	and depression isn't chicken pox.
309.95	You don't beat it once and it's gone forever.
311.668	It's something you live with. It's something you live in.
314.431	It's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.
318.003	It's the feelings you can't seem to escape,
320.264	the scariest part is that after a while,
325.337	you become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,
328.217	and what you really fear the most
330.504	isn't the suffering inside of you.
333.36	It's the stigma inside of others,
334.876	it's the shame, it's the embarrassment,
337.157	it's the disapproving look on a friend's face,
339.61	it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,
343.074	it's the comments that you're crazy.
344.475	That's what keeps you from getting help.
346.575	That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
349.569	It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,
351.904	and you hold it in and you hide it,
353.766	and even though it's keeping you in bed every day
355.442	and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,
358.382	you hide it, because the stigma in our society
360.545	around depression is very real.
363.46	It's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:
366.662	Would you rather make your next Facebook status
368.471	say you're having a tough time getting out of bed
370.217	because you hurt your back
372.366	or you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning
374.358	because you're depressed?
376.458	That's the stigma, because unfortunately,
378.742	we live in a world where if you break your arm,
381.21	everyone runs over to sign your cast,
383.899	but if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.
386.7	That's the stigma.
389.2	We are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down
394.166	other than our brains. And that's ignorance.
397.268	That's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created
399.28	a world that doesn't understand depression,
400.844	that doesn't understand mental health.
403.35	And that's ironic to me, because depression
405.303	is one of the best documented problems we have in the world,
407.813	yet it's one of the least discussed.
409.858	We just push it aside and put it in a corner
412.294	and pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.
415.881	Well, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,
419.223	because that's wishful thinking,
421.114	and wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,
423.887	and we can't procrastinate on something this important.
428.816	The first step in solving any problem
432.207	is recognizing there is one.
433.69	Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect
436.448	to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
439.633	And I don't know what the solution is.
443.412	I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think,
445.873	I think it has to start here.
447.881	It has to start with me, it has to start with you,
450.28	it has to start with the people who are suffering,
453.698	the ones who are hidden in the shadows.
455.115	We need to speak up and shatter the silence.
457.115	We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,
459.434	because if there's one thing that I've come to realize,
462.609	if there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,
466.185	it's not in building a world
469.224	where we eliminate the ignorance of others.
472.973	It's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,
476.259	where we're okay with who we are,
477.46	because when we get honest,
478.96	we see that we all struggle and we all suffer.
481.756	Whether it's with this, whether it's with something else,
483.708	we all know what it is to hurt.
486.535	We all know what it is to have pain in our heart,
488.373	and we all know how important it is to heal.
491.067	But right now, depression is society's deep cut
494.461	that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.
497.022	Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.
501.526	Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.
505.337	And know that you're sick, you're not weak,
507.999	and it's an issue, not an identity,
509.935	because when you get past the fear and the ridicule
512.688	and the judgment and the stigma of others,
514.485	you can see depression for what it really is,
517.471	and that's just a part of life,
519.71	just a part of life, and as much as I hate,
523.438	as much as I hate some of the places,
525.917	some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,
529.013	in a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.
531.548	Because yeah, it's put me in the valleys,
533.36	but only to show me there's peaks,
534.792	and yeah it's dragged me through the dark
536.391	but only to remind me there is light.
538.977	My pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,
542.72	has given me perspective, and my hurt,
544.979	my hurt has forced me to have hope,
547.474	have hope and to have faith, faith in myself,
550.005	faith in others, faith that it can get better,
552.55	that we can change this, that we can speak up
554.628	and speak out and fight back against ignorance,
557.386	fight back against intolerance,
559.975	and more than anything,
561.99	learn to love ourselves,
564.716	learn to accept ourselves for who we are,
566.895	the people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.
570.99	Because the world I believe in is one
572.602	where embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.
576.77	The world I believe in is one where we're measured
578.851	by our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.
583.367	The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye
587.591	"and say, ""I'm going through hell,"""
589.353	"and they can look back at me and go, ""Me too,"" and that's okay,"
592.93	and it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.
596.632	We're people, and we struggle and we suffer
599.062	and we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength
601.79	means never showing any weakness, then I'm here
603.909	to tell you you're wrong.
607.155	You're wrong, because it's the opposite.
611.052	We're people, and we have problems.
613.736	We're not perfect, and that's okay.
615.407	So we need to stop the ignorance,
617.621	stop the intolerance, stop the stigma,
620.699	and stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,
625.273	take a look at the truth, and start talking,
629.812	because the only way we're going to beat a problem
634.536	that people are battling alone
637.87	is by standing strong together,
641.633	by standing strong together.
645.397	And I believe that we can.
648.376	I believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.
650.295	This is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)
652.702	Thank you. (Applause)
