13.04	So a few years ago,
14.719	I did something really brave,
17.68	or some would say really stupid.
20.84	I ran for Congress.
23.04	For years, I had existed
23.04	safely behind the scenes in politics
26.8	as a fundraiser, as an organizer,
29.88	but in my heart, I always wanted to run.
33.68	The sitting congresswoman
33.68	had been in my district since 1992.
38.16	She had never lost a race,
40.08	and no one had really even run against her
40.08	in a Democratic primary.
44.68	But in my mind, this was my way
47.56	to make a difference,
49.08	to disrupt the status quo.
51.96	The polls, however,
51.96	told a very different story.
55.92	My pollsters told me
55.92	that I was crazy to run,
59.16	that there was no way that I could win.
62.76	But I ran anyway,
64.12	and in 2012, I became an upstart
64.12	in a New York City congressional race.
69.32	I swore I was going to win.
73	I had the endorsement
73	from the New York Daily News,
75.64	the Wall Street Journal
75.64	snapped pictures of me on election day,
79	and CNBC called it one of the hottest
79	races in the country.
83.28	I raised money from everyone I knew,
85.72	including Indian aunties
87.64	that were just so happy
87.64	an Indian girl was running.
91.24	But on election day, the polls were right,
94.44	and I only got 19 percent of the vote,
97.92	and the same papers
97.92	that said I was a rising political star
101.68	now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars
106.12	on 6,321 votes.
111.16	Don't do the math.
113.44	It was humiliating.
116.32	Now, before you get the wrong idea,
119	this is not a talk
119	about the importance of failure.
122.04	Nor is it about leaning in.
124.4	I tell you the story
124.4	of how I ran for Congress
127.64	because I was 33 years old
130.12	and it was the first time
130.12	in my entire life
134.88	that I had done something
134.88	that was truly brave,
138.56	where I didn't worry about being perfect.
141.639	And I'm not alone:
143.12	so many women I talk to tell me
144.88	that they gravitate
144.88	towards careers and professions
147.8	that they know
147.8	they're going to be great in,
149.92	that they know they're
149.92	going to be perfect in,
152.32	and it's no wonder why.
154.16	Most girls are taught
154.16	to avoid risk and failure.
157.24	We're taught to smile pretty,
159.04	play it safe, get all A's.
162.32	Boys, on the other hand,
164.04	are taught to play rough, swing high,
166.84	crawl to the top of the monkey bars
166.84	and then just jump off headfirst.
172.2	And by the time they're adults,
173.8	whether they're negotiating a raise
173.8	or even asking someone out on a date,
178.6	they're habituated
178.6	to take risk after risk.
182.52	They're rewarded for it.
184.32	It's often said in Silicon Valley,
186.88	no one even takes you seriously
186.88	unless you've had two failed start-ups.
191.88	In other words,
193.44	we're raising our girls to be perfect,
196.56	and we're raising our boys to be brave.
201.08	Some people worry
201.08	about our federal deficit,
205.8	but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.
210.24	Our economy, our society,
210.24	we're just losing out
213.72	because we're not raising
213.72	our girls to be brave.
216.92	The bravery deficit is why
216.92	women are underrepresented in STEM,
220.32	in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,
222.28	and pretty much everywhere you look.
226	In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck
229.2	looked at how bright fifth graders
229.2	handled an assignment
231.88	that was too difficult for them.
234	She found that bright girls
234	were quick to give up.
238.2	The higher the IQ,
238.2	the more likely they were to give up.
242.52	Bright boys, on the other hand,
244.28	found the difficult material
244.28	to be a challenge.
247	They found it energizing.
248.76	They were more likely
248.76	to redouble their efforts.
252.68	What's going on?
254.52	Well, at the fifth grade level,
256.04	girls routinely outperform boys
256.04	in every subject,
259.72	including math and science,
261.88	so it's not a question of ability.
265.56	The difference is in how boys
265.56	and girls approach a challenge.
270.2	And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.
272.8	An HP report found
272.8	that men will apply for a job
276	if they meet only 60 percent
276	of the qualifications,
280	but women, women will apply
282.76	only if they meet 100 percent
282.76	of the qualifications.
289.72	This study is usually invoked
289.72	as evidence that, well,
293.08	women need a little more confidence.
295.36	But I think it's evidence
296.88	that women have been socialized
296.88	to aspire to perfection,
300.04	and they're overly cautious.
301.6	(Applause)
304.44	And even when we're ambitious,
306.52	even when we're leaning in,
309.32	that socialization of perfection
311.56	has caused us to take
311.56	less risks in our careers.
315.32	And so those 600,000 jobs
315.32	that are open right now
319.92	in computing and tech,
321.8	women are being left behind,
323.72	and it means our economy
323.72	is being left behind
326.4	on all the innovation and problems
326.4	women would solve
330.6	if they were socialized to be brave
333.36	instead of socialized to be perfect.
336.96	(Applause)
340.92	So in 2012, I started a company
340.92	to teach girls to code,
345.28	and what I found
345.28	is that by teaching them to code
348.36	I had socialized them to be brave.
351.24	Coding, it's an endless process
351.24	of trial and error,
355.48	of trying to get the right command
355.48	in the right place,
358.68	with sometimes just a semicolon
361.12	making the difference
361.12	between success and failure.
364.84	Code breaks and then it falls apart,
367.36	and it often takes many, many tries
369.8	until that magical moment
372.12	when what you're trying
372.12	to build comes to life.
375.76	It requires perseverance.
378.6	It requires imperfection.
382.16	We immediately see in our program
384.56	our girls' fear of not getting it right,
386.92	of not being perfect.
388.84	Every Girls Who Code teacher
388.84	tells me the same story.
392.04	During the first week,
392.04	when the girls are learning how to code,
395.04	a student will call her over
395.04	and she'll say,
398.04	"""I don't know what code to write."""
400.08	The teacher will look at her screen,
402.04	and she'll see a blank text editor.
404.64	If she didn't know any better,
404.64	she'd think that her student
407.48	spent the past 20 minutes
407.48	just staring at the screen.
411.4	But if she presses undo a few times,
414.6	she'll see that her student
414.6	wrote code and then deleted it.
418.84	She tried, she came close,
422.12	but she didn't get it exactly right.
425.04	Instead of showing
425.04	the progress that she made,
427.68	she'd rather show nothing at all.
430.16	Perfection or bust.
434.44	It turns out that our girls
434.44	are really good at coding,
439.84	but it's not enough
439.84	just to teach them to code.
442.72	My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
442.72	at the University of Columbia
445.935	and teaches intro to Java
447.72	tells me about his office hours
447.72	with computer science students.
452.12	When the guys are struggling
452.12	with an assignment,
454.4	they'll come in and they'll say,
456	"""Professor, there's something"
456	"wrong with my code."""
458.88	The girls will come in and say,
460.4	"""Professor, there's something"
460.4	"wrong with me."""
465.52	We have to begin to undo
465.52	the socialization of perfection,
468.84	but we've got to combine it
468.84	with building a sisterhood
471.48	that lets girls know
471.48	that they are not alone.
475	Because trying harder
475	is not going to fix a broken system.
479.68	I can't tell you how many women tell me,
481.96	"""I'm afraid to raise my hand,"
483.76	I'm afraid to ask a question,
485.92	because I don't want to be the only one
488.32	who doesn't understand,
490.36	the only one who is struggling.
493.84	When we teach girls to be brave
496.76	and we have a supportive network
496.76	cheering them on,
500.08	they will build incredible things,
503.12	and I see this every day.
506.52	Take, for instance,
506.52	two of our high school students
509.16	who built a game called Tampon Run --
511.56	yes, Tampon Run --
514.04	to fight against the menstruation taboo
516.48	and sexism in gaming.
519.84	Or the Syrian refugee
521.44	who dared show her love
521.44	for her new country
525.6	by building an app
525.6	to help Americans get to the polls.
530.76	Or a 16-year-old girl
530.76	who built an algorithm
535.039	to help detect whether a cancer
535.039	is benign or malignant
540.12	in the off chance
540.12	that she can save her daddy's life
543.52	because he has cancer.
547	These are just
547	three examples of thousands,
552.12	thousands of girls who have been
552.12	socialized to be imperfect,
556.24	who have learned to keep trying,
556.24	who have learned perseverance.
559.217	And whether they become coders
561.24	or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyonc√©,
563.92	they will not defer their dreams.
567.96	And those dreams have never been
567.96	more important for our country.
573.32	For the American economy,
573.32	for any economy to grow,
576.48	to truly innovate,
578.64	we cannot leave behind
578.64	half our population.
582.64	We have to socialize our girls
582.64	to be comfortable with imperfection,
586.36	and we've got to do it now.
590.4	We cannot wait for them
590.4	to learn how to be brave like I did
594.64	when I was 33 years old.
597.24	We have to teach them
597.24	to be brave in schools
599.6	and early in their careers,
601.36	when it has the most potential
601.36	to impact their lives
604.52	and the lives of others,
606.56	and we have to show them
606.56	that they will be loved and accepted
611.36	not for being perfect
614.44	but for being courageous.
617.84	And so I need each of you
617.84	to tell every young woman you know --
621.68	your sister, your niece,
621.68	your employee, your colleague --
625.12	to be comfortable with imperfection,
628.36	because when we teach
628.36	girls to be imperfect,
630.88	and we help them leverage it,
633.48	we will build a movement
633.48	of young women who are brave
637.4	and who will build
637.4	a better world for themselves
640.8	and for each and every one of us.
645.16	Thank you.
646.4	(Applause)
651.08	Thank you.
657.32	Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.
659	It's such a powerful vision you have.
659	You have a vision.
663.68	Tell me how it's going.
665.44	How many girls
665.44	are involved now in your program?
667.72	Reshma Saujani: Yeah.
667.72	So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.
671.4	This year we'll teach 40,000
671.4	in all 50 states.
674.96	(Applause)
676.24	And that number is really powerful,
679.32	because last year we only graduated
679.32	7,500 women in computer science.
684.64	Like, the problem is so bad
687.24	that we can make
687.24	that type of change quickly.
690.6	CA: And you're working with some
690.6	of the companies in this room even,
693.84	who are welcoming
693.84	graduates from your program?
696.04	RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,
698.04	from Twitter to Facebook
700.12	to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
700.12	to Pixar to Disney,
704.64	I mean, every single company out there.
706.56	And if you're not signed up,
706.56	I'm going to find you,
709	because we need every single tech company
711	to embed a Girls Who Code
711	classroom in their office.
713.8	CA: And you have some stories
713.8	back from some of those companies
716.8	that when you mix in more gender balance
718.729	in the engineering teams,
718.729	good things happen.
722.2	RS: Great things happen.
723.52	I mean, I think that it's crazy to me
723.52	to think about the fact
726.96	that right now 85 percent of all
726.96	consumer purchases are made by women.
730.84	Women use social media at a rate
730.84	of 600 percent more than men.
733.92	We own the Internet,
735.36	and we should be building
735.36	the companies of tomorrow.
737.84	And I think when companies
737.84	have diverse teams,
740.04	and they have incredible women
740.04	that are part of their engineering teams,
743.48	they build awesome things,
743.48	and we see it every day.
745.92	CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there.
745.92	You're doing incredibly important work.
749.68	This whole community is cheering you on.
749.68	More power to you. Thank you.
753	RS: Thank you.
754.24	(Applause)
