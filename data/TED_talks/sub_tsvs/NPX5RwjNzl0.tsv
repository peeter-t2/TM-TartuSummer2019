12.93	These are simple objects:
14.385	clocks, keys, combs, glasses.
18.18	They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia
20.52	carried with them on their final journey.
23.517	We are all familiar with these mundane,
26.24	everyday objects.
27.974	The fact that some of the victims carried
29.559	personal items such as
29.559	toothpaste and a toothbrush
32.973	is a clear sign they had no idea
35.492	what was about to happen to them.
37.32	Usually, they were told that they were going to be
39.711	exchanged for prisoners of war.
42.199	These items have been recovered
44.212	from numerous mass graves across my homeland,
47.05	and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies
49.58	from newly discovered mass graves,
53.25	And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.
57.333	During the four years of conflict
59.611	that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,
62.457	approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,
65.888	went missing, presumed killed,
67.823	and another 100,000 were killed
69.803	during combat operations.
71.53	Most of them were killed
73.159	either in the early days of the war
74.932	or towards the end of the hostilities,
76.298	when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica
79.477	fell into the hands of the Serb army.
82.522	The international criminal tribunal
84.64	delivered a number of sentences
86.33	for crimes against humanity and genocide.
89.109	Genocide is a systematic and deliberate
92.618	destruction of a racial, political, religious
96.288	or ethnic group.
97.96	As much as genocide is about killing.
100.54	It is also about destroying their property,
103.561	their cultural heritage,
105.451	and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.
108.713	Genocide is not only about the killing;
111.21	it is about the denied identity.
114.383	There are always traces â€”
115.813	no such thing as a perfect crime.
117.532	There are always remnants of the perished ones
120.267	that are more durable than their fragile bodies
122.785	and our selective and fading memory of them.
126.523	These items are recovered
129.18	from numerous mass graves,
130.352	and the main goal of this collection of the items
133.766	is a unique process
135.234	of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,
138.512	the first act of genocide on European soil
141.482	since the Holocaust.
142.905	Not a single body should remain undiscovered
145.419	or unidentified.
147.285	Once recovered,
148.65	these items that the victims carried with them
151.573	on their way to execution
153.052	are carefully cleaned, analyzed,
155.409	catalogued and stored.
157.647	Thousands of artifacts are
157.647	packed in white plastic bags
160.797	just like the ones you see on CSI.
163.2	These objects are used as a forensic tool
165.938	in visual identification of the victims,
168.393	but they are also used as
168.393	very valuable forensic evidence
171.64	in the ongoing war crimes trials.
174.477	Survivors are occasionally called
176.568	to try to identify these items physically,
179.119	but physical browsing is extremely difficult,
182.449	an ineffective and painful process.
185.551	Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers
189.344	are done with these objects,
190.486	they become orphans of the narrative.
193.417	Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,
196.319	or they get simply shelved,
197.956	out of sight and out of mind.
200.198	I decided a few years ago
202.714	to photograph every single exhumed item
205.38	in order to create a visual archive
207.281	that survivors could easily browse.
210.631	As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.
214.688	I like to move beyond raising awareness.
217.431	And in this case, someone may
219.615	recognize these items
221.216	or at least their photographs will remain
223.912	as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder
227.714	of what happened.
229.626	Photography is about empathy,
231.764	and the familiarity of these
231.764	items guarantee empathy.
234.982	In this case, I am merely a tool,
237.436	a forensic, if you like,
239.09	and the result is a photography that is as close
241.755	as possible of being a document.
244.376	Once all the missing persons are identified,
247.515	only decaying bodies in their graves
249.288	and these everyday items will remain.
251.63	In all their simplicity,
253.555	these items are the last testament
255.762	to the identity of the victims,
257.319	the last permanent reminder
259.347	that these people ever existed.
261.319	Thank you very much.
263.657	(Applause)
