16.918	I was here four years ago,
18.442	and I remember, at the time,
20.26	that the talks weren't put online.
23.803	I think they were given
23.803	to TEDsters in a box,
27.26	a box set of DVDs,
29.135	which they put on their shelves,
29.135	where they are now.
31.651	(Laughter)
34.679	And actually, Chris called me
34.679	a week after I'd given my talk, and said,
38.261	"""We're going to start putting them online."
38.261	"Can we put yours online?"""
41.489	"And I said, ""Sure."""
43.393	And four years later,
45.996	it's been downloaded four million times.
51.13	So I suppose you could multiply that
51.13	by 20 or something
53.996	to get the number
53.996	of people who've seen it.
56.068	And, as Chris says, there is
56.068	a hunger for videos of me.
60.625	(Laughter)
63.293	(Applause)
69.336	Don't you feel?
70.362	(Laughter)
75.117	So, this whole event
75.117	has been an elaborate build-up
78.885	to me doing another one
78.885	for you, so here it is.
81.548	(Laughter)
84.561	Al Gore spoke at the TED conference
84.561	I spoke at four years ago
90.26	and talked about the climate crisis.
92.986	And I referenced that
92.986	at the end of my last talk.
96.668	So I want to pick up from there
98.26	because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.
100.334	(Laughter)
101.896	So, as I was saying --
103.26	(Laughter)
112.551	You see, he's right.
113.606	I mean, there is a major
113.606	climate crisis, obviously,
116.26	and I think if people don't believe it,
116.26	they should get out more.
119.38	(Laughter)
123.088	But I believe there is
123.088	a second climate crisis,
126.627	which is as severe,
128.826	which has the same origins,
131.26	and that we have to deal with
131.26	with the same urgency.
135.294	And you may say, by the way,
137.486	"""Look, I'm good."
139.194	I have one climate crisis,
139.194	"I don't really need the second one."""
142.684	(Laughter)
143.725	But this is a crisis of,
143.725	not natural resources --
146.122	though I believe that's true --
148.068	but a crisis of human resources.
150.903	I believe fundamentally,
152.26	as many speakers have said
152.26	during the past few days,
155.054	that we make very poor use of our talents.
160.164	Very many people go
160.164	through their whole lives
162.284	having no real sense
162.284	of what their talents may be,
165.26	or if they have any to speak of.
168.029	I meet all kinds of people
169.394	who don't think
169.394	they're really good at anything.
172.513	Actually, I kind of divide the world
172.513	into two groups now.
176.409	Jeremy Bentham, the great
176.409	utilitarian philosopher,
179.837	once spiked this argument.
181.26	"He said, ""There are two types"
181.26	of people in this world:
183.948	those who divide the world into two types
185.932	"and those who do not."""
187.132	(Laughter)
192.94	Well, I do.
194.013	(Laughter)
199.742	I meet all kinds of people
199.742	who don't enjoy what they do.
204.726	They simply go through their lives
204.726	getting on with it.
207.973	They get no great pleasure
207.973	from what they do.
210.426	They endure it rather than enjoy it,
213.923	and wait for the weekend.
216.32	But I also meet people
218.179	who love what they do
218.179	and couldn't imagine doing anything else.
222.26	"If you said, ""Don't do this anymore,"""
224.091	they'd wonder what you're talking about.
226.112	It isn't what they do, it's who they are.
228.212	"They say, ""But this is me, you know."
230.177	It would be foolish to abandon this,
232.106	because it speaks
232.106	"to my most authentic self."""
234.713	And it's not true of enough people.
237.847	In fact, on the contrary, I think
237.847	it's still true of a minority of people.
241.919	And I think there are many
241.919	possible explanations for it.
245.71	And high among them is education,
249.671	because education, in a way,
252.069	dislocates very many people
252.069	from their natural talents.
256.132	And human resources
256.132	are like natural resources;
259.029	they're often buried deep.
260.989	You have to go looking for them,
262.555	they're not just lying around
262.555	on the surface.
264.746	You have to create the circumstances
264.746	where they show themselves.
267.974	And you might imagine
267.974	education would be the way that happens,
271.498	but too often, it's not.
273.815	Every education system in the world
273.815	is being reformed at the moment
277.597	and it's not enough.
279.306	Reform is no use anymore,
282.028	because that's simply improving
282.028	a broken model.
285.393	What we need --
286.464	and the word's been used
286.464	many times in the past few days --
289.257	is not evolution,
291.035	but a revolution in education.
294.027	This has to be transformed
294.027	into something else.
297.26	(Applause)
303.26	One of the real challenges
303.26	is to innovate fundamentally in education.
309.366	Innovation is hard,
311.501	because it means doing something
311.501	that people don't find very easy,
314.721	for the most part.
316.107	It means challenging
316.107	what we take for granted,
318.539	things that we think are obvious.
321.155	The great problem for reform
321.155	or transformation
325.26	is the tyranny of common sense.
328.11	Things that people think,
329.478	"""It can't be done differently,"
329.478	"that's how it's done."""
332.031	I came across a great quote recently
332.031	from Abraham Lincoln,
334.872	who I thought you'd be pleased
334.872	to have quoted at this point.
337.737	(Laughter)
339.506	He said this in December 1862
339.506	to the second annual meeting of Congress.
346.458	I ought to explain that I have no idea
346.458	what was happening at the time.
351.212	We don't teach
351.212	American history in Britain.
353.989	(Laughter)
355.926	We suppress it.
355.926	You know, this is our policy.
358.26	(Laughter)
361.397	No doubt, something fascinating
361.397	was happening then,
363.992	which the Americans among us
363.992	will be aware of.
368.607	But he said this:
370.916	"""The dogmas of the quiet past"
370.916	are inadequate to the stormy present.
378.021	The occasion
378.021	is piled high with difficulty,
381.863	"and we must rise with the occasion."""
385.812	I love that.
386.867	Not rise to it, rise with it.
390.463	"""As our case is new,"
392.476	so we must think anew and act anew.
398.26	We must disenthrall ourselves,
401.26	"and then we shall save our country."""
404.26	"I love that word, ""disenthrall."""
406.971	You know what it means?
408.1	That there are ideas
408.1	that all of us are enthralled to,
411.26	which we simply take for granted
411.26	as the natural order of things,
414.317	the way things are.
415.713	And many of our ideas have been formed,
418.387	not to meet the circumstances
418.387	of this century,
420.649	but to cope with the circumstances
420.649	of previous centuries.
423.34	But our minds
423.34	are still hypnotized by them,
425.537	and we have to disenthrall ourselves
425.537	of some of them.
428.783	Now, doing this is easier said than done.
431.212	It's very hard to know, by the way,
431.212	what it is you take for granted.
434.949	And the reason
434.949	is that you take it for granted.
437.268	(Laughter)
438.294	Let me ask you something
438.294	you may take for granted.
440.652	How many of you here
440.652	are over the age of 25?
443.88	That's not what you take for granted,
443.88	I'm sure you're familiar with that.
447.95	Are there any people here
447.95	under the age of 25?
451.03	Great. Now, those over 25,
453.26	could you put your hands up
453.26	if you're wearing your wristwatch?
457.055	Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?
459.84	Ask a room full of teenagers
459.84	the same thing.
462.832	Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.
464.919	I don't mean they can't,
466.857	they just often choose not to.
468.705	And the reason is we were brought up
468.705	in a pre-digital culture,
472.325	those of us over 25.
473.56	And so for us,
473.56	if you want to know the time,
475.733	you have to wear something to tell it.
477.703	Kids now live in a world
477.703	which is digitized,
480.426	and the time, for them, is everywhere.
482.537	They see no reason to do this.
484.406	And by the way, you don't need either;
486.275	it's just that you've always done it
486.275	and you carry on doing it.
489.268	My daughter never wears a watch,
489.268	my daughter Kate, who's 20.
492.537	She doesn't see the point.
493.954	As she says,
495.765	"""It's a single-function device."""
497.66	(Laughter)
502.812	"""Like, how lame is that?"""
505.156	"And I say, ""No, no,"
505.156	"it tells the date as well."""
507.42	(Laughter)
512.26	"""It has multiple functions."""
513.887	(Laughter)
515.26	But, you see, there are things
515.26	we're enthralled to in education.
519.293	A couple of examples.
520.672	One of them is the idea of linearity:
523.419	that it starts here
523.419	and you go through a track
526.079	and if you do everything right,
527.626	you will end up set
527.626	for the rest of your life.
532.26	Everybody who's spoken at TED
532.26	has told us implicitly,
534.808	or sometimes explicitly,
534.808	a different story:
537.508	that life is not linear; it's organic.
540.738	We create our lives symbiotically
542.754	as we explore our talents
544.627	in relation to the circumstances
544.627	they help to create for us.
547.856	But, you know, we have become obsessed
547.856	with this linear narrative.
551.57	And probably the pinnacle for education
551.57	is getting you to college.
555.476	I think we are obsessed
555.476	with getting people to college.
558.682	Certain sorts of college.
559.985	I don't mean you shouldn't go,
559.985	but not everybody needs to go,
562.913	or go now.
564.13	Maybe they go later, not right away.
566.786	And I was up in San Francisco
566.786	a while ago doing a book signing.
569.938	There was this guy buying a book,
569.938	he was in his 30s.
572.761	"I said, ""What do you do?"""
574.055	"And he said, ""I'm a fireman."""
577.141	"I asked, ""How long"
577.141	"have you been a fireman?"""
579.26	"""Always. I've always been a fireman."""
582.21	"""Well, when did you decide?"""
582.21	"He said, ""As a kid."
584.591	Actually, it was
584.591	a problem for me at school,
586.711	because at school,
586.711	"everybody wanted to be a fireman."""
589.261	(Laughter)
590.299	"He said, ""But I wanted to be a fireman."""
593.012	"And he said, ""When I got"
593.012	to the senior year of school,
595.825	my teachers didn't take it seriously.
598.26	This one teacher didn't take it seriously.
600.536	He said I was throwing my life away
602.607	if that's all I chose to do with it;
604.647	that I should go to college, I should
604.647	become a professional person,
607.977	that I had great potential
609.26	"and I was wasting my talent to do that."""
611.414	"He said, ""It was humiliating."
612.852	It was in front of the whole class
612.852	and I felt dreadful.
615.462	But it's what I wanted,
615.462	and as soon as I left school,
617.993	I applied to the fire service
617.993	and I was accepted.
620.315	You know, I was thinking
620.315	about that guy recently,
622.625	just a few minutes ago when you
622.625	were speaking, about this teacher,
625.84	"because six months ago, I saved his life."""
629.093	(Laughter)
632.329	"He said, ""He was in a car wreck,"
632.329	and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,
636.712	"and I saved his wife's life as well."""
639.26	"He said, ""I think he thinks"
639.26	"better of me now."""
641.475	(Laughter)
643.26	(Applause)
649.792	You know, to me,
651.015	human communities depend
651.015	upon a diversity of talent,
655.26	not a singular conception of ability.
658.188	And at the heart of our challenges --
660.189	(Applause)
662.854	At the heart of the challenge
664.26	is to reconstitute our sense of ability
664.26	and of intelligence.
668.59	This linearity thing is a problem.
671.414	When I arrived in L.A.
671.414	about nine years ago,
674.26	I came across a policy statement --
678.413	very well-intentioned --
679.7	"which said, ""College"
679.7	"begins in kindergarten."""
684.124	No, it doesn't.
685.338	(Laughter)
689.831	It doesn't.
691.633	If we had time,
691.633	I could go into this, but we don't.
694.11	(Laughter)
696.348	Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.
698.848	(Laughter)
701.182	A friend of mine once said,
702.959	"""A three year-old"
702.959	"is not half a six year-old."""
705.42	(Laughter)
707.26	(Applause)
712.813	They're three.
713.949	But as we just heard in this last session,
715.973	there's such competition now
715.973	to get into kindergarten --
719.26	to get to the right kindergarten --
721.143	that people are being interviewed
721.143	for it at three.
727.099	Kids sitting in front
727.099	of unimpressed panels,
729.197	you know, with their resumes --
730.698	(Laughter)
733.313	Flicking through and saying,
733.313	"""What, this is it?"""
735.611	(Laughter)
737.26	(Applause)
740.603	"""You've been around"
740.603	"for 36 months, and this is it?"""
743.583	(Laughter)
750.66	"""You've achieved nothing -- commit."
752.438	(Laughter)
753.848	Spent the first six months
753.848	"breastfeeding, I can see."""
756.673	(Laughter)
761.792	See, it's outrageous as a conception.
764.403	The other big issue is conformity.
766.617	We have built our education systems
766.617	on the model of fast food.
770.875	This is something Jamie Oliver
770.875	talked about the other day.
773.772	There are two models
773.772	of quality assurance in catering.
776.343	One is fast food,
776.343	where everything is standardized.
779.007	The other is like Zagat
779.007	and Michelin restaurants,
781.346	where everything is not standardized,
783.133	they're customized to local circumstances.
785.182	And we have sold ourselves
785.182	into a fast-food model of education,
788.583	and it's impoverishing
788.583	our spirit and our energies
791.682	as much as fast food is depleting
791.682	our physical bodies.
795.069	(Applause)
801.149	We have to recognize
801.149	a couple of things here.
803.288	One is that human talent
803.288	is tremendously diverse.
805.66	People have very different aptitudes.
807.487	I worked out recently
807.487	that I was given a guitar as a kid
811.26	at about the same time
811.26	that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
814.26	(Laughter)
815.888	It worked out for Eric,
815.888	that's all I'm saying.
818.144	(Laughter)
819.19	In a way --
821.405	it did not for me.
822.696	I could not get this thing to work
825.261	no matter how often
825.261	or how hard I blew into it.
827.817	It just wouldn't work.
829.548	(Laughter)
833.158	But it's not only about that.
834.563	It's about passion.
836.411	Often, people are good at things
836.411	they don't really care for.
839.342	It's about passion,
840.56	and what excites
840.56	our spirit and our energy.
843.26	And if you're doing the thing
843.26	that you love to do, that you're good at,
846.665	time takes a different course entirely.
849.38	My wife's just finished writing a novel,
851.581	and I think it's a great book,
854.636	but she disappears for hours on end.
857.26	You know this, if you're doing
857.26	something you love,
859.665	an hour feels like five minutes.
862.203	If you're doing something
862.203	that doesn't resonate with your spirit,
865.275	five minutes feels like an hour.
866.89	And the reason so many people
866.89	are opting out of education
869.598	is because it doesn't feed their spirit,
871.939	it doesn't feed their energy
871.939	or their passion.
875.034	So I think we have to change metaphors.
877.563	We have to go from what is essentially
877.563	an industrial model of education,
881.118	a manufacturing model,
882.943	which is based on linearity
882.943	and conformity and batching people.
887.728	We have to move to a model
889.657	that is based more
889.657	on principles of agriculture.
892.26	We have to recognize
893.547	that human flourishing
893.547	is not a mechanical process;
897.498	it's an organic process.
899.451	And you cannot predict
899.451	the outcome of human development.
903.061	All you can do, like a farmer,
903.061	is create the conditions
905.778	under which they will begin to flourish.
908.539	So when we look at reforming
908.539	education and transforming it,
911.824	it isn't like cloning a system.
914.106	There are great ones,
914.106	like KIPP's; it's a great system.
916.702	There are many great models.
918.565	It's about customizing
918.565	to your circumstances
921.811	and personalizing education
921.811	to the people you're actually teaching.
925.888	And doing that, I think,
925.888	is the answer to the future
928.985	because it's not
928.985	about scaling a new solution;
932.424	it's about creating
932.424	a movement in education
934.765	in which people develop
934.765	their own solutions,
937.26	but with external support
937.26	based on a personalized curriculum.
940.569	Now in this room,
942.26	there are people who represent
942.26	extraordinary resources in business,
946.26	in multimedia, in the Internet.
948.576	These technologies,
950.26	combined with the extraordinary
950.26	talents of teachers,
953.05	provide an opportunity
953.05	to revolutionize education.
956.927	And I urge you to get involved in it
959.046	because it's vital, not just to ourselves,
959.046	but to the future of our children.
962.69	But we have to change
962.69	from the industrial model
965.117	to an agricultural model,
966.792	where each school can be
966.792	flourishing tomorrow.
969.84	That's where children experience life.
971.712	Or at home, if that's what they choose,
973.602	to be educated
973.602	with their families or friends.
975.839	There's been a lot of talk about dreams
975.839	over the course of these few days.
980.474	And I wanted to just very quickly --
982.524	I was very struck
982.524	by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,
985.453	recovering old poems.
987.468	I wanted to read you
987.468	a quick, very short poem
989.628	from W. B. Yeats,
989.628	who some of you may know.
992.26	He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,
996.153	and he was bewailing the fact
999.058	that he couldn't really give her
999.058	what he thought she wanted from him.
1002.332	"And he says, ""I've got something else,"
1002.332	"but it may not be for you."""
1005.752	He says this:
1007.768	"""Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,"
1010.664	Enwrought with gold and silver light,
1014.632	The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
1018.093	Of night and light and the half-light,
1022.162	I would spread the cloths under your feet:
1025.314	But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
1030.156	I have spread my dreams under your feet;
1034.009	Tread softly
1035.661	"because you tread on my dreams."""
1038.117	And every day, everywhere,
1040.925	our children spread
1040.925	their dreams beneath our feet.
1044.94	And we should tread softly.
1047.449	Thank you.
1048.546	(Applause)
1052.204	Thank you very much.
1053.607	(Applause)
1057.649	Thank you.
1058.688	(Applause)
