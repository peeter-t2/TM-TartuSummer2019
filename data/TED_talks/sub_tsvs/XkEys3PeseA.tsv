25	You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,
28	and here's yet another New York Times article,
30	just like every other darn one you've seen.
32	It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.
34	It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.
37	What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.
41	And the reason I'm saying this
43	is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
45	That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now
48	with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,
51	we may be on the road to a solution.
54	The fact is -- uh-uh.
57	We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.
62	We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.
64	And we've accomplished close to zip.
67	This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.
70	You've seen this in various forms,
72	but maybe you haven't seen this one.
74	What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
77	And that it's accelerating even faster
79	than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.
83	So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said
86	the environmentalists only put in the projections
88	to make the projections look as bad as possible,
91	that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.
94	But in fact, they're growing faster.
96	Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,
99	which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.
104	And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.
109	So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and
112	burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --
115	in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,
118	because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)
121	No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on
126	this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.
130	Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.
137	I don't want to depress you too much.
139	The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.
144	Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
149	Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.
153	No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.
155	So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,
159	dealing with electricity production,
161	which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.
165	And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,
168	and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,
172	which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
177	All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.
182	Instead, we spend our time talking.
184	But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.
187	What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.
191	And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do
195	if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.
198	And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions
201	that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important
205	because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --
208	and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.
211	Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.
214	But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.
218	But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.
221	I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.
224	They will completely lose.
226	And there's no adaption.
228	So this problem is absolutely soluble.
229	This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.
232	You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --
237	into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
239	where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.
241	And I know for certain that that will work.
244	Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.
247	And the reason is, it's been done.
249	And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.
252	Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur
255	in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.
259	The result of that was pretty dramatic.
262	After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see
265	a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.
267	So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
270	and it heats up after these volcanoes.
272	But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere
274	and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
278	There's no big mystery about it.
280	There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,
283	like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.
286	But it clearly cools down.
288	And one other thing: it's fast.
291	It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,
294	like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time
299	to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.
302	And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,
305	because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,
307	is the sum of emissions over time.
309	So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
311	But if you do this, it's quick.
313	And there are times you might like to do something quick.
316	Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?
319	Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,
323	and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?
326	And the answer seems to be yes.
328	So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.
331	That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,
334	with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.
336	The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,
340	and you're back to the original climate.
342	And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because
345	Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --
348	Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,
351	"""Geo-engineering won't work."""
353	And to the person who was promoting it said,
355	"""The atmosphere's much more complicated."""
357	Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.
360	Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did.
363	This topic is also old.
365	That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --
370	That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --
372	the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.
375	It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,
377	which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.
380	I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.
382	We should, but it made exactly this point.
385	So, in a sense, there's not much new.
387	The one new thing is this essay.
389	So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,
393	and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --
399	Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.
402	But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --
406	in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
412	It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
416	But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay
419	saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate
422	of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,
425	we should think about things like this.
427	He said roughly what's been said before.
429	The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.
432	And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,
434	even though there will be some ozone impacts.
436	And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.
438	There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,
440	"going right down to ""Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth,"" from the Economist."
444	And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,
447	but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.
450	And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --
454	and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round
457	in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere
461	and make them stay there.
463	One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.
465	The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,
467	and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.
469	And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.
471	It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.
474	But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published
477	that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.
480	So it seems there are already fine particles
482	that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,
486	that already have this effect.
488	I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.
490	There are a lot of fun complexities
492	that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.
494	But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.
497	So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.
499	Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side
502	bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.
506	And so you see a net force away from the sun.
508	That's called the photophoretic force.
510	There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators
514	have thought about how to exploit.
516	And of course, we may be wrong --
518	this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --
520	but so far, it seems good.
522	But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --
525	much longer than before -- because they're levitated.
528	We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,
530	in principle solving the ozone problem.
533	I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
535	Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,
538	so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.
542	Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,
545	where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,
549	which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.
553	This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,
555	a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.
557	Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,
561	I think it's almost certain we will
563	eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.
566	That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,
569	it's amazing how we can affect the planet.
572	The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.
576	This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,
579	give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,
582	to control the planet,
584	to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,
588	not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,
591	with better knowledge of the way the system works
593	and better engineering tools to effect it.
597	Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.
601	Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,
603	or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --
605	but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.
608	And the box has two knobs.
612	One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.
614	Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.
616	You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.
620	Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.
623	We have no global governance.
625	And different people will have different places they want it set.
627	Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.
631	But we're building that box.
635	The scientists and engineers of the world
637	are building it piece by piece, in their labs.
639	Even when they're doing it for other reasons.
641	Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.
644	They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.
646	They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.
650	And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --
653	but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
658	Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,
661	and it's better if we think hard about it,
664	even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.
668	I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning
674	of my thinking about how to think about it.
676	But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.
679	We need a broader debate.
681	A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,
685	who get engaged with this question about climate engineering
688	and think seriously about what its implications are.
691	So here's one way to think about it,
693	which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.
697	I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.
700	It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,
704	you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.
710	It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
713	It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)
715	I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.
719	And that calculation isn't much in dispute.
722	You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)
730	So because of this, we could deal with the problem
732	simply by stopping reducing emissions,
737	and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase
739	the amount of geo-engineering.
741	I don't think anybody takes that seriously.
744	Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away
746	from the current climate.
748	We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification
750	that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.
753	Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.
756	But here's a case which is harder to reject.
758	Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,
762	which is get serious about cutting emissions.
764	But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.
767	There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.
770	So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,
773	but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions
776	and eventually reduce concentrations.
778	And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --
783	we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked
786	and are rolling down the other side.
788	And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,
791	we've seen the worst of it.
794	But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet
798	is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on
804	the oceans in the next 100 years,
806	and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.
808	That's an absolutely possible scenario.
810	We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain
813	and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.
818	And that's a very different way to look at the problem.
820	It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.
823	It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while
826	to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.
831	But there is a problem with that view.
833	And the problem is the following:
835	knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes
837	the climate impacts look less fearsome,
840	and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.
843	This is what economists call a moral hazard.
845	And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,
849	and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason
851	that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.
852	But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.
856	I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.
859	Should we do serious research on this topic?
862	Should we have a national research program that looks at this?
865	Not just at how you would do it better,
867	but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.
869	Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,
873	some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in
876	because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.
879	A very small amount of money would get us some.
881	Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.
884	But I have a lot of reservations.
886	My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,
889	and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.
893	I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,
895	people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
899	Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.
902	A treaty that decides who gets to do this.
905	Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.
907	But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes
911	that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,
913	they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,
917	and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world
921	than a non-geo-engineered world.
924	And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
928	So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better
934	And I think it really summarizes where we are here.
937	That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,
940	is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies
942	that will reduce emissions --
944	but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate
949	and weather control, whether we like it or not.
952	And it's time to begin thinking about it,
954	even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments
957	for why we shouldn't do it.
959	Thank you very much.
