12.717	So I'm here to talk to you
12.717	about the walkable city.
15.63	What is the walkable city?
17.013	Well, for want of a better definition,
19.518	it's a city in which the car
19.518	is an optional instrument of freedom,
26.43	rather than a prosthetic device.
28.338	And I'd like to talk about
28.338	why we need the walkable city,
31.317	and I'd like to talk about
31.317	how to do the walkable city.
35.499	Most of the talks I give these days
35.499	are about why we need it,
39.863	but you guys are smart.
44.134	And also I gave that talk
44.134	exactly a month ago,
47.405	and you can see it at TED.com.
49.496	So today I want to talk
49.496	about how to do it.
52.52	In a lot of time thinking about this,
54.483	I've come up with what I call
54.483	the general theory of walkability.
57.607	A bit of a pretentious term,
57.607	it's a little tongue-in-cheek,
60.561	but it's something
60.561	I've thought about for a long time,
63.159	and I'd like to share
63.159	what I think I've figured out.
66.567	In the American city,
66.567	the typical American city --
69.43	the typical American city
69.43	is not Washington, DC,
71.694	or New York, or San Francisco;
74.026	it's Grand Rapids or Cedar
74.026	Rapids or Memphis --
77.297	in the typical American city
77.297	in which most people own cars
80.432	and the temptation
80.432	is to drive them all the time,
82.777	if you're going to get them to walk,
82.777	then you have to offer a walk
86.58	that's as good as a drive or better.
88.452	What does that mean?
89.627	It means you need to offer
89.627	four things simultaneously:
92.192	there needs to be a proper reason to walk,
94.273	the walk has to be safe and feel safe,
96.647	the walk has to be comfortable
98.366	and the walk has to be interesting.
100.159	You need to do all four
100.159	of these things simultaneously,
102.793	and that's the structure of my talk today,
104.847	to take you through each of those.
106.5	The reason to walk
106.5	is a story I learned from my mentors,
109.788	Andr√©s Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,
112.172	the founders of the New Urbanism movement.
114.197	And I should say half the slides
114.197	and half of my talk today
117.734	I learned from them.
119.084	It's the story of planning,
120.887	the story of the formation
120.887	of the planning profession.
124.151	When in the 19th century
124.151	people were choking
128.926	from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,
131.443	the planners said, hey, let's move
131.443	the housing away from the mills.
135.843	And lifespans increased
135.843	immediately, dramatically,
139.334	and we like to say
140.509	the planners have been trying to repeat
140.509	that experience ever since.
143.725	So there's the onset
143.725	of what we call Euclidean zoning,
146.391	the separation of the landscape
146.391	into large areas of single use.
150.49	And typically when I arrive
150.49	in a city to do a plan,
152.991	a plan like this already awaits me
152.991	on the property that I'm looking at.
157.054	And all a plan like this guarantees
158.78	is that you will not have a walkable city,
160.843	because nothing is located
160.843	near anything else.
163.787	The alternative, of course,
163.787	is our most walkable city,
167.451	and I like to say, you know,
167.451	this is a Rothko,
170.005	and this is a Seurat.
171.532	It's just a different way --
171.532	he was the pointilist --
174.097	it's a different way of making places.
175.954	And even this map of Manhattan
175.954	is a bit misleading
178.787	because the red color
178.787	is uses that are mixed vertically.
182.991	So this is the big story
182.991	of the New Urbanists --
185.719	to acknowledge
185.719	that there are only two ways
188.255	that have been tested by the thousands
190.569	to build communities,
190.569	in the world and throughout history.
193.533	One is the traditional neighborhood.
195.435	You see here several neighborhoods
195.435	of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
198.873	which is defined as being compact
198.873	and being diverse --
203.164	places to live, work, shop,
203.164	recreate, get educated --
207.33	all within walking distance.
209.233	And it's defined as being walkable.
211.393	There are lots of small streets.
212.951	Each one is comfortable to walk on.
214.701	And we contrast that to the other way,
217.239	an invention that happened
217.239	after the Second World War,
220.082	suburban sprawl,
221.364	clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
221.364	and it's not walkable,
225.965	because so few of the streets connect,
227.887	that those streets that do connect
227.887	become overburdened,
230.794	and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.
232.908	And I want to thank Alex Maclean,
232.908	the aerial photographer,
235.783	for many of these beautiful pictures
235.783	that I'm showing you today.
238.862	So it's fun to break sprawl down
238.862	into its constituent parts.
242.506	It's so easy to understand,
244.107	the places where you only live,
244.107	the places where you only work,
247.964	the places where you only shop,
249.944	and our super-sized public institutions.
253.312	Schools get bigger and bigger,
254.776	and therefore, further
254.776	and further from each other.
257.196	And the ratio of the size
257.196	of the parking lot
260.349	to the size of the school
261.589	tells you all you need to know,
263.229	which is that no child
263.229	has ever walked to this school,
265.791	no child will ever walk to this school.
267.72	The seniors and juniors are driving
267.72	the freshmen and the sophomores,
271.584	and of course we have
271.584	the crash statistics to prove it.
274.232	And then the super-sizing
274.232	of our other civic institutions
277.724	like playing fields --
278.918	it's wonderful that Westin
278.918	in the Ft. Lauderdale area
282.815	has eight soccer fields
282.815	and eight baseball diamonds
285.907	and 20 tennis courts,
287.79	but look at the road
287.79	that takes you to that location,
291.426	and would you let your child bike on it?
293.396	And this is why we have
293.396	the soccer mom now.
295.55	When I was young, I had one soccer field,
297.816	one baseball diamond and one tennis court,
299.865	but I could walk to it,
299.865	because it was in my neighborhood.
302.747	Then the final part of sprawl
302.747	that everyone forgot to count:
305.622	if you're going to separate everything
305.622	from everything else
308.466	and reconnect it
308.466	only with automotive infrastructure,
311.024	then this is what your landscape
311.024	begins to look like.
313.57	The main message here is:
314.809	if you want to have a walkable city,
314.809	you can't start with the sprawl model.
318.435	you need the bones of an urban model.
320.53	This is the outcome
320.53	of that form of design,
323.402	as is this.
324.817	And this is something
324.817	that a lot of Americans want.
327.43	But we have to understand
327.43	it's a two-part American dream.
330.167	If you're dreaming for this,
331.551	you're also going to be dreaming of this,
331.551	often to absurd extremes,
334.956	when we build our landscape
334.956	to accommodate cars first.
337.597	And the experience
337.597	of being in these places --
339.862	(Laughter)
340.903	This is not Photoshopped.
342.307	Walter Kulash took this slide.
344.333	It's in Panama City.
346.054	This is a real place.
347.867	And being a driver
347.867	can be a bit of a nuisance,
350.37	and being a pedestrian
350.37	can be a bit of a nuisance
352.859	in these places.
354.384	This is a slide that epidemiologists
354.384	have been showing for some time now,
357.882	(Laughter)
358.922	The fact that we have a society
358.922	where you drive to the parking lot
362.411	to take the escalator to the treadmill
364.309	shows that we're doing something wrong.
366.261	But we know how to do it better.
367.857	Here are the two models contrasted.
369.564	I show this slide,
370.743	which has been a formative document
370.743	of the New Urbanism now
373.553	for almost 30 years,
374.981	to show that sprawl and the traditional
374.981	neighborhood contain the same things.
379.164	It's just how big are they,
380.574	how close are they to each other,
382.197	how are they interspersed together
383.896	and do you have a street network,
383.896	rather than a cul-de-sac
386.837	or a collector system of streets?
388.896	So when we look at a downtown area,
390.737	at a place that has a hope
390.737	of being walkable,
392.896	and mostly that's our downtowns
392.896	in America's cities
395.478	and towns and villages,
397.27	we look at them and say
397.27	we want the proper balance of uses.
400.359	So what is missing or underrepresented?
402.518	And again, in the typical American cities
402.518	in which most Americans live,
406.202	it is housing that is lacking.
408.236	The jobs-to-housing balance is off.
410.45	And you find that when
410.45	you bring housing back,
412.657	these other things start to come back too,
414.747	and housing is usually first
414.747	among those things.
417.247	And, of course, the thing
417.247	that shows up last and eventually
420.375	is the schools,
421.58	because the people have to move in,
423.924	the young pioneers have to move in,
423.924	get older, have kids
428.769	and fight, and then the schools
428.769	get pretty good eventually.
431.831	The other part of this part,
434.157	the useful city part,
437.672	is transit,
439.001	and you can have a perfectly
439.001	walkable neighborhood without it.
442.39	But perfectly walkable cities
442.39	require transit,
445.719	because if you don't have access
445.719	to the whole city as a pedestrian,
449.184	then you get a car,
450.369	and if you get a car,
451.548	the city begins to reshape itself
451.548	around your needs,
454.12	and the streets get wider
454.12	and the parking lots get bigger
456.826	and you no longer have a walkable city.
458.727	So transit is essential.
459.906	But every transit experience,
459.906	every transit trip,
462.331	begins or ends as a walk,
464.25	and so we have to remember to build
464.25	walkability around our transit stations.
468.072	Next category, the biggest one,
468.072	is the safe walk.
470.841	It's what most walkability
470.841	experts talk about.
473.081	It is essential, but alone not enough
473.081	to get people to walk.
477.146	And there are so many moving parts
477.146	that add up to a walkable city.
480.313	The first is block size.
481.913	This is Portland, Oregon,
483.284	famously 200-foot blocks,
483.284	famously walkable.
486.874	This is Salt Lake City,
488.216	famously 600-foot blocks,
490.32	famously unwalkable.
491.713	If you look at the two,
491.713	it's almost like two different planets,
494.743	but these places were both built by humans
497.083	and in fact, the story is that when
497.083	you have a 200-foot block city,
500.747	you can have a two-lane city,
502.305	or a two-to-four lane city,
503.746	and a 600-foot block city
503.746	is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.
507.795	These are the crash statistics.
509.297	When you double the block size --
511.407	this was a study
511.407	of 24 California cities --
513.464	when you double the block size,
514.98	you almost quadruple
514.98	the number of fatal accidents
518.63	on non-highway streets.
520.655	So how many lanes do we have?
522.91	This is where I'm going to tell you
522.91	what I tell every audience I meet,
526.411	which is to remind you
526.411	about induced demand.
529.165	Induced demand applies
529.165	both to highways and to city streets.
533.626	And induced demand tells us
533.626	that when we widen the streets
537.135	to accept the congestion
537.135	that we're anticipating,
540.257	or the additional trips
540.257	that we're anticipating
542.618	in congested systems,
542.618	it is principally that congestion
546.555	that is constraining demand,
548.572	and so that the widening comes,
550.358	and there are all of these latent trips
550.358	that are ready to happen.
553.498	People move further from work
554.911	and make other choices
554.911	about when they commute,
557.168	and those lanes fill up
557.168	very quickly with traffic,
559.566	so we widen the street again,
559.566	and they fill up again.
562.091	And we've learned that
562.091	in congested systems,
564.341	we cannot satisfy the automobile.
566.78	This is from Newsweek Magazine --
566.78	hardly an esoteric publication:
570.254	"""Today's engineers acknowledge"
571.946	that building new roads
571.946	"usually makes traffic worse."""
575.196	My response to reading this was,
575.196	may I please meet some of these engineers,
578.783	because these are not the ones that I --
580.873	there are great exceptions
580.873	that I'm working with now --
583.487	but these are not the engineers
583.487	one typically meets working in a city,
586.817	"where they say, ""Oh, that road"
586.817	"is too crowded, we need to add a lane."""
590.307	So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,
592.491	"and they say, ""See, I told you"
592.491	"we needed that lane."""
594.972	This applies both to highways
594.972	and to city streets if they're congested.
598.788	But the amazing thing
598.788	about most American cities that I work in,
601.847	the more typical cities,
603.16	is that they have a lot of streets
603.16	that are actually oversized
606.216	for the congestion
606.216	they're currently experiencing.
608.647	This was the case in Oklahoma City,
610.394	when the mayor came running
610.394	to me, very upset,
612.937	because they were named
612.937	in Prevention Magazine
615.365	the worst city for pedestrians
615.365	in the entire country.
618.542	Now that can't possibly be true,
620.272	but it certainly is enough
620.272	to make a mayor do something about it.
623.425	We did a walkability study,
624.758	and what we found, looking
624.758	at the car counts on the street --
628.117	these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts
631.816	and we know that two lanes
631.816	can handle 10,000 cars per day.
635.787	Look at these numbers --
635.787	they're all near or under 10,000 cars,
640.468	and these were the streets
640.468	that were designated
643.066	in the new downtown plan
645.302	to be four lanes to six lanes wide.
647.96	So you had a fundamental disconnect
647.96	between the number of lanes
651.229	and the number of cars
651.229	that wanted to use them.
653.495	So it was my job to redesign
653.495	every street in the downtown
657.434	from curb face to curb face,
659.193	and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,
661.219	and we're rebuilding it now.
662.6	So a typical oversized street to nowhere
665.664	is being narrowed, and now
665.664	under construction,
667.888	and the project is half done.
669.552	The typical street like this, you know,
671.567	when you do that,
671.567	you find room for medians.
675.037	You find room for bike lanes.
677.043	We've doubled the amount
677.043	of on-street parking.
679.234	We've added a full bike network
679.234	where one didn't exist before.
683.207	But not everyone has the money
683.207	that Oklahoma City has,
686.478	because they have an extraction
686.478	economy that's doing quite well.
689.586	The typical city is more
689.586	like Cedar Rapids,
691.662	where they have an all four-lane
691.662	system, half one-way system.
695.676	And it's a little hard to see,
697.149	but what we've done -- what we're doing;
697.149	it's in process right now,
700.457	it's in engineering right now --
702.085	is turning an all four-lane
702.085	system, half one-way
705.9	into an all two-lane system, all two-way,
709.501	and in so doing, we're adding
712.766	which the merchants love,
714.149	and it protects the sidewalk.
715.593	That parking makes the sidewalk safe,
717.379	and we're adding a much more
717.379	robust bicycle network.
721.081	Then the lanes themselves.
721.081	How wide are they?
723.686	That's really important.
724.92	The standards have changed
724.92	such that, as Andr√©s Duany says,
728.11	the typical road
728.11	to a subdivision in America
730.228	allows you to see
730.228	the curvature of the Earth.
732.444	(Laughter)
733.507	This is a subdivision
733.507	outside of Washington from the 1960s.
736.776	Look very carefully
736.776	at the width of the streets.
739.121	This is a subdivision from the 1980s.
742.911	The standards have changed
742.911	to such a degree
744.959	that my old neighborhood of South Beach,
746.936	when it was time to fix the street
746.936	that wasn't draining properly,
750.119	they had to widen it
750.119	and take away half our sidewalk,
752.687	because the standards were wider.
754.45	People go faster on wider streets.
757.929	People know this.
759.11	The engineers deny it,
759.11	but the citizens know it,
762.26	so that in Birmingham, Michigan,
762.26	they fight for narrower streets.
766.11	Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,
768.656	"instituted its ""Skinny Streets"" program"
768.656	in its residential neighborhood.
772.225	We know that skinny streets are safer.
774.099	The developer Vince Graham,
774.099	in his project I'On,
777.169	which we worked on in South Carolina,
779.009	he goes to conferences and he shows
779.009	his amazing 22-foot roads.
782.948	These are two-way roads,
782.948	very narrow rights of way,
785.385	and he shows this well-known philosopher,
787.408	"who said, ""Broad is the road"
787.408	that leads to destruction ...
790.302	"narrow is the road that leads to life."""
792.427	(Laughter)
794.511	(Applause)
796.904	This plays very well in the South.
798.987	Now: bicycles.
801.749	Bicycles and bicycling
801.749	are the current revolution underway
806.255	in only some American cities.
807.962	But where you build it, they come.
809.627	As a planner, I hate to say that,
809.627	but the one thing I can say
813.66	is that bicycle population
813.66	is a function of bicycle infrastructure.
817.811	I asked my friend Tom Brennan
817.811	from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland
821.25	to send me some pictures
821.25	of the Portland bike commute.
823.854	He sent me this. I said,
823.854	"""Was that bike to work day?"""
826.386	"He said, ""No, that was Tuesday."""
828.055	When you do what Portland did and spend
828.055	money on bicycle infrastructure --
833.043	New York City has doubled the number
833.043	of bikers in it several times now
837.288	by painting these bright green lanes.
839.349	Even automotive cities
839.349	like Long Beach, California:
842.939	vast uptick in the number of bikers
842.939	based on the infrastructure.
847.042	And of course, what really does it,
848.757	if you know 15th Street
848.757	here in Washington, DC --
851.157	please meet Rahm Emanuel's
851.157	new bike lanes in Chicago,
854.158	the buffered lane, the parallel parking
854.158	pulled off the curb,
857.56	the bikes between the parked
857.56	cars and the curb --
861.586	these mint cyclists.
863.531	If, however, as in Pasadena,
863.531	every lane is a bike lane,
867.106	then no lane is a bike lane.
869.091	And this is the only bicyclist
869.091	that I met in Pasadena, so ...
872.227	(Laughter)
873.856	The parallel parking I mentioned --
875.571	it's an essential barrier of steel
877.217	that protects the curb and pedestrians
877.217	from moving vehicles.
881.027	This is Ft. Lauderdale;
881.027	one side of the street, you can park,
884.647	the other side of the street, you can't.
886.623	This is happy hour on the parking side.
888.672	This is sad hour on the other side.
891.387	And then the trees themselves
891.387	slow cars down.
894.4	They move slower when trees
894.4	are next to the road,
896.71	and, of course, sometimes
896.71	they slow down very quickly.
899.939	All the little details --
899.939	the curb return radius.
902.915	Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?
904.601	How swoopy is that curb to determine
904.601	how fast the car goes
908.071	and how much room you have to cross.
909.81	And then I love this,
909.81	because this is objective journalism.
913.256	"""Some say the entrance to CityCenter"
913.256	"is not inviting to pedestrians."""
917.359	When every aspect
917.359	of the landscape is swoopy,
919.841	is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,
922.538	"it says: ""This is a vehicular place."""
924.879	So no one detail, no one speciality,
924.879	can be allowed to set the stage.
929.978	And here, you know, this street:
931.566	yes, it will drain within a minute
931.566	of the hundred-year storm,
935.482	but this poor woman
935.482	has to mount the curb every day.
938.298	So then quickly, the comfortable walk
938.298	has to do with the fact
941.268	that all animals seek, simultaneously,
941.268	prospect and refuge.
946.245	We want to be able to see our predators,
948.369	but we also want to feel
948.369	that our flanks are covered.
950.912	And so we're drawn to places
950.912	that have good edges,
953.427	and if you don't supply the edges,
953.427	people won't want to be there.
956.779	What's the proper ratio
956.779	of height to width?
958.942	Is it one to one? Three to one?
960.741	If you get beyond one to six,
960.741	you're not very comfortable anymore.
964.55	You don't feel enclosed.
965.893	Now, six to one in Salzburg
965.893	can be perfectly delightful.
969.062	The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.
972.307	The point being the parking lot
972.307	is the principal problem here.
975.931	However, missing teeth, those empty lots
975.931	can be issues as well,
979.53	and if you have a missing corner
979.53	because of an outdated zoning code,
982.799	then you could have a missing nose
982.799	in your neighborhood.
985.731	That's what we had in my neighborhood.
987.592	This was the zoning code that said
987.592	I couldn't build on that site.
990.692	As you may know, Washington, DC
990.692	is now changing its zoning
994.443	to allow sites like this
994.443	to become sites like this.
997.597	We needed a lot of variances to do that.
999.787	Triangular houses
999.787	can be interesting to build,
1002.095	but if you get one built,
1002.095	people generally like it.
1004.821	So you've got to fill those missing noses.
1007.298	And then, finally, the interesting walk:
1009.28	signs of humanity.
1010.976	We are among the social primates.
1012.815	Nothing interests us more
1012.815	than other people.
1015.027	We want signs of people.
1016.545	So the perfect one-to-one ratio,
1016.545	it's a great thing.
1019.572	This is Grand Rapids,
1019.572	a very walkable city,
1021.8	but nobody walks on this street
1023.466	that connects the two
1023.466	best hotels together,
1025.601	because if on the left,
1025.601	you have an exposed parking deck,
1029.993	and on the right,
1029.993	you have a conference facility
1032.501	that was apparently designed
1032.501	in admiration for that parking deck,
1035.954	then you don't attract that many people.
1038.485	Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term,
1038.485	Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina,
1042.483	taught us it only takes
1044.684	to hide 250 feet of garage.
1047.002	This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.
1047.002	It's in South Beach.
1049.746	That active ground floor.
1051.214	I want to end with this project
1051.214	that I love to show.
1053.957	It's by Meleca Architects.
1053.957	It's in Columbus, Ohio.
1056.492	To the left is the convention center
1056.492	neighborhood, full of pedestrians.
1060.206	To the right is the Short North
1060.206	neighborhood -- ethnic,
1062.894	great restaurants,
1062.894	great shops, struggling.
1065.615	It wasn't doing very well
1065.615	because this was the bridge,
1068.193	and no one was walking
1068.193	from the convention center
1070.684	into that neighborhood.
1072.057	Well, when they rebuilt the highway,
1072.057	they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.
1076.374	Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge
1076.374	over the highway.
1078.872	The city paid 1.9 million dollars,
1081.269	they gave the site to a developer,
1083.539	the developer built this
1084.954	and now the Short North
1084.954	has come back to life.
1087.297	And everyone says, the newspapers,
1087.297	not the planning magazines,
1090.537	the newspapers say
1090.537	it's because of that bridge.
1092.782	So that's it. That's the general
1092.782	theory of walkability.
1095.426	Think about your own cities.
1097.47	Think about how you can apply it.
1099.911	You've got to do all four things at once.
1101.889	So find those places
1101.889	where you have most of them
1104.222	and fix what you can,
1106.151	fix what still needs fixing
1106.151	in those places.
1108.859	I really appreciate your attention,
1110.651	and thank you for coming today.
1113.351	(Applause)
