16.288	I love to collect things.
18.447	Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections
20.437	of random stuff, everything from bizarre hot sauces
23.166	from all around the world to insects
26.404	that I've captured and put in jars.
28.808	Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,
30.845	that I love the Natural History Museum
32.781	and the collections of animals
34.181	at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.
35.996	These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,
38.133	that you can go and look at,
39.55	and they memorialize a specific point of time
41.285	in this animal's life.
42.932	So I was thinking about my own life,
44.814	and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know,
46.727	for the ages, and also — (Laughter) —
49.51	the lives of my friends, but
51.997	the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen
54.613	on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter)
57.789	So instead, I turned to video,
60.492	and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize
62.79	someone and to capture a specific moment in time.
65.564	So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends
67.741	and then, using video mapping and video projection,
70.141	I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends
72.622	projected into jars. (Laughter)
76.564	So now I have this collection of my friends
78.278	I can take around with me whenever I go,
80.067	and this is called Animalia Chordata,
81.979	from the Latin nomenclature for
83.796	human being, classification system.
85.956	So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars,
88.918	and they actually move around. (Laughter)
93.277	So, this is interesting to me,
95.37	but it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter)
99.26	It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add
101.082	an interaction system. So what I did was,
102.694	I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close
104.477	to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.
106.636	You know, just like people on the street
108.363	when you get too close to them.
110.219	Some people reacted in terror. (Laughter)
112.805	Others reacted in asking you for help,
114.818	and some people hide from you.
118.316	So this was really interesting to me, this idea of
119.947	taking video off the screen and putting it in real life,
122.082	and also adding interactivity to sculpture.
124.329	So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends
128.394	and trapped them in jars as well
130.226	and created a piece known as Garden,
132.171	which is literally a garden of humanity.
134.523	But something about the first piece,
136.667	the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,
138.572	this idea of interaction with art,
140.393	and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,
142.715	and also being challenged by interacting with art.
145.004	So I wanted to create a new piece that actually
146.859	forced people to come and interact with something,
148.748	and the way I did this was actually by projecting
150.447	a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter)
154.827	This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is
157.322	it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.
159.185	You may never experience the entire thing yourself.
161.526	You can walk away, you can just watch as this character
163.85	stands there in the blender and looks at you,
166.275	or you can actually choose to interact with it.
168.349	So if you do choose to interact with the piece,
172.482	and you press the blender button, it actually sends
174.642	this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.
178.074	By doing that, you are now part of my piece.
181.626	You, like the people that are trapped in my work
183.658	— (Blender noises, laughter) —
187.719	have become part of my work as well. (Laughter)
194.826	(Laughter)
197.019	(Applause)
199.442	But, but this seems a bit unfair, right?
203.082	I put my friends in jars, I put this character,
205.594	this sort of endangered species character in a blender.
208.411	But I'd never done anything about myself.
210.411	I'd never really memorialized myself.
212.123	So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.
214.393	This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece
216.618	called A Point Just Passed,
218.865	in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,
221.497	and it's up to you.
223.201	If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,
225.147	you actually age me.
226.854	So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,
229.41	you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,
234.072	and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.
237.303	From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.
239.823	From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,
242.911	and then, from there, into an elderly man.
246.77	And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times
249.702	in one day, the piece goes black
252.773	and is not to be reset until the next day.
255.466	So, in doing so, you're erasing time.
257.55	You're actually implicit in this work
259.478	and you're erasing my life.
261.484	So I like this about interactive video sculpture,
263.63	that you can actually interact with it,
265.207	that all of you can actually touch an artwork
267.079	and be part of the artwork yourselves,
268.943	and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you
271.414	trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter)
273.574	Thank you. (Applause)
