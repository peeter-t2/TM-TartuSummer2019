25.515	I think I was supposed
25.515	to talk about my new book,
28	"which is called ""Blink,"""
29.903	and it's about snap judgments
29.903	and first impressions.
33	And it comes out in January,
33	and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
36.815	(Laughter)
38.313	But I was thinking about this,
40	and I realized that although
40	my new book makes me happy,
44.234	and I think would make my mother happy,
46.894	it's not really about happiness.
49.376	So I decided instead,
49.376	I would talk about someone
53	who I think has done as much
53	to make Americans happy
56.703	as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,
60	a man who is a great
60	personal hero of mine:
63	someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
66	who is most famous
66	for reinventing spaghetti sauce.
70.323	Howard's about this high, and he's round,
75	and he's in his 60s,
75	and he has big huge glasses
80.113	and thinning gray hair,
81.93	and he has a kind of wonderful
81.93	exuberance and vitality,
85.778	and he has a parrot,
85.778	and he loves the opera,
88.81	and he's a great aficionado
88.81	of medieval history.
93.203	And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
95.831	Now, I should tell you that I have no idea
95.831	what psychophysics is,
100.492	although at some point in my life,
102.206	I dated a girl for two years
103.676	who was getting
103.676	her doctorate in psychophysics.
105.94	Which should tell you something
105.94	about that relationship.
109.508	(Laughter)
111.829	As far as I know, psychophysics
111.829	is about measuring things.
115	And Howard is very interested
115	in measuring things.
117.655	And he graduated
117.655	with his doctorate from Harvard,
120.052	and he set up a little consulting shop
120.052	in White Plains, New York.
124.055	And one of his first clients was Pepsi.
126.437	This is many years ago,
126.437	back in the early 70s.
130.444	And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
132.38	"""You know, there's this new"
132.38	thing called aspartame,
134.802	and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.
136.71	We'd like you to figure out
138.711	how much aspartame we should put
138.711	in each can of Diet Pepsi
142.241	"in order to have the perfect drink."""
144.721	Now that sounds like an incredibly
144.721	straightforward question to answer,
149	and that's what Howard thought.
150.501	Because Pepsi told him,
151.826	"""We're working with a band"
151.826	between eight and 12 percent.
154.533	Anything below eight percent
154.533	sweetness is not sweet enough;
157.476	anything above 12 percent
157.476	sweetness is too sweet.
160.739	We want to know: what's the sweet
160.739	"spot between 8 and 12?"""
164.372	Now, if I gave you this problem to do,
164.372	you would all say, it's very simple.
168.357	What we do is you make up
168.357	a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
172	at every degree of sweetness --
172	eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
176.51	all the way up to 12 --
177.815	and we try this out
177.815	with thousands of people,
180.328	and we plot the results on a curve,
182.558	and we take the most popular
182.558	concentration, right?
185.563	Really simple.
186.842	Howard does the experiment,
186.842	and he gets the data back,
189.406	and he plots it on a curve,
190.771	and all of a sudden he realizes
190.771	it's not a nice bell curve.
193.659	In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
195.637	It's a mess. It's all over the place.
198	Now, most people in that business,
198	in the world of testing food and such,
202.637	are not dismayed
202.637	when the data comes back a mess.
205.478	"They think, ""Well, you know,"
206.994	figuring out what people think
206.994	"about cola's not that easy."""
209.852	"""You know, maybe we made an error"
209.852	"somewhere along the way."""
212.701	"""You know, let's just"
212.701	"make an educated guess,"""
214.922	and they simply point
214.922	and they go for 10 percent,
217.331	right in the middle.
219	Howard is not so easily placated.
221	Howard is a man of a certain degree
221	of intellectual standards.
223.936	And this was not good enough for him,
226	and this question bedeviled him for years.
228.306	And he would think it through
228.306	"and say, ""What was wrong?"
231	Why could we not make sense
231	"of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"""
235.36	And one day, he was sitting
235.36	in a diner in White Plains,
238	about to go trying to dream up
238	some work for Nescafé.
241.336	And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning,
241.336	the answer came to him.
245.153	And that is, that when they analyzed
245.153	the Diet Pepsi data,
247.851	they were asking the wrong question.
249.597	They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
251.751	and they should have been
251.751	looking for the perfect Pepsis.
255.814	Trust me.
256.849	This was an enormous revelation.
259	This was one of the most brilliant
259	breakthroughs in all of food science.
262.699	Howard immediately went on the road,
264.441	and he would go to conferences
264.441	around the country,
266.823	and he would stand up and say,
268.405	"""You had been looking"
268.405	for the perfect Pepsi.
270.492	You're wrong.
271.746	You should be looking
271.746	"for the perfect Pepsis."""
274.857	And people would look at him
274.857	blankly and say,
277.317	"""What are you talking about? Craziness."""
279.404	"And they would say, ""Move! Next!"""
281	Tried to get business,
281	nobody would hire him --
283.238	he was obsessed, though,
284.646	and he talked about it
284.646	and talked about it.
286.677	Howard loves the Yiddish expression
288.494	"""To a worm in horseradish,"
288.494	"the world is horseradish."""
291.541	This was his horseradish.
293.165	(Laughter)
294.851	He was obsessed with it!
297	And finally, he had a breakthrough.
299.835	Vlasic Pickles came to him,
302	"and they said, ""Doctor Moskowitz,"
302	"we want to make the perfect pickle."""
306.673	And he said,
307.721	"""There is no perfect pickle;"
307.721	"there are only perfect pickles."""
311.331	And he came back to them and he said,
313.125	"""You don't just need"
313.125	to improve your regular;
315.359	"you need to create zesty."""
316.876	And that's where we got zesty pickles.
319.516	Then the next person came to him:
319.516	Campbell's Soup.
322	And this was even more important.
324.024	In fact, Campbell's Soup
324.024	is where Howard made his reputation.
327.42	Campbell's made Prego,
328.837	and Prego, in the early 80s,
328.837	was struggling next to Ragù,
332.729	which was the dominant
332.729	spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.
336.546	In the industry -- I don't
336.546	know whether you care about this,
339.413	or how much time I have to go into this.
341.437	But it was, technically speaking
341.437	-- this is an aside --
344.091	Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.
346.175	The quality of the tomato paste
346.175	is much better;
348.48	the spice mix is far superior;
350.324	it adheres to the pasta
350.324	in a much more pleasing way.
352.834	In fact, they would do
352.834	the famous bowl test
354.935	back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.
357.604	You'd have a plate of spaghetti,
357.604	and you would pour it on, right?
361.46	And the Ragù would all go to the bottom,
361.46	and the Prego would sit on top.
366.129	"That's called ""adherence."""
367.684	And, anyway, despite the fact
367.684	that they were far superior in adherence,
372.248	and the quality of their tomato paste,
375.043	Prego was struggling.
376.436	So they came to Howard,
376.436	and they said, fix us.
379.811	And Howard looked
379.811	at their product line, and he said,
382.334	what you have is a dead tomato society.
386.183	So he said, this is what I want to do.
388.389	And he got together
388.389	with the Campbell's soup kitchen,
390.969	and he made 45 varieties
390.969	of spaghetti sauce.
394.454	And he varied them according
394.454	to every conceivable way
397.331	that you can vary tomato sauce:
399	by sweetness, by level of garlic,
400.882	by tomatoey-ness,
400.882	by tartness, by sourness,
404.121	by visible solids --
405.485	my favorite term
405.485	in the spaghetti sauce business.
408.77	(Laughter)
409.795	Every conceivable way
409.795	you can vary spaghetti sauce,
413.357	he varied spaghetti sauce.
415.16	And then he took this whole raft
415.16	of 45 spaghetti sauces,
418.917	and he went on the road.
420.098	He went to New York, to Chicago,
422.001	he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.
423.954	And he brought in people
423.954	by the truckload into big halls.
427.74	And he sat them down for two hours,
429.489	and over the course of that two hours,
429.489	he gave them ten bowls.
432.84	Ten small bowls of pasta,
434.122	with a different spaghetti
434.122	sauce on each one.
437.185	And after they ate each bowl,
437.185	they had to rate, from 0 to 100,
441.355	how good they thought
441.355	the spaghetti sauce was.
444.49	At the end of that process,
444.49	after doing it for months and months,
447.585	he had a mountain of data
449.152	about how the American people
449.152	feel about spaghetti sauce.
453	And then he analyzed the data.
454.491	Did he look for the most popular
454.491	variety of spaghetti sauce?
458.492	No! Howard doesn't believe
458.492	that there is such a thing.
461.27	Instead, he looked
461.27	at the data, and he said,
463.357	let's see if we can group all these
463.357	different data points into clusters.
469	Let's see if they congregate
469	around certain ideas.
472	And sure enough, if you sit down,
474.229	and you analyze all this data
474.229	on spaghetti sauce,
477.818	you realize that all Americans
477.818	fall into one of three groups.
481.34	There are people
481.34	who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
484.277	there are people
484.277	who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;
487	and there are people
487	who like it extra chunky.
489.929	And of those three facts,
489.929	the third one was the most significant,
494	because at the time, in the early 1980s,
496.678	if you went to a supermarket,
498.202	you would not find
498.202	extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
501.987	And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
504.024	"""You're telling me"
504.024	that one third of Americans
506.745	crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce
510	"and yet no one is servicing their needs?"""
512.523	"And he said ""Yes!"""
513.571	(Laughter)
514.887	And Prego then went back,
516.253	and completely reformulated
516.253	their spaghetti sauce,
518.649	and came out with a line of extra chunky
518.649	that immediately and completely
522.327	took over the spaghetti sauce
522.327	business in this country.
525.335	And over the next 10 years,
525.335	they made 600 million dollars
529.762	off their line of extra-chunky sauces.
533	Everyone else in the industry looked
533	at what Howard had done, and they said,
536.514	"""Oh my god! We've been"
536.514	"thinking all wrong!"""
538.945	And that's when you started to get
538.945	seven different kinds of vinegar,
542.239	and 14 different kinds of mustard,
542.239	and 71 different kinds of olive oil.
547.729	And then eventually
547.729	even Ragù hired Howard,
551	and Howard did the exact same thing
551	for Ragù that he did for Prego.
554.215	And today, if you go
554.215	to a really good supermarket,
556.59	do you know how many Ragùs there are?
560.967	In six varieties:
562.561	Cheese, Light,
565.635	Robusto, Rich &amp; Hearty,
568.761	Old World Traditional --
572.483	Extra-Chunky Garden.
574.224	(Laughter)
576	That's Howard's doing.
577.768	That is Howard's gift
577.768	to the American people.
580	Now why is that important?
581.705	(Laughter)
584	It is, in fact, enormously important.
586.105	I'll explain to you why.
587.499	What Howard did is he fundamentally
587.499	changed the way the food industry thinks
591.644	about making you happy.
594	Assumption number one
594	in the food industry used to be
597	that the way to find out
597	what people want to eat,
599.724	what will make people happy,
599.724	is to ask them.
602.628	And for years and years and years,
604.31	Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,
606.572	and they would sit you down,
606.572	and they would say,
609.056	"""What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?"
610.953	Tell us what you want
610.953	"in a spaghetti sauce."""
613.052	And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --
616	through all those focus group sessions,
618	no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
621.754	Even though at least a third of them,
621.754	deep in their hearts, actually did.
625.229	(Laughter)
627.696	People don't know what they want!
629.732	As Howard loves to say,
631.202	"""The mind knows not"
631.202	"what the tongue wants."""
633.978	It's a mystery!
635.154	(Laughter)
636.182	And a critically important step
638.612	in understanding
638.612	our own desires and tastes
641.967	is to realize that we cannot always
641.967	explain what we want, deep down.
646.242	If I asked all of you, for example,
646.242	in this room, what you want in a coffee,
650.302	you know what you'd say?
651.654	Every one of you would say,
651.654	"""I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."""
656.555	It's what people always say
656.555	when you ask them.
658.737	"""What do you like?"""
658.737	"""Dark, rich, hearty roast!"""
661.293	What percentage of you actually
661.293	like a dark, rich, hearty roast?
664.83	According to Howard, somewhere
664.83	between 25 and 27 percent of you.
668.567	Most of you like milky, weak coffee.
670.786	(Laughter)
671.811	But you will never, ever say
671.811	to someone who asks you what you want
675.167	"that ""I want a milky, weak coffee."""
677.382	So that's number one thing
677.382	that Howard did.
681.528	Number two thing that Howard did
681.528	is he made us realize --
685	it's another very critical point --
687	he made us realize the importance
689.198	of what he likes to call
689.198	"""horizontal segmentation."""
693	Why is this critical?
694.039	Because this is the way the food industry
694.039	thought before Howard.
697.761	What were they obsessed with
697.761	in the early 80s?
700.095	They were obsessed with mustard.
701.659	In particular, they were obsessed
701.659	with the story of Grey Poupon.
705	Used to be, there were two mustards:
705	French's and Gulden's.
708.225	What were they? Yellow mustard.
709.742	What's in it?
710.781	Yellow mustard seeds,
710.781	turmeric, and paprika.
712.859	That was mustard.
713.957	Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.
716.506	Right?
717.718	Much more volatile brown mustard seed,
717.718	some white wine, a nose hit,
723.405	much more delicate aromatics.
725.367	And what do they do?
726.406	They put it in a little tiny glass jar,
726.406	with a wonderful enameled label on it,
731.229	made it look French,
732.327	even though it's made
732.327	in Oxnard, California.
734.452	(Laughter)
735.477	And instead of charging a dollar fifty
735.477	for the eight-ounce bottle,
740	the way that French's and Gulden's did,
741.997	they decided to charge four dollars.
743.748	And they had those ads.
744.984	With the guy in the Rolls Royce,
744.984	eating the Grey Poupon.
747.643	Another pulls up, and says,
747.643	"""Do you have any Grey Poupon?"""
750.453	And the whole thing, after they did that,
750.453	Grey Poupon takes off!
753.661	Takes over the mustard business!
755.209	And everyone's take-home lesson from that
757.241	was that the way to make people happy
762	is to give them something
762	that is more expensive,
765.418	something to aspire to.
767.509	It's to make them turn their back
767.509	on what they think they like now,
771.676	and reach out for something
771.676	higher up the mustard hierarchy.
775.119	(Laughter)
776.144	A better mustard!
776.144	A more expensive mustard!
778.38	A mustard of more sophistication
778.38	and culture and meaning.
781.567	And Howard looked to that
781.567	"and said, ""That's wrong!"""
784.639	Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.
787.218	Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce,
787.218	on a horizontal plane.
791.779	There is no good mustard or bad mustard.
794.542	There is no perfect mustard
794.542	or imperfect mustard.
797.092	There are only different kinds of mustards
797.092	that suit different kinds of people.
801.358	He fundamentally democratized
801.358	the way we think about taste.
806.217	And for that, as well, we owe
806.217	Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.
811.201	Third thing that Howard did,
811.201	and perhaps the most important,
814.718	is Howard confronted the notion
814.718	of the Platonic dish.
817.581	(Laughter)
818.606	What do I mean by that?
819.772	(Laughter)
821.352	For the longest time in the food industry,
823.476	there was a sense that there was one way,
826.08	a perfect way, to make a dish.
829.57	You go to Chez Panisse,
831.309	they give you the red-tail sashimi
831.309	with roasted pumpkin seeds
836.616	in a something something reduction.
838.493	They don't give you five options
838.493	on the reduction.
841	"They don't say, ""Do you want"
841	"the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"""
844.618	No!
845.65	You just get the reduction. Why?
847.221	Because the chef at Chez Panisse
848.807	has a Platonic notion
848.807	about red-tail sashimi.
851.419	"""This is the way it ought to be."""
853.92	And she serves it that way
853.92	time and time again,
858	and if you quarrel with her, she will say,
860.286	"""You know what? You're wrong!"
862.468	This is the best way it ought to be
862.468	"in this restaurant."""
865.212	Now that same idea fueled
865.212	the commercial food industry as well.
869.294	They had a Platonic notion
869.294	of what tomato sauce was.
872.535	And where did that come from?
872.535	It came from Italy.
875	Italian tomato sauce is what?
877.375	It's blended; it's thin.
879.531	The culture of tomato sauce was thin.
881.864	"When we talked about ""authentic"
881.864	"tomato sauce"" in the 1970s,"
884.865	we talked about Italian tomato sauce,
886.698	we talked about the earliest Ragùs,
888.501	which had no visible solids, right?
891	Which were thin, you just put a little bit
893.141	and it sunk down to the bottom
893.141	of the pasta.
895.213	That's what it was.
896.429	And why were we attached to that?
898.114	Because we thought
898.114	that what it took to make people happy
900.876	was to provide them with the most
900.876	culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
905.494	And B, we thought that if we gave them
905.494	the culturally authentic tomato sauce,
910.602	then they would embrace it.
912.054	And that's what would please
912.054	the maximum number of people.
915.288	In other words,
917.598	people in the cooking world
917.598	were looking for cooking universals.
921.336	They were looking for one way
921.336	to treat all of us.
923.798	And it's good reason for them
923.798	to be obsessed
926.402	with the idea of universals,
927.808	because all of science,
929.229	through the 19th century
929.229	and much of the 20th,
931.502	was obsessed with universals.
933.195	Psychologists, medical scientists,
933.195	economists
937.207	were all interested
937.207	in finding out the rules
939.319	that govern the way all of us behave.
942.259	But that changed, right?
943.681	What is the great revolution
943.681	in science of the last 10, 15 years?
947.316	It is the movement
947.316	from the search for universals
950.855	to the understanding of variability.
953.339	Now in medical science,
953.339	we don't want to know, necessarily,
957	just how cancer works,
958.725	we want to know how your cancer
958.725	is different from my cancer.
962	I guess my cancer different
962	from your cancer.
964.771	Genetics has opened the door
964.771	to the study of human variability.
968.883	What Howard Moskowitz
968.883	was doing was saying,
971.002	"""This same revolution needs to happen"
971.002	"in the world of tomato sauce."""
976	And for that, we owe him
976	a great vote of thanks.
980.201	I'll give you one last
980.201	illustration of variability,
983.067	and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.
984.932	Howard not only believed that,
984.932	but he took it a second step,
988.444	which was to say that when we pursue
988.444	universal principles in food,
993.62	we aren't just making an error;
995.264	we are actually doing ourselves
995.264	a massive disservice.
999	And the example he used was coffee.
1001.223	And coffee is something he did
1001.223	a lot of work with, with Nescafé.
1005.746	If I were to ask all of you to try
1005.746	and come up with a brand of coffee --
1009.268	a type of coffee, a brew --
1009.268	that made all of you happy,
1012.314	and then I asked you to rate that coffee,
1014.291	the average score in this room for coffee
1014.291	would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.
1018.825	If, however, you allowed me
1018.825	to break you into coffee clusters,
1022.472	maybe three or four coffee clusters,
1024.281	and I could make coffee just
1024.281	for each of those individual clusters,
1029	your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
1033	The difference between coffee
1033	at 60 and coffee at 78
1038.261	is a difference between coffee
1038.261	that makes you wince,
1041	and coffee that makes you
1041	deliriously happy.
1044.69	That is the final, and I think
1044.69	most beautiful lesson,
1047.908	of Howard Moskowitz:
1049.267	that in embracing the diversity
1049.267	of human beings,
1053	we will find a surer way
1053	to true happiness.
1055.769	Thank you.
1056.81	(Applause)
