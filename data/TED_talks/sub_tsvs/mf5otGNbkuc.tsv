13.525	I want to start with a game. Okay?
16.175	And to win this game,
18.594	all you have to do is see
18.594	the reality that's in front of you
21.507	as it really is, all right?
23.523	So we have two panels here,
23.523	of colored dots.
27.006	And one of those dots
27.006	is the same in the two panels.
33.53	And you have to tell me which one.
35.602	Now, I narrowed it down
37.074	to the gray one, the green one,
37.074	and, say, the orange one.
41.769	So by a show of hands,
41.769	we'll start with the easiest one.
44.856	Show of hands: how many people
44.856	think it's the gray one?
48.594	Really? Okay.
50.16	How many people think it's the green one?
54.737	And how many people
54.737	think it's the orange one?
59.035	Pretty even split.
62.483	Let's find out what the reality is.
64.774	Here is the orange one.
67.873	(Laughter)
70.16	Here is the green one.
73.372	And here is the gray one.
76.872	(Laughter)
80.16	So for all of you who saw that,
80.16	you're complete realists.
83.428	All right?
84.625	(Laughter)
86.16	So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?
87.955	Because nearly every living system
89.781	has evolved the ability
89.781	to detect light in one way or another.
93.713	So for us, seeing color
95.578	is one of the simplest things
95.578	the brain does.
97.912	And yet, even at this
97.912	most fundamental level,
100.737	context is everything.
103.38	What I'm going to talk about
103.38	is not that context is everything,
106.585	but why context is everything.
108.634	Because it's answering that question
110.874	that tells us not only
110.874	why we see what we do,
114.442	but who we are as individuals,
116.16	and who we are as a society.
119.649	But first, we have to ask
119.649	another question,
121.736	"which is, ""What is color for?"""
123.268	And instead of telling you,
123.268	I'll just show you.
125.507	What you see here is a jungle scene,
128.16	and you see the surfaces
128.16	according to the amount of light
130.968	that those surfaces reflect.
132.657	Now, can any of you see the predator
132.657	that's about to jump out at you?
137.064	And if you haven't seen it yet,
137.064	you're dead, right?
140.112	(Laughter)
141.137	Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?
143.499	Now let's see the surfaces
144.992	according to the quality of light
144.992	that they reflect.
147.87	And now you see it.
150.489	So, color enables us to see
152.778	the similarities and differences
152.778	between surfaces,
155.228	according to the full spectrum
155.228	of light that they reflect.
158.298	But what you've just done
159.783	is in many respects
159.783	mathematically impossible.
162.847	Why?
164.118	Because, as Berkeley tells us,
165.572	we have no direct access
165.572	to our physical world,
168.159	other than through our senses.
170.16	And the light that falls onto our eyes
171.999	is determined by multiple
171.999	things in the world,
174.285	not only the color of objects,
176.16	but also the color of their illumination,
178.16	and the color of the space
178.16	between us and those objects.
180.993	You vary any one of those parameters,
183.27	and you'll change the color
183.27	of the light that falls onto your eye.
188.308	This is a huge problem,
189.516	because it means that the same image
192.509	could have an infinite number
192.509	of possible real-world sources.
196.054	Let me show you what I mean.
197.419	Imagine that this
197.419	is the back of your eye, okay?
200.276	And these are two projections
200.276	from the world.
202.8	They're identical in every single way.
205.287	Identical in shape,
205.287	size, spectral content.
209.343	They are the same,
209.343	as far as your eye is concerned.
213.158	And yet they come
213.158	from completely different sources.
218.38	The one on the right
218.38	comes from a yellow surface,
222.905	in shadow, oriented facing the left,
225.334	viewed through a pinkish medium.
228.23	The one on the left comes
228.23	from an orange surface,
231.498	under direct light, facing to the right,
233.705	viewed through sort of a bluish medium.
235.713	Completely different meanings,
237.912	giving rise to the exact same
237.912	retinal information.
241.213	And yet it's only the retinal
241.213	information that we get.
245.24	So how on Earth do we even see?
248.546	So if you remember anything
248.546	in this next 18 minutes,
251.777	remember this:
253.047	that the light that falls onto your eye,
255.013	sensory information, is meaningless,
257.46	because it could mean literally anything.
260.158	And what's true for sensory information
260.158	is true for information generally.
263.727	There's no inherent
263.727	meaning in information.
265.784	It's what we do with that
265.784	information that matters.
268.895	So, how do we see?
268.895	Well, we see by learning to see.
272.642	The brain evolved the mechanisms
272.642	for finding patterns,
276.205	finding relationships in information,
278.269	and associating those relationships
278.269	with a behavioral meaning,
282.491	a significance, by interacting
282.491	with the world.
285.38	We're very aware of this
287.159	in the form of more cognitive
287.159	attributes, like language.
290.012	I'm going to give you some letter strings,
292.069	and I want you to read them
292.069	out for me, if you can.
294.586	"Audience: ""Can you read this?"""
297.092	"""You are not reading this."""
299.59	"""What are you reading?"""
301.06	"Beau Lotto: ""What are you reading?"""
301.06	Half the letters are missing, right?
304.468	There's no a priori reason
305.801	"why an ""H"" has to go"
305.801	"between that ""W"" and ""A."""
308.317	But you put one there. Why?
309.896	Because in the statistics
309.896	of your past experience,
312.276	it would have been useful to do so.
313.994	So you do so again.
315.459	And yet you don't put a letter
315.459	"after that first ""T."""
318.16	Why? Because it wouldn't have been
318.16	useful in the past.
321.048	So you don't do it again.
323.16	So, let me show you how quickly
323.16	our brains can redefine normality,
327.053	even at the simplest thing
327.053	the brain does, which is color.
329.807	So if I could have
329.807	the lights down up here.
332.465	I want you to first notice that those
332.465	two desert scenes are physically the same.
336.288	One is simply the flipping of the other.
340.244	Now I want you to look at that dot
342.578	between the green and the red.
345.159	And I want you to stare at that dot.
345.159	Don't look anywhere else.
348.16	We're going to look
348.16	at it for about 30 seconds,
350.39	which is a bit of a killer
350.39	in an 18-minute talk.
352.856	(Laughter)
354.173	But I really want you to learn.
355.791	And I'll tell you -- don't look
355.791	anywhere else --
358.116	I'll tell you what's
358.116	happening in your head.
360.195	Your brain is learning,
361.486	and it's learning
361.486	that the right side of its visual field
364.238	is under red illumination;
365.555	the left side of its visual field
365.555	is under green illumination.
368.506	That's what it's learning. Okay?
371.416	Now, when I tell you, I want you to look
371.416	at the dot between the two desert scenes.
376.119	So why don't you do that now?
378.158	(Laughter)
381.542	Can I have the lights up again?
383.469	I take it from your response
383.469	they don't look the same anymore, right?
386.959	(Applause)
388.16	Why? Because your brain
388.16	is seeing that same information
391.16	as if the right one is still
391.16	under red light,
393.871	and the left one is still
393.871	under green light.
396.053	That's your new normal.
397.442	Okay? So, what does this mean for context?
399.472	It means I can take two identical squares,
401.83	put them in light and dark surrounds,
403.674	and the one on the dark surround
403.674	looks lighter than on the light surround.
407.183	What's significant is not simply the light
407.183	and dark surrounds that matter.
410.791	It's what those light and dark surrounds
410.791	meant for your behavior in the past.
414.46	So I'll show you what I mean.
415.881	Here we have that exact same illusion.
417.888	We have two identical tiles on the left,
420.038	one in a dark surround,
420.038	one in a light surround.
422.348	And the same thing over on the right.
424.451	Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,
427.326	but I'm not going to change
427.326	anything within those boxes,
430.018	except their meaning.
431.193	And see what happens to your perception.
433.53	Notice that on the left
435.16	the two tiles look nearly
435.16	completely opposite:
437.949	one very white and one very dark, right?
441.064	Whereas on the right,
441.064	the two tiles look nearly the same.
444.363	And yet there is still one
444.363	on a dark surround,
446.625	and one on a light surround.
448.014	Why?
449.189	Because if the tile in that shadow
449.189	were in fact in shadow,
453.16	and reflecting the same
453.16	amount of light to your eye
455.613	as the one outside the shadow,
457.405	it would have to be more reflective
457.405	-- just the laws of physics.
460.826	So you see it that way.
462.368	Whereas on the right,
462.368	the information is consistent
465.05	with those two tiles
465.05	being under the same light.
467.757	If they're under the same light reflecting
467.757	the same amount of light to your eye,
471.614	then they must be equally reflective.
473.423	So you see it that way.
474.71	Which means we can bring
474.71	all this information together
477.26	to create some incredibly
477.26	strong illusions.
479.332	This is one I made a few years ago.
481.16	And you'll notice you see
481.16	a dark brown tile at the top,
484.497	and a bright orange tile at the side.
487	That is your perceptual reality.
488.754	The physical reality
488.754	is that those two tiles are the same.
494.16	Here you see four gray tiles on your left,
497.16	seven gray tiles on the right.
499.696	I'm not going to change
499.696	those tiles at all,
501.777	but I'm going to reveal
501.777	the rest of the scene.
503.968	And see what happens to your perception.
506.521	The four blue tiles on the left are gray.
510.054	The seven yellow tiles
510.054	on the right are also gray.
513.731	They are the same. Okay?
515.636	Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.
519.558	What's true for color is also true
519.558	for complex perceptions of motion.
523.836	So, here we have --
526.669	let's turn this around -- a diamond.
531.16	And what I'm going to do is,
531.16	I'm going to hold it here,
533.804	and I'm going to spin it.
536.991	And for all of you, you'll see it
536.991	probably spinning this direction.
540.159	Now I want you to keep looking at it.
542.795	Move your eyes around,
542.795	blink, maybe close one eye.
545.319	And suddenly it will flip, and start
545.319	spinning the opposite direction.
549.16	Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
552.356	Keep blinking.
553.587	Every time you blink, it will switch.
556.196	So I can ask you,
556.196	which direction is it rotating?
560.317	How do you know?
562.3	Your brain doesn't know,
562.3	because both are equally likely.
565.434	So depending on where it looks,
566.996	it flips between the two possibilities.
570.349	Are we the only ones that see illusions?
572.297	The answer to this question is no.
574.16	Even the beautiful bumblebee,
575.903	with its mere one million brain cells,
578.801	which is 250 times fewer cells
578.801	than you have in one retina,
581.84	sees illusions, does
581.84	the most complicated things
584.692	that even our most
584.692	sophisticated computers can't do.
587.501	So in my lab we work on bumblebees,
589.381	because we can completely
589.381	control their experience,
591.894	and see how it alters
591.894	the architecture of their brain.
594.451	We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.
596.576	Here you have the hive.
597.874	You can see the queen bee,
597.874	the large bee in the middle.
600.493	Those are her daughters, the eggs.
602.143	They go back and forth between this hive
602.143	and the arena, via this tube.
609.002	You'll see one of the bees come out here.
611.613	You see how she has
611.613	a little number on her?
614.16	There's another one coming out,
614.16	she also has a number on her.
617.585	Now, they're not born that way, right?
619.88	We pull them out, put them
619.88	in the fridge, and they fall asleep.
622.919	Then you can superglue
622.919	little numbers on them.
625.236	(Laughter)
626.443	And now, in this experiment they get
626.443	a reward if they go to the blue flowers.
630.16	They land on the flower,
631.377	stick their tongue in there,
631.377	called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.
634.91	She's drinking a glass of water
634.91	that's about that big to you and I,
638.092	will do that about three times, then fly.
644.066	And sometimes they learn
644.066	not to go to the blue,
646.368	but to go where the other bees go.
648.16	So they copy each other.
649.398	They can count to five.
649.398	They can recognize faces.
651.708	And here she comes down the ladder.
653.693	And she'll come into the hive,
653.693	find an empty honey pot,
656.298	and throw up, and that's honey.
658.379	(Laughter)
659.554	Now remember, she's supposed
659.554	to be going to the blue flowers,
664.388	but what are these bees doing
664.388	in the upper right corner?
667.039	It looks like they're
667.039	going to green flowers.
669.552	Now, are they getting it wrong?
672.382	And the answer to the question is no.
672.382	Those are actually blue flowers.
675.898	But those are blue flowers
675.898	under green light.
679.485	So they're using the relationships
679.485	between the colors to solve the puzzle,
683.241	which is exactly what we do.
685.336	So, illusions are often used,
687.691	especially in art, in the words
687.691	of a more contemporary artist,
691.326	"""to demonstrate the fragility"
691.326	"of our senses."""
693.81	Okay, this is complete rubbish.
696.158	The senses aren't fragile.
696.158	And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
700.132	Instead, color tells us
700.132	something completely different,
703.055	that the brain didn't actually evolve
703.055	to see the world the way it is.
706.447	We can't.
707.682	Instead, the brain
707.682	evolved to see the world
710.118	the way it was useful to see in the past.
713.16	And how we see is by continually
713.16	redefining normality.
719.65	So, how can we take this incredible
719.65	capacity of plasticity of the brain
726.546	and get people to experience
726.546	their world differently?
729.094	Well, one of the ways we do it
729.094	in my lab and studio
731.815	is we translate the light into sound,
735.077	and we enable people to hear
735.077	their visual world.
739.16	And they can navigate
739.16	the world using their ears.
742.425	Here's David on the right,
742.425	and he's holding a camera.
745.805	On the left is what his camera sees.
747.559	And you'll see there's a faint line
747.559	going across that image.
750.591	That line is broken up into 32 squares.
753.024	In each square,
753.024	we calculate the average color.
755.375	And then we just simply
755.375	translate that into sound.
757.78	And now he's going to turn around,
761.037	close his eyes,
763.921	and find a plate on the ground
763.921	with his eyes closed.
767.207	(Continuous sound)
770.164	(Sound changes momentarily)
772.302	(Sound changes momentarily)
775.143	(Sound changes momentarily)
779.58	(Sound changes momentarily)
783.286	(Sound changes momentarily)
785.773	Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?
787.738	So not only can we create a prosthetic
787.738	for the visually impaired,
790.825	but we can also investigate
793.332	how people literally
793.332	make sense of the world.
796.052	But we can also do something else.
797.711	We can also make music with color.
800.823	So, working with kids,
802.523	they created images,
804.34	thinking about what might
804.34	the images you see
806.48	sound like if we could listen to them.
808.328	And then we translated these images.
810.16	And this is one of those images.
812.16	And this is a six-year-old child
812.16	composing a piece of music
815.16	for a 32-piece orchestra.
818.16	And this is what it sounds like.
820.185	(Electronic representation
820.185	of orchestral music)
846.749	So, a six-year-old child. Okay?
849.04	Now, what does all this mean?
852.753	What this suggests is that no one
852.753	is an outside observer of nature, okay?
857.117	We're not defined
857.117	by our central properties,
859.206	by the bits that make us up.
860.894	We're defined by our environment
860.894	and our interaction with that environment,
864.592	by our ecology.
866.268	And that ecology is necessarily
866.268	relative, historical and empirical.
874.205	So, what I'd like to finish with
874.205	is this over here.
878.49	Because what I've been trying to do
878.49	is really celebrate uncertainty.
881.775	Because I think only through uncertainty
881.775	is there potential for understanding.
885.56	So, if some of you are still
885.56	feeling a bit too certain,
888.452	I'd like to do this one.
890.018	So, if we have the lights down.
892.456	And what we have here --
898.546	Can everyone see 25
898.546	purple surfaces on your left,
903.34	and 25, call it yellowish,
903.34	surfaces on your right?
907.556	So now, what I want to do,
908.894	I'm going to put
908.894	the middle nine surfaces here
911.935	under yellow illumination,
913.586	by simply putting a filter behind them.
918.054	Now you can see that changes the light
918.054	that's coming through there, right?
922.049	Because now the light is going
922.049	through a yellowish filter
925.154	and then a purplish filter.
926.725	I'm going to do the opposite
926.725	on the left here.
931.06	I'm going to put the middle nine
931.06	under a purplish light.
938.16	Now, some of you will have noticed
938.16	that the consequence
942.721	is that the light coming through those
942.721	middle nine on the right,
945.808	or your left, is exactly
945.808	the same as the light
948.64	coming through the middle
948.64	nine on your right.
951.356	Agreed? Yes?
953.965	Okay. So they are physically the same.
956.538	Let's pull the covers off.
962.16	Now remember --
965.864	you know that the middle nine
965.864	are exactly the same.
969.607	Do they look the same?
972.462	No.
973.641	"The question is, ""Is that an illusion?"""
975.62	And I'll leave you with that.
977.051	So, thank you very much.
978.28	(Laughter)
979.469	(Applause)
