12.744	I have the feeling that we can all agree
15.851	that we're moving towards a new
18.078	model of the state and society.
20.943	But, we're absolutely clueless as to what this is
25.424	or what it should be.
27.11	It seems like we need to have
29.137	a conversation about democracy
32.139	in our day and age.
34.494	Let's think about it this way:
36.99	We are 21st-century citizens, doing our
40.976	very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed
40.976	institutions
47.072	that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.
52.395	Let's have a look at some of the
53.806	characteristics of this system.
56.242	First of all, it's designed for an information technology
59.747	that's over 500 years old.
62.846	And the best possible system
65.082	that could be designed for it
66.617	is one where the few make daily decisions
70.841	in the name of the many.
72.275	And the many get to vote once every 
72.275	couple of years.
77.81	In the second place, the costs of
79.159	participating in this system are
81.451	incredibly high.
82.658	You either have to have a fair 
82.658	bit of money
85.7	and influence, or you have to devote your entire
90.052	life to politics.
91.89	You have to become a party member
93.83	and slowly start working up the ranks
97.448	until maybe, one day, you'll get 
97.448	to sit at a table
101.364	where a decision is being made.
103.933	And last but not least,
105.749	the language of the system â€”
107.669	it's incredibly cryptic.
109.518	It's done for lawyers, by lawyers,
112.702	and no one else can understand.
115.548	So, it's a system where we can
118.223	choose our authorities,
120.158	but we are completely left out on how
120.158	those authorities
123.994	reach their decisions.
126.845	So, in a day where a new information technology
130.16	allows us to participate globally
130.16	in any conversation,
136.456	our barriers of information are completely lowered
139.609	and we can, more than ever before,
143.088	express our desires and our concerns.
146.766	Our political system remains the same
149.519	for the past 200 years
153.135	and expects us to be contented with being 
153.135	simply passive recipients
158.918	of a monologue.
160.661	So, it's really not surprising that
163.104	this kind of system is only able to produce
166.446	two kinds of results:
168.378	silence or noise.
172.047	Silence, in terms of citizens not engaging,
175.836	simply not wanting to participate.
178.732	There's this commonplace 
178.732	[idea] that I truly, truly dislike,
182.01	and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally
186.069	apathetic. That we shun commitment.
189.175	But, can you really blame us
190.702	for not jumping at the opportunity of going
193.576	to the middle of the city in the middle
195.595	of a working day to attend, physically,
198.944	a public hearing that has no impact
202.364	whatsoever?
204.304	Conflict is bound to happen between a system
208.692	that no longer represents, nor has any dialogue capacity,
214.887	and citizens that are increasingly used
217.965	to representing themselves.
220.311	And, then we find noise:
222.615	Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico
222.615	Italy, France, Spain, the United States,
228.994	they're all democracies.
230.853	Their citizens have access to
232.765	the ballot boxes. But they still feel the need,
237.021	they need to take to the streets in order 
237.021	to be heard.
242.531	To me, it seems like the 18th-century
247.022	slogan that was the basis for the formation
250.082	"of our modern democracies, ""No taxation"
253.734	"without representation,"""
256.037	"can now be updated to ""No representation"
256.037	"without a conversation."""
263.168	We want our seat at the table.
267.704	And rightly so.
270.01	But in order to be part of this conversation,
272.39	we need to know what we want to do next,
275.901	because political action is being able
279.108	to move from agitation
281.429	to construction.
283.293	My generation has been incredibly good at
287.13	using new networks and technologies
289.751	to organize protests,
292.266	protests that were able to successfully
294.684	impose agendas,
296.643	roll back extremely pernicious legislation,
300.066	and even overthrow authoritarian governments.
303.267	And we should be immensely
305.263	proud of this.
307.622	But, we also must admit that we
309.47	haven't been good at using those
311.958	same networks and technologies
314.846	to successfully articulate an alternative
314.846	to what we're seeing
320.244	and find the consensus and build 
320.244	the alliances that are needed
325.061	to make it happen.
327.079	And so the risk that we face
329.575	is that we can create these huge power vacuums
333.208	that will very quickly get filled up by de facto
337.295	powers, like the military or highly
340.176	motivated and already organized groups
343.075	that generally lie on the extremes.
346.745	But our democracy is neither
348.697	just a matter of voting once every
351.466	couple of years.
352.721	But it's not either the ability to bring millions
352.721	onto the streets.
358.657	So the question I'd like to raise here,
361.478	and I do believe it's the most important 
361.478	question we need to answer,
365	is this one:
366.357	If Internet is the new printing press,
370.036	then what is democracy for the Internet era?
374.872	What institutions do we want to build
377.822	for the 21st-century society?
381.781	I don't have the answer, just in case.
385.007	I don't think anyone does.
386.441	But I truly believe we can't afford
386.441	to ignore this question anymore.
391.456	So, I'd like to share our experience
393.393	and what we've learned so far
395.119	and hopefully contribute two cents
397.542	to this conversation.
399.72	Two years ago, with a group of friends
399.72	from Argentina,
403.438	"we started thinking, ""how can "
403.438	we get our representatives,
407.487	our elected representatives,
409.371	"to represent us?"""
413.719	Marshall McLuhan once said that politics
417.724	is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.
422.419	So the question that motivated us was,
424.933	can we try and solve some of today's problems
428.827	with the tools that we use every single
428.827	day of our lives?
432.929	Our first approach was to design and develop
435.879	a piece of software called DemocracyOS.
439.13	DemocracyOS is an open-source web application
442.255	that is designed to become a bridge
445.453	between citizens and their elected representatives
448.531	to make it easier for us to participate 
448.531	from our everyday lives.
454.239	So first of all, you can get informed so every new
457.578	project that gets introduced in Congress
460.254	gets immediately translated and explained
463.383	in plain language on this platform.
466.318	But we all know that social change
469.614	is not going to come from just knowing
472.372	more information,
473.644	but from doing something with it.
476.143	So better access to information
478.362	should lead to a conversation
480.693	about what we're going to do next,
482.544	and DemocracyOS allows for that.
484.626	Because we believe that democracy is
486.912	not just a matter of stacking up
488.957	preferences, one on top of each other,
491.776	but that our healthy and robust public debate
495.484	should be, once again, one of its fundamental values.
499.541	So DemocracyOS is about persuading 
499.541	and being persuaded.
503.743	It's about reaching a consensus
506.474	as much as finding a proper way
509.771	of channeling our disagreement.
512.496	And finally, you can vote
514.486	how you would like your elected 
514.486	representative to vote.
518.586	And if you do not feel comfortable
520.026	voting on a certain issue,
522.14	you can always delegate your vote
524.024	to someone else, allowing
525.767	for a dynamic and emerging social leadership.
531.346	It suddenly became very easy for us
532.729	to simply compare these results
535.444	with how our representatives were
537.148	voting in Congress.
538.551	But, it also became very evident that
540.984	technology was not going to do the trick.
544.942	What we needed to do to was to find
546.821	actors that were able to
549.441	grab this distributed knowledge
552.345	in society and use it to make better
552.345	and more fair decisions.
558.409	So we reached out to traditional political parties
561.697	and we offered them DemocracyOS.
563.892	"We said, ""Look, here you have a platform"
563.892	that you can use to build
568.216	"a two-way conversation with your constituencies."""
572.124	And yes, we failed.
574.687	We failed big time.
577.683	We were sent to play 
577.683	outside like little kids.
582.009	Amongst other things, we were called naive.
584.405	And I must be honest: I think, in hindsight, we were.
588.201	Because the challenges that we face, they're not
590.667	technological, they're cultural.
593.552	Political parties were never willing
595.946	to change the way they make their decisions.
599.95	So it suddenly became a bit obvious
601.678	that if we wanted to move forward
601.678	with this idea,
605.094	we needed to do it ourselves.
608.035	And so we took quite a leap of faith,
610.044	and in August last year, we founded
612.869	our own political party,
614.965	El Partido de la Red,
616.078	or the Net Party, in the city of 
616.078	Buenos Aires.
620.25	And taking an even bigger leap of faith,
623.927	we ran for elections in October last year
628.173	with this idea:
629.769	if we want a seat in Congress,
632.366	our candidate, our representatives
634.384	were always going to vote according to
637.758	what citizens decided on DemocracyOS.
641.267	Every single project that got introduced
644.119	in Congress, we were going vote
645.846	according to what citizens decided
645.846	on an online platform.
650.588	It was our way of hacking the political system.
654.238	We understood that if we wanted
656.164	to become part of the conversation,
658.513	to have a seat at the table,
660.185	we needed to become valid stakeholders,
663.894	and the only way of doing it is to play by the 
663.894	system rules.
668.116	But we were hacking it in the sense that
671.105	we were radically changing the way a political party
675.193	makes its decisions.
676.612	For the first time, we were making our decisions
680.115	together with those who we were
682.868	affecting directly by those decisions.
687.247	It was a very, very bold move for a two-month-old party
690.985	in the city of Buenos Aires.
692.664	But it got attention.
694.239	We got 22,000 votes, that's 1.2 percent of the votes,
698.952	and we came in second for the local options.
703.128	So, even if that wasn't enough to win a
705.328	seat in Congress, it was enough
707.454	for us to become part of the conversation,
710.637	to the extent that next month,
714.208	Congress, as an institution, is launching
717.229	for the first time in Argentina's history,
720.097	a DemocracyOS to discuss,
722.519	with the citizens, three pieces of legislation:
726.189	two on urban transportation and
728.296	one on the use of public space.
731.288	Of course, our elected representatives are not
734.077	"saying, ""Yes, we're going to vote"
736.094	"according to what citizens decide,"""
738.667	but they're willing to try.
740.693	They're willing to open up a new space
743.923	for citizen engagement and hopefully
746.568	they'll be willing to listen as well.
749.824	Our political system can be transformed,
753.888	and not by subverting it, by destroying it,
757.566	but by rewiring it with the tools that
761.185	Internet affords us now.
763.937	But a real challenge is to find, to design
768.324	to create, to empower those connectors
771.753	that are able to innovate, to transform
775.572	noise and silence into signal
778.24	and finally bring our democracies
780.178	to the 21st century.
782.506	I'm not saying it's easy.
785.237	But in our experience, we actually stand a chance
788.82	of making it work.
791.154	And in my heart, it's most definitely
794.286	worth trying.
795.567	Thank you.
796.799	(Applause)
