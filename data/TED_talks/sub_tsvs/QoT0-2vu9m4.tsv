12.404	I've noticed something interesting
12.404	about society and culture.
15.31	Everything risky requires a license.
17.892	So, learning to drive,
17.892	owning a gun, getting married.
23.177	There's a certain --
24.535	(Laughter)
26.859	That's true in everything risky,
26.859	except technology.
30.604	For some reason,
30.604	there's no standard syllabus,
32.963	there's no basic course.
34.953	They just sort of give you your computer
34.953	and then kick you out of the nest.
38.596	You're supposed to learn
38.596	this stuff -- how?
40.897	Just by osmosis.
42.148	Nobody ever sits down and tells you,
42.148	"""This is how it works."""
45.064	So today I'm going to tell you ten things
48.041	that you thought everybody knew,
48.041	but it turns out they don't.
51.431	First of all, on the web,
51.431	if you want to scroll down,
54.241	don't pick up the mouse
54.241	and use the scroll bar.
56.506	That's a terrible waste of time.
58.057	Do that only if you're paid by the hour.
60.121	Instead, hit the space bar.
62.022	The space bar scrolls down one page.
65.885	Hold down the Shift key
65.885	to scroll back up again.
68.79	So, space bar to scroll down one page;
68.79	works in every browser,
71.726	in every kind of computer.
73.003	Also on the web, when you're filling in
73.003	one of these forms like your addresses,
76.749	I assume you know
76.749	that you can hit the Tab key
78.982	to jump from box to box to box.
80.585	But what about the pop-up menu
80.585	where you put in your state?
83.755	Don't open the pop-up menu.
85.684	That's a terrible waste of calories.
87.572	Type the first letter of your state
87.572	over and over and over.
91.166	So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.
93.418	If you want Texas, go T, T,
93.418	and you jump right to that thing
96.854	without even opening the pop-up menu.
99.278	Also on the web,
99.278	when the text is too small,
102.186	what you do is hold down the Control key
102.186	and hit plus, plus, plus.
105.71	You make the text larger with each tap.
108.917	Works on every computer,
108.917	every web browser,
111.009	or minus, minus, to get smaller again.
113.003	If you're on the Mac,
113.003	it might be Command instead.
115.593	When you're typing
115.593	on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,
119.457	don't bother switching layouts
119.457	to the punctuation layout
122.743	to hit the period and then a space,
124.601	then try to capitalize the next letter.
126.53	Just hit the space bar twice.
128.557	The phone puts the period,
128.557	the space, and the capital for you.
132.531	Go space, space.
133.75	It is totally amazing.
135.938	Also when it comes
135.938	to cell phones, on all phones,
138.976	if you want to redial
138.976	somebody that you've dialed before,
142.586	all you have to do is hit the call button,
145.131	and it puts the last phone number
145.131	into the box for you,
148.726	and at that point you can hit
148.726	call again to actually dial it.
151.881	No need to go to the recent calls list
151.881	if you're trying to call somebody
155.429	just hit the call button again.
156.944	Something that drives me crazy:
158.451	When I call you and leave a message
158.451	on your voice mail,
161.07	"I hear you saying, ""Leave a message,"""
162.864	and then I get these 15 seconds
162.864	of freaking instructions,
166.245	like we haven't had
166.245	answering machines for 45 years!
169.933	(Laughter)
173.621	I'm not bitter.
175.098	(Laughter)
176.129	So it turns out
176.129	there's a keyboard shortcut
178.365	that lets you jump directly
178.365	to the beep like this.
180.747	Phone: At the tone, please...
182.358	(Beep)
183.383	David Pogue: Unfortunately,
183.383	the carriers didn't adopt
185.897	the same keystroke,
185.897	so it's different by carrier,
188.362	so it devolves upon you
188.362	to learn the keystroke
191.427	for the person you're calling.
194.058	I didn't say these were going
194.058	to be perfect.
196.656	So most of you think of Google
198.33	as something that lets you
198.33	look up a web page,
200.606	but it is also a dictionary.
202	"Type the word ""define"""
202	and the word you want to know.
204.616	You don't even have to click anything.
206.465	There's the definition as you type.
208.545	It's also a complete FAA database.
210.6	Type the name of the airline
210.6	and the flight.
212.708	It shows you where the flight is,
212.708	the gate, the terminal,
215.431	how long until it lands.
216.741	You don't need an app.
218.176	It's also unit and currency conversion.
220.167	Again, you don't have to click
220.167	one of the results.
222.814	Just type it into the box,
222.814	and there's your answer.
225.443	While we're talking about text --
227.945	When you want to highlight --
230.712	this is just an example --
232.102	(Laughter)
233.99	When you want to highlight a word,
236.273	please don't waste your life
236.273	dragging across it
239.267	with the mouse like a newbie.
240.701	Double click the word.
242.359	"Watch ""200"" -- I go double-click,"
244.044	it neatly selects just that word.
245.777	Also, don't delete
245.777	what you've highlighted.
248.518	You can just type over it.
249.915	This is in every program.
251.469	Also, you can go double-click, drag,
253.484	to highlight in one-word
253.484	increments as you drag.
256.39	Much more precise.
257.654	Again, don't bother deleting.
259.513	Just type over it.
260.843	(Laughter)
264.575	Shutter lag is the time
264.575	between your pressing the shutter button
268.08	and the moment the camera actually snaps.
270.438	It's extremely frustrating
270.438	on any camera under $1,000.
273.406	(Camera click)
275.04	(Laughter)
278.383	So, that's because the camera needs time
278.383	to calculate the focus and exposure,
282.381	but if you pre-focus with a half-press,
285.266	leave your finger down --
287.056	no shutter lag!
289.309	You get it every time.
291.438	I've just turned your $50 camera
291.438	into a $1,000 camera with that trick.
295.646	And finally, it often happens
295.646	that you're giving a talk,
298.979	and for some reason,
298.979	the audience is looking at the slide
302.035	instead of at you!
303.317	(Laughter)
305.715	So when that happens --
305.715	this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,
308.642	it works in every program
308.642	-- all you do is hit the letter B key,
311.677	B for blackout, to black out the slide,
311.677	make everybody look at you,
315.254	and then when you're ready
315.254	to go on, you hit B again,
317.757	and if you're really on a roll,
317.757	"you can hit the W key for ""whiteout,"""
322.244	and you white out the slide,
323.979	and then you can hit W again
323.979	to un-blank it.
326.644	So I know I went super fast.
328.278	If you missed anything, I'll be happy
328.278	to send you the list of these tips.
331.746	In the meantime, congratulations.
333.345	You all get your California
333.345	Technology License.
335.802	Have a great day.
337.038	(Applause)
