12.942	Ah yes, those university days,
15.77	a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics
19.673	and world debating championships,
22.144	"or, as I like to say, ""Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."""
27.397	Didn't get much sexier than the Spence
29.389	at university, let me tell you.
30.853	It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer
35.239	from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage
37.57	literally on the other side of the world.
39.733	And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard
41.366	about Australians are true.
43.011	From the youngest of ages, we display
45.433	a prodigious sporting talent.
47.944	On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.
52.289	What you've heard is true.
52.946	Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,
56.77	sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)
60.52	This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.
66.707	I'm almost five years old. Fair to say,
68.629	I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.
71.009	But I stand before you today
74.889	not as a breakfast radio host,
76.335	not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,
80.241	and always will be a mathematician.
83.421	And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug
85.615	knows that it bites early and it bites deep.
89.375	I cast my mind back when I was in second grade
92.312	at a beautiful little government-run school
94.335	called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,
98.09	and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,
100.151	Ms. Russell, said to the class,
101.879	"""Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?"
104.344	"I've got no plans."""
106.613	It was an exercise in democratic schooling,
109.76	and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.
114.382	So some of the suggestions we made as to what
116.124	we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,
118.688	and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion
120.962	and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,
123.107	"""That wouldn't work."
124.704	"That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."""
128.695	Now I wasn't trying to be smart.
130.962	I wasn't trying to be funny.
131.797	I just politely raised my hand,
134.012	and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,
135.995	in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,
138.631	"""But Miss,"
142.194	surely if the diagonal of the square
145.99	is less than the diameter of the circle,
150.201	"well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."""
153.086	(Laughter)
156.104	"""It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"""
160.375	And there was that same awkward silence
162.018	from most of my classmates,
163.216	until sitting next to me, one of my friends,
165.319	one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across
167.771	and punched me really hard in the head.
170.114	(Laughter)
171.198	"Now what Steven was saying was, ""Look, Adam,"
173.699	you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.
178.248	You can keep sitting here with us.
180.525	Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit
182.195	"over there with them."""
185.975	I thought about it for a nanosecond.
187.577	I took one look at the road map of life,
191.353	"and I ran off down the street marked ""Geek"""
195.181	as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.
200.623	I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.
204.351	I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.
207.209	It's natural. It's everywhere.
209.193	Numbers are the musical notes
212.498	with which the symphony of the universe is written.
216.72	The great Descartes said something quite similar.
219.003	"The universe ""is written in the mathematical language."""
221.713	And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,
225.937	a number so beautiful, so massive,
230.329	I think it will blow your mind.
232.902	Today we're going to talk about prime numbers.
235.649	Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime
239.615	because it's 2 x 3.
241.931	Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7,
245.545	but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,
248.148	or as we call them, factors.
250.131	Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.
252.621	One is not prime.
254.632	The proof of that is a great party trick
257.172	that admittedly only works at certain parties.
260.076	(Laughter)
263.066	Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.
266.728	They keep going on forever.
268.14	We know there are an infinite number of primes
269.979	due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.
271.929	Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.
275.161	But the third thing about prime numbers,
276.858	mathematicians have always wondered,
278.368	well at any given moment in time,
280.63	what is the biggest prime that we know about?
283.433	Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime.
287.741	Don't freak out.
290.888	All you need to know, of all the mathematics
293.889	you've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,
298.374	never understood in the first place,
300.107	all you need to know is this:
302.492	When I say 2 ^ 5,
306.739	I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other
309.586	all multiplied together,
310.881	2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.
314.097	So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,
317.501	8, 16, 32.
319.681	If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?
323.195	So 2 ^ 5,
325.167	those five little twos multiplied together.
326.879	(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.
334.453	is also a prime number.
336.998	And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found
340.502	are of that form:
341.738	two to a prime number, take away one.
345.017	I won't go into great detail as to why,
347.434	because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,
350.185	but suffice to say, a number of that form
354.396	is fairly easy to test for primacy.
357.859	A random odd number is a lot harder to test.
361.459	But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,
363.38	we realize it's not enough
365.219	just to put in any prime number in the power.
367.96	(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,
370.557	and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.
373.925	(Laughter)
376.051	But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1
379.291	(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.
382.648	After that point, they thin out a lot.
385.517	And one of the things about the search for massive primes
387.647	that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds
390.786	of all time have gone on this search.
393.303	This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
396.04	In the 1700s, other mathematicians said
398.501	he is simply the master of us all.
401.533	He was so respected, they put him on European currency
404.721	back when that was a compliment.
407.366	(Laughter)
412.346	Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:
415.429	(2 ^ 31) - 1.
417.216	It's over two billion.
419.564	He proved it was prime with nothing more
421.599	than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.
425.387	You think that's big.
426.341	We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1
429.618	is a prime number.
431.212	It's an absolute brute.
432.856	Look at it here: 39 digits long,
436.861	proven to be prime in 1876
440.224	by a mathematician called Lucas.
442.288	Word up, L-Dog.
444.224	(Laughter)
445.969	But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,
448.363	it's not just finding the primes.
449.56	Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.
453.811	Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,
462.269	But he didn't know what the factors were.
464.698	We knew it was like six, but we didn't know
466.483	what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together
468.904	to give us that massive number.
470.154	We didn't know for almost 40 years
472.195	until Frank Nelson Cole came along.
475.117	And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,
477.495	he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,
481.291	and started writing out the powers of two:
484.056	two, four, eight, 16 --
487.177	come on, join in with me, you know how it goes --
497.355	I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.
499.907	Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there.
502.677	He went on and on
504.34	and calculated 67 powers of two.
508.009	He took away one and wrote that number on the board.
510.501	A frisson of excitement went around the room.
514.842	It got even more exciting when he then wrote down
517.104	these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format --
521.509	and for the rest of the hour of his talk
525.416	Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.
530.049	He had found the prime factors
532.223	of (2 ^ 67) - 1.
534.633	The room went berserk --
537.135	(Laughter) --
538.955	as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,
540.997	having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics
544.344	with no words.
547.153	He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.
549.84	It took focus. It took dedication.
552.49	It took him, by his estimate,
554.49	"""three years of Sundays."""
558.461	But then in the field of mathematics,
560.799	as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,
563.914	the age of the computer goes along and things explode.
568.257	These are the largest prime numbers we knew
570.694	decade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before
574.101	as computers took over and our power to calculate
577.301	just grew and grew.
579.23	This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,
582.295	a very emotional year for me.
584.315	It was the year I left university.
586.25	I was torn between mathematics and media.
588.875	It was a tough decision. I loved university.
591.33	My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.
595.203	(Laughter)
597.786	But I came to a realization about my own ability.
601.413	Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,
604.93	I'm a maths genius.
606.805	In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,
608.882	I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.
612.611	My skill is not in the mathematics.
614.358	It is in telling the story of the mathematics.
618.25	And during that time, since I've left university,
620.436	these numbers have got bigger and bigger,
622.572	each one dwarfing the last,
624.338	until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,
629.231	who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,
632.59	only to see it snatched away by a rival university.
635.895	And then Curtis Cooper got it back.
640.072	Not years ago, not months ago, days ago.
645.399	In an amazing moment of serendipity,
647.043	I had to send TED a new slide
651.195	to show you what this guy had done.
653.205	I still remember -- (Applause) --
655.855	I still remember when it happened.
657.358	I was doing my breakfast radio show.
658.806	I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:
660.178	"""Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"""
662.483	I shivered --
663.897	(Laughter) --
665.637	contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,
668.719	"and said ""Girls, hold the front page."
671.17	We're not talking politics today.
672.63	We're not talking sport today.
674.587	"They found another megaprime."""
676.917	The girls just shook their heads,
678.429	put them in their hands, and let me go my own way.
680.666	It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,
683.242	currently the largest prime number we know,
685.571	is 2 ^ 57,885,161.
693.581	Don't forget to subtract the one.
696.384	This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.
703.608	If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,
707.034	that's 22 meg.
709.829	For the slightly less geeky of you,
711.873	think about the Harry Potter novels, okay?
714.01	This is the first Harry Potter novel.
716.36	This is all seven Harry Potter novels,
718.062	because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.
720.424	(Laughter)
723.943	Written out as a book, this number would run
726.255	the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.
730.73	Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.
736.269	If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,
739.39	we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,
743.958	it would have taken five hours to show you that number.
749.328	I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.
752.294	That's the way it goes.
754.897	This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,
759.317	and we know it is prime as confidently
763.44	as we know the number seven is prime.
766.814	That fills me with almost sexual excitement.
772.5	And who am I kidding when I say almost?
774.683	(Laughter)
777.245	I know what you're thinking:
778.896	Adam, we're happy that you're happy,
783.875	but why should we care?
786.373	Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.
789.083	First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer
792.634	"""Is that number prime?"" to type it in its abbreviated form,"
795.713	and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,
799.915	is a remarkably simple question to ask.
802.236	It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,
805.249	and just requires phenomenal grunt.
807.806	Large prime numbers are a great way of testing
809.975	the speed and accuracy of computer chips.
812.608	But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,
815.409	he wasn't the only guy searching.
817.334	My laptop at home was looking through
818.519	four potential candidate primes myself
820.794	as part of a networked computer hunt around the world
824.45	for these large numbers.
825.705	The discovery of that prime is similar to the work
827.634	people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,
830.836	in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.
833.908	We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs
837.15	are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia
839.669	but on laptops, desktops,
841.783	in the palms of people's hands
843.649	who are simply helping out for the search.
847.062	But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor
849.391	for the time in which we live,
851.328	when human minds and machines can conquer together.
856.172	We've heard a lot about robots in this TED.
858.531	We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.
860.141	It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone
862.663	an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.
866.558	You think that's cool.
868.022	Here's a machine doing something cool.
870.588	This is the CubeStormer II.
872.774	It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.
876.595	Using the power of the smartphone,
879.161	it can examine the cube and solve the cube
886.354	in five seconds.
889.053	(Applause)
892.934	That scares some people. That excites me.
896.999	How lucky are we to live in this age
900.23	when mind and machine can work together?
903.523	I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity
905.795	"as a lower-case ""c"" celebrity in Australia,"
908.783	"""What was your highlight of 2012?"""
910.788	People were expecting me to talk about
912.25	my beloved Sydney Swans football team.
914.918	In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,
917.926	they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.
920.06	I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.
923.051	It wasn't my highlight of 2012.
925.165	People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.
927.128	It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.
929.196	It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.
931.251	It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.
933.415	No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,
936.994	was the discovery of the Higgs boson.
940.626	Give it up for the fundamental particle
943.302	that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.
946.307	(Applause)
947.803	And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was
952.852	considered one of the deepest of all questions:
955.262	How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
959.902	I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?
964.361	And he postulated a suggestion
966.175	that there's this infinite, incredibly small field
969.845	stretching throughout the universe,
971.963	and as other particles go through those particles
974.048	and interact, that's where they get their mass.
976.44	The rest of the scientific community said,
978.897	"""Great idea, Higgsy."
980.506	We've got no idea if we could ever prove it.
982.192	"It's beyond our reach."""
984.3	And within just 50 years,
986.797	in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,
992.681	we had designed the greatest machine ever
996.313	to prove this incredible idea
999.379	that originated just in a human mind.
1003.342	That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.
1005.874	We thought it might be there,
1007.96	and we went and found it.
1010.38	That is the essence of being human.
1014.28	That is what we are all about.
1017.954	Or as my friend Descartes might put it,
1019.923	we think,
1021.636	therefore we are.
1024.049	Thank you.
1025.44	(Applause)
