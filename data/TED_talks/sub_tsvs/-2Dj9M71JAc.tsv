13.056	On the path that American children 
13.056	travel to adulthood,
16.971	two institutions oversee the journey.
20.519	The first is the one we hear 
20.519	a lot about: college.
24.262	Some of you may remember
24.262	the excitement that you felt
26.845	when you first set off for college.
29.431	Some of you may be in college right now
31.983	and you're feeling this excitement
31.983	at this very moment.
35.988	College has some shortcomings.
37.667	It's expensive; it leaves
37.667	young people in debt.
41.003	But all in all, it's a pretty good path.
43.947	Young people emerge from college
43.947	with pride and with great friends
49.114	and with a lot of knowledge 
49.114	about the world.
51.453	And perhaps most importantly,
53.289	a better chance in the labor market
53.289	than they had before they got there.
57.795	Today I want to talk about
57.795	the second institution
60.498	overseeing the journey from childhood
60.498	to adulthood in the United States.
66.056	And that institution is prison.
70.791	Young people on this journey
70.791	are meeting with probation officers
74.536	instead of with teachers.
76.939	They're going to court dates
76.939	instead of to class.
80.832	Their junior year abroad is instead
80.832	a trip to a state correctional facility.
85.909	And they're emerging from their 20s
88.599	not with degrees in business and English,
91.796	but with criminal records.
94.514	This institution is also costing us a lot,
97.107	about 40,000 dollars a year
98.749	to send a young person
98.749	to prison in New Jersey.
103.167	But here, taxpayers are footing the bill
105.723	and what kids are getting
105.723	is a cold prison cell
109.206	and a permanent mark against them
109.206	when they come home
112.016	and apply for work.
114.765	There are more and more kids
114.765	on this journey to adulthood
118.211	than ever before in the United States
118.211	and that's because in the past 40 years,
123.435	our incarceration rate 
123.435	has grown by 700 percent.
129.187	I have one slide for this talk.
131.316	Here it is.
133.76	Here's our incarceration rate,
135.623	about 716 people per 100,000
135.623	in the population.
143.205	Here's the OECD countries.
150.885	What's more, it's poor kids
150.885	that we're sending to prison,
153.617	too many drawn from African-American
153.617	and Latino communities
157.105	so that prison now stands firmly between
157.105	the young people trying to make it
161.986	and the fulfillment of the American Dream.
165.418	The problem's actually 
165.418	a bit worse than this
168.274	'cause we're not just sending 
168.274	poor kids to prison,
170.952	we're saddling poor kids with court fees,
173.919	with probation and parole restrictions,
176.24	with low-level warrants,
178.127	we're asking them to live 
178.127	in halfway houses and on house arrest,
181.622	and we're asking them 
181.622	to negotiate a police force
185.227	that is entering poor
185.227	communities of color,
187.64	not for the purposes 
187.64	of promoting public safety,
190.839	but to make arrest counts,
190.839	to line city coffers.
198.537	This is the hidden underside to our
198.537	historic experiment in punishment:
202.925	young people worried that at any moment,
202.925	they will be stopped, searched and seized.
208.635	Not just in the streets, 
208.635	but in their homes,
211.258	at school and at work.
214.925	I got interested in this 
214.925	other path to adulthood
218.116	when I was myself a college student
220.357	attending the University of Pennsylvania
222.415	in the early 2000s.
224.493	Penn sits within a historic 
224.493	African-American neighborhood.
228.06	So you've got these two parallel
228.06	journeys going on simultaneously:
233.298	the kids attending 
233.298	this elite, private university,
236.419	and the kids from 
236.419	the adjacent neighborhood,
238.885	some of whom are making it to college,
240.813	and many of whom 
240.813	are being shipped to prison.
244.831	In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
244.831	a young woman who was in high school
249.415	who lived about 10 minutes
249.415	away from the university.
252.409	Soon, her cousin came home 
252.409	from a juvenile detention center.
255.942	He was 15, a freshman in high school.
258.6	I began to get to know him 
258.6	and his friends and family,
262.259	and I asked him what he thought 
262.259	about me writing about his life
265.611	for my senior thesis in college.
268.196	This senior thesis became
268.196	a dissertation at Princeton
272.387	and now a book.
273.935	By the end of my sophomore year,
275.533	I moved into the neighborhood
275.533	and I spent the next six years
278.903	trying to understand what young people
278.903	were facing as they came of age.
284.234	The first week I spent
284.234	in this neighborhood,
286.318	I saw two boys, five and seven years old,
288.894	play this game of chase,
290.386	where the older boy
290.386	ran after the other boy.
293.337	He played the cop.
294.532	When the cop caught up
294.532	to the younger boy,
296.72	he pushed him down,
298.42	handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,
300.971	took a quarter out of 
300.971	the other child's pocket,
303.282	"saying, ""I'm seizing that."""
306.874	He asked the child if 
306.874	he was carrying any drugs
310.214	or if he had a warrant.
312.659	Many times, I saw this game repeated,
314.664	sometimes children would 
314.664	simply give up running,
317.052	and stick their bodies flat 
317.052	against the ground
319.248	with their hands above their heads,
319.248	or flat up against a wall.
322.593	Children would yell at each other,
324.588	"""I'm going to lock you up,"
325.87	I'm going to lock you up
325.87	"and you're never coming home!"""
329.052	Once I saw a six-year-old child
329.052	pull another child's pants down
333.406	and try to do a cavity search.
336.756	In the first 18 months that I lived
336.756	in this neighborhood,
339.935	I wrote down every time I saw
339.935	any contact between police
343.627	and people that were my neighbors.
346.553	So in the first 18 months,
348.652	I watched the police stop 
348.652	pedestrians or people in cars,
352.421	search people, run people's names,
354.589	chase people through the streets,
356.533	pull people in for questioning,
358.306	or make an arrest every single day,
358.306	with five exceptions.
363.142	Fifty-two times, I watched the police
363.142	break down doors,
367.077	chase people through houses
369.118	or make an arrest of someone
369.118	in their home.
372.337	Fourteen times
372.337	in this first year and a half,
375.15	I watched the police punch, choke,
375.15	kick, stomp on or beat young men
380.45	after they had caught them.
384.289	Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,
386.665	Chuck and Tim.
388.209	Chuck was 18 when we met,
388.209	a senior in high school.
391.25	He was playing on the basketball team
391.25	and making C's and B's.
394.798	His younger brother, Tim, was 10.
396.697	And Tim loved Chuck;
396.697	he followed him around a lot,
399.848	looked to Chuck to be a mentor.
402.139	They lived with their mom and grandfather
404.285	in a two-story row home 
404.285	with a front lawn and a back porch.
407.724	Their mom was struggling with addiction
407.724	all while the boys were growing up.
411.385	She never really was able 
411.385	to hold down a job for very long.
415.242	It was their grandfather's pension
415.242	that supported the family,
418.281	not really enough to pay
418.281	for food and clothes
421.484	and school supplies for growing boys.
424.215	The family was really struggling.
426.401	So when we met, Chuck was
426.401	a senior in high school.
428.78	He had just turned 18.
431.628	That winter, a kid in the schoolyard
434.77	called Chuck's mom a crack whore.
438.029	Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow
440.904	and the school cops charged him 
440.904	with aggravated assault.
444.729	The other kid was fine the next day,
446.479	I think it was his pride that was injured
446.479	more than anything.
449.952	But anyway, since Chuck was 18,
451.665	this agg. assault case sent him 
451.665	to adult county jail
454.853	on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,
457.278	where he sat, unable to pay the bail --
457.278	he couldn't afford it --
461.345	while the trial dates 
461.345	dragged on and on and on
464.544	through almost his entire senior year.
467.926	Finally, near the end of this season,
470.976	the judge on this assault case
470.976	threw out most of the charges
474.323	and Chuck came home
475.657	with only a few hundred dollars' worth
475.657	of court fees hanging over his head.
480.004	Tim was pretty happy that day.
482.547	The next fall, Chuck tried 
482.547	to re-enroll as a senior,
485.301	but the school secretary told him that
487.315	he was then 19 and too old 
487.315	to be readmitted.
490.446	Then the judge on his assault case
490.446	issued him a warrant for his arrest
494.113	because he couldn't pay 
494.113	the 225 dollars in court fees
497.388	that came due a few weeks after
497.388	the case ended.
500.915	Then he was a high school dropout
500.915	living on the run.
504.935	Tim's first arrest came later that year
506.987	after he turned 11.
508.77	Chuck had managed
508.77	to get his warrant lifted
510.9	and he was on a payment plan
510.9	for the court fees
513.561	and he was driving Tim to school
513.561	in his girlfriend's car.
517.071	So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,
519.806	and the car comes up 
519.806	as stolen in California.
523.591	Chuck had no idea where in the history
523.591	of this car it had been stolen.
527.714	His girlfriend's uncle bought it
527.714	from a used car auction
531.19	in northeast Philly.
532.657	Chuck and Tim had never been
532.657	outside of the tri-state,
535.485	let alone to California.
537.834	But anyway, the cops down at the precinct
539.932	charged Chuck with 
539.932	receiving stolen property.
543.5	And then a juvenile judge, 
543.5	a few days later,
546.312	charged Tim, age 11,
548.464	with accessory to receiving
548.464	a stolen property
551.537	and then he was placed on 
551.537	three years of probation.
556.43	With this probation sentence 
556.43	hanging over his head,
559.332	Chuck sat his little brother down
561.419	and began teaching him
561.419	how to run from the police.
564.868	They would sit side by side 
564.868	on their back porch
567.2	looking out into the shared alleyway
569.264	and Chuck would coach Tim
569.264	how to spot undercover cars,
573.104	how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
573.104	how and where to hide.
579.011	I want you to imagine for a second
580.691	what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like
583.06	if they were living in a neighborhood
583.06	where kids were going to college,
587.809	not prison.
589.918	A neighborhood like the one 
589.918	I got to grow up in.
593.071	Okay, you might say.
594.536	But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
594.536	they're committing crimes!
598.288	Don't they deserve to be in prison?
600.414	Don't they deserve to be 
600.414	living in fear of arrest?
604.228	Well, my answer would be no.
607.35	They don't.
608.43	And certainly not for the same things 
608.43	that other young people
611.457	with more privilege are doing
611.457	with impunity.
614.901	If Chuck had gone to my high school,
616.718	that schoolyard fight 
616.718	would have ended there,
619.041	as a schoolyard fight.
620.717	It never would have become
620.717	an aggravated assault case.
624.937	Not a single kid that
624.937	I went to college with
627.758	has a criminal record right now.
629.437	Not a single one.
631.311	But can you imagine how many might have
631.311	if the police had stopped those kids
635.316	and searched their pockets for drugs
635.316	as they walked to class?
639.183	Or had raided their frat parties
639.183	in the middle of the night?
644.384	Okay, you might say.
645.656	But doesn't this high incarceration rate
647.646	partly account for our 
647.646	really low crime rate?
650.399	Crime is down. That's a good thing.
652.823	Totally, that is a good thing.
652.823	Crime is down.
655.31	It dropped precipitously in
655.31	the '90s and through the 2000s.
658.837	But according to a committee of academics
660.882	convened by the National Academy
660.882	of Sciences last year,
664.536	the relationship between our
664.536	historically high incarceration rates
668.545	and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.
672.129	It turns out that the crime rate
672.129	goes up and down
675.569	irrespective of how many young people
675.569	we send to prison.
681.265	We tend to think about justice
681.265	in a pretty narrow way:
684.358	good and bad, innocent and guilty.
687.962	Injustice is about being 
687.962	wrongfully convicted.
691.317	So if you're convicted 
691.317	of something you did do,
693.632	you should be punished for it.
695.467	There are innocent and guilty people,
697.233	there are victims and 
697.233	there are perpetrators.
699.67	Maybe we could think a little bit
699.67	more broadly than that.
704.071	Right now, we're asking kids who live
704.071	in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,
708.505	who have the least amount
708.505	of family resources,
710.786	who are attending 
710.786	the country's worst schools,
713.347	who are facing the toughest time
713.347	in the labor market,
716.253	who are living in neighborhoods
716.253	where violence is an everyday problem,
719.906	we're asking these kids to walk
719.906	the thinnest possible line --
724.479	to basically never do anything wrong.
728.29	Why are we not providing support
728.29	to young kids facing these challenges?
732.791	Why are we offering only handcuffs,
732.791	jail time and this fugitive existence?
740.037	Can we imagine something better?
742.543	Can we imagine a criminal justice system
742.543	that prioritizes recovery,
746.798	prevention, civic inclusion,
749.385	rather than punishment?
752.086	(Applause)
759.855	A criminal justice system 
759.855	that acknowledges
762.13	the legacy of exclusion that poor people
762.13	of color in the U.S. have faced
766.11	and that does not promote
766.11	and perpetuate those exclusions.
770.266	(Applause)
775.291	And finally, a criminal justice system
775.291	that believes in black young people,
779.853	rather than treating black young people 
779.853	as the enemy to be rounded up.
783.717	(Applause)
791.46	The good news is that we already are.
794.287	A few years ago, Michelle Alexander
794.287	"wrote ""The New Jim Crow,"""
799.11	which got Americans to see 
799.11	incarceration as a civil rights issue
803.123	of historic proportions in a way
803.123	they had not seen it before.
807.479	President Obama and Attorney General 
807.479	Eric Holder have come out very strongly
811.238	on sentencing reform,
812.955	on the need to address 
812.955	racial disparity in incarceration.
816.699	We're seeing states throw out
816.699	Stop and Frisk
819.309	as the civil rights violation that it is.
822.345	We're seeing cities and states
822.345	decriminalize possession of marijuana.
827.4	New York, New Jersey
827.4	and California
829.257	have been dropping their 
829.257	prison populations, closing prisons,
833.094	while also seeing a big drop in crime.
835.375	Texas has gotten into the game now,
837.068	also closing prisons, 
837.068	investing in education.
840.913	This curious coalition is building 
840.913	from the right and the left,
844.57	made up of former prisoners
844.57	and fiscal conservatives,
848.018	of civil rights activists
848.018	and libertarians,
851.349	of young people taking to the streets
851.349	to protest police violence
855.329	against unarmed black teenagers,
858.165	and older, wealthier people --
860.211	some of you are here in the audience --
862.082	pumping big money into 
862.082	decarceration initiatives
867.357	In a deeply divided Congress,
869.107	the work of reforming 
869.107	our criminal justice system
871.81	is just about the only thing
871.81	that the right and the left
874.602	are coming together on.
877.187	I did not think I would see
877.187	this political moment in my lifetime.
881.102	I think many of the people
881.102	who have been working tirelessly
884.71	to write about the causes and consequences
886.872	of our historically 
886.872	high incarceration rates
889.104	did not think we would see
889.104	this moment in our lifetime.
892.87	The question for us now is,
892.87	how much can we make of it?
896.653	How much can we change?
899.618	I want to end with a call to young people,
902.182	the young people attending college
903.816	and the young people
903.816	struggling to stay out of prison
906.926	or to make it through prison
906.926	and return home.
910.03	It may seem like these paths
910.03	to adulthood are worlds apart,
914.063	but the young people participating
914.063	in these two institutions
918.505	conveying us to adulthood,
920.43	they have one thing in common:
922.995	Both can be leaders in the work
922.995	of reforming our criminal justice system.
928.483	Young people have always been leaders
928.483	in the fight for equal rights,
931.815	the fight for more people 
931.815	to be granted dignity
934.08	and a fighting chance at freedom.
936.635	The mission for the generation 
936.635	of young people
939.014	coming of age in this, a sea-change
939.014	moment, potentially,
943.994	is to end mass incarceration and 
943.994	build a new criminal justice system,
949.258	emphasis on the word justice.
952.185	Thanks.
953.589	(Applause)
