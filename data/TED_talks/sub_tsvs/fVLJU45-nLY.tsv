15.631	I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers
18.399	you hope you're not going to meet at TED.
21.614	First, I don't have a mobile,
22.95	so I'm on the safe side.
24.781	Secondly, a political theorist
26.982	who's going to talk about the crisis of democracy
29.447	is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about.
33.519	And plus, I'm not going to give you any answers.
36.002	I'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we're talking about.
39.836	And one of the things that I want to question
42.002	is this very popular hope these days
44.719	that transparency and openness
46.653	can restore the trust in democratic institutions.
50.953	There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me.
54.669	You people, the Church of TED, are a very optimistic community.
58.646	(Laughter)
60.854	Basically you believe in complexity, but not in ambiguity.
65.771	As you have been told, I'm Bulgarian.
68.686	And according to the surveys,
70.27	we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world.
73.837	(Laughter)
75.621	The Economist magazine recently wrote an article
79.211	covering one of the recent studies on happiness,
81.762	"and the title was ""The Happy, the Unhappy and the Bulgarians."""
86.596	(Laughter)
88.196	So now when you know what to expect,
92.043	let's give you the story.
93.479	And this is a rainy election day in a small country --
98.43	that can be my country, but could be also your country.
101.762	And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,
105.562	nobody went to the polling stations.
108.247	But then the rain stopped,
110.012	people went to vote.
112.246	And when the votes had been counted,
115.396	three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.
122.712	The government and the opposition,
125.062	they have been simply paralyzed.
127.996	Because you know what to do about the protests.
130.113	You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.
132.097	But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?
137.445	So the government decided to have the elections once again.
141.778	And this time even a greater number,
149.511	Basically they went to the ballot boxes
152.262	to tell that they have nobody to vote for.
155.328	This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago
160.36	"called ""Seeing."""
161.843	But in my view it very well captures
164.093	part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.
168.477	On one level nobody's questioning
171.145	that democracy is the best form of government.
175.044	Democracy is the only game in town.
177.78	The problem is that many people start to believe
180.093	that it is not a game worth playing.
182.795	For the last 30 years, political scientists have observed
187.093	that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout,
191.643	and the people who are least interested to vote
195.561	are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.
200.198	I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.
203.623	And this is a major issue.
205.315	Because especially now with the economic crisis,
208.046	you can see that the trust in politics,
210.497	that the trust in democratic institutions,
213.079	was really destroyed.
214.998	According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,
223.496	between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.
229.822	Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks
233.83	believe that their vote matters.
236.98	Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,
241.046	but they cannot change policies.
243.548	And the question which I want to ask is the following:
246.164	How did it happen that we are living in societies
250.08	which are much freer than ever before --
252.63	we have more rights, we can travel easier,
255.314	we have access to more information --
257.663	at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions
261.047	basically has collapsed?
263.63	So basically I want to ask:
265.066	What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years
269.915	when we talk about democracy?
271.716	And I'll start with what went right.
275.599	And the first thing that went right was, of course,
278.661	these five revolutions which, in my view,
281.132	very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.
285.716	And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,
290.941	which put the individual at the center of politics.
293.756	It was the human rights moment.
296.174	Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,
300.024	a culture of basically non-conformism,
303.89	which was not known before.
306.191	So I do believe that even things like that
308.54	are very much the children of '68 --
311.992	nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.
315.407	But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s.
318.456	And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it,
322.09	the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message:
326.707	"""The government does not know better."""
328.384	And you have more choice-driven societies.
331.291	And of course, you have 1989 -- the end of Communism, the end of the Cold War.
337.858	And it was the birth of the global world.
340.158	And you have the Internet.
342.29	And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach
345.257	to what extent the Internet empowered people.
347.674	It has changed the way we are communicating
350.507	and basically we are viewing politics.
352.257	The very idea of political community totally has changed.
355.275	And I'm going to name one more revolution,
357.59	and this is the revolution in brain sciences,
359.423	which totally changed the way
361.324	we understand how people are making decisions.
364.66	So this is what went right.
367.624	But if we're going to see what went wrong,
369.958	we're going to end up with the same five revolutions.
373.39	Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,
376.891	cultural and social revolution,
378.757	which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.
382.324	The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about --
387.16	nation, class, family.
389.957	We start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.
392.441	All this was very much under attack.
395.79	And it is so difficult to engage people in politics
400.141	when they believe that what really matters
402.84	is where they personally stand.
405.009	And you have the market revolution of the 1980s
408.759	and the huge increase of inequality in societies.
414.72	Remember, until the 1970s,
416.626	the spread of democracy has always been accompanied
420.366	by the decline of inequality.
423.826	The more democratic our societies have been,
425.992	the more equal they have been becoming.
430.025	Now we have the reverse tendency.
432.359	The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied
435.059	by the increase in inequality.
436.943	And I find this very much disturbing
440.177	when we're talking about what's going on right and wrong
444.125	with democracy these days.
446.009	And if you go to 1989 --
448.011	something that basically you don't expect that anybody's going to criticize --
451.525	"but many are going to tell you, ""Listen, it was the end of the Cold War"
455.476	"that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe."""
460.776	When the Soviet Union was still there,
462.693	the rich and the powerful, they needed the people,
466.076	because they feared them.
468.359	Now the elites basically have been liberated.
471.66	They're very mobile. You cannot tax them.
473.825	And basically they don't fear the people.
476.159	So as a result of it, you have this very strange situation
479.176	in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters.
483.693	So this is not by accident
485.192	that the voters are not interested to vote anymore.
488.178	And when we talk about the Internet,
490.292	yes, it's true, the Internet connected all of us,
492.793	but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos
499.476	in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.
504.578	And it's becoming more and more difficult
506.51	to understand the people who are not like you.
509.276	I know that many people here
511.144	have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,
515.908	but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?
519.942	This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.
523.793	This is the other side of the things that we like.
526.459	And when you go to the brain sciences,
528.477	what political consultants learned from the brain scientists
532.843	is don't talk to me about ideas anymore,
536.195	don't talk to me about policy programs.
538.46	What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.
544.227	And you have this very strongly
546.294	to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,
550.695	these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.
556.694	Before, revolutions used to have ideological names.
559.16	They could be communist, they could be liberal,
561.093	they could be fascist or Islamic.
562.878	Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used.
567.126	You have Facebook revolutions, Twitter revolutions.
570.26	The content doesn't matter anymore, the problem is the media.
574.66	I'm saying this because one of my major points
577.195	is what went right is also what went wrong.
581.994	And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,
585.727	when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,
588.676	we should keep this ambiguity in mind.
591.243	Because probably some of the things that we love most
594.261	are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.
597.462	These days it's very popular to believe
600.646	that this push for transparency,
602.96	this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies
609.345	and much more transparency-friendly legislation
613.009	can restore trust in politics.
616.077	You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,
619.76	it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,
623.444	it's going to be more difficult for them to steal
625.959	and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.
629.644	This is probably true.
631.66	But I do believe that we should be also very clear
634.71	that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics
639.977	"where the message is, ""It's transparency, stupid."""
643.576	Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.
647.159	Transparency is politics' management of mistrust.
651.878	We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust.
656.41	And by the way, mistrust was always very important for democracy.
659.236	This is why you have checks and balances.
661.376	This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust
665.527	between the representatives and those whom they represent.
668.611	But when politics is only management of mistrust,
673.51	"then -- I'm very glad that ""1984"" has been mentioned --"
676.593	"now we're going to have ""1984"" in reverse."
680.343	It's not going to be the Big Brother watching you,
682.46	it's going to be we being the Big Brother
684.76	watching the political class.
686.51	But is this the idea of a free society?
690.126	For example, can you imagine
691.66	that decent, civic, talented people are going to run for office
697.778	if they really do believe
699.56	that politics is also about managing mistrust?
703.36	Are you not afraid with all these technologies
706.394	that are going to track down
708.394	any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,
712.009	are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians
715.876	to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,
720.51	because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?
724.527	And the Americans who are in the room,
726.209	are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern
729.261	on the basis of what they said in the primary elections?
732.636	I find this extremely important,
734.627	because democracy is about people changing their views
738.659	based on rational arguments and discussions.
741.809	And we can lose this with the very noble idea
745.293	to keep people accountable
747.309	for showing the people that we're not going to tolerate
749.927	politicians the opportunism in politics.
752.645	So for me this is extremely important.
754.977	And I do believe that when we're discussing politics these days,
758.243	probably it makes sense
760.442	to look also at this type of a story.
763.844	But also don't forget, any unveiling is also veiling.
767.394	[Regardless of] how transparent our governments want to be,
771.159	they're going to be selectively transparent.
773.561	In a small country that could be my country,
775.593	but could be also your country,
777.026	they took a decision -- it is a real case story --
779.211	that all of the governmental decisions,
781.826	discussions of the council of ministers,
784.392	were going to be published on the Internet
792.093	And the public was extremely all for it.
794.261	So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,
796.712	why he made this decision.
798.31	"He said, ""Listen, this is the best way"
800.026	to keep the mouths of my ministers closed.
804.654	Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent
807.739	knowing that 24 hours after
809.921	this is going to be on the public space,
811.825	"and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."""
815.771	So when we talk about transparency,
817.238	when we talk about openness,
818.837	I really do believe that what we should keep in mind
820.954	is that what went right is what went wrong.
824.704	And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,
828.888	some centuries ago he said,
831.37	"""There is a big shadow where there is much light."""
834.707	Thank you very much.
836.239	(Applause)
