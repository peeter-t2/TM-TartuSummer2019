12.492	The two most likely largest inventions
17.126	of our generation
19.373	are the Internet and the mobile phone.
22.566	They've changed the world.
24.701	However, largely to our surprise,
28.216	they also turned out to be the perfect tools
32.614	for the surveillance state.
35.764	It turned out that the capability
38.661	to collect data, information and connections
42.705	about basically any of us and all of us
46.923	is exactly what we've been hearing
48.736	throughout of the summer
48.736	through revelations and leaks
53.343	about Western intelligence agencies,
56.434	mostly U.S. intelligence agencies,
59.46	watching over the rest of the world.
62.633	We've heard about these starting with the
65.831	revelations from June 6.
69.517	Edward Snowden started leaking information,
72.586	top secret classified information,
74.89	from the U.S. intelligence agencies,
76.357	and we started learning about things like PRISM
78.826	and XKeyscore and others.
82.093	And these are examples of the kinds of programs
85.198	U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,
89.477	against the whole rest of the world.
92.993	And if you look back about the forecasts
96.701	on surveillance by George Orwell,
100.817	well it turns out that
102.935	George Orwell was an optimist.
105.439	(Laughter)
107.919	We are right now seeing a much larger scale
110.619	of tracking of individual citizens
112.517	than he could have ever imagined.
116.149	And this here is the infamous
119.684	NSA data center in Utah.
123.528	Due to be opened very soon,
126.684	it will be both a supercomputing center
129.475	and a data storage center.
131.612	You could basically imagine it has a large hall
134.505	filled with hard drives storing data
136.961	they are collecting.
139.235	And it's a pretty big building.
141.392	How big? Well, I can give you the numbers --
145.265	but that doesn't really tell you very much.
147.871	Maybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
151.047	You think about the largest IKEA store
153.503	you've ever been in.
155.25	This is five times larger.
158.719	How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
161.795	Right? It's pretty big.
163.802	We estimate that just the electricity bill
166.648	for running this data center
168.524	is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
171.922	And this kind of wholesale surveillance
174.431	means that they can collect our data
177.167	and keep it basically forever,
179.17	keep it for extended periods of time,
181.679	keep it for years, keep it for decades.
184.925	And this opens up completely new kinds of risks
188.304	to us all.
190.25	And what this is is that it is wholesale
193.878	blanket surveillance on everyone.
198.735	Well, not exactly everyone,
200.289	because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right
204.317	to monitor foreigners.
206.287	They can monitor foreigners
208.037	when foreigners' data connections
210.847	end up in the United States or pass
210.847	through the United States.
214.337	And monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad
217.121	until you realize
219.488	that I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
222.489	In fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
226.275	(Laughter)
227.945	Right?
229.832	So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,
234.281	all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
238.383	But don't get me wrong:
240.274	There are actually types
240.274	of surveillance that are okay.
245.5	I love freedom, but even I agree
248.529	that some surveillance is fine.
250.808	If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,
254.711	or they're trying to catch a drug lord
257.813	or trying to prevent a school shooting,
261.417	and they have leads and they have suspects,
263.094	then it's perfectly fine for them
263.094	to tap the suspect's phone,
266.811	and to intercept his Internet communications.
270.167	I'm not arguing that at all,
272.105	but that's not what programs like PRISM are about.
274.929	They are not about doing surveillance on people
277.814	that they have reason
277.814	to suspect of some wrongdoings.
281.018	They're about doing surveillance on people
282.695	they know are innocent.
286.455	So the four main arguments
288.7	supporting surveillance like this,
290.852	well, the first of all is that whenever you start
293.087	discussing about these revelations,
294.982	there will be naysayers trying to minimize
297.275	the importance of these revelations, saying that
299.463	we knew all this already,
301.076	we knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.
304.656	And that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you
307.871	that we knew this already,
307.871	because we did not know this already.
313.583	Our worst fears might have been something like this,
317.356	but we didn't know this was happening.
319.307	Now we know for a fact it's happening.
322.084	We didn't know about this.
322.084	We didn't know about PRISM.
324.663	We didn't know about XKeyscore.
324.663	We didn't know about Cybertrans.
327.569	We didn't know about DoubleArrow.
329.519	We did not know about Skywriter --
331.667	all these different programs
333.362	run by U.S. intelligence agencies.
336.603	But now we do.
339.632	And we did not know
341.798	that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes
344.873	such as infiltrating standardization bodies
348.71	to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
353.458	And what that means
355.495	is that you take something which is secure,
357.315	an encryption algorithm which is so secure
359.736	that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,
362.843	nobody can decrypt that file.
364.585	Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,
368.998	it's going to take millions of years.
371.058	So that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
373.305	You take something which is that good
375.379	and then you weaken it on purpose,
377.863	making all of us less secure as an end result.
383.473	A real-world equivalent would be that
385.604	intelligence agencies would force
388.256	some secret pin code into every single house alarm
391.083	so they could get into every single house
392.876	because, you know, bad people
392.876	might have house alarms,
395.122	but it will also make all of us
397.561	less secure as an end result.
399.79	Backdooring encryption algorithms
403.53	just boggles the mind.
406.626	But of course, these intelligence agencies
406.626	are doing their job.
410.401	This is what they have been told to do:
412.158	do signals intelligence,
414.388	monitor telecommunications,
416.4	monitor Internet traffic.
417.822	That's what they're trying to do,
419.53	and since most, a very big part
419.53	of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,
422.612	they're trying to find ways around the encryption.
424.569	One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,
427.626	which is a great example
429.511	about how U.S. intelligence agencies
431.732	are running loose.
433.481	They are completely out of control,
435.322	and they should be brought back under control.
441.629	So what do we actually know about the leaks?
444.579	Everything is based on the files
446.689	leaked by Mr. Snowden.
449.187	The very first PRISM slides
452.035	from the beginning of June
454.024	detail a collection program where the data
456.118	is collected from service providers,
457.904	and they actually go and name the service providers
460.782	they have access to.
462.113	They even have a specific date
465.055	on when the collection of data began
467.719	for each of the service providers.
469.358	So for example, they name
469.358	the collection from Microsoft
471.645	started on September 11, 2007,
475.365	for Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,
478.097	and then others: Google, Facebook,
481.113	Skype, Apple and so on.
484.357	And every single one of these companies denies.
487.205	They all say that this simply isn't true,
491.6	that they are not giving
491.6	backdoor access to their data.
496.208	Yet we have these files.
500.331	So is one of the parties lying,
502.652	or is there some other alternative explanation?
505.975	And one explanation would be
508.897	that these parties, these service providers,
511.784	are not cooperating.
513.7	Instead, they've been hacked.
516.721	That would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
519.938	In this case, they've been hacked
519.938	by their own government.
524.116	That might sound outlandish,
526.537	but we already have cases where this has happened,
528.751	for example, the case of the Flame malware
531.797	which we strongly believe was authored
533.83	by the U.S. government,
535.727	and which, to spread, subverted the security
539.626	of the Windows Update network,
542.512	meaning here, the company was hacked
546.605	by their own government.
548.963	And there's more evidence
550.562	supporting this theory as well.
553.113	Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information
557.118	about the operations run by the elite hacker units
561.383	operating inside these intelligence agencies.
564.418	Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO,
567.044	Tailored Access Operations,
568.889	and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,
572.453	it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
576.452	And these recent leaks of these three slides
580.296	detail an operation
582.5	run by this GCHQ intelligence agency
585.658	from the United Kingdom
587.467	targeting a telecom here in Belgium.
591.7	And what this really means
593.976	is that an E.U. country's intelligence agency
597.864	is breaching the security
600.079	of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,
604.892	and they discuss it in their slides completely casually,
608.727	business as usual.
610.328	Here's the primary target,
611.996	here's the secondary target,
613.374	here's the teaming.
614.798	They probably have a team building
614.798	on Thursday evening in a pub.
618.654	They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art
621.695	"like, you know, ""Success,"""
623.402	when they gain access to services like this.
626.666	What the hell?
631.685	And then there's the argument
633.518	that okay, yes, this might be going on,
635.178	but then again, other countries are doing it as well.
637.815	All countries spy.
640.238	And maybe that's true.
641.976	Many countries spy, not all of them,
641.976	but let's take an example.
644.414	Let's take, for example, Sweden.
646.525	I'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden
647.901	has a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
650.18	When your data traffic goes through Sweden,
652.303	their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law
655.113	to intercept that traffic.
657.114	All right, how many Swedish decisionmakers
660.319	and politicians and business leaders
663.191	use, every day, U.S.-based services,
666.264	like, you know, run Windows or OSX,
669.532	or use Facebook or LinkedIn,
671.742	or store their data in clouds like iCloud
675.142	or Skydrive or DropBox,
679.036	or maybe use online services like
679.036	Amazon web services or sales support?
683.339	And the answer is, every single Swedish
683.339	business leader does that every single day.
687.296	And then we turn it around.
688.895	How many American leaders
690.8	use Swedish webmails and cloud services?
695.093	And the answer is zero.
697.133	So this is not balanced.
699.402	It's not balanced by any means, not even close.
704.027	And when we do have the occasional
706.468	European success story,
708.469	even those, then, typically end up being sold
708.469	to the United States.
712.035	Like, Skype used to be secure.
714.299	It used to be end-to-end encrypted.
717.032	Then it was sold to the United States.
719.073	Today, it no longer is secure.
721.722	So once again, we take something which is secure
724.943	and then we make it less secure on purpose,
726.813	making all of us less secure as an outcome.
732.855	And then the argument that the United States
735.102	is only fighting terrorists.
737.12	It's the war on terror.
738.286	You shouldn't worry about it.
740.833	Well, it's not the war on terror.
743.063	Yes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,
745.236	there are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,
748.212	and we should fight them,
749.763	but we know through these leaks
751.369	that they have used the same techniques
753.951	to listen to phone calls of European leaders,
757.287	to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,
760.742	to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,
765.548	and I don't think they are trying to find terrorists
768.702	from inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
771.72	It's not the war on terror.
773.668	Part of it might be, and there are terrorists,
777.81	but are we really thinking about terrorists
780.237	as such an existential threat
782.406	that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
786.082	Are the Americans ready
786.082	to throw away the Constituion
789.573	and throw it in the trash
789.573	just because there are terrorists?
793.814	And the same thing with the Bill of Rights
793.814	and all the amendments
796.338	and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
798.655	and the E.U. conventions on human rights
798.655	and fundamental freedoms
803.806	and the press freedom?
805.323	Do we really think terrorism
805.323	is such an existential threat,
809.138	we are ready to do anything at all?
814.49	But people are scared about terrorists,
817.154	and then they think that
817.154	maybe that surveillance is okay
819.568	because they have nothing to hide.
821.612	Feel free to survey me if that helps.
824.319	And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide
827.207	simply hasn't thought about this long enough.
834.52	(Applause)
840.385	Because we have this thing called privacy,
843.157	and if you really think that you have nothing to hide,
845.502	please make sure that's the first thing you tell me,
847.718	because then I know
849.268	that I should not trust you with any secrets,
850.908	because obviously you can't keep a secret.
857.065	But people are brutally honest with the Internet,
860.894	and when these leaks started,
863.59	many people were asking me about this.
865.468	And I have nothing to hide.
867.042	I'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
870.332	Yet, I have nothing that I would in particular
873.117	like to share with an intelligence agency,
875.91	especially a foreign intelligence agency.
880.047	And if we indeed need a Big Brother,
882.902	I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother
886.38	than a foreign Big Brother.
889.545	And when the leaks started,
889.545	the very first thing I tweeted about this
894.604	was a comment about how,
896.678	when you've been using search engines,
898.366	you've been potentially leaking all that
898.366	to U.S. intelligence.
902.015	And two minutes later, I got a reply
903.987	by somebody called Kimberly from the United States
906.323	challenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
908.503	What am I sending to worry about this?
908.503	Am I sending naked pictures or something?
912.535	And my answer to Kimberly was
914.503	that what I'm sending is none of your business,
917.532	and it should be none
917.532	of your government's business either.
921.797	Because that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
924.049	Privacy is nonnegotiable.
925.963	It should be built in to all the systems we use.
931.968	(Applause)
938.83	And one thing we should all understand
941.449	is that we are brutally honest with search engines.
946.048	You show me your search history,
948.799	and I'll find something incriminating
951.165	or something embarrassing there in five minutes.
954.602	We are more honest with search engines
956.39	than we are with our families.
958.152	Search engines know more about you
960.243	than your family members know about you.
963.009	And this is all the kind
963.009	of information we are giving away,
966.097	we are giving away to the United States.
970.472	And surveillance changes history.
972.95	We know this through examples
972.95	of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
976.159	Imagine if he would have had the kind
976.159	of surveillance tools that are available today.
980.631	And let me actually quote
982.94	the president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
986.073	She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.
989.359	Her email was read, and she spoke
991.635	at the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,
994.658	"""If there is no right to privacy,"
996.671	there can be no true freedom
996.671	of expression and opinion,
999.498	"and therefore, there can be no effective democracy."""
1004.609	That's what it's about.
1006.954	Privacy is the building block of our democracies.
1012.611	And to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,
1016.076	he said that the United States
1016.076	is right now treating the Internet
1019.903	as it would be treating one of its colonies.
1022.996	So we are back to the age of colonization,
1025.561	and we, the foreign users of the Internet,
1028.623	we should think about Americans as our masters.
1035.005	So Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
1038.98	Some are blaming him for causing problems
1041.634	for the U.S. cloud industry
1041.634	and software companies with these revelations --
1044.825	and blaming Snowden for causing problems
1044.825	for the U.S. cloud industry
1049.121	would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore
1051.58	for causing global warming.
1053.897	(Laughter)
1056.151	(Applause)
1063.853	So, what is there to be done?
1070.061	Should we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.
1071.841	We should be angry, because this is wrong,
1074.277	and it's rude, and it should not be done.
1077.016	But that's not going to really change the situation.
1079.284	What's going to change the situation
1079.284	for the rest of the world
1082.505	is to try to steer away
1084.787	from systems built in the United States.
1087.42	And that's much easier said than done.
1090.05	How do you do that?
1091.759	A single country, any single country in Europe
1093.558	cannot replace and build replacements
1096.351	for the U.S.-made operating systems
1096.351	and cloud services.
1099.113	But maybe you don't have to do it alone.
1101.006	Maybe you can do it together with other countries.
1102.775	The solution is open source.
1106.271	By building together open, free, secure systems,
1111.884	we can go around such surveillance,
1114.992	and then one country doesn't have
1114.992	to solve the problem by itself.
1118.215	It only has to solve one little problem.
1120.687	And to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,
1126.21	one country only has to make a small wave,
1129.179	but those small waves together become a tide,
1132.646	and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,
1136.266	and the tide we will build
1137.917	with secure, free, open-source systems,
1141.358	will become the tide that will lift all of us
1143.757	up and above the surveillance state.
1149.339	Thank you very much.
1151.451	(Applause)
