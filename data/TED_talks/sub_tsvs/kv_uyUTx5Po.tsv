12.562	Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,
15.623	and we both study complex networks.
17.731	And we met a couple years ago when we discovered
19.566	that we had both given a short TED Talk
21.566	about the ecology of war,
23.869	and we realized that we were connected
25.316	by the ideas we shared before we ever met.
28.134	And then we thought, you know, there are thousands
29.69	of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,
31.804	that are popping up all over the world.
34.015	How are they connected,
34.938	and what does that global conversation look like?
36.948	So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.
39.758	Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks
43.525	from around the world, 147 different countries,
46.571	and we took these talks and we wanted to find
48.694	the mathematical structures that underly
50.734	the ideas behind them.
52.456	And we wanted to do that so we could see how
53.826	they connected with each other.
55.879	And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,
57.555	you need a lot of data.
58.511	So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,
62.197	and we can go down and basically pull
63.965	all the open information from YouTube,
66.232	all the comments, all the views, who's watching it,
68.581	where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.
71.36	But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,
74.652	we can pull the entire transcript,
76.78	and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.
79.46	So we can take their transcript
81.566	and actually do some pretty cool things.
83.664	We can take natural language processing algorithms
85.824	to kind of read through with a computer, line by line,
88.453	extracting key concepts from this.
90.812	And we take those key concepts and they sort of form
93.337	this mathematical structure of an idea.
96.902	And we call that the meme-ome.
98.659	And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,
100.81	is the mathematics that underlies an idea,
103.236	and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,
105.168	which I want to share with you now.
107.149	So each idea has its own meme-ome,
109.339	and each idea is unique with that,
111.29	but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,
113.778	they kind of steal sometimes,
114.962	and they certainly build on each other,
116.789	and we can go through mathematically
118.405	and take the meme-ome from one talk
120.245	and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,
122.699	and if there's a similarity between the two of them,
124.672	we can create a link and represent that as a graph,
127.922	just like Eric and I are connected.
130.316	So that's theory, that's great.
131.71	Let's see how it works in actual practice.
134.236	So what we've got here now is the global footprint
137.024	of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years
139.317	exploding out around the world
140.867	from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.
144.196	And what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,
148.031	and we started to see where the connections occurred,
150.565	where they connected with each other.
152.102	Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty
153.976	connected over into Europe.
155.551	We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine
157.963	radiating outwards from the Middle East.
160.218	And we've got something a little broader
161.516	like big data with a truly global footprint
163.672	reminiscent of a conversation
165.851	that is happening everywhere.
167.867	So from this, we kind of run up against the limits
170.04	of what we can actually do with a geographic projection,
172.57	but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out
174.622	into multidimensional space.
176.168	So we can take in our network projection
178.043	and apply a physics engine to this,
179.793	and the similar talks kind of smash together,
181.678	and the different ones fly apart,
183.682	and what we're left with is something quite beautiful.
185.754	EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,
188.711	they're linked if they share similar ideas,
191.3	and that comes from a machine reading
193.384	of entire talk transcripts,
195.451	and then all these topics that pop out,
197.682	they're not from tags and keywords.
199.472	They come from the network structure
201.197	of interconnected ideas. Keep going.
203.365	SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,
205.387	but he's going to slow me down.
206.862	We've got education connected to storytelling
208.896	triangulated next to social media.
210.539	You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,
213.014	which you might expect,
214.4	but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,
216.795	as those two spaces interface with each other.
219.535	But I want to take you into one cluster
221.07	that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.
223.938	And I want to kind of zoom in on that
225.431	and see if we can get a little more resolution.
227.794	So as we go in here, what we start to see,
230.141	apply the physics engine again,
231.645	we see what's one conversation
233.321	is actually composed of many smaller ones.
235.881	The structure starts to emerge
237.81	where we see a kind of fractal behavior
239.88	of the words and the language that we use
241.499	to describe the things that are important to us
243.201	all around this world.
244.634	So you've got food economy and local food at the top,
246.966	you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.
249.685	What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,
252.316	each connected to each other through the ideas
254.617	and the language they share,
255.918	creating a broader concept of the environment.
258.368	And of course, from here, we can go
259.9	and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?
263.434	And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.
265.779	This is their kind of resonance
267.453	for the conversation around the environment.
269.859	If we split along gender lines,
271.758	we can see females resonating heavily
273.745	with food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.
277.39	And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,
279.872	and I'll throw to Eric for the next part.
281.634	EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,
283.236	you cannot get this kind of perspective
284.774	from a simple tag search on YouTube.
288.134	Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation
292.322	out of environment, and look at all the talks together.
294.856	Now often, when we're faced with this amount of content,
297.783	we do a couple of things to simplify it.
300.214	We might just say, well,
301.528	what are the most popular talks out there?
304.357	And a few rise to the surface.
305.754	There's a talk about gratitude.
307.582	There's another one about personal health and nutrition.
310.926	And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?
313.855	And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.
317.089	What's trending now? What's the popular talk now?
319.611	And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic
322.932	is about digital privacy.
325.598	So this is great. It simplifies things.
327.291	But there's so much creative content
329.118	that's just buried at the bottom.
331.039	And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface
334.357	that's maybe really creative and interesting?
336.815	Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas
339.746	to do that.
341.176	Remember, it's that network structure
343.29	that is creating these emergent topics,
345.558	and let's say we could take two of them,
347.073	like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks
350.12	that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.
352.689	And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix
354.964	is one of the hallmarks of innovation.
356.804	Well here's one by Jessica Green
358.41	about the microbial ecology of buildings.
360.789	It's literally defining a new field.
362.799	And we could go back to those topics and say, well,
364.902	what talks are central to those conversations?
367.67	In the cities cluster, one of the most central
369.36	was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,
373.312	and in the genetics cluster,
375.032	we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.
378.225	These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.
381.578	We could go the other direction and say, well,
383.421	what are talks that are broadly synthesizing
385.693	a lot of different kinds of fields.
387.141	We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.
389.674	Like, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,
392.41	very synthetic.
393.59	And then, of course, there are talks that are so unique
395.668	they're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,
398.758	and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.
401.272	And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,
404.306	"and I asked her, ""Well, what's it like out there"
405.849	"in the stratosphere of our idea space?"""
407.521	And apparently it smells like bacon.
410.776	I wouldn't know.
412.567	So we're using these network motifs
414.815	to find talks that are unique,
416.001	ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,
418.711	ones that are central to their topic,
420.37	and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.
423.744	Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession
425.846	with what's trending now.
428.159	And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,
431.045	or the patterns of how things are connected.
434.005	SG: So that's exactly right.
435.63	We've got ourselves in a world
438.109	that's massively complex,
440.153	and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down
443.02	so we can navigate through it.
444.806	And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,
447.144	are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,
450.62	because we can realize that their complexity is not random.
453.186	It has mathematical structure,
455.14	and we can use that mathematical structure
456.943	to go and explore things like the world of ideas
459.157	to see what's being said, to see what's not being said,
462.157	and to be a little bit more human
463.564	and, hopefully, a little smarter.
465.431	Thank you.
466.397	(Applause)
