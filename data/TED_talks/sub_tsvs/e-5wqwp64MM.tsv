12.769	I want you guys to imagine 
12.769	that you're a soldier
15.327	running through the battlefield.
17.228	Now, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,
19.444	which severs your femoral artery.
21.671	Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic
23.797	and can kill you in less 
23.797	than three minutes.
26.532	Unfortunately, by the time that a medic
28.6	actually gets to you,
30.276	what the medic has on his or her belt
32.527	can take five minutes or more,
34.787	with the application of pressure,
34.787	to stop that type of bleed.
37.951	Now, this problem is 
37.951	not only a huge problem
40.204	for the military, but it's 
40.204	also a huge problem
42.893	that's epidemic throughout 
42.893	the entire medical field,
45.875	which is how do we actually look at wounds
48.506	and how do we stop them quickly
50.307	in a way that can work with the body?
52.668	So now, what I've been working
52.668	on for the last four years
55.481	is to develop smart biomaterials,
58.476	which are actually materials that will work
60.453	with the body, helping it to heal
62.635	and helping it to allow the 
62.635	wounds to heal normally.
66.995	So now, before we do this, we 
66.995	have to take a much closer look
70.585	at actually how does the body work.
72.743	So now, everybody here knows
74.133	that the body is made up of cells.
76.23	So the cell is the most basic unit of life.
78.947	But not many people know what else.
81.411	But it actually turns out that your cells
83.942	sit in this mesh of complicated fibers,
86.686	proteins and sugars
88.319	known as the extracellular matrix.
90.331	So now, the ECM
92.16	is actually this mesh that 
92.16	holds the cells in place,
95.19	provides structure for your tissues,
97.03	but it also gives the cells a home.
99.476	It allows them to feel what they're doing,
101.603	where they are, and tells them
103.188	how to act and how to behave.
105.528	And it actually turns out that 
105.528	the extracellular matrix
108.46	is different from every 
108.46	single part of the body.
111.423	So the ECM in my skin
112.84	is different than the ECM in my liver,
114.955	and the ECM in different 
114.955	parts of the same organ
117.733	actually vary, so it's very difficult
119.941	to be able to have a product
121.718	that will react to the 
121.718	local extracellular matrix,
124.125	which is exactly what we're trying to do.
126.218	So now, for example, 
126.218	think of the rainforest.
128.94	You have the canopy, 
128.94	you have the understory,
131.325	and you have the forest floor.
132.9	Now, all of these parts of the forest
134.685	are made up of different plants,
136.451	and different animals call them home.
138.869	So just like that, the extracellular matrix
141.18	is incredibly diverse in three dimensions.
143.972	On top of that, the extracellular matrix
146.889	is responsible for all wound healing,
149.42	so if you imagine cutting the body,
151.175	you actually have to rebuild
153.2	this very complex ECM
155.157	in order to get it to form again,
157.2	and a scar, in fact, is actually
158.779	poorly formed extracellular matrix.
162.233	So now, behind me is an animation
164.291	of the extracellular matrix.
165.899	So as you see, your cells sit 
165.899	in this complicated mesh
168.555	and as you move throughout the tissue,
171.187	the extracellular matrix changes.
173.268	So now every other piece 
173.268	of technology on the market
176.075	can only manage a two-
176.075	dimensional approximation
179.151	of the extracellular matrix,
180.906	which means that it doesn't fit in
182.694	with the tissue itself.
184.46	So when I was a freshman at NYU,
186.26	what I discovered was 
186.26	you could actually take
188.464	small pieces of plant-derived polymers
190.985	and reassemble them onto the wound.
193.639	So if you have a bleeding 
193.639	wound like the one behind me,
196.297	you can actually put 
196.297	our material onto this,
198.87	and just like Lego blocks,
200.81	it'll reassemble into the local tissue.
202.993	So that means if you put it onto liver,
204.859	it turns into something 
204.859	that looks like liver,
206.61	and if you put it onto skin,
208.133	it turns into something 
208.133	that looks just like skin.
210.236	So when you put the gel on,
211.616	it actually reassembles 
211.616	into this local tissue.
214.927	So now, this has a whole 
214.927	bunch of applications,
218.533	but basically the idea is,
218.533	wherever you put this product,
221.485	you're able to reassemble 
221.485	into it immediately.
224.32	Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed —
226.681	blood warning —
228.04	at twice human artery pressure.
229.84	So now, this type of bleed 
229.84	is incredibly traumatic,
232.273	and like I said before, 
232.273	would actually take
234.5	five minutes or more with pressure
236.356	to be able to stop.
237.728	Now, in the time that it takes
237.728	me to introduce the bleed itself,
240.749	our material is able to stop that bleed,
242.878	and it's because it actually 
242.878	goes on and works
245.154	with the body to heal,
246.886	so it reassembles into this piece of meat,
249.258	and then the blood actually recognizes
252.138	that that's happening, 
252.138	and produces fibrin,
254.725	producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.
258.47	So now this technology — Thank you.
260.349	(Applause)
268.606	So now this technology, by January,
268.606	will be in the hands of veterinarians,
272.188	and we're working very diligently to 
272.188	try to get it into the hands of doctors,
275.765	hopefully within the next year.
277.53	But really, once again, I 
277.53	want you guys to imagine
280.137	that you are a soldier running 
280.137	through a battlefield.
282.16	Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,
283.927	and instead of bleeding 
283.927	out in three minutes,
287.26	you pull a small pack 
287.26	of gel out of your belt,
289.248	and with the press of a button,
290.575	you're able to stop your own bleed
291.984	and you're on your way to recovery.
293.893	Thank you very much.
295.783	(Applause)
