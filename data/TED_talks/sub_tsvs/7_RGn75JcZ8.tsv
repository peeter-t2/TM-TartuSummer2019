12.82	Twenty-eight years ago,
12.82	I was a broken man.
16.58	And you probably wouldn't be able
16.58	to tell that if you met me.
20.06	I had a good job at a well-respected
20.06	academic institution.
24.66	I dressed well, of course.
27.58	But my insides were rotting away.
30.46	You see, I grew up in a family
30.46	riddled with addiction,
34.46	and as a kid, I also struggled
35.944	with coming to terms
35.944	with my own sexuality.
38.74	And even though I couldn't name it then,
41.1	growing up as a gay kid
43.14	just compounded my issues
43.14	of isolation and insecurities.
48.34	But drinking took all of that away.
52.66	Like many, I drank at an early age.
56.66	I continued to drink
56.66	my way through college.
59.66	And when I finally did come out
59.66	in the early 1980s,
62.5	about the only places
62.5	to meet other gay people,
65.34	to socialize,
67.34	to be yourself, were gay bars.
70.18	And what do you do in gay bars?
72.3	You drink.
73.9	And I did --
75.54	a lot.
77.58	My story is not unique.
79.78	Like millions of Americans,
79.78	my disease progressed undiagnosed.
84.22	It took me to people
84.22	and places and things
86.22	that I never would have chosen.
89.02	It wasn't until
89.02	an intersection with the law
91.86	"gave me an ""opportunity"" to get care,"
95.7	that I began my journey of recovery.
98.82	My journey of recovery
98.82	has been filled with love and with joy,
103.78	but it hasn't been without pain.
105.78	Like many of you, I've lost too many
105.78	friends and family to this disease.
109.78	I've heard too many
109.78	heartbreaking stories
111.74	of people who've lost
111.74	loved ones to addiction.
114.58	And I've also lost
114.58	countless friends to HIV and AIDS.
118.98	Our current opioid epidemic
118.98	and the AIDS epidemic
122.54	tragically have much in common.
125.86	Right now, we are in the midst of one
125.86	of the greatest health crises of our time.
131.1	During 2014 alone, 28,000 people
135.46	died of drug overdoses associated
135.46	with prescription drugs and heroin.
141.98	During the 1980s, scores of people
141.98	were dying from HIV and AIDS.
147.62	Public officials ignored it.
150.34	Some wouldn't even utter the words.
153.62	They didn't want treatment.
156.1	And tragically, there are many parallels
156.1	with our current epidemic.
160.54	Some called it the gay plague.
163.34	They called for quarantines.
166.26	They wanted to separate
166.26	the innocent victims from the rest of us.
171.94	I was afraid we were losing this battle
174.3	because people were
174.3	blaming us for being sick.
178.62	Public policy was being held hostage
178.62	by stigma and fear,
183.7	and also held hostage
184.98	were compassion, care,
184.98	research, recovery and treatment.
191.46	But we changed all that.
194.3	Because out of the pain of those deaths,
196.9	we saw a social and political movement.
200.62	AIDS galvanized us into action;
204.74	to stand up, to speak up and to act out.
210.02	And it also galvanized
210.02	the LGBT movement.
214.34	We knew we were
214.34	in a battle for our lives
216.3	because silence equaled death,
218.78	but we changed,
218.78	and we made things happen.
222.58	And right now, we have the potential
224.9	to see the end of HIV/AIDS
224.9	in our lifetime.
230.3	These changes came in no small part
233.14	by the courageous, yet simple decision
236.98	for people to come out
239.26	to their neighbors,
239.26	to their friends, to their families
245.3	and to their coworkers.
248.38	Years ago, I was a volunteer
248.38	for the Names Project.
252.02	This was an effort started
252.02	by Cleve Jones in San Francisco
255.42	to show that people who died of AIDS
257.42	had names
259.38	and faces and families
263.14	and people who loved them.
266.94	I still recall unfolding
266.94	the AIDS memorial quilt
272.74	on the National Mall
272.74	on a brilliant day in October, 1988.
283.26	So fast forward to 2015.
286.3	The Supreme Court's decision to strike
286.3	down the ban on same-sex marriage.
291.58	My husband, Dave, and I walk over
291.58	to the steps of the Supreme Court
294.78	to celebrate that decision
294.78	with so many other people,
297.74	and I couldn't help but think
297.74	how far we came around LGBT rights
303.14	and yet how far we needed to go
303.14	around issues of addiction.
309.94	When I was nominated
309.94	by President Obama
311.82	to be his Director of Drug Policy,
314.02	I was very open about my recovery
314.02	and about the fact that I was a gay man.
318.54	And at no point during
318.54	my confirmation process --
320.9	at least that I know of --
322.46	did the fact that I was a gay man
322.46	come to bear on my candidacy
326.46	or my fitness to do this job.
329.58	But my addiction did.
332.5	At one point, a congressional staffer
332.5	said that there was no way
335.98	that I was going to be confirmed
335.98	by the United States Senate
338.86	because of my past,
340.46	despite the fact that I had been
340.46	in recovery for over 20 years,
343.9	and despite the fact
345.14	that this job takes a little bit
345.14	of knowledge around addiction.
348.14	(Laughter)
351.46	So, you know, this is the stigma
354.42	that people with
354.42	substance use disorders
356.5	face every single day,
358.7	and you know, I have to tell you
360.3	it's still why I'm more comfortable
360.3	coming out as a gay man
363.78	than I am as a person
363.78	with a history of addiction.
367.46	Nearly every family in America
367.46	is affected by addiction.
371.58	Yet, unfortunately, too often,
371.58	it's not talked about openly and honestly.
377.98	It's whispered about.
379.66	It's met with derision and scorn.
383.14	We hear these stories,
383.14	time and time again, on TV, online,
388.58	we hear it from public officials,
388.58	and we hear it from family and friends.
393.54	And those of us with an addiction,
393.54	we hear those voices,
397.38	and somehow we believe that we are
397.38	less deserving of care and treatment.
402.86	Today in the United States,
402.86	only one in nine people
406.26	get care and treatment for their disorder.
408.82	One in nine.
410.42	Think about that.
412.42	Generally, people with other diseases
412.42	get care and treatment.
415.5	If you have cancer, you get treatment,
417.5	if you have diabetes, you get treatment.
419.54	If you have a heart attack,
420.9	you get emergency services,
420.9	and you get referred to care.
425.02	But somehow people with addiction
425.02	have to wait for treatment
428.26	or often can't get when they need it.
431.62	And left untreated, addiction
431.62	has significant, dire consequences.
436.18	And for many people
436.18	that means death or incarceration.
440.82	We've been down that road before.
443.22	For too long our country felt
444.66	like we could arrest our way
444.66	out of this problem.
447.7	But we know that we can't.
450.5	Decades of scientific research has shown
452.9	that this is a medical issue --
455.06	that this is a chronic medical condition
457.66	that people inherit
457.66	and that people develop.
461.82	So the Obama administration
461.82	has taken a different tack on drug policy.
466.38	We've developed and implemented
466.38	a comprehensive plan
469.34	to expand prevention services,
469.34	treatment services,
472.74	early intervention and recovery support.
476.62	We've pushed criminal justice reform.
479.46	We've knocked down barriers
479.46	to give people second chances.
482.7	We see public health and public safety
482.7	officials working hand in hand
486.14	at the community level.
488.3	We see police chiefs across the country
488.3	guiding people to treatment
491.5	instead of jail and incarceration.
494.22	We see law enforcement
494.22	and other first responders
497.14	reversing overdoses with naloxone
497.14	to give people a second chance for care.
503.46	The Affordable Care Act
503.46	is the biggest expansion
506.14	of substance use disorder
506.14	treatment in a generation,
509.42	and it also calls for the integration
509.42	of treatment services within primary care.
516.1	But fundamentally,
516.1	all of this work is not enough.
520.66	Unless we change the way
520.66	that we view people with addiction
524.7	in the United States.
527.22	Years ago when I finally
527.22	understood that I had a problem
530.82	and I knew that I needed help,
532.979	I was too afraid to ask for it.
536.14	I felt that people would think
536.14	I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,
541.34	that I was morally flawed.
545.7	But I talk about my recovery
545.7	because I want to make change.
550.06	I want us to see that we need to be open
550.06	and candid about who we are
556.02	and what we can do.
558.14	I am public about my own recovery
560.54	not to be self-congratulatory.
563.26	I am open about my own recovery
563.26	to change public opinion,
567.14	to change public policy
569.06	and to change the course of this epidemic
569.06	and empower the millions of Americans
572.98	who struggle with this journey
574.86	to be open and candid
574.86	about who they are.
578.46	People are more than their disease.
581.7	And all of us have the opportunity
581.7	to change public opinion
585.02	and to change public policy.
587.82	All of us know someone
587.82	who has an addiction,
591.1	and all of us can do our part
593.06	to change how we view people
593.06	with addiction in the United States.
598.22	So when you see
598.22	someone with an addiction,
600.66	don't think of a drunk or a junkie
600.66	or an addict or an abuser --
607.5	see a person;
609.86	offer them help;
611.38	give them kindness and compassion.
614.18	And together, we can be part
616.42	of a growing movement
616.42	in the United States
618.5	to change how we view
618.5	people with addiction.
621.3	Together we can change public policy.
624.26	We can ensure that people
624.26	get care when they need it,
628.18	just like any other disease.
630.86	We can be part of a growing,
630.86	unstoppable movement
634.58	to have millions of Americans
634.58	enter recovery,
637.62	and put an end to this epidemic.
639.74	Thank you very much.
640.98	(Applause)
