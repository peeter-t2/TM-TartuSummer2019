15.997	Human beings start putting each other into boxes
18.426	the second that they see each other --
20.243	Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?
23.313	Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?
26.579	We do this little interrogation when we meet people
29.113	to make a mental resume for them.
31.28	What's your name? Where are you from?
32.797	How old are you? What do you do?
36.158	Then we get more personal with it.
38.959	Have you ever had any diseases?
42.107	Have you ever been divorced?
44.094	Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?
47.54	What are you into? Who are you into?
49.257	What gender do you like to sleep with?
51.123	I get it.
53.553	We are neurologically hardwired
55.305	to seek out people like ourselves.
57.689	We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough
59.874	to know what acceptance feels like.
61.807	We bond together based on anything that we can --
64.157	music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
69.609	We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.
76.497	"Sometimes, though, just the question ""what do you do?"""
78.958	can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box
80.918	and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
82.447	Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting.
86.014	The boxes are too narrow.
87.898	And this can get really dangerous.
90.015	So here's a disclaimer about me, though,
91.796	before we get too deep into this.
93.398	I grew up in a very sheltered environment.
96.383	I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,
100.329	two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.
104.224	I was shielded from the pains of bigotry
106.314	and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.
110.414	Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker
113.835	or a performance artist of some kind,
115.963	you were the weirdo.
117.947	(Laughter)
119.23	It was an unorthodox upbringing,
121.315	but as a kid on the streets of New York,
123.826	you learn how to trust your own instincts,
125.797	you learn how to go with your own ideas.
128.73	So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
131.969	I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them.
135.436	They said they wouldn't let girls play.
136.869	So I went home, and I shaved my head,
138.279	"and I came back the next day and I said, ""I'm a boy."""
140.901	I mean, who knows, right?
141.915	When you're six, maybe you can do that.
145.728	I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't.
149.361	I kept up the charade for eight years.
152.003	So this is me when I was 11.
156.17	I was playing a kid named Walter
157.681	"in a movie called ""Julian Po."""
159.87	I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
163.304	See, I was also a child actor,
165.354	which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,
168.036	because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.
174.124	In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl --
177.24	not my teachers at school, not my friends,
179.556	not the directors that I worked with.
181.408	Kids would often come up to me in class
183.673	and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple
185.907	or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.
189.256	When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls
191.617	so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.
194.172	At sleepovers I would have panic attacks
196.24	trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me
198.624	without outing myself.
200.356	It's worth mentioning though
202.408	that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia.
206.257	I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body.
208.024	I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.
210.056	I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
213.883	If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,
216.129	they probably would have diagnosed me
217.852	as something like gender dysmorphic
219.638	and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
222.041	But in my particular case,
222.925	I just woke up one day when I was 14,
224.64	and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
227.223	Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,
230.223	and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.
233.848	When a kid behaves like I did,
236.253	they don't exactly have to come out, right?
238.089	No one is exactly shocked.
240.35	(Laughter)
244.094	But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents.
248.557	When I was 15, and I called my father
250.423	to tell him that I had fallen in love,
252.123	it was the last thing on either of our minds
254.423	to discuss what the consequences were
256.039	of the fact that my first love was a girl.
258.457	Three years later, when I fell in love with a man,
260.739	neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.
263.323	See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood
266.706	that I wasn't ever asked to define myself
268.74	as any one thing at any point.
271.087	I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.
274.906	So four, almost five years ago,
277.951	Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,
281.266	was raising a lot of dust around this country.
283.241	And at the time, getting married wasn't really something
285.852	I spent a lot of time thinking about.
286.985	But I was struck by the fact that America,
289.791	a country with such a tarnished civil rights record,
291.856	could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.
294.472	And I remember watching the discussion on television
296.44	and thinking how interesting it was
298.241	that the separation of church and state
301.272	was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,
304.891	between places where people believed in it
306.473	and places where people didn't.
308.258	And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.
314.506	If this was a war with two disparate sides,
317.624	I, by default, fell on team gay,
320.405	because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight.
323.591	At the time I was just beginning to emerge
326.84	from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag
330.757	that saw me go from being a boy
332.59	to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes
335.812	to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,
338.602	over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl
341.268	to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,
345.236	a tomboyish girl
347.643	who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.
350.852	I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,
356.003	who fell kind of between-the-lines --
357.669	girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,
361.206	girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish,
365.164	girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,
368.159	girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls
371.257	who all hated being boxed in to anything.
373.106	I loved these people, and I admired their freedom,
376.857	but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble
379.79	exploded into these raging debates
381.64	where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.
387.206	And this powerful awareness rolled in over me
389.539	that I was a minority, and in my own home country,
394.906	based on one facet of my character.
397.557	I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.
403.172	I was not an activist.
404.706	I wave no flags in my own life.
407.206	But I was plagued by this question:
409.345	How could anyone vote to strip the rights
412.291	of the vast variety of people that I knew
414.456	based on one element of their character?
417.89	How could they say that we as a group
419.406	were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?
422.339	Were we even a group? What group?
424.706	And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
428.573	Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?
432.616	And then it occurred to me,
434.507	perhaps if they could look into the eyes
436.79	of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship
440.571	it might make it harder for them to do.
442.473	It might give them pause.
444.457	Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party,
450.297	so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically
454.628	without any artifice, without any lighting,
457.594	or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
460.828	Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers
463.578	without the fear of him ripping your face off.
466.294	For me, photography is not just about exposing film,
469.691	it's about exposing the viewer
471.644	to something new, a place they haven't gone before,
473.745	but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.
477.06	Life magazine introduced generations of people
478.904	to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.
482.978	So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,
489.211	mugshots if you will.
490.961	And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country
494.729	that was not 100 percent straight,
497.13	which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people.
500.313	(Laughter)
502.363	So this was a very large undertaking,
505.029	and to do it we needed some help.
506.913	So I ran out in the freezing cold,
509.446	and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to
512.854	in February of about two years ago.
516.824	And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help.
520.947	And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York.
523.313	And then we made this.
526.324	(Music)
538.601	Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City.
542.784	(Music)
556.092	Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today.
560.754	My aim is to take a simple portrait
562.377	of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight
565.027	or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way.
570.247	My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us
573.245	through the simplicity of a face.
575.363	(Music)
578.051	"""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."""
581.141	It's written in the Declaration of Independence.
583.558	We are failing as a nation
584.825	to uphold the morals upon which we were founded.
586.934	There is no equality in the United States.
589.156	"[""What does equality mean to you?""]"
591.539	"[""Marriage""] [""Freedom""] [""Civil rights""]"
593.177	"[""Treat every person as you'd treat yourself""]"
595.303	It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that.
598.923	The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage.
601.713	Today in 29 states, more than half of this country,
605.809	you can legally be fired just for your sexuality.
610.18	"[""Who is responsible for equality?""]"
613.331	I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer:
616.342	"""We are all responsible for equality."""
619.818	So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City.
622.671	And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it
624.087	without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign.
626.972	I want to take the project across the country.
628.921	I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people.
633.004	This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation.
636.987	I challenge you to look into the faces of these people
639.164	and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being.
642.026	(Music)
644.066	"[""Self evident truths""]"
646.348	"[""4,000 faces across America""]"
648.013	(Music)
652.569	(Applause)
660.817	iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that.
665.1	Almost 85,000 people watched that video,
668.35	and then they started emailing us from all over the country,
670.85	asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces.
675.517	And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated.
679.867	So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces.
683.368	That video was made in the spring of 2011,
687.433	and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities
690.89	and photographed almost 2,000 people.
693.796	I know that this is a talk,
696.806	but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet
700.072	and have you just look at these faces
701.321	because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them.
705.191	Because if a picture is worth a thousand words,
707.724	then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary.
732.329	So after traveling and talking to people
736.008	in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,
739.856	we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on.
743.391	Visibility really is key.
745.277	Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.
748.54	Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,
751.99	you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it
754.907	or explore a new perspective on it.
756.473	Of course, in my travels I met people
759.124	who legally divorced their children for being other than straight,
763.323	but I also met people who were Southern Baptists
765.691	who switched churches because their child was a lesbian.
768.707	Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths.
772.857	But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting:
776.273	Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us.
780.623	In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them.
784.007	It presents, not just the complexities
786.106	found in a procession of different human beings,
788.273	but the complexities found within each individual person.
791.873	It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few.
802.778	"At some point I realized that my mission to photograph ""gays"" was inherently flawed,"
809.563	because there were a million different shades of gay.
812.751	Here I was trying to help,
815.497	and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid --
818.69	yet another box.
821.196	At some point I added a question to the release form
824.416	that asked people to quantify themselves
826.345	on a scale of one to 100 percent gay.
829.145	And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me.
833.061	(Laughter)
835.862	People didn't know what to do
837.062	because they had never been presented with the option before.
839.465	Can you quantify your openness?
841.652	Once they got over the shock, though,
843.562	by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent
847.645	or the 3 to 20 percent marks.
850.162	Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,
852.863	but I found that a much larger proportion of people
855.331	identified as something that was much more nuanced.
858.18	"I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as ""Grey."""
864.389	Let me be clear though -- and this is very important --
868.373	in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist.
873.089	And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,
877.889	because if any of you happen to be of the belief
880.756	that sexual orientation is a choice,
882.623	I invite you to go out and try to be grey.
884.156	I'll take your picture just for trying.
886.422	(Laughter)
887.805	What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.
892.222	The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:
897.99	If you have gay people over here
900.207	and you have straight people over here,
903.855	and while we recognize that most people identify
906.823	as somewhere closer to one binary or another,
909.526	there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.
914.472	And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
917.506	Because, for example, if you pass a law
919.79	that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,
923.293	where exactly do you draw the line?
926.06	Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?
931.926	Or is it over here
933.227	by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?
937.326	Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?
941.976	Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels
946.792	is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.
951.094	After traveling so much and meeting so many people,
953.705	let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts
957.21	and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens
960.159	and every other polarization you can possibly think of
963.109	within the LGBT community
965.243	as there are within the human race.
968.759	Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,
973.377	and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,
977.042	just being other than straight
978.443	doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common.
983.459	So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,
991.86	as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,
995.059	bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,
1000.518	perhaps in watching this procession of humanity,
1003.593	something interesting and useful will begin to happen.
1006.51	Hopefully these categories, these binaries,
1010.227	these over-simplified boxes
1011.976	will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away.
1017.042	Because really, they describe nothing that we see
1020.46	and no one that we know and nothing that we are.
1023.809	What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.
1029.41	And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.
1032.993	At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.
1037.334	So is it me particularly
1040.893	that you would choose to deny the right to housing,
1044.395	the right to adopt children, the right to marriage,
1047.376	the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?
1051.009	Am I the one that you choose to disown
1053.088	as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,
1057.51	your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,
1059.858	your police woman or the fireman?
1063.308	It's too late.
1066.326	Because I already am all of those things.
1069.627	We already are all of those things, and we always have been.
1073.992	So please don't greet us as strangers,
1076.798	greet us as your fellow human beings, period.
1080.351	Thank you.
1081.667	(Applause)
