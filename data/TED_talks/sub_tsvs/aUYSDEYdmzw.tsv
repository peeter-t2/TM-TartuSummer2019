13.636	What makes a great leader today?
17.231	Many of us carry this image
19.874	of this all-knowing superhero
23.194	who stands and commands
25.642	and protects his followers.
29.271	But that's kind of an image from another time,
33.567	and what's also outdated
35.818	are the leadership development programs
38.22	that are based on success models
40.603	for a world that was, not a world that is
44.785	or that is coming.
46.949	We conducted a study of 4,000 companies,
51.36	and we asked them, let's see the effectiveness
54.367	of your leadership development programs.
56.958	Fifty-eight percent of the companies
59.146	cited significant talent gaps
61.514	for critical leadership roles.
63.869	That means that despite
63.869	corporate training programs,
67.308	off-sites, assessments, coaching, all of these things,
71.745	more than half the companies
73.686	had failed to grow enough great leaders.
78.543	You may be asking yourself,
80.566	is my company helping me to prepare
83.297	to be a great 21st-century leader?
86.54	The odds are, probably not.
89.952	Now, I've spent 25 years of my professional life
94.015	observing what makes great leaders.
97.52	I've worked inside Fortune 500 companies,
99.985	I've advised over 200 CEOs,
102.054	and I've cultivated more leadership pipelines
104.813	than you can imagine.
107.823	But a few years ago, I noticed a disturbing trend
111.548	in leadership preparation.
114.763	I noticed that, despite all the efforts,
118.589	there were familiar stories that kept resurfacing
121.128	about individuals.
123.252	One story was about Chris,
126.886	a high-potential, superstar leader
129.23	who moves to a new unit and fails,
132.832	destroying unrecoverable value.
135.568	And then there were stories like Sidney, the CEO,
139.161	who was so frustrated
140.863	because her company is cited
142.93	as a best company for leaders,
145.259	but only one of the top 50 leaders is equipped
149.096	to lead their crucial initiatives.
151.681	And then there were stories
153.638	like the senior leadership team
156.168	of a once-thriving business
158.248	that's surprised by a market shift,
161.704	finds itself having to force the company
164.435	to reduce its size in half
166.763	or go out of business.
169.576	Now, these recurring stories
172.294	cause me to ask two questions.
174.861	Why are the leadership gaps widening
177.332	when there's so much more investment
179.265	in leadership development?
181.489	And what are the great leaders doing
184.786	distinctly different to thrive and grow?
188.661	One of the things that I did,
191.03	I was so consumed by these questions
193.706	and also frustrated by those stories,
196.65	that I left my job
199.058	so that I could study this full time,
201.638	and I took a year to travel
204.583	to different parts of the world
206.603	to learn about effective and ineffective
208.989	leadership practices in companies,
211.374	countries and nonprofit organizations.
214.877	And so I did things like travel to South Africa,
218.204	where I had an opportunity to understand
221.13	how Nelson Mandela was ahead of his time
223.604	in anticipating and navigating
225.495	his political, social and economic context.
228.912	I also met a number of nonprofit leaders
231.935	who, despite very limited financial resources,
235.905	were making a huge impact in the world,
238.848	often bringing together seeming adversaries.
242.71	And I spent countless hours in presidential libraries
247.765	trying to understand how the environment
250.097	had shaped the leaders,
251.255	the moves that they made,
252.858	and then the impact of those moves
254.384	beyond their tenure.
257.311	And then, when I returned to work full time,
260.312	in this role, I joined with wonderful colleagues
263.601	who were also interested in these questions.
267.093	Now, from all this, I distilled
270.038	the characteristics of leaders who are thriving
274.042	and what they do differently,
275.868	and then I also distilled
278.321	the preparation practices that enable people
281.263	to grow to their potential.
283.919	I want to share some of those with you now.
285.852	"(""What makes a great leader in the 21st century?"")"
287.927	In a 21st-century world, which is more global,
291.292	digitally enabled and transparent,
293.743	with faster speeds of information 
293.743	flow and innovation,
297.156	and where nothing big gets done
299.451	without some kind of a complex matrix,
302.687	relying on traditional development practices
306.347	will stunt your growth as a leader.
309.005	In fact, traditional assessments
311.852	like narrow 360 surveys or
311.852	outdated performance criteria
316.195	will give you false positives,
318.233	lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared
321.659	than you really are.
323.799	Leadership in the 21st century is defined
327.692	and evidenced by three questions.
330.846	Where are you looking
332.18	to anticipate the next change
335.256	to your business model or your life?
338.729	The answer to this question is on your calendar.
343.579	Who are you spending time with? On what topics?
347.52	Where are you traveling? What are you reading?
350.068	And then how are you distilling this
351.815	into understanding potential discontinuities,
355.522	and then making a decision to do something
357.774	right now so that you're prepared and ready?
362.188	There's a leadership team that does a practice
365.19	where they bring together each member
368.162	collecting, here are trends that impact me,
370.969	here are trends that impact another team member,
373.254	and they share these,
374.653	and then make decisions,
374.653	to course-correct a strategy
377.449	or to anticipate a new move.
380.706	Great leaders are not head-down.
383.759	They see around corners,
386.004	shaping their future, not just reacting to it.
389.913	The second question is,
391.868	what is the diversity measure
393.887	of your personal and professional
393.887	stakeholder network?
397.506	You know, we hear often about 
397.506	good ol' boy networks
400.508	and they're certainly alive and 
400.508	well in many institutions.
404.424	But to some extent, we all have a network
406.967	of people that we're comfortable with.
408.896	So this question is about your capacity
411.808	to develop relationships with people
414.307	that are very different than you.
415.83	And those differences can be biological,
418.823	physical, functional, political, 
418.823	cultural, socioeconomic.
423.607	And yet, despite all these differences,
427.05	they connect with you
428.807	and they trust you enough
430.061	to cooperate with you
431.343	in achieving a shared goal.
434.481	Great leaders understand
436.816	that having a more diverse network
439.745	is a source of pattern identification
443.286	at greater levels and also of solutions,
446.071	because you have people that are thinking
447.895	differently than you are.
450.58	Third question: are you courageous enough
453.93	to abandon a practice that has 
453.93	made you successful in the past?
459.832	There's an expression: Go along to get along.
463.981	But if you follow this advice,
466.899	chances are as a leader,
469.291	you're going to keep doing
469.291	what's familiar and comfortable.
473.806	Great leaders dare to be different.
476.659	They don't just talk about risk-taking,
478.304	they actually do it.
480.122	And one of the leaders shared with me the fact that
483.034	the most impactful development comes
485.611	when you are able to build the emotional stamina
488.915	to withstand people telling you that your new idea
493.075	is na√Øve or reckless or just plain stupid.
497.793	Now interestingly, the people who will join you
501.655	are not your usual suspects in your network.
505.11	They're often people that think differently
508.761	and therefore are willing to join you
511.633	in taking a courageous leap.
513.992	And it's a leap, not a step.
517.243	More than traditional leadership programs,
520.152	answering these three questions
522.034	will determine your effectiveness
523.417	as a 21st-century leader.
526.886	So what makes a great leader in the 21st century?
531.307	I've met many, and they stand out.
534.856	They are women and men
536.507	who are preparing themselves
538.273	not for the comfortable predictability of yesterday
541.392	but also for the realities of today
545.168	and all of those unknown possibilities of tomorrow.
549.429	Thank you.
551.856	(Applause)
