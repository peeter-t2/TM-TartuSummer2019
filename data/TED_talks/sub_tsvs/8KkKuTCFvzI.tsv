12.76	What keeps us healthy and happy
15.76	as we go through life?
18.52	If you were going to invest now
21.04	in your future best self,
23.12	where would you put your time
23.12	and your energy?
27.12	There was a recent survey of millennials
29.56	asking them what their
29.56	most important life goals were,
34.76	and over 80 percent said
36.8	that a major life goal for them
36.8	was to get rich.
40.96	And another 50 percent
40.96	of those same young adults
45.32	said that another major life goal
47.88	was to become famous.
50.96	(Laughter)
52.2	And we're constantly told
52.2	to lean in to work, to push harder
58.88	and achieve more.
60.96	We're given the impression that these
60.96	are the things that we need to go after
64.64	in order to have a good life.
66.48	Pictures of entire lives,
68.72	of the choices that people make
68.72	and how those choices work out for them,
73.96	those pictures
73.96	are almost impossible to get.
78.08	Most of what we know about human life
81.16	we know from asking people
81.16	to remember the past,
84.64	and as we know, hindsight
84.64	is anything but 20/20.
89.44	We forget vast amounts
89.44	of what happens to us in life,
93.16	and sometimes memory
93.16	is downright creative.
96.8	But what if we could watch entire lives
101.2	as they unfold through time?
104.08	What if we could study people
104.08	from the time that they were teenagers
108.08	all the way into old age
110.84	to see what really keeps people
110.84	happy and healthy?
115.56	We did that.
117.64	The Harvard Study of Adult Development
119.88	may be the longest study
119.88	of adult life that's ever been done.
125.72	For 75 years, we've tracked
125.72	the lives of 724 men,
133.36	year after year, asking about their work,
133.36	their home lives, their health,
137.88	and of course asking all along the way
137.88	without knowing how their life stories
142.28	were going to turn out.
145.28	Studies like this are exceedingly rare.
148.92	Almost all projects of this kind
148.92	fall apart within a decade
153	because too many people
153	drop out of the study,
156.2	or funding for the research dries up,
159.12	or the researchers get distracted,
161.4	or they die, and nobody moves the ball
161.4	further down the field.
166.28	But through a combination of luck
168.56	and the persistence
168.56	of several generations of researchers,
172.28	this study has survived.
174.52	About 60 of our original 724 men
179.04	are still alive,
180.36	still participating in the study,
182.56	most of them in their 90s.
185.56	And we are now beginning to study
187.48	the more than 2,000 children of these men.
191.68	And I'm the fourth director of the study.
195.4	Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
195.4	of two groups of men.
200.16	The first group started in the study
202.32	when they were sophomores
202.32	at Harvard College.
205.04	They all finished college
205.04	during World War II,
207.88	and then most went off
207.88	to serve in the war.
211.28	And the second group that we've followed
213.44	was a group of boys
213.44	from Boston's poorest neighborhoods,
217.64	boys who were chosen for the study
219.68	specifically because they were
219.68	from some of the most troubled
223.04	and disadvantaged families
224.92	in the Boston of the 1930s.
227.68	Most lived in tenements,
227.68	many without hot and cold running water.
234.52	When they entered the study,
236.44	all of these teenagers were interviewed.
239.4	They were given medical exams.
241.64	We went to their homes
241.64	and we interviewed their parents.
245.2	And then these teenagers
245.2	grew up into adults
247.6	who entered all walks of life.
250.04	They became factory workers and lawyers
250.04	and bricklayers and doctors,
256.16	one President of the United States.
260.16	Some developed alcoholism.
260.16	A few developed schizophrenia.
265.32	Some climbed the social ladder
267.64	from the bottom
267.64	all the way to the very top,
270.88	and some made that journey
270.88	in the opposite direction.
275.52	The founders of this study
278.48	would never in their wildest dreams
280.52	have imagined that I would be
280.52	standing here today, 75 years later,
285.08	telling you that
285.08	the study still continues.
289.28	Every two years, our patient
289.28	and dedicated research staff
292.92	calls up our men
292.92	and asks them if we can send them
296	yet one more set of questions
296	about their lives.
300.04	Many of the inner city Boston men ask us,
303.64	"""Why do you keep wanting to study me?"
303.64	"My life just isn't that interesting."""
308.6	The Harvard men never ask that question.
311	(Laughter)
320.92	To get the clearest picture
320.92	of these lives,
323.8	we don't just send them questionnaires.
326.76	We interview them in their living rooms.
329.24	We get their medical records
329.24	from their doctors.
332.2	We draw their blood, we scan their brains,
334.72	we talk to their children.
336.44	We videotape them talking with their wives
336.44	about their deepest concerns.
341.72	And when, about a decade ago,
341.72	we finally asked the wives
345.28	if they would join us
345.28	as members of the study,
347.68	many of the women said,
347.68	"""You know, it's about time."""
350.4	(Laughter)
351.48	So what have we learned?
353.2	What are the lessons that come
353.2	from the tens of thousands of pages
358.44	of information that we've generated
361.52	on these lives?
363.72	Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
363.72	or fame or working harder and harder.
370.52	The clearest message that we get
370.52	from this 75-year study is this:
376.84	Good relationships keep us
376.84	happier and healthier. Period.
383	We've learned three big lessons
383	about relationships.
386.84	The first is that social connections
386.84	are really good for us,
390.96	and that loneliness kills.
393.48	It turns out that people
393.48	who are more socially connected
397.16	to family, to friends, to community,
400.28	are happier, they're physically healthier,
400.28	and they live longer
405	than people who are less well connected.
408.4	And the experience of loneliness
408.4	turns out to be toxic.
411.84	People who are more isolated
411.84	than they want to be from others
417	find that they are less happy,
420.24	their health declines earlier in midlife,
423.2	their brain functioning declines sooner
425.44	and they live shorter lives
425.44	than people who are not lonely.
430.04	And the sad fact
430.04	is that at any given time,
433.28	more than one in five Americans
433.28	will report that they're lonely.
439.04	And we know that you
439.04	can be lonely in a crowd
441.72	and you can be lonely in a marriage,
444.4	so the second big lesson that we learned
446.56	is that it's not just
446.56	the number of friends you have,
449.68	and it's not whether or not
449.68	you're in a committed relationship,
453.2	but it's the quality
453.2	of your close relationships that matters.
458.56	It turns out that living in the midst
458.56	of conflict is really bad for our health.
463.36	High-conflict marriages, for example,
463.36	without much affection,
467.36	turn out to be very bad for our health,
467.36	perhaps worse than getting divorced.
473.16	And living in the midst of good,
473.16	warm relationships is protective.
477.96	Once we had followed our men
477.96	all the way into their 80s,
481.08	we wanted to look back at them at midlife
484.12	and to see if we could predict
485.72	who was going to grow
485.72	into a happy, healthy octogenarian
489.72	and who wasn't.
491.68	And when we gathered together
491.68	everything we knew about them
495.92	at age 50,
498.08	it wasn't their middle age
498.08	cholesterol levels
500.64	that predicted how they
500.64	were going to grow old.
503.56	It was how satisfied they were
503.56	in their relationships.
507.04	The people who were the most satisfied
507.04	in their relationships at age 50
511.96	were the healthiest at age 80.
515.68	And good, close relationships
515.68	seem to buffer us
518.88	from some of the slings and arrows
518.88	of getting old.
522.48	Our most happily partnered men and women
526.48	reported, in their 80s,
528.559	that on the days
528.559	when they had more physical pain,
531.52	their mood stayed just as happy.
534.4	But the people who were
534.4	in unhappy relationships,
537.68	on the days when they
537.68	reported more physical pain,
540.64	it was magnified by more emotional pain.
544.36	And the third big lesson that we learned
544.36	about relationships and our health
548.76	is that good relationships
548.76	don't just protect our bodies,
552.04	they protect our brains.
554.44	It turns out that being
554.44	in a securely attached relationship
559.12	to another person in your 80s
559.12	is protective,
563.04	that the people who are in relationships
565.04	where they really feel they can count
565.04	on the other person in times of need,
569.2	those people's memories
569.2	stay sharper longer.
572.92	And the people in relationships
574.44	where they feel they really
574.44	can't count on the other one,
577.6	those are the people who experience
577.6	earlier memory decline.
582.52	And those good relationships,
582.52	they don't have to be smooth all the time.
586	Some of our octogenarian couples
586	could bicker with each other
589.6	day in and day out,
591.36	but as long as they felt that they
591.36	could really count on the other
594.56	when the going got tough,
596.4	those arguments didn't take a toll
596.4	on their memories.
601.6	So this message,
604.36	that good, close relationships
604.36	are good for our health and well-being,
610.08	this is wisdom that's as old as the hills.
613.04	Why is this so hard to get
613.04	and so easy to ignore?
617.56	Well, we're human.
619.04	What we'd really like is a quick fix,
621.88	something we can get
623.6	that'll make our lives good
623.6	and keep them that way.
627.32	Relationships are messy
627.32	and they're complicated
630.68	and the hard work of tending
630.68	to family and friends,
634.52	it's not sexy or glamorous.
637.2	It's also lifelong. It never ends.
640.56	The people in our 75-year study
640.56	who were the happiest in retirement
645.64	were the people who had actively worked
645.64	to replace workmates with new playmates.
651.48	Just like the millennials
651.48	in that recent survey,
654.48	many of our men when they
654.48	were starting out as young adults
658.12	really believed that fame and wealth
658.12	and high achievement
662.16	were what they needed to go after
662.16	to have a good life.
666.12	But over and over, over these 75 years,
666.12	our study has shown
670.32	that the people who fared the best were
670.32	the people who leaned in to relationships,
676	with family, with friends, with community.
681.08	So what about you?
683.08	Let's say you're 25,
683.08	or you're 40, or you're 60.
687.8	What might leaning in
687.8	to relationships even look like?
691.76	Well, the possibilities
691.76	are practically endless.
695.6	It might be something as simple
695.6	as replacing screen time with people time
701.72	or livening up a stale relationship
701.72	by doing something new together,
706.2	long walks or date nights,
709.36	or reaching out to that family member
709.36	who you haven't spoken to in years,
714.24	because those all-too-common family feuds
717.76	take a terrible toll
720	on the people who hold the grudges.
724	I'd like to close with a quote
724	from Mark Twain.
729.28	More than a century ago,
731.68	he was looking back on his life,
734.32	and he wrote this:
736.84	"""There isn't time, so brief is life,"
740.56	for bickerings, apologies,
740.56	heartburnings, callings to account.
746.72	There is only time for loving,
749.56	and but an instant,
749.56	"so to speak, for that."""
754.76	The good life is built
754.76	with good relationships.
759.16	Thank you.
760.4	(Applause)
