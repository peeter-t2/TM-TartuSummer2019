13.518	The first time
15.422	I felt fear
17.841	I was 41 years old.
20.502	People have always said I was brave.
23.499	When I was little,
23.499	I'd climb the highest tree,
26.142	and I'd approach any animal fearlessly.
29.821	I liked challenges.
32.106	My father used to say,
34.622	"""Good steel can withstand"
34.622	"any temperature."""
40.153	And when I entered into
40.153	Colombian politics,
44.265	I thought I'd be able
44.265	to withstand any temperature.
46.77	I wanted to end corruption;
48.965	I wanted to cut ties between politicians
48.965	and drug traffickers.
53.168	The first time I was elected,
55.85	it was because I called out, by name,
58.557	corrupt and untouchable politicians.
62.172	I also called out the president
65.388	for his ties to the cartels.
69.46	That's when the threats started.
72.449	I had to send my very young children
72.449	out of the country one morning,
77.805	hidden, all the way to the airport,
77.805	in the French ambassador's armored car.
82.425	Days later,
84.742	I was the victim of an attack,
84.742	but emerged unharmed.
88.944	The following year,
91.135	the Colombian people elected me
91.135	with the highest number of votes.
95.755	I thought people applauded me
95.755	because I was brave.
100.224	I, too, thought I was brave.
103.279	But I wasn't.
106.714	I had simply never before experienced
110.905	true fear.
114.557	That changed
117.066	on February 23, 2002.
121.066	At the time, I was a presidential
121.066	candidate in Colombia
125.029	promoting my campaign agenda,
128.401	when I was detained
128.401	by a group of armed men.
132.222	They were wearing uniforms
132.222	with military garments.
136.41	I looked at their boots; they were rubber.
139.187	And I knew
140.62	that the Colombian army
140.62	wore leather boots.
143.767	I knew that these were FARC guerrillas.
148.068	From that point on,
148.068	everything happened very quickly.
153.457	The commando leader ordered us
153.457	to stop the vehicle.
157.891	Meanwhile, one of his men
157.891	stepped on an antipersonnel mine
162.704	and flew through the air.
165.574	He landed, sitting upright,
168.256	right in front of me.
169.929	We made eye contact
172.841	and it was then
172.841	that the young man understood:
176.246	his rubber boot with his leg still in it
178.753	had landed far away.
181.744	(Sighs)
184.823	He started
188.689	screaming like crazy.
192.972	And the truth is,
194.816	I felt -- as I feel right now,
194.816	because I'm reliving these emotions --
200.984	I felt at that moment
200.984	that something inside of me was breaking
205.54	and that I was being infected
205.54	with his fear.
208.467	My mind went blank and couldn't think;
211.355	it was paralyzed.
213.243	When I finally reacted,
216.879	I said to myself,
218.716	"""They're going to kill me,"
221.128	"and I didn't say goodbye to my children."""
226.798	As they took me into
226.798	the deepest depths of the jungle,
232.796	the FARC soldiers announced
235.169	that if the government didn't negotiate,
238.406	they'd kill me.
240.674	And I knew
243.269	that the government wouldn't negotiate.
247.865	From that point on,
249.898	I went to sleep in fear every night --
253.014	cold sweats,
255.039	shaking,
257.187	stomach ache,
259.211	insomnia.
261.793	But worse than that
261.793	was what was happening to my mind,
264.397	because my memory was being erased:
264.397	all the phone numbers,
268.92	addresses,
270.431	names of very dear people,
272.524	even significant life events.
278.386	And so,
280.41	I began to doubt myself,
280.41	to doubt my mental health.
284.862	And with doubt came desperation,
288.565	and with desperation came depression.
291.787	I was suffering notorious
291.787	behavioral changes
294.589	and it wasn't just paranoia
294.589	in moments of panic.
298.969	It was distrust,
302.692	it was hatred,
304.716	and it was also the urge to kill.
307.574	This, I realized
309.865	when they had me
309.865	chained by the neck to a tree.
315.767	They kept me outside that day,
320.086	during a tropical downpour.
323.058	I remember feeling an urgent need
323.058	to use the bathroom.
332.832	"""Whatever you have to do,"
336.616	you'll do in front of me,
343.481	"bitch,"""
350.871	the guard screamed at me.
361.121	And I
364.797	decided at that moment
376.66	to kill him.
382.155	And for days,
386.426	I was planning, trying to find
386.426	the right moment, the right way to do it,
390.563	filled with hatred,
392.072	filled with fear.
393.984	Then suddenly,
395.8	I rose up,
397.084	snapped out of it
399.209	and thought:
401.405	"""I'm not going to become one of them."
403.533	I'm not going to become an assassin.
406.47	I still have enough freedom
412.756	to decide
415.327	"who I want to be."""
419.832	That's when I learned that fear
424.134	brought me face to face with myself.
427.047	It forced me
429.212	to align my energies,
431.698	to align my meridians.
435.321	I learned that facing fear
439.717	could become a pathway to growth.
445.55	A lot of emotions arise
445.55	when I talk about all of this,
448.938	but when I think back,
452.601	I'm able to identify
454.979	the steps I took to do it.
458.093	I want to share three of them with you.
461.518	The first
465.383	was to be guided by principles.
468.426	Because I realized
469.628	that in the midst of panic
469.628	and mental block,
473.309	if I followed my principles,
476.634	I acted correctly.
480.265	I remember the first night
483.46	in a concentration camp
483.46	that the guerrillas had built
487.332	in the middle of the jungle,
489.448	with 12-foot-high bars,
492.826	barbed wire,
494.455	lookouts in the four corners
496.819	and armed men pointing
496.819	guns at us 24 hours a day.
501.318	That morning, the first morning,
504.678	some men arrived, yelling:
507.409	"""Count off! Count off!"""
510.567	My fellow hostages woke up, startled,
514.77	and began to identify themselves
514.77	in numbered sequence.
518.637	But when it was my turn,
521.732	I said,
523.858	"""Ingrid Betancourt."
525.227	If you want to know if I'm here,
525.227	"call me by my name."""
529.386	The guards' fury
532.669	was nothing compared
532.669	to that of the other hostages,
535.84	because, obviously they were scared --
538.939	we were all scared --
540.372	and they were afraid that, because of me,
540.372	they would be punished.
544.476	But for me,
545.771	beyond fear was the need
545.771	to defend my identity,
552.456	to not let them turn me into
552.456	a thing or a number.
556.027	That was one of the principles:
558.138	to defend
561.416	what I considered to be human dignity.
565.277	But make no mistake:
567.204	the guerrillas had it all
570.534	very well analyzed --
572.205	they had been kidnapping for years,
574.42	and they had developed a technique
578.865	to break us,
580.494	to defeat us, to divide us.
582.835	And so,
584.708	the second step
587.977	was to learn how to build
587.977	supportive trust,
591.008	to learn how to unite.
595.268	The jungle is like a different planet.
599.533	It's a world
604.023	of shadows, of rain,
607.937	with the hum of millions of bugs --
612.551	majiña ants, bullet ants.
615.496	I didn't stop scratching a single day
615.496	while I was in the jungle.
621.032	And of course, there were tarantulas,
621.032	scorpions, anacondas ...
625.643	I once came face to face
625.643	with a 24-foot long anaconda
629.87	that could have swallowed me in one bite.
632.048	Jaguars ...
633.921	But I want to tell you
635.945	that none of these animals
635.945	did us as much harm
640.741	as the human beings.
646.979	The guerrillas terrorized us.
649.665	They spread rumors.
653.514	Among the hostages,
653.514	they sparked betrayals,
657.087	jealousy,
659.111	resentment,
661.135	mistrust.
663.595	The first time I escaped
663.595	for a long time was with Lucho.
670.093	Lucho had been a hostage
670.093	for two years longer than I had.
673.557	We decided to tie ourselves up
677.51	with ropes
679.181	to have the strength
679.181	to lower ourselves into that dark water
683.622	full of piranhas and alligators.
688.271	What we did was, during the day,
688.271	we would hide in the mangroves.
693.702	And at night,
695.393	we would leave, get in the water,
698.377	and we would swim
698.377	and let the current carry us.
702.778	That went on for several days.
705.615	But Lucho
709.004	became sick.
710.386	He was diabetic,
712.41	and he fell into a diabetic coma.
715.148	So the guerrillas captured us.
720.618	But after having lived
720.618	through that with Lucho,
724.702	after having faced fear together, united,
728.371	not punishment, not violence -- nothing --
732.711	could ever again divide us.
739.128	What's certain is,
740.938	all the guerrillas' manipulation
740.938	was so damaging to us
746.057	that even today,
748.888	among some of the hostages
752.586	from back then,
755.531	tensions linger,
758.104	passed down from all that poison
763.586	that the guerrillas created.
767.745	The third step
770.459	is very important to me,
772.88	and it's a gift
772.88	that I want to give to you.
776.163	The third step is to learn
776.163	how to develop faith.
782.994	I want to explain it like this:
787.61	Jhon Frank Pinchao
789.929	was a police officer
792.281	who had been a hostage
792.281	for more than eight years.
795.385	He was famous for being
795.385	the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.
802.163	"But Pincho -- I called him ""Pincho"" --"
804.942	Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.
810.192	And he asked me to help him.
811.579	By that point, I basically had
811.579	a master's degree in escape attempts.
815.108	(Laughter)
817.012	So
820.014	we got started but we had a delay,
821.773	because first, Pincho
821.773	had to learn how to swim.
825.257	And we had to carry out
825.257	all these preparations in total secrecy.
830.855	Anyway, when we finally
830.855	had everything ready,
834.257	Pincho came up to me
834.257	one afternoon and said,
838.451	"""Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,"
841.634	and I go around and around in circles,
841.634	and I can't find the way out.
845.279	"What do I do?"""
847.846	"""Pincho,"
850.571	you grab a phone,
853.06	"and you call the man upstairs."""
855.831	"""Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God."""
863.577	"""God doesn't care. He'll still help you."""
869.079	(Applause)
875.447	It rained all night that night.
879.024	The following morning,
881.738	the camp woke up to a big commotion,
883.837	because Pincho had fled.
886.545	They made us dismantle the camp,
886.545	and we started marching.
889.33	During the march,
892.149	the head guerrillas told us
892.149	that Pincho had died,
896.729	and that they had found his remains
899.888	eaten by an anaconda.
904.379	Seventeen days passed --
906.097	and believe me, I counted them,
906.097	because they were torture for me.
913.98	But on the seventeenth day,
918.003	the news exploded from the radio:
919.943	Pincho was free and obviously alive.
924.024	And this was the first thing he said:
928.872	"""I know my fellow hostages are listening."
931.633	Ingrid,
933.151	I did what you told me.
934.897	I called the man upstairs,
936.592	and he sent me the patrol
936.592	"that rescued me from the jungle."""
943.284	That was an extraordinary moment,
946.321	because ...
948.098	obviously fear is contagious.
950.729	But faith is, too.
952.183	Faith isn't rational or emotional.
955.631	Faith
957.86	is an exercise of the will.
961.087	It's the discipline of the will.
964.173	It's what allows us to transform
964.173	everything that we are --
967.668	our weaknesses, our frailties,
969.99	into strength, into power.
971.604	It's truly a transformation.
974.641	It's what gives us the strength
977.526	to stand up
980.264	in the face of fear
982.484	look above it,
984.232	and see beyond it.
988.042	I hope you remember that,
991.605	because I know we all need
994.463	to connect with that strength
994.463	we have inside of us
998.057	for the times when there's a storm
998.057	raging around our boat.
1003.26	Many, many, many, many years passed
1009.399	before I could return to my house.
1015.936	But when they took us, handcuffed,
1015.936	into the helicopter
1020.989	that finally took us out of the jungle,
1023.068	everything happened as quickly
1023.068	as when they kidnapped me.
1027.797	In an instant,
1029.453	I saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,
1033.5	gagged,
1035.566	and the rescue leader,
1039.01	yelling:
1040.927	"""We're the Colombian army!"
1044.367	"You are free!"""
1048.303	The shriek
1050.62	that came out of all of us
1052.716	when we regained our freedom,
1055.201	continues to vibrate in me to this day.
1062.089	Now,
1064.363	I know they can divide all of us,
1067.594	they can manipulate us all with fear.
1072.646	"The ""No"" vote on the peace"
1072.646	referendum in Colombia;
1076.938	Brexit;
1078.731	the idea of a wall
1078.731	between Mexico and the United States;
1083.143	Islamic terrorism --
1084.849	they're all examples
1084.849	of using fear politically
1089.855	to divide and recruit us.
1094.19	We all feel fear.
1096.912	But we can all avoid being recruited
1101.254	using the resources we have --
1101.254	our principles, unity, faith.
1107.659	Yes, fear is part of the human condition,
1111.291	as well as being necessary for survival.
1115.205	But above all,
1116.968	it's the guide by which each of us builds
1122.574	our identity, our personality.
1128.649	It's true, I was 41 years old
1128.649	the first time I felt fear,
1135.653	and feeling fear was not my decision.
1140.061	But it was my decision
1140.061	what to do with that fear.
1147.054	You can survive
1151.46	crawling along, fearful.
1154.898	But you can also
1157.847	rise above the fear,
1160.406	rise up, spread your wings,
1163.242	and soar, fly high, high, high, high,
1163.242	until you reach the stars,
1167.943	where all of us want to go.
1173.367	Thank you.
1174.543	(Applause)
