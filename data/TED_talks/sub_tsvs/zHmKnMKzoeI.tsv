14.383	Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,
18.278	I try to question the inter-canceling relationship
21.223	between our civilization and its development.
25.102	Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question
27.278	the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship
31.27	between our civilization and its development.
36.622	LB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.
41.828	And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked
44.965	before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.
48.5	I also want to use this work to let more people
53.689	pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.
56.029	In the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a
58.717	protesting, reflective
63.341	and uncompromising spirit.
65.161	When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method
69.809	to better protect myself
72.165	and to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter)
76.089	After finishing this series of protests,
80.557	I started questioning why my fate was like this,
84.637	and I realized that it's not just me --
87.371	all Chinese are as confused as I am.
91.199	As you can see, these works
93.925	are about family planning, election in accordance with the law
100.29	and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.
104.573	"This work is called Xia Gang (""leaving post"")."
106.821	"""Xia Gang"" is a Chinese euphemism for ""laid off""."
110.246	It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.
117.813	From 1998 to 2000,
122.941	lost their jobs in China.
125.718	The six people in the photo
128.642	are Xia Gang workers.
130.565	I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.
135.423	On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:
137.589	"""The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party."""
141.75	For half a month
143.413	I looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.
145.725	We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here
150.637	are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible.
155.998	This piece is called The Studio.
158.142	This spring,
159.397	I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris
161.822	to shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 --
167.084	I picked the news photos of the day.
169.917	One is about the war in the Middle East,
172.229	and another one is about a public demonstration in France.
176.317	I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.
181.061	This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.
184.056	Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.
189.185	(Applause)
193.038	LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,
196.029	but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.
200.079	So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.
203.71	But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.
205.144	Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,
208.713	but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.
211.837	So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.
214.79	But it doesn't work, my eyes are still small.
219.601	LB: This one is about 9/11 memories.
227.275	This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.
232.613	Kenny Scharf's graffiti.
236.685	(Laughter)
240.717	This is Venice, Italy.
244.944	Because global temperatures rise,
246.945	the sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.
255.989	This is the ancient city of Pompeii.
258.568	Interpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.
269.645	LB: This is the Borghese Gallery
271.383	in Rome.
274.784	When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.
279.069	For instance, why would I make myself invisible?
281.805	What will making myself invisible here cause people to think?
303.645	This one is called Instant Noodles.
305.941	Interpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)
310.491	LB: Since August 2012,
314.533	harmful phosphors have been found
319.344	in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.
321.603	These phosphors can even cause cancer.
324.155	To create this artwork,
326.012	I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups
328.1	and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.
331.033	And my task is to stand there, trying to be still,
333.981	setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant
338.437	and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body
341.645	on the front of my body. If the background is simple,
345.79	I usually have to stand for three to four hours.
348.294	The background of this piece is more complex,
350.911	so I need three to four days in advance for preparation.
355.489	This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.
358.629	There is no Photoshop involved.
360.907	Interpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.
366.134	There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter)
372.141	LB: These works are on China's cultural memories.
384.989	And this one,
386.327	this is about food safety in China.
388.989	Unsafe food can harm people's health,
394.845	and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)
398.853	The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,
401.589	in different countries and at different times.
406.374	I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.
411.243	If an artwork is to touch someone,
415.365	it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.
419.029	And the repeated struggles in life create artwork,
423.405	no matter in what form.
429.029	(Music)
450.509	That's all I want to say.
451.757	Thank you. (Applause)
