17.504	When I was a kid,
19.398	the disaster we worried about most 
19.398	was a nuclear war.
23.819	That's why we had a barrel like this
23.819	down in our basement,
27.085	filled with cans of food and water.
30.256	When the nuclear attack came,
31.901	we were supposed to go downstairs,
31.901	hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
37.877	Today the greatest risk 
37.877	of global catastrophe
41.597	doesn't look like this.
44.457	Instead, it looks like this.
48.438	If anything kills over 10 million people
48.438	in the next few decades,
53.929	it's most likely to be 
53.929	a highly infectious virus
57.314	rather than a war.
59.792	Not missiles, but microbes.
63.679	Now, part of the reason for this is that
65.878	we've invested a huge amount
65.878	in nuclear deterrents.
70.081	But we've actually invested very little 
70.081	in a system to stop an epidemic.
76.129	We're not ready for the next epidemic.
80.023	Let's look at Ebola.
81.758	I'm sure all of you read about it 
81.758	in the newspaper,
85.615	lots of tough challenges.
87.221	I followed it carefully 
87.221	through the case analysis tools
90.876	we use to track polio eradication.
95.721	And as you look at what went on,
97.573	the problem wasn't that there was a system
97.573	that didn't work well enough,
102.081	the problem was that we 
102.081	didn't have a system at all.
106.589	In fact, there's some pretty obvious
106.589	key missing pieces.
111.028	We didn't have a group of epidemiologists 
111.028	ready to go, who would have gone,
115.94	seen what the disease was,
115.94	seen how far it had spread.
119.696	The case reports came in on paper.
122.452	It was very delayed
122.452	before they were put online
124.808	and they were extremely inaccurate.
127.492	We didn't have a medical team ready to go.
129.858	We didn't have a way of preparing people.
132.453	Now, Médecins Sans Frontières 
132.453	did a great job orchestrating volunteers.
137.784	But even so, we were far slower
137.784	than we should have been
140.88	getting the thousands of workers
140.88	into these countries.
144.022	And a large epidemic would require us
144.022	to have hundreds of thousands of workers.
152.752	There was no one there 
152.752	to look at treatment approaches.
157.155	No one to look at the diagnostics.
158.946	No one to figure out 
158.946	what tools should be used.
162.243	As an example, we could have 
162.243	taken the blood of survivors,
165.723	processed it, and put that plasma
165.723	back in people to protect them.
171.158	But that was never tried.
173.764	So there was a lot that was missing.
175.52	And these things 
175.52	are really a global failure.
180.305	The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics,
180.305	but not to do these things I talked about.
187.049	Now, in the movies it's quite different.
189.842	There's a group of handsome
189.842	epidemiologists ready to go,
194.674	they move in, they save the day,
194.674	but that's just pure Hollywood.
202.177	The failure to prepare 
202.177	could allow the next epidemic
205.887	to be dramatically 
205.887	more devastating than Ebola
210.735	Let's look at the progression 
210.735	of Ebola over this year.
216.311	About 10,000 people died, 
219.149	and nearly all were in the three
219.149	West African countries.
223.846	There's three reasons why
223.846	it didn't spread more.
226.433	The first is that there was a lot 
226.433	of heroic work by the health workers.
230.874	They found the people and they 
230.874	prevented more infections.
234.136	The second is the nature of the virus.
236.621	Ebola does not spread through the air.
239.697	And by the time you're contagious,
241.81	most people are so sick 
241.81	that they're bedridden.
246.22	Third, it didn't get
246.22	into many urban areas.
250.411	And that was just luck.
252.115	If it had gotten into a lot 
252.115	more urban areas,
254.355	the case numbers 
254.355	would have been much larger.
257.877	So next time, we might not be so lucky.
261.466	You can have a virus where people 
261.466	feel well enough while they're infectious
266.53	that they get on a plane
266.53	or they go to a market.
269.842	The source of the virus could be 
269.842	a natural epidemic like Ebola,
272.846	or it could be bioterrorism.
274.826	So there are things that would literally
274.826	make things a thousand times worse.
279.474	In fact, let's look at a model
279.474	of a virus spread through the air,
285.475	like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
289.63	So here's what would happen:
291.56	It would spread throughout the world
291.56	very, very quickly.
295.558	And you can see over 30 million people
295.558	died from that epidemic.
300.683	So this is a serious problem.
302.496	We should be concerned.
304.257	But in fact, we can build
304.257	a really good response system.
308.692	We have the benefits of all the science
308.692	and technology that we talk about here.
313.836	We've got cell phones
314.883	to get information from the public 
314.883	and get information out to them.
318.14	We have satellite maps where we can see
318.14	where people are and where they're moving.
322.319	We have advances in biology
324.627	that should dramatically change 
324.627	the turnaround time to look at a pathogen
328.453	and be able to make drugs and vaccines
328.453	that fit for that pathogen.
333.322	So we can have tools,
334.888	but those tools need to be put
334.888	into an overall global health system.
339.5	And we need preparedness.
341.793	The best lessons, I think, 
341.793	on how to get prepared
344.257	are again, what we do for war.
346.758	For soldiers, we have full-time,
346.758	waiting to go.
351.005	We have reserves that can scale 
351.005	us up to large numbers.
354.316	NATO has a mobile unit 
354.316	that can deploy very rapidly.
358.005	NATO does a lot of war games 
358.005	to check, are people well trained?
361.455	Do they understand 
361.455	about fuel and logistics
363.883	and the same radio frequencies?
366.241	So they are absolutely ready to go.
368.779	So those are the kinds of things
368.779	we need to deal with an epidemic.
373.134	What are the key pieces?
375.301	First, we need strong health systems
375.301	in poor countries.
380.591	That's where mothers 
380.591	can give birth safely,
383.778	kids can get all their vaccines.
385.295	But, also where we'll see 
385.295	the outbreak very early on.
390.154	We need a medical reserve corps:
391.935	lots of people who've got 
391.935	the training and background
394.501	who are ready to go, with the expertise.
397.853	And then we need to pair those
397.853	medical people with the military.
402.266	taking advantage of the military's ability
402.266	to move fast, do logistics
406.417	and secure areas.
408.22	We need to do simulations,
411.129	germ games, not war games,
411.129	so that we see where the holes are.
415.927	The last time a germ game 
415.927	was done in the United States
418.723	was back in 2001, 
418.723	and it didn't go so well.
422.453	So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.
427.49	Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D
427.49	in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.
433.609	There are some big breakthroughs, 
433.609	like the Adeno-associated virus,
437.246	that could work very, very quickly.
441.229	Now I don't have an exact budget
441.229	for what this would cost,
444.599	but I'm quite sure it's very modest
444.599	compared to the potential harm.
449.095	The World Bank estimates that 
449.095	if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,
453.74	global wealth will go down
453.74	by over three trillion dollars
457.465	and we'd have millions
457.465	and millions of deaths.
461.332	These investments 
461.332	offer significant benefits
464.317	beyond just being ready for the epidemic.
466.518	The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D,
468.982	those things would reduce 
468.982	global health equity
471.812	and make the world more just 
471.812	as well as more safe.
475.502	So I think this should absolutely
475.502	be a priority.
479.514	There's no need to panic.
480.98	We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti
480.98	or go down into the basement.
485.469	But we need to get going,
485.469	because time is not on our side.
489.309	In fact, if there's one positive thing
489.309	that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,
495.524	it's that it can serve as an early 
495.524	warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.
501.33	If we start now, we can be ready 
501.33	for the next epidemic.
506.978	Thank you.
508.574	(Applause)
