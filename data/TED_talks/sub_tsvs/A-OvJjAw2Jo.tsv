12.488	So this is James Risen.
15.174	You may know him as the
15.174	Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter
17.948	for The New York Times.
19.664	Long before anybody knew
19.664	Edward Snowden's name,
22.442	Risen wrote a book in which
22.442	he famously exposed
25.382	that the NSA was illegally wiretapping
25.382	the phone calls of Americans.
29.842	But it's another chapter in that book
31.636	that may have an even more lasting impact.
34.405	In it, he describes a catastrophic
34.405	US intelligence operation
39.247	in which the CIA quite literally
39.247	handed over blueprints
42.36	of a nuclear bomb to Iran.
44.662	If that sounds crazy, go read it.
46.481	It's an incredible story.
48.456	But you know who didn't like that chapter?
50.893	The US government.
52.592	For nearly a decade afterwards,
54.83	Risen was the subject
54.83	of a US government investigation
58.107	in which prosecutors demanded
58.107	that he testify
60.5	against one of his alleged sources.
62.829	And along the way, he became the face
62.829	for the US government's recent pattern
66.928	of prosecuting whistleblowers
66.928	and spying on journalists.
70.681	You see, under the First Amendment,
72.373	the press has the right to publish
72.373	secret information in the public interest.
76.024	But it's impossible to exercise that right
76.024	if the media can't also gather that news
81.182	and protect the identities
81.182	of the brave men and women
84.462	who get it to them.
86.087	So when the government came knocking,
88.143	Risen did what many brave reporters
88.143	have done before him:
91.208	he refused
92.417	and said he'd rather go to jail.
94.611	So from 2007 to 2015,
97.618	Risen lived under the specter
97.618	of going to federal prison.
100.976	That is, until just days before the trial,
100.976	when a curious thing happened.
105.912	Suddenly, after years of claiming
105.912	it was vital to their case,
109.737	the government dropped their demands
109.737	to Risen altogether.
112.912	It turns out, in the age
112.912	of electronic surveillance,
115.484	there are very few places
115.484	reporters and sources can hide.
118.959	And instead of trying and failing
118.959	to have Risen testify,
122.578	they could have his digital trail
122.578	testify against him instead.
126.585	So completely in secret
126.585	and without his consent,
129.125	prosecutors got Risen's phone records.
131.903	They got his email records,
131.903	his financial and banking information,
136.443	his credit reports,
138.22	even travel records with a list
138.22	of flights he had taken.
141.808	And it was among this information that
141.808	they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,
145.617	Risen's alleged source
145.617	and CIA whistleblower.
150.035	Sadly, this is only one case of many.
153.152	President Obama ran on a promise
153.152	to protect whistleblowers,
156.783	and instead, his Justice Department
156.783	has prosecuted more
160.069	than all other administrations combined.
163.179	Now, you can see how this
163.179	could be a problem,
165.307	especially because the government
165.307	considers so much of what it does secret.
170.758	Since 9/11, virtually every important
170.758	story about national security
175.282	has been the result of a whistleblower
175.282	coming to a journalist.
178.67	So we risk seeing the press
178.67	unable to do their job
181.592	that the First Amendment
181.592	is supposed to protect
183.815	because of the government's
183.815	expanded ability to spy on everyone.
187.487	But just as technology has allowed
187.487	the government
189.964	to circumvent reporters' rights,
192.695	the press can also use technology
194.893	to protect their sources
194.893	even better than before.
197.698	And they can start from the moment
197.698	they begin speaking with them,
200.834	rather than on the witness stand
200.834	after the fact.
204.197	Communications software now exists
206.313	that wasn't available
206.313	when Risen was writing his book,
208.869	and is much more surveillance-resistant
208.869	than regular emails or phone calls.
213.789	For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,
218.031	an open-source whistleblower
218.031	submission system
220.74	that was originally created by the late
220.74	Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,
224.812	and is now developed
224.812	at the non-profit where I work,
227.501	Freedom of the Press Foundation.
229.824	Instead of sending an email,
231.5	you go to a news organization's website,
233.565	like this one here on The Washington Post.
236.01	From there, you can upload a document
236.01	or send information
239.977	much like you would
239.977	on any other contact form.
242.715	It'll then be encrypted
242.715	and stored on a server
245.358	that only the news organization
245.358	has access to.
248.351	So the government can no longer
248.351	secretly demand the information,
251.748	and much of the information
251.748	they would demand
253.876	wouldn't be available in the first place.
256.475	SecureDrop, though, is really
256.475	only a small part of the puzzle
259.463	for protecting press freedom
259.463	in the 21st century.
263.035	Unfortunately, governments
263.035	all over the world
265.432	are constantly developing
265.432	new spying techniques
267.956	that put us all at risk.
270.043	And it's up to us going forward
270.043	to make sure
272.765	that it's not just
272.765	the tech-savvy whistleblowers,
275.289	like Edward Snowden, who have
275.289	an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.
279.408	It's just as vital that we protect the
279.408	next veteran's health care whistleblower
284.179	alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,
287.511	or the next environmental worker
289.862	sounding the alarm
289.862	about Flint's dirty water,
293.084	or a Wall Street insider
294.788	warning us of the next financial crisis.
297.869	After all, these tools weren't just built
297.869	to help the brave men and women
302.021	who expose crimes,
303.583	but are meant to protect
303.583	all of our rights under the Constitution.
307.46	Thank you.
308.635	(Applause)
