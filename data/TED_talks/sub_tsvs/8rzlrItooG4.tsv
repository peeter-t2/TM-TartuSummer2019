15.26	"The maxim, ""Know thyself"""
15.26	has been around since the ancient Greeks.
20.263	Some attribute this golden world
20.263	knowledge to Plato, others to Pythagoras.
24.488	But the truth is it doesn't really matter
24.488	which sage said it first,
27.688	because it's still
27.688	sage advice, even today.
32.031	"""Know thyself."""
33.515	It's pithy almost to the point
33.515	of being meaningless,
37.469	but it rings familiar
37.469	and true, doesn't it?
41.155	"""Know thyself."""
44.094	I understand this timeless dictum
44.094	as a statement about the problems,
47.433	or more exactly, the confusions,
47.433	of consciousness.
50.71	I've always been fascinated
50.71	with knowing the self.
53.096	This fascination led me
53.096	to submerge myself in art,
55.627	study neuroscience,
55.627	and later, to become a psychotherapist.
59.108	Today I combine all my passions
59.108	as the CEO of InteraXon,
62.808	a thought-controlled computing company.
65.224	My goal, quite simply, is to help people
65.224	become more in tune with themselves.
70.566	I take it from this
70.566	"little dictum, ""Know thyself."""
74.384	If you think about it,
75.891	this imperative is kind of the defining
75.891	characteristic of our species, isn't it?
81.118	I mean, it's self-awareness
82.784	that separates Homo sapiens
82.784	from earlier instances of our mankind.
87.926	Today we're often too busy
90.012	tending to our iPhones and iPods
90.012	to really stop and get to know ourselves.
95.197	Under the deluge of minute-to-minute
95.197	text conversations,
97.848	e-mails, relentless exchange
97.848	of media channels
100.932	and passwords and apps
100.932	and reminders and Tweets and tags,
103.757	we lose sight of what all this fuss is
103.757	supposed to be about in the first place:
107.507	Ourselves.
109.146	Much of the time we're transfixed
111.222	by all of the ways we can reflect
111.222	ourselves out into the world.
114.538	And we can barely find the time to reflect
114.538	deeply back in on our own selves.
120.816	We've cluttered ourselves up
120.816	with all this.
123.399	And we feel like we have to get
123.399	far, far away to a secluded retreat,
126.854	leaving it all behind.
128.328	So we go far away
128.328	to the top of a mountain,
131.46	assuming that perching
131.46	ourselves on a piece
133.514	is bound to give us the respite we need
133.514	to sort the clutter, the chaotic everyday,
138.027	and find ourselves again.
140.406	But on that mountain where we gain
140.406	that beautiful peace of mind,
145.399	what are we really achieving?
147.544	It's really only a successful escape.
151.728	"Think of the term we use, ""Retreat."""
153.572	This is the term that armies use
153.572	when they've lost a battle.
156.417	It means we've got to get out of here.
158.27	Is this how we feel
158.27	about the pressures of our world,
160.789	that in order to get inside ourselves,
162.807	you have to run for the hills?
164.875	And the problem with escaping
164.875	your day-to-day life
168.115	is that you have to come home, eventually.
171.751	So when you think about it,
173.188	we're almost like a tourist
173.188	visiting ourselves over there.
177.666	And eventually, that vacation's got
177.666	to come to an end.
180.835	So my question to you is,
183.608	can we find ways to know ourselves
183.608	without the escape?
188.441	Can we redefine our relationship
188.441	with the technologized world
192.026	in order to have the heightened
192.026	sense of self-awareness that we seek?
195.698	Can we live here and now in our wired web
199.198	and still follow those ancient
199.198	"instructions, ""Know thyself?"""
205.32	I say the answer is yes.
206.95	And I'm here today to share a new way
209.02	that we're working
209.02	with technology to this end,
211.454	to get familiar with our inner self
211.454	like never before --
214.933	humanizing technology
214.933	and furthering that age-old quest of ours
219.45	to more fully know the self.
221.943	It's called thought-controlled computing.
228.101	You may or may not have noticed
229.632	that I'm wearing a tiny
229.632	electrode on my forehead.
231.965	This is actually a brainwave sensor
233.66	that's reading the electrical
233.66	activity of my brain
236.04	as I give this talk.
237.731	These brainwaves are being analyzed
237.731	and we can see them as a graph.
241.265	Let me show you what it looks like.
244.127	That blue line there is my brainwave.
246.762	It's the direct signal being recorded
246.762	from my head, rendered in real time.
250.921	The green and red bars show
250.921	that same signal displayed by frequency,
254.356	with lower frequencies here
256.094	and higher frequencies up here.
258.25	You're actually looking
258.25	inside my head as I speak.
262.965	These graphs are compelling,
262.965	they're undulating,
265.989	but from a human's perspective,
265.989	they're actually not very useful.
270.069	That's why we've spent a lot of time
272.07	thinking about how to make this data
272.07	meaningful to the people who use it.
275.871	For instance,
277.409	what if I could use this data to find out
277.409	how relaxed I am at any moment?
281.388	Or what if I can take that information
283.233	and put it into an organic
283.233	shape up on the screen?
286.921	The shape on the right over here
288.797	has become an indicator
288.797	of what's going on in my head.
291.498	The more relaxed I am,
293.016	the more the energy's going
293.016	to fall through it.
295.502	I may also be interested in knowing
295.502	how focused I am,
298.38	so I can put my level of attention
298.38	into the circuit board on the other side.
302.162	And the more focused my brain is,
303.801	the more the circuit board
303.801	is going to surge with energy.
306.706	Ordinarily, I would have no way
306.706	of knowing how focused or relaxed I was
310.154	in any tangible way.
312.856	As we know, our feelings
312.856	about how we're feeling
315.139	are notoriously unreliable.
316.992	We've all had stress creep up
316.992	on us without even noticing it
319.849	until we lost it on someone
319.849	who didn't deserve it,
322.289	and then we realize that we probably
322.289	should have checked in with ourselves
325.887	a little earlier.
327.064	This new awareness
327.064	opens up vast possibilities
330.206	for applications that help
330.206	improve our lives and ourselves.
334.459	We're trying to create technology
334.459	that uses the insights
337.168	to make our work more efficient,
337.168	our breaks more relaxing
339.875	and our connections deeper
339.875	and more fulfilling than ever.
343.851	I'm going to share some of these
343.851	visions with you in a bit,
346.648	but first I want to take
346.648	a look at how we got here.
349.26	By the way, feel free to check
349.26	in on my head at any time.
352.728	(Laughter)
354.729	My team at InteraXon and I
356.26	have been developing thought-controlled
356.26	application for almost a decade now.
360.073	In the first phase of development,
361.717	we were really enthused by all the things
361.717	we could control with our mind.
365.177	We were making things activate,
365.177	light up and work just by thinking.
369.999	We were transcending the space
369.999	between the mind and the device.
374.258	We brought to life a vast array
374.258	of prototypes and products
377.033	that you could control with your mind,
379.078	like thought-controlled home appliances
381.018	or slot-car games or video games
381.018	or a levitating chair.
385.504	We created technology and applications
385.504	that engaged people's imaginations,
389.157	and it was really exciting.
390.642	And then we were asked to do something
390.642	really big for the Olympics.
395.099	We were invited to create
395.099	a massive installation
397.386	at the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics,
399.248	were used in Vancouver,
400.803	got to control the lighting
400.803	on the CN Tower,
403.544	the Canadian Parliament
403.544	buildings and Niagara Falls
406.483	from all the way across the country
406.483	using their minds.
410.564	Over 17 days at the Olympics,
410.564	7,000 visitors from all over the world
413.807	actually got to individually
413.807	control the light
415.996	from the CN Tower, parliament
415.996	and Niagara in real time
418.651	with their minds from across
418.651	the country, 3,000 km away.
421.696	So controlling stuff
421.696	with your mind is pretty cool.
426.07	But we're always interested in multitiered
426.07	levels of human interaction.
429.556	And so we began looking into inventing
429.556	thought-controlled applications
432.981	in a more complex frame than just control.
435.742	And that was responsiveness.
439.001	We realized that we had a system
440.596	that allowed technology
440.596	to know something about you.
443.226	And it could join
443.226	into the relationship with you.
446.585	We created the responsive room
448.733	where the lights, music and blinds
448.733	adjusted to your state.
452.1	They followed these little shifts
452.1	in your mental activity.
455.127	So as you settled into relaxation
455.127	at the end of a hard day,
457.945	on the couch in our office,
459.3	the music would mellow with you.
461.48	When you read, the desk lamp
461.48	would get brighter.
464.11	If you nod off, the system would know,
464.11	dimming to darkness as you do.
469.885	We then realized that if technology
469.885	could know something about you
473.584	and use it to help you,
474.814	there's an even more valuable
474.814	application than that.
477.658	That you could know
477.658	something about yourself.
481.484	We could know sides of ourselves
481.484	that were all but invisible
484.686	and come to see things
484.686	that were previously hidden.
488.093	Let me show you an example
488.093	of what I'm talking about here.
490.863	Here's an application
490.863	that I created for the iPad.
493.43	So the goal of the original game Zen Bound
493.43	is to wrap a rope around a wooden form.
498.693	So you use it with your headset.
500.261	The headset connects wirelessly
500.261	to an iPad or a smartphone.
503.458	In that headset, you have fabric sensors
503.458	on your forehead and above the ear.
507.812	In the original Zen Bound game,
509.358	you play it by scrolling
509.358	your fingers over the pad.
512.744	In the game that we created, of course,
514.71	you control the wooden form
514.71	that's on the screen there with your mind.
519.266	As you focus on the wooden form,
521.509	it rotates.
522.728	The more you focus,
522.728	the faster the rotation.
526.118	This is for real.
527.792	This is not a fake.
529.858	What's really interesting to me though
531.722	is at the end of the game, you get stats
531.722	and feedback about how you did.
535.616	You have graphs and charts
535.616	that tell you how your brain was doing --
539.729	not just how much rope you used
539.729	or what your high score is,
542.805	but what was going on inside of your mind.
547.058	And this is valuable feedback
548.951	that we can use to understand
548.951	what's going on inside of ourselves.
555.294	"I like to call this ""intra-active."""
559.35	Normally, we think
559.35	about technology as interactive.
563.051	This technology is intra-active.
566.822	It understands what's inside of you
570.435	and builds a sort
570.435	of responsive relationship
572.824	between you and your technology
574.845	so that you can use this information
574.845	to move you forward.
579.232	So you can use this information
579.232	to understand you in a responsive loop.
584.154	At InteraXon --
587.672	intra-active technology
587.672	is one of our really defining mandates.
593.928	It's how we understand the world inside
593.928	and reflect it outside
598.852	into this tight loop.
601.925	For example, thought-controlled computing
605.078	can teach children with ADD
605.078	how to improve their focus.
608.686	With ADD, children have a low proportion
608.686	of beta waves for focus states
613.025	and a high proportion of theta states.
615.082	So you can create applications
615.082	that reward focused brain states.
618.292	So you can imagine kids playing
618.292	video games with their brain waves
621.521	and improving their ADD
621.521	symptoms as they do it.
624.014	This can be as effective as Ritalin.
626.845	Perhaps even more importantly,
628.71	thought-controlled computing
628.71	can give children with ADD
631.311	insights into their own fluctuating
631.311	mental states,
634.238	so they can better understand themselves
634.238	and their learning needs.
637.894	The way these children will be able to use
637.894	their new awareness to improve themselves
641.894	will upend many of the damaging
641.894	and widespread social stigmas
644.842	that people who are diagnosed
644.842	as different are challenged with.
649.174	We can peer inside our heads
650.554	and interact with what was once
650.554	locked away from us,
653.361	what once mystified and separated us.
657.602	Brainwave technology can understand us,
657.602	anticipate our emotions
660.916	and find the best solutions for our needs.
662.953	Imagine this collected
662.953	awareness of the individual
665.723	computed and reflected
665.723	across an entire lifespan.
668.718	Imagine the insights that you can gain
668.718	from this kind of second sight.
672.741	It would be like plugging
672.741	into your own personal Google.
676.056	On the subject of Google,
677.33	today you can search and tag images
679.26	based on the thoughts and feelings
679.26	you had while you watched them.
682.656	You can tag pictures
682.656	of baby animals as happy,
685.424	or whatever baby animals are to you,
687.918	and then you can search that database,
687.918	navigating with your feelings,
691.762	rather than the keywords
691.762	that just hint at them.
694.829	Or you could tag Facebook photos
697.112	with the emotions that you had
697.112	associated with those memories
701.728	and then instantly prioritize
701.728	the streams that catch your attention,
706.154	just like this.
708.707	Humanizing technology
708.707	is about taking what's already natural
711.817	about the human-tech experience
713.441	and building technology
713.441	seamlessly in tandem with it.
716.851	As it aligns with our human behaviors,
719.184	it can allow us to make
719.184	better sense of what we do
722.384	and, more importantly, why.
725.126	Creating a big picture
725.126	out of all the important little details
728.26	that make up who we are.
731.174	With humanized technology we can monitor
731.174	the quality of your sleep cycles.
735.263	When our productivity starts to slacken,
735.263	we can go back to that data
739.539	and see how we can make more effective
739.539	balance between work and play.
744.192	Do you know what causes fatigue in you
744.192	or what brings out your energetic self,
748.149	what triggers cause you to be depressed
750.091	or what fun things are going
750.091	to bring you out of that funk?
755.017	Imagine if you had access to data
756.687	that allowed you to rank
756.687	on a scale of overall happiness
759.908	which people in your life
759.908	made you the happiest,
763.487	or what activities brought you joy.
765.907	Would you make more time for those people?
765.907	Would you prioritize?
768.986	Would you get a divorce?
770.285	(Laughter)
771.694	What thought-controlled computing
771.694	can allow you to do
774.207	is build colorful layered
774.207	pictures of our lives.
777.023	And with this, we can get the skinny
777.023	on our psychological happenings
780.533	and build a story
780.533	of our behaviors over time.
783.379	We can begin to see the underlying
783.379	narratives that propel us forward
786.622	and tell us about what's going on.
790.033	And from this, we can learn
790.033	how to change the plot, the outcome
794.585	and the character of our personal stories.
798.826	Two millennia ago, those Greeks
798.826	had some powerful insights.
803.682	They knew that a fundamental
803.682	piece falls into place
806.126	when you start to live
806.126	out their little phrase,
808.889	when you come into contact with yourself.
811.681	They understood the power
811.681	of human narrative
815.056	and the value that we place on humans
815.056	as changing, evolving and growing.
819.608	But they understood something
819.608	more fundamental --
823.085	the sheer joy in discovery,
826.366	the delight and fascination
826.366	that we get from the world
828.919	and being ourselves in it;
831.118	the richness that we get from seeing,
831.118	feeling and knowing the lives that we are.
836.787	My mom's an artist,
837.978	and as a child, I'd often see her bring
837.978	things to life with the stroke of a brush.
841.86	One moment, it was
841.86	all white space, pure possibility.
844.492	The next, it was alive
844.492	with her colorful ideas and expressions.
848.717	As I sat easel-side, watching her
848.717	transform canvas after canvas,
854.413	I learned that you could
854.413	create your own world.
858.093	I learned that our own inner worlds --
860.321	our ideas, emotions and imaginations --
863.485	were, in fact, not bound
863.485	by our brains and bodies.
866.768	If you could think it,
866.768	if you could discover it,
870.135	you could bring it to life.
873.097	To me, thought-controlled computing
875.26	is as simple and powerful
875.26	as a paintbrush --
877.687	one more tool to unlock and enliven
877.687	the hidden worlds within us.
882.223	I look forward to the day
882.223	that I can sit beside you, easel-side,
887.05	watching the world that we can create
887.05	with our new toolboxes
891.189	and the discoveries
891.189	that we can make about ourselves.
895.752	Thank you.
896.983	(Applause)
