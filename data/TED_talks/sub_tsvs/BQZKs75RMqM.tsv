13.126	Over the past 10 years,
14.445	I've been researching the way
14.445	people organize and visualize information.
19.786	And I've noticed an interesting shift.
22.166	For a long period of time,
23.91	we believed in a natural ranking order
23.91	in the world around us,
28.362	also known as the great chain of being,
28.362	"or ""Scala naturae"" in Latin,"
33.131	a top-down structure that normally starts
33.131	with God at the very top,
37.33	followed by angels, noblemen,
39.759	common people, animals, and so on.
43.999	This idea was actually based
43.999	on Aristotle's ontology,
48.298	which classified all things known to man
48.298	in a set of opposing categories,
52.766	like the ones you see behind me.
56.687	But over time, interestingly enough,
59.458	this concept adopted
59.458	the branching schema of a tree
63.628	in what became known
63.628	as the Porphyrian tree,
66.525	also considered to be
66.525	the oldest tree of knowledge.
71.238	The branching scheme
71.238	of the tree was, in fact,
73.436	such a powerful metaphor
73.436	for conveying information
76.409	that it became, over time,
76.409	an important communication tool
79.703	to map a variety of systems of knowledge.
82.648	We can see trees being used
82.648	to map morality,
85.755	with the popular tree of virtues
85.755	and tree of vices,
88.628	as you can see here, with these beautiful
88.628	illustrations from medieval Europe.
92.825	We can see trees being used
92.825	to map consanguinity,
95.937	the various blood ties between people.
99.11	We can also see trees being used
99.11	to map genealogy,
102.23	perhaps the most famous archetype
102.23	of the tree diagram.
105.064	I think many of you in the audience
105.064	have probably seen family trees.
108.404	Many of you probably even have
108.404	your own family trees drawn in such a way.
113.158	We can see trees even mapping
113.158	systems of law,
116.093	the various decrees and rulings
116.093	of kings and rulers.
121.785	And finally, of course,
121.785	also a very popular scientific metaphor,
125.567	we can see trees being used
125.567	to map all species known to man.
131.177	And trees ultimately became
131.177	such a powerful visual metaphor
135.107	because in many ways,
135.107	they really embody this human desire
137.999	for order, for balance,
137.999	for unity, for symmetry.
141.999	However, nowadays we are really facing
141.999	new complex, intricate challenges
146.346	that cannot be understood by simply
146.346	employing a simple tree diagram.
152.037	And a new metaphor is currently emerging,
155.303	and it's currently replacing the tree
157.477	in visualizing various
157.477	systems of knowledge.
160.064	It's really providing us with a new lens
160.064	to understand the world around us.
165.495	And this new metaphor
165.495	is the metaphor of the network.
169.511	And we can see this shift
169.511	from trees into networks
172.846	in many domains of knowledge.
174.51	We can see this shift in the way
174.51	we try to understand the brain.
180.453	While before, we used
180.453	to think of the brain
182.515	as a modular, centralized organ,
184.53	where a given area was responsible
184.53	for a set of actions and behaviors,
188.592	the more we know about the brain,
190.355	the more we think of it
190.355	as a large music symphony,
193.665	played by hundreds
193.665	and thousands of instruments.
196.299	This is a beautiful snapshot
196.299	created by the Blue Brain Project,
199.999	where you can see 10,000 neurons
199.999	and 30 million connections.
204.736	And this is only mapping 10 percent
204.736	of a mammalian neocortex.
210.815	We can also see this shift in the way
210.815	we try to conceive of human knowledge.
216.062	These are some remarkable trees
216.062	of knowledge, or trees of science,
219.234	by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.
221.999	And Llull was actually the precursor,
223.833	the very first one who created
223.833	the metaphor of science as a tree,
227.571	a metaphor we use
227.571	every single day, when we say,
230.563	"""Biology is a branch of science,"""
232.252	when we say,
233.429	"""Genetics is a branch of science."""
236.283	But perhaps the most beautiful of all
236.283	trees of knowledge, at least for me,
239.902	was created for the French encyclopedia
239.902	by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.
244.378	This was really the bastion
244.378	of the French Enlightenment,
247.037	and this gorgeous illustration
247.037	was featured as a table of contents
250.886	for the encyclopedia.
252.481	And it actually maps out
252.481	all domains of knowledge
256.692	as separate branches of a tree.
259.866	But knowledge is much more
259.866	intricate than this.
262.794	These are two maps of Wikipedia
262.794	showing the inter-linkage of articles --
267.458	related to history on the left,
267.458	and mathematics on the right.
271.966	And I think by looking at these maps
273.729	and other ones that have been
273.729	created of Wikipedia --
276.297	arguably one of the largest rhizomatic
276.297	structures ever created by man --
279.713	we can really understand
279.713	how human knowledge is much more intricate
283.559	and interdependent, just like a network.
287.455	We can also see this interesting shift
289.642	in the way we map
289.642	social ties between people.
293.524	This is the typical organization chart.
295.843	I'm assuming many of you have seen
295.843	a similar chart as well,
298.661	in your own corporations, or others.
300.431	It's a top-down structure
301.94	that normally starts
301.94	with the CEO at the very top,
304.825	and where you can drill down all the way
304.825	to the individual workmen on the bottom.
309.634	But humans sometimes are, well, actually,
309.634	all humans are unique in their own way,
314.506	and sometimes you really don't play well
314.506	under this really rigid structure.
320.711	I think the Internet is really changing
320.711	this paradigm quite a lot.
323.845	This is a fantastic map
323.845	of online social collaboration
327.234	between Perl developers.
328.887	Perl is a famous programming language,
330.999	and here, you can see
330.999	how different programmers
333.746	are actually exchanging files,
333.746	and working together on a given project.
337.597	And here, you can notice that this is
337.597	a completely decentralized process --
341.799	there's no leader in this organization,
343.979	it's a network.
346.337	We can also see this interesting shift
346.337	when we look at terrorism.
351.613	One of the main challenges
351.613	of understanding terrorism nowadays
354.741	is that we are dealing with
354.741	decentralized, independent cells,
358.495	where there's no leader
358.495	leading the whole process.
362.518	And here, you can actually see
362.518	how visualization is being used.
365.84	The diagram that you see behind me
367.521	shows all the terrorists involved
367.521	in the Madrid attack in 2004.
371.942	And what they did here is,
371.942	they actually segmented the network
374.893	into three different years,
376.416	represented by the vertical layers
376.416	that you see behind me.
379.482	And the blue lines tie together
381.475	the people that were present
381.475	in that network year after year.
385.117	So even though there's no leader per se,
387.169	these people are probably the most
387.169	influential ones in that organization,
390.828	the ones that know more about the past,
392.86	and the future plans and goals
392.86	of this particular cell.
397.232	We can also see this shift
397.232	from trees into networks
400.262	in the way we classify
400.262	and organize species.
405.245	The image on the right
405.245	is the only illustration
408.098	that Darwin included
408.098	"in ""The Origin of Species,"""
411.234	"which Darwin called the ""Tree of Life."""
414.098	There's actually a letter
414.098	from Darwin to the publisher,
417.007	expanding on the importance
417.007	of this particular diagram.
419.687	It was critical for Darwin's
419.687	theory of evolution.
423.408	But recently, scientists discovered
423.408	that overlaying this tree of life
426.999	is a dense network of bacteria,
429.458	and these bacteria
429.458	are actually tying together
431.643	species that were completely
431.643	separated before,
433.839	to what scientists are now calling
433.839	not the tree of life,
436.943	but the web of life, the network of life.
441.489	And finally, we can really
441.489	see this shift, again,
444.027	when we look at ecosystems
444.027	around our planet.
447.599	No more do we have these simplified
447.599	predator-versus-prey diagrams
450.789	we have all learned at school.
453.201	This is a much more accurate
453.201	depiction of an ecosystem.
456.214	This is a diagram created
456.214	by Professor David Lavigne,
459.142	mapping close to 100 species
459.142	that interact with the codfish
462.666	off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.
466.244	And I think here, we can really understand
466.244	the intricate and interdependent nature
470.205	of most ecosystems
470.205	that abound on our planet.
474.442	But even though recent,
474.442	this metaphor of the network,
478.11	is really already adopting
478.11	various shapes and forms,
481.237	and it's almost becoming
481.237	a growing visual taxonomy.
483.724	It's almost becoming
483.724	the syntax of a new language.
486.395	And this is one aspect
486.395	that truly fascinates me.
489.678	And these are actually
492.235	I've been collecting over time,
494.394	and it really shows the immense
494.394	visual diversity of this new metaphor.
499.001	And here is an example.
500.818	On the very top band,
500.818	you have radial convergence,
504.775	a visualization model that has become
504.775	really popular over the last five years.
509.198	At the top left, the very first project
509.198	is a gene network,
513.576	followed by a network
513.576	of IP addresses -- machines, servers --
517.609	followed by a network of Facebook friends.
521.24	You probably couldn't find
521.24	more disparate topics,
523.772	yet they are using the same metaphor,
523.772	the same visual model,
527.59	to map the never-ending complexities
527.59	of its own subject.
532.545	And here are a few more examples
532.545	of the many I've been collecting,
535.693	of this growing visual
535.693	taxonomy of networks.
540.248	But networks are not just
540.248	a scientific metaphor.
544.192	As designers, researchers, and scientists
544.192	try to map a variety of complex systems,
549.757	they are in many ways influencing
549.757	traditional art fields,
552.594	like painting and sculpture,
554.02	and influencing many different artists.
556.718	And perhaps because networks have
556.718	this huge aesthetical force to them --
560.784	they're immensely gorgeous --
562.766	they are really becoming a cultural meme,
564.846	and driving a new art movement,
564.846	"which I've called ""networkism."""
570.544	And we can see this influence
570.544	in this movement in a variety of ways.
573.776	This is just one of many examples,
575.593	where you can see this influence
575.593	from science into art.
578.342	The example on your left side
578.342	is IP-mapping,
581.237	a computer-generated map of IP addresses;
581.237	again -- servers, machines.
585.253	And on your right side,
586.482	"you have ""Transient Structures"
586.482	"and Unstable Networks"" by Sharon Molloy,"
591.124	using oil and enamel on canvas.
593.87	And here are a few more
593.87	paintings by Sharon Molloy,
596.999	some gorgeous, intricate paintings.
600.375	And here's another example
600.375	of that interesting cross-pollination
603.705	between science and art.
605.475	On your left side,
605.475	"you have ""Operation Smile."""
608.164	It is a computer-generated map
608.164	of a social network.
611.077	And on your right side,
611.077	"you have ""Field 4,"" by Emma McNally,"
614.827	using only graphite on paper.
617.374	Emma McNally is one of the main
617.374	leaders of this movement,
620.915	and she creates these striking,
620.915	imaginary landscapes,
623.508	where you can really notice the influence
623.508	from traditional network visualization.
630.324	But networkism doesn't happen
630.324	only in two dimensions.
633.355	This is perhaps
633.355	one of my favorite projects
635.657	of this new movement.
637.086	And I think the title really
637.086	says it all -- it's called:
639.744	"""Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,"
641.935	Like Droplets Along the Strands
641.935	"of a Spider's Web."""
646.616	And I just find this particular project
646.616	to be immensely powerful.
649.72	It was created by Tomás Saraceno,
651.704	and he occupies these large spaces,
654.426	creates these massive installations
654.426	using only elastic ropes.
657.792	As you actually navigate that space
657.792	and bounce along those elastic ropes,
661.633	the entire network kind of shifts,
661.633	almost like a real organic network would.
667.414	And here's yet another example
669.47	of networkism taken
669.47	to a whole different level.
672.303	This was created
672.303	by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota
675.54	"in a piece called ""In Silence."""
677.834	And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno,
677.834	fills these rooms with this dense network,
683.213	this dense web of elastic ropes
683.213	and black wool and thread,
686.999	sometimes including objects,
686.999	as you can see here,
689.782	sometimes even including people,
689.782	in many of her installations.
695.374	But networks are also
695.374	not just a new trend,
698.089	and it's too easy for us
698.089	to dismiss it as such.
701.029	Networks really embody
701.029	notions of decentralization,
704.66	of interconnectedness, of interdependence.
708.303	And this new way of thinking is critical
710.803	for us to solve many of the complex
710.803	problems we are facing nowadays,
714.557	from decoding the human brain,
716.422	to understanding
716.422	the vast universe out there.
719.746	On your left side, you have a snapshot
719.746	of a neural network of a mouse --
724.259	very similar to our own
724.259	at this particular scale.
727.5	And on your right side, you have
727.5	the Millennium Simulation.
730.49	It was the largest
730.49	and most realistic simulation
733.262	of the growth of cosmic structure.
735.49	It was able to recreate the history
735.49	of 20 million galaxies
740.03	in approximately 25 terabytes of output.
744.081	And coincidentally or not,
745.518	I just find this particular comparison
747.415	between the smallest scale
747.415	of knowledge -- the brain --
750.142	and the largest scale of knowledge --
750.142	the universe itself --
752.995	to be really quite striking
752.995	and fascinating.
755.807	Because as Bruce Mau once said,
758.465	"""When everything is connected"
758.465	to everything else,
760.901	for better or for worse,
760.901	"everything matters."""
763.322	Thank you so much.
764.497	(Applause)
