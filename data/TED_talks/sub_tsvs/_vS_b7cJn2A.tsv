12.14	Some years ago,
13.731	I stumbled across a simple design exercise
17.175	that helps people understand
17.175	and solve complex problems,
20.78	and like many of these design exercises,
20.78	it kind of seems trivial at first,
24.867	but under deep inspection,
26.611	it turns out that it reveals
26.611	unexpected truths
29.331	about the way that we collaborate
29.331	and make sense of things.
32.662	The exercise has three parts
34.264	and begins with something
34.264	that we all know how to do,
36.749	which is how to make toast.
39.489	It begins with a clean sheet of paper,
39.489	a felt marker,
42.809	and without using any words,
42.809	you begin to draw how to make toast.
46.94	And most people draw something like this.
49.118	They draw a loaf of bread, 
49.118	which is sliced, then put into a toaster.
52.498	The toast is then deposited for some time.
54.744	It pops up, and then voila!
54.744	After two minutes, toast and happiness.
61.045	Now, over the years, I've collected
61.045	many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,
65.643	and some of them are very good,
67.403	because they really illustrate
67.403	the toast-making process quite clearly.
70.869	And then there are some that are,
70.869	well, not so good.
74.166	They really suck, actually, because
74.166	you don't know what they're trying to say.
79.344	Under close inspection,
81.271	some reveal some aspects of toast-making
81.271	while hiding others.
84.754	So there's some
84.754	that are all about the toast,
87.424	and all about the transformation of toast.
90.164	And there's others
90.164	that are all about the toaster,
92.764	and the engineers love to draw
92.764	the mechanics of this.
96.094	(Laughter)
97.504	And then there are others
97.504	that are about people.
99.875	It's about visualizing
99.875	the experience that people have.
103.723	And then there are others that are about
103.723	the supply chain of making toast
107.236	that goes all the way back to the store.
109.226	It goes through the supply chain
109.226	networks of teleportation
112.663	and all the way back
112.663	to the field and wheat,
115.89	and one all actually goes
115.89	all the way back to the Big Bang.
118.7	So it's crazy stuff.
120.904	But I think it's obvious
122.757	that even though these drawings
122.757	are really wildly different,
126.263	they share a common quality,
126.263	and I'm wondering if you can see it.
129.366	Do you see it? What's common about these?
131.743	Most drawings have nodes and links.
135.118	So nodes represent the tangible objects
135.118	like the toaster and people,
140.468	and links represent
140.468	the connections between the nodes.
143.974	And it's the combination
143.974	of links and nodes
146.807	that produces a full systems model,
148.92	and it makes our private
148.92	mental models visible
151.845	about how we think something works.
154.878	So that's the value of these things.
156.709	What's interesting about
156.709	these systems models
158.817	is how they reveal
158.817	our various points of view.
161.002	So for example, Americans
161.002	make toast with a toaster.
164.623	That seems obvious.
166.144	Whereas many Europeans
166.144	make toast with a frying pan, of course,
170.114	and many students make toast with a fire.
174.391	I don't really understand this.
174.391	A lot of MBA students do this.
177.61	So you can measure the complexity
177.61	by counting the number of nodes,
181.375	and the average illustration
181.375	has between four and eight nodes.
185.297	Less than that, the drawing seems trivial,
188.292	but it's quick to understand,
190.545	and more than 13, the drawing
190.545	produces a feeling of map shock.
195.618	It's too complex.
197.121	So the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.
199.664	So if you want to communicate
199.664	something visually,
202.294	have between five and 13 nodes
202.294	in your diagram.
206.021	So though we may not
206.021	be skilled at drawing,
208.725	the point is that we intuitively know
208.725	how to break down complex things
212.856	into simple things and then 
212.856	bring them back together again.
216.116	So this brings us to our second part of 
216.116	the exercise,
219.337	which is how to make toast,
220.913	but now with sticky notes
220.913	or with cards.
223.713	So what happens then?
226.041	Well, with cards, most people
226.041	tend to draw clear, more detailed,
229.462	and more logical nodes.
231.74	You can see the step by step
231.74	analysis that takes place,
235.317	and as they build up their model,
235.317	they move their nodes around,
238.549	rearranging them like Lego blocks.
241.129	Now, though this might seem trivial,
241.129	it's actually really important.
245.184	This rapid iteration of expressing
245.184	and then reflecting and analyzing
249.912	is really the only way
249.912	in which we get clarity.
253.263	It's the essence of the design process.
255.911	And systems theorists do tell us
257.62	that the ease with which
257.62	we can change a representation
261.182	correlates to our willingness
261.182	to improve the model.
265.447	So sticky note systems
265.447	are not only more fluid,
269.239	they generally produce
269.239	way more nodes than static drawings.
273.279	The drawings are much richer.
275.01	And this brings us
275.01	to our third part of the exercise,
277.575	which is to draw how to make toast,
277.575	but this time in a group.
281.509	So what happens then?
283.271	Well, here's what happens.
284.883	It starts out messy,
284.883	and then it gets really messy,
288.5	and then it gets messier,
290.125	but as people refine the models,
292.052	the best nodes become more prominent,
294.583	and with each iteration,
294.583	the model becomes clearer
297.16	because people build
297.16	on top of each other's ideas.
300.434	What emerges is a unified systems model
303.917	that integrates the diversity
303.917	of everyone's individual points of view,
308.057	so that's a really different outcome
309.977	from what usually happens 
309.977	in meetings, isn't it?
312.648	So these drawings can contain
315.62	but participants don't feel map shock
317.849	because they participate in the building
317.849	of their models themselves.
322.074	Now, what's also really interesting,
322.074	that the groups spontaneously mix
325.395	and add additional layers
325.395	of organization to it.
328.854	To deal with contradictions, for example,
330.864	they add branching patterns
330.864	and parallel patterns.
333.684	Oh, and by the way,
333.684	if they do it in complete silence,
336.907	they do it much better
336.907	and much more quickly.
339.663	Really interesting --
339.663	talking gets in the way.
342.205	So here's some key lessons
342.205	that can emerge from this.
345.897	First, drawing helps us
345.897	understand the situations
348.476	as systems with nodes
348.476	and their relationships.
351.748	Movable cards produce
351.748	better systems models,
355.388	because we iterate much more fluidly.
358.118	And then the group notes produce 
358.118	the most comprehensive models
361.332	because we synthesize
361.332	several points of view.
364.689	So that's interesting.
366.275	When people work together
366.275	under the right circumstances,
369.581	group models are much better
369.581	than individual models.
372.692	So this approach works really great
372.692	for drawing how to make toast,
377.639	but what if you wanted to draw
377.639	something more relevant or pressing,
381.528	like your organizational vision,
381.528	or customer experience,
386.636	or long-term sustainability?
388.94	There's a visual revolution
388.94	that's taking place
392.446	as more organizations
392.446	are addressing their wicked problems
395.859	by collaboratively drawing them out.
398.645	And I'm convinced that those who see
398.645	their world as movable nodes and links
403.267	really have an edge.
405.391	And the practice is really pretty simple.
407.469	You start with a question,
407.469	you collect the nodes,
410.371	you refine the nodes,
410.371	you do it over again,
413.459	you refine and refine and refine,
413.459	and the patterns emerge,
418.768	and the group gets clarity
418.768	and you answer the question.
425.07	So this simple act of visualizing
425.07	and doing over and over again
431.112	produces some really remarkable outcomes.
433.694	What's really important to know
435.581	is that it's the conversations
435.581	that are the important aspects,
439.271	not just the models themselves.
441.596	And these visual frames of reference
443.384	can grow to several hundreds
443.384	or even thousands of nodes.
447.982	So, one example is from
447.982	an organization called Rodale.
451	Big publishing company.
452.486	They lost a bunch of money one year,
454.622	and their executive team for three days
454.622	visualized their entire practice.
458.964	And what's interesting is that
458.964	after visualizing the entire business,
464.886	systems upon systems,
466.65	they reclaimed 
469.716	and they also moved from a D rating 
469.716	to an A rating from their customers.
474.734	Why? Because there's
474.734	alignment from the executive team.
478.329	So I'm now on a mission
478.329	to help organizations
481.742	solve their wicked problems
481.742	by using collaborative visualization,
486.456	and on a site that I've produced
486.456	called drawtoast.com,
489.474	I've collected a bunch of best practices.
492.678	and so you can learn
492.678	how to run a workshop here,
495.441	you can learn more about
495.441	the visual language
497.584	and the structure of links and nodes that
497.584	you can apply to general problem-solving,
502.5	and download examples of various templates
505.705	for unpacking the thorny problems
505.705	that we all face in our organizations.
510.998	So the seemingly trivial
510.998	design exercise of drawing toast
514.62	helps us get clear, engaged and aligned.
518.661	So next time you're confronted
518.661	with an interesting challenge,
521.609	remember what design has to teach us.
523.943	Make your ideas visible,
523.943	tangible, and consequential.
527.774	It's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,
530.932	and I believe it's an idea
530.932	worth celebrating.
534.082	Thank you.
535.902	(Applause)
