12.439	Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.
14.531	My job is that I lie to children,
18.589	but they're honest lies.
20.605	I write children's books,
22.373	and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,
25.601	"""We all know that Art is not truth."
28.787	Art is a lie that makes us realize truth
32.429	or at least the truth that is 
32.429	given us to understand.
35.127	The artist must know the manner whereby
37.237	to convince others of the 
37.237	"truthfulness of his lies."""
42.074	I first heard this when I was a kid,
44.932	and I loved it,
46.623	but I had no idea what it meant.
49.415	(Laughter)
50.992	So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here
52.889	to talk to you today about, though,
54.508	truth and lies, fiction and reality.
56.721	So how could I untangle
58.573	this knotted bunch of sentences?
61.1	And I said, I've got PowerPoint.
61.1	Let's do a Venn diagram.
64.527	"[""Truth. Lies.""]"
64.527	(Laughter)
67.02	So there it is, right there, boom.
68.78	We've got truth and lies
70.485	and then there's this little space,
71.557	the edge, in the middle.
73.118	That liminal space, that's art.
79.918	All right. Venn diagram. (Laughter) (Applause)
84.915	But that's actually not very helpful either.
87.941	The thing that made me understand
92.316	that quote and really kind of what art,
94.806	at least the art of fiction, was,
97.023	was working with kids.
98.463	I used to be a summer camp counselor.
100.723	I would do it on my summers off from college,
103.01	and I loved it.
106.389	It was a sports summer camp
108.148	for four- to six-year-olds.
109.982	I was in charge of the four-year-olds,
111.628	which is good, because
113.431	four-year-olds can't play 
113.431	sports, and neither can I.
116.78	(Laughter)
118.355	I play sports at a four-year-old level,
121.28	so what would happen is the kids would
124.997	dribble around some cones, and then got hot,
126.696	and then they would go sit underneath the tree
128.959	where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —
131.804	and I would just make up stories and tell them to them
134.349	and I would tell them stories about my life.
136.168	I would tell them about how, on the weekends,
137.911	I would go home and I would
137.911	spy for the Queen of England.
141.126	And soon, other kids
144.447	who weren't even in my group of kids,
146.287	they would come up to me, and they would say,
147.756	"""You're Mac Barnett, right?"
149.668	"You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."""
152.737	And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers
155.959	to come up and ask me that question.
158.389	In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,
160.662	but, you know, four-year-olds —
161.899	you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.
166.528	And I realized that the stories that I was telling
170.956	were real in this way that was familiar to me
174.453	and really exciting.
175.658	I think the pinnacle of this for 
175.658	me — I'll never forget this —
177.864	there was this little girl 
177.864	named Riley. She was tiny,
180.687	and she used to always take 
180.687	out her lunch every day
183.126	and she would throw out her fruit.
185.466	She would just take her fruit,
186.874	her mom packed her a melon every day,
188.222	and she would just throw it in the ivy
189.971	and then she would eat fruit snacks
192.284	"and pudding cups, and I was like, ""Riley,"
194.657	you can't do that, you 
194.657	"have to eat the fruit."""
197.713	"And she was like, ""Why?"""
199.53	"And I was like, ""Well, when"
199.53	you throw the fruit in the ivy,
201.362	"pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"""
205.254	which is why I think I ended up
207.256	telling stories to children and not
207.256	being a nutritionist for children.
212.875	"And so Riley was like, ""That will never happen."
214.763	"That's not going to happen."""
215.863	And so, on the last day of camp,
218.914	I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe
221.367	from the grocery store
223.393	and I hid it in the ivy,
225.495	and then at lunchtime, I was like,
226.946	"""Riley, why don't you go over"
226.946	"there and see what you've done."""
229.621	And — (Laughter) —
232.796	she went trudging through 
232.796	the ivy, and then her eyes
235.474	just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon
237.566	that was bigger than her head,
239.68	and then all the kids ran over 
239.68	there and rushed around her,
242.65	"and one of the kids was like, ""Hey,"
244.237	"why is there a sticker on this?"""
246.126	(Laughter)
249.35	"And I was like, ""That is also why I say"
251.819	do not throw your stickers in the ivy.
254.811	Put them in the trash can. It
254.811	"ruins nature when you do this."""
260.283	And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,
265.633	and she was so proud.
267.661	And Riley knew she didn't 
267.661	grow a melon in seven days,
272.505	but she also knew that she did,
275.441	and it's a weird place,
277.657	but it's not just a place that kids can get to.
280.402	It's anything. Art can get us to that place.
283.934	She was right in that place in the middle,
285.891	that place which you could call art or fiction.
289.316	I'm going to call it wonder.
291.381	It's what Coleridge called the
291.381	willing suspension of disbelief
294.01	or poetic faith,
295.69	for those moments where a
295.69	story, no matter how strange,
298.1	has some semblance of the truth,
300.14	and then you're able to believe it.
302.117	It's not just kids who can get there.
303.747	Adults can too, and we get there when we read.
306.436	It's why in two days, people will be
308.686	descending on Dublin to take the walking tour
312.22	of Bloomsday and see everything
312.22	"that happened in ""Ulysses,"""
317.825	even though none of that happened.
320.08	Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street
322.337	to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,
323.809	even though 221B is just a number that was painted
325.936	on a building that never 
325.936	actually had that address.
329.082	We know these characters aren't real,
330.807	but we have real feelings about them,
333.427	and we're able to do that.
334.471	We know these characters aren't real,
336.364	and yet we also know that they are.
339.682	Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,
343.338	and that's why I love writing for kids.
344.891	I think kids are the best audience
346.871	for serious literary fiction.
351.26	When I was a kid,
354.084	I was obsessed with secret door novels,
356.71	"things like ""Narnia,"""
357.871	where you would open a wardrobe
357.871	and go through to a magical land.
361.574	And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist
364.304	and I would look for them and try to go through them.
366.332	I wanted to live and cross over into 
366.332	that fictional world, which is —
370.076	I would always just open people's closet doors. 
370.076	(Laughter)
375.771	I would just go through my mom's boyfriend's closet,
378.548	and there was not a secret magical land there.
380.798	There was some other weird stuff that
380.798	I think my mom should know about.
383.386	(Laughter)
385.107	And I was happy to tell her all about it.
391.545	After college, my first job was working
395.683	behind one of these secret doors.
398.231	This is a place called 826 Valencia.
400.188	It's at 826 Valencia Street
402.28	in the Mission in San Francisco,
404.766	and when I worked there, there
404.766	was a publishing company
406.792	headquartered there called McSweeney's,
409.431	a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,
412.585	but then the front of it
414.79	was a strange shop.
416.36	You see, this place was zoned retail,
417.787	and in San Francisco, they were
417.787	not going to give us a variance,
420.903	and so the writer who founded
420.903	it, a writer named Dave Eggers,
423.79	to come into compliance 
423.79	"with code, he said, ""Fine,"
426.129	"I'm just going to build a pirate supply store."""
430.505	And that's what he did. (Laughter)
433.583	And it's beautiful. It's all wood.
435.534	There's drawers you can pull out and get citrus
437.464	so you don't get scurvy.
440.483	They have eyepatches in lots of colors,
442.631	because when it's springtime, pirates want to go wild.
445.331	You don't know. Black is boring. Pastel.
449.674	Or eyes, also in lots of colors,
451.67	just glass eyes, depending on how you want
453.475	to deal with that situation.
457.187	And the store, strangely,
460.312	people came to them and bought things,
464.324	and they ended up paying the rent
466.151	for our tutoring center, which was behind it,
468.215	but to me, more important was the fact
471.267	that I think the quality of work you do,
473.918	kids would come and get instruction in writing,
476.404	and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,
476.404	fictional space like this to go do your writing,
480.67	it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.
484.42	It's a secret door that you can walk through.
486.607	So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,
489.358	and it was my job to build the store down there.
492.84	So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.
496.4	"That's our motto: ""Whenever"
496.4	"you are, we're already then."""
499.24	(Laughter)
503.1	And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
507.857	Our friendly staff is ready to help you.
509.967	They're from all eras,
512.11	including just the 1980s, that guy on the end,
515.719	he's from the very recent past.
517.916	There's our Employees of the Month,
519.618	including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.
522.604	Some great people have come up through our ranks.
525.596	This is our kind of pharmacy section.
527.947	We have some patent medicines,
529.286	Canopic jars for your organs,
531.637	communist soap that says,
533.271	"""This is your soap for the year."""
533.271	(Laughter)
537.722	Our slushy machine broke
539.938	on the opening night and 
539.938	we didn't know what to do.
542.571	Our architect was covered in red syrup.
544.81	It looked like he had just murdered somebody,
547.284	which it was not out of the question
548.971	for this particular architect,
551.021	and we didn't know what to do.
552.607	It was going to be the highlight of our store.
553.639	So we just put that sign on it that said,
554.984	"""Out of order. Come back yesterday."""
554.984	(Laughter)
559.489	And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,
561.525	so we just left it there forever.
565.621	Mammoth Chunks. These things
565.621	weigh, like, seven pounds each.
569.934	Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad
572.134	and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.
576.712	Dead languages.
578.67	(Laughter)
581.37	Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.
584.45	And Viking Odorant, which
584.45	comes in lots of great scents:
587.59	toenails, sweat and rotten vegetables, pyre ash.
591.595	Because we believe that Axe Body Spray
593.703	is something that you should
593.703	only find on the battlefield,
595.366	not under your arms.
595.366	(Laughter)
599.56	And these are robot emotion chips,
601.544	so robots can feel love or fear.
603.771	Our biggest seller is Schadenfreude,
605.481	which we did not expect.
606.782	(Laughter)
607.793	We did not think that was going to happen.
610.24	But there's a nonprofit behind it,
612.501	and kids go through a door
612.501	"that says ""Employees Only"""
614.481	and they end up in this space
615.696	where they do homework and write stories
617.87	and make films and this is a book release party
620.33	where kids will read.
621.814	There's a quarterly that's published
623.716	with just writing that's done by the kids
625.145	who come every day after school,
626.202	and we have release parties
627.73	and they eat cake and read for their parents
630.677	and drink milk out of champagne glasses.
633.529	And it's a very special space,
636.777	because it's this weird space in the front.
639.996	The joke isn't a joke.
643.295	You can't find the seams on the fiction,
645.695	and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction
648.603	that's colonized the real world.
651.865	I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.
655.922	There's a term called metafiction,
658.162	and that's just stories about stories,
662.245	and meta's having a moment now.
663.82	Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s
665.845	with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,
668.522	but it's been around.
669.77	It's almost as old as storytelling itself.
673.311	And one metafictive technique
675.851	is breaking the fourth wall. Right?
677.645	It's when an actor will turn to the audience
680.895	"and say, ""I am an actor,"
681.961	"these are just rafters."""
684.552	And even that supposedly honest moment,
686.577	I would argue, is in service of the lie,
688.803	but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality
691.559	of the fiction.
693.246	For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.
695.395	If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,
697.529	I want fiction to escape
699.872	and come into the real world.
701.955	I want a book to be a secret door that opens
706.554	and lets the stories out into reality.
709.446	And so I try to do this in my books.
712.427	And here's just one example.
713.97	This is the first book that I ever made.
715.892	"It's called ""Billy Twitters"
715.892	"and his Blue Whale Problem."""
718.513	And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet
720.643	but it's a punishment
722.229	and it ruins his life.
724.704	So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.
727.516	(Laughter)
730.106	And he has to take it to school with him.
732.1	He lives in San Francisco —
733.454	very tough city to own a blue whale in.
735.985	A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.
740.419	This market's crazy, everybody.
742.927	But underneath the jacket is this case,
746.718	and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,
750.904	and there's an ad
752.284	that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial
755.527	for a blue whale.
757.426	And you can just send in a
757.426	self-addressed stamped envelope
760.42	and we'll send you a whale.
764.27	And kids do write in.
768.61	"So here's a letter. It says, ""Dear people,"
772.018	I bet you 10 bucks you won't send me a blue whale.
775.199	"Eliot Gannon (age 6)."""
777.676	(Laughter) (Applause)
782.838	So what Eliot and the other kids
784.96	who send these in get back
787.451	is a letter in very small print
787.451	from a Norwegian law firm —
790.376	(Laughter) —
794.337	that says that due to a change in customs laws,
797.698	their whale has been held up in Sognefjord,
799.905	which is a very lovely fjord,
801.129	and then it just kind of talks about Sognefjord
802.593	and Norwegian food for 
802.593	a little while. It digresses.
805.073	(Laughter)
808.767	But it finishes off by saying that
810.68	your whale would love to hear from you.
813.414	He's got a phone number,
815	and you can call and leave him a message.
819.714	And when you call and leave him a message,
822.29	you just, on the outgoing message,
824.281	it's just whale sounds and then a beep,
829.399	which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.
832.954	And they get a picture of their whale too.
834.934	So this is Randolph,
837.465	and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico
840.806	who was one of the first kids to ever call in,
845.088	and I'll play you some of Nico's message.
847.398	This is the first message I ever got from Nico.
851.53	(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.
853.769	I am your owner, Randolph. Hello.
857.803	So this is the first time I can ever talk to you,
861.279	and I might talk to you soon another day. Bye.
867.523	Mac Barnett: So Nico called back, like, an hour later.
870.11	(Laughter)
872.36	And here's another one of Nico's messages.
876.297	(Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph, this is Nico.
879.84	I haven't talked to you for a long time,
884.993	but I talked to you on Saturday or Sunday,
889.688	yeah, Saturday or Sunday,
891.938	so now I'm calling you again
894.953	to say hello and I wonder what you're doing right now,
899.869	and I'm going to probably call you again
902.805	tomorrow or today,
904.988	so I'll talk to you later. Bye.
909.184	MB: So he did, he called back that day again.
913.492	He's left over 25 messages for Randolph
917.373	over four years.
920.125	You find out all about him
922.216	and the grandma that he loves
923.852	and the grandma that 
923.852	he likes a little bit less —
926.207	(Laughter) —
928.4	and the crossword puzzles that he does,
930.827	and this is — I'll play you one 
930.827	more message from Nico.
934.607	This is the Christmas message from Nico.
937.91	[Beep] (Audio) Nico: Hello, Randolph,
940.273	sorry I haven't talked to you in a long time.
943.528	It's just that I've been so busy
946.194	because school started,
948.893	as you might not know, probably,
951.926	since you're a whale, you don't know,
955.807	and I'm calling you to just say,
960.487	to wish you a merry Christmas.
964.177	So have a nice Christmas,
968.778	and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.
975.651	MB: I actually got Nico,
977.175	I hadn't heard from in 18 months,
980.306	and he just left a message two days ago.
984.424	His voice is completely different,
986.85	but he put his babysitter on the phone,
990.35	and she was very nice to Randolph as well.
994.211	But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.
998.561	I would want anyone I was writing for
1002.287	to be in that place emotionally
1004.428	with the things that I create.
1006.664	I feel lucky. Kids like Nico are the best readers,
1010.365	and they deserve the best stories we can give them.
1013.96	Thank you very much.
1016.162	(Applause)
