25	I love trees, and I'm very lucky,
28	because we live near a wonderful arboretum,
31	and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife
34	and now, with my four-year-old,
36	and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.
39	The second school I was at had big trees too,
43	had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,
47	and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation
51	around it, around the playing fields.
53	One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,
57	and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;
61	I was abused; and this came out of the blue.
66	Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --
70	well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;
76	I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.
83	And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,
86	next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,
89	and we were on a human rights tour,
92	and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,
97	and, from my very privileged position,
100	this was the only reference point that I had.
104	And it was an amazing learning experience
106	because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,
109	you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,
112	it was something that happened to other people over there.
115	But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,
122	he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --
127	(Laughter) --
129	a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,
132	you know, just after I'd done the Biko song,
134	we're going to do a tour for Amnesty,
136	you have to be on it, and really that was the first time
139	that I'd been out and started meeting people
143	who'd watched their family being shot in front of them,
146	who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,
149	and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,
154	and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.
159	So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,
163	and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.
168	I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,
172	Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,
177	and it was an amazing experience.
180	And, once again, I got an extraordinary education,
184	and it was the first time, really,
186	that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,
190	and these human rights stories became very physical,
195	and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.
201	But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,
204	was that you could suffer in this way
207	and then have your whole experience, your story, denied,
213	buried and forgotten.
216	And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,
221	or a video or film camera,
224	it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.
231	And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours
235	and there was a decision then --
239	well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,
242	about trying to set up a division
244	that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.
249	It didn't really get anywhere,
250	and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,
253	OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,
256	or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,
260	then you can actually start doing something,
265	and campaigning, and being heard,
269	and telling people about what's going on.
271	So, WITNESS was started in '92
275	and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.
281	And we campaign with activist groups
287	and help them tell their story and, in fact,
291	I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,
295	and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,
298	and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,
302	this one isn't quite so good.
304	In the north of Uganda,
306	there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,
309	people who are not refugees in another country,
312	but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,
316	they have nowhere to live.
318	And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,
324	and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the --
332	now, what's it called?
334	I forget the name of the of the army --
336	it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe --
339	but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,
341	so if we could run the first video.

346	Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.
349	We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...
353	still exists back home.
359	"Text: ""Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda"""
370	Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.
377	At first, we were safe in the camp.
380	But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.
385	(Chanting)
388	Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.
392	Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.
398	Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.
401	The other soldier also came.
404	Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.
408	The other one carried Evelyn aside.
411	The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.
416	And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.
420	Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.
428	"They kept telling us, ""Tell the truth!"" as they beat us."
440	Woman: They insisted that I was lying.
445	At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.
450	I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.

465	Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.
474	Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,
478	whether physical or mental,
481	is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity
485	to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.
493	Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.
499	In my country, it was --
501	we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;
508	we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.
510	I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,
513	and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,
519	he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest,
525	that he was interrogated and tortured
529	and returned to the street four weeks later,
533	because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern,
536	and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,
540	and that may or may not be true --
544	I didn't think he was a liar, though.
547	And, I think, if we look around the world,
551	as well as the polar ice caps melting,
553	human rights, which have been fought for,
556	for many hundreds of years in some cases,
559	are, also, eroding very fast,
562	and that is something that we need to take a look at
566	and, maybe, start campaigning for.
570	I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones
575	and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed,
579	with their footage in California
582	to change the youth correction systems employed,
587	and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods
592	are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,
596	and that's questionable to start off.
598	And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,
604	excuse me, Mr. Gabriel,
606	would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?
610	No, not at all, no problem, take your time.
613	But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,
619	this is cruel and unusual punishment.
623	Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people
629	who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,
633	and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.
641	(Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated.
644	(Music)
648	Text: You can say a jury is corrupt.
653	You can say a person is lying.
660	You can say you don't trust newspapers.
666	But you can't say
672	what you just saw
675	never happened.
682	Help WITNESS give cameras to the world.
687	Shoot a video;
696	expose injustice;
702	reveal the truth;
707	show us what's wrong with the world;
712	and maybe
714	we can help
716	make it
718	right.
726	WITNESS.
732	All the video you have just seen was recorded by
734	human rights groups working with WITNESS.
737	(Applause)
742	PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation --
746	in a sense the small, portable, DV cam
748	was really what allowed it to come into being.
752	And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,
756	so that groups can communicate much more effectively,
758	campaign much more effectively,
760	but now we have the wonderful possibility,
766	which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,
770	because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast
775	all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us.
778	And so, the dream is that we could have a world
782	in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort
788	has a chance of getting their story uploaded,
792	being seen, being watched,
795	that they really know that they can be heard,
798	that there would be a giant website,
802	maybe, a little like Google Earth,
804	and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,
808	for the world's inhabitants. In a way
811	what this technology is allowing is, really,
814	that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,
818	that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS
821	or who's being beaten up, for the first time,
826	and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture --
830	if we can move that into these sort of fields,
833	I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.
840	There could be a new movement growing up,
844	rising from the ground, reaching for the light,
849	and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.
