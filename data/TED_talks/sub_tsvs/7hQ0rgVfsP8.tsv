17.17	Recently, I flew over a crowd
19.521	of thousands of people in Brazil
21.906	playing music by George Frideric Handel.
25.539	I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam,
28.543	again playing music by this same composer.
31.918	Let's take a look.
34.685	"(Music: George Frideric Handel, ""Allegro."""
34.685	Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)
53.888	(Video) Daria van den Bercken: I
53.888	live there on the third floor.
55.96	(In Dutch) I live there on the corner.
57.849	I actually live there, around the corner.
59.457	and you'd be really welcome.
61.133	Man: (In Dutch) Does that sound like fun?
61.133	Child: (In Dutch) Yes!
63.952	"[(In Dutch) ""Handel house concert""]"
88.722	(Applause)
100.236	Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real
102.154	magical experience for hundreds of reasons.
105.81	Now you may ask, why have I done these things?
108.33	They're not really typical for a musician's
110.692	day-to-day life.
112.913	Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music
116.463	and I wanted to share it with as many people
119.545	as possible.
121.829	It started a couple of years ago.
123.944	I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu
127.375	and browsing the Internet a little,
129.497	when I found out that Handel had written works
132.32	for the keyboard.
134.32	Well, I was surprised. I did not know this.
136.637	So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.
141.02	And what happened next was
142.92	that I entered this state of pure,
146.491	unprejudiced amazement.
149.36	It was an experience
151.7	of being totally in awe of the music,
154.827	and I had not felt that in a long time.
158.607	It might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.
162.76	The first piece that I played through
166.051	started like this.
169.845	(Music)
194.95	Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?
198.68	And I turned the page and what came next
201.714	was this.
203.672	(Music)
230.624	Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?
234.69	So within a couple of minutes,
237.39	and the piece isn't even finished yet,
239.55	I experienced two very contrasting characters:
243.645	beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.
247.267	And I consider these two elements to be
249.337	vital human expressions.
252.14	And the purity of the music makes you hear it
254.815	very effectively.
259.893	I've given a lot of children's concerts
262.233	for children of seven and eight years old,
265.371	and whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven,
269.185	even Stockhausen,
270.76	or some jazzy music,
273.752	they are open to hear it,
275.901	really willing to listen,
277.188	and they are comfortable doing so.
280.716	And when classes come in
282.25	with children who are just a few years older,
290.547	in reaching them like that.
292.64	The complexity of the music does become an issue,
296.307	and actually the opinions of others —
300.14	parents, friends, media — they start to count.
304.823	But the young ones, they don't question
307.331	their own opinion.
310.672	They are in this constant state of wonder,
313.664	and I do firmly believe that we can keep listening
317.354	like these seven-year-old children,
319.638	even when growing up.
322.112	And that is why I have played
324.261	not only in the concert hall
326.601	but also on the street, online, in the air:
330.93	to feel that state of wonder,
333.497	to truly listen,
335.679	and to listen without prejudice.
339.223	And I would like to invite you
341.349	to do so now.
350.862	"(Music: George Frideric Handel, ""Chaconne in G Major."""
350.862	Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)
557.733	(Applause)
563.96	Thank you.
565.906	(Applause)
