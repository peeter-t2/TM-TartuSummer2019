25	Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.
28	As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.
34	But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.
38	I wanted to visualize the story of life.
43	It's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,
45	and there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.
50	But there were also revelations.
52	And one of those I'd like to share with you today.
57	I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth
64	the way it was three billion years ago,
66	back before the sky turned blue.
71	There's stromatolites down there --
74	the first living things to capture photosynthesis --
78	and it's the only place they still occur today.
83	Going down there was like entering a time capsule,
88	and I came out with a different sense of myself in time.
94	The oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites
99	is what we all breathe today.
103	Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.
107	I hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.
112	It's a story about you and me, nature and science.
117	And with that said, I'd like to invite you for
122	a short, brief journey of life through time.
145	Our journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
153	solidifying into surface, molded by fire.
166	The fire gave way, Earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet.
177	The moon was closer; things were different.
182	Heat from within made geysers erupt -- that is how the oceans were born.
195	Water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.
209	Water is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.
216	And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.
228	But this planet is different -- it's roiling inside.
235	And where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.
241	It arises around cracks in the Earth.
245	Mud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.
253	Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...
263	Growing living structures under an alien sky ...
272	Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.
280	And they changed the atmosphere.
283	A breath that's fossilized now as iron.
291	Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
297	Life needs a membrane to contain itself
302	so it can replicate and mutate.
309	These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton
318	with skeletons of silicon ...
321	circuit boards of the future.
327	Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed
335	into more complex forms.
340	It grew as light and oxygen increased.
348	Life hardened and became defensive.
355	It learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.
370	Vision was refined in horseshoe crabs,
374	among the first to leave the sea.
379	They still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.
386	Scorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.
393	Fish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.
403	Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...
408	clinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.
420	True land plants arose, leafless at first.
426	Once they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.
432	The fundamental forms of ferns followed,
440	to bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.
444	Life flourished in swamps.
448	On land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.
456	Leatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.
465	It took time for life to break away from water,
469	and it still beckons all the time.
473	Life turned hard so it could venture inland.
481	And the dragons that arose are still among us today.
500	Jurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,
505	and the center of Brazil,
509	"where plants called ""cycads"" remain rock hard."
520	Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.
529	One early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
535	And others fly today like echoes of the past.
541	In birds, life gained new mobility.
553	Flamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.
564	Birds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.
569	Water lilies were among the first.
578	Plants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.
589	In Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,
598	and in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.
607	In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.
613	But when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.
619	Tropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
628	Fungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...
643	a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.
650	Co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.
661	When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.
665	Kiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.
674	Extinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.
682	An asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.
688	But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
697	When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
704	A world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]
711	tenrecs, accustomed to the dark.
715	New forms became bats. Civets.
725	New predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.
737	Grasslands created opportunities.
743	Herd safety came with sharpened senses.
748	Growing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.
761	Some mammals turned back to water.
765	Walruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.
775	And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
783	There are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;
791	a horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.
807	Primates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,
816	becoming lemurs not much later.
821	Learning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.
829	And forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.
839	So who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,
845	sisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.
854	We're molded by the same life force.
861	The blood veins in our hands
866	echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
871	And our brains -- our celebrated brains --
875	reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
879	Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.
887	And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
899	And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,
904	Mars is still not very far.
909	But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
914	And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb
918	for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel
924	is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.
931	The whole animal world today lives on a stockpile
935	of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly
938	through plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,
943	and vice versa.
947	This Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
952	"We call it ""atmosphere."" This is the icon of our journey."
962	And you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.
970	(Applause)
976	Thank you. Thank you.
