12.418	When my father and I started a company
15.156	to 3D print human tissues and organs,
18.432	some people initially thought we were a little crazy.
21.788	But since then, much progress has been made,
24.479	both in our lab and other labs around the world.
27.686	And given this, we started getting questions like,
30.953	"""If you can grow human body parts,"
33.68	"can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"""
39.06	When someone first suggested this to me,
41.502	quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,
44.456	but what I soon came to realize
46.559	was that this is not so crazy after all.
49.805	What's crazy is what we do today.
52.774	I'm convinced that in 30 years,
54.963	when we look back on today
56.685	and on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals
60.295	to make our hamburgers and our handbags,
63.198	we'll see this as being wasteful
65.38	and indeed crazy.
67.67	Did you know that today we maintain
70.782	a global herd of 60 billion animals
74.123	to provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?
79.699	And over the next few decades,
81.769	as the world's population expands to 10 billion,
84.529	this will need to nearly double
86.174	to 100 billion animals.
88.759	But maintaining this herd
90.368	takes a major toll on our planet.
92.667	Animals are not just raw materials.
96.286	They're living beings,
97.909	and already our livestock
99.827	is one of the largest users of land,
102.406	fresh water,
103.758	and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases
106.491	which drive climate change.
108.12	On top of this,
109.45	when you get so many animals so close together,
112.674	it creates a breeding ground for disease
115.144	and opportunities for harm and abuse.
118.727	Clearly, we cannot continue on this path
121.257	which puts the environment, public health,
125.08	and food security at risk.
127.522	There is another way, because essentially,
131.088	animal products are just collections of tissues,
135.374	and right now we breed and raise
137.798	highly complex animals
139.727	only to create products
141.418	that are made of relatively simple tissues.
144.133	What if, instead of starting with a complex
147.343	and sentient animal,
149.465	we started with what the tissues are made of,
153.013	the basic unit of life,
155.559	the cell?
158.04	This is biofabrication, where cells themselves
161.76	can be used to grow biological products
164.386	like tissues and organs.
166.278	Already in medicine,
167.976	biofabrication techniques have been used
170.179	to grow sophisticated body parts,
172.615	like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,
177.513	that have been successfully implanted into patients.
180.747	And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be
184.855	a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
189.621	And we should begin by reimagining leather.
195.431	I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
199.701	It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
204.604	Growing leather is also technically simpler
206.505	than growing other animal products like meat.
209.28	It mainly uses one cell type,
211.39	and it is largely two-dimensional.
214.515	It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
218.683	Until biofabrication is better understood,
221.781	it is clear that, initially at least,
223.966	more people would be willing to wear novel materials
228.017	than would be willing to eat novel foods,
230.652	no matter how delicious.
232.603	In this sense, leather is a gateway material,
235.71	a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.
240.782	If we can succeed here,
242.666	it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat
245.942	closer on the horizon.
248.706	Now how do we do it?
251.171	To grow leather, we begin by taking cells
254.443	from an animal, through a simple biopsy.
257.275	The animal could be a cow,
259.283	lamb, or even something more exotic.
261.98	This process does no harm,
264.032	and Daisy the cow can live a happy life.
266.934	We then isolate the skin cells
268.669	and multiply them in a cell culture medium.
271.538	This takes millions of cells
272.711	and expands them into billions.
275.83	And we then coax these cells to produce collagen,
278.444	as they would naturally.
279.871	This collagen is the stuff between cells.
282.2	It's natural connective tissue.
284.693	It's the extracellular matrix,
286.253	but in leather, it's the main building block.
289.462	And what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen
293.175	and we spread them out to form sheets,
295.152	and then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,
298.594	like phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,
302.123	which we then let mature.
303.977	And finally, we take this multilayered skin
307.189	and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,
311.112	we create leather.
313.288	And so I'm very excited to show you,
315.482	for the first time,
317.631	the first batch of our cultured leather,
321.641	fresh from the lab.
323.204	This is real, genuine leather,
326.783	without the animal sacrifice.
330.306	It can have all the characteristics of leather
333.484	because it is made of the same cells,
336.969	and better yet,
338.918	there is no hair to remove,
342.793	no scars or insect's bites,
345.326	and no waste.
346.766	This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,
350.19	a handbag or a car seat.
353.276	It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow
356.492	or an alligator.
359.322	And because we make this material,
361.876	we grow this leather from the ground up,
364.158	we can control its properties in very interesting ways.
367.191	This piece of leather
369.726	is a mere seven tissue layers thick,
373.244	and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
377.047	And this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.
386.214	You don't have that kind of fine control
389.224	with conventional leather.
391.513	And we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,
394.758	like softness, breathability,
398.523	durability, elasticity and even things like pattern.
403.72	We can mimic nature,
405.891	but in some ways also improve upon it.
409.179	This type of leather can do what today's leather does,
413.177	but with imagination, probably much more.
416.618	What could the future of animal products look like?
420.847	It need not look like this,
423.206	which is actually the state of the art today.
425.939	Rather, it could be much more like this.
428.931	Already, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures
431.164	for thousands of years, beginning with products
433.929	like wine, beer and yogurt.
436.558	And speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,
439.892	and today we prepare cultured food
442.153	in beautiful, sterile facilities like this.
444.471	A brewery is essentially a bioreactor.
447.671	It is where cell culture takes place.
450.44	Imagine that in this facility,
452.985	instead of brewing beer,
454.731	we were brewing leather
457.312	or meat.
460.009	Imagine touring this facility,
462.654	learning about how the leather or meat is cultured,
466.385	seeing the process from beginning to end,
469.146	and even trying some.
470.542	It's clean, open and educational,
473.648	and this is in contrast to the hidden,
476.068	guarded and remote factories
478.146	where leather and meat is produced today.
481.627	Perhaps biofabrication
484.454	is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.
488.734	It's environmentally responsible,
491.187	efficient and humane.
494.349	It allows us to be creative.
496.543	We can design new materials, new products,
499.763	and new facilities.
502.962	We need to move past just killing animals
506.802	as a resource
508.635	to something more civilized and evolved.
514.556	Perhaps we are ready for something
517.241	literally and figuratively more cultured.
522.826	Thank you.
524.207	(Applause)
