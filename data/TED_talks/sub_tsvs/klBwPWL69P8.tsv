12.539	I know this is going to sound strange,
15.382	but I think robots can inspire us
15.382	to be better humans.
21.245	See, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
24.363	the home of Bethlehem Steel.
26.991	My father was an engineer,
29.127	and when I was growing up,
29.127	he would teach me how things worked.
33.47	We would build projects together,
35.588	like model rockets and slot cars.
38.732	Here's the go-kart that we built together.
42.208	That's me behind the wheel,
43.976	with my sister and my best
43.976	friend at the time.
47.875	And one day,
49.825	he came home, when I was
49.825	about 10 years old,
52.932	and at the dinner table, he announced
55.582	that for our next project, 
55.582	we were going to build ...
59.318	a robot.
61.604	A robot.
63.12	Now, I was thrilled about this,
65.207	because at school,
65.207	there was a bully named Kevin,
69.033	and he was picking on me,
70.946	because I was the only
70.946	Jewish kid in class.
73.91	So I couldn't wait to get
73.91	started to work on this,
76.307	so I could introduce Kevin to my robot.
78.941	(Laughter)
79.995	(Robot noises)
89.552	(Laughter)
90.968	But that wasn't the kind of robot
90.968	my dad had in mind.
94.841	(Laughter)
95.933	See, he owned a chromium-plating company,
99.589	and they had to move heavy steel parts
99.589	between tanks of chemicals.
105.486	And so he needed
105.486	an industrial robot like this,
108.883	that could basically do the heavy lifting.
111.684	But my dad didn't get
111.684	the kind of robot he wanted, either.
115.87	He and I worked on it for several years,
118.324	but it was the 1970s, and the technology
118.324	that was available to amateurs
123.093	just wasn't there yet.
125.992	So Dad continued to do
125.992	this kind of work by hand.
129.595	And a few years later,
131.73	he was diagnosed with cancer.
135.822	You see,
137.416	what the robot we were trying
137.416	to build was telling him
140.036	was not about doing the heavy lifting.
142.216	It was a warning
143.391	about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.
147.184	He didn't recognize that at the time,
149.501	and he contracted leukemia.
151.827	And he died at the age of 45.
155.354	I was devastated by this.
157.703	And I never forgot the robot
157.703	that he and I tried to build.
162.195	When I was at college, I decided
162.195	to study engineering, like him.
167.081	And I went to Carnegie Mellon,
167.081	and I earned my PhD in robotics.
171.653	I've been studying robots ever since.
174.721	So what I'd like to tell you about
174.721	are four robot projects,
179.34	and how they've inspired me
179.34	to be a better human.
186.206	By 1993, I was a young professor at USC,
191.844	and I was just building up
191.844	my own robotics lab,
194.686	and this was the year
194.686	the World Wide Web came out.
198.487	And I remember my students
198.487	were the ones who told me about it,
201.496	and we would -- we were just amazed.
203.837	We started playing with this,
203.837	and that afternoon,
207.244	we realized that we could use
207.244	this new, universal interface
211.546	to allow anyone in the world
211.546	to operate the robot in our lab.
217.339	So, rather than have it fight
217.339	or do industrial work,
222.413	we decided to build a planter,
224.967	put the robot into the center of it,
226.942	and we called it the Telegarden.
229.736	And we had put a camera
229.736	in the gripper of the hand of the robot,
234.277	and we wrote some
234.277	special scripts and software,
237.232	so that anyone in the world could come in,
239.29	and by clicking on the screen,
241.098	they could move the robot around
241.098	and visit the garden.
245.416	But we also set up some other software
249.291	that lets you participate
249.291	and help us water the garden, remotely.
253.643	And if you watered it a few times,
255.956	we'd give you your own seed to plant.
259.167	Now, this was an engineering project,
262.667	and we published some papers
262.667	on the system design of it,
266.803	but we also thought of it
266.803	as an art installation.
270.638	It was invited, after the first year,
272.811	by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,
275.855	to have it installed in their lobby.
279.558	And I'm happy to say, it remained
279.558	online there, 24 hours a day,
283.569	for almost nine years.
286.369	That robot was operated by more people
290.168	than any other robot in history.
293.303	Now, one day,
294.954	I got a call out of the blue
294.954	from a student,
299.211	who asked a very simple
299.211	but profound question.
304.361	"He said, ""Is the robot real?"""
308.599	Now, everyone else had assumed it was,
310.909	and we knew it was,
310.909	because we were working with it.
313.449	But I knew what he meant,
314.871	because it would be possible
316.337	to take a bunch of pictures
316.337	of flowers in a garden
319.146	and then, basically, index them
319.146	in a computer system,
322.809	such that it would appear
322.809	that there was a real robot,
325.46	when there wasn't.
327.088	And the more I thought about it,
328.636	I couldn't think of a good answer
328.636	for how he could tell the difference.
332.628	This was right about the time
332.628	that I was offered a position
335.449	here at Berkeley.
336.774	And when I got here,
338.443	I looked up Hubert Dreyfus,
340.829	who's a world-renowned
340.829	professor of philosophy,
344.582	And I talked with him
344.582	about this and he said,
347.336	"""This is one of the oldest"
347.336	and most central problems in philosophy.
351.462	It goes back to the Skeptics
351.462	and up through Descartes.
355.503	It's the issue of epistemology,
358.709	the study of how do we know
358.709	"that something is true."""
362.625	So he and I started working together,
364.649	and we coined a new term:
364.649	"""telepistemology,"""
368.757	the study of knowledge at a distance.
371.303	We invited leading artists,
371.303	engineers and philosophers
375.818	to write essays about this,
377.161	and the results are collected
377.161	in this book from MIT Press.
381.959	So thanks to this student,
384.079	who questioned what everyone else
384.079	had assumed to be true,
387.422	this project taught me
387.422	an important lesson about life,
391.423	which is to always question assumptions.
395.807	Now, the second project
395.807	I'll tell you about
398.007	grew out of the Telegarden.
400.023	As it was operating, my students
400.023	and I were very interested
402.868	in how people were interacting
402.868	with each other,
405.233	and what they were doing with the garden.
407.314	So we started thinking:
408.489	what if the robot could leave the garden
410.481	and go out into some other
410.481	interesting environment?
413.319	Like, for example,
413.319	what if it could go to a dinner party
416.084	at the White House?
417.569	(Laughter)
420.401	So, because we were interested
420.401	more in the system design
423.994	and the user interface
423.994	than in the hardware,
426.961	we decided that,
428.136	rather than have a robot replace
428.136	the human to go to the party,
432.647	we'd have a human replace the robot.
435.679	We called it the Tele-Actor.
437.978	We got a human,
440.01	someone who's very
440.01	outgoing and gregarious,
443.142	and she was outfitted with a helmet
443.142	with various equipment,
447.421	cameras and microphones,
448.729	and then a backpack with wireless
448.729	Internet connection.
452.882	And the idea was that she could go
455.05	into a remote and interesting environment,
457.524	and then over the Internet,
459.565	people could experience
459.565	what she was experiencing.
462.736	So they could see what she was seeing,
465.731	but then, more importantly,
465.731	they could participate,
469.038	by interacting with each other
469.038	and coming up with ideas
473.812	about what she should do next
473.812	and where she should go,
477.805	and then conveying those
477.805	to the Tele-Actor.
481.069	So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor
483.514	to the Webby Awards in San Francisco.
487.129	And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.
492.29	Just before the curtain went
492.29	up, I had about 30 seconds
495.004	to explain to Mr. Donaldson
495.004	what we were going to do.
500.119	"And I said, ""The Tele-Actor"
500.119	is going to be joining you onstage.
503.66	This is a new experimental project,
506.038	and people are watching her
506.038	on their screens,
508.657	there's cameras involved
508.657	and there's microphones
511.972	and she's got an earbud in her ear,
513.782	and people over the network
513.782	are giving her advice
516.123	"about what to do next."""
517.305	"And he said, ""Wait a second."
519.806	"That's what I do."""
521.003	(Laughter)
526.004	So he loved the concept,
527.9	and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,
527.9	she walked right up to him,
532.177	and she gave him a big kiss
532.177	right on the lips.
534.66	(Laughter)
536.636	We were totally surprised --
536.636	we had no idea that would happen.
539.582	And he was great, he just gave her
539.582	a big hug in return,
542.224	and it worked out great.
543.905	But that night, as we were packing up,
545.969	I asked the Tele-Actor,
545.969	how did the Tele-Directors decide
550.548	that they would give
550.548	a kiss to Sam Donaldson?
555.135	And she said they hadn't.
557.274	She said, when she was
557.274	just about to walk onstage,
559.916	the Tele-Directors still were trying
559.916	to agree on what to do,
562.914	and so she just walked onstage
562.914	and did what felt most natural.
566.038	(Laughter)
570.576	So, the success
570.576	of the Tele-Actor that night
573.692	was due to the fact
573.692	that she was a wonderful actor.
577.969	She knew when to trust her instincts.
580.422	And so that project taught me
580.422	another lesson about life,
584.375	which is that, when in doubt, improvise.
588.046	(Laughter)
590.664	Now, the third project
590.664	grew out of my experience
595.607	when my father was in the hospital.
599.284	He was undergoing a treatment --
599.284	chemotherapy treatments --
602.661	and there's a related treatment
602.661	called brachytherapy,
606.955	where tiny, radioactive seeds
606.955	are placed into the body
610.767	to treat cancerous tumors.
613.572	And the way it's done,
613.572	as you can see here,
615.867	is that surgeons
615.867	insert needles into the body
620.258	to deliver the seeds.
621.974	And all these needles
621.974	are inserted in parallel.
626.445	So it's very common that some
626.445	of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.
632.635	And as a result, the needles damage
632.635	these organs, cause damage,
639.632	which leads to trauma and side effects.
642.581	So my students and I wondered:
644.249	what if we could modify the system,
648.795	so that the needles
648.795	could come in at different angles?
652.395	So we simulated this;
654.262	we developed some optimization
654.262	algorithms and we simulated this.
657.731	And we were able to show
658.906	that we are able to avoid
658.906	the delicate organs,
661.492	and yet still achieve the coverage
661.492	of the tumors with the radiation.
667.313	So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF
670.811	and engineers at Johns Hopkins,
673.102	and we're building a robot
673.102	that has a number of --
677.088	it's a specialized design
677.088	with different joints
679.711	that can allow the needles to come in
679.711	at an infinite variety of angles.
684.483	And as you can see here,
684.483	they can avoid delicate organs
688.229	and still reach the targets
688.229	they're aiming for.
692.019	So, by questioning this assumption
692.019	that all the needles have to be parallel,
697.028	this project also taught me
697.028	an important lesson:
700.114	When in doubt, when your path
700.114	is blocked, pivot.
705.797	And the last project
705.797	also has to do with medical robotics.
710.187	And this is something
710.187	that's grown out of a system
713.781	called the da Vinci surgical robot.
717.866	And this is a commercially
717.866	available device.
720.334	It's being used in over 2,000
720.334	hospitals around the world.
724.013	The idea is it allows the surgeon
724.013	to operate comfortably
728.41	in his own coordinate frame.
732.762	Many of the subtasks in surgery are very
732.762	routine and tedious, like suturing,
738.555	and currently, all of these are performed
740.846	under the specific and immediate
740.846	control of the surgeon.
745.374	So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.
748.086	And we've been wondering,
749.546	what if we could program the robot
749.546	to perform some of these subtasks,
753.941	and thereby free the surgeon
755.346	to focus on the more complicated
755.346	parts of the surgery,
758.605	and also cut down on the time
758.605	that the surgery would take
761.429	if we could get the robot
761.429	to do them a little bit faster?
764.958	Now, it's hard to program a robot
764.958	to do delicate things like this.
768.943	But it turns out my colleague
768.943	Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,
773.173	has developed a new set of techniques
773.173	for teaching robots from example.
779.17	So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,
781.937	do incredibly interesting,
781.937	beautiful acrobatics,
785.215	by watching human experts fly them.
788.152	So we got one of these robots.
790.082	We started working with Pieter
790.082	and his students.
792.646	And we asked a surgeon
792.646	to perform a task --
798.761	with the robot.
799.936	So what we're doing is asking
799.936	the surgeon to perform the task,
802.985	and we record the motions of the robot.
805.045	So here's an example.
806.495	I'll use tracing out
806.495	a figure eight as an example.
810.17	So here's what it looks like
810.17	when the robot --
813.828	this is what the robot's path
813.828	looks like, those three examples.
816.92	Now, those are much better
816.92	than what a novice like me could do,
821.08	but they're still jerky and imprecise.
823.798	So we record all these examples, the data,
826.763	and then go through a sequence of steps.
830.278	First, we use a technique
830.278	called dynamic time warping
833.428	from speech recognition.
834.942	And this allows us to temporally
834.942	align all of the examples.
838.918	And then we apply Kalman filtering,
838.918	a technique from control theory,
844.144	that allows us to statistically
844.144	analyze all the noise
847.137	and extract the desired
847.137	trajectory that underlies them.
853.283	Now we take those human demonstrations --
855.857	they're all noisy and imperfect --
857.556	and we extract from them
857.556	an inferred task trajectory
860.178	and control sequence for the robot.
863.181	We then execute that on the robot,
865.521	we observe what happens,
867.57	then we adjust the controls,
868.951	using a sequence of techniques
868.951	called iterative learning.
873.129	Then what we do is we increase
873.129	the velocity a little bit.
877.244	We observe the results,
877.244	adjust the controls again,
881.34	and observe what happens.
883.136	And we go through this several rounds.
885.327	And here's the result.
886.968	That's the inferred task trajectory,
888.73	and here's the robot
888.73	moving at the speed of the human.
891.975	Here's four times the speed of the human.
894.477	Here's seven times.
897.004	And here's the robot operating
897.004	at 10 times the speed of the human.
902.762	So we're able to get a robot
902.762	to perform a delicate task
905.687	like a surgical subtask,
909.081	at 10 times the speed of a human.
912.185	So this project also,
914.469	because of its involved
914.469	practicing and learning,
917.018	doing something over and over again,
918.804	this project also has a lesson, which is:
921.405	if you want to do something well,
925.084	there's no substitute
925.084	for practice, practice, practice.
933.186	So these are four of the lessons
933.186	that I've learned from robots
936.697	over the years.
939.312	And the field of robotics
939.312	has gotten much better over time.
946.319	Nowadays, high school students
946.319	can build robots,
948.619	like the industrial robot
948.619	my dad and I tried to build.
952.675	But, it's very -- now ...
955.954	And now, I have a daughter,
959.857	named Odessa.
961.673	She's eight years old.
963.682	And she likes robots, too.
965.97	Maybe it runs in the family.
967.39	(Laughter)
968.654	I wish she could meet my dad.
972.303	And now I get to teach her
972.303	how things work,
975.067	and we get to build projects together.
977.321	And I wonder what kind of lessons
977.321	she'll learn from them.
982.147	Robots are the most human of our machines.
986.983	They can't solve all
986.983	of the world's problems,
989.961	but I think they have something
989.961	important to teach us.
994.276	I invite all of you
996.301	to think about the innovations
996.301	that you're interested in,
1000.712	the machines that you wish for.
1003.66	And think about
1003.66	what they might be telling you.
1007.211	Because I have a hunch that many
1007.211	of our technological innovations,
1010.98	the devices we dream about,
1014.166	can inspire us to be better humans.
1017.984	Thank you.
1019.159	(Applause)
