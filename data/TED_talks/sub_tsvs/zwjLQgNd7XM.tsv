16.45	For as long as I can remember,
18.45	I have felt a very deep connection
18.45	to animals and to the ocean.
23.069	And at this age, my personal idol
23.069	was Flipper the dolphin.
28.526	And when I first learned
28.526	about endangered species,
31.393	I was truly distressed to know
31.393	that every day,
35.107	animals were being wiped
35.107	off the face of this Earth forever.
38.655	And I wanted to do something to help,
38.655	but I always wondered:
41.686	What could one person possibly do
41.686	to make a difference?
45.542	And it would be 30 years,
47.577	but I would eventually get
47.577	the answer to that question.
51.389	When these heartbreaking
51.389	images of oiled birds
54.555	finally began to emerge
54.555	from the Gulf of Mexico last year
57.657	during the horrific BP oil spill,
60.006	a German biologist by the name
60.006	of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying,
64.114	"""We should just euthanize all oiled birds,"
66.822	because studies have shown
68.146	that fewer than one percent of them
68.146	"survive after being released."""
73.142	And I could not disagree more.
75.698	In addition,
77.009	I believe that every oiled animal
77.009	deserves a second chance at life.
80.984	And I want to tell you why
80.984	I feel so strongly about this.
84.464	On June 23, 2000,
86.521	a ship named the Treasure sank
86.521	off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa,
90.435	spilling 1,300 tons of fuel,
92.847	which polluted the habitats
92.847	of nearly half the entire world population
98.307	of African penguins.
100.344	Now, the ship sank
100.344	between Robben Island to the south,
103.477	and Dassen Island to the north --
105.851	two of the penguins' main
105.851	breeding islands.
108.26	And exactly six years
108.26	and three days earlier,
112.304	on June 20, 1994,
115.05	a ship named the Apollo Sea
115.05	sank near Dassen Island,
117.97	oiling 10,000 penguins,
117.97	half of which died.
122.514	Now when the Treasure sank in 2000,
124.335	it was the height
124.335	of the best breeding season
127.26	scientists had ever recorded
127.26	for the African penguin,
131.178	which at the time, was listed
131.178	as a threatened species.
134.169	And soon, nearly 20,000 penguins
136.927	were covered with this toxic oil.
139.362	The local seabird rescue
139.362	center, named SANCCOB,
142.443	immediately launched
142.443	a massive rescue operation,
145.519	and this soon would become
145.519	the largest animal rescue ever undertaken.
150.475	At the time, I was working
150.475	down the street.
152.562	I was a penguin aquarist
152.562	at the New England Aquarium.
155.388	And exactly 11 years ago yesterday,
159.472	the phone rang in the penguin office.
161.901	And with that call,
161.901	my life would change forever.
164.869	It was Estelle van Der Merwe
164.869	calling from SANCCOB,
167.493	"saying, ""Please come help."
169.354	We have thousands of oiled penguins
172.084	and thousands of willing
172.084	but completely inexperienced volunteers.
177.499	And we need penguin experts
177.499	"to come train and supervise them."""
181.126	So two days later,
182.634	I was on a plane headed for Cape Town
184.629	with a team of penguin specialists.
187.487	And the scene inside of this building
187.487	was devastating and surreal.
192.412	In fact, many people
192.412	compared it to a war zone.
195.833	Last week, a 10-year-old girl asked me:
198.994	"""What did it feel like"
198.994	when you first walked into that building
202.794	"and saw so many oiled penguins?"""
206.982	And this is what happened.
208.376	I was instantly transported
208.376	back to that moment in time.
213.122	Penguins are very vocal birds
213.122	and really, really noisy,
217.114	so I expected to walk into this building
219.635	and be met with this cacophony
219.635	of honking and braying and squawking.
223.611	But instead,
225.089	when we stepped through
225.089	those doors and into the building,
228.895	it was eerily silent.
232.566	So it was very clear
234.043	these were stressed,
234.043	sick, traumatized birds.
238.068	The other thing that was so striking
240.431	was the sheer number of volunteers.
243.383	Up to 1,000 people a day
243.383	came to the rescue center.
247.097	Eventually, over the course
247.097	of this rescue,
249.26	more than 12-and-a-half
249.26	thousand volunteers
252.713	came from all over the world to Cape Town,
255.056	to help save these birds.
256.659	And the amazing thing
256.659	was that not one of them had to be there.
261.278	Yet they were.
262.453	So for the few of us that were there
262.453	in a professional capacity,
265.782	this extraordinary volunteer response
265.782	to this animal crisis
269.26	was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring.
272.782	So the day after we arrived,
274.163	two of us from the aquarium
274.163	were put in charge of room two.
277.092	Room two had more
277.092	than 4,000 oiled penguins in it.
281.315	Now, mind you --
282.49	three days earlier,
282.49	we had 60 penguins under our care,
285.807	so we were definitely overwhelmed
288.144	and just a bit terrified --
288.144	at least I was.
291.092	Personally, I really didn't know
293.117	if I was capable of handling
293.117	such a monstrous task.
297.518	And collectively,
298.851	we really didn't know
298.851	if we could pull this off.
301.852	Because we all knew
301.852	that just six years earlier,
305.158	half as many penguins
305.158	had been oiled and rescued,
308.197	and only half of them had survived.
311.149	So would it be humanly possible
311.149	to save this many oiled penguins?
315.389	We just did not know.
317.741	But what gave us hope
319.064	were these incredibly dedicated
319.064	and brave volunteers,
322.483	three of whom here
322.483	are force-feeding penguins.
325.35	You may notice they're wearing
325.35	very thick gloves.
327.898	And what you should know
327.898	about African penguins
330.413	is that they have razor-sharp beaks.
333.365	And before long,
334.563	our bodies were covered head to toe
337.42	with these nasty wounds
337.42	inflicted by the terrified penguins.
341.41	Now the day after we arrived,
341.41	a new crisis began to unfold.
344.999	The oil slick was now moving
344.999	north towards Dassen Island,
348.226	and the rescuers despaired,
350.519	because they knew if the oil hit,
352.678	it would not be possible
352.678	to rescue any more oiled birds.
355.551	And there really were no good solutions.
357.559	But then finally,
358.734	one of the researchers
358.734	threw out this crazy idea.
361.703	"He said, ""OK, why don't we try"
361.703	and collect the birds
365.353	"at the greatest risk of getting oiled"" --"
367.352	they collected 20,000 --
369.119	"""and we'll ship them 500 miles"
369.119	up the coast to Port Elizabeth
373.75	in these open-air trucks,
375.077	and release them
375.077	into the clean waters there
377.284	"and let them swim back home?"""
379.316	(Laughter)
383.405	So three of those penguins --
383.405	Peter, Pamela and Percy --
386.747	wore satellite tags,
387.922	and the researchers crossed their fingers
389.925	and hoped that by the time
389.925	they got back home,
392.19	the oil would be cleaned up
392.19	from their islands.
394.439	And luckily, the day they arrived, it was.
397.384	So it had been a huge gamble,
397.384	but it had paid off.
401.327	And so they know now
401.327	that they can use this strategy
404.261	in future oil spills.
406.26	So in wildlife rescue as in life,
409.638	we learn from each previous experience,
411.804	and we learn from both
411.804	our successes and our failures.
416.034	And the main thing learned
416.034	during the Apollo Sea rescue in '94
420.463	was that most of those penguins
420.463	had died due to the unwitting use
424.866	of poorly ventilated
424.866	transport boxes and trucks,
428.182	because they just had not been prepared
430.108	to deal with so many
430.108	oiled penguins at once.
432.449	So in these six years
432.449	between these two oil spills,
435.387	they've built thousands
435.387	of these well-ventilated boxes.
438.744	And as a result,
438.744	during the Treasure rescue,
441.641	just 160 penguins died
441.641	during the transport process,
446.26	as opposed to 5,000.
448.261	So this alone was a huge victory.
451.02	Something else learned
451.02	during the Apollo rescue
453.279	was how to train the penguins
454.799	to take fish freely from their hands,
457.8	using these training boxes.
459.763	And we used this technique again
459.763	during the Treasure rescue.
463.26	But an interesting thing was noted
463.26	during the training process.
467.994	The first penguins to make
467.994	that transition to free feeding
471.476	were the ones that had
471.476	a metal band on their wing
474.44	from the Apollo Sea spill
474.44	six years earlier.
477.893	So penguins learn
477.893	from previous experience, too.
482.162	So all of those penguins had to have
482.162	the oil meticulously cleaned
485.938	from their bodies.
487.12	It would take two people at least an hour
487.12	just to clean one penguin.
491.947	When you clean a penguin,
493.26	you first have to spray it
493.26	with a degreaser.
495.49	And this brings me to my favorite story
495.49	from the Treasure rescue.
499.536	About a year prior to this oil spill,
502.151	a 17-year-old student
502.151	had invented a degreaser.
505.929	And they'd been using it
505.929	at SANCCOB with great success,
508.77	so they began using it
508.77	during the Treasure rescue.
511.443	But partway through, they ran out.
514.831	So in a panic, Estelle
514.831	from SANCCOB called the student
517.732	"and said, ""Please, you have to make more!"""
519.792	So he raced to the lab
521.069	and made enough to clean
521.069	the rest of the birds.
524.171	So I just think it is the coolest thing
526.979	that a teenager invented a product
530.541	that helped save the lives
530.541	of thousands of animals.
534.557	So what happened
534.557	to those 20,000 oiled penguins?
538.089	And was Silvia Gaus right?
540.126	Should we routinely euthanize
540.126	all oiled birds
543.546	because most of them
543.546	are going to die anyway?
545.802	Well, she could not be more wrong.
548.913	After half a million hours
548.913	of grueling volunteer labor,
553.26	more than 90 percent
553.26	of those oiled penguins
555.667	were successfully returned to the wild.
558.675	And we know from follow-up studies
560.889	that they have lived just as long
560.889	as never-oiled penguins,
565.02	and bred nearly as successfully.
567.742	And in addition,
568.917	about 3,000 penguin chicks
568.917	were rescued and hand raised.
572.77	And again, we know
572.77	from long-term monitoring
575.463	that more of these hand-raised chicks
575.463	survive to adulthood and breeding age
581.375	than do parent-raised chicks.
583.494	Armed with this knowledge,
583.494	SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project,
586.974	and every year, they rescue
586.974	and raise abandoned chicks,
589.974	and they have a very impressive,
594.522	This is critically important,
596.406	because one year ago,
598.858	the African penguin
598.858	was declared endangered.
602.208	And they could be extinct
602.208	in less than 10 years
606.038	if we don't do something
606.038	now to protect them.
608.943	So what did I learn
610.26	from this intense
610.26	and unforgettable experience?
613.464	Personally, I learned that I am capable
613.464	of handling so much more
617.052	than I ever dreamed possible.
618.812	And I learned that one person
618.812	can make a huge difference.
622.745	Just look at that 17-year-old.
624.777	And when we come together and work as one,
628.428	we can achieve extraordinary things.
631.226	And truly, to be a part of something
631.226	so much larger than yourself
635.226	is the most rewarding experience
635.226	you can possibly have.
639.863	So I'd like to leave you
639.863	with one final thought
642.275	and a challenge, if you will.
643.872	My mission as The Penguin Lady
643.872	is to raise awareness and funding
648.087	to protect penguins.
650.039	But why should any of you
650.039	care about penguins?
652.53	Well, you should care
652.53	because they're an indicator species.
656.26	And simply put: if penguins are dying,
656.26	it means our oceans are dying.
661.165	And we ultimately will be affected,
663.205	because, as Sylvia Earle says,
665.37	"""The oceans are our life-support system."""
668.26	And the two main threats to penguins today
670.76	are overfishing and global warming.
673.39	And these are two things
674.574	that each one of us actually has
674.574	the power to do something about.
679.272	So if we each do our part, together,
679.272	we can make a difference,
683.453	and we can help keep
683.453	penguins from going extinct.
686.882	Humans have always been the greatest
686.882	threat to penguins,
690.332	but we are now their only hope.
692.451	Thank you.
693.626	(Applause)
