26	I get asked a lot what the difference
26	between my work is
28.691	and typical Pentagon
28.691	long-range strategic planners.
32	And the answer I like to offer is
33	what they typically do is they think
33	about the future of wars
36	in the context of war.
38	And what I've spent 15 years
38	doing in this business --
41	and it's taken me almost
43.263	is I think about the future of wars
43.263	in the context of everything else.
48	So I tend to specialize
48	on the scene between war and peace.
52	The material I'm going to show
52	you is one idea from a book
55	with a lot of ideas.
56	It's the one that takes me
56	around the world right now
58.548	interacting with foreign
58.548	militaries quite a bit.
61	The material was generated
61	in two years of work I did
63	for the Secretary of Defense,
64	thinking about a new
64	national grand strategy
67	for the United States.
68.826	I'm going to present a problem
70.279	and try to give you an answer.
73	Here's my favorite bonehead concept
73	from the 1990s in the Pentagon:
77	the theory of anti-access,
77	area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
81	Why do we call it that?
82	Because it's got all those
82	A's lined up I guess.
90	This is gobbledygook for
92	if the United States fights
92	somebody we're going to be huge.
95	They're going to be small.
96	And if they try to fight us
96	in the traditional, straight-up manner
98	we're going to kick their ass,
99	which is why people don't
99	try to do that any more.
102	I met the last Air Force
102	General who had actually
105	shot down an enemy plane in combat.
107	He's now a one star General.
109	That's how distant
109	we are from even meeting an air force
113	willing to fly against ours.
115	So that overmatched capability
115	creates problems --
118	catastrophic successes
118	the White House calls them.
121	(Laughter)
124	And we're trying to figure that out,
126	because it is an amazing capability.
128	The question is, what's the good
128	you can do with it?
131	OK?
133	The theory of anti-access, area-denial
133	asymmetrical strategies --
137	gobbledygook that we sell to Congress,
139	because if we just told them
139	we can kick anybody's asses
142	they wouldn't buy us
142	all the stuff we want.
144.072	So we say, area-denial, anti-access
144.072	asymmetrical strategies
148	and their eyes glaze over.
150	(Laughter)
153	"And they say, ""Will you"
153	"build it in my district?"""
156	(Laughter)
158	(Applause)
162	Here's my parody and it ain't much of one.
163	Let's talk about a battle space.
164	I don't know, Taiwan Straits 2025.
166	Let's talk about an enemy embedded
166	within that battle space.
169	I don't know, the Million Man Swim.
171	(Laughter)
174	The United States has to access
174	that battle space instantaneously.
177.167	They throw up anti-access,
177.167	area-denial asymmetrical strategies.
181	A banana peel on the tarmac.
183	(Laughter)
184	Trojan horses on our computer networks
186	reveal all our Achilles' heels instantly.
189	"We say, ""China, it's yours."""
191	Prometheus approach, largely
191	a geographic definition,
194	focuses almost exclusively
194	on the start of conflict.
196	We field the first-half team in a league
198	that insists on keeping score
198	until the end of the game.
201	That's the problem.
203	We can run the score up against anybody,
205	and then get our asses
205	kicked in the second half --
207.453	what they call fourth generation warfare.
210	Here's the way
210	I like to describe it instead.
212.167	There is no battle space the U.S.
212.167	Military cannot access.
215	They said we couldn't do Afghanistan.
215	We did it with ease.
217	They said we couldn't do Iraq.
219	We did it with 150 combat
219	casualties in six weeks.
223	We did it so fast we weren't
223	prepared for their collapse.
227	There is nobody we can't take down.
230	The question is, what do
230	you do with the power?
232	So there's no trouble
232	accessing battle spaces.
234.215	What we have trouble accessing
234.215	is the transition space
237	that must naturally follow,
239	and creating the peace space
239	that allows us to move on.
243	Problem is, the Defense
243	Department over here
245.12	beats the hell out of you.
247.826	The State Department over here says,
249.565	"""Come on boy, I know you can make it."""
251.976	And that poor country runs off that ledge,
254	does that cartoon thing and then drops.
256	(Laughter)
262	This is not about overwhelming
262	force, but proportional force.
264	It's about non-lethal technologies,
266	because if you fire real ammo into a crowd
269	of women and children rioting
271.976	you're going to lose friends very quickly.
274	This is not about projecting
274	power, but about staying power,
276.882	which is about legitimacy with the locals.
279	Who do you access in this
279	transition space?
281.072	You have to create internal partners.
281.072	You have to access coalition partners.
284.716	We asked the Indians
284.716	for 17,000 peace keepers.
287	I know their senior leadership,
287	they wanted to give it to us.
290	"But they said to us, ""You know what?"
292	In that transition space you're
292	mostly hat not enough cattle.
295.826	We don't think you can pull it off,
297	we're not going to give you
297	"our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder."""
299	We asked the Russians for 40,000.
302	They said no.
303	I was in China in August, I said,
304	"""You should have 50,000"
304	peace keepers in Iraq.
307	"It's your oil, not ours."""
310	Which is the truth. It's their oil.
312	"And the Chinese said to me, ""Dr."
312	Barnett, you're absolutely right.
315.167	In a perfect world we'd have 50,000 there.
318	But it's not a perfect world,
320	and your administration isn't
320	"getting us any closer."""
324	But we have trouble
324	accessing our outcomes.
327	We lucked out, frankly, on the selection.
329	We face different opponents
329	across these three.
332	And it's time to start admitting
333	you can't ask the same 19-year-old
333	to do it all, day in and day out.
337	It's just too damn hard.
339	We have an unparalleled
339	capacity to wage war.
343	We don't do the everything else so well.
346	Frankly, we do it better than anybody
346	and we still suck at it.
348	We have a brilliant Secretary of War.
350	We don't have a Secretary
350	of Everything Else.
353	Because if we did, that guy
353	would be in front of the Senate,
355.882	still testifying over Abu Ghraib.
358	The problem is he doesn't exist.
361	There is no Secretary of Everything Else.
364	I think we have an unparalleled
364	capacity to wage war.
367	I call that the Leviathan Force.
369	What we need to build is a force
369	for the Everything Else.
371	I call them the System Administrators.
373	What I think this really represents
375	is lack of an A to Z rule set
375	for the world as a whole
377	for processing politically
377	bankrupt states.
379.072	We have one for processing
379.072	economically bankrupt states.
382	It's the IMF Sovereign
382	Bankruptcy Plan, OK?
386	We argue about it every time we use it.
388	Argentina just went through it,
388	broke a lot of rules.
390	They got out on the far end, we said,
390	"""Fine, don't worry about it."""
393.215	It's transparent. A certain
393.215	amount of certainty
396	gives the sense of a non-zero outcome.
398	We don't have one for processing
398	politically bankrupt states
400.882	that, frankly, everybody wants gone.
403	Like Saddam, like Mugabe,
403	like Kim Jong-Il --
407	people who kill in hundreds
407	of thousands or millions.
411	Like the 250,000 dead so far in Sudan.
415	What would an A to Z system look like?
417	I'm going to distinguish
417	between what I call
419.12	front half and back half.
422	And let's call this red line,
422	I don't know, mission accomplished.
426	(Laughter)
429	(Applause)
433	What we have extant right now,
435	at the beginning of this system, is the U.N.
435	Security Council as a grand jury.
437	What can they do?
438	They can indict your ass.
442	They can debate it. They can
442	write it on a piece of paper.
444	They can put it in an envelope
444	and mail it to you,
446.405	and then say in no uncertain
446.405	"terms, ""Please cut that out."""
451	(Laughter)
456	That gets you about four million dead
456	in Central Africa over the 1990s.
459.405	That gets you 250,000 dead
459.405	in the Sudan in the last 15 months.
463.826	Everybody's got to answer
463.826	their grandchildren some day
465	what you did
465	about the holocaust in Africa,
468	and you better have an answer.
473	We don't have anything to translate
473	that will into action.
477	What we do have is the U.S.-enabled
477	Leviathan Force that says,
480	"""You want me to take that guy down?"
480	I'll take that guy down.
483	I'll do it on Tuesday. It will cost
483	"you 20 billion dollars."""
486	(Laughter)
491	But here's the deal.
493	As soon as I can't find
493	anybody else to air out,
495.31	I leave the scene immediately.
497	That's called the Powell Doctrine.
501	Way downstream we have
501	the International Criminal Court.
503	They love to put them on trial.
503	They've got MiloseviÄ‡ right now.
505	What are we missing?
507	A functioning executive
507	that will translate will into action,
510	because we don't have it.
512	Every time we lead one of these efforts
514	we have to whip ourselves
514	into this imminent threat thing.
518	We haven't faced an imminent threat since
520	the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
522	But we use this language from a bygone era
523	to scare ourselves into doing something
526	because we're a democracy
526	and that's what it takes.
528.453	And if that doesn't work
528.453	"we scream, ""He's got a gun!"""
531.001	just as we rush in.
532	(Laughter)
540	And then we look over the body
541	and we find an old cigarette
541	lighter and we say,
543.31	"""Jesus, it was dark."""
545	(Laughter)
547	Do you want to do it, France?
549	"France says, ""No, but I do"
549	"like to criticize you after the fact."""
554	What we need downstream
554	is a great power enabled --
557	what I call that Sys Admin Force.
559	We should have had 250,000
559	troops streaming into Iraq
561	on the heels of that Leviathan
561	sweeping towards Baghdad.
564	What do you get then?
565	No looting, no military disappearing,
567	no arms disappearing,
567	no ammo disappearing,
569.072	no Muqtada Al-Sadr -- I'm
569.072	wrecking his bones --
571.335	no insurgency.
573	Talk to anybody who was over there
573	in the first six months.
575	We had six months to feel
575	the lob, to get the job done,
578	and we dicked around for six months.
580	And then they turned on us.
582	Why? Because they just got fed up.
584	They saw what we did to Saddam.
586	"They said, ""You're that powerful,"
586	you can resurrect this country.
588	"You're America."""
590	What we need is an international
590	reconstruction fund --
592	Sebastian Mallaby,
592	Washington Post, great idea.
594.263	Model on the IMF.
596	Instead of passing the hat each time, OK?
599	Where are we going to find this guy?
599	G20, that's easy.
602	Check out their agenda since 9/11.
604	All security dominated.
606	They're going to decide up front
606	how the money gets spent
608	just like in the IMF.
609	You vote according to how much
609	money you put in the kitty.
612.826	Here's my challenge
612.826	to the Defense Department.
614	You've got to build this force.
614	You've got to seed this force.
617	You've got to track coalition partners.
617	Create a record of success.
620.215	You will get this model.
622	You tell me it's too hard to do.
624	I'll walk this dog right
624	through that six part series on the Balkans.
628	We did it just like that.
630	I'm talking about regularizing
630	it, making it transparent.
632	Would you like Mugabe gone?
634	Would you like Kim Jong-Il,
634	who's killed about two million people,
636	would you like him gone?
639	Would you like a better system?
642	This is why it matters to the military.
644	They've been experiencing an identity
644	crisis since the end of the Cold War.
648	I'm not talking about the difference
648	between reality and desire,
651.072	which I can do because I'm
651.072	not inside the beltway.
653.477	(Laughter)
656	I'm talking about the 1990s.
657	The Berlin Wall falls. We do Desert Storm.
660	The split starts to emerge
660	between those in the military
662	who see a future they can live with,
664	and those who see a future
664	that starts to scare them,
666	like the U.S. submarine community,
668	which watches the Soviet
668	Navy disappear overnight.
670.405	Ah!
672	(Laughter)
674	So they start moving
674	from reality towards desire
678	and they create their own special language
680.024	to describe their voyage of self-discovery
680.024	and self-actualization.
683.191	(Laughter)
686	The problem is you need a big,
686	sexy opponent to fight against.
688	And if you can't find
688	one you've got to make one up.
690.501	China, all grown up, going to be a looker!
693	(Laughter)
697	The rest of the military got
697	dragged down into the muck
699	across the 1990s
700	and they developed this very
700	derisive term to describe it:
702.786	military operations other than war.
705	I ask you, who joins the military
705	to do things other than war?
707.977	Actually, most of them.
710	Jessica Lynch never
710	planned on shooting back.
713	Most of them don't pick up a rifle.
717	I maintain this is code
717	inside the Army for,
719.12	"""We don't want to do this."""
723	They spent the 1990s
723	working the messy scene
725.12	between globalized parts of the world
727	What I call the core and the gap.
732	The Clinton administration wasn't
732	interested in running this.
734	For eight years, after screwing
734	up the relationship on day one --
736	inauguration day with gays
736	in the military --
739	which was deft.
741	(Laughter)
743	So we were home alone for eight years.
745	And what did we do home alone?
747	We bought one military
747	and we operated another.
749.263	It's like the guy who goes
749.263	to the doctor and says,
751.668	"""Doctor, it hurts when I do this."""
754	(Laughter)
757	"The doctor says, ""Stop"
757	"doing that you idiot."""
760	I used to give this brief
760	inside the Pentagon in the early 1990s.
762	"I'd say, ""You're buying one military"
762	and you're operating another,
764	and eventually it's going to hurt.
764	It's wrong.
766.215	"Bad Pentagon, bad!"""
768	(Laughter)
770	"And they'd say, ""Dr."
770	Barnett, you are so right.
772.263	Can you come back next year
772.263	"and remind us again?"""
774.621	(Laughter)
780	Some people say 9/11 heals the rift --
782	jerks the long-term transformation gurus
785	out of their 30,000 foot view of history,
787	drags them down in to the muck and says,
787	"""You want a networked opponent?"
789	I've got one, he's everywhere,
789	"go find him."""
792	It elevates MOOTW --
792	how we pronounce that acronym --
795	from crap to grand strategy,
798	because that's how you're
798	going to shrink that gap.
800	Some people put these two things together
801	and they call it empire, which I think
801	is a boneheaded concept.
804.024	Empire is about the enforcement
804.024	of not just minimal rule sets,
807.001	which you cannot do,
808	but maximum rule sets which you must do.
810	It's not our system of governance.
812	Never how we've sought to interact
812	with the outside world.
814	I prefer that phrase
814	System Administration.
816.072	We enforce the minimal rule sets
818	for maintaining connectivity
818	to the global economy.
820.453	Certain bad things you cannot do.
825	How this impacts the way we think
825	about the future of war.
827	This is a concept which gets me
827	vilified throughout the Pentagon.
830.12	It makes me very popular as well.
832	Everybody's got an opinion.
834	Going back to the beginning
834	of our country --
836.167	historically, defenses meant
836.167	protection of the homeland.
840	Security has meant everything else.
843	Written into our constitution,
845	two different forces,
845	two different functions.
848	Raise an army when you need it,
850	and maintain a navy
850	for day-to-day connectivity.
855	A Department of War,
855	a Department of Everything Else.
859	A big stick, a baton stick.
863	Can of whup ass,
866	the networking force.
868	In 1947 we merged these
868	two things together
870.072	in the Defense Department.
872	Our long-term rationale becomes,
874	we're involved in a hair trigger
874	stand off with the Soviets.
877	To attack America is to risk
877	blowing up the world.
880	We connected national security
880	to international security
884	with about a seven minute time delay.
888	That's not our problem now.
890	They can kill
890	three million in Chicago tomorrow
892.263	and we don't go
892.263	to the mattresses with nukes.
895	That's the scary part.
897	The question is how do we reconnect
897	American national security
901	with global security to make
901	the world a lot more comfortable,
905	and to embed and contextualize
905	our employment
908	of force around the planet?
913	What's happened
913	since is that bifurcation I described.
916.826	We talked about this
916.826	going all the way back
918	to the end of the Cold War.
920	Let's have a Department of War,
920	and a Department of Something Else.
922	"Some people say, ""Hell,"
922	"9/11 did it for you."""
926	Now we've got a home
926	game and an away game.
928.072	(Laughter)
934	The Department of Homeland Security
934	is a strategic feel good measure.
938	It's going to be the Department
938	of Agriculture for the 21st century.
942	TSA -- thousands standing around.
945	(Laughter)
951.846	I supported the war in Iraq.
953.846	He was a bad guy with multiple priors.
955.846	It's not like we had to find him
957.846	actually killing somebody
957.846	live to arrest him.
962.846	I knew we'd kick ass in the war
962.846	with the Leviathan Force.
965.537	I knew we'd have a hard
965.537	time with what followed.
967.846	But I know this organization doesn't
967.846	change until it experiences failure.
971.846	What do I mean by these
971.846	two different forces?
974.846	This is the Hobbesian Force.
976.846	I love this force. I don't
976.846	want to see it go.
978.846	That plus nukes rules out great power war.
980.846	This is the military the rest
980.846	of the world wants us to build.
982.846	It's why I travel all over the world
982.846	talking to foreign militaries.
986.061	What does this mean?
988.846	It means you've got to stop pretending
990.846	you can do these two very disparate
990.846	skill sets with the same 19-year-old.
994.347	Switching back, morning,
994.347	afternoon, evening,
996.846	morning, afternoon, evening.
998.846	Handing out aid, shooting back,
1000.846	handing out aid, shooting back.
1002.846	It's too much.
1004.846	The 19-year-olds get tired
1004.846	from the switching, OK?
1007.846	(Laughter)
1009.846	That force on the left, you can
1009.846	train a 19-year-old to do that.
1012.87	That force on the right is more
1012.87	like a 40-year-old cop.
1015.846	You need the experience.
1018.846	What does this mean
1018.846	in terms of operations?
1022.846	The rule is going to be this.
1025.846	That Sys Admin force is the force
1025.846	that never comes home,
1028.846	does most of your work.
1030.846	You break out that Leviathan
1030.846	Force only every so often.
1033.846	But here's the promise you
1033.846	make to the American public,
1035.846	to your own people, to the world.
1037.846	You break out that Leviathan Force,
1039.846	you promise, you guarantee
1039.846	that you're going to mount
1042.846	one hell of a -- immediately
1042.846	-- follow-on Sys Admin effort.
1046.846	Don't plan for the war unless you
1046.846	plan to win the peace.
1049.537	(Applause)
1054.846	Other differences. Leviathan
1056.846	traditional partners,
1056.846	they all look like the Brits
1059.251	and their former colonies.
1060.846	(Laughter)
1062.846	Including us, I would remind you.
1064.846	The rest -- wider array of partners.
1066.846	International organizations,
1066.846	non-governmental organizations,
1068.846	private voluntary
1068.846	organizations, contractors.
1070.846	You're not going to get away from that.
1072.846	Leviathan Force, it's all about joint
1072.846	operations between the military services.
1076.632	We're done with that.
1077.846	What we need to do
1077.846	is inter-agency operations,
1080.846	which frankly Condi Rice was in charge of.
1082.87	And I'm amazed nobody asked her
1082.87	that question when she was confirmed.
1086.18	I call the Leviathan Force
1086.18	your dad's military.
1088.846	I like them young, male,
1088.846	unmarried, slightly pissed off.
1092.846	(Laughter)
1099.846	I call the Sys Admin Force
1099.846	your mom's military.
1102.109	It's everything the man's military hates.
1104.109	Gender balanced much more, older,
1104.109	educated, married with children.
1108.846	The force on the left, up or out.
1111.846	The force on the right, in and out.
1114.846	The force on the left respects
1114.846	Posse Comitatus restrictions
1117.846	on the use of force inside the U.S.
1119.846	The force on the right's going
1119.846	to obliterate it.
1121.846	That's where the National
1121.846	Guard's going to be.
1122.846	The force on the left is never
1122.846	coming under the purview
1124.846	of the International Criminal Court.
1126.846	Sys Admin Force has to.
1130.846	Different definitions
1130.846	of network centricity.
1133.846	One takes down networks, one puts them up.
1136.846	And you've got to wage war here
1136.846	in such a way to facilitate that.
1140.846	Do we need a bigger budget?
1142.846	Do we need a draft to pull this off?
1145.846	Absolutely not.
1149.846	I've been told by the Revolution
1149.846	of Military Affairs crowd for years,
1153.846	we can do it faster, cheaper,
1153.846	smaller, just as lethal.
1156.846	"I say, ""Great, I'm going to take the Sys"
1156.846	"Admin budget out of your hide."""
1160.846	Here's the larger point.
1162.846	You're going to build the Sys Admin
1162.846	Force inside the U.S. Military first.
1164.846	But ultimately you're going
1164.846	to civilianize it, probably two thirds.
1168.846	Inter agency-ize it, internationalize it.
1172.846	So yes, it begins inside the Pentagon,
1174.846	but over time it's going
1174.846	to cross that river.
1177.846	(Laughter)
1180.846	I have been to the mountain top.
1180.846	I can see the future.
1183.846	I may not live long enough to get you
1183.846	there, but it's going to happen.
1187.204	We're going to have
1187.204	a Department of Something Else
1189.609	between war and peace.
1190.846	Last slide.
1191.846	Who gets custody of the kids?
1193.846	This is where the Marines
1193.846	in the audience get kind of tense.
1196.728	(Laughter)
1202.846	And this is when they think
1202.846	about beating the crap out of me
1205.728	after the talk.
1206.846	(Laughter)
1207.846	Read Max Boon.
1209.846	This is the history of the marines
1209.846	-- small wars, small arms.
1211.846	The Marines are like my West
1211.846	Highland Terrier.
1213.846	They get up every morning,
1213.846	they want to dig a hole
1216.251	and they want to kill something.
1217.846	(Laughter)
1219.846	I don't want my Marines handing out aid.
1222.846	I want them to be Marines.
1225.846	That's what keeps the Sys Admin
1225.846	Force from being a pussy force.
1227.846	It keeps it from being the U.N.
1229.846	You shoot at these people the Marines
1229.846	are going to come over and kill you.
1231.846	(Laughter)
1234.846	(Applause)
1237.846	Department of Navy,
1237.846	strategic subs go this way,
1240.846	surface combatants are over there,
1242.846	and the news is they may
1242.846	actually be that small.
1245.156	(Laughter)
1247.846	I call it the Smart Dust Navy.
1249.846	"I tell young officers, ""You may"
1249.846	command 500 ships in your career.
1251.846	Bad news is they may not
1251.846	"have anybody on them."""
1256.846	Carriers go both ways
1256.846	because they're a swing asset.
1260.846	You'll see the pattern --
1260.846	airborne, just like carriers.
1263.846	Armor goes this way.
1265.846	Here's the dirty secret of the Air Force,
1266.846	you can win by bombing.
1268.846	But you need lots of these guys
1268.846	on the ground to win the peace.
1271.87	Shinseki was right with the argument.
1275.846	Air force, strategic
1275.846	airlift goes both ways.
1279.846	Bombers, fighters go over here.
1284.846	Special Operations Command down at Tampa.
1286.846	Trigger-pullers go this way.
1290.846	Civil Affairs, that bastard
1290.846	child, comes over here.
1293.846	Return to the Army.
1295.846	The point about the trigger-pullers
1295.846	and Special Operations Command.
1299.061	No off season, these
1299.061	guys are always active.
1301.846	They drop in, do
1301.846	their business, disappear.
1307.846	See me now. Don't talk about it later.
1309.846	(Laughter)
1313.846	I was never here.
1315.846	(Laughter)
1318.846	The world is my playground.
1320.846	(Laughter)
1324.846	I want to keep trigger-pullers
1324.846	trigger-happy.
1326.846	I want the rules to be
1326.846	as loose as possible.
1328.966	Because when the thing
1328.966	gets prevented in Chicago
1331.276	with the three million dead
1332.846	that perverts our political
1332.846	system beyond all recognition,
1335.632	these are the guys who are going
1335.632	to kill them first.
1338.323	So it's better off to have them
1338.323	make some mistakes along the way
1340.323	than to see that.
1341.846	Reserve component --
1343.846	National Guard reserves
1343.846	overwhelmingly Sys Admin.
1346.846	How are you going to get
1346.846	them to work for this force?
1348.846	Most firemen in this
1348.846	country do it for free.
1350.966	This is not about money.
1352.846	This is about being up front
1352.846	with these guys and gals.
1357.846	Last point, intelligence community --
1359.846	the muscle and the defense
1359.846	agencies go this way.
1363.846	What should be the CIA, open,
1363.846	analytical, open source
1366.846	should come over here.
1368.846	The information you need
1368.846	to do this is not secret.
1371.846	It's not secret.
1373.846	Read that great piece in the New Yorker
1374.846	about how our echo boomers,
1377.846	taught each other
1377.846	how to do Sys Admin work,
1380.846	over the Internet in chat rooms.
1382.846	"They said, ""Al Qaeda could be listening."""
1384.846	"They said, ""Well, Jesus,"
1384.846	"they already know this stuff."""
1387.49	(Laughter)
1389.846	Take a gift in the left hand.
1391.846	These are the sunglasses that don't
1391.846	scare people, simple stuff.
1397.846	Censors and transparency,
1397.846	the overheads go in both directions.
1400.846	Thanks.
