12.968	So this is my niece.
14.644	Her name is Yahli.
16.203	She is nine months old.
18.201	Her mum is a doctor,
18.201	and her dad is a lawyer.
21.269	By the time Yahli goes to college,
23.299	the jobs her parents do
23.299	are going to look dramatically different.
27.347	In 2013, researchers at Oxford University
27.347	did a study on the future of work.
32.766	They concluded that almost one
32.766	in every two jobs have a high risk
36.929	of being automated by machines.
40.388	Machine learning is the technology
42.317	that's responsible for most
42.317	of this disruption.
44.619	It's the most powerful branch
44.619	of artificial intelligence.
47.433	It allows machines to learn from data
49.339	and mimic some of the things
49.339	that humans can do.
51.955	My company, Kaggle, operates
51.955	on the cutting edge of machine learning.
55.394	We bring together
55.394	hundreds of thousands of experts
57.804	to solve important problems
57.804	for industry and academia.
61.279	This gives us a unique perspective
61.279	on what machines can do,
64.525	what they can't do
65.784	and what jobs they might
65.784	automate or threaten.
69.316	Machine learning started making its way
69.316	into industry in the early '90s.
72.89	It started with relatively simple tasks.
75.406	It started with things like assessing
75.406	credit risk from loan applications,
79.545	sorting the mail by reading
79.545	handwritten characters from zip codes.
84.036	Over the past few years, we have made
84.036	dramatic breakthroughs.
87.586	Machine learning is now capable
87.586	of far, far more complex tasks.
91.86	In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community
95.115	to build an algorithm
95.115	that could grade high-school essays.
98.328	The winning algorithms
98.328	were able to match the grades
100.956	given by human teachers.
103.092	Last year, we issued
103.092	an even more difficult challenge.
106.1	Can you take images of the eye
106.1	and diagnose an eye disease
109.077	called diabetic retinopathy?
111.164	Again, the winning algorithms
111.164	were able to match the diagnoses
115.228	given by human ophthalmologists.
117.561	Now, given the right data,
117.561	machines are going to outperform humans
120.797	at tasks like this.
121.986	A teacher might read 10,000 essays
121.986	over a 40-year career.
126.407	An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.
128.791	A machine can read millions of essays
128.791	or see millions of eyes
132.728	within minutes.
134.456	We have no chance of competing
134.456	against machines
137.338	on frequent, high-volume tasks.
140.665	But there are things we can do
140.665	that machines can't do.
144.791	Where machines have made
144.791	very little progress
147.015	is in tackling novel situations.
148.893	They can't handle things
148.893	they haven't seen many times before.
153.321	The fundamental limitations
153.321	of machine learning
155.929	is that it needs to learn
155.929	from large volumes of past data.
159.347	Now, humans don't.
161.125	We have the ability to connect
161.125	seemingly disparate threads
164.179	to solve problems we've never seen before.
166.808	Percy Spencer was a physicist
166.808	working on radar during World War II,
171.243	when he noticed the magnetron
171.243	was melting his chocolate bar.
174.97	He was able to connect his understanding
174.97	of electromagnetic radiation
178.289	with his knowledge of cooking
179.797	in order to invent -- any guesses? --
179.797	the microwave oven.
183.444	Now, this is a particularly remarkable
183.444	example of creativity.
186.541	But this sort of cross-pollination
186.541	happens for each of us in small ways
190.229	thousands of times per day.
192.501	Machines cannot compete with us
194.186	when it comes to tackling
194.186	novel situations,
196.461	and this puts a fundamental limit
196.461	on the human tasks
199.602	that machines will automate.
202.041	So what does this mean
202.041	for the future of work?
204.804	The future state of any single job lies
204.804	in the answer to a single question:
209.36	To what extent is that job reducible
209.36	to frequent, high-volume tasks,
214.365	and to what extent does it involve
214.365	tackling novel situations?
217.975	On frequent, high-volume tasks,
217.975	machines are getting smarter and smarter.
222.034	Today they grade essays.
222.034	They diagnose certain diseases.
224.772	Over coming years,
224.772	they're going to conduct our audits,
227.953	and they're going to read boilerplate
227.953	from legal contracts.
230.944	Accountants and lawyers are still needed.
232.965	They're going to be needed
232.965	for complex tax structuring,
235.671	for pathbreaking litigation.
237.052	But machines will shrink their ranks
238.793	and make these jobs harder to come by.
240.689	Now, as mentioned,
241.864	machines are not making progress
241.864	on novel situations.
244.837	The copy behind a marketing campaign
244.837	needs to grab consumers' attention.
248.318	It has to stand out from the crowd.
250.057	Business strategy means
250.057	finding gaps in the market,
252.525	things that nobody else is doing.
254.305	It will be humans that are creating
254.305	the copy behind our marketing campaigns,
258.447	and it will be humans that are developing
258.447	our business strategy.
261.988	So Yahli, whatever you decide to do,
264.829	let every day bring you a new challenge.
267.587	If it does, then you will stay
267.587	ahead of the machines.
271.126	Thank you.
272.326	(Applause)
