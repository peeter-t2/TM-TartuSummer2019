12.88	Is there life beyond Earth
12.88	in our solar system?
17.28	Wow, what a powerful question.
20.96	You know, as a scientist --
22.68	planetary scientist --
23.92	we really didn't take that
23.92	very seriously until recently.
28.4	Carl Sagan always said,
30.52	"""It takes extraordinary evidence"
30.52	"for extraordinary claims."""
36.96	And the claims of having life beyond Earth
41.24	need to be definitive,
43.56	they need to be loud
45.2	and they need to be everywhere
45.2	for us to be able to believe it.
50.76	So how do we make this journey?
54.04	What we decided to do
55.72	is first look for
55.72	those ingredients for life.
60.68	The ingredients of life are:
62.96	liquid water --
64.2	we have to have a solvent,
65.92	can't be ice, has to be liquid.
68.8	We also have to have energy.
70.76	We also have to have organic material --
73.8	things that make us up,
76.12	but also things that we need to consume.
79.6	So we have to have these elements
82.44	in environments for long periods of time
85.28	for us to be able
85.28	to be confident that life,
88.84	in that moment when it starts,
91.16	can spark and then grow and evolve.
95.08	Well, I have to tell you
95.08	that early in my career,
99.52	when we looked at those three elements,
101.8	I didn't believe
101.8	that they were beyond Earth
104.08	in any length of time
104.08	and for any real quantity.
108.2	Why? We look at the inner planets.
110.48	Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.
113.48	Mars -- dry and arid.
115.52	It's got no water.
117.08	And beyond Mars,
118.88	the water in the solar system
118.88	is all frozen.
123.12	But recent observations
123.12	have changed all that.
127.28	It's now turning our attention
127.28	to the right places
131.2	for us to take a deeper look
133.76	and really start to answer
133.76	our life question.
138.16	So when we look out into the solar system,
141.12	where are the possibilities?
143.2	We're concentrating our attention
143.2	on four locations.
147.32	The planet Mars
149.44	and then three moons of the outer planets:
153.24	Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.
158.88	So what about Mars?
160.64	Let's go through the evidence.
163.88	Well, Mars we thought
163.88	was initially moon-like:
167.48	full of craters, arid and a dead world.
172.88	And so about 15 years ago,
175.12	we started a series
175.12	of missions to go to Mars
178.76	and see if water existed
178.76	on Mars in its past
183.4	that changed its geology.
185.68	We ought to be able to notice that.
188.04	And indeed we started
188.04	to be surprised right away.
191.52	Our higher resolution images
191.52	show deltas and river valleys and gulleys
196.68	that were there in the past.
199.32	And in fact,
200.56	Curiosity --
201.8	which has been roving on the surface
201.8	now for about three years --
206.12	has really shown us that it's sitting
206.12	in an ancient river bed,
211.32	where water flowed rapidly.
214.28	And not for a little while,
215.76	perhaps hundreds of millions of years.
219	And if everything was there,
220.44	including organics,
221.8	perhaps life had started.
223.68	Curiosity has also
223.68	drilled in that red soil
226.6	and brought up other material.
228.6	And we were really excited
228.6	when we saw that.
231.28	Because it wasn't red Mars,
233.32	it was gray material,
234.96	it's gray Mars.
236.28	We brought it into the rover,
237.76	we tasted it,
239.4	and guess what?
240.88	We tasted organics --
242.92	carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
245.32	nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur --
247.84	they were all there.
249.24	So Mars in its past,
251.76	with a lot of water,
253.12	perhaps plenty of time,
255.12	could have had life,
256.56	could have had that spark,
258.56	could have grown.
260.32	And is that life still there?
262.64	We don't know that.
264.64	But a few years ago
266.08	we started to look at a number of craters.
269.44	During the summer,
270.68	dark lines would appear
270.68	down the sides of these craters.
274.72	The more we looked,
276	the more craters we saw,
277.48	the more of these features.
278.84	We now know more than a dozen of them.
282.2	A few months ago the fairy tale came true.
286.56	We announced to the world
286.56	that we know what these streaks are.
290.68	It's liquid water.
293.04	These craters are weeping
293.04	during the summer.
296.6	Liquid water is flowing
296.6	down these craters.
300.56	So what are we going to do now --
302.32	now that we see the water?
304.4	Well, it tells us that Mars has
304.4	all the ingredients necessary for life.
309.76	In its past it had perhaps
309.76	two-thirds of its northern hemisphere --
314.36	there was an ocean.
315.88	It has weeping water right now.
317.8	Liquid water on its surface.
319.6	It has organics.
321.24	It has all the right conditions.
324.103	So what are we going to do next?
326.04	We're going to launch a series of missions
328.48	to begin that search for life on Mars.
332.28	And now it's more appealing
332.28	than ever before.
335.68	As we move out into the solar system,
338.32	here's the tiny moon Enceladus.
341.32	This is not in what we call
341.32	the traditional habitable zone,
344.72	this area around the sun.
346.96	This is much further out.
348.84	This object should be
348.84	ice over a silicate core.
354.2	But what did we find?
355.84	Cassini was there since 2006,
358.8	and after a couple years
358.8	looked back after it flew by Enceladus
363.2	and surprised us all.
364.92	Enceladus is blasting sheets of water
364.92	out into the solar system
370.72	and sloshing back down onto the moon.
373.68	What a fabulous environment.
375.96	Cassini just a few months ago
375.96	also flew through the plume,
380.8	and it measured silicate particles.
383.72	Where does the silica come from?
385.68	It must come from the ocean floor.
388.8	The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,
391.96	pulling and squeezing this moon --
394.12	is melting that ice,
395.8	creating an ocean.
397.28	But it's also doing that to the core.
400.28	Now, the only thing that we can think of
402.48	that does that here on Earth
402.48	as an analogy ...
406.04	are hydrothermal vents.
409	Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean
409	were discovered in 1977.
415.08	Oceanographers were completely surprised.
418.56	And now there are thousands
418.56	of these below the ocean.
423.2	What do we find?
424.48	The oceanographers, when they go
424.48	and look at these hydrothermal vents,
427.84	they're teeming with life,
429.16	regardless of whether the water
429.16	is acidic or alkaline --
433.72	doesn't matter.
435.28	So hydrothermal vents are
435.28	a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.
440.76	So what about Enceladus?
443.08	Well, we believe because it has water
446.08	and has had it for
446.08	a significant period of time,
449.56	and we believe it has hydrothermal vents
453.4	with perhaps the right organic material,
456.48	it is a place where life could exist.
460.64	And not just microbial --
462.56	maybe more complex
462.56	because it's had time to evolve.
467.92	Another moon, very similar,
470.64	is Europa.
472.2	Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996
478.04	and made fabulous observations of Europa.
481.6	Europa, we also know,
481.6	has an under-the-ice crust ocean.
486.88	Galileo mission told us that,
486.88	but we never saw any plumes.
491.28	But we didn't look for them.
493.72	Hubble,
494.96	just a couple years ago,
496.8	observing Europa,
499.8	saw plumes of water
501.36	spraying from the cracks
501.36	in the southern hemisphere,
504.36	just exactly like Enceladus.
509.52	These moons,
511.48	which are not in what we call
511.48	a traditional habitable zone,
515.28	that are out in the solar system,
517.28	have liquid water.
519.08	And if there are organics there,
521.08	there may be life.
523	This is a fabulous set of discoveries
525.799	because these moons
525.799	have been in this environment like that
530.039	for billions of years.
533.12	Life started here on Earth, we believe,
533.12	after about the first 500 million,
538.92	and look where we are.
541.28	These moons are fabulous moons.
544.6	Another moon that we're
544.6	looking at is Titan.
548.64	Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.
550.76	It perhaps is much larger
550.76	than the planet Mercury.
554.92	It has an extensive atmosphere.
557	It's so extensive --
558.64	and it's mostly nitrogen
558.64	with a little methane and ethane --
563.24	that you have to peer
563.24	through it with radar.
565.68	And on the surface,
565.68	Cassini has found liquid.
569.88	We see lakes ...
572.2	actually almost the size
572.2	of our Black Sea in some places.
576.32	And this area is not liquid water;
579.44	it's methane.
581.92	If there's any place in the solar system
581.92	where life is not like us,
587.76	where the substitute of water
587.76	is another solvent --
590.64	and it could be methane --
592.04	it could be Titan.
594.56	Well, is there life beyond Earth
594.56	in the solar system?
598.92	We don't know yet,
600.2	but we're hot on the pursuit.
602.28	The data that we're receiving
602.28	is really exciting
604.92	and telling us --
606.32	forcing us to think about this
606.32	in new and exciting ways.
610.8	I believe we're on the right track.
613.28	That in the next 10 years,
613.28	we will answer that question.
617.16	And if we answer it,
619.12	and it's positive,
621	then life is everywhere
621	in the solar system.
625.72	Just think about that.
627.6	We may not be alone.
630.24	Thank you.
631.48	(Applause)
