18.96	Now...
21.2	let's go back in time.
24.56	It's 1974.
29.96	There is the gallery somewhere
33.88	in the world,
37.08	and there is a young girl, age 23,
40.4	standing in the middle of the space.
44.759	In the front of her is a table.
49	On the table there are 76 objects
54.72	for pleasure and for pain.
58.52	Some of the objects are
60.72	a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose.
67.16	But also the knife,
67.16	the razor blade, the hammer
73.8	and the pistol with one bullet.
78.24	There are instructions which say,
81.24	"""I'm an object."
83	You can use everything on the table on me.
86.36	I'm taking all responsibility --
86.36	even killing me.
90.92	"And the time is six hours."""
95.6	The beginning of this
95.6	performance was easy.
100.28	People would give me
100.28	the glass of water to drink,
103.88	they'd give me the rose.
106.12	But very soon after,
108.92	there was a man who took the scissors
108.92	and cut my clothes,
112.44	and then they took the thorns of the rose
112.44	and stuck them in my stomach.
116.92	Somebody took the razor blade
116.92	and cut my neck and drank the blood,
121.96	and I still have the scar.
124.72	The women would tell the men what to do.
128	And the men didn't rape me
128	because it was just a normal opening,
132.84	and it was all public,
134.56	and they were with their wives.
136.96	They carried me around
136.96	and put me on the table,
139.24	and put the knife between my legs.
141.16	And somebody took the pistol and bullet
141.16	and put it against my temple.
145.56	And another person took the pistol
145.56	and they started a fight.
150.92	And after six hours were finished,
153.68	I...
156.2	started walking towards the public.
159.36	I was a mess.
160.6	I was half-naked, I was full of blood
160.6	and tears were running down my face.
166.04	And everybody escaped, they just ran away.
169.28	They could not confront myself,
169.28	with myself as a normal human being.
174.76	And then --
177.08	what happened
179.24	is I went to the hotel,
179.24	it was at two in the morning.
185.08	And
187.68	I looked at myself in the mirror,
190.52	and I had a piece of gray hair.
196.08	Alright --
198	please take off your blindfolds.
202.76	Welcome to the performance world.
205.52	First of all, let's explain
205.52	what the performance is.
209.84	So many artists,
209.84	so many different explanations,
212.4	but my explanation
212.4	for performance is very simple.
215.64	Performance is a mental
215.64	and physical construction
220.24	that the performer makes
220.24	in a specific time
223.08	in a space in front of an audience
226.4	and then energy dialogue happens.
229.28	The audience and the performer
229.28	make the piece together.
233.6	And the difference between
233.6	performance and theater is huge.
238.24	In the theater, the knife is not a knife
241.72	and the blood is just ketchup.
244.04	In the performance,
244.04	the blood is the material,
248.6	and the razor blade or knife is the tool.
251.92	It's all about being there
251.92	in the real time,
255.84	and you can't rehearse performance,
257.72	because you can't do many
257.72	of these types of things twice -- ever.
263.36	Which is very important,
263.36	the performance is --
265.88	you know, all human beings
265.88	are always afraid of very simple things.
270.2	We're afraid of suffering,
270.2	we're afraid of pain,
273.6	we're afraid of mortality.
276.24	So what I'm doing --
277.52	I'm staging these kinds of fears
277.52	in front of the audience.
281.76	I'm using your energy,
283.96	and with this energy I can go
283.96	and push my body as far as I can.
289.76	And then I liberate myself
289.76	from these fears.
293.36	And I'm your mirror.
294.68	If I can do this for myself,
294.68	you can do it for you.
298.72	After Belgrade, where I was born,
300.8	I went to Amsterdam.
303.44	And you know, I've been doing performances
306.08	since the last 40 years.
308.36	And here I met Ulay,
309.96	and he was the person
309.96	I actually fell in love with.
313.36	And we made, for 12 years,
313.36	performances together.
316.52	You know the knife
316.52	and the pistols and the bullets,
319.8	I exchange into love and trust.
322.76	So to do this kind work
322.76	you have to trust the person completely
326.4	because this arrow
326.4	is pointing to my heart.
329.44	So, heart beating and adrenaline
329.44	is rushing and so on,
333.8	is about trust, is about total trust
333.8	to another human being.
339.32	Our relationship was 12 years,
341.56	and we worked on so many subjects,
341.56	both male and female energy.
345.44	And as every relationship
345.44	comes to an end, ours went too.
349.6	We didn't make phone calls
349.6	like normal human beings do
353.28	"and say, you know, ""This is over."""
355.28	We walked the Great Wall
355.28	of China to say goodbye.
358.64	I started at the Yellow Sea,
358.64	and he started from the Gobi Desert.
363.2	We walked, each of us, three months,
366.6	two and a half thousand kilometers.
368.8	It was the mountains, it was difficult.
370.8	It was climbing, it was ruins.
373.16	It was, you know, going through
373.16	the 12 Chinese provinces,
376.28	this was before China was open in '87.
380.12	And we succeeded to meet in the middle
383.68	to say goodbye.
386.32	And then our relationship stopped.
388.56	And now, it completely changed
388.56	how I see the public.
393.28	And one very important piece
393.28	I made in those days
396.44	"was ""Balkan Baroque."""
398.44	And this was the time of the Balkan Wars,
401.16	and I wanted to create
401.16	some very strong, charismatic image,
404.72	something that could serve
404.72	for any war at any time,
408.04	because the Balkan Wars are now finished,
408.04	but there's always some war, somewhere.
412.08	So here I am washing
414.08	two and a half thousand
414.08	dead, big, bloody cow bones.
417.88	You can't wash the blood,
417.88	you never can wash shame off the wars.
421.44	So I'm washing this six hours, six days,
421.44	and wars are coming off these bones,
426.04	and becoming possible --
426.04	an unbearable smell.
429.64	But then something stays in the memory.
432.52	I want to show you the one
432.52	who really changed my life,
435.28	and this was the performance in MoMa,
435.28	which I just recently made.
439.44	This performance --
439.44	when I said to the curator,
442.8	"""I'm just going to sit at the chair,"
444.8	and there will be
444.8	an empty chair at the front,
447.36	and anybody from the public
447.36	"can come and sit as long as they want."""
450.88	The curator said to me,
452.12	"""That's ridiculous, you know,"
452.12	this is New York,
454.8	this chair will be empty,
456.04	"nobody has time to sit in front of you."""
457.969	(Laughter)
459.16	But I sit for three months.
461.08	And I sit everyday, eight hours --
463.04	the opening of the museum --
464.44	and 10 hours on Friday
464.44	when the museum is open 10 hours,
467.36	and I never move.
468.558	And I removed the table
468.558	and I'm still sitting,
471.44	and this changed everything.
473.96	This performance,
473.96	maybe 10 or 15 years ago --
476.32	nothing would have happened.
477.76	But the need of people to actually
477.76	experience something different,
482.68	the public was not anymore the group --
484.8	relation was one to one.
487.16	I was watching these people,
487.16	they would come and sit in front of me,
490.92	but they would have to wait
490.92	for hours and hours and hours
493.64	to get to this position,
494.823	and finally, they sit.
496.4	And what happened?
498.44	They are observed by the other people,
500.6	they're photographed,
500.6	they're filmed by the camera,
503.2	they're observed by me
504.6	and they have nowhere to escape
504.6	except in themselves.
508.24	And that makes a difference.
509.84	There was so much pain and loneliness,
511.68	there's so much incredible things
511.68	when you look in somebody else's eyes,
515.8	because in the gaze
515.8	with that total stranger,
518.8	that you never even say one word --
518.8	everything happened.
522.2	And I understood when I stood up
522.2	from that chair after three months,
527.2	I am not the same anymore.
528.799	And I understood
528.799	that I have a very strong mission,
531.6	that I have to communicate this experience
534.88	to everybody.
536.159	And this is how, for me, was born the idea
539	to have an institute
539	of immaterial performing arts.
543.32	Because thinking about immateriality,
546.24	performance is time-based art.
547.72	It's not like a painting.
549.08	You have the painting on the wall,
549.08	the next day it's there.
551.88	Performance, if you are missing it,
551.88	you only have the memory,
556.6	or the story of somebody else telling you,
558.96	but you actually missed the whole thing.
560.92	So you have to be there.
562.16	And in my point,
562.16	if you talk about immaterial art,
565.08	music is the highest --
565.08	absolutely highest art of all,
568.48	because it's the most immaterial.
570.28	And then after this is performance,
570.28	and then everything else.
573.162	That's my subjective way.
574.72	This institute is going to happen
574.72	in Hudson, upstate New York,
578.64	and we are trying to build
578.64	with Rem Koolhaas, an idea.
581.96	And it's very simple.
583.24	If you want to get experience,
583.24	you have to give me your time.
587.92	You have to sign the contract
587.92	before you enter the building,
591.04	that you will spend there
591.04	a full six hours,
593.92	you have to give me your word of honor.
596.6	It's something so old-fashioned,
598.52	but if you don't respect your own
598.52	word of honor and you leave before --
601.88	that's not my problem.
603.12	But it's six hours, the experience.
605.64	And then after you finish,
605.64	you get a certificate of accomplishment,
608.807	so get home and frame it if you want.
610.88	(Laughter)
611.92	This is orientation hall.
613.28	The public comes in, and the first thing
613.28	you have to do is dress in lab coats.
617.8	It's this importance
619.04	of stepping from being
619.04	just a viewer into experimenter.
623.28	And then you go to the lockers
625.72	and you put your watch,
625.72	your iPhone, your iPod, your computer
629.04	and everything digital, electronic.
631.36	And you are getting free time
631.36	for yourself for the first time.
635.72	Because there is nothing
635.72	wrong with technology,
639.12	our approach to technology is wrong.
641.48	We are losing the time
641.48	we have for ourselves.
644.2	This is an institute
644.2	to actually give you back this time.
647.52	So what you do here,
648.8	first you start slow walking,
648.8	you start slowing down.
651.92	You're going back to simplicity.
653.88	After slow walking, you're going
653.88	to learn how to drink water --
657.52	very simple, drinking water
657.52	for maybe half an hour.
661.64	After this, you're going to
661.64	the magnet chamber,
663.96	where you're going to create
663.96	some magnet streams on your body.
667.88	Then after this,
667.88	you go to crystal chamber.
670.36	After crystal chamber,
670.36	you go to eye-gazing chamber,
673.16	after eye-gazing chamber, you go to
673.16	a chamber where you are lying down.
677.28	So it's the three basic positions
677.28	of the human body,
679.76	sitting, standing and lying.
681.12	And slow walking.
682.68	And there is a sound chamber.
684.52	And then after you've seen all of this,
686.88	and prepared yourself
686.88	mentally and physically,
689.047	then you are ready to see
689.047	something with a long duration,
691.738	like in immaterial art.
694.12	It can be music, it can be opera,
694.12	it can be a theater piece,
698	it can be film, it can be video dance.
700.92	You go to the long duration chairs
700.92	because now you are comfortable.
704.76	In the long duration chairs,
706.16	you're transported to the big place
706.16	where you're going to see the work.
709.88	And if you fall asleep,
711.12	which is very possible
711.12	because it's been a long day,
713.68	you're going to be
713.68	transported to the parking lot.
716.16	(Laughter)
717.8	And you know, sleeping is very important.
720.64	In sleeping, you're still receiving art.
723.44	So in the parking lot you stay
723.44	for a certain amount of time,
727.16	and then after this
727.16	you just, you know, go back,
730.44	you see more of the things you like to see
732.8	or go home with your certificate.
735.28	So this institute right now is virtual.
738.72	Right now, I am just
738.72	making my institute in Brazil,
741.6	then it's going to be in Australia,
743.291	then it's coming here,
743.291	to Canada and everywhere.
746.44	And this is to experience
746.44	a kind of simple method,
749.96	how you go back to simplicity
749.96	in your own life.
752.88	Counting rice will be another thing.
755.76	(Laughter)
757.68	You know, if you count rice
757.68	you can make life, too.
760.2	How to count rice for six hours?
762.4	It's incredibly important.
764.12	You know, you go through this whole range
764.12	of being bored, being angry,
768.28	being completely frustrated, not finishing
768.28	the amount of rice you're counting.
772.76	And then this unbelievable
772.76	amount of peace you get
775.56	when satisfying work is finished --
778.04	or counting sand in the desert.
780.6	Or having the sound-isolated situation --
784.12	that you have headphones,
784.12	that you don't hear anything,
786.72	and you're just there
786.72	together without sound,
789.44	with the people experiencing silence,
789.44	just the simple silence.
794.32	We are always doing things
794.32	we like in our life.
798.56	And this is why you're not changing.
800.84	You do things in life --
802.32	it's just nothing happens
802.32	if you always do things the same way.
806.2	But my method is to do things
806.2	I'm afraid of, the things I fear,
811.32	the things I don't know,
812.84	to go to territory
812.84	that nobody's ever been.
815.72	And then also to include the failure.
818.6	I think failure is important
820.36	because if you go,
820.36	if you experiment, you can fail.
824.12	If you don't go into that area
824.12	and you don't fail,
826.8	you are actually repeating yourself
826.8	over and over again.
830.32	And I think that human beings
830.32	right now need a change,
834.16	and the only change to be made
834.16	is a personal level change.
838.28	You have to make the change on yourself.
840.88	Because the only way
840.88	to change consciousness
843.4	and to change the world around us,
845.44	is to start with yourself.
847.16	It's so easy to criticize
847.16	how it's different,
849.68	the things in the world
849.68	and they're not right,
851.847	and the governments are corrupted
851.847	and there's hunger in the world
855.12	and there's wars -- the killing.
858.6	But what we do on the personal level --
861.2	what is our contribution
861.2	to this whole thing?
864.96	Can you turn to your neighbor,
864.96	the one you don't know,
868.08	and look at them for two full minutes
868.08	in their eyes, right now?
873.84	(Chatter)
878.36	I'm asking two minutes
878.36	of your time, that's so little.
882.28	Breathe slowly, don't try to blink,
882.28	don't be self-conscious.
887.64	Be relaxed.
889.28	And just look a complete
889.28	stranger in your eyes, in his eyes.
895.52	(Silence)
935.04	Thank you for trusting me.
937.72	(Applause)
945.36	Chris Anderson: Thank you.
948.36	Thank you so much.
