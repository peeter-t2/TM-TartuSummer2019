12.478	Three and a half years ago,
14.213	I made one of the best decisions of my life.
17.463	As my New Year's resolution,
19.526	I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,
23.765	and learned to eat mindfully.
26.79	Now I eat whenever I'm hungry,
30.673	and I've lost 10 pounds.
33.736	This was me at age 13,
36.273	when I started my first diet.
38.813	I look at that picture now, and I think,
41.825	you did not need a diet,
43.659	you needed a fashion consult.
46.33	(Laughter)
48.737	But I thought I needed to lose weight,
51.806	and when I gained it back,
53.268	of course I blamed myself.
57.196	And for the next three decades,
59.703	I was on and off various diets.
62.458	No matter what I tried,
64.53	the weight I'd lost always came back.
67.361	I'm sure many of you know the feeling.
70.962	As a neuroscientist,
72.523	I wondered, why is this so hard?
75.337	Obviously, how much you weigh depends on
77.897	how much you eat and how much energy you burn.
80.487	What most people don't realize
82.703	is that hunger and energy use
84.516	are controlled by the brain,
86.62	mostly without your awareness.
90.135	Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,
93.695	and that is a good thing,
95.911	because your conscious mind --
98.097	how do we put this politely? --
99.964	it's easily distracted.
103.239	It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe
105.944	when you get caught up in a movie.
108.584	You don't forget how to walk
110.601	because you're thinking about
110.601	what to have for dinner.
113.516	Your brain also has its own sense
115.5	of what you should weigh,
117.265	no matter what you consciously believe.
120.327	This is called your set point,
122.367	but that's a misleading term,
124.033	because it's actually a range
125.743	of about 10 or 15 pounds.
128.307	You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight
131.53	up and down within that range,
133.598	but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.
138.003	The hypothalamus, the part of the brain
140.03	that regulates body weight,
141.943	there are more than a dozen chemical signals
144.366	in the brain that tell your body to gain weight,
146.982	more than another dozen that
146.982	tell your body to lose it,
150.666	and the system works like a thermostat,
153.976	responding to signals from the body
156.323	by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,
159.931	to keep your weight stable as conditions change.
163.657	That's what a thermostat does, right?
165.759	It keeps the temperature in your house the same
169.191	as the weather changes outside.
171.951	Now you can try to change the temperature
174.773	in your house by opening a window in the winter,
178.269	but that's not going to change
178.269	the setting on the thermostat,
182.035	which will respond by kicking on the furnace
184.234	to warm the place back up.
186.671	Your brain works exactly the same way,
189.993	responding to weight loss by using powerful tools
193.136	to push your body back
194.29	to what it considers normal.
198.32	If you lose a lot of weight,
200.295	your brain reacts as if you were starving,
204.62	and whether you started out fat or thin,
207.252	your brain's response is exactly the same.
210.217	We would love to think that your brain could tell
212.49	whether you need to lose weight or not,
213.956	but it can't.
216.091	If you do lose a lot of weight,
218.984	you become hungry,
221.283	and your muscles burn less energy.
224.169	Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University
226.818	has found that people who have lost
230.726	burn 250 to 400 calories less
233.549	because their metabolism is suppressed.
236.057	That's a lot of food.
238.487	This means that a successful dieter
240.711	must eat this much less forever
243.879	than someone of the same weight
245.171	who has always been thin.
247.474	From an evolutionary perspective,
249.264	your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.
251.808	When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival
254.944	depended on conserving energy,
257.438	and regaining the weight when food was available
259.691	would have protected them
259.691	against the next shortage.
262.798	Over the course of human history,
265.325	starvation has been a much bigger problem
268.327	than overeating.
270.011	This may explain a very sad fact:
274.242	Set points can go up,
277.071	but they rarely go down.
279.943	Now, if your mother ever mentioned
282.132	that life is not fair,
284.428	this is the kind of thing she was talking about.
287.221	(Laughter)
290.259	Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.
293.444	Even after you've kept the weight off
294.988	for as long as seven years,
296.817	your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.
300.79	If that weight loss had been due to a long famine,
304.08	that would be a sensible response.
306.409	In our modern world of drive-thru burgers,
309.09	it's not working out so well for many of us.
312.547	That difference between our ancestral past
316.29	and our abundant present
318.693	is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff
320.982	of the University of Ottawa
323.042	would like to take some of his patients back to a time
325.743	when food was less available,
327.842	and it's also the reason
329.543	that changing the food environment
331.927	is really going to be the most effective solution
336.043	to obesity.
338.153	Sadly, a temporary weight gain
341.43	can become permanent.
343.475	If you stay at a high weight for too long,
346.109	probably a matter of years for most of us,
348.583	your brain may decide that that's the new normal.
353.021	Psychologists classify eaters into two groups,
357.081	those who rely on their hunger
358.699	and those who try to control their eating
361.268	through willpower, like most dieters.
367.331	Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.
373.842	The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters
376.025	are less likely to be overweight,
378.656	and they spend less time thinking about food.
382.358	Controlled eaters are more vulnerable
386.002	to overeating in response to advertising,
388.865	super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.
392.728	And a small indulgence,
394.473	like eating one scoop of ice cream,
397.679	is more likely to lead to a food binge
403.289	in controlled eaters.
405.186	Children are especially vulnerable
407.113	to this cycle of dieting and then binging.
410.242	Several long-term studies have shown
413.071	that girls who diet in their early teenage years
417.223	are three times more likely to become overweight
420.548	five years later,
422.085	even if they started at a normal weight,
424.904	and all of these studies found
427.553	that the same factors
429.86	that predicted weight gain
433.254	also predicted the development of eating disorders.
436.254	The other factor, by the way,
437.822	those of you who are parents,
439.251	was being teased by family members
442.48	about their weight.
443.991	So don't do that.
445.827	(Laughter)
447.565	I left almost all my graphs at home,
450.201	but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,
452.494	because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.
454.907	(Laughter)
457.386	This is a study that looked at the risk of death
459.734	over a 14-year period
461.6	based on four healthy habits:
464.102	eating enough fruits and vegetables,
466.222	exercise three times a week,
468.448	not smoking,
469.824	and drinking in moderation.
471.794	Let's start by looking at the normal weight
473.723	people in the study.
475.311	The height of the bars is the risk of death,
477.198	and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers
479.579	on the horizontal axis
480.825	are the number of those healthy habits
482.858	that a given person had.
484.418	And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,
487.407	the less likely people were to die during the study.
490.319	Now let's look at what happens
491.641	in overweight people.
493.487	The ones that had no healthy habits
495.559	had a higher risk of death.
497.33	Adding just one healthy habit
499.094	pulls overweight people back into the normal range.
502.556	For obese people with no healthy habits,
505.298	the risk is very high, seven times higher
508.008	than the healthiest groups in the study.
510.144	But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.
514.084	In fact, if you look only at the group
516.602	with all four healthy habits,
518.876	you can see that weight makes very little difference.
521.488	You can take control of your health
523.544	by taking control of your lifestyle,
525.418	even If you can't lose weight
526.899	and keep it off.
528.635	Diets don't have very much reliability.
532.745	Five years after a diet,
534.522	most people have regained the weight.
537.31	Forty percent of them have gained even more.
539.792	If you think about this,
541.217	the typical outcome of dieting
543.564	is that you're more likely to gain weight
545.452	in the long run than to lose it.
548.221	If I've convinced you that dieting
551.075	might be a problem,
553.104	the next question is, what do you do about it?
555.742	And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.
560.198	I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate
562.733	or take up yoga.
564.725	I'm talking about mindful eating:
567.277	learning to understand your body's signals
570.785	so that you eat when you're hungry
573.174	and stop when you're full,
575.516	because a lot of weight gain boils down
577.694	to eating when you're not hungry.
580.76	How do you do it?
582.244	Give yourself permission to eat
584.078	as much as you want, and then work on figuring out
586.283	what makes your body feel good.
588.035	Sit down to regular meals without distractions.
591.764	Think about how your body feels
593.563	when you start to eat and when you stop,
595.617	and let your hunger decide
598.104	when you should be done.
599.572	It took about a year for me to learn this,
601.993	but it's really been worth it.
603.764	I am so much more relaxed around food
606.849	than I have ever been in my life.
609.712	I often don't think about it.
612.277	I forget we have chocolate in the house.
615.01	It's like aliens have taken over my brain.
617.954	It's just completely different.
620.712	I should say that
623.378	this approach to eating probably
623.378	won't make you lose weight
626.171	unless you often eat when you're not hungry,
629.088	but doctors don't know of any approach
632.986	that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,
637.461	and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on
640.831	preventing weight gain
642.99	instead of promoting weight loss.
646.213	Let's face it:
647.749	If diets worked, we'd all be thin already.
651.96	(Laughter)
653.86	Why do we keep doing the same thing
655.497	and expecting different results?
658.38	Diets may seem harmless,
660.063	but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.
663.781	At worst, they ruin lives:
666.216	Weight obsession leads to eating disorders,
668.532	especially in young kids.
671.475	In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls
676.353	say they've been on a diet.
678.13	Our daughters have learned to measure their worth
680.391	by the wrong scale.
683.494	Even at its best,
685.519	dieting is a waste of time and energy.
688.247	It takes willpower which you could be using
692.469	to help your kids with their homework
695.091	or to finish that important work project,
698.707	and because willpower is limited,
702.194	any strategy that relies on its consistent application
706.817	is pretty much guaranteed
709.6	to eventually fail you
711.693	when your attention moves on to something else.
715.542	Let me leave you with one last thought.
719.474	What if we told all those dieting girls
722.377	that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?
725.378	What if we taught them to work with their appetite
727.628	instead of fearing it?
729.753	I think most of them would be happier and healthier,
733.18	and as adults,
735.195	many of them would probably be thinner.
738.968	I wish someone had told me that
741.081	back when I was 13.
744.502	Thanks.
746.508	(Applause)
