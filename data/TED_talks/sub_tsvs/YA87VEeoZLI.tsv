12.934	Here are some images of clusters of galaxies.
16.268	They're exactly what they sound like.
18.101	They are these huge collections of galaxies,
20.654	bound together by their mutual gravity.
22.909	So most of the points that you see on the screen
25.571	are not individual stars,
28.1	but collections of stars, or galaxies.
30.936	Now, by showing you some of these images,
33.267	I hope that you will quickly see that
35.014	galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects,
37.694	but more than that,
39.187	I think galaxy clusters are mysterious,
41.85	they are surprising,
43.403	and they're useful.
44.82	Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories.
48.351	And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters
51.987	is to describe the experiments
53.852	that you can do with them.
55.405	And I think there are four major types,
57.685	and the first type that I want to describe
60.269	is probing the very big.
62.488	So, how big?
64.183	Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
68.434	It is so massive that the light passing through it
71.403	is being bent, it's being distorted
74.018	by the extreme gravity of this cluster.
76.527	And, in fact, if you look very carefully
78.331	you'll be able to see rings around this cluster.
81.031	Now, to give you a number,
82.58	this particular galaxy cluster
84.363	has a mass of over one million billion suns.
88.571	It's just mind-boggling how 
88.571	massive these systems can get.
91.884	But more than their mass,
93.385	they have this additional feature.
95.359	They are essentially isolated systems,
97.703	so if we like, we can think of them
99.925	as a scaled-down version of the entire universe.
103.195	And many of the questions that we might have
105.197	about the universe at large scales,
107.165	such as, how does gravity work?
109.08	might be answered by studying these systems.
112.112	So that was very big.
113.445	The second things is very hot.
115.33	Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster,
118.113	and I subtract away all of the starlight,
121.03	what I'm left with is this big, blue blob.
123.825	This is in false color.
125.31	It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.
127.659	And the question is, if it's not galaxies,
130.32	what is emitting this light?
132.519	The answer is hot gas,
134.419	million-degree gas --
136.242	in fact, it's plasma.
137.899	And the reason why it's so hot
139.558	goes back to the previous slide.
141.538	The extreme gravity of these systems
144.278	is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds,
147.32	and great speeds means great temperatures.
149.902	So this is the main idea,
151.621	but science is a rough draft.
153.987	There are many basic properties about this plasma
156.538	that still confuse us,
158.236	still puzzle us,
159.569	and still push our understanding
161.655	of the physics of the very hot.
163.694	Third thing: probing the very small.
167.121	Now, to explain this, I need to tell you
169.967	a very disturbing fact.
171.987	Most of the universe's matter
174.777	is not made up of atoms.
176.588	You were lied to.
178.538	Most of it is made up of something 
178.538	very, very mysterious,
181.665	which we call dark matter.
183.787	Dark matter is something that 
183.787	doesn't like to interact very much,
187.454	except through gravity,
189.122	and of course we would like to learn more about it.
190.734	If you're a particle physicist,
192.277	you want to know what happens 
192.277	when we smash things together.
194.786	And dark matter is no exception.
196.776	Well, how do we do this?
198.436	To answer that question,
199.927	I'm going to have to ask another one,
201.32	which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide?
204.486	Here is an image.
206.796	Since galaxy clusters are representative
209.987	slices of the universe, scaled-down versions.
213.111	They are mostly made up of dark matter,
215.234	and that's what you see in this bluish purple.
217.787	The red represents the hot gas,
219.404	and, of course, you can see many galaxies.
221.371	What's happened is a particle accelerator
223.736	at a huge, huge scale.
225.627	And this is very important,
227.404	because what it means is that very, very small
229.287	effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab,
232.371	might be compounded and compounded
234.55	into something that we could 
234.55	possibly observe in nature.
238.359	So, it's very funny.
239.871	The reason why galaxy clusters
241.819	can teach us about dark matter,
243.485	the reason why galaxy clusters
245.235	can teach us about the physics of the very small,
247.788	is precisely because they are so very big.
250.819	Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.
254.904	Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.
257.954	Okay, if there's anything stranger
260.237	I think it has to be dark energy.
262.654	If I throw a ball into the air,
264.371	I expect it to go up.
266.169	What I don't expect is that it go up
268.293	at an ever-increasing rate.
270.459	Similarly, cosmologists understand why
273.204	the universe is expanding.
274.786	They don't understand why it's expanding
276.954	at an ever-increasing rate.
278.892	They give the cause of this
280.57	accelerated expansion a name,
282.162	and they call it dark energy.
284.046	And, again, we want to learn more about it.
286.734	So, one particular question that we have is,
289.121	how does dark energy affect the universe
291.816	at the largest scales?
293.434	Depending on how strong it is,
294.893	maybe structure forms faster or slower.
298.154	Well, the problem with the large-scale structure
300.703	of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.
303.041	Here is a computer simulation.
305.37	And we need a way to simplify it.
307.498	Well, I like to think about this using an analogy.
311.069	If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic,
313.787	the most important thing to do
315.453	is not to model the little positions
317.234	of every single little piece of the boat that broke off.
320.155	The most important thing to do is
321.82	to track the two biggest parts.
323.821	Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe
327.653	at the largest scales
329.12	by tracking its biggest pieces
330.871	and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies.
334.862	So, as I come to a close,
337.818	you might feel slightly cheated.
339.82	I mean, I began by talking about
342.07	how galaxy clusters are useful,
344.153	and I've given some reasons,
345.653	but what is their use really?
348.253	Well, to answer this,
350.37	I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford
352.986	when he was asked about cars.
354.472	He had this to say:
355.831	"""If I had asked people what they wanted,"
358.12	"they would have said faster horses."""
360.903	Today, we as a society are faced
363.404	with many, many difficult problems.
365.622	And the solutions to these 
365.622	problems are not obvious.
369.453	They are not faster horses.
371.62	They will require an enormous amount of
373.862	scientific ingenuity.
375.568	So, yes, we need to focus,
377.154	yes, we need to concentrate,
378.904	but we also need to remember that
380.87	innovation, ingenuity, inspiration --
383.705	these things come
385.037	when we broaden our field of vision
386.725	when we step back
388.065	when we zoom out.
389.414	And I can't think of a better way to do this than
391.237	by studying the universe around us. Thanks.
394.992	(Applause)
