16.116	I am no designer, nope, no way.
19.967	My dad was,
21.783	which is kind of an interesting way to grow up.
24.375	I had to figure out what it is my dad did
28.55	and why it was important.
30.35	Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,
33.511	"you know, ""Bad design is just people not thinking, John,"" he would say"
38.481	whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower
40.944	or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled
43.894	or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.
46.287	"You know, ""Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it."
51.806	It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.
54.414	Every object should be about something, John.
57.777	It should imagine a user.
59.215	It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.
64.182	"Good design,"" my dad said, ""is about supplying intent."""
69.423	That's what he said.
72.078	Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.
75.999	That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.
79.999	He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.
85.555	I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?
90.593	And design was in everything my dad did.
92.965	He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,
96.122	and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.
98.818	And I would ask him every once in a while,
100.546	"""Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"""
103.457	We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.
105.61	"And he said, ""No, never, John, never."
107.907	The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.
110.634	You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.
113.319	"Show everyone what you intend,"" is what he said."
117.316	"""Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing."
121.605	"It's where we all belong."""
123.714	All of us? Designers?
127.139	Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.
132.073	The song is just a given.
133.738	It's how you cover it that matters.
136.226	Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.
138.322	It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?
141.225	The original tune? It's a little scary.
143.25	"""Ooh, what happened to that dude?"
145.914	He can't walk. Anybody know the story?
149.025	"Anybody?"""
150.931	I don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.
156.218	All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,
160.068	I was in a poorly designed automobile
162.01	that hit a poorly designed guardrail
165.931	on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,
168.514	and plummeted down a 200-foot embankment
173.307	and killed two people in the car.
175.514	But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.
179.993	My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.
185.129	Think about it. Now, in design terms,
187.532	a wheelchair is a very difficult object.
190.53	It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,
194.698	and it projects that message, that story, so strongly
197.489	that it almost blots out anything else.
199.748	I roll swiftly through an airport, right?
203.226	"And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, ""Don't stare!"""
207.21	The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.
211.409	And for decades, I'm going,
213.578	why does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.
218.058	So I would roll, I'd make no eye contact -- just kinda frown, right?
223.217	Or I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.
228.649	Or I'd make eye contact with everyone --
230.526	that was really creepy; that didn't work at all.
233.018	(Laughter)
234.931	You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked.
238.786	Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,
242.77	my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,
247.11	"""Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels -- you gotta get 'em!"""
252.234	"And I said, ""Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,"
256.347	"that just wouldn't do at all."""
258.913	And of course, they immediately concluded,
260.858	"""Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels."
266.025	"I mean, how important could you be then?"" they said."
270.503	"I went, ""Wait a minute, all right, right -- I'll get the wheels."" Purely out of protest,"
275.465	I got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and --
280.383	check this out. Could I have my special light cue please?
283.911	(Laughter)
285.433	Look at that!
288.364	Now ... look at, look at this! Look at this!
290.829	So what you are looking at here
294.276	has completely changed my life,
297.363	I mean totally changed my life.
300.34	Instead of blank stares and awkwardness,
303.212	now it is pointing and smiling!
306.696	"People going, ""Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!"
310.764	"I mean, I want some of those wheels!"" Little kids say,"
313.364	"""Can I have a ride?"""
315.5	(Laughter)
317.375	And of course there's the occasional person --
319.892	usually a middle-aged male who will say,
321.708	"""Oh, those wheels are great!"
323.349	"I guess they're for safety, right?"""
325.639	(Laughter)
327.988	No! They're not for safety.
333.956	No, no, no, no, no.
335.836	What's the difference here,
337.613	the wheelchair with no lights
339.42	and the wheelchair with lights?
341.15	The difference is intent.
344.932	That's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.
348.589	I chose to change the situation -- I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?
354.501	Intent changes the picture completely.
358.876	I choose to enhance
360.693	this rolling experience
362.636	with a simple design element.
366.34	Acting with intent.
368.548	It conveys authorship.
370.764	It suggests that someone is driving.
373.844	It's reassuring; people are drawn to it.
376.852	Someone making the experience their own.
380.364	Covering the tragic tune
382.604	with something different,
385.5	something radically different.
388.709	People respond to that.
390.756	Now it seems simple, but actually I think
393.548	in our society and culture in general,
395.773	we have a huge problem with intent.
397.836	Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?
401.196	It's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill
405.212	in Olso, Norway last year,
406.948	dozens and dozens of young people --
409.308	if he intended to do that,
411.02	he's a vicious criminal. We punish him.
413.604	Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.
416.973	But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,
421.324	if he was motivated by some random mental illness,
426.308	he's in a completely different category.
428.754	We may put him away for life, but
430.541	we watch him clinically.
432.58	It's a completely different domain.
436.029	As an intentional murderer,
438.501	Anders Breivik is merely evil.
441.54	But as a dysfunctional,
443.725	as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,
445.973	he's something much more complicated.
447.932	He's the breath of some 
449.692	primitive, ancient chaos.
453.092	He's the random state of nature
455.076	we emerged from.
456.606	He's something very, very different.
458.876	It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.
462.613	It's what we're supposed to do somehow.
464.932	We're supposed to act with intent.
467.66	We're supposed to do things by design.
470.116	Intent is a marker for civilization.
474.956	Now here's an example a little closer to home:
477.548	My family is all about intent.
479.924	You can probably tell there are two sets of twins,
483.132	the result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,
487.38	due to some physical limitations I won't go into.
490.015	Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF,
493.068	is about as intentional as agriculture.
496.072	Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience.
498.228	In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction
501.172	for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.
505.62	I met the dude. He's a great guy.
507.902	He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for
512.844	all of the animals that he'd worked with,
515.14	all the different animals.
516.639	Probes he designed,
518.771	and in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.
521.772	"He would say, ""You're right between horse and squirrel, John."""
525.542	(Laughter)
528.78	But anyway, so when my wife and I decided
534.452	to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids, after all --
537.501	with a little different technology
539.492	that I won't explain in too much detail here --
542.372	my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.
546.63	"""No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"""
549.206	"""John, John, I looked at your chart."
552.766	From your sperm tests we can
555.023	confidently say that
557.031	"you're basically a form of birth control."""
559.753	Well!
563.031	(Laughter)
566.623	What a liberating thought! Yes!
569.998	And after a couple very liberating weekends,
573.063	my wife and I,
574.503	utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology
578.391	that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday
580.975	but I won't get into it now,
583.006	we noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.
587.758	I wasn't exactly a form of birth control.
591.418	Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed.
594.998	I mean, did a designer come up with that?
596.543	No, I don't think a designer did come up with that.
598.775	In fact, maybe that's the problem.
600.99	And so, little Ajax was born.
603.671	He's like our other children,
605.94	but the experience is completely different.
607.718	It's something like my accident, right?
611.958	He came out of nowhere.
613.233	But we all had to change,
614.839	but not just react to the given;
617.52	we bend to this new experience with intent.
622.079	We're five now. Five.
626.151	Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design.
630.063	Hey, the name Ajax -- you can't get much more intentional than that, right?
634.295	We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.
638.535	(Laughter)
640.368	But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.
644.267	I did love some great designs as I was growing up:
648.905	The HP 35S calculator -- God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.
653.272	Man, I love that thing.
656.722	I could afford that.
657.945	Other designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.
662.584	In school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;
666.049	I studied useless things like the Classics,
668.368	but there were some lessons even there --
670.185	this guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.
673.449	"He designed a state in ""The Republic,"""
676.872	a design never implemented.
678.363	Listen to one of the design features
680.048	of Plato's Government 4.0:
683.072	"""The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern"
687.632	is always the best and most quietly governed,
690.568	"and the State in which they are most eager, the worst."""
694.64	Well, got that wrong, didn't we?
697.584	But look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.
701.881	But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?
705.336	It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design,
708.856	common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy
712.573	that emerged in the Classical period.
714.813	What was going on then?
716.246	They were trying to answer the question of
718.382	what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?
723.348	As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,
727.789	a confrontation with random, brutal nature,
732.213	they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about.
735.797	All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.
739.924	Human life needed a reason.
742.639	Reality itself needed a designer.
745.661	The given was replaced
748.053	by various aspects of intent,
750.677	by various designs,
753.261	by various gods.
755.541	Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.
759.485	Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.
762.645	Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.
768.525	This young discipline called design, I think,
771.805	is in fact the emerging ethos
775.072	formulating and then answering a very new question:
777.99	What shall we do now
779.589	in the face of the chaos that we have created?
783.332	What shall we do?
785.236	How shall we inscribe intent
787.702	on all the objects we create,
790.005	on all the circumstances we create,
791.981	on all the places we change?
794.588	The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.
798.716	That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.
803.085	And we can't just imitate the past. No.
805.621	That won't do.
808.455	That won't do at all.
810.23	Here's my favorite design moment:
813.237	In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,
816.645	I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on
818.933	the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,
823.077	who raped and pillaged that country.
825.077	There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.
827.645	The place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,
831.126	and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa
834.997	to report on the rioting and the looting.
837.02	People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.
840.806	Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.
845.501	In the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,
849.015	and I was completely invisible. Completely.
852.765	I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.
855.535	I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.
861.717	And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.
863.957	I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.
870.252	And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,
875.349	in this metal and wood and leather
879.069	pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,
884.094	and he pedals up to me as fast as he can.
886.558	"He goes, ""Hey, mister! Mister!"""
888.333	And I looked at him --
890.63	he didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.
894.214	We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.
900.085	And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;
903.51	he was full of pride over his design.
906.75	I wish I could show you that contraption.
908.599	His smile, our glow
910.726	as we talked a universal language
913.237	of design,
915.949	invisible to the chaos around us.
918.766	His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.
922.822	My machine: American-made, confident, sleek.
926.12	He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat
930.342	he had made in his chariot
932.258	and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.
936.685	Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!
940.669	He would have loved those! Oh yeah.
943.414	He would have understood those;
945.006	a chariot of pure intent -- think about it --
948.474	in a city out of control.
951.086	Design blew it all away for a moment.
954.134	We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.
958.278	He went back to the streets of Kinshasa;
960.697	I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...
966.679	And I pose this question.
969.741	An object imbued with intent --
973.294	it has power,
974.958	it's treasure, we're drawn to it.
978.358	An object devoid of intent --
980.99	it's random, it's imitative,
983.502	it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
987.182	This is what we must demand of our lives,
991.933	of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:
995.758	living with intent.
998.854	And I have to say
1000.958	that on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.
1005.989	And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.
1011.694	Thirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,
1016.629	a 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma
1020.785	to ask a nurse a question,
1022.582	but the nurse was already there with an answer.
1025.062	"""You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back."
1028.765	"You'll never walk again."""
1030.406	"I said, ""I know all that -- what day is it?"""
1036.022	You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,
1043.046	and I knew that 1976 was a leap year.
1046.695	"""Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"""
1051.405	And she looked at me and said,
1053.398	"""It's March 1st."""
1055.973	"And I went, ""Oh my God."
1058.454	"I've got some catching up to do!"""
1060.99	And from that moment, I knew
1063.662	the given was that accident;
1066.91	I had no option but to make up
1070.598	this new life without walking.
1073.654	Intent -- a life with intent --
1077.462	lived by design,
1079.286	covering the original
1080.902	with something better.
1082.462	It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.
1087.542	To get back to this,
1090.884	to get back to design,
1093.02	and as my daddy suggested a long time ago,
1096.421	"""Make the song your own, John."
1099.708	"Show everybody what you intend."""
1118.69	Daddy,
1120.989	this one's for you.
