12.78	Today, more than half
12.78	of the world's population lives in cities.
17.82	The urbanization process
17.82	started in the late 1700s
21.7	and has been increasing since then.
24.02	The prediction is that by 2050,
	will live in cities
30.14	and the United Nations,
30.14	the World Health Organization,
33.7	the World Economic Forum, are warning us,
37.18	if we don't plan
37.18	for the increased density,
39.9	current problems in our cities,
39.9	like inequality, congestion, crime
45.02	can only get worse.
46.42	As a result, urban planners
46.42	and city developers
49.06	are putting a lot of effort and creativity
52.62	in designing our future,
52.62	denser, bigger cities.
57.54	But I have a different opinion.
59.42	I think urbanization is actually
59.42	reaching the end of its cycle,
63.46	and now people are going to start
63.46	moving back to the countryside.
67.62	And you may think,
67.62	"""But what about the trend?"""
70.66	Well, let me tell you,
72.66	socioeconomic trends don't last forever.
76.059	You know, 12,000 years ago
77.78	everybody was perfectly happy
80.82	roaming the land, hunting and gathering.
83.86	And then, the trend changes,
86.54	and the new thing
86.54	is to live in a farm and have cattle,
90.02	until it changes again.
91.86	When we get to the industrial revolution.
95.34	Actually, that is what started
95.34	the urbanization process.
98.94	And you know what triggered it?
101.34	Steam power, machines,
104.62	new chemical processes --
106.46	in two words, technological innovation.
111.18	And I believe technology
111.18	can also bring the end of this cycle.
115.34	I've been working on innovation
115.34	for most of my career.
118.3	I love it. I love my job.
120.46	It allows me to work with drones,
120.46	with 3D printers and smart glasses,
124.58	and not just those you can buy in the shop
124.58	but also prototypes.
128.66	It's a lot of fun sometimes.
131.82	Now, some of these technologies
133.7	are opening new possibilities
133.7	that will radically change
136.82	the way we did things before
138.62	and in a few years,
140.62	they may allow us
140.62	to enjoy the benefits of city life
144.54	from anywhere.
146.22	Think about it.
147.46	If you could live in a place
147.46	with a lower crime rate
151.26	and more space
152.62	and a lower cost of living
154.38	and less traffic,
156.5	of course many people would want that,
158.78	but they feel they don't have a choice.
161.5	You have to live in the city.
164.94	Well, in the past,
164.94	people moved to the cities
167.62	not because they loved the city itself
170.22	but for the things
170.22	you could have in a city,
172.9	more job opportunities,
174.74	easier access to services and goods
176.82	and a rich social life.
178.86	So let's dive deeper.
181.62	More jobs and career opportunities.
184.94	Is that still true today,
186.3	because the office people
186.3	are starting to realize
189.5	that working in the office
189.5	and being in the office
193.5	may not be the same thing anymore.
196.1	According to a study
196.1	by Global Workplace Analytics,
199.26	more than 80 percent of the US workforce
199.26	would like to work from home.
204.5	And do you know how much it costs
204.5	for a company to even have an office?
213.62	If only half of those workers
216.42	would telework
216.42	even 50 percent of the time,
219.86	the savings in the states
219.86	would exceed 500 billion dollars,
224.7	and it could reduce greenhouse gases
224.7	by 54 million tons.
229.5	That is the equivalent
230.78	of 10 million cars
230.78	off the streets for a whole year.
236.14	But even though most people
236.14	would want to telework,
239.42	current technology
239.42	makes the experience isolating.
242.98	It's not comfortable.
244.26	It doesn't feel like being there.
246.62	But that is going to change
249.22	by the convergence of two technologies:
251.54	augmented reality and telepresence robots.
255.42	Augmented reality already today
257.42	allows you to take your office
257.42	environment everywhere with you.
260.98	All you need is a wearable computer,
260.98	a pair of smart glasses,
264.5	and you can take your emails
264.5	and your spreadsheets
266.9	with you wherever you go.
269.06	And video conferences and video calls
269.06	have become very common these days,
273.7	but they still need improvement.
276.14	I mean, all those little faces
276.14	on a flat screen,
279.9	sometimes you don't
279.9	even know who is talking.
282.42	Now, we already have something
282.42	way better than static videocalls:
287.26	your average telepresence robot.
289.94	I call it tablet on a stick.
292.926	(Laughter)
294.1	You can control, you can move around,
296.86	you can control what you're looking at.
299.06	It's way better, but far from perfect.
302.98	You know how they say
304.22	that most human
304.22	communication is nonverbal?
307.82	Well, the robot doesn't
307.82	give you any of that.
310.58	It looks like an alien.
314.02	But with advances in augmented reality,
316.86	it will be easy to wrap the robot
316.86	in a nice hologram
320.34	that actually looks
320.34	and moves like a person.
324.34	That will do it.
326.18	Or else, forget the robot.
328.26	We go full VR,
330.26	and everybody meets in cyberspace.
333.22	Give it a couple of years
333.22	and that will feel so real,
336.74	you won't tell the difference.
339.1	So what was the next reason
339.1	why people move to cities?
342.9	Access to services and goods.
345.66	But today you can do all that online.
348.9	According to a study made by comScore,
352.22	online shoppers in the US last year
354.62	did more than half
354.62	of their retail purchases online,
359.02	and the global market for e-commerce
362.38	is estimated to be
362.38	at two trillion dollars.
366.38	And it's expected to reach 2.38
366.38	by the end of 2017,
371.62	according to eMarketer.
374.42	Now, from a logistics standpoint,
377.06	density is good for deliveries.
380.34	Supplying goods
380.34	to a shopping mall is easy.
383.66	You can send big shipments to the shop,
386.34	and people will go there, pick it up
386.34	and take it home themselves.
389.5	E-commerce means we need to ship onesies
392.18	and have them home delivered.
393.98	That's more expensive.
395.26	It's like the difference between
395.26	having a birthday party for 20 people
398.98	or bringing a piece of the cake
401.1	to each of your 20 friends at their place.
405.06	But at least in the city,
407.22	they live close to each other.
408.7	Density helps.
410.74	Now, e-commerce deliveries
410.74	in the countryside,
414.98	those take forever.
417.5	The truck sometimes needs to drive miles
417.5	between one address and the next one.
421.98	Those are the most expensive
421.98	deliveries of all.
426.86	But we already have a solution for that:
429.46	drones.
430.9	A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.
434.3	The driver does some of the deliveries
436.18	while the drones are flying
436.18	back and forth from the truck as it moves.
439.54	That way, the average cost
439.54	for delivery is reduced,
442.1	and voila:
444.62	affordable e-commerce services
444.62	in the countryside.
448.66	You will see:
450.02	the new homes of our teleworkers
451.78	will probably have
451.78	a drone pod in the yard.
455.46	So once the final mile delivery
455.46	is not a problem,
458.06	you don't need to be in the city
458.06	to buy things anymore.
461.9	So that's two.
463.14	Now, what was the third reason
463.14	why people move to cities?
466.38	A rich social life.
468.62	They would need to be
468.62	in the city for that these days.
471.18	Because people these days,
473.26	they make friends,
473.26	they chat, gossip and flirt
476.66	from the comfort of their sofa.
478.5	(Laughter)
479.86	And while wearing their favorite pajamas.
482.3	(Laughter)
483.62	There are over two billion
483.62	active social media users in the world.
488.38	In a way, that makes you think
488.38	like we are connected
491.7	no matter where we are.
492.94	But OK, not completely.
495.26	Sometimes you still need
495.26	some real human contact.
499.7	Ironically, the city,
499.7	with its population density,
503.62	is not always the best for that.
506.58	Actually, as social groups become smaller,
509.62	they grow stronger.
511.26	A recent study made in the UK
513.5	by the Office for National Statistics
515.66	showed a higher life satisfaction rating
518.54	among people living in rural areas.
521.86	So as people settle in the countryside,
525.14	well, they will buy local groceries,
528.14	fresh groceries, foodstuff,
529.979	maintenance services.
532.1	So handymen, small workshops,
532.1	service companies will thrive.
537.82	Maybe some of the industrial
537.82	workers from the cities
540.3	displaced by the automation
542.58	will find a nice alternative job here,
544.94	and they will move too.
547.7	And as people move to the countryside,
549.58	how is that going to be?
551.26	Think about autonomous,
554.06	off-the-grid houses with solar panels,
556.14	with wind turbines
556.14	and waste recycling utilities,
560.7	our new homes producing their own energy
560.7	and using it to also power the family car.
565.94	I mean, cities have always been regarded
565.94	as being more energy-efficient,
570.06	but let me tell you,
571.34	repopulating the countryside
571.34	can be eco too.
576.5	By now, you're probably thinking
576.5	of all the advantages of country living.
580.86	(Laughter)
583.1	I did it myself.
584.38	Six years ago, my wife and I,
584.38	we packed our stuff,
587.94	we sold our little apartment in Spain,
589.9	and for the same money
589.9	we bought a house with a garden
595.02	and little birds that come
595.02	singing in the morning.
597.62	(Laughter)
599.1	It's so nice there.
601.7	And we live in a small village,
601.7	not really the countryside yet.
604.7	That is going to be my next move:
606.9	a refurbished farmhouse,
609.14	not too far from a city, not too close.
612.02	And now we'll make sure
612.02	to have a good spot for drones to land.
615.26	(Laughter)
616.46	But hey, that's me.
618.22	It doesn't have to be you,
619.5	because it would seem
619.5	like I'm trying to convince somebody
622.26	to come join us in the country.
623.78	I'm not.
625.02	(Laughter)
626.42	I don't need more people to come.
628.1	(Laughter)
629.94	I just think they will
631.74	once they realize they can have
631.74	the same benefits the city has.
635.896	But if you don't like the country,
637.54	I have good news for you, too.
639.7	Cities will not disappear.
642.46	But as people move out,
643.74	a lower density will help them
643.74	recover a better flow and balance.
649.1	Anyway, I guess now
649.1	you have some thinking to do.
653.78	Do you still think
653.78	you need to live in the city?
656.1	And more importantly,
658.34	do you want to?
660.62	Thank you very much.
661.86	(Applause)
