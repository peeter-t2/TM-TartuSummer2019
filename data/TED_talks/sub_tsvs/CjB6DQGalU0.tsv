12.878	The world is filled
12.878	with incredible objects
16.427	and rich cultural heritage.
19.283	And when we get access to them,
21.443	we are blown away, we fall in love.
24.652	But most of the time,
26.273	the world's population is living
26.273	without real access to arts and culture.
31.946	What might the connections be
31.946	when we start exploring our heritage,
37.323	the beautiful locations
37.323	and the art in this world?
41.427	Before we get started
41.427	in this presentation,
44.225	I just want to take care
44.225	of a few housekeeping points.
47.651	First, I am no expert in art or culture.
51.023	I fell into this by mistake,
51.023	but I'm loving it.
54.356	Secondly, all of what
54.356	I'm going to show you
57.376	belongs to the amazing museums,
57.376	archives and foundations
61.365	that we partner with.
62.815	None of this belongs to Google.
65.235	And finally, what you see behind me
68.448	is available right now
68.448	on your mobile phones,
71.823	on your laptops.
73.021	This is our current platform,
73.021	where you can explore
75.449	thousands of museums
75.449	and objects at your fingertips,
78.884	in extremely high-definition detail.
81.419	The diversity of the content
81.419	is what's amazing.
84.336	If we just had European paintings,
86.529	if we just had modern art,
88.284	I think it gets a bit boring.
90.11	For example, this month,
90.11	"we launched the ""Black History"" channel"
93.993	with 82 curated exhibitions,
96.606	which talk about arts and culture
96.606	in that community.
100.196	We also have some
100.196	amazing objects from Japan,
103.843	centered around craftsmanship,
103.843	"called ""Made in Japan."""
107.971	And one of my favorite exhibitions,
111.122	which actually is the idea of my talk,
113.551	is -- I didn't expect to become
113.551	a fan of Japanese dolls.
117.438	But I am, thanks to this exhibition,
120.626	that has really taught me
120.626	about the craftsmanship
124.135	behind the soul of a Japanese doll.
126.281	Trust me, it's very exciting.
128.533	Take my word for it.
129.905	So, moving on swiftly.
131.938	One quick thing I wanted
131.938	to showcase in this platform,
134.794	which you can share with your kids
134.794	and your friends right now,
137.753	is you can travel to all these
137.753	amazing institutions virtually, as well.
142.033	One of our recent ideas was with
142.033	The Guggenheim Museum in New York,
145.643	where you can get a taste
145.643	of what it might feel like
149.025	to actually be there.
150.2	You can go to the ground floor
151.991	and obviously, most of you,
151.991	I assume, have been there.
154.704	And you can see the architectural
154.704	masterpiece that it is.
157.465	But imagine this accessibility
157.465	for a kid in Bombay
160.583	who's studying architecture,
162.327	who hasn't had a chance
162.327	to go to The Guggenheim as yet.
165.406	You can obviously look at objects
165.406	in the Guggenheim Museum,
168.515	you can obviously get into them
168.515	and so on and so forth.
171.257	There's a lot of information here.
173.156	But this is not the purpose
173.156	of my talk today.
177.543	This exists right now.
179.333	What we now have are the building blocks
179.333	to a very exciting future,
183.283	when it comes to arts and culture
185.022	and accessibility to arts and culture.
187.657	So I am joined today onstage
187.657	by my good friend and artist in residence
192.149	at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,
194.516	who is the professor of interactive design
196.669	at ECAL University
196.669	in Lausanne, Switzerland.
199.33	What Cyril and our team
199.33	of engineers have been doing
201.968	is trying to find these connections
201.968	and visualize a few of these.
205.127	So I'm going to go quite quick now.
206.964	This object you see
206.964	behind me -- oh, just clarification:
210.59	Always, seeing the real thing is better.
212.565	In case people think
212.565	I'm trying to replicate the real thing.
215.452	So, moving on.
217.155	This object you see behind me
217.155	is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.
220.695	It's one of the oldest
220.695	objects in the world,
222.795	found in the Golan Heights
222.795	around 233,000 years ago,
225.993	and currently residing
225.993	at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
229.146	It is also one of the oldest
229.146	objects on our platform.
232.322	So let's zoom.
233.692	We start from this one object.
235.986	What if we zoomed out
238.546	and actually tried to experience
238.546	our own cultural big bang?
243.076	What might that look like?
245.474	This is what we deal with on a daily basis
245.474	at the Cultural Institute --
249.155	over six million cultural artifacts
249.155	curated and given to us by institutions,
254.141	to actually make these connections.
256.111	You can travel through time,
257.534	you can understand more
257.534	about our society through these.
261.069	You can look at it
261.069	from the perspective of our planet,
265.493	and try to see how
265.493	it might look without borders,
268.152	if we just organized art and culture.
270.847	We can also then plot it by time,
273.099	which obviously, for the data geek
273.099	in me, is very fascinating.
277.203	You can spend hours
277.203	looking at every decade
280.613	and the contributions
280.613	in that decade and in those years
283.953	for art, history and cultures.
286.31	We would love to spend hours
286.31	showing you each and every decade,
289.713	but we don't have the time right now.
291.598	So you can go on your phone
291.598	and actually do it yourself.
294.881	(Applause)
298.367	But if you don't mind
298.367	and can hold your applause till later,
301.493	I don't want to run out of time,
303.065	because I want to show you
303.065	a lot of cool stuff.
305.288	So, just very quickly:
306.812	you can move on from here
306.812	to another very interesting idea.
310.822	Beyond the pretty picture,
312.557	beyond the nice visualization,
314.37	what is the purpose, how is this useful?
316.721	This next idea comes
316.721	from discussions with curators
321.474	that we've been having at museums,
323.133	who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,
325.18	because they dedicate their whole life
325.18	to try to tell these stories.
328.398	One of the curators told me,
328.398	"""Amit, what would it be like"
331.353	if you could create
331.353	a virtual curator's table
333.856	where all these six million objects
336.183	are displayed in a way for us
336.183	"to look at the connections between them?"""
340.61	You can spend a lot of time, trust me,
340.61	looking at different objects
344.663	and understanding where they come from.
346.64	It's a crazy Matrix experience.
348.872	(Laughter)
349.91	Just moving on,
351.22	let's take the world-famous
351.22	Vincent Van Gogh,
354.415	who is very well-represented
354.415	on this platform.
358.154	Thanks to the diversity
358.154	of the institutions we have,
360.954	we have over 211 high-definition,
360.954	amazing artworks by this artist,
366.682	now organized in one beautiful view.
370.453	And as it resolves,
370.453	and as Cyril goes deeper,
373.45	you can see all the self-portraits,
375.683	you can see still life.
377.132	But I just wanted to highlight
377.132	one very quick example,
379.759	which is very timely:
381.471	"""The Bedroom."""
382.806	This is an artwork
382.806	where three copies exist --
385.131	one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,
387.485	one at the Orsay in Paris
389.496	and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,
391.454	which, actually, currently
391.454	is hosting a reunion
393.981	of all three artworks physically,
395.78	I think only for the second time ever.
397.941	But, it is united digitally and virtually
397.941	for anybody to look at
402.884	in a very different way,
404.829	and you won't get pushed
404.829	in the line in the crowd.
407.886	So let's take you and let's travel
407.886	"through ""The Bedroom"" very quickly,"
412.652	so you can experience what we are doing
412.652	for every single object.
416.263	We want the image to speak
416.263	as much as it can
419.738	on a digital platform.
421.406	And all you need is an internet
421.406	connection and a computer
424.577	(Applause)
428.939	And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.
431.521	I'm sorry, this is all live,
433.029	so you have to give Cyril
433.029	a little bit of --
436.401	and this is available for every object:
438.485	modern art, contemporary art,
438.485	Renaissance -- you name it,
441.224	even sculpture.
443.802	Sometimes, you don't know
443.802	what can attract you
447.421	to an artwork or to a museum
447.421	or to a cultural discovery.
452.673	So for me, personally,
452.673	it was quite a challenge
455.439	because when I decided to make this
455.439	my full-time job at Google,
458.685	my mother was not very supportive.
461.312	I love my mother,
462.583	but she thought I was wasting my life
462.583	with this museum stuff.
465.606	And for her, a museum is what
465.606	you do when you go on vacation
468.942	and you tick-mark and it's over, right?
470.933	And it took around four and a half years
473.488	for me to convince my lovely Indian mother
475.726	that actually, this is worthwhile.
477.403	And the way I did it was,
477.403	I realized one day that she loves gold.
480.868	So I started showing her all objects
480.868	that have the material gold in them.
486.467	And the first thing my mom asks me is,
489.142	"""How can we buy these?"""
491.594	(Laughter)
493.436	And obviously, my salary is not that high,
496.602	"so I was like, ""We can't"
496.602	actually do that, mom.
499.004	"But you can explore them virtually."""
501.139	And so now my mom -- every time
501.139	I meet her, she asks me,
504.582	"""Any more gold, any more silver"
504.582	"in your project? Can you show me?"""
508.072	And that's the idea
508.072	I'm trying to illustrate.
510.27	It does not matter how you get in,
512.432	as long as you get in.
513.818	Once you get in, you're hooked.
515.452	Moving on from here very quickly,
517.825	there is kind of a playful idea, actually,
520.698	to illustrate the point of access,
522.357	and I'm going to go
522.357	quite quickly on this one.
524.803	We all know that seeing the artwork
524.803	in person is amazing.
530.234	But we also know
530.234	that most of us can't do it,
532.841	and the ones that can afford
532.841	to do it, it's complicated.
535.623	So -- Cyril, can we load
535.623	up our art trip, what do we call it?
539.454	We don't have a good name for this.
541.24	But essentially, we have
541.24	around 1,000 amazing institutions,
547.426	But let's start with Rembrandt.
549.15	We might have time for only one example.
551.416	But thanks to the diversity,
553.669	we've got around 500 amazing
553.669	Rembrandt object artworks
557.597	from 46 institutions and 17 countries.
559.89	Let's say that on your next vacation,
562.466	you want to go see
562.466	every single one of them.
564.54	That is your itinerary,
565.898	you will probably travel
569.576	visit around, I think, 46 institutions,
572.187	and just FYI, you might release
576.402	(Laughter)
577.889	But remember, it's art,
579.386	so you can justify it,
579.386	perhaps, in some way.
582.837	Moving on swiftly from here,
584.783	is something a little bit
584.783	more technical and more interesting.
587.742	All that we've shown you so far
587.742	uses metadata to make the connections.
592.703	But obviously we have
592.703	something cool nowadays
594.837	that everyone likes to talk about,
594.837	which is machine learning.
597.773	So what we thought is,
597.773	let's strip out all the metadata,
600.871	let's look at what machine learning can do
604.507	based purely on visual recognition
604.507	of this entire collection.
608.854	What we ended up with
608.854	is this very interesting map,
613.071	these clusters that have
613.071	no reference point information,
617.405	but has just used visuals
617.405	to cluster things together.
621.394	Each cluster is an art to us
621.394	by itself of discovery.
625	But one of the clusters we want
625	to show you very quickly
627.687	is this amazing cluster of portraits
630.363	that we found from museums
630.363	around the world.
632.789	If you could zoom in
632.789	a little bit more, Cyril.
634.996	Just to show you, you can
634.996	just travel through portraits.
638.852	And essentially, you can do nature,
638.852	you can do horses
641.65	and clusters galore.
644.309	When we saw all these portraits,
645.881	"we were like, ""Hey, can we do"
645.881	something fun for kids,
649.557	or can we do something playful
651.263	"to get people interested in portraits?"""
653.312	Because I haven't really seen
655.516	young kids really excited
655.516	to go to a portrait gallery.
659.357	I wanted to try to figure something out.
661.313	So we created something
661.313	called the portrait matcher.
663.804	It's quite self-explanatory,
665.145	so I'm just going to let Cyril
665.145	show his beautiful face.
667.907	And essentially what's happening is,
667.907	with the movement of his head,
672.063	we are matching different portraits
672.063	around the world from museums.
676.254	(Applause)
689.445	And I don't know about you,
691.175	but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,
693.215	and the reaction is just phenomenal.
695.088	All they ask me is,
695.088	"""When can we go see this?"""
699.492	And by the way, if we're nice,
701.089	maybe, Cyril, you can smile
701.089	and find a happy one?
704.696	Oh, perfect.
706.118	By the way, this is not rehearsed.
708.474	Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.
711.078	OK, let's move on; otherwise,
711.078	this will just take the whole time.
714.578	(Applause)
716.32	So, art and culture
716.32	can be fun also, right?
719.9	For our last quick experiment --
723.321	"we call all of these ""experiments"" --"
725.108	our last quick experiment
725.108	comes back to machine learning.
728.021	We show you clusters, visual clusters,
730.886	but what if we could ask the machine
730.886	to also name these clusters?
735.811	What if it could automatically tag
735.811	them, using no actual metadata?
740.588	So what we have is this kind of explorer,
744.712	where we have managed to match,
744.712	I think, around 4,000 labels.
748.347	And we haven't really
748.347	done anything special here,
751.535	just fed the collection.
753.217	And we found interesting categories.
755.011	We can start with horses,
755.011	a very straightforward category.
757.94	You would expect to see
757.94	that the machine has put
760.263	images of horses, right?
762.028	And it has, but you also notice,
762.028	right over there,
765.494	that it has a very abstract image
767.597	that it has still managed to recognize
767.597	and cluster as horses.
770.816	We also have an amazing head
770.816	in terms of a horse.
774.53	And each one has the tags
774.53	as to why it got categorized in this.
778.556	So let's move to another one
778.556	which I found very funny and interesting,
782.554	because I don't understand
782.554	how this category came up.
785.069	"It's called ""Lady in Waiting."""
786.843	If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,
789.479	you will see that we have
789.479	these amazing images
793.045	of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.
795.83	I don't really understand it.
797.3	But I've been trying to ask
797.3	my museum contacts,
799.564	"you know, ""What is this?"
799.564	"What's going on here?"""
801.833	And it's fascinating.
803.469	Coming back to gold very quickly,
806.182	I wanted to search for gold
807.769	and see how the machine
807.769	tagged all the gold.
809.895	But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.
812.32	We are living in popular times.
813.859	"It tags it as ""bling-bling."""
815.986	(Laughter)
819.2	I'm being hard on Cyril,
819.2	because I'm moving too fast.
822.145	Essentially, here you have
822.145	all the bling-bling
824.796	of the world's museums organized for you.
827.981	And finally, to end this talk
827.981	and these experiments,
831.521	what I hope you feel after this talk
831.521	is happiness and emotion.
834.862	And what would we see
834.862	when we see happiness?
837.325	If we actually look at all the objects
840.508	"that have been tagged under ""happiness,"""
842.476	you would expect happiness, I guess.
845.564	But there was one that came up
845.564	that was very fascinating and interesting,
851.691	which was this artwork
851.691	by Douglas Coupland,
856.09	our friend and artist
856.09	in residence as well,
858.209	"called, ""I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."""
860.494	I don't know why the machine feels like
860.494	it misses its pre-Internet brain
864.133	and it's been tagged here,
865.427	but it's a very interesting thought.
867.365	I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,
869.572	but not when it comes to exploring
869.572	arts and culture online.
872.596	So take out your phones,
872.596	take out your computers,
874.933	go visit museums.
876.114	And just a quick call-out
876.114	to all the amazing archivists,
878.817	historians, curators,
880.225	who are sitting in museums,
880.225	preserving all this culture.
883.021	And the least we can do is get
883.021	our daily dose of art and culture
886.363	for ourselves and our kids.
887.718	Thank you.
888.895	(Applause)
