12.919	So, I have an overlooked
12.919	but potentially lucrative
17.285	investment opportunity for you.
20.447	Over the past 10 years in the UK,
22.885	the return on burial plots
22.885	has outperformed the UK property market
26.344	by a ratio of around three to one.
29.924	There are private cemeteries being set up
29.924	with plots for sale to investors,
33.77	and they start at around 3,900 pounds.
36.938	And they're projected to achieve
36.938	about 40 percent growth.
40.484	The biggest advantage is that this
40.484	is a market with continuous demand.
47.996	Now, this is a real proposition,
50.085	and there are companies out there
50.085	that really are offering this investment,
54.555	but my interest in it is quite different.
57.713	I'm an architect and urban designer,
59.779	and for the past year and a half,
61.394	I've been looking at approaches
61.394	to death and dying
64.418	and at how they've shaped our cities
64.418	and the buildings within them.
68.515	So in the summer,
68.515	I did my first exhibition
71.699	on death and architecture in Venice,
74.239	"and it was called ""Death in Venice."""
76.563	And because death is a subject
78.588	that many of us find quite
78.588	uncomfortable to talk about,
81.669	the exhibition was designed
81.669	to be quite playful,
84.018	so that people would
84.018	literally engage with it.
86.882	So one of our exhibits
86.882	was an interactive map of London
90.451	which showed just how much
90.451	of the real estate in the city
93.493	is given over to death.
95.467	As you wave your hand across the map,
97.673	the name of the piece of real estate --
97.673	the building or the cemetery --
101.202	is revealed.
102.733	And those white shapes that you can see,
105.497	they're all of the hospitals and hospices
108.43	and mortuaries and cemeteries in the city.
111.185	In fact, the majority are cemeteries.
113.652	We wanted to show that, even though
113.652	death and burial are things
118.378	that we might not think about,
119.893	they're all around us, and they're
119.893	important parts of our cities.
124.035	So about half a million people
124.035	die in the UK each year,
128.519	and of those, around a quarter
128.519	will want to be buried.
131.572	But the UK, like many
131.572	Western European countries,
135.536	is running out of burial space,
137.235	especially in the major cities.
139.67	And the Greater London Authority
139.67	has been aware of this for a while,
143.21	and the main causes are population growth,
146.702	the fact that existing
146.702	cemeteries are almost full.
149.567	There's a custom in the UK that graves
149.567	are considered to be occupied forever,
153.898	and there's also development pressure --
153.898	people want to use that same land
157.649	to build houses or offices or shops.
161.896	So they came up with a few solutions.
163.721	They were like, well, maybe we can
163.721	reuse those graves after 50 years.
167.788	Or maybe we can bury people,
167.788	like, four deep,
170.125	so that four people can be buried
170.125	in the same plot,
173.137	and we can make more efficient use
173.137	of the land that way,
175.804	and in that way, hopefully London
175.804	will still have space to bury people
179.168	in the near future.
181.106	But, traditionally, cemeteries
181.106	haven't been taken care of
183.792	by the local authority.
185.556	In fact, the surprising thing is that
185.556	there's no legal obligation
188.946	on anyone in the UK
188.946	to provide burial space.
192.499	Traditionally, it's been done
192.499	by private and religious organizations,
197.306	like churches and mosques and synagogues.
200.51	But there's also occasionally
200.51	been a for-profit group
204.459	who has wanted to get in on the act.
206.5	And, you know, they look at
206.5	the small size of a burial plot
210.029	and that high cost,
211.721	and it looks like there's
211.721	serious money to be made.
214.58	So, actually, if you want to go out
214.58	and start your own cemetery,
218.318	you kind of can.
219.765	There was this couple in South Wales,
221.925	and they had a farmhouse
221.925	and a load of fields next to it,
225.185	and they wanted to develop the land.
227.34	They had a load of ideas.
228.765	They first thought about making
228.765	a caravan park,
231.903	but the council said no.
233.641	And then they wanted to make a fish farm
235.633	and again the council said no.
237.751	Then they hit on the idea
237.751	of making a cemetery
240.446	and they calculated that by doing this,
242.526	they could increase
242.526	the value of their land
245.067	from about 95,000 pounds
245.067	to over one million pounds.
250.802	But just to come back to this idea
250.802	of making profit from cemeteries,
255.585	like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?
258.267	The thing is that the high cost
258.267	of those burial plots
261.804	is actually very misleading.
263.944	They look like they're expensive,
265.755	but that cost reflects the fact that
265.755	you need to maintain the burial plot --
269.981	like, someone has to cut the grass
269.981	for the next 50 years.
273.313	That means it's very difficult
273.313	to make money from cemeteries.
276.234	And it's the reason that normally
276.234	they're run by the council
279.083	or by a not-for-profit group.
281.103	But anyway, the council granted
281.103	these people permission,
283.778	and they're now trying
283.778	to build their cemetery.
286.253	So just to explain to you
286.253	kind of how this works:
289.597	If I want to build something in the UK,
291.678	like a cemetery for example,
293.894	then I have to apply
293.894	for planning permission first.
296.892	So if I want to build a new
296.892	office building for a client
301.126	or if I want to extend my home
303.404	or, you know, if I have a shop
303.404	and I want to convert it into an office,
307.197	I have to do a load of drawings,
308.752	and I submit them
308.752	to the council for permission.
311.212	And they'll look at things like
311.212	how it fits in the surroundings.
315.193	So they'll look at what it looks like.
317.249	But they'll also think about things
317.249	like what impact is it going to have
320.869	on the local environment?
322.368	And they'll be thinking about things like,
324.432	is this thing going to cause pollution
326.297	or is there going to be a lot of traffic
328.249	that wants to go to this thing
328.249	that I've built?
330.606	But also good things.
332.01	Is it going to add local services
332.01	like shops to the neighborhood
335.351	that local people would like to use?
338.183	And they'll weigh up the advantages
338.183	and the disadvantages
340.901	and they'll make a decision.
342.908	So that's how it works if I want
342.908	to build a large cemetery.
347.356	But what if I've got a piece of land
349.374	and I just want to bury
349.374	a few people, like five or six?
353.533	Well, then -- actually, I don't need
353.533	permission from anyone!
357.85	There's actually almost no regulation
357.85	in the UK around burial,
362.24	and the little bit that there is,
362.24	is about not polluting water courses,
365.907	like not polluting rivers or groundwater.
368.962	So actually, if you want to go
368.962	and make your own mini-cemetery,
372.01	then you can.
373.329	But I mean, like -- really,
373.329	who does this? Right?
378.011	Well, if you're an aristocratic family
378.011	and you have a large estate,
381.653	then there's a chance that you'll
381.653	have a mausoleum on it,
384.36	and you'll bury your family there.
386.708	But the really weird thing
388.891	is that you don't need to have
388.891	a piece of land of a certain size
392.284	before you're allowed
392.284	to start burying people on it.
394.91	And so that means that, technically,
396.879	this applies to, like, the back garden
396.879	of your house in the suburbs.
400.592	(Laughter)
402.37	So what if you wanted
402.37	to try this yourself at home?
406.418	Well, there's a few councils
406.418	that have guidance on their website
410.49	which can help you.
411.901	So, the first thing that they tell you
414.019	is that you need to have a certificate
414.019	of burial before you can go ahead --
417.779	you're not allowed to just murder people
417.779	and put them under the patio.
421.151	(Laughter)
424.253	They also tell you that you need to keep
424.253	a record of where the grave is.
428.08	But that's pretty much it
428.08	for formal requirements.
430.737	Now, they do warn you that
430.737	your neighbors might not like this,
433.763	but, legally speaking, there's almost
433.763	nothing that they can do about it.
437.69	And just in case any of you
437.69	still had that profit idea in your mind
442.88	about how much those burial plots cost
445.165	and how much money
445.165	you might be able to make,
447.537	they also warn that it might cause
447.537	the value of your house
450.307	to drop by 20 percent.
452.515	Although, actually, it's more likely
454.286	that no one will want to buy
454.286	your house at all after that.
458.341	So what I find fascinating about this
460.924	is the fact that it kind of sums up
460.924	many of our attitudes towards death.
466.28	In the UK, and I think that the figures
466.28	across Europe are probably similar,
470.72	only about 30 percent of people
470.72	have ever talked to anyone
473.855	about their wishes around death,
475.571	and even for people over 75,
477.505	only 45 percent of people
477.505	have ever talked about this.
481.464	And the reasons that
481.464	people give ... you know,
484.163	they think that their death is far off
486.008	or they think that they're going
486.008	to make people uncomfortable
488.909	by talking about it.
490.319	And you know, to a certain extent,
492.098	there are other people out there
492.098	who are taking care of things for us.
495.76	The government has all this regulation
495.76	and bureaucracy around things
499.465	like burying a death, for example,
501.722	and there's people like funeral directors
503.715	who devote their entire
503.715	working lives to this issue.
506.335	But when it comes to our cities
507.865	and thinking about how
507.865	death fits in our cities,
510.931	there's much less regulation
510.931	and design and thought
515.004	than we might imagine.
516.344	So we're not thinking about this,
518.582	but all of the people we imagine
518.582	are thinking about it --
521.506	they're not taking care of it either.
523.575	Thank you.
524.757	(Applause)
