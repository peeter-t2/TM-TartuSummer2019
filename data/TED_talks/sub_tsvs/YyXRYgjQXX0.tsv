12.837	I want you to look
12.837	around the room for a minute
15.128	and try to find the most
15.128	paranoid person here --
17.871	(Laughter)
18.959	And then I want you to point
18.959	at that person for me.
21.435	(Laughter)
22.494	OK, don't actually do it.
23.877	(Laughter)
25.02	But, as an organizational psychologist,
26.913	I spend a lot of time in workplaces,
28.819	and I find paranoia everywhere.
31.532	Paranoia is caused by people
31.532	"that I call ""takers."""
33.965	Takers are self-serving
33.965	in their interactions.
36.172	It's all about what can you do for me.
38.832	The opposite is a giver.
40.257	It's somebody who approaches
40.257	most interactions by asking,
43.041	"""What can I do for you?"""
45.165	I wanted to give you a chance
45.165	to think about your own style.
48.06	We all have moments of giving and taking.
50.037	Your style is how you treat
50.037	most of the people most of the time,
53.077	your default.
54.259	I have a short test you can take
55.825	to figure out if you're more
55.825	of a giver or a taker,
58.348	and you can take it right now.
59.85	[The Narcissist Test]
61.313	[Step 1: Take a moment
61.313	to think about yourself.]
63.649	(Laughter)
64.776	[Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,
64.776	you are not a narcissist.]
67.658	(Laughter)
70.082	This is the only thing I will say today
70.082	that has no data behind it,
73.939	but I am convinced the longer it takes
73.939	for you to laugh at this cartoon,
77.395	the more worried we should be
77.395	that you're a taker.
79.846	(Laughter)
80.935	Of course, not all takers are narcissists.
82.991	Some are just givers who got burned
82.991	one too many times.
85.903	Then there's another kind of taker
85.903	that we won't be addressing today,
89.251	and that's called a psychopath.
91.128	(Laughter)
92.303	I was curious, though, about how
92.303	common these extremes are,
95.199	and so I surveyed over 30,000
95.199	people across industries
98.032	around the world's cultures.
99.668	And I found that most people
99.668	are right in the middle
102.17	between giving and taking.
103.66	They choose this third style
103.66	"called ""matching."""
106.029	If you're a matcher, you try to keep
106.029	an even balance of give and take:
109.398	quid pro quo -- I'll do something
109.398	for you if you do something for me.
112.74	And that seems like a safe way
112.74	to live your life.
115.145	But is it the most effective
115.145	and productive way to live your life?
118.353	The answer to that question
118.353	is a very definitive ...
120.841	maybe.
122.023	(Laughter)
123.273	I studied dozens of organizations,
125.476	thousands of people.
126.675	I had engineers measuring
126.675	their productivity.
130.251	(Laughter)
132.63	I looked at medical students' grades --
135.623	even salespeople's revenue.
137.622	(Laughter)
139.092	And, unexpectedly,
140.768	the worst performers in each
140.768	of these jobs were the givers.
144.749	The engineers who got the least work done
146.817	were the ones who did more favors
146.817	than they got back.
149.347	They were so busy doing
149.347	other people's jobs,
151.507	they literally ran out of time and energy
151.507	to get their own work completed.
155.081	In medical school, the lowest grades
155.081	belong to the students
157.91	who agree most strongly
157.91	with statements like,
160.041	"""I love helping others,"""
163.068	which suggests the doctor
163.068	you ought to trust
165.316	is the one who came to med school
165.316	with no desire to help anybody.
168.419	(Laughter)
169.47	And then in sales, too,
169.47	the lowest revenue accrued
171.852	in the most generous salespeople.
173.571	I actually reached out
173.571	to one of those salespeople
176.025	who had a very high giver score.
177.656	"And I asked him, ""Why do"
177.656	"you suck at your job --"""
180.238	I didn't ask it that way, but --
181.803	(Laughter)
182.871	"""What's the cost of generosity in sales?"""
185.247	"And he said, ""Well, I just care"
185.247	so deeply about my customers
188.537	that I would never sell them
188.537	"one of our crappy products."""
191.323	(Laughter)
192.748	So just out of curiosity,
194	how many of you self-identify more
194	as givers than takers or matchers?
197.308	Raise your hands.
198.962	OK, it would have been more
198.962	before we talked about these data.
202.525	But actually, it turns out
202.525	there's a twist here,
206.176	because givers are often
206.176	sacrificing themselves,
209.496	but they make their organizations better.
212.345	We have a huge body of evidence --
215.136	many, many studies looking
215.136	at the frequency of giving behavior
218.893	that exists in a team
218.893	or an organization --
221.054	and the more often people are helping
221.054	and sharing their knowledge
224.164	and providing mentoring,
225.341	the better organizations do
225.341	on every metric we can measure:
228.142	higher profits, customer satisfaction,
228.142	employee retention --
230.997	even lower operating expenses.
233.407	So givers spend a lot of time
233.407	trying to help other people
236.299	and improve the team,
237.53	and then, unfortunately,
237.53	they suffer along the way.
240.03	I want to talk about what it takes
241.722	to build cultures where givers
241.722	actually get to succeed.
245.564	So I wondered, then, if givers
245.564	are the worst performers,
248.608	who are the best performers?
251.438	Let me start with the good news:
251.438	it's not the takers.
254.112	Takers tend to rise quickly
254.112	but also fall quickly in most jobs.
257.791	And they fall at the hands of matchers.
259.912	If you're a matcher, you believe
259.912	"in ""An eye for an eye"" -- a just world."
263.356	And so when you meet a taker,
264.8	you feel like it's your mission in life
266.693	to just punish the hell
266.693	out of that person.
268.759	(Laughter)
269.797	And that way justice gets served.
272.108	Well, most people are matchers.
274.102	And that means if you're a taker,
275.71	it tends to catch up with you eventually;
277.714	what goes around will come around.
279.376	And so the logical conclusion is:
281.006	it must be the matchers
281.006	who are the best performers.
283.895	But they're not.
285.437	In every job, in every organization
285.437	I've ever studied,
288.311	the best results belong
288.311	to the givers again.
291.651	Take a look at some data I gathered
291.651	from hundreds of salespeople,
294.833	tracking their revenue.
296.01	What you can see is that the givers
296.01	go to both extremes.
298.689	They make up the majority of people
298.689	who bring in the lowest revenue,
301.931	but also the highest revenue.
303.421	The same patterns were true
303.421	for engineers' productivity
306.049	and medical students' grades.
307.464	Givers are overrepresented
307.464	at the bottom and at the top
310.095	of every success metric that I can track.
312.201	Which raises the question:
313.527	How do we create a world
313.527	where more of these givers get to excel?
316.96	I want to talk about how to do that,
316.96	not just in businesses,
319.807	but also in nonprofits, schools --
321.662	even governments.
322.979	Are you ready?
324.209	(Cheers)
325.419	I was going to do it anyway,
325.419	but I appreciate the enthusiasm.
328.435	(Laughter)
329.482	The first thing that's really critical
331.35	is to recognize that givers
331.35	are your most valuable people,
334.121	but if they're not careful, they burn out.
336.579	So you have to protect
336.579	the givers in your midst.
339.093	And I learned a great lesson about this
339.093	from Fortune's best networker.
344.993	It's the guy, not the cat.
346.367	(Laughter)
347.551	His name is Adam Rifkin.
349.331	He's a very successful serial entrepreneur
351.567	who spends a huge amount
351.567	of his time helping other people.
354.385	And his secret weapon
354.385	is the five-minute favor.
357.261	"Adam said, ""You don't have to be"
357.261	Mother Teresa or Gandhi
359.944	to be a giver.
361.151	You just have to find small ways
361.151	to add large value
363.678	"to other people's lives."""
365.059	That could be as simple
365.059	as making an introduction
367.426	between two people who could
367.426	benefit from knowing each other.
370.381	It could be sharing your knowledge
370.381	or giving a little bit of feedback.
373.742	Or It might be even something
373.742	as basic as saying,
376.078	"""You know,"
377.331	I'm going to try and figure out
378.855	if I can recognize somebody
378.855	"whose work has gone unnoticed."""
382.462	And those five-minute favors
382.462	are really critical
384.78	to helping givers set boundaries
384.78	and protect themselves.
387.962	The second thing that matters
389.431	if you want to build a culture
389.431	where givers succeed,
391.923	is you actually need a culture
391.923	where help-seeking is the norm;
394.872	where people ask a lot.
396.536	This may hit a little too close
396.536	to home for some of you.
399.229	[So in all your relationships,
399.229	you always have to be the giver?]
402.292	(Laughter)
403.34	What you see with successful givers
405.095	is they recognize that it's OK
405.095	to be a receiver, too.
408.754	If you run an organization,
408.754	we can actually make this easier.
411.641	We can make it easier
411.641	for people to ask for help.
413.962	A couple colleagues and I
413.962	studied hospitals.
416.058	We found that on certain floors,
416.058	nurses did a lot of help-seeking,
419.284	and on other floors,
419.284	they did very little of it.
421.559	The factor that stood out on the floors
421.559	where help-seeking was common,
424.929	where it was the norm,
426.104	was there was just one nurse
426.104	whose sole job it was
428.503	to help other nurses on the unit.
430.558	When that role was available,
431.963	"nurses said, ""It's not embarrassing,"
431.963	it's not vulnerable to ask for help --
435.644	"it's actually encouraged."""
438.263	Help-seeking isn't important
438.263	just for protecting the success
441.113	and the well-being of givers.
442.536	It's also critical to getting
442.536	more people to act like givers,
445.492	because the data say
446.705	that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent
446.705	of all giving in organizations
450.129	starts with a request.
451.996	But a lot of people don't ask.
453.468	They don't want to look incompetent,
455.24	they don't know where to turn,
455.24	they don't want to burden others.
458.291	Yet if nobody ever asks for help,
460.024	you have a lot of frustrated givers
460.024	in your organization
462.723	who would love to step up and contribute,
464.73	if they only knew
464.73	who could benefit and how.
467.413	But I think the most important thing,
469.235	if you want to build a culture
469.235	of successful givers,
471.735	is to be thoughtful about who
471.735	you let onto your team.
474.561	I figured, you want a culture
474.561	of productive generosity,
477.601	you should hire a bunch of givers.
479.597	But I was surprised to discover, actually,
479.597	that that was not right --
483.715	that the negative impact
483.715	of a taker on a culture
486.214	is usually double to triple
486.214	the positive impact of a giver.
489.53	Think about it this way:
490.704	one bad apple can spoil a barrel,
492.392	but one good egg
492.392	just does not make a dozen.
495.942	I don't know what that means --
497.518	(Laughter)
498.661	But I hope you do.
500.058	No -- let even one taker into a team,
503.404	and you will see that the givers
503.404	will stop helping.
506.648	"They'll say, ""I'm surrounded"
506.648	by a bunch of snakes and sharks.
509.602	"Why should I contribute?"""
510.992	Whereas if you let one giver into a team,
512.992	you don't get an explosion of generosity.
515.138	More often, people are like,
516.583	"""Great! That person can do all our work."""
519.077	So, effective hiring and screening
519.077	and team building
521.847	is not about bringing in the givers;
524.007	it's about weeding out the takers.
527.036	If you can do that well,
528.211	you'll be left with givers and matchers.
530.177	The givers will be generous
531.566	because they don't have to worry
531.566	about the consequences.
534.224	And the beauty of the matchers
534.224	is that they follow the norm.
537.361	So how do you catch a taker
537.361	before it's too late?
540.745	We're actually pretty bad
540.745	at figuring out who's a taker,
543.656	especially on first impressions.
545.506	There's a personality trait
545.506	that throws us off.
547.838	It's called agreeableness,
549.167	one the major dimensions
549.167	of personality across cultures.
551.812	Agreeable people are warm and friendly,
551.812	they're nice, they're polite.
555.321	You find a lot of them in Canada --
557.136	(Laughter)
558.763	Where there was actually
558.763	a national contest
562.284	to come up with a new Canadian slogan
562.284	and fill in the blank,
565.338	"""As Canadian as ..."""
566.937	I thought the winning entry
566.937	was going to be,
569.045	"""As Canadian as maple syrup,"""
569.045	"or, ""... ice hockey."""
571.54	But no, Canadians voted
571.54	for their new national slogan to be --
574.549	I kid you not --
575.734	"""As Canadian as possible"
575.734	"under the circumstances."""
578.189	(Laughter)
582.02	Now for those of you
582.02	who are highly agreeable,
584.415	or maybe slightly Canadian,
585.832	you get this right away.
587.229	How could I ever say I'm any one thing
589.07	when I'm constantly adapting
589.07	to try to please other people?
592.4	Disagreeable people do less of it.
594.247	They're more critical,
594.247	skeptical, challenging,
597.208	and far more likely than their peers
597.208	to go to law school.
600.286	(Laughter)
601.453	That's not a joke,
601.453	that's actually an empirical fact.
604.132	(Laughter)
605.215	So I always assumed
605.215	that agreeable people were givers
607.788	and disagreeable people were takers.
609.759	But then I gathered the data,
611.213	and I was stunned to find
611.213	no correlation between those traits,
614.35	because it turns out
614.35	that agreeableness-disagreeableness
617.033	is your outer veneer:
618.22	How pleasant is it to interact with you?
620.185	Whereas giving and taking
620.185	are more of your inner motives:
622.901	What are your values?
622.901	What are your intentions toward others?
625.817	If you really want to judge
625.817	people accurately,
628.033	you have to get to the moment every
628.033	consultant in the room is waiting for,
631.574	and draw a two-by-two.
632.763	(Laughter)
637.648	The agreeable givers are easy to spot:
639.679	they say yes to everything.
643.74	The disagreeable takers
643.74	are also recognized quickly,
646.637	although you might call them
646.637	by a slightly different name.
650.568	(Laughter)
653.828	We forget about the other
653.828	two combinations.
655.924	There are disagreeable givers
655.924	in our organizations.
659.283	There are people who are gruff
659.283	and tough on the surface
661.948	but underneath have
661.948	others' best interests at heart.
665.089	Or as an engineer put it,
666.476	"""Oh, disagreeable givers --"
668.106	like somebody with a bad user interface
668.106	"but a great operating system."""
672.006	(Laughter)
673.316	If that helps you.
674.711	(Laughter)
676.424	Disagreeable givers are the most
676.424	undervalued people in our organizations,
679.951	because they're the ones
679.951	who give the critical feedback
682.567	that no one wants to hear
682.567	but everyone needs to hear.
685.197	We need to do a much better job
685.197	valuing these people
687.709	as opposed to writing them off early,
689.521	"and saying, ""Eh, kind of prickly,"
691.289	"must be a selfish taker."""
693.849	The other combination we forget about
693.849	is the deadly one --
696.632	the agreeable taker,
696.632	also known as the faker.
700.444	This is the person
700.444	who's nice to your face,
702.533	and then will stab you right in the back.
704.537	(Laughter)
706.537	And my favorite way to catch
706.537	these people in the interview process
709.795	is to ask the question,
711.091	"""Can you give me the names of four people"
713.077	whose careers you have
713.077	"fundamentally improved?"""
716.424	The takers will give you four names,
718.341	and they will all be more
718.341	influential than them,
721.062	because takers are great at kissing up
721.062	and then kicking down.
724.957	Givers are more likely to name people
724.957	who are below them in a hierarchy,
728.381	who don't have as much power,
729.951	who can do them no good.
731.723	And let's face it, you all know
731.723	you can learn a lot about character
734.921	by watching how someone
734.921	treats their restaurant server
737.5	or their Uber driver.
739.319	So if we do all this well,
740.609	if we can weed takers
740.609	out of organizations,
742.717	if we can make it safe to ask for help,
744.653	if we can protect givers from burnout
746.691	and make it OK for them to be ambitious
746.691	in pursuing their own goals
749.942	as well as trying to help other people,
752.122	we can actually change the way
752.122	that people define success.
755.053	Instead of saying it's all about
755.053	winning a competition,
758.429	people will realize success
758.429	is really more about contribution.
762.761	I believe that the most
762.761	meaningful way to succeed
765.146	is to help other people succeed.
767.04	And if we can spread that belief,
768.735	we can actually turn paranoia upside down.
771.41	There's a name for that.
772.597	"It's called ""pronoia."""
775.025	Pronoia is the delusional belief
776.746	that other people
776.746	are plotting your well-being.
779.37	(Laughter)
782.908	That they're going around behind your back
785.485	and saying exceptionally
785.485	glowing things about you.
789.647	The great thing about a culture of givers
789.647	is that's not a delusion --
793.48	it's reality.
795.697	I want to live in a world
795.697	where givers succeed,
798.297	and I hope you will help me
798.297	create that world.
800.643	Thank you.
801.888	(Applause)
