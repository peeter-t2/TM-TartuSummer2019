12.78	I was a blue-eyed,
12.78	chubby-cheeked five-year-old
15.46	when I joined my family
15.46	on the picket line for the first time.
19.66	My mom made me leave
19.66	my dolls in the minivan.
22.62	I'd stand on a street corner
22.62	in the heavy Kansas humidity,
25.74	surrounded by a few dozen relatives,
28.38	with my tiny fists clutching
28.38	a sign that I couldn't read yet:
32.5	"""Gays are worthy of death."""
34.94	This was the beginning.
36.86	Our protests soon became
36.86	a daily occurrence
39.1	and an international phenomenon,
41.06	and as a member
41.06	of Westboro Baptist Church,
43.54	I became a fixture
43.54	on picket lines across the country.
46.7	The end of my antigay picketing career
49.06	and life as I knew it,
50.5	came 20 years later,
52.18	triggered in part by strangers on Twitter
54.7	who showed me the power
54.7	of engaging the other.
59.1	In my home,
60.34	life was framed as an epic
60.34	spiritual battle between good and evil.
64.02	The good was my church and its members,
66.62	and the evil was everyone else.
69.7	My church's antics were such
71.18	that we were constantly
71.18	at odds with the world,
73.62	and that reinforced
73.62	our otherness on a daily basis.
77.46	"""Make a difference"
77.46	"between the unclean and the clean,"""
80.1	the verse says,
81.46	and so we did.
82.82	From baseball games to military funerals,
84.98	we trekked across the country
84.98	with neon protest signs in hand
88.78	to tell others exactly
88.78	"how ""unclean"" they were"
91.78	and exactly why
91.78	they were headed for damnation.
95.26	This was the focus of our whole lives.
98.22	This was the only way for me to do good
98.22	in a world that sits in Satan's lap.
103.18	And like the rest of my 10 siblings,
105.18	I believed what I was taught
105.18	with all my heart,
107.66	and I pursued Westboro's agenda
107.66	with a special sort of zeal.
111.82	In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.
115.38	Initially, the people
115.38	I encountered on the platform
117.82	were just as hostile as I expected.
120.06	They were the digital version
120.06	of the screaming hordes
122.58	I'd been seeing at protests
122.58	since I was a kid.
125.26	But in the midst of that digital brawl,
127.74	a strange pattern developed.
130.1	Someone would arrive at my profile
130.1	with the usual rage and scorn,
134.78	I would respond with a custom mix
134.78	of Bible verses, pop culture references
138.94	and smiley faces.
141.299	They would be understandably
141.299	confused and caught off guard,
145.46	but then a conversation would ensue.
147.94	And it was civil --
149.22	full of genuine curiosity on both sides.
152.18	How had the other come to such
152.18	outrageous conclusions about the world?
156.94	Sometimes the conversation
156.94	even bled into real life.
159.98	People I'd sparred with on Twitter
161.66	would come out
161.66	to the picket line to see me
164.02	when I protested in their city.
166.66	A man named David was one such person.
169.34	"He ran a blog called ""Jewlicious,"""
172.62	and after several months
172.62	of heated but friendly arguments online,
175.74	he came out to see me
175.74	at a picket in New Orleans.
178.74	He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert
178.74	from Jerusalem, where he lives,
182.42	and I brought him kosher chocolate
184.7	"and held a ""God hates Jews"" sign."
186.78	(Laughter)
188.86	There was no confusion
188.86	about our positions,
190.94	but the line between friend and foe
190.94	was becoming blurred.
194.62	We'd started to see each other
194.62	as human beings,
196.9	and it changed the way
196.9	we spoke to one another.
200.1	It took time,
201.34	but eventually these conversations
201.34	planted seeds of doubt in me.
204.9	My friends on Twitter took the time
204.9	to understand Westboro's doctrines,
208.58	and in doing so,
209.82	they were able to find inconsistencies
209.82	I'd missed my entire life.
213.94	Why did we advocate
213.94	the death penalty for gays
216.86	"when Jesus said, ""Let he who is"
216.86	"without sin cast the first stone?"""
221.1	How could we claim to love our neighbor
223.58	while at the same time
223.58	praying for God to destroy them?
227.7	The truth is that the care shown to me
227.7	by these strangers on the internet
231.54	was itself a contradiction.
234.02	It was growing evidence
235.3	that people on the other side were not
235.3	the demons I'd been led to believe.
240.02	These realizations were life-altering.
243.06	Once I saw that we were not
243.06	the ultimate arbiters of divine truth
246.34	but flawed human beings,
248.14	I couldn't pretend otherwise.
250.26	I couldn't justify our actions --
252.74	especially our cruel practice
252.74	of protesting funerals
255.74	and celebrating human tragedy.
259.34	These shifts in my perspective
260.82	contributed to a larger erosion
260.82	of trust in my church,
263.94	and eventually it made it
263.94	impossible for me to stay.
268.5	In spite of overwhelming grief and terror,
268.5	I left Westboro in 2012.
274.58	In those days just after I left,
276.5	the instinct to hide
276.5	was almost paralyzing.
280.06	I wanted to hide
280.06	from the judgement of my family,
282.42	who I knew would never
282.42	speak to me again --
284.66	people whose thoughts and opinions
284.66	had meant everything to me.
288.1	And I wanted to hide from the world
288.1	I'd rejected for so long --
291.5	people who had no reason at all
291.5	to give me a second chance
294.26	after a lifetime of antagonism.
297.42	And yet, unbelievably,
299.02	they did.
300.5	The world had access to my past
300.5	because it was all over the internet --
303.9	thousands of tweets
303.9	and hundreds of interviews,
306.3	everything from local TV news
306.3	"to ""The Howard Stern Show"" --"
309.82	but so many embraced me
309.82	with open arms anyway.
313.62	I wrote an apology
313.62	for the harm I'd caused,
315.74	but I also knew that an apology
315.74	could never undo any of it.
319.78	All I could do was try to build a new life
322.06	and find a way somehow
322.06	to repair some of the damage.
326.38	People had every reason
326.38	to doubt my sincerity,
328.78	but most of them didn't.
330.7	And --
332.5	given my history,
333.74	it was more than I could've hoped for --
335.7	forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.
338.18	It still amazes me.
340.34	I spent my first year away from home
344.3	adrift with my younger sister,
346.02	who had chosen to leave with me.
348.62	We walked into an abyss,
350.18	but we were shocked to find
350.18	the light and a way forward
353.9	in the same communities
353.9	we'd targeted for so long.
357.42	David,
358.66	"my ""Jewlicious"" friend from Twitter,"
360.58	invited us to spend time among
360.58	a Jewish community in Los Angeles.
364.34	We slept on couches in the home
364.34	of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife
367.58	and their four kids --
369.42	the same rabbi that I'd protested
369.42	three years earlier
372.26	with a sign that said,
372.26	"""Your rabbi is a whore."""
376.74	We spent long hours talking
376.74	about theology and Judaism and life
380.7	while we washed dishes
380.7	in their kosher kitchen
382.94	and chopped vegetables for dinner.
385.42	They treated us like family.
387.46	They held nothing against us,
389.58	and again I was astonished.
392.58	That period was full of turmoil,
394.3	but one part I've returned to often
396.62	is a surprising realization
396.62	I had during that time --
400.34	that it was a relief and a privilege
400.34	to let go of the harsh judgments
404.62	that instinctively ran through my mind
404.62	about nearly every person I saw.
409.5	I realized that now I needed to learn.
412.86	I needed to listen.
415.34	This has been at the front
415.34	of my mind lately,
417.5	because I can't help but see
417.5	in our public discourse
420.46	so many of the same destructive impulses
420.46	that ruled my former church.
425.38	We celebrate tolerance and diversity
425.38	more than at any other time in memory,
429.34	and still we grow more and more divided.
432.26	We want good things --
434.18	justice, equality,
434.18	freedom, dignity, prosperity --
437.82	but the path we've chosen
439.14	looks so much like the one
439.14	I walked away from four years ago.
443.18	We've broken the world into us and them,
446.34	only emerging from our bunkers long enough
448.42	to lob rhetorical grenades
448.42	at the other camp.
451.66	We write off half the country
451.66	as out-of-touch liberal elites
455.38	or racist misogynist bullies.
458.02	No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.
462.3	Even when someone does call for empathy
462.3	and understanding for the other side,
466.14	the conversation nearly always devolves
468.06	into a debate about
468.06	who deserves more empathy.
471.54	And just as I learned to do,
473.06	we routinely refuse to acknowledge
473.06	the flaws in our positions
476.62	or the merits in our opponent's.
479.02	Compromise is anathema.
481.42	We even target people on our own side
481.42	when they dare to question the party line.
486.62	This path has brought us cruel,
486.62	sniping, deepening polarization,
491.14	and even outbreaks of violence.
493.38	I remember this path.
495.46	It will not take us where we want to go.
498.9	What gives me hope is that
498.9	we can do something about this.
502.38	The good news is that it's simple,
504.66	and the bad news is that it's hard.
507.02	We have to talk and listen
507.02	to people we disagree with.
511.86	It's hard because we often can't fathom
513.78	how the other side
513.78	came to their positions.
516.62	It's hard because righteous indignation,
519.22	that sense of certainty
519.22	that ours is the right side,
522.42	is so seductive.
524.739	It's hard because it means
524.739	extending empathy and compassion
528.1	to people who show us
528.1	hostility and contempt.
531.42	The impulse to respond in kind
531.42	is so tempting,
535.18	but that isn't who we want to be.
537.14	We can resist.
538.82	And I will always be inspired to do so
538.82	by those people I encountered on Twitter,
543.3	apparent enemies
543.3	who became my beloved friends.
547.02	And in the case of one particularly
547.02	understanding and generous guy,
550.46	my husband.
552.62	There was nothing special
552.62	about the way I responded to him.
556.78	What was special was their approach.
559.9	I thought about it a lot
559.9	over the past few years
562.5	and I found four things
562.5	they did differently
565.38	that made real conversation possible.
568.82	These four steps were small but powerful,
571.18	and I do everything I can to employ them
571.18	in difficult conversations today.
576.06	The first is don't assume bad intent.
580.06	My friends on Twitter realized
581.54	that even when my words
581.54	were aggressive and offensive,
584.5	I sincerely believed
584.5	I was doing the right thing.
587.42	Assuming ill motives
587.42	almost instantly cuts us off
590.42	from truly understanding
590.42	why someone does and believes as they do.
594.74	We forget that they're a human being
596.5	with a lifetime of experience
596.5	that shaped their mind,
599.5	and we get stuck
599.5	on that first wave of anger,
602.22	and the conversation has a very hard time
602.22	ever moving beyond it.
606.62	But when we assume good or neutral intent,
609.3	we give our minds a much stronger
609.3	framework for dialogue.
613.98	The second is ask questions.
617.58	When we engage people
617.58	across ideological divides,
620.18	asking questions
620.18	helps us map the disconnect
622.66	between our differing points of view.
625.02	That's important because
625.02	we can't present effective arguments
627.94	if we don't understand where
627.94	the other side is actually coming from
632.14	and because it gives them an opportunity
632.14	to point out flaws in our positions.
636.9	But asking questions
636.9	serves another purpose;
639.38	it signals to someone
639.38	that they're being heard.
642.58	When my friends on Twitter
642.58	stopped accusing
644.74	and started asking questions,
646.54	I almost automatically mirrored them.
649.58	Their questions gave me room to speak,
651.46	but they also gave me permission
651.46	to ask them questions
654.86	and to truly hear their responses.
657.7	It fundamentally changed
657.7	the dynamic of our conversation.
662.14	The third is stay calm.
664.82	This takes practice and patience,
666.66	but it's powerful.
668.54	At Westboro, I learned not to care
668.54	how my manner of speaking affected others.
672.86	I thought my rightness
672.86	justified my rudeness --
675.94	harsh tones, raised voices,
675.94	insults, interruptions --
679.7	but that strategy
679.7	is ultimately counterproductive.
682.78	Dialing up the volume and the snark
682.78	is natural in stressful situations,
686.58	but it tends to bring the conversation
686.58	to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.
692.42	When my husband was still
692.42	just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,
695.7	our discussions frequently
695.7	became hard and pointed,
698.58	but we always refused to escalate.
701.18	Instead, he would change the subject.
703.14	He would tell a joke or recommend a book
705.38	or gently excuse himself
705.38	from the conversation.
709.38	We knew the discussion wasn't over,
711.26	just paused for a time
711.26	to bring us back to an even keel.
715.42	People often lament that digital
715.42	communication makes us less civil,
718.62	but this is one advantage that online
718.62	conversations have over in-person ones.
723.5	We have a buffer of time and space
726.14	between us and the people
726.14	whose ideas we find so frustrating.
730.1	We can use that buffer.
732.18	Instead of lashing out,
732.18	we can pause, breathe,
735.9	change the subject or walk away,
738.1	and then come back to it when we're ready.
742.02	And finally ...
744.58	make the argument.
747.94	This might seem obvious,
749.26	but one side effect
749.26	of having strong beliefs
751.86	is that we sometimes assume
753.5	that the value of our position
753.5	is or should be obvious and self-evident,
758.62	that we shouldn't
758.62	have to defend our positions
760.86	because they're so clearly right and good
763.98	that if someone doesn't get it,
763.98	it's their problem --
766.58	that it's not my job to educate them.
769.38	But if it were that simple,
770.74	we would all see things the same way.
773.18	As kind as my friends on Twitter were,
775.66	if they hadn't actually
775.66	made their arguments,
778.06	it would've been so much harder for me
778.06	to see the world in a different way.
782.78	We are all a product of our upbringing,
785.22	and our beliefs reflect our experiences.
788.38	We can't expect others
788.38	to spontaneously change their own minds.
792.38	If we want change,
793.82	we have to make the case for it.
796.98	My friends on Twitter didn't abandon
796.98	their beliefs or their principles --
801.06	only their scorn.
803.06	They channeled their
803.06	infinitely justifiable offense
806.7	and came to me with pointed questions
806.7	tempered with kindness and humor.
811.7	They approached me as a human being,
813.82	and that was more transformative
815.42	than two full decades
815.42	of outrage, disdain and violence.
820.58	I know that some might not have
820.58	the time or the energy or the patience
824.38	for extensive engagement,
825.66	but as difficult as it can be,
827.74	reaching out to someone we disagree with
830.26	is an option that is
830.26	available to all of us.
833.1	And I sincerely believe
833.1	that we can do hard things,
836.94	not just for them
836.94	but for us and our future.
840.3	Escalating disgust
840.3	and intractable conflict
842.82	are not what we want for ourselves,
844.98	or our country
846.26	or our next generation.
849.34	My mom said something to me
849.34	a few weeks before I left Westboro,
853.66	when I was desperately hoping
855.1	there was a way
855.1	I could stay with my family.
858.74	People I have loved
858.74	with every pulse of my heart
861.14	since even before I was
861.14	that chubby-cheeked five-year-old,
864.5	standing on a picket line
864.5	holding a sign I couldn't read.
867.98	"She said, ""You're just a human being,"
870.66	"my dear, sweet child."""
873.58	She was asking me to be humble --
875.86	not to question
875.86	but to trust God and my elders.
879.78	But to me, she was missing
879.78	the bigger picture --
883.34	that we're all just human beings.
885.94	That we should be guided
885.94	by that most basic fact,
888.9	and approach one another
888.9	with generosity and compassion.
892.14	Each one of us
892.14	contributes to the communities
894.46	and the cultures and the societies
894.46	that we make up.
897.82	The end of this spiral of rage and blame
897.82	begins with one person
902.5	who refuses to indulge
902.5	these destructive, seductive impulses.
907.74	We just have to decide
907.74	that it's going to start with us.
910.78	Thank you.
912.02	(Applause)
