12.936	Chris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.
15.16	Jonathan Haidt: Yeah.
16.349	CA: It feels like the world is in a place
18.363	that we haven't seen for a long time.
20.224	People don't just disagree
20.224	in the way that we're familiar with,
24.809	on the left-right political divide.
26.733	There are much deeper differences afoot.
29.758	What on earth is going on,
29.758	and how did we get here?
33.048	JH: This is different.
36.075	There's a much more
36.075	apocalyptic sort of feeling.
39.326	Survey research by Pew Research shows
41.676	that the degree to which we feel
41.676	that the other side is not just --
45.409	we don't just dislike them;
45.409	we strongly dislike them,
48.407	and we think that they are
48.407	a threat to the nation.
51.907	Those numbers have been going up and up,
53.895	and those are over 50 percent
53.895	now on both sides.
56.656	People are scared,
57.831	because it feels like this is different
57.831	than before; it's much more intense.
61.482	Whenever I look
61.482	at any sort of social puzzle,
64.026	I always apply the three basic
64.026	principles of moral psychology,
67.167	and I think they'll help us here.
69.085	So the first thing that you
69.085	have to always keep in mind
71.842	when you're thinking about politics
73.602	is that we're tribal.
75.006	We evolved for tribalism.
76.553	One of the simplest and greatest
76.553	insights into human social nature
79.746	is the Bedouin proverb:
80.943	"""Me against my brother;"
82.359	me and my brother against our cousin;
84.31	me and my brother and cousins
84.31	"against the stranger."""
86.836	And that tribalism allowed us
86.836	to create large societies
91.584	and to come together
91.584	in order to compete with others.
94.64	That brought us out of the jungle
94.64	and out of small groups,
98.345	but it means that we have
98.345	eternal conflict.
100.392	The question you have to look at is:
102.157	What aspects of our society
102.157	are making that more bitter,
104.845	and what are calming them down?
106.399	CA: That's a very dark proverb.
107.984	You're saying that that's actually
107.984	baked into most people's mental wiring
112.181	at some level?
113.356	JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
113.356	a basic aspect of human social cognition.
117.184	But we can also live together
117.184	really peacefully,
119.531	and we've invented all kinds
119.531	of fun ways of, like, playing war.
122.95	I mean, sports, politics --
124.356	these are all ways that we get
124.356	to exercise this tribal nature
128.075	without actually hurting anyone.
129.682	We're also really good at trade
129.682	and exploration and meeting new people.
134.051	So you have to see our tribalism
134.051	as something that goes up or down --
137.374	it's not like we're doomed
137.374	to always be fighting each other,
140.25	but we'll never have world peace.
142.98	CA: The size of that tribe
142.98	can shrink or expand.
146.226	JH: Right.
147.401	"CA: The size of what we consider ""us"""
149.412	"and what we consider ""other"" or ""them"""
151.857	can change.
154.61	And some people believed that process
154.61	could continue indefinitely.
160.224	JH: That's right.
161.44	CA: And we were indeed expanding
161.44	the sense of tribe for a while.
164.67	JH: So this is, I think,
165.855	where we're getting at what's possibly
165.855	the new left-right distinction.
169.234	I mean, the left-right
169.234	as we've all inherited it,
171.581	comes out of the labor
171.581	versus capital distinction,
174.444	and the working class, and Marx.
176.843	But I think what we're seeing
176.843	now, increasingly,
179.116	is a divide in all the Western democracies
181.994	between the people
181.994	who want to stop at nation,
185.725	the people who are more parochial --
187.499	and I don't mean that in a bad way --
189.32	people who have much more
189.32	of a sense of being rooted,
192.144	they care about their town,
192.144	their community and their nation.
195.824	And then those who are
195.824	anti-parochial and who --
199.885	whenever I get confused, I just think
199.885	"of the John Lennon song ""Imagine."""
203.309	"""Imagine there's no countries,"
203.309	"nothing to kill or die for."""
206.162	And so these are the people
206.162	who want more global governance,
209.399	they don't like nation states,
209.399	they don't like borders.
212.097	You see this all over Europe as well.
213.946	There's a great metaphor guy --
213.946	actually, his name is Shakespeare --
217.196	writing ten years ago in Britain.
218.801	He had a metaphor:
219.992	"""Are we drawbridge-uppers"
219.992	"or drawbridge-downers?"""
223.289	And Britain is divided
226.218	And America is divided on that point, too.
229.379	CA: And so, those of us
229.379	who grew up with The Beatles
232.98	and that sort of hippie philosophy
232.98	of dreaming of a more connected world --
236.578	"it felt so idealistic and ""how could"
236.578	"anyone think badly about that?"""
240.736	And what you're saying is that, actually,
242.771	millions of people today
242.771	feel that that isn't just silly;
247.097	it's actually dangerous and wrong,
247.097	and they're scared of it.
249.982	JH: I think the big issue, especially
249.982	in Europe but also here,
253.032	is the issue of immigration.
254.423	And I think this is where
254.423	we have to look very carefully
257.516	at the social science
257.516	about diversity and immigration.
261.171	Once something becomes politicized,
262.909	once it becomes something
262.909	that the left loves and the right --
265.957	then even the social scientists
265.957	can't think straight about it.
269.082	Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.
271.063	It clearly creates more innovation.
273.294	The American economy
273.294	has grown enormously from it.
275.795	Diversity and immigration
275.795	do a lot of good things.
278.201	But what the globalists,
278.201	I think, don't see,
280.853	what they don't want to see,
282.384	is that ethnic diversity
282.384	cuts social capital and trust.
288.686	There's a very important
288.686	study by Robert Putnam,
291.046	"the author of ""Bowling Alone,"""
292.926	looking at social capital databases.
294.805	And basically, the more people
294.805	feel that they are the same,
297.776	the more they trust each other,
299.307	the more they can have
299.307	a redistributionist welfare state.
302.071	Scandinavian countries are so wonderful
304.066	because they have this legacy
304.066	of being small, homogenous countries.
307.439	And that leads to
307.439	a progressive welfare state,
311.18	a set of progressive
311.18	left-leaning values, which says,
314.007	"""Drawbridge down!"
314.007	The world is a great place.
317.032	People in Syria are suffering --
317.032	"we must welcome them in."""
320.088	And it's a beautiful thing.
321.934	But if, and I was in Sweden
321.934	this summer,
324.541	if the discourse in Sweden
324.541	is fairly politically correct
327.748	and they can't talk about the downsides,
330.009	you end up bringing a lot of people in.
332.02	That's going to cut social capital,
333.736	it makes it hard to have a welfare state
335.705	and they might end up,
335.705	as we have in America,
338.285	with a racially divided, visibly
338.285	racially divided, society.
341.922	So this is all very
341.922	uncomfortable to talk about.
344.206	But I think this is the thing,
344.206	especially in Europe and for us, too,
347.475	we need to be looking at.
348.692	CA: You're saying that people of reason,
350.802	people who would consider
350.802	themselves not racists,
353.314	but moral, upstanding people,
355.065	have a rationale that says
355.065	humans are just too different;
358.035	that we're in danger of overloading
358.035	our sense of what humans are capable of,
363.498	by mixing in people who are too different.
366.012	JH: Yes, but I can make it
366.012	much more palatable
369.576	by saying it's not necessarily about race.
372.819	It's about culture.
374.11	There's wonderful work by a political
374.11	scientist named Karen Stenner,
378.307	who shows that when people have a sense
381.558	that we are all united,
381.558	we're all the same,
383.817	there are many people who have
383.817	a predisposition to authoritarianism.
387.091	Those people aren't particularly racist
389.157	when they feel as through
389.157	there's not a threat
391.348	to our social and moral order.
393.071	But if you prime them experimentally
395.128	by thinking we're coming apart,
395.128	people are getting more different,
398.284	then they get more racist, homophobic,
398.284	they want to kick out the deviants.
401.831	So it's in part that you get
401.831	an authoritarian reaction.
404.762	The left, following through
404.762	the Lennonist line --
407.123	the John Lennon line --
408.433	does things that create
408.433	an authoritarian reaction.
410.866	We're certainly seeing that
410.866	in America with the alt-right.
413.685	We saw it in Britain,
413.685	we've seen it all over Europe.
416.291	But the more positive part of that
418.897	is that I think the localists,
418.897	or the nationalists, are actually right --
423.218	that, if you emphasize
423.218	our cultural similarity,
427.029	then race doesn't actually
427.029	matter very much.
429.28	So an assimilationist
429.28	approach to immigration
432.012	removes a lot of these problems.
433.593	And if you value having
433.593	a generous welfare state,
436.004	you've got to emphasize
436.004	that we're all the same.
438.84	CA: OK, so rising immigration
438.84	and fears about that
441.958	are one of the causes
441.958	of the current divide.
445.149	What are other causes?
446.886	JH: The next principle of moral psychology
448.931	is that intuitions come first,
448.931	strategic reasoning second.
452.758	You've probably heard
452.758	"the term ""motivated reasoning"""
455.262	"or ""confirmation bias."""
456.893	There's some really interesting work
458.834	on how our high intelligence
458.834	and our verbal abilities
461.935	might have evolved
461.935	not to help us find out the truth,
465.161	but to help us manipulate each other,
465.161	defend our reputation ...
468.157	We're really, really good
468.157	at justifying ourselves.
471.147	And when you bring
471.147	group interests into account,
473.538	so it's not just me,
473.538	it's my team versus your team,
476.299	whereas if you're evaluating evidence
476.299	that your side is wrong,
479.236	we just can't accept that.
481.017	So this is why you can't win
481.017	a political argument.
483.758	If you're debating something,
485.275	you can't persuade the person
485.275	with reasons and evidence,
488.346	because that's not
488.346	the way reasoning works.
490.715	So now, give us the internet,
490.715	give us Google:
494.522	"""I heard that Barack Obama"
494.522	was born in Kenya.
497.276	Let me Google that -- oh my God!
501.248	CA: So this has come as an unpleasant
501.248	surprise to a lot of people.
504.412	Social media has often been framed
504.412	by techno-optimists
507.284	as this great connecting force
507.284	that would bring people together.
512.555	And there have been some
512.555	unexpected counter-effects to that.
516.922	JH: That's right.
518.097	That's why I'm very enamored
518.097	of yin-yang views
520.502	of human nature and left-right --
522.144	that each side is right
522.144	about certain things,
524.634	but then it goes blind to other things.
526.779	And so the left generally believes
526.779	that human nature is good:
529.781	bring people together, knock down
529.781	the walls and all will be well.
532.97	The right -- social conservatives,
532.97	not libertarians --
535.552	social conservatives generally
535.552	believe people can be greedy
539.829	and sexual and selfish,
541.235	and we need regulation,
541.235	and we need restrictions.
544.214	So, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,
546.64	allow people to communicate
546.64	all over the world,
548.893	you get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.
550.975	CA: So help us understand.
552.26	These principles of human nature
552.26	have been with us forever.
558.918	What's changed that's deepened
558.918	this feeling of division?
564.36	JH: You have to see six to ten
564.36	different threads all coming together.
569.373	I'll just list a couple of them.
571.398	So in America, one of the big --
571.398	actually, America and Europe --
575.9	one of the biggest ones is World War II.
577.837	There's interesting research
577.837	from Joe Henrich and others
580.504	that says if your country was at war,
582.931	especially when you were young,
584.512	then we test you 30 years later
584.512	in a commons dilemma
587.65	or a prisoner's dilemma,
589.003	you're more cooperative.
590.983	Because of our tribal nature, if you're --
593.88	my parents were teenagers
593.88	during World War II,
596.821	and they would go out
596.821	looking for scraps of aluminum
599.406	to help the war effort.
600.619	I mean, everybody pulled together.
602.821	And so then these people go on,
604.374	they rise up through business
604.374	and government,
606.796	they take leadership positions.
608.451	They're really good
608.451	at compromise and cooperation.
611.726	They all retire by the '90s.
613.685	So we're left with baby boomers
613.685	by the end of the '90s.
617.01	And their youth was spent fighting
617.01	each other within each country,
621.001	in 1968 and afterwards.
622.672	The loss of the World War II generation,
622.672	"""The Greatest Generation,"""
626.69	is huge.
628.567	So that's one.
630.44	Another, in America,
630.44	is the purification of the two parties.
633.949	There used to be liberal Republicans
633.949	and conservative Democrats.
637.02	So America had a mid-20th century
637.02	that was really bipartisan.
640.211	But because of a variety of factors
640.211	that started things moving,
644.602	by the 90's, we had a purified
644.602	liberal party and conservative party.
648.024	So now, the people in either party
648.024	really are different,
650.693	and we really don't want
650.693	our children to marry them,
653.2	which, in the '60s,
653.2	didn't matter very much.
655.292	So, the purification of the parties.
657.113	Third is the internet and, as I said,
659.609	it's just the most amazing stimulant
659.609	for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.
664.316	CA: The tone of what's happening
664.316	on the internet now is quite troubling.
669.132	I just did a quick search
669.132	on Twitter about the election
672.003	and saw two tweets next to each other.
675.335	One, against a picture of racist graffiti:
680.007	"""This is disgusting!"
681.664	Ugliness in this country,
681.664	"brought to us by #Trump."""
685.424	And then the next one is:
687.339	"""Crooked Hillary"
687.339	"dedication page. Disgusting!"""
691.176	"So this idea of ""disgust"""
691.176	is troubling to me.
695.407	Because you can have an argument
695.407	or a disagreement about something,
698.666	you can get angry at someone.
701.094	Disgust, I've heard you say,
701.094	takes things to a much deeper level.
704.711	JH: That's right. Disgust is different.
706.622	Anger -- you know, I have kids.
708.609	They fight 10 times a day,
710.383	and they love each other 30 times a day.
712.374	You just go back and forth:
712.374	you get angry, you're not angry;
715.308	you're angry, you're not angry.
716.855	But disgust is different.
718.189	Disgust paints the person
718.189	as subhuman, monstrous,
722.686	deformed, morally deformed.
724.519	Disgust is like indelible ink.
727.768	There's research from John Gottman
727.768	on marital therapy.
731.307	If you look at the faces -- if one
731.307	of the couple shows disgust or contempt,
736.456	that's a predictor that they're going
736.456	to get divorced soon,
739.576	whereas if they show anger,
739.576	that doesn't predict anything,
742.499	because if you deal with anger well,
742.499	it actually is good.
745.232	So this election is different.
746.708	Donald Trump personally
746.708	"uses the word ""disgust"" a lot."
750.386	He's very germ-sensitive,
750.386	so disgust does matter a lot --
753.267	more for him, that's something
753.267	unique to him --
757.201	but as we demonize each other more,
760.128	and again, through
760.128	the Manichaean worldview,
763.561	the idea that the world
763.561	is a battle between good and evil
766.315	as this has been ramping up,
767.686	we're more likely not just to say
767.686	they're wrong or I don't like them,
771.036	but we say they're evil, they're satanic,
773.596	they're disgusting, they're revolting.
775.541	And then we want nothing to do with them.
778.806	And that's why I think we're seeing it,
778.806	for example, on campus now.
782.317	We're seeing more the urge
782.317	to keep people off campus,
784.981	silence them, keep them away.
786.95	I'm afraid that this whole
786.95	generation of young people,
789.569	if their introduction to politics
789.569	involves a lot of disgust,
793.386	they're not going to want to be involved
793.386	in politics as they get older.
797.506	CA: So how do we deal with that?
799.37	Disgust. How do you defuse disgust?
804.874	JH: You can't do it with reasons.
807.312	I think ...
810.257	I studied disgust for many years,
810.257	and I think about emotions a lot.
813.498	And I think that the opposite
813.498	of disgust is actually love.
817.764	Love is all about, like ...
821.239	Disgust is closing off, borders.
823.834	Love is about dissolving walls.
827.074	So personal relationships, I think,
829.578	are probably the most
829.578	powerful means we have.
833.291	You can be disgusted by a group of people,
836.012	but then you meet a particular person
837.954	and you genuinely discover
837.954	that they're lovely.
840.754	And then gradually that chips away
840.754	or changes your category as well.
846.016	The tragedy is, Americans used to be
846.016	much more mixed up in the their towns
852.017	by left-right or politics.
854.175	And now that it's become
854.175	this great moral divide,
856.53	there's a lot of evidence
856.53	that we're moving to be near people
859.697	who are like us politically.
861.233	It's harder to find somebody
861.233	who's on the other side.
863.787	So they're over there, they're far away.
866.101	It's harder to get to know them.
867.695	CA: What would you say to someone
867.695	or say to Americans,
871.943	people generally,
873.125	about what we should understand
873.125	about each other
875.758	that might help us rethink for a minute
879.257	"this ""disgust"" instinct?"
882.086	JH: Yes.
883.262	A really important
883.262	thing to keep in mind --
885.439	there's research by political
885.439	scientist Alan Abramowitz,
890.179	showing that American democracy
890.179	is increasingly governed
894.196	"by what's called ""negative partisanship."""
896.875	That means you think,
896.875	OK there's a candidate,
900.01	you like the candidate,
900.01	you vote for the candidate.
902.44	But with the rise of negative advertising
904.523	and social media
904.523	and all sorts of other trends,
906.771	increasingly, the way elections are done
908.836	is that each side tries to make
908.836	the other side so horrible, so awful,
912.841	that you'll vote for my guy by default.
915.319	And so as we more and more vote
915.319	against the other side
918.313	and not for our side,
919.668	you have to keep in mind
919.668	that if people are on the left,
925.199	"they think, ""Well, I used to think"
925.199	that Republicans were bad,
928.133	but now Donald Trump proves it.
929.64	And now every Republican,
929.64	I can paint with all the things
932.515	"that I think about Trump."""
933.921	And that's not necessarily true.
935.538	They're generally not very happy
935.538	with their candidate.
938.254	This is the most negative partisanship
938.254	election in American history.
943.86	So you have to first separate
943.86	your feelings about the candidate
947.247	from your feelings about the people
947.247	who are given a choice.
950.208	And then you have to realize that,
953.246	because we all live
953.246	in a separate moral world --
955.69	the metaphor I use in the book
955.69	"is that we're all trapped in ""The Matrix,"""
959.165	or each moral community is a matrix,
959.165	a consensual hallucination.
962.713	And so if you're within the blue matrix,
964.98	everything's completely compelling
964.98	that the other side --
968.198	they're troglodytes, they're racists,
968.198	they're the worst people in the world,
971.853	and you have all the facts
971.853	to back that up.
973.981	But somebody in the next house from yours
976.28	is living in a different moral matrix.
978.337	They live in a different video game,
980.308	and they see a completely
980.308	different set of facts.
982.71	And each one sees
982.71	different threats to the country.
985.41	And what I've found
985.41	from being in the middle
987.524	and trying to understand both sides
987.524	is: both sides are right.
990.475	There are a lot of threats
990.475	to this country,
992.619	and each side is constitutionally
992.619	incapable of seeing them all.
996.963	CA: So, are you saying
996.963	that we almost need a new type of empathy?
1003.506	Empathy is traditionally framed as:
1005.7	"""Oh, I feel your pain."
1005.7	"I can put myself in your shoes."""
1008.415	And we apply it to the poor,
1008.415	the needy, the suffering.
1012.023	We don't usually apply it
1012.023	to people who we feel as other,
1015.87	or we're disgusted by.
1017.359	JH: No. That's right.
1018.534	CA: What would it look like
1018.534	to build that type of empathy?
1024.268	JH: Actually, I think ...
1026.145	Empathy is a very, very
1026.145	hot topic in psychology,
1028.474	and it's a very popular word
1028.474	on the left in particular.
1031.156	Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
1031.156	for the preferred classes of victims.
1035.18	So it's important to empathize
1036.657	with the groups that we on the left
1036.657	think are so important.
1039.505	That's easy to do,
1039.505	because you get points for that.
1042.442	But empathy really should get you points
1042.442	if you do it when it's hard to do.
1046.513	And, I think ...
1048.291	You know, we had a long 50-year period
1048.291	of dealing with our race problems
1053.403	and legal discrimination,
1055.682	and that was our top priority
1055.682	for a long time
1057.893	and it still is important.
1059.167	But I think this year,
1060.72	I'm hoping it will make people see
1063.148	that we have an existential
1063.148	threat on our hands.
1065.967	Our left-right divide, I believe,
1068.658	is by far the most important
1068.658	divide we face.
1070.842	We still have issues about race
1070.842	and gender and LGBT,
1073.897	but this is the urgent need
1073.897	of the next 50 years,
1077.292	and things aren't going
1077.292	to get better on their own.
1081.021	So we're going to need to do
1081.021	a lot of institutional reforms,
1083.88	and we could talk about that,
1085.313	but that's like a whole long,
1085.313	wonky conversation.
1087.667	But I think it starts with people
1087.667	realizing that this is a turning point.
1091.537	And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.
1094.37	We need to realize:
1095.899	this is what our country needs,
1097.465	and this is what you need
1097.465	if you don't want to --
1099.843	Raise your hand if you want
1099.843	to spend the next four years
1102.562	as angry and worried as you've been
1102.562	for the last year -- raise your hand.
1106.072	So if you want to escape from this,
1107.801	read Buddha, read Jesus,
1107.801	read Marcus Aurelius.
1109.976	They have all kinds of great advice
1109.976	for how to drop the fear,
1115.062	reframe things,
1116.264	stop seeing other people as your enemy.
1118.371	There's a lot of guidance in ancient
1118.371	wisdom for this kind of empathy.
1121.702	CA: Here's my last question:
1123.103	Personally, what can
1123.103	people do to help heal?
1127.462	JH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide
1127.462	to overcome your deepest prejudices.
1131.569	And there's research showing
1133.054	that political prejudices are deeper
1133.054	and stronger than race prejudices
1137.427	in the country now.
1139.395	So I think you have to make an effort --
1139.395	that's the main thing.
1142.851	Make an effort to actually meet somebody.
1144.879	Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,
1147.113	somebody who's on the other side.
1149.006	So, after this election --
1151.252	wait a week or two,
1152.627	because it's probably going to feel
1152.627	awful for one of you --
1155.487	but wait a couple weeks, and then
1155.487	reach out and say you want to talk.
1159.663	And before you do it,
1161.111	"read Dale Carnegie, ""How to Win"
1161.111	"Friends and Influence People"" --"
1164.28	(Laughter)
1165.343	I'm totally serious.
1166.534	You'll learn techniques
1166.534	if you start by acknowledging,
1169.148	if you start by saying,
1170.333	"""You know, we don't agree on a lot,"
1172.027	but one thing I really respect
1172.027	"about you, Uncle Bob,"""
1174.589	"or ""... about you conservatives, is ... """
1176.672	And you can find something.
1178.03	If you start with some
1178.03	appreciation, it's like magic.
1180.817	This is one of the main
1180.817	things I've learned
1182.955	that I take into my human relationships.
1184.892	I still make lots of stupid mistakes,
1186.836	but I'm incredibly good
1186.836	at apologizing now,
1188.876	and at acknowledging what
1188.876	somebody was right about.
1191.317	And if you do that,
1192.495	then the conversation goes really well,
1192.495	and it's actually really fun.
1196.717	CA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating
1196.717	speaking with you.
1199.386	It really does feel like
1199.386	the ground that we're on
1203.168	is a ground populated by deep questions
1203.168	of morality and human nature.
1208.366	Your wisdom couldn't be more relevant.
1210.814	Thank you so much for sharing
1210.814	this time with us.
1213.133	JH: Thanks, Chris.
1214.309	JH: Thanks, everyone.
1215.494	(Applause)
