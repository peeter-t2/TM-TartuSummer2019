27.023	It's wonderful to be back.
29.666	I love this wonderful gathering.
32.392	"And you must be wondering, ""What on earth?"
34.613	"Have they put up the wrong slide?"""
36.289	No, no.
38.426	Look at this magnificent beast,
42.662	and ask the question: Who designed it?
48.152	This is TED; this is
48.152	Technology, Entertainment, Design,
52.086	and there's a dairy cow.
53.849	It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
58.104	And I was thinking,
58.104	how do I introduce this?
60.326	And I thought, well, maybe
60.326	that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,
65	"you know: ""Poems are made by fools"
65	"like me, but only God can make a tree."""
70.004	And you might say,
70.004	"""Well, God designed the cow."""
72.692	But, of course, God got a lot of help.
76.525	This is the ancestor of cattle.
78.858	This is the aurochs.
81.739	And it was designed by natural selection,
83.784	the process of natural selection,
83.784	over many millions of years.
87.719	And then it became domesticated,
87.719	thousands of years ago.
92.274	And human beings became its stewards,
96.947	and, without even knowing
96.947	what they were doing,
99.201	they gradually redesigned it
99.201	and redesigned it and redesigned it.
103.521	And then more recently, they really began
103.521	to do reverse engineering on this beast
109.783	and figure out just what
109.783	the parts were, how they worked
112.578	and how they might be optimized --
112.578	how they might be made better.
117.22	Now, why am I talking about cows?
121.181	Because I want to say that
121.181	much the same thing is true of religions.
126.489	Religions are natural phenomena --
126.489	they're just as natural as cows.
131.862	They have evolved over millennia.
136.438	They have a biological base,
136.438	just like the aurochs.
140.798	They have become domesticated,
142.89	and human beings have been redesigning
142.89	their religions for thousands of years.
149.138	This is TED, and I want
149.138	to talk about design.
153	Because what I've been doing
153	for the last four years --
155.937	really since the first time you saw me --
157.981	some of you saw me at TED
157.981	when I was talking about religion --
161.008	and in the last four years,
162.525	I've been working
162.525	just about non-stop on this topic.
165.961	And you might say it's about
165.961	the reverse engineering of religions.
171.59	Now that very idea, I think,
171.59	strikes terror in many people,
177.177	or anger, or anxiety
177.177	of one sort or another.
182.743	And that is the spell
182.743	that I want to break.
185.194	I want to say, no, religions
185.194	are an important natural phenomenon.
188.933	We should study them
188.933	with the same intensity
192.205	that we study all the other
192.205	important natural phenomena,
195.396	like global warming, as we heard
195.396	so eloquently last night from Al Gore.
200.128	Today's religions are brilliantly
200.128	designed -- brilliantly designed.
204.62	They are immensely powerful
204.62	social institutions
208.977	and many of their features
208.977	can be traced back to earlier features
214.281	that we can really make sense of
214.281	by reverse engineering.
219.333	And, as with the cow, there's a mixture
219.333	of evolutionary design --
224.729	designed by natural selection itself --
226.722	and intelligent design --
229.853	more or less intelligent design --
231.691	and redesigned by human beings
233.413	who are trying
233.413	to redesign their religions.
237.564	You don't do book talks at TED,
241.168	but I'm going to have
241.168	just one slide about my book,
245.316	because there is one message in it
248.013	which I think this group
248.013	really needs to hear.
250.201	And I would be very interested
250.201	to get your responses to this.
255.05	It's the one policy proposal
255.05	that I make in the book,
259.719	at this time, when I claim
259.719	not to know enough about religion
263.106	to know what other
263.106	policy proposals to make.
265.749	And it's one that echoes remarks
265.749	that you've heard already today.
270.321	Here's my proposal,
271.504	I'm going to just take a couple
271.504	of minutes to explain it:
274.458	Education on world religions
274.458	for all of our children --
280.026	in primary school, in high school,
282.193	in public schools, in private schools
282.193	and in home schooling.
286.521	So what I'm proposing is,
288.203	just as we require reading, writing,
288.203	arithmetic, American history,
294.087	so we should have a curriculum on facts
294.087	about all the religions of the world --
301.111	about their history,
301.111	about their creeds, about their texts,
306	their music, their symbolisms,
306	their prohibitions, their requirements.
311.994	And this should be presented
311.994	factually, straightforwardly,
316.837	with no particular spin,
316.837	to all of the children in the country.
323.507	And as long as you teach them that,
326.824	you can teach them anything else you like.
329.713	That, I think, is maximal tolerance
329.713	for religious freedom.
334.363	As long as you inform your children
334.363	about other religions,
339	then you may -- and as early as you like
339	and whatever you like --
342.17	teach them whatever creed
342.17	you want them to learn.
345.956	But also let them know
345.956	about other religions.
348.616	Now, why do I say that?
352.365	Because democracy depends
352.365	on an informed citizenship.
359.25	Informed consent is the very bedrock
359.25	of our understanding of democracy.
366.93	Misinformed consent is not worth it.
370	It's like a coin flip;
370	it doesn't count, really.
373.247	Democracy depends on informed consent.
376	This is the way we treat people
376	as responsible adults.
381.812	Now, children below the age of consent
381.812	are a special case.
390.608	Parents -- I'm going to use a word
390.608	that Pastor Rick just used --
396.223	parents are stewards of their children.
399.159	They don't own them.
401.286	You can't own your children.
403.212	You have a responsibility to the world,
406.919	to the state, to them,
406.919	to take care of them right.
412.843	You may teach them whatever creed
412.843	you think is most important,
418.914	but I say you have a responsibility
418.914	to let them be informed
423.764	about all the other creeds
423.764	in the world, too.
427	The reason I've taken this time
427	is I've been fascinated to hear
431.492	some of the reactions to this.
434.663	One reviewer for a Roman Catholic
434.663	"newspaper called it ""totalitarian."""
441.849	It strikes me as practically libertarian.
446.071	Is it totalitarian to require
446.071	reading, writing and arithmetic?
449.118	I don't think so.
450.301	All I'm saying is --
452.304	and facts, facts only;
452.304	no values, just facts --
458.252	about all the world's religions.
461.683	"Another reviewer called it ""hilarious."""
464.9	Well, I'm really bothered by the fact
468.581	that anybody would think
468.581	that was hilarious.
471.224	It seems to me to be such a plausible,
475.229	natural extension of the democratic
475.229	principles we already have
479.649	that I'm shocked to think anybody
479.649	would find that just ridiculous.
485.002	I know many religions
488.543	are so anxious about preserving the purity
488.543	of their faith among their children
495.204	that they are intent on keeping
495.204	their children ignorant of other faiths.
502.145	I don't think that's defensible.
505.184	But I'd really be pleased
505.184	to get your answers on that --
507.842	any reactions to that -- later.
509.393	But now I'm going to move on.
511.54	Back to the cow.
513	This picture, which I pulled
513	off the web --
516.388	the fellow on the left is really
516.388	an important part of this picture.
519.717	That's the steward.
521.305	Cows couldn't live without human
521.305	stewards -- they're domesticated.
526.838	They're a sort of ectosymbiont.
530.132	They depend on us for their survival.
535.38	And Pastor Rick
535.38	was just talking about sheep.
538.747	I'm going to talk about sheep, too.
540.47	There's a lot of serendipitous
540.47	convergence here.
544.007	How clever it was of sheep
544.007	to acquire shepherds!
547.94	(Laughter)
550.297	Think of what this got them.
552.438	They could outsource all their problems:
555	protection from predators,
555	food-finding ...
557.635	(Laughter)
558.666	... health maintenance.
560.025	(Laughter)
562.712	The only cost in most flocks --
562.712	not even this -- a loss of free mating.
569.665	What a deal!
571.673	"""How clever of sheep!"" you might say."
573.573	Except, of course,
573.573	it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.
576.098	We all know sheep are not exactly rocket
576.098	scientists -- they're not very smart.
581.427	It wasn't the cleverness
581.427	of the sheep at all.
583.574	They were clueless.
586.201	But it was a very clever move.
588.159	Whose clever move was it?
589.506	It was the clever move
589.506	of natural selection itself.
593.818	Francis Crick, the co-discoverer
593.818	of the structure of DNA
599.625	with Jim Watson,
601.412	once joked about what he called
601.412	Orgel's Second Rule.
604.578	Leslie Orgel is a molecular
604.578	biologist, brilliant guy,
609.853	and Orgel's Second Rule is:
611.247	Evolution is cleverer than you are.
614.96	Now, that is not Intelligent Design --
614.96	not from Francis Crick.
621.479	Evolution is cleverer than you are.
623.194	If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,
623.194	then you understand
626.352	why the Intelligent Design movement
626.352	is basically a hoax.
633.216	The designs discovered
633.216	by the process of natural selection
637.654	are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.
640.058	Again and again biologists are fascinated
640.058	with the brilliance of what's discovered.
645.283	But the process itself is without purpose,
648.472	without foresight, without design.
651.358	When I was here four years ago,
652.913	I told the story about an ant
652.913	climbing a blade of grass.
655.858	And why the ant was doing it
655.858	was because its brain had been infected
659.748	with a lancet fluke that was needed
659.748	to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow
664.944	in order to reproduce.
667.342	So it was sort of a spooky story.
669	And I think some people
669	may have misunderstood.
671.77	Lancet flukes aren't smart.
673.874	I submit that the intelligence
673.874	of a lancet fluke is down there,
678.132	somewhere between petunia and carrot.
680.336	They're not really bright.
680.336	They don't have to be.
682.662	The lesson we learn from this is:
684.273	you don't have to have a mind
684.273	to be a beneficiary.
687.797	The design is there in nature,
687.797	but it's not in anybody's head.
692.75	It doesn't have to be.
694	That's the way evolution works.
696.635	Question: Was domestication
696.635	good for sheep?
699.223	It was great for their genetic fitness.
701.294	And here I want to remind you
701.294	of a wonderful point
704	that Paul MacCready made
704	at TED three years ago.
707.997	Here's what he said:
710.012	"""Ten thousand years ago,"
710.012	at the dawn of agriculture,
712.667	human population, plus livestock and pets,
715.103	was approximately a tenth of one percent
715.103	"of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."""
720.519	That was just 10,000 years ago.
723.234	Yesterday, in biological terms.
725.708	What is it today? Does anybody
725.708	remember what he told us?
731.639	That is what we have done on this planet.
734.456	Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --
734.456	I wanted to check to find out
737.549	how he'd calculated this, and get
737.549	the sources and so forth --
740.446	and he also gave me a paper
740.446	that he had written on this.
743.169	And there was a passage in it
743.169	which he did not present here
746.015	and I think it is so good,
746.015	I'm going to read it to you:
748.634	"""Over billions of years"
748.634	on a unique sphere,
751.798	chance has painted
751.798	a thin covering of life:
754.663	complex, improbable,
754.663	wonderful and fragile.
758.05	Suddenly, we humans --
758.05	a recently arrived species
761	no longer subject to the checks
761	and balances inherent in nature --
764.472	have grown in population,
764.472	technology and intelligence
767.314	to a position of terrible power.
769.281	"We now wield the paintbrush."""
772.358	We heard about the atmosphere
772.358	as a thin layer of varnish.
775.771	Life itself is just a thin coat
775.771	of paint on this planet.
779.83	And we're the ones
779.83	that hold the paintbrush.
782.576	And how can we do that?
784.179	The key to our domination
784.179	of the planet is culture.
788.557	And the key to culture is religion.
791.99	Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.
794.958	They would be puzzled by many things.
798.683	Anybody know what this is?
798.683	I'll tell you what it is.
802.562	This is a million people gathering
802.562	on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,
807.879	perhaps the largest single gathering
807.879	of human beings ever,
811.365	as seen from satellite photograph.
813.597	Here's a big crowd.
814.773	Here's another crowd in Mecca.
817.153	Martians would be amazed by this.
819.985	They'd want to know how it originated,
821.831	what it was for
821.831	and how it perpetuates itself.
825.061	Actually, I'm going to pass over this.
828.156	The ant isn't alone.
829.435	There's all sorts of wonderful cases
829.435	of species which -- in that case --
836.617	A parasite gets into a mouse
836.617	and needs to get into the belly of a cat.
840.347	And it turns the mouse
840.347	into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,
843.232	so it runs out in the open,
843.232	where it'll be eaten by a cat.
846.039	True story.
847.73	In other words, we have these hijackers --
849.766	you've seen this slide before,
849.766	from four years ago --
852.274	a parasite that infects the brain
852.274	and induces even suicidal behavior,
856.184	on behalf of a cause
856.184	other than one's own genetic fitness.
860.314	Does that ever happen to us?
862.562	Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.
867.102	"The Arabic word ""Islam"""
867.102	"means ""submission."""
869.133	"It means ""surrender of self-interest"
869.133	"to the will of Allah."""
872.617	But I'm not just talking about Islam.
874.424	I'm talking also about Christianity.
876.597	This is a parchment music page
876.597	that I found in a Paris bookstall
881.251	And on it, it says, in Latin:
884.528	"""Semen est verbum Dei."
884.528	"Sator autem Christus."""
887.512	The word of God is the seed
887.512	and the sower of the seed is Christ.
891.418	Same idea. Well, not quite.
893.621	But in fact, Christians, too ...
898.297	glory in the fact
898.297	that they have surrendered to God.
901.956	I'll give you a few quotes.
903.328	"""The heart of worship is surrender."
906.173	Surrendered people obey God's words,
906.173	"even if it doesn't make sense."""
911.182	Those words are by Rick Warren.
913.802	"Those are from ""The Purpose Driven Life."""
916.898	And I want to turn now, briefly,
916.898	to talk about that book, which I've read.
920.548	You've all got a copy,
921.915	and you've just heard the man.
924.131	And what I want to do now
924.131	is say a bit about this book
927.862	from the design standpoint,
929.321	because I think it's actually
929.321	a brilliant book.
933.369	First of all, the goal -- and you
933.369	heard just now what the goal is --
936.608	it's to bring purpose to the lives
936.608	of millions, and he has succeeded.
939.943	Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure
939.943	we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.
943.739	He's absolutely right.
944.914	There are lots of people out there
944.914	who don't have purpose in their life,
948.746	and bringing purpose to their life
948.746	is a wonderful goal.
951.58	I give him an A+ on this.
953.196	(Laughter)
955.044	Is the goal achieved?
958.822	Yes.
961.266	Thirty million copies of this book.
965.519	Al Gore, eat your heart out.
967	(Laughter)
970.681	Just exactly what Al is trying
970.681	to do, Rick is doing.
974.326	This is a fantastic achievement.
978.028	And the means -- how does he do it?
982	It's a brilliant redesign
982	of traditional religious themes --
985	updating them, quietly dropping
985	obsolete features,
988.325	putting new interpretations
988.325	on other features.
990.507	This is the evolution of religion that's
990.507	been going on for thousands of years,
994.222	and he's just the latest
994.222	brilliant practitioner of it.
998.833	I don't have to tell you this;
998.833	you just heard the man.
1001.413	Excellent insights into human psychology,
1001.413	wise advice on every page.
1007.079	Moreover, he invites us
1007.079	to look under the hood.
1010.431	I really appreciated that.
1011.804	For instance, he has an appendix
1011.804	where he explains
1014.272	his choice of translations
1014.272	of different Bible verses.
1017.999	The book is clear, vivid, accessible,
1017.999	beautifully formatted.
1024.323	Just enough repetition.
1026.528	That's really important.
1028.568	Every time you read it or say it,
1028.568	you make another copy in your brain.
1033.871	Every time you read it or say it,
1033.871	you make another copy in your brain.
1037.64	(Laughter)
1038.672	With me, everybody --
1039.94	(Audience and Dan Dennett)
1039.94	Every time you read it or say it,
1042.94	you make another copy in your brain.
1045.265	Thank you.
1046.45	And now we come to my problem.
1048.767	Because I'm absolutely sincere
1048.767	in my appreciation
1052	of all that I said about this book.
1054.56	But I wish it were better.
1056.242	I have some problems with the book.
1058.202	And it would just be insincere of me
1058.202	not to address those problems.
1062.346	I wish he could do this with a revision,
1066.133	a Mark 2 version of his book.
1070.6	"""The truth will set you free."""
1072.536	That's what it says in the Bible,
1074.467	and it's something
1074.467	that I want to live by, too.
1077.418	My problem is, some of the bits in it
1077.418	I don't think are true.
1082.748	Now some of this
1082.748	is a difference of opinion.
1087.173	And that's not my main complaint,
1087.173	that's worth mentioning.
1090.062	Here's a passage -- it's very much
1090.062	what he said, anyway:
1093.275	"""If there was no God"
1093.275	we would all be accidents,
1095.798	the result of astronomical
1095.798	random chance in the Universe.
1098.933	You could stop reading this book
1098.933	because life would have no purpose
1102.335	or meaning or significance.
1103.843	There would be no right or wrong
1105.449	and no hope beyond
1105.449	"your brief years on Earth."""
1107.619	Now, I just do not believe that.
1109.552	By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's
1109.552	film presented a beautiful alternative
1115.756	to that very claim.
1117.861	Yes, there is meaning and a reason
1117.861	for right or wrong.
1121.29	We don't need a belief in God
1121.29	to be good or to have meaning in us.
1127.548	But that, as I said,
1127.548	is just a difference of opinion.
1131.833	That's not what I'm really worried about.
1134.65	"How about this: ""God designed"
1134.65	this planet's environment
1137.603	"just so we could live in it."""
1140.213	I'm afraid that a lot of people
1140.213	take that sentiment to mean
1144.679	that we don't have to do
1144.679	the sorts of things
1147.323	that Al Gore is trying so hard
1147.323	to get us to do.
1149.735	I am not happy with that sentiment at all.
1152	"And then I find this: ""All the evidence"
1152	available in the biological sciences
1156.596	supports the core proposition that
1156.596	the cosmos is a specially designed whole
1160.304	with life and mankind
1160.304	as its fundamental goal and purpose,
1163.607	a whole in which all facets
1163.607	of reality have their meaning
1166.315	"and explanation in this central fact."""
1168.356	Well, that's Michael Denton.
1168.356	He's a creationist.
1171.833	"And here, I think, ""Wait a minute."""
1171.833	I read this again.
1175	I read it three or four times and I think,
1177.063	"""Is he really endorsing"
1177.063	Intelligent Design?
1179.631	"Is he endorsing creationism here?"""
1181.642	And you can't tell.
1182.901	So I'm sort of thinking,
1182.901	"""Well, I don't know,"
1185.03	I don't know if I want
1185.03	"to get upset with this yet."""
1187.451	But then I read on, and I read this:
1187.451	"""First, Noah had never seen rain,"
1191.559	because prior to the Flood, God irrigated
1191.559	"the earth from the ground up."""
1196.614	I wish that sentence weren't in there,
1196.614	because I think it is false.
1201.537	And I think that thinking this way
1201.537	about the history of the planet,
1204.728	after we've just been hearing
1204.728	about the history of the planet
1208.475	over millions of years,
1211.631	discourages people
1211.631	from scientific understanding.
1214.842	Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms
1221.411	and scientific factoids and information
1221.411	in a very interesting way.
1225.541	"Here's one: ""God deliberately shaped"
1225.541	and formed you to serve him
1228.929	in a way that makes your ministry unique.
1230.998	He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail
1230.998	"that created you."""
1237.808	I think that's false.
1240	Now, maybe we want to treat it
1240	as metaphorical.
1243.618	"Here's another one: ""For instance,"
1243.618	your brain can store 100 trillion facts.
1247.221	Your mind can handle
1250.964	Well, it would be interesting
1250.964	to find the interpretation
1253.662	where I would accept that.
1255.067	There might be some way
1255.067	of treating that as true.
1258.511	"""Anthropologists have noted"
1258.511	that worship is a universal urge,
1261.843	hardwired by God into
1261.843	the very fiber of our being --
1264.522	"an inbuilt need to connect with God."""
1268.392	Well, the sense of which I agree with him,
1270.584	except I think it has
1270.584	an evolutionary explanation.
1272.988	And what I find
1272.988	deeply troubling in this book
1276.833	is that he seems to be arguing
1276.833	that if you want to be moral,
1280.61	if you want to have meaning in your life,
1282.803	you have to be an Intelligent Designer,
1285.294	you have to deny the theory of evolution
1285.294	by natural selection.
1288.839	And I think, on the contrary,
1290.342	that it is very important
1290.342	to solving the world's problems
1293.307	that we take evolutionary
1293.307	biology seriously.
1297.427	Whose truth are we going to listen to?
1300.649	Well, this is from
1300.649	"""The Purpose Driven Life"":"
1303.225	"""The Bible must become"
1303.225	the authoritative standard for my life:
1306.542	the compass I rely on for direction,
1308.305	the counsel I listen to
1308.305	for making wise decisions,
1311.146	and the benchmark I use
1311.146	"for evaluating everything."""
1314.458	Well maybe, OK, but what's going
1314.458	to follow from this?
1318.869	And here's one that does concern me.
1322.463	Remember I quoted him
1322.463	before with this line:
1324.84	"""Surrendered people obey God's word,"
1324.84	"even if it doesn't make sense."""
1330.335	And that's a problem.
1334.843	(Sighs)
1335.867	"""Don't ever argue with the Devil."
1337.535	He's better at arguing than you are,
1339.29	having had thousands
1339.29	"of years to practice."""
1341.7	Now, Rick Warren
1341.7	didn't invent this clever move.
1345.951	It's an old move.
1347.649	It's a very clever
1347.649	adaptation of religions.
1350.224	It's a wild card for disarming
1350.224	any reasonable criticism.
1355.546	"""You don't like my interpretation?"
1357.292	You've got a reasonable objection to it?
1359.268	Don't listen, don't listen!
1361.321	"That's the Devil speaking."""
1364.185	This discourages the sort
1364.185	of reasoning citizenship
1369.81	it seems to me that we want to have.
1372.668	I've got one more problem,
1372.668	then I'm through.
1375.298	And I'd really like to get
1375.298	a response if Rick is able to do it.
1380.593	"""In the Great Commission, Jesus said,"
1382.396	'Go to all people of all nations
1382.396	and make them my disciples.
1385.282	Baptize them in the name of the Father,
1385.282	the Son and the Holy Spirit,
1388.521	and teach them to do
1388.521	"everything I've told you.'"""
1390.812	The Bible says Jesus is the only one
1390.812	who can save the world.
1394.93	We've seen many wonderful maps
1394.93	of the world in the last day or so.
1399.297	Here's one, not as beautiful
1399.297	as the others;
1401.647	it simply shows
1401.647	the religions of the world.
1405.066	Here's one that shows the sort of current
1405.066	breakdown of the different religions.
1412.099	Do we really want to commit ourselves
1416.633	to engulfing all the other religions,
1421.577	when their holy books are telling them,
1424.967	"""Don't listen to the other side,"
1424.967	"that's just Satan talking!""?"
1429.45	It seems to me that
1429.45	that's a very problematic ship
1435.811	to get on for the future.
1438.75	I found this sign as I was driving
1438.75	to Maine recently,
1443	in front of a church:
1443	"""Good without God becomes zero."""
1445.691	Sort of cute.
1447.205	A very clever little meme.
1451.589	I don't believe it and I think this idea,
1451.589	popular as it is --
1457.217	not in this guise, but in general --
1459.332	is itself one of the main
1459.332	problems that we face.
1462.609	If you are like me, you know
1462.609	many wonderful, committed, engaged
1469.304	atheists, agnostics, who are being
1469.304	very good without God.
1475	And you also know many religious people
1475	who hide behind their sanctity
1480.729	instead of doing good works.
1482.959	So, I wish we could drop this meme.
1486.578	I wish this meme would go extinct.
1488.595	Thanks very much for your attention.
1490.366	(Applause)
