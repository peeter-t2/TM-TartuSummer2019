16.246	I'm a process engineer, I know all about
16.246	boilers and incinerators
20.544	and fabric filters, and cyclones,
20.544	and things like that.
24.226	But I also have Marfan syndrome.
26.282	This is an inherited disorder.
28.181	And in 1992, I participated
28.181	in a genetic study,
32.376	and found to my horror,
32.376	as you can see from the slide,
35.834	that my ascending aorta
35.834	was not in the normal range,
39.635	the green line at the bottom.
41.255	Everyone in here will be between 3.2-3.6,
44.162	and I was already up at 4.4.
46.726	And as you can see,
46.726	my aorta dilated progressively,
50.936	and I got closer and closer to the point
50.936	where surgery was going to be necessary.
55.976	The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome.
59.217	Anesthetize you, open your chest,
61.827	put you on an artificial
61.827	heart and lung machine,
64.7	drop your body temperature
64.7	to about 18 centigrade,
67.893	stop your heart, cut the aorta out,
70.581	replace it with a plastic valve
70.581	and a plastic aorta.
74.333	And most importantly, commit you
74.333	to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy.
79.364	Normally, warfarin.
81.216	The thought of the surgery
81.216	was not attractive.
83.854	The thought of the warfarin
83.854	was really quite frightening.
88.295	So I said to myself,
89.585	"""I'm an engineer, I'm in R&amp;D,"
89.585	"this is just a plumbing problem."""
93.04	"""I can do this, I can change this."""
95.07	So I set out to change the entire
95.07	treatment for aortic dilation.
101.919	The project aim is really quite simple.
105.856	The only real problem
105.856	with the ascending aorta
108.781	in people with Marfan syndrome
110.366	is that it lacks some tensile strength.
113.252	So, the possibility exists
113.252	to simply externally wrap the pipe,
118.875	and it would remain stable
118.875	and operate quite happily.
122.433	If your high-pressure hose pipe
122.433	or hydraulic line bulges a little,
127.128	you just wrap some tape around it,
127.128	it really is that simple.
130.652	In concept, though not in execution.
134.498	The great advantage
134.498	of an external support, for me,
137.612	was that I could retain
137.612	all of my own bits,
140.325	all of my own endothelium and valves,
142.641	and not need any anticoagulation therapy.
147.001	So, where do we start?
148.307	This is a sagittal slice through me.
151.311	In the middle, you can see
151.311	that little structure squeezing out,
155.853	that's the left ventricle,
157.364	pushing blood out
157.364	through the aortic valve.
160.209	You can see two of the leaflets
160.209	of the aortic valve working there.
163.4	Up into the ascending aorta.
165.27	And it's that part, the ascending aorta,
169.248	which dilates and ultimately bursts,
169.248	which of course is fatal.
174.57	We started by organizing image acquisition
177.764	from magnetic resonance
177.764	and CT imaging machines,
182.848	from which to make a model
182.848	of the patient's aorta.
189.281	This is a model of my aorta.
191.504	I've got a real one in my pocket,
193.371	if anyone would like to look at it,
193.371	and play with it.
195.875	(Laughter)
196.908	You can see it's quite
196.908	a complex structure.
198.997	It has a funny tri-lobal shape
198.997	at the bottom,
201.566	which contains the aortic valve.
203.585	It then comes back into a round form,
205.567	and then tapers and curves off.
208.668	It's quite a difficult structure
208.668	to produce.
213.012	This is a sort of CAD model of me,
214.825	and this is one of the later CAD models.
216.765	We went through an iterative process
216.765	of producing better and better models.
221.025	When we produced that model,
223.94	we turned it into a solid,
223.94	plastic model, as you can see,
228.239	using a rapid prototyping technique,
228.239	another engineering technique.
232.72	We then used that former
234.06	to manufacture a perfectly bespoke
234.06	porous textile mesh,
238.731	which takes the shape of the former
238.731	and perfectly fits the aorta.
242.932	So this is absolutely personalized
242.932	medicine at its best, really.
247.224	Every patient we do
247.224	has an absolutely bespoke implant.
252.757	Once you've made it,
252.757	the installation is quite easy.
255.834	John Pepper, bless his heart,
255.834	professor of cardiothoracic surgery.
261.154	Never done it before in his life,
261.154	he put the first one in, didn't like it,
264.656	he put the second one in.
266.047	Happy, away I went.
267.345	Four and a half hours on the table,
267.345	and everything was done.
270.179	So the surgical implantation
270.179	was actually the easiest part.
274.005	If you compare our new treatment
274.005	to the existing alternative,
277.217	the composite aortic root graft,
279.008	there are one or two startling comparisons
281.387	which I'm sure will be
281.387	clear to all of you.
284.735	Two hours to install one of our devices,
287.033	compared to 6 hours
287.033	for the existing treatment.
291.444	As I said, the existing treatment
291.444	requires the heart-lung bypass machine,
294.949	and it requires a total body cooling.
296.765	We don't need any of that.
296.765	We work on a beating heart.
299.468	He opens you up,
300.783	he accesses the aorta
300.783	while your heart is beating,
303.243	all at the right temperature.
304.729	No breaking into your circulatory system.
306.907	So it really is great.
308.42	But for me, absolutely the best point is,
311.783	there is no anticoagulation
311.783	therapy required.
314.671	I don't take any drugs at all,
316.386	other than recreational ones
316.386	that I would choose to take.
319.147	(Laughter)
320.524	And in fact, if you speak to people
320.524	who are on long-term warfarin,
323.78	it is a serious compromise
323.78	to your quality of life,
326.708	and even worse, it inevitably
326.708	foreshortens your life.
331.246	Likewise, if you have
331.246	the artificial valve option,
333.771	you're committed to antibiotic therapy
335.605	whenever you have
335.605	any intrusive medical treatment,
338.696	even trips to the dentist
338.696	require that you take antibiotics,
341.653	in case you get an internal
341.653	infection on the valve.
344.512	Again, I don't have any of that,
344.512	so I'm entirely free,
347.531	my artery is fixed.
349.452	I haven't got to worry about it,
349.452	which is a rebirth for me.
355.486	Back to the theme of the presentation,
355.486	multidisciplinary research,
358.607	how on earth does a process engineer
358.607	used to working with boilers
361.758	end up producing a medical device
361.758	which transforms his own life?
365.759	Well, the answer to that is,
365.759	a multidisciplinary team.
368.907	This is a list of the core team,
371.643	and you can see there aren't only two
371.643	principal technical disciplines there,
376.89	medicine and engineering,
378.182	but also, there are various specialists
378.182	from within those two disciplines.
382.739	John Pepper was the cardiac surgeon
382.739	who did all the actual work on me.
387.643	But everyone else had to contribute
387.643	one way or another.
390.987	Raad Mohiaddin, a medical radiologist.
392.821	We had to get good-quality images
392.821	from which to make the CAD model.
396.894	Warren Thornton, who still does
396.894	all our CAD models for us,
399.741	had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code
402.749	to produce this model from this
402.749	really rather difficult input data set.
409.861	There are some barriers to this, though,
409.861	there are some problems.
413.042	Jargon is a big one.
414.319	I would think no one in this room
414.319	understands the first four jargon points.
419.905	The engineers amongst you will recognize
419.905	"""rapid prototyping"" and ""CAD."""
423.375	The medics amongst you, if there are any,
423.375	will recognize the first two,
426.733	but there will be nobody else here
426.733	that understands all those four words.
430.39	Taking the jargon out was very important
432.434	to ensure that everyone in the team
432.434	understood exactly what was meant
436.615	when a particular phrase was used.
439.289	Our disciplinary conventions
439.289	were funny as well.
441.845	We took a lot of horizontal slice
441.845	images through me,
444.904	produced those slices and used them
444.904	to build a CAD model.
448.842	And the very first CAD model we made,
450.727	the surgeons were playing with it
450.727	and couldn't quite figure it out.
455.49	And then we realized that it was actually
455.49	a mirror image of the real aorta.
459.379	And it was a mirror image
459.379	because in the real world,
462.86	we always look down on plans,
464.695	plans of houses, or streets, or maps.
467.268	In the medical world,
467.268	they look up at plans.
470.449	So the horizontal images
470.449	were all in inversion.
473.951	So, one needs to be careful
473.951	with disciplinary conventions.
476.69	Everyone needs to understand
476.69	what is assumed and what is not.
482.092	Institutional barriers were
482.092	another serious headache in the project.
486.211	The Brompton Hospital was taken over
488.324	by the Imperial College
488.324	School of Medicine.
490.614	And there are some seriously bad
490.614	relationship problems
494.281	between the two organizations.
495.762	I was working with the Imperial
495.762	and the Brompton,
498.096	and this generated some serious
498.096	problems for the project.
500.791	Really, problems that shouldn't exist.
503.847	Research &amp; Ethics Committee.
505.27	If you want to do anything new in surgery,
507.294	you have to get a license
507.294	from your local Research &amp; Ethics.
510.307	I'm sure it's the same in Poland.
512.156	There will be some form of equivalent
512.156	which licenses new types of surgery.
517.608	We didn't only have the bureaucratic
517.608	problems associated with that,
520.775	we also had professional jealousies.
522.886	There were people
522.886	on the Research &amp; Ethics committee
525.339	who really didn't want to see
525.339	John Pepper succeed again.
528.092	Because he is so successful.
529.967	And they made extra problems for us.
533.701	Bureaucratic problems.
535.674	Ultimately, when you have a new treatment,
538.352	you have to have a guidance note
538.352	for all the hospitals in the country.
542.393	In the UK, we have the National Institute
542.393	and Clinical Excellence.
546.037	You have an equivalent
546.037	in Poland, no doubt.
548.061	And we had to get past the NICE problem.
551.37	We now have a great clinical
551.37	guidance, out on the net.
554.156	So any other hospitals interested
554.156	can come along, read the NICE report,
558.82	get in touch with us,
558.82	and then get doing it themselves.
564.026	Funding barriers, another big area
564.026	to be concerned with.
570.424	A big problem with understanding
570.424	one of those perspectives.
573.258	When we first approached one of the big,
573.258	charitable UK organizations
577.545	that fund this kind of stuff,
579.082	we essentially gave them
579.082	an engineering proposal.
581.511	They didn't understand it,
581.511	they were doctors, next to God,
584.331	it must be rubbish, they binned it.
586.205	So in the end, I went after
586.205	private investors, just gave up on it.
589.465	Most R&amp;D is going to be
589.465	institutionally funded,
592.719	by the Polish Academy of Sciences
595.103	or the Engineering and Physical Sciences
595.103	Research Council, or whatever.
598.792	And you need to get past those people.
601.009	Jargon is a huge problem
601.009	when you try to work across disciplines,
604.16	because in an engineering world,
604.16	we all understand CAD and RP.
607.831	Not in the medical world.
610.009	I suppose the funding bureaucrats
610.009	ultimately have to get their act together.
613.605	They've really got to start
613.605	talking to each other,
615.981	and exercise a bit of imagination,
615.981	if that's not too much to ask.
619.361	(Laughter)
620.596	Which it probably is.
622.509	(Laughter)
623.848	I've coined the phrase
623.848	"""obstructive conservatism."""
626.232	So many people in the medical world
626.232	don't want to change.
629.838	Particularly when some jumped-up engineer
629.838	has come along with the answer.
633.378	They don't want to change.
634.789	They simply want to do
634.789	whatever they've done before.
637.242	And in fact, many surgeons
637.242	in the UK are still waiting
640.565	for one of our patients
640.565	to have some sort of an episode,
643.718	so that they could say,
643.718	"""Told you that was no good."""
646.397	We've actually got 30 patients.
648.657	At seven and a half years,
650.507	we've got 90 post-op
650.507	patient years between us,
652.696	and we haven't had a single problem.
654.496	And still, there are people
654.496	in the UK saying,
656.658	"""That external aortic root,"
656.658	"it will never work, you know."""
659.787	It really is a problem.
662.216	I'm sure everyone in this room
662.216	has come across arrogance
665.043	amongst medics, doctors,
665.043	surgeons, at some point.
668.835	The middle point is simply the way
668.835	that the doctors protect themselves.
673.223	"""Well, of course,"
673.223	"I'm looking after my patient."""
675.598	I think it's not good, but that's my view.
679.999	Egos, of course, again a huge problem.
682.122	If you work in a multidisciplinary team,
684.084	you've got to give your guys
684.084	the benefit of the doubt,
686.913	you've got to express support for them.
688.813	Tom Treasure, professor
688.813	of cardiothoracic surgery.
692.303	Incredible guy.
693.548	Dead easy to give him respect.
695.062	Him giving me respect? Slightly different.
697.851	(Laughter)
699.327	That's all the bad news.
700.682	The good news is,
700.682	the benefits are stonkingly huge.
704.927	Translate that one! I bet they can't.
707.06	(Laughter)
708.728	When you have a group of people
708.728	with different professional training,
711.991	a different professional experience,
713.916	they not only have a different
713.916	knowledge base,
716.089	but also a different perspective
716.089	on everything.
718.334	And if you can bring them together,
720.059	and get them talking
720.059	and understanding each other,
722.895	the results can be spectacular.
725.527	You can find really novel solutions
725.527	that have never been looked at before,
730.642	very quickly and easily.
732.388	You can short-cut huge amounts of work
735.681	simply by using the extended
735.681	knowledge base you have.
739.31	And as a result,
739.31	it's an entirely different use
744.106	of the technology
744.106	and the knowledge around you.
747.168	The result of all this is that you can get
747.168	incredibly quick progress
751.307	on incredibly small budgets.
753.8	I'm so embarrassed at how cheap
753.8	it was to get from my idea
757.697	to me being implanted
759.055	that I'm not prepared
759.055	to tell you what it cost,
761.339	because I suspect there are
761.339	absolutely standard surgical treatments,
765.628	probably in the USA,
766.998	which cost more for a one-off patient
771.814	than the cost of us getting from
771.814	my dream to my reality.
776.715	That's all I want to say,
776.715	and I've got three minutes left.
779.501	So, Ewa's going to like me.
781.399	If you have any questions,
781.399	please come up and talk to me later on,
784.519	it would be a pleasure to speak with you.
786.652	Many thanks.
787.684	(Applause)
