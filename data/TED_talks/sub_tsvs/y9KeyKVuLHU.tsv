12.999	Have you ever wondered
12.999	what animals think and feel?
17.02	Let's start with a question:
19.654	Does my dog really love me,
19.654	or does she just want a treat?
24.991	Well, it's easy to see
24.991	that our dog really loves us,
29.982	easy to see, right,
32.087	what's going on in that fuzzy little head.
36.593	What is going on?
39.155	Something's going on.
41.864	But why is the question always
41.864	do they love us?
46.287	Why is it always about us?
48.422	Why are we such narcissists?
52.674	I found a different question
52.674	to ask animals.
57.911	Who are you?
61.91	There are capacities of the human mind
64.829	that we tend to think are capacities
64.829	only of the human mind.
70.176	But is that true?
72.047	What are other beings
72.047	doing with those brains?
76.554	What are they thinking and feeling?
79.57	Is there a way to know?
81.227	I think there is a way in.
82.925	I think there are several ways in.
84.95	We can look at evolution,
84.95	we can look at their brains
89.096	and we can watch what they do.
93.316	The first thing to remember is:
93.316	our brain is inherited.
98.253	The first neurons came from jellyfish.
102.435	Jellyfish gave rise
102.435	to the first chordates.
105.299	The first chordates gave rise
105.299	to the first vertebrates.
109.277	The vertebrates came out of the sea,
111.719	and here we are.
114.737	But it's still true that a neuron,
114.737	a nerve cell, looks the same
120.351	in a crayfish, a bird or you.
124.427	What does that say
124.427	about the minds of crayfish?
128.88	Can we tell anything about that?
130.461	Well, it turns out that
130.461	if you give a crayfish
134.514	a lot of little tiny electric shocks
137.195	every time it tries
137.195	to come out of its burrow,
139.515	it will develop anxiety.
143.133	If you give the crayfish the same drug
146.575	used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,
149.522	it relaxes and comes out and explores.
154.308	How do we show how much
154.308	we care about crayfish anxiety?
157.905	Mostly, we boil them.
159.283	(Laughter)
162.49	Octopuses use tools,
162.49	as well as do most apes
167.872	and they recognize human faces.
170.808	How do we celebrate the ape-like
170.808	intelligence of this invertebrate?
175.999	Mostly boiled.
178.669	If a grouper chases a fish
178.669	into a crevice in the coral,
182.999	it will sometimes go to where it knows
182.999	a moray eel is sleeping
187.999	and it will signal
187.999	"to the moray, ""Follow me,"""
191.596	and the moray will understand that signal.
194.816	The moray may go into the crevice
194.816	and get the fish,
197.817	but the fish may bolt
197.817	and the grouper may get it.
200.88	This is an ancient partnership that we
200.88	have just recently found out about.
206.935	How do we celebrate
206.935	that ancient partnership?
210.044	Mostly fried.
212.918	A pattern is emerging and it says
212.918	a lot more about us
216.542	than it does about them.
219.61	Sea otters use tools
222.039	and they take time away
222.039	from what they're doing
225.04	to show their babies what to do,
225.04	which is called teaching.
229.205	Chimpanzees don't teach.
232.999	Killer whales teach
232.999	and killer whales share food.
238.879	When evolution makes something new,
240.937	it uses the parts it has
240.937	in stock, off the shelf,
245.314	before it fabricates a new twist.
247.8	And our brain has come to us
250	through the enormity
250	of the deep sweep of time.
254.425	If you look at the human brain
254.425	compared to a chimpanzee brain,
258.038	what you see is we have basically
258.038	a very big chimpanzee brain.
261.726	It's a good thing ours is bigger,
261.726	because we're also really insecure.
265.691	(Laughter)
267.777	But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,
270.917	a bigger brain with more convolutions.
274.777	OK, maybe you're saying,
274.777	all right, well, we see brains,
277.508	but what does that
277.508	have to say about minds?
280.347	Well, we can see the working of the mind
284.242	in the logic of behaviors.
286.53	So these elephants, you can see,
290.185	obviously, they are resting.
293.118	They have found a patch of shade
293.118	under the palm trees
297.506	under which to let their babies sleep,
300.33	while they doze but remain vigilant.
303.491	We make perfect sense of that image
306.367	just as they make perfect sense
306.367	of what they're doing
310.022	because under the arc of the same sun
310.022	on the same plains,
313.848	listening to the howls
313.848	of the same dangers,
317.298	they became who they are
317.298	and we became who we are.
322.536	We've been neighbors for a very long time.
324.736	No one would mistake
324.736	these elephants as being relaxed.
328.204	They're obviously very
328.204	concerned about something.
331.14	What are they concerned about?
333.68	It turns out that if you record
333.68	the voices of tourists
337.344	and you play that recording
337.344	from a speaker hidden in bushes,
342.062	elephants will ignore it,
342.062	because tourists never bother elephants.
346.102	But if you record the voices of herders
350.868	who carry spears and often hurt elephants
350.868	in confrontations at water holes,
355.981	the elephants will bunch up
355.981	and run away from the hidden speaker.
360.699	Not only do elephants know
360.699	that there are humans,
364.082	they know that there are
364.082	different kinds of humans,
366.642	and that some are OK
366.642	and some are dangerous.
370.248	They have been watching us for much longer
370.248	than we have been watching them.
375.339	They know us better than we know them.
378.272	We have the same imperatives:
381.144	take care of our babies,
381.144	find food, try to stay alive.
386.478	Whether we're outfitted for hiking
386.478	in the hills of Africa
390.331	or outfitted for diving under the sea,
390.331	we are basically the same.
394.538	We are kin under the skin.
396.999	The elephant has the same skeleton,
399.426	the killer whale has the same skeleton,
401.792	as do we.
405.674	We see helping where help is needed.
408.56	We see curiosity in the young.
412.467	We see the bonds of family connections.
417.776	We recognize affection.
420.522	Courtship is courtship.
423.999	"And then we ask, ""Are they conscious?"""
427.3	When you get general anesthesia,
427.3	it makes you unconscious,
430.224	which means you have
430.224	no sensation of anything.
433.083	Consciousness is simply
433.083	the thing that feels like something.
437.292	If you see, if you hear, if you feel,
437.292	if you're aware of anything,
441.465	you are conscious, and they are conscious.
447.165	Some people say
448.355	well, there are certain things
448.355	that make humans humans,
450.984	and one of those things is empathy.
452.93	Empathy is the mind's ability
452.93	to match moods with your companions.
459.442	It's a very useful thing.
461.049	If your companions start to move quickly,
463.233	you have to feel like
463.233	you need to hurry up.
465.492	We're all in a hurry now.
467.246	The oldest form of empathy
467.246	is contagious fear.
470.757	If your companions suddenly
470.757	startle and fly away,
473.627	it does not work very well for you to say,
475.815	"""Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."""
478.742	(Laughter)
483.136	Empathy is old, but empathy,
483.136	like everything else in life,
486.999	comes on a sliding scale
486.999	and has its elaboration.
490.934	So there's basic empathy:
490.934	you feel sad, it makes me sad.
494.679	I see you happy, it makes me happy.
497.192	Then there's something
497.192	that I call sympathy,
499.999	a little more removed:
502.365	"""I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother"
502.365	has just passed away.
505.856	I don't feel that same grief,
505.856	but I get it; I know what you feel
509.507	"and it concerns me."""
510.944	And then if we're motivated
510.944	to act on sympathy,
513.585	I call that compassion.
516.061	Far from being the thing
516.061	that makes us human,
519.635	human empathy is far from perfect.
522.999	We round up empathic creatures,
522.999	we kill them and we eat them.
528.034	Now, maybe you say OK,
528.034	well, those are different species.
530.925	That's just predation,
530.925	and humans are predators.
534.667	But we don't treat our own kind
534.667	too well either.
541.212	People who seem to know
541.212	only one thing about animal behavior
544.39	know that you must never attribute
544.39	human thoughts and emotions
548.387	to other species.
550.723	Well, I think that's silly,
552.568	because attributing human thoughts
552.568	and emotions to other species
556.714	is the best first guess about what
556.714	they're doing and how they're feeling,
560.989	because their brains
560.989	are basically the same as ours.
564.326	They have the same structures.
566.081	The same hormones that create
566.081	mood and motivation in us
571.155	are in those brains as well.
575.05	It is not scientific to say that they
575.05	are hungry when they're hunting
580.144	and they're tired when
580.144	their tongues are hanging out,
583.115	and then say when they're playing
583.115	with their children
585.829	and acting joyful and happy,
587.764	we have no idea if they can possibly
587.764	be experiencing anything.
592.577	That is not scientific.
595.619	So OK, so a reporter said to me,
598.328	"""Maybe, but how do you really know"
598.328	"that other animals can think and feel?"""
602.66	And I started to rifle
602.66	through all the hundreds
605.739	of scientific references
605.739	that I put in my book
608.262	and I realized that the answer
608.262	was right in the room with me.
611.526	When my dog gets off the rug
611.526	and comes over to me --
615.303	not to the couch, to me --
617.089	and she rolls over on her back
617.089	and exposes her belly,
621.29	she has had the thought,
621.29	"""I would like my belly rubbed."
626.565	I know that I can go over to Carl,
629.125	he will understand what I'm asking.
632.084	I know I can trust him
632.084	because we're family.
635.406	He'll get the job done,
635.406	"and it will feel good."""
638.145	(Laughter)
640.055	She has thought and she has felt,
643.408	and it's really not
643.408	more complicated than that.
646.096	But we see other animals
646.096	"and we say, ""Oh look, killer whales,"
650.733	wolves, elephants:
653.167	"that's not how they see it."""
655.714	That tall-finned male is L41.
660.032	He's 38 years old.
662.103	The female right on his left side is L22.
665.899	She's 44.
667.475	They've known each other for decades.
670.65	They know exactly who they are.
672.646	They know who their friends are.
674.221	They know who their rivals are.
675.943	Their life follows the arc of a career.
678.802	They know where they are all the time.
682.863	This is an elephant named Philo.
685.667	He was a young male.
687.519	This is him four days later.
690.999	Humans not only can feel grief,
690.999	we create an awful lot of it.
698.648	We want to carve their teeth.
702.153	Why can't we wait for them to die?
707.998	Elephants once ranged from the shores
707.998	of the Mediterranean Sea
711.49	all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.
713.589	In 1980, there were vast
713.589	strongholds of elephant range
716.999	in Central and Eastern Africa.
719.211	And now their range is shattered
719.211	into little shards.
723.572	This is the geography of an animal
723.572	that we are driving to extinction,
728.275	a fellow being, the most
728.275	magnificent creature on land.
733.288	Of course, we take much better care
733.288	of our wildlife in the United States.
737.681	In Yellowstone National Park,
737.681	we killed every single wolf.
741.94	We killed every single wolf
741.94	south of the Canadian border, actually.
745.413	But in the park, park rangers
745.413	did that in the 1920s,
749.83	and then 60 years later
749.83	they had to bring them back,
752.445	because the elk numbers
752.445	had gotten out of control.
756.511	And then people came.
757.809	People came by the thousands
757.809	to see the wolves,
761.557	the most accessibly
761.557	visible wolves in the world.
765.512	And I went there and I watched
765.512	this incredible family of wolves.
768.788	A pack is a family.
770.265	It has some breeding adults
770.265	and the young of several generations.
775.158	And I watched the most famous, most stable
775.158	pack in Yellowstone National Park.
780.37	And then, when they wandered
780.37	just outside the border,
783.524	two of their adults were killed,
786.229	including the mother,
788.506	which we sometimes call the alpha female.
791.502	The rest of the family immediately
791.502	descended into sibling rivalry.
796.871	Sisters kicked out other sisters.
799.565	That one on the left tried for days
799.565	to rejoin her family.
803.07	They wouldn't let her
803.07	because they were jealous of her.
805.786	She was getting too much attention
805.786	from two new males,
808.623	and she was the precocious one.
810.665	That was too much for them.
812.342	She wound up wandering
812.342	outside the park and getting shot.
816.463	The alpha male wound up
816.463	being ejected from his own family.
820.436	As winter was coming in,
822.463	he lost his territory,
822.463	his hunting support,
826.237	the members of his family and his mate.
830.883	We cause so much pain to them.
835.665	The mystery is, why don't
835.665	they hurt us more than they do?
841.855	This whale had just finished eating
841.855	part of a grey whale
845.077	with his companions
845.077	who had killed that whale.
847.68	Those people in the boat
847.68	had nothing at all to fear.
851.999	This whale is T20.
854.488	He had just finished tearing a seal
854.488	into three pieces with two companions.
859.168	The seal weighed about as much
859.168	as the people in the boat.
861.884	They had nothing to fear.
864.189	They eat seals.
866.699	Why don't they eat us?
870.823	Why can we trust them around our toddlers?
876.488	Why is it that killer whales have returned
876.488	to researchers lost in thick fog
882.414	and led them miles until the fog parted
885.768	and the researchers' home
885.768	was right there on the shoreline?
888.957	And that's happened more than one time.
893.171	In the Bahamas, there's a woman
893.171	named Denise Herzing,
895.77	and she studies spotted dolphins
895.77	and they know her.
899.118	She knows them very well.
899.118	She knows who they all are.
901.74	They know her.
901.74	They recognize the research boat.
904.026	When she shows up,
904.026	it's a big happy reunion.
906.28	Except, one time showed up and they
906.28	didn't want to come near the boat,
909.619	and that was really strange.
911.717	And they couldn't figure out
911.717	what was going on
913.905	until somebody came out on deck
915.429	and announced that one
915.429	of the people onboard had died
918.088	during a nap in his bunk.
920.74	How could dolphins know
920.74	that one of the human hearts
924.69	had just stopped?
926.818	Why would they care?
929.132	And why would it spook them?
933.111	These mysterious things just hint at
933.111	all of the things that are going on
938.434	in the minds that are with us on Earth
941.2	that we almost never think about at all.
946.258	At an aquarium in South Africa
948.454	was a little baby bottle-nosed
948.454	dolphin named Dolly.
952.178	She was nursing, and one day
952.178	a keeper took a cigarette break
958.346	and he was looking into the window
958.346	into their pool, smoking.
962.477	Dolly came over and looked at him,
964.875	went back to her mother,
964.875	nursed for a minute or two,
968.777	came back to the window
970.604	and released a cloud of milk
970.604	that enveloped her head like smoke.
976.293	Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin
979.423	got the idea of using milk
979.423	to represent smoke.
984.211	When human beings use one thing
984.211	to represent another,
987.583	we call that art.
989.632	(Laughter)
991.679	The things that make us human
993.234	are not the things
993.234	that we think make us human.
996.781	What makes us human is that,
999.129	of all these things that our minds
999.129	and their minds have,
1002.289	we are the most extreme.
1006.347	We are the most compassionate,
1008.66	most violent, most creative
1011.701	and most destructive animal
1011.701	that has ever been on this planet,
1016.385	and we are all of those things
1016.385	all jumbled up together.
1021.341	But love is not the thing
1021.341	that makes us human.
1026.242	It's not special to us.
1029.674	We are not the only ones
1029.674	who care about our mates.
1033.669	We are not the only ones
1033.669	who care about our children.
1038.904	Albatrosses frequently fly six,
1038.904	sometimes ten thousand miles
1043.898	over several weeks to deliver
1043.898	one meal, one big meal,
1048.409	to their chick who is waiting for them.
1050.835	They nest on the most remote islands
1050.835	in the oceans of the world,
1055.257	and this is what it looks like.
1059.37	Passing life from one generation
1059.37	to the next is the chain of being.
1063.574	If that stops, it all goes away.
1066.975	If anything is sacred, that is,
1066.975	and into that sacred relationship
1071.649	comes our plastic trash.
1074.504	All of these birds
1074.504	have plastic in them now.
1077.99	This is an albatross six months old,
1077.99	ready to fledge --
1082.665	died, packed with red cigarette lighters.
1086.69	This is not the relationship
1086.69	we are supposed to have
1089.999	with the rest of the world.
1091.609	But we, who have named
1091.609	ourselves after our brains,
1096.195	never think about the consequences.
1101.041	When we welcome new
1101.041	human life into the world,
1104.185	we welcome our babies
1104.185	into the company of other creatures.
1108.712	We paint animals on the walls.
1110.829	We don't paint cell phones.
1112.681	We don't paint work cubicles.
1114.848	We paint animals to show them
1114.848	that we are not alone.
1119.316	We have company.
1122.527	And every one of those animals
1122.527	in every painting of Noah's ark,
1127.291	deemed worthy of salvation
1127.291	is in mortal danger now,
1131.655	and their flood is us.
1135.704	So we started with a question:
1138.027	Do they love us?
1141.999	We're going to ask another question.
1144.999	Are we capable of using what we have
1149.918	to care enough to simply
1149.918	let them continue?
1156.725	Thank you very much.
1158.09	(Applause)
