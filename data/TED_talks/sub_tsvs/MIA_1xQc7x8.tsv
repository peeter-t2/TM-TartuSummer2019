12.76	I have one more reason for optimism:
15.44	climate change.
16.92	Maybe you don't believe it,
16.92	but here is the fact.
20.4	On December 12, 2015,
24.6	in Paris, under the United Nations,
31.72	and unanimously --
34.6	if you've worked with governments,
34.6	you know how difficult that is --
37.84	unanimously decided
40.08	to intentionally change the course
40.08	of the global economy
44.92	in order to protect the most vulnerable
47.76	and improve the life of all of us.
50.44	Now, that is a remarkable achievement.
52.88	(Applause)
55.12	But it is even more remarkable
57.28	if you consider where we had been
57.28	just a few years ago.
63.96	Who remembers Copenhagen?
66.16	Well, after years of working
66.16	toward a climate agreement,
71.76	the same governments
71.76	convened in Copenhagen
76.08	and failed miserably.
78.64	Why did it fail miserably?
81.04	For many different reasons,
82.64	but primarily because
82.64	of the deeply entrenched divide
86.2	between the global
86.2	North and the global South.
90.72	So now, six months after this failure,
94.64	I was called in
94.64	to assume the responsibility
98	of the global climate change negotiations.
100.08	You can imagine, the perfect moment
100.08	to start this new job.
104.48	The global mood on climate change
104.48	was in the trash can.
108.2	No one believed
110.68	that a global agreement
110.68	could ever be possible.
114.16	In fact, neither did I.
117.16	If you promise not to tell anyone
117.16	outside of this wonderful TED audience,
122	I'm going to divulge a secret
124.12	that has been gratefully
124.12	buried by history.
129.6	On my first press conference,
132.32	"a journalist asked, ""Um, Ms. Figueres,"
135.72	do you think that a global agreement
135.72	"is ever going to be possible?"""
140.12	And without engaging brain,
140.12	I heard me utter,
144.48	"""Not in my lifetime."""
147.24	Well, you can imagine
147.24	the faces of my press team
150.8	who were horrified
150.8	at this crazy Costa Rican woman
154.52	who was their new boss.
156.72	And I was horrified, too.
159.36	Now, I wasn't horrified at me,
159.36	because I'm kind of used to myself.
162.64	I was actually horrified
164.84	at the consequences
164.84	of what I had just said,
168.56	at the consequences for the world
170.76	in which all our children
170.76	are going to have to live.
176.24	It was frankly a horrible moment for me,
179.08	and I thought, well, no, hang on,
181.2	hang on.
182.84	Impossible is not a fact,
186.68	it's an attitude.
188.8	It's only an attitude.
191.2	And I decided right then and there
191.2	that I was going to change my attitude
196.16	and I was going to help the world
196.16	change its attitude on climate change.
201.76	So I don't know --
204.76	No, just this? Thanks.
206.76	I don't know --
210.12	what you would do
211.68	if you were told
211.68	your job is to save the planet.
217.96	Put that on the job description.
221.04	And you have full responsibility,
223.72	but you have absolutely no authority,
226.88	because governments are sovereign
226.88	in every decision that they take.
232.56	Well, I would really love to know
236.04	what you would do
236.04	on the first Monday morning,
238.32	but here's what I did: I panicked.
240.76	(Laughter)
242.44	And then I panicked again,
244.96	because I realized I have no idea
244.96	how we're going to solve this problem.
249.8	And then I realized I have no idea
249.8	how we're going to solve this problem,
253.88	but I do know one thing:
256.84	we have got to change
256.84	the tone of this conversation.
261.84	Because there is no way
261.84	you can deliver victory
264.96	without optimism.
267.04	And here,
268.64	I use optimism as a very simple word,
273.2	but let's understand it
273.2	in its broader sense.
276	Let's understand it as courage,
278.92	hope, trust, solidarity,
282.92	the fundamental belief
282.92	that we humans can come together
287.84	and can help each other
287.84	to better the fate of mankind.
291.8	Well, you can imagine
291.8	that I thought that without that,
294.44	there was no way we were going
294.44	to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.
297.92	And for six years,
299.76	I have stubbornly, relentlessly
299.76	injected optimism into the system,
305.64	no matter what the questions
305.64	from the press --
308.52	and I have gotten better at those --
310.72	and no matter what the evidence
310.72	to the contrary.
313.92	And believe you me, there has been
313.92	a lot of contrary evidence.
321.36	But relentless optimism into the system.
326.88	And pretty soon,
328.88	we began to see changes
328.88	happening in many areas,
334.24	precipitated by thousands of people,
337.52	including many of you here today,
340.16	and I thank you.
342.04	And this TED community
342.04	will not be surprised
347.16	if I tell you the first area
349.8	in which we saw remarkable change
352.96	was ...
355.32	technology.
357.6	We began to see that clean technologies,
360.24	in particular renewable
360.24	energy technologies,
362.72	began to drop price
362.72	and increase in capacity,
365.36	to the point where today
365.36	we are already building
368.44	concentrated solar power plants
370.2	that have the capacity
370.2	to power entire cities,
374.68	to say nothing of the fact
374.68	of what we are doing on mobility
378.84	and intelligent buildings.
381.4	And with this shift in technologies,
384.24	we were able to begin to understand
387.44	that there was a shift
387.44	in the economic equation,
391.72	because we were able to recognize
393.84	that yes, there are
393.84	huge costs to climate change,
396.96	and yes, there are compounded risks.
399.52	But there also are economic advantages
402.2	and intrinsic benefits,
403.92	because the dissemination
403.92	of the clean technologies
406.88	is going to bring us cleaner air,
410.64	better health,
412.04	better transportation,
412.04	more livable cities,
414.6	more energy security,
416.16	more energy access
416.16	to the developing world.
419.64	In sum, a better world
419.64	than what we have now.
423.84	And with that understanding,
426.84	you should have witnessed,
426.84	in fact, part of you were,
430.36	the spread of ingenuity and excitement
434.72	that went through,
434.72	first through nonnational governments,
438.76	the private sector, captains of industry,
438.76	insurance companies,
442.92	investors, city leaders,
442.92	faith communities,
447.24	because they all began to understand,
447.24	this actually can be in their interest.
452.6	This can actually
452.6	improve their bottom line.
457.84	And it wasn't just the usual suspects.
464.76	I have to tell you I had the CEO
464.76	of a major, major oil and gas company
470.08	come to me at the beginning of last year
472.44	and say --
474.52	privately, of course --
477.28	he did not know how
477.28	he was going to change his company,
481.16	but he is going to change it,
483.36	because he's interested
483.36	in long-term viability.
486.84	Well, now we have a shift
486.84	in the economic equation,
492.04	and with that, with broader
492.04	support from everyone,
496.4	it did not take very long
496.4	before we saw that national governments
502.8	woke up to the fact
502.8	that this is in their national interest.
507.68	And when we asked countries
507.68	to begin to identify
511.84	how they could contribute
511.84	to global efforts
515.76	but based on their national interest,
	comprehensive climate change plans,
527.76	based on their national interest,
529.919	concurrent with their priorities,
531.84	consistent with their national
531.84	sustainable development plans.
536.68	Well,
538.8	once you protect
538.8	the core interests of nations,
544	then you can understand
544	that nations were ready
547.68	to begin to converge onto a common path,
551.32	onto a common direction of travel
554.6	that is going to take us
554.6	probably several decades,
557.76	but over those several decades
557.76	is going to take us
560.28	into the new economy,
561.76	into a decarbonized,
561.76	highly resilient economy,
565.36	And the national contributions
565.36	that are currently on the table
568.76	on behalf of national governments
571.08	are insufficient to get us
571.08	to a stabilized climate,
575.24	but they are only the first step,
577.32	and they will improve over time.
579.36	And the measurement, reporting
579.36	and verification of all of those efforts
583.8	is legally binding.
585.48	And the checkpoints that we're
585.48	going to have every five years
589.24	to assess collective progress
589.24	towards our goal are legally binding,
593.76	and the path itself toward
593.76	a decarbonized and more resilient economy
598.68	is legally binding.
600.48	And here's the more important part:
602.52	What did we have before?
603.96	A very small handful of countries
607.04	who had undertaken very reduced,
611.32	short-term emission reduction commitments
614.4	that were completely insufficient
617.6	and furthermore,
617.6	largely perceived as a burden.
621.04	Now what do we have?
622.48	Now we have all countries of the world
622.48	contributing with different intensities
628.08	from different approaches
628.08	in different sectors,
630.4	but all of them
630.4	contributing to a common goal
635.04	and along a path
637.52	with environmental integrity.
640.4	Well, once you have all of this in place
644.48	and you have shifted this understanding,
646.72	then you see that governments
646.72	were able to go to Paris
651.12	and adopt the Paris agreement.
653.68	(Applause)
661.36	So,
663.28	as I look back
668.44	over the past six years,
674	first I remember
676.48	the day the Paris agreement was adopted.
680.8	I cannot tell you
680.8	the euphoria in the room.
683.4	5,000 people jumping out of their seats,
686.8	crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,
690.48	torn between euphoria and still disbelief
690.48	at what they had just seen,
695.8	because so many people
698.44	had worked for years towards this,
698.44	and this was finally their reality.
704.48	And it wasn't just those
704.48	who had participated directly.
709.6	A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague
712.4	who was trying to decide
714.24	on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted
714.24	to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.
721.16	And once he had finally decided
721.16	what he was going to buy,
726.76	the jeweler said to him,
728	"""You know, you're very lucky"
728	that you're buying this now,
730.84	because these pearls could go extinct
730.84	"very soon because of climate change."""
736.24	"""But,"" the jeweler said, ""have you heard,"
739.8	the governments
739.8	have just come to a decision,
742.6	"and Tahiti could have a chance."""
746.8	Well, what a fantastic confirmation
750.04	that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,
754.08	here is a possible chance.
757.64	I'm the first one to recognize
757.64	that we have a lot of work still to do.
762.32	We've only just started
762.32	our work on climate change.
765.68	And in fact, we need to make sure
765.68	that we redouble our efforts
769.4	over the next five years
769.4	that are the urgent five years.
774.64	But I do believe
777.52	that we have come over the past six years
780.48	from the impossible
782.44	to the now unstoppable.
784.56	And how did we do that?
784.56	By injecting transformational optimism
789.64	that allowed us to go
789.64	from confrontation to collaboration,
793.12	that allowed us to understand
793.12	that national and local interests
796.44	are not necessarily at odds
796.44	with global needs,
799.84	and that if we understand that,
799.84	we can bring them together
802.579	and we can merge them harmoniously.
804.84	And as I look forward
804.84	to other global issues
808.6	that will require
808.6	our attention this century --
812.48	food security, water security,
812.48	home security, forced migration --
819.08	I see that we certainly do not know
821.52	how we are going to solve
821.52	those problems yet.
825.08	But we can take a page
825.08	out of what we have done on climate change
829.8	and we can understand
831.08	that we have got to reinterpret
831.08	the zero-sum mentality.
837.4	Because we were trained to believe
837.4	that there always are winners and losers,
842.4	and that your loss is my gain.
844.64	Well, now that we're in a world
846.76	in which we have reached
846.76	planetary boundaries
849.72	and that we are not
849.72	just so interconnected,
852.4	but increasingly
852.4	interdependent on each other,
855.84	your loss is no longer my gain.
858.76	We're either all losers
862.16	or we all can be winners.
864.92	But we are going to have to decide
867.24	between zero and sum.
871.04	We're going to have to decide
871.04	between zero benefit for all
875.92	or living life as the sum of all of us.
879.92	We've done it once. We can do it again.
882.28	Thanks.
883.52	(Applause)
