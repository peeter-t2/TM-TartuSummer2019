15.358	So I have bad news, I have good news,
18.419	and I have a task.
20.284	So the bad news is that we all get sick.
23.227	I get sick. You get sick.
25.499	And every one of us gets sick, and the question really is,
28.041	how sick do we get? Is it something that kills us?
30.918	Is it something that we survive?
32.263	Is it something that we can treat?
34.191	And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people.
37.447	And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick.
40.933	And for a long time, it was the gods, right?
42.89	The gods are angry with me, or the gods are testing me,
46.044	right? Or God, singular, more recently,
48.46	is punishing me or judging me.
51.124	And as long as we've looked for explanations,
53.804	we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science,
57.515	which is hypotheses as to why we get sick,
60.004	and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick, we've tried to treat it as well.
64.744	"So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called ""The Canon of Medicine,"""
68.777	and the rules he laid out for testing medicines
71.183	are actually really similar to the rules we have today,
72.972	that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength,
75.917	the medicine needs to be pure, and in the end we need
78.314	to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes
81.455	of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing,
85.92	right, you get some beautiful results,
88.576	even when we didn't have very good technologies.
90.018	This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis
93.08	that was way outside the box for his time, in the late 1800s.
95.985	He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing.
98.833	He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos.
101.259	And they laughed at him. For 20 years, they called this guy
103.621	"""the mosquito man."" But he ran an experiment in people,"
107.11	right? He had this hypothesis, and he tested it in people.
110.213	So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents
114.855	and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever.
117.89	So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes
120.912	and some of the people were in tents that were full
122.131	of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever.
124.387	And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust
127.788	called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever.
131.21	But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew.
134.586	And this is what those people signed up for.
136.545	This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba
139.635	at that time. You suffered in a tent, in the heat, alone,
144.169	and you probably died.
146.865	But people volunteered for this.
150.082	And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design
153.393	of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing.
156.306	They signed this document, and it's called an informed consent document.
160.225	And informed consent is an idea that we should be
162.738	very proud of as a society, right? It's something that
164.964	separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg,
167.73	enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea
170.605	that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement.
174.393	It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters,
178.502	from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical
181.355	study that we don't understand, or that we don't agree to.
185.107	And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis,
189.436	experimentation in humans, and informed consent,
192.033	and you get what we call clinical study, and it's how we do
194.698	the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter
197.713	if you're in the north, the south, the east, the west.
200.055	Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate,
204.168	so if we're going to look at a new drug, right,
206.027	we test it in people, we draw blood, we do experiments,
209.025	and we gain consent for that study, to make sure
211.354	that we're not screwing people over as part of it.
214.003	But the world is changing around the clinical study,
217.667	which has been fairly well established for tens of years
221.033	if not 50 to 100 years.
222.933	So now we're able to gather data about our genomes,
225.984	but, as we saw earlier, our genomes aren't dispositive.
228.844	We're able to gather information about our environment.
231.61	And more importantly, we're able to gather information
233.52	about our choices, because it turns out that what we think of
236.36	as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies,
239.08	our genomes, our choices and our environment.
242.729	And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good
245.473	at studying that because they are based on the idea
248.105	of person-to-person interaction. You interact
250.019	with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study.
252.114	So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him,
254.729	but he's holding my mom, and his genes are in me, right?
258.524	His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker,
261.415	like most people were. This is my son.
263.999	So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him,
267.441	and my choices are going to affect his health.
269.993	The technology between these two pictures
272.687	cannot be more different, but the methodology
276.36	for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period.
280.484	We just have better statistics.
283.152	The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part
286.604	after World War II, around the time that picture was taken.
289.195	That was 70 years ago, and the way we gain informed consent,
293.129	this tool that was created to protect us from harm,
296.006	now creates silos. So the data that we collect
299.672	for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials
302.398	goes into silos where it can only be used
305.013	for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research.
308.237	Right? It can't be networked. It can't be integrated.
311.131	It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed.
314.664	So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
317.617	A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork.
320.685	Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork.
324.828	And this is an accident. These are tools that we created
328.814	to protect us from harm, but what they're doing
332.081	is protecting us from innovation now.
334.611	And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right?
337.876	It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created
340.575	to take us for good.
342.934	And so if you think about it, the depressing thing is that
346.078	Facebook would never make a change to something
348.211	as important as an advertising algorithm
350.782	with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial.
355.193	We cannot take the information from past trials
358.855	and put them together to form statistically significant samples.
363.009	And that sucks, right? So 45 percent of men develop
366.493	cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer.
369.59	One in four men dies of cancer.
371.934	One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States.
375.49	And three out of the four drugs we give you
377.718	if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me.
381.231	My sister is a cancer survivor.
383.194	My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks.
386.783	And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy
388.973	in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time.
392.46	People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you,
396.155	and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created
399.596	to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used,
402.694	especially when only three to four percent of people
404.744	who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study,
407.542	"their reaction is not, ""Thank you, God, for protecting my privacy."""
411.1	It's outrage
413.797	that we have this information and we can't use it.
415.922	And it's an accident.
418.398	So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous.
421.453	Two hundred and twenty-six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States.
425.108	Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States.
428.327	And it's getting worse.
430.9	So the good news is that some things have changed,
433.882	and the most important thing that's changed
435.435	is that we can now measure ourselves in ways
437.773	that used to be the dominion of the health system.
440.831	So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust.
442.989	I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid.
446.031	We can reach back and grab that dust,
448.407	and we can learn a lot about health from it, so if our choices
450.821	are part of our health, what we eat is a really important
453.501	aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple
456.19	and basic and take a picture of your food,
458.147	and if enough people do that, we can learn a lot about
461.031	how our food affects our health.
462.456	One interesting thing that came out of this — this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery —
466.972	is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier
469.462	than other people's pizza is. Okay? (Laughter)
472.9	And it seems like a trivial result, but this is the sort of research
476.508	that used to take the health system years
478.822	and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish.
481.115	It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people.
484.839	I don't have any financial interest in it.
487.463	But more nontrivially, we can get our genotypes done,
490.159	and although our genotypes aren't dispositive, they give us clues.
492.977	So I could show you mine. It's just A's, T's, C's and G's.
495.783	This is the interpretation of it. As you can see,
498.015	I carry a 32 percent risk of prostate cancer,
504.838	So that means, if you're a geneticist, you're freaking out,
507.445	"going, ""Oh my God, you told everyone you carry the ApoE E4 allele. What's wrong with you?"""
511.479	Right? When I got these results, I started talking to doctors,
515.167	and they told me not to tell anyone, and my reaction is,
517.576	"""Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease?"""
520.864	And no one could tell me yes.
523.928	And I live in a web world where, when you share things,
526.734	beautiful stuff happens, not bad stuff.
529.444	So I started putting this in my slide decks,
531.344	and I got even more obnoxious, and I went to my doctor,
533.805	"and I said, ""I'd like to actually get my bloodwork."
535.787	"Please give me back my data."" So this is my most recent bloodwork."
538.577	As you can see, I have high cholesterol.
540.946	I have particularly high bad cholesterol, and I have some
543.697	bad liver numbers, but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine
546.7	the night before we ran the test. (Laughter)
549.409	Right. But look at how non-computable this information is.
553.822	This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom
556.796	from a data perspective, and I had to go into the system
560.395	and get it out.
562.557	So the thing that I'm proposing we do here
565.839	is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust,
568.255	that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype,
571.233	and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records,
573.934	and we use it to build something together, which is a commons.
577.374	And there's been a lot of talk about commonses, right,
580.518	here, there, everywhere, right. A commons is nothing more
583.466	than a public good that we build out of private goods.
586.394	We do it voluntarily, and we do it through standardized
589.163	legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies.
591.963	Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build
595.234	together because we think it's important.
597.754	And a commons of data is something that's really unique,
600.386	because we make it from our own data. And although
603.254	a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control
605.541	around data, and obsess around privacy, at least
607.796	some of us really like to share as a form of control,
610.844	and what's remarkable about digital commonses
613.197	is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough
616.729	to generate something massive and beautiful.
619.24	So not that many programmers write free software,
621.798	but we have the Apache web server.
624.133	Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit,
626.83	but it works. So as long as some people like to share
630.839	as their form of control, we can build a commons, as long as we can get the information out.
634.583	And in biology, the numbers are even better.
636.959	So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people, we'd like to take
639.511	your biosamples, your blood, and share them in a biobank,
642.833	and only five percent of the people opted out.
645.205	I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science-positive state
648.297	in the United States of America. (Laughter)
651.336	But only five percent of the people wanted out.
653.714	So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.
657.737	And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects,
662.22	is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians,
665.493	and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data
668.407	because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
671.35	And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not
674.318	necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age,
678.19	is like a giant set of power tools
680.55	that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health,
684.425	while we use hand saws.
686.737	If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared
691.175	outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices,
693.923	and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start
696.699	to tease out the correlations between subtle variations
699.595	in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices,
704.906	and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.
707.392	Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system
710.486	that's waiting for data, but there isn't any.
715.058	So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is
718.946	the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed,
722.884	unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved
727.919	clinical research study where you contribute the data.
731.574	So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust,
733.78	if you reach into your body and grab your genome,
736.406	if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record,
739.453	you can actually go through an online informed consent process --
742.776	because the donation to the commons must be voluntary
745.422	and it must be informed -- and you can actually upload
748.215	your information and have it syndicated to the
750.807	mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research,
753.903	and the goal is to get 100,000 in the first year
756.759	and a million in the first five years so that we have
759.117	a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take
762.951	smaller sample sizes from traditional research
765.373	and map it against,
766.972	so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations
769.894	between the variations that make us unique
772.423	and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society.
776.447	And I've spent a lot of time around other commons.
779.471	I've been around the early web. I've been around
782.151	the early creative commons world, and there's four things
784.759	that all of these share, which is, they're all really simple.
788.113	And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study,
790.84	you're not going to see something complicated.
793.095	But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally,
798.144	right, because you can always add power and control to a system,
801.167	but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning,
805.131	and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic,
807.676	and being weak doesn't mean weakness.
809.86	Those are strengths in the system.
812.211	And open doesn't mean that there's no money.
814.876	Closed systems, corporations, make a lot of money
817.896	on the open web, and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives
821.435	is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness
824.262	of the system.
826.596	And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created,
830.39	so you can actually come in, all you have to be is 14 years old,
833.819	willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk,
835.846	basically, and you're in.
838.511	You can start analyzing the data.
840.084	You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well. (Laughter)
844.243	And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it,
847.824	that's okay too. That's all in the consent,
850.97	so if you don't like those terms, you don't come in.
853.534	It's very much the design principles of a commons
856.626	that we're trying to bring to health data.
859.22	And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes
862.199	a small number of really unreasonable people working together
865.378	to create them. It didn't take that many people
868.56	to make Wikipedia Wikipedia, or to keep it Wikipedia.
872.032	And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health,
874.1	"and so I hate this word ""patient."""
876.376	I don't like being patient when systems are broken,
879.543	and health care is broken.
882.17	I'm not talking about the politics of health care, I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care.
886.334	So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you
889.604	is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try,
892.65	when you go home, to get your data.
895.367	You'll be shocked and offended and, I would bet, outraged,
898.084	at how hard it is to get it.
900.96	But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take,
903.579	and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't.
906.04	If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick,
907.484	maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do,
910.477	or if you've been sick, then maybe you would.
912.684	And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months
915.772	that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there.
918.929	So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study
921.051	of 150,000 women in California, and they're going to
924.869	return all the data to the participants of the study
927.587	in a computable form, with one-clickability to load it into
930.733	the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly
933.349	how many people are willing to be unreasonable.
935.653	So what I'd end [with] is,
938.037	the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job
941.357	almost a year ago to do this, is that it really doesn't take
944.74	very many of us to achieve spectacular results.
948.548	You just have to be willing to be unreasonable,
951.26	and the risk we're running is not the risk those 14 men
953.591	who got yellow fever ran. Right?
955.459	It's to be naked, digitally, in public. So you know more
958.32	about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now.
961.753	And being naked and alone can be terrifying.
965.383	But to be naked in a group, voluntarily, can be quite beautiful.
969.85	And so it doesn't take all of us.
971.738	It just takes all of some of us. Thank you.
974.744	(Applause)
