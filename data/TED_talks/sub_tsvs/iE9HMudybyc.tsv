13.564	What you're doing,
15.335	right now, at this very moment,
18.139	is killing you.
20.159	More than cars or the Internet
22.914	or even that little mobile device we keep talking about,
25.683	the technology you're using the most almost every day
28.574	is this, your tush.
31.78	Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,
34.909	which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.
38.407	Sitting is so incredibly prevalent,
40.272	we don't even question how much we're doing it,
42.249	and because everyone else is doing it,
45.191	it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.
47.965	In that way, sitting has become
50.277	the smoking of our generation.
54.181	Of course there's health consequences to this,
56.609	scary ones, besides the waist.
59.39	Things like breast cancer and colon cancer
63.042	are directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],
66.331	Ten percent in fact, on both of those.
68.963	Six percent for heart disease,
70.483	seven percent for type 2 diabetes,
72.506	which is what my father died of.
75.286	Now, any of those stats should convince each of us
77.347	to get off our duff more,
78.966	but if you're anything like me, it won't.
81.736	What did get me moving was a social interaction.
84.964	Someone invited me to a meeting,
86.272	but couldn't manage to fit me in
87.445	to a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,
90.283	"""I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"""
94.108	It seemed kind of odd to do,
96.155	and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,
98.265	"""I have to be the one to ask the next question,"""
100.029	because I knew I was going to huff and puff
103.185	during this conversation.
105.369	And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.
108.499	So instead of going to coffee meetings
110.145	or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,
112.373	I ask people to go on a walking meeting,
115.403	to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.
119.342	It's changed my life.
121.771	But before that, what actually happened was,
125	I used to think about it as,
125.982	you could take care of your health,
127.678	or you could take care of obligations,
130.202	and one always came at the cost of the other.
134.007	So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,
137.139	I've learned a few things.
138.512	First, there's this amazing thing
140.386	about actually getting out of the box
143.111	that leads to out-of-the-box thinking.
145.085	Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.
149.51	And second, and probably the more reflective one,
152.53	is just about how much each of us
154.825	can hold problems in opposition
157.289	when they're really not that way.
159.264	And if we're going to solve problems
160.972	and look at the world really differently,
162.57	whether it's in governance or business
164.699	or environmental issues, job creation,
167.561	maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems
170.224	as having both things be true.
172.426	Because it was when that happened
174.349	with this walk-and-talk idea
175.804	that things became doable and sustainable and viable.
179.763	So I started this talk talking about the tush,
181.743	so I'll end with the bottom line, which is,
185.753	walk and talk.
187.384	Walk the talk.
188.667	You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,
192.335	and in the way that you do,
193.931	you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.
197.459	Thank you.
199.186	(Applause)
