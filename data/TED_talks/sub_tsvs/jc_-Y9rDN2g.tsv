12.797	I'd like you to come back with me for a moment
15.451	to the 19th century,
17.475	specifically to June 24, 1833.
21.923	The British Association for the Advancement of Science
24.978	is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge.
28.769	It's the first night of the meeting,
30.98	and a confrontation is about to take place
33.843	that will change science forever.
37.451	An elderly, white-haired man stands up.
40.428	The members of the Association are shocked to realize
43.89	that it's the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
46.914	who hadn't even left his house in years until that day.
51.874	They're even more shocked by what he says.
54.77	"""You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers."""
60.206	Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself
63.25	pondered the cosmos from their armchairs.
66.298	They were not mucking around in the fossil pits
68.754	or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles
72.118	like the members of the British Association.
75.09	The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly.
79.677	A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up
83.055	and quieted the audience.
85.271	He politely agreed that an appropriate name
88.098	for the members of the association did not exist.
91.914	"""If 'philosophers' is taken to be too wide and lofty a term,"""
97.458	"he said, ""then, by analogy with 'artist,'"
102.274	"we may form 'scientist.'"""
106.214	This was the first time the word scientist
108.843	was uttered in public,
110.697	only 179 years ago.
114.293	I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school,
117.438	and it kind of blew me away.
119.482	I mean, how could the word scientist
121.666	not have existed until 1833?
125.155	What were scientists called before?
127.346	What had changed to make a new name necessary
130.671	precisely at that moment?
133.801	Prior to this meeting, those who studied the natural world
136.895	were talented amateurs.
139.067	Think of the country clergyman or squire
141.355	collecting his beetles or fossils,
143.868	like Charles Darwin, for example,
146.163	or, the hired help of a nobleman, like Joseph Priestley,
150.339	who was the literary companion
152.695	to the Marquis of Lansdowne
154.855	when he discovered oxygen.
157.727	After this, they were scientists,
160.527	professionals with a particular scientific method,
164.361	goals, societies and funding.
168.096	Much of this revolution can be traced to four men
171.372	who met at Cambridge University in 1812:
174.631	Charles Babbage, John Herschel, Richard Jones and William Whewell.
179.186	These were brilliant, driven men
181.663	who accomplished amazing things.
184.935	Charles Babbage, I think known to most TEDsters,
187.934	invented the first mechanical calculator
190.729	and the first prototype of a modern computer.
194.752	John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere,
198.812	and, in his spare time, co-invented photography.
203.042	I'm sure we could all be that productive
205.19	without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time.
208.074	Richard Jones became an important economist
211.364	who later influenced Karl Marx.
213.891	And Whewell not only coined the term scientist,
217.413	as well as the words anode, cathode and ion,
221.448	but spearheaded international big science
224.484	with his global research on the tides.
227.58	In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813,
231.292	the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts.
235.055	They talked about science
236.815	and the need for a new scientific revolution.
239.937	They felt science had stagnated
241.828	since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened
245.08	in the 17th century.
247.318	It was time for a new revolution,
249.384	which they pledged to bring about,
251.508	and what's so amazing about these guys is,
254.229	not only did they have these
256.012	grandiose undergraduate dreams,
258.605	but they actually carried them out,
260.845	even beyond their wildest dreams.
263.893	And I'm going to tell you today
264.985	about four major changes to science these men made.
269.942	About 200 years before,
272.365	Francis Bacon and then, later, Isaac Newton,
275.093	had proposed an inductive scientific method.
278.805	Now that's a method that starts from
281.342	observations and experiments
283.797	and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws,
287.269	which are always subject to revision or rejection
289.753	should new evidence arise.
292.298	However, in 1809, David Ricardo muddied the waters
297.681	by arguing that the science of economics
300.63	should use a different, deductive method.
303.779	The problem was that an influential group at Oxford
307.458	began arguing that because it worked so well in economics,
311.539	this deductive method ought to be applied
314.209	to the natural sciences too.
316.883	The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed.
320.539	They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method
323.821	in all the sciences
325.453	that were widely read by natural philosophers,
328.311	university students and members of the public.
331.733	Reading one of Herschel's books
333.489	was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin
336.279	"that he would later say, ""Scarcely anything in my life"
340.076	made so deep an impression on me.
342.663	It made me wish to add my might
345.271	"to the accumulated store of natural knowledge."""
348.799	It also shaped Darwin's scientific method,
351.911	as well as that used by his peers.
355.77	[Science for the public good]
357.548	Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge
360.142	ought to be used for the good of the king or queen,
362.775	or for one's own personal gain.
365.688	For example, ship captains needed to know
368.391	information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
372.578	Harbormasters would gather this knowledge
374.771	and sell it to the ship captains.
377.787	The philosophical breakfast club changed that,
380.395	working together.
381.745	Whewell's worldwide study of the tides
383.825	resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps
386.963	that freely provided the harbormasters' knowledge
389.95	to all ship captains.
392.051	Herschel helped by making tidal observations
394.853	off the coast of South Africa,
396.821	and, as he complained to Whewell,
399.171	he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble.
404.323	The four men really helped each other in every way.
407.051	They also relentlessly lobbied the British government
410.363	for the money to build Babbage's engines
412.999	because they believed these engines
414.99	would have a huge practical impact on society.
418.824	In the days before pocket calculators,
421.444	the numbers that most professionals needed --
424.78	bankers, insurance agents, ship captains, engineers â€”
428.388	were to be found in lookup books like this,
431.472	filled with tables of figures.
433.868	These tables were calculated
436.276	using a fixed procedure over and over
439.195	by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers,
443.864	but these calculations were really difficult.
446.743	I mean, this nautical almanac
448.991	published the lunar differences for every month of the year.
452.861	Each month required 1,365 calculations,
457.527	so these tables were filled with mistakes.
460.511	Babbage's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator
464.676	devised to accurately compute any of these tables.
468.655	Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years
472.191	by a team from the Science Museum of London
474.951	using his own plans.
476.634	This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California,
480.772	and it calculates accurately. It actually works.
484.479	Later, Babbage's analytical engine
487.094	was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense.
491.379	It had a separate memory and central processor.
494.333	It was capable of iteration, conditional branching
497.786	and parallel processing,
499.258	and it was programmable using punched cards,
502.23	an idea Babbage took from Jacquard's loom.
505.702	Tragically, Babbage's engines never were built in his day
509.938	because most people thought that
512.125	non-human computers would have no usefulness
515.02	for the public.
516.602	[New scientific institutions]
518.614	Founded in Bacon's time, the Royal Society of London
522.119	was the foremost scientific society in England
525.116	and even in the rest of the world.
527.357	By the 19th century, it had become
529.822	a kind of gentleman's club
531.655	populated mainly by antiquarians, literary men and the nobility.
536.662	The members of the philosophical breakfast club
538.815	helped form a number of new scientific societies,
541.829	including the British Association.
544.229	These new societies required
546.612	that members be active researchers publishing their results.
550.102	They reinstated the tradition of the Q&amp;A
552.942	after scientific papers were read,
555.212	which had been discontinued by the Royal Society
557.532	as being ungentlemanly.
560.437	And for the first time, they gave women a foot in the door of science.
565.333	Members were encouraged to bring their wives,
567.993	daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association,
571.919	and while the women were expected to attend
574.689	only the public lectures and the social events like this one,
578.53	they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well.
582.639	The British Association would later be the first
585.523	of the major national science organizations in the world
589.167	to admit women as full members.
591.872	[External funding for science]
593.313	Up to the 19th century,
594.708	natural philosophers were expected to pay
597.02	for their own equipment and supplies.
599.333	Occasionally, there were prizes,
601.796	such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century,
605.125	for solving the so-called longitude problem,
608.208	but prizes were only given after the fact,
611.053	when they were given at all.
612.837	On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club,
615.741	the British Association began to use the extra money
619.052	generated by its meetings to give grants
621.726	for research in astronomy, the tides, fossil fish,
624.948	shipbuilding, and many other areas.
627.775	These grants not only allowed
629.55	less wealthy men to conduct research,
631.893	but they also encouraged thinking outside the box,
634.829	rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question.
638.902	Eventually, the Royal Society
641.301	and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit,
644.71	and this has become -- fortunately it's become --
647.574	a major part of the scientific landscape today.
652.324	So the philosophical breakfast club
655.338	helped invent the modern scientist.
658.485	That's the heroic part of their story.
661.713	There's a flip side as well.
664.652	They did not foresee at least one consequence
667.636	of their revolution.
670.172	They would have been deeply dismayed
672.548	by today's disjunction between science and the rest of culture.
677.032	It's shocking to realize
679.689	that only 28 percent of American adults
683.029	have even a very basic level of science literacy,
686.58	and this was tested by asking simple questions like,
689.651	"""Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time?"""
693.46	"and ""What proportion of the Earth is covered in water?"""
698.222	Once scientists became members of a professional group,
702.215	they were slowly walled off from the rest of us.
705.58	This is the unintended consequence of the revolution
709.507	that started with our four friends.
712.542	Charles Darwin said,
714.335	"""I sometimes think that general and popular treatises"
718.42	are almost as important for the progress of science
721.189	"as original work."""
722.776	"In fact, ""Origin of Species"" was written"
725.89	for a general and popular audience,
727.999	and was widely read when it first appeared.
731.892	Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten,
735.903	that science is not only for scientists.
740.322	Thank you.
741.943	(Applause)
