16.069	I'm going to talk to you today
17.554	about the design of medical technology
17.554	for low-resource settings.
21.061	I study health systems in these countries.
23.438	And one of the major gaps in care,
25.377	almost across the board,
27.06	is access to safe surgery.
29.251	Now one of the major
29.251	bottlenecks that we've found
31.934	that's sort of preventing
31.934	both the access in the first place,
35.193	and the safety of those surgeries
35.193	that do happen, is anesthesia.
39.106	And actually, it's the model
39.106	that we expect to work
41.522	for delivering anesthesia
41.522	in these environments.
44.88	Here, we have a scene that you would find
44.88	in any operating room across the US,
48.757	or any other developed country.
50.258	In the background there
51.469	is a very sophisticated
51.469	anesthesia machine.
54.064	And this machine is able
54.064	to enable surgery and save lives
57.937	because it was designed
57.937	with this environment in mind.
61.589	In order to operate,
61.589	this machine needs a number of things
64.545	that this hospital has to offer.
66.469	It needs an extremely
66.469	well-trained anesthesiologist
69.861	with years of training
69.861	with complex machines
72.336	to help her monitor the flows of the gas
74.781	and keep her patients
74.781	safe and anesthetized
77.368	throughout the surgery.
78.843	It's a delicate machine
78.843	running on computer algorithms,
81.634	and it needs special care, TLC,
81.634	to keep it up and running,
84.876	and it's going to break pretty easily.
86.758	And when it does, it needs
86.758	a team of biomedical engineers
89.694	who understand its complexities,
89.694	can fix it, can source the parts
93.027	and keep it saving lives.
95.948	It's a pretty expensive machine.
97.506	It needs a hospital
97.506	whose budget can allow it
100.171	to support one machine
100.171	costing upwards of 50 or $100,000.
105.556	And perhaps most obviously,
107.479	but also most importantly --
109.017	and the path to concepts
109.017	that we've heard about
111.877	kind of illustrates this --
113.187	it needs infrastructure that can supply
113.187	an uninterrupted source of electricity,
118.357	of compressed oxygen,
118.357	and other medical supplies
121.393	that are so critical
121.393	to the functioning of this machine.
125.695	In other words, this machine
125.695	requires a lot of stuff
129.018	that this hospital cannot offer.
131.592	This is the electrical supply
131.592	for a hospital in rural Malawi.
135.413	In this hospital,
136.598	there is one person qualified
136.598	to deliver anesthesia,
139.293	and she's qualified
140.469	because she has 12, maybe 18 months
140.469	of training in anesthesia.
145.069	In the hospital and in the entire region
147.34	there's not a single biomedical engineer.
149.371	So when this machine breaks,
150.964	the machines that they have
150.964	to work with break,
153.197	they've got to try and figure it out,
154.99	but most of the time,
154.99	that's the end of the road.
157.306	Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.
159.547	And the price tag
159.547	of the machine that I mentioned
161.9	could represent maybe a quarter or a third
163.985	of the annual operating budget
163.985	for this hospital.
167.84	And finally, I think you can see
167.84	that infrastructure is not very strong.
171.248	This hospital is connected
171.248	to a very weak power grid,
173.946	one that goes down frequently.
175.752	So it runs frequently,
175.752	the entire hospital,
178.322	just on a generator.
179.769	And you can imagine,
179.769	the generator breaks down
181.949	or runs out of fuel.
183.621	And the World Bank sees this
185.672	and estimates that a hospital
185.672	in this setting in a low-income country
189.227	can expect up to
193.918	Similarly, compressed oxygen
193.918	and other medical supplies
197.135	are really a luxury,
198.341	and can often be out of stock
198.341	for months or even a year.
201.647	So it seems crazy, but the model
201.647	that we have right now
204.835	is taking those machines
204.835	that were designed
207.064	for that first environment
207.064	that I showed you
209.371	and donating or selling them
209.371	to hospitals in this environment.
214.121	It's not just inappropriate,
215.721	it becomes really unsafe.
218.776	One of our partners at Johns Hopkins
220.722	was observing surgeries in Sierra Leone
220.722	about a year ago.
225.485	And the first surgery of the day
225.485	happened to be an obstetrical case.
228.842	A woman came in,
228.842	she needed an emergency C-section
231.849	to save her life and the life of her baby.
235.065	And everything began pretty auspiciously.
237.043	The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.
239.32	The nurse was there.
240.632	She was able to anesthetize her quickly,
240.632	and it was important
243.517	because of the emergency
243.517	nature of the situation.
245.877	And everything began well
247.618	until the power went out.
251.033	And now in the middle of this surgery,
252.881	the surgeon is racing
252.881	against the clock to finish his case,
255.974	which he can do -- he's got a headlamp.
258.35	But the nurse is literally running
258.35	around a darkened operating theater
262.435	trying to find anything
262.435	she can use to anesthetize her patient,
265.414	to keep her patient asleep.
267.127	Because her machine doesn't work
267.127	when there's no power.
270.697	This routine surgery that many of you
270.697	have probably experienced,
273.775	and others are probably the product of,
273.775	has now become a tragedy.
278.915	And what's so frustrating
278.915	is this is not a singular event;
281.675	this happens across the developing world.
	are attempted every year
287.175	without safe anesthesia.
289.47	My colleague, Dr. Paul Fenton,
289.47	was living this reality.
292.406	He was the chief of anesthesiology
294.26	in a hospital in Malawi,
294.26	a teaching hospital.
297.288	He went to work every day
298.806	in an operating theater like this one,
300.798	trying to deliver anesthesia
300.798	and teach others how to do so
303.961	using that same equipment
305.26	that became so unreliable,
305.26	and frankly unsafe, in his hospital.
310.299	And after umpteen surgeries
312.103	and, you can imagine,
312.103	really unspeakable tragedy,
314.695	"he just said, ""That's it."
314.695	I'm done. That's enough.
317.061	"There has to be something better."""
319.489	He took a walk down the hall
321.06	to where they threw all those machines
321.06	that had just crapped out on them,
324.515	I think that's the scientific term,
326.216	and he started tinkering.
327.582	He took one part from here
327.582	and another from there,
329.959	and he tried to come up
329.959	with a machine that would work
332.565	in the reality that he was facing.
334.217	And what he came up with:
335.455	was this guy.
336.802	The prototype for the Universal
336.802	Anesthesia Machine --
340.363	a machine that would work
340.363	and anesthetize his patients
343.684	no matter the circumstances
343.684	that his hospital had to offer.
347.779	Here it is, back at home
349.284	at that same hospital, developed
349.284	a little further, 12 years later,
352.737	working on patients
352.737	from pediatrics to geriatrics.
356.397	Let me show you a little bit
356.397	about how this machine works.
359.191	Voila!
361.712	Here she is.
362.943	When you have electricity,
364.211	everything in this machine
364.211	begins in the base.
367.253	There's a built-in
367.253	oxygen concentrator down there.
369.874	Now you've heard me mention
369.874	oxygen a few times at this point.
373.027	Essentially, to deliver anesthesia,
373.027	you want as pure oxygen as possible,
376.839	because eventually you're going
376.839	to dilute it, essentially, with the gas.
380.286	And the mixture that the patient inhales
382.746	needs to be at least
382.746	a certain percentage oxygen
385.081	or else it can become dangerous.
386.791	But so in here when there's electricity,
388.733	the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
391.632	Now we know room air is gloriously free,
394.935	it is abundant,
396.26	and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
398.696	So all this concentrator does
398.696	is take that room air in, filter it
402.397	and send 95 percent pure oxygen
402.397	up and across here,
406.241	where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
409.003	Now before that mixture
409.003	hits the patient's lungs,
412.651	it's going to pass by here --
412.651	you can't see it,
414.889	but there's an oxygen sensor here --
416.695	that's going to read out on this screen
416.695	the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
421.544	Now if you don't have power,
423.542	or, God forbid, the power cuts out
423.542	in the middle of a surgery,
427.172	this machine transitions automatically,
429.54	without even having to touch it,
431.313	to drawing in room air from this inlet.
434.065	Everything else is the same.
435.425	The only difference is that now
437.045	you're only working
437.045	with 21 percent oxygen.
440.666	Now that used to be
440.666	a dangerous guessing game,
443.511	because you only knew
443.511	if you gave too little oxygen
445.921	once something bad happened.
447.321	But we've put a long-life
447.321	battery backup on here.
450.058	This is the only part
450.058	that's battery backed up.
452.276	But this gives control to the provider,
452.276	whether there's power or not,
455.705	because they can adjust the flows
457.322	based on the percentage of oxygen
457.322	they see that they're giving the patient.
461.314	In both cases,
461.314	whether you have power or not,
464.683	sometimes the patient
464.683	needs help breathing.
466.747	It's just a reality of anesthesia,
466.747	the lungs can be paralyzed.
469.972	And so we've just added
469.972	this manual bellows.
472.08	We've seen surgeries
472.08	for three or four hours
475.095	to ventilate the patient on this.
477.684	So it's a straightforward machine.
480.696	I shudder to say simple;
480.696	it's straightforward.
484.196	And it's by design.
486.121	You do not need to be a highly trained,
486.121	specialized anesthesiologist
491.345	to use this machine,
492.54	which is good because,
492.54	in these rural district hospitals,
495.316	you're not going to get
495.316	that level of training.
497.935	It's also designed for the environment
497.935	that it will be used in.
501.087	This is an incredibly rugged machine.
502.888	It has to stand up to the heat
502.888	and the wear and tear
506.367	that happens in hospitals
506.367	in these rural districts.
509.509	And so it's not going
509.509	to break very easily,
511.928	but if it does, virtually
511.928	every piece in this machine
515.226	can be swapped out and replaced
517.26	with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
521.01	And finally, it's affordable.
523.294	This machine comes in
523.294	at an eighth of the cost
526.971	of the conventional machine
526.971	that I showed you earlier.
530.073	So in other words, what we have here
530.073	is a machine that can enable surgery
534.585	and save lives,
535.781	because it was designed
535.781	for its environment,
538.795	just like the first machine I showed you.
541.237	But we're not content to stop there.
543.265	Is it working?
544.464	Is this the design
544.464	that's going to work in place?
547.07	Well, we've seen good results so far.
548.861	This is in 13 hospitals in four countries,
552.27	and since 2010, we've done
552.27	well over 2,000 surgeries
556.227	with no clinically adverse events.
558.8	So we're thrilled.
559.991	This really seems like
559.991	a cost-effective, scalable solution
564.437	to a problem that's really pervasive.
566.958	But we still want to be sure
568.582	that this is the most effective
568.582	and safe device
571.023	that we can be putting into hospitals.
573.104	So to do that, we've launched
573.104	a number of partnerships
575.652	with NGOs and universities,
577.162	to gather data on the user interface,
579.835	on the types of surgeries
579.835	it's appropriate for,
582.051	and ways we can enhance the device itself.
584.462	One of those partnerships
584.462	is with Johns Hopkins
587.14	just here in Baltimore.
588.537	They have a really cool anesthesia
588.537	simulation lab out in Baltimore.
592.839	So we're taking this machine
594.744	and recreating some
594.744	of the operating theater crises
598.342	that this machine might face
599.873	in one of the hospitals
599.873	that it's intended for,
602.26	and in a contained, safe environment,
604.408	evaluating its effectiveness.
606.607	We're then able to compare
606.607	the results from that study
610.263	with real-world experience,
611.707	because we're putting
611.707	two of these in hospitals
613.928	that Johns Hopkins
613.928	works with in Sierra Leone,
616.103	including the hospital
616.103	where that emergency C-section happened.
620.645	So I've talked a lot about anesthesia,
620.645	and I tend to do that.
623.797	I think it is incredibly fascinating
623.797	and an important component of health.
627.913	And it really seems peripheral,
627.913	we never think about it,
630.568	until we don't have access to it,
632.796	and then it becomes a gatekeeper.
634.782	Who gets surgery and who doesn't?
637.084	Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?
640.476	But you know,
640.476	it's just one of so many ways
642.963	that design, appropriate design,
646.094	can have an impact on health outcomes.
648.578	If more people
648.578	in the health-delivery space
650.721	really working on some of these
650.721	challenges in low-income countries
654.314	could start their design process,
654.314	their solution search,
657.991	from outside of that proverbial box
659.953	and inside of the hospital --
661.915	In other words, if we could design
663.77	for the environment that exists
663.77	in so many parts of the world,
666.985	rather than the one
666.985	that we wished existed --
669.418	we might just save a lot of lives.
672.047	Thank you very much.
673.539	(Applause)
