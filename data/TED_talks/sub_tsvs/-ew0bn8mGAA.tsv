15.96	The problem I want to talk with you
15.96	about is really the problem of:
20.96	How does one supply health care
20.96	in a world in which cost is everything?
28.274	How do you do that?
30.459	And the basic paradigm
30.459	we want to suggest to you,
32.818	I want to suggest to you,
34.067	is one in which you say
34.067	that in order to treat disease,
37.763	you have to first know
37.763	what you're treating, that's diagnostics,
41.159	and then you have to do something.
42.83	The program we're involved in is something
42.83	"we call ""Diagnostics for All,"""
47.17	"or ""zero-cost diagnostics."""
49.305	How do you provide medically
49.305	relevant information
52.743	at as close as possible to zero cost?
55.391	How do you do it?
56.645	Let me just give you two examples.
58.967	The rigors of military medicine are not
58.967	so dissimilar from the third world:
64.857	poor resources, a rigorous environment --
64.857	a series of problems --
69.233	light weight and things of this kind.
71.238	And also they're not so different
71.238	from the home health care
74.696	and diagnostic system world.
77.125	So, the technology I want to talk
77.125	about is for the third world,
81.997	for the developing world,
83.419	but it has, I think,
83.419	much broader application,
85.984	because information is so important
85.984	in the health care system.
90.301	So you see two examples here.
92.119	One is a lab that is actually
92.119	a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.
97.892	The second is basically an entrepreneur
97.892	who is set up and doing who-knows-what
102.22	at a table in a market.
103.691	I don't know what kind
103.691	of health care is delivered there.
106.662	But it's not really
106.662	what is probably most efficient.
111.601	What is our approach?
114.702	The way in which one typically
114.702	approaches a problem of lowering cost,
120.251	starting from the perspective
120.251	of the United States,
123.138	is to take our solution,
125.305	and then try to cut cost out of it.
128.023	No matter how you do that,
129.46	you're not going to start
129.46	with a $100,000 instrument
131.99	and bring it down to no cost.
133.435	It isn't going to work.
134.632	So the approach we took
134.632	was the other way around, to ask:
137.515	What is the cheapest possible stuff
140.004	that you could make
140.004	a diagnostic system out of,
142.964	and get useful information
142.964	and add function?
145.535	And what we've chosen is paper.
147.556	What you see here is a prototypic device.
150.604	It's about a centimeter on the side.
152.46	It's about the size of a fingernail.
154.461	The lines around the edges are a polymer.
158.088	It's made of paper.
159.954	And paper, of course, wicks fluid,
159.954	as you know, paper, cloth --
164.663	drop wine on the tablecloth,
166.563	and the wine wicks all over everything.
169.324	Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.
171.387	That's what a hydrophilic surface does.
174.15	So in this device, the idea
174.15	is that you drip the bottom end of it
177.797	in a drop of, in this case, urine.
180.46	The fluid wicks its way
180.46	into those chambers at the top.
184.232	The brown color indicates
184.232	the amount of glucose in the urine,
188.46	the blue color indicates the amount
188.46	of protein in the urine.
192.031	And the combination of those two
192.031	is a first-order shot
195.091	at a number of useful things
195.091	that you want.
198.237	So, this is an example of a device
198.237	made from a simple piece of paper.
201.618	Now, how simple can you make
201.618	the production?
204.46	Why do we choose paper?
206.719	There's an example
206.719	of the same thing on a finger,
209.653	showing you basically what it looks like.
211.933	One reason for using paper
211.933	is that it's everywhere.
214.385	We have made these kinds of devices
214.385	using napkins and toilet paper
219.582	and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.
221.836	So the production capability is there.
224.298	The second is, you can put lots and lots
224.298	of tests in a very small place.
228.619	I'll show you in a moment
228.619	that the stack of paper there
231.462	would probably hold
231.462	something like 100,000 tests,
234.218	something of that kind.
235.983	And then finally, a point
235.983	you don't think of so much
238.852	in developed world medicine:
241.46	it eliminates sharps.
243.163	And what sharps means
243.163	is needles, things that stick.
246.569	If you've taken a sample
246.569	of someone's blood
248.887	and the someone might have hepatitis C,
251.408	you don't want to make a mistake
251.408	and stick it in you.
253.979	You don't want to do that.
255.3	So how do you dispose of that?
256.813	It's a problem everywhere,
256.813	and here, you simply burn it.
259.519	So it's a sort of a practical approach
259.519	to starting on things.
264.677	"Now, you say, ""If paper is a good idea,"
268.357	"other people have surely thought of it."""
270.344	And the answer is, of course, yes.
272.25	Those half of you, roughly, who are women,
276.094	at some point may have had
276.094	a pregnancy test.
278.58	And the most common of these
278.58	is in a device
282.588	that looks like the thing on the left.
284.46	It's something called
284.46	a lateral-flow immunoassay.
286.976	In that particular test,
288.46	urine, either containing
288.46	a hormone called hCG,
292.099	does or does not flow
292.099	across a piece of paper.
295.46	And there are two bars; one bar
295.46	indicates that the test is working,
299.385	and if the second bar shows up,
299.385	you're pregnant.
302.574	This is a terrific kind of test
302.574	in a binary world,
305.769	and the nice thing about pregnancy
305.769	is either you are pregnant
308.708	or you're not pregnant;
309.886	you're not partially pregnant
309.886	or thinking about being pregnant
312.891	or something of that sort.
314.199	So it works very well there,
314.199	but it doesn't work very well
316.958	when you need more
316.958	quantitative information.
319.068	There are also dipsticks,
320.312	but if you look at the dipsticks,
322.082	they're for another kind
322.082	of urine analysis.
324.319	There are an awful lot of colors
324.319	and things like that.
327.22	What do you actually do about that
327.22	in a difficult circumstance?
331.632	So the approach we started with is to ask:
335.965	Is it really practical
335.965	to make things of this sort?
339.46	And that problem is now,
339.46	in a purely engineering way, solved.
343.771	And the procedure that we have
343.771	is simply to start with paper.
347.344	You run it through a new kind
347.344	of printer called a wax printer.
350.914	The wax printer does
350.914	what looks like printing.
353.57	It is printing.
354.752	You put that on, you warm it a little bit,
356.816	the wax prints through,
356.816	so it absorbs into the paper,
359.883	and you end up with the device you want.
362.051	The printers cost 800 bucks now.
365.154	We estimate that if you were
365.154	to run them 24 hours a day,
369.066	they'd make about 10 million tests a year.
371.198	So it's a solved problem.
371.198	That particular problem is solved.
374.446	And there is an example
374.446	of the kind of thing that you see.
377.246	That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.
379.109	That takes about two seconds to make.
381.402	And so I regard that as done.
384.068	There's a very important issue here,
385.886	which is that because it's a printer,
385.886	a color printer, it prints colors.
390.328	That's what color printers do.
391.876	I'll show you in a moment,
391.876	that's actually quite useful.
395.911	Now, the next question
395.911	that you would like to ask is:
398.46	What would you like to measure?
398.46	What would you like to analyze?
401.675	And the thing you'd most like to analyze,
401.675	we're a fair distance from.
406.46	It's what's called
406.46	"""fever of undiagnosed origin."""
410.46	Someone comes into the clinic,
410.46	they have a fever, they feel bad.
414.045	What do they have?
415.235	Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS?
415.235	Do they have a common cold?
418.661	The triage problem.
419.899	That's a hard problem for reasons
419.899	I won't go through.
422.579	There are an awful lot of things
422.579	that you'd like to distinguish among.
426.145	But then there are a series of things --
428.371	AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --
431.979	and simpler ones,
431.979	such as guidance of treatment.
435.498	Now, even that's more
435.498	complicated than you think.
438.46	A friend of mine works
438.46	in transcultural psychiatry,
442.699	and he is interested in the question
444.829	of why people do
444.829	and don't take their meds.
447.583	So Dapsone, or something like that,
447.583	you have to take for a while.
451.182	He has a wonderful story
451.182	of talking to a villager in India
454.822	and saying,
455.997	"""Have you taken your Dapsone?"" ""Yes."""
457.827	"""Have you taken it every day?"" ""Yes."""
459.717	"""Have you taken if for a month?"" ""Yes."""
461.695	What the guy actually meant
463.22	was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone
463.22	to his dog that morning.
467.146	(Laughter)
468.295	And he was telling the truth,
468.295	because in a different culture,
472.075	the dog is a surrogate for you;
474.673	"""today,"" ""this month,"""
474.673	"""since the rainy season"" --"
477.84	there are lots of opportunities
477.84	for misunderstanding.
480.348	(Laughter)
481.379	And so an issue here is to,
481.379	in some cases, figure out
484.967	how to deal with matters
484.967	that seem uninteresting, like compliance.
490.42	Now, take a look
490.42	at what a typical test looks like.
494.679	Prick a finger, you get some blood --
494.679	about 50 microliters.
498.46	That's about all you're going to get,
500.315	because you can't use
500.315	the usual sort of systems.
504.845	You can't manipulate it very well;
506.543	I'll show something
506.543	about that in a moment.
508.683	So you take the drop of blood,
508.683	no further manipulations,
511.46	you put it on a little device,
513.267	the device filters out the blood cells,
513.267	lets the serum go through,
517.964	and you get a series of colors
517.964	down in the bottom there.
521.749	And the colors indicate
521.749	"""disease"" or ""normal."""
525.932	But even that's complicated,
527.638	because to me, colors
527.638	"might indicate ""normal,"""
531.263	but after all, we're all suffering
531.263	from probably an excess of education.
536.247	What do you do about something
536.247	which requires quantitative analysis?
540.858	And so the solution
540.858	that we and many other people
543.564	are thinking about there,
545.199	and at this point,
545.199	there is a dramatic flourish,
547.812	and out comes the universal solution
547.812	to everything these days,
551.008	which is a cell phone --
552.189	in this particular case, a camera phone.
554.211	They're everywhere --
554.211	six billion a month in India.
558.46	And the idea is that what one does
558.46	is to take the device,
564.006	you dip it, you develop the color,
566.46	you take a picture,
566.46	the picture goes to a central laboratory.
569.709	You don't have to send out a doctor,
571.46	you send out somebody
571.46	who can just take the sample,
574.225	and in the clinic either a doctor,
574.225	or ideally, a computer in this case,
577.974	does the analysis.
579.162	Turns out to work actually quite well,
581.037	particularly when your color printer
581.037	has printed the color bars
584.153	that indicate how things work.
585.998	So my view of the health care
585.998	worker of the future
589.046	is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,
591.637	otherwise unemployed, who has two things:
594.413	a backpack full
594.413	of these tests and a lancet
596.52	to occasionally take a blood sample,
598.46	and an AK-47.
600.043	And these are the things
600.043	that get him through his day.
602.663	(Laughter)
605.372	There's another very
605.372	interesting connection here,
607.731	and that is, that what one wants to do
607.731	is pass through useful information
613.295	over what is generally
613.295	a pretty awful telephone system.
616.85	It turns out there's an enormous
616.85	amount of information
619.46	already available on that subject,
619.46	which is the Mars Rover problem.
622.863	How do you get back an accurate view
622.863	of the color on Mars
626.754	if you have a really terrible
626.754	bandwidth to do it with?
630.564	And the answer is not complicated,
632.46	but it's one which I don't want
632.46	to go through here,
635.025	other than to say that the communication
635.025	systems for doing this
638.093	are really pretty well understood.
639.818	Also, a fact which you may not know
642.579	is that the compute capability
642.579	of this thing is not so different
646.337	from the compute capability
646.337	of your desktop computer.
649.2	This is a fantastic device
649.2	which is only beginning to be tapped.
652.885	I don't know whether the idea
652.885	of one computer, one child
656.355	makes any sense.
657.53	Here's the computer of the future,
659.46	because this screen is already there
659.46	and they're ubiquitous.
664.111	All right, let me show you just
664.111	a little bit about advanced devices.
667.372	And we'll start by posing
667.372	a little problem.
669.55	What you see here
669.55	is another centimeter-sized device,
672.971	and the different colors
672.971	are different colors of dye.
676.978	And you notice something
678.18	which might strike you
678.18	as a little bit interesting,
680.903	which is, the yellow seems to disappear,
683.784	get through the blue,
683.784	and then get through the red.
686.297	How does that happen?
687.474	How do you make something
687.474	flow through something?
690.073	"And, of course the answer is, ""You don't."""
692.292	You make it flow under and over.
694.059	But now the question is:
695.244	How do you make it flow
695.244	under and over in a piece of paper?
698.81	The answer is that what you do --
701.78	and the details are not
701.78	terribly important here --
704.46	is to make something more elaborate:
706.375	You take several different
706.375	layers of paper,
708.476	each one containing
708.476	its own little fluid system,
711.571	and you separate them by pieces of,
711.571	literally, double-sided carpet tape,
716.184	the stuff you use to stick
716.184	the carpets onto the floor.
719.094	And the fluid will flow
719.094	from one layer into the next.
722.344	It distributes itself,
722.344	flows through further holes,
725.46	distributes itself.
727.073	And what you see,
727.073	at the lower right-hand side there,
730.338	is a sample in which a single sample
730.338	of blood has been put on the top,
735.661	and it has gone through
735.661	and distributed itself
738.195	into these 16 holes on the bottom,
741.565	in a piece of paper --
741.565	basically, it looks like a chip,
744.293	two pieces of paper thick.
746.055	And in this particular case,
747.562	we were just interested
747.562	in the replicability of that.
750.35	But that is, in principle,
750.35	the way you solve
752.678	"the ""fever of unexplained origin"" problem,"
754.858	because each one of those spots
754.858	then becomes a test
757.638	for a particular set
757.638	of markers of disease,
761.261	and this will work in due course.
763.551	Here is an example of a slightly
763.551	more complicated device.
766.891	There's the chip.
768.097	You dip in a corner.
769.337	The fluid goes into the center.
770.908	It distributes itself out
770.908	into these various wells or holes
774.715	and turns color,
775.975	all done with paper and carpet tape.
778.692	So it's, I think, as low-cost
780.873	as we're likely to be able
780.873	to come up and make things.
784.692	Now, I have two last
784.692	little stories to tell you
788.012	in finishing off this business.
790.646	This is one:
791.835	One of the things
791.835	you occasionally need to do
794.3	is separate blood cells from serum.
798.134	And the question was,
799.843	here we do it by taking a sample,
801.968	we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,
805.854	and you get blood cells out.
808.345	Terrific.
809.528	What happens if you don't have
809.528	electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?
812.999	And we thought for a while
812.999	of how you might do this,
815.539	and the way, in fact, you do it,
815.539	is what's shown here.
818.2	You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere,
818.2	and you saw off a blade,
822.831	and then you take tubing,
822.831	and you stick it on that.
825.338	You put the blood in,
825.338	somebody sits there and spins it.
828.102	It works really, really well.
830.245	And we sat down,
830.245	we did the physics of eggbeaters
832.683	and self-aligning tubes
832.683	and all the rest of that kind of thing,
835.784	and sent it off to a journal.
837.27	We were very proud of this,
838.616	particularly the title,
838.616	"which was ""Eggbeater as Centrifuge."""
841.502	(Laughter)
842.6	And we sent it off,
843.775	and by return mail, it came back.
845.706	I called up the editor and I said,
847.46	"""What's going on? How is this possible?"""
849.606	The editor said, with enormous disdain,
852.764	"""I read this."
854.231	And we're not going to publish it,
854.231	"because we only publish science."""
858.011	(Laughter)
859.448	And it's an important issue,
860.941	because it means
860.941	that we have to, as a society,
864.363	think about what we value.
866.364	And if it's just papers
866.364	and Phys. Rev. letters,
869.172	we've got a problem.
871.078	Here is another example
871.078	of something which is --
874.332	this is a little spectrophotometer.
876.397	It measures the absorption
876.397	of light in a sample.
879.711	The neat thing about this is,
881.214	you have a light source that flickers
881.214	on and off at about 1,000 hertz,
884.929	another light source
884.929	that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,
888.622	and so you can run this system
888.622	in broad daylight.
891.46	It performs about equivalently
893.553	to a system that's on the order
893.553	of 100,000 dollars.
898.146	It costs 50 dollars.
899.331	We can probably make it for 50 cents
899.331	if we put our mind to it.
903.46	Why doesn't somebody do it?
905.357	The answer is:
906.532	How do you make a profit
906.532	in a capitalist system, doing that?
909.826	Interesting problem.
912.575	So, let me finish by saying
912.575	that we've thought about this
917.552	as a kind of engineering problem.
919.778	And we've asked: What
919.778	is the scientific unifying idea here?
924.184	And we've decided
924.184	we should think about this
926.332	not so much in terms of cost,
926.332	but in terms of simplicity.
929.46	Simplicity is a neat word.
931.062	You've got to think
931.062	about what simplicity means.
934.015	I know what it is,
935.195	but I don't actually know what it means.
937.396	So I actually was interested
937.396	enough in this
939.517	to put together several groups of people.
943.904	The most recent involved
943.904	a couple of people at MIT,
946.46	one of them being
946.46	an exceptionally bright kid
948.604	who is one of the very
948.604	few people I would think of
951.338	who's an authentic genius.
952.751	We all struggled for an entire day
952.751	to think about simplicity.
956.825	And I want to give you the answer
956.825	of this deep scientific thought.
961.031	[What is simplicity?
962.388	"""It's impossible to f..k it up""]"
963.999	(Laughter)
965.072	So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.
967.546	Thank you very much.
969.079	(Applause)
