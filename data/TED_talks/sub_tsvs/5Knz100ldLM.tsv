15.894	How often do we hear
15.894	that people just don't care?
20.218	How many times have you been told
21.833	that real, substantial change
21.833	isn't possible
25.098	because most people are too selfish,
27.197	too stupid or too lazy
29.153	to try to make a difference
29.153	in their community?
31.809	I propose to you today
31.809	that apathy as we think we know it
34.927	doesn't actually exist;
36.662	but rather, that people do care,
38.86	but that we live in a world
38.86	that actively discourages engagement
42.593	by constantly putting obstacles
42.593	and barriers in our way.
45.978	I'll give you some
45.978	examples of what I mean.
48.034	Let's start with city hall.
50.123	You ever see one of these before?
52.218	This is a newspaper ad.
53.86	It's a notice of a zoning application
53.86	change for a new office building
57.252	so the neighborhood
57.252	knows what's happening.
59.347	As you can see, it's impossible to read.
61.293	You need to get halfway down
62.693	to even find out which address
62.693	they're talking about,
65.251	and then further down,
65.251	in tiny 10-point font,
67.419	to find out how to actually get involved.
69.479	Imagine if the private sector
69.479	advertised in the same way --
72.63	if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes --
74.696	(Laughter)
75.86	And put an ad in the paper like that.
77.849	(Applause)
81.86	Now, that would never happen.
84.695	You'll never see an ad like that,
86.298	because Nike actually wants
86.298	you to buy their shoes,
88.753	whereas the city of Toronto
88.753	clearly doesn't want you involved
91.658	with the planning process,
92.934	otherwise their ads would look
92.934	something like this,
95.374	with all the information laid out clearly.
97.415	As long as the city's putting out
97.415	notices like this
99.856	to try to get people engaged,
101.306	then of course people
101.306	aren't going to be engaged.
103.664	But that's not apathy;
103.664	that's intentional exclusion.
107.584	Public space.
108.872	(Applause)
111.781	The manner in which we mistreat
111.781	our public spaces
114.14	is a huge obstacle towards any type
114.14	of progressive political change,
118.424	because we've essentially put a price tag
118.424	on freedom of expression.
121.647	Whoever has the most money
121.647	gets the loudest voice,
124.256	dominating the visual
124.256	and mental environment.
126.679	The problem with this model
126.679	is there are some amazing messages
129.683	that need to be said,
129.683	that aren't profitable to say.
132.548	So you're never going
132.548	to see them on a billboard.
136.015	The media plays an important role
137.652	in developing our relationship
137.652	with political change,
140.86	mainly by ignoring politics and focusing
140.86	on celebrities and scandals,
145.035	but even when they do talk
145.035	about important political issues,
147.912	they do it in a way that I feel
147.912	discourages engagement.
150.789	I'll give you an example.
152.031	"The ""Now"" magazine from last week:"
152.031	progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.
155.648	This is the cover story.
156.86	It's an article
156.86	about a theater performance,
159.372	and it starts with basic
159.372	information about where it is,
162.154	in case you actually want to go and see
162.154	it after you've read the article --
165.703	where, the time, the website.
167.51	Same with this -- it's a movie review.
169.939	An art review.
171.547	A book review -- where the reading
171.547	is in case you want to go.
174.709	A restaurant -- you might not
174.709	want to just read about it,
177.443	maybe you want to go there.
178.894	So they tell you where it is, the prices,
178.894	the address, the phone number, etc.
182.691	Then you get to their political articles.
184.692	Here's a great article about an important
184.692	election race that's happening.
188.176	It talks about the candidates,
188.176	written very well,
190.529	but no information, no follow-up,
190.529	no websites for the campaigns,
193.78	no information about when the debates
193.78	are, where the campaign offices are.
197.329	Here's another good article,
198.782	about a new campaign
198.782	opposing privatization of transit,
201.86	without any contact information
201.86	for the campaign.
204.598	The message seems to be
206.146	that the readers are most likely
206.146	to want to eat, maybe read a book,
209.581	maybe see a movie, but not be engaged
209.581	in their community.
212.368	You might think this is a small thing,
212.368	but I think it's important,
215.53	because it sets a tone
216.95	and it reinforces the dangerous idea
216.95	that politics is a spectator sport.
223.423	Heroes: How do we view leadership?
225.692	Look at these 10 movies.
225.692	What do they have in common?
228.379	Anyone?
231.298	They all have heroes who were chosen.
233.396	Someone came up to them and said,
233.396	"""You're the chosen one."
236.135	There's a prophecy.
236.135	"You have to save the world."""
238.433	And then they go off and save the world
238.433	because they've been told to,
241.759	with a few people tagging along.
243.342	This helps me understand
244.522	why a lot of people have trouble
244.522	seeing themselves as leaders --
247.573	because it sends all the wrong messages
247.573	about what leadership is about.
251.121	A heroic effort is a collective effort,
253.658	number one.
255.188	Number two, it's imperfect;
255.188	it's not very glamorous,
258.58	and doesn't suddenly start
258.58	and suddenly end.
260.786	It's an ongoing process your whole life.
262.872	But most importantly, it's voluntary.
264.673	It's voluntary.
266.115	As long as we're teaching our kids
268.502	that heroism starts when someone
268.502	scratches a mark on your forehead,
271.948	or someone tells you
271.948	you're part of a prophecy,
274.198	they're missing the most important
274.198	characteristic of leadership,
277.251	which is that it comes from within.
278.962	It's about following
278.962	your own dreams, uninvited,
282.86	and then working with others
282.86	to make those dreams come true.
285.86	Political parties: oh, boy.
288.259	Political parties could and should be
288.259	one of the basic entry points
292.776	for people to get engaged in politics.
294.727	Instead, they've become, sadly,
297.016	uninspiring and uncreative organizations
299.926	that rely so heavily on market research
299.926	and polling and focus groups
303.86	that they end up all saying
303.86	the same thing,
305.932	pretty much regurgitating back
305.932	to us what we already want to hear
309.052	at the expense of putting forward
309.052	bold and creative ideas.
311.86	And people can smell that,
311.86	and it feeds cynicism.
314.64	(Applause)
320.984	Charitable status.
322.452	Groups who have charitable status
322.452	in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.
326.23	This is a huge problem
326.23	and a huge obstacle to change,
328.785	because it means that some
328.785	of the most passionate and informed voices
332.281	are completely silenced,
332.281	especially during election time.
335.188	Which leads us to the last one,
335.188	which is: our elections.
338.956	As you may have noticed,
340.148	our elections in Canada
340.148	are a complete joke.
342.279	We use out-of-date systems
343.794	that are unfair and create random results.
346.119	Canada's currently led by a party
347.86	that most Canadians didn't actually want.
350.332	How can we honestly and genuinely
350.332	encourage more people to vote
353.971	when votes don't count in Canada?
356.272	You add all this up together,
356.272	and of course people are apathetic.
359.664	It's like trying to run into a brick wall.
361.748	Now, I'm not trying to be negative
361.748	by throwing all these obstacles out
365.089	and explaining what's in our way.
366.713	Quite the opposite --
367.89	I actually think people are amazing
367.89	and smart and that they do care,
372.477	but that, as I said,
372.477	we live in this environment
374.86	where all these obstacles
374.86	are being put in our way.
378.748	As long as we believe
378.748	that people, our own neighbors,
382.223	are selfish, stupid or lazy,
385.677	then there's no hope.
388.064	But we can change
388.064	all those things I mentioned.
390.399	We can open up city hall.
391.86	We can reform our electoral systems.
393.616	We can democratize our public spaces.
395.617	My main message is:
397.413	if we can redefine apathy,
399.115	not as some kind of internal syndrome,
401.161	but as a complex web of cultural barriers
401.161	that reinforces disengagement,
406.589	and if we can clearly define,
406.589	clearly identify what those obstacles are,
412.176	and then if we can work together
412.176	collectively to dismantle those obstacles,
415.791	then anything is possible.
417.069	Thank you.
418.253	(Applause)
