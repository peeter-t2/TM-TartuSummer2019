12.76	This is Pleurobot.
15.4	Pleurobot is a robot that we designed
15.4	to closely mimic a salamander species
19.04	called Pleurodeles waltl.
21.24	Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here,
23.52	and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
26.28	So you might ask,
26.28	why did we design this robot?
28.96	And in fact, this robot has been designed
28.96	as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
33.4	Indeed, we designed it
33.4	together with neurobiologists
35.92	to understand how animals move,
37.84	and especially how the spinal cord
37.84	controls locomotion.
41.56	But the more I work in biorobotics,
43.28	the more I'm really impressed
43.28	by animal locomotion.
45.92	If you think of a dolphin swimming
45.92	or a cat running or jumping around,
50.24	or even us as humans,
51.84	when you go jogging or play tennis,
53.68	we do amazing things.
55.88	And in fact, our nervous system solves
55.88	a very, very complex control problem.
60.04	It has to coordinate
60.04	more or less 200 muscles perfectly,
63.16	because if the coordination is bad,
63.16	we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
67.56	And my goal is to understand
67.56	how this works.
71.16	There are four main components
71.16	behind animal locomotion.
74.8	The first component is just the body,
76.76	and in fact we should never underestimate
78.76	to what extent the biomechanics
78.76	already simplify locomotion in animals.
82.92	Then you have the spinal cord,
84.4	and in the spinal cord you find reflexes,
86.4	multiple reflexes that create
86.4	a sensorimotor coordination loop
89.88	between neural activity in the spinal cord
89.88	and mechanical activity.
94	A third component
94	are central pattern generators.
97	These are very interesting circuits
97	in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals
100.92	that can generate, by themselves,
102.56	very coordinated
102.56	rhythmic patterns of activity
105.32	while receiving
105.32	only very simple input signals.
107.72	And these input signals
108.96	coming from descending modulation
108.96	from higher parts of the brain,
112.04	like the motor cortex,
112.04	the cerebellum, the basal ganglia,
114.76	will all modulate activity
114.76	of the spinal cord
116.92	while we do locomotion.
118.4	But what's interesting is to what extent
118.4	just a low-level component,
121.64	the spinal cord, together with the body,
123.6	already solve a big part
123.6	of the locomotion problem.
126.08	You probably know it by the fact
126.08	that you can cut the head off a chicken,
129.532	it can still run for a while,
130.937	showing that just the lower part,
130.937	spinal cord and body,
133.5	already solve a big part of locomotion.
135.397	Now, understanding how this works
135.397	is very complex,
137.88	because first of all,
139.2	recording activity in the spinal cord
139.2	is very difficult.
141.844	It's much easier to implant electrodes
141.844	in the motor cortex
144.64	than in the spinal cord,
144.64	because it's protected by the vertebrae.
147.72	Especially in humans, very hard to do.
149.56	A second difficulty is that locomotion
149.56	is really due to a very complex
153.36	and very dynamic interaction
153.36	between these four components.
156.44	So it's very hard to find out
156.44	what's the role of each over time.
160.88	This is where biorobots like Pleurobot
160.88	and mathematical models
164.64	can really help.
167.48	So what's biorobotics?
168.76	Biorobotics is a very active field
168.76	of research in robotics
171.52	where people want to
171.52	take inspiration from animals
174	to make robots to go outdoors,
176.48	like service robots
176.48	or search and rescue robots
179.16	or field robots.
180.88	And the big goal here
180.88	is to take inspiration from animals
183.6	to make robots that can handle
183.6	complex terrain --
185.96	stairs, mountains, forests,
187.6	places where robots
187.6	still have difficulties
189.64	and where animals
189.64	can do a much better job.
191.72	The robot can be a wonderful
191.72	scientific tool as well.
194.24	There are some very nice projects
194.24	where robots are used,
196.884	like a scientific tool for neuroscience,
196.884	for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics.
200.88	And this is exactly
200.88	the purpose of Pleurobot.
203.6	So what we do in my lab
203.6	is to collaborate with neurobiologists
206.56	like Jean-Marie Cabelguen,
206.56	a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France,
209.8	and we want to make spinal cord models
209.8	and validate them on robots.
214.48	And here we want to start simple.
216.12	So it's good to start with simple animals
218.12	like lampreys, which are
218.12	very primitive fish,
220.4	and then gradually
220.4	go toward more complex locomotion,
222.92	like in salamanders,
224.2	but also in cats and in humans,
225.72	in mammals.
227.88	And here, a robot becomes
227.88	an interesting tool
230.28	to validate our models.
232.24	And in fact, for me, Pleurobot
232.24	is a kind of dream becoming true.
235.28	Like, more or less 20 years ago
235.28	I was already working on a computer
238.56	making simulations of lamprey
238.56	and salamander locomotion
241.24	during my PhD.
242.8	But I always knew that my simulations
242.8	were just approximations.
246.2	Like, simulating the physics in water
246.2	or with mud or with complex ground,
250.2	it's very hard to simulate that
250.2	properly on a computer.
252.88	Why not have a real robot
252.88	and real physics?
255.6	So among all these animals,
255.6	one of my favorites is the salamander.
258.76	You might ask why,
258.76	and it's because as an amphibian,
262.24	it's a really key animal
262.24	from an evolutionary point of view.
265.12	It makes a wonderful link
265.12	between swimming,
267.2	as you find it in eels or fish,
269.12	and quadruped locomotion,
269.12	as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
274.16	And in fact, the modern salamander
275.84	is very close to the first
275.84	terrestrial vertebrate,
278.24	so it's almost a living fossil,
279.8	which gives us access to our ancestor,
281.76	the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
285.24	So the salamander swims
286.64	by doing what's called
286.64	an anguilliform swimming gait,
289.16	so they propagate a nice traveling wave
289.16	of muscle activity from head to tail.
293.44	And if you place
293.44	the salamander on the ground,
295.64	it switches to what's called
295.64	a walking trot gait.
298	In this case, you have nice
298	periodic activation of the limbs
300.887	which are very nicely coordinated
302.52	with this standing wave
302.52	undulation of the body,
305.2	and that's exactly the gait
305.2	that you are seeing here on Pleurobot.
308.88	Now, one thing which is very surprising
308.88	and fascinating in fact
311.88	is the fact that all this can be generated
311.88	just by the spinal cord and the body.
316.04	So if you take
316.04	a decerebrated salamander --
318.064	it's not so nice
318.064	but you remove the head --
320.104	and if you electrically
320.104	stimulate the spinal cord,
322.8	at low level of stimulation
322.8	this will induce a walking-like gait.
326.08	If you stimulate a bit more,
326.08	the gait accelerates.
328.56	And at some point, there's a threshold,
330.48	and automatically,
330.48	the animal switches to swimming.
333.04	This is amazing.
334.44	Just changing the global drive,
335.96	as if you are pressing the gas pedal
337.72	of descending modulation
337.72	to your spinal cord,
339.88	makes a complete switch
339.88	between two very different gaits.
344.44	And in fact, the same
344.44	has been observed in cats.
347.04	If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat,
349.08	you can switch between
349.08	walk, trot and gallop.
351.32	Or in birds, you can make a bird
351.32	switch between walking,
354.08	at a low level of stimulation,
355.56	and flapping its wings
355.56	at high-level stimulation.
358.4	And this really shows that the spinal cord
360.44	is a very sophisticated
360.44	locomotion controller.
362.88	So we studied salamander locomotion
362.88	in more detail,
365.36	and we had in fact access
365.36	to a very nice X-ray video machine
368.48	from Professor Martin Fischer
368.48	in Jena University in Germany.
372.08	And thanks to that,
372.08	you really have an amazing machine
374.68	to record all the bone motion
374.68	in great detail.
377.16	That's what we did.
378.44	So we basically figured out
378.44	which bones are important for us
381.64	and collected their motion in 3D.
384.68	And what we did is collect
384.68	a whole database of motions,
387.4	both on ground and in water,
389.08	to really collect a whole database
389.08	of motor behaviors
391.589	that a real animal can do.
392.858	And then our job as roboticists
392.858	was to replicate that in our robot.
396.033	So we did a whole optimization process
396.033	to find out the right structure,
399.44	where to place the motors,
399.44	how to connect them together,
402.12	to be able to replay
402.12	these motions as well as possible.
405.68	And this is how Pleurobot came to life.
409.2	So let's look at how close
409.2	it is to the real animal.
412.96	So what you see here
412.96	is almost a direct comparison
415.48	between the walking
415.48	of the real animal and the Pleurobot.
418.2	You can see that we have
418.2	almost a one-to-one exact replay
420.96	of the walking gait.
422.24	If you go backwards and slowly,
422.24	you see it even better.
427.52	But even better, we can do swimming.
429.92	So for that we have a dry suit
429.92	that we put all over the robot --
432.96	(Laughter)
434.08	and then we can go in water
434.08	and start replaying the swimming gaits.
437.28	And here, we were very happy,
437.28	because this is difficult to do.
440.64	The physics of interaction are complex.
442.88	Our robot is much bigger
442.88	than a small animal,
445.32	so we had to do what's called
445.32	dynamic scaling of the frequencies
448.4	to make sure we had
448.4	the same interaction physics.
450.76	But you see at the end,
450.76	we have a very close match,
453.2	and we were very, very happy with this.
455.48	So let's go to the spinal cord.
457.72	So here what we did
457.72	with Jean-Marie Cabelguen
460.04	is model the spinal cord circuits.
463.04	And what's interesting
463.04	is that the salamander
465.2	has kept a very primitive circuit,
466.844	which is very similar
466.844	to the one we find in the lamprey,
469.52	this primitive eel-like fish,
471.52	and it looks like during evolution,
473.28	new neural oscillators
473.28	have been added to control the limbs,
476.24	to do the leg locomotion.
477.68	And we know where
477.68	these neural oscillators are
479.88	but what we did was to make
479.88	a mathematical model
482.16	to see how they should be coupled
483.8	to allow this transition
483.8	between the two very different gaits.
486.76	And we tested that on board of a robot.
489.68	And this is how it looks.
498.92	So what you see here
498.92	is a previous version of Pleurobot
501.96	that's completely controlled
501.96	by our spinal cord model
505.08	programmed on board of the robot.
507.28	And the only thing we do
508.52	is send to the robot
508.52	through a remote control
510.72	the two descending signals
510.72	it normally should receive
513.24	from the upper part of the brain.
515.48	And what's interesting is,
515.48	by playing with these signals,
518.2	we can completely control
518.2	speed, heading and type of gait.
521.6	For instance,
522.84	when we stimulate at a low level,
522.84	we have the walking gait,
526.44	and at some point, if we stimulate a lot,
528.44	very rapidly it switches
528.44	to the swimming gait.
531.48	And finally, we can also
531.48	do turning very nicely
533.72	by just stimulating more one side
533.72	of the spinal cord than the other.
538.2	And I think it's really beautiful
539.84	how nature has distributed control
542.12	to really give a lot of responsibility
542.12	to the spinal cord
545	so that the upper part of the brain
545	doesn't need to worry about every muscle.
548.68	It just has to worry
548.68	about this high-level modulation,
551.24	and it's really the job of the spinal cord
551.24	to coordinate all the muscles.
554.84	So now let's go to cat locomotion
554.84	and the importance of biomechanics.
559.08	So this is another project
560.36	where we studied cat biomechanics,
562.8	and we wanted to see how much
562.8	the morphology helps locomotion.
566.72	And we found three important
566.72	criteria in the properties,
570.36	basically, of the limbs.
572.32	The first one is that a cat limb
574.32	more or less looks
574.32	like a pantograph-like structure.
577.04	So a pantograph is a mechanical structure
579.28	which keeps the upper segment
579.28	and the lower segments always parallel.
583.6	So a simple geometrical system
583.6	that kind of coordinates a bit
586.72	the internal movement of the segments.
588.56	A second property of cat limbs
588.56	is that they are very lightweight.
591.64	Most of the muscles are in the trunk,
593.52	which is a good idea,
593.52	because then the limbs have low inertia
596.44	and can be moved very rapidly.
598.24	The last final important property is this
598.24	very elastic behavior of the cat limb,
602.08	so to handle impacts and forces.
604.76	And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
607.12	So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
614.16	So this is Peter Eckert,
614.16	who does his PhD on this robot,
617.84	and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
619.92	It looks a bit like a toy,
621.2	but it was really used
621.2	as a scientific tool
623.28	to investigate these properties
623.28	of the legs of the cat.
626.6	So you see, it's very compliant,
626.6	very lightweight,
629.24	and also very elastic,
630.52	so you can easily press it down
630.52	and it will not break.
633.32	It will just jump, in fact.
634.8	And this very elastic property
634.8	is also very important.
639.16	And you also see a bit these properties
641.08	of these three segments
641.08	of the leg as pantograph.
644.28	Now, what's interesting
644.28	is that this quite dynamic gait
647.08	is obtained purely in open loop,
649	meaning no sensors,
649	no complex feedback loops.
652.16	And that's interesting, because it means
654.6	that just the mechanics
654.6	already stabilized this quite rapid gait,
658.64	and that really good mechanics
658.64	already basically simplify locomotion.
662.84	To the extent that we can even
662.84	disturb a bit locomotion,
666.16	as you will see in the next video,
667.84	where we can for instance do some exercise
667.84	where we have the robot go down a step,
671.76	and the robot will not fall over,
673.4	which was a surprise for us.
675	This is a small perturbation.
676.44	I was expecting the robot
676.44	to immediately fall over,
678.88	because there are no sensors,
678.88	no fast feedback loop.
681.34	But no, just the mechanics
681.34	stabilized the gait,
683.56	and the robot doesn't fall over.
685.16	Obviously, if you make the step bigger,
685.16	and if you have obstacles,
688.32	you need the full control loops
688.32	and reflexes and everything.
692	But what's important here
692	is that just for small perturbation,
694.96	the mechanics are right.
696.48	And I think this is
696.48	a very important message
698.6	from biomechanics and robotics
698.6	to neuroscience,
700.815	saying don't underestimate to what extent
700.815	the body already helps locomotion.
707.44	Now, how does this relate
707.44	to human locomotion?
709.96	Clearly, human locomotion is more complex
709.96	than cat and salamander locomotion,
714.36	but at the same time, the nervous system
714.36	of humans is very similar
717.52	to that of other vertebrates.
719.12	And especially the spinal cord
720.6	is also the key controller
720.6	for locomotion in humans.
723.76	That's why, if there's a lesion
723.76	of the spinal cord,
726.2	this has dramatic effects.
727.72	The person can become
727.72	paraplegic or tetraplegic.
730.52	This is because the brain
730.52	loses this communication
732.92	with the spinal cord.
734.2	Especially, it loses
734.2	this descending modulation
736.44	to initiate and modulate locomotion.
739.64	So a big goal of neuroprosthetics
741.36	is to be able to reactivate
741.36	that communication
743.76	using electrical or chemical stimulations.
746.84	And there are several teams
746.84	in the world that do exactly that,
749.8	especially at EPFL.
751.04	My colleagues Grégoire Courtine
751.04	and Silvestro Micera,
753.56	with whom I collaborate.
755.96	But to do this properly,
755.96	it's very important to understand
759.08	how the spinal cord works,
760.84	how it interacts with the body,
762.56	and how the brain
762.56	communicates with the spinal cord.
765.8	This is where the robots
765.8	and models that I've presented today
768.72	will hopefully play a key role
770.64	towards these very important goals.
773.32	Thank you.
774.56	(Applause)
784.1	Bruno Giussani: Auke, I've seen
784.1	in your lab other robots
786.76	that do things like swim in pollution
789.24	and measure the pollution while they swim.
791.72	But for this one,
792.96	you mentioned in your talk,
792.96	like a side project,
797.64	search and rescue,
798.88	and it does have a camera on its nose.
801.08	Auke Ijspeert: Absolutely. So the robot --
803.6	We have some spin-off projects
805.053	where we would like to use the robots
805.053	to do search and rescue inspection,
808.52	so this robot is now seeing you.
810.12	And the big dream is to,
810.12	if you have a difficult situation
813.32	like a collapsed building
813.32	or a building that is flooded,
816.96	and this is very dangerous
816.96	for a rescue team or even rescue dogs,
820.32	why not send in a robot
820.32	that can crawl around, swim, walk,
823.24	with a camera onboard
823.24	to do inspection and identify survivors
826.44	and possibly create
826.44	a communication link with the survivor.
829.24	BG: Of course, assuming the survivors
829.24	don't get scared by the shape of this.
832.84	AI: Yeah, we should probably
832.84	change the appearance quite a bit,
836.16	because here I guess a survivor
836.16	might die of a heart attack
839	just of being worried
839	that this would feed on you.
841.56	But by changing the appearance
841.56	and it making it more robust,
844.44	I'm sure we can make
844.44	a good tool out of it.
846.52	BG: Thank you very much.
846.52	Thank you and your team.
