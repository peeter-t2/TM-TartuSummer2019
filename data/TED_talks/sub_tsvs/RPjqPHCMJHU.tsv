12.465	In Kenya, 1984 is known
15.722	as the year of the cup,
18.333	or the goro goro.
20.753	The goro goro is a cup used to measure
23.671	two kilograms of maize flower on the market,
26.981	and the maize flower is used to make ugali,
30.121	a polenta-like cake that is eaten
30.121	together with vegetables.
34.078	Both the maize and the vegetables are grown
36.393	on most Kenyan farms,
38.518	which means that most families can feed themselves
40.791	from their own farm.
42.972	One goro goro can feed three meals
46.9	for an average family,
48.881	and in 1984, the whole harvest
51.97	could fit in one goro goro.
55.142	It was and still is one of the worst droughts
57.992	in living memory.
60.635	Now today, I insure farmers against droughts
63.594	like those in the year of the cup,
65.655	or to be more specific, I insure the rains.
70.641	I come from a family of missionaries
73.09	who built hospitals in Indonesia,
75.241	and my father built a psychiatric hospital
77.518	in Tanzania.
78.774	This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.
81.875	I don't think they thought I'd grow up
84.196	to sell insurance. (Laughter)
87.162	So let me tell you how that happened.
90.203	In 2008, I was working
91.92	for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,
94.204	and my boss had just been promoted
96.2	to become the minister.
97.607	She launched an ambitious plan
99.495	to start a green revolution in her country,
101.824	and before we knew it, we were importing
103.444	tons of fertilizer and seed
105.737	and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer
108.462	and plant.
109.997	A couple of weeks later,
111.89	the International Monetary Fund visited us,
114.603	and asked my minister,
116.133	"""Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers"
118.945	"reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"""
123.118	My minister answered proudly
125.267	and somewhat defiantly,
127.281	"""I am going to pray for rain."""
131.871	That ended the discussion.
135.071	On the way back to the ministry in the car,
137.225	she turned around to me and said,
139.306	"""Rose, you've always been interested in finance."
141.376	"Go find us some insurance."""
144.515	It's been six years since,
146.552	and last year I was fortunate enough
148.542	to be part of a team that insured
150.048	over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda
153.953	against drought.
155.89	They owned an average of half an acre
157.97	and paid on average two Euros in premium.
161.423	It's microinsurance.
163.8	Now, traditional insurance doesn't work
165.855	with two to three Euros of premium,
167.768	because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.
170.675	A farmer here in Germany would be visited
172.617	for the start of the season, halfway through,
175.102	and at the end, and again if there was a loss,
177.589	to estimate the damages.
180.995	For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,
184.13	the maths of doing those visits
185.959	simply don't add up.
189.03	So instead, we rely on technology and data.
192.871	This satellite measures
195.077	whether there were clouds or not,
197.239	because think about it:
198.407	If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,
203.109	but if there are no clouds,
204.808	then it's actually impossible for it to rain.
207.659	These images show the onset of the rains
209.939	this season in Kenya.
211.794	You see that around March 6,
213.83	the clouds move in and then disappear,
216.935	and then around the March 11,
218.963	the clouds really move in.
222.213	That, and those clouds,
225.14	were the onset of the rains this year.
228.028	This satellite covers the whole of Africa
230.715	and goes back as far as 1984,
233.632	and that's important, because if you know
235.98	how many times a place has had a drought
238.421	in the last 30 years,
240.37	you can make a pretty good estimate
242.2	what the chances are of drought in the future,
244.957	and that means that you can put a price tag
247.07	on the risk of drought.
249.76	The data alone isn't enough.
252.156	We devise agronomic algorithms
254.641	which tell us how much rainfall
254.641	a crop needs and when.
258.335	For example, for maize at planting,
260.749	you need to have two days of rain
263.144	for farmers to plant,
265	and then it needs to rain once every two weeks
267.194	for the crop to properly germinate.
269.673	After that, you need rain every three weeks
272.998	for the crop to form its leaves,
275.901	whereas at flowering, you
275.901	need it to rain more frequently,
278.667	about once every 10 days
278.667	for the crop to form its cob.
282.527	At the end of the season,
284.032	you actually don't want it to rain,
286.244	because rains then can damage the crop.
289.795	Devising such a cover is difficult,
293.15	but it turned out the real challenge
295.046	was selling insurance.
299.574	We set ourselves a modest target
302.061	of 500 farmers insured after our first season.
306.061	After a couple of months' intense marketing,
308.631	we had signed up the grand total
310.45	of 185 farmers.
314.108	I was disappointed and confounded.
317.03	Everybody kept telling me that farmers
318.684	wanted insurance,
321.267	but our prime customers simply weren't buying.
324.264	They were waiting to see what would happen,
326.928	didn't trust insurance companies,
329.677	"or thought, ""I've managed for so many years."
331.963	"Why would I buy insurance now?"""
335.72	Now many of you know microcredit,
338.102	the method of providing small loans to poor people
341.596	pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,
343.598	who won the Nobel Peace Prize
345.119	for his work with the Grameen Bank.
347.268	Turns out, selling microcredit
349.752	isn't the same as selling insurance.
353.153	For credit, a farmer needs
353.153	to earn the trust of a bank,
357.038	and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.
360.982	That's an attractive proposition.
363.091	For insurance, the farmer needs to trust
366.337	the insurance company, and needs
367.879	to advance the insurance company money.
371.103	It's a very different value proposition.
374.47	And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,
377.159	with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans
379.735	taking up insurance in 2012,
382.288	and half of that number is in one country,
384.28	South Africa.
386.323	We tried for some years
387.97	selling insurance directly to farmers,
390.421	with very high marketing cost
392.42	and very limited success.
395.506	Then we realized that there were many organizations
397.46	working with farmers:
400.169	seed companies, microfinance institutions,
403.606	mobile phone companies,
405.552	government agencies.
406.874	They were all providing loans to farmers,
409.624	and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,
412.246	the farmer would say,
414.346	"""But what if it doesn't rain?"
416.498	"How do you expect me to repay my loan?"""
419.965	Many of these organizations
422.042	were taking on the risk themselves,
423.66	simply hoping that that year,
425.628	the worst wouldn't happen.
427.99	Most of the organizations, however,
429.996	were limiting their growth in agriculture.
432.319	They couldn't take on this kind of risk.
434.991	These organizations became our customers,
438.714	and when combining credit and insurance,
441.913	interesting things can happen.
444.632	Let me tell you one more story.
448.02	At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,
451.87	the rains started, and they started early,
454.869	and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,
457.94	because it usually means that
457.94	the season is going to be good.
461.506	So they took out loans and planted.
464.262	For the next three weeks,
465.752	there wasn't a single drop of rain,
468.06	and the crops that had germinated so well
470.624	shriveled and died.
473.937	We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution
476.692	that had provided those loans
477.812	to about 6,000 farmers in that area,
481.36	and we called them up and said,
482.65	"""Look, we know about the drought."
484.35	We've got you.
486.014	We'll give you 200,000 Euros
486.014	"at the end of the season."""
490.327	"They said, ""Wow, that's great,"
492.126	but that'll be late.
494.252	Could you give us the money now?
496.435	Then these farmers can still replant
498.865	"and can get a harvest this season."""
502.442	So we convinced our insurance partners,
504.523	and later that April, these farmers replanted.
507.898	We took the idea of replanting to a seed company
510.692	and convinced them to price the cost of insurance
512.802	into every bag of seed,
514.941	and in every bag, we packed a card
516.92	that had a number on it,
518.494	and when the farmers would open the card,
520.476	they'd text in that number,
522.477	and that number would actually help us
523.85	to locate the farmer
525.225	and allocate them to a satellite pixel.
528.349	A satellite would then measure the rainfall
530.891	for the next three weeks,
532.424	and if it didn't rain,
534.154	we'd replace their seed.
537.56	One of the first —
538.8	(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!
544.023	One of the first beneficiaries
544.023	of this replanting guarantee
547.18	was Bosco Mwinyi.
549.396	We visited his farm later that August,
552.087	and I wish I could show you the smile on his face
555.643	when he showed us his harvest,
558.107	because it warmed my heart
559.74	and it made me realize why selling insurance
561.678	can be a good thing.
564.388	But you know, he insisted
565.936	that we get his whole harvest in the picture,
568.89	so we had to zoom out a lot.
572.753	Insurance secured his harvest that season,
575.982	and I believe that today,
578.502	we have all the tools to enable African farmers
581.685	to take control of their own destiny.
584.452	No more years of the cup.
585.951	Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,
589.289	the year of the insurance,
591.945	or the year of the great harvest.
594.648	Thank you.
597.85	(Applause)
