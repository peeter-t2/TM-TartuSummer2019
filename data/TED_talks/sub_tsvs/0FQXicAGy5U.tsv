12.496	I'm very pleased to be here today
14.405	to talk to you all about how we might repair
16.959	the damaged brain,
18.995	and I'm particularly excited by this field,
21.237	because as a neurologist myself,
23.722	I believe that this offers one of the great ways
25.523	that we might be able to offer hope
27.455	for patients who today live with devastating
30.028	and yet untreatable diseases of the brain.
33.986	So here's the problem.
36.076	You can see here the picture of somebody's brain
38.876	with Alzheimer's disease
40.408	next to a healthy brain,
42.327	and what's obvious is, in the Alzheimer's brain,
44.943	ringed red, there's obvious
44.943	damage -- atrophy, scarring.
49.661	And I could show you equivalent pictures
51.378	from other disease: multiple sclerosis,
53.605	motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease,
56.123	even Huntington's disease,
58.26	and they would all tell a similar story.
61.229	And collectively these brain disorders represent
63.369	one of the major public health threats of our time.
66.935	And the numbers here are really rather staggering.
71.183	At any one time, there are 35 million people today
74.375	living with one of these brain diseases,
77.332	and the annual cost globally
79.871	is 700 billion dollars.
81.891	I mean, just think about that.
83.753	That's greater than one percent
85.24	of the global GDP.
87.986	And it gets worse,
89.892	because all these numbers are rising
92.054	because these are by and large
93.512	age-related diseases, and we're living longer.
96.7	So the question we really need to ask ourselves is,
99.095	why, given the devastating impact of these diseases
103.092	to the individual,
104.572	never mind the scale of the societal problem,
107.325	why are there no effective treatments?
110.906	Now in order to consider this,
112.884	I first need to give you a crash course
115.167	in how the brain works.
117.492	So in other words, I need to tell you
119.378	everything I learned at medical school.
121.434	(Laughter)
123.474	But believe me, this isn't going to take very long.
125.712	Okay? (Laughter)
128.167	So the brain is terribly simple:
130.136	it's made up of four cells,
133.183	and two of them are shown here.
134.985	There's the nerve cell,
136.498	and then there's the myelinating cell,
138.038	or the insulating cell.
139.536	It's called oligodendrocyte.
142.026	And when these four cells work together
143.815	in health and harmony,
145.674	they create an extraordinary
145.674	symphony of electrical activity,
149.642	and it is this electrical activity
151.882	that underpins our ability to think, to emote,
155.255	to remember, to learn, move, feel and so on.
158.599	But equally, each of these individual four cells
161.94	alone or together, can go rogue or die,
167.03	and when that happens, you get damage.
169.275	You get damaged wiring.
170.49	You get disrupted connections.
173.554	And that's evident here with the slower conduction.
177.712	But ultimately, this damage will manifest
180.175	as disease, clearly.
182.657	And if the starting dying nerve cell
185.755	is a motor nerve, for example,
187.571	you'll get motor neuron disease.
189.986	So I'd like to give you a real-life illustration
192.609	of what happens with motor neuron disease.
196.017	So this is a patient of mine called John.
198.546	John I saw just last week in the clinic.
201.559	And I've asked John to tell us something 
201.559	about what were his problems
205.183	that led to the initial diagnosis
207.082	of motor neuron disease.
208.721	John: I was diagnosed in October in 2011,
213.67	and the main problem was a breathing problem,
217.25	difficulty breathing.
218.943	Siddharthan Chandran: I don't know if you
218.943	caught all of that, but what John was telling us
221.203	was that difficulty with breathing
223.443	led eventually to the diagnosis
225.537	of motor neuron disease.
228.39	So John's now 18 months
228.39	further down in that journey,
231.954	and I've now asked him to tell us something about
234.187	his current predicament.
236.476	John: What I've got now is 
236.476	the breathing's gotten worse.
239.336	I've got weakness in my hands, 
239.336	my arms and my legs.
245.033	So basically I'm in a wheelchair most of the time.
249.853	SC: John's just told us he's in a wheelchair
252.679	most of the time.
254.803	So what these two clips show
257.021	is not just the devastating
257.021	consequence of the disease,
259.777	but they also tell us something about
261.32	the shocking pace of the disease,
263.62	because in just 18 months,
266.932	a fit adult man has been rendered
269.628	wheelchair- and respirator-dependent.
272.959	And let's face it, John could be anybody's father,
275.264	brother or friend.
277.451	So that's what happens when the motor nerve dies.
279.704	But what happens when that myelin cell dies?
284.304	You get multiple sclerosis.
286.524	So the scan on your left
288.343	is an illustration of the brain,
291.066	and it's a map of the connections of the brain,
293.917	and superimposed upon which
295.884	are areas of damage.
297.258	We call them lesions of demyelination.
299.449	But they're damage, and they're white.
302.281	So I know what you're thinking here.
303.796	"You're thinking, ""My God, this bloke came up"
306.304	and said he's going to talk about hope,
308.235	and all he's done is give a really rather bleak
310.744	"and depressing tale."""
312.308	I've told you these diseases are terrible.
313.903	They're devastating, numbers are rising,
316.564	the costs are ridiculous, and worst of all,
318.691	we have no treatment. Where's the hope?
320.977	Well, you know what? I think there is hope.
323.522	And there's hope in this next section,
325.916	of this brain section of somebody else with M.S.,
328.211	because what it illustrates
329.739	is, amazingly, the brain can repair itself.
332.212	It just doesn't do it well enough.
334.79	And so again, there are two
334.79	things I want to show you.
336.915	First of all is the damage of this patient with M.S.
340.341	And again, it's another one of these white masses.
343.824	But crucially, the area that's ringed red
347.262	highlights an area that is pale blue.
349.485	But that area that is pale blue was once white.
352.311	So it was damaged. It's now repaired.
355.922	Just to be clear: It's not because of doctors.
358.684	It's in spite of doctors, not because of doctors.
361.001	This is spontaneous repair.
363.184	It's amazing and it's occurred
364.732	because there are stem cells in the brain, even,
367.946	which can enable new myelin, new insulation,
371.12	to be laid down over the damaged nerves.
373.449	And this observation is important for two reasons.
377.936	The first is it challenges one of the orthodoxies
381.176	that we learnt at medical school,
382.805	or at least I did, admittedly last century,
386.425	which is that the brain doesn't repair itself,
388.996	unlike, say, the bone or the liver.
392.117	But actually it does, but it
392.117	just doesn't do it well enough.
395.616	And the second thing it does,
397.258	and it gives us a very clear direction 
397.258	of travel for new therapies --
401.233	I mean, you don't need to be a rocket scientist
402.952	to know what to do here.
404.472	You simply need to find ways of promoting
407.405	the endogenous, spontaneous
407.405	repair that occurs anyway.
411.929	So the question is, why, if we've known that
414.386	for some time, as we have,
416.343	why do we not have those treatments?
420.637	And that in part reflects the complexity
422.756	of drug development.
425.367	Now, drug development you might think of
427.401	as a rather expensive but risky bet,
430.125	and the odds of this bet are roughly this:
432.078	they're 10,000 to one against,
434.675	because you need to screen
434.675	about 10,000 compounds
437.48	to find that one potential winner.
439.551	And then you need to spend 15 years
441.468	and spend over a billion dollars,
442.966	and even then, you may not have a winner.
446.109	So the question for us is,
447.788	can you change the rules of the game
449.379	and can you shorten the odds?
451.928	And in order to do that, you have to think,
453.972	where is the bottleneck in this drug discovery?
456.802	And one of the bottlenecks is 
456.802	early in drug discovery.
459.915	All that screening occurs in animal models.
463.877	But we know that the proper 
463.877	study of mankind is man,
467.336	to borrow from Alexander Pope.
469.44	So the question is, can we study these diseases
471.811	using human material?
474.199	And of course, absolutely we can.
476.262	We can use stem cells,
477.791	and specifically we can use human stem cells.
480.591	And human stem cells are these extraordinary
482.695	but simple cells that can do two things:
485.097	they can self-renew or make more of themselves,
487.891	but they can also become specialized
489.949	to make bone, liver or, crucially, nerve cells,
492.548	maybe even the motor nerve cell
494.388	or the myelin cell.
496.548	And the challenge has long been,
498.069	can we harness the power,
500.041	the undoubted power of these stem cells
502.326	in order to realize their promise
504.344	for regenerative neurology?
505.971	And I think we can now, and the reason we can
508.9	is because there have been
508.9	several major discoveries
511.808	in the last 10, 20 years.
513.545	One of them was here in Edinburgh,
515.157	and it must be the only celebrity sheep, Dolly.
519.269	So Dolly was made in Edinburgh,
520.894	and Dolly was an example
522.577	of the first cloning of a mammal
525.791	from an adult cell.
527.739	But I think the even more significant breakthrough
530.544	for the purposes of our discussion today
533.466	was made in 2006 by a Japanese scientist
535.955	called Yamanaka.
537.552	And what Yamaka did,
538.856	in a fantastic form of scientific cookery,
541.288	was he showed that four ingredients,
543.326	just four ingredients,
545.189	could effectively convert any cell, adult cell,
548.376	into a master stem cell.
550.618	And the significance of this is difficult to exaggerate,
553.602	because what it means that
553.602	from anybody in this room,
555.842	but particularly patients,
557.646	you could now generate
558.977	a bespoke, personalized tissue repair kit.
561.703	Take a skin cell, make it a master pluripotent cell,
564.651	so you could then make those cells
566.39	that are relevant to their disease,
568.829	both to study but potentially to treat.
571.471	Now, the idea of that at medical school --
573.533	this is a recurring theme, isn't 
573.533	it, me and medical school? —
576.158	would have been ridiculous,
577.976	but it's an absolute reality today.
580.035	And I see this as the cornerstone
582.169	of regeneration, repair and hope.
585.346	And whilst we're on the theme of hope,
587.296	for those of you who might have failed at school,
589.437	there's hope for you as well,
591.662	because this is the school report of John Gerdon.
594.158	"[""I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist;"
594.158	"on his present showing this is quite ridiculous.""]"
595.37	So they didn't think much of him then.
596.806	But what you may not know is that he 
596.806	got the Nobel Prize for medicine
599.664	just three months ago.
602.216	So to return to the original problem,
604.782	what is the opportunity of these stem cells,
606.925	or this disruptive technology,
608.586	for repairing the damaged brain,
610.14	which we call regenerative neurology?
612.271	I think there are two ways you can think about this:
614.698	as a fantastic 21st-century drug discovery tool,
618.146	and/or as a form of therapy.
620.963	So I want to tell you a little bit about both of those
622.99	in the next few moments.
625.439	Drug discovery in a dish is how people often
627.47	talk about this.
628.7	It's very simple: You take a patient with a disease,
631.627	let's say motor neuron disease,
633.446	you take a skin sample,
635.203	you do the pluripotent reprogramming,
638.261	as I've already told you,
640.352	and you generate live motor nerve cells.
642.869	That's straightforward, because that's what
644.603	pluripotent cells can do.
646.34	But crucially, you can then compare their behavior
649.296	to their equivalent but healthy counterparts,
651.719	ideally from an unaffected relative.
653.749	That way, you're matching for genetic variation.
656.991	And that's exactly what we did here.
659.338	This was a collaboration with colleagues:
661.261	in London, Chris Shaw; in the U.S., 
661.261	Steve Finkbeiner and Tom Maniatis.
664.784	And what you're looking at, and this is amazing,
667.306	these are living, growing, motor nerve cells
670.106	from a patient with motor neuron disease.
672.349	It happens to be an inherited form.
674.274	I mean, just imagine that.
675.973	This would have been unimaginable 10 years ago.
678.454	So apart from seeing them
678.454	grow and put out processes,
681.808	we can also engineer them so that they fluoresce,
684.25	but crucially, we can then
684.25	track their individual health
687.309	and compare the diseased motor nerve cells
689.829	to the healthy ones.
691.701	And when you do all that and put it together,
695.188	you realize that the diseased ones,
697.287	which is represented in the red line,
699.075	are two and a half times more likely to die
702.696	than the healthy counterpart.
705.401	And the crucial point about this is that you then have
708.044	a fantastic assay to discover drugs,
711.633	because what would you ask of the drugs,
713.542	and you could do this through a high-throughput
715.303	automated screening system,
717.712	you'd ask the drugs, give me one thing:
720.158	find me a drug that will bring the red line
722.983	closer to the blue line,
724.873	because that drug will be a high-value candidate
728.092	that you could probably take direct to human trial
730.992	and almost bypass that bottleneck
733.579	that I've told you about in drug discovery
735.98	with the animal models,
737.793	if that makes sense. It's fantastic.
740.446	But I want to come back
742.01	to how you might use stem cells directly
744.059	to repair damage.
745.834	And again there are two ways to think about this,
747.659	and they're not mutually exclusive.
749.674	The first, and I think in the long run
751.964	the one that will give us the biggest dividend,
754.193	but it's not thought of that way just yet,
756.797	is to think about those stem cells that are already
760.053	in your brain, and I've told you that.
761.893	All of us have stem cells in the brain,
763.747	even the diseased brain,
765.382	and surely the smart way forward
767	is to find ways that you can promote and activate
769.497	those stem cells in your brain already
771.533	to react and respond appropriately to damage
774.72	to repair it.
776.004	That will be the future.
777.436	There will be drugs that will do that.
780.309	But the other way is to effectively parachute in cells,
784.572	transplant them in,
786.376	to replace dying or lost cells, even in the brain.
790.854	And I want to tell you now an experiment,
792.942	it's a clinical trial that we did,
794.836	which recently completed,
796.692	which is with colleagues in UCL,
799.209	David Miller in particular.
801.964	So this study was very simple.
803.877	We took patients with multiple sclerosis
806.979	and asked a simple question:
808.517	Would stem cells from the bone marrow
810.191	be protective of their nerves?
811.914	So what we did was we took this bone marrow,
815.759	grew up the stem cells in the lab,
817.976	and then injected them back into the vein.
820.315	I'm making this sound really simple.
822.115	It took five years off a lot of people, okay?
825.222	And it put gray hair on me
826.91	and caused all kinds of issues.
828.391	But conceptually, it's essentially simple.
832.414	So we've given them into the vein, right?
835.721	So in order to measure whether
835.721	this was successful or not,
839.354	we measured the optic nerve
841.102	as our outcome measure.
842.788	And that's a good thing to measure in M.S.,
844.553	because patients with M.S. sadly suffer
846.626	with problems with vision --
848.098	loss of vision, unclear vision.
850.288	And so we measured the size of the optic nerve
852.371	using the scans with David Miller
854.425	three times -- 12 months, six months,
856.523	and before the infusion --
858.139	and you can see the gently declining red line.
861.265	And that's telling you that
861.265	the optic nerve is shrinking,
863.493	which makes sense, because their nerves are dying.
865.836	We then gave the stem cell infusion
868.142	and repeated the measurement twice --
870.243	three months and six months --
871.882	and to our surprise, almost,
873.855	the line's gone up.
876.011	That suggests that the intervention
878.542	has been protective.
880.439	I don't think myself that what's happened
882.356	is that those stem cells have made new myelin
884.392	or new nerves.
885.856	What I think they've done is they've promoted
888.001	the endogenous stem cells, or precursor cells,
890.61	to do their job, wake up, lay down new myelin.
894.061	So this is a proof of concept.
896.36	I'm very excited about that.
898.985	So I just want to end with the theme I began on,
901.474	which was regeneration and hope.
903.464	So here I've asked John
905.234	what his hopes are for the future.
907.532	John: I would hope that
909.286	sometime in the future
911.086	through the research that you people are doing,
913.526	we can come up with a cure
915.735	so that people like me can lead a normal life.
919.559	SC: I mean, that speaks volumes.
922.154	But I'd like to close by first of all thanking John --
924.693	thanking John for allowing me to share
926.422	his insights and these clips with you all.
929.592	But I'd also like to add to John and to others
932.127	that my own view is, I'm hopeful for the future.
934.704	I do believe that the disruptive technologies
937.056	like stem cells that I've tried to explain to you
939.114	do offer very real hope.
940.935	And I do think that the day that we might be able
942.698	to repair the damaged brain
944.134	is sooner than we think.
945.423	Thank you.
947.226	(Applause)
