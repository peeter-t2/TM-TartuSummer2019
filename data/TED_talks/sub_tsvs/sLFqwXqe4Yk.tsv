12.88	Our grandparents' generation
12.88	created an amazing system
16.6	of canals and reservoirs
16.6	that made it possible
19.2	for people to live in places
19.2	where there wasn't a lot of water.
22.64	For example, during the Great Depression,
25.2	they created the Hoover Dam,
26.84	which in turn, created Lake Mead
29.28	and made it possible for the cities
29.28	of Las Vegas and Phoenix
32.92	and Los Angeles to provide water
34.68	for people who lived
34.68	in a really dry place.
37.76	In the 20th century,
37.76	we literally spent trillions of dollars
41.68	building infrastructure
41.68	to get water to our cities.
45.12	In terms of economic development,
45.12	it was a great investment.
49.08	But in the last decade,
49.08	we've seen the combined effects
52.08	of climate change, population growth
52.08	and competition for water resources
57.88	threaten these vital lifelines
57.88	and water resources.
61.56	This figure shows you the change
61.56	in the lake level of Lake Mead
65.72	that happened in the last 15 years.
68	You can see starting around the year 2000,
70.36	the lake level started to drop.
72.28	And it was dropping at such a rate
74.12	that it would have left the drinking water
74.12	intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.
78.72	The city became so concerned about this
81.48	that they recently constructed
81.48	a new drinking water intake structure
85.44	"that they referred to as the ""Third Straw"""
87.52	to pull water out
87.52	of the greater depths of the lake.
91.08	The challenges associated
91.08	with providing water to a modern city
94.76	are not restricted
94.76	to the American Southwest.
97.84	In the year 2007, the third largest
97.84	city in Australia, Brisbane,
103.2	came within 6 months
103.2	of running out of water.
106.16	A similar drama is playing out today
106.16	in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil,
110.44	where the main reservoir for the city
112.28	has gone from being
112.28	completely full in 2010,
115.2	to being nearly empty today
117.4	as the city approaches
117.4	the 2016 Summer Olympics.
122	For those of us who are fortunate enough
124.56	to live in one
124.56	of the world's great cities,
126.64	we've never truly experienced
126.64	the effects of a catastrophic drought.
130.8	We like to complain
130.8	about the navy showers we have to take.
134.56	We like our neighbors to see
134.56	our dirty cars and our brown lawns.
138.96	But we've never really faced
138.96	the prospect of turning on the tap
142.52	and having nothing come out.
144.92	And that's because when things
144.92	have gotten bad in the past,
147.76	it's always been possible
147.76	to expand a reservoir
150.84	or dig a few more groundwater wells.
154.08	Well, in a time when all
154.08	of the water resources are spoken for,
157.96	it's not going to be possible
157.96	to rely on this tried and true way
161.36	of providing ourselves with water.
163.72	Some people think that we're going
163.72	to solve the urban water problem
167.52	by taking water from our rural neighbors.
170.4	But that's an approach that's fraught
170.4	with political, legal and social dangers.
176.68	And even if we succeed in grabbing
176.68	the water from our rural neighbors,
180.24	we're just transferring
180.24	the problem to someone else
182.76	and there's a good chance
182.76	it will come back and bite us
185.4	in the form of higher food prices
187.32	and damage to the aquatic ecosystems
187.32	that already rely upon that water.
192.2	I think that there's a better way
192.2	to solve our urban water crisis
195.6	and I think that's to open up
195.6	four new local sources of water
200.04	that I liken to faucets.
201.8	If we can make smart investments
201.8	in these new sources of water
205.92	in the coming years,
207.24	we can solve our urban water problem
209.6	and decrease the likelihood
209.6	that we'll ever run across
212.96	the effects of a catastrophic drought.
216.28	Now, if you told me 20 years ago
218.36	that a modern city could exist
218.36	without a supply of imported water,
223	I probably would have dismissed you
223	as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer.
227.48	But my own experiences
229.04	working with some of the world's most
229.04	water-starved cities in the last decades
233.44	have shown me that we have
233.44	the technologies and the management skills
237.4	to actually transition away
237.4	from imported water,
240.32	and that's what I want
240.32	to tell you about tonight.
243.24	The first source of local water
243.24	supply that we need to develop
247.64	to solve our urban water problem
249.8	will flow with the rainwater
249.8	that falls in our cities.
253.08	One of the great tragedies
253.08	of urban development
256.52	is that as our cities grew,
258.52	we started covering all the surfaces
258.52	with concrete and asphalt.
262.2	And when we did that,
262.2	we had to build storm sewers
264.64	to get the water
264.64	that fell on the cities out
266.76	before it could cause flooding,
268.72	and that's a waste
268.72	of a vital water resource.
272.2	Let me give you an example.
274	This figure here shows you
274	the volume of water
277.24	that could be collected
277.24	in the city of San Jose
279.88	if they could harvest the stormwater
279.88	that fell within the city limits.
283.68	You can see from the intersection
283.68	of the blue line and the black dotted line
288.48	that if San Jose could just capture half
288.48	of the water that fell within the city,
292.8	they'd have enough water
292.8	to get them through an entire year.
296.16	Now, I know what some of you
296.16	are probably thinking.
298.8	"""The answer to our problem"
298.8	is to start building great big tanks
302.4	and attaching them
302.4	to the downspouts of our roof gutters,
305.28	"rainwater harvesting."""
307.16	Now, that's an idea
307.16	that might work in some places.
309.6	But if you live in a place
309.6	where it mainly rains in the winter time
312.88	and most of the water demand
312.88	is in the summertime,
315.32	it's not a very cost-effective way
315.32	to solve a water problem.
319.08	And if you experience the effects
319.08	of a multiyear drought,
322.12	like California's currently experiencing,
324.32	you just can't build a rainwater tank
324.32	that's big enough to solve your problem.
328.56	I think there's a lot more practical way
330.6	to harvest the stormwater and
330.6	the rainwater that falls in our cities,
334.12	and that's to capture it
334.12	and let it percolate into the ground.
337.92	After all, many of our cities are sitting
337.92	on top of a natural water storage system
343.12	that can accommodate
343.12	huge volumes of water.
346.24	For example, historically,
346.24	Los Angeles has obtained
349.92	about a third of its water supply
349.92	from a massive aquifer
352.96	that underlies the San Fernando Valley.
356.4	Now, when you look at the water
356.4	that comes off of your roof
359.2	and runs off of your lawn
359.2	and flows down the gutter,
361.68	you might say to yourself,
361.68	"""Do I really want to drink that stuff?"""
365.52	Well, the answer is
365.52	you don't want to drink it
367.72	until it's been treated a little bit.
369.56	And so the challenge that we face
369.56	in urban water harvesting
372.68	is to capture the water, clean the water
375.44	and get it underground.
377.52	And that's exactly
377.52	what the city of Los Angeles is doing
380.56	with a new project that they're building
380.56	in Burbank, California.
384.68	This figure here shows
384.68	the stormwater park that they're building
388.8	by hooking a series of stormwater
388.8	collection systems, or storm sewers,
394	and routing that water
394	into an abandoned gravel quarry.
397.6	The water that's captured in the quarry
399.52	is slowly passed
399.52	through a man-made wetland,
402.32	and then it goes
402.32	into that ball field there
404.96	and percolates into the ground,
406.92	recharging the drinking water
406.92	aquifer of the city.
409.96	And in the process
409.96	of passing through the wetland
413	and percolating through the ground,
414.8	the water encounters microbes
414.8	that live on the surfaces of the plants
418.32	and the surfaces of the soil,
419.92	and that purifies the water.
422.16	And if the water's
422.16	still not clean enough to drink
424.56	after it's been through
424.56	this natural treatment process,
427.28	the city can treat it again
428.64	when they pump if back out
428.64	of the groundwater aquifers
431.24	before they deliver it to people to drink.
434.44	The second tap that we need to open up
434.44	to solve our urban water problem
438.84	will flow with the wastewater
440.32	that comes out
440.32	of our sewage treatment plants.
443.36	Now, many of you are probably familiar
443.36	with the concept of recycled water.
446.861	You've probably seen signs like this
448.76	that tell you that the shrubbery
448.76	and the highway median
452.04	and the local golf course
453.56	is being watered with water
455.44	that used to be
455.44	in a sewage treatment plant.
458.4	We've been doing this
458.4	for a couple of decades now.
461.36	But what we're learning
461.36	from our experience
463.4	is that this approach is much more
463.4	expensive that we expected it to be.
467.52	Because once we build
467.52	the first few water recycling systems
470.64	close to the sewage treatment plant,
472.44	we have to build longer
472.44	and longer pipe networks
474.703	to get that water to where it needs to go.
477.6	And that becomes prohibitive
477.6	in terms of cost.
481	What we're finding is
482.24	that a much more cost-effective
482.24	and practical way of recycling wastewater
486.28	is to turn treated wastewater
486.28	into drinking water
488.88	through a two-step process.
491.08	In the first step in this process
491.08	we pressurize the water
494.24	and pass it through
494.24	a reverse osmosis membrane:
497	a thin, permeable plastic membrane
499.44	that allows water molecules
499.44	to pass through
502	but traps and retains the salts,
502	the viruses and the organic chemicals
506.8	that might be present in the wastewater.
509.52	In the second step in the process,
511.48	we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide
514	and shine ultraviolet light on the water.
516.72	The ultraviolet light
516.72	cleaves the hydrogen peroxide
519.64	into two parts that are called
519.64	hydroxyl radicals,
522.8	and these hydroxyl radicals
522.8	are very potent forms of oxygen
526.919	that break down most organic chemicals.
530.12	After the water's been
530.12	through this two-stage process,
533.2	it's safe to drink.
534.84	I know,
536.12	I've been studying recycled water
538.72	using every measurement technique
538.72	known to modern science
542.16	for the past 15 years.
544.32	We've detected some chemicals
545.76	that can make it through
545.76	the first step in the process,
548.36	but by the time we get to the second step,
550.384	the advanced oxidation process,
552.32	we rarely see any chemicals present.
554.76	And that's in stark contrast
554.76	to the taken-for-granted water supplies
558.96	that we regularly drink all the time.
562.04	There's another way we can recycle water.
564.44	This is an engineered treatment wetland
564.44	that we recently built
567.56	on the Santa Ana River
567.56	in Southern California.
570.36	The treatment wetland receives water
570.36	from a part of the Santa Ana River
574.48	that in the summertime consists
574.48	almost entirely of wastewater effluent
578.12	from cities like Riverside
578.12	and San Bernardino.
581.16	The water comes
581.16	into our treatment wetland,
583.24	it's exposed to sunlight and algae
585.6	and those break down
585.6	the organic chemicals,
588.12	remove the nutrients
588.12	and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
591.68	The water gets put back
591.68	in the Santa Ana River,
594.16	it flows down to Anaheim,
596.08	gets taken out at Anaheim
596.08	and percolated into the ground,
599.36	and becomes the drinking water
599.36	of the city of Anaheim,
602.04	completing the trip
602.04	from the sewers of Riverside County
606	to the drinking water supply
606	of Orange County.
610	Now, you might think
610	that this idea of drinking wastewater
613.44	is some sort of futuristic fantasy
613.44	or not commonly done.
616.88	Well, in California, we already recycle
616.88	about 40 billion gallons a year
621.28	of wastewater through the two-stage
621.28	advanced treatment process
624.4	I was telling you about.
625.72	That's enough water to be
625.72	the supply of about a million people
629.48	if it were their sole water supply.
632.28	The third tap that we need to open up
632.28	will not be a tap at all,
636.52	it will be a kind of virtual tap,
638.16	it will be the water conservation
638.16	that we manage to do.
641.28	And the place where we need to think
641.28	about water conservation is outdoors
644.76	because in California
644.76	and other modern American cities,
648.4	about half of our water use
648.4	happens outdoors.
651.76	In the current drought,
653.24	we've seen that it's possible
654.84	to have our lawns survive
654.84	and our plants survive
657.84	with about half as much water.
659.76	So there's no need
659.76	to start painting concrete green
662.8	and putting in Astroturf
662.8	and buying cactuses.
665.92	We can have California-friendly
665.92	landscaping with soil moisture detectors
670.16	and smart irrigation controllers
672.08	and have beautiful
672.08	green landscapes in our cities.
675.76	The fourth and final water tap
675.76	that we need to open up
678.8	to solve our urban water problem
680.72	will flow with desalinated seawater.
683.36	Now, I know what you probably heard
683.36	people say about seawater desalination.
687.36	"""It's a great thing to do if you have"
687.36	lots of oil, not a lot of water
691.56	"and you don't care about climate change."""
693.96	Seawater desalination is energy-intensive
693.96	no matter how you slice it.
698.32	But that characterization
698.32	of seawater desalination
700.96	as being a nonstarter
700.96	is hopelessly out of date.
704	We've made tremendous progress
704	in seawater desalination
706.8	in the past two decades.
708.92	This picture shows you
710.6	the largest seawater desalination plant
710.6	in the Western hemisphere
714.6	that's currently being built
714.6	north of San Diego.
717.44	Compared to the seawater
717.44	desalination plant
719.72	that was built in
719.72	Santa Barbara 25 years ago,
723.04	this treatment plant
723.04	will use about half the energy
725.72	to produce a gallon of water.
727.84	But just because seawater desalination
727.84	has become less energy-intensive,
731.6	doesn't mean we should start building
731.6	desalination plants everywhere.
734.863	Among the different choices we have,
736.623	it's probably the most energy-intensive
738.76	and potentially environmentally damaging
740.72	of the options to create
740.72	a local water supply.
744.56	So there it is.
745.8	With these four sources of water,
747.6	we can move away
747.6	from our reliance on imported water.
751.68	Through reform in the way we landscape
751.68	our surfaces and our properties,
756.2	we can reduce outdoor water use
756.2	by about 50 percent,
759.32	thereby increasing 
759.32	the water supply by 25 percent.
762.8	We can recycle the water
762.8	that makes it into the sewer,
765.348	thereby increasing
765.348	our water supply by 40 percent.
768.88	And we can make up the difference
768.88	through a combination
771.52	of stormwater harvesting
771.52	and seawater desalination.
775.28	So, let's create a water supply
779.12	that will be able
779.12	to withstand any of the challenges
782.8	that climate change throws at us
782.8	in the coming years.
785.4	Let's create a water supply
785.4	that uses local sources
788.76	and leaves more water
788.76	in the environment for fish and for food.
793.64	Let's create a water system that's
793.64	consistent with out environmental values.
798.68	And let's do it for our children
798.68	and our grandchildren
802.16	and let's tell them this is the system
804.8	that they have to
804.8	take care of in the future
807.16	because it's our last chance
807.16	to create a new kind of water system.
811.12	Thank you very much for your attention.
813.002	(Applause)
