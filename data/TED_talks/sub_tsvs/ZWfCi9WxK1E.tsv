12.814	I was 10 years old when I learned
12.814	"what the word ""genocide"" meant."
18.575	It was 2003,
20.303	and my people were being brutally
20.303	attacked because of their race --
24.429	hundreds of thousands murdered,
26.257	millions displaced,
28.229	a nation torn apart at the hands
28.229	of its own government.
32.019	My mother and father immediately began
32.019	speaking out against the crisis.
36.233	I didn't really understand it,
37.743	except for the fact
37.743	that it was destroying my parents.
41.211	One day, I walked in on my mother crying,
44.948	and I asked her why
44.948	we are burying so many people.
50.22	I don't remember the words that she chose
52.947	to describe genocide to her
57.208	but I remember the feeling.
59.561	We felt completely alone,
62.64	as if no one could hear us,
64.582	as if we were essentially invisible.
68.179	This is when I wrote
68.179	my first poem about Darfur.
72.964	I wrote poetry to convince people
72.964	to hear and see us,
77.976	and that's how I learned
77.976	the thing that changed me.
81.111	It's easy to be seen.
82.931	I mean, look at me -- I'm a young
82.931	African woman with a scarf around my head,
88.065	an American accent on my tongue
90.252	and a story that makes even the most
90.252	brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.
95.851	But it's hard to convince people
95.851	that they deserve to be seen.
100.561	I learned this in my high school
100.561	classroom one day,
102.996	when my teacher asked me
102.996	to give a presentation about Darfur.
105.895	I was setting up the projector
105.895	when a classmate of mine said,
109.814	"""Why do you have to talk about this?"
111.933	Can't you think about us
111.933	"and how it will make us feel?"""
115.007	(Laughter)
117.171	My 14-year-old self didn't know
117.171	what to say to her,
121.259	or how to explain the pain
121.259	that I felt in that moment,
125.145	and in every moment that we were forced
125.145	"not to talk about ""this."""
129.24	Her words took me back to the days
129.24	and nights on the ground in Darfur,
134.108	where we were forced to remain silent;
136.586	where we didn't speak over morning tea
138.801	because the warplanes overhead
138.801	would swallow any and all noise;
143.278	back to the days when we were told
145.425	not only that we don't
145.425	deserve to be heard
148.238	but that we do not have a right to exist.
151.783	And this is where the magic happened,
154.286	in that classroom when all the students
154.286	started taking their seats
157.533	and I began to speak,
158.826	despite this renewed feeling
158.826	that I didn't deserve to be there,
162.589	that I didn't belong there
164.053	or have a right to break the silence.
166.93	As I talked,
168.638	and my classmates listened,
171.305	the fear ebbed away.
173.842	My mind became calm,
175.443	and I felt safe.
178.616	It was the sound of our grieving,
181.537	the feel of their arms around me,
184.284	the steady walls that held us together.
187.746	It felt nothing like a vacuum.
190.621	I choose poetry because it's so visceral.
194.641	When someone is standing in front of you,
194.641	mind, body and soul,
197.975	"saying ""Witness me,"""
199.2	it's impossible not to become
199.2	keenly aware of your own humanity.
203.413	This changed everything for me.
205.237	It gave me courage.
207.703	Every day I experience
207.703	the power of witness,
210.318	and because of that, I am whole.
212.443	And so now I ask:
213.949	Will you witness me?
217.221	They hand me the microphone
219.279	as my shoulders sink
219.279	under the weight of this stress.
224.163	The woman says,
226.145	"""The one millionth refugee"
226.145	just left South Sudan.
228.61	"Can you comment?"""
230.091	I feel my feet rock back and forth
230.091	on the heels my mother bought,
234.135	begging the question:
235.337	Do we stay, or is it safer
235.337	to choose flight?
238.646	My mind echoes the numbers:
241.561	one million gone,
243.248	two million displaced,
247.638	And this lump takes over my throat,
249.368	as if each of those bodies
249.368	just found a grave
252.014	right here in my esophagus.
254.413	Our once country,
255.588	all north and south and east and west,
257.842	so restless the Nile couldn't
257.842	hold us together,
260.784	and you ask me to summarize.
263.174	They talk about the numbers
263.174	as if this isn't still happening,
266.233	as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,
269.474	as if 3,000 aren't still making
269.474	their final stand
272.392	at the bottom of the Mediterranean,
275.58	as if there aren't entire volumes
275.58	full of fact sheets about our genocides,
280.343	and now they want me to write one.
283.074	Fact:
285.703	we never talked over breakfast,
287.989	because the warplanes
287.989	would swallow our voices.
290.728	Fact:
292.33	my grandfather didn't want to leave home,
294.818	so he died in a war zone.
297.467	Fact:
298.831	a burning bush without God is just a fire.
302.472	I measure the distance between what I know
304.682	and what is safe to say on a microphone.
306.956	Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?
309.874	Do I mention the violence,
311.291	how it's never as simple
311.291	as what you see on TV,
313.995	how there are weeks' worth of fear
313.995	before the camera is on?
319.474	Do I tell her about our bodies,
322.118	how they are 60 percent water,
323.593	but we still burn like driftwood,
325.534	making fuel of our sacrifice?
327.44	Do I tell her the men died first,
327.44	mothers forced to watch the slaughter?
331.572	That they came for our children,
333.198	scattering them across the continent
333.198	until our homes sank?
336.376	That even castles sink
336.376	at the bite of the bomb?
341.593	Do I talk about the elderly,
343.484	our heroes,
345.143	too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,
347.778	how they would march them,
349.185	hands raised, rifles at their backs,
351.456	into the fire?
352.636	How their walking sticks
352.636	kept the flames alive?
354.93	It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires
354.93	and an audience to swallow.
360.138	Too relentless,
361.598	like the valley that filled
361.598	with the putrid smoke of our deaths.
365.481	Is it better in verse?
367.934	Can a stanza become a burial shroud?
370.659	Will it sting less if I say it softly?
372.514	If you don't see me cry,
372.514	will you listen better?
374.841	Will the pain leave
374.841	when the microphone does?
376.981	Why does every word feel
376.981	as if I'm saying my last?
382.076	Thirty seconds for the sound bite,
384.267	and now three minutes for the poem.
387.14	My tongue goes dry the same way we died,
391.228	becoming ash, having never been coal.
396.131	I feel my left leg go numb,
398.441	and I realize that I locked my knees,
401.322	bracing for impact.
403.557	I never wear shoes I can't run in.
408.15	Thank you.
409.808	(Applause)
416.667	So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,
420.928	because that's the paradox
420.928	that this life has been:
424.428	in the places where I learned
424.428	to cry the most,
427.452	I also learned how to smile after.
431.435	So, here goes.
436.657	"""You Have a Big Imagination"
440.145	or
446.254	For Zeinab.
448.604	I am a sad girl,
451.145	but my face makes other plans,
453.854	focusing energy on this smile,
453.854	so as not to waste it on pain.
458.7	The first thing they took was my sleep,
461.247	eyes heavy but wide open,
463.589	thinking maybe I missed something,
465.637	maybe the cavalry is still coming.
467.835	They didn't come,
469.104	so I bought bigger pillows.
470.94	(Laughter)
473.328	My grandmother could cure anything
477.056	by talking the life out of it.
479.667	And she said that I could make
479.667	a thief in a silo laugh
482.956	in the middle of our raging war.
485.06	War makes a broken marriage bed
485.06	out of sorrow.
490.018	You want nothing more than to disappear,
492.223	but your heart can't salvage
492.223	enough remnants to leave.
496.668	But joy --
498.036	joy is the armor we carried across
498.036	the borders of our broken homeland.
504.507	A hasty mix of stories and faces
508.083	that lasts long after the flavor is gone.
511.838	A muscle memory that overcomes
511.838	even the most bitter of times,
515.772	my memory is spotted with
515.772	days of laughing until I cried,
520.345	or crying until I laughed.
522.004	Laughter and tears are both
522.004	involuntary human reactions,
525.997	testaments to our capacity for expression.
529.194	So allow me to express
531.051	that if I make you laugh,
532.765	it's usually on purpose.
534.868	And if I make you cry,
536.619	I'll still think you are beautiful.
539.087	This is for my cousin Zeinab,
542.516	bedridden on a random afternoon.
545.951	I hadn't seen her since the last time
545.951	we were in Sudan together,
550.001	and there I was at her hospital bedside
553.979	in a 400-year-old building in France.
558.867	Zeinab wanted to hear poems.
561.999	Suddenly, English, Arabic
561.999	and French were not enough.
566.073	Every word I knew became empty noise,
569.484	"and Zeinab said, ""Well, get on with it."""
571.782	(Laughter)
572.883	And I read her everything that I could,
576.069	and we laughed,
577.429	and we loved it,
578.609	and it was the most important stage
578.609	that I've ever stood on,
582.608	surrounded by family,
584.443	by remnants of a people who were given
584.443	as a dowry to a relentless war
589.243	but still managed
589.243	to make pearls of this life;
592.723	by the ones who taught me
592.723	to not only laugh,
596.463	but to live in the face of death;
599.357	who placed their hands across the sky,
601.787	measuring the distance to the sun
601.787	"and saying, ""Smile;"
605.178	"I'm gonna meet you there."""
607.618	And for Zeinab --
609.942	Zeinab, who taught me love
609.942	in a place like France,
614.244	Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar
614.244	poems on her deathbed --
620.291	Dilated fibromyalgia.
623.603	Her heart muscles expanded
626.758	until they couldn't function.
629.01	And she held me,
629.01	and she made me feel like gold.
632.907	"And I said, ""Zeinab,"
635.301	isn't it strange that your only problem
638.845	"is that your heart was too big?"""
644.24	Thank you.
645.463	(Applause)
