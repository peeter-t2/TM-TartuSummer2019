16.204	So, people want a lot of things out of life,
18.826	but I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.
22.721	"Aristotle called happiness ""the chief good,"" the end"
26.049	towards which all other things aim.
29.321	According to this view, the reason we want a big house
34.841	or a nice car
37.474	or a good job
39.554	isn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
42.002	It's that we expect them to bring us
44.52	happiness.
45.977	Now in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten
48.609	a lot of the things that we want. We're richer.
50.636	We live longer. We have access to technology
53.713	that would have seemed like science fiction
55.88	just a few years ago.
58.121	The paradox of happiness is that even though the
60.545	objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,
63.447	we haven't actually gotten any happier.
67.011	Maybe because these conventional notions of progress
69.93	haven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,
72.406	there's been an increased interest in recent years
74.536	in happiness itself.
77.058	People have been debating the causes of happiness
79.093	for a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,
81.692	but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.
85.149	Well, as with many other domains in life, I think
87.208	the scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
90.42	In fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion
92.954	in research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot
95.755	about its demographics, how things like income
98.867	and education, gender and marriage relate to it.
102.293	But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that
104.515	factors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.
107.454	Yes, it's better to make more money rather than less,
109.891	or to graduate from college instead of dropping out,
112.603	but the differences in happiness tend to be small.
115.364	Which leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?
119.199	I think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,
121.896	but I think something that has the potential to be an answer
124.608	is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with
127.329	the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
129.773	It certainly seems that we're going about our lives,
131.768	that what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,
135.703	have a big influence on our happiness, and yet
138.055	these are the very factors that have been very difficult,
140.288	in fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
142.675	A few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness
145.736	moment to moment as they're going about their daily lives
148.315	on a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never
151.057	been able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,
153.848	it uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.
158.134	How does this work? Basically, I send people signals
160.923	at random points throughout the day, and then I ask them
163.363	a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience
165.651	at the instant just before the signal.
168.185	The idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness
170.992	goes up and down over the course of the day,
173.616	minute to minute in some cases,
175.344	and try to understand how what people are doing,
177.486	who they're with, what they're thinking about, and all
180.329	the other factors that describe our day, how those might
182.505	relate to those changes in happiness, we might be able
185.216	to discover some of the things that really have
186.762	a big influence on happiness.
189.067	We've been fortunate with this project to collect
191.373	quite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think
194.231	has ever been collected before,
196.09	over 650,000 real-time reports
199.311	from over 15,000 people.
202.19	And it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,
205.299	people from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,
208.786	a wide range of incomes, education levels,
211.714	people who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.
214.777	They collectively represent every one of
221.902	What I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today
224.804	is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been
226.933	investigating, and that's mind-wandering.
230.116	As human beings, we have this unique ability
232.516	to have our minds stray away from the present.
235.451	This guy is sitting here working on his computer,
237.376	and yet he could be thinking about
238.43	the vacation he had last month,
241.119	wondering what he's going to have for dinner.
243.082	Maybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)
246.915	This ability to focus our attention on something other
249.7	than the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn
252.955	and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
257.449	And yet it's not clear what the relationship is
259.847	between our use of this ability and our happiness.
263.763	You've probably heard people suggest that you should
265.621	"stay focused on the present. ""Be here now,"""
268.112	you've probably heard a hundred times.
269.597	Maybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely
272.278	immersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
275.789	Maybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering
277.623	is a bad thing.
279.353	On the other hand, when our minds wander,
281.772	they're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality
284.433	in front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.
287.821	Since we know people want to be happy, maybe
289.634	when our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place
292.325	that they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.
294.558	In other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind
296.056	allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
300.482	Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to
302.493	resolve this debate with some data, and in particular
305.17	I'd like to present some data to you from three questions
307.658	that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from
309.868	sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
312.52	There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:
315.55	How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad
318.425	to very good? Second, an activity question:
322.564	What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities
325.092	including things like eating and working and watching TV?
328.317	And finally a mind-wandering question:
331.905	Are you thinking about something other
334.547	than what you're currently doing?
337.17	People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --
340.612	or yes -- I am thinking about something else --
343.141	and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,
345.597	neutral or unpleasant.
347.023	Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
352.482	So what did we find?
354.947	This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,
357.246	and you can see that bar there representing how happy
359.486	people are when they're focused on the present,
360.819	when they're not mind-wandering.
362.742	As it turns out, people are substantially less happy
366.461	when their minds are wandering than when they're not.
371.197	Now you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,
373.799	on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,
376.221	but surely when their minds are straying away
377.889	from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,
380.008	at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
383.772	Nope. As it turns out,
386.471	people are less happy when they're mind-wandering
388.163	no matter what they're doing. For example,
391.189	people don't really like commuting to work very much.
393.366	It's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet
396.126	they are substantially happier when they're focused
398.66	only on their commute than when their mind is going
401.022	off to something else.
404.069	It's amazing.
405.851	So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,
409.696	a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,
412.094	we often think about unpleasant things, and they are
414.95	enormously less happy when they do that,
418.557	our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,
421.222	and yet even when people are thinking about something
424.182	neutral, they're still considerably less happy
427.046	than when they're not mind-wandering at all.
429.023	Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,
431.858	they're actually just slightly less happy
434.062	than when they aren't mind-wandering.
437.319	If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like
439.381	having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars
442.414	or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)
448.565	So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,
451.238	that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all
454.05	I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
456.817	It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case
459.602	that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.
462.056	Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever
464.425	disentangle these two possibilites?
467.514	Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact
469.858	you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not
472.815	backward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.
476.812	We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,
480.242	and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering
483.438	tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness
485.931	tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight
488.114	into the causal direction.
490.275	As it turns out, there is a strong relationship between
493.484	mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,
497.169	consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
500.888	In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy
504.048	now and mind-wandering a short time later.
507.057	In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be
509.379	an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.
515.219	A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering
517.443	to a slot machine you'd never want to play.
519.706	Well, how often do people's minds wander?
522.01	Turns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.
526.467	Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking
529.161	about something other than what they're currently doing.
532.568	How does that depend on what people are doing?
535.006	This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities
537.759	ranging from a high of 65 percent — (Laughter) —
541.758	when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,
544.27	to 50 percent when they're working,
547.171	to 40 percent when they're exercising,
550.214	all the way down to this one short bar on the right
552.133	that I think some of you are probably laughing at.
554.121	Ten percent of the time people's minds are wandering
556.511	when they're having sex. (Laughter)
561.082	But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,
564.015	and that is, basically with one exception,
567.063	no matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering
569.241	at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,
572.919	that mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.
575.75	It pervades basically everything that we do.
579.483	In my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,
582.679	a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important
584.729	in the equation for happiness.
586.385	My hope is that over time, by tracking people's
588.4	moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences
591.448	in daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,
594.85	and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness
597.78	will help us create a future that's not only richer
600.477	and healthier, but happier as well.
603.339	Thank you. (Applause)
606.563	(Applause)
