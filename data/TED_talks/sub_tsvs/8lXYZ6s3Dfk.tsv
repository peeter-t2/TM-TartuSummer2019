16.093	When I graduated UCLA, I moved to northern California,
19.657	and I lived in a little town called Elk
21.906	on the Mendocino coast,
23.893	and I didn't have a phone or TV, but I had U.S. mail,
28.451	and life was good back then, if you could remember it.
32.186	I'd go to the general store for a cup of coffee
34.908	and a brownie, and I'd ship my film
37.594	to San Francisco, and lo and behold, two days later,
42.329	it would end up on my front door,
44.125	which was way better than having to fight the traffic
47.155	of Hollywood. (Music)
49.069	I didn't have much money,
53.057	but I had time and a sense of wonder. (Music)
55.984	So I started shooting time-lapse photography.
58.872	It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute
61.637	roll of film, because that's all I could afford.
66.219	I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously,
68.693	non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
71.73	for over 30 years, and to see them move
74.513	is a dance I'll never get tired of.
78.559	Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
83.458	It also provides a third of the food we eat.
86.641	(Music)
89.104	Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival,
93.249	because we protect what we fall in love with.
96.36	It opens our hearts, and makes us realize
98.285	we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.
103.27	When we see ourselves in nature, it also connects us
107.354	to every one of us, because it's clear
109.578	that it's all connected in one.
112.633	When people see my images, a lot of times they'll say,
116.017	"""Oh my God."" Have you ever wondered what that meant?"
120.297	"The ""oh"" means it caught your attention,"
122.858	makes you present, makes you mindful.
126.025	"The ""my"" means it connects with something deep"
128.609	inside your soul.
130.881	It creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up
133.625	"and be heard. And ""God""?"
136.617	God is that personal journey we all want to be on,
140.225	to be inspired, to feel like we're connected to a universe
144.9	that celebrates life.
148.02	Did you know that 80 percent
150.71	of the information we receive comes through our eyes?
154.521	And if you compare light energy to musical scales,
157.623	it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see,
160.649	which is right in the middle?
163.209	And aren't we grateful for our brains that can, you know,
166.033	take this electrical impulse that comes from light energy
169.081	to create images in order for us to explore our world?
174.401	And aren't we grateful that we have hearts
175.956	that can feel these vibrations
178.202	in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure
181.794	and the beauty of nature?
184.571	(Music)
188.794	Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates
191.864	appreciation and gratitude.
194.222	(Music)
197.982	So I have a gift I want to share with you today,
200.665	a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed,
204.046	and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective
207.094	from the point of view of a child and an elderly man
210.692	of that world.
215.348	Child: When I watch TV,
220.308	it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend,
225.752	and when you explore, you get
228.51	more imagination than you already had,
233.118	and when you get more imagination,
236.374	it makes you want to go deeper in
238.741	so you can get more and see beautifuller things,
241.832	like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach,
248.41	or something, and it could be beautiful.
250.909	(Music)
279.845	Elderly Man: You think this is just another day in your life?
286.827	It's not just another day. It's the one day that is given to you
293.357	today.
297.103	It's given to you. It's a gift.
303.007	It's the only gift that you have right now,
307.357	and the only appropriate response
310.261	is gratefulness.
320.616	If you do nothing else but to cultivate that response
327.348	to the great gift that this unique day is,
331.964	if you learn to respond
334.781	as if it were the first day in your life
338.773	and the very last day,
341.457	then you will have spent this day very well.
349.901	Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised
353.73	that you have eyes you can open,
357.557	that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us
362.836	for pure enjoyment.
366.518	Look at the sky.
369.966	We so rarely look at the sky.
373.426	We so rarely note how different it is
378.597	from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.
383.693	We just think of the weather,
386.419	and even with the weather, we don't think of
388.559	all the many nuances of weather.
391.782	We just think of good weather and bad weather.
395.907	This day, right now, has unique weather,
400.619	maybe a kind that will never exactly
403.687	in that form come again.
406.475	That formation of clouds in the sky will never be the same
410.451	as it is right now.
413.665	Open your eyes. Look at that.
418.93	Look at the faces of people whom you meet.
423.575	Each one has an incredible story behind their face,
430.998	a story that you could never fully fathom,
437.374	not only their own story, but the story of their ancestors.
444.711	We all go back so far,
447.855	and in this present moment, on this day,
452.085	all the people you meet, all that life from generations
457.249	and from so many places all over the world
461.415	flows together and meets you here
464.767	like a life-giving water, if you only open your heart and drink.
471	(Music)
477.847	Open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization
483.214	gives to us.
485.133	You flip a switch and there is electric light.
489.211	You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water,
495.019	and drinkable water.
497.17	It's a gift that millions and millions in the world
501.681	will never experience.
505.097	So these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts
509.82	to which we can open your heart.
513.352	And so I wish you that you will open your heart
517.15	to all these blessings, and let them flow through you,
523.53	that everyone whom you will meet on this day
526.521	will be blessed by you,
530.543	just by your eyes,
534.02	by your smile,
537.446	by your touch,
540.882	just by your presence.
545.23	Let the gratefulness overflow
549.083	into blessing all around you,
555.349	and then it will really be a good day. (Music)
570.813	(Applause)
571.712	Louie Schwartzberg: Thank you.
574.653	Thank you very much. (Applause)
