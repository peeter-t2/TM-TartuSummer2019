14.183	Thank you very much.
17.105	I moved to America 12 years ago
17.105	with my wife Terry and our two kids.
21.53	Actually, truthfully, we moved
21.53	to Los Angeles --
24.34	(Laughter)
27.788	thinking we were moving
27.788	to America, but anyway --
30.146	(Laughter)
32.827	It's a short plane ride
32.827	from Los Angeles to America.
37.109	(Laughter)
39.304	I got here 12 years ago,
41.059	and when I got here,
41.059	I was told various things,
44.869	"like, ""Americans don't get irony."""
48.628	(Laughter)
50.792	Have you come across this idea?
53.038	It's not true.
54.221	I've traveled the whole length
54.221	and breadth of this country.
57.007	I have found no evidence
57.007	that Americans don't get irony.
59.657	It's one of those cultural myths,
62.258	"like, ""The British are reserved."""
64.48	(Laughter)
66.393	I don't know why people think this.
68.455	We've invaded every country
68.455	we've encountered.
70.966	(Laughter)
74.818	But it's not true Americans
74.818	don't get irony,
77.126	but I just want you to know
77.126	that that's what people
79.622	are saying about you behind your back.
81.456	You know, so when you leave
81.456	living rooms in Europe,
84.416	people say, thankfully,
84.416	nobody was ironic in your presence.
87.647	(Laughter)
89.058	But I knew that Americans get irony
91.619	when I came across that legislation,
91.619	"""No Child Left Behind."""
95.368	(Laughter)
97.174	Because whoever thought
97.174	of that title gets irony.
100.799	(Laughter)
102.561	Don't they?
104.043	(Applause)
109.866	Because it's leaving
109.866	millions of children behind.
113.413	Now I can see that's not a very attractive
113.413	name for legislation:
116.749	"""Millions of Children Left Behind."""
118.495	I can see that.
120.264	What's the plan?
121.485	We propose to leave
121.485	millions of children behind,
124.273	and here's how it's going to work.
126.035	And it's working beautifully.
127.445	(Laughter)
128.476	In some parts of the country,
	of high school.
133.677	In the Native American communities,
135.368	it's 80 percent of kids.
137.777	If we halved that number,
140.368	one estimate is it would create
140.368	a net gain to the U.S. economy
146.05	over 10 years,
146.05	of nearly a trillion dollars.
151.28	From an economic point of view,
152.857	this is good math, isn't it,
152.857	that we should do this?
155.789	It actually costs an enormous amount
158.138	to mop up the damage
158.138	from the dropout crisis.
162.3	But the dropout crisis
162.3	is just the tip of an iceberg.
166.029	What it doesn't count
166.029	are all the kids who are in school
168.72	but being disengaged
168.72	from it, who don't enjoy it,
172.282	who don't get any real benefit from it.
175.622	And the reason is not
175.622	that we're not spending enough money.
178.614	America spends more money on education
178.614	than most other countries.
182.103	Class sizes are smaller
182.103	than in many countries.
185.681	And there are hundreds
185.681	of initiatives every year
187.967	to try and improve education.
190.244	The trouble is, it's all going
190.244	in the wrong direction.
194.765	There are three principles
194.765	on which human life flourishes,
199.364	and they are contradicted
199.364	by the culture of education
203.375	under which most teachers have to labor
205.652	and most students have to endure.
209.207	The first is this, that human beings
209.207	are naturally different and diverse.
216.387	Can I ask you, how many of you
216.387	have got children of your own?
220.892	Okay. Or grandchildren.
223.905	How about two children or more? Right.
227.645	And the rest of you
227.645	have seen such children.
229.765	(Laughter)
232.525	Small people wandering about.
234.039	(Laughter)
235.785	I will make you a bet,
237.636	and I am confident
237.636	that I will win the bet.
239.708	If you've got two children or more,
241.551	I bet you they are completely
241.551	different from each other.
245.38	Aren't they?
247.825	(Applause)
249.751	You would never confuse them, would you?
252.354	"Like, ""Which one are you? Remind me."""
254.418	(Laughter)
257.252	"""Your mother and I need"
257.252	some color-coding system
259.689	"so we don't get confused."""
262.052	"Education under ""No Child Left Behind"""
264.995	is based on not diversity but conformity.
269.818	What schools are encouraged
269.818	to do is to find out
272.376	what kids can do across
272.376	a very narrow spectrum of achievement.
276.736	One of the effects
276.736	"of ""No Child Left Behind"""
279.428	has been to narrow the focus
279.428	onto the so-called STEM disciplines.
283.201	They're very important.
284.835	I'm not here to argue
284.835	against science and math.
287.098	On the contrary, they're necessary
287.098	but they're not sufficient.
291.178	A real education has to give equal weight
293.377	to the arts, the humanities,
293.377	to physical education.
297.114	An awful lot of kids, sorry, thank you --
299.562	(Applause)
304.688	One estimate in America currently
304.688	is that something like 10 percent of kids,
308.575	getting on that way,
310.09	are being diagnosed
310.09	with various conditions
314.18	under the broad title
314.18	of attention deficit disorder.
318.502	ADHD.
320.234	I'm not saying there's no such thing.
322.699	I just don't believe
322.699	it's an epidemic like this.
325.154	If you sit kids down, hour after hour,
327.97	doing low-grade clerical work,
331.306	don't be surprised if they start
331.306	to fidget, you know?
334.435	(Laughter)
335.887	(Applause)
342.089	Children are not, for the most part,
342.089	suffering from a psychological condition.
346.248	They're suffering from childhood.
348.261	(Laughter)
352.379	And I know this because
352.379	I spent my early life as a child.
355.311	I went through the whole thing.
358.705	Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum
358.705	that celebrates their various talents,
363.723	not just a small range of them.
365.36	And by the way, the arts
365.36	aren't just important
367.583	because they improve math scores.
369.217	They're important because they speak
369.217	to parts of children's being
372.358	which are otherwise untouched.
374.312	The second, thank you --
376.144	(Applause)
380.562	The second principle
380.562	that drives human life flourishing
384.725	is curiosity.
386.512	If you can light the spark
386.512	of curiosity in a child,
389.9	they will learn without any further
389.9	assistance, very often.
393.563	Children are natural learners.
395.548	It's a real achievement
395.548	to put that particular ability out,
399.864	or to stifle it.
402.155	Curiosity is the engine of achievement.
406.392	Now the reason I say this
407.769	is because one of the effects
407.769	of the current culture here,
411.968	if I can say so,
413.194	has been to de-professionalize teachers.
416.876	There is no system in the world
416.876	or any school in the country
422.212	that is better than its teachers.
425.028	Teachers are the lifeblood
425.028	of the success of schools.
429.723	But teaching is a creative profession.
432.814	Teaching, properly conceived,
432.814	is not a delivery system.
436.174	You know, you're not there just
436.174	to pass on received information.
439.246	Great teachers do that,
441.498	but what great teachers also do is mentor,
444.567	stimulate, provoke, engage.
447.936	You see, in the end,
447.936	education is about learning.
450.881	If there's no learning going on,
450.881	there's no education going on.
453.995	And people can spend an awful lot of time
455.992	discussing education
455.992	without ever discussing learning.
458.589	The whole point of education
458.589	is to get people to learn.
461.186	An old friend of mine --
461.186	actually very old, he's dead.
464.976	(Laughter)
467.672	That's as old as it gets, I'm afraid.
470.173	(Laughter)
473.96	But a wonderful guy he was,
473.96	wonderful philosopher.
478.737	He used to talk about the difference
481.036	between the task
481.036	and achievement senses of verbs.
485.818	You can be engaged
485.818	in the activity of something,
488.165	but not really be
488.165	achieving it, like dieting.
491.086	(Laughter)
492.111	It's a very good example.
493.865	There he is. He's dieting.
495.236	Is he losing any weight? Not really.
497.129	(Laughter)
498.745	Teaching is a word like that.
500.236	"You can say, ""There's Deborah,"
500.236	"she's in room 34, she's teaching."""
503.902	But if nobody's learning anything,
505.775	she may be engaged in the task of teaching
505.775	but not actually fulfilling it.
510.419	The role of a teacher
510.419	is to facilitate learning.
513.408	That's it.
514.679	And part of the problem is, I think,
516.579	that the dominant culture
516.579	of education has come to focus
520.035	on not teaching and learning, but testing.
523.884	Now, testing is important.
525.485	Standardized tests have a place.
527.798	But they should not be
527.798	the dominant culture of education.
530.715	They should be diagnostic.
530.715	They should help.
532.835	(Applause)
540.247	If I go for a medical examination,
540.247	I want some standardized tests.
545.162	I do.
546.387	I want to know
546.387	what my cholesterol level is
548.498	compared to everybody else's
548.498	on a standard scale.
550.879	I don't want to be told on some scale
550.879	my doctor invented in the car.
554.145	(Laughter)
556.246	"""Your cholesterol"
556.246	"is what I call Level Orange."""
558.493	"""Really?"""
559.7	(Laughter)
561.501	"""Is that good?"" ""We don't know."""
563.168	(Laughter)
564.746	But all that should support learning.
567.336	It shouldn't obstruct it,
567.336	which of course it often does.
571.275	So in place of curiosity,
571.275	what we have is a culture of compliance.
575.975	Our children and teachers are encouraged
575.975	to follow routine algorithms
581.499	rather than to excite that power
581.499	of imagination and curiosity.
586.06	And the third principle is this:
586.06	that human life is inherently creative.
590.065	It's why we all have different résumés.
592.453	We create our lives,
594.094	and we can recreate them
594.094	as we go through them.
596.697	It's the common currency
596.697	of being a human being.
599.302	It's why human culture
599.302	is so interesting and diverse and dynamic.
603.469	I mean, other animals may well have
603.469	imaginations and creativity,
607.33	but it's not so much
607.33	in evidence, is it, as ours?
610.062	I mean, you may have a dog.
612.78	And your dog may get depressed.
615.644	You know, but it doesn't listen
615.644	to Radiohead, does it?
618.24	(Laughter)
622.019	And sit staring out the window
622.019	with a bottle of Jack Daniels.
624.948	(Laughter)
629.145	"""Would you like to come for a walk?"""
630.971	"""No, I'm fine."""
632.196	(Laughter)
633.954	"""You go. I'll wait. But take pictures."""
637.795	(Laughter)
639.66	We all create our own lives
639.66	through this restless process
642.433	of imagining alternatives
642.433	and possibilities,
644.553	and one of the roles of education
647.019	is to awaken and develop
647.019	these powers of creativity.
650.717	Instead, what we have
650.717	is a culture of standardization.
654.417	Now, it doesn't have to be that way.
656.663	It really doesn't.
658.637	Finland regularly comes out on top
658.637	in math, science and reading.
663.341	Now, we only know
663.341	that's what they do well at,
665.635	because that's all that's being tested.
667.791	That's one of the problems of the test.
669.673	They don't look for other things
669.673	that matter just as much.
672.752	The thing about work in Finland is this:
676.102	they don't obsess about those disciplines.
678.474	They have a very broad
678.474	approach to education,
680.594	which includes humanities,
680.594	physical education, the arts.
685.064	Second, there is no standardized
685.064	testing in Finland.
690.511	I mean, there's a bit,
692.152	but it's not what gets
692.152	people up in the morning,
694.462	what keeps them at their desks.
696.342	The third thing --
696.342	and I was at a meeting recently
698.722	with some people from Finland,
698.722	actual Finnish people,
701.287	and somebody from the American system
701.287	was saying to the people in Finland,
706.183	"""What do you do"
706.183	"about the drop-out rate in Finland?"""
709.782	And they all looked a bit
709.782	bemused, and said,
712.212	"""Well, we don't have one."
714.522	Why would you drop out?
716.591	If people are in trouble,
716.591	we get to them quite quickly
719.165	"and we help and support them."""
720.657	Now people always say,
722.248	"""Well, you know, you can't compare"
722.248	"Finland to America."""
725.463	No. I think there's a population
725.463	of around five million in Finland.
729.23	But you can compare it
729.23	to a state in America.
732.815	Many states in America
732.815	have fewer people in them than that.
736.719	I mean, I've been
736.719	to some states in America
738.791	and I was the only person there.
740.372	(Laughter)
742.199	Really. Really.
744.824	I was asked to lock up when I left.
746.802	(Laughter)
750.897	But what all the high-performing
750.897	systems in the world do
754.83	is currently what is not evident, sadly,
758.718	across the systems in America --
760.983	I mean, as a whole.
762.703	One is this:
764.036	they individualize teaching and learning.
767.797	They recognize that it's students
767.797	who are learning
771.454	and the system has to engage them,
773.61	their curiosity, their individuality,
773.61	and their creativity.
777.305	That's how you get them to learn.
779.57	The second is that they attribute
779.57	a very high status
783.784	to the teaching profession.
786.353	They recognize
786.353	that you can't improve education
789.009	if you don't pick great people to teach
789.009	and keep giving them
792.002	constant support
792.002	and professional development.
794.501	Investing in professional
794.501	development is not a cost.
797.219	It's an investment,
798.832	and every other country
798.832	that's succeeding well knows that,
801.601	whether it's Australia, Canada,
804.055	South Korea, Singapore,
804.055	Hong Kong or Shanghai.
808.506	They know that to be the case.
810.195	And the third is,
811.585	they devolve responsibility
811.585	to the school level
815.339	for getting the job done.
817.243	You see, there's a big difference here
819.372	between going into a mode of command
819.372	and control in education --
823.385	That's what happens in some systems.
825.137	Central or state governments decide,
827.76	they know best and they're going
827.76	to tell you what to do.
830.799	The trouble is that education
830.799	doesn't go on
834.318	in the committee rooms
834.318	of our legislative buildings.
837.25	It happens in classrooms and schools,
840.284	and the people who do it
840.284	are the teachers and the students,
843.357	and if you remove their discretion,
843.357	it stops working.
847.117	You have to put it back to the people.
849.815	(Applause)
854.991	There is wonderful work
854.991	happening in this country.
857.918	But I have to say it's happening
859.499	in spite of the dominant
859.499	culture of education,
862.065	not because of it.
863.466	It's like people are sailing
863.466	into a headwind all the time.
867.07	And the reason I think is this:
869.732	that many of the current policies
871.764	are based on mechanistic
871.764	conceptions of education.
875.909	It's like education
875.909	is an industrial process
879.677	that can be improved
879.677	just by having better data,
882.684	and somewhere in the back of the mind
882.684	of some policy makers
885.624	is this idea that if we fine-tune it
885.624	well enough, if we just get it right,
889.758	it will all hum along perfectly
889.758	into the future.
892.576	It won't, and it never did.
895.805	The point is that education
895.805	is not a mechanical system.
899.756	It's a human system.
901.927	It's about people,
903.88	people who either do want
903.88	to learn or don't want to learn.
906.708	Every student who drops
906.708	out of school has a reason for it
911.523	which is rooted in their own biography.
913.844	They may find it boring.
915.446	They may find it irrelevant.
917.166	They may find that it's at odds with
917.166	the life they're living outside of school.
922.286	There are trends,
922.286	but the stories are always unique.
926.087	I was at a meeting recently
926.087	in Los Angeles of --
928.765	they're called alternative
928.765	education programs.
931.224	These are programs designed
931.224	to get kids back into education.
934.552	They have certain common features.
936.357	They're very personalized.
938.548	They have strong support for the teachers,
941.984	close links with the community
941.984	and a broad and diverse curriculum,
945.551	and often programs which involve students
945.551	outside school as well as inside school.
950.79	And they work.
952.674	What's interesting to me is,
952.674	"these are called ""alternative education."""
956.371	(Laughter)
957.443	You know?
959.714	And all the evidence
959.714	from around the world is,
961.933	if we all did that, there'd be
961.933	no need for the alternative.
965.406	(Applause)
973.135	(Applause ends)
974.16	So I think we have to embrace
974.16	a different metaphor.
976.664	We have to recognize
976.664	that it's a human system,
979.197	and there are conditions
979.197	under which people thrive,
983.077	and conditions under which they don't.
985.698	We are after all organic creatures,
988.969	and the culture of the school
988.969	is absolutely essential.
993.269	Culture is an organic term, isn't it?
995.937	Not far from where I live
995.937	is a place called Death Valley.
999.627	Death Valley is the hottest,
999.627	driest place in America,
1005.291	and nothing grows there.
1008.219	Nothing grows there
1008.219	because it doesn't rain.
1010.664	Hence, Death Valley.
1012.917	In the winter of 2004,
1012.917	it rained in Death Valley.
1020.064	Seven inches of rain fell
1020.064	over a very short period.
1024.01	And in the spring of 2005,
1024.01	there was a phenomenon.
1029.038	The whole floor of Death Valley
1029.038	was carpeted in flowers for a while.
1035.664	What it proved is this:
1037.45	that Death Valley isn't dead.
1041.424	It's dormant.
1043.569	Right beneath the surface
1043.569	are these seeds of possibility
1047.051	waiting for the right conditions
1047.051	to come about,
1050.613	and with organic systems,
1050.613	if the conditions are right,
1054.099	life is inevitable.
1056.29	It happens all the time.
1057.685	You take an area, a school, a district,
1060.27	you change the conditions, give people
1060.27	a different sense of possibility,
1063.698	a different set of expectations,
1063.698	a broader range of opportunities,
1066.84	you cherish and value the relationships
1066.84	between teachers and learners,
1070.15	you offer people
1070.15	the discretion to be creative
1072.365	and to innovate in what they do,
1074.208	and schools that were once
1074.208	bereft spring to life.
1077.669	Great leaders know that.
1079.662	The real role of leadership
1079.662	in education --
1081.787	and I think it's true
1081.787	at the national level,
1083.908	the state level, at the school level --
1085.902	is not and should not be
1085.902	command and control.
1090.302	The real role of leadership
1090.302	is climate control,
1094.549	creating a climate of possibility.
1096.852	And if you do that, people will rise to it
1099.306	and achieve things
1099.306	that you completely did not anticipate
1102.539	and couldn't have expected.
1104.506	There's a wonderful quote
1104.506	from Benjamin Franklin.
1106.883	"""There are three sorts"
1106.883	of people in the world:
1109.486	Those who are immovable,
1112.026	people who don't get it,
1113.273	or don't want to do anything about it;
1115.168	there are people who are movable,
1116.904	people who see the need for change
1118.548	and are prepared to listen to it;
1120.872	and there are people who move,
1122.723	"people who make things happen."""
1124.796	And if we can encourage more people,
1124.796	that will be a movement.
1129.339	And if the movement is strong enough,
1131.526	that's, in the best sense
1131.526	of the word, a revolution.
1134.866	And that's what we need.
1136.447	Thank you very much.
1137.68	(Applause)
1141.569	Thank you very much.
1142.819	(Applause)
