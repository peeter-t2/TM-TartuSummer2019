13.683	This is a work in process,
16.617	based on some comments
16.617	that were made at TED two years ago
21.176	about the need for the storage of vaccine.
24.849	(Video): [On this planet
26.493	1.6 billion people
29.032	don't have access to electricity
31.021	refrigeration
35.18	or stored fuels
38.16	this is a problem
41.619	it impacts:
44.425	the spread of disease
47.671	the storage of food and medicine
49.503	and the quality of life.
53.43	So here's the plan ...
53.43	inexpensive refrigeration
55.719	that doesn't use electricity,
55.719	propane, gas, kerosene or consumables
61.159	time for some thermodynamics
63.675	And the story of the Intermittent
63.675	Absorption Refrigerator]
66.421	Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago,
66.421	I had this thermo teacher
69.071	who talked about absorption
69.071	and refrigeration, one of those things
72.198	that stuck in my head, a lot
72.198	like the Stirling engine:
74.75	it was cool, but you didn't know
74.75	what to do with it.
77.225	It was invented in 1858,
77.225	by this guy Ferdinand Carr√©,
79.799	but he couldn't actually build
79.799	anything with it
82.088	because of the tools at the time.
83.733	This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley
83.733	commercialized this thing
87.997	called the IcyBall, in 1928.
90.021	It was a really neat idea,
90.021	and I'll get to why it didn't work,
93.086	but here's how it works.
94.284	There's two spheres
94.284	and they're separated in distance.
96.884	One has a working fluid,
96.884	water and ammonia,
99.264	and the other is a condenser.
100.876	You heat up one side, the hot side.
102.865	The ammonia evaporates
102.865	and it recondenses in the other side.
105.908	You let it cool to room temperature,
108.47	and then, as the ammonia reevaporates
108.47	and combines with the water
111.657	back on the erstwhile hot side,
113.284	it creates a powerful cooling effect.
115.577	So it was a great idea
115.577	that didn't work at all.
118.018	They blew up.
119.236	(Laughter)
120.795	Because you're using ammonia,
120.795	you get hugely high pressures
123.606	if you heated them wrong;
124.897	it topped 400 psi.
126.676	The ammonia was toxic,
126.676	it sprayed everywhere.
128.84	But it was kind of an interesting thought.
131.036	So the great thing about 2006,
133.492	there's a lot of really great
133.492	computational work you can do.
136.371	So we got the whole thermodynamics
136.371	department at Stanford involved --
140.47	a lot of computational fluid dynamics.
142.324	We proved that most of the ammonia
142.324	refrigeration tables are wrong.
146.283	We found some nontoxic refrigerants
148.36	that worked at very low vapor pressures.
150.962	We brought in a team from the UK --
152.675	a lot of great refrigeration people,
152.675	it turns out, in the UK --
155.674	and built a test rig,
155.674	and proved that, in fact,
157.978	we could make a low-pressure,
157.978	nontoxic refrigerator.
161.245	So this is the way it works.
162.617	You put it on a cooking fire.
164.053	Most people have
164.053	cooking fires in the world,
166.187	whether it's camel dung or wood.
167.765	It heats up for about 30 minutes,
167.765	cools for an hour.
171.57	You put it into a container
171.57	and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
175.273	It looks like this.
176.519	This is the fifth prototype,
176.519	it's not quite done.
179.36	It weighs about eight pounds,
179.36	and this is the way it works.
182.368	You put it into a 15-liter vessel,
182.368	about three gallons,
185.974	and it'll cool it down
185.974	to just above freezing --
188.47	three degrees above freezing --
189.972	for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
193.036	It's really cheap.
194.247	We think we can build these
194.247	in high volumes for about 25 dollars,
197.347	in low volumes for about 40 dollars.
199.102	And we think we can make refrigeration
199.102	something that everybody can have.
202.596	Thank you.
203.796	(Applause)
