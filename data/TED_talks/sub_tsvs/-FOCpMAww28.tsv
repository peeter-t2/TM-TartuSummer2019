12.258	Some people think that there's
12.258	a TED Talk formula:
15.19	"""Give a talk on a round, red rug."""
17.189	"""Share a childhood story."""
18.615	"""Divulge a personal secret."""
20.646	"""End with an inspiring call to action."""
23.441	No.
24.615	That's not how to think of a TED Talk.
26.736	In fact, if you overuse those devices,
28.749	you're just going to come across
28.749	as clich√©d or emotionally manipulative.
32.916	But there is one thing that all
32.916	great TED Talks have in common,
36.82	and I would like to share
36.82	that thing with you,
39.523	because over the past 12 years,
39.523	I've had a ringside seat,
42.222	listening to many hundreds
42.222	of amazing TED speakers, like these.
46.985	I've helped them prepare
46.985	their talks for prime time,
49.446	and learned directly from them
50.906	their secrets of what
50.906	makes for a great talk.
53.256	And even though these speakers
53.256	and their topics all seem
56.05	completely different,
57.225	they actually do have
57.225	one key common ingredient.
61.318	And it's this:
63.254	Your number one task as a speaker
65.889	is to transfer into your listeners' minds
65.889	an extraordinary gift --
70.5	a strange and beautiful object
70.5	that we call an idea.
76.034	Let me show you what I mean.
77.393	Here's Haley.
78.568	She is about to give a TED Talk
80.558	and frankly, she's terrified.
82.425	(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!
84.098	(Applause)
90.537	Over the course of 18 minutes,
92.397	1,200 people, many of whom
92.397	have never seen each other before,
96.385	are finding that their brains
96.385	are starting to sync with Haley's brain
100.529	and with each other.
101.991	They're literally beginning to exhibit
101.991	the same brain-wave patterns.
105.409	And I don't just mean
105.409	they're feeling the same emotions.
108.299	There's something even more
108.299	startling happening.
110.822	Let's take a look inside
110.822	Haley's brain for a moment.
114.19	There are billions of interconnected
114.19	neurons in an impossible tangle.
118.445	But look here, right here --
120.276	a few million of them
120.276	are linked to each other
123.061	in a way which represents a single idea.
126.524	And incredibly, this exact pattern
126.524	is being recreated in real time
130.588	inside the minds of everyone listening.
133.69	That's right; in just a few minutes,
135.874	a pattern involving millions of neurons
138.261	is being teleported into 1,200 minds,
141.07	just by people listening to a voice
141.07	and watching a face.
144.682	But wait -- what is an idea anyway?
147.515	Well, you can think of it
147.515	as a pattern of information
151.023	that helps you understand
151.023	and navigate the world.
154.435	Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,
156.435	from the complex and analytical
158.459	to the simple and aesthetic.
160.562	Here are just a few examples
160.562	shared from the TED stage.
163.816	Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity
163.816	is key to our kids' future.
167.545	(Video) Sir Ken Robinson:
167.545	My contention is that creativity now
170.5	is as important in education as literacy,
173.625	and we should treat it
173.625	with the same status.
176.139	Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy --
176.139	building from bamboo is beautiful.
179.283	(Video) Elora Hardy:
179.283	It is growing all around us,
181.631	it's strong, it's elegant,
181.631	it's earthquake-resistant.
185.815	CA: Chimamanda Adichie --
185.815	people are more than a single identity.
189.68	(Video) Chimamanda Adichie:
189.68	The single story creates stereotypes,
192.806	and the problem with stereotypes
192.806	is not that they are untrue,
197.227	but that they are incomplete.
199.607	CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,
201.845	and not just randomly.
203.22	They're carefully linked together.
205.45	Collectively they form
205.45	an amazingly complex structure
208.379	that is your personal worldview.
210.577	It's your brain's operating system.
212.887	It's how you navigate the world.
214.783	And it is built up out of millions
214.783	of individual ideas.
218.592	So, for example, if one little
218.592	component of your worldview
222.085	is the idea that kittens are adorable,
224.935	then when you see this,
227.354	you'll react like this.
228.958	But if another component of your worldview
231.059	is the idea that leopards are dangerous,
233.346	then when you see this,
234.615	you'll react a little bit differently.
237.524	So, it's pretty obvious
239.136	why the ideas that make up
239.136	your worldview are crucial.
243.073	You need them to be as reliable
243.073	as possible -- a guide,
246.093	to the scary but wonderful
246.093	real world out there.
249.905	Now, different people's worldviews
249.905	can be dramatically different.
254.198	For example,
255.408	how does your worldview react
255.408	when you see this image:
259.919	(Video) Dalia Mogahed:
259.919	What do you think when you look at me?
262.911	"""A woman of faith,"""
262.911	"""an expert,"" maybe even ""a sister""?"
268.292	"Or ""oppressed,"" ""brainwashed,"""
272.135	"""a terrorist""?"
273.955	CA: Whatever your answer,
275.373	there are millions of people out there
275.373	who would react very differently.
278.794	So that's why ideas really matter.
280.894	If communicated properly,
280.894	they're capable of changing, forever,
284.596	how someone thinks about the world,
286.669	and shaping their actions both now
286.669	and well into the future.
291.603	Ideas are the most powerful force
291.603	shaping human culture.
295.508	So if you accept
296.683	that your number one task
296.683	as a speaker is to build an idea
299.437	inside the minds of your audience,
301.507	here are four guidelines
301.507	for how you should go about that task:
304.825	One, limit your talk
304.825	to just one major idea.
309.157	Ideas are complex things;
311.014	you need to slash back your content
311.014	so that you can focus
314.403	on the single idea
314.403	you're most passionate about,
317.18	and give yourself a chance
317.18	to explain that one thing properly.
320.838	You have to give context,
320.838	share examples, make it vivid.
324.615	So pick one idea,
325.886	and make it the through-line
325.886	running through your entire talk,
329.111	so that everything you say
329.111	links back to it in some way.
333.182	Two, give your listeners a reason to care.
337.523	Before you can start building things
337.523	inside the minds of your audience,
341.578	you have to get their permission
341.578	to welcome you in.
344.007	And the main tool to achieve that?
346.181	Curiosity.
347.548	Stir your audience's curiosity.
349.82	Use intriguing, provocative questions
352.065	to identify why something
352.065	doesn't make sense and needs explaining.
356.698	If you can reveal a disconnection
356.698	in someone's worldview,
360.683	they'll feel the need
360.683	to bridge that knowledge gap.
364.024	And once you've sparked that desire,
366.087	it will be so much easier
366.087	to start building your idea.
370.032	Three, build your idea, piece by piece,
373.429	out of concepts that your audience
373.429	already understands.
377.167	You use the power of language
378.838	to weave together
378.838	concepts that already exist
381.791	in your listeners' minds --
383.452	but not your language, their language.
385.77	You start where they are.
387.23	The speakers often forget that many
387.23	of the terms and concepts they live with
390.952	are completely unfamiliar
390.952	to their audiences.
393.587	Now, metaphors can play a crucial role
393.587	in showing how the pieces fit together,
398.785	because they reveal
398.785	the desired shape of the pattern,
402.483	based on an idea that the listener
402.483	already understands.
406.015	For example, when Jennifer Kahn
408.024	wanted to explain the incredible
408.024	new biotechnology called CRISPR,
411.697	"she said, ""It's as if, for the first time,"
414.007	you had a word processor to edit DNA.
417.062	CRISPR allows you to cut and paste
417.062	"genetic information really easily."""
422.165	Now, a vivid explanation like that
422.165	delivers a satisfying aha moment
426.467	as it snaps into place in our minds.
428.824	It's important, therefore,
428.824	to test your talk on trusted friends,
432.768	and find out which parts
432.768	they get confused by.
435.396	Four, here's the final tip:
437.728	Make your idea worth sharing.
441.242	By that I mean, ask yourself the question:
443.919	"""Who does this idea benefit?"""
446.489	And I need you to be honest
446.489	with the answer.
449.474	If the idea only serves you
449.474	or your organization,
452.41	then, I'm sorry to say,
452.41	it's probably not worth sharing.
455.711	The audience will see right through you.
457.846	But if you believe that the idea
457.846	has the potential
460.552	to brighten up someone else's day
462.474	or change someone else's
462.474	perspective for the better
465.314	or inspire someone to do
465.314	something differently,
468.202	then you have the core ingredient
468.202	to a truly great talk,
471.846	one that can be a gift to them
471.846	and to all of us.
