18.463	One year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem
21.482	to go find a man I'd never met
23.674	but who had changed my life.
25.81	I didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.
28.555	I didn't have an exact address,
31.056	but I knew his name, Abed,
33.671	I knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,
38.323	and I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,
43.134	he broke my neck.
45.355	And so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north
49.619	off in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.
54.325	The road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.
57.197	I then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,
59.837	heavy with four tons of floor tiles,
62.163	had borne down with great speed onto the back left corner
64.981	of the minibus where I sat.
68.119	I was then 19 years old.
70.773	I'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups
74.1	in eight months, and the night before the crash,
77.044	I delighted in my new body,
79.21	playing basketball with friends
81.351	into the wee hours of a May morning.
83.457	I palmed the ball in my large right hand,
86.152	and when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.
90.497	I was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.
94.343	I didn't see Abed coming.
96.891	From my seat, I was looking up at a stone town
99.263	on a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,
102.249	when from behind there was a great bang,
104.725	as loud and violent as a bomb.
107.642	My head snapped back over my red seat.
110.118	My eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.
113.204	I flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,
116.458	and when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.
120.674	Over the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,
123.095	then to sit and to stand and to walk,
126.1	but my body was now divided vertically.
128.568	I was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,
132.029	I used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.
136.664	College ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.
140.142	There I rose from my chair for good,
143.02	I leaned on my cane, and I looked back,
145.979	finding all from my fellow passengers in the bus
148.96	to photographs of the crash,
151.751	and when I saw this photograph,
156.208	I didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.
159.569	I saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,
163.316	and I mourned that it was lost,
165.632	mourned all I had not yet done,
168.018	but was now impossible.
175.897	It was then I read the testimony that Abed gave
178.274	the morning after the crash,
180.49	of driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.
184.372	Reading his words, I welled with anger.
187.327	It was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,
190.827	and it came from magical thinking.
193.65	On this xeroxed piece of paper,
195.773	the crash had not yet happened.
199.326	Abed could still turn his wheel left
201.415	so that I would see him whoosh by out my window
204.799	and I would remain whole.
207.241	"""Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."""
211.099	But Abed did not slow,
213.412	and on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,
217.22	and again, I was left without anger.
221.223	I decided to find Abed,
223.623	and when I finally did,
225.363	he responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,
228.916	it seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.
231.091	And maybe he had.
233.465	I didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record --
240.419	the last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day —
245.11	and I didn't mention my prior record --
247.203	the quadriplegia and the catheters,
248.911	the insecurity and the loss —
251.432	and when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,
254.124	I didn't say that I knew from the police report
256.484	that he'd escaped serious injury.
259.187	I said I wanted to meet.
262.92	Abed said that I should call back in a few weeks,
265.563	and when I did, and a recording told me
268.139	that his number was disconnected,
270.412	I let Abed and the crash go.
275.388	Many years passed.
277.618	I walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack
281.887	on trips in six continents.
284.557	I pitched overhand in a weekly softball game
287.996	that I started in Central Park,
290.224	and home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,
293.137	typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.
297.223	A friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories
299.73	mirrored my own, each centering on a life
302.622	that had changed in an instant,
304.982	owing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,
307.803	a swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.
310.436	Each of us had a before and an after.
314.41	I'd been working through my lot after all.
317.513	Still, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,
321.686	I returned to Israel to write of the crash,
324.476	"and the book I then wrote, ""Half-Life,"""
327.108	was nearly complete when I recognized
330.056	that I still wanted to meet Abed,
332.493	and finally I understood why:
335.4	"to hear this man say two words: ""I'm sorry."""
340.729	People apologize for less.
343.647	And so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived
346.459	somewhere in his same town,
348.676	and I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,
351.748	when suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.
355.741	But what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?
359.123	(Laughter)
363.205	I pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,
365.351	and bought a brick of Turkish delight:
367.41	pistachios glued in rosewater. Better.
371.599	Back on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.
375.012	Abed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.
379.194	"Abed would say, ""I'm sorry."""
383.391	I then began to wonder, as I had many times before,
386.417	how my life would have been different
387.655	had this man not injured me,
389.061	had my genes been fed a different helping of experience.
392.942	Who was I?
395.155	Was I who I had been before the crash,
397.972	before this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?
402.033	Was I what had been done to me?
404.322	Were all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,
408.715	the infidelity of a parent or spouse,
411.055	money inherited?
413.242	Were we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?
417.38	It seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,
420.345	but how to tease out the one from the other?
423.835	As Yeats put that same universal question,
426.677	"""O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,"
429.871	"how can we know the dancer from the dance?"""
436.186	I'd been driving for an hour
438.445	when I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.
442.172	The light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.
445.981	The predispositions and impulses that had propelled me
448.539	as a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,
451.749	that had propelled me as a teen
453.389	to jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.
457.81	But I also saw in my reflection
460.4	that, had Abed not injured me,
462.247	I would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor
465.234	and a husband and a father.
468.757	I would be less mindful of time and of death,
471.235	and, oh, I would not be disabled,
473.056	would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.
476.564	The frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth
479.219	come from biting at all the many things
481.565	a solitary hand cannot open.
484.346	The dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.
489.785	It was approaching 11 when I exited right
491.911	toward Afula, and passed a large quarry
494.07	and was soon in Kfar Kara.
496.523	I felt a pang of nerves.
498.986	But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,
502.789	and I pulled into a lot by a gas station
505.019	to listen and to calm.
508.36	I'd been told that in an Arab town,
510.592	one need only mention the name of a local
512.797	and it will be recognized.
515.077	And I was mentioning Abed and myself,
517.087	noting deliberately that I was here in peace,
519.445	to the people in this town,
521.581	when I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.
524.864	He listened to me.
527.306	You know, it was most often when speaking to people
530.13	that I wondered where I ended and my disability began,
534.07	for many people told me what they told no one else.
536.948	Many cried.
539.254	And one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same
541.898	and I later asked her why,
543.794	she told me that, best she could tell, her tears
545.768	had had something to do with my being happy and strong,
549.044	but vulnerable too.
551.731	I listened to her words. I suppose they were true.
554.014	I was me,
556.276	but I was now me despite a limp,
558.43	and that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.
562.592	Anyway, Mohamed told me
564.394	what perhaps he would not have told another stranger.
567.175	He led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.
571.286	And as I sat contemplating what to say,
573.984	a woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.
577.418	"I stepped from my car and said ""Shalom,"""
579.798	and identified myself,
581.835	and she told me that her husband Abed
583.264	would be home from work in four hours.
586.116	Her Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed
588.632	that she thought that I had come to install the Internet.
591.772	(Laughter)
595.496	I drove off and returned at 4:30,
598.521	thankful to the minaret up the road
599.797	that helped me find my way back.
602.331	And as I approached the front door,
604.428	Abed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,
607.853	and I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.
612.639	He wore black and white: slippers over socks,
615.662	pilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,
617.761	a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.
621.073	He'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.
623.57	And so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,
627.853	and I gave him my gift,
629.94	and he told me I was a guest in his home,
631.331	and we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.
634.744	It was then that Abed resumed at once
637.505	the tale of woe he had begun over the phone
642.325	He'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.
645.63	He had problems with his side and his legs too,
647.827	and, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.
650.369	Did I wish to see him remove them?
653.34	Abed then rose and turned on the TV
655.87	so that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,
658.728	and returned with polaroids of the crash
660.967	and his old driver's license.
663.577	"""I was handsome,"" he said."
667.384	We looked down at his laminated mug.
669.562	Abed had been less handsome than substantial,
672.318	with thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.
676.11	It was this youth who on May 16, 1990,
679.047	had broken two necks including mine,
681.196	and bruised one brain and taken one life.
685.144	Twenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,
687.743	his skin slack on his face,
689.492	and looking at Abed looking at his young self,
692.223	I remembered looking at that photograph of my young self
694.606	after the crash, and recognized his longing.
698.932	"""The crash changed both of our lives,"" I said."
703.049	Abed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,
705.777	and said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver
708.365	in the left lane who did not let him pass.
711.538	I did not want to recap the crash with Abed.
714.26	I'd hoped for something simpler:
716.029	to exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.
720.834	And so I didn't point out that in his own testimony
723.423	the morning after the crash,
725.469	Abed did not even mention the bus driver.
727.854	No, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.
731.218	I had come for remorse.
734.226	And so I now went looking for remorse
736.382	and threw truth under the bus.
738.667	"""I understand,"" I said, ""that the crash was not your fault,"
741.793	"but does it make you sad that others suffered?"""
746.182	Abed spoke three quick words.
748.577	"""Yes, I suffered."""
752.369	Abed then told me why he'd suffered.
755.305	He'd lived an unholy life before the crash,
758.444	and so God had ordained the crash,
760.773	but now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.
764.596	It was then that God intervened:
767.737	news on the TV of a car wreck that hours before
770.511	had killed three people up north.
773.283	We looked up at the wreckage.
775.656	"""Strange,"" I said."
778.677	"""Strange,"" he agreed."
781.462	I had the thought that there, on Route 804,
784.157	there were perpetrators and victims,
786.287	dyads bound by a crash.
788.023	Some, as had Abed, would forget the date.
790.484	Some, as had I, would remember.
793.694	The report finished and Abed spoke.
796.819	"""It is a pity,"" he said, ""that the police"
799.192	"in this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."""
804.086	I was baffled.
807.114	Abed had said something remarkable.
809.893	Did it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?
813.359	Was it evidence of guilt, an assertion
815.261	that he should have been put away longer?
817.644	He'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.
821.256	I forgot my discretion.
823.282	"""Um, Abed,"" I said,"
826.726	"""I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."""
830.957	"""Well,"" he said, ""I once went 60 in a 40."""
834.918	And so 27 violations --
838.319	driving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,
841.024	driving on the wrong side of a barrier,
843.006	and finally, riding his brakes down that hill --
845.046	reduced to one.
847.504	And it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,
850.991	the human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.
854.106	The goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.
858.023	It was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.
864.727	Abed and I sat with our coffee.
868.023	We'd spent 90 minutes together,
870.815	and he was now known to me.
873.177	He was not a particularly bad man
875.545	or a particularly good man.
877.878	He was a limited man
880.036	who'd found it within himself to be kind to me.
883.066	With a nod to Jewish custom,
884.576	he told me that I should live to be 120 years old.
888.523	But it was hard for me to relate to one who had
890.344	so completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,
893.642	to one whose life was so unexamined that he said
898.006	he thought two people had died in the crash.
905.012	There was much I wished to say to Abed.
908.636	I wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,
912.341	it would be okay,
914.516	for people are wrong to marvel
916.314	at those like me who smile as we limp.
919.556	People don't know that they have lived through worse,
923.492	that problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,
927.154	that problems of the mind are greater still,
929.505	more injurious, than a hundred broken necks.
933.681	I wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are
936.531	most of all
938.032	is not our minds and not our bodies
940.465	and not what happens to us,
942.273	but how we respond to what happens to us.
945.135	"""This,"" wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,"
947.713	"""is the last of the human freedoms:"
949.53	"to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."""
954.43	I wished to tell him that not only paralyzers
957.254	and paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,
961.125	but we all must --
963.102	the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding
967.988	and the bankrupt and everyone.
971.833	I wished to tell him that one does not have to say
974.438	that a bad thing is good,
976.454	that a crash is from God and so a crash is good,
979.002	a broken neck is good.
980.693	One can say that a bad thing sucks,
983.953	but that this natural world still has many glories.
988.075	I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:
993.101	We have to rise above bad fortune.
996.328	We have to be in the good and enjoy the good,
999.354	study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship --
1005.238	and community and love.
1009.007	But most of all, I wished to tell him
1011.766	what Herman Melville wrote,
1014.135	"that ""truly to enjoy bodily warmth,"
1017.062	some small part of you must be cold,
1020.119	for there is no quality in this world
1022.422	"that is not what it is merely by contrast."""
1025.714	Yes, contrast.
1028.155	If you are mindful of what you do not have,
1030.494	you may be truly mindful of what you do have,
1033.722	and if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.
1037.616	That is the one singular gift you may receive
1040.045	if you suffer in any existential way.
1043.016	You know death, and so may wake each morning
1045.345	pulsing with ready life.
1047.375	Some part of you is cold,
1048.97	and so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,
1052.469	or even to be cold.
1055.391	When one morning, years after the crash,
1057.415	I stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot
1060.198	felt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,
1063.661	it was exhilarating, a gust of snow.
1068.948	But I didn't say these things to Abed.
1072.184	I told him only that he had killed one man, not two.
1076.985	I told him the name of that man.
1081.459	"And then I said, ""Goodbye."""
1085.272	Thank you.
1087.189	(Applause)
1093.924	Thanks a lot.
1096.66	(Applause)
