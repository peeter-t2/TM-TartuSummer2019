13.062	Good morning.
15.327	When I was a little boy,
17.114	I had an experience that changed my life,
20.191	and is in fact why I'm here today.
23.099	That one moment
25.04	profoundly affected how I think about
27.302	art, design and engineering.
30.523	As background, I was fortunate enough to grow up
33.28	in a family of loving and talented artists
36.993	in one of the world's great cities.
39.557	My dad, John Ferren, who died when I was 15,
43.434	was an artist by both passion and profession,
46.964	as is my mom, Rae.
49.224	He was one of the New York School
51.029	abstract expressionists who,
52.79	together with his contemporaries,
55.302	invented American modern art,
58.2	and contributed to moving the American zeitgeist
61.385	towards modernism in the 20th century.
65.928	Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years
68.849	of people doing mostly representational art,
72.49	that modern art, comparatively speaking,
74.523	is about 15 minutes old,
76.863	yet now pervasive.
78.761	As with many other important innovations,
80.705	those radical ideas required no new technology,
84.325	just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment,
87.218	plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism
91.386	and rejection.
92.84	In our home, art was everywhere.
95.357	It was like oxygen,
96.928	around us and necessary for life.
100.09	As I watched him paint,
101.949	Dad taught me that art
104.256	was not about being decorative,
106.465	but was a different way of communicating ideas,
109.579	and in fact one that could bridge the worlds
111.616	of knowledge and insight.
114.544	Given this rich artistic environment,
116.684	you'd assume that I would have been compelled
118.299	to go into the family business,
120.408	but no.
123.024	I followed the path of most kids
124.811	who are genetically programmed
126.161	to make their parents crazy.
128.36	I had no interest in becoming an artist,
130.983	certainly not a painter.
132.543	What I did love was electronics and machines --
135.842	taking them apart, building new ones,
137.462	and making them work.
139.349	Fortunately, my family also had engineers in it,
143.251	and with my parents,
144.459	these were my first role models.
147.087	What they all had in common
148.444	was they worked very, very hard.
151.152	My grandpa owned and operated a sheet metal
153.522	kitchen cabinet factory in Brooklyn.
156.222	On weekends, we would go
156.222	together to Cortlandt Street,
159.646	which was New York City's radio row.
162.321	There we would explore massive piles
165.124	of surplus electronics,
166.345	and for a few bucks bring home treasures
168.647	like Norden bombsights
170.079	and parts from the first IBM tube-based computers.
174.59	I found these objects both useful and fascinating.
177.656	I learned about engineering and how things worked,
180.287	not at school
181.747	but by taking apart and studying
183.536	these fabulously complex devices.
186.013	I did this for hours every day,
188.597	apparently avoiding electrocution.
191.895	Life was good.
193.467	However, every summer, sadly,
195.788	the machines got left behind
197.821	while my parents and I traveled overseas
200.025	to experience history, art and design.
203.665	We visited the great museums and historic buildings
206.059	of both Europe and the Middle East,
207.919	but to encourage my growing interest
210.179	in science and technology,
211.994	they would simply drop me off in places
214.278	like the London Science Museum,
216.718	where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself
220.436	studying the history of science and technology.
224.412	Then, when I was about nine years old,
227.676	we went to Rome.
229.544	On one particularly hot summer day,
231.905	we visited a drum-shaped
231.905	building that from the outside
234.784	was not particularly interesting.
237.028	My dad said it was called the Pantheon,
239.353	a temple for all of the gods.
241.821	It didn't look all that special from the outside,
244.095	as I said, but when we walked inside,
246.534	I was immediately struck by three things:
249.847	First of all, it was pleasantly cool
253.077	despite the oppressive heat outside.
255.155	It was very dark, the only source of light
257.869	being an big open hole in the roof.
260.342	Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole,
262.575	but it was called the oculus,
264.389	an eye to the heavens.
266.765	And there was something about this place,
268.91	I didn't know why, that just felt special.
271.913	As we walked to the center of the room,
273.911	I looked up at the heavens through the oculus.
276.732	This was the first church that I'd been to
279.029	that provided an unrestricted view
281.232	between God and man.
284.39	But I wondered, what about when it rained?
287.82	Dad may have called this an oculus,
289.677	but it was, in fact, a big hole in the roof.
292.764	I looked down and saw floor drains
294.593	had been cut into the stone floor.
297.178	As I became more accustomed to the dark,
299.637	I was able to make out details of the floor
301.901	and the surrounding walls.
303.631	No big deal here, just the same statuary stuff
306.208	that we'd seen all over Rome.
308.124	In fact, it looked like the Appian Way
309.796	marble salesman showed up
311.992	with his sample book, showed it to Hadrian,
314.44	"and Hadrian said, ""We'll take all of it."""
317.08	(Laughter)
318.786	But the ceiling was amazing.
322.004	It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
324.84	I'd seen these before,
326.149	and Bucky was friends with my dad.
328.393	It was modern, high-tech, impressive,
331.884	a huge 142-foot clear span
334.321	which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
337.564	I loved this place.
338.826	It was really beautiful and unlike
338.826	anything I'd ever seen before,
342.245	"so I asked my dad, ""When was this built?"""
345.815	"He said, ""About 2,000 years ago."""
348.947	"And I said, ""No, I mean, the roof."""
351.451	You see, I assumed that this was a modern roof
353.41	that had been put on because the original
355.328	was destroyed in some long-past war.
358.874	"He said, ""It's the original roof."""
362.336	That moment changed my life,
364.814	and I can remember it as if it were yesterday.
367.463	For the first time, I realized people were smart
370.058	2,000 years ago. (Laughter)
372.198	This had never crossed my mind.
374.312	I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza,
378.183	we visited those the year before,
380.111	and sure they're impressive, nice enough design,
383.031	but look, give me an unlimited budget,
389.483	to cut and drag stone blocks 
389.483	across the countryside,
393.099	and I'll build you pyramids too.
395.863	But no amount of brute force
398.666	gets you the dome of the Pantheon,
401.708	not 2,000 years ago, nor today.
404.727	And incidentally, it is still the largest
407.467	unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.
411.281	To build the Pantheon took some miracles.
414.276	By miracles, I mean things that are
416.708	technically barely possible,
419.295	very high-risk, and might not be
422.367	actually accomplishable at this moment in time,
424.951	certainly not by you.
429.203	For example, here are some
429.203	of the Pantheon's miracles.
432.328	To make it even structurally possible,
435.021	they had to invent super-strong concrete,
437.588	and to control weight,
439.537	varied the density of the aggregate
441.605	as they worked their way up the dome.
444.373	For strength and lightness, the dome structure
446.674	used five rings of coffers,
448.711	each of diminishing size,
450.318	which imparts a dramatic forced perspective
453.054	to the design.
455.061	It was wonderfully cool inside
456.986	because of its huge thermal mass,
459.169	natural convection of air rising up
461.254	through the oculus,
462.655	and a Venturi effect when wind blows across
465.13	the top of the building.
467.433	I discovered for the first time that light itself
471.393	has substance.
473.36	The shaft of light beaming through the oculus
476.037	was both beautiful and palpable,
478.527	and I realized for the first time
480.784	that light could be designed.
482.685	Further, that of all of the forms of design,
487.559	visual design,
488.935	they were all kind of irrelevant without it,
490.766	because without light, you can't see any of them.
494.627	I also realized that I wasn't the first person
497.079	to think that this place was really special.
500.338	It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers
504.715	and the ravages of time to become
506.614	what I believe is the longest
507.994	continuously occupied building in history.
510.951	Largely because of that visit,
513.167	I came to understand that,
514.704	contrary to what I was being told in school,
517.343	the worlds of art and design
519.372	were not, in fact, incompatible
521.388	with science and engineering.
523.064	I realized, when combined,
525.157	you could create things that were amazing
527.92	that couldn't be done in either domain alone.
530.766	But in school, with few exceptions,
533.199	they were treated as separate worlds,
535.119	and they still are.
537.262	My teachers told me that I had to get serious
539.958	and focus on one or the other.
542.131	However, urging me to specialize
545.226	only caused me to really 
545.226	appreciate those polymaths
548.536	like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci,
552.686	Benjamin Franklin,
554.111	people who did exactly the opposite.
556.821	And this led me to embrace
559.01	and want to be in both worlds.
561.98	So then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity
567.808	like the Pantheon actually happen?
570.302	Someone themselves, perhaps Hadrian,
574.23	needed a brilliant creative vision.
577.421	They also needed the storytelling
577.421	and leadership skills
580.214	necessary to fund and execute it,
582.992	and a mastery of science and technology
585.854	with the ability and knowhow
587.937	to push existing innovations even farther.
591.983	It is my belief that to create
591.983	these rare game changers
595.903	requires you to pull off at least five miracles.
600.033	The problem is, no matter how talented,
602.726	rich or smart you are,
604.458	you only get one to one and a half miracles.
607.484	That's it. That's the quota.
609.266	Then you run out of time, money, enthusiasm,
611.879	whatever.
613.258	Remember, most people can't even imagine
615.535	one of these technical miracles,
617.442	and you need at least five to make a Pantheon.
620.551	In my experience, these rare visionaries
623.052	who can think across the worlds of art,
624.889	design and engineering
626.716	have the ability to notice
628.918	when others have provided enough of the miracles
631.635	to bring the goal within reach.
634.191	Driven by the clarity of their vision,
636.828	they summon the courage and determination
639.138	to deliver the remaining miracles
641.235	and they often take what other people think to be
644.785	insurmountable obstacles
646.831	and turn them into features.
648.616	Take the oculus of the Pantheon.
651.543	By insisting that it be in the design,
653.441	it meant you couldn't use much
653.441	of the structural technology
656.314	that had been developed for Roman arches.
659.288	However, by instead embracing it
662.186	and rethinking weight and stress distribution,
664.774	they came up with a design that only works
667.256	if there's a big hole in the roof.
669.16	That done, you now get the aesthetic
672.167	and design benefits of light, cooling
676.548	and that critical direct connection with the heavens.
679.848	Not bad.
681.892	These people not only believed
683.953	that the impossible can be done,
686.009	but that it must be done.
688.835	Enough ancient history.
690.936	What are some recent examples of innovations
694.069	that combine creative design
695.948	and technological advances in a way so profound
699.191	that they will be remembered
700.52	a thousand years from now?
702.353	Well, putting a man on the moon was a good one,
705.449	and returning him safely to Earth wasn't bad either.
708.466	Talk about one giant leap:
710.958	It's hard to imagine a more profound moment
713.406	in human history
714.718	than when we first left our world
716.891	to set foot on another.
718.782	So what came after the moon?
721.003	One is tempted to say that today's pantheon
723.811	is the Internet,
725.472	but I actually think that's quite wrong,
727.941	or at least it's only part of the story.
730.796	The Internet isn't a Pantheon.
733.312	It's more like the invention of concrete:
735.903	important, absolutely necessary
738.478	to build the Pantheon,
739.918	and enduring,
741.274	but entirely insufficient by itself.
744.465	However, just as the technology of concrete
747.397	was critical in realization of the Pantheon,
750.984	new designers will use the
750.984	technologies of the Internet
754.199	to create novel concepts that will endure.
757.397	The smartphone is a perfect example.
759.455	Soon the majority of people on the planet
761.2	will have one,
762.534	and the idea of connecting everyone
764.935	to both knowledge and each other will endure.
768.185	So what's next?
769.493	What imminent advance will be
769.493	the equivalent of the Pantheon?
772.899	Thinking about this,
774.334	I rejected many very plausible
776.881	and dramatic breakthroughs to come,
778.777	such as curing cancer.
780.794	Why? Because Pantheons are anchored
784.132	in designed physical objects,
787.067	ones that inspire by simply seeing
789.389	and experiencing them,
790.809	and will continue to do so indefinitely.
793.691	It is a different kind of language, like art.
798.264	These other vital contributions that extend life
801.036	and relieve suffering are, of course, critical,
803.729	and fantastic,
805.416	but they're part of the continuum of
807.209	our overall knowledge and technology,
809.721	like the Internet.
812.245	So what is next?
814.589	Perhaps counterintuitively,
816.308	I'm guessing it's a visionary idea
818.62	from the late 1930s
820.474	that's been revived every decade since:
823.634	autonomous vehicles.
825.648	Now you're thinking, give me a break.
827.386	How can a fancy version of cruise control
830.904	be profound?
832.604	Look, much of our world
834.728	has been designed around 
834.728	roads and transportation.
838.211	These were as essential to the success
840.086	of the Roman Empire
841.584	as the interstate highway system
843.569	to the prosperity and development
845.363	of the United States.
847.573	Today, these roads that interconnect our world
850.607	are dominated by cars and trucks
852.705	that have remained largely unchanged
854.573	for 100 years.
857.144	Although perhaps not obvious today,
860.403	autonomous vehicles will be the key technology
864.988	that enables us to redesign our cities
868.086	and, by extension, civilization.
870.305	Here's why:
871.907	Once they become ubiquitous,
873.66	each year, these vehicles will save
876.197	tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone
879.305	and a million globally.
882.432	Automotive energy consumption and air pollution
885.331	will be cut dramatically.
887.704	Much of the road congestion
889.109	in and out of our cities will disappear.
892.919	They will enable compelling new concepts
895.606	in how we design cities, work,
898.075	and the way we live.
900.012	We will get where we're going faster
902.558	and society will recapture vast amounts
905.556	of lost productivity
906.847	now spent sitting in traffic basically polluting.
910.488	But why now? Why do we think this is ready?
913.761	Because over the last 30 years,
915.955	people from outside the automotive industry
918.003	have spent countless billions
920.111	creating the needed miracles,
921.846	but for entirely different purposes.
924.718	It took folks like DARPA, universities,
927.346	and companies completely
927.346	outside of the automotive industry
930.51	to notice that if you were clever about it,
932.811	autonomy could be done now.
935.341	So what are the five miracles
935.341	needed for autonomous vehicles?
938.724	One, you need to know
940.367	where you are and exactly what time it is.
943.101	This was solved neatly by the GPS system,
945.509	Global Positioning System,
946.821	that the U.S. Government put in place.
949.487	You need to know where all the roads are,
952.01	what the rules are, and where you're going.
954.913	The various needs of personal navigation systems,
957.496	in-car navigation systems,
959.251	and web-based maps address this.
962.284	You must have near-continuous communication
964.911	with high-performance computing networks
966.804	and with others nearby
968.474	to understand their intent.
971.789	The wireless technologies
971.789	developed for mobile devices,
974.897	with some minor modifications,
976.69	are completely suitable to solve this.
979.649	You'll probably want some restricted roadways
982.139	to get started
983.329	that both society and its lawyers
985.807	agree are safe to use for this.
987.679	This will start with the HOV lanes
989.528	and move from there.
991.661	But finally, you need to recognize
994.212	people, signs and objects.
996.315	Machine vision, special sensors,
996.315	and high-performance computing
999.369	can do a lot of this,
1000.941	but it turns out a lot is not good enough
1003.499	when your family is on board.
1005.44	Occasionally, humans will 
1005.44	need to do sense-making.
1008.961	For this, you might actually have to wake up
1012.573	your passenger and ask them what the hell
1014.669	that big lump is in the middle of the road.
1017.487	Not so bad, and it will give us a sense of purpose
1019.831	in this new world.
1021.684	Besides, once the first drivers explain
1024.424	to their confused car
1025.75	that the giant chicken at the fork in the road
1028.416	is actually a restaurant,
1029.959	and it's okay to keep driving,
1032.263	every other car on the surface of the Earth
1035.683	will know that from that point on.
1038.605	Five miracles, mostly delivered,
1040.868	and now you just need a clear vision
1042.746	of a better world filled with autonomous vehicles
1045.583	with seductively beautiful 
1045.583	and new functional designs
1049.196	plus a lot of money and hard work
1051.65	to bring it home.
1053.246	The beginning is now only a handful of years away,
1056.268	and I predict that autonomous vehicles
1058.136	will permanently change our world
1060.207	over the next several decades.
1064.391	In conclusion, I've come to believe
1067.043	that the ingredients for the next Pantheons
1069.281	are all around us,
1070.668	just waiting for visionary people
1072.855	with the broad knowledge,
1074.589	multidisciplinary skills,
1076.199	and intense passion
1078.067	to harness them to make their dreams a reality.
1083.153	But these people don't spontaneously
1085.649	pop into existence.
1086.988	They need to be nurtured and encouraged
1088.827	from when they're little kids.
1090.606	We need to love them and help them
1092.466	discover their passions.
1094.185	We need to encourage them to work hard
1096.399	and help them understand that failure
1098.836	is a necessary ingredient for success,
1101.707	as is perseverance.
1103.888	We need to help them to find their own role models,
1106.986	and give them the confidence
1106.986	to believe in themselves
1109.658	and to believe that anything is possible,
1112.435	and just as my grandpa did when
1112.435	he took me shopping for surplus,
1115.944	and just as my parents did
1117.727	when they took me to science museums,
1119.749	we need to encourage them to find their own path,
1123.03	even if it's very different from our own.
1125.687	But a cautionary note:
1127.095	We also need to periodically pry them away
1129.529	from their modern miracles,
1130.998	the computers, phones, tablets,
1132.969	game machines and TVs,
1134.563	take them out into the sunlight
1136.807	so they can experience both the natural
1138.936	and design wonders of our world,
1141.833	our planet and our civilization.
1144.075	If we don't, they won't understand
1147.002	what these precious things are
1148.884	that someday they will be resopnsible
1151.479	for protecting and improving.
1153.761	We also need them to understand
1155.404	something that doesn't seem adequately appreciated
1158.433	in our increasingly tech-dependent world,
1160.896	that art and design
1162.579	are not luxuries,
1164.492	nor somehow incompatible
1166.318	with science and engineering.
1168.187	They are in fact essential to what makes us special.
1173.762	Someday, if you get the chance,
1176.277	perhaps you can take your kids
1177.814	to the actual Pantheon,
1179.585	as we will our daughter Kira,
1182.245	to experience firsthand
1184.323	the power of that astonishing design,
1188.58	which on one otherwise unremarkable day in Rome,
1192.324	reached 2,000 years into the future
1195.351	to set the course for my life.
1198.009	Thank you.
1200.14	(Applause)
