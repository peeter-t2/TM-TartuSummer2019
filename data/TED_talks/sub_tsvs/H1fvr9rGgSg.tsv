12.777	The following are my opinions,
14.686	and do not reflect
14.686	the opinions or policies
16.717	of any particular prosecutor's office.
18.725	(Laughter)
21.452	I am a prosecutor.
23.146	I believe in law and order.
24.716	I am the adopted son of a police officer,
24.716	a Marine and a hairdresser.
29.139	I believe in accountability
32.103	and that we should all be safe
32.103	in our communities.
36.145	I love my job
38.487	and the people that do it.
40.5	I just think that it's our responsibility
42.498	to do it better.
45.213	By a show of hands,
47.286	how many of you, by the age of 25,
50.024	had either acted up in school,
51.912	went somewhere you were
51.912	specifically told to stay out of,
54.675	or drank alcohol before your legal age?
58.409	(Laughter)
59.814	All right.
61.52	How many of you shoplifted,
63.783	tried an illegal drug
65.807	or got into a physical fight --
67.51	yes, even with a sibling?
70.659	Now, how many of you
70.659	ever spent one day in jail
74.624	for any of those decisions?
81.809	How many of you sitting here today
83.467	think that you're a danger to society
85.302	or should be defined by those actions
85.302	of youthful indiscretion?
89.907	(Laughter)
92.185	Point taken.
95.504	When we talk about
95.504	criminal justice reform,
97.833	we often focus on a few things,
100.379	and that's what I want
100.379	to talk to you about today.
104.783	But first I'm going to --
104.783	since you shared with me,
107.194	I'm going to give you
107.194	a confession on my part.
109.385	I went to law school
110.813	to make money.
112.725	I had no interest
112.725	in being a public servant,
114.82	I had no interest in criminal law,
116.531	and I definitely didn't think
116.531	that I would ever be a prosecutor.
120.888	Near the end of my first year
120.888	of law school, I got an internship
123.918	in the Roxbury Division
123.918	of Boston Municipal Court.
126.921	I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished
126.921	neighborhood in Boston,
130.465	plagued by gun violence and drug crime.
135.835	My life and my legal career changed
135.835	the first day of that internship.
141.973	I walked into a courtroom,
141.973	and I saw an auditorium of people
145.919	who, one by one, would approach
145.919	the front of that courtroom
148.776	to say two words and two words only:
150.536	"""Not guilty."""
152.352	They were predominately black and brown.
156.152	And then a judge, a defense
156.152	attorney and a prosecutor
158.686	would make life-altering decisions
158.686	about that person without their input.
163.571	They were predominately white.
167.23	As each person, one by one,
167.23	approached the front of that courtroom,
170.417	I couldn't stop but think:
172.019	How did they get here?
173.194	I wanted to know their stories.
175.773	And as the prosecutor
175.773	read the facts of each case,
179.762	I was thinking to myself,
181.549	we could have predicted that.
184.099	That seems so preventable...
187.575	not because I was an expert
187.575	in criminal law,
189.758	but because it was common sense.
193.525	Over the course of the internship,
195.193	I began to recognize
195.193	people in the auditorium,
197.371	not because they were
197.371	criminal masterminds
199.487	but because they were
199.487	coming to us for help
201.511	and we were sending them out without any.
205.774	My second year of law school I worked
205.774	as a paralegal for a defense attorney,
209.377	and in that experience I met many
209.377	young men accused of murder.
212.69	"Even in our ""worst,"" I saw human stories."
216.642	And they all contained childhood trauma,
219.542	victimization, poverty, loss,
221.802	disengagement from school,
223.524	early interaction with the police
223.524	and the criminal justice system,
226.683	all leading to a seat in a courtroom.
229.862	Those convicted of murder
229.862	were condemned to die in prison,
232.876	and it was during those meetings
232.876	with those men that I couldn't fathom
237.018	why we would spend so much money
238.829	to keep this one person in jail
238.829	for the next 80 years
241.575	when we could have reinvested it up front,
243.606	and perhaps prevented the whole thing
243.606	from happening in the first place.
247.108	(Applause)
252.715	My third year of law school,
254.084	I defended people accused
254.084	of small street crimes,
256.736	mostly mentally ill,
257.911	mostly homeless,
259.086	mostly drug-addicted,
260.261	all in need of help.
263.194	They would come to us,
264.925	and we would send them away
264.925	without that help.
268.557	They were in need of our assistance.
272.621	But we weren't giving them any.
276.933	Prosecuted, adjudged and defended
280.09	by people who knew nothing about them.
284.493	The staggering inefficiency is what
284.493	drove me to criminal justice work.
288.425	The unfairness of it all
288.425	made me want to be a defender.
292.382	The power dynamic
292.382	that I came to understand
296.156	made me become a prosecutor.
299.383	I don't want to spend a lot of time
299.383	talking about the problem.
302.338	We know the criminal justice
302.338	system needs reform,
304.702	we know there are 2.3 million
304.702	people in American jails and prisons,
307.932	making us the most incarcerated
307.932	nation on the planet.
310.535	We know there's another seven million
310.535	people on probation or parole,
313.836	we know that the criminal justice system
316.074	disproportionately affects
316.074	people of color,
318.106	particularly poor people of color.
319.754	And we know there are system failures
319.754	happening everywhere
322.532	that bring people to our courtrooms.
324.326	But what we do not discuss
325.612	is how ill-equipped our prosecutors
325.612	are to receive them.
329.151	When we talk about
329.151	criminal justice reform,
331.199	we, as a society, focus on three things.
333.53	We complain, we tweet, we protest
335.366	about the police, about sentencing laws
337.519	and about prison.
340.031	We rarely, if ever, talk
340.031	about the prosecutor.
346.367	In the fall of 2009,
348.735	a young man was arrested
348.735	by the Boston Police Department.
351.785	He was 18 years old,
351.785	he was African American
354.112	and he was a senior
354.112	at a local public school.
356.706	He had his sights set on college
358.654	but his part-time, minimum-wage job
358.654	wasn't providing the financial opportunity
362.402	he needed to enroll in school.
364.709	In a series of bad decisions,
366.16	he stole 30 laptops from a store
366.16	and sold them on the Internet.
370.424	This led to his arrest
371.937	and a criminal complaint
371.937	of 30 felony charges.
377.677	The potential jail time he faced is what
377.677	stressed Christopher out the most.
381.249	But what he had little understanding of
383.367	was the impact a criminal record
383.367	would have on his future.
388.311	I was standing in arraignments that day
390.228	when Christopher's case
390.228	came across my desk.
392.348	And at the risk of sounding
392.348	dramatic, in that moment,
394.888	I had Christopher's life in my hands.
397.505	I was 29 years old,
397.505	a brand-new prosecutor,
399.78	and I had little appreciation
399.78	for how the decisions I would make
402.9	would impact Christopher's life.
406.906	Christopher's case was a serious one
408.746	and it needed to be dealt with as such,
410.651	but I didn't think branding him
410.651	a felon for the rest of his life
413.714	was the right answer.
416.4	For the most part,
416.4	prosecutors step onto the job
418.687	with little appreciation
418.687	of the impact of our decisions,
421.362	regardless of our intent.
422.695	Despite our broad discretion,
424.234	we learn to avoid risk at all cost,
427.43	rendering our discretion
429.192	basically useless.
431.971	History has conditioned us
431.971	to believe that somehow,
434.387	the criminal justice system
434.387	brings about accountability
437.198	and improves public safety,
438.552	despite evidence to the contrary.
441.1	We're judged internally and externally
441.1	by our convictions and our trial wins,
444.768	so prosecutors aren't really
444.768	incentivized to be creative
448.29	at our case dispositions,
450.421	or to take risks on people
450.421	we might not otherwise.
454.666	We stick to an outdated method,
456.187	counterproductive to achieving
456.187	the very goal that we all want,
459.342	and that's safer communities.
462.004	Yet most prosecutors standing in my space
462.004	would have arraigned Christopher.
466.897	They have little appreciation
466.897	for what we can do.
470.299	Arraigning Christopher
470.299	would give him a criminal record,
474.426	making it harder for him to get a job,
477.02	setting in motion a cycle
478.733	that defines the failing
478.733	criminal justice system today.
484.073	With a criminal record and without a job,
486.082	Christopher would be unable to find
486.082	employment, education or stable housing.
490.627	Without those protective
490.627	factors in his life,
492.77	Christopher would be more likely
492.77	to commit further, more serious crime.
496.164	The more contact Christopher had
496.164	with the criminal justice system,
499.313	the more likely it would be
499.313	that he would return again
501.881	and again and again --
503.874	all at tremendous social cost
503.874	to his children, to his family
507.702	and to his peers.
508.877	And, ladies and gentlemen,
510.206	it is a terrible public safety
510.206	outcome for the rest of us.
516.509	When I came out of law school,
518.808	I did the same thing as everybody else.
521.546	I came out as a prosecutor
521.546	expected to do justice,
524.026	but I never learned what
524.026	justice was in my classes --
526.553	none of us do.
528.203	None of us do.
530.96	And yet, prosecutors
530.96	are the most powerful actors
533.471	in the criminal justice system.
536.229	Our power is virtually boundless.
537.946	In most cases, not the judge,
539.423	not the police, not the legislature,
541.177	not the mayor, not the governor,
541.177	not the President
543.574	can tell us how to prosecute our cases.
547.006	The decision to arraign Christopher
547.006	and give him a criminal record
550.146	was exclusively mine.
552.343	I would choose whether to prosecute
552.343	him for 30 felonies, for one felony,
555.853	for a misdemeanor,
557.028	or at all.
558.229	I would choose whether to leverage
558.229	Christopher into a plea deal
561.229	or take the case to trial, and ultimately,
563.282	I would be in a position to ask
563.282	for Christopher to go to jail.
567.92	These are decisions that prosecutors
567.92	make every day unfettered,
572.613	and we are unaware and untrained
575.446	of the grave consequences
575.446	of those decisions.
580.498	One night this past summer,
581.844	I was at a small gathering
581.844	of professional men of color
585.77	from around the city.
587.381	As I stood there stuffing
587.381	free finger sandwiches into my mouth,
590.362	as you do as public servant --
591.869	(Laughter)
592.909	I noticed across the room,
594.496	a young man waving and smiling
594.496	at me and approaching me.
599.527	And I recognized him,
599.527	but I couldn't place from where,
602.575	and before I knew it,
602.575	this young man was hugging me.
607.134	And thanking me.
609.766	"""You cared about me,"
609.766	"and you changed my life."""
613.339	It was Christopher.
615.836	See, I never arraigned Christopher.
617.546	He never faced a judge or a jail,
619.17	he never had a criminal record.
621.133	Instead, I worked with Christopher;
622.915	first on being accountable
622.915	for his actions,
625.658	and then, putting him in a position
625.658	where he wouldn't re-offend.
629.665	We recovered 75 percent
629.665	of the computers that he sold
632.642	and gave them back to Best Buy,
634.169	and came up with a financial plan
635.797	to repay for the computers
635.797	we couldn't recover.
638.036	Christopher did community service.
639.775	He wrote an essay reflecting on how
639.775	this case could impact his future
643.078	and that of the community.
644.453	He applied to college,
645.684	he obtained financial aid,
646.968	and he went on to graduate
646.968	from a four-year school.
650.523	(Applause)
657.574	After we finished hugging,
657.574	I looked at his name tag,
660.038	to learn that Christopher was the manager
660.038	of a large bank in Boston.
663.311	Christopher had accomplished --
663.311	and making a lot more money than me --
666.635	(Laughter)
667.66	He had accomplished all of this
669.19	in the six years since I had first
669.19	seen him in Roxbury Court.
672.909	I can't take credit for Christopher's
672.909	journey to success,
676.731	but I certainly did my part
676.731	to keep him on the path.
680.992	There are thousands
680.992	of Christophers out there,
684.593	some locked in our jails and prisons.
686.398	We need thousands of prosecutors
688.287	to recognize that and to protect them.
692.508	An employed Christopher is better
692.508	for public safety than a condemned one.
696.462	It's a bigger win for all of us.
700.438	In retrospect, the decision not
700.438	to throw the book at Christopher
703.543	makes perfect sense.
704.718	When I saw him that first day
704.718	in Roxbury Court,
706.954	I didn't see a criminal standing there.
708.85	I saw myself -- a young person
708.85	in need of intervention.
711.669	As an individual caught selling a large
711.669	quantity of drugs in my late teens,
716.006	I knew firsthand the power of opportunity
718.955	as opposed to the wrath
718.955	of the criminal justice system.
724.341	Along the way, with the help
724.341	and guidance of my district attorney,
728.276	my supervisor and judges,
731.273	I learned the power of the prosecutor
733.824	to change lives instead of ruining them.
738.542	And that's how we do it in Boston.
741.206	We helped a woman who was arrested
741.206	for stealing groceries to feed her kids
744.775	get a job.
746.401	Instead of putting an abused
746.401	teenager in adult jail
749.573	for punching another teenager,
751.05	we secured mental health treatment
751.05	and community supervision.
754.288	A runaway girl who was arrested
755.959	for prostituting, to survive
755.959	on the streets,
758.086	needed a safe place to live and grow --
760.851	something we could help her with.
762.878	I even helped a young man
764.378	who was so afraid of the older gang kids
764.378	showing up after school,
767.505	that one morning instead
767.505	of a lunchbox into his backpack,
770.204	he put a loaded 9-millimeter.
773.467	We would spend our time that we'd
773.467	normally take prepping our cases
777.527	for months and months
777.527	for trial down the road
779.718	by coming up with real solutions
779.718	to the problems as they presented.
784.699	Which is the better way to spend our time?
787.969	How would you prefer
787.969	your prosecutors to spend theirs?
791.901	Why are we spending 80 billion dollars
794.293	on a prison industry
794.293	that we know is failing,
796.759	when we could take that money
796.759	and reallocate it into education,
800.347	into mental health treatment,
801.78	into substance abuse treatment
803.301	and to community investment
803.301	so we can develop our neighborhoods?
806.383	(Applause)
813.616	So why should this matter to you?
815.244	Well, one, we're spending a lot of money.
819.294	Our money.
821.063	It costs 109,000 dollars in some states
823.493	to lock up a teenager for a year,
825.107	with a 60 percent chance that that person
825.107	will return to the very same system.
829.583	That is a terrible return on investment.
834.706	Number two: it's the right thing to do.
837.004	If prosecutors were a part
837.004	of creating the problem,
839.983	it's incumbent on us to create a solution
842.236	and we can do that using other disciplines
844.307	that have already done the data
844.307	and research for us.
846.847	And number three:
848.04	your voice and your vote
848.04	can make that happen.
850.665	The next time there's a local
850.665	district attorney's election
853.369	in your jurisdiction,
854.545	ask candidates these questions.
856.063	One: What are you doing to make
856.063	me and my neighbors safer?
859.274	Two: What data are you collecting,
861.678	and how are you training your prosecutors
863.923	to make sure that it's working?
865.618	And number three:
866.807	If it's not working for everybody,
868.687	what are you doing to fix it?
870.562	If they can't answer the questions,
872.298	they shouldn't be doing the job.
875.48	Each one of you that raised your hand
875.48	at the beginning of this talk
878.721	is a living, breathing example
878.721	of the power of opportunity,
882.183	of intervention,
883.358	of support
884.533	and of love.
885.838	While each of you may have faced
885.838	your own brand of discipline
888.763	for whatever malfeasances you committed,
890.9	barely any of you needed a day in jail
892.789	to make you the people
892.789	that you are today --
894.892	some of the greatest minds on the planet.
897.748	Every day, thousands of times a day,
899.651	prosecutors around the United States
899.651	wield power so great
902.621	that it can bring about catastrophe
904.385	as quickly as it can
904.385	bring about opportunity,
906.987	intervention,
908.243	support
909.426	and yes, even love.
912.758	Those qualities are the hallmarks
912.758	of a strong community,
915.688	and a strong community is a safe one.
917.506	If our communities are broken,
918.986	don't let the lawyers
918.986	that you elect fix them
921.107	with outdated, inefficient,
921.107	expensive methods.
923.314	Demand more; vote for the prosecutor
