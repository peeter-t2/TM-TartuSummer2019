12.61	What do you do if you had
12.61	to figure out the information
15.29	behind 11.5 million documents,
17.715	verify it and make sense of it?
20.15	That was a challenge
21.326	that a group of journalists
21.326	had to face late last year.
24.662	An anonymous person
24.662	calling himself John Doe
28.122	had somehow managed to copy
28.122	nearly 40 years of records
31.198	of the Panamanian law firm
31.198	Mossack Fonseca.
35.317	This is one of many firms around the world
38.031	that specialize in setting up accounts
38.031	in offshore tax havens
41.586	like the British Virgin Islands,
43.61	for rich and powerful people
43.61	who like to keep secrets.
48.195	John Doe had managed to copy
48.195	every spreadsheet from this firm,
51.757	every client file,
53.375	every email,
55.098	from 1977 to the present day.
58.912	It represented the biggest cache
61.251	of inside information
61.251	into the tax haven system
64.061	that anyone had ever seen.
66.092	But it also presented a gigantic challenge
66.092	to investigative journalism.
71.87	Think about it:
76.335	containing the secrets of people
76.335	from more than 200 different countries.
80.449	Where do you start
80.449	with such a vast resource?
82.95	Where do you even begin to tell a story
85.053	that can trail off
85.053	into every corner of the globe,
88.367	and that can affect almost
88.367	any person in any language,
91.436	sometimes in ways
91.436	they don't even know yet.
94.513	John Doe had given the information
94.513	to two journalists
97.039	at the German newspaper
97.039	Süddeutsche Zeitung.
100.562	He said he was motivated
100.562	by -- and I quote --
103.82	"""The scale of the injustice"
103.82	"that the documents would reveal."""
108.401	But one user alone can never make sense
110.408	of such a vast amount of information.
112.362	So the Süddeutsche Zeitung reached out
114.248	to my organization in Washington, DC,
117.016	The International Consortium
117.016	of Investigative Journalists.
121.926	We decided to do something
121.926	that was the very opposite
124.524	of everything we'd been taught
124.524	to do as journalists:
127.289	share.
128.468	(Laughter)
130.324	By nature, investigative
130.324	reporters are lone wolves.
134.002	We fiercely guard our secrets,
135.855	at times even from our editors,
137.413	because we know that the moment
137.413	we tell them what we have,
140.297	they'll want that story right away.
142.691	And to be frank,
144.607	when you get a good story,
146.053	you like to keep the glory to yourself.
149.733	But there's no doubt
149.733	that we live in a shrinking world,
152.366	and that the media has largely
152.366	been slow to wake up to this.
155.559	The issues we report on
155.559	are more and more transnational.
159.135	Giant corporations operate
159.135	on a global level.
162.441	Environmental and health
162.441	crises are global.
165.758	So, too, are financial flows
165.758	and financial crises.
169.488	So it seems staggering
169.488	that journalism has been so late
172.516	to cover stories in a truly global way.
175.783	And it also seems staggering
175.783	that journalism has been so slow
178.811	to wake up to the possibilities
178.811	that technology brings,
182.244	rather than being frightened of it.
185.666	The reason journalists
185.666	are scared of technology is this:
189.477	the profession's largest institutions
189.477	are going through tough times
193.061	because of the changing way
193.061	that people are consuming news.
196.958	The advertising business models
196.958	that have sustained reporting are broken.
201.89	And this has plunged
201.89	journalism into crisis,
204.572	forcing those institutions
204.572	to reexamine how they function.
210.258	But where there is crisis,
211.935	there is also opportunity.
214.013	The first challenge presented
215.491	by what would eventually become
215.491	known as the Panama Papers
218.363	was to make the documents
218.363	searchable and readable.
220.936	There were nearly five million emails,
223.587	two million PDFs that needed
223.587	to be scanned and indexed,
226.924	and millions more files
226.924	and other kinds of documents.
230.162	They all needed to be housed
230.162	in a safe and secure location
233.023	in the cloud.
234.961	We next invited reporters
234.961	to have a look at the documents.
238.456	In all, reporters from more
238.456	than 100 media organizations
242.34	in 76 countries --
244.433	from the BBC in Britain
246.502	to Le Monde newspaper in France
248.742	to the Asahi Shimbun in Japan.
252.473	"""Native eyes on native names,"""
252.473	we called it, the idea being,
256.247	who best to tell you
256.247	who was important to Nigeria
259.63	than a Nigerian journalist?
261.623	Who best in Canada than a Canadian?
264.247	There were only two rules
264.247	for everyone who was invited:
267.327	we all agreed to share everything
267.327	that we found with everybody else,
272.335	and we all agreed to publish
272.335	together on the same day.
275.769	We chose our media partners based on trust
277.828	that had been built up through
277.828	previous smaller collaborations
281.07	and also from leads
281.07	that jumped out from the documents.
284.625	Over the next few months,
285.884	my small nonprofit organization
285.884	of less than 20 people
288.566	was joined by more than 350 other
288.566	reporters from 25 language groups.
294.035	The biggest information leak in history
295.981	had now spawned the biggest
295.981	journalism collaboration in history:
	what journalists normally never do,
306.203	working shoulder to shoulder,
307.838	sharing information,
309.488	but telling no one.
312.102	For it became clear at this point
313.725	that in order to make
313.725	the biggest kind of noise,
316.106	we first needed
316.106	the biggest kind of silence.
320.49	To manage the project
320.49	over the many months it would take,
323.244	we built a secure virtual newsroom.
325.085	We used encrypted communication systems,
328.157	and we built a specially
328.157	designed search engine.
330.871	Inside the virtual newsroom,
332.522	the reporters could gather
332.522	around the themes
334.633	that were emerging from the documents.
336.638	Those interested in blood diamonds
336.638	or exotic art, for instance,
341.968	could share information about how
341.968	the offshore world was being used
345.182	to hide the trade in both
345.182	of those commodities.
347.413	Those interested in sport
347.413	could share information
349.877	about how famous sports stars
349.877	were putting their image rights
353.166	into offshore companies,
354.714	thereby likely avoiding taxes
357.001	in the countries
357.001	where they plied their trade.
360.097	But perhaps most exciting of all
361.909	were the number of world leaders
361.909	and elect politicians
365.41	that were emerging from the documents --
368.54	figures like Petro Poroshenko in Ukraine,
372.824	close associates
372.824	of Vladimir Putin in Russia
377.852	and the British Prime Minister,
377.852	David Cameron, who is linked
381.033	through his late father, Ian Cameron.
384.529	Buried in the documents
384.529	were secret offshore entities,
387.784	such as Wintris Inc.,
390.427	a company in the British Virgin Islands
392.327	that had actually belonged
392.327	to the sitting Icelandic prime minister.
396.435	I like to refer to Johannes Kristjansson,
398.87	the Icelandic reporter
398.87	we invited to join the project,
401.811	as the loneliest man in the world.
404.231	For nine months, he refused paid work
406.544	and lived off the earnings of his wife.
409.308	He pasted tarps
409.308	over the windows of his home
411.415	to prevent prying eyes
411.415	during the long Icelandic winter.
415.505	And he soon ran out of excuses
415.505	to explain his many absences,
419.327	as he worked red-eyed,
420.917	night after night,
422.147	month after month.
423.972	In all that time, he sat on information
426.344	that would eventually bring down
426.344	the leader of his country.
430.1	Now, when you're an investigative reporter
430.1	and you make an amazing discovery,
433.813	such as your prime minster can be linked
433.813	to a secret offshore company,
437.718	that that company has a financial
437.718	interest in Icelandic banks --
441.868	the very issue he's been elected on --
444.242	well, your instinct
444.242	is to scream out very loud.
448.044	Instead, as one of the few people
448.044	that he could speak to,
450.962	Johannes and I shared
450.962	a kind of gallows humor.
454.391	"""Wintris is coming,"" he used to say."
456.136	(Laughter)
457.689	(Applause)
461.314	"We were big fans of ""Game of Thrones."""
464.759	When reporters like Johannes
464.759	wanted to scream,
467.919	they did so inside the virtual newsroom,
470.618	and then they turned
470.618	those screams into stories
472.861	by going outside the documents
472.861	to court records,
476.479	official company registers,
478.163	and by eventually putting questions
478.163	to those that we intended to name.
483.178	Panama Papers actually allowed
483.178	the reporters to look at the world
487.234	through a different lens
487.234	from everybody else.
489.874	As we were researching the story,
491.818	unconnected to us,
493.26	a major political bribery scandal
493.26	happened in Brazil.
497.339	A new leader was elected in Argentina.
500.608	The FBI began to indict officials at FIFA,
504.523	the organization that controls
504.523	the world of professional soccer.
509.089	The Panama Papers
509.089	actually had unique insights
511.39	into each one of these unfolding events.
513.66	So you can imagine the pressure
513.66	and the ego dramas
517.124	that could have ruined
517.124	what we were trying to do.
519.637	Any of one of these journalists,
521.199	they could have broken the pact.
522.944	But they didn't.
524.464	And on April 3 this year,
526.056	at exactly 8pm German time,
528.261	we published simultaneously
528.261	in 76 countries.
532.22	(Applause)
543.64	The Panama Papers quickly became
543.64	one of the biggest stories of the year.
547.276	This is the scene in Iceland
547.276	the day after we published.
550.504	It was the first of many protests.
553.047	The Icelandic prime minister
553.047	had to resign.
555.431	It was a first of many resignations.
558.275	We spotlighted many famous people
558.275	such as Lionel Messi,
561.862	the most famous
561.862	soccer player in the world.
564.726	And there were some
564.726	unintended consequences.
567.454	These alleged members
567.454	of a Mexican drug cartel were arrested
571.155	after we published details
571.155	about their hideout.
574.615	They'd been using the address
576.579	to register their offshore company.
578.573	(Laughter)
583.091	There's a kind of irony
583.091	in what we've been able to do.
585.676	The technology -- the Internet --
585.676	that has broken the business model
589.406	is allowing us to reinvent
589.406	journalism itself.
592.516	And this dynamic is producing
594.228	unprecedented levels
594.228	of transparency and impact.
597.772	We showed how a group of journalists
597.772	can effect change across the world
601.282	by applying new methods
601.282	and old-fashioned journalism techniques
605.286	to vast amounts of leaked information.
608.319	We put all-important context
608.319	around what was given to us by John Doe.
613.205	And by sharing resources,
614.814	we were able to dig deep --
616.527	much deeper and longer than most
616.527	media organizations allow these days,
620.926	because of financial concerns.
623.5	Now, it was a big risk,
625.107	and it wouldn't work for every story,
627.119	but we showed with the Panama Papers
629.147	that you can write about any country
629.147	from just about anywhere,
632.109	and then choose your preferred
632.109	battleground to defend your work.
636.195	Try obtaining a court injunction
637.794	that would prevent the telling
637.794	of a story in 76 different countries.
642.377	Try stopping the inevitable.
645.353	Shortly after we published,
645.353	I got a three-word text from Johannes:
649.804	"""Wintris has arrived."""
652.046	(Laughter)
653.468	It had arrived and so, too, perhaps
653.468	has a new era for journalism.
657.673	Thank you.
658.853	(Applause)
669.612	Bruno Giussani: Gerard, thank you.
671.296	I guess you're going to send
671.296	that applause to the 350 journalists
674.395	who worked with you, right?
675.997	Now, a couple of questions
675.997	I would like to ask.
678.232	The first one is,
679.423	you'd been working
679.423	in secrecy for over a year
682.115	with 350-something colleagues
682.115	from all over the world --
685.765	was there ever a moment when you thought
689.12	that the leak may be leaked,
691.272	that the collaboration may just be broken
693.999	by somebody publishing a story?
695.602	Or somebody not in the group
695.602	releasing some information
698.444	that they got to know?
700.228	Gerard Ryle: We had a series
700.228	of crises along the way,
702.904	including when something major
702.904	was happening in the world,
705.659	the journalists from that country
705.659	wanted to publish right away.
708.706	We had to calm them down.
709.939	Probably the biggest crisis we had
709.939	was a week before publication.
713.107	We'd sent a series of questions
713.107	to the associates of Vladimir Putin,
717.142	but instead of responding,
718.659	the Kremlin actually held
718.659	a press conference and denounced us,
721.646	and denounced the whole thing
721.646	as being, I guess, a plot from the West.
725.087	At that point, Putin thought
725.087	it was just about him.
728.127	And, of course, a lot of editors
728.127	around the world
730.655	were very nervous about this.
732.38	They thought the story
732.38	was going to get out.
734.467	You can imagine the amount
734.467	of time they'd spent,
736.744	the amount of resources,
736.744	money spent on this.
738.927	So I had to basically spend
738.927	the last week calming everyone down,
741.988	a bit like a general,
741.988	where you're holding your troops back:
744.894	"""Calm, remain calm."""
746.218	And then eventually,
746.218	of course, they all did.
749.323	BG: And then a couple weeks ago or so,
751.815	you released a lot of the documents
751.815	as an open database
755.808	for everybody to search
755.808	via keyword, essentially.
759.029	GR: We very much believe
760.218	that the basic information
760.218	about the offshore world
762.644	should be made public.
763.821	Now, we didn't publish
763.821	the underlying documents
766.722	of the journalists we're working with.
768.611	But the basic information
768.611	such as the name of a person,
771.217	what their offshore company was
771.217	and the name of that company,
774.165	is now all available online.
775.545	In fact, the biggest resource
775.545	of its kind basically is out there now
780.374	BG: Gerard, thank you for the work you do.
782.271	GR: Thank you.
783.453	(Applause)
