15.805	Two years ago, after having served four years
18.23	in the United States Marine Corps
19.89	and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,
22.25	I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team
25.199	of veterans and medical professionals
27.436	in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,
29.869	three days after the earthquake.
31.395	We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,
33.558	the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,
37.089	we realized something. Military veterans
40.095	are very, very good at disaster response.
43.108	And coming home, my cofounder and I,
45.583	we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.
48.846	The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.
51.852	It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,
55.166	and it's not using the best people.
57.547	The second problem that we became aware of
59.752	was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,
62.23	and this is a topic that is front page news right now
64.375	as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,
66.536	and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.
69.686	And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,
71.566	and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.
74.3	These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?
77.762	Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity
80.832	for service for the veterans coming home.
83.233	Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want
85.733	to continue their service when they take off their uniform.
87.973	And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.
91.643	Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,
94.706	we responded to the tsunami in Chile,
97.715	the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.
101.609	But it was earlier this year, when one of our
104.241	original members caused us to shift focus in the organization.
108.346	This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.
111.091	We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.
113.417	Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.
117.351	Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.
121.237	This was a tragedy, but it really forced us
123.967	to refocus what it is that we were doing.
127.245	You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened
130.709	in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself
133.317	because of what he lost when he came home.
136.466	He lost purpose. He lost his community.
139.931	And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.
144.366	And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled
147.54	from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --
151.854	in the initial iteration of our organization,
155.094	we were a disaster response organization that was using
157.967	veteran service. We had a lot of success,
160.206	and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.
164.419	But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,
167.828	now moving forward, we see ourselves
170.304	as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.
175.197	Because we think that we can give that purpose
177.807	and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.
180.988	And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later
183.219	Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.
186.92	Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy
190.329	who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.
192.805	He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
195.369	They send him to Iraq.
197.041	Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.
199.768	That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.
203.372	It's to keep the men around him alive.
205.461	It's to pacify the village that he works in.
207.647	He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,
211.311	maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,
213.909	but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.
216.273	You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri
218.413	after a tornado, he regains that.
220.773	Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school
223.822	in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,
225.767	the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.
228.475	Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.
231.382	He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.
234.543	He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.
236.726	They've eaten together. They've bled together.
239.425	He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.
241.823	He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.
244.883	He doesn't have that community anymore.
246.222	But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,
249.456	they get that sense of community back.
251.947	Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates
254.386	high school in Kansas City.
256.042	He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.
257.758	They send him to Iraq.
259.297	They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.
263.652	He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones
266.07	in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.
268.683	He doesn't have that same self-worth.
270.956	But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,
273.568	and somebody once again is walking up to him
275.388	and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,
277.762	now they have self-worth again.
280.079	I think it's very important, because right now
282.4	somebody needs to step up,
284.163	and this generation of veterans has the opportunity
286.114	to do that if they are given the chance.
288.399	Thank you very much. (Applause)
