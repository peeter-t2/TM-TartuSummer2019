12.765	Well, you know, sometimes
14.276	the most important things come
14.276	in the smallest packages.
17.258	I am going to try to convince you,
17.258	in the 15 minutes I have,
20.847	that microbes have a lot to say
20.847	about questions such as,
25.1	"""Are we alone?"""
26.998	and they can tell us more about
26.998	not only life in our solar system
32.223	but also maybe beyond,
34.1	and this is why I am tracking them down
34.1	in the most impossible places on Earth,
39.397	in extreme environments where conditions
41.766	are really pushing them
41.766	to the brink of survival.
44.45	Actually, sometimes me too,
44.45	when I'm trying to follow them too close.
47.704	But here's the thing:
49.521	We are the only advanced civilization
49.521	in the solar system,
55.134	but that doesn't mean that there is
55.134	no microbial life nearby.
58.878	In fact, the planets
58.878	and moons you see here
62.663	could host life -- all of them --
62.663	and we know that,
66.633	and it's a strong possibility.
69.482	And if we were going to find life
69.482	on those moons and planets,
74.135	then we would answer questions such as,
77.151	are we alone in the solar system?
79.287	Where are we coming from?
81.256	Do we have family in the neighborhood?
84.233	Is there life beyond our solar system?
88.157	And we can ask all those questions
88.157	because there has been a revolution
92.244	in our understanding
92.244	of what a habitable planet is,
96.52	and today, a habitable planet is a planet
99.86	that has a zone where
99.86	water can stay stable,
104.193	but to me this is a horizontal
104.193	definition of habitability,
107.922	because it involves a distance to a star,
110.197	but there is another
110.197	dimension to habitability,
113.169	and this is a vertical dimension.
115.84	Think of it as
119.527	conditions in the subsurface of a planet
119.527	where you are very far away from a sun,
126.21	but you still have water,
126.21	energy, nutrients,
129.353	which for some of them means food,
131.304	and a protection.
133.207	And when you look at the Earth,
135.251	very far away from any sunlight,
135.251	deep in the ocean,
139.796	you have life thriving
141.665	and it uses only chemistry
141.665	for life processes.
145.676	So when you think of it 
145.676	at that point, all walls collapse.
151.326	You have no limitations, basically.
153.6	And if you have been looking
153.6	at the headlines lately,
156.16	then you will see that we have
156.16	discovered a subsurface ocean
159.12	on Europa, on Ganymede,
159.12	on Enceladus, on Titan,
162.989	and now we are finding a geyser
162.989	and hot springs on Enceladus,
165.923	Our solar system is turning
165.923	into a giant spa.
169.978	For anybody who has gone to a spa
169.978	knows how much microbes like that, right?
173.864	(Laughter)
175.582	So at that point, think also about Mars.
179.111	There is no life possible
179.111	at the surface of Mars today,
182.478	but it might still be hiding underground.
185.729	So, we have been making progress
185.729	in our understanding of habitability,
191.339	but we also have been making progress
191.339	in our understanding
194.111	of what the signatures
194.111	of life are on Earth.
197.687	And you can have what we call
197.687	organic molecules,
200.543	and these are the bricks of life,
202.47	and you can have fossils,
204.35	and you can minerals, biominerals,
207.253	which is due to the reaction
207.253	between bacteria and rocks,
210.643	and of course you can have
210.643	gases in the atmosphere.
213.777	And when you look at those
213.777	tiny green algae
215.983	on the right of the slide here,
217.934	they are the direct descendants
217.934	of those who have been pumping oxygen
221.45	a billion years ago
221.45	in the atmosphere of the Earth.
223.843	When they did that, they poisoned
226.465	at the surface of the Earth,
227.987	but they are the reason why
227.987	you are breathing this air today.
232.74	But as much as our understanding grows
232.74	of all of these things,
237.925	there is one question
237.925	we still cannot answer,
240.851	and this is, where are we coming from?
243.126	And you know, it's getting worse,
244.844	because we won't be able
244.844	to find the physical evidence
247.886	of where we are coming from
247.886	on this planet,
250.44	and the reason being is that anything that
250.44	is older than four billion years is gone.
256.13	All record is gone,
257.754	erased by plate tectonics and erosion.
261.632	This is what I call the Earth's
261.632	biological horizon.
265.184	Beyond this horizon we don't know
265.184	where we are coming from.
268.667	So is everything lost? Well, maybe not.
271.593	And we might be able to find
271.593	evidence of our own origin
275.308	in the most unlikely place,
275.308	and this place in Mars.
279.929	How is this possible?
281.42	Well clearly at the beginning
281.42	of the solar system,
284.201	Mars and the Earth were bombarded
284.201	by giant asteroids and comets,
289.169	and there were ejecta
289.169	from these impacts all over the place.
292.327	Earth and Mars kept throwing rocks
292.327	at each other for a very long time.
296.187	Pieces of rocks landed on the Earth.
298.23	Pieces of the Earth landed on Mars.
300.181	So clearly, those two planets may have
300.181	been seeded by the same material.
305.359	So yeah, maybe Granddady is sitting
305.359	there on the surface and waiting for us.
310.659	But that also means that we can go to Mars
310.659	and try to find traces of our own origin.
318.19	Mars may hold that secret for us.
320.442	This is why Mars is so special to us.
323.15	But for that to happen,
325.16	Mars needed to be habitable
325.16	at the time when conditions were right.
330.544	So was Mars habitable?
332.4	We have a number of missions
332.4	telling us exactly the same thing today.
336.254	At the time when life
336.254	appeared on the Earth,
339.992	Mars did have an ocean,
339.992	it had volcanoes, it had lakes,
344.83	and it had deltas like the beautiful
344.83	picture you see here.
347.673	This picture was sent by the Curiosity 
347.673	rover only a few weeks ago.
351.46	It shows the remnants of a delta,
351.46	and this picture tells us something:
355.142	water was abundant
357.096	and stayed founting at the surface
357.096	for a very long time.
359.757	This is good news for life.
361.568	Life chemistry takes a long time
361.568	to actually happen.
364.99	So this is extremely good news,
366.507	but does that mean that if we go there,
366.507	life will be easy to find on Mars?
370.127	Not necessarily.
372.01	Here's what happened:
373.861	At the time when life exploded
373.861	at the surface of the Earth,
377.23	then everything went south for Mars,
379.369	literally.
380.901	The atmosphere was
380.901	stripped away by solar winds,
384.472	Mars lost its magnetosphere,
386.775	and then cosmic rays and U.V.
386.775	bombarded the surface
391.187	and water escaped to space
391.187	and went underground.
395.41	So if we want to be able to understand,
398.501	if we want to be able to find those traces
398.501	of the signatures of life
403.43	at the surface of Mars, if they are there,
405.644	we need to understand what was
405.644	the impact of each of these events
408.831	on the preservation of its record.
412.484	Only then will we be able
412.484	to know where those signatures are hiding,
417.314	and only then will we be able
417.314	to send our rover to the right places
420.997	where we can sample those rocks
420.997	that may be telling us something
424.146	really important about who we are,
426.862	or, if not, maybe telling us
426.862	that somewhere, independently,
430.972	life has appeared on another planet.
433.828	So to do that, it's easy.
436.336	You only need to go back
436.336	3.5 billion years ago
439.894	in the past of a planet.
442.285	We just need a time machine.
444.909	Easy, right?
447.103	Well, actually, it is.
448.673	Look around you -- that's planet Earth.
450.574	This is our time machine.
452.618	Geologists are using it
452.618	to go back in the past of our own planet.
456.788	I am using it a little bit differently.
458.971	I use planet Earth to go
458.971	in very extreme environments
461.966	where conditions were similar
461.966	to those of Mars
464.868	at the time when the climate changed,
466.865	and there I'm trying 
466.865	to understand what happened.
469.745	What are the signatures of life?
471.439	What is left? How are we going to find it?
474.272	So for one moment now
474.272	I'm going to take you with me
477.276	on a trip into that time machine.
480.13	And now, what you see here,
480.13	we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,
484.865	but in fact we are less than a billion
484.865	years after the Earth and Mars formed.
491.594	The Earth and Mars will have looked
491.594	pretty much exactly like that --
495.285	volcanoes everywhere,
495.285	evaporating lakes everywhere,
498.796	minerals, hot springs,
502.103	and then you see those mounds
502.103	on the shore of those lakes?
505.934	Those are built by the descendants
505.934	of the first organisms
509.394	that gave us the first fossil on Earth.
512.496	But if we want to understand what's 
512.496	going on, we need to go a little further.
516.555	And the other thing about those sites
518.47	is that exactly like on Mars
518.47	three and a half billion years ago,
521.946	the climate is changing very fast,
521.946	and water and ice are disappearing.
526.463	But we need to go back to that time
526.463	when everything changed on Mars,
529.678	and to do that, we need to go higher.
532.441	Why is that?
533.858	Because when you go higher,
535.215	the atmosphere is getting thinner,
535.215	it's getting more unstable,
538.337	the temperature is getting cooler,
538.337	and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.
543.648	Basically,
544.457	you are getting to those conditions
544.457	on Mars when everything changed.
550.34	So I was not promising anything about
550.34	a leisurely trip on the time machine.
556.837	You are not going to be sitting
556.837	in that time machine.
559.371	You have to haul 1,000 pounds
559.371	of equipment to the summit
562.399	of this 20,000-foot volcano
562.399	in the Andes here.
566.184	That's about 6,000 meters.
568.784	And you also have to sleep
568.784	on 42-degree slopes
572.407	and really hope that there won't
572.407	be any earthquake that night.
575.518	But when we get to the summit,
575.518	we actually find the lake we came for.
580.464	At this altitude, this lake is
580.464	experiencing exactly the same conditions
585.126	as those on Mars
585.126	three and a half billion years ago.
588.245	And now we have to change our voyage
591.17	into an inner voyage inside that lake,
593.89	and to do that, we have to remove
593.89	our mountain gear
597.541	and actually don suits and go for it.
602.277	But at the time we enter that lake,
602.277	at the very moment we enter that lake,
606.452	we are stepping back
608.38	three and a half billion years
608.38	in the past of another planet,
611.561	and then we are going to get
611.561	the answer came for.
616.511	Life is everywhere, absolutely everywhere.
619.633	Everything you see in this picture
619.633	is a living organism.
622.953	Maybe not so the diver,
622.953	but everything else.
627.626	But this picture is very deceiving.
630.853	Life is abundant in those lakes,
633.523	but like in many places on Earth 
633.523	right now and due to climate change,
637.63	there is a huge loss in biodiversity.
640.744	In the samples that we took back home,
	were composed of three species,
649.556	and those three species are the ones
649.556	that have survived so far.
653.375	Here's another lake,
653.375	right next to the first one.
656.162	The red color you see here
656.162	is not due to minerals.
659.83	It's actually due to the presence
659.83	of a tiny algae.
663.151	In this region, the U.V. radiation
663.151	is really nasty.
667.66	Anywhere on Earth, 11
667.66	is considered to be extreme.
671.129	During U.V. storms there,
671.129	the U.V. Index reaches 43.
675.73	SPF 30 is not going to do anything 
675.73	to you over there,
679.976	and the water is so
679.976	transparent in those lakes
683.342	that the algae has
683.342	nowhere to hide, really,
686.675	and so they are developing
686.675	their own sunscreen,
688.965	and this is the red color you see.
690.749	But they can adapt only so far,
693.31	and then when all the water
693.31	is gone from the surface,
695.788	microbes have only one solution left:
698.388	They go underground.
700.246	And those microbes, the rocks
700.246	you see in that slide here,
703.171	well, they are actually
703.171	living inside rocks
706.391	and they are using the protection
706.391	of the translucence of the rocks
709.585	to get the good part of the U.V.
711.382	and discard the part that could
711.382	actually damage their DNA.
715.126	And this is why we are taking our rover
717.401	to train them to search 
717.401	for life on Mars in these areas,
720.977	because if there was life on Mars
720.977	three and a half billion years ago,
724.714	it had to use the same strategy
724.714	to actually protect itself.
729.864	Now, it is pretty obvious
732.242	that going to extreme environments
732.242	is helping us very much
735.77	for the exploration of Mars 
735.77	and to prepare missions.
739.761	So far, it has helped us to understand
739.761	the geology of Mars.
744.1	It has helped to understand the past
744.1	climate of Mars and its evolution,
748.221	but also its habitability potential.
751.208	Our most recent rover on Mars
751.208	has discovered traces of organics.
756.747	Yeah, there are organics
756.747	at the surface of Mars.
759.706	And it also discovered traces of methane.
763.607	And we don't know yet
763.607	if the methane in question
766.152	is really from geology or biology.
769.99	Regardless, what we know is
769.99	that because of the discovery,
774.859	the hypothesis that there is still
774.859	life present on Mars today
778.1	remains a viable one.
780.455	So by now, I think I have convinced you
780.455	that Mars is very special to us,
785.652	but it would be a mistake to think
785.652	that Mars is the only place
788.628	in the solar system that is interesting
788.628	to find potential microbial life.
794.434	And the reason is because
794.434	Mars and the Earth
798.352	could have a common root
798.352	to their tree of life,
801.143	but when you go beyond Mars,
801.143	it's not that easy.
805.29	Celestial mechanics 
805.29	is not making it so easy
807.9	for an exchange
807.9	of material between planets,
810.315	and so if we were to discover
810.315	life on those planets,
814.355	it would be different from us.
816.212	It would be a different type of life.
818.05	But in the end, it might be just us,
820.903	it might be us and Mars,
822.899	or it can be many trees of life
822.899	in the solar system.
826.382	I don't know the answer yet,
826.382	but I can tell you something:
830.11	No matter what the result is,
830.11	no matter what that magic number is,
834.542	it is going to give us a standard
836.553	by which we are going to be able 
836.553	to measure the life potential,
841.081	abundance and diversity
841.081	beyond our own solar system.
844.191	And this can be achieved
844.191	by our generation.
846.751	This can be our legacy,
846.751	but only if we dare to explore.
851.654	Now, finally,
853.74	if somebody tells you that looking 
853.74	for alien microbes is not cool
857.708	because you cannot have
857.708	a philosophical conversation with them,
861.138	let me show you why and how
861.138	you can tell them they're wrong.
867.804	Well, organic material
867.804	is going to tell you
870.572	about environment, about complexity
870.572	and about diversity.
876.231	DNA, or any information carrier,
876.231	is going to tell you about adaptation,
882.35	about evolution, about survival,
882.35	about planetary changes
887.371	and about the transfer of information.
890.219	All together, they are telling us
893.307	what started as a microbial pathway,
897.208	and why what started
897.208	as a microbial pathway
900.226	sometimes ends up as a civilization
903.686	or sometimes ends up as a dead end.
907.308	Look at the solar system,
907.308	and look at the Earth.
910.724	On Earth, there are many
910.724	intelligent species,
913.531	but only one has achieved technology.
916.898	Right here in the journey
916.898	of our own solar system,
920.195	there is a very, very powerful message
922.934	that says here's how we should look 
922.934	for alien life, small and big.
928.32	So yeah, microbes are talking
928.32	and we are listening,
931.618	and they are taking us,
933.337	one planet at a time
933.337	and one moon at a time,
935.891	towards their big brothers out there.
938.77	And they are telling us about diversity,
941.486	they are telling us about
941.486	abundance of life,
944.11	and they are telling us
944.11	how this life has survived thus far
948.15	to reach civilization,
951.192	intelligence, technology
951.192	and, indeed, philosophy.
956.174	Thank you.
957.879	(Applause)
