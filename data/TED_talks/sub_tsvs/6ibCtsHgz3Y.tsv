12.607	So I was trained to become a gymnast
15.319	for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
18.975	When I was in the first grade, the government
21.52	wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,
24.127	all expenses paid.
26.175	"But my tiger mother said, ""No."""
28.823	My parents wanted me to become
30.959	an engineer like them.
33.063	After surviving the Cultural Revolution,
35.15	they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:
38.959	a safe and well-paid job.
41.892	It is not important if I like the job or not.
44.687	But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
49.967	That is me playing my imaginary piano.
53.615	An opera singer must start training young
55.799	to learn acrobatics,
57.383	so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
60.327	I even wrote to the school principal
62.594	and the host of a radio show.
65.355	But no adults liked the idea.
69.161	No adults believed I was serious.
71.884	Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,
75.128	just as powerless as I was.
77.884	So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
83.649	My dream would never come true.
86.616	I was afraid that for the rest of my life
89.924	some second-class happiness
91.961	would be the best I could hope for.
94.498	But that's so unfair.
96.926	So I was determined to find another calling.
100.728	Nobody around to teach me? Fine.
103.465	I turned to books.
105.697	I satisfied my hunger for parental advice
109.339	"from this book by a family of writers and musicians.[""Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei""]"
114.216	I found my role model of an independent woman
117.289	"when Confucian tradition requires obedience.[""Jane Eyre""]"
121.133	"And I learned to be efficient from this book.[""Cheaper by the Dozen""]"
124.83	And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.
128.795	"[""Complete Works of Sanmao"" (aka Echo Chan)] [""Lessons From History"" by Nan Huaijin]"
130.866	I came to the U.S. in 1995,
134.057	so which books did I read here first?
136.938	Books banned in China, of course.
140.463	"""The Good Earth"" is about Chinese peasant life."
144.133	That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
148.235	The Bible is interesting, but strange.
151.96	(Laughter)
154.445	That's a topic for a different day.
157.916	But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:
161.211	"""You shall honor your father and mother."""
164.19	"""Honor,"" I said. ""That's so different,"
167.14	"and better, than obey."""
168.879	So it becomes my tool to climb out
171.383	of this Confucian guilt trap
173.499	and to restart my relationship with my parents.
177.771	Encountering a new culture also started my habit
180.793	of comparative reading.
182.565	It offers many insights.
184.42	For example, I found this map out of place at first
189.2	because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
194.085	It had never occurred to me,
195.586	China doesn't have to be at the center of the world.
198.721	A map actually carries somebody's view.
202.974	Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
205.382	It's a standard practice in the academic world.
208.686	There are even research fields
210.154	such as comparative religion and comparative literature.
214.099	Compare and contrast gives scholars
216.334	a more complete understanding of a topic.
219.34	So I thought, well, if comparative reading
221.093	works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
224.929	So I started reading books in pairs.
228.304	So they can be about people --
229.518	"[""Benjamin Franklin"" by Walter Isaacson][""John Adams"" by David McCullough] --"
230.401	who are involved in the same event,
232.909	or friends with shared experiences.
235.588	"[""Personal History"" by Katharine Graham][""The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,"" by Alice Schroeder]"
236.988	I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter)
241.386	"[Holy Bible: King James Version][""Lamb"" by Chrisopher Moore] --"
243.498	or similar stories from different cultures,
246.635	"as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.[""The Power of Myth"" by Joseph Campbell]"
249.516	For example, both the Christ and the Buddha
252.909	went through three temptations.
255.342	For the Christ, the temptations
257.144	are economic, political and spiritual.
261.119	For the Buddha, they are all psychological:
265.445	lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
272.763	So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun
275.802	to read your favorite books in two languages.
277.699	"[""The Way of Chuang Tzu"" Thomas Merton][""Tao: The Watercourse Way"" Alan Watts]"
278.951	Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
282.527	For example, it's through translation that I realized
286.735	"""happiness"" in Chinese literally means ""fast joy."" Huh!"
292.708	"""Bride"" in Chinese literally means ""new mother."" Uh-oh."
297.997	(Laughter)
301.258	Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people
306.645	of the past and the present.
309.29	I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
313.525	Having a dream shattered really is nothing
316.202	compared to what many others have suffered.
319.138	I have come to believe that coming true
321.866	is not the only purpose of a dream.
325.146	Its most important purpose is to get us in touch
329.047	with where dreams come from,
331.162	where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
334.066	Even a shattered dream can do that for you.
338.288	So because of books, I'm here today,
340.542	happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,
344.202	most of the time.
345.952	So may books be always with you.
349.513	Thank you.
350.991	(Applause)
352.839	Thank you. (Applause)
356.484	Thank you. (Applause)
