13.008	I am failing as a woman,
14.832	I am failing as a feminist.
17.452	I have passionate opinions
17.452	about gender equality,
20.229	but I worry that to freely accept
20.229	"the label of ""feminist,"""
24.314	would not be fair to good feminists.
27.184	I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one.
29.581	Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist.
32.469	Or at least, I wrote an essay,
34.826	and then I wrote a book
34.826	"called ""Bad Feminist,"""
37.025	and then in interviews, people started
37.025	calling me The Bad Feminist.
40.485	(Laughter)
41.675	So, what started as a bit
41.675	of an inside joke with myself
45.736	and a willful provocation,
47.441	has become a thing.
49.996	Let me take a step back.
52.076	When I was younger,
53.336	mostly in my teens and 20s,
55.273	I had strange ideas about feminists
57.702	as hairy, angry, man-hating,
57.702	sex-hating women --
61.502	as if those are bad things.
63.105	(Laughter)
66.978	These days, I look at how
66.978	women are treated the world over,
70.44	and anger, in particular, seems
70.44	like a perfectly reasonable response.
74.75	But back then,
76.519	I worried about the tone people used
78.322	when suggesting I might be a feminist.
81.322	The feminist label was an accusation,
83.904	"it was an ""F"" word, and not a nice one."
86.762	I was labeled a woman
86.762	who doesn't play by the rules,
89.682	who expects too much,
91.327	who thinks far too highly of myself,
93.344	by daring to believe I'm equal --
93.344	(Coughs) -- superior to a man.
98.04	You don't want to be that rebel woman,
99.909	until you realize that you
99.909	very much are that woman,
102.418	and cannot imagine being anyone else.
105.344	As I got older, I began to accept
107.388	that I am, indeed, a feminist,
107.388	and a proud one.
110.745	I hold certain truths to be self-evident:
113.563	Women are equal to men.
116.039	We deserve equal pay for equal work.
118.844	We have the right to move
118.844	through the world as we choose,
121.852	free from harassment or violence.
124.233	We have the right to easy,
124.233	affordable access to birth control,
127.811	and reproductive services.
129.732	We have the right to make choices
129.732	about our bodies,
132.327	free from legislative oversight
132.327	or evangelical doctrine.
136.504	We have the right to respect.
138.679	There's more.
139.909	When we talk about the needs of women,
142.148	we have to consider
142.148	the other identities we inhabit.
145.577	We are not just women.
147.518	We are people with different bodies,
149.389	gender expressions, faiths, sexualities,
152.428	class backgrounds, abilities,
152.428	and so much more.
155.708	We need to take into account
157.129	these differences and how they affect us,
159.589	as much as we account for
159.589	what we have in common.
162.68	Without this kind of inclusion,
162.68	our feminism is nothing.
167.22	I hold these truths to be self-evident,
167.22	but let me be clear:
170.895	I'm a mess.
172.056	I am full of contradictions.
174.337	There are many ways in which
174.337	I'm doing feminism wrong.
177.876	I have another confession.
179.416	When I drive to work, I listen
179.416	to thuggish rap at a very loud volume.
183.776	(Laughter)
185.307	Even though the lyrics
185.307	are degrading to women --
187.66	these lyrics offend me to my core --
190.479	the classic Yin Yang Twins
190.479	"song ""Salt Shaker"" --"
193.503	it is amazing.
194.979	(Laughter)
197.469	"""Make it work with your wet t-shirt."
200.421	Bitch, you gotta shake it
200.421	"'til your camel starts to hurt!"""
204.205	(Laughter)
205.387	Think about it.
206.436	(Laughter)
209.348	Poetry, right?
210.69	I am utterly mortified
210.69	by my music choices.
214.374	(Laughter)
216.31	I firmly believe in man work,
218.618	which is anything I don't
218.618	want to do, including --
221.051	(Laughter) --
222.956	all domestic tasks,
225.134	but also: bug killing, trash removal,
225.134	lawn care and vehicle maintenance.
230.014	I want no part of any of that.
231.905	(Laughter)
233.002	Pink is my favorite color.
234.923	I enjoy fashion magazines
234.923	and pretty things.
237.975	"I watch ""The Bachelor"""
237.975	and romantic comedies,
240.302	and I have absurd fantasies
240.302	about fairy tales coming true.
244.121	Some of my transgressions
244.121	are more flagrant.
246.914	If a woman wants to take
246.914	her husband's name,
249.304	that is her choice, and it is not
249.304	my place to judge.
252.622	If a woman chooses to stay home
252.622	to raise her children,
255.622	I embrace that choice, too.
257.737	The problem is not that she makes herself
257.737	economically vulnerable in that choice;
261.832	the problem is that our society is set up
264.002	to make women economically vulnerable
264.002	when they choose.
266.982	Let's deal with that.
269.601	(Applause)
275.413	I reject the mainstream feminism
277.508	that has historically ignored
277.508	or deflected the needs
280.159	of women of color, working-class women,
280.159	queer women and transgender women,
284.571	in favor of supporting white, middle-
284.571	and upper-class straight women.
287.968	Listen, if that's good feminism --
287.968	I am a very bad feminist.
291.648	(Laughter)
292.762	There is also this:
294.238	As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
296.984	We have this tendency to put
296.984	visible feminists on a pedestal.
300.677	We expect them to pose perfectly.
303.287	When they disappoint us,
304.471	we gleefully knock them
304.471	from the very pedestal we put them on.
307.957	Like I said, I am a mess --
310.016	consider me knocked off that pedestal
311.846	before you ever try to put me up there.
313.867	(Laughter)
315.374	Too many women,
316.458	particularly groundbreaking women
316.458	and industry leaders,
319.507	are afraid to be labeled as feminists.
321.869	They're afraid to stand up and say,
321.869	"""Yes, I am a feminist,"""
325.599	for fear of what that label means,
327.868	for fear of being unable to live up to
327.868	unrealistic expectations.
332.569	Take, for example, Beyoncé,
332.569	or as I call her, The Goddess.
336.365	(Laughter)
338.325	She has emerged, in recent years,
338.325	as a visible feminist.
341.781	At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards,
344.622	she performed in front of the word
344.622	"""feminist"" 10 feet high."
348.412	It was a glorious spectacle to see
350.643	this pop star openly embracing feminism
353.643	and letting young women and men know
355.396	that being a feminist
355.396	is something to celebrate.
358.985	As the moment faded, cultural critics
358.985	began endlessly debating
362.668	whether or not Beyoncé was,
362.668	indeed, a feminist.
365.693	They graded her feminism,
367.598	instead of simply taking a grown,
367.598	accomplished woman at her word.
371.89	(Laughter)
374.552	(Applause)
377.25	We demand perfection from feminists,
379.791	because we are still fighting for so much,
382.172	we want so much,
383.493	we need so damn much.
385.395	We go far beyond reasonable,
385.395	constructive criticism,
388.599	to dissecting any given woman's feminism,
391.372	tearing it apart
391.372	until there's nothing left.
394.253	We do not need to do that.
396.452	Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive
396.452	feminism -- is a starting point.
400.583	But what happens next?
402.592	We go from acknowledging
402.592	our imperfections to accountability,
406.098	or walking the walk,
406.098	and being a little bit brave.
409.888	If I listen to degrading music,
412.216	I am creating a demand for which
412.216	artists are more than happy
415.742	to contribute a limitless supply.
418.12	These artists are not going to change
420	how they talk about women in their songs
421.955	until we demand that change
421.955	by affecting their bottom line.
425.998	Certainly, it is difficult.
428.149	Why must it be so catchy?
430.561	(Laughter)
434.291	It's hard to make the better choice,
436.344	and it is so easy to justify a lesser one.
439.164	But --
440.226	when I justify bad choices,
442.005	I make it harder for women
442.005	to achieve equality,
444.948	the equality that we all deserve,
446.836	and I need to own that.
448.533	I think of my nieces, ages three and four.
451.826	They are gorgeous
451.826	and headstrong, brilliant girls,
454.289	who are a whole lot of brave.
456.284	I want them to thrive in a world
456.284	where they are valued
459.225	for the powerful creatures they are.
461.577	I think of them,
462.656	and suddenly, the better choice
462.656	becomes far easier to make.
466.775	We can all make better choices.
469.333	We can change the channel
469.333	when a television show
471.83	treats sexual violence
471.83	against women like sport,
474.548	Game of Thrones.
476	We can change the radio station
477.834	when we hear songs
477.834	that treat women as nothing.
481.063	We can spend our
481.063	box office dollars elsewhere
483.77	when movies don't treat women
485.32	as anything more than decorative objects.
487.743	We can stop supporting professional sports
490.008	where the athletes treat 
490.008	their partners like punching bags.
494.171	(Applause)
499.595	In other ways, men --
499.595	and especially straight white men --
502.566	"can say, ""No, I will not publish"
502.566	with your magazine,
505.677	or participate in your project,
505.677	or otherwise work with you,
508.987	until you include a fair number of women,
511.408	both as participants and decision makers.
514.67	I won't work with you
514.67	until your publication,
516.821	or your organization, is more inclusive
516.821	"of all kinds of difference."""
521.225	Those of us who are underrepresented
523.542	and invited to participate
523.542	in such projects,
525.735	can also decline to be included
528.128	until more of us are invited
528.128	through the glass ceiling,
531.155	and we are tokens no more.
533.553	Without these efforts,
535.251	without taking these stands,
537.077	our accomplishments
537.077	are going to mean very little.
540.365	We can commit these small acts of bravery
543.002	and hope that our choices trickle
543.002	upward to the people in power --
546.929	editors, movie and music producers,
549.564	CEOs, lawmakers --
551.961	the people who can make
551.961	bigger, braver choices
554.198	to create lasting, meaningful change.
557.678	We can also boldly claim our feminism --
560.225	good, bad, or anywhere in between.
563.329	The last line of my book
563.329	"""Bad Feminist"" says,"
565.805	"""I would rather be a bad feminist"
565.805	"than no feminist at all."""
570.24	This is true for so many reasons,
572.304	but first and foremost, I say this
572.304	because once upon a time,
575.888	my voice was stolen from me,
577.741	and feminism helped me
577.741	to get my voice back.
581.455	There was an incident.
582.915	I call it an incident so I can carry
582.915	the burden of what happened.
586.724	Some boys broke me,
588.136	when I was so young, I did not know
589.95	what boys can do to break a girl.
592.4	They treated me like I was nothing.
594.566	I began to believe I was nothing.
597.064	They stole my voice, and in the after,
599.127	I did not dare to believe
600.508	that anything I might say could matter.
602.948	But --
603.981	I had writing.
605.377	And there, I wrote myself back together.
608.242	I wrote myself toward a stronger
608.242	version of myself.
611.653	I read the words of women
613.028	who might understand a story like mine,
615.384	and women who looked like me,
617.179	and understood what it was like to move
617.179	through the world with brown skin.
621.303	I read the words of women
621.303	who showed me I was not nothing.
625.602	I learned to write like them,
627.308	and then I learned to write as myself.
629.856	I found my voice again,
631.024	and I started to believe that my voice
631.024	is powerful beyond measure.
636.048	Through writing and feminism,
637.61	I also found that if I was
637.61	a little bit brave,
640.388	another woman might hear me
640.388	and see me and recognize
644.013	that none of us are the nothing
644.013	the world tries to tell us we are.
648.16	In one hand,
649.692	I hold the power to accomplish anything.
652.74	And in my other,
653.765	I hold the humbling reality
653.765	that I am just one woman.
657.918	I am a bad feminist,
659.621	I am a good woman,
661.287	I am trying to become better
661.287	in how I think,
663.686	and what I say, and what I do,
665.97	without abandoning everything
665.97	that makes me human.
669.152	I hope that we can all do the same.
671.7	I hope that we can all be
671.7	a little bit brave,
673.967	when we most need such bravery.
676.856	(Applause)
