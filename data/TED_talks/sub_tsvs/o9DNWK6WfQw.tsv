13.759	I worked as a war reporter for 15 years
17.136	before I realized
17.136	that I really had a problem.
21.101	There was something really wrong with me.
23.231	This was about a year before 9/11,
23.231	and America wasn't at war yet.
27.432	We weren't talking about PTSD.
29.848	We were not yet talking
29.848	about the effect of trauma and war
34.068	on the human psyche.
36.706	I'd been in Afghanistan
36.706	for a couple of months
38.98	with the Northern Alliance
38.98	as they were fighting the Taliban.
42.012	And at that point the Taliban
42.012	had an air force,
45.293	they had fighter planes,
45.293	they had tanks, they had artillery,
48.546	and we really got hammered
48.546	pretty badly a couple of times.
51.861	We saw some very ugly things.
55.104	But I didn't really think it affected me.
57.098	I didn't think much about it.
58.65	I came home to New York, where I live.
61.141	Then one day I went down into the subway,
64.49	and for the first time in my life,
66.965	I knew real fear.
68.823	I had a massive panic attack.
72.058	I was way more scared
72.058	than I had ever been in Afghanistan.
76.093	Everything I was looking at seemed like
76.093	it was going to kill me,
79.517	but I couldn't explain why.
82.121	The trains were going too fast.
84.119	There were too many people.
85.497	The lights were too bright.
87.309	Everything was too loud,
87.309	everything was moving too quickly.
90.132	I backed up against a support column
90.132	and just waited for it.
95.115	When I couldn't take it any longer,
95.115	I ran out of the subway station
98.335	and walked wherever I was going.
101.648	Later, I found out that what I had
101.648	was short-term PTSD:
105.851	post-traumatic stress disorder.
108.993	We evolved as animals, as primates,
108.993	to survive periods of danger,
112.245	and if your life has been in danger,
115.19	you want to react to unfamiliar noises.
119.352	You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.
121.631	You want to have nightmares and flashbacks
123.849	of the thing that could kill you.
126.756	You want to be angry because it makes you
126.756	predisposed to fight,
129.837	or depressed, because it keeps you out
129.837	of circulation a little bit.
133.591	Keeps you safe.
135.58	It's not very pleasant,
135.58	but it's better than getting eaten.
140.469	Most people recover
140.469	from that pretty quickly.
142.947	It takes a few weeks, a few months.
145.061	I kept having panic attacks,
145.061	but they eventually went away.
148.2	I had no idea it was connected
148.2	to the war that I'd seen.
150.874	I just thought I was going crazy,
152.494	and then I thought, well,
152.494	now I'm not going crazy anymore.
157.197	About 20 percent of people, however,
159.851	wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.
163.166	They are not adapted to temporary danger.
165.584	They are maladapted for everyday life,
168.369	unless they get help.
169.994	We know that the people
169.994	who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD
173.557	are people who were abused as children,
176.297	who suffered trauma as children,
178.052	people who have low education levels,
180.694	people who have psychiatric
180.694	disorders in their family.
183.276	If you served in Vietnam
184.578	and your brother is schizophrenic,
187.296	you're way more likely to get
187.296	long-term PTSD from Vietnam.
192.571	So I started to study this
192.571	as a journalist,
195.868	and I realized that there was something
195.868	really strange going on.
199.415	The numbers seemed to be going
199.415	in the wrong direction.
202.597	Every war that we have
202.597	fought as a country,
204.993	starting with the Civil War,
206.991	the intensity of the combat has gone down.
210.878	As a result, the casualty rates
210.878	have gone down.
214.707	But disability rates have gone up.
216.686	They should be going
216.686	in the same direction,
219.702	but they're going in different directions.
224.124	The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
224.124	have produced, thank God,
228.737	a casualty rate about one third
228.737	of what it was in Vietnam.
236.129	But they've also created --
238.678	they've also produced
238.678	three times the disability rates.
243.526	Around 10 percent of the US military
243.526	is actively engaged in combat,
251.801	They're shooting at people,
251.801	killing people,
254.099	getting shot at,
254.099	seeing their friends get killed.
256.461	It's incredibly traumatic.
258.038	But it's only about 10 percent
258.038	of our military.
260.872	But about half of our military has filed
263.129	for some kind of PTSD compensation
263.129	from the government.
268.922	And suicide doesn't even fit into this
268.922	in a very logical way.
274.173	We've all heard the tragic statistic
274.173	of 22 vets a day, on average,
279.983	in this country, killing themselves.
283.564	Most people don't realize
285.078	that the majority of those suicides
285.078	are veterans of the Vietnam War,
290.739	that generation,
292.641	and their decision to take their own lives
292.641	actually might not be related
297.163	to the war they fought 50 years earlier.
301.122	In fact, there's no statistical connection
301.122	between combat and suicide.
304.838	If you're in the military
304.838	and you're in a lot of combat,
307.929	you're no more likely to kill yourself
307.929	than if you weren't.
311.614	In fact, one study found
312.964	that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,
315.012	you're actually slightly less likely
315.012	to commit suicide later.
320.626	I studied anthropology in college.
322.92	I did my fieldwork
322.92	on the Navajo reservation.
325.963	I wrote a thesis on Navajo
325.963	long-distance runners.
330.473	And recently, while
330.473	I was researching PTSD,
335.501	I had this thought.
338.325	I thought back to the work
338.325	I did when I was young,
341.428	and I thought, I bet the Navajo,
341.428	the Apache, the Comanche --
345.521	I mean, these are very warlike nations --
348.109	I bet they weren't getting
348.109	PTSD like we do.
352.814	When their warriors came back
352.814	from fighting the US military
355.83	or fighting each other,
358.241	I bet they pretty much just slipped
358.241	right back into tribal life.
363.635	And maybe what determines
365.913	the rate of long-term PTSD
368.631	isn't what happened out there,
371.942	but the kind of society you come back to.
375.107	And maybe if you come back
375.107	to a close, cohesive, tribal society,
380.823	you can get over trauma pretty quickly.
383.83	And if you come back
383.83	to an alienating, modern society,
388.719	you might remain traumatized
388.719	your entire life.
392.248	In other words, maybe the problem
392.248	isn't them, the vets;
395.383	maybe the problem is us.
399.325	Certainly, modern society
399.325	is hard on the human psyche
404.649	by every metric that we have.
409.043	As wealth goes up in a society,
413.523	the suicide rate goes up instead of down.
418.066	If you live in modern society,
420.18	you're up to eight times more likely
424.379	to suffer from depression in your lifetime
426.724	than if you live in a poor,
426.724	agrarian society.
430.915	Modern society has probably produced
430.915	the highest rates of suicide
434.538	and depression and anxiety
434.538	and loneliness and child abuse
437.816	ever in human history.
440.695	I saw one study
442.292	that compared women in Nigeria,
445.358	one of the most chaotic
445.358	and violent and corrupt
448.627	and poorest countries in Africa,
451.358	to women in North America.
452.673	And the highest rates of depression
452.673	were urban women in North America.
457.887	That was also the wealthiest group.
460.637	So let's go back to the US military.
465.096	Ten percent are in combat.
467.638	Around 50 percent have filed
467.638	for PTSD compensation.
473.602	So about 40 percent of veterans
473.602	really were not traumatized overseas
479.734	but have come home to discover
479.734	they are dangerously alienated
484.563	and depressed.
488.341	So what is happening with them?
491.302	What's going on with those people,
494.051	the phantom 40 percent that are troubled
494.051	but don't understand why?
498.81	Maybe it's this:
500.158	maybe they had an experience
500.158	of sort of tribal closeness
504.826	in their unit when they were overseas.
508.075	They were eating together,
508.075	sleeping together,
510.732	doing tasks and missions together.
513.055	They were trusting each other
513.055	with their lives.
517.16	And then they come home
518.857	and they have to give all that up
521.851	and they're coming back
521.851	to a society, a modern society,
525.614	which is hard on people
525.614	who weren't even in the military.
529.171	It's just hard on everybody.
531.494	And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.
536.685	But for a lot of these people,
539.34	maybe it's not trauma.
540.561	I mean, certainly,
540.561	soldiers are traumatized
543.14	and the ones who are
543.14	have to be treated for that.
545.533	But a lot of them --
546.751	maybe what's bothering them
546.751	is actually a kind of alienation.
550.321	I mean, maybe we just have
550.321	the wrong word for some of it,
553.115	and just changing our language,
553.115	our understanding,
555.528	would help a little bit.
556.726	"""Post-deployment alienation disorder."""
559.462	Maybe even just calling it that
559.462	for some of these people
563.634	would allow them to stop imagining
566.236	trying to imagine a trauma
566.236	that didn't really happen
569.707	in order to explain a feeling
569.707	that really is happening.
572.502	And in fact, it's an extremely
572.502	dangerous feeling.
575.043	That alienation and depression
575.043	can lead to suicide.
577.807	These people are in danger.
579.828	It's very important to understand why.
583.167	The Israeli military has a PTSD rate
583.167	of around one percent.
587.65	The theory is that everyone in Israel
587.65	is supposed to serve in the military.
593.273	When soldiers come back
593.273	from the front line,
595.407	they're not going from a military
595.407	environment to a civilian environment.
600.741	They're coming back to a community
600.741	where everyone understands
605.698	about the military.
606.877	Everyone's been in it
606.877	or is going to be in it.
609.056	Everyone understands
609.056	the situation they're all in.
611.436	It's as if they're all in one big tribe.
614.282	We know that if you take a lab rat
616.34	and traumatize it and put it
616.34	in a cage by itself,
620.036	you can maintain its trauma symptoms
620.036	almost indefinitely.
623.717	And if you take that same lab rat
623.717	and put it in a cage with other rats,
630.018	after a couple of weeks,
630.018	it's pretty much OK.
635.509	After 9/11,
638.549	the murder rate in New York City
638.549	went down by 40 percent.
641.866	The suicide rate went down.
644.756	The violent crime rate in New York
644.756	went down after 9/11.
649.284	Even combat veterans of previous wars
649.284	who suffered from PTSD
654.627	said that their symptoms went down
654.627	after 9/11 happened.
659.148	The reason is that if you traumatize
659.148	an entire society,
664.45	we don't fall apart
664.45	and turn on one another.
667.693	We come together. We unify.
669.831	Basically, we tribalize,
671.902	and that process of unifying
671.902	feels so good and is so good for us,
677.479	that it even helps people
678.92	who are struggling
678.92	with mental health issues.
682.238	During the blitz in London,
684.027	admissions to psychiatric wards
684.027	went down during the bombings.
690.606	For a while, that was the kind of country
693.852	that American soldiers came
693.852	back to -- a unified country.
698.288	We were sticking together.
699.583	We were trying to understand
699.583	the threat against us.
702.218	We were trying to help
702.218	ourselves and the world.
707.521	But that's changed.
710.392	Now, American soldiers,
712.762	American veterans are coming back
712.762	to a country that is so bitterly divided
717.716	that the two political parties
717.716	are literally accusing each other
722.67	of treason, of being
722.67	an enemy of the state,
726.265	of trying to undermine the security
726.265	and the welfare of their own country.
731.049	The gap between rich and poor
731.049	is the biggest it's ever been.
735.206	It's just getting worse.
736.415	Race relations are terrible.
738.847	There are demonstrations
738.847	and even riots in the streets
741.727	because of racial injustice.
744.727	And veterans know that any tribe
744.727	that treated itself that way -- in fact,
749.012	any platoon that treated itself
749.012	that way -- would never survive.
755.068	We've gotten used to it.
756.983	Veterans have gone away
756.983	and are coming back
760.86	and seeing their own country
760.86	with fresh eyes.
765.325	And they see what's going on.
767.738	This is the country they fought for.
770.433	No wonder they're depressed.
772.135	No wonder they're scared.
775.371	Sometimes, we ask ourselves
775.371	if we can save the vets.
780.248	I think the real question
780.248	is if we can save ourselves.
783.905	If we can,
785.619	I think the vets are going to be fine.
788.697	It's time for this country to unite,
793.818	if only to help the men and women
793.818	who fought to protect us.
799.182	Thank you very much.
800.437	(Applause)
