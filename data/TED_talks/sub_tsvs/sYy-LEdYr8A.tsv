12.817	About 12 years ago,
14.993	I gave up my career in banking
17.245	to try to make the world a safer place.
20.356	This involved a journey into
20.356	national and global advocacy
24.565	and meeting some of the most
24.565	extraordinary people in the world.
29.388	In the process, I became
29.388	a civil society diplomat.
34.566	Civil society diplomats do three things:
38.072	They voice the concerns of the people,
40.603	are not pinned down by national interests,
43.691	and influence change
43.691	through citizen networks,
46.528	not only state ones.
49.084	And if you want to change the world,
49.084	we need more of them.
53.683	But many people still ask,
56.19	"""Can civil society really"
56.19	make a big difference?
60.741	Can citizens influence and shape
60.741	"national and global policy?"""
66.012	I never thought I would ask
66.012	myself these questions,
68.961	but here I am to share some lessons
72.211	about two powerful civil society 
72.211	movements that I've been involved in.
77.227	They are in issues
77.227	that I'm passionate about:
81.035	gun control and drug policy.
85.214	And these are issues that matter here.
88.859	Latin America is ground zero
88.859	for both of them.
94.253	For example, Brazil --
96.296	this beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal
96.296	has the world's ugliest record.
102.55	We are the number one champion
102.55	in homicidal violence.
108.448	One in every 10 people killed
108.448	around the world is a Brazilian.
114.569	This translates into over 56,000 people
119.678	dying violently each year.
123.161	Most of them are young, black boys
123.161	dying by guns.
129.082	Brazil is also one of the world's
129.082	largest consumers of drugs,
134.213	and the War on Drugs
134.213	has been especially painful here.
139.066	Around 50 percent of the homicides
139.066	in the streets in Brazil
142.339	are related to the War on Drugs.
145.776	The same is true for about
151.464	And it's not just Brazil that is affected
151.464	by the twin problems of guns and drugs.
156.596	Virtually every country and city across
156.596	Central and South America is in trouble.
163.62	Latin America has nine percent
163.62	of the world's population,
167.869	but 25 percent
167.869	of its global violent deaths.
172.93	These are not problems
172.93	we can run away from.
175.972	I certainly could not.
178.271	So the first campaign I got involved with
178.271	started here in 2003
183.147	to change Brazil's gun law
185.19	and to create a program
185.19	to buy back weapons.
188.278	In just a few years,
189.857	we not only changed national legislation
192.295	that made it much more difficult
192.295	for civilians to buy a gun,
196.033	but we collected and destroyed
196.033	almost half a million weapons.
201.683	This was one of the biggest
201.683	buyback programs in history --
206.262	(Applause) --
208.921	but we also suffered some setbacks.
212.542	We lost a referendum to ban
212.542	gun sales to civilians in 2005.
218.324	The second initiative was also home-grown,
221.597	but is today a global movement to reform
221.597	the international drug control regime.
227.147	I am the executive coordinator
228.938	of something called
228.938	the Global Commission on Drug Policy.
233.416	The commission is a high-level group
235.854	of global leaders brought together
235.854	to identify more humane
239.755	and effective approaches
239.755	to the issue of drugs.
243.911	Since we started in 2008,
243.911	the taboo on drugs is broken.
248.479	Across the Americas, from the US
248.479	and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,
253.431	change is in the air.
255.579	But rather than tell you the whole story
255.579	about these two movements,
259.381	I just want to share with you
259.381	four key insights.
263.189	I call them lessons to change the world.
266.788	There are certainly many more,
269.017	but these are the ones
269.017	that stand out to me.
272.314	So the first lesson is:
274.496	Change and control the narrative.
277.77	It may seem obvious,
279.604	but a key ingredient
279.604	to civil society diplomacy
282.646	is first changing and then
282.646	controlling the narrative.
286.733	This is something that veteran
286.733	politicians understand,
289.89	but that civil society groups
289.89	generally do not do very well.
294.813	In the case of drug policy,
297.158	our biggest success has been
297.158	to change the discussion
300.618	away from prosecuting a War on Drugs
303.427	to putting people's health
303.427	and safety first.
307.398	In a cutting-edge report
307.398	we just launched in New York,
310.834	we also showed that the groups benefiting
310.834	most from this $320 billion market
318.403	are criminal gangs and cartels.
321.724	So in order to undermine
321.724	the power and profit of these groups,
325.462	we need to change the conversation.
328.434	We need to make illegal drugs legal.
334.726	But before I get you too excited,
337.559	I don't mean drugs
337.559	should be a free-for-all.
340.702	What I'm talking about, and what
340.702	the Global Commission advocates for
344.827	is creating a highly regulated market,
349.354	where different drugs would have
349.354	different degrees of regulation.
354.579	As for gun control,
354.579	we were successful in changing,
358.619	but not so much
358.619	in controlling, the narrative.
361.544	And this brings me to my next lesson:
364.4	Never underestimate your opponents.
368.324	If you want to succeed
368.324	in changing the world,
370.553	you need to know who you're up against.
372.922	You need to learn their motivations
372.922	and points of view.
376.59	In the case of gun control,
378.796	we really underestimated our opponents.
382.349	After a very successful
382.349	gun-collection program,
385.274	we were elated.
386.618	We had support from
389.454	and thought that this could help us
389.454	win the referendum
392.335	to ban gun sales to civilians.
394.747	But we were dead wrong.
397.928	During a televised 20-day public debate,
401.249	our opponent used
401.249	our own arguments against us.
405.103	We ended up losing the popular vote.
407.332	It was really terrible.
409.677	The National Rifle Association --
409.677	yes, the American NRA --
415.836	came to Brazil.
417.595	They inundated our campaign
417.595	with their propaganda,
420.695	that as you know,
422.238	links the right to own guns
422.238	to ideas of freedom and democracy.
426.581	They simply threw everything at us.
430.458	They used our national flag,
432.385	our independence anthem.
434.08	They invoked women's rights
435.915	and misused images of Mandela,
435.915	Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.
441.302	They won by playing with people's fears.
445.272	In fact, guns were almost completely
445.272	ignored in their campaign.
449.916	Their focus was on individual rights.
453.213	But I ask you,
454.792	which right is more important,
457.021	the right to life
458.832	or the right to have a gun
458.832	that takes life away?
461.897	(Applause)
466.15	We thought people would vote
466.15	in defense of life,
469.972	but in a country with a recent past
469.972	of military dictatorship,
474.756	the anti-government message
474.756	of our opponents resonated,
479.027	and we were not prepared to respond.
482.626	Lesson learned.
484.715	We've been more successful
484.715	in the case of drug policy.
488.005	If you asked most people 10 years ago if
488.005	an end to the War on Drugs was possible,
492.719	they would have laughed.
494.731	After all, there are huge
494.731	military police prisons
498.229	and financial establishments
498.229	benefiting from this war.
502.325	But today, the international drug
502.325	control regime is starting to crumble.
508.097	Governments and civil societies
508.097	are experimenting with new approaches.
512.926	The Global Commission on Drug Policy
515.248	really knew its opposition,
517.315	and rather than fighting them,
519.149	our chair -- former Brazilian President
519.149	Fernando Henrique Cardoso --
523.793	reached out to leaders
523.793	from across the political spectrum,
528.065	from liberals to conservatives.
530.875	This high level group
530.875	agreed to honestly discuss
535.751	the merits and flaws of drug policies.
537.701	It was this reasoned, informed
537.701	and strategic discussion
542.461	that revealed the sad truth
542.461	about the War on Drugs.
546.222	The War on Drugs has simply failed
546.222	across every metric.
552.538	Drugs are cheaper
552.538	and more available than ever,
555.44	and consumption has risen globally.
558.227	But even worse,
560.409	it also generated massive
560.409	negative unintended consequences.
566.98	It is true that some people
566.98	have made these arguments before,
570.626	but we've made a difference
572.366	by anticipating the arguments
572.366	of our opponents
575.378	and by leveraging powerful voices
577.484	that a few years ago
577.484	would probably have resisted change.
582.374	Third lesson: Use data
582.374	to drive your argument.
586.461	Guns and drugs are emotive issues,
589.456	and as we've painfully learned
589.456	in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,
593.357	sometimes it's impossible
593.357	to cut through the emotions
596.422	and get to the facts.
598.512	But this doesn't mean
598.512	that we shouldn't try.
601.6	Until quite recently,
603.251	we simply didn't know
603.251	how many Brazilians were killed by guns.
607.265	Amazingly, it was a local soap opera
607.265	"called ""Mulheres Apaixonadas"" --"
612.78	"or ""Women in Love"" --"
614.498	that kicked off Brazil's
614.498	national gun control campaign.
618.41	In one highly viewed episode,
620.872	a soap opera lead actress
620.872	was killed by a stray bullet.
625.074	Brazilian grannies
625.074	and housewives were outraged,
629.37	and in a case of art imitating life,
632.644	this episode also included footage
632.644	of a real gun control march
637.938	that we had organized right here,
640.422	outside in Copacabana Beach.
643.255	The televised death and march
643.255	had a huge impact on public opinion.
648.699	Within weeks, our national congress
648.699	approved the disarmament bill
653.483	that had been languishing for years.
656.571	We were then able to mobilize data
659.586	to show the successful outcomes
659.586	of the change in the law
662.886	and gun collection program.
665.007	Here is what I mean:
666.769	We could prove that in just one year,
670.293	we saved more than 5,000 lives.
675.099	(Applause)
678.862	And in the case of drugs,
681.276	in order to undermine this fear
681.276	and prejudice that surrounds the issue,
686.57	we managed to gather and present data
686.57	that shows that today's drug policies
691.678	cause much more harm than drug use per se,
695.549	and people are starting to get it.
699.682	My fourth insight is:
701.818	Don't be afraid to bring
701.818	together odd bedfellows.
706.044	What we've learned in Brazil --
708.018	and this doesn't only
708.018	apply to my country --
710.363	is the importance of bringing diverse
710.363	and eclectic folks together.
714.995	If you want to change the world,
717.131	it helps to have a good cross-section
717.131	of society on your side.
721.427	In both the case of guns and drugs,
724.027	we brought together
724.027	a wonderful mix of people.
727.463	We mobilized the elite
727.463	and got huge support from the media.
731.667	We gathered the victims,
731.667	human rights champions, cultural icons.
736.124	We also assembled
736.124	the professional classes --
738.701	doctors, lawyers, academia and more.
741.697	What I've learned over the last years
744.437	is that you need coalitions of the willing
744.437	and of the unwilling to make change.
750.337	In the case of drugs,
752.204	we needed libertarians,
752.204	anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,
755.791	and liberal politicians.
758.136	They may not agree on everything;
760.597	in fact, they disagree
760.597	on almost everything.
764.846	But the legitimacy of the campaign
764.846	is based on their diverse points of view.
771.521	Over a decade ago,
773.762	I had a comfortable future
773.762	working for an investment bank.
778.22	I was as far removed from the world
778.22	of civil society diplomacy
782.492	as you can imagine.
784.768	But I took a chance.
786.927	I changed course,
788.924	and on the way, I helped 
788.924	to create social movements
792.284	that I believe have made 
792.284	some parts of the world safer.
797.004	Each and every one of us
797.004	has the power to change the world.
802.178	No matter what the issue,
802.178	and no matter how hard the fight,
806.79	civil society is central
806.79	to the blueprint for change.
811.504	Thank you.
813.815	(Applause)
