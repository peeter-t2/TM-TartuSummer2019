12.896	So I'm a neurosurgeon.
15.746	And like most of my colleagues,
17.673	I have to deal, every day,
17.673	with human tragedies.
22.549	I realize how your life can change
22.549	from one second to the other
27.378	after a major stroke
27.378	or after a car accident.
32.045	And what is very frustrating
32.045	for us neurosurgeons
35.807	is to realize that unlike
35.807	other organs of the body,
40.451	the brain has very little
40.451	ability for self-repair.
45.211	And after a major injury
45.211	of your central nervous system,
50.365	the patients often remain
50.365	with a severe handicap.
55.203	And that's probably
55.203	the reason why I've chosen
57.44	to be a functional neurosurgeon.
61.144	What is a functional neurosurgeon?
63.978	It's a doctor who is trying to improve
63.978	a neurological function
68.362	through different surgical strategies.
72.066	You've certainly heard of
72.066	one of the famous ones
74.4	called deep brain stimulation,
77.23	where you implant an electrode
77.23	in the depths of the brain
81.386	in order to modulate a circuit of neurons
84.986	to improve a neurological function.
87.33	It's really an amazing technology
89.42	in that it has improved
89.42	the destiny of patients
92.811	with Parkinson's disease,
94.657	with severe tremor, with severe pain.
98.87	However, neuromodulation
98.87	does not mean neuro-repair.
105.301	And the dream of functional neurosurgeons
107.632	is to repair the brain.
111.222	I think
112.643	that we are approaching this dream.
114.502	And I would like to show you
117.161	that we are very close to this.
120.022	And that with a little bit of help,
123.157	the brain is able to help itself.
128.516	So the story started 15 years ago.
131.156	At that time, I was a chief resident
133.2	working days and nights
133.2	in the emergency room.
136.619	I often had to take care
136.619	of patients with head trauma.
141.193	You have to imagine that when a patient
141.193	comes in with a severe head trauma,
145.678	his brain is swelling
148.001	and he's increasing
148.001	his intracranial pressure.
151.716	And in order to save his life,
153.969	you have to decrease
153.969	this intracranial pressure.
156.801	And to do that,
157.976	you sometimes have to remove
157.976	a piece of swollen brain.
162.587	So instead of throwing away
162.587	these pieces of swollen brain,
166.959	we decided with Jean-François Brunet,
169.472	who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,
171.409	to study them.
173.379	What do I mean by that?
175.174	We wanted to grow cells
175.174	from these pieces of tissue.
180.484	It's not an easy task.
182.577	Growing cells from a piece of tissue
184.966	is a bit the same as growing
184.966	very small children
188.449	out from their family.
191.689	So you need to find the right nutrients,
194.03	the warmth, the humidity
195.823	and all the nice environments
195.823	to make them thrive.
199.083	So that's exactly what we had
199.083	to do with these cells.
202.425	And after many attempts,
204.959	Jean-François did it.
207.372	And that's what he saw
207.372	under his microscope.
211.691	And that was, for us, a major surprise.
214.412	Why?
215.587	Because this looks exactly the same
215.587	as a stem cell culture,
220.453	with large green cells
220.453	surrounding small, immature cells.
227.168	And you may remember from biology class
230.446	that stem cells are immature cells,
233.981	able to turn into any type
233.981	of cell of the body.
239.423	The adult brain has stem cells,
239.423	but they're very rare
244.075	and they're located
244.075	in deep and small niches
248.478	in the depths of the brain.
250.519	So it was surprising to get
250.519	this kind of stem cell culture
254.245	from the superficial part
254.245	of swollen brain we had
256.628	in the operating theater.
258.269	And there was another
258.269	intriguing observation:
261.89	Regular stem cells
261.89	are very active cells --
266.14	cells that divide, divide,
266.14	divide very quickly.
270.409	And they never die,
270.409	they're immortal cells.
273.407	But these cells behave differently.
276.663	They divide slowly,
278.87	and after a few weeks of culture,
280.894	they even died.
283.321	So we were in front of a strange
283.321	new cell population
286.997	that looked like stem cells
286.997	but behaved differently.
291.052	And it took us a long time
291.052	to understand where they came from.
295.52	They come from these cells.
298.55	These blue and red cells are called
298.55	doublecortin-positive cells.
304.195	All of you have them in your brain.
307.353	They represent four percent
307.353	of your cortical brain cells.
311.857	They have a very important role
311.857	during the development stage.
315.953	When you were fetuses,
318.457	they helped your brain to fold itself.
322.12	But why do they stay in your head?
325.371	This, we don't know.
327.414	We think that they may
327.414	participate in brain repair
330.66	because we find them
330.66	in higher concentration
334.148	close to brain lesions.
335.324	But it's not so sure.
337.867	But there is one clear thing --
340.236	that from these cells,
341.857	we got our stem cell culture.
345.363	And we were in front
345.363	of a potential new source of cells
348.021	to repair the brain.
350.004	And we had to prove this.
351.585	So to prove it,
352.76	we decided to design
352.76	an experimental paradigm.
356.632	The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain
359.879	in a non-eloquent area of the brain,
362.602	and then to culture the cells
364.337	exactly the way Jean-François
364.337	did it in his lab.
367.148	And then label them, to put color in them
370.067	in order to be able
370.067	to track them in the brain.
373.295	And the last step was to re-implant them
375.448	in the same individual.
377.255	We call these
378.43	autologous grafts -- autografts.
381.602	So the first question we had,
384.069	"""What will happen if we re-implant"
384.069	these cells in a normal brain,
389.334	and what will happen
389.334	if we re-implant the same cells
392.216	"in a lesioned brain?"""
393.463	Thanks to the help
393.463	of professor Eric Rouiller,
396.876	we worked with monkeys.
399.414	So in the first-case scenario,
401.878	we re-implanted the cells
401.878	in the normal brain
405.407	and what we saw is that they completely
405.407	disappeared after a few weeks,
410.466	as if they were taken from the brain,
413.444	they go back home,
414.979	the space is already busy,
416.559	they are not needed there,
416.559	so they disappear.
419.78	In the second-case scenario,
421.782	we performed the lesion,
423.037	we re-implanted exactly the same cells,
426.201	and in this case, the cells remained --
430.298	and they became mature neurons.
433.824	And that's the image of what
433.824	we could observe under the microscope.
437.635	Those are the cells
437.635	that were re-implanted.
440.839	And the proof they carry,
442.81	these little spots, those
442.81	are the cells that we've labeled
446.011	in vitro, when they were in culture.
449.755	But we could not stop here, of course.
452.521	Do these cells also help a monkey
452.521	to recover after a lesion?
457.182	So for that, we trained monkeys
457.182	to perform a manual dexterity task.
462.688	They had to retrieve
462.688	food pellets from a tray.
465.73	They were very good at it.
467.896	And when they had reached
467.896	a plateau of performance,
471.392	we did a lesion in the motor cortex
471.392	corresponding to the hand motion.
477.711	So the monkeys were plegic,
479.592	they could not move their hand anymore.
482.165	And exactly the same as humans would do,
485.743	they spontaneously recovered
485.743	to a certain extent,
488.693	exactly the same as after a stroke.
490.737	Patients are completely plegic,
492.548	and then they try to recover
492.548	due to a brain plasticity mechanism,
497.68	they recover to a certain extent,
499.344	exactly the same for the monkey.
501.209	So when we were sure that the monkey
501.209	had reached his plateau
504.677	of spontaneous recovery,
507.129	we implanted his own cells.
510.287	So on the left side, you see the monkey
510.287	that has spontaneously recovered.
517.426	He's at about 40 to 50 percent
517.426	of his previous performance
522.082	before the lesion.
524.079	He's not so accurate, not so quick.
527.376	And look now when we re-implant the cells:
530.859	Two months after re-implantation,
530.859	the same individual.
537.255	(Applause)
544.77	It was also very exciting results
544.77	for us, I tell you.
549.321	Since that time, we've understood
549.321	much more about these cells.
553.575	We know that we can cryopreserve them,
555.995	we can use them later on.
558.214	We know that we can apply them
558.214	in other neuropathological models,
562.128	like Parkinson's disease, for example.
564.121	But our dream is still
564.121	to implant them in humans.
568.469	And I really hope that I'll be able
568.469	to show you soon
573.605	that the human brain is giving us
573.605	the tools to repair itself.
578.623	Thank you.
579.967	(Applause)
585.977	Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,
589.303	and I'm sure that right now, there are
589.303	several dozen people in the audience,
593.078	possibly even a majority,
594.308	"who are thinking, ""I know"
594.308	"somebody who can use this."""
597.08	I do, in any case.
599.364	And of course the question is,
601.684	what are the biggest obstacles
603.786	before you can go
603.786	into human clinical trials?
607.665	Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest
607.665	obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)
613.195	So, from these exciting results,
613.195	you need to fill out
615.981	about two kilograms of papers and forms
619.242	to be able to go through these
619.242	kind of trials.
622.314	BG: Which is understandable,
622.314	the brain is delicate, etc.
624.97	JB: Yes, it is, but it takes a long time
627.352	and a lot of patience and almost
627.352	a professional team to do it, you know?
631.407	BG: If you project yourself --
633.697	having done the research
634.936	and having tried to get
634.936	permission to start the trials,
638.905	if you project yourself out in time,
642.736	how many years before
642.736	somebody gets into a hospital
646.458	and this therapy is available?
649.555	JB: So, it's very difficult to say.
651.714	It depends, first,
651.714	on the approval of the trial.
655.672	Will the regulation allow us
655.672	to do it soon?
658.799	And then, you have to perform
658.799	this kind of study
661.637	in a small group of patients.
664.461	So it takes, already, a long time
664.461	to select the patients,
667.41	do the treatment
669.34	and evaluate if it's useful
669.34	to do this kind of treatment.
673.093	And then you have to deploy
673.093	this to a multicentric trial.
677.776	You have to really prove
677.776	first that it's useful
681.962	before offering this treatment
681.962	up for everybody.
684.867	BG: And safe, of course. JB: Of course.
686.78	BG: Jocelyne, thank you for coming
686.78	to TED and sharing this.
689.598	BG: Thank you.
690.773	(Applause)
