12.507	Today I want to talk to you
12.507	about the mathematics of love.
17.2	Now, I think that we can all agree
18.853	that mathematicians
18.853	are famously excellent at finding love.
22.479	(Laughter)
23.906	But it's not just because
23.906	of our dashing personalities,
26.897	superior conversational skills
26.897	and excellent pencil cases.
32.083	It's also because we've actually done
32.083	an awful lot of work into the maths
35.85	of how to find the perfect partner.
38.35	Now, in my favorite paper
38.35	on the subject, which is entitled,
42.053	"""Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend"" --"
43.94	(Laughter)
45.371	Peter Backus tries to rate
45.371	his chances of finding love.
49.013	Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.
51.266	Of all of the available women in the UK,
53.542	all Peter's looking for
53.542	is somebody who lives near him,
57.061	somebody in the right age range,
58.891	somebody with a university degree,
61.837	somebody he's likely to get on well with,
63.843	somebody who's likely to be attractive,
65.81	somebody who's likely
65.81	to find him attractive.
68.14	(Laughter)
71.218	And comes up with an estimate
71.218	of 26 women in the whole of the UK.
76.032	(Laughter)
77.235	It's not looking very good, is it Peter?
79.292	Now, just to put that into perspective,
81.27	that's about 400 times fewer
81.27	than the best estimates
84.574	of how many intelligent
84.574	extraterrestrial life forms there are.
88.299	And it also gives Peter
88.299	a 1 in 285,000 chance
93.617	of bumping into any one
93.617	of these special ladies
95.902	on a given night out.
97.465	I'd like to think
97.465	that's why mathematicians
99.491	don't really bother
99.491	going on nights out anymore.
103.109	The thing is that I personally
103.109	don't subscribe
105.389	to such a pessimistic view.
107.069	Because I know,
107.069	just as well as all of you do,
109.682	that love doesn't really work like that.
112.078	Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
112.078	and rational and easily predictable.
117.396	But I also know that that doesn't mean
119.641	that mathematics hasn't got something
119.641	that it can offer us,
122.945	because, love, as with most of life,
122.945	is full of patterns
126.715	and mathematics is, ultimately,
126.715	all about the study of patterns.
131.165	Patterns from predicting the weather
131.165	to the fluctuations in the stock market,
135.533	to the movement of the planets
135.533	or the growth of cities.
138.588	And if we're being honest,
138.588	none of those things
140.902	are exactly neatly ordered
140.902	and easily predictable, either.
144.966	Because I believe that mathematics
144.966	is so powerful that it has the potential
150.168	to offer us a new way of looking
150.168	at almost anything.
153.513	Even something as mysterious as love.
156.979	And so, to try to persuade you
158.675	of how totally amazing, excellent
158.675	and relevant mathematics is,
163.392	I want to give you my top three
163.392	mathematically verifiable tips for love.
170.651	(Laughter)
172.44	OK, so Top Tip #1:
174.104	How to win at online dating.
178.567	So my favorite online dating
178.567	website is OkCupid,
181.962	not least because it was started
181.962	by a group of mathematicians.
185.574	Now, because they're mathematicians,
187.343	they have been collecting data
188.844	on everybody who uses their site
188.844	for almost a decade.
192.364	And they've been trying
192.364	to search for patterns
194.538	in the way that we talk about ourselves
196.425	and the way that we interact
196.425	with each other
198.508	on an online dating website.
199.876	And they've come up with some
199.876	seriously interesting findings.
202.825	But my particular favorite
204.447	is that it turns out
204.447	that on an online dating website,
207.827	how attractive you are
207.827	does not dictate how popular you are,
213.511	and actually, having people
213.511	think that you're ugly
217.391	can work to your advantage.
219.469	(Laughter)
220.643	Let me show you how this works.
222.337	In a thankfully voluntary
222.337	section of OkCupid,
226.74	you are allowed to rate
226.74	how attractive you think people are
229.565	on a scale between one and five.
231.874	Now, if we compare this score,
231.874	the average score,
234.879	to how many messages
234.879	a selection of people receive,
238.044	you can begin to get a sense
239.591	of how attractiveness links to popularity
239.591	on an online dating website.
244.023	This is the graph the OkCupid guys
244.023	have come up with.
247.389	And the important thing to notice
247.389	is that it's not totally true
250.407	that the more attractive you are,
250.407	the more messages you get.
253.256	But the question arises then
253.256	of what is it about people up here
257.535	who are so much more popular
257.535	than people down here,
261.422	even though they have the same
261.422	score of attractiveness?
264.542	And the reason why is that it's not just
264.542	straightforward looks that are important.
268.699	So let me try to illustrate
268.699	their findings with an example.
271.53	So if you take someone like
271.53	Portia de Rossi, for example,
275.472	everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
275.472	is a very beautiful woman.
279.976	Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
279.976	but she's not a supermodel, either.
283.718	If you compare Portia de Rossi
283.718	to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,
288.333	now, a lot of people,
288.333	myself included, I should say,
292.039	think that Sarah Jessica Parker
292.039	is seriously fabulous
296.32	and possibly one
296.32	of the most beautiful creatures
298.99	to have ever have walked
298.99	on the face of the Earth.
301.404	But some other people,
301.404	i.e., most of the Internet ...
306.193	(Laughter)
308.287	seem to think that she looks
308.287	a bit like a horse.
310.697	(Laughter)
313.51	Now, I think that if you ask people
313.51	how attractive they thought
317.627	Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,
319.559	and you ask them to give
319.559	them a score between one and five
322.491	I reckon that they'd average out
322.491	to have roughly the same score.
325.535	But the way that people would vote
325.535	would be very different.
328.323	So Portia's scores would
328.323	all be clustered around the four
331.049	because everybody agrees
331.049	that she's very beautiful,
333.504	whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
333.504	completely divides opinion.
336.242	There'd be a huge spread in her scores.
338.242	And actually it's this spread that counts.
340.615	It's this spread
340.615	that makes you more popular
342.865	on an online Internet dating website.
345.065	So what that means then
346.277	is that if some people
346.277	think that you're attractive,
348.906	you're actually better off
350.791	having some other people
350.791	think that you're a massive minger.
355.935	That's much better
355.935	than everybody just thinking
358.173	that you're the cute girl next door.
360.26	Now, I think this begins
360.26	to make a bit more sense
362.609	when you think in terms of the people
362.609	who are sending these messages.
365.903	So let's say that you think
365.903	somebody's attractive,
368.285	but you suspect that other people
368.285	won't necessarily be that interested.
372.274	That means there's
372.274	less competition for you
374.543	and it's an extra incentive
374.543	for you to get in touch.
377.349	Whereas compare that
377.349	to if you think somebody is attractive
380.158	but you suspect that everybody
380.158	is going to think they're attractive.
383.399	Well, why would you bother
383.399	humiliating yourself, let's be honest?
387.077	But here's where the really
387.077	interesting part comes.
389.494	Because when people choose the pictures
389.494	that they use on an online dating website,
393.698	they often try to minimize the things
395.898	that they think some people
395.898	will find unattractive.
399.16	The classic example is people
399.16	who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight
403.215	deliberately choosing
403.215	a very cropped photo,
405.681	(Laughter)
407.056	or bald men, for example,
408.84	deliberately choosing pictures
408.84	where they're wearing hats.
411.812	But actually this is the opposite
411.812	of what you should do
414.426	if you want to be successful.
415.84	You should really, instead,
417.198	play up to whatever it is
417.198	that makes you different,
420.38	even if you think that some people
420.38	will find it unattractive.
424.555	Because the people who fancy you
424.555	are just going to fancy you anyway,
427.79	and the unimportant losers who don't,
427.79	well, they only play up to your advantage.
432.37	OK, Top Tip #2:
432.37	How to pick the perfect partner.
434.947	So let's imagine then
434.947	that you're a roaring success
437.624	on the dating scene.
439.189	But the question arises
439.189	of how do you then convert that success
443.748	into longer-term happiness,
446.323	and in particular, how do you decide
446.323	when is the right time to settle down?
451.437	Now generally,
451.437	it's not advisable to just cash in
454.269	and marry the first person who comes along
454.269	and shows you any interest at all.
458.416	But, equally, you don't really
458.416	want to leave it too long
461.561	if you want to maximize your chance
461.561	of long-term happiness.
464.355	As my favorite author,
464.355	Jane Austen, puts it,
467.843	"""An unmarried woman of seven and twenty"
470.061	can never hope to feel
470.061	"or inspire affection again."""
473.517	(Laughter)
476.206	Thanks a lot, Jane.
477.412	What do you know about love?
478.849	(Laughter)
479.956	So the question is then,
481.889	how do you know when
481.889	is the right time to settle down,
484.502	given all the people
484.502	that you can date in your lifetime?
487.154	Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
487.154	of mathematics that we can use
490.628	to help us out here,
490.628	called optimal stopping theory.
493.196	So let's imagine, then,
495.201	that you start dating when you're 15
497.827	and ideally, you'd like to be married
497.827	by the time that you're 35.
501.62	And there's a number of people
503.086	that you could potentially
503.086	date across your lifetime,
505.607	and they'll be at varying
505.607	levels of goodness.
507.759	Now the rules are that once
507.759	you cash in and get married,
510.448	you can't look ahead to see
510.448	what you could have had,
512.902	and equally, you can't go back
512.902	and change your mind.
515.459	In my experience at least,
517.082	I find that typically people
517.082	don't much like being recalled
519.904	years after being passed up
519.904	for somebody else, or that's just me.
525.146	So the math says then
525.146	that what you should do
528.363	in the first 37 percent
528.363	of your dating window,
531.558	you should just reject everybody
531.558	as serious marriage potential.
535.339	(Laughter)
537.513	And then, you should pick
537.513	the next person that comes along
541.161	that is better than everybody
541.161	that you've seen before.
544.154	So here's the example.
545.599	Now if you do this, it can be
545.599	mathematically proven, in fact,
548.49	that this is the best possible way
550.975	of maximizing your chances
550.975	of finding the perfect partner.
555.328	Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
555.328	this method does come with some risks.
560.604	For instance, imagine
560.604	if your perfect partner appeared
565.437	during your first 37 percent.
568.143	Now, unfortunately,
568.143	you'd have to reject them.
570.939	(Laughter)
574.129	Now, if you're following the maths,
576.268	I'm afraid no one else comes along
577.925	that's better than anyone
577.925	you've seen before,
580.22	so you have to go on
580.22	rejecting everyone and die alone.
584.093	(Laughter)
586.56	Probably surrounded by cats ...
588.1	(Laughter)
589.838	nibbling at your remains.
591.429	OK, another risk is,
591.429	let's imagine, instead,
595.422	that the first people that you dated
595.422	in your first 37 percent
598.562	are just incredibly dull,
598.562	boring, terrible people.
602.839	That's OK, because
602.839	you're in your rejection phase,
605.245	so that's fine, you can reject them.
606.984	But then imagine
606.984	the next person to come along
610.381	is just marginally less boring,
610.381	dull and terrible ...
613.735	(Laughter)
614.858	than everybody that you've seen before.
616.78	Now, if you are following the maths,
616.78	I'm afraid you have to marry them ...
620.399	(Laughter)
621.478	and end up in a relationship
621.478	which is, frankly, suboptimal.
624.645	Sorry about that.
625.822	But I do think that there's an opportunity
625.822	here for Hallmark to cash in on
629.346	and really cater for this market.
630.952	A Valentine's Day card like this.
632.559	(Laughter)
633.739	"""My darling husband,"
633.739	you are marginally less terrible
636.765	than the first 37 percent
636.765	"of people I dated."""
638.943	(Laughter)
640.597	It's actually more romantic
640.597	than I normally manage.
643.745	(Laughter)
645.24	OK, so this method doesn't give you
645.24	a 100 percent success rate,
649.925	but there's no other possible
649.925	strategy that can do any better.
653.384	And actually, in the wild,
653.384	there are certain types of fish
656.838	which follow and employ
656.838	this exact strategy.
659.679	So they reject every possible
659.679	suitor that turns up
662.456	in the first 37 percent
662.456	of the mating season,
665.169	and then they pick the next fish
665.169	that comes along after that window
668.944	that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier
671.123	than all of the fish
671.123	that they've seen before.
673.725	I also think that subconsciously,
673.725	humans, we do sort of do this anyway.
678.626	We give ourselves a little bit of time
678.626	to play the field,
681.495	get a feel for the marketplace
681.495	or whatever when we're young.
685.115	And then we only start looking seriously
685.115	at potential marriage candidates
689.729	once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.
691.78	I think this is conclusive proof,
691.78	if ever it were needed,
695.014	that everybody's brains are prewired
695.014	to be just a little bit mathematical.
699.45	OK, so that was Top Tip #2.
701.477	Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.
705.351	OK, so let's imagine then
705.351	that you picked your perfect partner
708.299	and you're settling into
708.299	a lifelong relationship with them.
712.552	Now, I like to think that everybody
712.552	would ideally like to avoid divorce,
716.562	apart from, I don't know,
716.562	Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?
720.832	(Laughter)
722.185	But it's a sad fact of modern life
724.629	that one in two marriages
724.629	in the States ends in divorce,
727.913	with the rest of the world
727.913	not being far behind.
731.729	Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps
733.587	for thinking that the arguments
733.587	that precede a marital breakup
737.344	are not an ideal candidate
737.344	for mathematical investigation.
741.359	For one thing, it's very hard to know
743.165	what you should be measuring
743.165	or what you should be quantifying.
746.266	But this didn't stop a psychologist,
746.266	John Gottman, who did exactly that.
752.473	Gottman observed hundreds of couples
752.473	having a conversation
757.734	and recorded, well,
757.734	everything you can think of.
760.064	So he recorded what was said
760.064	in the conversation,
762.455	he recorded their skin conductivity,
764.772	he recorded their facial expressions,
766.859	their heart rates, their blood pressure,
768.874	basically everything apart from whether
768.874	or not the wife was actually always right,
775.134	which incidentally she totally is.
778.349	But what Gottman and his team found
781.022	was that one of the most
781.022	important predictors
784.061	for whether or not a couple
784.061	is going to get divorced
786.567	was how positive or negative each partner
786.567	was being in the conversation.
791.214	Now, couples that were very low-risk
793.568	scored a lot more positive points
793.568	on Gottman's scale than negative.
797.861	Whereas bad relationships,
800.426	by which I mean,
800.426	probably going to get divorced,
803.197	they found themselves getting
803.197	into a spiral of negativity.
807.578	Now just by using these very simple ideas,
809.862	Gottman and his group were able to predict
812.357	whether a given couple
812.357	was going to get divorced
815.103	with a 90 percent accuracy.
818.005	But it wasn't until he teamed up
818.005	with a mathematician, James Murray,
821.318	that they really started to understand
823.233	what causes these negativity spirals
823.233	and how they occur.
827.751	And the results that they found,
829.308	I think, are just incredibly
829.308	impressively simple and interesting.
833.981	So these equations predict how the wife
833.981	or husband is going to respond
838.568	in their next turn of the conversation,
840.48	how positive or negative
840.48	they're going to be.
842.637	And these equations depend on
844.046	the mood of the person
844.046	when they're on their own,
846.376	the mood of the person when
846.376	they're with their partner,
849.014	but most importantly, they depend on
850.763	how much the husband and wife
850.763	influence one another.
854.115	Now, I think it's important
854.115	to point out at this stage,
856.746	that these exact equations
856.746	have also been shown
860.279	to be perfectly able at describing
862.498	what happens between two countries
862.498	in an arms race.
867.01	(Laughter)
870.3	So that an arguing couple
870.3	spiraling into negativity
873.905	and teetering on the brink of divorce
875.834	is actually mathematically equivalent
875.834	to the beginning of a nuclear war.
880.107	(Laughter)
883.021	But the really important term
883.021	in this equation
885.358	is the influence that people
885.358	have on one another,
887.877	and in particular, something called
887.877	"""the negativity threshold."""
891.158	Now, the negativity threshold,
892.914	you can think of as
892.914	how annoying the husband can be
897.565	before the wife starts to get
897.565	really pissed off, and vice versa.
901.852	Now, I always thought that good marriages
901.852	were about compromise and understanding
906.408	and allowing the person
906.408	to have the space to be themselves.
909.194	So I would have thought that perhaps
909.194	the most successful relationships
912.571	were ones where there was
912.571	a really high negativity threshold.
915.875	Where couples let things go
917.692	and only brought things up
917.692	if they really were a big deal.
920.487	But actually, the mathematics
920.487	and subsequent findings by the team
924.762	have shown the exact opposite is true.
927.799	The best couples,
927.799	or the most successful couples,
930.132	are the ones with a really low
930.132	negativity threshold.
933.519	These are the couples
933.519	that don't let anything go unnoticed
937.177	and allow each other
937.177	some room to complain.
940.399	These are the couples that are continually
940.399	trying to repair their own relationship,
945.657	that have a much more positive
945.657	outlook on their marriage.
948.424	Couples that don't let things go
950.516	and couples that don't let trivial things
950.516	end up being a really big deal.
956.426	Now of course, it takes a bit more
956.426	than just a low negativity threshold
961.708	and not compromising
961.708	to have a successful relationship.
966.1	But I think that it's quite interesting
968.65	to know that there is really
968.65	mathematical evidence
971.028	to say that you should never
971.028	let the sun go down on your anger.
974.48	So those are my top three tips
976.188	of how maths can help you
976.188	with love and relationships.
979.383	But I hope, that aside from
979.383	their use as tips,
981.802	they also give you a little bit of insight
981.802	into the power of mathematics.
985.928	Because for me, equations
985.928	and symbols aren't just a thing.
990.684	They're a voice that speaks out
990.684	about the incredible richness of nature
995.119	and the startling simplicity
996.929	in the patterns that twist and turn
996.929	and warp and evolve all around us,
1001.766	from how the world works to how we behave.
1004.37	So I hope that perhaps,
1004.37	for just a couple of you,
1006.704	a little bit of insight
1006.704	into the mathematics of love
1009.213	can persuade you to have
1009.213	a little bit more love for mathematics.
1012.534	Thank you.
1013.757	(Applause)
