12.691	Almost a year ago,
14.036	my aunt started suffering back pains.
16.897	She went to see the doctor
18.262	and they told her it was a normal injury
20.511	for someone who had been playing tennis
22.165	for almost 30 years.
24.19	They recommended that she do some therapy,
26.158	but after a while she wasn't feeling better,
29.253	so the doctors decided to do further tests.
32.593	They did an x-ray
33.592	and discovered an injury in her lungs,
35.681	and at the time they thought that the injury
37.238	was a strain in the muscles and tendons
38.796	between her ribs,
39.966	but after a few weeks of treatment,
41.735	again her health wasn't getting any better.
45.793	So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,
49.483	and two weeks later,
50.7	the results of the biopsy came back.
53.443	It was stage 3 lung cancer.
58.212	Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.
61.114	She never smoked a cigarette,
62.847	she never drank alcohol,
64.613	and she had been playing sports
65.715	for almost half her life.
67.897	Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months
71.073	to get her properly diagnosed.
74.197	My story might be, unfortunately,
76.3	familiar to most of you.
78.539	One out of three people sitting in this audience
81.24	will be diagnosed with some type of cancer,
84.166	and one out of four
85.312	will die because of it.
88.91	Not only did that cancer diagnosis
90.992	change the life of our family,
92.859	but that process of going
94.872	back and forth with new tests,
97.48	different doctors describing symptoms,
99.248	discarding diseases over and over,
102.42	was stressful and frustrating,
104.8	especially for my aunt.
106.712	And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done
109.423	since the beginning of history.
111.763	We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs
114.609	to treat cancer,
116.172	but we still have 20th-century procedures
118.714	and processes for diagnosis, if any.
122.842	Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms
125.486	to indicate that something is wrong.
127.953	Today, the majority of people still don't have access
130.47	to early cancer detection methods,
132.888	even though we know
134.26	that catching cancer early
136.184	is basically the closest thing we have
137.647	to a silver bullet cure against it.
141.127	We know that we can change this in our lifetime,
143.608	and that is why my team and I
145.16	have decided to begin this journey,
147.354	this journey to try to make cancer detection
149.86	at the early stages
151.405	and monitoring the appropriate 
151.405	response at the molecular level
154.557	easier, cheaper, smarter
158.819	and more accessible than ever before.
162.276	The context, of course,
163.648	is that we're living at a time
165.191	where technology is disrupting our present
166.6	at exponential rates,
168.107	and the biological realm is no exception.
171.117	It is said today that biotech is advancing
173.547	at least six times faster than the growth rate
175.842	of the processing power of computers.
178.218	But progress in biotech
179.53	is not only being accelerated,
181.17	it is also being democratized.
183.216	Just as personal computers or the Internet
186.428	or smartphones leveled the playing field
188.879	for entrepreneurship, politics or education,
191.736	recent advances have leveled it
191.736	up for biotech progress as well,
195.156	and that is allowing
196.449	multidisciplinary teams like ours
198.564	to try to tackle and look at these problems
201.219	with new approaches.
203.57	We are a team of scientists and technologists
206.193	from Chile, Panama,
209.183	Mexico, Israel and Greece,
212.57	and based on recent scientific discoveries,
215.192	we believe that we have found
216.574	a reliable and accurate way
219.375	of detecting several types of cancer
221.377	at the very early stages through a blood sample.
224.275	We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules
227.223	that circulate freely in our blood
228.892	called microRNAs.
231.688	To explain what microRNAs are
233.999	and their important role in cancer,
236.214	I need to start with proteins,
237.607	because when cancer is present in our body,
240.16	protein modification is observed
241.591	in all cancerous cells.
243.202	As you might know,
244.575	proteins are large biological molecules
246.85	that perform different functions within our body,
249.19	like catalyzing metabolic reactions
251.275	or responding to stimuli
253.121	or replicating DNA,
254.923	but before a protein is expressed or produced,
257.666	relevant parts of its genetic code
259.364	present in the DNA
261.513	are copied into the messenger RNA,
265.482	so this messenger RNA
267.392	has instructions on how to build a specific protein,
271.106	and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,
273.706	but the one that tells them when to build them
276.303	and how many to build
278.632	are microRNAs.
281.07	So microRNAs are small molecules
282.9	that regulate gene expression.
285.1	Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,
287.315	microRNAs can vary depending on internal
289.464	and environmental conditions at any given time,
292.321	telling us which genes are actively 
292.321	expressed at that particular moment.
295.775	And that is what makes microRNAs
297.194	such a promising biomarker for cancer,
299.495	because as you know,
301.377	cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
305.19	It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.
308.744	Another important thing to consider
310.398	is that no two cancers are the same,
312.817	but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.
315.865	Several scientific studies have shown
318.115	that abnormal microRNA expression levels
321.456	varies and creates a unique, specific pattern
324.571	for each type of cancer,
326.259	even at the early stages,
327.991	reflecting the progression of the disease,
329.881	and whether it's responding to medication
331.782	or in remission,
332.99	making microRNAs a perfect,
335.123	highly sensitive biomarker.
338.727	However, the problem with microRNAs
341.401	is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology
343.95	to detect them in a reliable way,
346.563	because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,
349.353	much smaller than DNA.
351.535	And also, all microRNAs are
351.535	very similar to each other,
354.55	with just tiny differences.
356.597	So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,
359.117	extremely similar, extremely small.
362.311	We believe that we have found a way to do so,
365.217	and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.
367.966	Let me do a demonstration.
370.467	Imagine that next time you go to your doctor
372.908	and do your next standard blood test,
374.831	a lab technician extracts a total RNA,
377.183	which is quite simple today,
379.106	and puts it in a standard 
381.898	Each well of these plates
383.565	has specific biochemistry that we assign,
386.204	that is looking for a specific microRNA,
388.544	acting like a trap that closes
390.323	only when the microRNA is present in the sample,
392.68	and when it does, it will shine with green color.
395.801	To run the reaction,
396.904	you put the plate inside a device like this one,
400.04	and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.
403.93	If we can have a camera here
406.67	so you can see my screen.
409.378	A smartphone is a connected computer
411.774	and it's also a camera,
413.383	good enough for our purpose.
419.431	The smartphone is taking pictures,
421.411	and when the reaction is over,
422.755	it will send the pictures
423.798	to our online database for processing
426.112	and interpretation.
427.73	This entire process lasts around 60 minutes,
430.455	but when the process is over,
432.3	wells that shine are matched 
432.3	with the specific microRNAs
435.325	and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast
437.969	they shine.
439.218	And then, when this entire process is over,
443.486	this is what happens.
445.944	This chart is showing the specific microRNAs
448.541	present in this sample
449.976	and how they reacted over time.
452.388	Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA
454.89	of this person's samples
456.296	and compare it with existing scientific documentation
459.272	that correlates microRNA patterns
461.22	with a specific presence of a disease,
466.501	this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.
469.95	This inside is a real sample
472.607	where we just detected pancreatic cancer.
475.926	(Applause)
484.086	Another important aspect of this approach
486.444	is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,
488.783	so we can get results in real time
490.426	and analyze them with our contextual information.
493.863	If we want to better understand
495.341	and decode diseases like cancer,
497.456	we need to stop treating them
498.806	as acute, isolated episodes,
500.988	and consider and measure everything
502.912	that affects our health on a permanent basis.
507.22	This entire platform is a working prototype.
511.506	It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,
514.971	a low-cost, 3D-printed device,
517.717	and data science
519.679	to try to tackle one of humanity's 
519.679	toughest challenges.
523.594	Since we believe early cancer detection
525.596	should really be democratized,
527.384	this entire solution costs at least 50 times less
529.769	than current available methods,
531.77	and we know that the community can help us
533.503	accelerate this even more,
534.988	so we're making the design of the device
536.923	open-source.
539.4	(Applause)
547.944	Let me say very clearly
549.541	that we are at the very early stages,
551.276	but so far, we have been able
553.257	to successfully identify the microRNA pattern
555.866	of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,
559.128	breast cancer and hepatic cancer.
562.188	And currently, we're doing a clinical trial
565.37	in collaboration with the
565.37	German Cancer Research Center
568.249	with 200 women for breast cancer.
571.84	(Applause)
575.448	This is the single non-invasive,
578.162	accurate and affordable test
580.904	that has the potential to dramatically change
583.15	how cancer procedures and diagnostics
584.96	have been done.
586.78	Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns
588.397	in your blood at any given time,
590.962	you don't need to know
590.962	which cancer you're looking for.
592.858	You don't need to have any symptoms.
595.025	You only need one milliliter of blood
597.833	and a relatively simple array of tools.
601.343	Today, cancer detection happens mainly
604.155	when symptoms appear.
606.24	That is, at stage 3 or 4,
608.869	and I believe that is too late.
610.793	It is too expensive for our families.
612.941	It is too expensive for humanity.
615.393	We cannot lose the war against cancer.
618.34	It not only costs us billions of dollars,
620.23	but it also costs us the people we love.
623.152	Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely
626.65	and going through this process
626.65	with a very positive attitude.
629.56	However, I want fights like this
632.138	to become very rare.
633.761	I want to see the day
634.888	when cancer is treated easily
636.815	because it can be routinely diagnosed
638.967	at the very early stages,
640.924	and I'm certain
642.016	that in the very near future,
644.152	because of this
645.45	and other breakthroughs that we are seeing
646.69	every day in the life sciences,
648.713	the way we see cancer
650.345	will radically change.
652.336	It will give us the chance of detecting it early,
654.8	understanding it better,
656.565	and finding a cure.
658.801	Thank you very much.
660.48	(Applause)
