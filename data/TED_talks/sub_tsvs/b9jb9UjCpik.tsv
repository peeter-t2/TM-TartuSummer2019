14.022	This back here was my brain cancer.
19.125	Isn't it nice?
20.869	(Laughter)
23.336	"The key phrase is ""was,"""
25.822	phew.
27.481	(Applause)
32.547	Having brain cancer was really,
32.547	as you can imagine,
36.739	shocking news for me.
38.615	I knew nothing about cancer.
42.059	In Western cultures, when you have cancer,
45.894	it's as if you disappear in a way.
48.509	Your life as a complex human being
48.509	is replaced by medical data:
55.147	Your images, your exams, your lab values,
61.258	a list of medicines.
63.74	And everyone changes as well.
66.439	You suddenly become a disease on legs.
69.384	Doctors start speaking a language
69.384	which you don't understand.
73.983	They start pointing their fingers
79.337	at your body and your images.
84.187	People start changing as well
87.234	because they start dealing
87.234	with the disease,
91.1	instead of with the human being.
93.459	"They say, ""What did the doctor say?"""
95.644	"before even saying, ""Hello."""
99.976	And in the meanwhile,
101.923	you're left with questions
101.923	to which nobody gives an answer.
107.113	"These are the ""Can I?"" questions:"
109.888	Can I work while I have cancer?
112.507	Can I study? Can I make love?
112.507	Can I be creative?
117.864	"And you wonder, ""What have I done"
117.864	"to deserve this?"""
121.342	"You wonder, ""Can I change something"
121.342	"about my lifestyle?"""
125.5	"You wonder, ""Can I do something?"
128.198	"Are there any other options?"""
132.333	And, obviously, doctors are
132.333	the good guys in all these scenarios,
137.988	because they are very professional
137.988	and dedicated to curing you.
143.934	But they also are very used
143.934	to having to deal with patients,
149.192	so I'd say that they sometimes
149.192	lose the idea that this is torture for you
156.148	and that you become,
156.148	literally, a patient --
161.103	"""patient"" means ""the one who waits."""
163.538	(Laughter)
164.955	Things are changing, but classically,
169.168	they tend to not engage you in any way
169.168	to learn about your condition,
174.841	to get your friends and family engaged,
178.988	or showing you ways
178.988	in which you can change your lifestyle
182.752	to minimize the risks
182.752	of what you're going through.
186.083	But instead, you're forced there to wait
189.971	in the hands of a series
189.971	of very professional strangers.
196.815	While I was in the hospital,
198.914	I asked for a printed-out
198.914	picture of my cancer
202.356	and I spoke with it.
205.12	It was really hard to obtain,
207.342	because it's not common practice
207.342	to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
212.294	I talked to it and I said,
214.083	"""Okay, cancer,"
214.083	you're not all there is to me.
218.635	There's more to me.
220.647	A cure, whichever it is, will have
220.647	"to deal with the whole of me."""
227.086	And so, the next day, I left the hospital
227.086	against medical advice.
233.024	I was determined to change
233.024	my relationship with the cancer
237.616	and I was determined
237.616	to learn more about my cancer
240.484	before doing anything
240.484	as drastic as a surgery.
246.037	I'm an artist, I use several forms
246.037	of open-source technologies
252.951	and open information in my practice.
255.494	So my best bet was to get it all
255.494	out there, get the information out there,
261.605	and use it so that it could be
261.605	accessed by anyone.
268.269	So I created a website,
268.269	which is called La Cura,
272.246	on which I put my medical data, online.
275.398	I actually had to hack it
277.295	and that's a thing which we
277.295	can talk about in another speech.
281.475	(Laughter)
282.822	I chose this word, La Cura --
285.403	"La Cura in Italian means ""the cure"" --"
287.762	because in many different cultures,
290.514	"the word ""cure"" can mean"
290.514	many different things.
295.066	In our Western cultures,
296.749	it means eradicating
296.749	or reversing a disease,
301.242	but in different cultures,
302.77	for example, a culture from Asia,
306.35	from the Mediterranean,
306.35	from Latin countries, from Africa,
310.486	it can mean many more things.
312.628	Of course, I was interested
312.628	in the opinions of doctors
318.015	and healthcare providers,
320.264	but I was also interested in
320.264	the cure of the artist, of the poet,
326.259	of the designer,
328.436	of, who knows, the musicians.
332.889	I was interested in the social cure,
335.789	I was interested in
335.789	the psychological cure,
338.487	I was interested in the spiritual cure,
341.001	I was interested in the emotional cure,
344.059	I was interested in any form of cure.
348.92	And, it worked.
352.616	The La Cura website went viral.
355.969	I received lots of media attention
355.969	from Italy and from abroad
360.694	and I quickly received
360.694	more than 500,000 contacts --
366.44	emails, social networking --
368.378	most of them were a suggestion
368.378	on how to cure my cancer,
371.573	but more of them were about
371.573	how to cure myself
375.004	as a full individual.
378.283	For example, many thousands of videos,
382.365	images, pictures, art performances
386.319	were produced for La Cura.
388.756	For example, here we see
388.756	Francesca Fini in her performance.
393.141	Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done:
397.522	He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor
402.1	and put it on sale on Thingiverse.
404.821	Now you can have my cancer, too!
407.044	(Laughter)
409.581	Which is a nice thing,
409.581	if you think about it,
412.998	we can share our cancer.
416.234	And this was going on --
418.633	scientists, the traditional
418.633	medicine experts,
422.018	several researchers, doctors --
423.705	all connected with me to give advice.
426.401	With all this information and support,
428.32	I was able to form a team
428.32	of several neurosurgeons,
434.009	traditional doctors,
436.995	oncologists, and several
436.995	hundred volunteers
443.144	with whom I was able to discuss
446.373	the information I was receiving,
446.373	which is very important.
451.796	And together, we were able to form
451.796	a strategy for my own cure
458.165	in many languages,
458.165	according to many cultures.
461.816	And the current strategy
461.816	spans the whole world
465.005	and thousands of years of human history,
467.627	which is quite remarkable for me.
469.71	[Surgery]
471.394	The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily,
471.394	little to no growth of the cancer.
477.005	So I was able to take my time and choose.
480.426	I chose the doctor I wanted to work with,
484.091	I chose the hospital I wanted to stay in,
486.489	and in the meanwhile, I was supported
486.489	by thousands of people,
490.5	none of whom felt pity for me.
493.751	Everyone felt like they could
493.751	take an active role
499.429	in helping me to get well,
501.265	and this was the most important
501.265	part of La Cura.
506.081	What are the outcomes?
508.122	I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine.
510.479	(Applause)
515.795	I had excellent news
518.227	after the surgery --
519.857	I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma,
525.376	"which is a ""good"" kind of cancer"
525.376	which doesn't grow a lot.
529.822	I have completely changed
529.822	my life and my lifestyle.
534.25	Everything I did was thoughtfully
534.25	designed to get me engaged.
540.055	Up until the very last few
540.055	minutes of the surgery,
544.195	which was very intense,
546.186	a matrix of electrodes
546.186	was implanted in my brain
550.131	from this side,
552.021	to be able to build a functional map
552.021	of what the brain controls.
557.278	And right before the operation,
560.976	we were able to discuss
560.976	the functional map of my brain
567.777	with the doctor, to understand
567.777	which risks I was running into
572.684	and if there were any I wanted to avoid.
576.312	Obviously, there were.
578.452	[Open]
579.529	And this openness was really
579.529	the fundamental part of La Cura.
584.98	Thousands of people shared
584.98	their stories, their experiences.
589.799	Doctors got to talk with people
589.799	they don't usually consult
594.427	when they think about cancer.
599.37	I'm a self-founding,
599.37	continuous state of translation
604.043	among many different languages,
606.363	in which science meets emotion
610.26	and conventional research
610.26	meets traditional research.
614.921	[Society]
616.263	The most important thing of La Cura
621.635	was to feel like a part
621.635	of a really engaged and connected society
628.66	whose wellness really depends
628.66	on the wellness of all of its components.
636.253	This global performance
636.253	is my open-source cure for cancer.
641.873	And from what I feel,
643.679	it's a cure for me, but for us all.
646.079	Thank you.
647.256	(Applause).
