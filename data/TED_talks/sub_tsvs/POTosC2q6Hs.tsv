13.533	As a software developer and technologist,
16.479	I've worked on a number
16.479	of civic technology projects
19.126	over the years.
20.472	Civic tech is sometimes
20.472	referred to as tech for good,
24.118	using technology to solve
24.118	humanitarian problems.
27.763	This is in 2010 in Uganda,
29.876	working on a solution
29.876	that allowed local populations
32.616	to avoid government surveillance
32.616	on their mobile phones
36.099	for expressing dissent.
38.328	That same technology was deployed
38.328	later in North Africa
41.216	for similar purposes
41.216	to help activists stay connected
44.998	when governments were
44.998	deliberately shutting off connectivity
48.149	as a means of population control.
51.336	But over the years, as I have thought
51.336	about these technologies
54.522	and the things that I work on,
56.523	a question kind of nags
56.523	in the back of my mind, which is,
59.542	what if we're wrong about
59.542	the virtues of technology,
62.267	and if it sometimes actively hurts
64.519	the communities
64.519	that we're intending to help?
67.677	The tech industry around the world
67.677	tends to operate under similar assumptions
71.456	that if we build great things,
73.621	it will positively affect everyone.
76.035	Eventually, these innovations
76.035	will get out and find everyone.
79.904	But that's not always the case.
82.003	I like to call this blind championing
82.003	"of technology ""trickle-down techonomics,"""
87.784	to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)
90.129	We tend to think that if
90.129	we design things for the select few,
93.045	eventually those technologies
93.045	will reach everyone,
95.447	and that's not always the case.
97.002	Technology and innovation
97.002	behaves a lot like wealth and capital.
102.018	They tend to consolidate
102.018	in the hands of the few,
104.897	and sometimes they find their way out
104.897	into the hands of the many.
108.287	And so most of you aren't tackling
108.287	oppressive regimes on the weekends,
113.488	so I wanted to think of a few examples
113.488	that might be a little bit more relatable.
117.714	In the world of wearables
117.714	and smartphones and apps,
122.066	there's a big movement
122.066	to track people's personal health
125.329	with applications that track
125.329	the number of calories that you burn
128.401	or whether you're sitting too much
128.401	or walking enough.
133.22	These technologies make patient intake
133.22	in medical facilities much more efficient,
139.561	and in turn, these medical facilities
143.496	are starting to expect
143.496	these types of efficiencies.
146.083	As these digital tools
146.083	find their way into medical rooms,
148.883	and they become digitally ready,
150.928	what happens to the digitally invisible?
153.297	What does the medical experience look like
155.321	for someone who doesn't have
155.321	the $400 phone or watch
158.655	tracking their every movement?
160.448	Do they now become a burden
160.448	on the medical system?
163.281	Is their experience changed?
166.079	In the world of finance,
166.079	Bitcoin and crypto-currencies
169.341	are revolutionizing the way
169.341	we move money around the world,
172.261	but the challenge with these technologies
174.658	is the barrier to entry
174.658	is incredibly high, right?
177.247	You need access to the same
177.247	phones, devices, connectivity,
181.043	and even where you don't,
181.043	where you can find a proxy agent,
184.178	usually they require a certain amount
184.178	of capital to participate.
189.217	And so the question that I ask myself
189.217	is, what happens to the last community
194	using paper notes when the rest
194	of the world moves to digital currency?
200.26	Another example from my hometown
200.26	in Philadelphia:
203.055	I recently went
203.055	to the public library there,
205.22	and they are facing an existential crisis.
207.792	Public funding is dwindling,
209.465	they have to reduce their footprint
209.465	to stay open and stay relevant,
214.641	and so one of the ways
214.641	they're going about this
217.477	is digitizing a number of the books
217.477	and moving them to the cloud.
220.77	This is great for most kids. Right?
222.745	You can check out books from home,
224.598	you can research on the way
224.598	to school or from school,
227.147	but these are really two big assumptions,
229.339	that one, you have access at home,
231.336	and two, that you have access
231.336	to a mobile phone,
233.936	and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.
236.812	So what does their
236.812	education experience look like
239.671	in the wake of a completely
239.671	cloud-based library,
243.108	what used to be considered
243.108	such a basic part of education?
246.567	How do they stay competitive?
249.566	A final example from
249.566	across the world in East Africa:
253.466	there's been a huge movement
253.466	to digitize land ownership rights,
258.782	for a number of reasons.
260.383	Migrant communities,
260.383	older generations dying off,
263.285	and ultimately poor record-keeping
265.925	have led to conflicts over who owns what.
269.392	And so there was a big movement
269.392	to put all this information online,
273.664	to track all the ownership
273.664	of these plots of land,
277.424	put them in the cloud,
277.424	and give them to the communities.
280.119	But actually, the unintended
280.119	consequence of this
283.161	has been that venture capitalists,
283.161	investors, real estate developers,
287.584	have swooped in and they've begun
287.584	buying up these plots of land
290.647	right out from under these communities,
292.564	because they have access
292.564	to the technologies
294.7	and the connectivity
294.7	that makes that possible.
298.137	So that's the common thread
298.137	that connects these examples,
301.287	the unintended consequences of the tools
301.287	and the technologies that we make.
304.836	As engineers, as technologists,
307.801	we sometimes prefer
307.801	efficiency over efficacy.
311.36	We think more about doing things
311.36	than the outcomes of what we are doing.
315.753	This needs to change.
317.22	We have a responsibility to think about
317.22	the outcomes of the technologies we build,
321.251	especially as they increasingly
321.251	control the world in which we live.
324.734	In the late '90s,
326.174	there was a big push for ethics
326.174	in the world of investment and banking.
330.283	I think in 2014, we're long overdue
330.283	for a similar movement
334.091	in the area of tech and technology.
338.573	So, I just encourage you, as you are all
338.573	thinking about the next big thing,
342.535	as entrepreneurs, as CEOs,
342.535	as engineers, as makers,
347.907	that you think about
347.907	the unintended consequences
351.784	of the things that you're building,
353.944	because the real innovation
353.944	is in finding ways to include everyone.
357.496	Thank you.
359.168	(Applause)
