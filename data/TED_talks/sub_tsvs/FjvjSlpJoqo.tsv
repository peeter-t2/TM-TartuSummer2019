20.236	I am honored to be here,
21.648	and I'm honored to talk about this topic,
23.649	which I think is of grave importance.
25.498	We've been talking a lot
26.745	about the horrific impacts of plastic
26.745	on the planet and on other species,
32.712	but plastic hurts people, too --
35.211	especially poor people.
37.26	And both in the production of plastic,
40.442	the use of plastic
40.442	and the disposal of plastic,
43.184	the people who have
43.184	the bull's-eye on their foreheads
45.773	are poor people.
47.487	People got very upset
50.588	when the BP oil spill happened,
53.691	for very good reason.
55.175	"People thought, ""Oh, my God."
56.823	This is terrible, this oil --
56.823	it's in the water.
59.623	It's going to destroy
59.623	the living systems there.
63.565	People are going to be hurt.
65.023	This is a terrible thing,
66.538	this oil is going to hurt
66.538	"the people in the Gulf."""
68.897	What people don't think about is:
70.991	What if the oil had made it
70.991	safely to shore?
73.744	What if the oil actually got
73.744	where it was trying to go?
77.074	Not only would it have been burned
77.074	in engines and added to global warming,
81.095	"but there's a place called ""Cancer Alley,"""
84.48	"and the reason it's called ""Cancer Alley"""
86.639	is because the petrochemical industry
89.291	takes that oil and turns it into plastic
91.471	and in the process, kills people.
94.174	It shortens the lives of the people
94.174	who live there in the Gulf.
97.246	So oil and petrochemicals are not
97.246	just a problem when there's a spill;
101.064	they're a problem when there's not.
102.798	And what we don't often appreciate
105.229	is the price that poor people pay
106.927	for us to have these disposable products.
109.453	The other thing
109.453	we often don't appreciate is,
111.622	it's not just at the point of production
111.622	that poor people suffer.
114.746	Poor people also suffer
114.746	at the point of use.
117.396	Those of us who earn
117.396	a certain income level,
119.505	we have something called choice.
121.931	The reason why you want
121.931	to work hard and have a job
124.42	and not be poor and broke
126.115	is so you can have choices,
126.115	economic choices.
128.952	We actually get a chance
128.952	to choose not to use products
133.061	that have dangerous,
133.061	poisonous plastic in them.
135.302	Other people who are poor
135.302	don't have those choices.
137.861	So low-income people often are the ones
139.859	who are buying the products that have
139.859	those dangerous chemicals in them
143.867	that their children are using.
145.33	Those are the people who wind up
145.33	ingesting a disproportionate amount
149.178	of this poisonous plastic in using it.
151.369	"And people say, ""Well, they should"
151.369	"just buy a different product."""
154.626	Well, the problem with being poor
154.626	is you don't have those choices.
157.785	You often have to buy
157.785	the cheapest products.
159.897	The cheapest products
159.897	are often the most dangerous.
162.9	And if that weren't bad enough --
164.52	if it wasn't just the production
164.52	of plastic that's giving people cancer
167.965	in places like Cancer Alley,
169.493	and shortening lives and hurting
169.493	poor kids at the point of use --
173.025	at the point of disposal,
175.132	once again, it's poor people
175.132	who bear the burden.
178.762	Often, we think we're doing a good thing:
181.391	You're in your office, drinking
181.391	your bottled water or whatever it is,
185.063	and you think to yourself,
185.063	"""I'm going to throw this away."
187.846	No -- I'm going to be virtuous.
187.846	"I'm going to put it in the blue bin."""
191.4	"You think, ""I put mine in the blue bin."""
193.456	And then you look
193.456	at your colleague and say,
197.044	"""Why, you cretin!"
197.044	"You put yours in the white bin."""
200.52	And we use that as a moral tickle.
202.83	We feel so good about ourselves.
204.599	If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.
207.878	Not you, but I feel this way often.
209.602	(Laughter)
211.26	And so we kind of have
211.26	this moral feel-good moment.
214.58	But if we were to be able
214.58	to follow that little bottle
217.976	on its journey,
219.465	we would be shocked
219.465	to discover that, all too often,
222.054	that bottle is going to be put on a boat,
225.309	it's going to go all the way
225.309	across the ocean
228.146	at some expense,
229.486	and it's going to wind up
229.486	in a developing country, often China.
233.029	I think in our minds, we imagine
234.641	somebody's going to take
234.641	the little bottle and say,
237.125	"""Oh, little bottle! We're so happy"
237.125	"to see you, little bottle."""
240.41	(Laughter)
242.26	"""You've served so well."""
244.648	(Laughter)
245.695	He's given a little bottle massage,
247.56	a little bottle medal.
249.26	"And they say, ""What would"
249.26	"you like to do next?"""
251.482	The little bottle says,
251.482	"""I just don't know ..."""
253.854	(Laughter)
255.204	But that's not actually what happens.
258.35	You know?
259.86	That bottle winds up getting burned.
264.677	The recycling of plastic
264.677	in many developing countries
268.323	means the incineration of the plastic,
268.323	the burning of the plastic,
271.497	which releases incredible toxic chemicals
273.947	and, once again, kills people.
275.804	And so, poor people
275.804	who are making these products
279.548	in petrochemical centers
279.548	like Cancer Alley,
282.334	poor people who are consuming
282.334	these products disproportionately,
285.436	and then poor people who,
285.436	even at the tail end of the recycling,
288.974	are having their lives shortened.
290.76	They're all being harmed -- greatly --
294.38	by this addiction that we have
294.38	to disposability.
299.244	Now, you think to yourself --
299.244	I know how you are --
301.75	"you say, ""That sure is terrible"
301.75	for those poor people.
306.538	It's just awful. Those poor people.
310.076	I hope someone does
310.076	"something to help them."""
312.862	But what we don't understand is --
316.025	here we are in Los Angeles.
317.85	We worked very hard
317.85	to get the smog reduction
320.005	happening here in Los Angeles.
321.584	But guess what?
322.839	Because they're doing so much
322.839	dirty production in Asia now,
326.218	because the environmental laws
326.218	don't protect the people in Asia now,
329.85	almost all of the clean air gains
329.85	and the toxic air gains
333.916	that we've achieved here in California
335.812	have been wiped out
335.812	by dirty air coming over from Asia.
339.931	So we all are being hit.
339.931	We all are being impacted.
342.661	It's just that the poor people
342.661	get it first and worst.
345.439	But the dirty production,
345.439	the burning of toxins,
348.654	the lack of environmental
348.654	standards in Asia,
350.938	is actually creating so much
350.938	dirty air pollution,
353.455	it's coming across the ocean,
354.896	and has erased our gains
354.896	here in California.
357.034	We're back where we were in the 1970s.
358.952	And so we're on one planet,
360.903	and we have to be able to get
360.903	to the root of these problems.
363.872	The root of this problem, in my view,
366.954	is the idea of disposability itself.
369.998	You see, if you understand the link
373.043	between what we're doing
373.043	to poison and pollute the planet
376.795	and what we're doing to poor people,
379.26	you arrive at a very troubling
379.26	but also very helpful insight:
384.296	In order to trash the planet,
386.568	you have to trash people.
388.783	But if you create a world
388.783	where you don't trash people,
391.747	you can't trash the planet.
393.56	So now we are at a moment
396.05	where the coming together
396.05	of social justice as an idea
398.922	and ecology as an idea,
401.371	we finally can now see
402.68	that they are really,
402.68	at the end of the day, one idea.
405.269	And it's the idea that we don't have
405.269	disposable anything.
408.465	We don't have disposable resources.
411.56	We don't have disposable species.
414.215	And we don't have
414.215	disposable people, either.
416.795	We don't have a throwaway planet,
418.841	and we don't have throwaway
418.841	children -- it's all precious.
421.656	And as we all begin to come back
421.656	to that basic understanding,
424.56	new opportunities for action
424.56	begin to emerge.
428.155	Biomimicry,
429.85	which is an emerging science,
433.391	winds up being a very important
433.391	social justice idea.
436.996	People who are just
436.996	learning about this stuff:
439.212	biomimicry means respecting
439.212	the wisdom of all species.
443.211	Democracy, by the way,
444.399	means respecting the wisdom
444.399	of all people -- we'll get to that.
447.43	But biomimicry means
447.43	respecting the wisdom of all species.
450.24	It turns out we're a pretty
450.24	clever species.
452.774	We have this big cortex,
452.774	we're pretty proud of ourselves.
455.877	But if we want to make something hard,
458.464	"we say, ""I know! I'm going"
458.464	to make a hard substance.
461.002	I know! I'm going to get
461.002	vacuums and furnaces
464.56	and drag stuff out of the ground
466.268	and get things hot
466.268	and poison and pollute ...
469.181	"But I got this hard thing!"""
472.064	(Laughter)
473.238	"""I'm so clever!"""
474.861	And you look behind you,
474.861	and there's destruction all around you.
477.93	But guess what?
479.107	You're so clever,
479.107	but you're not as clever as a clam.
481.964	A clamshell is hard.
483.718	There's no vacuums.
483.718	There's no big furnaces.
486.413	There's no poison. There's no pollution.
488.377	It turns out that other species
488.377	figured out a long time ago
493.201	how to create many of the things we need
495.56	using biological processes
495.56	that nature knows how to use well.
499.223	That insight of biomimicry,
499.223	of our scientists finally realizing
502.922	that we have as much
502.922	to learn from other species --
505.354	I don't mean taking a mouse
505.354	and sticking it with stuff.
508.56	I don't mean looking at it from that way,
508.56	abusing the little species.
511.893	I mean actually respecting them,
511.893	respecting what they've achieved.
515.173	That's called biomimicry,
516.754	and that opens the door
516.754	to zero waste production;
520.651	zero pollution production;
522.56	that we could actually enjoy
524.56	a high quality of life,
524.56	a high standard of living,
527.205	without trashing the planet.
528.8	Well, that idea of biomimicry,
531.864	respecting the wisdom of all species,
534.226	combined with the idea
534.226	of democracy and social justice,
538.122	respecting the wisdom
538.122	and the worth of all people,
540.741	would give us a different society.
542.56	We would have a different economy.
544.456	We would have a green society
546.79	that Dr. King would be proud of.
549.219	That should be the goal.
550.893	And the way that we get there
550.893	is to first of all recognize
553.885	that the idea of disposability
556.826	not only hurts the species
556.826	we've talked about,
560.96	but it even corrupts our own society.
563.735	We're so proud to live here in California.
566.736	We just had this vote,
566.736	and everybody's like,
568.846	"""Well -- not in our state!"""
570.608	(Laughter)
572.153	I don't know what those
572.153	"other states were doing, but ..."""
574.96	(Laughter)
576.726	Just so proud.
579.321	And, yeah, I'm proud, too.
581.696	But ...
584.42	California, though we lead the world
584.42	in some of the green stuff,
587.96	we also, unfortunately, lead the world
589.96	in some of the gulag stuff.
592.666	California has one of the highest
592.666	incarceration rates
596.23	of all the 50 states.
597.96	We have a moral challenge
597.96	in this movement.
601.077	We are passionate about rescuing
601.077	some dead materials from the landfill,
606.121	but sometimes not as passionate
607.961	about rescuing living beings,
607.961	living people.
610.674	And I would say
610.674	that we live in a country --
613.817	five percent of the world's population,
618.332	but also 25 percent
618.332	of the world's prisoners.
621.344	One of every four people
621.344	locked up anywhere in the world
624.028	is locked up right here
624.028	in the United States.
626.226	So that is consistent with this idea
628.96	that disposability
628.96	is something we believe in.
632.176	And yet,
634.5	as a movement that has to broaden
634.5	its constituency,
639.046	that has to grow,
640.381	that has to reach out
640.381	beyond our natural comfort zone,
643.507	one of the challenges
643.507	to the success of this movement,
646.444	of getting rid of things like plastic
646.444	and helping the economy shift,
649.708	is people look at our movement
649.708	with some suspicion.
653.124	And they ask a question,
653.124	and the question is:
655.744	How can these people be so passionate?
658.506	A poor person, a low-income person,
658.506	somebody in Cancer Alley,
661.769	somebody in Watts,
664.227	somebody in Harlem,
664.227	somebody on an Indian reservation,
666.96	might say to themselves --
666.96	and rightfully so --
669.202	"""How can these people be so passionate"
672.108	about making sure
673.873	that a plastic bottle
673.873	has a second chance in life,
677.96	or an aluminum can has a second chance,
681.171	and yet, when my child gets in trouble
681.171	and goes to prison,
684.761	"he doesn't get a second chance?"""
686.594	"""How can this movement"
686.594	be so passionate about saying
689.1	we don't have throwaway stuff,
689.1	no throwaway dead materials,
691.944	and yet accept throwaway lives
694.783	and throwaway communities
694.783	"like Cancer Alley?"""
697.124	And so, we now get a chance
697.124	to be truly proud of this movement.
702.698	When we take on topics like this,
704.409	it gives us that extra call
704.409	to reach out to other movements
709.065	and to become more inclusive and to grow,
711.431	and we can finally get out of
711.431	this crazy dilemma that we've been in.
715.229	Most of you are good, softhearted people.
718.649	When you were younger,
718.649	you cared about the whole world,
721.329	and at some point, somebody said
721.329	you had to pick an issue,
725.098	you had to boil your love
725.098	down to an issue.
727.542	"""Can't love the whole world --"
729.089	you've got to work on trees
729.089	or you've got to work on immigration.
732.707	You've got to shrink it down
732.707	"and be about one issue."""
735.635	And really, they fundamentally told you,
738.579	"""Are you going to hug a tree?"
740.713	Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.
742.864	Are you going to hug a tree?
744.5	"Or are you going to hug a child? Pick."""
746.593	Well, when you start working
746.593	on issues like plastic,
749.069	you realize the whole thing is connected.
751.292	And luckily, most of us are blessed
751.292	to have two arms --
754.096	we can hug both.
755.511	Thank you very much.
756.904	(Applause)
