13.046	One billion people in the world today
15.565	do not have access to all-season roads.
17.845	One billion people.
19.55	One seventh of the Earth's population
21.721	are totally cut off for some part of the year.
25.03	We cannot get medicine to them reliably,
27.358	they cannot get critical supplies,
29.704	and they cannot get their goods to market
31.693	in order to create a sustainable income.
35.583	In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,
41.64	Investments are being made,
43.659	but at the current level,
45.204	it's estimated it's going to take them
49.707	In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million
52.001	miles of roads, very expensive to build,
55.132	very expensive to maintain infrastructure,
58.503	with a huge ecological footprint,
60.772	and yet, very often, congested.
64.444	So we saw this and we thought,
66.826	can there be a better way?
68.309	Can we create a system using today's
68.309	most advanced technologies
71.764	that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog
74.884	in the same way they've done with mobile telephones
77.239	in the last 10 years?
79.114	Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today
82.059	without ever putting copper lines in the ground.
85.036	Could we do the same for transportation?
88.386	Imagine this scenario.
90.701	Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,
93.859	and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.
97.089	What would you do today?
99.321	Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,
101.718	and someone would get the request immediately.
104.582	That's the part that works.
106.575	The medication may take days to arrive, though,
108.612	because of bad roads.
110.022	That's the part that's broken.
112.378	We believe we can deliver it within hours
114.895	with an electric autonomous flying vehicle
117.476	such as this.
118.881	This can transport a small payload
118.881	today, about two kilograms,
121.766	over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,
124.4	but it's part of a wider network that may cover
126.755	the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.
130.715	It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
135.053	It's a network for a transportation of matter.
137.988	We call it Matternet.
139.765	We use three key technologies.
141.279	The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.
143.914	The second is automated ground stations
146.625	that the vehicles fly in and out of
148.604	to swap batteries and fly farther,
150.862	or pick up or deliver loads.
152.604	And the third is the operating system
154.335	that manages the whole network.
157.078	Let's look at each one of those
157.078	technologies in a bit more detail.
160.417	First of all, the UAVs.
162.662	Eventually, we're going to be
162.662	using all sorts of vehicles
164.746	for different payload capacities and different ranges.
167.2	Today, we're using small quads.
169.456	These are able to transport two kilograms
171.799	over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.
174.612	Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road
177.138	in the developing world,
178.552	or even being stuck in traffic
180.772	in a developed world country.
182.817	These fly autonomously.
184.527	This is the key to the technology.
186.083	So they use GPS and other sensors on board
188.443	to navigate between ground stations.
192.137	Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic
194.562	payload and battery exchange mechanism,
197.6	so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,
200.006	they dock, swap a battery automatically,
202.122	and go out again.
203.826	The ground stations are located on safe locations
206.582	on the ground.
208.144	They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,
210.143	which is the landing.
211.997	They are at known locations on the ground,
214.089	so the paths between them are also known,
216.009	which is very important from a reliability perspective
218.747	from the whole network.
220.298	Apart from fulfilling the energy
220.298	requirements of the vehicles,
223.122	eventually they're going to be becoming
225.494	commercial hubs where people can take out loads
228.194	or put loads into the network.
231.257	The last component is the operating system
233.48	that manages the whole network.
235.374	It monitors weather data from all the ground stations
238.115	and optimizes the routes of
238.115	the vehicles through the system
241.456	to avoid adverse weather conditions,
244.047	avoid other risk factors,
246.05	and optimize the use of the resources
247.77	throughout the network.
249.668	I want to show you what one of those flights
251.31	looks like.
253.078	Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,
257.02	where we've done our first field trials.
259.463	We're modeling here a medical delivery
261.607	in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.
266.447	People there love this.
268.998	And I want to show you
271.127	what one of those vehicles looks like up close.
276.003	So this is a $3,000 vehicle.
278.011	Costs are coming down very rapidly.
282.028	We use this in all sorts of weather conditions,
285.203	very hot and very cold climates,
286.998	very strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.
293.096	Imagine if your life depended on this package,
297.115	somewhere in Africa
298.559	or in New York City, after Sandy.
302.822	The next big question is, what's the cost?
306.128	Well, it turns out that the cost to transport
309.938	two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle
313.897	is just 24 cents.
317.27	(Applause)
322.342	And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy
325.086	expended for the flight is only two cents
327.075	of a dollar today,
328.413	and we're just at the beginning of this.
330.546	When we saw this, we felt that this is something
333.148	that can have significant impact in the world.
336.147	So we said, okay, how much does it cost
338.565	to set up a network somewhere in the world?
340.633	And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho
342.663	for transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.
345.704	The problem there is how do you take them
348.111	from clinics where they're being collected
350.34	to hospitals where they're being analyzed?
353.36	And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area
355.502	spanning around 140 square kilometers?
358.159	That's roughly one and a half times
358.159	the size of Manhattan.
361.633	Well it turns out that the cost to do that there
363.8	would be less than a million dollars.
366.775	Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.
370.006	We think this can be -- this is the power
373.163	of a new paradigm.
375.882	So here we are: a new idea
378.365	about a network for transportation
380.235	that is based on the ideas of the Internet.
382.881	It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,
385.11	it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,
387.813	with very low infrastructure investment,
390.323	very low ecological footprint.
394.456	If it is a new paradigm, though,
396.74	there must be other uses for it.
398.886	It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.
401.052	So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:
405.23	our cities and megacities.
407.235	Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.
410.107	Half a billion of us live in megacities.
412.827	We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.
415.507	China alone is adding a megacity
417.48	the size of New York City every two years.
420.587	These are places that do have road infrastructure,
423.24	but it's very inefficient.
425.554	Congestion is a huge problem.
427.686	So we think it makes sense in those places
429.626	to set up a network of transportation
431.996	that is a new layer that sits between the road
434.162	and the Internet,
435.433	initially for lightweight, urgent stuff,
438.339	and over time, we would hope to develop this
440.388	into a new mode of transportation
442.38	that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.
445.832	It's ultimately scalable
447.386	with a very small ecological footprint,
450.244	operating in the background 24/7,
453.22	just like the Internet.
455.566	So when we started this
457.988	a couple of years ago now,
460.99	we've had a lot of people come up to us who said,
463.334	"""This is a very interesting but crazy idea,"
466.166	and certainly not something that you should
468	"engage with anytime soon."""
470.714	And of course, we're talking about drones, right,
472.857	a technology that's not only unpopular in the West
476.559	but one that has become a very, very unpleasant
478.507	fact of life for many living in poor countries,
481.372	especially those engaged in conflict.
484.183	So why are we doing this?
488.717	Well, we chose to do this one
491.501	not because it's easy,
493.287	but because it can have amazing impact.
496.122	Imagine one billion people being connected
498.947	to physical goods in the same way
501.342	that mobile telecommunications connected them
504.366	to information.
506.458	Imagine if the next big network we built in the world
510.198	was a network for the transportation of matter.
513.961	In the developing world, we would hope
516.363	to reach millions of people with better vaccines,
519.068	reach them with better medication.
520.952	It would give us an unfair advantage against battling
522.81	HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.
526.802	Over time, we would hope it would become
528.498	a new platform for economic transactions,
530.672	lifting millions of people out of poverty.
533.133	In the developed world and the emerging world,
535.343	we would hope it would become a new mode
536.811	of transportation that could help make our cities
540.532	more livable.
542.385	So for those that still believe
542.385	that this is science fiction,
545.728	I firmly say to you that it is not.
548.543	We do need to engage, though,
550.212	in social fiction to make it happen.
553.28	Thank you.
555.447	(Applause)
