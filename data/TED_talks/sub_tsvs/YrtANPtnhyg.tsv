15.26	We grew up
17.26	interacting with the physical
17.26	objects around us.
20.26	There are an enormous number of them
20.26	that we use every day.
24.553	Unlike most of our computing devices,
27.26	these objects are much more fun to use.
31.18	When you talk about objects,
33.26	one other thing automatically
33.26	comes attached to that thing,
36.26	and that is gestures:
38.26	how we manipulate these objects,
40.26	how we use these objects in everyday life.
43.26	We use gestures not only to interact
43.26	with these objects,
46.26	but we also use them
46.26	to interact with each other.
48.57	"A gesture of ""Namaste!"","
48.57	maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,
52.26	in India I don't need to teach
52.26	a kid that this means
54.713	"""four runs"" in cricket."
56.26	It comes as a part
56.26	of our everyday learning.
59.716	So, I am very interested,
59.716	from the beginning,
63.26	how our knowledge
63.26	about everyday objects and gestures,
67.26	and how we use these objects,
69.26	can be leveraged to our interactions
69.26	with the digital world.
72.26	Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,
75.26	why can I not use my computer
78.26	in the same way that I interact
78.26	in the physical world?
81.26	So, I started this exploration
81.26	around eight years back,
84.26	and it literally started
84.26	with a mouse on my desk.
87.26	Rather than using it for my computer,
87.26	I actually opened it.
93.26	Most of you might be aware
93.26	that, in those days,
95.475	the mouse used to come with a ball inside,
97.499	and there were two rollers
99.26	that actually guide the computer
99.26	where the ball is moving,
102.26	and, accordingly,
102.26	where the mouse is moving.
104.38	So, I was interested in these two rollers,
107.26	and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed
107.26	another mouse from a friend --
110.665	never returned to him --
112.26	and I now had four rollers.
114.26	Interestingly, what I did
114.26	with these rollers is,
117.26	basically, I took them off of these mouses
117.26	and then put them in one line.
122.26	It had some strings
122.26	and pulleys and some springs.
125.26	What I got is basically
125.26	a gesture-interface device
128.26	that actually acts
128.26	as a motion-sensing device
132.26	made for two dollars.
134.26	So, here, whatever movement
134.26	I do in my physical world
137.26	is actually replicated
137.26	inside the digital world
140.26	just using this small device
140.26	that I made, around eight years back,
143.38	in 2000.
145.26	Because I was interested
145.26	in integrating these two worlds,
147.951	I thought of sticky notes.
149.26	"I thought, ""Why can I not connect"
152.26	the normal interface
152.26	of a physical sticky note
154.427	"to the digital world?"""
156.26	A message written
156.26	on a sticky note to my mom,
158.432	on paper,
159.66	can come to an SMS,
161.26	or maybe a meeting reminder
163.26	automatically syncs
163.26	with my digital calendar --
165.475	a to-do list that automatically
165.475	syncs with you.
168.26	But you can also search
168.26	in the digital world,
171.26	or maybe you can write a query, saying,
173.26	"""What is Dr. Smith's address?"""
175.26	and this small system
175.26	actually prints it out --
177.475	so it actually acts like a paper
177.475	input-output system,
179.976	just made out of paper.
185.26	In another exploration,
187.26	I thought of making a pen
187.26	that can draw in three dimensions.
190.26	So, I implemented this pen
190.26	that can help designers and architects
194.26	not only think in three dimensions,
196.26	but they can actually draw,
198.26	so that it's more intuitive
198.26	to use that way.
200.332	Then I thought,
200.332	"""Why not make a Google Map,"
202.404	"but in the physical world?"""
204.26	Rather than typing a keyword
204.26	to find something,
207.26	I put my objects on top of it.
209.26	If I put a boarding pass, it will show me
209.26	where the flight gate is.
212.475	A coffee cup will show
212.475	where you can find more coffee,
215.26	or where you can trash the cup.
217.26	So, these were some
217.26	of the earlier explorations I did
220.26	because the goal was to connect
220.26	these two worlds seamlessly.
224.26	Among all these experiments,
226.26	there was one thing in common:
228.26	I was trying to bring
228.26	a part of the physical world
231.789	to the digital world.
233.311	I was taking some part of the objects,
235.26	or any of the intuitiveness of real life,
238.261	and bringing them to the digital world,
240.474	because the goal was to make
240.474	our computing interfaces more intuitive.
244.523	But then I realized that we humans
244.523	are not actually interested in computing.
249.26	What we are interested in is information.
252.26	We want to know about things.
254.26	We want to know about
254.26	dynamic things going around.
256.665	So I thought, around last year --
256.665	in the beginning of the last year --
261.26	"I started thinking, ""Why can I not take"
261.26	"this approach in the reverse way?"""
265.379	"Maybe, ""How about I take my digital world"
267.46	and paint the physical world
267.46	"with that digital information?"""
273.414	Because pixels are actually, right now,
273.414	confined in these rectangular devices
277.06	that fit in our pockets.
278.831	Why can I not remove this confine
281.26	and take that to my everyday
281.26	objects, everyday life
284.26	so that I don't need
284.26	to learn the new language
286.427	for interacting with those pixels?
289.474	So, in order to realize this dream,
292.26	I actually thought of putting
292.26	a big-size projector on my head.
295.26	I think that's why this is called
295.26	a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
298.523	I took it very literally,
300.26	and took my bike helmet,
302.26	put a little cut over there so that
302.26	the projector actually fits nicely.
305.665	So now, what I can do --
307.26	I can augment the world around me
307.26	with this digital information.
311.918	But later,
313.16	I realized that I actually
313.16	wanted to interact
315.343	with those digital pixels, also.
316.96	So I put a small camera over there
316.96	that acts as a digital eye.
320.26	Later, we moved to a much better,
322.26	consumer-oriented pendant version of that,
324.284	that many of you now know
324.284	as the SixthSense device.
327.26	But the most interesting thing
327.26	about this particular technology
330.26	is that you can carry
330.26	your digital world with you
334.26	wherever you go.
336.26	You can start using any surface,
336.26	any wall around you,
339.26	as an interface.
341.26	The camera is actually tracking
341.26	all your gestures.
344.26	Whatever you're doing with your hands,
346.26	it's understanding that gesture.
348.26	And, actually, if you see,
348.26	there are some color markers
350.86	that in the beginning version
350.86	we are using with it.
353.36	You can start painting on any wall.
355.26	You stop by a wall,
355.26	and start painting on that wall.
358.26	But we are not only tracking
358.26	one finger, here.
360.427	We are giving you the freedom
360.427	of using all of both of your hands,
364.26	so you can actually use both of your hands
364.26	to zoom into or zoom out
367.427	of a map just by pinching all present.
369.427	The camera is actually doing --
369.427	just, getting all the images --
373.26	is doing the edge recognition
373.26	and also the color recognition
376.26	and so many other small algorithms
376.26	are going on inside.
379.26	So, technically,
379.26	it's a little bit complex,
381.284	but it gives you an output which is more
381.284	intuitive to use, in some sense.
384.784	But I'm more excited that you can
384.784	actually take it outside.
387.66	Rather than getting your camera
387.66	out of your pocket,
390.26	you can just do the gesture
390.26	of taking a photo,
393.26	and it takes a photo for you.
395.26	(Applause)
399.26	Thank you.
400.859	And later I can find a wall, anywhere,
403.26	and start browsing those photos
405.26	"or maybe, ""OK, I want to modify"
405.26	this photo a little bit
407.96	"and send it as an email to a friend."""
409.97	So, we are looking for an era
412.26	where computing will actually merge
412.26	with the physical world.
415.26	And, of course,
415.26	if you don't have any surface,
418.26	you can start using your palm
418.26	for simple operations.
421.26	Here, I'm dialing a phone number
421.26	just using my hand.
427.14	The camera is actually not
427.14	only understanding your hand movements,
430.26	but, interestingly,
431.46	is also able to understand what objects
431.46	you are holding in your hand.
435.269	For example, in this case,
439.26	the book cover is matched
441.26	with so many thousands,
441.26	or maybe millions of books online,
444.26	and checking out which book it is.
446.26	Once it has that information,
447.76	it finds out more reviews about that,
449.66	or maybe New York Times
449.66	has a sound overview on that,
452.26	so you can actually hear,
452.26	on a physical book,
454.38	a review as sound.
456.26	(Video) Famous talk
456.26	at Harvard University --
458.46	This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.
462.26	(Video) And particularly I want
462.26	to thank two outstanding MIT --
465.749	Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing
465.749	the live [video] of his talk,
468.807	outside, on just a newspaper.
471.26	Your newspaper will show you
471.26	live weather information
474.26	rather than having it updated.
476.89	You have to check your computer
476.89	in order to do that, right?
479.761	(Applause)
484.26	When I'm going back,
484.26	I can just use my boarding pass
487.26	to check how much my flight
487.26	has been delayed,
489.38	because at that particular time,
491.26	I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,
493.26	and checking out a particular icon.
495.26	And I think this technology
495.26	will not only change the way --
498.418	(Laughter)
499.418	Yes.
500.46	It will change the way
500.46	we interact with people, also,
502.962	not only the physical world.
504.501	The fun part is, I'm going
504.501	to the Boston metro,
507.26	and playing a pong game inside the train
507.26	on the ground, right?
512.26	(Laughter)
513.36	And I think the imagination
513.36	is the only limit
515.48	of what you can think of
517.26	when this kind of technology
517.26	merges with real life.
519.76	But many of you argue, actually,
521.66	that all of our work is not
521.66	only about physical objects.
524.36	We actually do lots
524.36	of accounting and paper editing
527.36	and all those kinds of things;
527.36	what about that?
529.675	And many of you are excited
529.675	about the next-generation tablet computers
533.26	to come out in the market.
535.26	So, rather than waiting for that,
537.26	I actually made my own,
537.26	just using a piece of paper.
540.26	So, what I did here
540.26	is remove the camera --
542.284	All the webcam cameras have
542.284	a microphone inside the camera.
546.26	I removed the microphone from that,
549.26	and then just pinched that --
551.26	like I just made a clip
551.26	out of the microphone --
554.26	and clipped that to a piece of paper,
554.26	any paper that you found around.
558.26	So now the sound of the touch
561.26	is getting me when exactly
561.26	I'm touching the paper.
564.26	But the camera is actually tracking
564.26	where my fingers are moving.
568.26	You can of course watch movies.
571.26	(Video) Good afternoon.
571.26	My name is Russell,
574.26	and I am a Wilderness
574.26	"Explorer in Tribe 54."""
577.26	PM: And you can of course play games.
580.26	(Car engine)
583.26	Here, the camera is actually understanding
583.26	how you're holding the paper
586.618	and playing a car-racing game.
588.26	(Applause)
592.656	Many of you already must have
592.656	thought, OK, you can browse.
595.458	Yeah. Of course you can
595.458	browse to any websites
597.76	or you can do all sorts
597.76	of computing on a piece of paper
600.46	wherever you need it.
601.66	So, more interestingly,
604.26	I'm interested in how we can
604.26	take that in a more dynamic way.
607.26	When I come back to my desk,
607.26	I can just pinch that information
610.26	back to my desktop
612.26	so I can use my full-size computer.
615.26	(Applause)
617.26	And why only computers?
617.26	We can just play with papers.
620.26	Paper world is interesting to play with.
623.26	Here, I'm taking a part of a document,
625.26	and putting over here a second part
625.26	from a second place,
629.26	and I'm actually modifying the information
629.26	that I have over there.
634.26	"Yeah. And I say, ""OK, this looks nice,"
634.26	"let me print it out, that thing."""
639.26	So I now have a print-out of that thing.
641.665	So the workflow is more intuitive,
644.013	the way we used to do it
644.013	maybe 20 years back,
647.26	rather than now switching
647.26	between these two worlds.
650.26	So, as a last thought,
653.26	I think that integrating
653.26	information to everyday objects
657.66	will not only help us to get rid
657.66	of the digital divide,
661.26	the gap between these two worlds,
663.26	but will also help us, in some way,
665.26	to stay human,
667.26	to be more connected
667.26	to our physical world.
673.668	And it will actually help us
673.668	not end up being machines
676.26	sitting in front of other machines.
678.767	That's all. Thank you.
681.26	(Applause)
695.26	Thank you.
696.46	(Applause)
699.26	Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,
699.26	first of all, you're a genius.
703.26	This is incredible, really.
706.26	What are you doing with this?
706.26	Is there a company being planned?
709.384	Or is this research forever, or what?
711.26	Pranav Mistry: So, there are
711.26	lots of companies,
713.56	sponsor companies of Media Lab
713.56	interested in taking this ahead
716.58	in one or another way.
717.79	Companies like mobile-phone operators
719.787	want to take this in a different way
719.787	than the NGOs in India,
722.685	"thinking, ""Why can we only"
722.685	have 'Sixth Sense'?
724.885	We should have a 'Fifth Sense'
724.885	for missing-sense people who cannot speak.
728.36	This technology can be used for them
728.36	to speak out in a different way
731.675	"maybe a speaker system."""
732.975	CA: What are your own plans?
732.975	Are you staying at MIT,
735.46	or are you going to do
735.46	something with this?
737.56	PM: I'm trying to make this
737.56	more available to people
740.113	so that anyone can develop
740.113	their own SixthSense device,
742.813	because the hardware is actually
742.813	not that hard to manufacture
746.26	or hard to make your own.
748.26	We will provide all the open source
748.26	software for them,
750.856	maybe starting next month.
752.26	CA: Open source? Wow.
754.26	(Applause)
759.26	CA: Are you going to come back to India
759.26	with some of this, at some point?
762.713	PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
764.26	CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?
766.26	How are you going to split
766.26	your time going forward?
768.76	PM: There is a lot of energy here.
768.76	Lots of learning.
771.26	All of this work that you have seen
771.26	is all about my learning in India.
775.26	And now, if you see, it's more about
775.26	the cost-effectiveness:
778.26	this system costs you $300
780.26	compared to the $20,000 surface tables,
780.26	or anything like that.
783.26	Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system
783.26	at that time was costing around $5,000?
789.26	I showed that, at a conference,
789.26	to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,
795.26	"and then he said, ""OK, we should use this"
795.26	in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre
798.808	"for some use of that."""
800.26	So I'm excited about how I can bring
800.26	the technology to the masses
803.38	rather than just keeping that technology
803.38	in the lab environment.
806.404	(Applause)
810.26	CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,
812.402	I would say you're truly
812.402	one of the two or three
814.76	best inventors in the world right now.
816.66	It's an honor to have you at TED.
818.26	Thank you so much.
820.26	That's fantastic.
821.46	(Applause)
