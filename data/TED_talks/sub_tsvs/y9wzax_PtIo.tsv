12.486	I love paper, and I love technology,
16.57	and what I do is I make paper interactive.
19.901	And that's what I say when
19.901	people ask me what I do,
22.354	but it really confuses most people,
24.253	so really, the best way
24.253	for me to convey it
26.432	is to take the technology and be creative
29.444	and create experiences.
31.545	So I tried to think
31.545	what I could use for here,
33.797	and a couple of weeks
33.797	ago I had a crazy idea
35.917	that I wanted to print two DJ decks
39.73	and to try and mix some music.
42.214	And I'm going to try
42.214	and show that at the end,
44.429	and the suspense will be
44.429	as much mine if it works.
47.938	And I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,
50.604	so I'm a little bit scared of that.
53.327	So I think, I found the best
53.327	way to describe my journey
58.864	is just to mention a few little things
60.514	that have happened to me
60.514	throughout my life.
62.614	There's three particular
62.614	things that I've done,
64.896	and I'll just describe those first,
66.587	and then talk about some of my work.
68.606	So when I was a kid,
68.606	I was obsessed with wires,
71.835	and I used to thread them under my carpet
74.941	and thread them behind the walls
76.535	and have little switches
76.535	and little speakers,
78.856	and I wanted to make
78.856	my bedroom be interactive
81.572	but kind of all hidden away.
83.102	And I was also really
83.102	interested in wireless as well.
87.143	So I bought one of those
87.143	little kits that you could get
89.787	to make a radio transmitter,
91.372	and I got an old book
91.372	and I carved out the inside
94.637	and I hid it inside there,
96.507	and then I placed it next to my dad
98.914	and snuck back to my bedroom
98.914	and tuned in on the radio
102.992	so I could eavesdrop.
104.72	I was not at all interested
104.72	in what he was saying.
107.125	It's more that I just liked the idea
108.963	of an everyday object
110.477	having something inside
111.758	and doing something different.
115.16	Several year later,
116.826	I managed to successfully
116.826	fail all of my exams
120.049	and didn't really leave school
120.049	with much to show for at all,
124.774	and my parents, maybe as a reward,
128.332	bought me what turned out to be
130.192	a one-way ticket to Australia,
131.902	and I came back home
131.902	about four years later.
135.344	I ended up on a farm
135.344	in the middle of nowhere.
139.326	It was in far western New South Wales.
141.774	And this farm was 120,000 acres.
144.525	There were 22,000 sheep,
146.318	and it was about 40 degrees,
148.232	or 100 or so Fahrenheit.
150.886	And on this farm there
150.886	was the farmer, his wife,
153.92	and there was the four-year-old daughter.
156.631	And they kind of took me into the farm
159.253	and showed me what it
159.253	was like to live and work.
162.026	Obviously, one of the most important
162.026	things was the sheep,
164.812	and so my job was, well,
164.812	pretty much to do everything,
167.749	but it was about bringing
167.749	the sheep back to the homestead.
171.149	And we'd do that by building fences,
173.14	using motorbikes and horses,
175.694	and the sheep would make
175.694	their way all the way back
178.147	to the shearing shed
178.147	for the different seasons.
181.954	And what I learned was,
183.862	although at the time, like everyone else,
185.958	I thought sheep were pretty stupid
187.602	because they didn't do
187.602	what we wanted them to do,
189.31	what I realize now, probably
189.31	only just in the last few weeks
192.431	looking back, is the sheep
192.431	weren't stupid at all.
194.462	We'd put them in an environment
194.462	where they didn't want to be,
196.894	and they didn't want to do
196.894	what we wanted them to do.
199.442	So the challenge was to try and get them
201.856	to do what we wanted them to do
202.878	by listening to the weather,
202.878	the lay of the land,
205.969	and creating things
205.969	that would let the sheep flow
208.98	and go where we wanted them to go.
211.678	Another bunch of years later,
213.285	I ended up at Cambridge University
215.644	at the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.
217.826	doing a Ph.D. in physics.
219.54	My Ph.D. was to move electrons
219.54	around, one at a time.
224.564	And I realize — again, it's kind
224.564	of these realizations
227.22	looking back as to what I did —
229.419	I realize now that it
229.419	was pretty much the same
232.35	as moving sheep around.
234.187	It really is.
236.461	It's just you do it
236.461	by changing an environment.
239.317	And that's kind
239.317	of been a big lesson to me,
241.368	that you can't act on any object.
242.964	You change its environment,
242.964	and the object will flow.
245.512	So we made it very small,
247.554	so things were about 30
247.554	nanometers in size;
250.442	making it very cold, so
250.442	at liquid helium temperatures;
255.237	and changing environment
255.237	by changing the voltage,
258.297	and the electrons could
258.297	make flow around a loop
261.761	one at a time, on and off,
261.761	a little memory node.
264.398	And I wanted to go one step further,
266.334	and I wanted to move one electron on
268.517	and one electron off.
270.452	And I was told that I wouldn't
270.452	be able to do this,
273.314	which, you know, as we've heard
273.314	from other people,
275.328	that's the thing that makes you do it.
277.162	And I was determined, and I managed
277.162	to show that I could do that.
280.7	And a lot of that learning, I think,
282.439	came from being on that farm,
283.944	because when I was working on the farm,
285.969	we'd have to use what was around us,
287.997	we'd have to use the environment,
289.79	and there was no such thing
291.664	as something can't be done,
292.974	because you're in an environment where,
294.856	if you can't do what you need to do,
297.069	you can die, and, you know,
298.679	I had seen that sort of thing happen.
302.409	So now my obsession is printing,
305.019	and I'm really fascinated by the idea
307.836	of using conventional printing processes,
310.78	so the types of print
310.78	that are used to create
313.005	many of the things around us
314.363	to make paper and card interactive.
318.128	When I spoke to some printers
318.128	when I started doing this
320.249	and told them what I wanted to do,
321.893	which was to print
321.893	conductive inks onto paper,
324.119	they told me it couldn't be done,
325.715	again, that kind of favorite thing.
327.961	So I got about 10 credit cards and loans
332.667	and got myself very close
332.667	to bankruptcy, really,
336.165	and bought myself this
336.165	huge printing press,
338.258	which I had no idea how to use at all.
340.382	It was about five meters long,
341.913	and I covered myself
341.913	and the floor with ink
344.171	and made a massive mess,
344.171	but I learned to print.
347.459	And then I took it back to the printers
347.459	and showed them what I've done,
349.988	"and they were like, ""Of"
349.988	course you can do that.
352.203	Why didn't you come here
352.203	"in the first place?"""
354.407	That's always the case.
357.377	So what we do is we take
357.377	conventional printing presses,
361.164	we make conductive inks,
363.119	and run those through a press,
363.119	and basically
366.612	just letting hundreds
366.612	of thousands of electrons flow
369.964	through pieces of paper
371.335	so we can make that paper interactive.
373.324	And it's pretty simple, really.
374.825	It's just a collection of things
374.825	that have been done before,
377.688	but bringing them together
377.688	in a different way.
379.903	So we have a piece of paper
379.903	with conductive ink on,
382.527	and then add onto that a small circuit
382.527	board with a couple of chips,
387.14	one to run some capacitive touch software,
389.206	so we know where we've touched it,
390.85	and the other to run, quite often,
393.388	some wireless software so
393.388	the piece of paper can connect.
397.351	So I'll just describe a couple
397.351	of things that we've created.
400.758	There's lots of different
400.758	things we've created.
403.021	This is one of them, because I love cake.
405.462	And this one, it's a large poster,
408.154	and you touch it and it has
408.154	a little speaker behind it,
410.392	and the poster talks
410.392	to you when you touch it
412.63	and asks you a series of questions,
414.321	and it works out your perfect cake.
416.335	But it doesn't tell you
416.335	the cake there and then.
418.731	It uploads a picture,
420.329	and the reason why it
420.329	chose that cake for you,
422.727	to our Facebook page and to Twitter.
425.95	So we're trying to create that connection
428.777	between the physical and the digital,
430.563	but have it not looking on a screen,
432.601	and just looking like a regular poster.
435.724	We've worked with a bunch
435.724	of universities on a project
440.46	looking at interactive newsprint.
442.437	So for example, we've created a newspaper,
444.578	a regular newspaper.
445.893	You can wear a pair of headphones
445.893	that are connected to it wirelessly,
448.878	and when you touch it,
448.878	you can hear the music
451.045	that's described on the top,
451.045	which is something you can't read.
454.069	You can hear a press conference
456.235	as well as reading
456.235	what the editor has determined
458.779	that press conference was about.
460.327	"And you can press a Facebook ""like"" button"
462.464	or you can vote on something as well.
465.143	Something else that we created,
466.382	and this was an idea that I had
466.382	a couple of years ago,
468.646	and so we've done a project on this.
469.715	It was for funding from the government
471.756	for user-centered design
471.756	for energy-efficient buildings,
475.286	difficult to say, and something
475.286	I had no idea what it was
477.32	when I went into the workshop,
477.32	but quickly learned.
480.104	And we wanted to try and encourage people
482.267	to use energy better.
484.115	And I really liked the idea that,
484.115	instead of looking at dials
487.637	and reading things to say --
490.183	looking at your energy usage,
492.125	I wanted to create a poster
492.125	that was wirelessly connected
495.379	and had color-changing inks on it,
497.023	and so if your energy usage
497.023	was trending better,
500.599	than the leaves would appear
500.599	and the rabbits would appear
502.926	and all would be good.
504.312	And if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti
506.336	and the leaves would fall off the trees.
508.265	So it was trying to make
508.265	you look after something
510.755	in your immediate environment,
512.88	which you don't want to see
512.88	not looking so good,
515.369	rather than expecting people to do things
517.496	in the local environment
517.496	because of the effect
519.807	that it has a long way off.
521.286	And I think, kind of like going
521.286	back to the farm,
523.644	it's about how to let people
523.644	do what you want them to do
526.672	rather than making people do
526.672	what you want them to do.
531.089	Okay.
532.549	So this is the bit I'm really scared of.
535.371	So a couple of things I've created are,
537.61	there's a poster over here
539.027	that you can play drums on.
541.458	And I am not a musician. It seemed
541.458	like a good idea at the time.
546.205	If anyone wants to try
546.205	and play drums, then they can.
548.977	I'll just describe how this works.
550.621	This poster is wirelessly
550.621	connected to my cell phone,
554.615	and when you touch it,
554.615	it connects to the app.
557.491	(Drums)
565.778	And it has really good response time.
567.622	It's using Bluetooth 4, so
567.622	it's pretty instantaneous.
572.322	Okay. Thanks.
574.904	(Applause)
579.168	And there's a couple of other things.
580.954	So this one is like a sound board,
583.486	so you can touch it, and I just
583.486	love these horrible noises.
588.096	(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)
595.876	Okay, and this is a D.J. turntable.
598.685	So it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,
601.142	and this is a software
601.142	that's running on the iPad.
605.779	Oh, yes. I just love doing that.
609.403	I'm not a D.J., though, but I just
609.403	always wanted to do that.
612.427	(Scratching)
614.828	So I have a crossfader,
614.828	and I have the two decks.
619.721	So I've made some new technology,
622.076	and I love things being creative,
623.672	and I love working with creative people.
625.601	So my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,
628.273	and she's called Charlotte,
629.293	and I asked her to record something,
631.479	and I worked with a friend called Elliot
633.408	to put some beats together.
634.925	So this is my niece, Charlotte.
636.985	(Music)
670.273	Yay!
672.356	(Applause)
681.422	So that's pretty much what I do.
683.494	I just love bringing technology together,
685.15	having a lot of fun, being creative.
687.091	But it's not about the technology.
688.839	It's just about, I want to create
688.839	some great experiences.
691.703	So thank you very much.
693.103	(Applause)
