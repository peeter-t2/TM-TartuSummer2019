12.8	Let's go back to 1957.
18.68	Representatives
18.68	from six European countries
22.72	had come to Rome
24.48	to sign the treaty that was
24.48	to create the European Union.
29.84	Europe was destroyed.
32.56	A world war had emerged from Europe.
37.28	The human suffering was unbelievable
39.96	and unprecedented.
43.72	Those men
45.72	wanted to create a peaceful,
49.88	democratic Europe,
52.12	a Europe that works for its people.
55.76	And one of the many building blocks
58.6	in that peace project
60.88	was a common European market.
65.08	Already back then,
67.24	they saw how markets,
69.08	when left to themselves,
71.44	can sort of slip into being
71.44	just the private property
76.519	of big businesses and cartels,
80.36	meeting the needs of some businesses
83.52	and not the needs of customers.
87.84	So from our very first day,
90.68	in 1957,
93.36	the European Union had rules
96.24	to defend fair competition.
99.68	And that means competition on the merits,
103	that you compete
103	on the quality of your products,
106.24	the prices you can offer,
108.2	the services, the innovation
108.2	that you produce.
112.4	That's competition on the merits.
115.24	You have a fair chance
115.24	of making it on such a market.
119.32	And it's my job,
121.36	as Commissioner for Competition,
124.16	to make sure that companies
124.16	who do business in Europe
127.88	live by those rules.
132.36	But let's take a step back.
136.32	Why do we need rules
136.32	on competition at all?
140.88	Why not just let businesses compete?
144.6	Isn't that also the best for us
147.32	if they compete freely,
149.64	since more competition
151.92	drives more quality,
154.12	lower prices, more innovation?
159.08	Well, mostly it is.
163.52	But the problem is
163.52	that sometimes, for businesses,
168.32	competition can be inconvenient,
175.12	because competition means
175.12	that the race is never over,
179.76	the game is never won.
182.4	No matter how well
182.4	you were doing in the past,
185.08	there's always someone
186.92	who are out there
186.92	wanting to take your place.
192.36	So the temptation to avoid competition
195.56	is powerful.
198.32	It's rooted in motives
198.32	as old as Adam and Eve:
203.8	in greed for yet more money,
207.64	in fear of losing
207.64	your position in the market
211.12	and all the benefits it brings.
215.96	And when greed and fear
218.92	are linked to power,
220.8	you have a dangerous mix.
224.28	We see that in political life.
227.36	In part of the world,
229.24	the mix of greed and fear
231.64	means that those who get power
234.28	become reluctant to give it back.
240.92	One of the many things
242.48	I like and admire in our democracies
247.24	are the norms
249.08	that make our leaders hand over power
252.28	when voters tell them to.
256.72	And competition rules
256.72	can do a similar thing in the market,
260.92	making sure that greed and fear
260.92	doesn't overcome fairness.
267.6	Because those rules mean
269.16	that companies cannot misuse their power
269.16	to undermine competition.
276.04	Think for a moment about your car.
280.72	It has thousands of parts,
284.28	from the foam that makes the seats
287.68	to the electrical wiring
287.68	to the light bulbs.
291.68	And for many of those parts,
294	the world's carmakers,
295.6	they are dependent
295.6	on only a few suppliers.
301.12	So it's hardly surprising
303.68	that it is kind of tempting
303.68	for those suppliers
307.76	to come together and fix prices.
311.92	But just imagine what that could do
313.84	to the final price
313.84	of your new car in the market.
320.52	Except, it's not imaginary.
324.4	The European Commission
326.6	has dealt with already
326.6	seven different car parts cartels,
332.48	and we're still investigating some.
336.32	Here, the Department of Justice
339.52	are also looking
339.52	into the market for car parts,
342.92	and it has called it
342.92	the biggest criminal investigation
346.48	it has ever pursued.
349.32	But without competition rules,
351.76	there would be no investigation,
354.24	and there would be nothing
354.24	to stop this collusion from happening
358.16	and the prices of your car to go up.
363.6	Yet it's not only companies
365.96	who can undermine fair competition.
368.96	Governments can do it, too.
371.72	And governments do that
371.72	when they hand out subsidies
375.92	to just the favorite few, the selected.
381.24	They may do that
381.24	when they hand out subsidies --
384.32	and, of course,
384.32	all financed by taxpayers --
388.68	to companies.
390.76	That may be in the form
390.76	of special tax treatments,
395.72	like the tax benefits
397.16	that firms like Fiat,
397.16	Starbucks and Apple got
402.08	from some governments in Europe.
406.12	Those subsidies stop companies
406.12	from competing on equal terms.
411.24	They can mean that
411.24	the companies that succeed,
414.84	well, they are the companies
414.84	that got the most subsidy,
418.4	the ones that are the best-connected,
420.72	and not, as it should be,
422.88	the companies that serve
422.88	consumers the best.
427.56	So there are times when we need to step in
430.72	to make sure that competition
430.72	works the way it should.
435.16	By doing that, we help
435.16	the market to work fairly,
439.72	because competition gives consumers
439.72	the power to demand a fair deal.
445.84	It means that companies know
445.84	that if they cannot offer good prices
450.36	or the service that's expected,
452.96	well, the customers
452.96	will go somewhere else.
458.68	And that sort of fairness
458.68	is more important
461.36	than we may sometimes realize.
467.56	Very few people think
467.56	about politics all the time.
471.6	Some even skip it at election time.
475.88	But we are all in the market.
478.4	Every day, we are in the market.
482.28	And we don't want businesses
482.28	to agree on prices in the back office.
487.52	We don't want them
487.52	to divide the market between them.
491.64	We don't want one big company
493.56	just to shut out competitors
496.24	from ever showing us what they can do.
500.44	If that happens,
502.76	well, obviously, we feel
502.76	that someone has cheated us,
506.16	that we are being ignored
506.16	or taken for granted by the market.
511.68	And that may undermine
511.68	not only our trust in the market
515.28	but also our trust in the society.
519.68	In a recent survey,
521.64	more than two-thirds of Europeans
524.08	said that they had felt
524.08	the effects of lack of competition:
529.88	that the price
529.88	for electricity was too high,
533.28	that the price for the medicines
533.28	they needed was too high,
537.56	that they had no real choice
539.08	if they wanted to travel
539.08	by bus or by plane,
542.44	or they got poor service
542.44	from their internet provider.
546.24	In short, they found that the market
546.24	didn't treat them fairly.
551	And that might seem
551	like very small things,
556	but they can give you this sense
559.72	that the world isn't really fair.
563.72	And they see the market,
563.72	which was supposed to serve everyone,
568.6	become more like the private property
568.6	of a few powerful companies.
575.68	The market is not the society.
578.08	Our societies are, of course,
578.08	much, much more than the market.
583.72	But lack of trust in the market
586.4	can rub off on society
589.28	so we lose trust in our society as well.
595.48	And it may be the most important
595.48	thing we have, trust.
601.88	We can trust each other
601.88	if we are treated as equals.
608.08	If we are all to have the same chances,
612.52	well, we all have to follow
612.52	the same fundamental rules.
617.56	Of course, some people and some businesses
617.56	are more successful than others,
623.36	but we do not trust in a society
626	if the prizes are handed out
628.08	even before the contest begins.
633.28	And this is where
633.28	competition rules come in,
637.16	because when we make sure
637.16	that markets work fairly,
640.68	then businesses compete on the merits,
643.92	and that helps to build the trust
643.92	that we need as citizens
649.2	to feel comfortable and in control,
652.88	and the trust that allows
652.88	our society to work.
658	Because without trust,
658	everything becomes harder.
662.64	Just to live our daily lives,
662.64	we need to trust in strangers,
667	to trust the banks who keep our money,
670.8	the builders who build our home,
674.2	the electrician
674.2	who comes to fix the wiring,
677.28	the doctor who treats us when we're ill,
679.64	not to mention
679.64	the other drivers on the road,
682.48	and everyone knows that they are crazy.
686	And yet, we have to trust them
689.12	to do the right thing.
692.12	And the thing is
692.12	that the more our societies grow,
696.88	the more important trust becomes
699.92	and the harder it is to build.
703.24	And that is a paradox of modern societies.
708.96	And this is especially true
711.32	when technology changes
711.32	the way that we interact.
715.84	Of course, to some degree,
715.84	technology can help us
718.2	to build trust in one another
718.2	with ratings systems and other systems
722.56	that enable the sharing economy.
726.36	But technology also creates
726.36	completely new challenges
730.16	when they ask us
730.16	not to trust in other people
734.12	but to trust in algorithms and computers.
739.92	Of course, we all see
739.92	and share and appreciate
743.8	all the good that
743.8	new technology can do us.
747.8	It's a lot of good.
750.24	Autonomous cars can give people
750.24	with disabilities new independence.
755.4	It can save us all time,
756.84	and it can make a much, much
756.84	better use of resources.
761.24	Algorithms that rely on crunching
761.24	enormous amounts of data
766.2	can enable our doctors
766.2	to give us a much better treatment,
770.28	and many other things.
774.44	But no one is going
774.44	to hand over their medical data
779.72	or step into a car
779.72	that's driven by an algorithm
783.88	unless they trust the companies
783.88	that they are dealing with.
789.56	And that trust isn't always there.
793.24	Today, for example,
793.24	less than a quarter of Europeans
797.44	trust online businesses
797.44	to protect their personal information.
804.72	But what if people knew
807.44	that they could rely
807.44	on technology companies
810.8	to treat them fairly?
814.28	What if they knew that those companies
816.72	respond to competition
816.72	by trying to do better,
821.4	by trying to serve consumers better,
825.12	not by using their power
827.48	to shut out competitors,
829.88	say, by pushing their services
832.28	far, far down the list of search results
836.04	and promoting themselves?
839.92	What if they knew
839.92	that compliance with the rules
844.2	was built into the algorithms by design,
849.08	that the algorithm had to go
849.08	to competition rules school
852	before they were ever allowed to work,
856.12	that those algorithms were designed
858.88	in a way that meant
858.88	that they couldn't collude,
862.52	that they couldn't form
862.52	their own little cartel
865.56	in the black box they're working in?
869.48	Together with regulation,
872.28	competition rules can do that.
875.24	They can help us to make sure
877.04	that new technology treats people fairly
881.68	and that everyone can compete
881.68	on a level playing field.
886.8	And that can help us build the trust
890.08	that we need for real innovation
892.52	to flourish
893.84	and for societies to develop for citizens.
899.92	Because trust cannot be imposed.
903	It has to be earned.
906.28	Since the very first days
906.28	of the European Union,
912.8	our competition rules have helped
915.76	to build that trust.
919.12	A lot of things have changed.
922.44	It's hard to say
922.44	what those six representatives
925.8	would have made of a smartphone.
929	But in today's world,
930.64	as well as in their world,
933.28	competition makes the market
933.28	work for everyone.
938	And that is why I am convinced
940.28	that real and fair competition
943.48	has a vital role to play
945.56	in building the trust we need
947.76	to get the best of our societies,
952	and that starts with enforcing our rules,
957	actually just to make
957	the market work for everyone.
960.84	Thank you.
962.24	(Applause)
967.76	Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
971.36	Thank you, Commissioner.
972.64	Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure.
974.52	BG: I want to ask you two questions.
976.28	The first one is about data,
976.28	because I have the impression
979.04	that technology and data are changing
979.04	the way competition takes place
982.48	and the way competition regulation
982.48	is designed and enforced.
987.16	Can you maybe comment on that?
988.84	MV: Well, yes, it is
988.84	definitely challenging us,
992.2	because we both have to sharpen our tools
995.44	but also to develop new tools.
998.12	When we were going through
998.12	the Google responses
1001	to our statement of objection,
1003.76	we were going through
1003.76	5.2 terabytes of data.
1009.08	It's quite a lot.
1011.32	So we had to set up new systems.
1014.64	We had to figure out how to do this,
1017.28	because you cannot work
1017.28	the way you did just a few years ago.
1021.4	So we are definitely
1021.4	sharpening up our working methods.
1025.88	The other thing is
1025.88	that we try to distinguish
1028.04	between different kinds of data,
1029.76	because some data is extremely valuable
1032.36	and they will form, like,
1032.36	a barrier to entry in a market.
1035.64	Other things you can just --
1035.64	it loses its value tomorrow.
1040.56	So we try to make sure
1042.119	that we never, ever underestimate the fact
1045.599	that data works
1045.599	as a currency in the market
1049.599	and as an asset that can be
1049.599	a real barrier for competition.
1055.56	BG: Google. You fined them
1055.56	2.8 billion euros a few months ago.
1060.119	MV: No, that was dollars.
1060.119	It's not so strong these days.
1062.8	BG: Ah, well, depends on the --
1064.32	(Laughter)
1065.36	Google appealed the case.
1065.36	The case is going to court.
1067.88	It will last a while.
1070.24	Earlier, last year, you asked Apple
1070.24	to pay 13 billion in back taxes,
1075	and you have also
1075	investigated other companies,
1078.16	including European and Russian companies,
1080.24	not only American companies, by far.
1082.36	Yet the investigations
1082.36	against the American companies
1086.68	are the ones that have attracted
1086.68	the most attention
1089.12	and they have also attracted
1089.12	some accusations.
1092.16	You have been accused, essentially,
1092.16	of protectionism, of jealousy,
1095.32	or using legislation
1095.32	to hit back at American companies
1098.24	that have conquered European markets.
1100.56	"""The Economist"" just this week"
1100.56	on the front page writes,
1104.04	"""Vestager Versus The Valley."""
1105.96	How do you react to that?
1108.6	MV: Well, first of all,
1108.6	I take it very seriously,
1111.84	because bias has no room
1111.84	in law enforcement.
1118.16	We have to prove our cases
1118.16	with the evidence and the facts
1121.36	and the jurisprudence
1123.4	in order also to present it to the courts.
1126.76	The second thing is
1126.76	that Europe is open for business,
1130.72	but not for tax evasion.
1132.48	(Applause)
1138.8	The thing is that we are changing,
1142.56	and for instance,
1142.56	when I ask my daughters --
1144.8	they use Google as well --
1146.36	"""Why do you do that?"""
1147.88	"They say, ""Well, because it works."
1147.88	"It's a very good product."""
1150.88	They would never, ever,
1150.88	come up with the answer,
1153.36	"""It's because it's a US product."""
1155.96	It's just because it works.
1157.84	And that is of course how it should be.
1159.92	But just the same, it is important
1159.92	that someone is looking after to say,
1163.36	"""Well, we congratulate you"
1165.72	while you grow and grow and grow,
1168.28	but congratulation stops
1170.04	if we find that you're
1170.04	misusing your position
1174	to harm competitors
1174	"so that they cannot serve consumers."""
1178.24	BG: It will be
1178.24	a fascinating case to follow.
1180.36	Thank you for coming to TED.
1181.76	MV: It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot.
1183.52	(Applause)
