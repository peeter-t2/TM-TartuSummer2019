12.946	I'm here to show you
14.67	how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.
18.371	You're about to experience a new, available
22.174	and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink
25.154	how we waterproof our lives.
27.282	What I have here is a cinder block
30.002	that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray
32.498	that can be applied to almost any material.
35.09	It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,
37.427	and when you apply it to any material,
39.853	it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
42.958	So this is a cinder block, uncoated,
45.484	and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.
49.785	Not anymore.
52.439	Porous, nonporous.
56.666	So what's superhydrophobic?
59.418	Superhydrophobic is how we measure
61.911	a drop of water on a surface.
64.393	The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,
66.793	and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.
69.721	A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump
72.667	to about 90 degrees.
75.607	A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
78.695	But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,
81.476	and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
85.488	So as part of the demonstration,
87.037	what I have is a pair of gloves,
89.551	and we've coated one of the gloves
91.719	with the nanotechnology coating,
94.423	and let's see if you can tell which one,
96.223	and I'll give you a hint.
103.28	Did you guess the one that was dry?
107.904	When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,
112.606	what's occurred is that we're able to now
115.278	look at atoms and molecules and actually control them
117.791	for great benefits.
120.223	And we're talking really small here.
122.222	The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,
124.494	and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,
128.321	and to put some scale to that,
129.968	if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,
133.274	and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,
136.089	you'd be the width of a human hair.
138.937	So very small, but very useful.
141.945	And it's not just water that this works with.
144.849	It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,
147.6	water-based paint,
149.769	mud,
151.417	and also some refined oils as well.
159.216	You can see the difference.
163.605	Moving onto the next demonstration,
165.095	we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,
167.389	we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,
170.639	and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,
174.414	and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass
176.375	like you'd normally think it would,
177.925	except when it hits the coating, it stops,
181.519	and I can't even coax it to leave.
185.304	It's that afraid of the water.
186.907	(Applause)
190.627	So what's going on here? What's happening?
192.379	Well, the surface of the spray coating
195.667	is actually filled with nanoparticles
197.428	that form a very rough and craggly surface.
199.502	You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
202.091	And it has billions of interstitial spaces,
204.862	and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,
207.971	reach up and grab the air molecules,
210.323	and cover the surface with air.
212.386	It's an umbrella of air all across it,
215.131	and that layer of air is what the water hits,
217.771	the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
220.819	So if I put this inside this water here,
222.835	you can see a silver reflective coating around it,
226.955	and that silver reflective coating
228.411	is the layer of air that's protecting the water
230.682	from touching the paddle, and it's dry.
237.34	So what are the applications?
239.837	I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
242.285	Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,
243.783	"""Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."""
245.712	The applications in a general sense
247.774	could be anything that's anti-wetting.
250.604	We've certainly seen that today.
252.869	It could be anything that's anti-icing,
255.453	because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.
258.908	It could be anti-corrosion.
261.18	No water, no corrosion.
263.206	It could be anti-bacterial.
265.404	Without water, the bacteria won't survive.
268.113	And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
273.629	So imagine how something like this
277.501	could help revolutionize your field of work.
281.622	And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,
284.021	but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,
286.622	and think small.
297.098	(Applause)
304.646	It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.
309.035	Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter)
313.817	[Two minutes later...]
315.567	He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
318.251	It's happening!
320.814	(Applause)
