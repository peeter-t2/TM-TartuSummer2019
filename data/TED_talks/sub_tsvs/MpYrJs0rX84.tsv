15.26	So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo
18.319	and Mpumalanga, a little town called Motetema.
21.328	Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable
23.881	as the weather, and growing up in these tough situations,
28.15	at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends
31.673	of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.
34.219	The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.
37.408	So as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says,
40.592	"""Man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can"
43.641	"just put on your skin and then you don't have to bathe?"""
47.375	"And I sat, and I was like, ""Man, I would buy that, eh?"""
51.286	So I went home, and I did a little research,
54.821	and I found some very shocking statistics.
58.253	Over 2.5 billion people in the world today
61.27	do not have proper access to water and sanitation.
64.271	Four hundred and fifty million of them are in Africa,
66.394	and five million of them are in South Africa.
69.161	Various diseases thrive in this environment,
71.701	the most drastic of which is called trachoma.
75.048	Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt
77.849	getting into your eye. Multiple infections of trachoma
81.158	can leave you permanently blind.
83.842	The disease leaves eight million people permanently blind
87.575	each and every year. The shocking part about it
90.32	is that to avoid being infected with trachoma,
93.017	all you have to do is wash your face:
94.89	no medicine, no pills, no injections.
97.703	So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself,
100.606	"""Okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself"
102.958	and the fact that I don't want to bathe, I at least need
105.671	"to do it to try to save the world."" (Laughter)"
108.311	So with my trusty little steed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone --
113.264	I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have Internet much,
116.119	except for the 20-rand-an-hour Internet cafe —
119.064	I did research on Wikipedia, on Google, about lotions,
122.105	creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities --
125.842	I did high school science --
127.37	and I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper,
131.108	and it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?
134.48	So I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready.
136.969	Now we need to get this thing into practice.
139.718	Fast forward four years later, after having written
143.714	a 40-page business plan on the cell phone,
146.298	having written my patent on the cell phone,
148.397	I'm the youngest patent-holder in the country,
151.09	"and — (""No more bathing!"") —"
153.991	I can't say any more than that. (Laughter)
156.596	I had invented DryBath, the world's first
160.338	bath-substituting lotion.
163.124	You literally put it on your skin, and you don't have to bathe.
167.457	(Laughter)
171.842	So after having tried to make it work in high school
174.531	with the limited resources I had, I went to university,
178.048	met a few people, got it into practice,
180.751	and we have a fully functioning product that's ready
183.803	to go to the market. It's actually available on the market.
186.6	So we learned a few lessons in commercializing
189.526	and making DryBath available.
191.953	One of the things we learned was that poor communities
194.309	don't buy products in bulk.
196.569	They buy products on demand. A person in Alex
199.046	doesn't buy a box of cigarettes. They buy one cigarette
201.44	each day, even though it's more expensive.
203.85	So we packaged DryBath in these innovative little sachets.
206.496	You just snap them in half, and you squeeze it out.
209.386	And the cool part is, one sachet substitutes one bath
213.073	for five rand.
215.283	After creating that model, we also learned a lot
217.975	in terms of implementing the product.
219.716	We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs
222.034	really want DryBath. (Laughter)
224.222	At least once a week.
226.405	Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters
229.017	of water on average each time they skipped a bath,
232.148	and also we would save two hours a day for kids
235.083	who are in rural areas, two hours more for school,
238.149	two hours more for homework,
239.933	two hours more to just be a kid.
242.781	After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down
245.428	to our key value proposition,
247.792	which was cleanliness and convenience.
250.035	DryBath is a rich man's convenience
252.667	and a poor man's lifesaver.
255.037	Having put the product into practice, we are actually now
258.509	on the verge of selling the product
260.553	onto a multinational to take it to the retail market,
263.666	and one question I have for the audience today is,
267.191	on the gravel roads of Limpopo,
269.464	with an allowance of 50 rand a week,
272.813	I came up with a way for the world not to bathe.
276.635	What's stopping you? (Applause)
279.343	I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet.
282.289	And another key thing that I learned a lot
285.354	throughout this whole process,
286.702	last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.
290.787	I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur
293.656	in the world, the first African to get that accolade,
296.412	and one thing that really puzzles me is, I did all of this
301.407	just because I didn't want to bathe. Thank you.
305.043	(Applause.)
