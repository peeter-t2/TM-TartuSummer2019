12.782	Imagine you're in Rome,
14.711	and you've made your way
14.711	to the Vatican Museums.
18.301	And you've been shuffling
18.301	down long corridors,
21.568	past statues, frescoes,
21.568	lots and lots of stuff.
26.38	You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.
28.749	At last -- a long corridor,
28.749	a stair and a door.
34.149	You're at the threshold
34.149	of the Sistine Chapel.
37.171	So what are you expecting?
38.959	Soaring domes? Choirs of angels?
41.507	We don't really have any of that there.
44.109	Instead, you may ask yourself,
44.109	what do we have?
48.022	Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
50.67	And I mean literally, you're surrounded
50.67	by painted curtains,
53.649	the original decoration of this chapel.
56.088	Churches used tapestries not just
56.088	to keep out cold during long masses,
60.656	but as a way to represent
60.656	the great theater of life.
64.631	The human drama in which each one of us
64.631	plays a part is a great story,
69.786	a story that encompasses the whole world
72.619	and that came to unfold
72.619	in the three stages
75.708	of the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
78.382	Now, this building started out
78.382	as a space for a small group
81.767	of wealthy, educated Christian priests.
84.528	They prayed there.
84.528	They elected their pope there.
87.229	Five hundred years ago,
88.405	it was the ultimate
88.405	ecclesiastical man cave.
91.548	So, you may ask, how can it be
91.548	that today it attracts and delights
97.443	five million people a year,
100.133	from all different backgrounds?
102.396	Because in that compressed space,
102.396	there was a creative explosion,
106.956	ignited by the electric excitement
106.956	of new geopolitical frontiers,
111.812	which set on fire the ancient
111.812	missionary tradition of the Church
116.131	and produced one of the greatest
116.131	works of art in history.
120.064	Now, this development took place
120.064	as a great evolution,
124.602	moving from the beginning of a few elite,
127.361	and eventually able to speak
127.361	to audiences of people
130.816	that come from all over the world.
133.222	This evolution took place in three stages,
136	each one linked
136	to a historical circumstance.
139.135	The first one was rather limited in scope.
141.19	It reflected the rather
141.19	parochial perspective.
144.096	The second one took place after
144.096	worldviews were dramatically altered
148.374	after Columbus's historical voyage;
151.089	and the third,
152.52	when the Age of Discovery
152.52	was well under way
155.52	and the Church rose to the challenge
158.053	of going global.
160.33	The original decoration of this church
160.33	reflected a smaller world.
164.366	There were busy scenes
165.704	that told the stories of the lives
165.704	of Jesus and Moses,
169.585	reflecting the development
169.585	of the Jewish and Christian people.
173.646	The man who commissioned this,
173.646	Pope Sixtus IV,
176.007	assembled a dream team of Florentine art,
179.35	including men like Sandro Botticelli
182.273	and the man who would become
182.273	Michelangelo's future painting teacher,
185.874	Ghirlandaio.
187.436	These men, they blanketed the walls
187.436	with a frieze of pure color,
192.805	and in these stories you'll notice
192.805	familiar landscapes,
196.13	the artists using Roman monuments
196.13	or a Tuscan landscape
200.02	to render a faraway story,
200.02	something much more familiar.
203.472	With the addition of images
203.472	of the Pope's friends and family,
207.141	this was a perfect decoration
207.141	for a small court
209.998	limited to the European continent.
212.244	But in 1492, the New World was discovered,
217.138	horizons were expanding,
219.106	and this little 133 by 46-foot
219.106	microcosm had to expand as well.
225.486	And it did,
226.83	thanks to a creative genius,
228.806	a visionary and an awesome story.
232.208	Now, the creative genius
232.208	was Michelangelo Buonarroti,
	to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,
239.195	and the deck was stacked against him --
241.1	he had trained in painting
241.1	but had left to pursue sculpture.
244.02	There were angry patrons in Florence
244.02	because he had left a stack
247.502	of incomplete commissions,
249.2	lured to Rome by the prospect
249.2	of a great sculptural project,
252.887	and that project had fallen through.
255.492	And he had been left with a commission
255.492	to paint 12 apostles
258.645	against a decorative background
258.645	in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,
261.59	which would look like
261.59	every other ceiling in Italy.
265.615	But genius rose to the challenge.
267.47	In an age when a man dared
267.47	to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,
270.992	Michelangelo dared to chart
270.992	new artistic waters.
275.027	He, too, would tell a story --
277.287	no Apostles -- but a story
277.287	of great beginnings,
280.843	the story of Genesis.
283.087	Not really an easy sell,
283.087	stories on a ceiling.
286.042	How would you be able to read
286.042	a busy scene from 62 feet below?
290.874	The painting technique that had been
290.874	handed on for 200 years
293.753	in Florentine studios was not equipped
293.753	for this kind of a narrative.
297.694	But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,
300.686	and so he played to his strengths.
302.994	Instead of being accustomed
302.994	to filling space with busyness,
306.5	he took a hammer and chisel
306.5	and hacked away at a piece of marble
310.323	to reveal the figure within.
312.777	Michelangelo was an essentialist;
314.969	he would tell his story
314.969	in massive, dynamic bodies.
319.379	This plan was embraced
319.379	by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,
324.17	a man who was unafraid
324.17	of Michelangelo's brazen genius.
327.815	He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,
329.721	and he had been steeped in art
329.721	for 30 years and he knew its power.
333.852	And history has handed down the moniker
333.852	of the Warrior Pope,
336.94	but this man's legacy to the Vatican --
336.94	it wasn't fortresses and artillery,
340.754	it was art.
342.094	He left us the Raphael Rooms,
342.094	the Sistine Chapel.
344.697	He left St. Peter's Basilica
346.366	as well as an extraordinary collection
346.366	of Greco-Roman sculptures --
352.093	decidedly un-Christian works
352.093	that would become the seedbed
356.257	of the world's first modern museum,
356.257	the Vatican Museums.
360.847	Julius was a man
362.295	who envisioned a Vatican
362.295	that would be eternally relevant
366.103	through grandeur and through beauty,
368.216	and he was right.
369.612	The encounter between these two giants,
369.612	Michelangelo and Julius II,
374.624	that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
377.641	Michelangelo was so committed
377.641	to this project,
380.452	that he succeeded in getting the job done
380.452	in three and a half years,
384.859	using a skeleton crew and spending
384.859	most of the time, hours on end,
389.152	reaching up above his head
389.152	to paint the stories on the ceiling.
393.424	So let's look at this ceiling
395.498	and see storytelling gone global.
398.353	No more familiar artistic references
398.353	to the world around you.
402.789	There's just space
402.789	and structure and energy;
407.456	a monumental painted framework
407.456	which opens onto nine panels,
412.077	more driven by sculptural form
412.077	than painterly color.
416.034	And we stand in the far end
416.034	by the entrance,
419.835	far from the altar and from the gated
419.835	enclosure intended for the clergy
423.965	and we peer into the distance,
423.965	looking for a beginning.
429.236	And whether in scientific inquiry
429.236	or in biblical tradition,
433.276	we think in terms of a primal spark.
436.62	Michelangelo gave us an initial energy
438.777	when he gave us the separation
438.777	of light and dark,
441.542	a churning figure blurry in the distance,
444.955	compressed into a tight space.
447.463	The next figure looms larger,
449.816	and you see a figure hurtling
449.816	from one side to the next.
453.267	He leaves in his wake
453.267	the sun, the moon, vegetation.
458.277	Michelangelo didn't focus
458.277	on the stuff that was being created,
462.308	unlike all the other artists.
464.376	He focused on the act of creation.
467.743	And then the movement stops,
467.743	like a caesura in poetry
472.141	and the creator hovers.
473.417	So what's he doing?
474.72	Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
477.599	Or is he looking back over his handiwork,
477.599	the universe and his treasures,
482.314	just like Michelangelo must have,
484.069	looking back over his work in the ceiling
486.69	"and proclaiming, ""It is good."""
490.388	So now the scene is set,
492.517	and you get to the culmination
492.517	of creation, which is man.
496.219	Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure
496.219	against a dark background.
500.573	But looking closer,
502.355	that leg is pretty languid on the ground,
505.031	the arm is heavy on the knee.
507.345	Adam lacks that interior spark
511.046	that will impel him to greatness.
513.358	That spark is about to be conferred
513.358	by the creator in that finger,
518.147	which is one millimeter
518.147	from the hand of Adam.
520.842	It puts us at the edge of our seats,
522.811	because we're one moment
522.811	from that contact,
525.85	through which that man
525.85	will discover his purpose,
528.775	leap up and take his place
528.775	at the pinnacle of creation.
531.783	And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
535.068	Who is in that other arm?
537.531	Eve, first woman.
539.251	No, she's not an afterthought.
539.251	She's part of the plan.
542.184	She's always been in his mind.
544.681	Look at her, so intimate with God
544.681	that her hand curls around his arm.
549.329	And for me, an American art historian
549.329	from the 21st century,
554.761	this was the moment
554.761	that the painting spoke to me.
557.637	Because I realized that this
557.637	representation of the human drama
561.009	was always about men and women --
563.946	so much so, that the dead center,
563.946	the heart of the ceiling,
567.76	is the creation of woman, not Adam.
570.198	And the fact is, that when you see them
570.198	together in the Garden of Eden,
574.146	they fall together
575.707	and together their proud posture
575.707	turns into folded shame.
580.647	You are at critical juncture
580.647	now in the ceiling.
583.34	You are exactly at the point
583.34	where you and I can go
586.447	no further into the church.
587.926	The gated enclosure keeps us
587.926	out of the inner sanctum,
591.306	and we are cast out
591.306	much like Adam and Eve.
593.843	The remaining scenes in the ceiling,
595.623	they mirror the crowded chaos
595.623	of the world around us.
598.491	You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.
600.739	You have Noah. He's making a sacrifice
600.739	and a covenant with God.
604.353	Maybe he's the savior.
606.031	Oh, but no, Noah is the one
606.031	who grew grapes, invented wine,
609.787	got drunk and passed out
609.787	naked in his barn.
612.385	It is a curious way to design the ceiling,
614.783	now starting out with God creating life,
616.731	ending up with some guy
616.731	blind drunk in a barn.
619.25	And so, compared with Adam,
621.73	you might think Michelangelo
621.73	is making fun of us.
624.693	But he's about to dispel the gloom
626.76	by using those bright colors
626.76	right underneath Noah:
630.302	emerald, topaz, scarlet
630.302	on the prophet Zechariah.
633.716	Zechariah foresees a light
633.716	coming from the east,
636.719	and we are turned at this juncture
636.719	to a new destination,
640.431	with sibyls and prophets
640.431	who will lead us on a parade.
644.33	You have the heroes and heroines
644.33	who make safe the way,
647.652	and we follow the mothers and fathers.
650.16	They are the motors of this great
650.16	human engine, driving it forward.
654.269	And now we're at the keystone
654.269	of the ceiling,
657.2	the culmination of the whole thing,
659.403	with a figure that looks like
659.403	he's about to fall out of his space
662.657	into our space,
664.021	encroaching our space.
665.328	This is the most important juncture.
667.893	Past meets present.
669.789	This figure, Jonah, who spent
669.789	three days in the belly of the whale,
673.029	for the Christians, is the symbol
673.029	of the renewal of humanity
675.906	through Jesus' sacrifice,
677.193	but for the multitudes
677.193	of visitors to that museum
679.965	from all faiths who visit there every day,
682.759	he is the moment the distant past
682.759	encounters and meets immediate reality.
690.091	All of this brings us to the yawning
690.091	archway of the altar wall,
694.708	where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,
697.495	painted in 1534 after the world
697.495	had changed again.
701.385	The Reformation had splintered the Church,
703.433	the Ottoman Empire had made
703.433	Islam a household word
706.325	and Magellan had found a route
706.325	into the Pacific Ocean.
709.843	How is a 59-year-old artist who has never
709.843	been any further than Venice
714.529	going to speak to this new world?
716.747	Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,
719.814	that universal desire,
721.658	common to all of us,
723.302	to leave a legacy of excellence.
726.495	Told in terms of the Christian vision
726.495	of the Last Judgment,
729.45	the end of the world,
730.786	Michelangelo gave you a series of figures
733.948	who are wearing these
733.948	strikingly beautiful bodies.
737.127	They have no more covers,
737.127	no more portraits
739.873	except for a couple.
741.134	It's a composition only out of bodies,
747.286	unique like each and every one of us.
749.764	They start in the lower corner,
749.764	breaking away from the ground,
753.53	struggling and trying to rise.
756.276	Those who have risen
756.276	reach back to help others,
758.756	and in one amazing vignette,
760.617	you have a black man and a white man
760.617	pulled up together
763.733	in an incredible vision of human unity
766.479	in this new world.
767.945	The lion's share of the space
767.945	goes to the winner's circle.
771.476	There you find men and women
771.476	completely nude like athletes.
776.336	They are the ones
776.336	who have overcome adversity,
778.672	and Michelangelo's vision
778.672	of people who combat adversity,
782.41	overcome obstacles --
783.708	they're just like athletes.
785.626	So you have men and women
785.626	flexing and posing
789.079	in this extraordinary spotlight.
791.555	Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,
794.124	first a suffering man on the cross,
796.166	now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
798.594	And as Michelangelo
798.594	proved in his painting,
801.636	hardship, setbacks and obstacles,
804.238	they don't limit excellence,
804.238	they forge it.
808.276	Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.
810.888	This is the Pope's private chapel,
812.729	and the best way you can describe that
812.729	is indeed a stew of nudes.
815.91	But Michelangelo was trying to use
815.91	only the best artistic language,
819.697	the most universal artistic language
819.697	he could think of:
822.309	that of the human body.
824.093	And so instead of the way of showing
824.093	virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,
829.923	he borrowed from Julius II's
829.923	wonderful collection of sculptures
834.212	in order to show inner strength
834.212	as external power.
839.368	Now, one contemporary did write
842.757	that the chapel was too beautiful
842.757	to not cause controversy.
846.639	And so it did.
848.012	Michelangelo soon found
848.012	that thanks to the printing press,
851.574	complaints about the nudity
851.574	spread all over the place,
854.72	and soon his masterpiece of human drama
854.72	was labeled pornography,
859.04	at which point he added
859.04	two more portraits,
861.239	one of the man who criticized him,
861.239	a papal courtier,
863.747	and the other one of himself
863.747	as a dried up husk, no athlete,
867.903	in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
870.348	The year he died he saw
870.348	several of these figures covered over,
874.04	a triumph for trivial distractions
874.04	over his great exhortation to glory.
880.167	And so now we stand
881.955	in the here and now.
883.709	We are caught in that space
886.053	between beginnings and endings,
888.342	in the great, huge totality
888.342	of the human experience.
892.598	The Sistine Chapel forces us
892.598	to look around as if it were a mirror.
896.593	Who am I in this picture?
897.914	Am I one of the crowd?
899.244	Am I the drunk guy?
900.641	Am I the athlete?
902.121	And as we leave this haven
902.121	of uplifting beauty,
904.405	we are inspired to ask ourselves
904.405	life's biggest questions:
908.373	Who am I, and what role do I play
908.373	in this great theater of life?
913.549	Thank you.
914.744	(Applause)
918.216	Bruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
921.211	Elizabeth, you mentioned
921.211	this whole issue of pornography,
925.091	too many nudes and too many
925.091	daily life scenes and improper things
930.555	in the eyes of the time.
932.444	But actually the story is bigger.
934.074	It's not just touching up
934.074	and covering up some of the figures.
937.118	This work of art was almost
937.118	destroyed because of that.
940.383	Elizabeth Lev: The effect
940.383	of the Last Judgment was enormous.
943.432	The printing press made sure
943.432	that everybody saw it.
946.406	And so, this wasn't something
946.406	that happened within a couple of weeks.
949.715	It was something that happened
949.715	over the space of 20 years
954.207	of editorials and complaints,
956.155	saying to the Church,
957.347	"""You can't possibly tell us"
957.347	how to live our lives.
959.946	Did you notice you have
959.946	"pornography in the Pope's chapel?"""
963.31	And so after complaints and insistence
965.794	of trying to get this work destroyed,
968.534	it was finally the year
968.534	that Michelangelo died
970.719	that the Church finally
970.719	found a compromise,
972.824	a way to save the painting,
974.379	and that was in putting up
974.379	these extra 30 covers,
977.72	and that happens to be
977.72	the origin of fig-leafing.
980.491	That's where it all came about,
982.103	and it came about from a church
982.103	that was trying to save a work of art,
986.257	not indeed deface or destroyed it.
988.888	BG: This, what you just gave us,
988.888	is not the classic tour
991.699	that people get today
991.699	when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
994.697	(Laughter)
996.824	EL: I don't know, is that an ad?
998.629	(Laughter)
1000.33	BG: No, no, no, not necessarily,
1000.33	it is a statement.
1003.342	The experience of art today
1003.342	is encountering problems.
1007.28	Too many people want to see this there,
1010.179	and the result is five million people
1010.179	going through that tiny door
1013.33	and experiencing it
1013.33	in a completely different way
1015.671	than we just did.
1016.861	EL: Right. I agree. I think it's really
1016.861	nice to be able to pause and look.
1020.414	But also realize,
1020.414	even when you're in those days,
1022.739	with 28,000 people a day,
1024.775	even those days when you're in there
1024.775	with all those other people,
1027.909	look around you and think
1027.909	how amazing it is
1030.338	that some painted plaster
1030.338	from 500 years ago
1033.958	can still draw all those people
1033.958	standing side by side with you,
1037.09	looking upwards with their jaws dropped.
1039.089	It's a great statement about how beauty
1039.089	truly can speak to us all
1044.038	through time and through geographic space.
1046.749	BG: Liz, grazie.
1047.967	EL: Grazie a te.
1049.198	BG: Thank you.
1050.398	(Applause)
