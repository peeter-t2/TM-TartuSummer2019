12.285	This is an image of the planet Earth.
15.178	It looks very much like the Apollo pictures
18.271	that are very well known.
19.882	There is something different;
21.952	you can click on it,
23.399	and if you click on it,
24.597	you can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.
27.669	For instance, this is a bird's-eye view
29.668	of the EPFL campus.
32.334	In many cases, you can also see
34.442	how a building looks from a nearby street.
38.182	This is pretty amazing.
39.604	But there's something missing in this wonderful tour:
43.031	It's time.
45.219	i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.
48.289	I'm not even sure it was taken
49.701	at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.
55.784	In my lab, we develop tools
57.993	to travel not only in space
59.757	but also through time.
62.315	The kind of question we're asking is
64.185	Is it possible to build something
65.578	like Google Maps of the past?
67.756	Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps
71.066	and just change the year,
72.869	seeing how it was 100 years before,
74.66	1,000 years before?
76.329	Is that possible?
78.452	Can I reconstruct social networks of the past?
80.704	Can I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?
83.753	So, can I build time machines?
87.529	"Maybe we can just say, ""No, it's not possible."""
90.094	Or, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.
93.904	This is what I call the information mushroom.
97.094	Vertically, you have the time.
98.677	and horizontally, the amount of digital information available.
101.417	Obviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.
104.899	And obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.
108.447	If we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,
110.765	or Facebook of the past,
112.259	we need to enlarge this space,
113.833	we need to make that like a rectangle.
115.771	How do we do that?
117.281	One way is digitization.
119.395	There's a lot of material available --
121.19	newspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.
127.46	I can digitize all these.
129.228	I can extract information from these.
131.965	Of course, the more you go in the past,
131.965	the less information you will have.
135.508	So, it might not be enough.
138.154	So, I can do what historians do.
140.562	I can extrapolate.
142.086	This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.
146.556	If I take a log book,
148.307	I can consider, it's not just a log book
150.711	of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.
153.683	I can consider it is actually a log book
155.326	which is representative of
155.326	many journeys of that period.
157.908	I'm extrapolating.
160.153	If I have a painting of a facade,
162.191	I can consider it's not just that particular building,
164.942	but probably it also shares the same grammar
168.874	of buildings where we lost any information.
172.915	So if we want to construct a time machine,
175.773	we need two things.
177.112	We need very large archives,
179.346	and we need excellent specialists.
182.088	The Venice Time Machine,
183.962	the project I'm going to talk to you about,
185.767	is a joint project between the EPFL
188.787	and the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.
191.765	There's something very peculiar about Venice,
193.93	that its administration has been
196.604	very, very bureaucratic.
198.798	They've been keeping track of everything,
200.991	almost like Google today.
203.906	At the Archivio di Stato,
205.42	you have 80 kilometers of archives
207.184	documenting every aspect
209.193	of the life of Venice over
209.193	more than 1,000 years.
211.439	You have every boat that goes out,
213.359	every boat that comes in.
214.435	You have every change that was made in the city.
217.232	This is all there.
220.523	We are setting up a 10-year digitization program
224.431	which has the objective of transforming
226.108	this immense archive
227.492	into a giant information system.
229.918	The type of objective we want to reach
231.775	is 450 books a day that can be digitized.
236.501	Of course, when you digitize, that's not enough,
238.748	because these documents,
240.035	most of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,
242.689	in Venetian dialect,
244.204	so you need to transcribe them,
245.879	to translate them in some cases,
247.56	to index them,
248.68	and this is obviously not easy.
250.844	In particular, traditional optical
250.844	character recognition method
254.688	that can be used for printed manuscripts,
256.112	they do not work well on the handwritten document.
260.116	So the solution is actually to take inspiration
262.246	from another domain: speech recognition.
265.147	This is a domain of something 
265.147	that seems impossible,
267.202	which can actually be done,
269.739	simply by putting additional constraints.
271.933	If you have a very good model
273.519	of a language which is used,
275.045	if you have a very good model of a document,
277.131	how well they are structured.
278.563	And these are administrative documents.
279.931	They are well structured in many cases.
282.063	If you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets
285.371	where a smaller subset
285.371	actually shares similar features,
288.248	then there's a chance of success.
294.761	If we reach that stage, then there's something else:
297.196	we can extract from this document events.
300.718	Actually probably 10 billion events
303.016	can be extracted from this archive.
304.947	And this giant information system
306.671	can be searched in many ways.
308.487	You can ask questions like,
309.855	"""Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"""
312.615	"""How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market"
314.837	"in 1434?"""
316.561	"""What was the salary"
318.021	of a glass maker in Murano
320.066	"maybe over a decade?"""
321.472	You can ask even bigger questions
322.894	because it will be semantically coded.
325.632	And then what you can do is put that in space,
327.772	because much of this information is spatial.
329.945	And from that, you can do things like
331.88	reconstructing this extraordinary journey
333.993	of that city that managed to
333.993	have a sustainable development
337.349	over a thousand years,
339.475	managing to have all the time
341.095	a form of equilibrium with its environment.
343.956	You can reconstruct that journey,
345.204	visualize it in many different ways.
348.1	But of course, you cannot understand 
348.1	Venice if you just look at the city.
350.799	You have to put it in a larger European context.
353.195	So the idea is also to document all the things
356.016	that worked at the European level.
358.439	We can reconstruct also the journey
360.403	of the Venetian maritime empire,
362.393	how it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,
365.559	how it became the most powerful medieval empire
369.305	of its time,
370.866	controlling most of the sea routes
373.038	from the east to the south.
377.305	But you can even do other things,
379.621	because in these maritime routes,
381.898	there are regular patterns.
383.889	You can go one step beyond
386.382	and actually create a simulation system,
388.502	create a Mediterranean simulator
391.317	which is capable actually of reconstructing
393.91	even the information we are missing,
396.112	which would enable us to have 
396.112	questions you could ask
399.1	like if you were using a route planner.
402.088	"""If I am in Corfu in June 1323"
405.159	and want to go to Constantinople,
407.685	"where can I take a boat?"""
409.828	Probably we can answer this question
411.195	with one or two or three days' precision.
415.668	"""How much will it cost?"""
417.275	"""What are the chance of encountering pirates?"""
420.867	Of course, you understand,
422.678	the central scientific challenge
422.678	of a project like this one
425.287	is qualifying, quantifying and representing
429.016	uncertainty and inconsistency
429.016	at each step of this process.
432.346	There are errors everywhere,
435.058	errors in the document, it's
435.058	the wrong name of the captain,
437.547	some of the boats never actually took to sea.
440.76	There are errors in translation, interpretative biases,
445.624	and on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,
449.09	you're going to have errors in recognition,
452.039	errors in extraction,
454	so you have very, very uncertain data.
458.481	So how can we detect and
458.481	correct these inconsistencies?
462.238	How can we represent that form of uncertainty?
465.898	It's difficult. One thing you can do
467.995	is document each step of the process,
470.221	not only coding the historical information
472.669	but what we call the meta-historical information,
475.348	how is historical knowledge constructed,
478.011	documenting each step.
480.009	That will not guarantee that we actually converge
481.654	toward a single story of Venice,
484.104	but probably we can actually reconstruct
486.242	a fully documented potential story of Venice.
489.29	Maybe there's not a single map.
490.749	Maybe there are several maps.
492.869	The system should allow for that,
495.085	because we have to deal with
495.085	a new form of uncertainty,
497.944	which is really new for this type of giant databases.
502.585	And how should we communicate
504.79	this new research to a large audience?
508.769	Again, Venice is extraordinary for that.
511.432	With the millions of visitors that come every year,
513.603	it's actually one of the best places
515.366	to try to invent the museum of the future.
518.354	Imagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map
521.658	of a given year,
522.944	and vertically, you see the document
525.902	that served the reconstruction,
527.413	paintings, for instance.
530.813	Imagine an immersive system that permits
533.393	to go and dive and reconstruct
533.393	the Venice of a given year,
536.895	some experience you could share within a group.
539.61	On the contrary, imagine actually that you start
541.856	from a document, a Venetian manuscript,
544.063	and you show, actually, what
544.063	you can construct out of it,
547.112	how it is decoded,
548.884	how the context of that document can be recreated.
551.299	This is an image from an exhibit
553.184	which is currently conducted in Geneva
555.46	with that type of system.
557.814	So to conclude, we can say that
559.989	research in the humanities is about to undergo
563.068	an evolution which is maybe similar
564.87	to what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.
569.452	It's really a question of scale.
574.13	We see projects which are
577.433	much beyond any single research team can do,
581.276	and this is really new for the humanities,
583.519	which very often take the habit of working
587.388	in small groups or only with a couple of researchers.
591.396	When you visit the Archivio di Stato,
593.514	you feel this is beyond what any single team can do,
596.336	and that should be a joint and common effort.
600.17	So what we must do for this paradigm shift
603.276	is actually foster a new generation
605.178	"of ""digital humanists"""
606.715	that are going to be ready for this shift.
608.805	I thank you very much.
610.764	(Applause)
