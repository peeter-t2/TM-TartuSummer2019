12.837	How much do you need
12.837	to know about a person
14.862	before you'd feel comfortable
14.862	making a loan?
18.044	Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars
20.523	to the person sitting two rows behind you.
23.19	What would you need to know
23.19	about that person
25.346	before you'd feel comfortable?
27.291	My mom came to the US from India
27.291	in her late thirties.
31.614	She's a doctor in Brooklyn,
33.07	and she often lets friends and neighbors
33.07	come to see her for health services,
37.317	whether they can pay right away or not.
39.955	I remember running into her patients
39.955	with her at the grocery store
43.186	or on the sidewalk,
44.361	and sometimes they would come
44.361	and pay her right on the spot
47.225	for previous appointments.
48.607	She would thank them,
49.87	and ask them about their families
49.87	and their health.
53.466	She gave them credit
53.466	because she trusted them.
57.122	Most of us are like my mom.
59.899	We would give credit to someone we know
62.786	or that we live next to.
64.206	But most of us are probably not
64.206	going to lend to a stranger
67.934	unless we know a little
67.934	something about them.
71.634	Banks, credit card companies
71.634	and other financial institutions
75.361	don't know us on a personal level,
77.645	but they do have a way of trusting us,
80.548	and that's through our credit scores.
83.033	Our credit scores have been created
85.052	through an aggregation and analysis
85.052	of our public consumer credit data.
89.596	And because of them, we have
89.596	pretty much easy access
92.861	to all of the goods
92.861	and services that we need,
95.329	from getting electricity to buying a home,
98.197	or taking a risk and starting a business.
101.561	But ...
102.746	there are 2.5 billion people
102.746	around the world
107.137	that don't have a credit score.
109.247	That's a third of the world's population.
112.93	They don't have a score
114.209	because there are no formal
114.209	public records on them --
117.494	no bank accounts,
118.882	no credit histories
120.4	and no social security numbers.
122.482	And because they don't have a score,
124.225	they don't have access
124.225	to the credit or financial products
128.9	that can improve their lives.
131.509	They are not trusted.
134.968	So we wanted to find a way to build trust
138.162	and to open up financial access
138.162	for these 2.5 billion.
142.772	So we created a mobile application
145.262	that builds credit scores for them
145.262	using mobile data.
150.345	There are currently over one billion
150.345	smartphones in emerging markets.
154.825	And people are using them
154.825	the same way that we do.
158.235	They're texting their friends,
158.235	they're looking up directions,
161.228	they're browsing the Internet
162.664	and they're even making
162.664	financial transactions.
165.167	Over time, this data is getting
165.167	captured on our phones,
168.377	and it provides a really rich picture
168.377	of a person's life.
173.132	Our customers give us access to this data
175.332	and we capture it
175.332	through our mobile application.
178.466	It helps us understand
178.466	the creditworthiness
181.134	of people like Jenipher,
181.134	a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.
186.29	Jenipher is 65 years old, and for decades
186.29	has been running a food stall
191.197	in the central business district.
193.897	She has three sons who she put
193.897	through vocational school,
197.12	and she's also the leader
197.12	of her local chama,
199.668	or savings group.
201.609	Jenipher's food stall does well.
203.556	She makes just enough every day
203.556	to cover her expenses.
207.024	But she's not financially secure.
209.842	Any emergency could force her into debt.
212.887	And she has no discretionary income
214.758	to improve her family's way of living,
217.02	for emergencies,
218.283	or for investing
218.283	into growing her business.
222.065	If Jenipher wants credit,
222.065	her options are limited.
225.733	She could get a microloan,
227.135	but she'd have to form a group
227.135	that could help vouch for her credibility.
231.003	And even then, the loan sizes
231.003	would be way too small
233.999	to really have an impact on her business,
236.28	averaging around 150 dollars.
239.525	Loan sharks are always an option,
242.067	but with interest rates
242.067	that are well above 300 percent,
246.041	they're financially risky.
248.079	And because Jenipher doesn't have
248.079	collateral or a credit history,
252.088	she can't walk into a bank
252.088	and ask for a business loan.
256.331	But one day,
257.678	Jenipher's son convinced her
257.678	to download our application
261.68	and apply for a loan.
263.407	Jenipher answered a few
263.407	questions on her phone
265.97	and she gave us access to a few
265.97	key data points on her device.
270.561	And here's what we saw.
272.392	So, bad news first.
274.996	Jenipher had a low savings balance
274.996	and no previous loan history.
280.395	These are factors
281.57	that would have thrown up
281.57	a red flag to a traditional bank.
284.62	But there were other points
284.62	in her history that showed us
287.375	a much richer picture of her potential.
291.342	So for one,
292.517	we saw that she made regular
292.517	phone calls to her family in Uganda.
297.629	Well, it turns out that the data shows
300.11	a four percent increase in repayment
302.868	among people who consistently
302.868	communicate with a few close contacts.
308.657	We could also see
309.84	that though she traveled
309.84	around a lot throughout the day,
312.672	she actually had pretty
312.672	regular travel patterns,
315.427	and she was either at home
315.427	or at her food stall.
319.315	And the data shows
319.315	a six percent increase in repayment
323.326	among customers who are consistent
325.737	with where they spend most of their time.
329.349	We could also see
329.349	that she communicated a lot
331.954	with many different people
331.954	throughout the day
334.326	and that she had a strong support network.
337.287	Our data shows
338.704	that people who communicate
338.704	with more than 58 different contacts
343.408	tend to be more likely
343.408	to be good borrowers.
346.333	In Jenipher's case,
347.626	she communicated
347.626	with 89 different individuals,
351.693	which showed a nine percent
351.693	increase in her repayment.
355.888	These are just some of the thousands
355.888	of different data points
359.679	that we look at to understand
359.679	a person's creditworthiness.
363.397	And after analyzing all
363.397	of these different data points,
366.494	we took the first risk
368.49	and gave Jenipher a loan.
371.37	This is data that would not
371.37	be found on a paper trail
374.72	or in any formal financial record.
377.72	But it proves trust.
380.193	By looking beyond income,
382.194	we can see that people in emerging markets
384.375	that may seem risky
384.375	and unpredictable on the surface
388.068	are actually willing and have
388.068	the capacity to repay.
393.334	Our credit scores have helped us deliver
393.334	over 200,000 loans in Kenya
398.543	in just the past year.
400.164	And our repayment rates
400.164	are above 90 percent --
403.49	which, by the way, is in line
403.49	with traditional bank repayment rates.
409.564	With something as simple
409.564	as a credit score,
412.497	we're giving people the power
412.497	to build their own futures.
416.647	Our customers have used
416.647	their loans for family expenses,
419.978	emergencies, travel
421.859	and for investing back
421.859	into growing their businesses.
425.792	They're now building better
425.792	economies and communities
429.288	where more people can succeed.
432.664	Over the past two years
432.664	of using our product,
435.416	Jenipher has increased
435.416	her savings by 60 percent.
439.624	She's also started
439.624	two additional food stalls
442.3	and is now making plans
442.3	for her own restaurant.
445.401	She's applying for a small-business loan
445.401	from a commercial bank,
448.829	because she now has the credit history
448.829	to prove she deserves it.
454.038	I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,
456.977	and she told me how excited
456.977	she was to get started.
460.252	She said,
462.178	"""Only my son believed I could do this."
462.178	"I didn't think this was for me."""
468.25	She's lived her whole life
470.56	believing that there was a part
470.56	of the world that was closed off to her.
475.536	Our job now is to open
475.536	the world to Jenipher
479.916	and the billions like her
479.916	that deserve to be trusted.
484.135	Thank you.
485.318	(Applause)
