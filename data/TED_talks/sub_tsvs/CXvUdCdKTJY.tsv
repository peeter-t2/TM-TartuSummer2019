12.786	Every group of female friends
12.786	has the funny one,
16.403	the one you go to
16.403	when you need a good cry,
19.166	the one who tells you to suck it up
19.166	when you've had a hard day.
22.841	And this group was no different.
25.524	Except that this was a community
25.524	of groundbreaking women
29.203	who came together --
30.48	first to become teammates,
30.48	then friends, and then family --
34.003	in the least likely of places:
36.548	on the Special Operations battlefield.
39.765	This was a group of women
39.765	whose friendship and valor was cemented
43.026	not only by what they had seen
43.026	and done at the tip of the spear,
47.508	but by the fact that they were there
49.503	at a time when women --
49.503	officially, at least --
52.045	remained banned from ground combat,
54.604	and America had no idea they existed.
59.546	This story begins
59.546	with Special Operations leaders,
62.432	some of the most tested men
62.432	in the United States military, saying,
66.033	"""We need women to help us wage this war."""
70.358	"""America would never kill its way"
70.358	"to the end of its wars,"" it argued."
73.771	"""Needed more knowledge"
73.771	"and more understanding."""
76.763	And as everyone knows,
78.243	if you want to understand what's happening
78.243	in a community and in a home,
81.814	you talk to women,
83.411	whether you're talking about
83.411	Southern Afghanistan,
86.125	or Southern California.
88.558	But in this case,
88.558	men could not talk to women,
91.154	because in a conservative
91.154	and traditional society like Afghanistan,
94.577	that would cause grave offense.
96.809	So you needed women soldiers out there.
101.045	That meant, at this time in the war,
101.045	that the women who would be recruited
105.042	to serve alongside Army Rangers
105.042	and Navy SEALs,
107.929	would be seeing the kind of combat
107.929	experienced by less than five percent
112.413	of the entire United States military.
115.579	Less than five percent.
118.587	So the call went out.
120.145	"""Female soldiers:"
120.145	Become a part of history.
122.58	Join Special Operations
122.58	"on the battlefield in Afghanistan."""
126.727	This is in 2011.
128.525	And from Alabama to Alaska,
130.738	a group of women who had always
130.738	wanted to do something that mattered
134.695	alongside the best of the best,
136.697	and to make a difference
136.697	for their country,
138.974	answered that call to serve.
142.294	And for them it was not about politics,
142.294	it was about serving with purpose.
148.858	And so, the women who came
148.858	to North Carolina
151.34	to compete for a spot on these teams
154.067	which would put women
154.067	on the Special Operations front lines,
157.288	landed and found
157.288	very quickly a community,
160.659	the likes of which they had never seen.
163.304	Full of women who were as fierce
163.304	and as fit as they were,
166.896	and as driven to make a difference.
169.128	They didn't have to apologize
169.128	for who they were,
171.591	and in fact, they could celebrate it.
174.589	And what they found when they were there
174.589	was that all of a sudden,
178.706	there were lots of people like them.
181.501	As one of them said,
182.89	"""It was like you looked"
182.89	around and realized
184.96	there was more
184.96	"than one giraffe at the zoo."""
189.212	Among this team of standouts was Cassie,
191.953	a young woman who managed to be
191.953	an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister
196.447	and a Women's Studies minor,
196.447	all in one person.
200.385	Tristan, a West Point track star,
200.385	who always ran and road marched
204.995	with no socks,
206.256	and had shoes whose smell proved it.
208.43	(Laughter)
209.897	Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who had
209.897	always wanted to be in the infantry,
213.895	and when she found out
213.895	that women couldn't be,
216.395	she decided to become an intel officer.
219.626	She served in Bosnia,
220.88	and later helped the FBI
220.88	to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania.
224.979	And then there was Kate,
224.979	who played high school football
228.482	all four years,
229.718	and actually wanted to drop out
229.718	after the first,
232.324	to go into the glee club,
233.825	but when boys told her
233.825	that girls couldn't play football,
236.732	she decided to stay
238.013	for all the little girls
238.013	who would come after her.
242.268	For them, biology had shaped
242.268	part of their destiny,
244.973	and put, as Cassie once said,
247.079	"""everything noble"
247.079	"out of reach for girls."""
250.353	And yet, here was a chance
250.353	to serve with the best of the best
253.673	on a mission that mattered
253.673	to their country,
255.757	not despite the fact
255.757	that they were female,
258.456	but because of it.
260.769	This team of women, in many ways,
260.769	was like women everywhere.
264.76	They wore makeup, and in fact,
266.355	they would bond in the ladies' room
266.355	over eyeliner and eye pencil.
270.531	They also wore body armor.
272.543	They would put 50 pounds
272.543	of weight on their backs,
274.955	and board the helicopter for an operation,
277.005	and they would come back and watch
277.005	"a movie called ""Bridesmaids."""
280.061	(Laughter)
281.936	They even wore a thing called Spanx,
284.669	because, as they found very quickly,
286.633	the uniforms made for men were
286.633	big where they should be small,
290.549	and small where they should be big.
292.623	So Lane, an Iraq War veteran --
292.623	you see her here on my left --
296.184	decided she was going to go on Amazon
298.264	and order a pair of Spanx to her base,
300.407	so that her pants would fit better
300.407	when she went out on mission each night.
304.822	These women would get together
304.822	over video conference
307.247	from all around Afghanistan
307.247	from their various bases,
309.728	and they would talk about what it was like
311.76	to be one of the only women
311.76	doing what they were doing.
314.435	They would swap jokes,
315.636	they would talk about
315.636	what was working, what wasn't,
318.112	what they had learned to do well,
318.112	what they needed to do better.
321.183	And they would talk about
321.183	some of the lighter moments of being women
324.63	out on the Special Operations front lines,
327.146	including the Shewee,
328.535	which was a tool
328.535	that let you pee like a guy,
330.874	although it's said to have had only
330.874	a 40 percent accuracy rate out there.
335.326	(Laughter)
338.441	"These women lived in the ""and."""
341.139	They proved you could be fierce
341.139	and you could be feminine.
344.325	You could wear mascara and body armor.
347.221	You could love CrossFit,
347.221	and really like cross-stitch.
351.301	You could love to climb out of helicopters
351.301	and you could also love to bake cookies.
356.578	Women live in the and every single day,
360.031	and these women brought that
360.031	to this mission as well.
364.547	On this life and death battlefield
364.547	they never forgot
367.466	that being female may have brought them
367.466	to the front lines,
370.581	but being a soldier is what would
370.581	prove themselves there.
374.272	There was the night Amber went
374.272	out on mission,
376.46	and in talking to the women of the house,
378.454	realized that there was
378.454	a barricaded shooter lying in wait
381.303	for the Afghan and American forces
381.303	who were waiting to enter the home.
385.418	Another night it was Tristan
385.418	who found out
388.237	that there were pieces
388.237	that make up explosives
390.425	all around the house
390.425	in which they were standing,
392.746	and that in fact, explosives lay
392.746	all the way between there
395.549	and where they were
395.549	about to head that night.
398.061	There was the night another one
398.061	of their teammates proved herself
401.156	to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs,
403.647	when she found the intel item
403.647	they were looking for
406.067	wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper.
409.309	And there was the night that Isabel,
409.309	another one of their teammates,
412.57	found the things
412.57	that they were looking for,
414.692	and received an Impact Award
414.692	from the Rangers
416.832	who said that without her,
418.582	the things and the people
418.582	they were looking for that night
421.36	would never have been found.
423.553	That night and so many others,
425.405	they went out to prove themselves,
425.405	not only for one another,
428.52	but for everybody
428.52	who would come after them.
431.519	And also for the men
431.519	alongside whom they served.
435.209	We talk a lot about how
435.209	behind every great man is a good woman.
440.354	And in this case,
441.535	next to these women stood men
441.535	who wanted to see them succeed.
445.666	The Army Ranger who trained them
445.666	had served 12 deployments.
449.406	And when they told him
449.406	that he had to go train girls,
452.424	he had no idea what to expect.
455.361	But at the end of eight days with these
455.361	women in the summer of 2011,
459.715	he told his fellow Ranger,
459.715	"""We have just witnessed history."
464.16	These may well be
464.16	"our own Tuskegee Airmen."""
469.666	(Applause)
476.39	At the heart of this team
476.39	was the one person
479.04	"who everyone called ""the best of us."""
481.675	She was a petite blonde dynamo,
484.164	who barely reached five-foot-three.
486.772	And she was this wild mix
486.772	of Martha Stewart,
489.927	and what we know as G.I. Jane.
492.665	She was someone who loved
492.665	to make dinner for her husband,
495.513	her Kent State ROTC sweetheart
495.513	who pushed her to be her best,
499.64	and to trust herself,
500.993	and to test every limit she could.
503.944	She also loved to put 50 pounds of weight
503.944	on her back and run for miles,
508.138	and she loved to be a soldier.
511.08	She was somebody who had a bread maker
511.08	in her office in Kandahar,
514.338	and would bake a batch of raisin bread,
514.338	and then go to the gym
517.294	and bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups
517.294	from a dead hang.
521.092	She was the person who, if you needed
521.092	an extra pair of boots
524.017	or a home-cooked dinner,
524.017	would be on your speed dial.
527.404	Because she never, ever would talk to you
529.666	about how good she was,
530.841	but let her character speak
530.841	through action.
534.45	She was famous for taking the hard right
534.45	over the easy wrong.
540.487	And she was also famous
540.487	for walking up to a 15-foot rope,
543.901	climbing it using only her arms,
546.085	and then shuffling away and apologizing,
548.11	because she knew she was supposed
548.11	to use both her arms and her legs,
551.524	as the Rangers had trained them.
553.245	(Laughter)
555.145	Some of our heroes return home
555.145	to tell their stories.
559.346	And some of them don't.
561.958	And on October 22, 2011,
564.527	First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed
564.527	alongside two Rangers,
568.119	Christopher Horns
569.498	and Kristoffer Domeij.
571.998	Her death threw this program built
571.998	for the shadows
575.271	into a very public spotlight.
577.322	Because after all,
578.499	the ban on women in combat
578.499	was still very much in place.
582.856	And at her funeral,
584.294	the head of Army Special Operations came,
584.294	and gave a public testimony
588.722	not just to the courage of Ashley White,
590.961	but to all her team of sisters.
593.746	"""Make no mistake about it,"" he said,"
593.746	"""these women are warriors,"
598.198	and they have written a new chapter
598.198	in what it means to be a female
601.538	"in the United States Army."""
604.989	Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide
604.989	and a school bus driver,
608.691	who bakes cookies on the side.
611.34	She doesn't remember much
611.34	about that overwhelming set of days,
614.546	in which grief -- enormous grief --
617.339	mixed with pride.
619.359	But she does remember one moment.
621.913	A stranger with a child
621.913	in her hand came up to her
625.343	"and she said, ""Mrs. White,"
628.049	I brought my daughter here today,
630.371	because I wanted her to know
630.371	what a hero was.
634.49	And I wanted her to know
634.49	"that heroes could be women, too."""
639.749	It is time to celebrate
639.749	all the unsung heroines
643.387	who reach into their guts
645.136	and find the heart and the grit
645.136	to keep going and to test every limit.
650.1	This very unlikely band of sisters
650.1	bound forever in life and afterward
655.844	did indeed become part of history,
658.19	and they paved the way for so many
658.19	who would come after them,
661.345	as much as they stood on the shoulders
661.345	of those who had come before.
666.303	These women showed that warriors come
666.303	in all shapes and sizes.
671.454	And women can be heroes, too.
674.648	Thank you so much.
675.824	(Applause)
