12.703	Today,
14.684	a baffled lady observed
16.324	the shell where my soul dwells
18.316	And announced that I'm
21.457	"""articulate"""
23.364	Which means that when it comes
25.702	to enunciation and diction
27.697	I don't even think of it
28.703	"‘Cause I’m ""articulate"""
31.39	So when my professor asks a question
33.97	And my answer is tainted with a connotation
36.129	of urbanized suggestion
37.477	There’s no misdirected intention
39.943	Pay attention
40.92	‘Cause I’m “articulate”
43.258	So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”
46.815	My “articulate” answer never goes amiss
49.953	I say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”
53.469	And when I’m on the block
54.796	I switch it up just because I can
56.491	So when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”
59.129	I just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”
64.539	And sometimes in class
66.131	I might pause the intellectual sounding flow to ask
69.06	“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”
72.725	Yes, I have decided to treat
74.89	all three of my languages as equals
76.952	Because I’m “articulate”
80.95	But who controls articulation?
83.371	Because the English language
83.371	is a multifaceted oration
86.525	Subject to indefinite transformation
88.344	Now you may think that it is
88.344	ignorant to speak broken English
91.957	But I’m here to tell you that
91.957	even “articulate” Americans
95.114	sound foolish to the British
97.114	So when my Professor comes on
97.114	the block and says, “Hello”
100.363	I stop him and say “Noooo …
103	You’re being inarticulate …
105.144	the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”
107.307	Now you may think that’s too hood, that’s not cool
110.922	But I’m here to tell you that
110.922	even our language has rules
113.9	So when Mommy mocks me and says
116.512	“ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store”
118.77	I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not following the law
123.756	"Never does the word ""madd"" go "
123.756	before a present participle
127.447	That’s simply the principle of this English”
129.95	If I had the vocal capacity I would
131.62	sing this from every mountaintop,
133.674	From every suburbia, and every hood
135.95	‘Cause the only God of language is
135.95	the one recorded in the Genesis
139.503	"Of this world saying “it is good"""
141.22	So I may not always come before you
143.791	with excellency of speech
145.185	But do not judge me by my language and assume
147.716	That I’m too ignorant to teach
149.235	‘Cause I speak three tongues
150.785	One for each:
151.933	Home, school and friends
153.678	I’m a tri-lingual orator
155.882	Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now
157.851	Then switch it up so I don’t bore later
159.81	Sometimes I fight back two tongues
161.687	While I use the other one in the classroom
163.622	And when I mistakenly mix them up
165.547	I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom
169.04	I know that I had to borrow your language
173.632	because mines was stolen
176.477	But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly
180.377	while mines is broken
181.879	These words are spoken
183.398	By someone who is simply fed up with
185.705	the Eurocentric ideals of this season
188.325	And the reason I speak a composite
188.325	version of your language
191.808	Is because mines was raped
191.808	away along with my history
195.56	I speak broken English so the
195.56	profusing gashes can remind us
199.79	That our current state is not a mystery
202.05	I’m so tired of the negative images
202.05	that are driving my people mad
207.258	So unless you’ve seen it rob
207.258	a bank stop calling my hair bad
211.501	I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity
215.157	So don’t call it good unless your hair is known
217.71	for donating to charity
219.255	As much as has been raped away from our people
224.182	How can you expect me to treat
224.182	their imprint on your language
228.121	As anything less than equal
230.735	Let there be no confusion
232.607	Let there be no hesitation
234.421	This is not a promotion of ignorance
236.485	This is a linguistic celebration
239.93	"That’s why I put ""tri-lingual"" on my last job application"
245.009	I can help to diversify your consumer market
247.74	is all I wanted them to know
249.372	And when they call me for the interview
251.105	I’ll be more than happy to show that
252.615	I can say:
253.35	“What’s good”
254.563	“Whatagwan”
255.548	And of course …“Hello”
258.452	Because I’m “articulate”
261.126	Thank you.
262.899	(Applause)
