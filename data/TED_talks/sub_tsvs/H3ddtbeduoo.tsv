13.039	Right now
14.797	there is an aspiring teacher
17.539	who is working on a 60-page paper
21.19	based on some age-old education theory
24.7	developed by some dead education professor
28.893	wondering to herself what this task
31.611	that she's engaging in
33.251	has to do with what she wants to do with her life,
35.779	which is be an educator,
38.005	change lives, and spark magic.
42.119	Right now there is an aspiring teacher
47.003	in a graduate school of education
48.959	who is watching a professor babble on and on
51.967	about engagement
54.091	in the most disengaging way possible.
59.265	Right now
60.915	there's a first-year teacher at home
63.114	who is pouring through lesson plans
65.666	trying to make sense of standards,
67.996	who is trying to make sense of how
67.996	to grade students appropriately,
71.186	while at the same time saying to herself
72.825	over and over again,
75.039	"""Don't smile till November,"""
76.997	because that's what she was taught
79.08	in her teacher education program.
82.102	Right now there's a student
84.958	who is coming up with a way
86.642	to convince his mom or dad
89.13	that he's very, very sick
90.638	and can't make it to school tomorrow.
94.511	On the other hand, right now
97.408	there are amazing educators
99.758	that are sharing information,
101.532	information that is shared in such a beautiful way
104.179	that the students are sitting
104.179	at the edge of their seats
106.57	just waiting for a bead of sweat
108.682	to drop off the face of this person
111.267	so they can soak up all that knowledge.
114.312	Right now there is also a person
118.03	who has an entire audience rapt with attention,
121.391	a person that is weaving a powerful narrative
124.283	about a world
125.959	that the people who are listening
127.514	have never imagined or seen before,
129.88	but if they close their eyes tightly enough,
132.398	they can envision that world
134.037	because the storytelling is so compelling.
138.032	Right now there's a person who can tell an audience
141.171	to put their hands up in the air
143.074	and they will stay there till he says,
144.724	"""Put them down."""
146.468	Right now.
148.136	So people will then say,
149.54	"""Well, Chris, you describe the guy"
152.403	who is going through some awful training
154.427	but you're also describing these powerful educators.
156.96	If you're thinking about the world of education
158.494	or urban education in particular,
160.092	these guys will probably cancel each other out,
162.138	"and then we'll be okay."""
164.384	The reality is, the folks I described
166.886	as the master teachers,
168.602	the master narrative builders,
170.939	the master storytellers
172.89	are far removed from classrooms.
176.488	The folks who know the skills about how to teach
178.87	and engage an audience
180.192	don't even know what teacher certification means.
183.112	They may not even have the degrees
185.174	to be able to have anything
188.435	to call an education.
190.739	And that to me is sad.
192.471	It's sad because the people who I described,
195.47	they were very disinterested in the learning process,
198.237	want to be effective teachers,
200.095	but they have no models.
201.447	I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.
203.192	Mark Twain says that proper preparation,
205.722	or teaching,
207.122	is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,
210.738	it can turn awful practices into powerful ones,
213.41	it can change men and transform them
215.994	into angels.
218.595	The folks who I described earlier
220.898	got proper preparation in teaching,
222.888	not in any college or university,
224.972	but by virtue of just being in the
224.972	same spaces of those who engage.
228.967	Guess where those places are?
231.21	Barber shops,
233.276	rap concerts, and most importantly,
236.464	in the black church.
238.112	And I've been framing this idea
238.112	called Pentecostal pedagogy.
241.031	Who here has been to a black church?
243.341	We got a couple of hands.
245.65	You go to a black church,
247.013	their preacher starts off
248.624	and he realizes that he has to engage the audience,
251.51	so he starts off with this sort of wordplay
253.356	in the beginning oftentimes,
255.04	and then he takes a pause,
256.858	"and he says, ""Oh my gosh, they're"
256.858	"not quite paying attention."""
259.039	"So he says, ""Can I get an amen?"""
260.64	Audience: Amen.
261.626	Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen?
261.626	Audience: Amen.
263.925	CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.
267.257	That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.
269.318	He drops his voice at a very, very low volume
271.978	when he wants people to key into him,
273.852	and those things are the skills that we need
276.108	for the most engaging teachers.
278.183	So why does teacher education
279.621	only give you theory and theory
281.694	and tell you about standards and tell you about
283.93	all of these things that have nothing to do
285.874	with the basic skills, that magic that you need
289.19	to engage an audience, to engage a student?
292.159	So I make the argument that
292.159	we reframe teacher education,
295.177	that we could focus on content, and that's fine,
297.962	and we could focus on theories, and that's fine,
300.268	but content and theories
301.839	with the absence of the magic
304.443	of teaching and learning means nothing.
307.354	Now people oftentimes say,
307.354	"""Well, magic is just magic."""
310.109	There are teachers who,
311.49	despite all their challenges, who have those skills,
313.954	get into those schools and are 
313.954	able to engage an audience,
316.675	and the administrator walks by and says,
317.969	"""Wow, he's so good, I wish all"
317.969	"my teachers could be that good."""
320.897	And when they try to describe what that is,
322.94	"they just say, ""He has that magic."""
325.17	But I'm here to tell you
326.432	that magic can be taught.
328.89	Magic can be taught.
331.237	Magic can be taught.
334.049	Now, how do you teach it?
335.58	You teach it by allowing people
337.251	to go into those spaces
338.656	where the magic is happening.
340.258	If you want to be an aspiring
340.258	teacher in urban education,
342.99	you've got to leave the confines of that university
345.272	and go into the hood.
347.03	You've got to go in there and
347.03	hang out at the barbershop,
349.14	you've got to attend that black church,
350.522	and you've got to view those folks
351.977	that have the power to engage
353.78	and just take notes on what they do.
355.56	At our teacher education classes at my university,
358.56	I've started a project where every single student
360.954	that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.
365.546	They watch the way that the rappers move
367.769	and talk with their hands.
369.302	They study the way that he
369.302	walks proudly across that stage.
372.282	They listen to his metaphors and analogies,
374.488	and they start learning these little things
376.1	that if they practice enough
377.9	becomes the key to magic.
379.589	They learn that if you just stare at a student
381.85	and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,
384.353	you don't have to say a word
385.82	because they know that that
385.82	means that you want more.
389.393	And if we could transform teacher education
391.848	to focus on teaching teachers
394.11	how to create that magic
396.063	then poof! we could make dead classes come alive,
399.86	we could reignite imaginations,
401.574	and we can change education.
403.29	Thank you.
406.384	(Applause)
