26	Mockingbirds are badass.
28	(Laughter)
29	They are.
31	Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --
33	are the emcees of the animal kingdom.
35	They listen and mimic and remix what they like.
37	They rock the mic outside my window every morning.
39	I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms
42	like they were songs of spring.
44	I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.
46	So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.
48	I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation
51	and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.
54	(Laughter)
55	Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,
57	say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught
60	in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.
63	"Up goes the bird, out come the words, ""Juanito, Juanito,"
66	"vente a comer mi hijo!"""
68	Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.
71	(Laughter)
72	Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac
75	with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags
78	full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.
81	(Laughter)
82	I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,
84	"""We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."""
86	I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.
88	I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.
91	I'll get your postman making dinner plans.
94	I'll get the last time you lied.
96	"I'll get, ""Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."""
98	I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,
100	"""Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."""
102	(Laughter)
103	"I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning ""It's Raining, It's Pouring."""
107	I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.
110	"I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, ""Good morning."""
113	I'll get everyone's good mornings.
115	I don't care how you make 'em.
117	Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.
120	Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.
122	And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.
124	I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.
126	Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --
129	short explanation, hippie parents.
131	(Laughter)
132	What does a violin have to do with technology?
135	Where in the world is this world heading?
137	On one end, gold bars --
140	on the other, an entire planet.
142	We are 12 billion light years from the edge.
145	That's a guess.
146	Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,
149	but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America
152	because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.
155	You might wanna avert your gaze, because that
157	is a newt about to regenerate its limb,
160	and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.
163	There's about 10 million phage per job.
165	It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.
168	Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;
172	we build strong suns.
174	The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,
177	and here we are, right in the middle.
181	(Laughter)
182	It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.
185	When all the little mockingbirds fly away,
187	they're going to sound like the last four days.
190	I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,
193	broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,
196	bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,
198	your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.
200	Everybody gets heard.
202	Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.
206	And I'm on this.
208	I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,
210	with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed
212	"singing, ""Hush, little baby, don't say a word."
215	"Wait for the man with the mockingbird."""
218	(Laughter)
219	Yeah. And then come the news crews, and
221	the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.
223	Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,
226	nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip
229	the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,
232	and they'll offer me a key to the city.
234	A gold-plated, oversized key to the city
236	and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.
240	I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.
244	Thank you, TED.
245	(Applause)
246	Chris Anderson: Wow.
247	(Applause)
256	Wow.
257	(Applause)
