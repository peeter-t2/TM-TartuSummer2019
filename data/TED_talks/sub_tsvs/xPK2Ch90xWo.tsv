12.949	(Rainforest noises)
21.68	In the summer of 2011,
21.68	as a tourist,
25.167	I visited the rainforests of Borneo
25.167	for the very first time,
29.593	and as you might imagine,
31.641	it was the overwhelming sounds
31.641	of the forest that struck me the most.
36.911	There's this constant cacophony of noise.
39.721	Some things actually do stick out.
42.136	For example, this here is a big bird,
42.136	a rhinoceros hornbill.
46.562	This buzzing is a cicada.
51.434	This is a family of gibbons.
54.047	It's actually singing to each other
54.047	over a great distance.
59.341	The place where this was recorded
59.341	was in fact a gibbon reserve,
62.334	which is why you can hear so many of them,
64.372	but in fact the most important noise that 
64.372	was coming out of the forest that time
69.302	was one that I didn't notice,
70.834	and in fact nobody there
70.834	had actually noticed it.
74.373	So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.
76.361	They spend most of their time
76.361	rehabilitating gibbons,
79.17	but they also have
79.17	to spend a lot of their time
81.731	protecting their area from illegal logging
81.731	that takes place on the side.
85.423	And so if we take the sound of the forest
87.466	and we actually turn down the gibbons,
87.466	the insects, and the rest,
91.023	in the background, the entire time,
91.023	in recordings you heard,
94.689	was the sound of a chainsaw
94.689	at great distance.
98.403	They had three full-time guards
98.403	who were posted around this sanctuary
102.397	whose job was in fact
102.397	to guard against illegal logging,
106.599	and one day, we went walking,
106.599	again as tourists, out into the forest,
110.058	and within five minutes' walk,
112.311	we stumbled upon somebody
112.311	who was just sawing a tree down,
115.69	five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters
115.69	from the ranger station.
118.951	They hadn't been able
118.951	to hear the chainsaws,
121.009	because as you heard,
121.009	the forest is very, very loud.
124.826	It struck me as quite unacceptable
124.826	that in this modern time,
128.745	just a few hundred meters away 
128.745	from a ranger station in a sanctuary,
133.217	that in fact nobody could hear it when
133.217	someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.
137.022	It sounds impossible,
137.022	but in fact, it was quite true.
141.689	So how do we stop illegal logging?
143.523	It's really tempting, as an engineer,
143.523	always to come up with a high-tech,
146.952	super-crazy high-tech solution,
148.713	but in fact, you're in the rainforest.
150.663	It has to be simple,
150.663	it has to be scalable,
153.04	and so what we also noticed
153.04	while were there was that
156.048	everything we needed was already there.
158.374	We could build a system
158.374	that would allow us to stop this
161.125	using what's already there.
163.407	Who was there? What was 
163.407	already in the forest?
165.639	Well, we had people.
166.787	We had this group there that was 
166.787	dedicated, three full-time guards,
170.072	that was dedicated to go and stop it,
171.846	but they just needed to know
171.846	what was happening out in the forest.
174.96	The real surprise, this is the big one,
176.853	was that there was connectivity
176.853	out in the forest.
179.236	There was cell phone service
179.236	way out in the middle of nowhere.
182.15	We're talking hundreds of kilometers
182.15	from the nearest road,
185.081	there's certainly no electricity,
185.081	but they had very good cell phone service,
188.653	these people in the towns
188.653	were on Facebook all the time,
191.276	they're surfing the web on their phones,
193.226	and this sort of got me thinking
193.226	that in fact it would be possible
196.335	to use the sounds of the forest,
198.494	pick up the sounds 
198.494	of chainsaws programmatically,
200.886	because people can't hear them,
202.534	and send an alert.
204.221	But you have to have a device
204.221	to go up in the trees.
206.803	So if we can use some device
206.803	to listen to the sounds of the forest,
210.454	connect to the cell phone
210.454	network that's there,
212.687	and send an alert to people on the ground,
214.721	perhaps we could have a solution
214.721	to this issue for them.
218.271	But let's take a moment
218.271	to talk about saving the rainforest,
221.551	because it's something that we've
221.551	definitely all heard about forever.
225.393	People in my generation
225.393	have heard about saving the rainforest
228.312	since we were kids,
230.212	and it seems that the message
230.212	has never changed:
232.46	We've got to save the rainforest,
232.46	it's super urgent,
234.982	this many football fields
234.982	have been destroyed yesterday.
237.688	and yet here we are today,
237.688	about half of the rainforest remains,
240.992	and we have potentially more urgent 
240.992	problems like climate change.
245.319	But in fact, this is the little-known fact
245.319	that I didn't realize at the time:
249.228	Deforestation accounts 
249.228	for more greenhouse gas
252.189	than all of the world's planes,
252.189	trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
256.229	It's the second highest contributor
256.229	to climate change.
258.945	Also, according to Interpol,
261.778	as much as 90 percent of the logging
261.778	that takes place in the rainforest
265.307	is illegal logging,
265.307	like the illegal logging that we saw.
269.088	So if we can help people in the forest
269.088	enforce the rules that are there,
273.132	then in fact we could eat heavily
273.132	into this 17 percent
277.056	and potentially have a major impact
277.056	in the short term.
279.667	It might just be the cheapest,
279.667	fastest way to fight climate change.
284.832	And so here's the system that we imagine.
286.83	It looks super high tech.
288.024	The moment a sound of a chainsaw
288.024	is heard in the forest,
290.657	the device picks up the sound
290.657	of the chainsaw,
292.829	it sends an alert through the standard
292.829	GSM network that's already there
296.436	to a ranger in the field
298.523	who can in fact show up in real time
298.523	and stop the logging.
301.34	It's no more about going out
301.34	and finding a tree that's been cut.
305.249	It's not about seeing 
305.249	a tree from a satellite
307.425	in an area that's been clear cut,
309.061	it's about real-time intervention.
311.669	So I said it was the cheapest
311.669	and fastest way to do it,
314.39	but in fact, actually, as you saw,
314.39	they weren't able to do it,
317.315	so it may not be so cheap and fast.
319.199	But if the devices in the trees
319.199	were actually cell phones,
322.635	it could be pretty cheap.
324.191	Cell phones are thrown away
324.191	by the hundreds of millions every year,
328.478	hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,
330.599	not counting the rest of the world,
330.599	which of course we should do,
333.78	but in fact, cell phones are great.
336.311	They're full of sensors.
337.644	They can listen
337.644	to the sounds of the forest.
339.796	We do have to protect them.
341.178	We have to put them in this box
341.178	that you see here,
343.585	and we do have to power them.
345.152	Powering them is one of the greater
345.152	engineering challenges
347.915	that we had to deal with,
349.215	because powering a cell phone
349.215	under a tree canopy,
351.967	any sort of solar power
351.967	under a tree canopy,
354.219	was an as-yet-unsolved problem,
356.029	and that's this unique
356.029	solar panel design that you see here,
358.886	which in fact is built also from recycled
358.886	byproducts of an industrial process.
363.205	These are strips that are cut down.
365.829	So this is me putting it all together
369.335	in my parents' garage, actually.
371.216	Thanks very much to them
371.216	for allowing me to do that.
373.793	As you can see,
373.793	this is a device up in a tree.
378.149	What you can see from here, perhaps,
378.149	is that they are pretty well obscured
381.734	up in the tree canopy at a distance.
383.536	That's important, because although
383.536	they are able to hear chainsaw noises
387.013	up to a kilometer in the distance,
388.783	allowing them to cover
388.783	about three square kilometers,
391.303	if someone were to take them,
391.303	it would make the area unprotected.
395.281	So does it actually work?
398.034	Well, to test it,
398.034	we took it back to Indonesia,
401.006	not the same place, but another place,
403.119	to another gibbon reserve
404.79	that was threatened daily
404.79	by illegal logging.
408.505	On the very second day, it picked up
408.505	illegal chainsaw noises.
412.424	We were able to get a real-time alert.
414.623	I got an email on my phone.
415.97	Actually, we had just climbed the tree.
415.97	Everyone had just gotten back down.
419.686	All these guys are smoking cigarettes,
421.926	and then I get an email,
421.926	and they all quiet down,
424.783	and in fact you can hear the chainsaw
426.887	really, really faint in the background,
428.816	but no one had noticed it 
428.816	until that moment.
431.121	And so then we took off
431.121	to actually stop these loggers.
434.395	I was pretty nervous.
435.904	This is the moment where we've actually
435.904	arrived close to where the loggers are.
440.13	This is the moment where you can see
440.13	where I'm actually regretting
443.244	perhaps the entire endeavor.
445.245	I'm not really sure what's on
445.245	the other side of this hill.
447.988	That guy's much braver than I am.
449.951	But he went, so I had to go, walking up,
454.131	and in fact, he made it over the hill,
456.29	and interrupted the loggers in the act.
459.527	For them, it was such a surprise --
461.189	they had never, ever
461.189	been interrupted before --
463.569	that it was such an impressive
463.569	event for them,
465.734	that we've heard from our partners
465.734	they have not been back since.
468.85	They were, in fact, great guys.
470.342	They showed us how
470.342	the entire operation works,
472.522	and what they really convinced us
472.522	on the spot was that
475.096	if you can show up
475.096	in real time and stop people,
477.341	it's enough of a deterrent
477.341	they won't come back.
481.529	So --
483.085	Thank you. (Applause)
489.586	Word of this spread, possibly
489.586	because we told a lot of people,
493.44	and in fact, then some really
493.44	amazing stuff started to happen.
496.877	People from around the world
496.877	started to send us emails, phone calls.
500.546	What we saw was that people
500.546	throughout Asia,
502.635	people throughout Africa,
502.635	people throughout South America,
505.377	they told us that they could use it too,
507.288	and what's most important,
508.568	what we'd found that
508.568	we thought might be exceptional,
511.066	in the forest there was
511.066	pretty good cell phone service.
513.648	That was not exceptional, we were told,
515.525	and that particularly is on the periphery
515.525	of the forests that are most under threat.
519.468	And then something 
519.468	really amazing happened,
521.768	which was that people started sending us
521.768	their own old cell phones.
525.251	So in fact what we have now is a system
527.201	where we can use people on the ground,
527.201	people who are already there,
530.544	who can both improve
530.544	and use the existing connectivity,
533.609	and we're using old cell phones
533.609	that are being sent to us
536.286	by people from around the world
537.779	that want their phones to be doing 
537.779	something else in their afterlife,
541.072	so to speak.
541.826	And if the rest of the device
541.826	can be completely recycled,
544.755	then we believe it's
544.755	an entirely upcycled device.
547.471	So again, this didn't come
547.471	because of any sort of high-tech solution.
551.125	It just came from using
551.125	what's already there,
553.438	and I'm thoroughly convinced
553.438	that if it's not phones,
556.294	that there's always
556.294	going to be enough there
558.663	that you can build similar solutions
560.474	that can be very effective
560.474	in new contexts.
562.54	Thank you very much.
564.676	(Applause)
