13.06	This is a tuberculosis ward,
16.1	and at the time this picture was taken
16.1	in the late 1800s,
19.939	one in seven of all people
22.58	died from tuberculosis.
24.78	We had no idea
24.78	what was causing this disease.
28.14	The hypothesis was actually
30.22	it was your constitution
30.22	that made you susceptible.
33.5	And it was a highly romanticized disease.
36.26	It was also called consumption,
39.1	and it was the disorder of poets
42.26	and artists and intellectuals.
45.02	And some people actually thought
45.02	it gave you heightened sensitivity
48.78	and conferred creative genius.
52.7	By the 1950s,
54.86	we instead knew
54.86	that tuberculosis was caused
57.46	by a highly contagious
57.46	bacterial infection,
60.86	which is slightly less romantic,
63.06	but that had the upside
65.34	of us being able to maybe
65.34	develop drugs to treat it.
68.7	So doctors had discovered
68.7	a new drug, iproniazid,
71.74	that they were optimistic
71.74	might cure tuberculosis,
75.14	and they gave it to patients,
76.94	and patients were elated.
78.74	They were more social, more energetic.
82.26	One medical report actually says
82.26	"they were ""dancing in the halls."""
87.5	And unfortunately,
89.14	this was not necessarily
89.14	because they were getting better.
92.42	A lot of them were still dying.
95.66	Another medical report describes them
95.66	"as being ""inappropriately happy."""
103.22	And that is how the first
103.22	antidepressant was discovered.
107.98	So accidental discovery
107.98	is not uncommon in science,
112.06	but it requires more
112.06	than just a happy accident.
115.22	You have to be able to recognize it
115.22	for discovery to occur.
119.5	As a neuroscientist,
119.5	I'm going to talk to you a little bit
122.26	about my firsthand experience
123.7	with whatever you want to call
123.7	the opposite of dumb luck --
126.94	let's call it smart luck.
128.58	But first, a bit more background.
132.46	Thankfully, since the 1950s,
135.14	we've developed some other drugs
135.14	and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.
139.14	And at least in the United States,
139.14	though not necessarily in other countries,
142.82	we have closed our sanitoriums
144.34	and probably most of you
144.34	are not too worried about TB.
148.9	But a lot of what was true
148.9	in the early 1900s
151.58	about infectious disease,
153.46	we can say now
153.46	about psychiatric disorders.
156.82	We are in the middle
156.82	of an epidemic of mood disorders
159.86	like depression and post-traumatic
159.86	stress disorder, or PTSD.
164.3	One in four of all adults
164.3	in the United States
168.18	suffers from mental illness,
170.18	which means that if you haven't
170.18	experienced it personally
173.34	or someone in your family hasn't,
175.66	it's still very likely
175.66	that someone you know has,
178.94	though they may not talk about it.
182.22	Depression has actually now surpassed
185.54	HIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war
190.42	as the leading cause
190.42	of disability worldwide.
193.7	And also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,
197.34	we don't know what causes it.
199.42	Once it's developed, it's chronic,
201.38	lasts a lifetime,
202.9	and there are no known cures.
206.66	The second antidepressant we discovered,
208.9	also by accident, in the 1950s,
211.38	from an antihistamine
211.38	that was making people manic,
215.86	imipramine.
218.22	And in both the case of the tuberculosis
218.22	ward and the antihistamine,
221.9	someone had to be able to recognize
223.62	that a drug that was designed
223.62	to do one thing --
226.06	treat tuberculosis
226.06	or suppress allergies --
228.66	could be used to do
228.66	something very different --
231.42	treat depression.
233.38	And this sort of repurposing
233.38	is actually quite challenging.
236.42	When doctors first saw
236.42	this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,
240.38	they didn't really recognize
240.38	what they saw.
242.86	They were so used to thinking about it
244.74	from the framework
244.74	of being a tuberculosis drug
247.54	that they actually just listed it
249.62	as a side effect, an adverse side effect.
252.42	As you can see here,
253.596	a lot of these patients in 1954
253.596	are experiencing severe euphoria.
258.9	And they were worried
258.9	that this might somehow interfere
262.54	with their recovering from tuberculosis.
265.42	So they recommended that iproniazid
265.42	only be used in cases of extreme TB
271.7	and in patients that were
271.7	highly emotionally stable,
276.22	which is of course the exact opposite
276.22	of how we use it as an antidepressant.
280.14	They were so used to looking at it
280.14	from the perspective of this one disease,
284.62	they could not see the larger implications
284.62	for another disease.
289.38	And to be fair,
289.38	it's not entirely their fault.
292.1	Functional fixedness
292.1	is a bias that affects all of us.
294.9	It's a tendency to only
294.9	be able to think of an object
298.38	in terms of its traditional
298.38	use or function.
301.74	And mental set is another thing. Right?
303.66	That's sort of this preconceived framework
305.7	with which we approach problems.
307.5	And that actually makes repurposing
307.5	pretty hard for all of us,
310.78	which is, I guess, why they gave
310.78	a TV show to the guy who was,
314.34	like, really great at repurposing.
316.66	(Laughter)
319.18	So the effects in both the case
319.18	of iproniazid and imipramine,
323.54	they were so strong --
324.94	there was mania,
324.94	or people dancing in the halls.
327.18	It's actually not that surprising
327.18	they were caught.
330.34	But it does make you wonder
330.34	what else we've missed.
335.02	So iproniazid and imipramine,
337.22	they're more than just
337.22	a case study in repurposing.
339.66	They have two other things in common
339.66	that are really important.
342.66	One, they have terrible side effects.
345.18	That includes liver toxicity,
347.82	weight gain of over 50 pounds,
350.82	suicidality.
352.62	And two, they both
352.62	increase levels of serotonin,
356.82	which is a chemical signal in the brain,
359.18	or a neurotransmitter.
361.38	And those two things together,
361.38	right, one or the two,
363.9	may not have been that important,
365.54	but the two together meant
365.54	that we had to develop safer drugs,
369.3	and that serotonin seemed
369.3	like a pretty good place to start.
373.66	So we developed drugs
373.66	to more specifically focus on serotonin,
377.58	the selective serotonin
377.58	reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,
381.26	the most famous of which is Prozac.
384.02	And that was 30 years ago,
386.02	and since then we have mostly
386.02	just worked on optimizing those drugs.
389.74	And the SSRIs, they are better
389.74	than the drugs that came before them,
392.98	but they still have a lot of side effects,
395.1	including weight gain, insomnia,
398.02	suicidality --
400.1	and they take a really long time to work,
402.46	something like four to six weeks
402.46	in a lot of patients.
405.02	And that's in the patients
405.02	where they do work.
407.22	There are a lot of patients
407.22	where these drugs don't work.
410.1	And that means now, in 2016,
413.5	we still have no cures
413.5	for any mood disorders,
417.34	just drugs that suppress symptoms,
419.42	which is kind of the difference between
419.42	taking a painkiller for an infection
423.5	versus an antibiotic.
424.94	A painkiller will make you feel better,
426.82	but is not going to do anything
426.82	to treat that underlying disease.
430.7	And it was this flexibility
430.7	in our thinking
433.06	that let us recognize
433.06	that iproniazid and imipramine
436.02	could be repurposed in this way,
438.14	which led us to the serotonin hypothesis,
440.14	which we then, ironically, fixated on.
443.98	This is brain signaling, serotonin,
446.54	from an SSRI commercial.
447.82	In case you're not clear,
447.82	this is a dramatization.
450.66	And in science, we try
450.66	and remove our bias, right,
454.74	by running double-blinded experiments
457.14	or being statistically agnostic
457.14	as to what our results will be.
460.86	But bias creeps in more insidiously
460.86	in what we choose to study
465.18	and how we choose to study it.
468.26	So we've focused on serotonin now
468.26	for the past 30 years,
471.86	often to the exclusion of other things.
474.86	We still have no cures,
477.18	and what if serotonin
477.18	isn't all there is to depression?
480.62	What if it's not even the key part of it?
482.7	That means no matter how much time
484.9	or money or effort we put into it,
487.66	it will never lead to a cure.
490.5	In the past few years,
490.5	doctors have discovered
493.1	probably what is the first truly new
493.1	antidepressant since the SSRIs,
498.54	Calypsol,
499.86	and this drug works very quickly,
499.86	within a few hours or a day,
503.34	and it doesn't work on serotonin.
505.26	It works on glutamate,
505.26	which is another neurotransmitter.
508.38	And it's also repurposed.
509.9	It was traditionally used
509.9	as anesthesia in surgery.
513.54	But unlike those other drugs,
515.22	which were recognized pretty quickly,
517.06	it took us 20 years
518.78	to realize that Calypsol
518.78	was an antidepressant,
521.46	despite the fact that it's actually
521.46	a better antidepressant,
524.34	probably, than those other drugs.
525.98	It's actually probably because of the fact
525.98	that it's a better antidepressant
530.1	that it was harder for us to recognize.
532.019	There was no mania to signal its effects.
534.58	So in 2013, up at Columbia University,
537.7	I was working with my colleague,
539.3	Dr. Christine Ann Denny,
541.3	and we were studying Calypsol
541.3	as an antidepressant in mice.
545.66	And Calypsol has, like,
545.66	a really short half-life,
548.5	which means it's out of your body
548.5	within a few hours.
551.58	And we were just piloting.
553.02	So we would give an injection to mice,
555.3	and then we'd wait a week,
556.62	and then we'd run
556.62	another experiment to save money.
560.02	And one of the experiments I was running,
562.18	we would stress the mice,
563.86	and we used that as a model of depression.
566.1	And at first it kind of just looked
566.1	like it didn't really work at all.
569.46	So we could have stopped there.
571.54	But I have run this model
571.54	of depression for years,
574.46	and the data just looked kind of weird.
576.38	It didn't really look right to me.
578.26	So I went back,
579.5	and we reanalyzed it
581.02	based on whether or not they had gotten
581.02	that one injection of Calypsol
584.86	a week beforehand.
586.94	And it looked kind of like this.
588.98	So if you look at the far left,
591.14	if you put a mouse in a new space,
593.66	this is the box, it's very exciting,
595.94	a mouse will walk around and explore,
598.1	and you can see that pink line
598.1	is actually the measure of them walking.
602.42	And we also give it
602.42	another mouse in a pencil cup
605.62	that it can decide to interact with.
607.7	This is also a dramatization,
607.7	in case that's not clear.
610.94	And a normal mouse will explore.
614.66	It will be social.
616.62	Check out what's going on.
618.02	If you stress a mouse
618.02	in this depression model,
620.94	which is the middle box,
623.1	they aren't social, they don't explore.
625.02	They mostly just kind of hide
625.02	in that back corner, behind a cup.
629.02	Yet the mice that had gotten
629.02	that one injection of Calypsol,
632.14	here on your right,
634.06	they were exploring, they were social.
636.74	They looked like they
636.74	had never been stressed at all,
640.02	which is impossible.
642.26	So we could have just stopped there,
644.78	but Christine had also used
644.78	Calypsol before as anesthesia,
649.1	and a few years ago she had seen
650.7	that it seemed to have
650.7	some weird effects on cells
653.1	and some other behavior
654.34	that also seemed to last
654.34	long after the drug,
657.38	maybe a few weeks.
658.66	So we were like, OK,
659.94	maybe this is not completely impossible,
662.14	but we were really skeptical.
663.66	So we did what you do in science
663.66	when you're not sure,
666.22	and we ran it again.
668.46	And I remember being in the animal room,
671.5	moving mice from box to box
671.5	to test them,
675.18	and Christine was actually sitting
675.18	on the floor with the computer in her lap
678.82	so the mice couldn't see her,
680.26	and she was analyzing
680.26	the data in real time.
682.54	And I remember us yelling,
683.94	which you're not supposed to do
683.94	in an animal room where you're testing,
687.26	because it had worked.
688.86	It seemed like these mice
688.86	were protected against stress,
693.26	or they were inappropriately happy,
693.26	however you want to call it.
696.34	And we were really excited.
699.82	And then we were really skeptical,
699.82	because it was too good to be true.
703.86	So we ran it again.
705.74	And then we ran it again in a PTSD model,
708.5	and we ran it again
708.5	in a physiological model,
710.94	where all we did was give stress hormones.
713.18	And we had our undergrads run it.
714.82	And then we had our collaborators
714.82	halfway across the world in France run it.
719.78	And every time someone ran it,
719.78	they confirmed the same thing.
723.02	It seemed like
723.02	this one injection of Calypsol
725.86	was somehow protecting
725.86	against stress for weeks.
729.18	And we only published this a year ago,
731.06	but since then other labs
731.06	have independently confirmed this effect.
735.94	So we don't know what causes depression,
738.46	but we do know that stress
738.46	is the initial trigger
742.18	in 80 percent of cases,
744.54	and depression and PTSD
744.54	are different diseases,
746.78	but this is something
746.78	they share in common.
748.82	Right? It is traumatic stress
750.66	like active combat or natural disasters
753.58	or community violence or sexual assault
756.06	that causes post-traumatic
756.06	stress disorder,
758.98	and not everyone that is exposed to stress
758.98	develops a mood disorder.
764.62	And this ability to experience
764.62	stress and be resilient
767.54	and bounce back and not develop
767.54	depression or PTSD
772.5	is known as stress resilience,
774.78	and it varies between people.
776.66	And we have always thought of it
776.66	as just sort of this passive property.
780.02	It's the absence of susceptibility factors
782.58	and risk factors for these disorders.
785.62	But what if it were active?
788.42	Maybe we could enhance it,
789.94	sort of akin to putting on armor.
793.22	We had accidentally discovered
793.22	the first resilience-enhancing drug.
798.74	And like I said, we only gave
798.74	a tiny amount of the drug,
801.54	and it lasted for weeks,
803.14	and that's not like anything
803.14	you see with antidepressants.
806.38	But it is actually kind of similar
806.38	to what you see in immune vaccines.
811.18	So in immune vaccines,
811.18	you'll get your shots,
814.14	and then weeks, months, years later,
817.54	when you're actually exposed to bacteria,
819.9	it's not the vaccine in your body
819.9	that protects you.
822.38	It's your own immune system
823.78	that's developed resistance and resilience
823.78	to this bacteria that fights it off,
827.94	and you actually never get the infection,
830.1	which is very different
830.1	from, say, our treatments. Right?
833.18	In that case, you get the infection,
833.18	you're exposed to the bacteria,
837.02	you're sick, and then you take,
837.02	say, an antibiotic which cures it,
840.9	and those drugs are actually working
840.9	to kill the bacteria.
844.78	Or similar to as I said before,
844.78	with this palliative,
847.3	you'll take something
847.3	that will suppress the symptoms,
850.18	but it won't treat
850.18	the underlying infection,
852.9	and you'll only feel better
852.9	during the time in which you're taking it,
856.26	which is why you have to keep taking it.
858.22	And in depression and PTSD --
860.94	here we have your stress exposure --
862.94	we only have palliative care.
865.58	Antidepressants only suppress symptoms,
868.1	and that is why you basically
868.1	have to keep taking them
870.98	for the life of the disease,
872.7	which is often
872.7	the length of your own life.
875.94	So we're calling our resilience-enhancing
875.94	"drugs ""paravaccines,"""
880.18	which means vaccine-like,
881.74	because it seems
881.74	like they might have the potential
884.26	to protect against stress
886.1	and prevent mice from developing
889.54	depression and post-traumatic
889.54	stress disorder.
892.78	Also, not all antidepressants
892.78	are also paravaccines.
897.3	We tried Prozac as well,
898.94	and that had no effect.
901.06	So if this were to translate into humans,
904.1	we might be able to protect people
906.7	who are predictably at risk
908.98	against stress-induced disorders
908.98	like depression and PTSD.
912.86	So that's first responders
912.86	and firefighters,
916.02	refugees, prisoners and prison guards,
920.18	soldiers, you name it.
923.22	And to give you a sense
923.22	of the scale of these diseases,
927.62	in 2010, the global burden of disease
930.7	was estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,
935.06	and since they are chronic,
936.62	that cost is compounding
936.62	and is therefore expected to rise
939.86	up to six trillion dollars
939.86	in just the next 15 years.
944.46	As I mentioned before,
946.064	repurposing can be challenging
946.064	because of our prior biases.
950.86	Calypsol has another name,
953.1	ketamine,
955.38	which also goes by another name,
957.46	Special K,
958.9	which is a club drug and drug of abuse.
962.54	It's still used across the world
962.54	as an anesthetic.
965.66	It's used in children.
965.66	We use it on the battlefield.
968.54	It's actually the drug of choice
968.54	in a lot of developing nations,
971.54	because it doesn't affect breathing.
973.42	It is on the World Health Organization
973.42	list of most essential medicines.
978.58	If we had discovered ketamine
978.58	as a paravaccine first,
982.82	it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,
985.7	but as is, we have to compete
985.7	with our functional fixedness
989.58	and mental set that kind of interfere.
993.7	Fortunately, it's not
993.7	the only compound we have discovered
997.58	that has these prophylactic,
997.58	paravaccine qualities,
1001.7	but all of the other drugs
1001.7	we've discovered,
1004.78	or compounds if you will,
1004.78	they're totally new,
1006.98	they have to go through
1006.98	the entire FDA approval process --
1010.62	if they make it before
1010.62	they can ever be used in humans.
1014.22	And that will be years.
1015.9	So if we wanted something sooner,
1018.18	ketamine is already FDA-approved.
1020.58	It's generic, it's available.
1023.3	We could develop it for a fraction
1023.3	of the price and a fraction of the time.
1028.38	But actually, beyond
1028.38	functional fixedness and mental set,
1032.78	there's a real other challenge
1032.78	to repurposing drugs,
1036.38	which is policy.
1038.179	There are no incentives in place
1040.419	once a drug is generic and off patent
1040.419	and no longer exclusive
1044.179	to encourage pharma companies
1044.179	to develop them,
1046.54	because they don't make money.
1048.38	And that's not true for just ketamine.
1048.38	That is true for all drugs.
1052.579	Regardless, the idea itself
1052.579	is completely novel in psychiatry,
1058.26	to use drugs to prevent mental illness
1062.18	as opposed to just treat it.
1064.74	It is possible that 20, 50,
1069.82	we will look back now
1069.82	at depression and PTSD
1073.94	the way we look back
1073.94	at tuberculosis sanitoriums
1077.18	as a thing of the past.
1079.18	This could be the beginning of the end
1079.18	of the mental health epidemic.
1085.38	But as a great scientist once said,
1089.9	"""Only a fool is sure of anything."
1092.18	"A wise man keeps on guessing."""
1096.044	Thank you, guys.
