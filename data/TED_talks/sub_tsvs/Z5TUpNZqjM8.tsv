18.964	Let's talk about manias.
23.021	Let's start with Beatlemania.
25.003	(Recording of crowd roaring)
27.203	Hysterical teenagers,
29.33	crying, screaming, pandemonium.
32.525	(Recording of crowd roaring)
35.818	Sports mania:
37.33	deafening crowds,
40.33	all for one idea --
40.33	get the ball in the net.
44.625	(Recording) Goal!
46.33	Okay, religious mania:
48.33	there's rapture, there's weeping,
51.33	there's visions.
53.33	Manias can be good.
55.338	Manias can be alarming.
58.436	Or manias can be deadly.
60.645	(Recording of crowd cheering)
64.33	The world has a new mania.
66.33	A mania for learning English.
68.962	Listen as Chinese students
68.962	practice their English,
72.504	by screaming it:
74.33	Teacher: ... change my life!
76.45	Students: I want to change my life!
78.885	T: I don't want to let my parents down!
81.972	S: I don't want to let my parents down!
85.33	T: I don't ever want
85.33	to let my country down!
88.698	S: I don't ever want
88.698	to let my country down!
92.33	T: Most importantly...
92.33	S: Most importantly...
95.893	T: I don't want to let myself down!
98.601	S: I don't want to let myself down!
101.33	How many people
101.33	are trying to learn English worldwide?
104.497	Two billion of them.
107.02	Students: A t-shirt. A dress.
111.157	Jay Walker: In Latin America,
112.8	in India,
114.474	in Southeast Asia,
116.125	and most of all, in China.
118.901	If you're a Chinese student,
120.33	you start learning English
120.33	in the third grade, by law.
125.774	That's why this year,
127.544	China will become the world's largest
127.544	English-speaking country.
132.613	(Laughter)
134.56	Why English?
135.902	In a single word: opportunity.
138.091	Opportunity for a better life, a job,
140.917	to be able to pay for school,
140.917	or put better food on the table.
144.33	Imagine a student taking
144.33	a giant test for three full days.
148.893	Her score on this one test
148.893	literally determines her future.
153.37	She studies 12 hours a day
155.878	for three years to prepare.
158.642	Twenty-five percent of her grade
158.642	is based on English.
163.594	It's called the gaokao, and 80 million
163.594	high school Chinese students
168.309	have already taken this grueling test.
170.705	The intensity to learn English
172.998	is almost unimaginable,
172.998	unless you witness it.
176.949	Teacher: Perfect!
176.949	Students: Perfect!
178.76	T: Perfect!
178.76	S: Perfect!
181.33	T: I want to speak perfect English!
183.774	S: I want to speak perfect English!
186.095	T: I want to speak ...
186.095	S: I want to speak ...
188.402	T: ... perfect English!
188.402	S: ... perfect English!
191.172	T (yelling more loudly):
191.172	I want to change my life!
194.33	S (yelling more loudly):
194.33	I want to change my life!
198.306	JW: So is English mania good or bad?
201.33	Is English a tsunami,
201.33	washing away other languages?
205.663	Not likely.
206.909	English is the world's second language.
209.83	Your native language is your life.
211.925	But with English you can become
211.925	part of a wider conversation --
215.885	a global conversation
215.885	about global problems,
219.615	like climate change or poverty,
222.33	or hunger or disease.
225.33	The world has other universal languages.
228.829	Mathematics is the language of science.
231.885	Music is the language of emotions.
234.901	And now English is becoming
234.901	the language of problem-solving.
239.33	Not because America is pushing it,
241.568	but because the world is pulling it.
245.195	So English mania is a turning point.
248.453	Like the harnessing
248.453	of electricity in our cities,
251.025	or the fall of the Berlin Wall,
253.33	English represents hope
255.716	for a better future --
257.33	a future where the world
257.33	has a common language
261.33	to solve its common problems.
264.368	Thank you very much.
265.552	(Applause)
