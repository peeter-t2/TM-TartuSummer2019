12.544	By 2010, Detroit had become the poster child
15.571	for an American city in crisis.
17.712	There was a housing collapse,
19.584	an auto industry collapse,
21.542	and the population had plummeted by 25 percent
24.094	between 2000 and 2010,
26.516	and many people were beginning to write it off,
28.733	as it had topped the list of American shrinking cities.
32.459	By 2010, I had also been asked by
34.846	the Kresge Foundation and the city of Detroit
37.046	to join them in leading a citywide planning process
40.3	for the city to create a shared vision for its future.
43.774	I come to this work
45.245	as an architect and an urban planner,
47.062	and I've spent my career working
47.062	in other contested cities,
49.668	like Chicago, my hometown;
51.524	Harlem, which is my current home;
53.53	Washington, D.C.; and Newark, New Jersey.
56.556	All of these cities, to me, still had a number
58.936	of unresolved issues related to urban justice,
61.772	issues of equity, inclusion and access.
66.124	Now by 2010, as well,
68.187	popular design magazines were also beginning
70.202	to take a closer look at cities like Detroit,
72.915	"and devoting whole issues to ""fixing the city."""
76.552	I was asked by a good friend, Fred Bernstein,
78.928	to do an interview for the October issue
80.903	of Architect magazine,
82.554	and he and I kind of had a good chuckle
84.209	when we saw the magazine released with the title,
87.425	"""Can This Planner Save Detroit?"""
90.311	So I'm smiling with a little bit
90.311	of embarrassment right now,
93.186	because obviously, it's completely absurd
95.593	that a single person, let alone a planner,
97.565	could save a city.
99.023	But I'm also smiling because I thought it represented
101.524	a sense of hopefulness that our profession
104.158	could play a role in helping the city to think about
107.076	how it would recover from its severe crisis.
111.14	So I'd like to spend a little bit of time this afternoon
113.412	and tell you a little bit about our process
115.093	for fixing the city, a little bit about Detroit,
117.769	and I want to do that through
117.769	the voices of Detroiters.
120.883	So we began our process in September of 2010.
123.951	It's just after a special mayoral election,
126.88	and word has gotten out that there is going to be
128.921	this citywide planning process,
130.465	which brings a lot of anxiety and fears
132.814	among Detroiters.
134.602	We had planned to hold a number
134.602	of community meetings in rooms like this
138.842	to introduce the planning process,
141.226	and people came out from all over the city,
143.222	including areas that were stable neighborhoods,
146.073	as well as areas that were beginning to see
147.849	a lot of vacancy.
149.843	And most of our audience was representative
151.941	of the 82 percent African-American population
154.494	in the city at that time.
156.759	So obviously, we have a Q&amp;A portion of our program,
160.247	and people line up to mics to ask questions.
163.144	Many of them step very firmly to the mic,
165.903	put their hands across their chest, and go,
168.751	"""I know you people are trying to"
168.751	"move me out of my house, right?"""
172.23	So that question is really powerful,
174.549	and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment,
177.762	when you connect it to the stories
179.871	that some Detroiters had,
181.258	and actually a lot of African-Americans'
183.464	families have had
184.921	that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.
188.652	Many of them told us the stories about
190.987	how they came to own their home
192.447	through their grandparents or great-grandparents,
194.611	who were one of 1.6 million people who migrated
197.485	from the rural South to the industrial North,
200.178	as depicted in this painting by Jacob Lawrence,
202.526	"""The Great Migration."""
204.152	They came to Detroit for a better way of life.
207.395	Many found work in the automobile industry,
209.999	the Ford Motor Company, as depicted in this mural
212.4	by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Art.
216.455	The fruits of their labors would afford them a home,
219.43	for many the first piece of property
219.43	that they would ever know,
222.311	and a community with other first-time
224.174	African-American home buyers.
226.303	The first couple of decades of their life in the North
228.683	is quite well, up until about 1950,
231.727	which coincides with the city's peak population
234.335	at 1.8 million people.
236.642	Now it's at this time that Detroit begins to see
239.02	a second kind of migration,
241.238	a migration to the suburbs.
243.571	Between 1950 and 2000,
246.408	the region grows by 30 percent.
249.343	But this time, the migration leaves
251.242	African-Americans in place,
253.347	as families and businesses flee the city,
256.293	leaving the city pretty desolate of people
258.655	as well as jobs.
260.409	During that same period, between
265.209	the city loses 60 percent of its population,
268.074	and today it hovers at above 700,000.
271.998	The audience members who come
271.998	and talk to us that night
274.484	tell us the stories of what it's like to live in a city
277.269	with such depleted population.
279.986	Many tell us that they're one of only a few homes
282.336	on their block that are occupied,
284.879	and that they can see several abandoned homes
287.486	from where they sit on their porches.
289.733	Citywide, there are 80,000 vacant homes.
294.072	They can also see vacant property.
297.087	They're beginning to see illegal activities
298.944	on these properties, like illegal dumping,
301.168	and they know that because the city
301.168	has lost so much population,
305.473	their costs for water, electricity, gas are rising,
310.64	because there are not enough people
310.64	to pay property taxes
313.482	to help support the services that they need.
316.816	Citywide, there are about 100,000 vacant parcels.
321.073	Now, to quickly give you all a sense of a scale,
323.067	because I know that sounds like a big number,
324.417	but I don't think you quite understand
324.417	until you look at the city map.
326.955	So the city is 139 square miles.
329.661	You can fit Boston, San Francisco,
331.707	and the island of Manhattan
333.267	within its footprint.
334.943	So if we take all of that vacant
334.943	and abandoned property
337.333	and we smush it together,
339.529	it looks like about 20 square miles,
341.365	and that's roughly equivalent to the size
343.333	of the island we're sitting on today, Manhattan,
345.04	at 22 square miles.
346.49	So it's a lot of vacancy.
350.09	Now some of our audience members
352.266	also tell us about some of the positive things
354.384	that are happening in their communities,
356.429	and many of them are banding together
358.016	to take control of some of the vacant lots,
360.122	and they're starting community gardens,
361.991	which are creating a great sense
361.991	of community stewardship,
364.666	but they're very, very clear to tell us
366.661	that this is not enough,
368.452	that they want to see their neighborhoods
369.958	return to the way that their
369.958	grandparents had found them.
373.311	Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010
375.754	about what to do with the vacant property,
378.43	and a lot of that speculation has
378.43	been around community gardening,
381.15	or what we call urban agriculture.
383.382	So many people would say to us,
384.96	"""What if you just take all that vacant land"
384.96	and you could make it farmland?
387.668	It can provide fresh foods,
389.771	"and it can put Detroiters back to work too."""
392.476	When I hear that story,
393.921	I always imagine the folks from the Great Migration
396.537	rolling over in their graves,
398.791	because you can imagine that they didn't sacrifice
402.108	moving from the South to the North
404.185	to create a better life for their families,
406.297	only to see their great-grandchildren
406.297	return to an agrarian lifestyle,
410.543	especially in a city where they came
412.751	with little less than a high school education
414.805	or even a grammar school education
416.772	and were able to afford the basic elements
418.797	of the American dream:
420.086	steady work and a home that they owned.
424.121	Now, there's a third wave of migration
426.352	happening in Detroit:
427.912	a new ascendant of cultural entrepreneurs.
431.056	These folks see that same vacant land
433.472	and those same abandoned homes
434.967	as opportunity for new,
436.362	entrepreneurial ideas and profit,
439.033	so much so that former models
441.02	can move to Detroit,
442.441	buy property, start successful
444.762	businesses and restaurants,
446.439	and become successful community
446.439	activists in their neighborhood,
449.419	bringing about very positive change.
452.441	Similarly, we have small manufacturing companies
455.345	making conscious decisions to relocate to the city.
458.614	This company, Shinola, which is a luxury watch
461.399	and bicycle company,
463.111	deliberately chose to relocate to Detroit,
465.004	and they quote themselves by saying
467.641	they were drawn to the global brand 
467.641	of Detroit's innovation.
471.899	And they also knew that 
471.899	they can tap into a workforce
474.471	that was still very skilled in how to make things.
477.997	Now we have community stewardship
480.566	happening in neighborhoods,
482.126	we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions
484.925	to move to the city and create enterprises,
487.973	and we have businesses relocating,
489.708	and this is all in the context
491.094	of what is no secret to us all,
493.366	a city that's under the control
495.167	of an emergency manager,
496.789	and just this July filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy.
501.063	So 2010, we started this process, and by 2013,
504.305	we released Detroit Future City,
506.389	which was our strategic plan to guide the city
509.227	into a better and more prosperous
511.046	and more sustainable existence --
513.323	not what it was, but what it could be,
516.988	looking at new ways of economic growth,
520.303	new forms of land use,
522.284	more sustainable and denser neighborhoods,
525.392	a reconfigured infrastructure
525.392	and city service system,
528.808	and a heightened capacity for civic leaders
531.676	to take action and implement change.
534.938	Three key imperatives were really important
537.536	to our work.
538.817	One was that the city itself
538.817	wasn't necessarily too large,
542.695	but the economy was too small.
544.383	There are only 27 jobs per 100 people in Detroit,
547.643	very different from a Denver
547.643	or an Atlanta or a Philadelphia
551.041	that are anywhere between 
555.961	Secondly, there had to be an acceptance
558.383	that we were not going to be able to use
560.339	all of this vacant land in the way that we had before
563.203	and maybe for some time to come.
565.212	It wasn't going to be our traditional
565.212	residential neighborhoods
567.777	as we had before,
569.394	and urban agriculture, while a very productive
572.152	and successful intervention happening in Detroit,
574.844	was not the only answer,
576.947	that what we had to do is look at these areas
579.383	where we had significant vacancy
581.191	but still had a significant number of population
584.426	of what could be new, productive, innovative,
587.324	and entrepreneurial uses
588.858	that could stabilize those communities,
590.813	where still nearly 300,000 residents lived.
594.181	So we came up with one neighborhood typology --
596.997	there are several --
596.997	called a live-make neighborhood,
599.97	where folks could reappropriate
601.929	abandoned structures
603.667	and turn them into entrepreneurial enterprises,
605.957	with a specific emphasis on looking at the, again,
609.04	majority 82 percent African-American population.
612.225	So they, too, could take businesses
614.326	that they maybe were doing out of their home
616.725	and grow them to more prosperous industries
619.436	and actually acquire property so they were actually
622.146	property owners as well as business owners
624.595	in the communities with which they resided.
627.121	Then we also wanted to look at other ways
629.199	of using land in addition to growing food
632.533	and transforming landscape into
634.357	much more productive uses,
636.217	so that it could be used for storm
636.217	water management, for example,
639.507	by using surface lakes and retention ponds,
642.523	that created neighborhood amenities,
644.283	places of recreation,
645.975	and actually helped to elevate
647.792	adjacent property levels.
649.479	Or we could use it as research plots,
651.339	where we can use it to remediate contaminated soils,
654.647	or we could use it to generate energy.
658.613	So the descendants of the Great Migration
661.811	could either become precision
661.811	watchmakers at Shinola,
665.055	like Willie H., who was featured
665.055	in one of their ads last year,
668.366	or they can actually grow a business
670.758	that would service companies like Shinola.
673.483	The good news is, there is a future
675.485	for the next generation of Detroiters,
678.044	both those there now and those that want to come.
681.208	So no thank you, Mayor Menino,
683.339	who recently was quoted as saying,
684.982	"""I'd blow up the place and start over."""
687.597	There are very important people,
689.948	business and land assets in Detroit,
692.349	and there are real opportunities there.
694.145	So while Detroit might not be what it was,
696.768	Detroit will not die.
698.387	Thank you.
700.41	(Applause)
