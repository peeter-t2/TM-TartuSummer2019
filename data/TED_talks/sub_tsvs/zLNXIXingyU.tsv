12.69	Chris Anderson: We had Edward Snowden here
14.86	a couple days ago,
16.398	and this is response time.
18.741	And several of you have written to me
20.996	with questions to ask our guest here from the NSA.
25.639	So Richard Ledgett is the 15th deputy director
27.987	of the National Security Agency,
30.552	and he's a senior civilian officer there,
33.838	acts as its chief operating officer,
35.823	guiding strategies, setting internal policies,
39.093	and serving as the principal advisor to the director.
43.473	And all being well,
45.349	welcome, Rick Ledgett, to TED.
48.865	(Applause)
55.535	Richard Ledgett: I'm really thankful for the opportunity to talk to folks here.
59.283	I look forward to the conversation,
61.237	so thanks for arranging for that.
64.219	CA: Thank you, Rick.
65.757	We appreciate you joining us.
68.324	It's certainly quite a strong statement
70.491	that the NSA is willing to reach out
72.478	and show a more open face here.
76.475	You saw, I think,
78.428	the talk and interview that Edward Snowden
82.321	gave here a couple days ago.
83.265	What did you make of it?
85.704	RL: So I think it was interesting.
88.855	We didn't realize that he 
88.855	was going to show up there,
91.742	so kudos to you guys for arranging
94.875	a nice surprise like that.
97.578	I think that, like a lot of the things
102.951	that have come out since Mr. Snowden
107.47	started disclosing classified information,
110.035	there were some kernels of truth in there,
113.501	but a lot of extrapolations and half-truths in there,
116.995	and I'm interested in helping to address those.
119.518	I think this is a really important conversation
121.838	that we're having in the United States
123.37	and internationally,
124.885	and I think it is important and of import,
129.294	and so given that, we need to have that be
132.754	a fact-based conversation,
134.154	and we want to help make that happen.
136.606	CA: So the question that a lot 
136.606	of people have here is,
141.223	what do you make of Snowden's motivations
144.137	for doing what he did,
146.388	and did he have an alternative
146.388	way that he could have gone?
150.878	RL: He absolutely did
153.217	have alternative ways that he could have gone,
157.415	and I actually think that characterizing him
163.009	as a whistleblower
164.999	actually hurts legitimate whistleblowing activities.
168.527	So what if somebody who works in the NSA --
172.098	and there are over 35,000 people who do.
175.102	They're all great citizens.
177.455	They're just like your husbands, fathers, sisters,
179.758	brothers, neighbors, nephews, friends and relatives,
183.975	all of whom are interested in doing the right thing
186.145	for their country
187.332	and for our allies internationally,
190.366	and so there are a variety of venues to address
194.448	if folks have a concern.
195.622	First off, there's their supervisor,
197.545	and up through the supervisory chain
200.237	within their organization.
201.979	If folks aren't comfortable with that,
203.626	there are a number of inspectors general.
205.981	In the case of Mr. Snowden, he had the option
209.522	of the NSA inspector general,
211.447	the Navy inspector general,
212.767	the Pacific Command inspector general,
214.334	the Department of Defense inspector general,
216.244	and the intelligence community inspector general,
218.35	any of whom would have both kept
218.35	his concerns in classified channels
222.668	and been happy to address them.
225.299	(CA and RL speaking at once)
227.576	He had the option to go to
227.576	congressional committees,
230.179	and there are mechanisms
230.179	to do that that are in place,
233.298	and so he didn't do any of those things.
235.837	CA: Now, you had said that
238.827	Ed Snowden had other avenues
241.056	for raising his concerns.
243.751	The comeback on that is a couple of things:
247.077	one, that he certainly believes that as a contractor,
250.887	the avenues that would have been available
250.887	to him as an employee weren't available,
254.648	two, there's a track record of other whistleblowers,
258.079	like [Thomas Andrews Drake] being treated
260.69	pretty harshly, by some views,
263.837	and thirdly, what he was taking on
265.49	was not one specific flaw that he'd discovered,
268.827	but programs that had been approved
270.798	by all three branches of government.
273.739	I mean, in that circumstance,
276.538	couldn't you argue that what he did
278.941	was reasonable?
281.207	RL: No, I don't agree with that.
283.52	I think that the —
287.257	sorry, I'm getting feedback
289.392	through the microphone there —
292.949	the actions that he took were inappropriate
297.776	because of the fact that 
297.776	he put people's lives at risk,
302.551	basically, in the long run,
304.023	and I know there's been a lot of talk
305.587	in public by Mr. Snowden
305.587	and some of the journalists
310.251	that say that the things that have been disclosed
313.681	have not put national security and people at risk,
317.876	and that is categorically not true.
322.17	They actually do.
324.077	I think there's also an amazing arrogance
326.918	to the idea that he knows better than
331.053	the framers of the Constitution
334.348	in how the government should 
334.348	be designed and work
336.727	for separation of powers
338.869	and the fact that the executive 
338.869	and the legislative branch
345.316	have to work together and they have
345.316	checks and balances on each other,
347.927	and then the judicial branch,
349.461	which oversees the entire process.
350.897	I think that's extremely arrogant on his part.
355.118	CA: Can you give a specific example
357.424	of how he put people's lives at risk?
360.88	RL: Yeah, sure.
362.877	So the things that he's disclosed,
366.271	the capabilities,
367.786	and the NSA is a capabilities-based organization,
370.228	so when we have foreign intelligence targets,
374.102	legitimate things of interest --
375.733	like, terrorists is the iconic example,
377.743	but it includes things like human traffickers,
380.837	drug traffickers,
382.699	people who are trying to build
382.699	advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,
386.663	and build delivery systems for those,
388.626	and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,
392.257	which you may have some visibility
394.851	into some of that that's going on right now,
397.605	the capabilities are applied
401.567	in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.
406.568	So the unconstrained disclosure 
406.568	of those capabilities
409.356	means that as adversaries see them
411.64	"and recognize, ""Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,"""
414.003	they move away from that,
415.57	and we have seen targets in terrorism,
418.779	in the nation-state area,
420.911	in smugglers of various types, and other folks
423.913	who have, because of the disclosures,
425.866	moved away from our ability
428.801	to have insight into what they're doing.
430.889	The net effect of that is that our people
433.853	who are overseas in dangerous places,
435.746	whether they're diplomats or military,
437.61	and our allies who are in similar situations,
440.201	are at greater risk because we don't see
443.06	the threats that are coming their way.
446.011	CA: So that's a general response saying that
448.07	because of his revelations,
450.167	access that you had to certain types of information
453.033	has been shut down, has been closed down.
456.604	But the concern is that the nature of that access
460.153	was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.
463.857	I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program
466.639	where it's alleged that the NSA
468.768	specifically weakened security
471.153	in order to get the type of 
471.153	access that you've spoken of.
475.722	RL: So there are, when our
480.863	legitimate foreign intelligence targets
480.863	of the type that I described before,
483.575	use the global telecommunications system
486.611	as their communications methodology,
488.694	and they do, because it's a great system,
490.108	it's the most complex system ever devised by man,
492.946	and it is a wonder,
494.593	and lots of folks in the room there
496.197	are responsible for the creation
498.548	and enhancement of that,
499.917	and it's just a wonderful thing.
502.79	But it's also used by people who are
505.287	working against us and our allies.
507.318	And so if I'm going to pursue them,
509.749	I need to have the capability
511.484	to go after them,
513.659	and again, the controls are in
516.485	how I apply that capability,
519.006	not that I have the capability itself.
521.252	Otherwise, if we could make it so that
523.024	all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,
525.21	we could have a domain, badguy.com.
527.166	That would be awesome,
528.66	and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.
530.802	That's not how it works.
532.134	They're trying to hide
534.345	from the government's ability
536.15	to isolate and interdict their actions,
539.433	and so we have to swim in that same space.
542.245	But I will tell you this.
543.847	So NSA has two missions.
545.326	One is the Signals Intelligence mission
546.776	that we've unfortunately read so
546.776	much about in the press.
550.403	The other one is the Information Assurance mission,
552.141	which is to protect the national security
552.141	systems of the United States,
555.052	and by that, that's things like
557.02	the communications that the president uses,
559.036	the communications that
559.036	control our nuclear weapons,
561.641	the communications that our
561.641	military uses around the world,
563.91	and the communications that we use with our allies,
566.401	and that some of our allies themselves use.
568.125	And so we make recommendations
568.125	on standards to use,
573.962	and we use those same standards,
575.789	and so we are invested
577.667	in making sure that those communications
579.912	are secure for their intended purposes.
583.525	CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that
585.474	when it comes to the Internet at large,
589.219	any strategy is fair game
591.846	if it improves America's safety.
594.762	And I think this is partly where there is such
596.82	a divide of opinion,
598.205	that there's a lot of people in this room
599.455	and around the world
600.828	who think very differently about the Internet.
602.478	They think of it as a momentous
605.465	invention of humanity,
607.063	kind of on a par with the
607.063	Gutenberg press, for example.
610.227	It's the bringer of knowledge to all.
612.682	It's the connector of all.
614.386	And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.
617.771	And from that lens,
619.344	what the NSA has done is equivalent to
621.941	the authorities back in Germany
624.101	inserting some device into every printing press
626.97	that would reveal which books people bought
630.511	and what they read.
632.531	Can you understand that from that viewpoint,
634.762	it feels outrageous?
638.967	RL: I do understand that, and I actually share
638.967	the view of the utility of the Internet,
642.269	and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
643.971	It is a global telecommunications system.
646.382	The Internet is a big chunk of 
646.382	that, but there is a lot more.
648.833	And I think that people have legitimate concerns
652.176	about the balance between
652.176	transparency and secrecy.
658.482	That's sort of been couched as a balance
660.422	between privacy and national security.
664.058	I don't think that's the right framing.
665.478	I think it really is transparency and secrecy.
667.843	And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,
671.402	and we want to participate in that, and want
672.801	people to participate in it in an informed way.
675.241	So there are things,
677.152	let me talk there a little bit more,
678.602	there are things that we need
678.602	to be transparent about:
682.371	our authorities, our processes,
684.398	our oversight, who we are.
686.452	We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,
688.218	and I think that's part of the reason
689.606	that this has been so revelational
692.335	and so sensational in the media.
694.531	Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.
698.657	There's takeoffs of our logo
701.306	of an eagle with headphones on around it.
704.325	And so that's the public characterization.
707.948	And so we need to be more
707.948	transparent about those things.
712.284	What we don't need to be transparent about,
713.702	because it's bad for the U.S.,
716.04	it's bad for all those other
716.04	countries that we work with
718.623	and that we help provide information
720.716	that helps them secure themselves
722.438	and their people,
723.947	it's bad to expose operations and capabilities
727.837	in a way that allows the people
727.837	that we're all working against,
733.129	the generally recognized bad guys,
738.092	to counter those.
740.392	CA: But isn't it also bad to deal
743.417	a kind of body blow to the American companies
746.821	that have essentially given the world
748.717	most of the Internet services that matter?
753.897	RL: It is. It's really the companies are
757.289	in a tough position, as are we,
760.677	because the companies,
762.618	we compel them to provide information,
764.95	just like every other nation in the world does.
766.933	Every industrialized nation in the world
770.207	has a lawful intercept program
772.307	where they are requiring companies
774.805	to provide them with information
776.216	that they need for their security,
777.871	and the companies that are involved
780.098	have complied with those programs
781.526	in the same way that they have to do
783.144	when they're operating in Russia or the U.K.
786.594	or China or India or France,
790.88	any country that you choose to name.
792.898	And so the fact that these revelations
797.807	have been broadly characterized as
800.101	"""you can't trust company A because"
801.991	"your privacy is suspect with them"""
805.506	is actually only accurate in the sense that
809.547	it's accurate with every other company in the world
812.283	that deals with any of those countries in the world.
814.442	And so it's being picked up by people
816.57	as a marketing advantage,
818.164	and it's being marketed that 
818.164	way by several countries,
819.937	including some of our allied countries,
821.448	where they are saying,
822.95	"""Hey, you can't trust the U.S.,"
824.479	but you can trust our telecom company,
827.065	"because we're safe."""
828.419	And they're actually using that to counter
830.078	the very large technological edge
832.396	that U.S. companies have
834.205	in areas like the cloud and
834.205	Internet-based technologies.
838.111	CA: You're sitting there with the American flag,
841.118	and the American Constitution guarantees
844.688	freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
847.535	How do you characterize
849.496	the American citizen's right to privacy?
853.976	Is there such a right?
856.257	RL: Yeah, of course there is.
858.993	And we devote an inordinate
858.993	amount of time and pressure,
862.036	inordinate and appropriate, actually I should say,
864.32	amount of time and effort in order to ensure
866.528	that we protect that privacy.
868.86	and beyond that, the privacy of citizens
871.917	around the world, it's not just Americans.
875.566	Several things come into play here.
877.466	First, we're all in the same network.
879.214	My communications,
880.788	I'm a user of a particular Internet email service
884.935	that is the number one email service of choice
888.906	by terrorists around the world, number one.
890.499	So I'm there right beside them in email space
893.224	in the Internet.
895.113	And so we need to be able to pick that apart
898.705	and find the information that's relevant.
905.131	In doing so, we're going to necessarily encounter
908.493	Americans and innocent foreign citizens
910.561	who are just going about their business,
912.107	and so we have procedures in
912.107	place that shreds that out,
914.805	that says, when you find that,
917.02	not if you find it, when you find it,
917.02	because you're certain to find it,
919.287	here's how you protect that.
921.07	These are called minimization procedures.
923.175	They're approved by the attorney general
925.203	and constitutionally based.
926.803	And so we protect those.
929.283	And then, for people, citizens of the world
933.754	who are going about their lawful business
935.633	on a day-to-day basis,
937.34	the president on his January 17 speech,
939.636	laid out some additional protections
941.129	that we are providing to them.
943.188	So I think absolutely,
945.06	folks do have a right to privacy,
946.595	and that we work very hard to make sure
949.214	that that right to privacy is protected.
952.02	CA: What about foreigners using
953.756	American companies' Internet services?
955.906	Do they have any privacy rights?
959.751	RL: They do. They do, in the sense of,
962.424	the only way that we are able to compel
968.164	one of those companies to provide us information
970.49	is when it falls into one of three categories:
973.952	We can identify that this particular person,
977.504	identified by a selector of some kind,
979.894	is associated with counterterrorist
983.25	or proliferation or other foreign intelligence target.
988.499	CA: Much has been made of the fact that
990.281	a lot of the information that you've obtained
992.747	through these programs is essentially metadata.
995.023	It's not necessarily the actual words
997.318	that someone has written in an email
998.971	or given on a phone call.
1000.32	It's who they wrote to and when, and so forth.
1004.369	But it's been argued,
1005.905	and someone here in the audience has talked
1008.016	to a former NSA analyst who said
1010.483	metadata is actually much more invasive
1012.87	than the core data,
1014.273	because in the core data
1015.406	you present yourself as you want to be presented.
1018.633	With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are
1021.339	that are drawn?
1022.755	Is there anything to that?
1024.761	RL: I don't really understand that argument.
1026.55	I think that metadata's important
1026.55	for a couple of reasons.
1029.45	Metadata is the information that lets you
1033.928	find connections that people are trying to hide.
1037.319	So when a terrorist is corresponding
1039.33	with somebody else who's not known to us
1041.175	but is engaged in doing or
1041.175	supporting terrorist activity,
1043.783	or someone who's violating international sanctions
1046.209	by providing nuclear weapons-related material
1049.286	to a country like Iran or North Korea,
1051.612	is trying to hide that activity
1051.612	because it's illicit activity.
1055.189	What metadata lets you do is connect that.
1057.999	The alternative to that
1059.531	is one that's much less efficient
1061.15	and much more invasive of privacy,
1062.531	which is gigantic amounts of content collection.
1066.367	So metadata, in that sense,
1067.76	actually is privacy-enhancing.
1070.156	And we don't, contrary to some of the stuff
1072.261	that's been printed,
1073.976	we don't sit there and grind out
1076.745	metadata profiles of average people.
1079.582	If you're not connected
1081.538	to one of those valid intelligence targets,
1084.59	you are not of interest to us.
1088.003	CA: So in terms of the threats
1091.175	that face America overall,
1093.487	where would you place terrorism?
1096.699	RL: I think terrorism is still number one.
1099.797	I think that we have never been in a time
1103.701	where there are more places
1105.692	where things are going badly
1108.545	and forming the petri dish in which terrorists
1112.446	take advantage of the lack of governance.
1117.756	An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,
1121.393	used to describe it as arcs of instability.
1123.606	And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability
1125.974	in the world right now,
1127.667	in places like Syria, where there's a civil war
1129.504	going on and you have massive numbers,
1132.214	thousands and thousands of foreign fighters
1133.949	who are coming into Syria
1135.682	to learn how to be terrorists
1137.185	and practice that activity,
1139.286	and lots of those people are Westerners
1141.985	who hold passports to European countries
1145.714	or in some cases the United States,
1147.466	and so they are basically learning how
1149.867	to do jihad and have expressed intent
1153.347	to go out and do that later on
1155.76	in their home countries.
1157.427	You've got places like Iraq,
1158.748	which is suffering from a high
1158.748	level of sectarian violence,
1161.53	again a breeding ground for terrorism.
1164.181	And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa
1166.687	and the Sahel area of Africa.
1169.734	Again, lots of weak governance
1172.262	which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.
1176.153	So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.
1178.147	I think number two is cyber threat.
1180.401	I think cyber is a threat in three ways:
1186.165	One way, and probably the most common way
1189.919	that people have heard about it,
1192.111	is due to the theft of intellectual property,
1194.111	so basically, foreign countries going in,
1198.415	stealing companies' secrets,
1200.292	and then providing that information
1202.29	to state-owned enterprises
1204.027	or companies connected to the government
1206.976	to help them leapfrog technology
1209.479	or to gain business intelligence
1211.554	that's then used to win contracts overseas.
1214.222	That is a hugely costly set of
1214.222	activities that's going on right now.
1217.961	Several nation-states are doing it.
1219.428	Second is the denial-of-service attacks.
1222.653	You're probably aware that there have been
1224.032	a spate of those directed against
1226.003	the U.S. financial sector since 2012.
1229.591	Again, that's a nation-state who
1229.591	is executing those attacks,
1232.208	and they're doing that
1233.281	as a semi-anonymous way of reprisal.
1238.034	And the last one is destructive attacks,
1239.424	and those are the ones that concern me the most.
1240.95	Those are on the rise.
1242.35	You have the attack against Saudi Aramco in 2012,
1245.98	August of 2012.
1247.67	It took down about 35,000 of their computers
1249.955	with a Wiper-style virus.
1251.747	You had a follow-on a week later
1253.66	to a Qatari company.
1255.194	You had March of 2013,
1257.335	you had a South Korean attack
1260.006	that was attributed in the press to North Korea
1262.439	that took out thousands of computers.
1264.494	Those are on the rise,
1265.939	and we see people expressing interest
1268.673	in those capabilities
1269.849	and a desire to employ them.
1271.866	CA: Okay, so a couple of things here,
1273.432	because this is really the core of this, almost.
1275.374	I mean, first of all,
1276.638	a lot of people who look at risk
1278.196	and look at the numbers
1279.413	don't understand this belief that terrorism
1281.673	is still the number one threat.
1283.557	Apart from September 11,
1285.185	I think the numbers are that
1285.185	in the last 30 or 40 years
1287.54	about 500 Americans have died from terrorism,
1290.641	mostly from homegrown terrorists.
1294.624	The chance in the last few years
1296.211	of being killed by terrorism
1297.934	is far less than the chance
1297.934	of being killed by lightning.
1301.918	I guess you would say that a single nuclear incident
1305.324	or bioterrorism act or something like that
1308.65	would change those numbers.
1310.551	Would that be the point of view?
1312.713	RL: Well, I'd say two things.
1313.889	One is, the reason that there hasn't been
1315.815	a major attack in the United States since 9/11,
1317.625	that is not an accident.
1319.181	That's a lot of hard work that we have done,
1321.367	that other folks
1322.748	in the intelligence community have done,
1324.131	that the military has done,
1325.312	and that our allies around the globe have done.
1327.36	You've heard the numbers about
1329.811	the tip of the iceberg in terms
1332.343	of numbers of terrorist attacks that NSA programs
1334.913	contributed to stopping was 54,
1339.494	and of those 25,
1344.229	some of which are our allies,
1346.092	and some of which are beating the heck out of us
1348.291	over the NSA programs, by the way.
1352.768	So that's not an accident that those things happen.
1355.46	That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence
1357.785	on terrorist activities
1359.615	and interdicting them through one way or another,
1361.189	through law enforcement,
1362.52	through cooperative activities with other countries
1365.35	and sometimes through military action.
1368.466	The other thing I would say is that
1371.359	your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat
1376.625	is not at all far-fetched
1378.141	and in fact there are a number of groups
1379.879	who have for several years expressed interest
1381.766	and desire in obtaining those capabilities
1384.306	and work towards that.
1386.066	CA: It's also been said that,
1387.642	of those 54 alleged incidents,
1390.342	that as few as zero of them
1392.19	were actually anything to do
1393.252	with these controversial programs
1395.099	that Mr. Snowden revealed,
1398.831	that it was basically through
1398.831	other forms of intelligence,
1402.748	that you're looking for a needle in a haystack,
1405.638	and the effects of these programs,
1407.2	these controversial programs,
1408.231	is just to add hay to the stack,
1410.303	not to really find the needle.
1411.883	The needle was found by other methods.
1413.965	Isn't there something to that?
1418.089	RL: No, there's actually two programs
1420.497	that are typically implicated in that discussion.
1422.914	One is the section 215 program,
1425.392	the U.S. telephony metadata program,
1428.37	and the other one is
1430.41	popularly called the PRISM program,
1432.004	and it's actually section 702 
1432.004	of the FISA Amendment Act.
1435.252	But the 215 program
1439.442	is only relevant to threats
1441.169	that are directed against the United States,
1443.428	and there have been a dozen threats
1446.328	where that was implicated.
1447.643	Now what you'll see people say publicly
1450.832	"is there is no ""but for"" case,"
1452.868	and so there is no case where, but for that,
1456.681	the threat would have happened.
1458.382	But that actually indicates a lack of understanding
1462.589	of how terrorist investigations actually work.
1467.706	You think about on television,
1469.184	you watch a murder mystery.
1470.516	What do you start with? You start with a body,
1472.046	and then they work their way
1472.046	from there to solve the crime.
1474.282	We're actually starting well before that,
1475.813	hopefully before there are any bodies,
1477.314	and we're trying to build the case for
1479.747	who the people are, what they're trying to do,
1482.177	and that involves massive amounts of information.
1485.027	Think of it is as mosaic,
1486.508	and it's hard to say that any one piece of a mosaic
1488.67	was necessary to building the mosaic,
1491.302	but to build the complete picture,
1493.031	you need to have all the pieces of information.
1494.996	On the other, the non-U.S.-related
1494.996	threats out of those 54,
1498.101	the other 42 of them,
1501.29	the PRISM program was hugely relevant to that,
1505.92	and in fact was material in contributing
1508.906	to stopping those attacks.
1510.788	CA: Snowden said two days ago
1512.125	that terrorism has always been
1515.495	what is called in the intelligence world
1517.623	"""a cover for action,"""
1519.169	that it's something that,
1521.106	because it invokes such a powerful
1522.822	emotional response in people,
1524.661	it allows the initiation of these programs
1527.295	to achieve powers that an organization like yours
1530.856	couldn't otherwise have.
1532.423	Is there any internal debate about that?
1535.875	RL: Yeah.
1537.287	I mean, we debate these things all the time,
1539.287	and there is discussion that goes on
1542.046	in the executive branch
1543.967	and within NSA itself
1546.03	and the intelligence community about
1547.685	what's right, what's proportionate,
1549.045	what's the correct thing to do.
1550.306	And it's important to note that the programs
1551.884	that we're talking about
1553.231	were all authorized by two different presidents,
1556.633	two different political parties,
1558.378	by Congress twice,
1560.513	and by federal judges 16 different times,
1564.349	and so this is not NSA running off
1569.061	and doing its own thing.
1570.524	This is a legitimate activity
1572.972	of the United States foreign government
1575.49	that was agreed to by all the branches
1577.665	of the United States government,
1579.649	and President Madison would have been proud.
1582.698	CA: And yet, when congressmen discovered
1586.787	what was actually being done 
1586.787	with that authorization,
1589.017	many of them were completely shocked.
1591.886	Or do you think that is not a legitimate reaction,
1595.232	that it's only because it's now come out publicly,
1597.337	that they really knew exactly what you were doing
1600.439	with the powers they had granted you?
1602.775	RL: Congress is a big body.
1604.449	There's 535 of them,
1606.426	and they change out frequently,
1608.567	in the case of the House, every two years,
1610.425	and I think that the NSA provided
1614.201	all the relevant information
1614.201	to our oversight committees,
1617.338	and then the dissemination of that information
1619.616	by the oversight committees throughout Congress
1621.515	is something that they manage.
1624.149	I think I would say that Congress members
1629.005	had the opportunity to make themselves aware,
1632.836	and in fact a significant number of them,
1634.705	the ones who are assigned oversight responsibility,
1638.163	did have the ability to do that.
1639.337	And you've actually had the chairs of
1639.337	those committees say that in public.
1643.275	CA: Now, you mentioned the 
1643.275	threat of cyberattacks,
1644.832	and I don't think anyone in this room would disagree
1646.999	that that is a huge concern,
1648.889	but do you accept that there's a tradeoff
1650.723	between offensive and defensive strategies,
1653.134	and that it's possible that the very measures taken
1655.959	"to, ""weaken encryption,"""
1658.628	and allow yourself to find the bad guys,
1660.781	might also open the door to forms of cyberattack?
1665.054	RL: So I think two things.
1667.897	One is, you said weaken encryption. I didn't.
1671.744	And the other one is that
1676.87	the NSA has both of those missions,
1679.646	and we are heavily biased towards defense,
1681.927	and, actually, the vulnerabilities that we find
1685.444	in the overwhelming majority of cases,
1687.545	we disclose to the people who are responsible
1690.318	for manufacturing or developing those products.
1693.681	We have a great track record of that,
1695.064	and we're actually working on a proposal right now
1697.05	to be transparent and to
1697.05	publish transparency reports
1700.22	in the same way that the Internet companies
1703.106	are being allowed to publish
1703.106	transparency reports for them.
1706.973	We want to be more transparent about that.
1708.971	So again, we eat our own dog food.
1712.1	We use the standards, we use the products
1714.353	that we recommend,
1717.008	and so it's in our interest
1719.303	to keep our communications protected
1721.941	in the same way that other people's need to be.
1725.745	CA: Edward Snowden,
1728.935	when, after his talk, was wandering the halls here
1733.363	in the bot,
1734.608	and I heard him say to a couple of people,
1736.796	they asked him about what he thought
1738.413	of the NSA overall,
1740.006	and he was very complimentary about the people
1742.779	who work with you,
1744.8	said that it's a really
1748.723	impassioned group of employees
1750.683	who are seeking to do the right thing,
1753.132	and that the problems have come from
1756.086	just some badly conceived policies.
1759.205	He came over certainly very reasonably and calmly.
1763.65	He didn't come over like a crazy man.
1765.825	Would you accept that at least,
1767.795	even if you disagree with how he did it,
1770.811	that he has opened a debate that matters?
1774.835	RL: So I think that the discussion
1777.233	is an important one to have.
1779.097	I do not like the way that he did it.
1782.473	I think there were a number of other ways
1784.478	that he could have done that
1785.94	that would have not endangered our people
1789.236	and the people of other nations
1791.884	through losing visibility
1793.995	into what our adversaries are doing.
1796.726	But I do think it's an important conversation.
1799.412	CA: It's been reported that there's
1800.951	almost a difference of opinion
1803.06	with you and your colleagues
1804.531	over any scenario in which
1806.584	he might be offered an amnesty deal.
1809.187	I think your boss, General Keith Alexander,
1811.898	has said that that would be a terrible example
1813.884	for others;
1815.349	you can't negotiate with someone
1817.006	who's broken the law in that way.
1819.014	But you've been quoted as saying that,
1821.023	if Snowden could prove that he was surrendering
1824.231	all undisclosed documents,
1826.027	that a deal maybe should be considered.
1828.266	Do you still think that?
1831.236	RL: Yeah, so actually,
1832.754	this is my favorite thing about
1832.754	"that ""60 Minutes"" interview"
1835.337	was all the misquotes that came from that.
1837.049	What I actually said, in 
1837.049	response to a question about,
1839.964	would you entertain any discussions
1841.776	of mitigating action against Snowden,
1848.161	I said, yeah, it's worth a conversation.
1849.993	This is something that the attorney general
1851.628	of the United States and the president also
1853.558	actually have both talked about this,
1855.096	and I defer to the attorney general,
1856.465	because this is his lane.
1858.012	But there is a strong tradition
1860.521	in American jurisprudence
1863.713	of having discussions with people
1868.288	who have been charged with crimes in order to,
1870.132	if it benefits the government,
1871.648	to get something out of that,
1874.026	that there's always room for that kind of discussion.
1876.66	So I'm not presupposing any outcome,
1878.349	but there is always room for discussion.
1882.085	CA: To a lay person it seems like
1883.685	he has certain things to offer the U.S.,
1887.053	the government, you, others,
1888.792	in terms of putting things right
1890.473	and helping figure out a smarter policy,
1892.531	a smarter way forward for the future.
1898.988	Do you see, has that kind of possibility
1901.061	been entertained at all?
1903.459	RL: So that's out of my lane.
1905.097	That's not an NSA thing.
1906.626	That would be a Department of Justice
1908.833	sort of discussion.
1911.33	I'll defer to them.
1914.626	CA: Rick, when Ed Snowden ended his talk,
1917.591	I offered him the chance to
1917.591	share an idea worth spreading.
1921.336	What would be your idea worth spreading
1922.989	for this group?
1925.271	RL: So I think, learn the facts.
1927.263	This is a really important conversation,
1929.879	and it impacts, it's not just NSA,
1931.955	it's not just the government,
1933.153	it's you, it's the Internet companies.
1936.061	The issue of privacy and personal data
1939.179	is much bigger than just the government,
1940.756	and so learn the facts.
1942.667	Don't rely on headlines,
1944.263	don't rely on sound bites,
1945.939	don't rely on one-sided conversations.
1948.419	So that's the idea, I think, worth spreading.
1951.568	We have a sign, a badge tab,
1954.961	we wear badges at work with lanyards,
1956.85	and if I could make a plug,
1958.263	"my badge lanyard at work says, ""Dallas Cowboys."""
1961.01	Go Dallas.
1964.507	I've just alienated half the audience, I know.
1967.173	So the lanyard that our people
1971.069	who work in the organization
1972.854	that does our crypto-analytic work
1975.274	"have a tab that says, ""Look at the data."""
1977.215	So that's the idea worth spreading.
1978.751	Look at the data.
1981	CA: Rick, it took a certain amount of courage,
1983.992	I think, actually, to come and speak openly
1986.607	to this group.
1987.861	It's not something the NSA
1987.861	has done a lot of in the past,
1990.528	and plus the technology has been challenging.
1993.623	We truly appreciate you doing that
1995.404	and sharing in this very important conversation.
1997.817	Thank you so much.
1999.958	RL: Thanks, Chris.
2001.897	(Applause)
