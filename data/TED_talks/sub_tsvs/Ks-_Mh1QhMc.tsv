15.967	So I want to start by offering you
15.967	a free no-tech life hack,
21.389	and all it requires of you is this:
24.01	that you change your posture
24.01	for two minutes.
28.197	But before I give it away,
28.197	I want to ask you to right now
31.621	do a little audit of your body
31.621	and what you're doing with your body.
35.214	So how many of you are
35.214	sort of making yourselves smaller?
37.929	Maybe you're hunching, crossing your legs,
37.929	maybe wrapping your ankles.
41.274	Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
45.013	Sometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
48.684	I see you.
50.956	So I want you to pay attention
50.956	to what you're doing right now.
53.971	We're going to come back
53.971	to that in a few minutes,
56.329	and I'm hoping that if you learn
56.329	to tweak this a little bit,
59.277	it could significantly change
59.277	the way your life unfolds.
62.713	So, we're really fascinated
62.713	with body language,
67.237	and we're particularly interested
67.237	in other people's body language.
71.16	You know, we're interested in,
71.16	like, you know — (Laughter) —
75.381	an awkward interaction, or a smile,
79.779	or a contemptuous glance,
79.779	or maybe a very awkward wink,
84.011	or maybe even something like a handshake.
87.249	Narrator: Here they are
87.249	arriving at Number 10.
90.598	This lucky policeman gets to shake hands
90.598	with the President of the United States.
95.091	Here comes the Prime Minister --
95.091	No. (Laughter) (Applause)
100.018	(Laughter) (Applause)
102.693	Amy Cuddy: So a handshake,
102.693	or the lack of a handshake,
106.4	can have us talking for weeks
106.4	and weeks and weeks.
108.924	Even the BBC and The New York Times.
111.064	So obviously when we think
111.064	about nonverbal behavior,
115.015	or body language -- but we call it
115.015	nonverbals as social scientists --
118.403	it's language, so we think
118.403	about communication.
121.283	When we think about communication,
121.283	we think about interactions.
124.31	So what is your body language
124.31	communicating to me?
126.749	What's mine communicating to you?
128.815	And there's a lot of reason to believe
128.815	that this is a valid way to look at this.
134.787	So social scientists
134.787	have spent a lot of time
137.055	looking at the effects
137.055	of our body language,
139.16	or other people's body language,
139.16	on judgments.
141.469	And we make sweeping judgments
141.469	and inferences from body language.
144.908	And those judgments can predict
144.908	really meaningful life outcomes
148.898	like who we hire or promote,
148.898	who we ask out on a date.
152.691	For example, Nalini Ambady,
152.691	a researcher at Tufts University,
157.376	shows that when people watch
161.848	of real physician-patient interactions,
164.872	their judgments
164.872	of the physician's niceness
167.705	predict whether or not
167.705	that physician will be sued.
170.342	So it doesn't have to do so much
172.024	with whether or not that physician
172.024	was incompetent,
174.547	but do we like that person
174.547	and how they interacted?
177.377	Even more dramatic,
177.377	Alex Todorov at Princeton
180.312	has shown us that judgments
180.312	of political candidates' faces
183.989	in just one second predict 70 percent
187.957	of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial
187.957	race outcomes,
191.807	and even, let's go digital,
194.029	emoticons used well in online negotiations
198.174	can lead you to claim more value
198.174	from that negotiation.
201.006	If you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
204.229	So when we think of nonverbals,
204.229	we think of how we judge others,
207.326	how they judge us
207.326	and what the outcomes are.
210.228	We tend to forget, though,
210.228	the other audience
212.348	that's influenced by our nonverbals,
212.348	and that's ourselves.
215.783	We are also influenced by our nonverbals,
218.996	our thoughts and our feelings
218.996	and our physiology.
221.359	So what nonverbals am I talking about?
224.422	I'm a social psychologist.
224.422	I study prejudice,
227.365	and I teach at a competitive
227.365	business school,
230.092	so it was inevitable that I would become
230.092	interested in power dynamics.
234.576	I became especially interested
234.576	in nonverbal expressions
238.388	of power and dominance.
240.391	And what are nonverbal expressions
240.391	of power and dominance?
243.13	Well, this is what they are.
245.213	So in the animal kingdom,
245.213	they are about expanding.
248.091	So you make yourself big, you stretch out,
251.101	you take up space,
251.101	you're basically opening up.
254.042	It's about opening up.
255.988	And this is true
255.988	across the animal kingdom.
258.743	It's not just limited to primates.
261.504	And humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
264.212	So they do this both when they have
264.212	power sort of chronically,
267.923	and also when they're feeling
267.923	powerful in the moment.
270.924	And this one is especially interesting
270.924	because it really shows us
273.996	how universal and old these
273.996	expressions of power are.
278.018	This expression, which is known as pride,
280.617	Jessica Tracy has studied.
282.87	She shows that people
282.87	who are born with sight
285.777	and people who are congenitally
285.777	blind do this
288.718	when they win at a physical competition.
291.032	So when they cross
291.032	the finish line and they've won,
293.51	it doesn't matter if they've never
293.51	seen anyone do it.
296.011	They do this.
297.328	So the arms up in the V,
297.328	the chin is slightly lifted.
299.85	What do we do when we feel powerless?
301.937	We do exactly the opposite.
303.716	We close up.
303.716	We wrap ourselves up.
306.244	We make ourselves small.
307.612	We don't want to bump
307.612	into the person next to us.
309.992	So again, both animals and humans
309.992	do the same thing.
312.749	And this is what happens
312.749	when you put together high and low power.
316.729	So what we tend to
316.729	do when it comes to power
319.855	is that we complement
319.855	the other's nonverbals.
322.508	So if someone is being
322.508	really powerful with us,
324.939	we tend to make ourselves smaller.
324.939	We don't mirror them.
327.583	We do the opposite of them.
329.197	So I'm watching this behavior
329.197	in the classroom,
332.396	and what do I notice?
334.933	I notice that MBA students really exhibit
334.933	the full range of power nonverbals.
342.186	So you have people
342.186	who are like caricatures of alphas,
344.734	really coming into the room, they get
344.734	right into the middle of the room
348.139	before class even starts,
348.139	like they really want to occupy space.
351.576	When they sit down,
351.576	they're sort of spread out.
353.839	They raise their hands like this.
355.597	You have other people
355.597	who are virtually collapsing
358.232	when they come in.
358.232	As soon they come in, you see it.
360.756	You see it on their faces
360.756	and their bodies,
363.049	and they sit in their chair
363.049	and they make themselves tiny,
365.867	and they go like this
365.867	when they raise their hand.
368.229	I notice a couple of things about this.
370.111	One, you're not going to be surprised.
371.945	It seems to be related to gender.
373.987	So women are much more likely
373.987	to do this kind of thing than men.
379.452	Women feel chronically
379.452	less powerful than men,
382.038	so this is not surprising.
383.92	But the other thing I noticed
385.993	is that it also seemed
385.993	to be related to the extent
388.659	to which the students were participating,
388.659	and how well they were participating.
392.519	And this is really important
392.519	in the MBA classroom,
395.101	because participation
395.101	counts for half the grade.
397.782	So business schools have been struggling
397.782	with this gender grade gap.
402.255	You get these equally qualified
402.255	women and men coming in
405.527	and then you get
405.527	these differences in grades,
407.694	and it seems to be partly
407.694	attributable to participation.
410.783	So I started to wonder, you know, okay,
413.806	so you have these people coming in
413.806	like this, and they're participating.
417.448	Is it possible that we could
417.448	get people to fake it
420.001	and would it lead them
420.001	to participate more?
422.025	So my main collaborator
422.025	Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
426.638	and I really wanted to know,
426.638	can you fake it till you make it?
430.193	Like, can you do this
430.193	just for a little while
432.744	and actually experience
432.744	a behavioral outcome
435.42	that makes you seem more powerful?
437.146	So we know that our nonverbals
437.146	govern how other people
440.598	think and feel about us.
440.598	There's a lot of evidence.
443.003	But our question really was,
444.449	do our nonverbals govern
444.449	how we think and feel about ourselves?
448.513	There's some evidence that they do.
451.203	So, for example, we smile
451.203	when we feel happy,
455.839	but also, when we're forced to smile
458.017	by holding a pen in our teeth
458.017	like this, it makes us feel happy.
462.432	So it goes both ways.
464.374	When it comes to power,
464.374	it also goes both ways.
468.18	So when you feel powerful,
470.728	you're more likely to do this,
472.523	but it's also possible
472.523	that when you pretend to be powerful,
478.725	you are more likely
478.725	to actually feel powerful.
482.148	So the second question
482.148	really was, you know,
485.208	so we know that our minds
485.208	change our bodies,
487.791	but is it also true
487.791	that our bodies change our minds?
492.208	And when I say minds,
492.208	in the case of the powerful,
494.935	what am I talking about?
496.307	So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
498.473	and the sort of physiological things
498.473	that make up our thoughts and feelings,
502.069	and in my case, that's hormones.
502.069	I look at hormones.
505.136	So what do the minds of the powerful
505.136	versus the powerless look like?
509.47	So powerful people tend to be,
509.47	not surprisingly,
513.766	more assertive and more confident,
513.766	more optimistic.
517.99	They actually feel they're going to win
517.99	even at games of chance.
521.3	They also tend to be able
521.3	to think more abstractly.
525.168	So there are a lot of differences.
525.168	They take more risks.
527.812	There are a lot of differences
527.812	between powerful and powerless people.
531.075	Physiologically,
531.075	there also are differences
533.919	on two key hormones: testosterone,
533.919	which is the dominance hormone,
537.984	and cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
541.678	So what we find is that high-power
541.678	alpha males in primate hierarchies
548.823	have high testosterone and low cortisol,
552.021	and powerful and effective leaders
555.547	also have high testosterone
555.547	and low cortisol.
557.802	So what does that mean?
557.802	When you think about power,
560.207	people tended to think
560.207	only about testosterone,
562.53	because that was about dominance.
564.318	But really, power is also about
564.318	how you react to stress.
567.788	So do you want the high-power
567.788	leader that's dominant,
570.917	high on testosterone,
570.917	but really stress reactive?
573.659	Probably not, right?
575.224	You want the person who's powerful
575.224	and assertive and dominant,
578.278	but not very stress reactive,
578.278	the person who's laid back.
581.966	So we know that in primate hierarchies,
587.116	if an alpha needs to take over,
590.208	if an individual needs to take over
590.208	an alpha role sort of suddenly,
594.446	within a few days,
594.446	that individual's testosterone has gone up
597.557	significantly and his cortisol
597.557	has dropped significantly.
601.062	So we have this evidence,
601.062	both that the body can shape
604.103	the mind, at least at the facial level,
606.469	and also that role changes
606.469	can shape the mind.
610.598	So what happens, okay,
610.598	you take a role change,
613.38	what happens if you do that
613.38	at a really minimal level,
615.964	like this tiny manipulation,
615.964	this tiny intervention?
618.417	"""For two minutes,"" you say,"
618.417	"""I want you to stand like this,"
621.251	and it's going to make you feel
621.251	"more powerful."""
623.811	So this is what we did.
626.765	We decided to bring people into the lab
626.765	and run a little experiment,
631.38	and these people adopted, for two minutes,
634.929	either high-power poses
634.929	or low-power poses,
638.413	and I'm just going to show
638.413	you five of the poses,
640.754	although they took on only two.
642.339	So here's one.
645.069	A couple more.
647.052	This one has been dubbed
647.052	"the ""Wonder Woman"" by the media."
651.906	Here are a couple more.
653.228	So you can be standing
653.228	or you can be sitting.
655.582	And here are the low-power poses.
657.567	So you're folding up,
657.567	you're making yourself small.
661.904	This one is very low-power.
663.369	When you're touching your neck,
663.369	you're really protecting yourself.
667.352	So this is what happens.
669.467	They come in, they spit into a vial,
671.697	for two minutes, we say,
671.697	"""You need to do this or this."""
674.87	They don't look at pictures of the poses.
676.935	We don't want to prime them
676.935	with a concept of power.
679.486	We want them to be feeling power.
681.143	So two minutes they do this.
682.502	"We then ask them, ""How powerful"
682.502	"do you feel?"" on a series of items,"
685.711	and then we give them
685.711	an opportunity to gamble,
688.078	and then we take another saliva sample.
690.843	That's it. That's the whole experiment.
692.725	So this is what we find.
694.31	Risk tolerance, which is the gambling,
696.214	we find that when you are
696.214	in the high-power pose condition,
702.51	When you're in the low-power
702.51	pose condition,
704.63	only 60 percent, and that's
704.63	a whopping significant difference.
708.63	Here's what we find on testosterone.
711.11	From their baseline when they come in,
713.647	high-power people experience
713.647	about a 20-percent increase,
716.977	and low-power people experience
716.977	about a 10-percent decrease.
721.598	So again, two minutes,
721.598	and you get these changes.
724.415	Here's what you get on cortisol.
726.416	High-power people experience
726.416	about a 25-percent decrease,
730.214	and the low-power people experience
730.214	about a 15-percent increase.
734.346	So two minutes lead
734.346	to these hormonal changes
737.078	that configure your brain
738.722	to basically be either assertive,
738.722	confident and comfortable,
743.023	or really stress-reactive,
743.023	and feeling sort of shut down.
748.1	And we've all had the feeling, right?
750.887	So it seems that our nonverbals do govern
750.887	how we think and feel about ourselves,
756.095	so it's not just others,
756.095	but it's also ourselves.
758.551	Also, our bodies change our minds.
760.978	But the next question, of course,
763.384	is, can power posing for a few minutes
765.228	really change your life
765.228	in meaningful ways?
767.289	This is in the lab, it's this little task,
767.289	it's just a couple of minutes.
771.606	Where can you actually apply this?
773.371	Which we cared about, of course.
775.206	And so we think where you want to use this
775.206	is evaluative situations,
781.971	like social threat situations.
784.448	Where are you being evaluated,
784.448	either by your friends?
787.028	For teenagers,
787.028	it's at the lunchroom table.
789.109	For some people it's speaking
789.109	at a school board meeting.
793.406	It might be giving a pitch
793.406	or giving a talk like this
797.194	or doing a job interview.
799.992	We decided that the one
799.992	that most people could relate to
802.684	because most people had been through,
802.684	was the job interview.
805.603	So we published these findings,
808.358	and the media are all over it,
809.943	and they say, Okay, so this is what you do
812.042	when you go in
812.042	for the job interview, right?
814.139	(Laughter)
815.17	You know, so we were of course
815.17	horrified, and said,
817.641	Oh my God, no,
817.641	that's not what we meant at all.
819.937	For numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
822.201	Again, this is not about you
822.201	talking to other people.
824.792	It's you talking to yourself.
826.377	What do you do before you go
826.377	into a job interview? You do this.
829.46	You're sitting down.
829.46	You're looking at your iPhone --
832.026	or your Android, not trying
832.026	to leave anyone out.
834.312	You're looking at your notes,
836.206	you're hunching up, making yourself small,
838.23	when really what you should
838.23	be doing maybe is this,
840.683	like, in the bathroom, right?
840.683	Do that. Find two minutes.
843.744	So that's what we want to test. Okay?
845.53	So we bring people into a lab,
847.348	and they do either high-
847.348	or low-power poses again,
850.725	they go through
850.725	a very stressful job interview.
853.357	It's five minutes long.
853.357	They are being recorded.
856.973	They're being judged also,
858.954	and the judges are trained
858.954	to give no nonverbal feedback,
863.459	so they look like this.
865.245	Imagine this is the person
865.245	interviewing you.
867.35	So for five minutes, nothing,
867.35	and this is worse than being heckled.
871.973	People hate this.
873.637	It's what Marianne LaFrance calls
873.637	"""standing in social quicksand."""
877.377	So this really spikes your cortisol.
879.186	So this is the job interview
879.186	we put them through,
881.496	because we really wanted
881.496	to see what happened.
883.717	We then have these coders look
883.717	at these tapes, four of them.
886.824	They're blind to the hypothesis.
886.824	They're blind to the conditions.
889.996	They have no idea
889.996	who's been posing in what pose,
892.781	and they end up looking
892.781	at these sets of tapes,
897.871	and they say,
897.871	"""We want to hire these people,"""
900.043	all the high-power posers.
901.568	"""We don't want to hire these people."
903.365	We also evaluate these people
903.365	"much more positively overall."""
907.206	But what's driving it?
908.87	It's not about the content of the speech.
910.886	It's about the presence
910.886	that they're bringing to the speech.
913.762	Because we rate them
913.762	on all these variables
916.263	related to competence,
916.263	like, how well-structured is the speech?
919.826	How good is it?
919.826	What are their qualifications?
922.084	No effect on those things.
922.084	This is what's affected.
924.734	These kinds of things.
926.457	People are bringing
926.457	their true selves, basically.
928.872	They're bringing themselves.
930.286	They bring their ideas, but as themselves,
932.409	with no, you know, residue over them.
934.645	So this is what's driving the effect,
934.645	or mediating the effect.
939.576	So when I tell people about this,
942.944	that our bodies change our minds
942.944	and our minds can change our behavior,
946.323	and our behavior can change
946.323	our outcomes, they say to me,
949.099	"""It feels fake."" Right?"
950.666	So I said, fake it till you make it.
952.568	It's not me.
954.445	I don't want to get there
954.445	and then still feel like a fraud.
957.62	I don't want to feel like an impostor.
959.454	I don't want to get there only to feel
959.454	like I'm not supposed to be here.
963.551	And that really resonated with me,
965.738	because I want to tell you
965.738	a little story about being an impostor
968.984	and feeling like
968.984	I'm not supposed to be here.
971.206	When I was 19, I was
971.206	in a really bad car accident.
974.147	I was thrown out of a car,
974.147	rolled several times.
977.552	I was thrown from the car.
979.434	And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
982.422	and I had been withdrawn from college,
984.655	and I learned that my IQ had dropped
984.655	by two standard deviations,
990.367	which was very traumatic.
992.955	I knew my IQ because
992.955	I had identified with being smart,
995.826	and I had been called gifted as a child.
997.838	So I'm taken out of college,
997.838	I keep trying to go back.
1001.038	"They say, ""You're not going"
1001.038	to finish college.
1003.262	Just, you know, there are other
1003.262	things for you to do,
1005.839	"but that's not going to work out for you."""
1007.863	So I really struggled
1007.863	with this, and I have to say,
1011.421	having your identity taken
1011.421	from you, your core identity,
1014.195	and for me it was being smart,
1016.054	having that taken from you,
1017.717	there's nothing that leaves you feeling
1017.717	more powerless than that.
1020.84	So I felt entirely powerless.
1022.643	I worked and worked, and I got lucky,
1024.529	and worked, and got lucky, and worked.
1026.399	Eventually I graduated from college.
1028.651	It took me four years
1028.651	longer than my peers,
1030.675	and I convinced someone,
1030.675	my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
1035.016	to take me on,
1035.016	and so I ended up at Princeton,
1037.96	and I was like,
1037.96	I am not supposed to be here.
1040.811	I am an impostor.
1042.105	And the night before my first-year talk,
1044.034	and the first-year talk at Princeton
1044.034	is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
1047.557	That's it.
1048.759	I was so afraid of being
1048.759	found out the next day
1051.246	that I called her
1051.246	"and said, ""I'm quitting."""
1054.059	"She was like, ""You are not quitting,"
1055.915	because I took a gamble
1055.915	on you, and you're staying.
1058.473	You're going to stay, and this is
1058.473	what you're going to do.
1061.264	You are going to fake it.
1062.621	You're going to do every talk
1062.621	that you ever get asked to do.
1065.801	You're just going to do it
1065.801	and do it and do it,
1068.064	even if you're terrified
1068.064	and just paralyzed
1070.509	and having an out-of-body experience,
1072.882	until you have this moment where you say,
1072.882	'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
1076.252	Like, I have become this.
1076.252	"I am actually doing this.'"""
1079.218	So that's what I did.
1080.337	Five years in grad school,
1081.745	a few years, you know,
1081.745	I'm at Northwestern,
1083.869	I moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
1085.956	I'm not really thinking about it anymore,
1085.956	but for a long time I had been thinking,
1089.956	"""Not supposed to be here."""
1091.762	So at the end of my first year at Harvard,
1094.479	a student who had not talked
1094.479	in class the entire semester,
1098.804	"who I had said, ""Look, you've gotta"
1098.804	"participate or else you're going to fail,"""
1102.495	came into my office.
1102.495	I really didn't know her at all.
1105.043	She came in totally defeated,
1105.043	and she said,
1108.495	"""I'm not supposed to be here."""
1115.371	And that was the moment for me.
1117.352	Because two things happened.
1118.968	One was that I realized,
1120.262	oh my gosh,
1120.262	I don't feel like that anymore.
1123.396	I don't feel that anymore,
1123.396	but she does, and I get that feeling.
1126.42	And the second was,
1126.42	she is supposed to be here!
1128.715	Like, she can fake it, she can become it.
1130.692	"So I was like, ""Yes, you are!"
1130.692	You are supposed to be here!
1134.259	And tomorrow you're going to fake it,
1136.045	you're going to make yourself
1136.045	powerful, and, you know --
1138.758	(Applause)
1144.175	And you're going to go
1144.175	into the classroom,
1148.253	and you are going to give
1148.253	"the best comment ever."""
1150.677	You know? And she gave
1150.677	the best comment ever,
1153.682	and people turned around and were like,
1155.645	oh my God, I didn't even notice her
1155.645	sitting there. (Laughter)
1158.589	She comes back to me months later,
1160.406	and I realized that she had not just
1160.406	faked it till she made it,
1163.47	she had actually faked it
1163.47	till she became it.
1165.868	So she had changed.
1167.691	And so I want to say to you,
1167.691	don't fake it till you make it.
1171.775	Fake it till you become it.
1174.572	Do it enough until you actually
1174.572	become it and internalize.
1178.213	The last thing I'm going
1178.213	to leave you with is this.
1180.868	Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes.
1185.34	So, this is two minutes.
1187.837	Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
1189.671	Before you go into the next stressful
1189.671	evaluative situation,
1192.819	for two minutes, try doing this,
1192.819	in the elevator,
1195.525	in a bathroom stall, at your desk
1195.525	behind closed doors.
1198.764	That's what you want to do.
1200.191	Configure your brain
1200.191	to cope the best in that situation.
1203.026	Get your testosterone up.
1203.026	Get your cortisol down.
1205.991	Don't leave that situation feeling
1205.991	like, oh, I didn't show them who I am.
1209.957	Leave that situation feeling like,
1211.681	I really feel like I got to say
1211.681	who I am and show who I am.
1214.677	So I want to ask you first, you know,
1214.677	both to try power posing,
1220.468	and also I want to ask you to share
1220.468	the science, because this is simple.
1225.582	I don't have ego involved in this.
1225.582	(Laughter)
1227.759	Give it away. Share it with people,
1229.546	because the people who can use it the most
1231.99	are the ones with no resources
1231.99	and no technology
1235.365	and no status and no power.
1237.563	Give it to them
1237.563	because they can do it in private.
1240.135	They need their bodies,
1240.135	privacy and two minutes,
1242.603	and it can significantly change
1242.603	the outcomes of their life.
1245.753	Thank you.
1246.908	(Applause)
