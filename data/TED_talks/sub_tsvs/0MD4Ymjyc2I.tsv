12.739	I have spent the last years
14.739	trying to resolve two enigmas:
17.398	Why is productivity so disappointing
21.759	in all the companies where I work?
23.641	I have worked with more than 500 companies.
27.335	Despite all the technological advances --
29.78	computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,
33.072	the Internet.
35.433	Enigma number two:
36.831	Why is there so little engagement at work?
39.863	Why do people feel so miserable,
41.967	even actively disengaged?
45.617	Disengaging their colleagues.
47.141	Acting against the interest of their company.
51.872	Despite all the affiliation events,
55.976	the celebration, the people initiatives,
59.973	the leadership development programs to train
62.572	managers on how to better motivate their teams.
66.956	At the beginning, I thought there was
68.694	a chicken and egg issue:
70.663	Because people are less engaged, 
70.663	they are less productive.
73.215	Or vice versa, because they are less productive,
75.452	we put more pressure and they are less engaged.
77.643	But as we were doing our analysis
79.511	we realized that there was a common root cause
81.432	to these two issues
82.815	that relates, in fact, to the basic 
82.815	pillars of management.
87.371	The way we organize is based on two pillars.
90.541	The hard -- structure, processes, systems.
93.294	The soft --
94.518	feelings, sentiments, interpersonal
94.518	relationships, traits, personality.
99.973	And whenever a company
101.445	reorganizes, restructures, reengineers,
105.155	goes through a cultural transformation program,
107.603	it chooses these two pillars.
109.633	Now, we try to refine them,
111.682	we try to combine them.
113.578	The real issue is --
115.206	and this is the answer to the two enigmas --
117.243	these pillars are obsolete.
120.177	Everything you read in business books is based
122.859	either on one or the other
124.524	or their combination.
125.791	They are obsolete.
127.105	How do they work
129.402	when you try to use these approaches
131.689	in front of the new complexity of business?
133.837	The hard approach, basically 
133.837	is that you start from strategy,
136.834	requirements, structures, processes, 
136.834	systems, KPIs, scorecards,
140.463	committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,
143.34	you name it.
144.45	I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, 
144.45	middle offices and interfaces.
149.881	What happens basically on the left,
151.876	you have more complexity, the 
151.876	new complexity of business.
155.14	We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.
159.427	And every time there is a new requirement,
161.813	we use the same approach.
163.292	We create dedicated structure processed systems,
166.405	basically to deal with the 
166.405	new complexity of business.
169.643	The hard approach creates just complicatedness
173.382	in the organization.
175.22	Let's take an example.
176.798	An automotive company, the engineering division
179.694	is a five-dimensional matrix.
181.486	If you open any cell of the matrix,
183.518	you find another 20-dimensional matrix.
186.531	You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,
189.394	Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.
191.352	For any new requirement,
193.182	you have a dedicated function
195.057	in charge of aligning engineers against
197.846	the new requirement.
199.394	What happens when the new 
199.394	requirement emerges?
201.993	Some years ago, a new requirement
204.085	appeared on the marketplace:
205.932	the length of the warranty period.
208.083	So therefore the new requirement is repairability,
211.018	making cars easy to repair.
212.518	Otherwise when you bring the car 
212.518	to the garage to fix the light,
216.524	if you have to remove the engine
218.781	to access the lights,
220.11	the car will have to stay one week in the garage
222.549	instead of two hours, and the 
222.549	warranty budget will explode.
225.436	So, what was the solution using the hard approach?
228.381	If repairability is the new requirement,
231.431	the solution is to create a new function,
233.52	Mr. Repairability.
235.693	And Mr. Repairability creates 
235.693	the repairability process.
239.636	With a repairability scorecard, 
239.636	with a repairability metric
243.494	and eventually repairability incentive.
246.308	That came on top of 25 other KPIs.
250.072	What percentage of these people is variable compensation?
253.578	Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,
257.405	repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.
261.502	What difference did it make in their actions,
263.562	their choices to simplify? Zero.
266.184	But what occurs for zero impact? 
266.184	Mr. Repairability, process,
269.849	scorecard, evaluation, coordination 
269.849	with the 25 other coordinators
274.522	to have zero impact.
276.418	Now, in front of the new complexity of business,
278.959	the only solution is not drawing boxes
281.896	with reporting lines.
284.322	It is basically the interplay.
287.407	How the parts work together.
289.978	The connections, the interactions, the synapses.
294.71	It is not the skeleton of boxes, 
294.71	it is the nervous system
299.213	of adaptiveness and intelligence.
302.25	You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.
305.15	Whenever people cooperate,
307.689	they use less resources. In everything.
311.617	You know, the repairability issue
314.149	is a cooperation problem.
316.901	When you design cars, please take into account
320.122	the needs of those who will repair the cars
322.83	in the after sales garages.
325.937	When we don't cooperate we need more time,
328.554	more equipment, more systems, more teams.
332.336	We need -- When procurement, supply 
332.336	chain, manufacturing don't cooperate
337.427	we need more stock, more inventories, 
337.427	more working capital.
340.205	Who will pay for that?
342.146	Shareholders? Customers?
344.108	No, they will refuse.
345.439	So who is left? 
345.439	The employees,
348.248	who have to compensate through their super
350.956	individual efforts for the lack of cooperation.
354.276	Stress, burnout, they are 
354.276	overwhelmed, accidents.
357.944	No wonder they disengage.
360.768	How do the hard and the soft
360.768	try to foster cooperation?
364.565	The hard: In banks, when there is a problem
369.195	between the back office and the front office,
372.255	they don't cooperate. What is the solution?
374.345	They create a middle office.
377.44	What happens one year later?
379.476	Instead of one problem 
379.476	between the back and the front,
381.484	now I have two problems.
382.838	Between the back and the middle
383.961	and between the middle and the front.
386.177	Plus I have to pay for the middle office.
388.642	The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.
391.9	It can only add new boxes, 
391.9	new bones in the skeleton.
396.336	The soft approach:
397.971	To make people cooperate, we need 
397.971	to make them like each other.
401.8	Improve interpersonal feelings,
403.494	the more people like each other, 
403.494	the more they will cooperate.
406.45	It is totally wrong.
408.221	It is even counterproductive.
410.621	Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?
413.037	Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.
415.909	(Laughter)
417.549	Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.
420.453	And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife
424.463	is precisely because I love my wife.
427.13	If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:
430.355	You will watch my favorite football game,
432.85	if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?
435.405	(Laughter)
436.608	The more we like each other,
438.489	the more we avoid the real cooperation
441.102	that would strain our relationships 
441.102	by imposing tough tradeoffs.
445.276	And we go for a second TV or we escalate
448.283	the decision above for arbitration.
451.207	Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.
455.916	To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,
459.699	we have created what we call 
459.699	the smart simplicity approach
462.961	based on simple rules.
464.481	Simple rule number one:
466.743	Understand what others do.
469.768	What is their real work?
471.665	We need to go beyond the boxes,
475.3	the job descriptions, beyond the surface
479.318	of the container, to understand the real content.
482.823	Me, designer, if I put a wire here,
485.531	I know that it will mean that we will have to
487.534	remove the engine to access the lights.
490.1	Second, you need to reenforce integrators.
492.948	Integrators are not middle 
492.948	offices, they are managers,
496.808	existing managers that you reinforce
498.569	so that they have power and interest
501.003	to make others cooperate.
503.166	How can you reinforce your 
503.166	managers as integrators?
506.898	By removing layers.
508.373	When there are too many layers
509.737	people are too far from the action,
511.287	therefore they need KPIs, metrics,
513.401	they need poor proxies for reality.
517.729	They don't understand reality
519.331	and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.
522.431	By removing rules -- the bigger we are,
524.883	the more we need integrators,
526.516	therefore the less rules we must have,
528.837	to give discretionary power to managers.
532.731	And we do the opposite --
533.858	the bigger we are, the more rules we create.
536.044	And we end up with the Encyclopedia 
536.044	Britannica of rules.
539.294	You need to increase the quanitity of power
541.394	so that you can empower everybody
543.122	to use their judgment, their intelligence.
546.108	You must give more cards to people
548.259	so that they have the critical mass of cards
551.616	to take the risk to cooperate,
553.575	to move out of insulation.
555.33	Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.
557.694	These rules, they come from game theory
559.94	and organizational sociology.
562.168	You can increase the shadow of the future.
565.02	Create feedback loops that expose people
567.921	to the consequences of their actions.
570.522	This is what the automotive company did
572.466	when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.
575.256	They said to the design engineers:
576.891	Now, in three years, when the new 
576.891	car is launched on the market,
581.586	you will move to the after sales 
581.586	network, and become in charge
584.53	of the warranty budget,
586.905	and if the warranty budget explodes,
590.284	it will explode in your face. (Laughter)
592.951	Much more powerful than 0.8 
592.951	percent variable compensation.
598.892	You need also to increase reciprocity,
602.614	by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.
606.329	When you remove these buffers,
608.801	you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.
611.798	We will cooperate.
613.18	Remove the second TV.
614.72	There are many second TVs at work
616.964	that don't create value,
618.265	they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.
622.953	You need to reward those who cooperate
625.382	and blame those who don't cooperate.
627.061	The CEO of The Lego Group,
630.13	Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.
632.953	He says, blame is not for failure,
635.858	it is for failing to help or ask for help.
640.393	It changes everything.
642.772	Suddenly it becomes in my
642.772	interest to be transparent
645.292	on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,
647.332	because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,
649.418	but if I fail to help or ask for help.
653.286	When you do this, it has a lot of implications
656.213	on organizational design.
659.158	You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;
661.576	you look at their interplay.
662.966	It has a lot of implications on financial policies
665.945	that we use.
667.159	On human resource management practices.
669.781	When you do that, you can manage complexity,
672.205	the new complexity of business,
673.798	without getting complicated.
676.731	You create more value with lower cost.
680.381	You simultaneously improve 
680.381	performance and satisfaction at work
684.955	because you have removed the common root cause
687.684	that hinders both.
689.3	Complicatedness: This is your 
689.3	battle, business leaders.
694.01	The real battle is not against competitors.
696.837	This is rubbish, very abstract.
699.258	When do we meet competitors to fight them?
701.921	The real battle is against ourselves,
704.822	against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.
708.176	Only you can fight, can do it.
711.333	Thank you.
713.42	(Applause)
