12.496	Writing biography is a strange thing to do.
18.216	It's a journey into the foreign territory
20.899	of somebody else's life,
24.095	a journey, an exploration that can take you places
26.768	you never dreamed of going
29.039	and still can't quite believe you've been,
31.264	especially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew
34.992	and the life you've been exploring
36.817	is that of Muhammad.
41.649	Five years ago, for instance,
44.08	I found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle
47.348	to what I knew was an impossible question:
50.831	What actually happened
54.049	one desert night,
55.488	half the world and almost half of history away?
59.082	What happened, that is,
60.802	on the night in the year 610
63.12	when Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran
66.971	on a mountain just outside Mecca?
71.048	This is the core mystical moment of Islam,
75.653	and as such, of course,
77.019	it defies empirical analysis.
80.095	Yet the question wouldn't let go of me.
84.2	I was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,
87.384	just asking it could be seen
89.263	as pure chutzpah.
92.523	(Laughter)
95.205	And I plead guilty as charged,
97.816	because all exploration, physical or intellectual,
101.847	is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,
105.724	of crossing boundaries.
109.121	Still, some boundaries are larger than others.
115.136	So a human encountering the divine,
118.056	as Muslims believe Muhammad did,
121.178	to the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact
124.019	but of wishful fiction,
125.776	and like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.
129.714	Which might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts
132.598	we have of that night,
134.375	what struck me even more than what happened
137.194	was what did not happen.
142.716	Muhammad did not come floating off the mountain
145.868	as though walking on air.
148.818	"He did not run down shouting, ""Hallelujah!"""
151.292	"and ""Bless the Lord!"""
153.652	He did not radiate light and joy.
157.38	There were no choirs of angels,
158.959	no music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,
162.259	no golden aura surrounding him,
165.921	no sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role
170.063	as the messenger of God.
173.139	That is, he did none of the things
176.094	that might make it easy to cry foul,
178.848	to put down the whole story as a pious fable.
183.995	Quite the contrary.
186.827	In his own reported words,
190.572	he was convinced at first
192.949	that what had happened couldn't have been real.
198.23	At best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination --
200.942	a trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,
202.751	or his own mind working against him.
204.926	At worst, possession --
207.103	that he'd been seized by an evil jinn,
209.392	a spirit out to deceive him,
211.183	even to crush the life out of him.
214.192	In fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,
217.216	possessed by a jinn,
218.844	that when he found himself still alive,
220.956	his first impulse was to finish the job himself,
225.805	to leap off the highest cliff
228.008	and escape the terror of what he'd experienced
232.126	by putting an end to all experience.
239.228	So the man who fled down the mountain that night
242.148	trembled not with joy
244.599	but with a stark, primordial fear.
249.319	He was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.
255.239	And that panicked disorientation,
258.04	that sundering of everything familiar,
260.919	that daunting awareness of something
264.603	beyond human comprehension,
267.512	can only be called a terrible awe.
274.087	This might be somewhat difficult to grasp
277.301	"now that we use the word ""awesome"""
279.839	to describe a new app or a viral video.
284.018	With the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,
287.223	we're protected from real awe.
289.871	We close the doors and hunker down,
291.759	convinced that we're in control,
294.305	or, at least, hoping for control.
297.327	We do our best to ignore the fact that
299.235	we don't always have it,
301.296	and that not everything can be explained.
304.053	Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,
308.215	whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night
310.91	came from inside himself or from outside,
315.174	what's clear is that he did experience them,
319.878	and that he did so with a force that would shatter
322.314	his sense of himself and his world
324.635	and transform this otherwise modest man
327.775	into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.
334.468	Fear was the only sane response,
339.71	the only human response.
344.734	Too human for some,
347.242	like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that
349.975	the account of his wanting to kill himself
351.842	shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact
354.28	that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.
358.734	They insist that he never doubted
361.525	for even a single moment, let alone despaired.
368.135	Demanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate
371.972	human imperfection.
376.691	Yet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?
383.886	As I read those early accounts, I realized it was
386.86	precisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,
390.67	that allowed me to begin to see him in full,
393.067	to accord him the integrity of reality.
396.653	And the more I thought about it,
398.822	the more it made sense that he doubted,
401.839	because doubt is essential to faith.
408.422	If this seems a startling idea at first,
411.302	consider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,
414.963	is the heart of the matter.
418.798	Abolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,
423.203	but absolute, heartless conviction.
428.446	You're certain that you possess the Truth --
432.317	inevitably offered with an implied uppercase T --
436.608	and this certainty quickly devolves
439.166	into dogmatism and righteousness,
442.678	by which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride
446.781	in being so very right,
450.569	in short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.
458.457	It has to be one of the multiple ironies of history
462.933	that a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists
465.991	is the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists
469.182	known as Crusaders:
471.994	"""infidel,"" from the Latin for ""faithless."""
477.219	Doubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism
481.558	is in fact the opposite of faith.
486.023	In effect, they are the infidels.
491.982	Like fundamentalists of all religious stripes,
494.809	they have no questions, only answers.
498.654	They found the perfect antidote to thought
501.446	and the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.
505.217	They don't have to struggle for it like Jacob
507.166	wrestling through the night with the angel,
509.216	or like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,
512.374	or like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,
515.576	but throughout his years as a prophet,
518.07	with the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,
522.254	and condemning those who most loudly proclaim
525.542	that they know everything there is to know
529.339	and that they and they alone are right.
536.233	And yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,
543.646	have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.
549.415	We've allowed Judaism to be claimed
551.908	by violently messianic West Bank settlers,
555.779	Christianity by homophobic hypocrites
558.726	and misogynistic bigots,
561.246	Islam by suicide bombers.
566.205	And we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that
568.976	no matter whether they claim to be Christians,
571.168	Jews or Muslims,
572.783	militant extremists are none of the above.
578.438	They're a cult all their own, blood brothers
584.052	steeped in other people's blood.
589.546	This isn't faith.
591.748	It's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.
596.91	We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.
601.932	It's difficult and stubborn.
606.01	It involves an ongoing struggle,
608.248	a continual questioning of what we think we know,
611.302	a wrestling with issues and ideas.
613.867	It goes hand in hand with doubt,
617.167	in a never-ending conversation with it,
620.244	and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.
626.639	And this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,
631.687	can still have faith.
635.828	I have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East
638.816	is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence
643.126	to the contrary.
646.287	I'm not convinced of this.
648.659	I can hardly say I believe it.
650.783	I can only have faith in it,
652.725	commit myself, that is, to the idea of it,
656.743	and I do this precisely because of the temptation
659.744	to throw up my hands in resignation
661.744	and retreat into silence.
665.265	Because despair is self-fulfilling.
669.946	If we call something impossible,
672.266	we act in such a way that we make it so.
676.034	And I, for one, refuse to live that way.
681.967	In fact, most of us do,
684.266	whether we're atheist or theist
687.842	or anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,
691.782	what drives us is that, despite our doubts
696.098	and even because of our doubts,
698.426	we reject the nihilism of despair.
702.898	We insist on faith in the future
706.131	and in each other.
710.869	Call this naive if you like.
714.37	Call it impossibly idealistic if you must.
717.467	But one thing is sure:
719.895	Call it human.
723.361	Could Muhammad have so radically changed his world
726.396	without such faith, without the refusal
729.248	to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?
733.964	I think not.
737.23	After keeping company with him as a writer
739.273	for the past five years, I can't see
742.573	that he'd be anything but utterly outraged
747.676	at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak
750.823	and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.
756.292	He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population
760.582	because of their gender.
763.58	He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.
771.561	He'd call out terrorism for what it is,
774.267	not only criminal but an obscene travesty
779.011	of everything he believed in and struggled for.
783.916	He'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life
789.185	takes the life of all humanity.
792.386	Anyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.
799.582	And he'd commit himself fully
802.652	to the hard and thorny process of making peace.
809.672	Thank you.
811.107	(Applause)
815.506	Thank you. (Applause)
