25	"My title: ""Queerer than we can"
25	"suppose: the strangeness of science."""
31.416	"""Queerer than we can suppose"" comes"
31.416	from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,
35.582	"who said, ""Now, my own suspicion"
35.582	is that the universe is not only queerer
40.384	than we suppose, but queerer
40.384	than we can suppose.
44.848	I suspect that there are more things
44.848	in heaven and earth
47.603	than are dreamed of, or can
47.603	"be dreamed of, in any philosophy."""
54.213	Richard Feynman compared
54.213	the accuracy of quantum theories --
59.052	experimental predictions --
60.902	to specifying the width of North America
60.902	to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.
67.649	This means that quantum theory
67.649	has got to be, in some sense, true.
71.742	Yet the assumptions
71.742	that quantum theory needs to make
74.701	in order to deliver those
74.701	predictions are so mysterious
78.164	that even Feynman himself
78.164	was moved to remark,
81.942	"""If you think you understand"
81.942	quantum theory,
84.805	"you don't understand quantum theory."""
88.67	It's so queer that physicists
88.67	resort to one or another
92.1	paradoxical interpretation of it.
95.378	David Deutsch, who's talking here,
95.378	"in ""The Fabric of Reality,"""
99.895	embraces the many-worlds
99.895	interpretation of quantum theory,
105	because the worst that you
105	can say about it
107.045	is that it's preposterously wasteful.
109.322	It postulates a vast and rapidly growing
109.322	number of universes existing in parallel,
115.751	mutually undetectable,
117.586	except through the narrow porthole
117.586	of quantum mechanical experiments.
125.268	And that's Richard Feynman.
128.395	The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes
130.793	that the queerness of modern physics
132.532	is just an extreme example.
134.242	Science, as opposed to technology,
136.566	does violence to common sense.
139.787	Every time you drink a glass
139.787	of water, he points out,
142.914	the odds are that you will imbibe
142.914	at least one molecule
146.419	that passed through the bladder
146.419	of Oliver Cromwell.
149.401	(Laughter)
151.232	It's just elementary probability theory.
153.483	(Laughter)
154.683	The number of molecules
154.683	per glassful is hugely greater
157.924	than the number of glassfuls,
157.924	or bladdersful, in the world.
161.734	And of course, there's nothing special
161.734	about Cromwell or bladders --
164.968	you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom
167.421	that passed through the right lung
167.421	of the third iguanodon
171	to the left of the tall cycad tree.
176.555	"""Queerer than we can suppose."""
179.807	What is it that makes us
179.807	capable of supposing anything,
183.35	and does this tell us anything
183.35	about what we can suppose?
187.724	Are there things about the universe
187.724	that will be forever beyond our grasp,
193.106	but not beyond the grasp
193.106	of some superior intelligence?
196.497	Are there things about the universe
198.21	that are, in principle,
198.21	ungraspable by any mind,
202.481	however superior?
205.422	The history of science has been
205.422	one long series of violent brainstorms,
210.183	as successive generations
210.183	have come to terms with
213.307	increasing levels of queerness
213.307	in the universe.
216.863	We're now so used to the idea
216.863	that the Earth spins,
219.937	rather than the Sun moves across the sky,
222.292	it's hard for us to realize
223.625	what a shattering mental revolution
223.625	that must have been.
227.631	After all, it seems obvious
227.631	that the Earth is large and motionless,
230.858	the Sun, small and mobile.
232.661	But it's worth recalling
232.661	Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:
237.27	"""Tell me,"" he asked a friend,"
237.27	"""why do people always say"
241.273	it was natural for man to assume
241.273	that the Sun went 'round the Earth,
245.372	"rather than that the Earth was rotating?"""
248.878	"And his friend replied, ""Well, obviously,"
250.895	because it just looks as though
250.895	"the Sun is going round the Earth."""
255.114	"Wittgenstein replied, ""Well,"
255.114	what would it have looked like
258.9	if it had looked as though
258.9	"the Earth was rotating?"""
262.436	(Laughter)
267	Science has taught us,
267	against all intuition,
270.051	that apparently solid things,
270.051	like crystals and rocks,
273.476	are really almost entirely
273.476	composed of empty space.
277.706	And the familiar illustration
277.706	is the nucleus of an atom
282.025	is a fly in the middle
282.025	of a sports stadium,
285.164	and the next atom
285.164	is in the next sports stadium.
288.897	So it would seem the hardest,
288.897	solidest, densest rock
292.108	is really almost entirely empty space,
295.721	broken only by tiny particles
295.721	so widely spaced they shouldn't count.
300.835	Why, then, do rocks look and feel
300.835	solid and hard and impenetrable?
306.199	As an evolutionary biologist,
306.199	I'd say this: our brains have evolved
310.898	to help us survive within the orders
310.898	of magnitude, of size and speed
317	which our bodies operate at.
319.185	We never evolved to navigate
319.185	in the world of atoms.
322.092	If we had, our brains
322.092	probably would perceive rocks
325.441	as full of empty space.
326.911	Rocks feel hard and impenetrable
329.379	to our hands, precisely because
329.379	objects like rocks and hands
334	cannot penetrate each other.
336.537	It's therefore useful
338.353	for our brains to construct notions
338.353	"like ""solidity"" and ""impenetrability,"""
344.503	because such notions help us
344.503	to navigate our bodies
348	through the middle-sized world
348	in which we have to navigate.
352.644	Moving to the other end of the scale,
354.445	our ancestors never had to navigate
354.445	through the cosmos
357.859	at speeds close to the speed of light.
360.247	If they had, our brains would be
360.247	much better at understanding Einstein.
365.765	"I want to give the name ""Middle World"""
365.765	to the medium-scaled environment
370.29	in which we've evolved
370.29	the ability to take act --
372.712	"nothing to do with ""Middle Earth"" --"
374.463	Middle World.
375.638	(Laughter)
377	We are evolved denizens of Middle World,
380.033	and that limits what
380.033	we are capable of imagining.
383.533	We find it intuitively easy
383.533	to grasp ideas like,
386.338	when a rabbit moves
386.338	at the sort of medium velocity
389.127	at which rabbits and other
389.127	Middle World objects move,
392	and hits another Middle World object
392	like a rock, it knocks itself out.
397.846	May I introduce Major General
397.846	Albert Stubblebine III,
403.632	commander of military
403.632	intelligence in 1983.
408.651	"""...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington,"
408.651	Virginia, and decided to do it.
414.445	As frightening as the prospect was,
414.445	he was going into the next office.
420.238	He stood up and moved
420.238	out from behind his desk.
425.088	'What is the atom mostly made of?'
425.088	he thought, 'Space.'
429.428	He started walking. 'What am I
429.428	mostly made of? Atoms.'
435.34	He quickened his pace,
435.34	almost to a jog now.
438.181	'What is the wall mostly made of?'
440.55	(Laughter)
441.575	'Atoms!'
443.588	All I have to do is merge the spaces.
448.056	Then, General Stubblebine banged
448.056	his nose hard on the wall of his office.
454.339	Stubblebine, who commanded
458.302	was confounded by his continual failure
458.302	to walk through the wall.
462.253	He has no doubt that this ability
462.253	will one day be a common tool
465.345	in the military arsenal.
466.996	Who would screw around with an army
466.996	"that could do that?"""
470.835	That's from an article in Playboy,
472.828	which I was reading the other day.
474.567	(Laughter)
476.198	I have every reason to think it's true;
478.118	I was reading Playboy because I, myself,
478.118	had an article in it.
481.63	(Laughter)
487.515	Unaided human intuition,
487.515	schooled in Middle World,
492.189	finds it hard to believe Galileo
492.189	when he tells us
495.52	a heavy object and a light object,
495.52	air friction aside,
498.938	would hit the ground at the same instant.
500.938	And that's because in Middle World,
500.938	air friction is always there.
504.516	If we'd evolved in a vacuum,
505.889	we would expect them to hit
505.889	the ground simultaneously.
509.106	If we were bacteria,
510.643	constantly buffeted by thermal
510.643	movements of molecules,
513.982	it would be different.
515.157	But we Middle-Worlders are too big
515.157	to notice Brownian motion.
518.856	In the same way, our lives
518.856	are dominated by gravity,
522.23	but are almost oblivious
522.23	to the force of surface tension.
525.851	A small insect would reverse
525.851	these priorities.
530.067	Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left,
532.544	Douglas Adams is on the right.
534.123	Steve Grand, in his book,
534.123	"""Creation: Life and How to Make It,"""
537.845	is positively scathing about our
537.845	preoccupation with matter itself.
543.698	We have this tendency to think
543.698	that only solid, material things
547.361	are really things at all.
549.811	Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation
549.811	in a vacuum seem unreal.
554.75	Victorians thought the waves
554.75	had to be waves in some material medium:
559.62	the ether.
561.38	But we find real matter comforting
563.771	only because we've evolved
563.771	to survive in Middle World,
567.762	where matter is a useful fiction.
571	A whirlpool, for Steve Grand,
571	is a thing with just as much reality
575.262	as a rock.
577.978	In a desert plain in Tanzania,
580.652	in the shadow of the volcano
580.652	Ol Doinyo Lengai,
583.866	there's a dune made of volcanic ash.
586.651	The beautiful thing
586.651	is that it moves bodily.
590	It's what's technically known
590	"as a ""barchan,"""
592.231	and the entire dune walks
592.231	across the desert in a westerly direction
596.459	at a speed of about 17 meters per year.
599.825	It retains its crescent shape and moves
599.825	in the direction of the horns.
604.34	What happens is that the wind blows
604.34	the sand up the shallow slope
608.34	on the other side,
609.572	and then, as each sand grain hits
609.572	the top of the ridge, it cascades down
613.341	on the inside of the crescent,
614.823	and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.
619.803	Steve Grand points out
619.803	that you and I are, ourselves,
623.317	more like a wave than a permanent thing.
626.877	He invites us, the reader,
628.752	to think of an experience
628.752	from your childhood,
631.181	something you remember clearly,
632.763	something you can see,
632.763	feel, maybe even smell,
635.821	as if you were really there.
637.56	After all, you really were there
637.56	at the time, weren't you?
641.357	How else would you remember it?
643.485	But here is the bombshell:
643.485	You weren't there.
646.167	Not a single atom
646.167	that is in your body today
648.608	was there when that event took place.
651.142	Matter flows from place to place
653.309	and momentarily comes together to be you.
656.261	Whatever you are, therefore,
657.637	you are not the stuff
657.637	of which you are made.
661.743	If that doesn't make the hair stand up
661.743	on the back of your neck,
664.815	read it again until it does,
664.815	because it is important.
669.283	"So ""really"" isn't a word that we should"
669.283	use with simple confidence.
674	If a neutrino had a brain,
676.296	which it evolved
676.296	in neutrino-sized ancestors,
679.062	it would say that rocks really
679.062	do consist of empty space.
683.833	We have brains that evolved
683.833	in medium-sized ancestors
686.65	which couldn't walk through rocks.
689.03	"""Really,"" for an animal, is whatever"
689.03	its brain needs it to be
693.674	in order to assist its survival.
696.075	And because different species
696.075	live in different worlds,
698.846	there will be a discomforting
698.846	"variety of ""reallys."""
705.37	What we see of the real world
705.37	is not the unvarnished world,
709.631	but a model of the world,
709.631	regulated and adjusted by sense data,
713.936	but constructed so it's useful
713.936	for dealing with the real world.
718.459	The nature of the model depends
718.459	on the kind of animal we are.
722	A flying animal needs
722	a different kind of model
725.657	from a walking, climbing
725.657	or swimming animal.
728.381	A monkey's brain must have
728.381	software capable of simulating
732.825	a three-dimensional world
732.825	of branches and trunks.
736.144	A mole's software for constructing models
736.144	of its world will be customized
740.545	for underground use.
742.521	A water strider's brain
742.521	doesn't need 3D software at all,
746.412	since it lives on the surface of the pond,
748.586	in an Edwin Abbott flatland.
752.652	I've speculated that bats may see
752.652	color with their ears.
757.39	The world model that a bat needs
757.39	in order to navigate
760.608	through three dimensions catching insects
762.609	must be pretty similar to the world
762.609	model that any flying bird --
765.706	a day-flying bird like a swallow --
765.706	needs to perform the same kind of tasks.
770	The fact that the bat uses
770	echoes in pitch darkness
773.314	to input the current
773.314	variables to its model,
776.105	while the swallow uses
776.105	light, is incidental.
779.456	Bats, I've even suggested, use
779.456	perceived hues, such as red and blue,
784.758	as labels, internal labels,
784.758	for some useful aspect of echoes --
790.897	perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces,
790.897	furry or smooth and so on --
795.468	in the same way as swallows or indeed,
795.468	we, use those perceived hues --
800.055	redness and blueness, etc. --
801.683	to label long and short
801.683	wavelengths of light.
804.579	There's nothing inherent about red
804.579	that makes it long wavelength.
808.747	The point is that the nature of the model
808.747	is governed by how it is to be used,
812.995	rather than by the sensory
812.995	modality involved.
817.871	J.B.S. Haldane himself had
817.871	something to say about animals
820.715	whose world is dominated by smell.
823.535	Dogs can distinguish two very similar
823.535	fatty acids, extremely diluted:
829.393	caprylic acid and caproic acid.
832.101	The only difference, you see,
833.523	is that one has an extra pair
833.523	of carbon atoms in the chain.
836.831	Haldane guesses that a dog would probably
836.831	be able to place the acids
841.343	in the order of their molecular
841.343	weights by their smells,
844.811	just as a man could place
844.811	a number of piano wires
847.957	in the order of their lengths
847.957	by means of their notes.
851.726	Now, there's another
851.726	fatty acid, capric acid,
855.537	which is just like the other two,
857.173	except that it has two more carbon atoms.
860.481	A dog that had never met
860.481	capric acid would, perhaps,
863.328	have no more trouble imagining its smell
866.305	than we would have trouble
866.305	imagining a trumpet, say,
869.485	playing one note higher than we've heard
869.485	a trumpet play before.
876.549	Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other
876.549	smell-oriented animals smell in color.
883.268	And the argument would be exactly
883.268	the same as for the bats.
888.253	Middle World -- the range
888.253	of sizes and speeds
891.964	which we have evolved to feel
891.964	intuitively comfortable with --
895.576	is a bit like the narrow range
895.576	of the electromagnetic spectrum
899.368	that we see as light of various colors.
902.22	We're blind to all
902.22	frequencies outside that,
904.564	unless we use instruments to help us.
909	Middle World is the narrow
909	range of reality
912.166	which we judge to be normal,
912.166	as opposed to the queerness
915.444	of the very small, the very large
915.444	and the very fast.
920	We could make a similar
920	scale of improbabilities;
922.873	nothing is totally impossible.
925.508	Miracles are just events
925.508	that are extremely improbable.
929.23	A marble statue could wave its hand at us;
932.083	the atoms that make up
932.083	its crystalline structure
934.97	are all vibrating back and forth anyway.
937.211	Because there are so many of them,
938.893	and because there's no
938.893	agreement among them
941	in their preferred direction of movement,
943.1	the marble, as we see it
943.1	in Middle World, stays rock steady.
947.189	But the atoms in the hand
947.189	could all just happen to move
949.823	the same way at the same time,
949.823	and again and again.
952.471	In this case, the hand would move,
954.144	and we'd see it waving at us
954.144	in Middle World.
957.951	The odds against it,
957.951	of course, are so great
960.561	that if you set out writing zeros
960.561	at the time of the origin of the universe,
965.065	you still would not have written
965.065	enough zeros to this day.
969.206	Evolution in Middle World
969.206	has not equipped us
972.258	to handle very improbable events;
972.258	we don't live long enough.
976.497	In the vastness of astronomical space
976.497	and geological time,
981.212	that which seems impossible
981.212	in Middle World
984.034	might turn out to be inevitable.
988.135	One way to think about that
988.135	is by counting planets.
991.724	We don't know how many planets
991.724	there are in the universe,
994.43	but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20,
994.43	or 100 billion billion.
998.374	And that gives us a nice way to express
998.374	our estimate of life's improbability.
1004.71	We could make some sort of landmark points
1004.71	along a spectrum of improbability,
1008.427	which might look like the electromagnetic
1008.427	spectrum we just looked at.
1013.568	If life has arisen only once on any --
1017.85	life could originate once per planet,
1017.85	could be extremely common
1023.097	or it could originate once per star
1025.685	or once per galaxy or maybe only
1025.685	once in the entire universe,
1030.701	in which case it would have to be here.
1032.91	And somewhere up there would be the chance
1034.985	that a frog would turn into a prince,
1036.81	and similar magical things like that.
1040.207	If life has arisen on only one planet
1040.207	in the entire universe,
1044.099	that planet has to be our planet,
1044.099	because here we are talking about it.
1048.119	And that means that if we want
1048.119	to avail ourselves of it,
1050.795	we're allowed to postulate chemical events
1050.795	in the origin of life
1054.656	which have a probability as low
1054.656	as one in 100 billion billion.
1059.036	I don't think we shall have
1059.036	to avail ourselves of that,
1061.693	because I suspect that life
1061.693	is quite common in the universe.
1064.684	And when I say quite common,
1064.684	it could still be so rare
1067.746	that no one island of life
1067.746	ever encounters another,
1071.895	which is a sad thought.
1074.665	How shall we interpret
1074.665	"""queerer than we can suppose?"""
1078.397	Queerer than can in principle be supposed,
1080.676	or just queerer than we can suppose,
1080.676	given the limitations
1084.138	of our brain's evolutionary
1084.138	apprenticeship in Middle World?
1089	Could we, by training and practice,
1090.878	emancipate ourselves from Middle World
1093.092	and achieve some sort of intuitive
1093.092	as well as mathematical understanding
1097.759	of the very small and the very large?
1099.922	I genuinely don't know the answer.
1102.058	I wonder whether we might help ourselves
1102.058	to understand, say, quantum theory,
1105.716	if we brought up children
1105.716	to play computer games
1109	beginning in early childhood,
1110.606	which had a make-believe world of balls
1110.606	going through two slits on a screen,
1114.551	a world in which the strange goings-on
1114.551	of quantum mechanics were enlarged
1118.563	by the computer's make-believe,
1120.481	so that they became familiar
1120.481	on the Middle-World scale of the stream.
1124.35	And similarly, a relativistic
1124.35	computer game,
1126.928	in which objects on the screen manifest
1126.928	the Lorentz contraction, and so on,
1132.268	to try to get ourselves -- to get children
1132.268	into the way of thinking about it.
1137.124	I want to end by applying
1137.124	the idea of Middle World
1141.029	to our perceptions of each other.
1143.735	Most scientists today subscribe
1143.735	to a mechanistic view of the mind:
1148.046	we're the way we are because our brains
1148.046	are wired up as they are,
1151.474	our hormones are the way they are.
1153.15	We'd be different, our characters
1153.15	would be different,
1155.685	if our neuro-anatomy and our
1155.685	physiological chemistry were different.
1159.868	But we scientists are inconsistent.
1162.424	If we were consistent,
1163.829	our response to a misbehaving
1163.829	person, like a child-murderer,
1167.166	should be something like:
1168.524	this unit has a faulty component;
1168.524	it needs repairing.
1171.794	That's not what we say.
1173	What we say -- and I include
1173	the most austerely mechanistic among us,
1177.187	which is probably me --
1178.425	"what we say is, ""Vile monster,"
1178.425	"prison is too good for you."""
1182.259	Or worse, we seek revenge,
1182.259	in all probability thereby triggering
1186	the next phase in an escalating
1186	cycle of counter-revenge,
1189.594	which we see, of course,
1189.594	all over the world today.
1192.496	In short, when we're
1192.496	thinking like academics,
1194.796	we regard people as elaborate
1194.796	and complicated machines,
1198.119	like computers or cars.
1200.663	But when we revert to being human,
1202.701	we behave more like Basil Fawlty,
1202.701	who, we remember,
1206.436	thrashed his car to teach it a lesson,
1208.299	"when it wouldn't start on ""Gourmet Night."""
1210.598	(Laughter)
1212.308	The reason we personify things
1212.308	like cars and computers
1216.316	is that just as monkeys live
1216.316	in an arboreal world
1219.708	and moles live in an underground world
1222.394	and water striders live in a surface
1222.394	tension-dominated flatland,
1226.232	we live in a social world.
1228.385	We swim through a sea of people --
1230.595	a social version of Middle World.
1233.562	We are evolved to second-guess
1233.562	the behavior of others
1237.301	by becoming brilliant,
1237.301	intuitive psychologists.
1241.464	Treating people as machines
1242.88	may be scientifically
1242.88	and philosophically accurate,
1246.419	but it's a cumbersome waste of time
1248.356	if you want to guess what this person
1248.356	is going to do next.
1252	The economically useful way
1252	to model a person
1255	is to treat him as a purposeful,
1255	goal-seeking agent
1258.635	with pleasures and pains,
1258.635	desires and intentions,
1261.075	guilt, blame-worthiness.
1263.456	Personification and the imputing
1263.456	of intentional purpose
1267.59	is such a brilliantly successful
1267.59	way to model humans,
1271.257	it's hardly surprising
1271.257	the same modeling software
1274.402	often seizes control when we're
1274.402	trying to think about entities
1278	for which it's not appropriate,
1278	like Basil Fawlty with his car
1281.395	or like millions of deluded people,
1281.395	with the universe as a whole.
1286.717	(Laughter)
1289	If the universe is queerer
1289	than we can suppose,
1292.165	is it just because
1292.165	we've been naturally selected
1294.691	to suppose only what we needed to suppose
1297.684	in order to survive
1297.684	in the Pleistocene of Africa?
1300.863	Or are our brains so versatile
1300.863	and expandable that we can train ourselves
1306.587	to break out of the box of our evolution?
1309.909	Or finally, are there some things
1309.909	in the universe so queer
1314.346	that no philosophy of beings,
1314.346	however godlike, could dream them?
1320.737	Thank you very much.
1321.913	(Applause)
