12.96	Talking about empowerment is odd,
15.659	because when we talk about empowerment,
17.761	what affects us most are the stories.
20.967	So I want to begin with an everyday story.
24.179	What is it really like to be a young woman in India?
28.702	Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life
30.974	in India, lived in three small towns,
33.073	two major cities,
34.889	and I've had several experiences.
38.118	When I was seven,
39.974	a private tutor who used to come home
41.931	to teach me mathematics molested me.
46.646	He would put his hand up my skirt.
52.794	He put his hand up my skirt and told me
55.97	he knew how to make me feel good.
59.93	At 17, a boy from my high school
63.06	circulated an email
64.507	detailing all the sexually aggressive things
66.94	he could do to me
69.704	because I didn't pay attention to him.
73.789	At 19, I helped a friend
77.5	whose parents had forcefully
77.5	married her to an older man
80.592	escape an abusive marriage.
84.259	At 21, when my friend and I were walking
86.401	down the road one afternoon,
90.734	a man pulled down his pants
92.273	and masturbated in front of us.
95.483	We called people for help, and nobody came.
99.91	At 25, when I was walking home one evening,
104.9	two men on a motorcycle attacked me.
107.726	I spent two nights in the hospital
109.843	recovering from trauma and injuries.
113.085	So throughout my life, I've seen women —
118.305	family, friends, colleagues —
120.171	live through these experiences,
122.964	and they seldom talk about it.
126.137	So in simple words, life in India is not easy.
130.777	But today I'm not going to talk to you about this fear.
134.295	I'm going to talk to you about an interesting path
136.049	of learning that this fear took me on.
140.427	So, what happened one night in December 2012
143.93	changed my life.
145.704	So a young girl, a 23-year-old student,
149	boarded a bus in Delhi with her male friend.
153.904	There were six men on the bus, young men
156.513	who you might encounter every day in India,
159.591	and the chilling account of what followed
161.923	was played over and over again
163.667	in the Indian and international media.
166.491	This girl was raped repeatedly,
169.765	forcefully penetrated with a blunt rod,
172.745	beaten, bitten, and left to die.
175.996	Her friend was gagged, attacked,
178	and knocked unconscious.
181.577	She died on the 29th of December.
185.761	And at a time when most of us here
187.739	were preparing to welcome the new year,
190.242	India plunged into darkness.
193.479	For the first time in our history,
196.645	men and women in Indian cities
198.823	woke up to the horrific truth
201.014	about the true state of women in the country.
204.536	Now, like many other young women,
206.955	I was absolutely terrified.
209.149	I couldn't believe that something like this
210.416	could happen in a national capital.
213.591	I was angry and I was frustrated,
216.144	but most of all, I felt utterly, completely helpless.
220.247	But really, what do you do, right?
222.388	Some write blogs, some ignore it,
224.413	some join protests.
226.145	I did all of it. In fact, that was what everyone was doing
228.71	two years ago.
230.388	So the media was filled with stories about
233.367	all the horrific deeds
235.133	that Indian men are capable of.
237.237	They were compared to animals,
238.472	sexually repressed beasts.
240.659	In fact, so alien and unthinkable was this event
244.663	in an Indian mind
245.977	that the response from the Indian media,
248.393	public and politicians proved one point:
252.3	No one knew what to do.
254.179	And no one wanted to be responsible for it.
256.776	In fact, these were a few insensitive comments
259.26	which were made in the media
260.441	by prominent people
262.468	in response to sexual violence
262.468	against women in general.
266.624	So the first one is made by a member of parliament,
269.826	the second one is made by a spiritual leader,
273.219	and the third one was actually
273.219	the defendants' lawyer
275.93	when the girl was fighting for her life
277.776	and she passed away.
280.63	Now, as a woman watching this day after day,
284.483	I was tired.
286.283	So as a writer and gender activist,
287.927	I have written extensively on women,
291.176	but this time, I realized it was different,
293.822	because a part of me realized
295.403	I was a part of that young woman too,
297.751	and I decided I wanted to change this.
299.929	So I did something spontaneous, hasty.
303.96	I logged on to a citizen journalism platform
306.506	called iReport,
307.962	and I recorded a video talking about
310.713	what the scene was like in Bangalore.
312.693	I talked about how I felt,
314.38	I talked about the ground realities,
315.722	and I talked about the frustrations of living in India.
321.227	In a few hours, the blog was shared widely,
324.845	and comments and thoughts poured in
326.68	from across the world.
328.34	In that moment, a few things occurred to me.
332.015	One, technology was always at hand
335.743	for many young women like me.
338.96	Two, like me, most young women
342.504	hardly use it to express their views.
345.925	Three, I realized for the first time
349.849	that my voice mattered.
352.707	So in the months that followed,
355.44	I covered a trail of events in Bangalore
357.487	which had no space in the mainstream news.
361.469	In Cubbon Park, which is a big park in Bangalore,
364.24	I gathered with over 100 others
365.84	when groups of young men came forward
367.749	to wear skirts to prove that clothing
369.561	does not invite rape.
373.241	When I reported about these events,
375.075	I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel
378.168	to release all the emotions I had inside me.
382.337	I attended the town hall march
384.409	when students held up signs saying
386.343	"""Kill them, hang them."""
388.872	"""You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."""
392.699	I went to a candlelight vigil
394.177	where citizens gathered together
396.28	to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,
400.237	and I recorded a lot of blogs
402.277	in response to how worrying the situation was
404.98	in India at that point.
406.249	"[""I am born with sisters and cousin who now live in cities and abroad but they never talk to me or complain about their daily difficulties like you say""]"
407.898	Now, the reactions confused me.
409.357	While supportive comments poured
409.357	in from across the world,
412.227	as did vicious ones.
414.241	So some called me a hypocrite.
415.675	Some called me a victim, a rape apologist.
418.438	Some even said I had a political motive.
421.403	But this one comment kind of describes
423.523	what we are discussing here today.
428.33	But I was soon to learn that this was not all.
431.44	As empowered as I felt
433.429	with the new liberty that this
434.879	citizen journalism channel gave me,
437.236	I found myself in an unfamiliar situation.
440.57	So sometime last August, I logged onto Facebook
443.737	and I was looking through my news feed,
445.14	and I noticed there was a link
447.183	that was being shared by my friends.
448.856	I clicked on the link; it led me back
451.039	to a report uploaded by an American girl
455.114	called Michaela Cross.
457.322	The report was titled,
458.71	"""India: The story you never wanted to hear."""
461.951	And in this report, she recounted her firsthand
465.096	account of facing sexual harassment in India.
468.796	"She wrote, ""There is no way to prepare for the eyes,"
472.763	the eyes that every day stared
474.85	with such entitlement at my body,
477.574	with no change of expression
479.424	whether I met their gaze or not.
482.072	Walking to the fruit seller's or the tailor's,
485.21	I got stares so sharp
487.309	"that they sliced away bits of me piece by piece."""
490.746	She called India a traveler's
490.746	heaven and a woman's hell.
494.64	She said she was stalked, groped,
496.656	and masturbated at.
498.253	Now, late that evening, the report went viral.
500.692	It was on news channels across the world.
504.304	Everyone was discussing it.
505.91	It had over a million views,
507.018	a thousand comments and shares,
508.923	and I found myself witnessing
510.837	a very similar thing.
513.401	The media was caught in this vicious cycle
516.097	of opinion and outburst
518.395	and no outcome whatsoever.
521.7	So that night, as I sat wondering
524.105	how I should respond,
525.437	I found myself filled with doubt.
527.847	You see, as a writer, I approached this issue
531.208	as an observer,
533.586	as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,
537.964	and as an activist, I looked
537.964	at it as a defender of rights,
542.443	but as a citizen journalist,
544.578	I suddenly felt very vulnerable.
547.852	I mean, here she was, a young woman
550.183	who was using a channel to talk about
551.583	her experience just as I was,
553.731	and yet I felt unsettled.
556.545	You see, no one ever tells you
558.467	that true empowerment comes from giving yourself
561.407	the permission to think and act.
563.783	Empowerment is often made to sound as if
566.245	it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.
569.442	When we talk about empowerment, we often
571.274	talk about giving people access to materials,
574.559	giving them access to tools.
577.295	But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.
579.744	It's a feeling.
581.206	The first step to empowerment
583.938	is to give yourself the authority,
586.818	the key to independent will,
588.793	and for women everywhere,
590.393	no matter who we are or where we come from,
592.941	that is the most difficult step.
596.261	We fear the sound of our own voice,
598.87	for it means admission, but it is this that gives us
601.656	the power to change our environment.
604.74	Now in this situation where I was faced
606.581	with so many different kinds of realities,
609.267	I was unsure how to judge,
610.753	because I didn't know what it would mean for me.
613.838	I feared to judge because I
613.838	didn't know what it would be
616.843	if I didn't support the same view as this girl.
620.124	I didn't know what it would mean for me
621.49	if I was challenging someone else's truth.
626.37	But yet, it was simple.
627.863	I had to make a decision:
629.312	Should I speak up or should I stay quiet?
632.502	So after a lot of thought,
634.786	I recorded a video blog in response,
637.282	and I told Michaela, well,
639.252	there are different sides to India,
641.955	and I also tried to explain
647.364	that things would be okay
649.425	and I expressed my regret for what she had faced.
652.091	And a few days later, I was invited to talk
654.692	on air with her,
656.061	and for the first time, I reached out to this girl
660.181	who I had never met, who was so far away,
662.982	but yet I felt so close to.
665.82	Since this report came to light,
668.35	more young people than ever
670.655	were discussing sexual harassment on the campus,
674.006	and the university that Michaela belonged to
676.797	gave her the assistance she needed.
680.645	The university even took measures
682.99	to train its students to equip them
685.049	with the skills that they need
686.685	to confront challenges such as harassment,
690.155	and for the first the time, I felt I wasn't alone.
694.448	You see, if there's anything that I've learned
696.534	as an active citizen journalist
699.169	over the past few years,
702.252	it is our dire lack as a society to actively find
706.225	avenues where our voices can be heard.
709.222	We don't realize that when we are standing up,
713.526	we are not just standing up as individuals,
715.368	we are standing up for our communities,
718.605	our friends, our peers.
720.464	Most of us say that women are denied their rights,
723.837	but the truth is, oftentimes,
726.213	women deny themselves these rights.
729.613	In a recent survey in India,
736.781	aviation, hospitality and call centers,
740.197	said they didn't feel safe returning home alone
742.764	after work in the late hours or in the evening.
746.15	In Bangalore, where I come from,
747.551	this number is 85 percent.
750.017	In rural areas in India,
752.563	if anything is to go by the recent
755.72	gang rapes in Badaun and acid attacks in Odisha
758.287	and Aligarh are supposed to go by,
760.308	we need to act really soon.
763.885	Don't get me wrong,
765.578	the challenges that women will face
768.285	in telling their stories is real,
771.077	but we need to start pursuing
773.782	and trying to identify mediums
776.269	to participate in our system
777.76	and not just pursue the media blindly.
782.124	Today, more women than ever
785.122	are standing up and questioning
786.767	the government in India,
788.146	and this is a result of that courage.
791.169	There is a sixfold increase in women
794.222	reporting harassment,
795.784	and the government passed
797.173	the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act in 2013
800.149	to protect women against sexual assault.
803.968	As I end this talk,
805.92	I just want to say
808.04	that I know a lot of us in this room have our secrets,
813.62	but let us speak up.
815.572	Let us fight the shame and talk about it.
818.241	It could be a platform, a community,
821.761	your loved one, whoever or whatever you choose,
825.648	but let us speak up.
827.74	The truth is, the end to this problem
830.8	begins with us.
832.542	Thank you.
834.187	(Applause)
