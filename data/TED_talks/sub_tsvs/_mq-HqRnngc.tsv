116.329	"Trevor Copp: When ""Dancing With the Stars"""
116.329	first hit the airwaves,
119.457	that is not what it looked like.
121.56	(Laughter)
123.121	Jeff and I were full-time
123.121	ballroom dance instructors
126.172	when the big TV ballroom revival hit,
129.609	and this was incredible.
133.132	"I mean, one day we would say ""foxtrot,"""
135.76	"and people were like ""Foxes trotting."""
138.821	(Laughter)
140.575	And the next day they were telling us
142.553	the finer points of a good feather step.
144.965	And this blew our minds.
147.342	I mean, all of the ballroom dance
147.342	geeking out that we had always done
152.588	on why salsa worked differently
152.588	than the competitive rumba
156.251	and why tango traveled unlike the waltz,
158.779	all of that just hit
158.779	the public consciousness,
163.383	and it changed everything.
165.834	But running parallel to this excitement,
168.224	the excitement that suddenly,
168.224	somehow, we were cool --
172.599	(Laughter)
175.044	there was also this reservation.
177.914	Why this and why now?
181.556	Jeff Fox: When Trevor and I
181.556	would get together for training seminars
184.813	or just for fun,
185.996	we'd toss each other around, mix it up,
187.886	take a break from having
187.886	to lead all the time.
190.097	We even came up with a system
190.097	for switching lead and follow
192.891	while we were dancing,
194.066	as a way of taking turns and playing fair.
196.099	It wasn't until we used that system
196.099	as part of a performance
199.08	in a small festival
200.265	that we got an important tap
200.265	on the shoulder.
202.416	Lisa O'Connell, a dramaturge
202.416	and director of a playwright center,
205.748	pulled us aside after the show and said,
208.154	"""Do you have any idea"
208.154	"how political that was?"""
210.858	(Laughter)
212.898	So that began an eight-year
212.898	collaboration to create a play
215.691	which not only further developed
215.691	our system for switching
218.476	but also explored the impact
218.476	of being locked into a single role,
222.258	and what's worse,
223.446	being defined by that single role.
225.599	TC: Because, of course,
227.968	classic Latin and ballroom dancing
227.968	isn't just a system of dancing;
232.719	it's a way of thinking, of being,
235.924	of relating to each other
237.571	that captured a whole period's values.
240.599	There's one thing that stayed
240.599	consistent, though:
242.99	the man leads
244.34	and the woman follows.
246.126	So street salsa, championship tango,
246.126	it's all the same --
248.878	he leads, she follows.
251.335	So this was gender training.
253.623	You weren't just learning to dance --
255.449	"you were learning to ""man"" and to ""woman."""
259.813	It's a relic.
261.59	And in the way of relics,
261.59	you don't throw it out,
263.92	but you need to know
263.92	that this is the past.
266.327	This isn't the present.
268.866	It's like Shakespeare:
268.866	respect it, revive it -- great!
271.969	But know that this is history.
273.479	This doesn't represent how we think today.
277.045	So we asked ourselves:
278.609	If you strip it all down,
280.672	what is at the core of partner dancing?
284.094	JF: Well, the core principle
284.094	of partner dancing
286.353	is that one person leads,
286.353	the other one follows.
289.094	The machine works the same,
289.094	regardless of who's playing which role.
292.388	The physics of movement doesn't really
292.388	give a crap about your gender.
295.683	(Laughter)
296.747	So if we were to update the existing form,
298.801	we would need to make it
298.801	more representative
300.919	of how we interact here, now, in 2015.
304.031	When you watch ballroom,
304.031	don't just watch what's there.
307.517	Watch what's not.
309.089	The couple is always
309.089	only a man and a woman.
312.125	Together.
313.307	Only.
314.603	Ever.
315.778	So, same-sex and gender nonconformist
315.778	couples just disappear.
319.884	In most mainstream international
319.884	ballroom competitions,
322.54	same-sex couples are rarely
322.54	recognized on the floor,
325.183	and in many cases,
326.391	the rules prohibit them completely.
328.152	TC: Try this: Google-image,
328.152	"""professional Latin dancer,"""
333.504	and then look for an actual Latino person.
335.739	(Laughter)
337.13	You'll be there for days.
339.145	What you will get is page after page
339.145	of white, straight Russian couples
343.194	spray-tanned to the point of mahogany.
345.183	(Laughter)
347.108	There are no black people,
347.108	there are no Asians,
349.392	no mixed-race couples,
350.7	so basically, non-white people
350.7	just disappeared.
354.727	Even within the white-straight-
354.727	couple-only paradigm --
360.008	she can't be taller,
361.413	he can't be shorter.
362.905	She can't be bolder,
365.025	he can't be gentler.
367.261	If you were to take a ballroom dance
369.505	and translate that into a conversation
371.822	and drop that into a movie,
373.288	we, as a culture,
373.288	would never stand for this.
376.934	He dictates, she reacts.
380.674	No relationship -- gay,
380.674	straight or anything --
383.703	that we would regard as remotely healthy
383.703	or functional looks like that,
388.134	and yet somehow,
389.744	you put it on prime time,
389.744	you slap some makeup on it,
392.382	throw the glitter on, put it out there
392.382	as movement, not as text,
396.832	and we, as a culture,
398.974	tune in and clap.
401.805	We are applauding our own absence.
406.13	Too many people have disappeared
406.13	from partner dancing.
410.334	(Music)
454.276	(Applause)
460.957	JF: Now, you just saw
460.957	two men dancing together.
463.52	(Laughter)
464.557	And you thought it looked ...
466.412	a little strange.
468.13	Interesting -- appealing, even --
470.199	but a little bit odd.
472.372	Even avid followers of the same-sex
472.372	ballroom circuit can attest
475.38	that while same-sex partner dancing
475.38	can be dynamic and strong and exciting,
479.514	it just doesn't quite seem to fit.
482.446	Aesthetically speaking,
483.687	if Alida and I take the classic
483.687	closed ballroom hold ...
489.637	this is considered beautiful.
494.204	(Laughter)
496.703	But why not this?
497.985	(Laughter)
499.699	See, the standard image that the leader
499.699	must be larger and masculine
503.391	and the follower smaller and feminine --
505.95	this is a stumbling point.
507.978	TC: So we wanted to look at this
507.978	from a totally different angle.
513.467	So, what if we could keep
513.467	the idea of lead and follow
517.059	but toss the idea that this
517.059	was connected to gender?
520.824	Further, what if a couple
520.824	could lead and follow each other
525.851	and then switch?
527.513	And then switch back?
529.69	What if it could be like a conversation,
532.949	taking turns listening and speaking,
532.949	just like we do in life?
536.042	What if we could dance like that?
540.418	"We call it ""Liquid Lead Dancing."""
544.542	JF: Let's try this with a Latin dance,
547.045	salsa.
548.524	In salsa, there's a key transitional step,
548.524	called the cross-body lead.
552.185	We use it as punctuation
552.185	to break up the improvisation.
554.969	It can be a little tricky to spot
554.969	if you're not used to looking for it,
558.363	so here it is.
565.191	One more time for the cheap seats.
566.869	(Laughter)
572.378	And here's the action one more time,
574.407	nice and slow.
580.842	Now, if we apply liquid-lead thinking
580.842	to this transitional step,
584.953	the cross-body lead becomes a point
586.659	where the lead and the follow can switch.
588.668	The person following can elect
588.668	to take over the lead,
591.215	or the person leading can choose
591.215	to surrender it,
593.592	essentially making it
593.592	a counter-cross-body lead.
596.208	Here's how that looks in slow motion.
605.913	And here's how it looked
605.913	when we danced it in the opening dance.
614.789	With this simple tweak,
614.789	the dance moves from being a dictation
618.186	to a negotiation.
619.761	Anyone can lead. Anyone can follow.
622.278	And more importantly,
622.278	you can change your mind.
625.523	Now, this is only one example
625.523	of how this applies,
627.913	but once the blinkers come off,
627.913	anything can happen.
631.09	TC: Let's look at how Liquid Lead thinking
631.09	could apply to a classic waltz.
636.297	Because, of course,
637.549	it isn't just a system of switching leads;
640.164	it's a way of thinking
641.354	that can actually make
641.354	the dance itself more efficient.
644.981	So: the waltz.
646.891	The waltz is a turning dance.
648.984	This means that for the lead,
650.62	you spend half of the dance
650.62	traveling backwards,
653.856	completely blind.
655.35	And because of the follower's position,
657.923	basically, no one can see
657.923	where they're going.
660.755	(Laughter)
662.127	So you're out here on the floor,
664.163	and then imagine that coming right at you.
666.851	JF: Raaaaaah!
668.224	(Laughter)
669.772	TC: There are actually a lot
669.772	of accidents out there
673.092	that happen as a result
673.092	of this blind spot.
676.08	But what if the partners
676.08	were to just allow for
679.346	a switch of posture for a moment?
681.519	A lot of accidents could be avoided.
684.253	Even if one person led the whole dance
684.253	but allowed this switch to happen,
689.117	it would be a lot safer,
690.527	while at the same time,
690.527	offering new aesthetics into the waltz.
694.221	Because physics doesn't give a damn
694.221	about your gender.
697.678	(Laughter)
700.154	JF: Now, we've danced Liquid Lead
700.154	in clubs, convention centers
703.179	"and as part of ""First Dance,"""
703.179	the play we created with Lisa,
706.021	on stages in North America and in Europe.
708.387	And it never fails to engage.
710.736	I mean, beyond the unusual sight
710.736	of seeing two men dancing together,
714.241	it always evokes and engages.
717.174	But why?
718.485	The secret lies in what made
718.485	Lisa see our initial demonstration
721.604	"as ""political."""
722.931	It wasn't just that we were
722.931	switching lead and follow;
725.53	it's that we stayed consistent
725.53	in our presence, our personality
728.611	and our power, regardless
728.611	of which role we were playing.
731.564	We were still us.
733.816	And that's where the true freedom lies --
735.875	not just the freedom to switch roles,
737.888	but the freedom from being defined
737.888	by whichever role you're playing,
741.527	the freedom to always remain
741.527	true to yourself.
744.457	Forget what a lead is supposed
744.457	to look like, or a follow.
747.581	Be a masculine follow
749.16	or a feminine lead.
750.795	Just be yourself.
752.873	Obviously, this applies
752.873	off the dance floor as well,
755.614	but on the floor, it gives us
755.614	the perfect opportunity
758.177	to update an old paradigm,
758.177	reinvigorate an old relic,
761.498	and make it more representative
761.498	of our era and our current way of being.
766.63	TC: Jeff and I dance partner dancing
766.63	all the time with women and men
769.995	and we love it.
771.407	But we dance with a consciousness
771.407	that this is a historic form
775.994	that can produce silence
775.994	and produce invisibility
780.328	across the spectrum of identity
780.328	that we enjoy today.
783.82	We invented Liquid Lead
785.338	as a way of stripping out
785.338	all the ideas that don't belong to us
790.527	and taking partner dancing back
790.527	to what it really always was:
795.83	the fine art of taking care of each other.
800.829	(Music)
920.91	(Applause)
