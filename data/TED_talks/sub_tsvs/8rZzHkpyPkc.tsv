12.212	When I was a young man, I spent six years
14.285	of wild adventure in the tropics
16.398	working as an investigative journalist
18.526	in some of the most bewitching parts of the world.
21.911	I was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.
25.11	This is why wars get fought.
26.648	But I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.
30.875	And when I came home, I found the scope of my existence
34.768	gradually diminishing
36.751	until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.
41.197	And I found myself sort of
43.337	scratching at the walls of life,
45.394	as if I was trying to find a way out
47.432	into a wider space beyond.
49.319	I was, I believe, ecologically bored.
53.85	Now, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,
58.331	in a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.
63.157	And we still possess the fear and the courage
65.753	and the aggression required to navigate those times.
68.946	But in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,
73.63	we have few opportunities to exercise them
76.613	without harming other people.
79.765	And this was the sort of constraint that I found myself
83.903	bumping up against.
86.153	To conquer uncertainty,
88.765	to know what comes next,
92.083	that's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,
96.653	and having got there, or almost got there,
100.253	we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.
103.616	We've privileged safety over experience
106.618	and we've gained a lot in doing so,
109.122	but I think we've lost something too.
112.13	Now, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.
114.932	I'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,
118.45	and the outcome of a mortal combat between me
121.679	myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear
124.592	and an enraged giant aurochs
127.074	isn't very hard to predict.
129.556	Nor was it authenticity that I was looking for.
132.552	I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.
135.692	I just wanted a richer and rawer life
139.618	than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,
142.114	that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.
145.526	And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word
151.032	that I began to understand what I was looking for.
154.637	And as soon as I found that word,
157.291	I realized that I wanted to devote
159.319	much of the rest of my life to it.
163.074	"The word is ""rewilding,"""
166.575	and even though rewilding is a young word,
169.357	it already has several definitions.
171.224	But there are two in particular that fascinate me.
175.26	The first one is the mass restoration
179.211	of ecosystems.
181.866	One of the most exciting scientific findings
184.836	of the past half century
186.606	has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.
191.352	A trophic cascade is an ecological process
194.53	which starts at the top of the food chain
196.905	and tumbles all the way down to the bottom,
200.2	and the classic example is what happened
202.543	in the Yellowstone National Park in the United States
205.354	when wolves were reintroduced in 1995.
209.443	Now, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,
213.878	but perhaps we're slightly less aware
216.277	that they give life to many others.
220.115	It sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.
223.228	Before the wolves turned up,
225.054	they'd been absent for 70 years.
226.713	The numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,
229.778	had built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,
232.532	and despite efforts by humans to control them,
235.623	they'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there
238.318	to almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.
241.739	But as soon as the wolves arrived,
243.934	even though they were few in number,
245.761	they started to have the most remarkable effects.
249.66	First, of course, they killed some of the deer,
251.831	but that wasn't the major thing.
253.643	Much more significantly,
255.674	they radically changed the behavior of the deer.
258.873	The deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,
261.786	the places where they could be trapped most easily,
264.009	particularly the valleys and the gorges,
266.748	and immediately those places started to regenerate.
269.937	In some areas, the height of the trees
272.336	quintupled in just six years.
275.348	Bare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen
279.415	and willow and cottonwood.
281.686	And as soon as that happened,
283.464	the birds started moving in.
285.622	The number of songbirds, of migratory birds,
288.043	started to increase greatly.
290.117	The number of beavers started to increase,
292.174	because beavers like to eat the trees.
294.855	And beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.
298.083	They create niches for other species.
300.962	And the dams they built in the rivers
303.174	provided habitats for otters and muskrats
306.108	and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.
310.289	The wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,
314.394	the number of rabbits and mice began to rise,
316.856	which meant more hawks, more weasels,
319.766	more foxes, more badgers.
322.165	Ravens and bald eagles came down to feed
324.652	on the carrion that the wolves had left.
326.888	Bears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,
330.597	partly also because there were more berries
332.94	growing on the regenerating shrubs,
335.252	and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves
338.483	by killing some of the calves of the deer.
342.882	But here's where it gets really interesting.
346.558	The wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.
351.843	They began to meander less.
353.53	There was less erosion. The channels narrowed.
357.153	More pools formed, more riffle sections,
359.548	all of which were great for wildlife habitats.
361.779	The rivers changed
363.981	in response to the wolves,
366.193	and the reason was that the regenerating forests
369.838	stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,
373.529	so that the rivers became more fixed in their course.
376.849	Similarly, by driving the deer out of some places
380.576	and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,
384.932	there was less soil erosion,
386.345	because the vegetation stabilized that as well.
389.881	So the wolves, small in number,
393.242	transformed not just the ecosystem
396.205	of the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,
399.307	but also its physical geography.
403.525	Whales in the southern oceans
405.149	have similarly wide-ranging effects.
407.652	One of the many post-rational excuses
410.519	made by the Japanese government for killing whales
413.509	"is that they said, ""Well, the number of fish and krill will rise"
416.643	"and then there'll be more for people to eat."""
418.881	Well, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of
420.892	kind of makes sense, doesn't it,
422.261	because you'd think that whales eat huge amounts
424.385	of fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,
426.547	there'll be more fish and krill.
428.609	But the opposite happened.
431.002	You take the whales away,
432.331	and the number of krill collapses.
435.182	Why would that possibly have happened?
437.275	Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial
440.415	to sustaining that entire ecosystem,
443.728	and one of the reasons for this
445.457	is that they often feed at depth
447.557	and then they come up to the surface and produce
449.339	what biologists politely call large fecal plumes,
453.525	huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,
457.958	up in the photic zone, where there's enough light
461.274	to allow photosynthesis to take place,
464.446	and those great plumes of fertilizer
467.39	stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
469.382	the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,
471.296	which stimulate the growth of zooplankton,
473.394	which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.
475.691	The other thing that whales do is that,
477.825	as they're plunging up and down through the water column,
480.554	they're kicking the phytoplankton
482.922	back up towards the surface
484.372	where it can continue to survive and reproduce.
487.486	And interestingly, well, we know
490.114	that plant plankton in the oceans
493.051	absorb carbon from the atmosphere --
494.858	the more plant plankton there are,
496.401	the more carbon they absorb --
498.08	and eventually they filter down into the abyss
501.162	and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.
504.542	Well, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,
508.843	they were probably responsible for sequestering
511.852	some tens of millions of tons of carbon
515.645	every year from the atmosphere.
518.334	And when you look at it like that, you think,
521.561	wait a minute, here are the wolves
523.42	changing the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.
526.437	Here are the whales changing
528.296	the composition of the atmosphere.
530.936	You begin to see that possibly,
533.246	the evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,
536.927	which conceives of the world as a coherent,
539.514	self-regulating organism,
541.444	is beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.
547.178	Trophic cascades
549.446	tell us that the natural world
551.507	is even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.
556.253	They tell us that when you take away the large animals,
559.985	you are left with a radically different ecosystem
563.177	to one which retains its large animals.
566.349	And they make, in my view, a powerful case
569.63	for the reintroduction of missing species.
573.783	Rewilding, to me,
575.859	means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.
579.157	It means taking down the fences,
580.469	it means blocking the drainage ditches,
582.493	it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,
585.757	but otherwise stepping back.
589.171	It has no view as to what a right ecosystem
592.981	or a right assemblage of species looks like.
595.682	It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow
599.461	or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.
604.147	It lets nature decide,
606.164	and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.
609.983	Now, I mentioned that there are two definitions
612.258	of rewilding that interest me.
614.104	The other one
615.361	is the rewilding of human life.
618.384	And I don't see this as an alternative
620.447	to civilization.
622.371	I believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,
625.771	as we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,
629.61	have access to a richer and wilder life of adventure
634.626	when we want to because
636.209	there would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.
640.605	And the opportunities for this
642.389	are developing more rapidly than you might think possible.
647.38	There's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,
650.359	two thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared
654.044	has become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,
657.547	particularly from the eastern half of the country.
660.56	There's another one which suggests
662.217	that 30 million hectares of land in Europe,
665.68	an area the size of Poland,
668.187	will be vacated by farmers
670.018	between 2000 and 2030.
673.34	Now, faced with opportunities like that,
676.876	does it not seem a little unambitious
679.047	to be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,
682.761	bears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,
686.36	and all the other species which are already beginning
688.185	to move quite rapidly across Europe?
691.449	Perhaps we should also start thinking
693.973	about the return of some of our lost megafauna.
697.962	What megafauna, you say?
699.894	Well, every continent had one,
702.463	apart from Antarctica.
703.944	When Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,
707.582	the river gravels there were found
709.337	to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,
712.887	rhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.
716.975	Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
718.349	there were lions in Trafalgar Square
720.545	long before Nelson's Column was built.
723.751	All these species lived here
726.002	in the last interglacial period,
728.654	when temperatures were pretty similar to our own.
731.515	It's not climate, largely,
733.588	which has got rid of the world's megafaunas.
737.135	It's pressure from the human population
739.239	hunting and destroying their habitats
741.075	which has done so.
743.126	And even so, you can still see the shadows
746.914	of these great beasts in our current ecosystems.
749.622	Why is it that so many deciduous trees
752.575	are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?
757.133	Why is it that they can withstand the loss
759.202	of so much of their bark?
760.809	Why do understory trees,
763.752	which are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind
768.845	and have to carry less weight
770.576	than the big canopy trees,
772.978	why are they so much tougher and harder to break
776.097	than the canopy trees are?
780.506	Elephants.
782.478	They are elephant-adapted.
784.647	In Europe, for example,
786.935	they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,
790.078	elephas antiquus, which was a great beast.
792.366	It was related to the Asian elephant,
794.542	but it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.
797.111	It was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.
799.641	But why is it that some of our common shrubs
802.458	have spines which seem to be over-engineered
805.642	to resist browsing by deer?
808.305	Perhaps because they evolved
810.119	to resist browsing by rhinoceros.
813.382	Isn't it an amazing thought
815.306	that every time you wander into a park
818.034	or down an avenue or through a leafy street,
820.881	you can see the shadows of these great beasts?
824.492	Paleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,
828.292	crucial to an understanding of our own,
832.35	feels like a portal through which you may pass
835.927	into an enchanted kingdom.
838.859	And if we really are looking at areas of land
842.672	of the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,
846.917	why not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,
849.632	or at least species closely related to those
851.582	which have become extinct everywhere?
854.543	Why shouldn't all of us
856.852	have a Serengeti on our doorsteps?
859.805	And perhaps this is the most important thing
862.771	that rewilding offers us,
864.246	the most important thing that's missing from our lives:
867.84	hope.
869.957	In motivating people to love and defend the natural world,
874.354	an ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.
879.164	The story rewilding tells us
881.803	is that ecological change need not always proceed
885.443	in one direction.
887.906	It offers us the hope
890.342	that our silent spring
892.483	could be replaced by a raucous summer.
894.814	Thank you.
896.034	(Applause)
