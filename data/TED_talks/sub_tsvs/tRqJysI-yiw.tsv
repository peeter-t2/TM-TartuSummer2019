14.151	By raising your hand,
15.592	how many of you know
15.592	at least one person on the screen?
20.367	Wow, it's almost a full house.
22.258	It's true, they are very famous
22.258	in their fields.
24.839	And do you know what
24.839	all of them have in common?
27.858	They all died of pancreatic cancer.
30.802	However, although it's very,
30.802	very sad this news,
33.334	it's also thanks to their personal stories
36.122	that we have raised awareness
36.122	of how lethal this disease can be.
40.267	It's become the third cause
40.267	of cancer deaths,
43.667	and only eight percent of the patients
43.667	will survive beyond five years.
49.217	That's a very tiny number,
51.16	especially if you compare it
51.16	with breast cancer,
53.94	where the survival rate
53.94	is almost 90 percent.
57.946	So it doesn't really come as a surprise
60.337	that being diagnosed
60.337	with pancreatic cancer
62.826	means facing an almost
62.826	certain death sentence.
66.101	What's shocking, though,
66.101	is that in the last 40 years,
69.771	this number hasn't changed a bit,
72.173	while much more progress has been made
74.301	with other types of tumors.
76.552	So how can we make pancreatic cancer
76.552	treatment more effective?
80.659	As a biomedical entrepreneur,
82.589	I like to work on problems
82.589	that seem impossible,
85.632	understanding their limitations
87.717	and trying to find new,
87.717	innovative solutions
90.813	that can change their outcome.
93.035	The first piece of bad news
93.035	with pancreatic cancer
95.636	is that your pancreas is in the middle
95.636	of your belly, literally.
99.131	It's depicted in orange on the screen.
101.99	But you can barely see it
103.661	until I remove all the other
103.661	organs in front.
107.093	It's also surrounded
107.093	by many other vital organs,
110.113	like the liver, the stomach,
110.113	the bile duct.
113.249	And the ability of the tumor
113.249	to grow into those organs
116.686	is the reason why pancreatic cancer
118.732	is one of the most painful tumor types.
122.295	The hard-to-reach location
122.295	also prevents the doctor
125.481	from surgically removing it,
127.224	as is routinely done
127.224	for breast cancer, for example.
130.716	So all of these reasons leave
130.716	chemotherapy as the only option
134.124	for the pancreatic cancer patient.
136.745	This brings us to the second
136.745	piece of bad news.
139.579	Pancreatic cancer tumors have
139.579	very few blood vessels.
143.624	Why should we care
143.624	about the blood vessel of a tumor?
147.434	Let's think for a second
147.434	how chemotherapy works.
150.924	The drug is injected in the vein
152.837	and it navigates throughout the body
152.837	until it reaches the tumor site.
157.505	It's like driving on a highway,
157.505	trying to reach a destination.
162.08	But what if your destination
162.08	doesn't have an exit on the highway?
165.989	You will never get there.
167.642	And that's exactly the same problem
169.788	for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
173.119	The drugs navigate
173.119	throughout all of your body.
175.988	They will reach healthy organs,
178.425	resulting in high toxic effect
178.425	for the patients overall,
182.256	but very little will go to the tumor.
184.795	Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.
188.519	To me, it seems very counterintuitive
188.519	to have a whole-body treatment
193.357	to target a specific organ.
195.645	However, in the last 40 years,
198.121	a lot of money, research
198.121	and effort have gone towards
202.469	finding new, powerful drugs
202.469	to treat pancreatic cancer,
206.576	but nothing has been done
206.576	in changing the way
209.011	we deliver them to the patient.
212.397	So after two pieces of bad news,
214.047	I'm going to give you
214.047	good news, hopefully.
217.806	With a collaborator at MIT
219.3	and the Massachusetts
219.3	General Hospital in Boston,
222.22	we have revolutionized
222.22	the way we treat cancer
225.157	by making localized
225.157	drug delivery a reality.
228.974	We are basically parachuting you
228.974	on top of your destination,
232.984	avoiding your having to drive
232.984	all around the highway.
235.91	We have embedded the drug
235.91	into devices that look like this one.
241.224	They are flexible enough
241.224	that they can be folded
246.437	to fit into the catheter,
248.383	so the doctor can implant it
248.383	directly on top of the tumor
252.203	with minimally invasive surgery.
254.603	But they are solid enough
254.603	that once they are positioned
258.397	on top of the tumor,
260.112	they will act as a cage.
261.905	They will actually
261.905	physically prevent the tumor
265.08	from entering other organs,
266.779	controlling the metastasis.
270.459	The devices are also biodegradable.
272.767	That means that once in the body,
274.541	they start dissolving,
276.45	delivering the drug only locally,
276.45	slowly and more effectively
281.837	than what is done with the current
281.837	whole-body treatment.
285.344	In pre-clinical study,
285.344	we have demonstrated
288.173	that this localized approach
290.196	is able to improve by 12 times
290.196	the response to treatment.
294.758	So we took a drug that is already known
297.559	and by just delivering it locally
297.559	where it's needed the most,
301.414	we allow a response
301.414	that is 12 times more powerful,
305.087	reducing the systemic toxic effect.
309.039	We are working relentlessly to bring
309.039	this technology to the next level.
313.257	We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
316.128	and the animal model required
316.128	prior to asking the FDA for approval
320.231	for clinical trials.
322.969	Currently, the majority of patients
322.969	will die from pancreatic cancer.
328.124	We are hoping that one day,
329.983	we can reduce their pain,
329.983	extend their life
333.278	and potentially make pancreatic cancer
336.335	a curable disease.
338.257	By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
341.001	we don't only make it
341.001	more powerful and less toxic,
344.782	we are also opening the door
344.782	to finding new innovative solutions
349.591	for almost all other impossible problems
352.33	in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
355.628	Thank you very much.
356.813	(Applause)
