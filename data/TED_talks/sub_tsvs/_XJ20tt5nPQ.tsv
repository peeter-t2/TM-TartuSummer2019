12	Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.
13.876	That's a scientist who 
13.876	works in the rainforest
16.121	to document how people use local plants.
19.552	I've been doing this for a long time,
22.608	and I want to tell you,
24.377	these people know these forests
24.377	and these medicinal treasures
27.344	better than we do and
27.344	better than we ever will.
30.493	But also, these cultures,
32.801	these indigenous cultures,
34.345	are disappearing much faster
34.345	than the forests themselves.
39.024	And the greatest and
39.024	most endangered species
41.974	in the Amazon Rainforest
43.778	is not the jaguar,
45.618	it's not the harpy eagle,
47.343	it's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.
51.164	Now four years ago, I injured my 
51.164	foot in a climbing accident
54.613	and I went to the doctor.
56.147	She gave me heat,
57.741	she gave me cold, aspirin,
60.445	narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories,
63.675	cortisone shots.
65.542	It didn't work.
67.559	Several months later,
69.396	I was in the northeast Amazon,
71.613	walked into a village,
73.606	"and the shaman said, ""You're limping."""
76.073	And I'll never forget
76.073	this as long as I live.
78.632	He looked me in the face and he said,
80.466	"""Take off your shoe and give "
80.466	"me your machete."""
84.382	(Laughter)
86.587	He walked over to a palm tree
88.571	and carved off a fern,
90.117	threw it in the fire,
91.429	applied it to my foot,
93.121	threw it in a pot of water,
94.95	and had me drink the tea.
97.076	The pain disappeared for seven months.
100.518	When it came back, I went
100.518	to see the shaman again.
102.444	He gave me the same treatment,
104.249	and I've been cured for three years now.
107.999	Who would you rather be treated by?
110.671	(Applause)
113.557	Now, make no mistake — Western medicine
115.785	is the most successful system
115.785	of healing ever devised,
118.895	but there's plenty of holes in it.
121.47	Where's the cure for breast cancer?
123.508	Where's the cure for schizophrenia?
125.378	Where's the cure for acid reflux?
127.772	Where's the cure for insomnia?
129.969	The fact is that these people
131.888	can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
133.924	cure things we cannot.
135.57	Here you see a medicine man
135.57	in the northeast Amazon
137.952	treating leishmaniasis,
139.532	a really nasty protozoal disease
141.863	that afflicts 12 million
141.863	people around the world.
144.824	Western treatment are
144.824	injections of antimony.
147.527	They're painful, they're expensive,
150.028	and they're probably
150.028	not good for your heart;
152.139	it's a heavy metal.
153.779	This man cures it with three plants
153.779	from the Amazon Rainforest.
157.397	This is the magic frog.
159.712	My colleague, the late
159.712	great Loren McIntyre,
162.448	discoverer of the source 
162.448	lake of the Amazon,
164.612	Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,
167.056	was lost on the Peru-Brazil
167.056	border about 30 years ago.
170.161	He was rescued by a group of 
170.161	isolated Indians called the Matsés.
174.756	They beckoned for him to follow
174.756	them into the forest, which he did.
178.535	There, they took out palm leaf baskets.
180.959	There, they took out these
180.959	green monkey frogs —
183.441	these are big suckers,
183.441	they're like this —
185.439	and they began licking them.
187.962	It turns out, they're
187.962	highly hallucinogenic.
190.93	McIntyre wrote about this and it was read 
190.93	by the editor of High Times magazine.
195.832	You see that ethnobotanists have 
195.832	friends in all sorts of strange cultures.
200.183	This guy decided he would go down
200.183	to the Amazon and give it a whirl,
203.616	or give it a lick, and 
203.616	he did, and he wrote,
207.35	"""My blood pressure went through the roof,"
209.835	I lost full control of
209.835	my bodily functions,
212.025	I passed out in a heap,
213.855	I woke up in a hammock six hours later,
216.381	"felt like God for two days."""
218.555	(Laughter)
219.864	An Italian chemist read this and said,
221.747	"""I'm not really interested in the theological "
221.747	aspects of the green monkey frog.
225.583	What's this about the
225.583	"change in blood pressure?"""
228.168	Now, this is an Italian chemist
230.572	who's working on a new treatment
230.572	for high blood pressure
233.187	based on peptides in the skin
233.187	of the green monkey frog,
236.037	and other scientists are looking
238.319	at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.
242.16	How ironic if these isolated 
242.16	Indians and their magic frog
245.749	prove to be one of the cures.
247.858	Here's an ayahuasca shaman
250.047	in the northwest Amazon, in
250.047	the middle of a yage ceremony.
252.96	I took him to Los Angeles to
252.96	meet a foundation officer
255.974	looking for support for monies
255.974	to protect their culture.
259.462	This fellow looked at the
259.462	medicine man, and he said,
262.06	"""You didn't go to "
262.06	"medical school, did you?"""
265.207	"The shaman said, ""No, I did not."""
267.037	"He said, ""Well, then what can"
267.037	"you know about healing?"""
269.668	The shaman looked at him and he said,
271.432	"""You know what? If you have "
271.432	an infection, go to a doctor.
275.248	But many human afflictions are diseases 
275.248	of the heart, the mind and the spirit.
281.809	Western medicine can't 
281.809	"touch those. I cure them."""
286.361	(Applause)
290.55	But all is not rosy in learning from
290.55	nature about new medicines.
294.058	This is a viper from Brazil,
296.345	the venom of which was studied at
296.345	the Universidade de São Paulo here.
299.603	It was later developed
299.603	into ACE inhibitors.
303.054	This is a frontline treatment
303.054	for hypertension.
305.45	Hypertension causes over 10 percent
308.084	of all deaths on the planet every day.
310.458	This is a $4 billion industry
312.542	based on venom from a Brazilian snake,
314.734	and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.
318.068	This is not an acceptable
318.068	way of doing business.
323.056	The rainforest has been called the 
323.056	greatest expression of life on Earth.
326.67	There's a saying in Suriname
326.67	that I dearly love:
329.336	"""The rainforests hold answers"
329.336	"to questions we have yet to ask."""
334.945	But as you all know,
334.945	it's rapidly disappearing.
337.822	Here in Brazil, in the Amazon,
339.938	around the world.
341.335	I took this picture from a small plane
343.505	flying over the eastern border
343.505	of the Xingu indigenous reserve
346.453	in the state of Mato Grosso
346.453	to the northwest of here.
349.502	The top half of the picture,
351.155	you see where the Indians live.
352.857	The line through the middle
354.414	is the eastern border of the reserve.
356.761	Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.
360.239	Top half wonder drugs,
362.411	bottom half just a bunch
362.411	of skinny-ass cows.
365.996	Top half carbon sequestered
365.996	in the forest where it belongs,
369.469	bottom half carbon in the atmosphere
372.143	where it's driving climate change.
374.546	In fact, the number two cause
377.034	of carbon being released
377.034	into the atmosphere
379.573	is forest destruction.
382.411	But in talking about destruction,
384.227	it's important to keep in mind
386.171	that the Amazon is the mightiest
386.171	landscape of all.
390.174	It's a place of beauty and wonder.
392.626	The biggest anteater in the world
395.117	lives in the rain forest,
397.065	tips the scale at 90 pounds.
399.468	The goliath bird-eating spider
401.519	is the world's largest spider.
403.467	It's found in the Amazon as well.
405.768	The harpy eagle wingspan
405.768	is over seven feet.
409.656	And the black cayman —
412.453	these monsters can tip the
412.453	scale at over half a ton.
415.509	They're known to be man-eaters.
418.858	The anaconda, the largest snake,
421.648	the capybara, the largest rodent.
424.375	A specimen from here in Brazil
426.037	tipped the scale at 201 pounds.
429.733	Let's visit where these creatures live,
432.028	the northeast Amazon,
433.864	home to the Akuriyo tribe.
435.563	Uncontacted peoples hold a 
435.563	mystical and iconic role
441.076	in our imagination.
443.211	These are the people who 
443.211	know nature best.
445.548	These are the people who truly live
447.399	in total harmony with nature.
450.457	By our standards, some would
450.457	dismiss these people as primitive.
453.421	"""They don't know how to make fire,"
455.062	or they didn't when they
455.062	"were first contacted."""
457.314	But they know the forest far
457.314	better than we do.
460.458	The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,
463.452	and other Indians look up to them
465.502	as being the true masters
465.502	of the emerald realm.
469.757	Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.
472.072	When I was a teenager rocking out
473.815	to the Rolling Stones in my
473.815	hometown of New Orleans,
476.259	Pohnay was a forest nomad
478.794	roaming the jungles of
478.794	the northeast Amazon
481.291	in a small band, looking for game,
484.531	looking for medicinal plants,
486.626	looking for a wife,
488.023	in other small nomadic bands.
490.301	But it's people like these
492.779	that know things that we don't,
494.712	and they have lots of 
494.712	lessons to teach us.
498.832	However, if you go into most of
498.832	the forests of the Amazon,
502.23	there are no indigenous peoples.
504.037	This is what you find:
505.971	rock carvings which indigenous peoples,
509.12	uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen
509.12	the edge of the stone axe.
513.55	These cultures that once danced,
515.622	made love, sang to the gods,
518.203	worshipped the forest,
519.786	all that's left is an imprint in stone,
519.786	as you see here.
523.434	Let's move to the western Amazon,
526.004	which is really the epicenter
526.004	of isolated peoples.
529.091	Each of these dots represents
531.129	a small, uncontacted tribe,
533.422	and the big reveal today is we believe
533.422	there are 14 or 15 isolated groups
538.381	in the Colombian Amazon alone.
541.762	Why are these people isolated?
544.004	They know we exist, they
544.004	know there's an outside world.
546.711	This is a form of resistance.
548.731	They have chosen to remain isolated,
550.866	and I think it is their
550.866	human right to remain so.
554.439	Why are these the tribes
554.439	that hide from man?
556.862	Here's why.
557.967	Obviously, some of this 
557.967	was set off in 1492.
561.225	But at the turn of the last century
563.247	was the rubber trade.
565.072	The demand for natural rubber,
566.722	which came from the Amazon,
568.628	set off the botanical
568.628	equivalent of a gold rush.
571.802	Rubber for bicycle tires,
573.678	rubber for automobile tires,
575.296	rubber for zeppelins.
577.047	It was a mad race to get that rubber,
580.054	and the man on the left, Julio Arana,
582.732	is one of the true thugs of the story.
585.799	His people, his company,
587.492	and other companies like them
589.594	killed, massacred, tortured,
589.594	butchered Indians
592.749	like the Witotos you see on the
592.749	right hand side of the slide.
597.656	Even today, when people
597.656	come out of the forest,
600.081	the story seldom has a happy ending.
602.786	These are Nukaks. They
602.786	were contacted in the '80s.
605.906	Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.
609.863	And remember, these
609.863	are preliterate societies.
612.095	The elders are the libraries.
613.875	Every time a shaman dies,
615.653	it's as if a library has burned down.
619.042	They have been forced off their lands.
621.538	The drug traffickers have
621.538	taken over the Nukak lands,
625.761	and the Nukaks live as beggars
627.739	in public parks in eastern Colombia.
630.981	From the Nukak lands, I want to 
630.981	take you to the southwest,
633.881	to the most spectacular 
633.881	landscape in the world:
636.528	Chiribiquete National Park.
638.601	It was surrounded by three isolated tribes
640.74	and thanks to the Colombian government
640.74	and Colombian colleagues,
643.771	it has now expanded.
645.717	It's bigger than the state of Maryland.
647.694	It is a treasure trove
647.694	of botanical diversity.
651.135	It was first explored botanically in 1943
654.09	by my mentor, Richard Schultes,
655.88	seen here atop the Bell Mountain,
658.75	the sacred mountains of the Karijonas.
661.185	And let me show you
661.185	what it looks like today.
663.476	Flying over Chiribiquete,
665.405	realize that these lost world
665.405	mountains are still lost.
667.983	No scientist has been atop them.
669.788	In fact, nobody has been
669.788	atop the Bell Mountain
671.981	since Schultes in '43.
673.94	And we'll end up here
673.94	with the Bell Mountain
676.812	just to the east of the picture.
679.07	Let me show you what it looks like today.
681.76	Not only is this a treasure
681.76	trove of botanical diversity,
684.937	not only is it home to
684.937	three isolated tribes,
687.715	but it's the greatest treasure trove
689.503	of pre-Colombian art in the world:
692.828	over 200,000 paintings.
695.367	The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen
698.011	described this as the Sistine Chapel
698.011	of the Amazon Rainforest.
703.697	But move from Chiribiquete
703.697	down to the southeast,
706.271	again in the Colombian Amazon.
708.082	Remember, the Colombian Amazon
708.082	is bigger than New England.
710.964	The Amazon's a big forest,
712.581	and Brazil's got a big part of it,
714.212	but not all of it.
715.698	Moving down to these two national parks,
717.286	Cahuinari and Puré
719.435	in the Colombian Amazon —
720.781	that's the Brazilian
720.781	border to the right —
723.469	it's home to several groups
725.843	of isolated and uncontacted peoples.
727.587	To the trained eye, you
727.587	can look at the roofs
729.716	of these malocas, these longhouses,
731.807	and see that there's cultural diversity.
733.728	These are, in fact, different tribes.
735.776	As isolated as these areas are,
738.34	let me show you how the 
738.34	outside world is crowding in.
742.595	Here we see trade and transport
742.595	increased in Putumayo.
745.316	With the diminishment of
745.316	the Civil War in Colombia,
747.756	the outside world is showing up.
750.368	To the north, we have illegal gold mining,
753.12	also from the east, from Brazil.
754.812	There's increased hunting and fishing
754.812	for commercial purposes.
758.452	We see illegal logging
758.452	coming from the south,
761.509	and drug runners are trying to
761.509	move through the park
764.164	and get into Brazil.
766.37	This, in the past, is why you didn't mess
769.128	with isolated Indians.
770.749	And if it looks like this
770.749	picture is out of focus
772.613	because it was taken
772.613	in a hurry, here's why.
775.899	(Laughter)
778.416	This looks like — (Applause)
784.303	This looks like a hangar
784.303	from the Brazilian Amazon.
786.823	This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.
789.566	A group called Los Carpinteros.
791.223	This is their perception of why you 
791.223	shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.
795.574	But the world is changing.
797.551	These are Mashco-Piros
797.551	on the Brazil-Peru border
800.319	who stumbled out of the jungle
802.46	because they were essentially chased out
804.414	by drug runners and timber people.
806.792	And in Peru, there's
806.792	a very nasty business.
809.425	It's called human safaris.
811.245	They will take you in to isolated
811.245	groups to take their picture.
814.277	Of course, when you give them 
814.277	clothes, when you give them tools,
817.323	you also give them diseases.
819.221	"We call these ""inhuman safaris."""
822.068	These are Indians again 
822.068	on the Peru border,
824.166	who were overflown by flights
824.166	sponsored by missionaries.
827.384	They want to get in there
827.384	and turn them into Christians.
830.315	We know how that turns out.
832.51	What's to be done?
834.284	Introduce technology
834.284	to the contacted tribes,
836.71	not the uncontacted tribes,
838.612	in a culturally sensitive way.
841.745	This is the perfect marriage of 
841.745	ancient shamanic wisdom
845.891	and 21st century technology.
848.717	We've done this now with over 30 tribes,
851.728	mapped, managed and increased protection
854.652	of over 70 million acres
854.652	of ancestral rainforest.
858.555	(Applause)
863.828	So this allows the Indians to take control
867.05	of their environmental
867.05	and cultural destiny.
870.577	They also then set up guard houses
872.566	to keep outsiders out.
874.572	These are Indians, trained
874.572	as indigenous park rangers,
877.211	patrolling the borders
878.867	and keeping the outside world at bay.
881.948	This is a picture of actual contact.
884.707	These are Chitonahua Indians
886.614	on the Brazil-Peru border.
888.617	They've come out of the jungle
890.321	asking for help.
892.062	They were shot at,
893.468	their malocas, their 
893.468	longhouses, were burned.
896.205	Some of them were massacred.
898.708	Using automatic weapons to 
898.708	slaughter uncontacted peoples
904.494	is the single most despicable and 
904.494	disgusting human rights abuse
908.726	on our planet today, and it has to stop.

918.205	But let me conclude by saying,
920.928	this work can be spiritually rewarding,
923.792	but it's difficult and
923.792	it can be dangerous.
926.636	Two colleagues of mine
926.636	passed away recently
929.538	in the crash of a small plane.
931.903	They were serving the forest
933.681	to protect those uncontacted tribes.
936.429	So the question is, in conclusion,
938.366	is what the future holds.
940.191	These are the Uray people in Brazil.
942.288	What does the future hold for them,
943.969	and what does the future hold for us?
946.64	Let's think differently.
949.121	Let's make a better world.
950.918	If the climate's going to change,
952.836	let's have a climate that changes for
952.836	the better rather than the worse.
956.919	Let's live on a planet
960.084	full of luxuriant vegetation,
962.904	in which isolated peoples
965.01	can remain in isolation,
966.869	can maintain that mystery
968.842	and that knowledge
970.368	if they so choose.
972.013	Let's live in a world
974.128	where the shamans live in these forests
976.497	and heal themselves and us
979.441	with their mystical plants
982.178	and their sacred frogs.
984.235	Thanks again.
986.082	(Applause)
