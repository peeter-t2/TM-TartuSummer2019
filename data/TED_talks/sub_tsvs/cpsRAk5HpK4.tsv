15.918	So I'd like to start by focusing on
18.654	the world's most dangerous animal.
21.19	Now, when you talk about dangerous animals,
23.35	most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.
26.397	But of course the most dangerous animal
28.074	is the mosquito.
29.937	The mosquito has killed more humans
32.096	than any other creature in human history.
35.085	In fact, probably adding them all together,
37.075	the mosquito has killed more humans.
39.261	And the mosquito has killed more humans than wars
41.92	and plague.
43.619	And you would think, would you not,
46.192	that with all our science, with all our advances in society,
50.139	with better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,
55.051	wealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,
58.251	and hence reduce this disease.
60.944	And that's not really the case.
64.286	If it was the case, we wouldn't have
66.406	between 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,
70.993	and we wouldn't have
72.718	a million and a half deaths from malaria,
76.66	and we wouldn't have a disease
79.36	that was relatively unknown 50 years ago
81.896	now suddenly turned into
84.728	the largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,
87.96	and that's called dengue fever.
90.653	So 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,
93.384	no one certainly in the European environment.
96.376	But dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,
100.009	infects between 50 and 100 million people every year,
103.496	so that's equivalent to the whole of the population
105.832	of the U.K. being infected every year.
108.76	Other estimates put that number at roughly double
111.872	that number of infections.
115.83	And dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.
120.265	In the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue
123.315	has grown thirtyfold.
125.533	Now let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,
128.036	for those who don't know.
129.624	Now let's assume you go on holiday.
131.833	Let's assume you go to the Caribbean,
133.595	or you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,
135.988	Asia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.
139.947	You might go to India, the Far East.
141.67	It doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,
144.283	and it's the same disease. You're at risk.
147.195	And let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito
149.871	that's carrying that virus.
151.432	Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms.
154.427	They could be quite mild.
156.205	You could develop nausea, headache,
158.306	your muscles could feel like they're contracting,
160.745	and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.
164.831	And that's the nickname given to this disease.
167.055	It's called breakbone fever,
168.648	because that's how you can feel.
170.992	Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten
173.929	by this mosquito, and you've had this disease,
176.191	your body develops antibodies,
178.813	so if you're bitten again with that strain,
183.227	it doesn't affect you.
184.943	But it's not one virus, it's four,
187.863	and the same protection that gives you the antibodies
190.839	and protects you from the same virus that you had before
194.151	actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.
197.217	So the next time you get dengue fever,
199.952	if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,
202.592	you're likely to get worse symptoms,
205.223	and you're more likely to get the more severe forms,
207.824	hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.
211.086	So you don't want dengue once,
212.505	and you certainly don't want it again.
215.246	So why is it spreading so fast?
218.529	And the answer is this thing.
220.625	This is Aedes aegypti.
222.399	Now this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,
225.609	out of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.
229.051	Now, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel
232.179	about 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.
235.908	What they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,
238.293	particularly the eggs.
239.703	They will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,
244.4	any birdbath, any flower pot,
246.35	anywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,
249.09	and if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,
252.712	if it's anywhere near transport,
255.361	those eggs will then get transported around the world.
258.545	And that's what's happened. Mankind has transported
260.968	these eggs all the way around the world,
262.974	and these insects have infested over 100 countries,
266.672	and there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries
269.37	where this mosquito resides.
272.362	To give you just a couple of examples
273.946	how fast this has happened,
276.462	"in the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, ""We have no Aedes aegypti,"""
281.978	and currently they spend about a billion dollars now
284.328	a year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,
287.128	just one species of mosquito.
292.229	Two days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,
295.772	I saw a Reuters report that said
297.736	Madeira had had their first cases of dengue,
300.37	about 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.
304.19	That's two days ago.
306.004	Interestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,
311.185	and here we are, a few years later,
313.242	first cases of dengue.
314.569	So the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,
317.928	dengue will follow.
320.242	Once you've got the mosquito in your area,
322.433	anyone coming into that area with dengue,
324.802	mosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,
327.745	somewhere else, somewhere else,
328.709	and you'll get an epidemic.
332.824	So we must be good at killing mosquitos.
334.732	I mean, that can't be very difficult.
336.629	Well, there's two principle ways.
339.449	The first way is that you use larvicides.
342.821	You use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.
345.633	Now in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.
348.433	You've got to get your chemical into every puddle,
350.618	every birdbath, every tree trunk.
352.866	It's just not practical.
355.908	The second way you can do it
357.424	is actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.
360.738	This is a picture of fogging.
362.964	Here what someone is doing
365.409	is mixing up chemical in a smoke
368.323	and basically spreading that through the environment.
371.337	You could do the same with a space spray.
374.297	This is really unpleasant stuff,
375.865	and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase
378.267	in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.
382.923	So it's not very effective, but it's probably
385.012	the best thing we've got at the moment.
387.907	Having said that, actually, your best form of protection
390.059	and my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt
392.444	and a little bit of DEET to go with it.
395.868	So let's start again. Let's design a product,
399.557	right from the word go, and decide what we want.
402.833	Well we clearly need something that is effective
405.428	at reducing the mosquito population.
407.736	There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.
410.168	We want something that gets that population right the way down
413.26	so it can't get the disease transmission.
416.276	Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.
419.58	We are going to use it in and around humans.
421.756	It has to be safe.
423.319	We don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.
425.549	We don't want to do anything that you can't undo.
428.783	Maybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.
433.876	Fine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.
436.75	We want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,
440.022	because there's an awful lot of countries involved,
441.975	and some of them are emerging markets,
443.981	some of them emerging countries, low-income.
447.543	And finally, you want something that's species-specific.
449.918	You want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,
452.706	but you don't really want to get all the other insects.
455.694	Some are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.
458.91	This one's not. It's invaded you.
460.748	But you don't want to get all of the insects.
463.43	You just want to get this one.
465.089	And most of the time, you'll find this insect
467.948	lives in and around your home,
469.383	so this -- whatever we do has got to get to that insect.
473.307	It's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,
475.69	into the kitchens.
477.484	Now there are two features of mosquito biology
481.129	that really help us in this project,
483.029	and that is, firstly, males don't bite.
486.901	It's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.
490.01	The male can't bite you, won't bite you,
492.411	doesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.
494.714	It's just the female.
496.373	And the second is a phenomenon
498.346	that males are very, very good at finding females.
502.562	If there's a male mosquito that you release,
505.21	and if there's a female around, that male will find the female.
510.053	So basically, we've used those two factors.
513.871	So here's a typical situation,
515.539	male meets female, lots of offspring.
518.107	A single female will lay about
519.836	up to 100 eggs at a time,
521.631	up to about 500 in her lifetime.
524.115	Now if that male is carrying a gene
527.136	which causes the death of the offspring,
529.754	then the offspring don't survive,
532.435	and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,
535.866	you have none.
538.487	And if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,
541.606	that the offspring will actually die at different stages,
544.479	but I'll call them sterile for now.
546.068	If you put more sterile males out into the environment,
549.624	then the females are more likely to find a sterile male
552.912	than a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.
558.751	So the males will go out, they'll look for females,
561.146	they'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.
564.97	If they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.
567.973	They only live a few days.
571.707	And that's exactly where we are.
573.941	So this is technology that was developed
575.571	in Oxford University a few years ago.
578.123	The company itself, Oxitec, we've been working
580.544	for the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar
583.093	development pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.
586.535	So about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,
590.645	to get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.
594.037	And then we've gone out into the big outdoors,
596.524	always with local community consent,
598.125	always with the necessary permits.
600.31	So we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,
603.373	a small one in Malaysia,
604.919	and two more now in Brazil.
609.254	And what's the result?
610.987	Well, the result has been very good.
614.295	In about four months of release,
617.119	we've brought that population of mosquitos
619.415	— in most cases we're dealing with villages here
621.958	of about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,
625.23	starting small —
626.668	we've taken that mosquito population down
628.859	by about 85 percent in about four months.
632.083	And in fact, the numbers after that get,
634.082	those get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.
637.822	So that's been what we've seen in Cayman,
639.478	it's been what we've seen in Brazil
642.74	in those trials.
644.726	And now what we're doing is we're going through a process
647.038	to scale up to a town of about 50,000,
649.871	so we can see this work at big scale.
652.244	And we've got a production unit in Oxford,
655.031	or just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.
658.522	We can produce them,
659.726	in a space a bit more than this red carpet,
661.882	I can produce about 20 million a week.
664.406	We can transport them around the world.
666.572	It's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup --
669.594	something the size of a coffee cup
670.883	will hold about three million eggs.
674.21	So freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)
678.028	So we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.
681.332	And for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,
684.428	the Brazilian government themselves have now built
686.316	their own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,
688.748	and we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.
694.223	There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.
696.596	We've separated the males from the females.
699.228	The males have been put in little pots
702.878	and the truck is going down the road
704.962	and they are releasing males as they go.
707.926	It's actually a little bit more precise than that.
709.576	You want to release them so that
711.057	you get good coverage of your area.
713.138	So you take a Google Map, you divide it up,
715.929	work out how far they can fly,
717.813	and make sure you're releasing such that you get
719.788	coverage of the area, and then you go back,
722.686	and within a very short space of time,
724.46	you're bringing that population right the way down.
728.036	We've also done this in agriculture.
730.468	We've got several different species of agriculture coming along,
734.54	and I'm hoping that soon
736.448	we'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back
739.244	and start looking at malaria.
742.326	So that's where we stand at the moment,
744.375	and I've just got a few final thoughts,
746.904	which is that this is another way in which biology
750.348	is now coming in to supplement chemistry
754.337	in some of our societal advances in this area,
758.08	and these biological approaches are coming in
760.368	in very different forms,
762.769	and when you think about genetic engineering,
765.091	we've now got enzymes for industrial processing,
768.097	enzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.
771.031	We have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,
773.833	we have new vaccines,
775.149	all using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.
779.233	And I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.
782.746	I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies
785.642	don't work well or have become unacceptable.
788.714	And although the techniques are similar,
792.071	the outcomes are very, very different,
793.612	and if you take our approach, for example,
795.126	and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,
797.551	both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.
801.843	Both have a side benefit,
803.986	which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
807.695	But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,
811.656	for example, and give it an advantage,
814.4	what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito
817.495	and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,
821.584	rendering it unable to reproduce effectively.
824.568	So for the mosquito, it's a dead end.
828.168	Thank you very much. (Applause)
