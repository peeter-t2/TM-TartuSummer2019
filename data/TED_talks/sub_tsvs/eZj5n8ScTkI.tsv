12.671	Election night 2008
15.612	was a night that tore me in half.
18.971	It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.
23.36	[One hundred and forty-three] 
23.36	years after the end of slavery,
27.733	and [43] years after the passage
30.01	of the Voting Rights Act,
31.75	an African-American was elected president.
35.79	Many of us never thought that this was possible
39.537	until the moment that it happened.
42.309	And in many ways, it was the climax
45.524	of the black civil rights movement
47.33	in the United States.
49.388	I was in California that night,
51.237	which was ground zero at the time
53.123	for another movement:
54.947	the marriage equality movement.
57.94	Gay marriage was on the ballot
59.746	in the form of Proposition 8,
62.83	and as the election returns started to come in,
66.535	it became clear that the right
68.651	for same sex couples to marry,
71.024	which had recently been granted
71.024	by the California courts,
74.076	was going to be taken away.
76.365	So on the same night
78.548	that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,
82.83	the lesbian and gay community suffered
85.322	one of our most painful defeats.
88.6	And then it got even worse.
92.127	Pretty much immediately,
94.121	African-Americans started to be blamed
96.567	for the passage of Proposition 8.
98.899	This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said
102.496	that blacks had voted for the measure
104.255	by something like 70 percent.
106.74	This turned out not to be true,
108.455	but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,
114.029	and was grabbed on by the media.
117.286	I couldn't tear myself away from the coverage.
119.972	I listened to some gay commentator say
122.999	that the African-American community
125.388	was notoriously homophobic,
127.403	and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,
130.677	we wanted to take away other people's rights.
132.81	There were even reports of racist epithets
135.617	being thrown at some of the participants
137.534	of the gay rights rallies
139.2	that took place after the election.
141.819	And on the other side,
143.81	some African-Americans dismissed or ignored
147.631	homophobia that was indeed real in our community.
151.15	And others resented this comparison
153.8	between gay rights and civil rights,
156.13	and once again, the sinking feeling
159.675	that two minority groups
161.694	of which I'm both a part of
164.144	were competing with each other
167.086	instead of supporting each other
169.777	overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.
174.303	Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,
177.436	so after going through my pissed off stage
180.479	and yelling at the television and radio,
183.559	my next instinct was
185.849	to make a movie.
187.928	And what guided me in making this film was,
192.28	how was this happening?
194.078	How was it that the gay rights movement
197.278	was being pitted against the civil rights movement?
200.589	And this wasn't just an abstract question.
203.834	I'm a beneficiary of both movements,
206.189	so this was actually personal.
209.273	But then something else happened
210.868	after that election in 2008.
213.829	The march towards gay equality
216.217	accelerated at a pace
218.266	that surprised and shocked everyone,
221.288	and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,
225.91	our institutions and our entire country.
228.963	And so it started to become increasingly clear to me
232.828	that this pitting of the two movements
234.926	against each other actually didn't make sense,
238.508	and that they were in fact
239.74	much, much more interconnected,
243.061	and that, in fact, some of the way
245.251	that the gay rights movement has been able
247.57	to make such incredible gains so quickly
251.145	is that it's used some of the same tactics
253.193	and strategies that were first laid down
256.88	by the civil rights movement.
258.74	Let's just look at a few of these strategies.
262.493	First off, it's really interesting to see,
264.772	to actually visually see, how quick
266.74	the gay rights movement has made its gains,
268.81	if you look at a few of the major events
271.996	on a timeline of both freedom movements.
275.72	Now, there are tons of milestones
279.302	in the civil rights movement,
280.523	but the first one we're going to start with
282.416	is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.
286.312	This was a protest campaign
288.9	against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation
291.845	on their public transit system,
293.852	and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks
296.711	refused to give up her seat to a white person.
299.839	The campaign lasted a year,
302.117	and it galvanized the civil rights movement
304.216	like nothing had before it.
307.183	And I call this strategy the
310.035	"""I'm tired of your foot on my neck"" strategy."
314.962	So gays and lesbians have been in society
319.303	since societies began,
321.77	but up until the mid-20th century,
324.377	homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.
328.762	So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,
332.872	a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.
337.276	It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,
340.495	and it's where a group of LGBT patrons
343.71	fought back against police beatings
346.392	at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked
348.348	three days of rioting.
350.54	Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks
353.266	were at the forefront of this rebellion,
355.197	and it's a really interesting example
357.466	of the intersection of our struggles against racism,
360.677	homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.
365.37	After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups
368.932	sprang up all over the country,
371.271	and the modern gay rights 
371.271	movement as we know it took off.
375.891	So the next moment to look at on the timeline
379.085	is the 1963 March on Washington.
382.23	This was a seminal event
382.23	in the civil rights movement
385.365	and it's where African-Americans called for both
388.113	civil and economic justice.
391.096	And it's of course where Martin Luther King
393.275	"delivered his famous ""I have a dream"" speech,"
395.538	but what's actually less known
397.533	is that this march was organized
399.868	by a man named Bayard Rustin.
403.178	Bayard was an out gay man,
405.901	and he's considered one of the most brilliant
408.533	strategists of the civil rights movement.
411.45	He later in his life became a fierce advocate
414.196	of LGBT rights as well, and his life
417.073	is testament to the intersection of the struggles.
422.15	The March on Washington
423.467	is one of the high points of the movement,
425.85	and it's where there was a fervent belief
429.02	that African-Americans too
431.215	could be a part of American democracy.
434.02	I call this strategy the
435.88	"""We are visible and many in numbers"" strategy."
440.89	Some early gay activists were actually
443.353	directly inspired by the march,
445.433	and some had taken part.
448.639	Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,
451.66	"""We marched with Martin Luther King,"
453.687	"seven of us from the Mattachine Society"" --"
456.289	which was an early gay rights organization â€”
458.74	"""and from that moment on, we had our own dream"
462.291	"about a gay rights march of similar proportions."""
465.44	Several years later, a series of marches took place,
469.13	each one gaining the momentum
471.475	of the gay freedom struggle.
473.281	The first one was in 1979,
475.718	and the second one took place in 1987.
480.267	The third one was held in 1993.
483.993	Almost a million people showed up,
487.258	and people were so energized and excited
490.799	by what had taken place,
491.899	they went back to their own communities
494.298	and started their own political
495.931	and social organizations,
497.621	further increasing the visibility of the movement.
501.512	The day of that march, October 11,
503.429	was then declared National Coming Out Day,
506.09	and is still celebrated all over the world.
508.984	These marches set the groundwork
511.505	for the historic changes that we see happening
514.225	today in the United States.
517.073	"And lastly, the ""Loving"" strategy."
520.614	The name speaks for itself.
522.79	In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled
525.603	in Loving v. Virginia,
527.492	and invalidated all laws
529.612	that prohibited interracial marriage.
532.845	This is considered one of the Supreme Court's
534.76	landmark civil rights cases.
538.097	In 1996, President Clinton signed
541.01	the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,
544.581	and that made the federal government
546.92	only have to recognize marriages
549.307	between a man and a woman.
553.276	In United States v. Windsor,
555.69	a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor
558.837	sued the federal government
560.8	when she was forced to pay estate taxes
563.546	on her deceased wife's property,
565.048	something that heterosexual 
565.048	couples don't have to do.
568.365	And as the case wound its way
570.674	through the lower courts,
572.43	the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.
576.267	When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,
578.561	the Supreme Court agreed,
580.284	and DOMA was thrown out.
582.737	It was incredible.
585.131	But the gay marriage movement
586.778	has been making gains for years now.
590.365	To date, 17 states
592.93	have passed laws allowing marriage equality.
595.509	It's become the de facto battle
598.187	for gay equality,
600.71	and it seems like daily,
602.36	laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,
605.24	even in places like Texas and Utah,
607.827	which no one saw coming.
611.145	So a lot has changed
613.14	since that night in 2008
615.402	when I felt torn in half.
617.86	I did go on to make that film.
620.21	It's a documentary film,
621.887	"and it's called ""The New Black,"""
623.95	and it looks at how the African-American community
626.905	is grappling with the gay rights issue
628.918	in light of the gay marriage movement
631.364	and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.
634.925	And I wanted to capture
636.717	some of this incredible change that was happening,
639.798	and as luck or politics would have it,
642.89	another marriage battle started gearing up,
645.886	this time in Maryland,
647.51	where African-Americans make up 30 percent
649.997	of the electorate.
651.199	So this tension between gay rights
654.265	and civil rights started to bubble up once again,
658.229	and I was lucky enough to capture
660.292	how some people were making the connection
663.702	between the movements this time.
666.78	This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes
669.378	and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,
672.632	as they hit the streets of Baltimore
675.22	and try to convince potential voters.
677.557	(Video) Samantha Masters: That's what's up,
677.557	man, this is a righteous man over here.
681.625	Okay, are you registered to vote?
683.91	Man: No.
683.91	Karess Taylor-Hughes: Okay. How old are you?
685.09	Man: 21.
685.09	KTH: 21? You gotta get registered to vote.
686.901	We got to get you registered to vote.
688.691	Man: I ain't voting on no gay shit.
691.007	SM: Okay, why? What's up?
691.007	Man: I ain't with that.
694.041	SM: That's not cool.
695.35	Man: What made you be gay?
695.35	SM: So what made you be straight?
700.362	So what made you be straight?
705.175	Man 2: You can't answer that question. (Laughter)
709.322	KSM: I used to not have the same rights as you,
711.05	but I know that because a black man like yourself
713.304	stood up for a woman like me,
714.723	I know that I've got the same opportunities.
716.532	So you, as a black man, have the opportunity
718.408	to stand up for somebody else.
719.72	Whether you're gay or not,
720.919	these are your brothers and sisters out here,
722.4	and they need you to represent.
723.608	Man 2: Who is you to tell somebody
725.38	who they can't have sex with,
727	who they can't be with?
728.325	They ain't got that power.
730.224	Nobody has that power to say,
730.224	you can't marry that young lady.
732.892	Who has that power? Nobody.
734.696	SM: But you know what?
735.743	Our state has put the power in your hands,
737.853	and so what we need you to do
739.43	is vote for, you gonna vote for 6.
741.91	Man 2: I got you.
743.495	SM: Vote for 6, okay?
743.495	Man 2: I got you.
745.409	KSM: All right, do y'all need
745.409	community service hours?
747.563	You do? All right, you can always volunteer with us
749.487	to get community service hours.
750.918	Y'all want to do that?
752.244	We feed you. We bring you pizza.
754.982	(Laughter) (Applause)
757.672	Yoruba Richen: Thank you.
760.94	What's amazing to me about that clip
762.998	that we just captured as we were filming
766.392	is, it really shows how Karess
769.16	understands the history
769.16	of the civil rights movement,
772.328	but she's not restricted by it.
774.494	She doesn't just limit it to black people.
776.797	She sees it as a blueprint
778.857	for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.
782.461	Maybe because she's younger, she's like 25,
785.39	she's able to do this a little bit more easily,
787.648	but the fact is that Maryland voters
790.787	did pass that marriage equality amendment,
793.913	and in fact it was the first time
796.333	that marriage equality was directly voted on
799.212	and passed by the voters.
801.581	African-Americans supported it at a higher level
804.545	than had ever been recorded.
805.731	It was a complete turnaround from that night
808.72	in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.
813.074	It was, and feels, monumental.
816.874	We in the LGBT community have gone
820.108	from being a pathologized and reviled
824.055	and criminalized group
825.859	to being seen as part of the great human quest
830.166	for dignity and equality.
832.89	We've gone from having to hide our sexuality
836.767	in order to maintain our jobs and our families
839.381	to literally getting a place at the table
842.236	with the president
843.52	and a shout out at his second inauguration.
846.646	I just want to read what he said
848.207	at that inauguration:
850.169	"""We the people declare today"
852.489	that the most evident of truths,
855.525	that all of us are created equal.
858.579	It is the star that guides us still,
861.059	just as it guided our forebears
863.285	through Seneca Falls
864.799	"and Selma and Stonewall."""
869.22	Now we know that everything is not perfect,
873.057	especially when you look at what's happening
874.97	with the LGBT rights issue internationally,
877.953	but it says something about how far we've come
881.504	when our president puts the gay freedom struggle
884.908	in the context of the other great freedom struggles
886.893	of our time: the women's rights movement
889.26	and the civil rights movement.
891.556	His statement demonstrates not only
893.899	the interconnectedness of those movements,
896.571	but how each one borrowed
898.819	and was inspired by the other.
902.084	So just as Martin Luther King
904.832	learned from and borrowed from Gandhi's tactics
907.892	of civil disobedience and nonviolence,
910.131	which became a bedrock of
910.131	the civil rights movement,
913.23	the gay rights movement saw what worked
916.238	in the civil rights movement,
917.73	and they used some of those same strategies
919.959	and tactics to make gains
921.875	at an even quicker pace.
924.91	Maybe one more other reason
926.997	for the relative quick progress
928.792	of the gay rights movement.
930.967	Whereas a lot of us continue to still live
933.847	in racially segregated spaces,
936.516	LGBT folks, we are everywhere.
939.326	We are in urban communities
941.589	and rural communities,
943.072	communities of color, immigrant communities,
945.533	churches and mosques and synagogues.
949.097	We are your mothers and brothers
952.248	and sisters and sons.
955.056	And when someone that you love
957.682	or a family member comes out,
959.562	it may be easier to support their quest for equality.
964.066	And in fact, the gay rights movement
966.245	asks us to support justice and equality
968.92	from a space of love.
971.423	That may be the biggest, greatest gift
973.883	that the movement has given us.
975.738	It calls on us to access that which is most universal
980.821	and most intimate:
982.733	a love of our brother and our sister
985.47	and our neighbor.
987.395	I just want to end with a quote
990.198	by one of our greatest freedom fighters
992.332	who's no longer with us, Nelson Mandela
995.1	of South Africa.
996.403	Nelson Mandela led South Africa
999.304	after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,
1002.664	and out of the ashes of that 
1002.664	legalized racial discrimination,
1007.399	he led South Africa to become the first country
1010.363	in the world to ban discrimination
1013.472	based on sexual orientation within its constitution.
1017.626	Mandela said,
1020.281	"""For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains,"
1025.207	but to live in a way that respects
1028.15	"and enhances the freedom of others."""
1031.399	So as these movements continue on,
1036.077	and as freedom struggles
1036.077	around the world continue on,
1039.038	let's remember that not only are they interconnected,
1042.698	but they must support and enhance each other
1046.589	for us to be truly victorious.
1049.873	Thank you.
1051.848	(Applause)
