12.984	Tell your daughters of this year,
15.28	how we woke needing coffee
17.4	but discovered instead cadavers
17.4	strewn about our morning papers,
21.24	waterlogged facsimiles
21.24	of our sisters, spouses, small children.
26.6	Say to your baby of this year
26.6	when she asks, as she certainly should,
30.24	tell her it was too late coming.
31.84	Admit even in the year we leased freedom,
31.84	we didn't own it outright.
36.32	There were still laws
36.32	for every way we used our privates
39.16	while they pawed at the soft folds of us,
41.68	grabbed with no concern for consent,
44.439	no laws made for the men
44.439	that enforced them.
47.08	We were trained to dodge,
49.52	to wait, to cower and cover,
52.16	to wait more, still, wait.
55.08	We were told to be silent.
57.44	But speak to your girls of this wartime,
59.72	a year preceded by a score of the same,
62.32	so as in two decades before,
64.6	we wiped our eyes,
66.16	laced caskets with flags,
68.08	evacuated the crime scene of the club,
70.28	caterwauled in the street,
71.6	laid our bodies on the concrete
71.6	against the outlines of our fallen,
74.92	"cried, ""Of course we mattered,"""
76.879	chanted for our disappeared.
78.28	The women wept this year.
80.44	They did.
81.68	In the same year, we were ready.
84.16	The year we lost our inhibition
84.16	and moved with courageous abandon
87.28	was also the year we stared down barrels,
89.8	sang of cranes in skies,
89.8	ducked and parried,
92.16	caught gold in hijab,
92.16	collected death threats,
94.64	knew ourselves as patriots,
96	"said, ""We're 35 now, time we settled down"
96	"and found a running mate,"""
99.24	made road maps for infant joy,
99.24	shamed nothing but fear,
102.4	called ourselves fat and meant, of course,
104.68	impeccable.
105.92	This year, we were women,
107.88	not brides or trinkets,
109.68	not an off-brand gender,
111.2	not a concession, but women.
113.36	Instruct your babies.
114.68	Remind them that the year has passed
114.68	to be docile or small.
118.08	Some of us said for the first time
118.08	that we were women,
120.72	took this oath of solidarity seriously.
123.12	Some of us bore children
123.12	and some of us did not,
125.4	and none of us questioned
125.4	whether that made us real
127.84	or appropriate or true.
129.64	When she asks you of this year,
131.8	your daughter, whether your offspring
131.8	or heir to your triumph,
134.729	from her comforted side of history
134.729	teetering towards woman,
137.76	she will wonder and ask voraciously,
140.08	though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,
142.039	she will hold your estimation of it holy,
144.84	"curiously probing, ""Where were you?"
147.36	Did you fight?
147.36	Were you fearful or fearsome?
150.4	What colored the walls of your regret?
152.28	What did you do for women
152.28	in the year it was time?
154.96	This path you made for me,
154.96	which bones had to break?
157.88	Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?
160.16	"And are you a hero?"""
161.4	She will ask the difficult questions.
163.84	She will not care
163.84	about the arc of your brow,
166.04	the weight of your clutch.
167.32	She will not ask of your mentions.
169	Your daughter, for whom you have
169	already carried so much, wants to know
172.4	what you brought, what gift,
172.4	what light did you keep from extinction?
175.92	When they came for victims in the night,
177.88	did you sleep through it
177.88	or were you roused?
180	What was the cost of staying woke?
181.68	What, in the year we said time's up,
181.68	what did you do with your privilege?
185.17	Did you sup on others' squalor?
186.72	Did you look away
186.72	or directly into the flame?
188.88	Did you know your skill
188.88	or treat it like a liability?
191.44	Were you fooled by the epithets
191.44	"of ""nasty"" or ""less than""?"
194.8	Did you teach with an open heart
194.8	or a clenched fist?
197.32	Where were you?
198.56	Tell her the truth. Make it your life.
200.44	"Confirm it. Say, ""Daughter, I stood there"
202.44	with the moment
202.44	drawn on my face like a dagger,
204.68	and flung it back at itself,
206.04	"slicing space for you."""
207.48	Tell her the truth, how you lived
207.48	in spite of crooked odds.
210.32	Tell her you were brave,
211.6	and always, always
211.6	in the company of courage,
213.96	mostly the days
213.96	when you just had yourself.
216.28	Tell her she was born as you were,
218.28	as your mothers before,
218.28	and the sisters beside them,
220.92	in the age of legends, like always.
223.04	Tell her she was born just in time,
225.76	just in time
227.52	to lead.
228.76	(Applause)
