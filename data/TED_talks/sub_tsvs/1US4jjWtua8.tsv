13	Tonight, I want to have a conversation about
14.995	this incredible global issue
16.929	that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,
21.466	something we can all relate to,
22.787	and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth.
25.517	But first, I want to take you on a little journey.
28.794	Let's first visit our planet, but at night,
31.59	and from space.
33.126	This is what our planet looks like from outer space
36.077	at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel
38.215	around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,
41.069	of course, is how dominant the human presence
44.386	on our planet is.
46.45	We see cities, we see oil fields,
49.185	you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,
52.382	that we are dominating much of our planet,
54.946	and mostly through the use of energy
56.719	that we see here at night.
58.453	But let's go back and drop it a little deeper
60.627	and look during the daytime.
62.669	What we see during the day is our landscapes.
66.359	This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rond√¥nia
69.912	in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.
73.502	If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,
76.118	you're going to see a thin white line,
78.644	which is a road that was built in the 1970s.
82.022	If we come back to the same place in 2001,
85.689	what we're going to find is that these roads
87.946	spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,
91.796	at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest
94.937	where there are going to be a few cows.
97.098	These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.
100.41	And these cows are eaten basically in South America,
103.041	in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.
105.825	But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation
108.561	is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,
111.146	especially in this part of the world.
113.374	If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,
116.697	we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,
119.089	here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,
123.225	there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,
126.787	and there's a lone farmer out there
128.099	in the middle of the primeval jungle.
130.662	Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,
135.435	and we'll see that that landscape actually looks
137.963	a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.
140.845	In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.
144.213	These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China
147.086	as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare
150.832	about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals
153.373	animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.
156.803	Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.
159.415	So soybeans have really exploded,
161.207	showing how trade and globalization are
164.832	really responsible for the connections to rainforests
167.704	and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange
169.641	and interconnected world that we have today.
172.357	Well, again and again, what we find as we look
174.678	around the world in our little tour of the world
176.814	is that landscape after landscape after landscape
180.565	have been cleared and altered for growing food
183.334	and other crops.
185.669	So one of the questions we've been asking is,
188.029	how much of the world is used to grow food,
190.517	and where is it exactly, and how can we change that
192.913	into the future, and what does it mean?
195.407	Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,
198.375	using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track
201.295	farming on a global scale.
203.479	And this is what we found, and it's startling.
207.191	This map shows the presence of agriculture
209.982	on planet Earth.
212.046	The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,
215.006	like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.
218.207	That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
222.471	If you put it all together in one place,
224.595	it'd be the size of South America.
227.262	The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures
229.938	and rangelands, where our animals live.
232.155	That area's about 30 million square kilometers,
234.871	or about an Africa's worth of land,
237.29	a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,
240.203	is what you see. And what's left is, like,
242.355	the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,
244.366	or the middle of a rain forest.
246.057	We're using a planet's worth of land already.
249.802	If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent
252.593	of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,
255.305	and it's 60 times larger
257.874	than all the areas we complain about,
260.449	our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.
263.666	Half of humanity lives in cities today,
266.529	but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.
270.465	So this is an amazing kind of result,
272.384	and it really shocked us when we looked at that.
274.561	So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,
277.265	but also we're using a lot of water.
279.971	This is a photograph flying into Arizona,
282.499	and when you look at it, you're like,
283.308	"""What are they growing here?"" It turns out"
284.435	they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert
287.367	using water sprayed on top.
289.755	Now, the irony is, it's probably sold
291.305	in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.
293.981	But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come
296.293	from some place, and it comes from here,
298.837	the Colorado River in North America.
301.477	Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,
304.125	this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,
306.244	kind of an average day, it looks something like this.
309.029	But if we come back today, during a normal condition
311.933	to the exact same location, this is what's left.
315.501	The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,
318.503	or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.
322.059	Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water
324.979	and using it to grow food,
327.386	and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,
330.066	it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.
333.346	We've literally consumed an entire river in North America
336.474	for irrigation.
338.602	Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.
340.358	This probably is: the Aral Sea.
343.178	Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.
346.082	This is in the former Soviet Union
348.141	in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,
350.713	one of the great inland seas of the world.
353.161	But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like
355.473	it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?
358.995	The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,
360.958	you see two little rivers kind of coming down
363.45	through the sand, feeding this basin with water.
366.967	Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains
369.549	far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river
372.482	through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.
375.682	Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water
379.694	to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,
382.047	in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets
385.827	to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.
387.887	They really needed the money.
389.813	Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off
391.809	the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?
394.739	Here it is in 1973,
405.258	and about 11 months ago.
409.923	It's pretty extraordinary.
411.972	Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.
415.163	Imagine that was Lake Superior.
417.823	Imagine that was Lake Huron.
421.097	It's an extraordinary change.
422.704	This is not only a change in water and
425.047	where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals
427.416	of the environment of this region.
429.673	Let's start with this.
430.957	The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.
433.167	Let's put it that way.
434.707	So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.
438.111	There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things
440.055	that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.
442.471	One of those small islands that was remote
444.603	and impossible to get to was a site
446.215	of Soviet biological weapons testing.
448.911	You can walk there today.
450.265	Weather patterns have changed.
451.812	Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only
455.121	in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.
458.071	This is an environmental disaster writ large.
460.951	But let's bring it home.
462.446	This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago
465.175	that he took when he was in the Soviet Union
466.824	a long, long time ago,
468.086	showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.
471.082	You see the canal they dug?
473.24	They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into
475.704	the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up
477.92	because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't
480.384	keep up with the retreating shoreline.
482.554	I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future
484.565	archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about
486.963	"our time in history, and wonder, ""What were you thinking?"""
489.783	Well, that's the future we have to look forward to.
492.811	We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water
495.724	that's sustainable, and agriculture alone
497.916	is 70 percent of that.
500.316	So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.
503.476	We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.
506.82	Usually when we think about the atmosphere,
509.156	we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,
511.804	and mostly around energy,
513.86	but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters
516.496	of greenhouse gases too.
518.548	If you look at carbon dioxide from
520.604	burning tropical rainforest,
522.756	or methane coming from cows and rice,
525.316	or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,
528.229	it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse
531	gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.
534.016	That's more than all our transportation.
535.87	It's more than all our electricity.
537.62	It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.
540.245	It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases
543.355	of any human activity in the world.
545.675	And yet, we don't talk about it very much.
548.301	So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture
551.354	dominating our planet,
553.491	whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,
560.682	We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus
563.531	around the world simply by using fertilizers,
565.994	causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,
568.765	lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest
571.482	driver of biodiversity loss.
574.157	So without a doubt, agriculture is
576.258	the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet
579.938	since the end of the ice age. No question.
582.557	And it rivals climate change in importance.
585.537	And they're both happening at the same time.
588.462	But what's really important here to remember is that
590.834	it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
594.102	In fact, we completely depend on it.
596.282	It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.
600.722	We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,
602.866	fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people
606.722	in the world today, and if anything,
609.458	we're going to have the demands on agriculture
611.488	increase into the future. It's not going to go away.
614.026	It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of
616.257	growing population. We're seven billion people today
619.25	heading towards at least nine,
621.45	probably nine and a half before we're done.
624.242	More importantly, changing diets.
626.619	As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,
629.666	we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,
632.733	which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.
636.194	So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,
640.116	and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,
643.317	where we have to replace oil with other energy sources
646.79	that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels
649.361	and bio-energy sources.
651.14	So you put these together. It's really hard to see
653.893	how we're going to get to the rest of the century
656.245	without at least doubling global agricultural production.
660.573	Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to
662.522	double global ag production around the world?
665.315	Well, we could try to farm more land.
668.003	This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where
670.802	the crops are today, on the right is where they could be
674.296	based on soils and climate, assuming climate change
677.244	doesn't disrupt too much of this,
679.085	which is not a good assumption.
680.973	We could farm more land, but the problem is
683.162	the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.
686.143	They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,
688.181	things we want to protect.
690.615	So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,
693.439	but we'd better not,
694.757	because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do.
698.423	Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint
700.807	of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.
704.592	This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places
706.992	in the world where we could improve yields
709.559	without harming the environment.
711.825	The green areas here show where corn yields,
714.226	just showing corn as an example,
716.376	are already really high, probably the maximum you could
718.977	find on Earth today for that climate and soil,
721.855	but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where
724.206	we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield
726.72	you should be able to get.
728.06	You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,
730.378	but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union
733.238	and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,
735.479	is still a mess agriculturally.
737.703	Now, this would require nutrients and water.
740.336	It's going to either be organic or conventional
742.469	or some mix of the two to deliver that.
744.282	Plants need water and nutrients.
746.447	But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work.
749.655	But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive
751.935	to meeting the food security needs of the future
754.544	and the environmental security needs of the future.
757.807	We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between
760.821	growing food and having a healthy environment work better.
764.53	Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.
767.06	We can grow food in the background --
769.022	that's a soybean field ‚Äî
770.483	and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,
773.61	but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing
776.128	a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.
779.125	In the foreground, we have this prairie
781.133	that's wonderful from the environmental side,
782.691	but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?
785.895	We need to figure out how to bring both of those together
788.432	into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together.
792.542	Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,
794.753	"""Well, isn't blank the answer?"" -- organic food,"
797.985	local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --
802.733	and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,
805.5	but not any one of these is a silver bullet.
808.573	In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.
811.533	And I love silver buckshot. You put it together
814.045	and you've got something really powerful,
816.363	but we need to put them together.
818.763	So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind
821.296	of agriculture that blends the best ideas
823.98	of commercial agriculture and the green revolution
827.085	with the best ideas of organic farming and local food
830.637	and the best ideas of environmental conservation,
834.045	not to have them fighting each other but to have them
835.85	collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,
839.599	"something I call ""terraculture,"" or farming for a whole planet."
844.317	Now, having this conversation has been really hard,
847.301	and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points
849.413	to people to reduce the controversy,
851.716	to increase the collaboration.
853.216	I want to show you a short video that does kind of show
855.763	our efforts right now to bring these sides together
858.093	into a single conversation. So let me show you that.
861.819	(Music)
865.48	"(""Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover"")"
869.137	(Music)
870.578	"(""The world population is growing"
872.226	by 75 million people each year.
875.239	That's almost the size of Germany.
877.672	Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.
880.615	At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.
883.305	And we all need food.
885.073	But how?
886.424	How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?
889.312	We already know climate change is a big problem.
892.557	But it's not the only problem.
893.807	We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.'
896.729	A global crisis in agriculture.
899.277	Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.
905.536	More than 40% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.
908.985	Global croplands cover 16 million km¬≤.
910.991	That's almost the size of South America.
914.184	Global pastures cover 30 million km¬≤.
915.979	That's the size of Africa.
918.054	Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.
922.77	Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.
926.482	We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.
930.856	That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.
934.638	Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.
937.619	Some dry up altogether.
939.643	Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.
943.627	Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.
947.25	Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.
951.133	The consequence?
952.389	Widespread water pollution
954.373	and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.
956.535	Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.
960.909	It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.
963.336	That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,
966.029	or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.
969.005	Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,
971.373	methane from animals and rice fields,
972.749	and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.
974.581	There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.
977.836	And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.
981.367	Here's the dilemma...
982.873	As the world grows by several billion more people,
987.228	We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.
991.812	So where do we go from here?
993.208	We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.
996.011	We need to invest in real solutions:
997.819	incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,
1002.157	gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.
1005.818	We need everyone at the table.
1008.024	Advocates of commercial agriculture,
1009.974	environmental conservation,
1011.121	and organic farming...
1012.582	must work together.
1014.617	There is no single solution.
1016.191	We need collaboration,
1017.8	imagination,
1019.236	determination,
1020.014	because failure is not an option.
1023.673	How do we feed the world without destroying it?
1027.37	Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges
1030.236	in all of human history today:
1032.346	the need to feed nine billion people
1035.02	and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,
1038.774	at the same time protecting our planet
1040.475	for this and future generations.
1043.288	This is going to be one of the hardest things
1044.804	we ever have done in human history,
1046.675	and we absolutely have to get it right,
