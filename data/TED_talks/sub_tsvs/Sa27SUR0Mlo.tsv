12.88	June 2010.
15.76	I landed for the first time
15.76	in Rome, Italy.
19.8	I wasn't there to sightsee.
21.72	I was there to solve world hunger.
25.16	(Laughter)
27.28	That's right.
28.52	I was a 25-year-old PhD student
30.64	armed with a prototype tool
30.64	developed back at my university,
33.76	and I was going to help
33.76	the World Food Programme fix hunger.
37.84	So I strode into the headquarters building
40.6	and my eyes scanned the row of UN flags,
43.44	and I smiled as I thought to myself,
46.84	"""The engineer is here."""
48.48	(Laughter)
50.72	Give me your data.
52.52	I'm going to optimize everything.
54.72	(Laughter)
56.48	Tell me the food that you've purchased,
58.4	tell me where it's going
58.4	and when it needs to be there,
61.04	and I'm going to tell you
61.04	the shortest, fastest, cheapest,
63.8	best set of routes to take for the food.
65.76	We're going to save money,
67.28	we're going to avoid
67.28	delays and disruptions,
69.4	and bottom line,
69.4	we're going to save lives.
72.16	You're welcome.
73.4	(Laughter)
75.12	I thought it was going to take 12 months,
77.12	OK, maybe even 13.
79.8	This is not quite how it panned out.
83.6	Just a couple of months into the project,
83.6	my French boss, he told me,
87.4	"""You know, Mallory,"
89.24	it's a good idea,
90.92	but the data you need
90.92	for your algorithms is not there.
94.28	It's the right idea but at the wrong time,
96.84	and the right idea at the wrong time
99.16	"is the wrong idea."""
100.56	(Laughter)
102.96	Project over.
105.12	I was crushed.
109	When I look back now
110.48	on that first summer in Rome
112.16	and I see how much has changed
112.16	over the past six years,
114.84	it is an absolute transformation.
117.64	It's a coming of age for bringing data
117.64	into the humanitarian world.
122.16	It's exciting. It's inspiring.
124.84	But we're not there yet.
127.32	And brace yourself, executives,
129.64	because I'm going to be putting companies
131.64	on the hot seat to step up
131.64	and play the role that I know they can.
137.52	My experiences back in Rome prove
140.36	using data you can save lives.
143.44	OK, not that first attempt,
145.92	but eventually we got there.
148.52	Let me paint the picture for you.
150.28	Imagine that you have to plan
150.28	breakfast, lunch and dinner
153.04	for 500,000 people,
154.68	and you only have
154.68	a certain budget to do it,
156.84	say 6.5 million dollars per month.
160.92	Well, what should you do?
160.92	What's the best way to handle it?
164.28	Should you buy rice, wheat, chickpea, oil?
167.76	How much?
169	It sounds simple. It's not.
171.16	You have 30 possible foods,
171.16	and you have to pick five of them.
174.4	That's already over 140,000
174.4	different combinations.
177.84	Then for each food that you pick,
179.56	you need to decide how much you'll buy,
181.56	where you're going to get it from,
183.28	where you're going to store it,
185.76	how long it's going to take to get there.
187.76	You need to look at all of the different
187.76	transportation routes as well.
191.12	And that's already
191.12	over 900 million options.
194.12	If you considered each option
194.12	for a single second,
196.52	that would take you
196.52	over 28 years to get through.
201.16	So we created a tool
201.16	that allowed decisionmakers
203.64	to weed through all 900 million options
206.28	in just a matter of days.
208.56	It turned out to be incredibly successful.
211.4	In an operation in Iraq,
212.68	we saved 17 percent of the costs,
215.24	and this meant that you had the ability
215.24	to feed an additional 80,000 people.
219.4	It's all thanks to the use of data
219.4	and modeling complex systems.
224.8	But we didn't do it alone.
226.84	The unit that I worked with in Rome,
226.84	they were unique.
229.6	They believed in collaboration.
231.36	They brought in the academic world.
233.08	They brought in companies.
235.2	And if we really want to make big changes
235.2	in big problems like world hunger,
238.84	we need everybody to the table.
242.04	We need the data people
242.04	from humanitarian organizations
245	leading the way,
246.28	and orchestrating
246.28	just the right types of engagements
248.88	with academics, with governments.
250.6	And there's one group that's not being
250.6	leveraged in the way that it should be.
254.32	Did you guess it? Companies.
256.44	Companies have a major role to play
256.44	in fixing the big problems in our world.
260.88	I've been in the private sector
260.88	for two years now.
263.32	I've seen what companies can do,
263.32	and I've seen what companies aren't doing,
266.92	and I think there's three main ways
266.92	that we can fill that gap:
270.32	by donating data,
270.32	by donating decision scientists
273.44	and by donating technology
273.44	to gather new sources of data.
277.92	This is data philanthropy,
279.52	and it's the future of corporate
279.52	social responsibility.
283.16	Bonus, it also makes good business sense.
286.92	Companies today,
286.92	they collect mountains of data,
290.16	so the first thing they can do
290.16	is start donating that data.
292.946	Some companies are already doing it.
295.16	Take, for example,
295.16	a major telecom company.
297.6	They opened up their data
297.6	in Senegal and the Ivory Coast
300.4	and researchers discovered
302.4	that if you look at the patterns
302.4	in the pings to the cell phone towers,
305.758	you can see where people are traveling.
307.72	And that can tell you things like
309.92	where malaria might spread,
309.92	and you can make predictions with it.
313.04	Or take for example
313.04	an innovative satellite company.
315.96	They opened up their data and donated it,
318	and with that data you could track
319.68	how droughts are impacting
319.68	food production.
322.92	With that you can actually trigger
322.92	aid funding before a crisis can happen.
327.56	This is a great start.
329.84	There's important insights
329.84	just locked away in company data.
334.48	And yes, you need to be very careful.
336.32	You need to respect privacy concerns,
336.32	for example by anonymizing the data.
339.92	But even if the floodgates opened up,
342.72	and even if all companies
342.72	donated their data
345.28	to academics, to NGOs,
345.28	to humanitarian organizations,
348.56	it wouldn't be enough
348.56	to harness that full impact of data
351.56	for humanitarian goals.
354.32	Why?
355.8	To unlock insights in data,
355.8	you need decision scientists.
359.76	Decision scientists are people like me.
362.36	They take the data, they clean it up,
364.2	transform it and put it
364.2	into a useful algorithm
366.48	that's the best choice
366.48	to address the business need at hand.
369.8	In the world of humanitarian aid,
369.8	there are very few decision scientists.
373.52	Most of them work for companies.
376.48	So that's the second thing
376.48	that companies need to do.
379	In addition to donating their data,
380.72	they need to donate
380.72	their decision scientists.
383.52	"Now, companies will say, ""Ah! Don't take"
383.52	our decision scientists from us.
389.28	"We need every spare second of their time."""
392.36	But there's a way.
395.2	If a company was going to donate
395.2	a block of a decision scientist's time,
398.64	it would actually make more sense
398.64	to spread out that block of time
401.8	over a long period,
401.8	say for example five years.
404.6	This might only amount
404.6	to a couple of hours per month,
407.68	which a company would hardly miss,
409.76	but what it enables is really important:
409.76	long-term partnerships.
414.92	Long-term partnerships
414.92	allow you to build relationships,
417.76	to get to know the data,
417.76	to really understand it
420.44	and to start to understand
420.44	the needs and challenges
422.88	that the humanitarian
422.88	organization is facing.
426.345	In Rome, at the World Food Programme,
426.345	this took us five years to do,
429.56	five years.
431.04	That first three years, OK,
431.04	that was just what we couldn't solve for.
434.4	Then there was two years after that
434.4	of refining and implementing the tool,
437.92	like in the operations in Iraq
437.92	and other countries.
441.52	I don't think that's
441.52	an unrealistic timeline
443.64	when it comes to using data
443.64	to make operational changes.
446.4	It's an investment. It requires patience.
449.76	But the types of results
449.76	that can be produced are undeniable.
453.28	In our case, it was the ability
453.28	to feed tens of thousands more people.
459.44	So we have donating data,
459.44	we have donating decision scientists,
463.8	and there's actually a third way
463.8	that companies can help:
466.52	donating technology
466.52	to capture new sources of data.
469.52	You see, there's a lot of things
469.52	we just don't have data on.
472.96	Right now, Syrian refugees
472.96	are flooding into Greece,
477.12	and the UN refugee agency,
477.12	they have their hands full.
481	The current system for tracking people
481	is paper and pencil,
484.08	and what that means is
485.36	that when a mother and her five children
485.36	walk into the camp,
488.24	headquarters is essentially
488.24	blind to this moment.
490.92	That's all going to change
490.92	in the next few weeks,
493.28	thanks to private sector collaboration.
495.84	There's going to be a new system based
495.84	on donated package tracking technology
499.52	from the logistics company
499.52	that I work for.
502.12	With this new system,
502.12	there will be a data trail,
504.48	so you know exactly the moment
505.96	when that mother and her children
505.96	walk into the camp.
508.48	And even more, you know
508.48	if she's going to have supplies
511.12	this month and the next.
512.4	Information visibility drives efficiency.
515.44	For companies, using technology
515.44	to gather important data,
518.72	it's like bread and butter.
520.2	They've been doing it for years,
521.8	and it's led to major
521.8	operational efficiency improvements.
525.08	Just try to imagine
525.08	your favorite beverage company
528.28	trying to plan their inventory
529.88	and not knowing how many bottles
529.88	were on the shelves.
532.4	It's absurd.
533.64	Data drives better decisions.
537.8	Now, if you're representing a company,
540.36	and you're pragmatic
540.36	and not just idealistic,
543.52	you might be saying to yourself,
543.52	"""OK, this is all great, Mallory,"
546.6	"but why should I want to be involved?"""
549	Well for one thing, beyond the good PR,
551.84	humanitarian aid
551.84	is a 24-billion-dollar sector,
554.64	and there's over five billion people,
554.64	maybe your next customers,
557.72	that live in the developing world.
559.56	Further, companies that are engaging
559.56	in data philanthropy,
562.68	they're finding new insights
562.68	locked away in their data.
565.68	Take, for example, a credit card company
567.96	that's opened up a center
569.32	that functions as a hub for academics,
569.32	for NGOs and governments,
572.72	all working together.
575.04	They're looking at information
575.04	in credit card swipes
577.8	and using that to find insights
577.8	about how households in India
580.8	live, work, earn and spend.
583.68	For the humanitarian world,
583.68	this provides information
586.28	about how you might
586.28	bring people out of poverty.
588.96	But for companies, it's providing
588.96	insights about your customers
592	and potential customers in India.
594.76	It's a win all around.
597.96	Now, for me, what I find
597.96	exciting about data philanthropy --
601.76	donating data, donating decision
601.76	scientists and donating technology --
606.12	it's what it means
606.12	for young professionals like me
608.52	who are choosing to work at companies.
610.8	Studies show that
610.8	the next generation of the workforce
613.48	care about having their work
613.48	make a bigger impact.
616.92	We want to make a difference,
619.4	and so through data philanthropy,
621.84	companies can actually help engage
621.84	and retain their decision scientists.
625.8	And that's a big deal for a profession
625.8	that's in high demand.
629.84	Data philanthropy
629.84	makes good business sense,
634.2	and it also can help
634.2	revolutionize the humanitarian world.
639.6	If we coordinated
639.6	the planning and logistics
641.72	across all of the major facets
641.72	of a humanitarian operation,
645.12	we could feed, clothe and shelter
645.12	hundreds of thousands more people,
649.44	and companies need to step up
649.44	and play the role that I know they can
653.72	in bringing about this revolution.
656.72	You've probably heard of the saying
656.72	"""food for thought."""
659.68	Well, this is literally thought for food.
663.56	It finally is the right idea
663.56	at the right time.
667.72	(Laughter)
668.96	Très magnifique.
670.56	Thank you.
671.8	(Applause)
