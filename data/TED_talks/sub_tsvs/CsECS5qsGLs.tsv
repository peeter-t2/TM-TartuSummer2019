13.134	This is a painting from the 16th century
13.134	from Lucas Cranach the Elder.
18.16	It shows the famous Fountain of Youth.
21.308	If you drink its water or you bathe in it,
21.308	you will get health and youth.
27.857	Every culture, every civilization
27.857	has dreamed of finding eternal youth.
34.044	There are people like Alexander the Great
34.044	or Ponce De Le√≥n, the explorer,
38.82	who spent much of their life
38.82	chasing the Fountain of Youth.
42.726	They didn't find it.
45.45	But what if there was something to it?
48.074	What if there was something
48.074	to this Fountain of Youth?
51.284	I will share an absolutely amazing
51.284	development in aging research
56.486	that could revolutionize
56.486	the way we think about aging
60.12	and how we may treat age-related
60.12	diseases in the future.
64.145	It started with experiments that showed,
66.678	in a recent number
66.678	of studies about growing,
69.996	that animals -- old mice --
69.996	that share a blood supply with young mice
76.021	can get rejuvenated.
78.148	This is similar to what you might see
78.148	in humans, in Siamese twins,
82.781	and I know this sounds a bit creepy.
85.338	But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
85.338	researcher, reported in 2007,
91.309	was that old muscle from a mouse
91.309	can be rejuvenated
94.833	if it's exposed to young blood
94.833	through common circulation.
99.903	This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
99.903	at Harvard a few years later,
104.57	and others then showed that similar
104.57	rejuvenating effects could be observed
109.189	in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.
112.974	But what I'm most excited about,
112.974	and several other labs as well,
117.095	is that this may even apply to the brain.
120.715	So, what we found is that an old mouse
120.715	exposed to a young environment
126.07	in this model called parabiosis,
129.107	shows a younger brain --
130.923	and a brain that functions better.
133.966	And I repeat:
135.58	an old mouse that gets young blood
135.58	through shared circulation
141.817	looks younger and functions
141.817	younger in its brain.
145.998	So when we get older --
147.554	we can look at different aspects
147.554	of human cognition,
150.25	and you can see on this slide here,
152.027	we can look at reasoning,
152.027	verbal ability and so forth.
155.899	And up to around age 50 or 60,
155.899	these functions are all intact,
161.202	and as I look at the young audience
161.202	here in the room, we're all still fine.
165.708	(Laughter)
166.74	But it's scary to see
166.74	how all these curves go south.
170.571	And as we get older,
172.184	diseases such as Alzheimer's
172.184	and others may develop.
177.004	We know that with age,
177.004	the connections between neurons --
180.599	the way neurons talk to each other,
180.599	the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;
185.274	neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,
188.604	and there's an increased susceptibility
188.604	for these neurodegenerative diseases.
193.573	One big problem we have -- to try
193.573	to understand how this really works
198.506	at a very molecular mechanistic level --
201.126	is that we can't study the brains
201.126	in detail, in living people.
206.033	We can do cognitive tests,
206.033	we can do imaging --
209.043	all kinds of sophisticated testing.
211.763	But we usually have to wait
211.763	until the person dies
215.405	to get the brain and look at how it really
215.405	changed through age or in a disease.
220.888	This is what neuropathologists
220.888	do, for example.
224.333	So, how about we think of the brain
224.333	as being part of the larger organism.
230.024	Could we potentially understand more
232.525	about what happens in the brain
232.525	at the molecular level
235.478	if we see the brain
235.478	as part of the entire body?
239.088	So if the body ages or gets sick,
239.088	does that affect the brain?
243.989	And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
243.989	does that influence the rest of the body?
249.05	And what connects all the different
249.05	tissues in the body
252.565	is blood.
254.366	Blood is the tissue that not only carries
254.366	cells that transport oxygen, for example,
260.215	the red blood cells,
261.48	or fights infectious diseases,
263.704	but it also carries messenger molecules,
267.999	hormone-like factors
267.999	that transport information
271.935	from one cell to another,
271.935	from one tissue to another,
276.092	including the brain.
277.573	So if we look at how the blood
277.573	changes in disease or age,
282.735	can we learn something about the brain?
285.651	We know that as we get older,
285.651	the blood changes as well,
290.511	so these hormone-like factors
290.511	change as we get older.
293.494	And by and large,
293.494	factors that we know are required
297.717	for the development of tissues,
297.717	for the maintenance of tissues --
301.162	they start to decrease as we get older,
304.063	while factors involved in repair,
304.063	in injury and in inflammation --
308.79	they increase as we get older.
310.764	So there's this unbalance of good
310.764	and bad factors, if you will.
316.988	And to illustrate what we can do
316.988	potentially with that,
320.005	I want to talk you through
320.005	an experiment that we did.
322.681	We had almost 300 blood samples
322.681	from healthy human beings
328.895	and we measured over 100
328.895	of these communication factors,
332.814	these hormone-like proteins that
332.814	transport information between tissues.
337.266	And what we noticed first
338.966	is that between the youngest
338.966	and the oldest group,
341.807	about half the factors
341.807	changed significantly.
345.128	So our body lives in a very
345.128	different environment as we get older,
348.287	when it comes to these factors.
350.062	And using statistical
350.062	or bioinformatics programs,
353.582	we could try to discover
353.582	those factors that best predict age --
358.3	in a way, back-calculate
358.3	the relative age of a person.
362.337	And the way this looks
362.337	is shown in this graph.
365.618	So, on the one axis you see
365.618	the actual age a person lived,
371.011	the chronological age.
372.34	So, how many years they lived.
374.086	And then we take these top factors
374.086	that I showed you,
376.818	and we calculate their relative age,
376.818	their biological age.
382.708	And what you see is that
382.708	there is a pretty good correlation,
386.366	so we can pretty well predict
386.366	the relative age of a person.
389.705	But what's really exciting
389.705	are the outliers,
393.644	as they so often are in life.
395.922	You can see here, the person
395.922	I highlighted with the green dot
400.514	is about 70 years of age
403.134	but seems to have a biological age,
403.134	if what we're doing here is really true,
408.164	of only about 45.
410.231	So is this a person that actually
410.231	looks much younger than their age?
414.183	But more importantly: Is this a person
414.183	who is maybe at a reduced risk
418.723	to develop an age-related disease
418.723	and will have a long life --
422.071	will live to 100 or more?
424.402	On the other hand, the person here,
424.402	highlighted with the red dot,
428.987	is not even 40,
428.987	but has a biological age of 65.
433.917	Is this a person at an increased risk
433.917	of developing an age-related disease?
438.339	So in our lab, we're trying
438.339	to understand these factors better,
442.019	and many other groups
442.019	are trying to understand,
444.281	what are the true aging factors,
446.381	and can we learn something about them
446.381	to possibly predict age-related diseases?
452.281	So what I've shown you so far
452.281	is simply correlational, right?
456.367	You can just say,
456.367	"""Well, these factors change with age,"""
460.422	but you don't really know
460.422	if they do something about aging.
465.031	So what I'm going to show you now
465.031	is very remarkable
468.103	and it suggests that these factors
468.103	can actually modulate the age of a tissue.
473.845	And that's where we come back
473.845	to this model called parabiosis.
477.167	So, parabiosis is done in mice
479.731	by surgically connecting
479.731	the two mice together,
484.667	and that leads then
484.667	to a shared blood system,
487.024	where we can now ask,
487.024	"""How does the old brain get influenced"
491.835	"by exposure to the young blood?"""
494.144	And for this purpose, we use young mice
496.372	that are an equivalency
496.372	of 20-year-old people,
499.849	and old mice that are roughly
504.958	What we found is quite remarkable.
507.808	We find there are more neural stem cells
507.808	that make new neurons
511.552	in these old brains.
513.351	There's an increased
513.351	activity of the synapses,
515.957	the connections between neurons.
518.02	There are more genes expressed
518.02	that are known to be involved
521.329	in the formation of new memories.
523.659	And there's less of this bad inflammation.
527.427	But we observed that there are no cells
527.427	entering the brains of these animals.
533.947	So when we connect them,
535.357	there are actually no cells
535.357	going into the old brain, in this model.
541.379	Instead, we've reasoned, then,
541.379	that it must be the soluble factors,
545.064	so we could collect simply the soluble
545.064	fraction of blood which is called plasma,
549.871	and inject either young plasma
549.871	or old plasma into these mice,
553.839	and we could reproduce
553.839	these rejuvenating effects,
556.231	but what we could also do now
557.969	is we could do memory tests with mice.
560.443	As mice get older, like us humans,
560.443	they have memory problems.
564.818	It's just harder to detect them,
566.435	but I'll show you in a minute
566.435	how we do that.
568.803	But we wanted to take this
568.803	one step further,
571.522	one step closer to potentially
571.522	being relevant to humans.
575.586	What I'm showing you now
575.586	are unpublished studies,
578.807	where we used human plasma,
578.807	young human plasma,
583.364	and as a control, saline,
585.237	and injected it into old mice,
587.137	and asked, can we again
587.137	rejuvenate these old mice?
592.013	Can we make them smarter?
594.104	And to do this, we used a test.
594.104	It's called a Barnes maze.
597.417	This is a big table
597.417	that has lots of holes in it,
600.596	and there are guide marks around it,
604.103	and there's a bright light,
604.103	as on this stage here.
606.733	The mice hate this and they try to escape,
609.89	and find the single hole that you see
609.89	pointed at with an arrow,
614.17	where a tube is mounted underneath
616.139	where they can escape
616.139	and feel comfortable in a dark hole.
619.977	So we teach them, over several days,
621.803	to find this space
621.803	on these cues in the space,
624.73	and you can compare this for humans,
627.548	to finding your car in a parking lot
627.548	after a busy day of shopping.
631.802	(Laughter)
632.827	Many of us have probably had
632.827	some problems with that.
636.602	So, let's look at an old mouse here.
638.954	This is an old mouse
638.954	that has memory problems,
641.154	as you'll notice in a moment.
643.305	It just looks into every hole,
643.305	but it didn't form this spacial map
648.053	that would remind it where it was
648.053	in the previous trial or the last day.
653.873	In stark contrast, this mouse here
653.873	is a sibling of the same age,
659.364	but it was treated with young
659.364	human plasma for three weeks,
664.807	with small injections every three days.
667.741	And as you noticed, it almost
667.741	"looks around, ""Where am I?"" --"
671.988	and then walks straight
671.988	to that hole and escapes.
674.919	So, it could remember where that hole was.
678.742	So by all means, this old mouse
678.742	seems to be rejuvenated --
682.454	it functions more like a younger mouse.
684.857	And it also suggests
684.857	that there is something
687.587	not only in young mouse plasma,
687.587	but in young human plasma
692.602	that has the capacity
692.602	to help this old brain.
696.834	So to summarize,
698.01	we find the old mouse, and its brain
698.01	in particular, are malleable.
702.233	They're not set in stone;
702.233	we can actually change them.
705.708	It can be rejuvenated.
707.68	Young blood factors can reverse aging,
710.301	and what I didn't show you --
712.037	in this model, the young mouse actually
712.037	suffers from exposure to the old.
717.283	So there are old-blood factors
717.283	that can accelerate aging.
721.725	And most importantly,
721.725	humans may have similar factors,
726.066	because we can take young human
726.066	blood and have a similar effect.
730.592	Old human blood, I didn't show you,
730.592	does not have this effect;
734.172	it does not make the mice younger.
737.071	So, is this magic transferable to humans?
740.723	We're running a small
740.723	clinical study at Stanford,
744.376	where we treat Alzheimer's patients
744.376	with mild disease
748.276	with a pint of plasma
748.276	from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,
754.91	and do this once a week for four weeks,
757.529	and then we look
757.529	at their brains with imaging.
761.05	We test them cognitively,
762.918	and we ask their caregivers
762.918	for daily activities of living.
766.948	What we hope is that there are
766.948	some signs of improvement
770.891	from this treatment.
772.758	And if that's the case,
772.758	that could give us hope
775.338	that what I showed you works in mice
777.782	might also work in humans.
780.478	Now, I don't think we will live forever.
783.955	But maybe we discovered
786.316	that the Fountain of Youth
786.316	is actually within us,
789.427	and it has just dried out.
791.574	And if we can turn it
791.574	back on a little bit,
794.426	maybe we can find the factors
794.426	that are mediating these effects,
799.077	we can produce these factors synthetically
801.688	and we can treat diseases of aging,
801.688	such as Alzheimer's disease
805.725	or other dementias.
807.282	Thank you very much.
808.457	(Applause)
