15.83	Photography has been my passion
17.316	ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera,
20.094	but today I want to share with you
22.454	the 15 most treasured photos of mine,
25.736	and I didn't take any of them.
27.331	There were no art directors, no stylists,
30.222	no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.
34.658	In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.
38.934	My story begins
40.446	when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement,
42.964	and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter
45.727	on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.
50.163	We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later,
53.704	so we decided to take the same picture.
57.103	Well you can see where this is going.
59.352	Approaching my daughter's third birthday,
61.086	"my wife said, ""Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York"
63.528	"and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?"""
67.659	This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.
70.686	You know, it's remarkable how universal
74.003	the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.
77.119	No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.
82.021	Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.
85.685	It's really become sacred to us.
87.686	This one was taken just weeks after 9/11,
90.317	and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day
94.532	in ways a five-year-old could understand.
97.292	So these photos are far more than proxies
99.899	for a single moment, or even a specific trip.
103.04	They're also ways for us to freeze time
106.203	for one week in October
110.119	and reflect on our times
112.467	and how we change from year to year,
114.619	and not just physically, but in every way.
117.74	Because while we take the same photo,
120.107	our perspectives change,
122.315	and she reaches new milestones,
125.668	and I get to see life through her eyes,
128.147	and how she interacts with and sees everything.
132.872	This very focused time we get to spend together
135.635	is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.
141.122	Recently, on one trip, we were walking,
144.183	and she stops dead in her tracks,
146.355	and she points to a red awning of the doll store
149.826	that she loved when she was little
152.25	on our earlier trips.
154.522	And she describes to me the feeling she felt
157.154	as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.
160.538	She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest
163.567	when she saw that place for the very first time
166.228	nine years earlier.
168.9	And now what she's looking at in New York
171.028	are colleges,
172.952	because she's determined to go to school in New York.
176.252	And it hit me: One of the most important things
179.133	we all make are memories.
183.142	So I want to share the idea of taking an active role
186.366	in consciously creating memories.
190.299	I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots,
193.078	I'm not in many of the family photos.
194.732	I'm always the one taking the picture.
197.231	So I want to encourage everyone today
199.686	to get in the shot,
201.785	and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask,
204.564	"""Will you take our picture?"""
206.606	Thank you. (Applause)
