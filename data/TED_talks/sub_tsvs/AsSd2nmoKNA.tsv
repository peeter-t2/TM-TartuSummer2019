15.26	This room may appear
17.26	to be holding 600 people,
19.26	but there's actually so many more,
21.26	because in each one of us
23.26	there is a multitude of personalities.
26.26	I have two primary personalities
29.26	that have been in conflict and conversation within me
31.26	since I was a little girl.
33.26	"I call them ""the mystic"""
35.26	"and ""the warrior."""
37.26	I was born into a family
39.26	of politically active,
41.26	intellectual atheists.
43.26	There was this equation in my family that went something like this:
46.26	if you are intelligent,
48.26	you therefore are not spiritual.
51.26	I was the freak of the family.
53.26	I was this weird little kid
55.26	who wanted to have deep talks
57.26	about the worlds that might exist
60.26	beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.
63.26	I wanted to know
65.26	if what we human beings see
67.26	and hear and think
70.26	is a full and accurate picture
72.26	of reality.
74.26	So, looking for answers,
76.26	I went to Catholic mass.
78.26	I tagged along with my neighbors.
80.26	I read Sartre and Socrates.
82.26	And then a wonderful thing happened
84.26	when I was in high school:
86.26	Gurus from the East
88.26	started washing up on the shores of America.
91.26	And I said to myself,
93.26	"""I wanna get me one of them."""
95.26	And ever since,
97.26	I've been walking the mystic path,
100.26	trying to peer beyond
102.26	what Albert Einstein called
104.26	"""the optical delusion"
106.26	"of everyday consciousness."""
109.26	So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.
112.26	Take a breath right now
114.26	of this clear air in this room.
118.26	Now, see this strange,
121.26	underwater,
124.26	coral reef-looking thing?
126.26	It's actually a person's trachea,
129.26	and those colored globs
131.26	are microbes
133.26	that are actually swimming around in this room
135.26	right now, all around us.
138.26	If we're blind to this simple biology,
141.26	imagine what we're missing
144.26	at the smallest subatomic level right now
147.26	and at the grandest cosmic levels.
150.26	My years as a mystic
153.26	have made me question
155.26	almost all my assumptions.
157.26	They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all.
161.26	Now when the mystic part of me
163.26	jabbers on and on like this,
165.26	the warrior rolls her eyes.
168.26	She's concerned
171.26	about what's happening in this world right now.
175.26	She's worried.
177.26	"She says, ""Excuse me, I'm pissed off,"
180.26	and I know a few things,
182.26	"and we better get busy about them right now."""
184.26	I've spent my life as a warrior,
186.26	working for women's issues,
188.26	working on political campaigns,
191.26	being an activist for the environment.
194.26	And it can be sort of crazy-making,
197.26	housing both the mystic and the warrior
199.26	in one body.
201.26	I've always been attracted
204.26	to those rare people
206.26	who pull that off,
208.26	who devote their lives to humanity
210.26	with the grit of the warrior
212.26	and the grace of the mystic --
215.26	people like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
218.26	"who wrote, ""I can never be"
220.26	what I ought to be
222.26	until you are
224.26	what you ought to be.
226.26	"This,"" he wrote, ""is the interrelated structure"
229.26	"of reality."""
231.26	Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior,
234.26	"who said, ""The problem with the world"
237.26	is that we draw the circle of our family
240.26	"too small."""
242.26	And Nelson Mandela,
244.26	who lives by the African concept
246.26	"of ""ubuntu,"""
248.26	"which means ""I need you"
250.26	in order to be me,
252.26	"and you need me in order to be you."""
255.26	Now we all love to trot out
257.26	these three mystic warriors
259.26	as if they were born
261.26	with the saint gene.
263.26	But we all actually have
265.26	the same capacity that they do,
268.26	and we need to do
270.26	their work now.
272.26	I'm deeply disturbed
274.26	by the ways in which all of our cultures
277.26	"are demonizing ""the Other"""
280.26	by the voice we're giving
282.26	to the most divisive among us.
285.26	Listen to these titles
287.26	of some of the bestselling books
289.26	from both sides of the political divide
291.26	here in the U.S.
293.26	"""Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,"""
296.26	"""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,"""
299.26	"""Pinheads and Patriots,"""
302.26	"""Arguing With Idiots."""
304.26	They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,
306.26	but they're actually dangerous.
309.26	Now here's a title that may sound familiar,
311.26	but whose author may surprise you:
314.26	"""Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle"
316.26	Against Lies, Stupidity
318.26	"and Cowardice."""
320.26	Who wrote that?
322.26	That was Adolf Hitler's first title
324.26	"for ""Mein Kampf"" -- ""My Struggle"" --"
327.26	the book that launched the Nazi party.
330.26	The worst eras in human history,
332.26	whether in Cambodia or Germany
334.26	or Rwanda,
336.26	they start like this, with negative other-izing.
339.26	And then they morph
341.26	into violent extremism.
344.26	This is why I'm launching a new initiative.
347.26	And it's to help all of us,
350.26	myself included,
352.26	to counteract the tendency
354.26	"to ""otherize."""
356.26	And I realize we're all busy people,
359.26	so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.
362.26	I'm calling my initiative,
364.26	"""Take the Other to Lunch."""
367.26	If you are
369.26	a Republican,
371.26	you can take a Democrat to lunch,
374.26	or if you're a Democrat,
377.26	think of it
379.26	as taking a Republican to lunch.
381.26	Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch
384.26	makes you lose your appetite,
387.26	I suggest you start more local,
390.26	because there is no shortage of the Other
393.26	right in your own neighborhood.
396.26	Maybe that person
398.26	who worships at the mosque,
400.26	or the church or the synagogue, down the street.
403.26	Or someone from the other side
405.26	of the abortion conflict.
408.26	Or maybe your brother-in-law
410.26	who doesn't believe in global warming.
413.26	Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you,
418.26	or whose point of view
420.26	makes smoke come out of your ears.
424.26	A couple of weeks ago,
426.26	I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.
431.26	Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.
435.26	She's an activist from the Right,
437.26	and I'm an activist from the Left.
441.26	And we used some guidelines
443.26	to keep our conversation elevated,
445.26	and you can use them too,
447.26	because I know you're all going
449.26	to take an Other to lunch.
451.26	So first of all, decide on a goal:
454.26	to get to know one person
456.26	from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.
461.26	And then, before you get together,
463.26	agree on some ground rules.
465.26	My Tea Party lunchmate and I
468.26	came up with these:
470.26	don't persuade, defend
472.26	or interrupt.
474.26	Be curious;
476.26	be conversational; be real.
478.26	And listen.
480.26	From there, we dove in.
482.26	And we used these questions:
484.26	Share some of your life experiences with me.
487.26	What issues
489.26	deeply concern you?
491.26	And what have you always wanted to ask
493.26	someone from the other side?
496.26	My lunch partner and I
498.26	came away with some really important insights,
500.26	and I'm going to share just one with you.
503.26	I think it has relevance
505.26	to any problem
507.26	between people anywhere.
509.26	I asked her why her side
512.26	makes such outrageous allegations
514.26	and lies about my side.
517.26	"""What?"" she wanted to know."
519.26	"""Like we're a bunch"
521.26	of elitist,
523.26	"morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers."""
525.26	Well, she was shocked.
527.26	She thought my side
529.26	beat up on her side way more often,
532.26	that we called them brainless,
534.26	gun-toting racists,
537.26	and we both marveled
539.26	at the labels that fit
541.26	none of the people
543.26	we actually know.
545.26	And since we had established some trust,
547.26	we believed in each other's sincerity.
551.26	We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities
554.26	when we witnessed
556.26	"the kind of ""otherizing"" talk"
558.26	that can wound
560.26	and fester into paranoia
562.26	and then be used by those on the fringes
565.26	to incite.
567.26	By the end of our lunch,
569.26	we acknowledged each other's openness.
571.26	Neither of us had tried to change the other.
574.26	But we also hadn't pretended
577.26	that our differences were just going to melt away
580.26	after a lunch.
585.26	Instead, we had taken
587.26	first steps together,
589.26	past our knee-jerk reactions,
591.26	to the ubuntu place,
593.26	which is the only place
595.26	where solutions
597.26	to our most intractable-seeming problems
601.26	will be found.
603.26	Who should you invite to lunch?
606.26	Next time you catch yourself
608.26	in the act of otherizing,
610.26	that will be your clue.
612.26	And what might happen at your lunch?
615.26	Will the heavens open
617.26	"and ""We Are the World"" play over the restaurant sound system?"
620.26	Probably not.
622.26	Because ubuntu work is slow,
624.26	and it's difficult.
626.26	It's two people
628.26	dropping the pretense
630.26	of being know-it-alls.
632.26	It's two people,
634.26	two warriors,
636.26	dropping their weapons
638.26	and reaching toward each other.
641.26	Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:
645.26	"""Out beyond ideas"
648.26	of wrong-doing and right-doing,
651.26	there is a field.
653.26	"I'll meet you there."""
655.26	(Applause)
