277.922	(Music ends)
281.174	(Applause)
299.23	Thank you!
300.476	(Applause continues)
305.203	Thank you very much.
307.616	Like the speaker before me --
307.616	I am a TED virgin, I guess.
312.322	I'm also the first time here, and ...
315.278	(Laughter)
316.423	I don't know what to say!
317.708	(Applause)
321.165	I'm really happy
321.165	that Mr. Anderson invited me.
324	I'm really grateful that I get a chance
324	to play for everyone.
327.523	And the song that I just played
327.523	was by Josef Hofmann.
330.818	"It's called ""Kaleidoscope."""
332.691	And Hofmann is a Polish pianist
332.691	and composer of the late 19th century,
339.378	and he's widely considered
339.378	one of the greatest pianists of all time.
343.173	I have another piece
343.173	that I'd like to play for you.
345.729	"It's called ""Abegg Variations,"""
345.729	by Robert Schumann,
349.796	a German 19th-century composer.
353.994	"The name ""Abegg"" is actually A-B-E-G-G,"
358.169	and that's the main theme in the melody.
360.136	(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)
364.007	That comes from the last name
364.007	of one of Schumann's female friends.
368.673	(Laughter)
370.47	But he wrote that for his wife.
372.597	(Laughter)
376.715	So actually, if you listen carefully,
378.565	there are supposed to be
378.565	five variations on this Abegg theme.
381.986	It's written around 1834,
384.614	so even though it's old,
384.614	I hope you'll like it.
390.583	(Music)
799.987	(Music ends)
803.312	(Applause)
810.748	Now comes the part that I hate.
815.591	Well, because Mr. Anderson told me
818.071	that this session is called
818.071	"""Sync and Flow,"""
820.972	"I was wondering, ""What do I know"
820.972	"that these geniuses don't?"""
823.993	(Laughter)
825.184	So, I'll talk about musical composition,
827.333	even though I don't know where to start.
830.679	How do I compose?
832.544	I think Yamaha does a really good job
832.544	of teaching us how to compose.
836.452	What I do first is, I make a lot
836.452	of little musical ideas
840.163	you can just improvise
840.163	here at the piano --
842.378	and I choose one of those
842.378	to become my main theme, my main melody,
846.119	like the Abegg that you just heard.
848.3	And once I choose my main theme,
848.3	I have to decide:
851.826	Out of all the styles in music,
851.826	what kind of style do I want?
855.628	And this year,
855.628	I composed a Romantic style.
858.568	So for inspiration,
858.568	I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky
862.469	and all the great Romantic composers.
864.96	Next, I make the structure
864.96	of the entire piece with my teachers.
870.443	They help me plan out the whole piece.
872.412	And then the hard part
872.412	is filling it in with musical ideas,
876.138	because then you have to think.
878.136	(Laughter)
879.933	And then, when the piece
879.933	takes somewhat of a solified form --
883.436	solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,
885.682	you're supposed to actually
885.682	polish the piece, polish the details,
890.732	and then polish the overall
890.732	performance of the composition.
894.843	And another thing
894.843	that I enjoy doing is drawing.
897.912	Drawing, because I like to draw,
897.912	you know, Japanese anime art.
901.42	I think that's a craze
901.42	among teens right now.
904.385	And once I realized it,
906.061	there's a parallel between creating
906.061	music and creating art,
910.081	because for your motive, or your
910.081	little initial idea for your drawing,
915.215	it's your character -- you want
915.215	to decide who you want to draw,
918.207	or if you want to draw
918.207	an original character.
920.387	And then you want to decide:
920.387	How are you going to draw the character?
923.908	Like, am I going to use one page?
923.908	Am I going to draw it on the computer?
927.344	Am I going to use a two-page spread
927.344	like a comic book?
930.544	For a more grandiose effect, I guess.
933.131	And then you have to do
933.131	the initial sketch of the character,
936.302	which is like your structure of a piece,
938.364	and then you add pen and pencil,
938.364	and whatever details that you need --
942.148	that's polishing the drawing.
944.025	And another thing that both of these
944.025	have in common is your state of mind,
947.771	because I know I'm one of those teenagers
947.771	that are really easily distracted.
952.781	So if I'm trying to do homework
952.781	and I don't feel like it,
957.82	I'll try to draw or,
957.82	you know, waste my time.
960.999	And then what happens is,
960.999	sometimes I absolutely can't draw
963.801	or I can't compose at all,
965.786	and then it's like
965.786	there's too much on your mind.
968.116	You can't focus
968.116	on what you're supposed to do.
970.517	And sometimes, if you manage to use
970.517	your time wisely and work on it,
975.842	you'll get something out of it,
975.842	but it doesn't come naturally.
979.486	What happens is,
979.486	if something magical happens,
981.994	if something natural happens to you,
984.622	you're able to produce
984.622	all this beautiful stuff instantly,
988.265	"and then that's what I consider ""flow,"""
990.417	because that's when everything clicks
990.417	and you're able to do anything.
994.409	You feel like you're on top of your game
994.409	and you can do anything you want.
998.194	I'm not going to play
998.194	my own composition today because,
1001.439	although I did finish it,
1001.439	it's way too long.
1005.05	Instead, I'd like to try something
1005.05	"called ""improvisation."""
1008.262	I have here seven note cards,
1010.507	one with each note
1010.507	of the musical alphabet.
1013.714	And I'd like someone to come up here
1013.714	and choose five --
1017.621	anyone to come up here and choose five --
1019.633	and then I can make it
1019.633	into some sort of melody,
1022.369	and I'll improvise it.
1024.711	Wow. A volunteer, yay!
1027.866	(Laughter)
1029.364	(Applause)
1032.514	Jennifer Lin: Nice to meet you.
1034.633	Goldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?
1037.644	JL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.
1039.73	GH: OK, one.
1039.73	JL: OK.
1042.185	GH: Two.
1042.185	JL: Yes.
1045.025	GH: Three.
1048.009	GH: Oh, D and F -- too familiar.
1050.532	(Laughter)
1055.165	JL: One more.
1055.165	"GH: OK. ""E"" for ""effort."""
1058.525	JL: Would you mind reading them out
1058.525	in the order that you chose them?
1061.82	GH: OK -- C, G, B, A and E.
1068.135	JL: Thank you very much!
1069.313	GH: You're welcome. And what about these?
1071.313	JL: I won't use them. Thank you!
1075.204	(Applause)
1082.152	Now, she chose C, G, B, A, E.
1085.554	I'm going to try to put that
1085.554	in some sort of order.
1087.998	(Plays notes)
1093.606	OK, that's nice.
1096.036	So, I'm going to have a moment to think,
1097.997	and I'll try to make something out of it.
1105.134	(Plays the five notes)
1116.044	(Music)
1312.201	(Music ends)
1314.226	(Applause)
1321.028	The next song, or the encore
1321.028	that I'm going to play
1323.616	"is called ""Bumble Boogie,"" by Jack Fina."
1327.979	(Applause)
1332.689	(Music)
1444.521	(Music ends)
