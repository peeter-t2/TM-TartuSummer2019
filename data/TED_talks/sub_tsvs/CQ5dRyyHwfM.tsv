12.567	Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet
14.844	a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with
17.087	in the wild for the last 28 years.
20.554	Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains
23.749	and what they might be doing with all that brainpower
25.863	in the wild.
27.338	And we know they use some of that brainpower
29.61	for just living complicated lives,
31.774	but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
34.634	Well, we know a few things.
36.338	We know that their brain-to-body ratio,
38.527	which is a physical measure of intelligence,
40.497	is second only to humans.
42.993	Cognitively, they can understand
44.551	artificially-created languages.
46.98	And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.
50.121	And in some parts of the world, they use tools,
52.225	like sponges to hunt fish.
54.54	But there's one big question left:
57.191	do they have a language, and if so,
59.058	what are they talking about?
61.462	So decades ago, not years ago,
64.905	I set out to find a place in the world
67.068	where I could observe dolphins underwater
68.866	to try to crack the code of their communication system.
72.109	Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,
74.723	so it's very hard to observe animals underwater,
77.962	but I found a community of dolphins that live
79.721	in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas
82.747	which are just east of Florida.
84.989	And they spend their daytime resting and socializing
87.4	in the safety of the shallows, but at night,
89.27	they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.
93.069	Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
96.893	So we go out for about five months every summer
99.069	in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work
103.271	at sea for weeks at a time.
105.349	My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,
107.989	which is an underwater microphone, and this is so
109.939	I can correlate sound and behavior.
112.033	And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.
113.679	We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,
116.501	since we're actually observing them physically in the water.
119.629	Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species
122.769	to work with for a couple of reasons.
124.733	They're born without spots, and they get spots with age,
127.664	and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,
130.698	so that's fun to track their behavior.
132.64	And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.
136.093	Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.
138.516	She's 35 years old in this shot,
140.501	but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.
143.691	And like all the dolphins in our community,
146.994	we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots
149.765	and nicks in her dorsal fin,
151.507	and also the unique spot patterns
153.71	as she matured over time.
156.053	Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,
158.712	and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,
161.787	and at about the age of nine, the females
164.14	become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,
166.81	and the males mature quite a bit later,
168.781	at around 15 years of age.
170.896	And dolphins are very promiscuous,
172.636	and so we have to determine who the fathers are,
175.498	so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material
177.952	out of the water and extracting DNA.
180.816	So what that means is, after 28 years,
183.28	we are tracking three generations,
185.688	including grandmothers and grandfathers.
188.032	Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.
190.648	They make sounds 10 times as high
192.932	and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.
195.12	But they have other communication signals they use.
197.715	They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.
201.056	They have taste, not smell.
203.256	And they have touch.
205.296	And sound can actually be felt in the water,
207.492	because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
210.523	So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.
214.153	Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used
216.693	with certain behaviors.
218.102	Now, the signature whistle is a whistle
220.201	that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)
224.9	And this is the best-studied sound,
227.076	because it's easy to measure, really,
228.705	and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves
230.662	are reuniting, for example.
232.799	Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.
235.857	This is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)
239.103	And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.
242.42	But they can also tightly pack these clicks together
244.808	into buzzes and use them socially.
246.943	For example, males will stimulate a female
248.921	during a courtship chase.
251.425	You know, I've been buzzed in the water.
253.752	(Laughter)
255.684	Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.
258.065	And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.
260.361	(Laughter)
264.093	So dolphins are also political animals,
266.618	so they have to resolve conflicts.
268.929	(Dolphin noises)
270.572	And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as
272.945	their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.
275.353	And these are very unstudied sounds
277.425	because they're hard to measure.
279.563	Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.
282.282	(Dolphin noises)
284.303	So you're going to see two groups,
286.393	and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,
288.601	some open mouths,
291.945	lots of squawking.
294.101	There's a bubble.
297.686	And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off
300.269	and everything will resolve fine,
301.923	and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.
305.583	Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose
307.887	that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
310.831	For example, they babysit each other's calves.
313.542	The males have dominance displays that they use
315.719	when they're chasing each other's females.
318.119	And the two species actually form temporary alliances
320.541	when they're chasing sharks away.
322.919	And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate
325.83	their coordination is synchrony.
327.83	They synchronize their sounds and their body postures
330.941	to look bigger and sound stronger.
333.075	(Dolphins noises)
334.551	Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,
337.143	and you'll see them starting to synchronize
338.914	their behavior and their sounds.
340.815	(Dolphin noises)
345.183	You see, they're synchronizing with their partner
347.429	as well as the other dyad.
351.401	I wish I was that coordinated.
356.731	Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing
359.805	the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,
361.7	and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,
363.863	and we use special equipment in the water
365.421	to collect these sounds.
367.158	Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity
369.723	using information theory,
371.786	and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
375.677	But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.
379.529	Now, these are three spectragrams.
382.616	Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.
385.291	So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.
391.15	Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look
393.743	a bit like human phonemes.
396.247	Now, one way to crack the code
397.513	is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,
400.058	but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.
404.056	But a second way to crack the code
406.178	is to develop some technology,
408.143	an interface to do two-way communication,
410.323	and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas
412.687	and in real time.
415.127	Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces
417.783	to try to bridge the gap with species
419.847	including chimpanzees and dolphins.
421.935	This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,
424.96	at the Epcot Center, was actually
426.702	the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed
429.519	for humans and dolphins to work together under the water
432.383	and exchange information.
434.31	So we wanted to develop an interface like this
436.93	in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
439.3	And one of the reasons we thought we could do this
441.467	is because the dolphins were starting to show us
443.489	a lot of mutual curiosity.
445.093	They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations
448.004	and our postures, and they were also inviting us
450.324	into dolphin games.
452.957	Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,
455.604	and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,
458.924	or sargassum in this case, around.
462.036	And they're very adept. They like to drag it
464.172	and drop it from appendage to appendage.
468.492	Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.
471.188	She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,
475.06	and he's just learning how to play this game.
477.744	(Dolphin noises)
479.47	She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.
483.94	He really wants that sargassum.
488.369	Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,
491.28	they'll often sink vertically in the water,
494.331	and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,
496.76	and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes
499.379	on the bottom and let us go get it,
500.913	and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.
503.129	But when we don't dive down and get it,
504.965	they'll bring it to the surface
506.938	and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
510.112	and drop it for us like they do their calves,
512.198	and then we'll pick it up and have a game.
514.4	And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat
516.75	to build some technology that would allow the dolphins
519.568	to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?
522.843	So the original vision was to have a keyboard
525.213	hanging from the boat attached to a computer,
527.386	and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys
529.901	on the keypad and happily exchange information
532.791	and request toys from each other.
534.949	But we quickly found out that dolphins simply
536.743	were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.
539.869	They've got better things to do in the wild.
542.005	They might do it in captivity, but in the wild --
544.269	So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,
546.994	and we labeled four objects they like to play with,
549.734	the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,
552.675	which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)
554.786	And that's the scarf whistle,
556.629	which is also associated with a visual symbol.
559.547	And these are artificially created whistles.
561.841	They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,
564.469	but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.
566.889	And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,
571.068	working out in the field with this keyboard
573.289	using it with each other to do requests for toys
575.933	while the dolphins were watching.
577.592	And the dolphins could get in on the game.
578.959	They could point at the visual object,
580.894	or they could mimic the whistle.
583.368	Now this is video of a session.
586.736	The diver here has a rope toy,
588.937	and I'm on the keyboard on the left,
591.185	and I've just played the rope key,
593.833	and that's the request for the toy from the human.
597.044	So I've got the rope, I'm diving down,
600.247	and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,
602.881	because they're kind of like little kids.
603.949	You have to keep their attention.
606.506	I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
611.193	Here they come,
613.697	and then they're going to pick up the rope
615.006	and drag it around as a toy.
616.612	Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left,
618.397	and this is actually the first time that we tried this.
620.707	I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,
623.573	from the dolphins using the rope sound.
626.141	Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.
631.752	(Whistle)
632.978	That's the rope whistle.
635.678	Up come the dolphins,
636.975	and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.
640.58	(Applause)
643.564	So this is only once.
645.324	We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
648.132	Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.
650.6	This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin
652.389	over to the keyboard to show her
654.726	the visual and the acoustic signal.
657.916	"Now this dolphin, we call her ""the scarf thief,"""
660.983	because over the years she's absconded
664.476	with about 12 scarves.
667.054	In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.
670.828	So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.
674.522	And we try to not touch the animals too much,
676.286	we really don't want to over-habituate them.
678.422	And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.
680.537	And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
684.483	to request the scarf.
686.294	So I try to give her the scarf.
689.043	Whoop. Almost lost it.
692.018	But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.
694.934	The dolphin's at the keyboard.
696.679	You've got full attention.
698.237	And this sometimes went on for hours.
700.493	And I wanted to share this video with you
701.948	not to show you any big breakthroughs,
703.733	because they haven't happened yet,
704.853	but to show you the level of intention and focus
707.479	that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.
710.126	And because of this, we really decided we needed
712.147	some more sophisticated technology.
714.241	So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,
716.441	with Thad Starner's wearable computing group,
719.117	to build us an underwater wearable computer
721.079	that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]
722.945	Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,
724.981	the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,
728.599	so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad
731.607	on the forearm,
732.786	the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,
734.974	if a dolphin mimics the whistle
736.384	or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in
738.893	and are localized by two hydrophones.
741.469	The computer can localize who requested the toy
744.816	if there's a word match.
746.853	And the real power of the system is in the real-time
749.417	sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins
751.334	quickly and accurately.
753.461	And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.
757.645	So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer
760.923	and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,
763.517	the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,
765.997	but also as a word through bone conduction.
768.429	So Diver A plays the scarf whistle
770.678	or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle
772.574	to request a toy from whoever has it.
774.99	What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,
778.199	and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound
781.369	that was played and requested,
784.114	then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin
787.962	and they'll swim away happily into the sunset
789.778	playing sargassum for forever.
792.895	Now, how far can this kind of communication go?
796.275	Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins
800.164	to request things from us.
801.746	It's designed to really be two-way.
804.139	Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?
807.418	We hope so and we think so.
809.299	But as we decode their natural sounds,
811.443	we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.
815.031	For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles
818.531	in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.
822.626	Likewise, we can create our own whistles,
826.356	our own whistle names, and let the dolphins
828.675	request specific divers to interact with.
831.443	Now it may be that all our mobile technology
834.364	will actually be the same technology that helps us
837.5	communicate with another species down the road.
840.731	In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,
844.363	well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways
847.746	and we might not be able to admit that right now,
850.289	but they live in quite a different environment,
852.113	and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.
856.613	I mean, imagine what it would be like
858.297	to really understand the mind
859.906	of another intelligent species on the planet.
863.691	Thank you.
865.039	(Applause)
