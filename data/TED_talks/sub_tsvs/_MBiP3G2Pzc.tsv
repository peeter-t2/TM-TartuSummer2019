12.882	Just after Christmas last year,
19.32	by either visiting Disneyland
21.333	or being exposed to someone
21.333	who'd been there.
24.282	The virus then hopped the Canadian border,
27.486	infecting more than
30.922	One of the tragic things
30.922	about this outbreak
33.871	is that measles, which can be fatal
33.871	to a child with a weakened immune system,
39.49	is one of the most easily
39.49	preventable diseases in the world.
43.275	An effective vaccine against it
45.272	has been available for more
45.272	than half a century,
48.638	but many of the kids involved
48.638	in the Disneyland outbreak
51.912	had not been vaccinated
53.886	because their parents were afraid
56.138	of something allegedly even worse:
59.157	autism.
60.875	But wait -- wasn't the paper
60.875	that sparked the controversy
64.658	about autism and vaccines
66.981	debunked, retracted,
68.978	and branded a deliberate fraud
71.45	by the British Medical Journal?
73.158	Don't most science-savvy people
75.201	know that the theory
75.201	that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?
79.52	I think most of you do,
81.377	but millions of parents worldwide
83.955	continue to fear that vaccines
83.955	put their kids at risk for autism.
88.923	Why?
90.827	Here's why.
92.29	This is a graph of autism
92.29	prevalence estimates rising over time.
97.375	For most of the 20th century,
99.488	autism was considered
99.488	an incredibly rare condition.
103.18	The few psychologists and pediatricians
103.18	who'd even heard of it
106.5	figured they would get through
106.5	their entire careers
109.217	without seeing a single case.
112.364	For decades, the prevalence estimates
112.364	remained stable
115.602	at just three or four children in 10,000.
118.853	But then, in the 1990s,
120.919	the numbers started to skyrocket.
123.38	Fundraising organizations
123.38	like Autism Speaks
126.608	routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,
129.696	as if you could catch it
129.696	from another kid at Disneyland.
133.365	So what's going on?
134.967	If it isn't vaccines, what is it?
138.194	If you ask the folks down at
138.194	the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
142.165	what's going on,
143.86	they tend to rely on phrases like
143.86	"""broadened diagnostic criteria"""
148.37	"and ""better case finding"""
150.134	to explain these rising numbers.
152.711	But that kind of language
154.731	doesn't do much to allay
154.731	the fears of a young mother
157.68	who is searching her
157.68	two-year-old's face for eye contact.
162.324	If the diagnostic criteria
162.324	had to be broadened,
165.319	why were they so narrow
165.319	in the first place?
168.152	Why were cases of autism
168.152	so hard to find
171.147	before the 1990s?
173.437	Five years ago, I decided to try
173.437	to uncover the answers to these questions.
179.172	I learned that what happened
181.216	has less to do with the slow and cautious
181.216	progress of science
185.116	than it does with the seductive
185.116	power of storytelling.
188.544	For most of the 20th century,
190.75	clinicians told one story
193.211	about what autism is
193.211	and how it was discovered,
196.763	but that story turned out to be wrong,
199.573	and the consequences of it
201.384	are having a devastating impact
201.384	on global public health.
205.285	There was a second,
205.285	more accurate story of autism
208.814	which had been lost and forgotten
211.43	in obscure corners
211.43	of the clinical literature.
214.41	This second story tells us everything
214.41	about how we got here
218.427	and where we need to go next.
221.352	The first story starts with a child
221.352	psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital
225.996	named Leo Kanner.
227.946	In 1943, Kanner published a paper
231.499	describing 11 young patients
231.499	who seemed to inhabit private worlds,
236.212	ignoring the people around them,
238.302	even their own parents.
240.462	They could amuse themselves for hours
242.737	by flapping their hands
242.737	in front of their faces,
245.384	but they were panicked by little things
247.358	like their favorite toy
247.358	being moved from its usual place
250.97	without their knowledge.
252.977	Based on the patients
252.977	who were brought to his clinic,
255.693	Kanner speculated
255.693	that autism is very rare.
259.269	By the 1950s, as the world's
259.269	leading authority on the subject,
263.727	he declared that he had seen
263.727	less than 150 true cases of his syndrome
269.3	while fielding referrals from
269.3	as far away as South Africa.
273.363	That's actually not surprising,
275.754	because Kanner's criteria
275.754	for diagnosing autism
279.13	were incredibly selective.
281.443	For example, he discouraged giving
281.443	the diagnosis to children who had seizures
286.621	but now we know that epilepsy
286.621	is very common in autism.
290.382	He once bragged that he had turned
290.382	nine out of 10 kids
293.424	referred to his office as autistic
293.424	by other clinicians
297.255	without giving them an autism diagnosis.
300.503	Kanner was a smart guy,
302.944	but a number of his theories
302.944	didn't pan out.
305.113	He classified autism as a form
305.113	of infantile psychosis
308.888	caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.
312.858	These children, he said,
314.995	had been kept neatly
314.995	in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.
319.313	At the same time, however,
321.264	Kanner noticed that some
321.264	of his young patients
324.189	had special abilities
324.189	that clustered in certain areas
327.602	like music, math and memory.
330.853	One boy in his clinic
332.734	could distinguish between 18 symphonies
332.734	before he turned two.
337.796	When his mother put on
337.796	one of his favorite records,
340.443	he would correctly declare,
340.443	"""Beethoven!"""
343.809	But Kanner took a dim view
343.809	of these abilities,
346.665	claiming that the kids
346.665	were just regurgitating things
350.242	they'd heard their pompous parents say,
352.865	desperate to earn their approval.
355.465	As a result, autism became
355.465	a source of shame and stigma for families,
360.829	and two generations of autistic children
363.406	were shipped off to institutions
363.406	for their own good,
366.889	becoming invisible to the world at large.
370.163	Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s
374.4	that researchers began to test
374.4	Kanner's theory that autism was rare.
379.567	Lorna Wing was a cognitive
379.567	psychologist in London
383.305	who thought that Kanner's theory
383.305	of refrigerator parenting
386.509	"were ""bloody stupid,"" as she told me."
389.528	She and her husband John were warm
389.528	and affectionate people,
393.707	and they had a profoundly
393.707	autistic daughter named Susie.
397.11	Lorna and John knew how hard it was
397.11	to raise a child like Susie
401.822	without support services,
403.784	special education,
405.386	and the other resources that are
405.386	out of reach without a diagnosis.
409.635	To make the case
409.635	to the National Health Service
412.259	that more resources were needed
412.259	for autistic children and their families,
417.507	Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould
419.643	decided to do something that should
419.643	have been done 30 years earlier.
424.193	They undertook a study of autism
424.193	prevalence in the general population.
429.139	They pounded the pavement
429.139	in a London suburb called Camberwell
433.435	to try to find autistic children
433.435	in the community.
437.1	What they saw made clear
437.1	that Kanner's model was way too narrow,
441.767	while the reality of autism
441.767	was much more colorful and diverse.
446.663	Some kids couldn't talk at all,
448.806	while others waxed on at length
448.806	about their fascination with astrophysics,
453.542	dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.
457.486	In other words, these children
457.486	didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,
462.176	as Judith put it,
463.871	and they saw lots of them,
465.752	way more than Kanner's monolithic model
465.752	would have predicted.
469.537	At first, they were at a loss
469.537	to make sense of their data.
473.252	How had no one noticed
473.252	these children before?
476.38	But then Lorna came upon a reference
476.38	to a paper that had been published
479.899	in German in 1944,
482.554	the year after Kanner's paper,
484.899	and then forgotten,
486.617	buried with the ashes of a terrible time
489.194	that no one wanted to remember
489.194	or think about.
492.445	Kanner knew about this competing paper,
495.115	but scrupulously avoided
495.115	mentioning it in his own work.
499.86	It had never even
499.86	been translated into English,
502.322	but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,
505.285	and he translated it for her.
507.932	The paper offered
507.932	an alternate story of autism.
511.624	Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,
514.317	who ran a combination clinic
514.317	and residential school
517.591	in Vienna in the 1930s.
520.331	Asperger's ideas about teaching children
520.331	with learning differences
524.302	were progressive even
524.302	by contemporary standards.
527.436	Mornings at his clinic began
527.436	with exercise classes set to music,
531.848	and the children put on plays
531.848	on Sunday afternoons.
535.354	Instead of blaming parents
535.354	for causing autism,
538.349	Asperger framed it as a lifelong,
538.349	polygenetic disability
543.202	that requires compassionate forms
543.202	of support and accommodations
547.103	over the course of one's whole life.
550.51	Rather than treating the kids
550.51	in his clinic like patients,
553.395	Asperger called them
553.395	his little professors,
556.46	and enlisted their help in developing
556.46	methods of education
560.245	that were particularly suited to them.
562.729	Crucially, Asperger viewed autism
562.729	as a diverse continuum
568.46	that spans an astonishing range
568.46	of giftedness and disability.
573.584	He believed that autism
573.584	and autistic traits are common
577.116	and always have been,
578.982	seeing aspects of this continuum
578.982	in familiar archetypes from pop culture
584.276	like the socially awkward scientist
586.612	and the absent-minded professor.
589.306	He went so far as to say,
591.419	it seems that for success
591.419	in science and art,
594.646	a dash of autism is essential.
598.292	Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner
598.292	had been as wrong about autism being rare
603.214	as he had been about parents causing it.
605.907	Over the next several years,
607.951	they quietly worked with
607.951	the American Psychiatric Association
611.364	to broaden the criteria for diagnosis
613.964	to reflect the diversity of what
613.964	"they called ""the autism spectrum."""
617.981	In the late '80s and early 1990s,
620.559	their changes went into effect,
622.857	swapping out Kanner's narrow model
625.226	for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.
628.801	These changes weren't
628.801	happening in a vacuum.
631.472	By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith
631.472	worked behind the scenes
635.326	to reform the criteria,
637.16	people all over the world were seeing
637.16	an autistic adult for the first time.
642.176	"Before ""Rain Man"" came out in 1988,"
645.55	only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts
645.55	knew what autism looked like,
650.209	but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable
650.209	performance as Raymond Babbitt
654.969	"earned ""Rain Man"" four Academy Awards,"
658.104	pediatricians, psychologists,
660.844	teachers and parents all over the world
660.844	knew what autism looked like.
665.534	Coincidentally, at the same time,
668.459	the first easy-to-use clinical tests
668.459	for diagnosing autism were introduced.
673.939	You no longer had to have a connection
673.939	to that tiny circle of experts
678.629	to get your child evaluated.
681.207	"The combination of ""Rain Man,"""
683.32	the changes to the criteria,
683.32	and the introduction of these tests
687.499	created a network effect,
689.774	a perfect storm of autism awareness.
693.304	The number of diagnoses started to soar,
696.322	just as Lorna and Judith predicted,
696.322	indeed hoped, that it would,
701.99	enabling autistic people
701.99	and their families
704.106	to finally get the support
704.106	and services they deserved.
707.798	Then Andrew Wakefield came along
709.864	to blame the spike
709.864	in diagnoses on vaccines,
713.719	a simple, powerful,
715.832	and seductively believable story
718.618	that was as wrong as Kanner's theory
720.986	that autism was rare.
723.239	If the CDC's current estimate,
726.71	that one in 68 kids in America
726.71	are on the spectrum, is correct,
731.133	autistics are one of the largest
731.133	minority groups in the world.
735.34	In recent years, autistic people
735.34	have come together on the Internet
739.167	to reject the notion that they
739.167	are puzzles to be solved
742.812	by the next medical breakthrough,
744.995	"coining the term ""neurodiversity"""
747.456	to celebrate the varieties
747.456	of human cognition.
751.264	One way to understand neurodiversity
753.655	is to think in terms
753.655	of human operating systems.
757.324	Just because a P.C. is not running Windows
757.324	doesn't mean that it's broken.
762.24	By autistic standards,
762.24	the normal human brain
765.869	is easily distractable,
767.889	obsessively social,
769.677	and suffers from a deficit
769.677	of attention to detail.
772.997	To be sure, autistic people
772.997	have a hard time
775.992	living in a world not built for them.
778.268	[Seventy] years later, we're still
778.268	catching up to Asperger,
782.52	"who believed that the ""cure"""
782.52	for the most disabling aspects of autism
786.603	is to be found in understanding teachers,
789.529	accommodating employers,
791.665	supportive communities,
793.522	and parents who have faith
793.522	in their children's potential.
796.866	An autistic [man]
796.866	named Zosia Zaks once said,
799.908	"""We need all hands on deck"
799.908	"to right the ship of humanity."""
805.211	As we sail into an uncertain future,
807.764	we need every form
807.764	of human intelligence on the planet
811.502	working together to tackle
811.502	the challenges that we face as a society.
817.469	We can't afford to waste a brain.
819.791	Thank you.
