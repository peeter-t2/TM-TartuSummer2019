16.26	I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.
19.26	My wife sent me a message,
22.26	"""Whoa, earthquake,"""
24.26	and then disappeared for 25 minutes.
28.26	It was 25 minutes of absolute terror
31.26	that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.
36.26	I was afraid of a tsunami;
39.26	what I didn't realize
41.26	was there was a greater terror in Haiti,
44.26	and that was building collapse.
47.26	We've all seen the photos
49.26	of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.
52.26	These are shots my wife took
54.26	a couple days after the quake,
56.26	while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.
60.26	This is the national palace --
62.26	the equivalent of the White House.
65.26	This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean
68.26	at peak shopping time.
73.26	This is a nurses' college --
75.26	there are 300 nurses studying.
79.26	The general hospital right next door
81.26	emerged largely unscathed.
84.26	This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
90.26	We have all heard
92.26	about the tremendous human loss
95.26	in the earthquake in Haiti,
97.26	but we haven't heard enough
100.26	about why all those lives were lost.
103.26	We haven't heard about
105.26	why the buildings failed.
108.26	After all, it was the buildings,
110.26	not the earthquake,
112.26	that killed 220,000 people,
115.26	that injured 330,000,
118.26	that displaced 1.3 million people,
124.26	that cut off food
126.26	and water and supplies
128.26	for an entire nation.
131.26	This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster
136.26	in decades,
139.26	and it was not a natural disaster --
142.26	it was a disaster of engineering.
145.26	AIDG has worked in Haiti
147.26	since 2007,
149.26	providing engineering and business support
151.26	to small businesses.
153.26	And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers
157.26	to figure out why the buildings collapsed,
159.26	to examine what was safe and what wasn't.
162.26	Working with MINUSTAH,
165.26	which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,
167.26	with the Ministry of Public Works,
169.26	with different NGOs,
171.26	we inspected over 1,500 buildings.
175.26	We inspected schools
177.26	and private residencies.
179.26	We inspected medical centers
181.26	and food warehouses.
183.26	We inspected government buildings.
185.26	This is the Ministry of Justice.
187.26	Behind that door
189.26	is the National Judicial Archives.
192.26	The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --
194.26	who's the director
196.26	of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research
200.26	at the University of Buffalo --
203.26	was examining it to see if it was safe
205.26	to recover the archives.
207.26	Andre told me,
209.26	after seeing these buildings fail
211.26	again and again in the same way,
214.26	that there is no new research here.
217.26	There is nothing here that we don't know.
220.26	The failure points were the same:
223.26	walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --
226.26	that's a roof slab hanging off the building --
231.26	cantilevered structures,
233.26	or structures that were asymmetric,
235.26	that shook violently and came down,
239.26	poor building materials,
241.26	not enough concrete,
243.26	not enough compression in the blocks,
247.26	rebar that was smooth,
249.26	rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.
252.26	Now there's a solution
255.26	to all these problems.
257.26	And we know how to build properly.
260.26	The proof of this came in Chile,
263.26	almost a month later,
266.26	when 8.8 magnitude earthquake
270.26	hit Chile.
272.26	That is 500 times
274.26	the power of the 7.0
276.26	that hit Port-au-Prince --
281.26	yet only under a thousand casualties.
286.26	Adjusted for population density,
288.26	that is less than one percent
290.26	of the impact of the Haitian quake.
294.26	What was the difference
296.26	between Chile and Haiti?
299.26	Seismic standards
301.26	and confined masonry,
304.26	where the building acts as a whole --
306.26	walls and columns
308.26	and roofs and slabs
310.26	tied together to support each other --
313.26	instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
318.26	If you look at this building in Chile,
321.26	it's ripped in half,
323.26	but it's not a pile of rubble.
327.26	Chileans have been building with confined masonry
329.26	for decades.
332.26	Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,
336.26	Architecture for Humanity,
338.26	to bring more confined masonry training
341.26	into Haiti.
345.26	This is Xantus Daniel;
347.26	he's a mason,
349.26	just a general construction worker, not a foreman,
352.26	who took one of our trainings.
354.26	On his last job he was working with his boss,
357.26	and they started pouring the columns wrong.
360.26	He took his boss aside,
362.26	and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.
365.26	"He showed him, ""You know, we don't have to do this wrong."
368.26	It won't cost us any more
370.26	"to do it the right way."""
373.26	And they redid that building.
375.26	They tied the rebar right,
377.26	they poured the columns right,
379.26	and that building will be safe.
381.26	And every building
383.26	that they build going forward
385.26	will be safe.
388.26	To make sure these buildings are safe,
390.26	it's not going to take policy --
393.26	it's going to take reaching out
395.26	to the masons on the ground
398.26	and helping them learn the proper techniques.
403.26	Now there are many groups doing this.
405.26	And the fellow in the vest there,
407.26	Craig Toten,
409.26	he has pushed forward
411.26	to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.
415.26	Through Haiti Rewired,
417.26	through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,
420.26	AIDG,
422.26	there is the possibility
424.26	to reach out
427.26	to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons
430.26	across the country
432.26	and create a movement of proper building.
437.26	If you reach out to the people on the ground
439.26	in this collaborative way
441.26	it's extremely affordable.
444.26	For the billions spent on reconstruction,
448.26	you can train masons
450.26	for dollars on every house
452.26	that they end up building over their lifetime.
457.26	Ultimately, there are two ways
459.26	that you can rebuild Haiti;
461.26	the way at the top
463.26	is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
466.26	The way at the top
468.26	is a poorly constructed building
470.26	that will fail.
472.26	The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,
475.26	where the walls are tied together,
477.26	the building is symmetric,
479.26	and it will stand up to an earthquake.
482.26	For all the disaster,
484.26	there is an opportunity here
487.26	to build better houses
489.26	for the next generation,
491.26	so that when the next earthquake hits,
494.26	it is a disaster --
496.26	but not a tragedy.
499.26	(Applause)
