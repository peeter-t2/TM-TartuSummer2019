12.999	Last year, I went on my first book tour.
16.271	In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries
19.613	and gave some hundred talks.
22.462	Every talk in every country
24.999	began with an introduction,
26.999	and every introduction began,
26.999	alas, with a lie:
32.567	"""Taiye Selasi comes"
32.567	"from Ghana and Nigeria,"""
35.912	"or ""Taiye Selasi comes"
35.912	"from England and the States."""
40.428	Whenever I heard this opening sentence,
42.999	no matter the country that concluded it --
45.588	England, America, Ghana, Nigeria --
47.999	"I thought, ""But that's not true."""
51.127	Yes, I was born in England
51.127	and grew up in the United States.
55.436	My mum, born in England,
55.436	and raised in Nigeria,
58.807	currently lives in Ghana.
60.815	My father was born in Gold Coast,
60.815	a British colony,
65.064	raised in Ghana,
66.673	and has lived for over 30 years
66.673	in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
70.804	For this reason, my introducers
70.804	"also called me ""multinational."""
76.498	"""But Nike is multinational,"" I thought,"
80.49	"""I'm a human being."""
83.124	Then, one fine day, mid-tour,
86.308	I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark
89.808	where I shared the stage
89.808	with the writer Colum McCann.
93.58	We were discussing the role
93.58	of locality in writing,
96.494	when suddenly it hit me.
99.157	I'm not multinational.
101.166	I'm not a national at all.
104.186	How could I come from a nation?
106.999	How can a human being come from a concept?
110.745	It's a question that had been bothering me
110.745	for going on two decades.
115.403	From newspapers, textbooks, conversations,
118.6	I had learned to speak of countries
120.886	as if they were eternal, singular,
120.886	naturally occurring things,
125.673	but I wondered:
127.554	to say that I came from a country
129.35	suggested that the country
129.35	was an absolute,
132.389	some fixed point in place in time,
135.095	a constant thing, but was it?
138.191	In my lifetime, countries
138.191	had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia;
142.841	appeared -- Timor-Leste;
142.841	failed -- Somalia.
147.224	My parents came from countries
147.224	that didn't exist when they were born.
151.522	To me, a country -- this thing that could
151.522	be born, die, expand, contract --
157.856	hardly seemed the basis
157.856	for understanding a human being.
161.602	And so it came as a huge relief
161.602	to discover the sovereign state.
167.232	What we call countries are actually
169.194	various expressions
169.194	of sovereign statehood,
171.867	an idea that came into fashion
171.867	only 400 years ago.
176.295	When I learned this, beginning my
176.295	masters degree in international relations,
181.205	I felt a sort of surge of relief.
183.598	It was as I had suspected.
186.352	History was real, cultures were real,
190.047	but countries were invented.
193.022	For the next 10 years, I sought
193.022	to re- or un-define myself,
197.507	my world, my work, my experience,
199.999	beyond the logic of the state.
202.198	In 2005, I wrote an essay,
202.198	"""What is an Afropolitan,"""
206.761	sketching out an identity
206.761	that privileged culture over country.
212.053	It was thrilling how many people
212.053	could relate to my experience,
216.596	and instructional how many others
216.596	didn't buy my sense of self.
222.224	"""How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,"""
222.224	one such critic asked,
227.248	"""when she's never known the indignities"
229.54	of traveling abroad
229.54	"on a Ghanian passport?"""
232.777	Now, if I'm honest,
234.999	I knew just what she meant.
236.999	I've got a friend named Layla
236.999	who was born and raised in Ghana.
240.472	Her parents are third-generation
240.472	Ghanians of Lebanese descent.
245.506	Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,
245.506	knows Accra like the back of her hand,
250.53	but when we first met years ago,
250.53	"I thought, ""She's not from Ghana."""
255.648	In my mind, she came from Lebanon,
258.259	despite the patent fact
258.259	that all her formative experience
261.999	took place in suburban Accra.
264.376	I, like my critics,
266.742	was imagining some Ghana
266.742	where all Ghanaians had brown skin
272.296	or none held U.K. passports.
275.219	I'd fallen into the limiting trap
277.45	that the language of coming
277.45	from countries sets --
280.645	the privileging of a fiction,
280.645	the singular country,
284.4	over reality: human experience.
288.363	Speaking with Colum McCann that day,
288.363	the penny finally dropped.
293.433	"""All experience is local,"" he said."
296.788	"""All identity is experience,"" I thought."
300.836	"""I'm not a national,"""
300.836	I proclaimed onstage.
304.71	"""I'm a local. I'm multi-local."""
307.876	"See, ""Taiye Selasi comes"
307.876	"from the United States,"" isn't the truth."
312.452	I have no relationship
312.452	with the United States,
315.253	all 50 of them, not really.
317.831	My relationship is with Brookline,
317.831	the town where I grew up;
321.638	with New York City, where I started work;
324.203	with Lawrenceville,
324.203	where I spend Thanksgiving.
327.797	What makes America home for me
327.797	is not my passport or accent,
333.061	but these very particular experiences
335.721	and the places they occur.
338.076	Despite my pride in Ewe culture,
340.831	the Black Stars,
340.831	and my love of Ghanaian food,
343.999	I've never had a relationship
343.999	with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.
348.738	My relationship is with Accra,
348.738	where my mother lives,
352.417	where I go each year,
354.052	with the little garden in Dzorwulu
354.052	where my father and I talk for hours.
359.209	These are the places
359.209	that shape my experience.
362.607	My experience is where I'm from.
365.999	What if we asked, instead
365.999	"of ""Where are you from?"" --"
369.782	"""Where are you a local?"""
371.61	This would tell us so much more
371.61	about who and how similar we are.
376.047	Tell me you're from France,
376.047	and I see what, a set of clichés?
380.655	Adichie's dangerous single story,
380.655	the myth of the nation of France?
385.355	Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,
388.613	better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see
388.613	a set of experiences.
393.002	Our experience is where we're from.
395.999	So, where are you a local?
398.07	I propose a three-step test.
400.601	"I call these the three ""R’s"":"
400.601	rituals, relationships, restrictions.
406.619	First, think of your daily rituals,
406.619	whatever they may be:
410.557	making your coffee, driving to work,
412.614	harvesting your crops,
412.614	saying your prayers.
415.514	What kind of rituals are these?
417.76	Where do they occur?
419.237	In what city or cities in the world
419.237	do shopkeepers know your face?
424.582	As a child, I carried out fairly standard
424.582	suburban rituals in Boston,
428.999	with adjustments made for the rituals
428.999	my mother brought from London and Lagos.
433.654	We took off our shoes in the house,
435.525	we were unfailingly
435.525	polite with our elders,
438.239	we ate slow-cooked, spicy food.
440.865	In snowy North America,
440.865	ours were rituals of the global South.
446.132	The first time I went to Delhi
446.132	or to southern parts of Italy,
449.999	I was shocked by how at home I felt.
452.359	The rituals were familiar.
454.975	"""R"" number one, rituals."
457.578	Now, think of your relationships,
457.578	of the people who shape your days.
462.065	To whom do you speak at least once a week,
464.629	be it face to face or on FaceTime?
467.453	Be reasonable in your assessment;
469.183	I'm not talking about
469.183	your Facebook friends.
472.064	I'm speaking of the people who shape
472.064	your weekly emotional experience.
476.371	My mother in Accra,
476.371	my twin sister in Boston,
478.999	my best friends in New York:
481.065	these relationships are home for me.
483.822	"""R"" number two, relationships."
486.665	We're local where we carry out
486.665	our rituals and relationships,
490.999	but how we experience our locality
493.765	depends in part on our restrictions.
497.075	By restrictions, I mean,
497.075	where are you able to live?
499.942	What passport do you hold?
501.999	Are you restricted by, say, racism,
501.999	from feeling fully at home where you live?
507.29	By civil war, dysfunctional governance,
507.29	economic inflation,
511.577	from living in the locality
511.577	where you had your rituals as a child?
516.396	This is the least sexy of the R’s,
519.017	less lyric than rituals and relationships,
521.999	but the question takes us past
521.999	"""Where are you now?"""
525.333	"to ""Why aren't you there, and why?"""
529.174	Rituals, relationships, restrictions.
532.503	Take a piece of paper
534.052	and put those three words
534.052	on top of three columns,
537.368	then try to fill those columns
537.368	as honestly as you can.
541.041	A very different picture
541.041	of your life in local context,
545.226	of your identity as a set of experiences,
548.664	may emerge.
549.848	So let's try it.
551.088	I have a friend named Olu.
552.877	He's 35 years old.
554.496	His parents, born in Nigeria,
554.496	came to Germany on scholarships.
558.465	Olu was born in Nuremberg
558.465	and lived there until age 10.
562.05	When his family moved to Lagos,
562.05	he studied in London,
564.867	then came to Berlin.
566.316	He loves going to Nigeria --
568.999	the weather, the food, the friends --
571.657	but hates the political corruption there.
574.655	Where is Olu from?
576.426	I have another friend named Udo.
578.641	He's also 35 years old.
580.624	Udo was born in Córdoba,
580.624	in northwest Argentina,
583.847	where his grandparents migrated
583.847	from Germany, what is now Poland,
587.059	after the war.
588.511	Udo studied in Buenos Aires,
588.511	and nine years ago came to Berlin.
592.417	He loves going to Argentina -- 
592.417	the weather, the food, the friends --
596.642	but hates the economic corruption there.
599.467	Where is Udo from?
601.429	With his blonde hair and blue eyes,
601.429	Udo could pass for German,
605.086	but holds an Argentinian passport,
605.086	so needs a visa to live in Berlin.
609.166	That Udo is from Argentina
609.166	has largely to do with history.
613.499	That he's a local
613.499	of Buenos Aires and Berlin,
616.68	that has to do with life.
618.774	Olu, who looks Nigerian,
618.774	needs a visa to visit Nigeria.
622.999	He speaks Yoruba with an English accent,
625.414	and English with a German one.
627.517	To claim that he's
627.517	"""not really Nigerian,"" though,"
630.082	denies his experience in Lagos,
632.434	the rituals he practiced growing up,
634.641	his relationship with family and friends.
637.531	Meanwhile, though Lagos
637.531	is undoubtedly one of his homes,
641.476	Olu always feels restricted there,
643.999	not least by the fact that he's gay.
647.228	Both he and Udo are restricted
647.228	by the political conditions
650.975	of their parents' countries,
652.652	from living where some of their
652.652	most meaningful rituals
655.66	and relationships occur.
657.634	To say Olu is from Nigeria
657.634	and Udo is from Argentina
661.759	distracts from their common experience.
663.896	Their rituals, their relationships,
663.896	and their restrictions are the same.
668.146	Of course, when we ask,
668.146	"""Where are you from?"""
670.584	we're using a kind of shorthand.
672.529	"It's quicker to say ""Nigeria"""
672.529	"than ""Lagos and Berlin,"""
676.916	and as with Google Maps,
676.916	we can always zoom in closer,
680.771	from country to city to neighborhood.
683.255	But that's not quite the point.
686.31	The difference between
686.31	"""Where are you from?"""
688.923	"and ""Where are you a local?"""
690.463	isn't the specificity of the answer;
693.449	it's the intention of the question.
696.04	Replacing the language of nationality
696.04	with the language of locality asks us
701.206	to shift our focus
701.206	to where real life occurs.
705.349	Even that most glorious expression
705.349	of countryhood, the World Cup,
709.59	gives us national teams comprised
709.59	mostly of multilocal players.
715.659	As a unit of measurement
715.659	for human experience,
718.2	the country doesn't quite work.
720.999	"That's why Olu says, ""I'm German,"
720.999	"but my parents come from Nigeria."""
725.249	"The ""but"" in that sentence"
725.249	belies the inflexibility of the units,
730.629	one fixed and fictional entity
730.629	bumping up against another.
735.164	"""I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,"""
735.164	suggests overlapping experiences,
739.61	layers that merge together,
739.61	that can't be denied or removed.
744.176	You can take away my passport,
746.432	but you can't take away my experience.
748.563	That I carry within me.
750.698	Where I'm from comes wherever I go.
754.253	To be clear, I'm not suggesting
754.253	that we do away with countries.
757.645	There's much to be said
757.645	for national history,
759.803	more for the sovereign state.
761.788	Culture exists in community,
761.788	and community exists in context.
766.509	Geography, tradition, collective memory:
766.509	these things are important.
771.006	What I'm questioning is primacy.
773.999	All of those introductions on tour
773.999	began with reference to nation,
778.687	as if knowing what country I came
778.687	from would tell my audience who I was.
783.51	What are we really seeking, though,
783.51	when we ask where someone comes from?
787.439	And what are we really seeing
787.439	when we hear an answer?
790.999	Here's one possibility:
792.294	basically, countries represent power.
795.588	"""Where are you from?"""
795.588	Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.
800.671	America. Germany. Japan. More power.
804.189	China. Russia. Ambiguous.
807.703	(Laughter)
809.387	It's possible that without realizing it,
809.387	we're playing a power game,
813.072	especially in the context
813.072	of multi-ethnic countries.
816.437	As any recent immigrant knows,
818.731	"the question ""Where are you from?"""
818.731	"or ""Where are you really from?"""
822.999	"is often code for ""Why are you here?"""
826.324	Then we have the scholar
826.324	William Deresiewicz's writing
829.46	of elite American colleges.
831.257	"""Students think that"
831.257	their environment is diverse
834.432	if one comes from Missouri
834.432	and another from Pakistan --
837.711	never mind that all of their parents
837.711	"are doctors or bankers."""
842.114	I'm with him.
843.297	To call one student American,
843.297	another Pakistani,
846.792	then triumphantly claim
846.792	student body diversity
850.077	ignores the fact that these students
850.077	are locals of the same milieu.
853.744	The same holds true on the other end
853.744	of the economic spectrum.
857.593	A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles
857.593	and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi
862.289	have more in common
862.289	in terms of rituals and restrictions
866.136	than nationality implies.
867.946	Perhaps my biggest problem
867.946	with coming from countries
871.565	is the myth of going back to them.
873.303	I'm often asked if I plan
873.303	"to ""go back"" to Ghana."
876.422	I go to Accra every year,
876.422	"but I can't ""go back"" to Ghana."
880.766	It's not because I wasn't born there.
882.591	My father can't go back, either.
884.948	The country in which he was born,
886.999	that country no longer exists.
889.357	We can never go back to a place
889.357	and find it exactly where we left it.
893.216	Something, somewhere
893.216	will always have changed,
896.088	most of all, ourselves.
898.738	People.
899.985	Finally, what we're talking
899.985	about is human experience,
902.556	this notoriously and gloriously
902.556	disorderly affair.
906.888	In creative writing,
906.888	locality bespeaks humanity.
910.31	The more we know
910.31	about where a story is set,
912.611	the more local color and texture,
914.999	the more human
914.999	the characters start to feel,
917.5	the more relatable, not less.
919.8	The myth of national identity
919.8	and the vocabulary of coming from
924.268	confuses us into placing ourselves
924.268	into mutually exclusive categories.
929.254	In fact, all of us are multi --
929.254	multi-local, multi-layered.
933.583	To begin our conversations
933.583	with an acknowledgement of this complexity
937.391	brings us closer together, I think,
937.391	not further apart.
940.996	So the next time that I'm introduced,
944.322	I'd love to hear the truth:
946.195	"""Taiye Selasi is a human being,"
946.195	like everybody here.
950.226	She isn't a citizen of the world,
950.226	but a citizen of worlds.
954.308	She is a local of New York,
954.308	"Rome and Accra."""
957.411	Thank you.
958.596	(Applause)
