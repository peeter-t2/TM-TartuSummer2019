12.492	Six months ago, I got an email
14.673	from a man in Israel
16.08	who had read one of my books,
17.461	and the email said,
18.964	"""You don't know me,"
20.971	"but I'm your 12th cousin."""
23.443	"And it said, ""I have a family tree"
25.82	with 80,000 people on it, including you,
29.724	Karl Marx,
30.878	"and several European aristocrats."""
33.478	Now I did not know what to make of this.
35.88	Part of me was like, okay,
38.231	when's he going to ask me to wire
43.888	I also thought, 80,000 relatives,
47.576	do I want that?
48.854	I have enough trouble with some of the ones
50.672	I have already.
52.109	And I won't name names, but you know who you are.
55.775	But another part of me said, this is remarkable.
59.024	Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.
61.76	I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,
65.32	and that's four Madison Square Gardens
68.697	full of cousins.
70.412	And some of them are going to be great,
73.349	and some of them are going to be irritating,
75.679	but they're all related to me.
78.495	So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,
82.366	which I always thought was
82.366	a very staid and proper field,
85.766	but it turns out it's going through a fascinating
88.691	revolution, and a controversial one.
91.184	Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,
94.95	but partly, it's because of the Internet.
98.9	There are sites that now take
100.66	the Wikipedia approach to family trees,
103.827	collaboration and crowdsourcing,
106.18	and what you do is,
107.358	you load your family tree on,
110.24	and then these sites search
111.72	to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree
114.402	is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,
116.882	and if it is, then you can combine,
120.115	and then you combine and combine and combine
122.01	until you get these massive,
123.911	mega-family trees
125.761	with thousands of people on them,
128.262	or even millions.
129.677	I'm on something on Geni called
132.004	the world family tree,
133.93	which has no less than a jaw-dropping
140.017	So that's 75 million people connected by blood
143.857	or marriage, sometimes both.
146.337	(Laughter)
148.904	It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.
153.089	I'm on it. Many of you are on it,
155.466	whether you know it or not,
157.17	and you can see the links.
159.634	Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.
164.226	She has no idea I exist,
166.109	but we are officially cousins.
168.8	We have just 17 links between us.
172.996	And there's my cousin Barack Obama.
175.689	(Laughter)
176.881	And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's
180.506	father's wife's seventh great-nephew,
184.014	so practically my old brother.
189.079	And my cousin, of course,
190.602	the actor Kevin Bacon --
191.919	(Laughter) —
193.571	who is my first cousin's twice removed's
196.535	wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's
198.927	niece's husband.
200.137	So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,
202.272	plus or minus several degrees.
206.391	Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you
208.772	have famous people and historical figures
211	in your tree, because we are all connected,
214.667	and 75 million may seem like a lot,
217.83	but in a few years, it's quite likely
220.556	we will have a family tree
222.069	with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.
226.82	But does it really matter?
228.613	What's the importance?
229.955	And I do think it is important,
231.633	and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.
234.111	First, it's got scientific value.
236.931	This is an unprecedented history of the human race,
240.545	and it's giving us valuable data
243.976	about how diseases are inherited,
246.125	how people migrate,
247.993	and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now
250.913	studying the world family tree.
253.593	Number two, it brings history alive.
256.479	I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,
259.94	so I told my seven-year-old son that,
262	and he was totally engaged.
264.846	Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy
268.213	with weird hair.
269.423	He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)
273.58	And my son wanted to know,
275.14	"""What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"""
277.297	Also, it's not all good news.
279.356	I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,
283.343	but I will say that's on my wife's side.
285.96	(Laughter) (Applause)
288.648	So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.
291.243	Number three, interconnectedness.
294.132	We all come from the same ancestor,
297.495	and you don't have to believe
297.495	the literal Bible version,
300.063	but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam
304.151	and mitochondrial Eve,
307.004	and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.
310.32	We all have a bit of their DNA in us.
313.373	They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --
316.19	continue that for about 7,000 times --
318.93	grandparents,
320.745	and so that means we literally all are
323.391	biological cousins as well,
325.546	and estimates vary, but probably
328.102	the farthest cousin you have on Earth
330.804	is about a 50th cousin.
333.259	Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.
337.44	If you have kids, and they have kids,
340.14	look how quickly the descendants accumulate.
343.605	So in 10, 12 generations,
345.298	you're going to have thousands of offspring,
347.429	and millions of offspring.
348.946	Number four, a kinder world.
350.935	Now, I know that there are family feuds.
353.424	I have three sons, so I see how they fight.
355.719	But I think that there's also a human bias
358.385	to treat your family a little better than strangers.
360.911	I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,
364.735	because they're going to have to realize
368.16	that they are cousins with thousands of people
371.77	in whatever ethnic group they happen
373.521	to have issues with,
375.783	and I think you look back at history,
377.668	and a lot of the terrible things
377.668	we've done to each other
380.669	is because one group thinks
380.669	another group is sub-human,
383.575	and you can't do that anymore.
385.04	We're not just part of the same species.
386.41	We're part of the same family.
388.177	We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.
391.813	Now the final one is number five,
394.114	a democratizing effect.
395.793	Some genealogy has an elitist strain,
399.25	"like people say, ""Oh, I'm descended"
401.24	from Mary Queen of Scots
402.511	"and you're not, so you cannot join my country club."""
405.718	But that's really going to be hard to do now,
408.659	because everyone is related.
410.09	I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --
412.778	by marriage, but still.
416.131	So it's really a fascinating time
419.627	in the history of family,
421.183	because it's changing so fast.
424.69	There is gay marriage and sperm donors
427.265	and there's intermarriage
427.265	on an unprecedented scale,
432.185	and this makes some of my
432.185	more conservative cousins
434.411	a little nervous,
436.02	but I actually think it's a good thing.
437.824	I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,
441.653	the better,
442.68	because then you have more potential caretakers,
444.784	and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed
449.099	Hillary Clinton says --
451.226	(Laughter) —
452.97	it takes a village.
454.299	So I have all these hundreds and thousands,
459.562	millions of new cousins.
460.68	I thought, what can I do with this information?
463.421	And that's when I decided,
465.277	why not throw a party?
467.516	So that's what I'm doing.
469.752	And you're all invited.
472.312	Next year, next summer,
474.21	I will be hosting what I hope is
476.141	the biggest and best family reunion in history.
480.619	(Applause)
481.651	Thank you. I want you there.
484.053	I want you there.
485.165	It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,
487.639	which is a great venue,
489.921	but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,
493.701	which is, I think, very appropriate,
497.346	because I see this as a family reunion
499.576	meets a world's fair.
500.994	There's going to be exhibits and food, music.
503.935	Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,
506.244	so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.
509.844	He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.
512.579	And there is going to be a day of speakers,
514.97	of fascinating cousins.
516.971	It's early, but I've already,
518.153	I've got some lined up.
520.025	Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps
522.749	the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.
525.137	He was a former member
525.137	of the Obama administration.
528.376	And on the other side of the political spectrum,
531.2	George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,
534.332	he has agreed to participate,
536.187	and Nick Kroll, the comedian,
538.623	and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.
542.122	And, of course, the most important is that you,
546.52	I want you guys there,
548.466	and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org
551.901	and figure out how you're on the family tree,
554.996	because these are big issues, family and tribe,
559.189	and I don't know all the answers,
561.907	but I have a lot of smart relatives,
564.756	including you guys,
566.337	so together, I think we can figure it out.
569.604	Only together can we solve these big problems.
572.259	So from cousin to cousin,
574.289	I thank you. I can't wait to see you.
576.681	Goodbye.
578.582	(Applause)
