15.26	One day, Los Angeles Times columnist
18.26	Steve Lopez was walking along
20.26	the streets of downtown Los Angeles
22.26	when he heard beautiful music.
25.26	And the source was a man,
27.26	an African-American man,
29.26	charming, rugged, homeless,
33.26	playing a violin that only had two strings.
36.26	And I'm telling a story that many of you know,
38.26	because Steve's columns became the basis
41.26	for a book, which was turned into a movie,
44.26	with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,
46.26	and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,
49.26	the Juilliard-trained double bassist
51.26	whose promising career was cut short
54.26	by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
58.26	Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,
60.26	and 30 years later he was living homeless
62.26	on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
66.26	I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie
69.26	to understand not only the beautiful bond
72.26	that formed between these two men,
74.26	but how music helped shape that bond,
77.26	and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --
80.26	in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.
84.26	I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,
86.26	two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
88.26	He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,
91.26	and came backstage and introduced himself.
93.26	He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way
96.26	about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton
99.26	and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,
101.26	all because of the treacherous first violin passage work
104.26	in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.
108.26	And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later
112.26	saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
116.26	Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment
119.26	because when he was treated it was with shock therapy
122.26	and Thorazine and handcuffs,
124.26	and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.
128.26	But as a result now, he is prone to
130.26	these schizophrenic episodes,
132.26	the worst of which can manifest themselves as
134.26	him exploding
136.26	and then disappearing for days,
138.26	wandering the streets of Skid Row,
140.26	exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind
144.26	unleashed upon him.
146.26	And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation
149.26	when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --
152.26	he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,
155.26	he was lost.
157.26	And he was talking about
159.26	invisible demons and smoke,
161.26	and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.
165.26	And I was afraid,
167.26	not for myself, but I was afraid
170.26	that I was going to lose him,
172.26	that he was going to sink into one of his states,
174.26	and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin
177.26	if I started talking about scales
179.26	and arpeggios and other exciting forms of
181.26	didactic violin pedagogy.
183.26	(Laughter)
184.26	So, I just started playing.
187.26	And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
191.26	And as I played,
193.26	I understood that there was a profound change
196.26	occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.
198.26	It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,
201.26	a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music
205.26	was its catalyst.
208.26	And Nathaniel's manic rage
212.26	was transformed into understanding,
216.26	a quiet curiosity and grace.
221.26	And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin
224.26	and he started playing, by ear,
227.26	certain snippets of violin concertos
229.26	which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,
231.26	Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.
233.26	And we started talking about music, from Bach
235.26	to Beethoven and Brahms,
237.26	Bruckner, all the B's,
239.26	from Bart√≥k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
241.26	And I understood that he not only
243.26	had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,
245.26	but he related to this music at a personal level.
249.26	He spoke about it with the kind of passion
251.26	and understanding that I share with my colleagues
253.26	in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
256.26	And through playing music and talking about music,
259.26	this man had transformed
261.26	from the paranoid, disturbed man
264.26	that had just come from walking the streets
266.26	of downtown Los Angeles
268.26	to the charming, erudite,
270.26	brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.
274.26	Music is medicine. Music changes us.
279.26	And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.
283.26	Because music allows him to take his thoughts
285.26	and delusions and shape them
288.26	through his imagination and his creativity,
290.26	into reality.
292.26	And that is an escape
294.26	from his tormented state.
296.26	And I understood that this was the very essence of art.
299.26	This was the very reason why we made music,
301.26	that we take something that exists within all of us
303.26	at our very fundamental core,
305.26	our emotions,
307.26	and through our artistic lens,
309.26	through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.
314.26	And the reality of that expression
316.26	reaches all of us
318.26	and moves us, inspires and unites us.
323.26	And for Nathaniel,
325.26	music brought him back into a fold of friends.
328.26	The redemptive power of music brought him back
330.26	into a family of musicians
332.26	that understood him,
334.26	that recognized his talents
336.26	and respected him.
339.26	And I will always make music with Nathaniel,
342.26	whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall
344.26	or on Skid Row, because he reminds me
346.26	why I became a musician.
349.26	Thank you.
351.26	(Applause)
358.26	Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.
361.26	Robert Gupta.
363.26	(Applause)
382.26	Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.
385.26	So, please forgive me.
387.26	(Laughter)
388.26	(Music)
553.26	(Applause)
