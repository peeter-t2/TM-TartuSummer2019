15.773	Hello. My name is Jarrett Krosoczka,
18.526	and I write and illustrate books for children for a living.
22.992	So I use my imagination as my full-time job.
27.152	But well before my imagination was my vocation,
30.481	my imagination saved my life.
33.209	When I was a kid, I loved to draw,
35.696	and the most talented artist I knew
38.562	was my mother,
40.396	but my mother was addicted to heroin.
43.712	And when your parent is a drug addict,
47.157	it's kind of like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football,
50.496	because as much as you want to love on that person,
52.992	as much as you want to receive love from that person,
55.23	every time you open your heart, you end up on your back.
58.483	So throughout my childhood, my mother was incarcerated
62.703	and I didn't have my father because
64.129	I didn't even learn his first name until I was in the sixth grade.
67.789	But I had my grandparents,
70.109	my maternal grandparents Joseph and Shirley,
72.68	who adopted me just before my third birthday
75.962	and took me in as their own,
77.424	after they had already raised five children.
79.352	So two people who grew up in the Great Depression,
82.562	there in the very, very early '80s took on a new kid.
87.6	I was the Cousin Oliver of the sitcom
89.658	of the Krosoczka family,
91.764	the new kid who came out of nowhere.
94.345	And I would like to say that life was totally easy with them.
98.488	They each smoked two packs a day, each, nonfiltered,
101.581	and by the time I was six,
103.784	I could order a Southern Comfort Manhattan,
105.887	dry with a twist, rocks on the side,
108.04	the ice on the side so you could fit more liquor in the drink.
112.021	But they loved the hell out of me. They loved me so much.
115.36	And they supported my creative efforts,
117.72	because my grandfather was a self-made man.
120.209	He ran and worked in a factory.
121.929	My grandmother was a homemaker.
124.392	But here was this kid who loved Transformers
126.97	and Snoopy and the Ninja Turtles,
131.111	and the characters that I read about, I fell in love with,
135.912	and they became my friends.
138.987	So my best friends in life were the characters
141.289	I read about in books.
143.76	I went to Gates Lane Elementary School in Worcester, Massachusetts,
146.847	and I had wonderful teachers there,
149.543	most notably in first grade Mrs. Alisch.
152.944	And I just, I can just remember the love that she offered
156.703	us as her students.
159.45	When I was in the third grade,
162.349	a monumental event happened.
164.092	An author visited our school, Jack Gantos.
166.436	A published author of books came to talk to us
169.876	about what he did for a living.
172.374	And afterwards, we all went back to our classrooms
175.748	and we drew our own renditions of his main character,
178.322	Rotten Ralph.
179.771	And suddenly the author appeared in our doorway,
182.628	and I remember him sort of sauntering down the aisles,
185.58	going from kid to kid looking at the desks, not saying a word.
189.2	But he stopped next to my desk,
192.397	and he tapped on my desk, and he said,
194.897	"""Nice cat."" (Laughter)"
197.251	And he wandered away.
199.99	Two words that made a colossal difference in my life.
205.326	When I was in the third grade, I wrote a book for the first time,
208.165	"""The Owl Who Thought He Was The Best Flyer."" (Laughter)"
211.847	We had to write our own Greek myth,
214.132	our own creation story, so I wrote a story about an owl
216.975	who challenged Hermes to a flying race,
220.918	and the owl cheated,
223.029	and Hermes, being a Greek god, grew angry and bitter,
226.751	and turned the owl into a moon,
228.62	so the owl had to live the rest of his life as a moon
230.559	while he watched his family and friends play at night.
233.602	Yeah. (Laughter)
237.014	My book had a title page.
239.166	I was clearly worried about my intellectual property when I was eight.
243.468	(Laughter)
246.599	And it was a story that was told with words and pictures,
249.846	exactly what I do now for a living,
252.034	and I sometimes let the words have the stage on their own,
255.721	and sometimes I allowed the pictures to work on their own
258.791	to tell the story.
261.026	"My favorite page is the ""About the author"" page."
264.372	(Laughter)
266.611	So I learned to write about myself in third person
269.454	at a young age.
272.574	"So I love that last sentence: ""He liked making this book."""
276.098	And I liked making that book because I loved using my imagination,
280.029	and that's what writing is.
281.214	Writing is using your imagination on paper,
283.729	and I do get so scared because I travel to so many schools now
286.7	and that seems like such a foreign concept to kids,
289.757	that writing would be using your imagination on paper,
293.571	if they're allowed to even write now within the school hours.
297.65	So I loved writing so much that I'd come home from school,
299.838	and I would take out pieces of paper,
302.333	and I would staple them together,
304.254	and I would fill those blank pages with words and pictures
307.094	just because I loved using my imagination.
310.77	And so these characters would become my friends.
312.882	There was an egg, a tomato, a head of lettuce and a pumpkin,
315.942	and they all lived in this refrigerator city,
318.416	and in one of their adventures they went to a haunted house
321.238	that was filled with so many dangers
322.641	like an evil blender who tried to chop them up,
327.325	an evil toaster who tried to kidnap the bread couple,
333.267	and an evil microwave who tried to melt their friend
335.622	who was a stick of butter. (Laughter)
339.019	And I'd make my own comics too,
341.222	and this was another way for me to tell stories,
343.359	through words and through pictures.
346.59	Now when I was in sixth grade,
348.374	the public funding all but eliminated the arts budgets
351.23	in the Worcester public school system.
353.274	I went from having art once a week
356.658	to twice a month
358.255	to once a month to not at all.
361.101	And my grandfather, he was a wise man,
362.973	and he saw that as a problem, because he knew
364.808	that was, like, the one thing I had. I didn't play sports.
368.388	I had art.
371.17	So he walked into my room one evening,
373.628	and he sat on the edge of my bed,
375.173	"and he said, ""Jarrett, it's up to you, but if you'd like to,"
377.412	"we'd like to send you to the classes at the Worcester Art Museum."""
379.901	And I was so thrilled.
381.498	So from sixth through 12th grade,
383.168	once, twice, sometimes three times a week,
385.169	I would take classes at the art museum,
386.888	and I was surrounded by other kids who loved to draw,
389.92	other kids who shared a similar passion.
393.324	Now my publishing career began when I designed the cover
396.283	for my eighth grade yearbook,
398.894	and if you're wondering about the style of dress I put our mascot in,
402.161	I was really into Bell Biv DeVoe and MC Hammer
404.769	and Vanilla Ice at the time. (Laughter)
408.63	"And to this day, I still can do karaoke to ""Ice, Ice Baby"""
412.523	without looking at the screen.
415.066	Don't tempt me, because I will do it.
418.576	So I get shipped off to private school,
420.498	K through eight, public schools, but for some reason
422.721	my grandfather was upset that somebody
425.096	at the local high school had been stabbed and killed,
427.457	so he didn't want me to go there.
430.153	He wanted me to go to a private school, and he gave me an option.
432.964	You can go to Holy Name, which is coed,
434.7	or St. John's, which is all boys.
437.073	Very wise man, because he knew I would,
439.273	I felt like I was making the decision on my own,
442.009	and he knew I wouldn't choose St. John's,
443.805	so I went to Holy Name High School,
445.503	which was a tough transition because, like I said,
448.271	I didn't play sports,
449.831	and it was very focused on sports,
452.312	but I took solace in Mr. Shilale's art room.
456.476	And I just flourished here.
458.974	I just couldn't wait to get to that classroom every day.
462.133	So how did I make friends?
464.42	I drew funny pictures of my teachers -- (Laughter) --
468.653	and I passed them around.
471.41	Well, in English class, in ninth grade,
475.208	my friend John, who was sitting next to me,
477.184	laughed a little bit too hard.
479.899	Mr. Greenwood was not pleased.
482.18	(Laughter)
486.087	He instantly saw that I was the cause of the commotion,
489.472	and for the first time in my life, I was sent to the hall,
493.487	"and I thought, ""Oh no, I'm doomed."
495.669	"My grandfather's just going to kill me."""
498.874	And he came out to the hallway and he said,
500.435	"""Let me see the paper."""
501.553	"And I thought, ""Oh no. He thinks it's a note."""
506.617	And so I took this picture, and I handed it to him.
509.453	And we sat in silence for that brief moment,
512.666	and he said to me,
514.814	"""You're really talented."" (Laughter)"
518.177	"""You're really good. You know, the school newspaper"
520.866	needs a new cartoonist, and you should be the cartoonist.
523.249	"Just stop drawing in my class."""
526.875	So my parents never found out about it.
529.209	I didn't get in trouble. I was introduced to Mrs. Casey,
532.435	who ran the school newspaper,
534.099	and I was for three and a half years
538.671	the cartoonist for my school paper,
541.047	handling such heavy issues as,
543.219	seniors are mean,
546.327	freshmen are nerds,
548.923	the prom bill is so expensive. I can't believe how much it costs to go to the prom.
554.728	And I took the headmaster to task
558.312	and then I also wrote an ongoing story about a boy named Wesley
562.175	who was unlucky in love, and I just swore up and down
565.421	that this wasn't about me,
567.537	but all these years later it was totally me.
571.339	But it was so cool because I could write these stories,
573.467	I could come up with these ideas,
574.645	and they'd be published in the school paper,
576.948	and people who I didn't know could read them.
579.558	And I loved that thought, of being able to share my ideas
582.613	through the printed page.
584.958	On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother
588.139	gave me the best birthday present ever:
590.384	a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.
595.303	Here I am, 20 years later,
596.559	and I still work on this table every day.
601.103	On the evening of my 14th birthday,
603.513	I was given this table, and we had Chinese food.
607.678	And this was my fortune:
611.298	"""You will be successful in your work."""
613.575	I taped it to the top left hand of my table,
616.403	and as you can see, it's still there.
618.362	Now I never really asked my grandparents for anything.
622.263	Well, two things: Rusty, who was a great hamster
624.607	and lived a great long life when I was in fourth grade.
628.743	(Laughter)
631.562	And a video camera.
634.759	I just wanted a video camera.
636.999	And after begging and pleading for Christmas,
639.48	I got a second-hand video camera,
641.911	and I instantly started making my own animations
645.743	on my own,
647.943	and all throughout high school I made my own animations.
650.623	I convinced my 10th grade English teacher to allow me
653.72	"to do my book report on Stephen King's ""Misery"""
656.047	as an animated short. (Laughter)
660.811	And I kept making comics.
663.667	I kept making comics, and at the Worcester Art Museum,
667.611	I was given the greatest piece of advice by any educator I was ever given.
671.844	Mark Lynch, he's an amazing teacher
674.733	and he's still a dear friend of mine,
676.948	and I was 14 or 15,
679.355	and I walked into his comic book class halfway through the course,
682.376	and I was so excited, I was beaming.
684.19	I had this book that was how to draw comics in the Marvel way,
687.491	and it taught me how to draw superheroes,
689.796	how to draw a woman, how to draw muscles
692.124	just the way they were supposed to be
694.05	if I were to ever draw for X-Men or Spiderman.
696.875	And all the color just drained from his face,
699.767	and he looked at me, and he said,
701.506	"""Forget everything you learned."""
704.276	"And I didn't understand. He said, ""You have a great style."
708.1	Celebrate your own style. Don't draw the way you're being told to draw.
712.262	Draw the way you're drawing and keep at it,
714.42	"because you're really good."""
716.869	Now when I was a teenager, I was angsty as any teenager was,
720.443	but after 17 years of having a mother
723.956	who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo
726.118	and a father who was faceless, I was angry.
730.019	And when I was 17, I met my father for the first time,
732.741	upon which I learned I had a brother and sister I had never known about.
736.642	And on the day I met my father for the first time,
738.562	I was rejected from the Rhode Island School of Design,
741.326	my one and only choice for college.
745.077	But it was around this time I went to Camp Sunshine
747.469	to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids,
749.969	kids with leukemia, and this kid Eric changed my life.
753.041	Eric didn't live to see his sixth birthday,
755.606	and Eric lives with me every day.
758.171	So after this experience, my art teacher, Mr. Shilale,
761.86	he brought in these picture books,
763.052	"and I thought, ""Picture books for kids!"""
764.902	and I started writing books for young readers
769.97	when I was a senior in high school.
771.699	Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.
774.487	I transferred to RISD as a sophomore,
776.591	and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing,
780.222	and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug
784.255	who wanted to be friends with this kid.
785.907	The kid had no patience for him.
787.416	And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers
790.655	and it was rejected every single time,
793.199	but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp,
795.952	an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses,
798.937	and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories,
802.185	and I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.
805.952	I graduated from RISD. My grandparents were very proud,
809.688	and I moved to Boston, and I set up shop.
812.306	I set up a studio and I tried to get published.
814.481	I would send out my books. I would send out hundreds of postcards
817.522	to editors and art directors,
819.919	but they would go unanswered.
821.559	And my grandfather would call me every week,
823.414	"and he would say, ""Jarrett, how's it going? Do you have a job yet?"""
827.745	Because he had just invested a significant amount of money
830.009	in my college education.
831.93	"And I said, ""Yes, I have a job. I write and illustrate children's books."""
835.785	"And he said, ""Well, who pays you for that?"""
839.303	"And I said, ""No one, no one, no one just yet."
841.269	"But I know it's going to happen."""
842.429	Now, I used to work the weekends at the Hole in the Wall off-season programming
845.922	to make some extra money as I was trying to get my feet off the ground,
849.105	and this kid who was just this really hyper kid,
852.857	"I started calling him ""Monkey Boy,"""
855.729	"and I went home and wrote a book called ""Good Night, Monkey Boy."""
859.41	And I sent out one last batch of postcards.
862.692	And I received an email from an editor at Random House
866.066	"with a subject line, ""Nice work!"" Exclamation point."
869.817	"""Dear Jarrett, I received your postcard."
871.605	I liked your art, so I went to your website
874.368	and I'm wondering if you ever tried writing any of your own stories,
878.329	because I really like your art and it looks like there are some stories that go with them.
880.995	"Please let me know if you're ever in New York City."""
885.066	And this was from an editor at Random House Children's Books.
888.368	"So the next week I ""happened"" to be in New York."
890.704	(Laughter)
893.648	And I met with this editor,
895.96	and I left New York for a contract for my first book,
899.184	"""Good Night, Monkey Boy,"""
900.217	which was published on June 12, 2001.
903.679	And my local paper celebrated the news.
909.374	The local bookstore made a big deal of it.
913.639	They sold out of all of their books.
915.528	My friend described it as a wake, but happy,
919.305	because everyone I ever knew was there in line to see me,
921.882	but I wasn't dead. I was just signing books.
924.906	My grandparents, they were in the middle of it.
926.453	They were so happy. They couldn't have been more proud.
929.042	Mrs. Alisch was there. Mr. Shilale was there. Mrs. Casey was there.
932.794	Mrs. Alisch cut in front of the line and said,
934.233	"""I taught him how to read."" (Laughter)"
937.49	And then something happened that changed my life.
940.034	I got my first piece of significant fan mail,
942.25	where this kid loved Monkey Boy so much
945.525	that he wanted to have a Monkey Boy birthday cake.
949.121	For a two-year-old, that is like a tattoo. (Laughter)
953.508	You know? You only get one birthday per year.
956.569	And for him, it's only his second.
959.414	And I got this picture, and I thought,
960.42	"""This picture is going to live within his consciousness"
962.462	for his entire life. He will forever have this photo
966.138	"in his family photo albums."""
969.094	So that photo, since that moment,
971.762	is framed in front of me while I've worked on all of my books.
974.809	I have 10 picture books out.
977.369	"""Punk Farm,"" ""Baghead,"" ""Ollie the Purple Elephant."""
980.769	I just finished the ninth book
983.053	"in the ""Lunch Lady"" series, which is a graphic novel series"
985.546	about a lunch lady who fights crime.
988.13	I'm expecting the release of a chapter book
990.946	"called ""Platypus Police Squad: The Frog Who Croaked."""
994.626	And I travel the country visiting countless schools,
998.196	letting lots of kids know that they draw great cats.
1002.706	And I meet Bagheads.
1005.234	Lunch ladies treat me really well.
1009.805	And I got to see my name in lights
1014.329	because kids put my name in lights.
1016.179	"Twice now, the ""Lunch Lady"" series has won"
1018.269	the Children's Choice Book of the Year in the third or fourth grade category,
1021.25	and those winners were displayed
1023.22	on a jumbotron screen in Times Square.
1027.48	"""Punk Farm"" and ""Lunch Lady"" are in development to be movies,"
1030.204	so I am a movie producer
1032.778	and I really do think, thanks to that video camera
1035.511	I was given in ninth grade.
1038.075	"I've seen people have ""Punk Farm"" birthday parties,"
1040.845	"people have dressed up as ""Punk Farm"" for Halloween,"
1043.732	"a ""Punk Farm"" baby room,"
1045.361	which makes me a little nervous for the child's well-being in the long term.
1050.176	And I get the most amazing fan mail,
1052.647	and I get the most amazing projects,
1055.055	and the biggest moment for me came last Halloween.
1058.407	The doorbell rang and it was a trick-or-treater
1060.561	dressed as my character. It was so cool.
1064.718	Now my grandparents are no longer living,
1067.832	so to honor them, I started a scholarship at the Worcester Art Museum
1070.896	for kids who are in difficult situations
1074.171	but whose caretakers can't afford the classes.
1076.879	And it displayed the work from my first 10 years of publishing,
1079.47	and you know who was there to celebrate? Mrs. Alisch.
1082.566	"I said, ""Mrs. Alisch, how are you?"""
1084.253	"And she responded with, ""I'm here."" (Laughter)"
1087.359	That's true. You are alive, and that's pretty good right now.
1093.973	So the biggest moment for me, though,
1095.649	my most important job now is I am a dad myself,
1097.635	and I have two beautiful daughters,
1099.983	and my goal is to surround them by inspiration,
1102.774	by the books that are in every single room of our house
1105.896	to the murals I painted in their rooms
1108.486	to the moments for creativity where you find, in quiet times,
1112.125	by making faces on the patio
1115.61	to letting her sit in the very desk
1117.934	that I've sat in for the past 20 years.
1120.622	Thank you. (Applause)
