13.48	Strap yourselves in,
15.4	we're going to Mars.
17.4	Not just a few astronauts --
19.52	thousands of people
19.52	are going to colonize Mars.
22.68	And I am telling you
22.68	that they're going to do this soon.
26.64	Some of you will end up
26.64	working on projects on Mars,
29.56	and I guarantee that some
29.56	of your children will end up living there.
33.76	That probably sounds preposterous,
36.16	so I'm going to share with you
36.16	how and when that will happen.
39.76	But first I want to discuss
39.76	the obvious question:
43	Why the heck should we do this?
46.88	I gave a TED talk on 10 ways
46.88	the world could end suddenly.
50.72	We are incredibly vulnerable
50.72	to the whims of our own galaxy.
55.52	A single, large asteroid
55.52	could take us out forever.
59.12	To survive we have to reach
59.12	beyond the home planet.
62.6	Think what a tragedy it would be
64.84	if all that humans have accomplished
64.84	were suddenly obliterated.
68.72	And there's another reason we should go:
70.76	exploration is in our DNA.
73.72	Two million years ago
73.72	humans evolved in Africa
77.2	and then slowly but surely
77.2	spread out across the entire planet
82.04	by reaching into the wilderness
82.04	that was beyond their horizons.
85.56	This stuff is inside us.
87.84	And they prospered doing that.
90.24	Some of the greatest advances
90.24	in civilization and technology
94.16	came because we explored.
97.08	Yes, we could do a lot of good
98.56	with the money it will take
98.56	to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
102.88	And yes we should all be taking
102.88	far better care of our own home planet.
108.12	And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars
108.12	the way we've screwed up Earth.
114.32	But think for a moment,
115.96	what we had when John F. Kennedy
115.96	told us we would put a human on the moon.
120.92	He excited an entire generation to dream.
125.4	Think how inspired we will be
125.4	to see a landing on Mars.
128.36	Perhaps then we will look back at Earth
131.12	and see that that is
131.12	one people instead of many
134.52	and perhaps then
134.52	we will look back at Earth,
137.08	as we struggle to survive on Mars,
139.52	and realize how precious
139.52	the home planet is.
143.52	So let me tell you about the extraordinary
143.52	adventure we're about to undertake.
149.04	But first,
150.32	a few fascinating facts
150.32	about where we're going.
154.04	This picture actually represents
154.04	the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
158.44	Mars is not our sister planet.
160.36	It's far less than half
160.36	the size of the Earth,
163.16	and yet despite the fact
163.16	that it's smaller,
165.2	the surface area of Mars
165.2	that you can stand on
167.92	is equivalent to the surface area
167.92	of the Earth that you can stand on,
171.88	because the Earth
171.88	is mostly covered by water.
175	The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --
179.92	and it's not breathable,
179.92	it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
184.76	It's really cold there.
186.4	The average temperature
186.4	is minus 81 degrees,
189.4	although there is
189.4	quite a range of temperature.
193.32	A day on Mars is about as long
193.32	as a day on Earth,
195.92	plus about 39 minutes.
198.44	Seasons and years on Mars
198.44	are twice as long as they are on Earth.
204	And for anybody who wants to strap
204	on some wings and go flying one day,
208.68	Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,
211.52	and it's the kind of place
212.8	where you can jump over your car
212.8	instead of walk around it.
216.12	Now, as you can see,
216.12	Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,
219.8	but it's by far the most livable
219.8	other place in our entire solar system.
225.36	Here's the problem.
226.88	Mars is a long way away,
229.08	a thousand times farther away
229.08	from us than our own moon.
234.56	The Moon is 250,000 miles away
238.36	and it took Apollo astronauts
238.36	three days to get there.
242.72	Mars is 250 million miles away
245.88	and it will take us
245.88	eight months to get there --
250.08	And that's only if we launch
250.08	on a very specific day,
252.68	at a very specific time,
254.44	once every two years,
256.44	when Mars and the Earth
256.44	are aligned just so,
259.64	so the distance that the rocket
259.64	would have to travel will be the shortest.
	trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
270.8	And meanwhile, our track record
270.8	of getting to Mars is lousy.
274.88	We and the Russians,
274.88	the Europeans, the Japanese,
277.72	the Chinese and the Indians,
279.08	have actually sent 44 rockets there,
281.68	and the vast majority of them
281.68	have either missed or crashed.
285.24	Only about a third of the missions
285.24	to Mars have been successful.
289.76	And we don't at the moment have
289.76	a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
295.08	We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.
297.2	A couple of Saturn Vs
297.2	would have gotten us there.
299.84	It was the most magnificent
299.84	machine ever built by humans,
303.32	and it was the rocket
303.32	that took us to the Moon.
306.12	But the last Saturn V was used in 1973
306.12	to launch the Skylab space station,
311.16	and we decided to do
311.16	something called the shuttle
314.28	instead of continuing on to Mars
314.28	after we landed on the Moon.
318.68	The biggest rocket we have now
320.16	is only half big enough
320.16	to get us anything to Mars.
324.2	So getting to Mars is not going to be easy
327.24	and that brings up
327.24	a really interesting question ...
331.56	how soon will the first humans
331.56	actually land here?
337.16	Now, some pundits think
337.16	if we got there by 2050,
341.52	that'd be a pretty good achievement.
343.84	These days, NASA seems to be saying
343.84	that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.
350.28	Maybe they can.
352.6	I believe that they can get
352.6	human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
357.72	But frankly,
359	I don't think they're going to bother
359	in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,
363.76	because we will already be there.
365.76	We're going to land on Mars in 2027.
370.28	And the reason is
371.52	this man is determined
371.52	to make that happen.
373.6	His name is Elon Musk,
373.6	he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
379.92	Now, he actually told me
379.92	that we would land on Mars by 2025,
385	but Elon Musk is more
385	optimistic than I am --
387.92	and that's going a ways --
389.44	so I'm giving him
389.44	a couple of years of slack.
392.96	Still ...
394.4	you've got to ask yourself,
395.76	can this guy really do this
395.76	by 2025 or 2027?
400.76	Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk
400.76	into a little perspective.
405.2	Where was this 10 years ago?
407.36	That's the Tesla electric automobile.
409.64	In 2005, a lot of people
409.64	in the automobile industry were saying,
413.32	we would not have
413.32	a decent electric car for 50 years.
420.28	And where was that?
422.12	That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,
425.32	lifting six tons of supplies
425.32	to the International Space Station.
430.96	SpaceX had not launched anything,
430.96	or fired a rocket to anywhere.
436.6	So I think it's a pretty good bet
439.16	that the person who is revolutionizing
439.16	the automobile industry
442.24	in less than 10 years
443.48	and the person who created an entire
443.48	rocket company in less than 10 years
449.32	will get us to Mars by 2027.
452.76	Now, you need to know this:
455.76	governments and robots
455.76	no longer control this game.
460.04	Private companies are leaping into space
462.44	and they will be happy
462.44	to take you to Mars.
465.8	And that raises a really big question.
469.4	Can we actually live there?
472.68	Now, NASA may not be able
472.68	to get us there until 2040,
476.88	or we may get there
476.88	a long time before NASA,
479	but NASA has taken a huge responsibility
479	in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
484.88	Let's look at the problem this way.
486.92	Here's what you need to live on Earth:
488.8	food, water, shelter and clothing.
492.24	And here's what you need to live on Mars:
494.76	all of the above, plus oxygen.
498.16	So let's look at the most
498.16	important thing on this list first.
502.28	Water is the basis
502.28	of all life as we know it,
505.32	and it's far too heavy for us to carry
505.32	water from the Earth to Mars to live,
509.92	so we have to find water
509.92	if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
515.84	And if you look at Mars,
515.84	it looks really dry,
518.36	it looks like the entire
518.36	planet is a desert.
521.2	But it turns out that it's not.
523.24	The soil alone on Mars
523.24	contains up to 60 percent water.
528.48	And a number of orbiters that we still
528.48	have flying around Mars have shown us --
533.44	and by the way,
533.44	that's a real photograph --
536	that lots of craters on Mars
536	have a sheet of water ice in them.
540.16	It's not a bad place to start a colony.
543.855	Now, here's a view of a little dig
543.855	the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,
548.04	showing that just below
548.04	the surface of the soil is ice --
551.6	that white stuff is ice.
553.88	In the second picture,
555.16	which is four days later
555.16	than the first picture,
557.44	you can see that
557.44	some of it is evaporating.
560.04	Orbiters also tell us
561.44	that there are huge amounts
561.44	of underground water on Mars
564.88	as well as glaciers.
566.96	In fact, if only the water ice
566.96	at the poles on Mars melted,
571.24	most of the planet
571.24	would be under 30 feet of water.
574.96	So there's plenty of water there,
577.08	but most of it's ice,
577.08	most of it's underground,
579.64	it takes a lot of energy to get it
579.64	and a lot of human labor.
584.04	This is a device cooked up
584.04	at the University of Washington
586.8	back in 1998.
588.84	It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
591.92	And it turns out the Mars atmosphere
591.92	is often 100 percent humid.
596	So this device can extract
596	all the water that humans will need
600.4	simply from the atmosphere on Mars.
604.16	Next we have to worry
604.16	about what we will breathe.
607.16	Frankly, I was really shocked
609.08	to find out that NASA
609.08	has this problem worked out.
612.28	This is a scientist at MIT
612.28	named Michael Hecht.
616.12	And he's developed this machine, Moxie.
618.64	I love this thing.
619.88	It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,
622.48	that sucks in the Martian atmosphere
622.48	and pumps out oxygen.
626.28	And you have to remember that CO2 --
628.28	carbon dioxide, which is
632.16	CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
635.92	Now, the next big rover
635.92	that NASA sends to Mars in 2020
640.28	is going to have one
640.28	of these devices aboard,
642.52	and it will be able
642.52	to produce enough oxygen
645.24	to keep one person alive indefinitely.
647.96	But the secret to this --
650.12	and that's just for testing --
651.84	the secret to this is that this thing
651.84	was designed from the get-go
655.16	to be scalable by a factor of 100.
658.84	Next, what will we eat?
661.08	Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,
664.04	but we're not going to be able to grow
665.92	more than 15 to 20 percent
665.92	of our food there,
668.08	at least not until water is running
668.08	on the surface of Mars
671.6	and we actually have the probability
671.6	and the capability of planting crops.
676.68	In the meantime,
677.96	most of our food will arrive from Earth,
680.08	and it will be dried.
682.48	And then we need some shelter.
685.12	At first we can use inflatable,
685.12	pressurized buildings
688.76	as well as the landers themselves.
691.04	But this really only works
691.04	during the daytime.
694.04	There is too much solar radiation
694.04	and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
699.16	So we really have to go underground.
701.36	Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
704.08	by and large,
704.08	is perfect for making bricks.
707.08	And NASA has figured this one out, too.
709.32	They're going to throw
709.32	some polymer plastic into the bricks,
712.2	shove them in a microwave oven,
714	and then you will be able to build
714	buildings with really thick walls.
717.28	Or we may choose to live underground
717.28	in caves or in lava tubes,
723.28	of which there are plenty.
726.04	And finally there's clothing.
728.12	On Earth we have miles
728.12	of atmosphere piled up on us,
731.36	which creates 15 pounds of pressure
731.36	on our bodies at all times,
734.68	and we're constantly
734.68	pushing out against that.
736.847	On Mars there's hardly
736.847	any atmospheric pressure.
740.72	So Dava Newman,
742.64	a scientist at MIT,
744.12	has created this sleek space suit.
747.2	It will keep us together,
748.72	block radiation and keep us warm.
752.16	So let's think about this for a minute.
754.08	Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...
757.96	we can do this.
759.6	We really can.
761.72	But it's still a little complicated
761.72	and a little difficult.
765.8	So that leads to the next big --
768.64	really big step --
770.24	in living the good life on Mars.
772.08	And that's terraforming the planet:
774.6	making it more like Earth,
776.48	reengineering an entire planet.
780.16	That sounds like a lot of hubris,
782.04	but the truth is
783.28	that the technology to do everything
783.28	I'm about to tell you already exists.
788.2	First we've got to warm it up.
790.4	Mars is incredibly cold
790.4	because it has a very thin atmosphere.
795.12	The answer lies here, at the south pole
795.12	and at the north pole of Mars,
799.48	both of which are covered
800.76	with an incredible amount
800.76	of frozen carbon dioxide --
803.96	dry ice.
805.44	If we heat it up,
806.8	it sublimes directly into the atmosphere
809.4	and thickens the atmosphere
809.4	the same way it does on Earth.
812.24	And as we know,
813.48	CO2 is an incredibly
813.48	potent greenhouse gas.
817.84	Now, my favorite way of doing this
817.84	is to erect a very, very large solar sail
823.8	and focus it --
825.04	it essentially serves as a mirror --
826.8	and focus it on the south pole
826.8	of Mars at first.
829.2	As the planet spins, it will heat up
829.2	all that dry ice, sublime it,
833.24	and it will go into the atmosphere.
835.52	It actually won't take long
837.04	for the temperature
837.04	on Mars to start rising,
839.32	probably less than 20 years.
842.56	Right now,
843.8	on a perfect day at the equator,
845.8	in the middle of summer on Mars,
847.92	temperatures can
847.92	actually reach 70 degrees,
850.4	but then they go down
850.4	to minus 100 at night.
852.84	(Laughter)
854.44	What we're shooting for
854.44	is a runaway greenhouse effect:
858.8	enough temperature rise
858.8	to see a lot of that ice on Mars --
862.64	especially the ice in the ground -- melt.
866	Then we get some real magic.
868	As the atmosphere gets thicker,
868	everything gets better.
871.2	We get more protection from radiation,
873.84	more atmosphere makes us warmer,
873.84	makes the planet warmer,
876.96	so we get running water
878.68	and that makes crops possible.
880.92	Then more water vapor goes into the air,
880.92	forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
885.92	It will rain and it will snow on Mars.
890.16	And a thicker atmosphere
890.16	will create enough pressure
893.44	so that we can
893.44	throw away those space suits.
896	We only need about five pounds
896	of pressure to survive.
899.4	Eventually, Mars will be made
899.4	to feel a lot like British Columbia.
906.04	We'll still be left
906.04	with the complicated problem
908.4	of making the atmosphere breathable,
910.16	and frankly that could take
910.16	1,000 years to accomplish.
913.8	But humans are amazingly smart
913.8	and incredibly adaptable.
917.96	There is no telling what our future
917.96	technology will be able to accomplish
922.96	and no telling what we can do
922.96	with our own bodies.
925.75	In biology right now,
928.28	we are on the very verge of being
928.28	able to control our own genetics,
933.52	what the genes
933.52	in our own bodies are doing,
936.08	and certainly,
938.24	eventually, our own evolution.
940.92	We could end up with a species
940.92	of human being on Earth
944.56	that is slightly different
944.56	from the species of human beings on Mars.
950.28	But what would you do there?
950.28	How would you live?
952.56	It's going to be
952.56	the same as it is on Earth.
955.56	Somebody's going to start a restaurant,
957.84	somebody's going to build an iron foundry.
960.8	Someone will make
960.8	documentary movies of Mars
963.08	and sell them on Earth.
966.56	Some idiot will start a reality TV show.
969.6	(Laughter)
971.68	There will be software companies,
973.96	there will be hotels, there will be bars.
977.76	This much is certain:
979.2	it will be the most disruptive
979.2	event in our lifetimes,
983.44	and I think it will be the most inspiring.
986.8	Ask any 10-year-old girl
986.8	if she wants to go to Mars.
990.88	Children who are now in elementary school
990.88	are going to choose to live there.
996.28	Remember when we landed
996.28	humans on the Moon?
999.32	When that happened,
999.32	people looked at each other and said,
1002.12	"""If we can do this, we can do anything."""
1005.76	What are they going to think
1005.76	when we actually form a colony on Mars?
1010.92	Most importantly,
1012.32	it will make us a spacefaring species.
1015.72	And that means humans will survive
1015.72	no matter what happens on Earth.
1021.2	We will never be the last of our kind.
1024.32	Thank you.
1025.56	(Applause)
