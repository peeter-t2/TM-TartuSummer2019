12.771	When we're designing new products,
15.042	services or businesses,
17.056	the only time you'll know
17.056	if they're any good,
19.598	if the designs are good,
21.32	is to see how they're used
21.32	in the real world, in context.
26.761	I'm reminded of that every time
26.761	I walk past Highbury Fields
30.719	in north London.
32.183	It's absolutely beautiful.
33.525	There's a big open green space.
35.246	There's Georgian buildings
35.246	around the side.
37.838	But then there's this mud trap
37.838	that cuts across the middle.
41.72	People clearly don't want to walk
41.72	all the way around the edge.
45.196	Instead, they want to take the shortcut,
47.356	and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.
50.866	Now, this shortcut
50.866	is called a desire path,
54.186	and it's often the path
54.186	of least resistance.
56.71	I find them fascinating,
58.067	because they're often the point
58.067	where design and user experience diverge.
64.164	Now at this point, I should apologize,
66.041	because you guys are going to start
66.041	seeing these everywhere.
68.937	But today, I'm going to pick
68.937	three I find interesting
71.623	and share what actually it reminds me
73.758	about launching new products and services.
77.137	The first is in the capital city
77.137	of Brazil -- Brasilia.
81.203	And it reminds me that sometimes,
83.365	you have to just focus
83.365	on designing for a real need
86.517	at low friction.
88.251	Now, Brasilia is fascinating.
89.788	It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.
92.954	It was the golden age of flying,
95.186	so he laid it out like a plane,
95.186	as you can see there.
98.474	Slightly worryingly,
99.663	he put most of the important
99.663	government buildings in the cockpit.
103.435	But if you zoom in,
103.435	in the very center of Brasilia,
105.906	just where the point is there,
108.092	you see it's littered with desire paths.
110.973	They're absolutely everywhere.
113.07	Now, they thought that they
113.07	had future-proofed this design.
115.964	They thought in the future
115.964	we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --
119.003	we'd be able to drive --
120.575	so there was little need
120.575	for walkways or pavements.
124.358	But as you can see, there's a real need.
127.564	These are very dangerous desire paths.
129.41	If we just pick one, in the middle,
131.471	you can see it crosses
134.902	It won't surprise you guys
136.682	that Brasilia has five times
136.682	the pedestrian accident rate
140.246	of your average US city.
142.968	People are resourceful.
144.479	They'll always find the low-friction route
147.537	to save money, save time.
150.493	Not all these desire paths are dangerous,
152.5	I was reminded flying here
152.5	when I was in Heathrow.
155.917	Many of us get frustrated
155.917	when we're confronted
158.461	with the obligatory walk
158.461	through duty-free.
163.024	It was amazing to me
164.199	how many people refused to take
164.199	the long, meandering path to the left,
168.358	and just cut through to the right,
170.459	cut through the desire path.
172.813	The question that's interesting is:
174.545	What do designers think
174.545	when they see our behavior here?
178.198	Do they think we're stupid?
180.013	Do they think we're lazy?
182.405	Or do they accept
182.405	that this is the only truth?
184.981	This is their product.
187.134	We're effectively
187.134	co-designing their product.
190.54	So our job is to design
190.54	for real needs at low friction,
195.49	because if you don't,
195.49	the customer will, anyway.
199.238	The second desire path I wanted to share
201.482	is at the University of California.
203.758	And it reminds me
204.934	that sometimes the best way
204.934	to come up with a great design
208.116	is just to launch it.
210.864	Now, university campuses are fantastic
210.864	for spotting desire paths.
214.762	I think it's because students
214.762	are always late and they're pretty smart.
218.124	So they're dashing to lectures.
219.63	They'll always find the shortcut.
222.436	And the designers here knew that.
224.53	So they built the buildings
226.527	and then they waited a few months
226.527	for the paths to form.
229.83	They then paved them.
231.378	(Laughter)
232.441	Incredibly smart approach.
234.719	In fact, often, just launching
234.719	the straw man of a service
237.866	can teach you what people really want.
240.667	For example, Ayr Muir in Boston
240.667	knew he wanted to open a restaurant.
244.885	But where should it be?
246.675	What should the menu be?
248.661	He launched a service,
250.174	in this case a food truck,
251.884	and he changed the location each day.
254.283	He'd write a different menu
254.283	on the side in a whiteboard marker
257.851	to figure out what people wanted.
260.218	He now has a chain of restaurants.
262.661	So it can be incredibly efficient
264.716	to launch something
264.716	to spot the desire paths.
268.232	The third and final desire path
268.232	I wanted to share with you
271.338	is the UNIH.
273.594	It reminds me that the world's in flux,
275.907	and we have to respond to those changes.
278.77	So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.
281.337	I've marked for you on the left
281.337	the Oncology Department.
284.735	The patients would usually stay
284.735	in the hotels down on the bottom right.
290.03	This was a patient-centered organization,
292.267	so they laid on cars for their patients.
295.871	But what they realized when they started
295.871	offering chemotherapy
299.287	is the patients rarely
299.287	wanted to get in cars.
302.088	They were too nauseous,
302.088	so they'd walk back to their hotels.
306.014	This desire path that you see
306.014	diagonally, formed.
309.616	The patients even called it
309.616	"""The Chemo Trail."""
312.93	Now, when the hospital
312.93	saw this originally,
315.023	they tried to lay turf
315.023	back over it, ignore it.
318.744	But after a while, they realized
318.744	it was an important need
321.884	they were meeting for their patients,
323.685	so they paved it.
325.017	And I think our job is often
325.017	to pave these emerging desire paths.
328.89	If we look back at the one
328.89	in North London again,
332.04	that desire path hasn't always been there.
334.856	The reason it sprung up
336.396	is people were traveling to the mighty
336.396	Arsenal Football Club stadium
340.518	on game days,
341.693	from the Underground station
341.693	you see on the bottom right.
344.805	So you see the desire path.
346.128	If we just wind the clock
346.128	back a few years,
348.966	when the stadium was being constructed,
351.187	there is no desire path.
353.797	So our job is to watch
353.797	for these desire paths emerging,
358.567	and, where appropriate, pave them,
360.975	as someone did here.
363.191	Someone installed a barrier,
366.076	people started walking across
366.076	and round the bottom as you see,
369.32	and they paved it.
370.542	(Laughter)
372.146	But I think this is a wonderful
372.146	reminder as well,
374.558	that, actually, the world is in flux.
376.434	It's constantly changing,
377.68	because if you look
377.68	at the top of this image,
379.936	there's another desire path forming.
383.413	So these three desire paths remind me
385.967	we need to design for real human needs.
389.579	I think empathy for what
389.579	your customers want
392.086	is probably the biggest leading indicator
392.086	of business success.
396.315	Design for real needs
398.013	and design them in low friction,
401.155	because if you don't offer them
401.155	in low friction,
403.814	someone else will, often the customer.
406.875	Secondly, often the best way
406.875	to learn what people really want
411.059	is to launch your service.
412.947	The answer is rarely inside the building.
415.751	Get out there and see
415.751	what people really want.
418.706	And finally, in part
418.706	because of technology,
421.173	the world is incredibly flux
421.173	at the moment.
424.01	It's changing constantly.
425.993	These desire paths are going
425.993	to spring up faster than ever.
429.73	Our job is to pick the appropriate ones
432.701	and pave over them.
434.572	Thank you very much.
435.747	(Applause)
