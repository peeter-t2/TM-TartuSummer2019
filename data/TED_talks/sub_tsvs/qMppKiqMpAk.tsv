12.76	So when you look out
12.76	at the stars at night,
15.76	it's amazing what you can see.
17.24	It's beautiful.
18.72	But what's more amazing
18.72	is what you can't see,
21.84	because what we know now
23.24	is that around every star
23.24	or almost every star,
26.64	there's a planet,
27.92	or probably a few.
30.12	So what this picture isn't showing you
32.24	are all the planets that we know about
34.4	out there in space.
36.28	But when we think about planets,
36.28	we tend to think of faraway things
39.52	that are very different from our own.
41.4	But here we are on a planet,
43.84	and there are so many things
43.84	that are amazing about Earth
47.16	that we're searching far and wide
47.16	to find things that are like that.
51.36	And when we're searching,
51.36	we're finding amazing things.
54.88	But I want to tell you
54.88	about an amazing thing here on Earth.
59.12	And that is that every minute,
64.32	and almost seven pounds of helium
66.96	escape from Earth into space.
70.8	And this is gas that is going off
70.8	and never coming back.
75.44	So hydrogen, helium and many other things
78.48	make up what's known
78.48	as the Earth's atmosphere.
81.36	The atmosphere is just these gases
81.36	that form a thin blue line
85.2	that's seen here from
85.2	the International Space Station,
88.44	a photograph that some astronauts took.
91.2	And this tenuous veneer around our planet
94.6	is what allows life to flourish.
96.96	It protects our planet
96.96	from too many impacts,
99.84	from meteorites and the like.
101.88	And it's such an amazing phenomenon
105.68	that the fact that it's disappearing
108.52	should frighten you,
108.52	at least a little bit.
112.16	So this process is something that I study
115.48	and it's called atmospheric escape.
118.68	So atmospheric escape
118.68	is not specific to planet Earth.
123.28	It's part of what it means
123.28	to be a planet, if you ask me,
127.04	because planets, not just here on Earth
127.04	but throughout the universe,
131.4	can undergo atmospheric escape.
134	And the way it happens actually tells us
134	about planets themselves.
139.92	Because when you think
139.92	about the solar system,
142.6	you might think about this picture here.
145.8	And you would say, well,
145.8	there are eight planets, maybe nine.
149.24	So for those of you
149.24	who are stressed by this picture,
151.76	I will add somebody for you.
153.16	(Laughter)
154.4	Courtesy of New Horizons,
154.4	we're including Pluto.
158.16	And the thing here is,
159.4	for the purposes of this talk
159.4	and atmospheric escape,
162.16	Pluto is a planet in my mind,
164.2	in the same way that planets
164.2	around other stars that we can't see
168.16	are also planets.
169.96	So fundamental characteristics of planets
172.68	include the fact that they are bodies
175.72	that are bound together by gravity.
177.56	So it's a lot of material
177.56	just stuck together
180.08	with this attractive force.
182.24	And these bodies are so big
182.24	and have so much gravity.
185.12	That's why they're round.
186.44	So when you look at all of these,
188.08	including Pluto,
189.32	they're round.
191	So you can see that gravity
191	is really at play here.
193.76	But another fundamental
193.76	characteristic about planets
197.08	is what you don't see here,
198.84	and that's the star, the Sun,
201.44	that all of the planets
201.44	in the solar system are orbiting around.
205.2	And that's fundamentally driving
205.2	atmospheric escape.
209.76	The reason that fundamentally stars
209.76	drive atmospheric escape from planets
215.12	is because stars offer planets
215.12	particles and light and heat
220.52	that can cause the atmospheres to go away.
223.64	So if you think of a hot-air balloon,
225.48	or you look at this picture
225.48	of lanterns in Thailand at a festival,
229.64	you can see that hot air
229.64	can propel gasses upward.
233.16	And if you have enough energy and heating,
235.44	which our Sun does,
236.8	that gas, which is so light
236.8	and only bound by gravity,
240.72	it can escape into space.
243.6	And so this is what's actually
243.6	causing atmospheric escape
247.56	here on Earth and also on other planets --
250.28	that interplay
250.28	between heating from the star
253	and overcoming the force
253	of gravity on the planet.
257	So I've told you that it happens
258.76	at the rate of 400 pounds
258.76	a minute for hydrogen
262.12	and almost seven pounds for helium.
265.04	But what does that look like?
266.72	Well, even in the '80s,
268.56	we took pictures of the Earth
270.32	in the ultraviolet
271.8	using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.
274.72	So these two images of the Earth
276.56	show you what that glow
276.56	of escaping hydrogen looks like,
280.32	shown in red.
281.6	And you can also see other features
281.6	like oxygen and nitrogen
285.24	in that white glimmer
286.72	in the circle showing you the auroras
289.08	and also some wisps around the tropics.
292	So these are pictures
292	that conclusively show us
295.04	that our atmosphere isn't just
295.04	tightly bound to us here on Earth
298.76	but it's actually
298.76	reaching out far into space,
302.4	and at an alarming rate, I might add.
305.08	But the Earth is not alone
305.08	in undergoing atmospheric escape.
308.92	Mars, our nearest neighbor,
308.92	is much smaller than Earth,
312.4	so it has much less gravity
312.4	with which to hold on to its atmosphere.
316.2	And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,
318.44	we can see it's much thinner
318.44	than the Earth's.
320.68	Just look at the surface.
322.16	You see craters indicating
322.16	that it didn't have an atmosphere
325.64	that could stop those impacts.
327.52	"Also, we see that it's the ""red planet,"""
330.32	and atmospheric escape plays a role
332.88	in Mars being red.
334.48	That's because we think
334.48	Mars used to have a wetter past,
338.08	and when water had enough energy,
338.08	it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,
342.68	and hydrogen being so light,
342.68	it escaped into space,
346.44	and the oxygen that was left
348.4	oxidized or rusted the ground,
350.24	making that familiar
350.24	rusty red color that we see.
354.96	So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars
356.92	and say that atmospheric escape
356.92	probably happened,
359.4	but NASA has a probe that's currently
359.4	at Mars called the MAVEN satellite,
363.52	and its actual job
363.52	is to study atmospheric escape.
367.08	It's the Mars Atmosphere
367.08	and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.
371.68	And results from it have already
371.68	shown pictures very similar
375.36	to what you've seen here on Earth.
377.28	We've long known that Mars
377.28	was losing its atmosphere,
379.8	but we have some stunning pictures.
381.6	Here, for example,
381.6	you can see in the red circle
384.76	is the size of Mars,
386.28	and in blue you can see the hydrogen
386.28	escaping away from the planet.
390.48	So it's reaching out more than 10 times
390.48	the size of the planet,
394.04	far enough away that it's
394.04	no longer bound to that planet.
396.76	It's escaping off into space.
398.76	And this helps us confirm ideas,
401	like why Mars is red,
401	from that lost hydrogen.
404.52	But hydrogen isn't
404.52	the only gas that's lost.
407.12	I mentioned helium on Earth
407.12	and some oxygen and nitrogen,
410.32	and from MAVEN we can also look
410.32	at the oxygen being lost from Mars.
414.12	And you can see
414.12	that because oxygen is heavier,
416.6	it can't get as far as the hydrogen,
419.76	but it's still escaping
419.76	away from the planet.
421.96	You don't see it all confined
421.96	into that red circle.
425.8	So the fact that we not only see
425.8	atmospheric escape on our own planet
429.84	but we can study it elsewhere
429.84	and send spacecraft
433.48	allows us to learn
433.48	about the past of planets
436.6	but also about planets in general
438.88	and Earth's future.
440.68	So one way we actually
440.68	can learn about the future
443.36	is by planets so far away
443.36	that we can't see.
447.44	And I should just note though,
447.44	before I go on to that,
450.52	I'm not going to show you
450.52	photos like this of Pluto,
453	which might be disappointing,
454.44	but that's because we don't have them yet.
456.48	But the New Horizons mission
456.48	is currently studying atmospheric escape
459.76	being lost from the planet.
461.12	So stay tuned and look out for that.
463.56	But the planets
463.56	that I did want to talk about
465.72	are known as transiting exoplanets.
468.04	So any planet orbiting a star
468.04	that's not our Sun
471.84	is called an exoplanet,
471.84	or extrasolar planet.
474.8	And these planets that we call transiting
477.28	have the special feature
478.56	that if you look
478.56	at that star in the middle,
480.68	you'll see that actually it's blinking.
483.08	And the reason that it's blinking
484.96	is because there are planets
484.96	that are going past it all the time,
489	and it's that special orientation
491.16	where the planets are blocking
491.16	the light from the star
493.96	that allows us to see that light blinking.
496.96	And by surveying the stars
496.96	in the night sky
499.84	for this blinking motion,
501.28	we are able to find planets.
502.96	This is how we've now been able
502.96	to detect over 5,000 planets
507.16	in our own Milky Way,
508.4	and we know there are
508.4	many more out there, like I mentioned.
511.28	So when we look at the light
511.28	from these stars,
514.2	what we see, like I said,
514.2	is not the planet itself,
517.72	but you actually see
517.72	a dimming of the light
519.8	that we can record in time.
521.48	So the light drops as the planet
521.48	decreases in front of the star,
524.919	and that's that blinking
524.919	that you saw before.
527.36	So not only do we detect the planets
529.2	but we can look at this light
529.2	in different wavelengths.
532.039	So I mentioned looking at the Earth
532.039	and Mars in ultraviolet light.
536.159	If we look at transiting exoplanets
536.159	with the Hubble Space Telescope,
539.8	we find that in the ultraviolet,
541.92	you see much bigger blinking,
541.92	much less light from the star,
545.6	when the planet is passing in front.
547.4	And we think this is because you have
547.4	an extended atmosphere of hydrogen
550.84	all around the planet
552.08	that's making it look puffier
553.6	and thus blocking
553.6	more of the light that you see.
556.88	So using this technique,
556.88	we've actually been able to discover
559.8	a few transiting exoplanets
559.8	that are undergoing atmospheric escape.
564.08	And these planets
564.08	can be called hot Jupiters,
566.92	for some of the ones we've found.
568.56	And that's because
568.56	they're gas planets like Jupiter,
571.16	but they're so close to their star,
572.96	about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.
575.24	And because there's all this
575.24	lightweight gas that's ready to escape,
578.72	and all this heating from the star,
580.44	you have completely catastrophic rates
580.44	of atmospheric escape.
584.28	So unlike our 400 pounds per minute
584.28	of hydrogen being lost on Earth,
588.92	for these planets,
590.2	you're losing 1.3 billion
590.2	pounds of hydrogen every minute.
595.32	So you might think, well,
595.32	does this make the planet cease to exist?
599.68	And this is a question
599.68	that people wondered
601.72	when they looked at our solar system,
603.56	because planets
603.56	closer to the Sun are rocky,
605.92	and planets further away
605.92	are bigger and more gaseous.
608.88	Could you have started
608.88	with something like Jupiter
611.28	that was actually close to the Sun,
613	and get rid of all the gas in it?
614.64	We now think that if you start
614.64	with something like a hot Jupiter,
617.72	you actually can't end up
617.72	with Mercury or the Earth.
620.56	But if you started with something smaller,
622.76	it's possible that enough gas
622.76	would have gotten away
625.56	that it would have
625.56	significantly impacted it
627.72	and left you with something very different
627.72	than what you started with.
631.08	So all of this sounds sort of general,
633	and we might think about the solar system,
635.56	but what does this have to do
635.56	with us here on Earth?
638.36	Well, in the far future,
640.16	the Sun is going to get brighter.
642.32	And as that happens,
643.56	the heating that we find from the Sun
643.56	is going to become very intense.
647.6	In the same way that you see
647.6	gas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,
651.96	gas is going to stream off from the Earth.
654.32	And so what we can look forward to,
656.52	or at least prepare for,
658.6	is the fact that in the far future,
660.44	the Earth is going to look more like Mars.
663.24	Our hydrogen, from water
663.24	that is broken down,
666	is going to escape
666	into space more rapidly,
668.44	and we're going to be left
668.44	with this dry, reddish planet.
672.96	So don't fear, it's not
672.96	for a few billion years,
675.48	so there's some time to prepare.
677.08	(Laughter)
678.16	But I wanted you
678.16	to be aware of what's going on,
681	not just in the future,
682.28	but atmospheric escape
682.28	is happening as we speak.
685.52	So there's a lot of amazing science
685.52	that you hear about happening in space
689.04	and planets that are far away,
691	and we are studying these planets
691	to learn about these worlds.
694.24	But as we learn about Mars
694.24	or exoplanets like hot Jupiters,
698.96	we find things like atmospheric escape
702	that tell us a lot more
702	about our planet here on Earth.
705.76	So consider that the next time
705.76	you think that space is far away.
709.84	Thank you.
711.08	(Applause)
