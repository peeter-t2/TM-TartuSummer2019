13.67	Someone who looks like me
13.67	walks past you in the street.
18.772	Do you think they're a mother,
20.751	a refugee
22.199	or a victim of oppression?
24.253	Or do you think they're a cardiologist,
26.454	a barrister
27.496	or maybe your local politician?
30.325	Do you look me up and down,
32.283	wondering how hot I must get
33.775	or if my husband has forced me
33.775	to wear this outfit?
38.384	What if I wore my scarf like this?
43.531	I can walk down the street
43.531	in the exact same outfit
46.763	and what the world expects of me
46.763	and the way I'm treated
49.42	depends on the arrangement
49.42	of this piece of cloth.
52.771	But this isn't going to be
52.771	another monologue about the hijab
55.885	because Lord knows, Muslim women
55.885	are so much more than the piece of cloth
59.861	they choose, or not,
59.861	to wrap their head in.
63.82	This is about looking beyond your bias.
68.204	What if I walked past you and later on
70.084	you'd found out that actually
70.084	I was a race car engineer,
73.678	and that I designed my own race car
73.678	and I ran my university's race team,
77.122	because it's true.
79.117	What if I told you that I was actually
79.117	trained as a boxer for five years,
84.127	because that's true, too.
86.224	Would it surprise you?
89.038	Why?
91.487	Ladies and gentlemen, ultimately,
93.319	that surprise and the behaviors
93.319	associated with it
96.347	are the product of something 
96.347	called unconscious bias,
99	or implicit prejudice.
100.372	And that results in the
100.372	ridiculously detrimental
103.613	lack of diversity in our workforce,
105.351	particularly in areas of influence.
107.714	Hello, Australian Federal Cabinet.
110.246	(Applause)
112.318	Let me just set something out
112.318	from the outset:
115.327	Unconscious bias is not the same
115.327	as conscious discrimination.
118.689	I'm not saying that in all of you, 
118.689	there's a secret sexist or racist
122.199	or ageist lurking within, 
122.199	waiting to get out.
124.841	That's not what I'm saying.
126.578	We all have our biases.
128.53	They're the filters through which
128.53	we see the world around us.
131.869	I'm not accusing anyone,
133.844	bias is not an accusation.
135.338	Rather, it's something that 
135.338	has to be identified,
137.879	acknowledged and mitigated against.
141.082	Bias can be about race,
142.476	it can be about gender.
143.68	It can also be about class,
143.68	education, disability.
147.383	The fact is, we all have biases
147.383	against what's different,
150.406	what's different to our social norms.
153.335	The thing is, if we want 
153.335	to live in a world
156.359	where the circumstances of your birth
159.494	do not dictate your future
161.935	and where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,
164.14	then each and every one of us
164.14	has a role to play
167.697	in making sure unconscious bias
167.697	does not determine our lives.
172.12	There's this really famous experiment
172.12	in the space of unconscious bias
175.909	and that's in the space of gender
175.909	in the 1970s and 1980s.
179.637	So orchestras, back in the day,
179.637	were made up mostly of dudes,
183.672	up to only five percent were female.
186.473	And apparently, that was because
186.473	men played it differently,
189.741	presumably better, presumably.
192.555	But in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra
195.517	started an experiment.
197.282	They started blind auditions.
199.125	So rather than face-to-face auditions,
199.125	you would have to play behind a screen.
202.954	Now funnily enough,
204.466	no immediate change was registered
206.754	until they asked the audition-ers
206.754	to take their shoes off
209.89	before they entered the room.
211.578	because the clickity-clack 
211.578	of the heels
213.618	against the hardwood floors
215.559	was enough to give the ladies away.
217.828	Now get this,
219.334	there results of the audition showed
221.196	that there was a 50 percent
221.196	increased chance
224.196	a woman would progress past
224.196	the preliminary stage.
227.126	And it almost tripled 
227.126	their chances of getting in.
231.58	What does that tell us?
233.093	Well, unfortunately for the guys,
233.093	men actually didn't play differently,
236.929	but there was the perception
236.929	that they did.
239.829	And it was that bias that was
239.829	determining their outcome.
243.146	So what we're doing here 
243.146	is identifying and acknowledging
246.244	that a bias exists.
247.292	And look, we all do it.
248.91	Let me give you an example.
250.697	A son and his father are in 
250.697	a horrible car accident.
254.475	The father dies on impact
256.339	and the son, who's severely injured,
256.339	is rushed to hospital.
259.999	The surgeon looks at the son
259.999	when they arrive and is like,
263.381	"""I can't operate."""
265.788	Why?
267.694	"""The boy is my son."""
270.9	How can that be?
272.248	Ladies and gentlemen,
273.468	the surgeon is his mother.
276.334	Now hands up -- and it's okay --
278.077	but hands up if you initially assumed
278.077	the surgeon was a guy?
282.917	There's evidence that
282.917	that unconscious bias exists,
285.838	but we all just have
285.838	to acknowledge that it's there
288.87	and then look at ways 
288.87	that we can move past it
291.554	so that we can look at solutions.
294.588	Now one of the interesting things
297.075	around the space of unconscious bias
297.075	is the topic of quotas.
300.357	And this something 
300.357	that's often brought up.
302.682	And of of the criticisms 
302.682	is this idea of merit.
305.993	Look, I don't want to be picked 
305.993	because I'm a chick,
309.165	I want to be picked because 
309.165	I have merit,
311.432	because I'm the best person for the job.
313.608	It's a sentiment that's pretty common
313.608	among female engineers
316.507	that I work with and that I know.
318.413	And yeah, I get it, I've been there.
320.314	But, if the merit idea was true,
322.653	why would identical resumes, 
322.653	in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,
327.42	identical resumes sent out
327.42	for a lab technician,
332.014	why would Jennifers
332.014	be deemed less competent,
335.23	be less likely to be offered the job,
337.494	and be paid less than Johns.
342.191	The unconscious bias is there,
343.624	but we just have to look at
343.624	how we can move past it.
346.06	And, you know, it's interesting,
347.681	there's some research that talks about
349.494	why this is the case and
349.494	it's called the merit paradox.
352.346	And in organizations --
352.346	and this is kind of ironic --
354.867	in organizations that talk about merit
354.867	being their primary value-driver
358.694	in terms of who they hire,
360.066	they were more likely to hire dudes
360.066	and more likely to pay the guys more
363.561	because apparently merit 
363.561	is a masculine quality.
367.168	But, hey.
368.43	So you guys think you've got 
368.43	a good read on me,
370.744	you kinda think you know what's up.
374.175	Can you imagine me running one of these?
377.748	Can you imagine me walking in
377.748	and being like,
380.035	"""Hey boys, this is what's up."
380.035	"This is how it's done."""
383.14	Well, I'm glad you can.
391.26	(Applause)
397.233	Because ladies and gentlemen,
397.233	that's my day job.
400.31	And the cool thing about it is
400.31	that it's pretty entertaining.
403.247	Actually, in places like Malaysia,
404.935	Muslim women on rigs 
404.935	isn't even comment-worthy.
407.395	There are that many of them.
408.764	But, it is entertaining.
409.992	I remember, I was telling one of the guys,
412.049	"""Hey, mate, look, I really want "
412.049	"to learn how to surf."""
414.62	"And he's like, ""Yassmin, I don't"
414.62	know how you can surf
417.181	with all that gear you've got on,
419.552	"and I don't know any women-only beaches."""
422.226	And then, the guy came up 
422.226	with a brilliant idea,
424.51	"he was like, ""I know, you run"
424.51	that organization
426.768	Youth Without Borders, right?
428.628	Why don't you start a clothing line
428.628	for Muslim chicks in beaches.
433.282	You can call it 
433.282	"Youth Without Boardshorts."""
435.919	(Laughter)
437.435	"And I was like, ""Thanks, guys."""
439.25	And I remember another bloke 
439.25	telling me that
442.356	I should eat all the yogurt I could
444.169	because that was the only culture 
444.169	I was going to get around there.
449.477	But, the problem is, it's kind of true
452.366	because there's an intense 
452.366	lack of diversity in our workforce,
455.704	particularly in places of influence.
457.992	Now, in 2010, 
459.352	The Australian National University
459.352	did an experiment
461.825	where they sent out
461.825	4,000 identical applications
465.431	to entry level jobs, essentially.
468.963	To get the same number of interviews
468.963	as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,
473.177	if you were Chinese, you had 
473.177	to send out 68 percent more applications.
477.674	If you were Middle Eastern --
477.674	Abdel-Magied --
480.368	you had to send out 64 percent,
482.418	and if you're Italian, 
482.418	you're pretty lucky,
484.581	you only have to send out 12 percent more.
487.142	In places like Silicon Valley,
487.142	it's not that much better.
490.151	In Google, they put out 
490.151	some diversity results
492.448	and 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian
492.448	and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,
499.39	all that kind of thing.
500.717	And the rest of the tech world
500.717	is not that much better
503.345	and they've acknowledged it,
504.677	but I'm not really sure
504.677	what they're doing about it.
507.225	The thing is, it doesn't trickle up.
509.445	In a study done by Green Park,
511.203	who are a British senior exec supplier,
515.275	they said that over half
515.275	of the FTSE 100 companies
519.738	don't have a nonwhite leader
519.738	at their board level,
522.138	executive or non-executive.
523.593	And two out of every three
523.593	don't have an executive
527.686	who's from a minority.
529.956	And most of the minorities 
529.956	that are at that sort of level
532.778	are non-executive board directors.
534.42	So their influence isn't that great.
537.086	I've told you a bunch of terrible things.
539.301	"You're like, ""Oh my god, how bad is that?"
539.301	"What can I do about it?"""
543.662	Well, fortunately,
545.815	we've identified that there's a problem.
547.857	There's a lack of opportunity,
547.857	and that's due to unconscious bias.
553.713	But you might be sitting 
553.713	there thinking,
555.672	"""I ain't brown. What's that got"
555.672	"to do with me?"""
560.042	Let me offer you a solution.
562.466	And as I've said before,
563.717	we live in a world where
563.717	we're looking for an ideal.
567.568	And if we want to create a world
569.208	where the circumstances
569.208	of your birth don't matter,
571.809	we all have to be part of the solution.
573.838	And interestingly, the author
573.838	of the lab resume experiment
576.913	offered some sort of a solution.
578.514	She said the one thing that brought
578.514	the successful women together,
582.248	the one thing that they had in common,
584.227	was the fact that they had good mentors.
586.694	So mentoring, we've all kind of
586.694	heard that before,
589.139	it's in the vernacular.
592.267	Here's another challenge for you.
594.661	I challenge each and every one of you
594.661	to mentor someone different.
599.771	Think about it.
600.988	Everyone wants to mentor someone
600.988	who kind of is familiar,
604.034	who looks like us,
604.893	we have shared experiences.
606.367	If I see a Muslim chick 
606.367	who's got a bit of attitude,
609.028	"I'm like, ""What's up? We can hang out."""
610.881	You walk into a room and there's someone
610.881	who went to the same school,
614.117	you play the same sports,
615.428	there's a high chance that you're
615.428	going to want to help that person out.
619.016	But for the person in the room
619.016	who has no shared experiences with you
622.509	it becomes extremely difficult 
622.509	to find that connection.
625.415	The idea of finding someone 
625.415	different to mentor,
627.834	someone who doesn't come
627.834	from the same background as you,
630.505	whatever that background is,
631.988	is about opening doors 
631.988	for people who couldn't even get
635.336	to the damn hallway.
638.081	Because ladies and gentlemen,
638.081	the world is not just.
641.566	People are not born 
641.566	with equal opportunity.
643.699	I was born in one of the poorest
643.699	cities in the world, Khartoum.
646.986	I was born brown, I was born female,
649.107	and I was born Muslim in a world
649.107	that is pretty suspicious of us
652.941	for reasons I can't control.
656.186	However, I also acknowledge the fact
656.186	that I was born with privilege.
660.156	I was born with amazing parents,
661.825	I was given an education
663.43	and had the blessing
663.43	of migrating to Australia.
666.067	But also, I've been blessed
666.067	with amazing mentors
668.658	who've opened doors for me 
668.658	that I didn't even know were there.
671.674	A mentor who said to me,
673.032	"""Hey, your story's interesting."
674.635	Let's write something about it
674.635	"so that I can share it with people."""
677.862	A mentor who said,
678.868	"""I know you're all those things that don't"
678.868	belong on an Australian rig,
682.219	"but come on anyway."""
683.548	And here I am, talking to you.
685.055	And I'm not the only one.
686.393	There's all sorts of people
686.393	in my communities
688.862	that I see have been
688.862	helped out by mentors.
691.026	A young Muslim man in Sydney
692.805	who ended up using his mentor's help
695.973	to start up a poetry slam in Bankstown
699.476	and now it's a huge thing.
701.098	And he's able to change the lives
701.098	of so many other young people.
704.218	Or a lady here in Brisbane,
705.542	an Afghan lady who's a refugee,
707.4	who could barely speak English
707.4	when she came to Australia,
710.151	her mentors helped her become a doctor
712.03	and she took our Young Queenslander 
712.03	of the Year Award in 2008.
715.253	She's an inspiration.
722.366	This is so not smooth.
726.376	This is me.
728.94	But I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,
731.812	and I'm also the woman who was
731.812	in the abaya at the beginning.
735.611	Would you have chosen to mentor me
735.611	if you had seen me
738.709	in one of those other versions
738.709	of who I am?
740.962	Because I'm that same person.
744.11	We have to look past our unconscious bias,
747.014	find someone to mentor who's at
747.014	the opposite end of your spectrum
750.206	because structural change takes time,
752.591	and I don't have that level of patience.
756.707	So if we're going to create a change,
758.468	if we're going to create a world
760.03	where we all have
760.03	those kinds of opportunities,
762.286	then choose to open doors for people.
764.657	Because you might think that
764.657	diversity has nothing to do with you,
768.471	but we are all part of this system
770.205	and we can all be part of that solution.
772.301	And if you don't know
772.301	where to find someone different,
774.855	go to the places you wouldn't usually go.
776.833	If you enroll in
776.833	private high school tutoring,
778.996	go to your local state school
780.463	or maybe just drop into your
780.463	local refugee tutoring center.
783.893	Or perhaps you work at an office.
785.616	Take out that new grad who looks
785.616	totally out of place --
788.614	'cause that was me --
789.942	and open doors for them,
791.27	not in a tokenistic way,
791.27	because we're not victims,
793.9	but show them the opportunities
795.968	because opening up your world
798.07	will make you realize that 
798.07	you have access to doors
800.741	that they didn't even know existed
802.565	and you didn't even know
802.565	they didn't have.
805.501	Ladies and gentlemen,
808.358	there is a problem in our community
808.358	with lack of opportunity,
811.907	especially due to unconscious bias.
813.75	But each and every one one of you
813.75	has the potential to change that.
817.782	I know you've been given a lot
817.782	of challenges today,
820.654	but if you can take this one piece
820.654	and think about it a little differently,
824.495	because diversity is magic.
827.736	And I encourage you to look past
827.736	your initial perceptions
831.554	because I bet you,
833.378	they're probably wrong.
835.199	Thank you.
837.624	(Applause)
