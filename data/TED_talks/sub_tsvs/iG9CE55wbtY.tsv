25	Good morning. How are you?
29.702	(Laughter)
30.936	It's been great, hasn't it?
33.273	I've been blown away by the whole thing.
35.753	In fact, I'm leaving.
37.269	(Laughter)
43.015	There have been three themes
43.015	running through the conference
46.246	which are relevant
46.246	to what I want to talk about.
48.777	One is the extraordinary
48.777	evidence of human creativity
53.491	in all of the presentations that we've had
55.928	and in all of the people here.
57.753	Just the variety of it
57.753	and the range of it.
61.158	The second is
61.158	that it's put us in a place
63.325	where we have no idea
63.325	what's going to happen,
65.846	in terms of the future.
67.261	No idea how this may play out.
70	I have an interest in education.
71.916	Actually, what I find is everybody
71.916	has an interest in education.
76.072	Don't you?
77.234	I find this very interesting.
78.739	If you're at a dinner party,
80.596	and you say you work in education --
82.882	Actually, you're not often
82.882	at dinner parties, frankly.
85.87	(Laughter)
89.69	If you work in education,
89.69	you're not asked.
92.142	(Laughter)
95.257	And you're never asked back, curiously.
95.257	That's strange to me.
99	But if you are, and you say to somebody,
101.499	"you know, they say, ""What do you do?"""
103.3	and you say you work in education,
105	you can see the blood run from their face.
107.1	"They're like, ""Oh my God,"""
107.1	"you know, ""Why me?"""
109.404	(Laughter)
111.065	"""My one night out all week."""
112.712	(Laughter)
115.346	But if you ask about their education,
115.346	they pin you to the wall.
118.611	Because it's one of those things
118.611	that goes deep with people, am I right?
122.194	Like religion, and money and other things.
125.559	So I have a big interest in education,
125.559	and I think we all do.
129.935	We have a huge vested interest in it,
131.851	partly because it's education
131.851	that's meant to take us into this future
135.195	that we can't grasp.
136.873	If you think of it,
136.873	children starting school this year
140.396	will be retiring in 2065.
145.209	Nobody has a clue,
146.867	despite all the expertise that's been
146.867	on parade for the past four days,
150.45	what the world will look like
150.45	in five years' time.
153	And yet we're meant
153	to be educating them for it.
155.318	So the unpredictability,
155.318	I think, is extraordinary.
157.892	And the third part of this
159.283	is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,
161.344	on the really extraordinary
161.344	capacities that children have --
166.673	their capacities for innovation.
169.031	I mean, Sirena last night
169.031	was a marvel, wasn't she?
171.566	Just seeing what she could do.
173.2	And she's exceptional, but I think
173.2	she's not, so to speak,
178	exceptional in the whole of childhood.
181.98	What you have there is a person
181.98	of extraordinary dedication
184.8	who found a talent.
186.091	And my contention is,
186.091	all kids have tremendous talents.
188.8	And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
190.8	So I want to talk about education
193	and I want to talk about creativity.
194.896	My contention is that creativity now
194.896	is as important in education as literacy,
200.939	and we should treat it
200.939	with the same status.
203.827	(Applause) Thank you.
205.822	(Applause)
210.485	That was it, by the way.
211.768	Thank you very much.
212.795	(Laughter)
214.934	So, 15 minutes left.
216.635	(Laughter)
219.595	Well, I was born... no.
221.511	(Laughter)
224.567	I heard a great story recently
224.567	-- I love telling it --
227.336	of a little girl
227.336	who was in a drawing lesson.
230.075	She was six, and she was
230.075	at the back, drawing,
232.234	and the teacher said this girl
232.234	hardly ever paid attention,
235.058	and in this drawing lesson, she did.
236.868	The teacher was fascinated.
238.232	She went over to her,
238.232	"and she said, ""What are you drawing?"""
241.018	"And the girl said, ""I'm"
241.018	"drawing a picture of God."""
244.642	"And the teacher said, ""But nobody"
244.642	"knows what God looks like."""
247.984	And the girl said,
247.984	"""They will, in a minute."""
250.096	(Laughter)
261.662	When my son was four in England --
264.413	Actually, he was four
264.413	everywhere, to be honest.
266.628	(Laughter)
268.404	If we're being strict about it,
268.404	wherever he went, he was four that year.
271.815	He was in the Nativity play.
271.815	Do you remember the story?
274.477	(Laughter)
275.72	No, it was big, it was a big story.
277.571	Mel Gibson did the sequel,
277.571	you may have seen it.
279.9	(Laughter)
281.185	"""Nativity II."""
282.519	But James got the part of Joseph,
282.519	which we were thrilled about.
286.678	We considered this to be
286.678	one of the lead parts.
289.239	We had the place crammed
289.239	full of agents in T-shirts:
291.74	"""James Robinson IS Joseph!"" (Laughter)"
294	He didn't have to speak,
295.631	but you know the bit
295.631	where the three kings come in?
298.093	They come in bearing gifts,
298.093	gold, frankincense and myrrh.
300.848	This really happened.
301.986	We were sitting there and I think
301.986	they just went out of sequence,
305.1	because we talked to the little boy
305.1	afterward and we said,
307.9	"""You OK with that?"" And he said,"
307.9	"""Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"""
310.8	They just switched.
311.9	The three boys came in,
313.1	four-year-olds with tea towels
313.1	on their heads,
315.311	and they put these boxes down,
316.826	and the first boy said,
316.826	"""I bring you gold."""
318.899	And the second boy said,
318.899	"""I bring you myrrh."""
321.061	"And the third boy said, ""Frank sent this."""
323.089	(Laughter)
335.711	What these things have in common
335.711	is that kids will take a chance.
338.825	If they don't know, they'll have a go.
341.457	Am I right? They're not
341.457	frightened of being wrong.
345.893	I don't mean to say that being wrong
345.893	is the same thing as being creative.
349.886	What we do know is,
349.886	if you're not prepared to be wrong,
353	you'll never come up
353	with anything original --
355.391	if you're not prepared to be wrong.
357.877	And by the time they get to be adults,
357.877	most kids have lost that capacity.
362.406	They have become
362.406	frightened of being wrong.
364.95	And we run our companies like this.
366.664	We stigmatize mistakes.
368.34	And we're now running
368.34	national education systems
370.666	where mistakes are the worst
370.666	thing you can make.
373.7	And the result is that
373.7	we are educating people
376.932	out of their creative capacities.
379.247	Picasso once said this, he said
379.247	that all children are born artists.
383.749	The problem is to remain an artist
383.749	as we grow up.
386.995	I believe this passionately,
386.995	that we don't grow into creativity,
390.1	we grow out of it.
391.98	Or rather, we get educated out of it.
394.247	So why is this?
395.826	I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
395.826	until about five years ago.
399.931	In fact, we moved
399.931	from Stratford to Los Angeles.
402.872	So you can imagine
402.872	what a seamless transition that was.
405.56	(Laughter)
407	Actually, we lived in a place
407	called Snitterfield,
409.4	just outside Stratford,
410.675	which is where
410.675	Shakespeare's father was born.
413.082	Are you struck by a new thought? I was.
415.481	You don't think of Shakespeare
415.481	having a father, do you?
418.1	Do you? Because you don't think
418.1	of Shakespeare being a child, do you?
422	Shakespeare being seven?
423.591	I never thought of it.
424.864	I mean, he was seven at some point.
426.572	He was in somebody's
426.572	English class, wasn't he?
428.906	(Laughter)
435.717	How annoying would that be?
437.07	(Laughter)
444.729	"""Must try harder."""
445.788	(Laughter)
449.712	Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,
449.712	"to Shakespeare, ""Go to bed, now!"
453.2	"And put the pencil down."""
455.652	(Laughter)
456.75	"""And stop speaking like that."""
458.329	(Laughter)
462.244	"""It's confusing everybody."""
463.592	(Laughter)
468.739	Anyway, we moved
468.739	from Stratford to Los Angeles,
474.101	and I just want to say a word
474.101	about the transition.
476.566	My son didn't want to come.
478	I've got two kids;
478	he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.
481	He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.
483.068	He loved it, but he had
483.068	a girlfriend in England.
486.048	This was the love of his life, Sarah.
489.761	He'd known her for a month.
491.16	(Laughter)
492.534	Mind you, they'd had
492.534	their fourth anniversary,
494.814	because it's a long time when you're 16.
497.777	He was really upset on the plane,
499.462	"he said, ""I'll never find"
499.462	"another girl like Sarah."""
501.947	And we were rather pleased
501.947	about that, frankly --
504.349	(Laughter)
512.395	Because she was the main reason
512.395	we were leaving the country.
515.3	(Laughter)
521.059	But something strikes you
521.059	when you move to America
523.425	and travel around the world:
524.815	Every education system on Earth
524.815	has the same hierarchy of subjects.
528.537	Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.
530.516	You'd think it would be
530.516	otherwise, but it isn't.
532.81	At the top are mathematics and languages,
534.8	then the humanities,
534.8	and at the bottom are the arts.
537.258	Everywhere on Earth.
538.4	And in pretty much every system too,
538.4	there's a hierarchy within the arts.
542.519	Art and music are normally
542.519	given a higher status in schools
545.4	than drama and dance.
546.591	There isn't an education
546.591	system on the planet
548.871	that teaches dance everyday to children
550.953	the way we teach them mathematics. Why?
553.524	Why not? I think this is rather important.
556.249	I think math is very
556.249	important, but so is dance.
558.576	Children dance all the time
558.576	if they're allowed to, we all do.
561.5	We all have bodies, don't we?
561.5	Did I miss a meeting?
564	(Laughter)
567.51	Truthfully, what happens is,
567.51	as children grow up,
569.869	we start to educate them progressively
569.869	from the waist up.
572.661	And then we focus on their heads.
574.31	And slightly to one side.
576.319	If you were to visit
576.319	education, as an alien,
579	"and say ""What's it for, public education?"""
582	I think you'd have to conclude,
582	if you look at the output,
584.8	who really succeeds by this,
586.2	who does everything that they should,
588	who gets all the brownie
588	points, who are the winners --
590.755	I think you'd have to conclude
590.755	the whole purpose of public education
594.118	throughout the world
595.239	is to produce university professors.
597.216	Isn't it?
598.551	They're the people who come out the top.
600.558	And I used to be one, so there.
602.761	(Laughter)
605.421	And I like university
605.421	professors, but you know,
608.546	we shouldn't hold them up
610.045	as the high-water mark
610.045	of all human achievement.
613	They're just a form of life,
615	another form of life.
616.584	But they're rather curious, and I say this
616.584	out of affection for them.
619.906	There's something curious
619.906	about professors in my experience --
622.9	not all of them, but typically,
622.9	they live in their heads.
625.6	They live up there,
625.6	and slightly to one side.
628.495	They're disembodied, you know,
628.495	in a kind of literal way.
631.893	They look upon their body as a form
631.893	of transport for their heads.
635.01	(Laughter)
641.2	Don't they?
642.24	It's a way of getting
642.24	their head to meetings.
644.486	(Laughter)
650.022	If you want real evidence
650.022	of out-of-body experiences,
653.876	get yourself along to a residential
653.876	conference of senior academics,
657.386	and pop into the discotheque
657.386	on the final night.
659.653	(Laughter)
662.478	And there, you will see it.
663.858	Grown men and women
663.858	writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.
668	(Laughter)
670.891	Waiting until it ends so they can
670.891	go home and write a paper about it.
674.24	(Laughter)
676.168	Our education system is predicated
676.168	on the idea of academic ability.
680.035	And there's a reason.
681.3	Around the world, there were
681.3	no public systems of education,
684.88	really, before the 19th century.
687.01	They all came into being
687.01	to meet the needs of industrialism.
690.269	So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
692.456	Number one, that the most useful
692.456	subjects for work are at the top.
697.077	So you were
697.077	probably steered benignly away
699.132	from things at school when you
699.132	were a kid, things you liked,
702.09	on the grounds that you would
702.09	never get a job doing that. Is that right?
705.5	Don't do music, you're not
705.5	going to be a musician;
707.905	don't do art, you won't be an artist.
709.73	Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.
713.174	The whole world
713.174	is engulfed in a revolution.
715.343	And the second is academic ability,
717.464	which has really come to dominate
717.464	our view of intelligence,
720.373	because the universities designed
720.373	the system in their image.
723.3	If you think of it, the whole system
723.3	of public education around the world
726.818	is a protracted process
726.818	of university entrance.
729.068	And the consequence
729.068	is that many highly-talented,
731.425	brilliant, creative
731.425	people think they're not,
733.884	because the thing
733.884	they were good at at school
736.046	wasn't valued,
736.046	or was actually stigmatized.
738.383	And I think we can't afford
738.383	to go on that way.
740.703	In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,
743.191	more people worldwide will be graduating
746.025	through education
746.025	than since the beginning of history.
748.595	More people, and it's the combination
748.595	of all the things we've talked about --
752.3	technology and its transformation
752.3	effect on work, and demography
755.372	and the huge explosion in population.
757.2	Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.
760.089	Isn't that true?
761.723	When I was a student,
761.723	if you had a degree, you had a job.
764.5	If you didn't have a job,
764.5	it's because you didn't want one.
767.3	And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter)
770	But now kids with degrees
774.098	are often heading home
774.098	to carry on playing video games,
777.167	because you need an MA where
777.167	the previous job required a BA,
780.389	and now you need a PhD for the other.
782.2	It's a process of academic inflation.
784	And it indicates the whole
784	structure of education
786.4	is shifting beneath our feet.
787.857	We need to radically rethink
787.857	our view of intelligence.
790.501	We know three things about intelligence.
792.52	One, it's diverse.
793.771	We think about the world in all the ways
793.771	that we experience it.
796.8	We think visually, we think in sound,
796.8	we think kinesthetically.
799.8	We think in abstract terms,
799.8	we think in movement.
802.246	Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
804.587	If you look at the interactions
804.587	of a human brain,
807	as we heard yesterday
807	from a number of presentations,
810	intelligence is wonderfully interactive.
812	The brain isn't divided into compartments.
814.873	In fact, creativity --
814.873	which I define as the process
818	of having original ideas
818	that have value --
820.349	more often than not comes about
820.349	through the interaction
823.025	of different disciplinary
823.025	ways of seeing things.
827.31	By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
827.31	that joins the two halves of the brain
831	called the corpus callosum.
832.515	It's thicker in women.
834.088	Following off from Helen yesterday,
835.853	this is probably why women
835.853	are better at multi-tasking.
839	Because you are, aren't you?
840.841	There's a raft of research,
840.841	but I know it from my personal life.
844.738	If my wife is cooking a meal at home --
844.738	which is not often, thankfully.
850	(Laughter)
852.878	No, she's good at some things,
852.878	but if she's cooking,
855.4	she's dealing with people on the phone,
857.3	she's talking to the kids,
857.3	she's painting the ceiling,
859.88	she's doing open-heart surgery over here.
863	If I'm cooking, the door
863	is shut, the kids are out,
866	the phone's on the hook,
866	if she comes in I get annoyed.
869	"I say, ""Terry, please,"
869	"I'm trying to fry an egg in here."""
872.095	(Laughter)
879.254	"""Give me a break."""
880.478	(Laughter)
882.222	Actually, do you know
882.222	that old philosophical thing,
884.745	if a tree falls in a forest
884.745	and nobody hears it, did it happen?
888.252	Remember that old chestnut?
889.605	I saw a great t-shirt
889.605	recently, which said,
892.038	"""If a man speaks his mind"
892.038	in a forest, and no woman hears him,
896	"is he still wrong?"""
897.42	(Laughter)
904.976	And the third thing about intelligence is,
907	it's distinct.
908.754	I'm doing a new book at the moment
908.754	"called ""Epiphany,"""
911.351	which is based on a series
911.351	of interviews with people
913.849	about how they discovered their talent.
915.793	I'm fascinated
915.793	by how people got to be there.
917.986	It's really prompted by a conversation
917.986	I had with a wonderful woman
921.2	who maybe most people
921.2	have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.
923.9	Have you heard of her? Some have.
925.554	She's a choreographer,
925.554	and everybody knows her work.
928.1	"She did ""Cats"" and ""Phantom of the Opera."""
930.125	She's wonderful.
931.127	I used to be on the board
931.127	of The Royal Ballet,
933.297	as you can see.
934.522	Anyway, Gillian and I had
934.522	lunch one day and I said,
937.047	"""How did you get to be a dancer?"""
938.976	It was interesting.
940	When she was at school,
940	she was really hopeless.
942.374	And the school, in the '30s,
942.374	wrote to her parents and said,
946	"""We think Gillian"
946	"has a learning disorder."""
948.024	She couldn't concentrate;
948.024	she was fidgeting.
950.19	I think now they'd say she had ADHD.
950.19	Wouldn't you?
953.504	But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
953.504	hadn't been invented at this point.
957.587	It wasn't an available condition.
960	(Laughter)
962.761	People weren't aware they could have that.
964.845	(Laughter)
967.003	Anyway, she went to see this specialist.
971.305	So, this oak-paneled room,
971.305	and she was there with her mother,
975.051	and she was led and sat
975.051	on this chair at the end,
977.552	and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes
977.552	while this man talked to her mother
981.215	about the problems
981.215	Gillian was having at school.
983.567	Because she was disturbing people;
983.567	her homework was always late; and so on,
987.268	little kid of eight.
988.388	In the end, the doctor
988.388	went and sat next to Gillian, and said,
991.467	"""I've listened to all these"
991.467	things your mother's told me,
994.196	I need to speak to her privately.
995.839	Wait here. We'll be back;
995.839	"we won't be very long,"""
998.239	and they went and left her.
1000.588	But as they went out of the room,
1002.248	he turned on the radio
1002.248	that was sitting on his desk.
1005.342	And when they got out, he said to her
1005.342	"mother, ""Just stand and watch her."""
1009	And the minute they left the room,
1012.015	she was on her feet, moving to the music.
1014.523	And they watched for a few minutes
1014.523	and he turned to her mother and said,
1018	"""Mrs. Lynne, Gillian"
1018	isn't sick; she's a dancer.
1022	"Take her to a dance school."""
1024	"I said, ""What happened?"""
1026	"She said, ""She did. I can't tell you"
1026	how wonderful it was.
1029	We walked in this room
1029	and it was full of people like me.
1031.777	People who couldn't sit still.
1034	"People who had to move to think."""
1034	Who had to move to think.
1038.746	They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
1038.746	they did modern; they did contemporary.
1042.4	She was eventually auditioned
1042.4	for the Royal Ballet School;
1045.244	she became a soloist; she had
1045.244	a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.
1048.567	She eventually graduated
1048.567	from the Royal Ballet School,
1051.2	founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,
1053.2	met Andrew Lloyd Webber.
1054.568	She's been responsible for
1056.001	some of the most successful
1056.001	musical theater productions in history,
1059.172	she's given pleasure to millions,
1059.172	and she's a multi-millionaire.
1062.269	Somebody else might have put her
1062.269	on medication and told her to calm down.
1066.364	(Applause)
1073.575	What I think it comes to is this:
1075.2	Al Gore spoke the other night
1077	about ecology and the revolution
1077	that was triggered by Rachel Carson.
1082.111	I believe our only hope for the future
1084.301	is to adopt a new conception
1084.301	of human ecology,
1088.158	one in which we start
1088.158	to reconstitute our conception
1091	of the richness of human capacity.
1093	Our education system has mined our minds
1096.523	in the way that we strip-mine the earth:
1096.523	for a particular commodity.
1100.188	And for the future, it won't serve us.
1102.696	We have to rethink
1102.696	the fundamental principles
1105	on which we're educating our children.
1107.087	There was a wonderful quote
1107.087	by Jonas Salk, who said,
1109.785	"""If all the insects"
1109.785	were to disappear from the Earth,
1114.848	within 50 years all life
1114.848	on Earth would end.
1118.688	If all human beings
1118.688	disappeared from the Earth,
1121.784	within 50 years all forms
1121.784	"of life would flourish."""
1125.244	And he's right.
1127.291	What TED celebrates is the gift
1127.291	of the human imagination.
1131.417	We have to be careful now
1133.512	that we use this gift wisely
1135.791	and that we avert some of the scenarios
1135.791	that we've talked about.
1139.044	And the only way we'll do it is by seeing
1139.044	our creative capacities
1143	for the richness they are
1144.634	and seeing our children
1144.634	for the hope that they are.
1147.84	And our task is to educate
1147.84	their whole being,
1150.262	so they can face this future.
1151.77	By the way -- we may not see this future,
1154	but they will.
1155.454	And our job is to help them
1155.454	make something of it.
1158.557	Thank you very much.
1159.581	(Applause)
