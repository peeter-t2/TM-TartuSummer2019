12.38	Have you ever heard the one
12.38	about how breastfeeding is free?
17.086	(Laughter)
18.26	Yeah, it's pretty funny,
20.5	because it's only free if we don't value
20.5	women's time and energy.
26.94	Any mother can tell you
26.94	how much time and energy it takes
31.54	to liquify her body --
33.5	to literally dissolve herself --
36.06	(Laughter)
37.66	as she feeds this precious
37.66	little cannibal.
40.94	(Laughter)
43.18	Milk is why mammals suck.
47.22	At Arizona State University,
49.14	in the Comparative Lactation Lab,
51.1	I decode mothers' milk composition
53.9	to understand its complexity
56.9	and how it influences infant development.
60.54	The most important thing that I've learned
63.62	is that we do not do enough
63.62	to support mothers and babies.
69.54	And when we fail mothers and babies,
71.74	we fail everyone
71.74	who loves mothers and babies:
75.9	the fathers, the partners,
75.9	the grandparents, the aunties,
79.1	the friends and kin
79.1	that make our human social networks.
84.3	It's time that we abandon
84.3	simple solutions and simple slogans,
89.06	and grapple with the nuance.
92.02	I was very fortunate
93.62	to run smack-dab
93.62	into that nuance very early,
97.3	during my first interview
97.3	with a journalist
100.38	when she asked me,
101.7	"""How long should a mother"
101.7	"breastfeed her baby?"""
107.86	"And it was that word ""should"""
107.86	that brought me up short,
112.46	because I will never tell a woman
112.46	what she should do with her body.
118.62	Babies survive and thrive
120.42	because their mother's milk
120.42	is food, medicine and signal.
125.1	For young infants,
126.34	mother's milk is a complete diet
128.3	that provides all the building
128.3	blocks for their bodies,
130.9	that shapes their brain
132.3	and fuels all of their activity.
135.18	Mother's milk also feeds the microbes
137.62	that are colonizing
137.62	the infant's intestinal tract.
140.66	Mothers aren't just eating for two,
142.38	they're eating for two to the trillions.
146.38	Milk provides immunofactors
146.38	that help fight pathogens
150.82	and mother's milk provides hormones
150.82	that signal to the infant's body.
156.62	But in recent decades,
158.14	we have come to take milk for granted.
160.3	We stopped seeing
160.3	something in plain sight.
163.3	We began to think of milk as standardized,
163.3	homogenized, pasteurized,
168.46	packaged, powdered,
168.46	flavored and formulated.
172.5	We abandoned the milk of human kindness
174.7	and turned our priorities elsewhere.
178.38	At the National Institutes of Health
180.14	in Washington DC
181.78	is the National Library of Medicine,
184.34	which contains 25 million articles --
187.1	the brain trust of life science
187.1	and biomedical research.
191.9	We can use keywords
191.9	to search that database,
195.3	and when we do that,
196.58	we discover nearly a million
196.58	articles about pregnancy,
200.46	but far fewer about
200.46	breast milk and lactation.
204.66	When we zoom in on the number of articles
204.66	just investigating breast milk,
209.3	we see that we know much more
209.3	about coffee, wine and tomatoes.
213.82	(Laughter)
216.34	We know over twice as much
216.34	about erectile dysfunction.
220.06	(Laughter)
224.06	I'm not saying we shouldn't
224.06	know about those things --
226.66	I'm a scientist, I think
226.66	we should know about everything.
229.38	But that we know so much less --
231.74	(Laughter)
233.54	about breast milk --
234.86	the first fluid a young mammal
234.86	is adapted to consume --
237.66	should make us angry.
239.78	Globally, nine out of 10 women will
239.78	have at least one child in her lifetime.
244.3	That means that nearly 130 million
244.3	babies are born each year.
248.78	These mothers and babies
248.78	deserve our best science.
252.9	Recent research has shown
252.9	that milk doesn't just grow the body,
256.58	it fuels behavior
256.58	and shapes neurodevelopment.
260.62	In 2015, researchers discovered
263.66	that the mixture of breast milk
263.66	and baby saliva --
266.66	specifically, baby saliva --
268.74	causes a chemical reaction
268.74	that produces hydrogen peroxide
272.58	that can kill staph and salmonella.
275.7	And from humans and other mammal species,
277.9	we're starting to understand
277.9	that the biological recipe of milk
281.34	can be different when produced
281.34	for sons or daughters.
285.38	When we reach for donor milk
285.38	in the neonatal intensive care unit,
289.02	or formula on the store shelf,
291.02	it's nearly one-size-fits-all.
293.78	We aren't thinking about how sons
293.78	and daughters may grow at different rates,
298.06	or different ways,
299.3	and that milk may be a part of that.
302.02	Mothers have gotten the message
303.98	and the vast majority of mothers
303.98	intend to breastfeed,
307.42	but many do not reach
307.42	their breastfeeding goals.
311.34	That is not their failure;
313.46	it's ours.
315.58	Increasingly common medical conditions
315.58	like obesity, endocrine disorders,
320.18	C-section and preterm births
321.82	all can disrupt the underlying
321.82	biology of lactation.
325.1	And many women do not have
325.1	knowledgeable clinical support.
329.34	Twenty-five years ago,
330.74	the World Health Organization
330.74	and UNICEF established criteria
334.62	for hospitals to be
334.62	considered baby friendly --
337.22	that provide the optimal level
337.22	of support for mother-infant bonding
341.06	and infant feeding.
343.3	Today, only one in five babies
343.3	in the United States
346.7	is born in a baby-friendly hospital.
351.02	This is a problem,
352.3	because mothers can grapple
352.3	with many problems
355.18	in the minutes, hours, days
355.18	and weeks of lactation.
359.26	They can have struggles
359.26	with establishing latch,
361.78	with pain,
363.02	with milk letdown
364.26	and perceptions of milk supply.
366.82	These mothers deserve
366.82	knowledgeable clinical staff
371.34	that understand these processes.
374.3	Mothers will call me as they're
374.3	grappling with these struggles,
378.7	crying with wobbly voices.
383.22	"""It's not working."
385.06	This is what I'm supposed
385.06	to naturally be able to do.
387.74	"Why is it not working?"""
390.06	And just because something
390.06	is evolutionarily ancient
393.66	doesn't mean that it's easy
393.66	or that we're instantly good at it.
397.38	You know what else
397.38	is evolutionarily ancient?
400.06	(Laughter)
404.02	Sex.
405.34	And nobody expects us
405.34	to start out being good at it.
408.3	(Laughter)
411.3	Clinicians best deliver
411.3	quality equitable care
415.86	when they have continuing education
417.9	about how to best support
417.9	lactation and breastfeeding.
421.66	And in order to have
421.66	that continuing education,
423.9	we need to anchor it
423.9	to cutting-edge research
426.06	in both the life sciences
426.06	and the social sciences,
429.58	because we need to recognize
431.3	that too often
433.46	historical traumas and implicit biases
436.9	sit in the space between
436.9	a new mother and her clinician.
441.5	The body is political.
444.58	If our breastfeeding support
444.58	is not intersectional,
448.3	it's not good enough.
450.94	And for moms who have to return for work,
453.94	because countries like the United States
453.94	do not provide paid parental leave,
458.98	they can have to go back in as short
458.98	as just a few days after giving birth.
464.22	How do we optimize
464.22	mother and infant health
467.58	just by messaging
467.58	about breast milk to moms
470.94	without providing
470.94	the institutional support
473.74	that facilitates
473.74	that mother-infant bonding
476.42	to support breastfeeding?
478.5	The answer is: we can't.
482.82	I'm talking to you, legislators,
485.3	and the voters who elect them.
487.26	I'm talking to you, job creators
487.26	and collective bargaining units,
491.98	and workers, and shareholders.
495.18	We all have a stake
495.18	in the public health of our community,
499.14	and we all have a role
499.14	to play in achieving it.
503.02	Breast milk is a part
503.02	of improving human health.
506.82	In the NICU, when infants are born
506.82	early or sick or injured,
510.86	milk or bioactive constituents in milk
510.86	can be critically important.
515.18	Environments or ecologies,
516.62	or communities where there's
516.62	high risk of infectious disease,
519.86	breast milk can be incredibly protective.
522.34	Where there are emergencies
522.34	like storms and earthquakes,
525.979	when the electricity goes out,
527.499	when safe water is not available,
529.499	breast milk can keep babies
529.499	fed and hydrated.
534.18	And in the context of humanitarian crises,
536.9	like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,
540.06	the smallest drops can buffer babies
540.06	from the biggest global challenges.
547.3	But understanding breast milk
547.3	is not just about messaging to mothers
552.06	and policy makers.
553.9	It's also about understanding
553.9	what is important in breast milk
557.02	so that we can deliver better formulas
559.82	to moms who cannot or do not
559.82	breastfeed for whatever reason.
564.26	We can all do a better job
566.1	of supporting the diversity
566.1	of moms raising their babies
569.42	in a diversity of ways.
572.5	As women around the world struggle
574.38	to achieve political,
574.38	social and economic equality,
578.06	we must reimagine motherhood
580.62	as not the central,
580.62	core aspect of womanhood,
585.86	but one of the many potential facets
585.86	of what makes women awesome.
590.9	It's time.
592.86	(Applause)
