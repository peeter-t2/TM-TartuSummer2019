12.58	Chris Anderson: So Robert
12.58	spent the last few years
15.3	think about how weird human behavior is,
17.66	and how inadequate most
17.66	of our language trying to explain it is.
21.9	And it's very exciting to hear him
21.9	explain some of the thinking behind it
26.3	in public for the first time.
27.98	Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.
30.1	(Applause)
34.86	Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.
36.5	The fantasy always runs
36.5	something like this.
39.78	I've overpowered his elite guard,
41.98	burst into his secret bunker
43.939	with my machine gun ready.
45.78	He lunges for his Luger.
47.7	I knock it out of his hand.
49.54	He lunges for his cyanide pill.
51.9	I knock that out of his hand.
53.66	He snarls,
54.98	comes at me with otherworldly strength.
57.22	We grapple, we fight,
58.94	I manage to pin him down
60.86	and put on handcuffs.
63.3	"""Adolf Hitler,"" I say,"
65.34	"""I arrest you for crimes"
65.34	"against humanity."""
69.82	Here's where the Medal of Honor
69.82	version of the fantasy ends
72.82	and the imagery darkens.
74.7	What would I do if I had Hitler?
76.98	It's not hard to imagine
76.98	once I allow myself.
80.54	Sever his spine at the neck.
82.7	Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.
85.1	Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.
87.9	Leave him alive on a respirator,
90.06	tube-fed, not able to speak
90.06	or move or see or hear, just to feel,
95.38	and then inject him
95.38	with something cancerous
98.66	that's going to fester and pustulate
100.94	until every cell in his body
100.94	is screaming in agony,
104.9	until every second
104.9	feels like an eternity in hell.
109.5	That's what I would do to Hitler.
113.74	I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,
115.78	still do sometimes,
117.3	and when I do, my heart speeds up --
119.98	all these plans for the most evil,
119.98	wicked soul in history.
125.66	But there's a problem,
126.94	which is I don't actually believe
126.94	in souls or evil,
129.86	and I think wicked belongs in a musical.
132.42	But there's some people
132.42	I would like to see killed,
134.86	but I'm against the death penalty.
136.7	But I like schlocky violent movies,
138.82	but I'm for strict gun control.
140.62	But then there was a time
140.62	I was at a laser tag place,
143.7	and I had such a good time
143.7	hiding in a corner shooting at people.
148.18	In other words, I'm your basic
148.18	confused human when it comes to violence.
153.58	Now, as a species, we obviously
153.58	have problems with violence.
156.94	We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,
160.02	letters with anthrax,
160.02	airplanes as weapons,
163.14	mass rape as a military strategy.
165.02	We're a miserably violent species.
167.74	But there's a complication,
169.26	which is we don't hate violence,
171.66	we hate the wrong kind.
173.54	And when it's the right kind,
175.02	we cheer it on, we hand out medals,
177.54	we vote for, we mate with
177.54	our champions of it.
180.7	When it's the right kind of violence,
182.54	we love it.
184.34	And there's another complication,
186.02	which is, in addition to us
186.02	being this miserably violent species,
190.1	we're also this extraordinarily
190.1	altruistic, compassionate one.
195.34	So how do you make sense
195.34	of the biology of our best behaviors,
198.66	our worst ones and all of those
198.66	ambiguously in between?
202.7	Now, for starters,
203.98	what's totally boring is understanding
203.98	the motoric aspects of the behavior.
208.3	Your brain tells your spine,
208.3	tells your muscles
211.5	to do something or other,
212.78	and hooray, you've behaved.
214.74	What's hard is understanding
214.74	the meaning of the behavior,
218.42	because in some settings,
218.42	pulling a trigger is an appalling act;
222.26	in others, it's heroically
222.26	self-sacrificial.
225.26	In some settings, putting your hand
225.26	one someone else's
228.22	is deeply compassionate.
229.7	In others, it's a deep betrayal.
231.62	The challenge is to understand
233.18	the biology of the context
233.18	of our behaviors,
236.46	and that's real tough.
238.86	One thing that's clear, though,
238.86	is you're not going to get anywhere
242.06	if you think there's going to be
242.06	the brain region or the hormone
246.5	or the gene or the childhood experience
249.26	or the evolutionary mechanism
249.26	that explains everything.
252.86	Instead, every bit of behavior
252.86	has multiple levels of causality.
258.62	Let's look at an example.
260.66	You have a gun.
262.54	There's a crisis going on:
264.14	rioting, violence, people running around.
266.74	A stranger is running at you
266.74	in an agitated state --
269.94	you can't quite tell if the expression
269.94	is frightened, threatening, angry --
275.06	holding something
275.06	that kind of looks like a handgun.
278.3	You're not sure.
279.54	The stranger comes running at you
281.46	and you pull the trigger.
283.22	And it turns out
283.22	that thing in this person's hand
286.18	was a cell phone.
288.02	So we asked this biological question:
290.26	what was going on
290.26	that caused this behavior?
293.46	What caused this behavior?
295.38	And this is a multitude of questions.
297.7	We start.
298.94	What was going on in your brain
298.94	one second before you pulled that trigger?
303.38	And this brings us into the realm
303.38	of a brain region called the amygdala.
307.1	The amygdala, which is
307.1	central to violence, central to fear,
311.06	initiates volleys of cascades
313.78	that produce pulling of a trigger.
316.06	What was the level of activity
316.06	in your amygdala one second before?
320.7	But to understand that,
320.7	we have to step back a little bit.
324.1	What was going on in the environment
324.1	seconds to minutes before
327.7	that impacted the amygdala?
329.46	Now, obviously, the sights,
329.46	the sounds of the rioting,
332.58	that was pertinent.
333.82	But in addition,
335.06	you're more likely to mistake
335.06	a cell phone for a handgun
338.54	if that stranger was male
340.82	and large and of a different race.
344.18	Furthermore, if you're in pain,
346.34	if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,
348.54	your frontal cortex
348.54	is not going to work as well,
351.1	part of the brain whose job it is
351.1	to get to the amygdala in time
354.78	"saying, ""Are you really sure"
354.78	"that's a gun there?"""
358.62	But we need to step further back.
360.78	Now we have to look
360.78	at hours to days before,
363.98	and with this, we have entered
363.98	the realm of hormones.
366.98	For example, testosterone,
369.14	where regardless of your sex,
370.9	if you have elevated
370.9	testosterone levels in your blood,
373.78	you're more likely to think
373.78	a face with a neutral expression
377.18	is instead looking threatening.
379.26	Elevated testosterone levels,
379.26	elevated levels of stress hormones,
383.14	and your amygdala
383.14	is going to be more active
385.46	and your frontal cortex
385.46	will be more sluggish.
389.02	Pushing back further,
389.02	weeks to months before,
391.9	where's the relevance there?
393.38	This is the realm of neural plasticity,
395.94	the fact that your brain
395.94	can change in response to experience,
399.9	and if your previous months
399.9	have been filled with stress and trauma,
404.1	your amygdala will have enlarged.
405.98	The neurons will have become
405.98	more excitable,
408.22	your frontal cortex would have atrophied,
410.58	all relevant to what happens
410.58	in that one second.
414.14	But we push back even more, back years,
416.82	back, for example, to your adolescence.
419.34	Now, the central fact
419.34	of the adolescent brain
421.86	is all of it is going full blast
424.62	except the frontal cortex,
426.34	which is still half-baked.
428.1	It doesn't fully mature
428.1	until you're around 25.
431.3	And thus, adolescence and early adulthood
434.54	are the years where environment
434.54	and experience sculpt your frontal cortex
439.7	into the version you're going to have
439.7	as an adult in that critical moment.
444.62	But pushing back even further,
446.42	even further back
446.42	to childhood and fetal life
449.9	and all the different versions
449.9	that that could come in.
452.74	Now, obviously, that's the time
452.74	that your brain is being constructed,
456.02	and that's important,
457.26	but in addition,
457.26	experience during those times
460.58	produce what are called
460.58	epigenetic changes,
463.58	permanent, in some cases,
465.26	permanently activating
465.26	certain genes, turning off others.
469.62	And as an example of this,
471.14	if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot
471.14	of stress hormones through your mother,
476.18	epigenetics is going to produce
476.18	your amygdala in adulthood
479.62	as a more excitable form,
481.58	and you're going to have
481.58	elevated stress hormone levels.
484.78	But pushing even further back,
486.7	back to when you were just a fetus,
488.42	back to when all you were
488.42	was a collection of genes.
491.26	Now, genes are really
491.26	important to all of this,
493.66	but critically, genes don't
493.66	determine anything,
496.42	because genes work differently
496.42	in different environments.
500.46	Key example here:
501.74	there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,
504.9	and if you have that variant,
506.58	you are far more likely
506.58	to commit antisocial violence
511.26	if, and only if,
511.26	you were abused as a child.
515.26	Genes and environment interact,
517.66	and what's happening in that one second
517.66	before you pull that trigger
521.3	reflects your lifetime
521.3	of those gene-environment interactions.
526.499	Now, remarkably enough,
526.499	we've got to push even further back now,
530.14	back centuries.
531.54	What were your ancestors up to.
533.9	And if, for example,
533.9	they were nomadic pastoralists,
537.1	they were pastoralists,
538.38	people living in deserts or grasslands
540.98	with their herds of camels, cows, goats,
543.66	odds are they would have invented
543.66	what's called a culture of honor
547.74	filled with warrior classes,
549.98	retributive violence, clan vendettas,
552.7	and amazingly, centuries later,
554.98	that would still be influencing
554.98	the values with which you were raised.
559.62	But we've got to push even further back,
561.78	back millions of years,
563.54	because if we're talking about genes,
565.62	implicitly we're now talking
565.62	about the evolution of genes.
569.3	And what you see is, for example,
571.54	patterns across different primate species.
574.06	Some of them have evolved
574.06	for extremely low levels of aggression,
578.5	others have evolved
578.5	in the opposite direction,
581.06	and floating there in between
581.06	by every measure are humans,
584.98	once again this confused,
584.98	barely defined species
588.9	that has all these potentials
588.9	to go one way or the other.
593.38	So what has this gotten us to?
595.22	Basically, what we're seeing here is,
597.22	if you want to understand a behavior,
599.14	whether it's an appalling one,
599.14	a wondrous one,
602.02	or confusedly in between,
603.78	if you want to understand that,
605.34	you've got take into account
605.34	what happened a second before
608.82	to a million years before,
610.3	everything in between.
611.98	So what can we conclude at this point?
613.98	Officially, it's complicated.
616.3	Wow, that's really helpful.
617.94	It's complicated,
619.22	and you'd better be
619.22	real careful, real cautious
622.82	before you conclude
622.82	you know what causes a behavior,
626.18	especially if it's a behavior
626.18	you're judging harshly.
630.42	Now, to me, the single most important
630.42	point about all of this
634.42	is one having to do with change.
636.82	Every bit of biology I have mentioned here
636.82	can change in different circumstances.
643.22	For example, ecosystems change.
646.06	Thousands of years ago,
646.06	the Sahara was a lush grassland.
650.5	Cultures change.
652.14	In the 17th century, the most terrifying
652.14	people in Europe were the Swedes,
656.5	rampaging all over the place.
658.26	This is what the Swedish
658.26	military does now.
660.46	They haven't had a war in 200 years.
663.1	Most importantly,
664.58	brains change.
666.22	Neurons grow new processes.
668.26	Circuits disconnect.
669.74	Everything in the brain changes,
671.42	and out of this come extraordinary
671.42	examples of human change.
677.22	First one:
678.86	this is a man named John Newton,
680.58	a British theologian
681.94	who played a central role in the abolition
681.94	of slavery from the British Empire
686.7	in the early 1800s.
688.74	And amazingly, this man
688.74	spent decades as a younger man
693.5	as the captain of a slave ship,
695.66	and then as an investor in slavery,
698.62	growing rich from this.
700.78	And then something changed.
703.46	Something changed in him,
705.02	something that Newton himself celebrated
705.02	in the thing that he's most famous for,
710.3	a hymn that he wrote:
711.94	"""Amazing Grace."""
714.86	This is a man named Zenji Abe
714.86	on the morning of December 6, 1941,
719.78	about to lead a squadron of Japanese
719.78	bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.
724.78	And this is the same man
728.34	hugging a man who survived
728.34	the attack on the ground.
731.94	And as an old man,
733.38	Zenji Abe came to a collection
733.38	of Pearl Harbor survivors
737.82	at a ceremony there
739.26	and in halting English apologized
739.26	for what he had done as a young man.
744.58	Now, it doesn't always require decades.
746.5	Sometimes, extraordinary change
746.5	could happen in just hours.
750.22	Consider the World War I
750.22	Christmas truce of 1914.
754.62	The powers that be
754.62	had negotiated a brief truce
757.78	so that soldiers could go out,
759.42	collect bodies from no-man's-land
759.42	in between the trench lines.
763.34	And soon British and German soldiers
766.3	were doing that,
767.78	and then helping each other carry bodies,
770.26	and then helping each other
770.26	dig graves in the frozen ground,
773.94	and then praying together,
775.22	and then having Christmas together
775.22	and exchanging gifts,
778.06	and by the next day,
778.06	they were playing soccer together
781.3	and exchanging addresses
781.3	so they could meet after the war.
784.7	That truce kept going
784.7	until the officers had to arrive
788.7	"and said, ""We will shoot you"
790.22	unless you go back
790.22	"to trying to kill each other."""
792.74	And all it took here was hours
794.9	for these men to develop
794.9	"a completely new category of ""us,"""
799.26	all of us in the trenches here
801.18	on both sides, dying for no damn reason,
803.98	"and who is a ""them,"""
803.98	those faceless powers behind the lines
807.66	who were using them as pawns.
810.5	And sometimes,
810.5	change can occur in seconds.
814.54	Probably the most horrifying event
814.54	in the Vietnam War
817.9	was the My Lai Massacre.
819.82	A brigade of American soldiers
821.86	went into an undefended
821.86	village full of civilians
824.9	and killed between 350 and 500 of them,
828.46	mass-raped women and children,
831.34	mutilated bodies.
832.94	It was appalling.
834.18	It was appalling because it occurred,
834.18	because the government denied it,
838.46	because the US government eventually
838.46	did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,
842.86	and appalling because it almost certainly
842.86	was not a singular event.
847.14	This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man
847.14	who stopped the My Lai Massacre.
852.26	He was piloting a helicopter gunship,
854.9	landed there, got out
856.74	and saw American soldiers shooting babies,
859.82	shooting old women,
861.22	figured out what was going on,
863.14	and he then took his helicopter
865.26	and did something that undid
865.26	his lifetime of conditioning
869.26	"as to who is an ""us"" and who is a ""them."""
871.34	He landed his helicopter
873.22	in between some surviving villagers
873.22	and American soldiers
876.86	and he trained his machine guns
876.86	on his fellow Americans,
880.54	"and said, ""If you don't stop the killing,"
880.54	"I will mow you down."""
886.38	Now, these people
886.38	are no more special than any of us.
889.38	Same neurons, same neurochemicals,
891.98	same biology.
894.22	What we're left with here
894.22	is this inevitable cliche:
897.62	"""Those who don't study history"
897.62	"are destined to repeat it."""
900.38	What we have here is the opposite of it.
902.58	Those who don't study the history
902.58	of extraordinary human change,
906.86	those who don't study the biology
906.86	of what can transform us
910.42	from our worst to our best behaviors,
912.94	those who don't do this
912.94	are destined not to be able
916.02	to repeat these incandescent,
916.02	magnificent moments.
920.3	So thank you.
921.86	(Applause)
931.86	CA: Talks that really give you
931.86	a new mental model about something,
935.38	those are some of my favorite TED Talks,
937.34	and we just got one.
939.78	Robert, thank you so much for that.
939.78	Good luck with the book.
942.66	That was amazing,
943.94	and we're going to try and get you
943.94	to come here in person one year.
947.14	Thank you so much.
948.38	RS: Thank you. Thank you all.
