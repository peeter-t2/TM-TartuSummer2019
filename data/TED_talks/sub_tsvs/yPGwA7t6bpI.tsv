12.745	To give me an idea of how many of you here
14.974	may find what I'm about to tell you
17.096	of practical value,
18.721	let me ask you please to raise your hands:
21.41	Who here is either over 65 years old
24.977	or hopes to live past age 65
28.746	or has parents or grandparents who did live
31.691	or have lived past 65,
33.658	raise your hands please. (Laughter)
36.243	Okay. You are the people to whom my talk
38.397	will be of practical value. (Laughter)
40.831	The rest of you
42.488	won't find my talk personally relevant,
44.276	but I think that you will still find the subject
46.19	fascinating.
47.837	I'm going to talk about growing older
49.469	in traditional societies.
51.888	This subject constitutes just one chapter
54.634	of my latest book, which compares
57.225	traditional, small, tribal societies
60.442	with our large, modern societies,
62.992	with respect to many topics
64.617	such as bringing up children,
66.476	growing older, health, dealing with danger,
70.397	settling disputes, religion
72.742	and speaking more than one language.
75.533	Those tribal societies, which constituted
78.09	all human societies for most of human history,
81.075	are far more diverse than are our modern,
84.369	recent, big societies.
86.536	All big societies that have governments,
88.899	and where most people are strangers to each other,
91.165	are inevitably similar to each other
93.513	and different from tribal societies.
96.361	Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments
99.672	in how to run a human society.
102.221	They constitute experiments from which we ourselves
105.028	may be able to learn.
107.43	Tribal societies shouldn't be scorned
109.45	as primitive and miserable,
111.186	but also they shouldn't be romanticized
113.557	as happy and peaceful.
115.774	When we learn of tribal practices,
118.033	some of them will horrify us,
119.807	but there are other tribal practices which,
122.357	when we hear about them,
123.706	we may admire and envy
125.653	and wonder whether we could adopt those practices
127.877	ourselves.
130.574	Most old people in the U.S. end up living
133.661	separately from their children
135.648	and from most of their friends
137.154	of their earlier years,
138.846	and often they live in separate
138.846	retirements homes for the elderly,
142.7	whereas in traditional societies,
144.908	older people instead live out their lives
147.742	among their children, their other relatives,
149.908	and their lifelong friends.
152.305	Nevertheless, the treatment of the elderly
154.474	varies enormously among traditional societies,
157.639	from much worse to much better
159.82	than in our modern societies.
162.778	At the worst extreme, many traditional societies
165.575	get rid of their elderly
167.388	in one of four increasingly direct ways:
170.919	by neglecting their elderly
172.582	and not feeding or cleaning them until they die,
176.011	or by abandoning them when the group moves,
179.065	or by encouraging older people to commit suicide,
182.204	or by killing older people.
185.249	In which tribal societies do children
187.998	abandon or kill their parents?
190.384	It happens mainly under two conditions.
193.408	One is in nomadic, hunter-gather societies
196.388	that often shift camp
198.111	and that are physically incapable
200.29	of transporting old people who can't walk
203.413	when the able-bodied younger people already
205.973	have to carry their young children
207.908	and all their physical possessions.
210.726	The other condition is in societies
212.89	living in marginal or fluctuating environments,
216.2	such as the Arctic or deserts,
218.533	where there are periodic food shortages,
221.117	and occasionally there just isn't enough food
223.046	to keep everyone alive.
225.526	Whatever food is available has to be reserved
227.95	for able-bodied adults and for children.
232.275	To us Americans, it sounds horrible
235.175	to think of abandoning or killing
237.408	your own sick wife or husband
239.589	or elderly mother or father,
241.888	but what could those traditional societies
245.647	do differently?
247.13	They face a cruel situation of no choice.
250.95	Their old people had to do it to their own parents,
253.945	and the old people know
255.233	what now is going to happen to them.
258.384	At the opposite extreme
260.198	in treatment of the elderly, the happy extreme,
262.877	are the New Guinea farming societies
264.864	where I've been doing my fieldwork 
264.864	for the past 50 years,
267.861	and most other sedentary traditional societies
271.108	around the world.
273.194	In those societies, older people are cared for.
276.142	They are fed. They remain valuable.
278.492	And they continue to live in the same hut
280.68	or else in a nearby hut near their children,
283.367	relatives and lifelong friends.
287.266	There are two main sets of reasons for this variation
289.698	among societies in their treatment
292.053	of old people.
293.45	The variation depends especially
295.087	on the usefulness of old people
297.357	and on the society's values.
300.07	First, as regards usefulness,
302.393	older people continue to perform useful services.
305.848	One use of older people in traditional societies
308.533	is that they often are still effective
310.533	at producing food.
312.946	Another traditional usefulness of older people
315.359	is that they are capable of babysitting
318.638	their grandchildren,
320.332	thereby freeing up their own adult children,
323.002	the parents of those grandchildren,
324.873	to go hunting and gathering
324.873	food for the grandchildren.
328.346	Still another traditional value of older people
330.551	is in making tools, weapons, baskets,
333.471	pots and textiles.
335.428	In fact, they're usually the people who are best at it.
338.677	Older people usually are the leaders
341.445	of traditional societies,
343.294	and the people most knowledgeable about politics,
346.553	medicine, religion, songs and dances.
350.552	Finally, older people in traditional societies
353.004	have a huge significance that would never occur
356.931	to us in our modern, literate societies,
360.607	where our sources of information are books
363.022	and the Internet.
364.706	In contrast, in traditional societies without writing,
368.129	older people are the repositories of information.
371.815	It's their knowledge that spells the difference
374.38	between survival and death for their whole society
378.13	in a time of crisis caused by rare events
381.388	for which only the oldest people alive
383.983	have had experience.
386.272	Those, then, are the ways in which older people
388.742	are useful in traditional societies.
391.645	Their usefulness varies and contributes
394.207	to variation in the society's treatment
396.825	of the elderly.
398.825	The other set of reasons for variation
400.644	in the treatment of the elderly is
402.519	the society's cultural values.
405.754	For example, there's particular emphasis
407.78	on respect for the elderly in East Asia,
410.989	associated with Confucius' doctrine
413.9	of filial piety, which means obedience,
417.45	respect and support for elderly parents.
421.544	Cultural values that emphasize
421.544	respect for older people
425.257	contrast with the low status of the elderly
428.074	in the U.S.
430.236	Older Americans are at a big disadvantage
432.794	in job applications.
434.907	They're at a big disadvantage in hospitals.
437.442	Our hospitals have an explicit policy
440.065	called age-based allocation of healthcare resources.
445.032	That sinister expression means that
447.805	if hospital resources are limited,
450.011	for example if only one donor heart
452.061	becomes available for transplant,
454.359	or if a surgeon has time to operate
456.461	on only a certain number of patients,
458.972	American hospitals have an explicit policy
461.922	of giving preference to younger patients
464.242	over older patients
465.722	on the grounds that younger patients are considered
468.966	more valuable to society
470.783	because they have more years of life ahead of them,
473.428	even though the younger patients have fewer years
476.088	of valuable life experience behind them.
480.07	There are several reasons for this low status
482.298	of the elderly in the U.S.
484.64	One is our Protestant work ethic
487.825	which places high value on work,
490.138	so older people who are no longer working
492.361	aren't respected.
494.344	Another reason is our American emphasis
497.201	on the virtues of self-reliance and independence,
500.584	so we instinctively look down on older people
503.653	who are no longer self-reliant and independent.
507.25	Still a third reason is our American cult of youth,
511.351	which shows up even in our advertisements.
514.159	Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict
517.423	smiling young people,
518.978	even though old as well as young people
520.948	buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer.
523.27	Just think, what's the last time you saw
525.273	a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people
530.899	Instead, the only American ads
532.705	featuring white-haired old people
534.711	are ads for retirement homes and pension planning.
538.576	Well, what has changed in the status
540.626	of the elderly today
542.609	compared to their status in traditional societies?
545.998	There have been a few changes for the better
547.868	and more changes for the worse.
550.073	Big changes for the better
551.674	include the fact that today we enjoy
553.825	much longer lives,
555.809	much better health in our old age,
558.103	and much better recreational opportunities.
561.741	Another change for the better is that we now have
564.011	specialized retirement facilities
566.851	and programs to take care of old people.
570.202	Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality
573.07	that we now have
574.759	more old people and fewer young people
577.333	than at any time in the past.
580.017	That means that all those old people
581.768	are more of a burden on the few young people,
584.193	and that each old person has less individual value.
588.679	Another big change for the worse
588.679	in the status of the elderly
591.863	is the breaking of social ties with age,
594.54	because older people, their children,
596.384	and their friends,
597.7	all move and scatter independently of each other
600.55	many times during their lives.
602.804	We Americans move on the average
604.617	every five years.
606.57	Hence our older people are likely
608.601	to end up living distant from their children
610.908	and the friends of their youth.
613.711	Yet another change for the worse
613.711	in the status of the elderly
616.873	is formal retirement from the workforce,
620.603	carrying with it a loss of work friendships
623.353	and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work.
627.493	Perhaps the biggest change for the worse
629.978	is that our elderly are objectively
632.851	less useful than in traditional societies.
636.013	Widespread literacy means that they are no longer
638.976	useful as repositories of knowledge.
641.607	When we want some information,
643.55	we look it up in a book or we Google it
645.811	instead of finding some old person to ask.
649.281	The slow pace of technological change
651.368	in traditional societies
653.19	means that what someone learns there as a child
656.04	is still useful when that person is old,
658.699	but the rapid pace of technological change today
662.302	means that what we learn as children
664.369	is no longer useful 60 years later.
667.259	And conversely, we older people are not fluent
669.638	in the technologies essential for surviving
672.672	in modern society.
674.643	For example, as a 15-year-old,
676.816	I was considered outstandingly
676.816	good at multiplying numbers
680.406	because I had memorized the multiplication tables
683.601	and I know how to use logarithms
685.746	and I'm quick at manipulating a slide rule.
688.609	Today, though, those skills are utterly useless
691.695	because any idiot
694.066	can now multiply eight-digit numbers
696.424	accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator.
699.611	Conversely, I at age 75
701.781	am incompetent at skills
704.445	essential for everyday life.
706.899	My family's first TV set in 1948
709.683	had only three knobs that I quickly mastered:
712.736	an on-off switch, a volume knob,
715.486	and a channel selector knob.
717.707	Today, just to watch a program
719.795	on the TV set in my own house,
722.251	I have to operate a 41-button TV remote
725.968	that utterly defeats me.
727.95	I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons
730.964	and ask them to talk me through it
733.161	while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons.
738.158	What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly
740.805	in the U.S., and to make better use of their value?
744.259	That's a huge problem.
746.033	In my remaining four minutes today,
748.504	I can offer just a few suggestions.
751.081	One value of older people is that they are
753.003	increasingly useful as grandparents
756.447	for offering high-quality childcare
758.954	to their grandchildren, if they choose to do it,
761.607	as more young women enter the workforce
764.456	and as fewer young parents of either gender
766.79	stay home as full-time caretakers of their children.
770.45	Compared to the usual alternatives
772.486	of paid babysitters and day care centers,
776.084	grandparents offer superior, motivated,
779.211	experienced child care.
781.899	They've already gained experience
781.899	from raising their own children.
785.165	They usually love their grandchildren,
787.509	and are eager to spend time with them.
790.174	Unlike other caregivers,
792.075	grandparents don't quit their job
794.972	because they found another job with higher pay
797.408	looking after another baby.
800.921	A second value of older people is paradoxically
803.325	related to their loss of value
805.986	as a result of changing world
805.986	conditions and technology.
810.059	At the same time, older people have gained
812.095	in value today precisely because
814.406	of their unique experience of living conditions
817.515	that have now become rare
819.234	because of rapid change, but that could come back.
822.544	For example, only Americans now in their 70s
825.498	or older today can remember
827.758	the experience of living through a great depression,
831.086	the experience of living through a world war,
833.724	and agonizing whether or not
836.27	dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible
839.307	than the likely consequences
839.307	of not dropping atomic bombs.
843.42	Most of our current voters and politicians
845.696	have no personal experience of any of those things,
848.428	but millions of older Americans do.
851.123	Unfortunately, all of those terrible situations
853.774	could come back.
855.161	Even if they don't come back,
856.467	we have to be able to plan for them
858.659	on the basis of the experience of what they were like.
861.47	Older people have that experience.
863.304	Younger people don't.
865.357	The remaining value of older people
866.877	that I'll mention involves recognizing that
869.32	while there are many things that older people
871.9	can no longer do,
873.506	there are other things that they can do
874.995	better than younger people.
877.09	A challenge for society is 
877.09	to make use of those things
879.986	that older people are better at doing.
882.458	Some abilities, of course, decrease with age.
885.707	Those include abilities at tasks
888.345	requiring physical strength and stamina,
891.916	ambition, and the power of novel reasoning
895.04	in a circumscribed situation,
897.465	such as figuring out the structure of DNA,
900.053	best left to scientists under the age of 30.
903.954	Conversely, valuable attributes
905.603	that increase with age include experience,
909.149	understanding of people and human relationships,
912.162	ability to help other people
914.453	without your own ego getting in the way,
916.881	and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases,
920.406	such as economics and comparative history,
923.231	best left to scholars over the age of 60.
926.445	Hence older people are
926.445	much better than younger people
928.917	at supervising, administering, advising,
932.888	strategizing, teaching, synthesizing,
936.37	and devising long-term plans.
939.076	I've seen this value of older people
941.096	with so many of my friends in their 60s,
945.658	who are still active as investment managers,
948.943	farmers, lawyers and doctors.
951.956	In short, many traditional societies
954.086	make better use of their elderly
956.199	and give their elderly more satisfying lives
959.309	than we do in modern, big societies.
962.159	Paradoxically nowadays,
964.024	when we have more elderly people than ever before,
966.95	living healthier lives and with better medical care
969.671	than ever before,
971.157	old age is in some respects more miserable
973.864	than ever before.
975.631	The lives of the elderly are widely recognized
978.053	as constituting a disaster area
980.82	of modern American society.
983.353	We can surely do better by learning
985.034	from the lives of the elderly
986.909	in traditional societies.
988.921	But what's true of the lives of the elderly
990.863	in traditional societies
992.327	is true of many other features
994.022	of traditional societies as well.
996.616	Of course, I'm not advocating that we all give up
999.205	agriculture and metal tools
1001.32	and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
1004.404	There are many obvious respects
1005.948	in which our lives today are far happier
1008.427	than those in small, traditional societies.
1011.489	To mention just a few examples,
1013.195	our lives are longer, materially much richer,
1016.165	and less plagued by violence
1018.448	than are the lives of people in traditional societies.
1021.676	But there are also things to be admired
1024.204	about people in traditional societies,
1026.346	and perhaps to be learned from them.
1028.665	Their lives are usually socially much richer
1031.256	than our lives,
1032.848	although materially poorer.
1035.14	Their children are more self-confident,
1038.092	more independent, and more socially skilled
1040.686	than are our children.
1043.022	They think more realistically
1043.022	about dangers than we do.
1046.765	They almost never die of diabetes, heart disease,
1050.294	stroke, and the other noncommunicable diseases
1053.528	that will be the causes of death of almost
1056.04	all of us in this room today.
1059.126	Features of the modern lifestyle
1059.126	predispose us to those diseases,
1063.136	and features of the traditional lifestyle
1065.37	protect us against them.
1067.877	Those are just some examples of what we can learn
1070.036	from traditional societies.
1072.324	I hope that you will find it as fascinating
1074.211	to read about traditional societies
1076.62	as I found it to live in those societies.
1079.323	Thank you.
1081.503	(Applause)
