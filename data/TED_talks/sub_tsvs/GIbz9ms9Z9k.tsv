15.732	"Those of you who have seen the film ""Moneyball,"""
19.427	or have read the book by Michael Lewis,
21.411	will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.
24.547	Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer; all the scouts told him so.
29.235	They told his parents that
30.428	they predicted that he was going to be a star.
32.467	But what actually happened when he signed the contract -- and by the way, he didn't
37.419	want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to
37.419	college --
39.843	which is what my mother, who actually does
39.843	love me,
42.5	said that I should do too, and I did --
45.364	well, he didn't do very well. He struggled
45.364	mightily.
48.438	He got traded a couple of times, he ended up in the Minors for most of his career,
52.971	and he actually ended up in management. He ended up as a General Manager of the
57.059	Oakland A's.
57.708	Now for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done,
62.132	is seen as a success.
63.828	I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the Bigs,
67.03	going into management ain't no success story. It's a failure.
71.739	And what I want to talk to you about today, and share with you, is that our
76.178	healthcare system, our medical system, is
76.178	just as bad at predicting
80.618	what happens to people in it -- patients,
80.618	others --
84.81	as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Beane.
89.423	And yet, every day
92.104	thousands of people in this country
94.065	are diagnosed with preconditions.
97.991	We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia,
102.231	we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with
107.567	that in the green room.
108.944	We also refer to subclinical conditions.
113.297	There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries,
117.848	obviously linked to heart attacks, potentially.
121.383	One of my favorites is called
121.383	subclinical acne.
124.816	If you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did,
128.783	which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.
132.912	You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.
139.527	Maybe that's because you don't actually
139.527	have acne.
143.183	I have a name for all of these conditions, it's another precondition:
149.706	I call them preposterous.
151.561	In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.
157.62	Season follows the pre-season.
160.025	But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the
164.548	case all the time. It's as if there's a rain delay, every single time in many cases.
169.121	We have pre-cancerous lesions,
170.939	which often don't turn into cancer.
174.432	And yet,
176.288	if you take, for example, subclinical
176.288	osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease,
180.214	the precondition,
181.867	otherwise known as osteopenia,
184.274	you would have to treat 270
184.274	women for three years
187.944	in order to prevent one broken bone.
190.144	That's an awful lot of women
191.753	when you multiply by the number of women
191.753	who were diagnosed
194.68	with this osteopenia.
196.569	And so is it any wonder,
198.625	given all of the costs and the side effects
201.155	of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions, that every year
205.359	we're spending more than two trillion dollars on healthcare and yet
212.319	not because of the conditions they have,
214.232	but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments?
218.519	We've medicalized everything
221.331	in this country.
222.3	Women in the audience, I have
222.3	some
225.683	pretty bad news that you already know,
227.682	and that's that every aspect of your
227.682	life
230.339	has been medicalized.
231.747	Strike one is when you hit puberty.
234.171	You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.
238.507	It's a condition;
239.323	it has to be treated. Strike two
240.883	is if you get pregnant.
242.483	That's been medicalized as
242.483	well.
245.579	You have to have a high-tech experience
247.499	of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.
250.227	Strike three is menopause.
253.834	We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy
258.171	for menopausal symptoms
261.217	for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one,
265.647	NIH-funded.
266.655	It said,
267.583	actually, a lot of that hormone replacement therapy may be doing more harm than good
272.168	for many of those women.
273.952	Just in case,
276.2	I don't want to leave the men out --
277.832	I am one, after all --
279.448	I have really bad news for all of you in
279.448	this room,
282.137	and for everyone
283.097	listening and watching elsewhere:
284.843	You all have
286.056	a universally fatal condition.
288.992	So, just take a moment.
292.3	It's called pre-death.
293.632	Every single one of you has it, because
293.632	you have the risk factor for it,
298.704	which is being alive.
300.448	But I have some good news for you,
300.448	because
303.506	I'm a journalist, I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.
307.536	And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which
311.465	we'll see if that happens for everyone,
314.057	you will be a pre-vivor.
317.352	I made up pre-death.
322.168	If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize,
326.28	I think I made it up.
327.865	I didn't make up pre-vivor.
329.432	Pre-vivor is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who
334.904	just has a risk factor,
336.176	but hasn't actually had that cancer,
338.698	to call themselves.
340.072	You are a pre-vivor.
341.647	We've had HBO here this morning. I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the
346.12	audience, I'd like to suggest
347.625	"a reality TV show called ""Pre-vivor."""
351.832	If you develop a disease, you're off
351.832	the island.
355.333	But the problem is, we have a system
360.468	that is completely --
362.34	basically promoted this.
364.267	We've selected, at every point in this system,
367.133	to do what we do, and to give everyone a
367.133	precondition and then eventually
371.12	a condition, in some cases.
373.099	Start with the doctor-patient
373.099	relationship. Doctors, most of them,
377.592	are in a fee-for-service system. They are
377.592	basically incentivized to do more --
382.618	procedures, tests,
384.275	prescribe medications.
385.941	Patients come to them,
387.306	they want to do something. We're
387.306	Americans, we can't just stand
391.306	there, we have to do something. And so
391.306	they want a drug.
394.187	They want a treatment. They want to be told, this is what you have and this is how
397.962	you treat it. If the doctor
397.962	doesn't give you that,
400.282	you go somewhere else.
402.106	That's not very good for doctors'
402.106	business.
403.986	Or even worse,
405.674	if you are diagnosed with something
405.674	eventually, and the doctor didn't order that test,
409.633	you get sued.
411.857	We have pharmaceutical companies that are
411.857	constantly trying to expand
414.889	the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for a given treatment,
420.233	because that obviously helps their bottom line.
420.233	We have advocacy groups,
423.026	like the one that's come up with
423.026	pre-vivor,
425.281	who want to make more and more people feel they are at risk, or might have a condition,
429.521	so that they can raise more funds
431.65	and raise visibility, et cetera.
434.265	But this isn't actually,
436.105	despite what journalists typically do,
436.105	this isn't actually about blaming
439.201	particular players.
440.489	We are all responsible.
442.29	I'm responsible.
443.732	I actually root for the Yankees, I mean talk
443.732	about
446.77	rooting for the worst
446.77	possible
449.962	offender when it comes to doing
449.962	everything you can do.
452.572	Thank you.
454.109	But everyone is responsible.
458.073	I went to medical school,
460.978	and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically,
465.73	or How Not to Order Tests.
467.393	We have this system
470.044	where that's what you do.
472.561	And it actually took being a journalist
475.186	to understand all these incentives. You know, economists like to say,
479.089	there are no bad people,
480.308	there are just bad incentives.
482.185	And that's actually true.
483.793	Because what we've created is a sort of Field of Dreams, when it comes to medical technology.
487.26	So when you put another MRI in
487.26	every corner, you put a robot
492.56	in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery.
496.098	Well, we've created a system where if you
496.098	build it, they will come.
499.914	But you can actually perversely
503.441	tell people to come, convince them
506.225	that they have to come.
507.914	It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem,
512.722	and how we all are part of this problem.
514.746	I was medicalizing every risk factor, I was writing stories, commissioning stories,
518.402	every day, that were trying to,
521.795	not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.
524.792	But, you know, there are ways out.
527.815	I saw my own internist last week,
529.687	and he said to me,
532.219	"""You know,"" and he told me something that"
534.736	everyone in this audience could have
534.736	told me for free,
537.21	but I paid him for the privilege, which
537.21	is that
539.698	I need to lose some weight.
541.367	Well, he's right. I've had honest-to-goodness high blood pressure
545.824	for a dozen years now, same
547.537	age my father got it,
549.311	and it's a real disease. It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual
553.098	hypertension, high blood pressure.
555.071	Well, he's right,
556.056	but he didn't say to me,
559.136	well, you have pre-obesity or
560.823	you have pre-diabetes, or anything like that. He didn't say,
564.168	better start taking this Statin, you need to lower your cholesterol.
567.544	"No, he said, ""Go out and lose some weight. Come back and see me in a bit,"
570.703	"or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing."""
572.704	So that's, to me,
574.744	a way forward.
576.375	Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same
576.375	thing.
578.739	He learned,
580.275	from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him,
583.792	that it wasn't swinging for the fences, it
583.792	wasn't swinging at every pitch
588.667	like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to --
593.436	they like to pick up those guys.
594.776	This kid told him, you know, you gotta watch the guys, and you gotta go out and find
599.365	the guys who like to walk,
600.604	because getting on base by a walk
602.308	is just as good, and in our healthcare
602.308	system
605.076	we need to figure out,
606.516	is that really a good pitch
608.092	or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?
611.01	Thanks.
