12.995	Cities are like siblings
12.995	in a large polygamous family.
18.193	Each one has a unique personality
18.193	and is headed in a distinct direction.
23.029	But they all have somewhat shared origins.
26.497	Sometimes I think postcolonial cities
26.497	are like the children
29.568	of the two least-favorite wives,
31.291	who are constantly being asked,
32.899	"""Ah, why can't you be"
32.899	"more like your sister?"""
35.126	(Laughter)
38.101	"The ""why"" of cities is largely the same,"
38.101	no matter where they are:
42.312	an advantageous location that makes
42.312	trade and administration possible;
46.456	the potential for scalable opportunities
48.672	for the skilled and unskilled alike;
51.073	a popular willingness
51.073	to be in constant flux
54.116	and, of course, resilience.
56.587	"The ""how"" of cities, however,"
56.587	is a whole other story.
59.995	How are they run?
61.722	How do they grow?
63.539	How do they decide who belongs
63.539	and who doesn't?
67.571	Lagos is my home.
70.36	You can always find the Nigerians
72.055	by following the noise
72.055	and the dancing, right?
74.309	(Laughter)
75.469	Like any major city,
75.469	that place is a lot of things,
79.333	many of which are highly contradictory.
82.37	Our public transportation
82.37	doesn't quite work,
84.49	so we have these privately owned
84.49	bright yellow buses
87.669	that regularly cause accidents.
90.555	Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained
90.555	and often flooded roads.
95.558	Street evangelism is only
95.558	slightly less ubiquitous
98.401	than street harassment.
100.525	Sex workers sometimes
100.525	have two degrees, a bank job
103.771	and a prominent role in church.
105.603	(Laughter)
106.631	On any given day,
107.817	there can be either a party
107.817	or a burned body
111.17	in the middle of a street.
114.544	There is so much that is possible in Lagos
117.349	and so much that isn't,
118.563	and very often the difference
118.563	between possibility and impossibility
121.8	is simply who you are,
123.438	and if you're lucky enough,
123.438	who you're connected to.
126.672	Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept
128.885	determined by ethnic origin,
128.885	sexual orientation, gender,
133.037	but most visibly and often most violently,
136.396	class.
138.312	Before Nigeria became a country,
140.937	fisherpeople from the inland creeks
140.937	started to come down the Lagos lagoon
144.872	and establish villages along the coast.
147.84	About 60 years later, my grandfather,
147.84	Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,
152.298	also arrived in Lagos.
154.487	Like me, he was an alumnus
154.487	of the University of Ibadan,
157.927	a young member of the educated elite
157.927	in the independence era.
162.082	Over time, he built an illustrious career
162.082	as a land surveyor,
165.699	mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods
167.789	when they were just waist-high wild grass.
171.173	He died when I was nine.
172.603	And by that time, my family,
172.603	like the families of those fisherpeople,
176.414	knew Lagos as home.
179.953	Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,
182.208	"""Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,"""
184.702	which can be translated to mean
184.702	that Lagos will welcome anyone.
189.337	But that saying is becoming
189.337	less and less true.
192.784	Many Lagosians, including
192.784	the descendants of those fisherpeople
195.953	who arrived generations
195.953	before my grandfather,
198.329	are now being pushed out
200.067	to make room for an emergent city
201.794	that has been described
201.794	"as ""the new Dubai."""
205.321	You see, Lagos inspires big dreams,
205.321	even in its leaders,
209.451	and successive governments
209.451	have declared aspirations
212.159	towards a megacity
212.159	where poverty does not exist.
216.033	Unfortunately, instead of focusing
216.033	on the eradication of poverty
219.61	as you would expect,
221.137	the strategy of choice focuses
221.137	on eliminating the poor.
227.059	Last October, the Governor announced plans
229.219	to demolish every single
229.219	waterfront settlement in Lagos.
233.703	There are more than 40
233.703	of these indigenous communities
236.282	all over the city,
237.468	with over 300,000 people living in them.
240.623	Otodo Gbame,
242.271	a hundred-year-old fishing village
244.261	with a population about
244.261	three-quarters that of Monaco
247.219	and similar potential
247.219	for beachfront luxury --
249.88	(Laughter)
250.937	was one of the first to be targeted.
254.513	I first heard of Otodo Gbame
254.513	after the demolition started.
258.655	When I visited in November 2016,
258.655	I met Magdalene Aiyefoju.
263.943	She is a now-homeless woman
265.583	"whose surname means, ""the world is blind."""
269.341	Magdalene's son Basil
269.341	was one of over 20 people
273.256	who were shot, drowned
275.105	or presumed dead in that land grab.
279.452	Standing outside her shelter,
279.452	I saw the two white-sand football fields
282.985	where Basil used to play.
285.47	Spread all around us were the ruins
285.47	of schools, churches,
289.133	a primary health center, shops,
291.277	thousands of homes.
293.712	Young children enthusiastically helped
293.712	to put up shelters,
297.225	and about 5,000 of the residents,
297.225	with nowhere else to go,
300.304	simply stayed put.
302.658	And then in April,
304.773	state security personnel came back.
308.049	This time, they cleared
308.049	the community out completely,
311.554	with beatings, bullets and fire.
315.787	As I speak, there are construction crews
315.787	preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches
320.297	for anyone who can afford
320.297	a multi-million-dollar view.
324.042	The new development
324.042	"is called ""Periwinkle Estate."""
330.208	Forced evictions are incredibly violent
330.208	and, of course, unconstitutional.
335.123	And yet, they happen so often
335.123	in so many of our cities,
338.44	because the first thing we are taught
338.44	to forget about poor people
342.209	is that they are people.
344.412	We believe that a home is a thing
344.412	a person absolutely has a right to,
347.819	unless the person is poor
347.819	and the home is built a certain way
350.817	in a certain neighborhood.
352.711	But there is no single definition
352.711	"of the word ""home."""
357.27	After all, what is a slum
357.27	besides an organic response
360.535	to acute housing deficits
360.535	and income inequality?
364.631	And what is a shanty if not a person
364.631	making a home for themselves
367.838	against all odds?
371.015	Slums are an imperfect housing solution,
373.551	but they are also prime examples
373.551	of the innovation, adaptability
377.268	and resilience at the foundation --
380.018	and the heart --
381.429	of every functional city.
384.303	You don't need to be the new Dubai
386.678	when you're already Lagos.
389.369	(Applause)
396.771	We have our own identity,
398.841	our own rhythm,
400.565	and as anyone who knows
400.565	Lagos can tell you,
402.884	poor Lagosians are very often
402.884	the source of the city's character.
406.928	Without its poor, Lagos would not
406.928	be known for its music
409.701	or its endless energy
411.003	or even the fact that you can buy
411.003	an ice cold drink or a puppy
414.676	through your car window.
416.103	(Laughter)
420.219	The conditions that cause us
420.219	to define certain neighborhoods as slums
423.664	can be effectively improved,
425.659	but not without recognizing
425.659	the humanity and the agency
428.746	of the people living in them.
431.012	In Lagos, where public goods
431.012	are rarely publicly available,
434.062	slum dwellers are often at the forefront
434.062	of innovating solutions.
438.46	After being disconnected
438.46	from the grid for months
440.946	because the power company
440.946	couldn't figure out how to collect bills,
444.235	one settlement designed a system
444.235	that collectivized remittances
447.72	and got everyone cheaper rates
447.72	into the bargain.
451.488	Another settlement created
451.488	a reform program
453.658	that hires local bad boys as security.
456.436	They know every trick and every hideout,
458.586	so now troublemakers are more likely
458.586	to get caught and reported to police
462.04	and fewer of the youth end up
462.04	engaging in criminal activity.
466.086	Yet another settlement recently completed
468.277	a flood-safe, eco-friendly
468.277	communal toilet system.
472.086	Models like these are being
472.086	adopted across Lagos.
476.264	Informal settlements are incorrectly
476.264	named as the problem.
480.374	In fact, the real problems
480.374	are the factors that create them,
483.823	like the entrenchment of poverty,
485.78	social exclusion
486.999	and state failures.
489.206	When our governments
489.206	frame slums as threats
491.852	in order to justify violent land grabs
491.852	or forced evictions,
494.766	they're counting on those of us
494.766	who live in formal housing
497.755	to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.
502.455	Rather, we must remind them
504.497	that governments exist to serve
504.497	not only those who build
507.142	and live in luxury homes,
508.669	but also those who clean and guard them.
512.043	Our --
513.226	(Applause)
517.625	our realities may differ,
519.861	but our rights don't.
523.941	The Lagos state government,
525.638	like far too many on our continent,
527.585	pays lip service to ideas of inclusion,
530.282	while acting as though
530.282	progress can only be achieved
533.353	by the erasure, exploitation
533.353	and even elimination of groups
536.809	it considers expendable.
539.718	People living with disabilities
539.718	who hawk or beg on Lagos streets
543.219	are rounded up, extorted
545.438	and detained.
547.155	Women in low-income
547.155	neighborhoods are picked up
549.417	and charged with prostitution,
550.936	regardless of what they actually
550.936	do for a living.
553.844	Gay citizens are scapegoated
553.844	to distract from real political problems.
559.751	But people, like cities, are resilient,
563.912	and no amount of legislation
563.912	or intimidation or violence
567.341	can fully eliminate any of us.
570.128	Prostitutes, women
570.128	and women who work as prostitutes
573.79	still haven't gone extinct,
575.325	despite centuries of active suppression.
578.714	Queer Africans continue to exist,
581.369	even though queerness is now criminalized
581.369	in most parts of the continent.
585.178	And I'm fairly certain that poor people
585.178	don't generally tend to just disappear
589.751	because they've been stripped
589.751	of everything they have.
593.255	We are all already here,
596.716	and that answers the question
598.979	of whether or not we belong.
603.584	When those fisherpeople
603.584	started to sail down the lagoon
606.722	in search of new homes,
608.181	it could not have occurred to them
610.268	that the city that would
610.268	rise up around them
612.416	would one day insist
612.416	that they do not belong in it.
616.645	I like to believe that my grandfather,
618.861	in mapping new frontiers for Lagos,
620.75	was trying to open it up
622.685	to make room for other people
622.685	to be welcomed by the city
625.723	in the same way that he was.
628.548	On my way here, my grandma called me
631.417	to remind me how proud she was,
634.178	how proud [my grandfather]
634.178	and my mother would have been.
637.555	I am their dreams come true.
641.283	But there is no reason why their dreams --
641.283	or mine, for that matter --
646.301	are allowed to come true
647.697	while those of others
647.697	are turned to nightmares.
651.12	And lest we forget:
653.204	the minimum requirement for a dream
656.151	is a safe place to lay your head.
661.628	It is too late now for Basil,
664.365	but not for Magdalene,
666.288	not for the hundreds of thousands,
668.251	the millions still under threat in Lagos
670.669	or any of our cities.
673.188	The world does not have to remain blind
676.038	to the suffering that is created
676.038	when we deny people's humanity,
680.491	or even to the incredible potential
680.491	for growth that exists
683.805	when we recognize and value
683.805	all contributions.
689.199	We must hold our governments
691.838	and ourselves
693.567	accountable
695.011	for keeping our shared cities safe
695.011	for everyone in them,
699.912	because the only cities worth building --
702.125	indeed, the only futures
702.125	worth dreaming of --
706.107	are those that include all of us,
708.829	no matter who we are
711.106	or how we make homes for ourselves.
714.279	Thank you.
715.491	(Applause)
