15.26	Usually I like working in my shop,
17.885	but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns into a river,
22.218	then I just love it.
24.258	And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch the water,
27.589	and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers.
30.468	You have no idea how much time I spend.
33.4	"This is the ""Double Raindrop."""
35.427	Of all my sculptures, it's the most talkative.
43.69	It adds together the interference pattern
46.702	from two raindrops that land near each other.
49.981	Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons.
60.205	All the sculptures move by mechanical means.
70.15	Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?
74.385	Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.
95.904	Eight hundred two-liter soda bottles --
99.37	oh yea.
101.114	(Laughter)
113.519	Four hundred aluminum cans.
119.777	Tule is a reed that's native to California,
122.537	and the best thing about working with it is that it smells just delicious.
141.095	A single drop of rain
144.043	increasing amplitude.
168.143	The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip.
183.523	This adds together four different waves.
186.398	And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths
189.319	and increase the single.
192.667	The mechanism that drives it has nine motors
195.608	and about 3,000 pulleys.
207.776	Four hundred and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave.
212.433	Transferred to a larger scale --
215.272	actually a lot larger, with a lot of help --
222.117	a 20-day install.
244.943	"""Connected"" is a collaboration"
246.635	with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek.
250.439	Strings attached to dancers.
253.78	This is very early rehearsal footage,
256.202	but the finished work's on tour
258.564	and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks.
267.399	A pair of helices and 40 wooden slats.
293.031	Take your finger and draw this line.
296.26	Summer, fall, winter, spring,
300.26	noon, dusk, dark, dawn.
306.497	Have you ever seen those stratus clouds
309.76	that go in parallel stripes across the sky?
312.433	Did you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud
315.028	that's dipping in and out of the condensation layer?
318.625	What if every seemingly isolated object
321.458	was actually just where the continuous wave of that object
325.302	poked through into our world?
328.783	The Earth is neither flat nor round.
333.16	It's wavy.
337.583	It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth,
343.081	and I'll tell you why.
344.639	I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever.
346.635	And I'm just going to come out and say it:
348.718	My daughter is not a wave.
352.253	"And you might say, ""Surely, Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back,"
356.833	the cycles of hunger and eating,
359.593	waking and sleeping, laughing and crying
362.433	"would emerge as pattern."""
365.044	"But I would say, ""If I did that,"
367.671	"too much would be lost."""
371.16	This tension between the need to look deeper
375.889	and the beauty and immediacy of the world,
378.843	where if you even try to look deeper you've already missed what you're looking for,
382.545	this tension is what makes the sculptures move.
385.616	And for me, the path between these two extremes
388.127	takes the shape of a wave.
390.862	Let me show you one more.
435.36	Thank you very much. Thanks.
438.789	(Applause)
440.97	Thanks.
442.202	(Applause)
446.666	June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures,
448.439	they evoke so many different images.
450.867	Some of them are like the wind and some are like waves,
453.402	and sometimes they look alive and sometimes they seem like math.
456.287	Is there an actual inspiration behind each one?
458.791	Are you thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it?
462.347	RM: Well some of them definitely have a direct observation --
465.487	like literally two raindrops falling,
468.302	and just watching that pattern is so stunning.
471.177	And then just trying to figure out how to make that using stuff.
476.881	I like working with my hands.
479.425	There's nothing better than cutting a piece of wood
481.635	and trying to make it move.
483.385	JC: And does it ever change?
485.135	Do you think you're designing one thing,
486.26	and then when it's produced it looks like something else?
488.01	"RM: The ""Double Raindrop"" I worked on for nine months,"
491.468	and when I finally turned it on,
493.825	I actually hated it.
497.468	The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.
501.593	It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out.
504.941	And I happened to have a friend who was over,
507.085	"and he said, ""Why don't you just wait."""
509.097	And I waited, and the next day I liked it a bit better,
513.466	the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I really love it.
516.427	And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes,
521.093	and two, it does not look like as expected.
523.635	JC: The relationship evolves over time.
526.052	Well thank you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us.
526.927	RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you, Reuben.)
529.814	(Applause)
