12.903	When I was growing up, I really 
12.903	liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.
18.383	One time, though, I thought climbing
18.383	a tree would lead to a great hiding spot,
22.492	but I fell and broke my arm.
25.395	I actually started first grade
25.395	with a big cast all over my torso.
30.178	It was taken off six weeks later,
30.178	but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow,
34.323	and I had to do physical therapy
34.323	to flex and extend it,
41.021	I barely did it, because
41.021	I found it boring and painful,
44.063	and as a result, it took me
44.063	another six weeks to get better.
48.684	Many years later, my mom
48.684	developed frozen shoulder,
51.548	which leads to pain
51.548	and stiffness in the shoulder.
56.044	The person I believed for half of my life
56.044	to have superpowers
59.155	suddenly needed help
59.155	to get dressed or to cut food.
63.474	She went each week to physical therapy,
63.474	but just like me,
66.283	she barely followed the home treatment,
68.187	and it took her
68.187	over five months to feel better.
71.848	Both my mom and I
71.848	required physical therapy,
74.503	a process of doing a suite
74.503	of repetitive exercises
77.266	in order to regain the range of movement
77.266	lost due to an accident or injury.
81.794	At first, a physical therapist
81.794	works with patients,
84.171	but then it's up to the patients
84.171	to do their exercises at home.
87.134	But patients find physical therapy
87.134	boring, frustrating, confusing
90.923	and lengthy before seeing results.
93.844	Sadly, patient noncompliance
93.844	can be as high as 70 percent.
98.837	This means the majority of patients
98.837	don't do their exercises
102.226	and therefore take
102.226	a lot longer to get better.
106.011	All physical therapists agree
106.011	that special exercises
108.797	reduce the time needed for recovery,
110.957	but patients lack
110.957	the motivation to do them.
114.393	So together with three friends,
114.393	all of us software geeks,
118.898	we asked ourselves,
120.987	wouldn't it be interesting if patients
120.987	could play their way to recovery?
125.585	We started building MIRA,
125.585	A P.C. software platform
128.441	that uses this Kinect device,
128.441	a motion capture camera,
131.339	to transform traditional exercises
131.339	into video games.
135.702	My physical therapist has already set up
135.702	a schedule for my particular therapy.
140.364	Let's see how this looks.
145.867	The first game asks me
145.867	to fly a bee up and down
148.746	to gather pollen to deposit in beehives,
151.277	all while avoiding the other bugs.
153.738	I control the bee by doing
153.738	elbow extension and flexion,
156.964	just like when I was seven years old
156.964	after the cast was taken off.
161.865	When designing a game,
161.865	we speak to physical therapists at first
164.929	to understand what movement
164.929	patients need to do.
167.856	We then make that a video game
169.527	to give patients simple,
169.527	motivating objectives to follow.
173.312	But the software is very customizable,
175.239	and physical therapists can also
175.239	create their own exercises.
179.192	Using the software, my physical therapist
181.183	recorded herself performing
181.183	a shoulder abduction,
183.471	which is one of the movements
183.471	my mom had to do
185.664	when she had frozen shoulder.
187.361	I can follow my therapist's example
187.361	on the left side of the screen,
190.819	while on the right, I see myself
190.819	doing the recommended movement.
194.511	I feel more engaged and confident,
196.554	as I'm exercising alongside my therapist
199.015	with the exercises my therapist
199.015	thinks are best for me.
202.87	This basically extends the application
202.87	for physical therapists
205.795	to create whatever exercises
205.795	they think are best.
210.323	This is an auction house game
210.323	for preventing falls,
213.574	designed to strengthen muscles
213.574	and improve balance.
216.569	As a patient, I need to do
216.569	sit and stand movements,
219.564	and when I stand up,
221.422	I bid for the items I want to buy.
223.767	(Laughter)
225.88	In two days, my grandmother
225.88	will be 82 years old,
228.875	and there's a 50 percent chance
228.875	for people over 80
231.29	to fall at least once per year,
233.171	which could lead to a broken hip
233.171	or even worse.
236.259	Poor muscle tone and impaired balance
236.259	are the number one cause of falls,
240.415	so reversing these problems
240.415	through targeted exercise
243.526	will help keep older people
243.526	like my grandmother
246.196	safer and independent for longer.
249.029	When my schedule ends,
249.029	MIRA briefly shows me
251.514	how I progressed throughout my session.
255.553	I have just shown you
255.553	three different games
257.62	for kids, adults and seniors.
260.113	These can be used with orthopedic
260.113	or neurologic patients,
262.942	but we'll soon have options
262.942	for children with autism,
265.886	mental health or speech therapy.
268.661	My physical therapist
268.661	can go back to my profile
270.999	and see the data gathered
270.999	during my sessions.
273.99	She can see how much I moved,
273.99	how many points I scored,
276.66	with what speed I moved my joints,
278.61	and so on.
279.841	My physical therapist can use all of this
279.841	to adapt my treatment.
283.881	I'm so pleased this version is now in use
285.947	in over 10 clinics
285.947	across Europe and the U.S.,
289.244	and we're working on the home version.
291.197	We want to enable physical therapists
291.197	to prescribe this digital treatment
295.67	and help patients play their way
295.67	to recovery at home.
300.03	If my mom or I had a tool like this
300.03	when we needed physical therapy,
303.473	then we would have been more successful
303.473	following the treatment,
306.519	and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.
310.049	Thank you.
311.651	(Applause)
314.031	Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me
314.031	what hardware is this
317.607	that they're rapidly putting away?
319.47	What is that made of,
319.47	and how much does it cost?
321.71	Cosmin Milhau: So it's
321.71	a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the demo,
324.789	but you just need a computer
324.789	and a Kinect, which is 120 dollars.
328.534	TR: Right, and the Kinect is the thing
328.534	that people use for their Xboxes
331.981	to do 3D games, right?
333.052	CM: Exactly, but you don't need the Xbox,
333.052	you only need a camera.
336.113	TR: Right, so this is less
336.113	than a $1,000 solution.
338.875	CM: Definitely, 400 dollars,
338.875	you can definitely use it.
341.458	TR: So right now, you're doing
341.458	clinical trials in clinics.
344.254	CM: Yes.
344.993	TR: And then the hope is to get it
344.993	so it's a home version
347.713	and I can do my exercise remotely,
349.392	and the therapist at the clinic
349.392	can see how I'm doing and stuff like that.
352.922	CM: Exactly.
353.989	TR: Cool. Thanks so much.
353.989	CM: Thank you.
355.843	(Applause)
