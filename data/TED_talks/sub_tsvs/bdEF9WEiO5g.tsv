15.26	Now, since this is TEDGlobal,
17.26	who can tell me what this is called in French?
21.26	I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --
23.26	"""vielle Ã  roue."""
25.26	"And in Spanish, ""zanfona."""
27.26	"And in Italian, ""ghironda,"" okay?"
29.26	Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
32.26	So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.
35.26	The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument
38.26	that uses a crank to turn a wheel
41.26	to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,
44.26	to produce music.
46.26	It has three different kinds of strings.
49.26	The first string is the drone string,
52.26	which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
57.26	The second string is a melody string,
59.26	which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
68.26	And the third string is pretty innovative.
70.26	It's also the only instrument
72.26	that uses this kind of technique.
75.26	It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
79.26	When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,
85.26	it makes a sound like a barking dog.
89.26	So all of this is pretty innovative,
91.26	if you consider
93.26	that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago
95.26	and it took two people to play it;
97.26	one to turn the crank,
99.26	and another person -- yes -- to play the melody
101.26	by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
105.26	Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
108.26	So, one person could actually play
110.26	and almost -- this is pretty heavy --
112.26	carry the hurdy-gurdy.
115.26	The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries
118.26	in mostly dance music
120.26	because of the uniqueness of the melody
123.26	combined with the acoustic boombox here.
126.26	And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --
129.26	traditional folk music,
131.26	dance, contemporary
133.26	and world music --
136.26	in the U.K., in France, in Spain
138.26	and in Italy.
140.26	And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
143.26	It's made by specialized luthiers,
145.26	also in Europe.
148.26	And it's very difficult to tune.
152.26	So without further ado, would you like to hear it?
154.26	(Audience: Yes.)
156.26	Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)
158.26	CP: Okay.
160.26	There I go.
163.26	I'd like to sing in Basque,
165.26	which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,
168.26	in the region in France and Spain.
171.26	(Music)
180.26	[Basque]
225.26	(Music)
276.26	Thank you.
278.26	(Applause)
280.26	This is a song that I wrote
283.26	based on traditional Basque rhythms.
286.26	And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
290.26	(Music)
330.26	Thank you. Thank you.
332.26	(Applause)
