25	We've been told to go out on a limb
25	and say something surprising.
30.786	So I'll try and do that,
32	but I want to start with two things
32	that everyone already knows.
38.52	And the first one, in fact,
38.52	is something that has been known
41.805	for most of recorded history,
45	and that is, that the planet Earth,
45	or the solar system,
49.883	or our environment or whatever,
52.829	is uniquely suited
52.829	to sustain our evolution --
59.144	or creation, as it used to be thought --
62	and our present existence,
62	and most important, our future survival.
69.176	Nowadays, this idea
69.176	has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth.
73.819	And the idea there
73.819	is that outside the spaceship,
76.358	the universe is implacably hostile,
79.402	and inside is all we have,
79.402	all we depend on,
83.27	and we only get the one chance:
83.27	if we mess up our spaceship,
86.42	we've got nowhere else to go.
88.293	Now, the second thing
88.293	that everyone already knows
91.124	is that, contrary to what was believed
91.124	for most of human history,
96.593	human beings are not, in fact,
96.593	the hub of existence.
102.336	As Stephen Hawking famously said,
104.676	we're just a chemical scum
104.676	on the surface of a typical planet
109.596	that's in orbit around a typical star,
111.906	which is on the outskirts
111.906	of a typical galaxy, and so on.
116.883	Now, the first of those two things
116.883	that everyone knows is kind of saying
121.805	that we're at a very un-typical place,
121.805	uniquely suited and so on,
126.466	and the second one is saying
126.466	that we're at a typical place.
129.95	And, especially if you regard
129.95	these two as deep truths to live by
134.835	and to inform your life decisions,
137	then they seem a little bit
137	to conflict with each other.
143.48	But that doesn't prevent them
143.48	from both being completely false.
148.861	(Laughter)
150.266	And they are.
152.189	So let me start with the second one:
158.07	"""Typical."" Well, is this a typical place?"
162.175	Well, let's look around, you know,
162.175	look in a random direction,
165.164	and we see a wall, and chemical scum --
170.777	(Laughter)
172	and that's not typical
172	of the universe at all.
176.852	All you've got to do is go
176.852	a few hundred miles in that same direction
180.299	and look back,
181.494	and you won't see any walls
181.494	or chemical scum at all --
184.848	all you see is a blue planet.
186.579	And if you go further than that,
189.208	you'll see the Sun, the solar system
189.208	and the stars and so on,
193.614	but that's still not typical
193.614	of the universe,
195.769	because stars come in galaxies.
199.117	And most places in the universe,
199.117	a typical place in the universe,
203.919	is nowhere near any galaxies.
206	So let's go out further, till we're
206	outside the galaxy, and look back,
211.551	and yeah, there's the huge galaxy
211.551	with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
217.266	And at this point, we've come
223.394	But we're still nowhere near
223.394	a typical place in the universe.
228	To get to a typical place,
229.773	you've got to go
229.773	1,000 times as far as that,
234.314	into intergalactic space.
236.87	And so, what does that
236.87	"look like -- ""typical?"""
239.937	"What does a ""typical"" place"
239.937	in the universe look like?
242.51	Well, at enormous expense,
242.51	TED has arranged
246.544	a high-resolution immersion
246.544	virtual reality rendering
251.626	of the view from intergalactic space.
255	Can we have the lights off,
255	please, so we can see it?
263	Well, not quite, not quite perfect.
266.39	You see, intergalactic space
266.39	is completely dark, pitch dark.
273.095	It's so dark,
275.002	that if you were to be looking
275.002	at the nearest star to you,
280.692	and that star were to explode
280.692	as a supernova,
284.814	and you were to be staring directly at it
284.814	at the moment when its light reached you,
289.726	you still wouldn't be able
289.726	to see even a glimmer.
293.667	That's how big and how dark
293.667	the universe is.
296.786	And that's despite the fact
296.786	that a supernova is so bright,
301.571	so brilliant an event,
304.045	that it would kill you stone dead
304.045	at a range of several light-years.
308.306	(Laughter)
309.949	And yet, from intergalactic space,
311.888	it's so far away you wouldn't even see it.
314.347	It's also very cold out there --
317	less than three degrees
317	above absolute zero.
320.553	And it's very empty.
322.435	The vacuum there is one million times
322.435	less dense than the highest vacuum
328.3	that our best technology on Earth
328.3	can currently create.
331.645	So that's how different
331.645	a typical place is from this place.
338	And that is how un-typical this place is.
341.151	So can we have the lights
341.151	back on please? Thank you.
346.262	Now, how do we know about an environment
346.262	that's so far away and so different
351.628	and so alien from anything we're used to?
354.699	Well, the Earth -- our environment,
354.699	in the form of us --
358.089	is creating knowledge.
360.139	Well, what does that mean?
361.503	Well, look out even further
361.503	than we've just been --
365	I mean from here, with a telescope --
367.324	and you'll see things that look
367.324	like stars, they're called quasars.
371.522	"""Quasars"" originally meant"
371.522	"""quasi-stellar object,"""
374.759	"which means ""things that look"
374.759	"a bit like stars."""
377.526	(Laughter)
378.835	But they're not stars.
380.213	And we know what they are.
384.478	Billions of years ago
384.478	and billions of light-years away,
387.853	the material at the center
387.853	of a galaxy collapsed
392	towards a super-massive black hole.
394.395	And then intense magnetic fields
396.701	directed some of the energy
396.701	of that gravitational collapse
400.671	and some of the matter
402	back out in the form of tremendous jets,
404.123	which illuminated lobes
405.981	with the brilliance of --
405.981	I think it's a trillion -- suns.
412.886	Now, the physics of the human brain
412.886	could hardly be more unlike
417.422	the physics of such a jet.
419.369	We couldn't survive for an instant in it.
421.745	Language breaks down
421.745	when trying to describe
424.778	what it would be like
424.778	in one of those jets.
427	It would be a bit like experiencing
427	a supernova explosion,
430.082	but at point-blank range
430.082	and for millions of years at a time.
433.623	(Laughter)
437.174	And yet, that jet happened
437.174	in precisely such a way
443.288	that billions of years later,
443.288	on the other side of the universe,
447.032	some bit of chemical scum
447.032	could accurately describe
451.198	and model and predict
451.198	and explain, above all --
455.212	there's your reference --
457.362	what was happening there, in reality.
461.572	The one physical system, the brain,
461.572	contains an accurate working model
466.331	of the other, the quasar.
468.203	Not just a superficial image of it,
468.203	though it contains that as well,
471.802	but an explanatory model,
473.807	embodying the same
473.807	mathematical relationships
476.878	and the same causal structure.
479.33	Now, that is knowledge.
481.983	And if that weren't amazing enough,
484	the faithfulness with which
484	the one structure resembles the other
488	is increasing with time.
490.107	That is the growth of knowledge.
492.604	So, the laws of physics
492.604	have this special property,
496	that physical objects as unlike each other
496	as they could possibly be,
500.781	can nevertheless embody the same
500.781	mathematical and causal structure
506.549	and to do it more and more so over time.
510.068	So we are a chemical scum
510.068	that is different.
513.264	This chemical scum has universality.
516.842	Its structure contains,
516.842	with ever-increasing precision,
521.272	the structure of everything.
522.726	This place, and not other places
522.726	in the universe,
526.454	is a hub which contains within itself
526.454	the structural and causal essence
532.554	of the whole of the rest
532.554	of physical reality.
535.315	And so, far from being insignificant,
537.187	the fact that the laws
537.187	of physics allow this
539.915	or even mandate that this can happen,
543.39	is one of the most important things
543.39	about the physical world.
548.355	Now how does the solar system --
548.355	our environment, in the form of us --
553.667	acquire this special relationship
553.667	with the rest of the universe?
557.072	Well, one thing that's true
557.072	about Stephen Hawking's remark --
561.914	I mean, it is true,
561.914	but it's the wrong emphasis.
565.913	One thing that's true about it is that
565.913	it doesn't do it with any special physics,
571.926	there's no special dispensation,
571.926	no miracles involved.
574.941	It does it simply with three things
574.941	that we have here in abundance.
579	One of them is matter,
580.674	because the growth of knowledge
580.674	is a form of information processing.
585.754	Information processing is computation,
585.754	computation requires a computer --
589.715	there's no known way of making
589.715	a computer without matter.
592.738	We also need energy to make
592.738	the computer, and most important,
596.237	to make the media, in effect,
596.237	onto which we record
600.231	the knowledge that we discover.
602	And then thirdly,
602	less tangible but just as essential
606.165	for the open-ended creation
606.165	of knowledge, of explanations,
610.387	is evidence.
614.142	Now, our environment
614.142	is inundated with evidence.
617.347	We happen to get round to testing,
617.347	let's say, Newton's Law of Gravity,
623	about 300 years ago.
624.753	But the evidence that we used to do that
628.116	was falling down on every
628.116	square meter of the Earth
631.429	for billions of years before that,
633.106	and will continue to fall
633.106	for billions of years afterwards.
637.484	And the same is true
637.484	for all the other sciences.
640	As far as we know, evidence to discover
640	the most fundamental truths
645	of all the sciences is here just
645	for the taking, on our planet.
649.298	Our location is saturated with evidence
652.186	and also with matter and energy.
654.642	Out in intergalactic space,
656.904	those three prerequisites
656.904	for the open-ended creation of knowledge
660.317	are at their lowest possible supply --
662.761	as I said, it's empty, it's cold
662.761	and it's dark out there.
667.496	Or is it?
669.236	Now actually, that's just
669.236	another parochial misconception.
672.97	(Laughter)
674.069	Because imagine a cube out there
674.069	in intergalactic space,
679.064	the same size as our home,
679.064	the solar system.
682.749	Now that cube is very empty
682.749	by human standards,
686	but that still means that it contains
686	over a million tons of matter.
691	And a million tons is enough to make,
691	say, a self-contained space station,
696	on which there's a colony of scientists
698.374	that are devoted to creating an open-ended
698.374	stream of knowledge, and so on.
702.799	Now, it's way beyond present technology
704.908	to even gather the hydrogen
704.908	from intergalactic space
709.058	and form it into other elements and so on.
712.872	But the thing is,
712.872	in a comprehensible universe,
715.824	if something isn't forbidden
715.824	by the laws of physics,
719.214	then what could possibly prevent us
719.214	from doing it, other than knowing how?
723.383	In other words, it's a matter
723.383	of knowledge, not resources.
726.784	If we could do that, we'd automatically
726.784	have an energy supply,
730.419	because this transmutation
730.419	would be a fusion reactor.
733.887	And evidence?
735.648	Well, again, it's dark out there
735.648	to human senses,
738.847	but all you've got to do
738.847	is take a telescope,
740.99	even one of present-day design,
743.157	look out, and you'll see
743.157	the same galaxies as we do from here.
747.597	And with a more powerful telescope,
749.967	you'll be able to see stars
749.967	and planets in those galaxies,
752.713	you'll be able to do astrophysics
752.713	and learn the laws of physics.
756.147	And locally there you could build
756.147	particle accelerators,
758.811	and learn elementary particle physics
758.811	and chemistry, and so on.
762.072	Probably the hardest science to do
762.072	would be biology field trips --
766.554	(Laughter)
767.895	because it would take
767.895	several hundred million years
770.858	to get to the nearest
770.858	life-bearing planet and back.
774.201	But I have to tell you --
774.201	and sorry, Richard --
776.507	but I never did like biology
776.507	field trips much,
779.865	(Laughter)
781.197	and I think we can just about make do
783.217	with one every few hundred million years.
785.341	(Laughter)
787.382	So in fact, intergalactic space
787.382	does contain all the prerequisites
794.362	for the open-ended creation of knowledge.
797.25	Any such cube anywhere in the universe
800.45	could become the same kind
800.45	of hub that we are,
805.059	if the knowledge of how to do so
805.059	were present there.
810.758	So, we're not in a uniquely
810.758	hospitable place.
814.17	If intergalactic space
814.17	is capable of creating
816.708	an open-ended stream of explanations,
819.318	then so is almost every other environment,
821.509	so is the Earth.
822.763	So is a polluted Earth.
825.474	And the limiting factor, there and here,
829.21	is not resources,
829.21	because they're plentiful,
832.09	but knowledge, which is scarce.
834.61	Now this cosmic knowledge-based view
834.61	may -- and I think ought to --
840.603	make us feel very special.
842.943	But it should also
842.943	make us feel vulnerable,
845.585	because it means that
845.585	without the specific knowledge
849.024	that's needed to survive
849.024	the ongoing challenges of the universe,
852.795	we won't survive them.
854	All it takes is for a supernova
854	to go off a few light-years away,
857.509	and we'll all be dead!
859.254	Martin Rees has recently written a book
861.677	about our vulnerability
861.677	to all sorts of things,
865	from astrophysics, to scientific
865	experiments gone wrong,
869	and most importantly, to terrorism
869	with weapons of mass destruction.
873.374	And he thinks that civilization
873.374	has only a 50 percent chance
876.825	of surviving this century.
878.276	I think he's going to talk
878.276	about that later in the conference.
881.435	Now, I don't think that probability
881.435	is the right category
886.607	to discuss this issue in,
888	but I do agree with him about this:
889.759	We can survive and we can fail to survive.
894.502	But it depends not on chance,
897.271	but on whether we create
897.271	the relevant knowledge in time.
901	The danger is not at all unprecedented.
903.826	Species go extinct all the time.
907.071	Civilizations end.
909.253	The overwhelming majority
909.253	of all species and all civilizations
912.713	that have ever existed are now history.
915.322	And if we want to be
915.322	the exception to that,
918.22	then logically, our only hope
918.22	is to make use of the one feature
924.143	that distinguishes our species
924.143	and civilization from all the others --
928.791	namely, our special relationship
928.791	with the laws of physics,
933.262	our ability to create
933.262	new explanations, new knowledge --
937.759	to be a hub of existence.
940.919	So let me now apply this
940.919	to a current controversy,
944.663	not because I want to advocate
944.663	any particular solution,
947.902	but just to illustrate
947.902	the kind of thing I mean.
950.56	And the controversy is global warming.
953	Now, I'm a physicist,
953	but I'm not the right kind of physicist.
956.029	In regard to global warming,
956.029	I'm just a layman.
959.787	And the rational thing for a layman to do
962.642	is to take seriously
962.642	the prevailing scientific theory.
967.167	And according to that theory,
967.167	it's already too late to avoid a disaster,
971.858	because if it's true that our best option
971.858	at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
977.65	with something like the Kyoto Protocol,
979.544	with its constraints on economic activity
979.544	and its enormous cost
983.385	of hundreds of billions of dollars,
983.385	or whatever it is,
986	then that is already a disaster
986	by any reasonable measure.
991.382	And the actions that are advocated are not
991.382	even purported to solve the problem,
996.475	merely to postpone it by a little.
998.879	So it's already too late to avoid it,
1000.688	and it probably has been
1000.688	too late to avoid it
1003.596	ever since before anyone
1003.596	realized the danger.
1007.441	It was probably already
1007.441	too late in the 1970s,
1010.529	when the best available
1010.529	scientific theory was telling us
1013.748	that industrial emissions were
1013.748	about to precipitate a new ice age,
1017.286	in which billions would die.
1020.312	Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me,
1022.495	and I don't know why it isn't
1022.495	informing public debate.
1026.106	It is that we can't always know.
1029.436	When we know of an impending disaster,
1032.094	and how to solve it at a cost less
1032.094	than the cost of the disaster itself,
1036.72	then there's not going to be
1036.72	much argument, really.
1039.616	But no precautions
1039.616	and no precautionary principle
1044.209	can avoid problems
1044.209	that we do not yet foresee.
1048.982	Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing,
1053.444	not just problem-avoidance.
1056.712	And it's true that an ounce of prevention
1056.712	equals a pound of cure,
1060.12	but that's only if we know
1060.12	what to prevent.
1063.072	If you've been punched on the nose,
1065.057	then the science of medicine
1065.057	does not consist of teaching you
1068.216	how to avoid punches.
1069.598	(Laughter)
1070.637	If medical science stopped seeking cures
1070.637	and concentrated on prevention only,
1076	then it would achieve
1076	very little of either.
1078.771	The world is buzzing at the moment
1080.82	with plans to force reductions
1080.82	in gas emissions at all costs.
1085.95	It ought to be buzzing with plans
1085.95	to reduce the temperature,
1090.253	and with plans to live
1090.253	at the higher temperature --
1093.288	and not at all costs,
1093.288	but efficiently and cheaply.
1096.532	And some such plans exist,
1097.883	things like swarms of mirrors in space
1097.883	to deflect the sunlight away,
1102.119	and encouraging aquatic organisms
1102.119	to eat more carbon dioxide.
1106	At the moment, these things
1106	are fringe research;
1109.312	they're not central to the human effort
1109.312	to face this problem,
1113.041	or problems in general.
1115	And with problems
1115	that we are not aware of yet,
1117.795	the ability to put right -- not the sheer
1117.795	good luck of avoiding indefinitely --
1123.978	is our only hope, not just
1123.978	of solving problems,
1126.795	but of survival.
1128.671	So take two stone tablets,
1128.671	and carve on them.
1136.057	On one of them, carve:
1136.057	"""Problems are soluble."""
1140.763	And on the other one, carve:
1140.763	"""Problems are inevitable."""
1145.396	Thank you.
1146.579	(Applause)
