15.741	We live in an incredibly busy world.
18.333	The pace of life is often frantic,
18.333	our minds are always busy,
21.854	and we're always doing something.
24.055	So with that in mind,
24.055	I'd like you just to take a moment
26.771	to think, when did you last take
26.771	any time to do nothing?
32.079	Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?
34.608	And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.
36.885	So that's no emailing,
36.885	texting, no Internet,
39.505	no TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.
43.563	Not even sitting there
43.563	reminiscing about the past
45.873	or planning for the future.
48.014	Simply doing nothing.
51.7	I see a lot of very blank faces.
53.283	(Laughter)
54.308	You probably have to go a long way back.
56.251	And this is an extraordinary thing, right?
58.283	We're talking about our mind.
60.403	The mind, our most valuable
60.403	and precious resource,
63.691	through which we experience
63.691	every single moment of our life.
67.707	The mind that we rely upon
69.883	to be happy, content,
69.883	emotionally stable as individuals,
74.381	and at the same time,
74.381	to be kind and thoughtful
76.785	and considerate
76.785	in our relationships with others.
80.509	This is the same mind that we depend upon
82.621	to be focused, creative, spontaneous,
86.117	and to perform at our very best
86.117	in everything that we do.
90.172	And yet, we don't take
90.172	any time out to look after it.
94.273	In fact, we spend more time
94.273	looking after our cars,
97.31	our clothes and our hair than we --
99.317	okay, maybe not our hair,
100.588	(Laughter)
101.613	but you see where I'm going.
103.387	The result, of course,
103.387	is that we get stressed.
106.074	You know, the mind whizzes away
106.074	like a washing machine
108.823	going round and round,
108.823	lots of difficult, confusing emotions,
112.239	and we don't really know
112.239	how to deal with that.
117.572	And the sad fact
117.572	is that we are so distracted
121.064	that we're no longer present
121.064	in the world in which we live.
125.619	We miss out on the things
125.619	that are most important to us,
128.951	and the crazy thing
128.951	is that everybody just assumes,
131.382	that's the way life is, so we've just
131.382	kind of got to get on with it.
134.745	That's really not how it has to be.
136.979	So I was about 11 when I went along
136.979	to my first meditation class.
141.419	And trust me, it had all the stereotypes
141.419	that you can imagine,
144.643	the sitting cross-legged on the floor,
147.038	the incense, the herbal tea,
147.038	the vegetarians, the whole deal,
150.437	but my mom was going and I was intrigued,
150.437	so I went along with her.
154.23	I'd also seen a few kung fu movies,
156.235	and secretly I kind of thought
156.235	I might be able to learn how to fly,
159.605	but I was very young at the time.
162.319	Now as I was there, I guess,
162.319	like a lot of people,
165.43	I assumed that it was just
165.43	an aspirin for the mind.
169.094	You get stressed, you do some meditation.
171.071	I hadn't really thought that it could be
171.071	sort of preventative in nature,
174.916	until I was about 20, when a number
174.916	of things happened in my life
178.575	in quite quick succession,
181.009	really serious things
181.009	which just flipped my life upside down
184.476	and all of a sudden
184.476	I was inundated with thoughts,
187.398	inundated with difficult emotions
187.398	that I didn't know how to cope with.
190.979	Every time I sort of pushed one down,
193.019	another one would pop back up again.
194.844	It was a really very stressful time.
197.08	I guess we all deal with stress
197.08	in different ways.
201.398	Some people will bury themselves in work,
201.398	grateful for the distraction.
206.008	Others will turn to their friends,
206.008	their family, looking for support.
209.318	Some people hit the bottle,
209.318	start taking medication.
213.212	My own way of dealing with it
213.212	was to become a monk.
216.28	So I quit my degree,
216.28	I headed off to the Himalayas,
219.917	I became a monk, and I started
219.917	studying meditation.
223.433	People often ask me
223.433	what I learned from that time.
227.494	Well, obviously it changed things.
229.73	Let's face it, becoming a celibate monk
229.73	is going to change a number of things.
233.744	But it was more than that.
236.324	It taught me -- it gave me
236.324	a greater appreciation,
239.663	an understanding for the present moment.
243.322	By that I mean not being lost in thought,
247.282	not being distracted,
249.118	not being overwhelmed
249.118	by difficult emotions,
252.933	but instead learning how to be
252.933	in the here and now,
256.486	how to be mindful, how to be present.
259.42	I think the present moment
259.42	is so underrated.
262.885	It sounds so ordinary,
264.672	and yet we spend so little time
264.672	in the present moment
268.391	that it's anything but ordinary.
270.756	There was a research paper that came
270.756	out of Harvard, just recently,
274.565	that said on average, our minds
274.565	are lost in thought
277.355	almost 47 percent of the time.
282.387	At the same time, this sort
282.387	of constant mind-wandering
285.26	is also a direct cause of unhappiness.
287.919	Now we're not here for that long anyway,
292.987	but to spend almost half
292.987	of our life lost in thought
297.213	and potentially quite unhappy,
299.219	I don't know, it just kind
299.219	of seems tragic, actually,
301.916	especially when there's something
301.916	we can do about it,
304.873	when there's a positive,
304.873	practical, achievable,
308.521	scientifically proven technique
311.505	which allows our mind to be more healthy,
313.731	to be more mindful and less distracted.
317.879	And the beauty of it is that even though
320.298	it need only take about 10 minutes a day,
322.697	it impacts our entire life.
326.455	But we need to know how to do it.
328.175	We need an exercise.
329.435	We need a framework
329.435	to learn how to be more mindful.
332.577	That's essentially what meditation is.
334.5	It's familiarizing ourselves
334.5	with the present moment.
337.015	But we also need to know
337.015	how to approach it in the right way
340.07	to get the best from it.
341.951	And that's what these are for,
341.951	in case you've been wondering,
344.921	because most people assume
347.182	that meditation
347.182	is all about stopping thoughts,
349.937	getting rid of emotions,
349.937	somehow controlling the mind,
352.998	but actually it's quite
352.998	different from that.
355.598	It's more about stepping back,
357.983	sort of seeing the thought clearly,
360.343	witnessing it coming and going,
360.343	emotions coming and going
363.082	without judgment,
363.082	but with a relaxed, focused mind.
368.722	So for example, right now,
370.857	if I focus too much on the balls,
373.318	then there's no way I can relax
373.318	and talk to you at the same time.
376.469	Equally, if I relax too much
376.469	talking to you,
378.597	there's no way I can focus on the balls.
380.527	I'm going to drop them.
381.733	Now in life, and in meditation,
384.375	there'll be times when the focus
384.375	becomes a little bit too intense,
387.795	and life starts to feel a bit like this.
391.802	It's a very uncomfortable
391.802	way to live life,
393.963	when you get this tight and stressed.
396.079	At other times, we might take our foot off
396.079	the gas a little bit too much,
399.584	and things just become a sort
399.584	of little bit like this.
402.18	Of course in meditation --
403.869	(Snores)
404.894	we're going to end up falling asleep.
406.703	So we're looking for a balance,
406.703	a focused relaxation
409.429	where we can allow thoughts to come and go
412.465	without all the usual involvement.
415.198	Now, what usually happens
415.198	when we're learning to be mindful
418.496	is that we get distracted by a thought.
421.44	Let's say this is an anxious thought.
423.236	Everything's going fine,
423.236	and we see the anxious thought.
425.886	"""Oh, I didn't realize"
425.886	"I was worried about that."""
428.433	You go back to it, repeat it.
429.909	"""Oh, I am worried."
431.096	I really am worried.
431.096	"Wow, there's so much anxiety."""
433.555	And before we know it, right,
435.339	we're anxious about feeling anxious.
438.301	(Laughter)
439.333	You know, this is crazy.
440.674	We do this all the time,
440.674	even on an everyday level.
443.837	If you think about the last time
443.837	you had a wobbly tooth.
449.14	You know it's wobbly,
449.14	and you know that it hurts.
452.46	But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?
455.997	(Mumbling)
457.902	It does hurt.
459.095	And we reinforce the storyline, right?
461.664	And we just keep telling ourselves,
461.664	and we do it all the time.
464.645	And it's only in learning
464.645	to watch the mind in this way
467.357	that we can start to let go
467.357	of those storylines and patterns of mind.
471.789	But when you sit down
471.789	and you watch the mind in this way,
474.49	you might see many different patterns.
476.369	You might find a mind
476.369	that's really restless and --
479.026	the whole time.
480.867	Don't be surprised if you feel
480.867	a bit agitated in your body
484.041	when you sit down to do nothing
484.041	and your mind feels like that.
487.802	You might find a mind that's very dull
490.202	and boring, and it's just,
490.202	almost mechanical,
492.538	it just seems it's as if you're
492.538	getting up, going to work,
495.741	eat, sleep, get up, work.
498.222	Or it might just be
498.222	that one little nagging thought
500.746	that just goes round and round your mind.
505.9	Well, whatever it is,
507.266	meditation offers the opportunity,
507.266	the potential to step back
512.905	and to get a different perspective,
515.443	to see that things aren't always
515.443	as they appear.
520.315	We can't change every little thing
520.315	that happens to us in life,
526.053	but we can change
526.053	the way that we experience it.
529.484	That's the potential
529.484	of meditation, of mindfulness.
533.221	You don't have to burn any incense,
535.795	and you definitely don't have
535.795	to sit on the floor.
538.2	All you need to do
538.2	is to take 10 minutes out a day
542.113	to step back, to familiarize yourself
542.113	with the present moment
545.65	so that you get to experience
545.65	a greater sense
548.336	of focus, calm and clarity in your life.
552.747	Thank you very much.
553.969	(Applause)
