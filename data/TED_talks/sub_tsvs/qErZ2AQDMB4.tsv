12.586	The will to live life differently can start
15.424	in some of the most unusual places.
18.87	This is where I come from, Todmorden.
20.816	It's a market town in the north of England,
25.507	fairly normal market town.
27.58	It used to look like this,
29.75	and now it's more like this,
32.498	with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
36.223	We call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)
40.94	Corner row railway, station car park,
43.955	front of a health center, people's front gardens,
47.707	and even in front of the police station. (Laughter)
51.244	We've got edible canal towpaths,
54.234	and we've got sprouting cemeteries.
56.4	The soil is extremely good. (Laughter)
62.901	We've even invented a new form of tourism.
65.144	It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,
68.751	people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,
72.675	even when there's not much growing. (Laughter)
75.659	But it starts a conversation. (Laughter)
79.289	And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)
83.297	We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
88.114	We tried to answer this simple question:
89.432	Can you find a unifying language that cuts across age
92.322	and income and culture that will help people themselves
96.539	find a new way of living,
98.2	see spaces around them differently,
100.325	think about the resources they use differently,
102.928	interact differently?
104.921	Can we find that language?
107.29	And then, can we replicate those actions?
111.257	And the answer would appear to be yes,
114.015	and the language would appear to be food.
117.418	So, three and a half years ago, a few of us
119.437	sat around a kitchen table and
121.056	we just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)
124.424	(Applause)
127.661	We came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.
130.252	We did not consult. We did not write a report.
132.565	Enough of all that. (Laughter)
135.14	And we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,
138.158	look, let's imagine that our town
141.104	is focused around three plates:
142.86	a community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;
145.084	a learning plate, what we teach our kids in school
148.132	and what new skills we share amongst ourselves;
150.893	and business, what we do with the pound in our pocket
154.012	and which businesses we choose to support.
155.833	Now, let's imagine those plates agitated
158.64	with community actions around food.
161.28	If we start one of those community plates spinning,
163.521	that's really great, that really starts to empower people,
166.905	but if we can then spin that community plate
168.992	with the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,
171.888	we've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.
175.624	We're starting to build resilience ourselves.
178.969	We're starting to reinvent community ourselves,
182.36	and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.
185.827	(Applause)
191.138	And here's the thing as well.
193.93	We've not asked anybody's permission to do this,
196.346	we're just doing it. (Laughter)
198.639	And we are certainly not waiting for that check
200.4	to drop through the letterbox before we start,
203.138	and most importantly of all, we are not daunted
205.47	by the sophisticated arguments that say,
207.322	"""These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"""
211.218	because I have seen the power of small actions,
214.886	and it is awesome.
216.957	So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)
220.07	We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,
222.959	and then the room exploded.
224.667	I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.
228.555	And it's been the same in every single room, in every town
231.937	that we've ever told our story.
233.492	People are ready and respond to the story of food.
237.836	They want positive actions they can engage in,
240.093	and in their bones, they know it's time
242.692	to take personal responsibility
244.581	and invest in more kindness to each other
247.152	and to the environment.
250.075	And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,
253.389	it's been a heck of a roller coaster.
256.639	We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,
259.535	and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side
261.784	of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,
264.286	and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.
267.64	We took the corner of the car park in the station
269.926	that you saw, and we made vegetable beds
271.661	for everybody to share and pick from themselves.
275.185	We went to the doctors. We've just had
276.494	a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,
279.399	and for some reason that I cannot comprehend,
282.087	it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)
285.88	"So we went to the doctors, said, ""Would you mind us taking them up?"""
288.969	"They said, ""Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission"
291.323	"and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"""
293.245	so we did — (Laughter) — and now there are fruit trees
296.035	and bushes and herbs and vegetables
299.33	around that doctor's surgery.
302.56	And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn
304.836	that was in front of the police station,
306.692	and the old people's home that we've planted it with food
308.509	that they can pick and grow.
310.481	But it isn't just about growing,
312.191	because we all are part of this jigsaw.
314.736	It's about taking those artistic people in your community
317.61	and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds
319.843	to explain to people what's growing there,
321.914	because there's so many people that don't really recognize
324.13	a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic
326.018	with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)
328.09	So we have some people who designed these things,
330.986	"""If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,"
333.003	"help yourself."""
334.98	This is about sharing and investing in kindness.
337.849	And for those people that don't want to do either
339.706	of those things, maybe they can cook,
341.705	so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,
344.578	or in the pub, or in the church,
346.811	or wherever people are living their lives.
348.443	This is about us going to the people and saying,
350.985	"""We are all part of the local food jigsaw,"
353.394	"we are all part of a solution."""
356.049	And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists
358.265	and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,
360.973	we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?
363.549	So we invented, without asking, of course,
365.953	the Incredible Edible Green Route.
368.059	And this is a route of exhibition gardens,
370.784	and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story
375.495	of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed
378.363	that takes people through the whole of our town,
380.969	past our cafes and our small shops, through our market,
384.188	not just to and fro from the supermarket,
387.601	and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall
389.899	around our town, we're also changing their behavior.
392.754	And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.
396.474	Well, we're in partnership with a high school.
398.054	We've created a company. We are designing and building
401.127	an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare
403.175	at the back of the high school, like you do,
405.082	and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables
407.275	in an orchard with bees,
409.824	and the kids are helping us build that,
412.082	and the kids are on the board, and because the community
414.895	was really keen on working with the high school,
416.427	the high school is now teaching agriculture,
419.795	and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,
422.911	how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification
425.694	before in their lives but are really excited about growing,
428.245	how can we give them some more experience?
429.949	So we got some land that was donated
431.908	by a local garden center.
433.166	It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,
436.5	totally voluntary-led, we have turned that
439.11	into a market garden training center,
441.307	and that is polytunnels and raised beds
444.271	and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers
446.975	and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.
449.296	And because we were doing that, some local academics said,
451.504	"""You know, we could help design"
452.836	a commercial horticulture course for you.
454.608	"There's not one that we know of."""
456.003	So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,
458.647	and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.
461.232	And then there's the third plate,
462.851	because if you walk through an edible landscape,
464.669	and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get
467.264	interested in what's growing seasonally,
469.312	you might just want to spend more of your own money
471.224	in support of local producers,
473.304	not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer
475.056	and whatever else it might be.
477.135	But then, we're just a community group, you know.
479.872	We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?
481.83	So we did some really simple things.
483.58	We fundraised, we got some blackboards,
485.367	"we put ""Incredible Edible"" on the top,"
486.537	we gave it every market trader that was selling locally,
488.713	and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.
491.64	Really popular. People congregated around it.
494.096	Sales were up.
495.744	And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,
498.74	"""We're really serious about this,"""
499.717	but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,
502.135	okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create
504.76	a campaign around one product and show them
507.334	there is local loyalty to that product,
509.377	maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.
511.72	So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me --
514.711	called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)
516.784	And what we did was we put people on our egg map.
520.405	It's a stylized map of Togmorden.
522.556	Anybody that's selling their excess eggs
524.195	at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,
526.733	we've stuck on there. We started with four,
529.15	and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was
531.424	that people were then going into shops
532.924	asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that
535.605	was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got
537.894	of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,
540.003	and although these are really, really small steps,
542.584	that increasing local economic confidence
547.273	is starting to play out in a number of ways,
549.85	and we now have farmers doing cheese
551.152	and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,
552.941	they're doing pasties and pies and things
554.349	that they would have never done before.
556.722	We've got increasing market stalls selling local food,
559.343	and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent
563.557	of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line
566.51	had increased because of what we were actually doing.
568.916	And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.
572.006	(Laughter)
573.41	Now, none of this is rocket science.
575.82	It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.
578.699	But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.
582.506	This is not a movement for those people
584.629	that are going to sort themselves out anyway.
586.551	This is a movement for everyone.
589.447	We have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)
593.313	(Applause)
599.402	Across age, across income, across culture.
604.479	It's been really quite a roller coaster experience,
608.086	but going back to that first question that we asked,
610.559	is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.
613.818	More than 30 towns in England now are spinning
616.632	the Incredible Edible plate.
618.76	Whichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,
622.255	they're trying to make their own lives differently,
624.949	and worldwide, we've got communities across America
627.697	and Japan -- it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,
629.441	America and Japan and New Zealand.
631.956	People after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us
634.48	in order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness
637.531	around local growing into the heart of Christchurch.
642.183	And none of this takes more money
645.03	and none of this demands a bureaucracy,
648.157	but it does demand that you think things differently
651.02	and you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs
654.717	in order to create that supportive framework
656.845	that communities can bounce off.
659.559	And there's some great ideas already in our patch.
662.475	Our local authority has decided to make everywhere
665.259	Incredible Edible, and in support of that
667.921	have decided to do two things.
669.406	First, they're going to create an asset register of spare land
672.515	that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities
674.746	can use that wherever they live,
676.482	and they're going to underpin that with a license.
678.659	And then they've said to every single one of their workforce,
681.04	if you can, help those communities grow,
683.537	and help them to maintain their spaces.
685.65	Suddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground
687.689	from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.
689.969	We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded
694.394	of us, and there's lots more you could do.
696.573	I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting
698.933	prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.
702.301	(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create
705.703	edible landscapes so that our children start to walk
708.482	past their food day in, day out, on our high streets,
710.665	in our parks, wherever that might be.
713.251	Inspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart
716.945	of the town and the city plan, not relegate them
720.208	to the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.
723.528	Encourage all our schools to take this seriously.
726.345	This isn't a second class exercise.
728.578	If we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,
731.546	then please let us say to every school,
734.595	create a sense of purpose around the importance
738.575	to the environment, local food and soils.
741.375	Put that at the heart of your school culture,
743.262	and you will create a different generation.
746.424	There are so many things you can do, but ultimately
748.863	this is about something really simple.
751.151	Through an organic process, through
754.776	an increasing recognition of the power of small actions,
759.063	we are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,
762.888	and to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,
766.729	to build a different and a kinder future,
771.122	and in my book, that's incredible.
773.545	Thank you. (Applause)
777.41	(Applause)
787.902	Thank you very much. (Applause)
