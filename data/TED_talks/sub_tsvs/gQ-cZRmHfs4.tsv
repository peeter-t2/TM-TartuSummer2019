26	If you're here today --
27.43	and I'm very happy that you are --
29.388	you've all heard about
29.388	how sustainable development
31.765	will save us from ourselves.
33.751	However, when we're not at TED,
33.751	we are often told
37.274	that a real sustainability policy agenda
37.274	is just not feasible,
41.207	especially in large urban areas
41.207	like New York City.
44.429	And that's because most people
44.429	with decision-making powers,
47.689	in both the public and the private sector,
49.943	really don't feel
49.943	as though they're in danger.
52.578	The reason why I'm here today,
52.578	in part, is because of a dog --
56.695	an abandoned puppy I found
56.695	back in the rain, back in 1998.
59.997	She turned out to be
59.997	a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.
63.431	When she came into my life, we were
63.431	fighting against a huge waste facility
67.43	planned for the East River waterfront
69.916	despite the fact that
69.916	our small part of New York City
72.45	already handled more than 40 percent
72.45	of the entire city's commercial waste:
76.832	a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,
76.832	a sewage sludge plant, four power plants,
82	the world's largest
82	food-distribution center,
84.359	as well as other industries that bring
84.359	more than 60,000 diesel truck trips
88.565	to the area each week.
90.118	The area also has one of the lowest ratios
90.118	of parks to people in the city.
94.11	So when I was contacted
94.11	by the Parks Department
96.427	about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative
96.427	to help develop waterfront projects,
100.609	I thought they were really
100.609	well-meaning, but a bit naive.
103.547	I'd lived in this area all my life,
103.547	and you could not get to the river,
107.238	because of all the lovely facilities
107.238	that I mentioned earlier.
110.555	Then, while jogging
110.555	with my dog one morning,
112.839	she pulled me into what I thought
112.839	was just another illegal dump.
116.606	There were weeds and piles of garbage
116.606	and other stuff that I won't mention here,
120.407	but she kept dragging me,
121.645	and lo and behold, at the end
121.645	of that lot was the river.
124.541	I knew that this forgotten
124.541	little street-end,
126.666	abandoned like the dog that brought
126.666	me there, was worth saving.
129.694	And I knew it would grow
129.694	to become the proud beginnings
132.314	of the community-led revitalization
132.314	of the new South Bronx.
135.322	And just like my new dog, it was an idea
135.322	that got bigger than I'd imagined.
139.325	We garnered much support along the way,
141.484	and the Hunts Point Riverside Park
141.484	became the first waterfront park
144.668	that the South Bronx had had
144.668	in more than 60 years.
147.091	We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant
147.091	more than 300 times,
150.481	into a $3 million park.
152.745	And in the fall, I'm going to exchange
152.745	marriage vows with my beloved.
157.697	(Audience whistles)
158.721	Thank you very much.
160.013	(Applause)
164.579	That's him pressing my buttons
164.579	back there, which he does all the time.
168	(Laughter)
170.488	(Applause)
173.829	But those of us living
173.829	in environmental justice communities
176.631	are the canary in the coal mine.
178.21	We feel the problems right now,
178.21	and have for some time.
182.29	Environmental justice, for those of you
182.29	who may not be familiar with the term,
186	goes something like this:
187.224	no community should be saddled
187.224	with more environmental burdens
190.239	and less environmental benefits
190.239	than any other.
192.929	Unfortunately, race and class
192.929	are extremely reliable indicators
197	as to where one might find the good stuff,
197	like parks and trees,
200.061	and where one might find the bad stuff,
200.061	like power plants and waste facilities.
203.817	As a black person in America,
203.817	I am twice as likely as a white person
207.076	to live in an area where air pollution
207.076	poses the greatest risk to my health.
210.697	I am five times more likely
210.697	to live within walking distance
213.504	of a power plant or chemical facility,
215.437	which I do.
217.149	These land-use decisions
217.149	created the hostile conditions
219.804	that lead to problems like obesity,
219.804	diabetes and asthma.
222.82	Why would someone leave their home to go
222.82	for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?
226.745	Our 27 percent obesity rate
226.745	is high even for this country,
229.68	and diabetes comes with it.
231.117	One out of four South Bronx
231.117	children has asthma.
233.649	Our asthma hospitalization rate
235.488	is seven times higher
235.488	than the national average.
237.795	These impacts are coming everyone's way.
239.77	And we all pay dearly
239.77	for solid waste costs,
242	health problems associated
242	with pollution and more odiously,
245	the cost of imprisoning
245	our young black and Latino men,
248.013	who possess untold amounts
248.013	of untapped potential.
250.792	Fifty percent of our residents
250.792	live at or below the poverty line;
255.675	Low-income citizens often use
255.675	emergency-room visits as primary care.
259.722	This comes at a high cost to taxpayers
259.722	and produces no proportional benefits.
263.645	Poor people are not only still poor,
263.645	they are still unhealthy.
267.512	Fortunately, there are many people
267.512	like me who are striving for solutions
271.321	that won't compromise the lives
272.845	of low-income communities of color
272.845	in the short term,
275.369	and won't destroy us all in the long term.
277.499	None of us want that,
277.499	and we all have that in common.
280.009	So what else do we have in common?
281.672	Well, first of all,
281.672	we're all incredibly good-looking.
284.474	(Laughter)
285.685	Graduated high school, college,
285.685	post-graduate degrees,
288.496	traveled to interesting places,
288.496	didn't have kids in your early teens,
291.832	financially stable, never been imprisoned.
295.688	OK. Good.
296.872	(Laughter)
298.235	But, besides being a black woman,
299.866	I am different from most of you
299.866	in some other ways.
302.552	I watched nearly half of the buildings
302.552	in my neighborhood burn down.
305.967	My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,
307.954	only to be gunned down
307.954	a few blocks from our home.
313.992	Jesus.
315.271	I grew up with a crack house
315.271	across the street.
319.796	Yeah, I'm a poor black child
319.796	from the ghetto.
323.784	These things make me different from you.
325.975	But the things we have in common
327.862	set me apart from most
327.862	of the people in my community,
330.625	and I am in between these two worlds
332.475	with enough of my heart
332.475	to fight for justice in the other.
336.315	So how did things get so different for us?
338.347	In the late '40s, my dad --
338.347	a Pullman porter, son of a slave --
341.702	bought a house in the Hunts Point
341.702	section of the South Bronx,
344.593	and a few years later, he married my mom.
346.632	At the time, the community was a mostly
346.632	white, working-class neighborhood.
350.137	My dad was not alone.
351.687	And as others like him pursued
351.687	their own version of the American dream,
355.148	white flight became common
355.148	in the South Bronx
357.701	and in many cities around the country.
360.018	Red-lining was used by banks,
360.018	wherein certain sections of the city,
363.675	including ours, were deemed
363.675	off-limits to any sort of investment.
367.688	Many landlords believed it was more
367.688	profitable to torch their buildings
371.18	and collect insurance money rather
371.18	than to sell under those conditions --
375.375	dead or injured former tenants
375.375	notwithstanding.
377.839	Hunts Point was formerly
377.839	a walk-to-work community,
380.705	but now residents had neither
380.705	work nor home to walk to.
384.655	A national highway construction boom
384.655	was added to our problems.
387.865	In New York State,
389.04	Robert Moses spearheaded
389.04	an aggressive highway-expansion campaign.
392.847	One of its primary goals was
392.847	to make it easier
395.067	for residents of wealthy communities
395.067	in Westchester County to go to Manhattan.
400.116	The South Bronx, which lies in between,
400.116	did not stand a chance.
403.215	Residents were often given
403.215	less than a month's notice
405.789	before their buildings were razed.
409.791	The common perception was
411.125	that only pimps and pushers
411.125	and prostitutes were from the South Bronx.
415	And if you are told
415	from your earliest days
417.954	that nothing good is going to come
417.954	from your community,
420.595	that it's bad and ugly,
421.77	how could it not reflect on you?
424.335	So now, my family's property
424.335	was worthless,
426.877	save for that it was our home,
426.877	and all we had.
429.543	And luckily for me, that home
429.543	and the love inside of it,
433.293	along with help from teachers, mentors
433.293	and friends along the way, was enough.
438.459	Now, why is this story important?
440.172	Because from a planning perspective,
442.006	economic degradation
442.006	begets environmental degradation,
445.747	which begets social degradation.
448.287	The disinvestment that began
448.287	in the 1960s set the stage
451.374	for all the environmental
451.374	injustices that were to come.
454	Antiquated zoning and land-use
454	regulations are still used to this day
458	to continue putting polluting
458	facilities in my neighborhood.
461.067	Are these factors taken into consideration
461.067	when land-use policy is decided?
464.869	What costs are associated
464.869	with these decisions?
467.489	And who pays? Who profits?
469.749	Does anything justify
469.749	what the local community goes through?
473.392	"This was ""planning"" -- in quotes --"
475.71	that did not have
475.71	our best interests in mind.
478.002	Once we realized that, we decided
478.002	it was time to do our own planning.
481.441	That small park I told you about earlier
483.409	was the first stage of building
483.409	a Greenway movement in the South Bronx.
486.711	I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million
486.711	dollar federal transportation grant
490.087	to design the plan
490.087	for a waterfront esplanade
492.219	with dedicated on-street bike paths.
493.973	Physical improvements help inform
493.973	public policy regarding traffic safety,
497.455	the placement of the waste
497.455	and other facilities,
499.724	which, if done properly, don't compromise
499.724	a community's quality of life.
503.22	They provide opportunities
503.22	to be more physically active,
505.958	as well as local economic development.
508.415	Think bike shops, juice stands.
510.011	We secured 20 million dollars
510.011	to build first-phase projects.
512.906	This is Lafayette Avenue --
514.804	and that's redesigned
514.804	by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
517.985	And once this path is constructed,
517.985	it'll connect the South Bronx
521.03	with more than 400 acres
521.03	of Randall's Island Park.
523.403	Right now we're separated by about 25 feet
523.403	of water, but this link will change that.
527.401	As we nurture the natural environment,
527.401	its abundance will give us back even more.
531.689	We run a project called the Bronx
531.689	[Environmental] Stewardship Training,
535.524	which provides job training in the fields
535.524	of ecological restoration,
538.855	so that folks from our community
538.855	have the skills to compete
541.68	for these well-paying jobs.
543.043	Little by little, we're seeding
543.043	the area with green-collar jobs --
546.404	and with people that have both
546.404	a financial and personal stake
549.287	in their environment.
550.468	The Sheridan Expressway
550.468	is an underutilized relic
553.135	of the Robert Moses era,
554.358	built with no regard for the neighborhoods
554.358	that were divided by it.
557.758	Even during rush hour,
557.758	it goes virtually unused.
560.551	The community created
560.551	an alternative transportation plan
563.247	that allows for the removal
563.247	of the highway.
565.897	We have the opportunity now to bring
565.897	together all the stakeholders
569.044	to re-envision how this 28 acres
569.044	can be better utilized
571.656	for parkland, affordable housing
571.656	and local economic development.
574.722	We also built New York City's first green
574.722	and cool roof demonstration project
579.573	on top of our offices.
580.985	Cool roofs are highly-reflective
580.985	surfaces that don't absorb solar heat,
584.474	and pass it on to
584.474	the building or atmosphere.
586.601	Green roofs are soil and living plants.
588.657	Both can be used instead
588.657	of petroleum-based roofing materials
591.928	that absorb heat, contribute
591.928	"to urban ""heat island"" effect"
594.723	and degrade under the sun,
596.072	which we in turn breathe.
597.318	Green roofs also retain
597.318	up to 75 percent of rainfall,
600	so they reduce a city's need to fund
600	costly end-of-pipe solutions --
603.683	which, incidentally, are often located
605.527	in environmental justice
605.527	communities like mine.
607.772	And they provide habitats
607.772	for our little friends!
611.096	[Butterfly]
612.277	(Laughter)
613.524	So cool!
614.731	Anyway, the demonstration
614.731	project is a springboard
617.261	for our own green roof
617.261	installation business,
619.409	bringing jobs and sustainable
619.409	economic activity to the South Bronx.
622.935	[Green is the new black ...]
624.335	(Laughter) (Applause)
628.502	I like that, too.
630.177	Anyway, I know Chris told us
630.177	not to do pitches up here,
633.897	but since I have all of your attention:
635.801	We need investors. End of pitch.
637.412	It's better to ask
637.412	for forgiveness than permission.
639.824	Anyway --
641.004	(Laughter)
642.488	(Applause)
647.431	OK. Katrina.
650.884	Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx
650.884	and New Orleans' Ninth Ward
653.932	had a lot in common.
655.145	Both were largely populated
655.145	by poor people of color,
657.923	both hotbeds of cultural innovation:
657.923	think hip-hop and jazz.
661.242	Both are waterfront communities
661.242	that host both industries and residents
664.6	in close proximity of one another.
666.51	In the post-Katrina era,
666.51	we have still more in common.
669.582	We're at best ignored,
669.582	and maligned and abused, at worst,
673.084	by negligent regulatory agencies,
673.084	pernicious zoning
676.455	and lax governmental accountability.
678.652	Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward
678.652	nor the South Bronx was inevitable.
683.104	But we have emerged with valuable lessons
685.264	about how to dig ourselves out.
687.561	We are more than simply
687.561	national symbols of urban blight
691.387	or problems to be solved
691.387	by empty campaign promises
694.717	of presidents come and gone.
696.351	Now will we let the Gulf Coast
696.351	languish for a decade or two,
699.194	like the South Bronx did?
700.48	Or will we take proactive steps
701.988	and learn from the homegrown resource
701.988	of grassroots activists
704.949	that have been born of desperation
704.949	in communities like mine?
707.819	Now listen, I do not expect individuals,
710.486	corporations or government
710.486	to make the world a better place
713.295	because it is right or moral.
715.596	This presentation today only represents
715.596	some of what I've been through.
719.9	Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.
722	But I'll tell you later,
722	if you want to know.
724.12	(Laughter)
725.209	But -- I know it's the bottom line,
725.209	or one's perception of it,
729.523	that motivates people in the end.
731.283	I'm interested in what I like to call
731.283	"the ""triple bottom line"""
734.229	that sustainable development can produce.
736.477	Developments that have the potential
736.477	to create positive returns
740.423	for all concerned:
740.423	the developers, government
743.549	and the community
743.549	where these projects go up.
746.009	At present, that's not happening
746.009	in New York City.
749.311	And we are operating with a comprehensive
749.311	urban-planning deficit.
753.358	A parade of government subsidies
755.477	is going to propose big-box and stadium
755.477	developments in the South Bronx,
759.053	but there is scant coordination
759.053	between city agencies
762.16	on how to deal with the cumulative effects
762.16	of increased traffic, pollution,
765.934	solid waste and the impacts on open space.
768.483	And their approaches to local economic
768.483	and job development are so lame
772.887	it's not even funny.
774.082	Because on top of that,
776.305	the world's richest sports team
776.305	is replacing the House That Ruth Built
780.752	by destroying two
780.752	well-loved community parks.
783.593	Now, we'll have even less
783.593	than that stat I told you about earlier.
786.728	And although less than 25 percent
786.728	of South Bronx residents own cars,
790.07	these projects include
790.07	thousands of new parking spaces,
793.768	yet zip in terms of mass public transit.
797.046	Now, what's missing from the larger debate
799.102	is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis
801.055	between not fixing an unhealthy,
801.055	environmentally-challenged community,
804.478	versus incorporating structural,
804.478	sustainable changes.
808.109	My agency is working closely
808.109	with Columbia University and others
811.364	to shine a light on these issues.
812.974	Now let's get this straight:
812.974	I am not anti-development.
816.197	Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.
818.629	And I've embraced my inner capitalist.
821.692	And, but I don't have --
823.193	(Laughter)
824.842	You probably all have,
824.842	and if you haven't, you need to.
827.462	(Laughter)
831.256	So I don't have a problem
831.256	with developers making money.
834.696	There's enough precedent out there
834.696	to show that a sustainable,
837.67	community-friendly development
837.67	can still make a fortune.
842.085	Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough
842.085	and Amory Lovins --
845.181	both heroes of mine by the way --
845.181	have shown that you can actually do that.
849.174	I do have a problem
849.174	with developments that hyper-exploit
852	politically vulnerable
852	communities for profit.
854.191	That it continues is a shame upon us all,
857.063	because we are all responsible
857.063	for the future that we create.
860.028	But one of the things I do
860.028	to remind myself of greater possibilities,
863.299	is to learn from visionaries
863.299	in other cities.
865.457	This is my version of globalization.
867.513	Let's take Bogota.
869.07	Poor, Latino, surrounded by
869.07	runaway gun violence and drug trafficking;
872.887	a reputation not unlike
872.887	that of the South Bronx.
875.749	However, this city was blessed
875.749	in the late 1990s
879	with a highly-influential
879	mayor named Enrique Peñalosa.
883.048	He looked at the demographics.
884.853	Few Bogotanos own cars,
886.608	yet a huge portion of the city's resources
886.608	was dedicated to serving them.
890.67	If you're a mayor, you can
890.67	do something about that.
893.079	His administration narrowed key municipal
893.079	thoroughfares from five lanes to three,
897.359	outlawed parking on those streets,
899.646	expanded pedestrian walkways
899.646	and bike lanes,
902.449	created public plazas,
904.404	created one of the most efficient
904.404	bus mass-transit systems
907.295	in the entire world.
908.801	For his brilliant efforts,
908.801	he was nearly impeached.
913.186	But as people began to see
913.186	that they were being put first
916.916	on issues reflecting
916.916	their day-to-day lives,
919.15	incredible things happened.
920.505	People stopped littering.
921.921	Crime rates dropped, because the streets
921.921	were alive with people.
925.83	His administration attacked several
925.83	typical urban problems at one time,
929.733	and on a third-world budget, at that.
931.868	We have no excuse
931.868	in this country, I'm sorry.
934.591	But the bottom line is:
934.591	their people-first agenda
937.456	was not meant to penalize
937.456	those who could actually afford cars,
941.394	but rather, to provide opportunities
941.394	for all Bogotanos to participate
945.283	in the city's resurgence.
946.929	That development should not come
949.113	at the expense of the majority
949.113	of the population
951.724	is still considered
951.724	a radical idea here in the U.S.
954.518	But Bogota's example
954.518	has the power to change that.
957.327	You, however, are blessed
957.327	with the gift of influence.
960.844	That's why you're here and why you
960.844	value the information we exchange.
964.59	Use your influence
965.964	in support of comprehensive,
965.964	sustainable change everywhere.
969.567	Don't just talk about it at TED.
971.985	This is a nationwide policy agenda
971.985	I'm trying to build,
976.119	and as you all know,
976.119	politics are personal.
979.118	Help me make green the new black.
981.592	Help me make sustainability sexy.
983.753	Make it a part of your dinner
983.753	and cocktail conversations.
987.174	Help me fight for environmental
987.174	and economic justice.
990.301	Support investments
990.301	with a triple-bottom-line return.
993	Help me democratize sustainability
993	by bringing everyone to the table,
997.564	and insisting that comprehensive
997.564	planning can be addressed everywhere.
1000.937	Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
1002.869	Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore
1002.869	the other day after breakfast,
1006.838	I asked him how environmental justice
1006.838	activists were going to be included
1011.61	in his new marketing strategy.
1013.86	His response was a grant program.
1017.692	I don't think he understood
1017.692	that I wasn't asking for funding.
1023.736	I was making him an offer.
1027.233	(Applause)
1034.983	What troubled me was that this
1034.983	top-down approach is still around.
1040.26	Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
1042.174	(Laughter)
1043.61	But grassroots groups
1043.61	are needed at the table
1047.741	during the decision-making process.
1050.583	Of the 90 percent of the energy
1050.583	that Mr. Gore reminded us
1054.651	that we waste every day,
1056.097	don't add wasting our energy, intelligence
1059.291	and hard-earned experience to that count.
1063.158	(Applause)
1068.645	I have come from so far
1068.645	to meet you like this.
1076.436	Please don't waste me.
1080.628	By working together,
1081.806	we can become one of those small,
1081.806	rapidly-growing groups of individuals
1086.808	who actually have the audacity and courage
1089.039	to believe that we actually
1089.039	can change the world.
1092.238	We might have come to this conference
1094.032	from very, very different
1094.032	stations in life,
1096.588	but believe me, we all share
1096.588	one incredibly powerful thing.
1103.517	We have nothing to lose
1103.517	and everything to gain.
1108.675	Ciao, bellos!
1109.875	(Applause)
