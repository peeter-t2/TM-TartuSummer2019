12.771	For me they normally happen,
12.771	these career crises,
15.168	often, actually, on a Sunday evening,
17.739	just as the sun is starting to set,
19.636	and the gap between my hopes for myself
19.636	and the reality of my life
24.318	starts to diverge so painfully
26.16	that I normally end up
26.16	weeping into a pillow.
29.16	I'm mentioning all this --
30.689	I'm mentioning all this because I think
30.689	this is not merely a personal problem;
34.396	you may think I'm wrong in this,
35.956	but I think we live in an age
35.956	when our lives are regularly punctuated
39.563	by career crises, by moments
39.563	when what we thought we knew --
42.729	about our lives, about our careers --
44.563	comes into contact
44.563	with a threatening sort of reality.
48.016	It's perhaps easier now than ever before
48.016	to make a good living.
51.793	It's perhaps harder than ever before
54.16	to stay calm, to be free
54.16	of career anxiety.
57.16	I want to look now, if I may,
57.16	at some of the reasons
60.573	why we might be feeling
60.573	anxiety about our careers.
64.16	Why we might be victims
64.16	of these career crises,
66.423	as we're weeping softly into our pillows.
70.393	One of the reasons
70.393	why we might be suffering
73.16	is that we are surrounded by snobs.
75.742	In a way, I've got some bad news,
78.16	particularly to anybody
78.16	who's come to Oxford from abroad.
80.946	There's a real problem with snobbery,
82.748	because sometimes people
82.748	from outside the U.K.
84.938	imagine that snobbery
84.938	is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,
87.669	fixated on country houses and titles.
90.16	The bad news is that's not true.
91.848	Snobbery is a global phenomenon;
91.848	we are a global organization,
94.848	this is a global phenomenon.
96.229	What is a snob?
97.888	A snob is anybody who takes
97.888	a small part of you,
101.221	and uses that to come
101.221	to a complete vision of who you are.
104.61	That is snobbery.
106.16	The dominant kind of snobbery
106.16	that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
110.509	You encounter it within minutes
110.509	at a party, when you get asked
113.78	that famous iconic question
113.78	of the early 21st century,
116.971	"""What do you do?"""
118.168	According to how you answer that question,
120.193	people are either incredibly
120.193	delighted to see you,
122.551	or look at their watch
122.551	and make their excuses.
124.757	(Laughter)
125.797	Now, the opposite of a snob
125.797	is your mother.
128.16	(Laughter)
130.16	Not necessarily your mother,
130.16	or indeed mine,
133.161	but, as it were, the ideal mother,
134.82	somebody who doesn't care
134.82	about your achievements.
137.192	Unfortunately, most people
137.192	are not our mothers.
139.414	Most people make a strict correlation
139.414	between how much time,
142.256	and if you like, love --
143.673	not romantic love,
143.673	though that may be something --
146.16	but love in general, respect --
146.16	they are willing to accord us,
149.479	that will be strictly defined
149.479	by our position in the social hierarchy.
153.16	And that's a lot of the reason
153.16	why we care so much about our careers
156.423	and indeed start caring
156.423	so much about material goods.
160.16	You know, we're often told
160.16	that we live in very materialistic times,
163.423	that we're all greedy people.
165.16	I don't think we are
165.16	particularly materialistic.
167.47	I think we live in a society which has
167.47	simply pegged certain emotional rewards
171.922	to the acquisition of material goods.
174.158	It's not the material goods we want;
174.158	it's the rewards we want.
177.112	It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
179.144	The next time you see somebody
179.144	driving a Ferrari, don't think,
182.129	"""This is somebody who's greedy."""
183.977	"Think, ""This is somebody who is incredibly"
183.977	"vulnerable and in need of love."""
187.719	(Laughter)
191.16	Feel sympathy, rather than contempt.
193.587	There are other reasons --
195.119	(Laughter)
196.16	There are other reasons why it's perhaps
196.16	harder now to feel calm than ever before.
200.106	One of these, and it's paradoxical,
201.806	because it's linked to something
201.806	that's rather nice,
204.34	is the hope we all have for our careers.
206.41	Never before have
206.41	expectations been so high
208.532	about what human beings can
208.532	achieve with their lifespan.
211.279	We're told, from many sources,
211.279	that anyone can achieve anything.
214.332	We've done away with the caste system,
216.239	we are now in a system where anyone
216.239	can rise to any position they please.
219.954	And it's a beautiful idea.
222.16	Along with that is a kind
222.16	of spirit of equality;
224.637	we're all basically equal.
226.018	There are no strictly defined hierarchies.
230.16	There is one really big problem with this,
232.646	and that problem is envy.
234.679	Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,
236.966	but if there's one dominant emotion
236.966	in modern society, that is envy.
240.47	And it's linked to the spirit of equality.
243.161	Let me explain.
244.336	I think it would be very unusual
244.336	for anyone here, or anyone watching,
247.621	to be envious of the Queen of England.
249.517	Even though she is much richer
249.517	than any of you are,
252.778	and she's got a very large house,
255.064	the reason why we don't envy her
255.064	is because she's too weird.
258.746	(Laughter)
259.778	She's simply too strange.
261.159	We can't relate to her,
261.159	she speaks in a funny way,
263.564	she comes from an odd place.
264.961	So we can't relate to her,
266.358	and when you can't relate
266.358	to somebody, you don't envy them.
269.28	The closer two people are --
269.28	in age, in background,
272.16	in the process of identification --
272.16	the more there's a danger of envy,
275.502	which is incidentally why none of you
275.502	should ever go to a school reunion,
279.001	because there is no stronger reference
279.001	point than people one was at school with.
283.124	The problem of modern society is
283.124	it turns the whole world into a school.
286.686	Everybody's wearing jeans,
286.686	everybody's the same.
288.98	And yet, they're not.
290.159	So there's a spirit of equality
290.159	combined with deep inequality,
293.16	which can make for
293.16	a very stressful situation.
295.875	It's probably as unlikely
295.875	that you would nowadays
298.224	become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,
300.16	as it was unlikely in the 17th century
302.16	that you would accede to the ranks
302.16	of the French aristocracy.
305.426	But the point is,
305.426	it doesn't feel that way.
307.498	It's made to feel, by magazines
307.498	and other media outlets,
310.588	that if you've got energy, a few bright
310.588	ideas about technology, a garage --
314.468	you, too, could start a major thing.
316.923	(Laughter)
318.302	The consequences of this problem
318.302	make themselves felt in bookshops.
321.565	When you go to a large bookshop
321.565	and look at the self-help sections,
324.78	as I sometimes do --
325.984	if you analyze self-help books
325.984	produced in the world today,
329.094	there are basically two kinds.
330.565	"The first kind tells you, ""You can do it!"
330.565	"You can make it! Anything's possible!"""
334.375	The other kind tells you how to cope with
334.375	"what we politely call ""low self-esteem,"""
338.995	or impolitely call,
338.995	"""feeling very bad about yourself."""
341.646	There's a real correlation
343.16	between a society that tells people
343.16	that they can do anything,
347.16	and the existence of low self-esteem.
349.16	So that's another way in which something
349.16	quite positive can have a nasty kickback.
353.16	There is another reason why
353.16	we might be feeling more anxious --
356.509	about our careers, about our status
356.509	in the world today, than ever before.
360.16	And it's, again, linked to something nice.
362.232	And that nice thing is called meritocracy.
364.954	Everybody, all politicians
364.954	on Left and Right,
367.28	agree that meritocracy is a great thing,
369.521	and we should all be trying to make
369.521	our societies really, really meritocratic.
373.691	In other words --
373.691	what is a meritocratic society?
377.034	A meritocratic society is one in which,
377.034	if you've got talent and energy and skill,
381.184	you will get to the top,
381.184	nothing should hold you back.
383.78	It's a beautiful idea.
384.966	The problem is, if you
384.966	really believe in a society
388.314	where those who merit to get
388.314	to the top, get to the top,
391.006	you'll also, by implication,
391.006	and in a far more nasty way,
394.035	believe in a society where those
394.035	who deserve to get to the bottom
397.756	also get to the bottom and stay there.
400.003	In other words, your position in life
400.003	comes to seem not accidental,
403.375	but merited and deserved.
405.16	And that makes failure
405.16	seem much more crushing.
408.16	You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,
410.562	when you met a very poor person,
412.458	that person would be described
412.458	"as an ""unfortunate"" --"
415.346	literally, somebody who had not
415.346	been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.
419.16	Nowadays, particularly
419.16	in the United States,
421.28	if you meet someone
421.28	at the bottom of society,
423.447	they may unkindly be
423.447	"described as a ""loser."""
426.16	There's a real difference
426.16	between an unfortunate and a loser,
429.16	and that shows 400 years
429.16	of evolution in society
432.16	and our belief in who
432.16	is responsible for our lives.
435.281	It's no longer the gods, it's us.
435.281	We're in the driving seat.
438.16	That's exhilarating if you're doing well,
440.16	and very crushing if you're not.
442.036	It leads, in the worst cases --
443.602	in the analysis of a sociologist
443.602	like Emil Durkheim --
446.593	it leads to increased rates of suicide.
448.924	There are more suicides
448.924	in developed, individualistic countries
452.16	than in any other part of the world.
453.925	And some of the reason for that
455.523	is that people take what happens to them
455.523	extremely personally --
458.616	they own their success,
458.616	but they also own their failure.
462.159	Is there any relief
462.159	from some of these pressures
464.47	that I've been outlining?
465.831	I think there is.
467.014	I just want to turn to a few of them.
468.804	Let's take meritocracy.
470.16	This idea that everybody deserves
470.16	to get where they get to,
473.16	I think it's a crazy idea,
473.16	completely crazy.
475.992	I will support any politician
475.992	of Left and Right,
478.268	with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;
480.586	I am a meritocrat in that sense.
482.16	But I think it's insane to believe
483.856	that we will ever make a society
483.856	that is genuinely meritocratic;
487.337	it's an impossible dream.
488.595	The idea that we will make a society
488.595	where literally everybody is graded,
492.08	the good at the top, bad at the bottom,
494	exactly done as it
494	should be, is impossible.
496.16	There are simply too many random factors:
498.16	accidents, accidents of birth,
500.16	accidents of things dropping
500.16	on people's heads, illnesses, etc.
503.184	We will never get to grade them,
505.16	never get to grade people as they should.
507.16	I'm drawn to a lovely quote
507.16	"by St. Augustine in ""The City of God,"""
510.327	"where he says, ""It's a sin"
510.327	"to judge any man by his post."""
514.764	In modern English that would mean
516.43	it's a sin to come to any view
516.43	of who you should talk to,
519.178	dependent on their business card.
520.785	It's not the post that should count.
522.56	According to St. Augustine, only God
522.56	can really put everybody in their place;
526.364	he's going to do that
526.364	on the Day of Judgment,
528.523	with angels and trumpets,
528.523	and the skies will open.
530.929	Insane idea, if you're
530.929	a secularist person, like me.
533.46	But something very valuable
533.46	in that idea, nevertheless.
536.104	In other words, hold your horses
536.104	when you're coming to judge people.
539.46	You don't necessarily know
539.46	what someone's true value is.
542.16	That is an unknown part of them,
544.16	and we shouldn't behave
544.16	as though it is known.
547.379	There is another source of solace
547.379	and comfort for all this.
550.204	When we think about failing in life,
550.204	when we think about failure,
553.353	one of the reasons why we fear failing
555.219	is not just a loss of income,
555.219	a loss of status.
557.518	What we fear is the judgment
557.518	and ridicule of others.
560.285	And it exists.
561.462	The number one organ of ridicule,
561.462	nowadays, is the newspaper.
565.042	If you open the newspaper
565.042	any day of the week,
567.255	it's full of people
567.255	who've messed up their lives.
569.595	They've slept with the wrong person,
569.595	taken the wrong substance,
572.612	passed the wrong piece of legislation --
574.658	whatever it is, and then
574.658	are fit for ridicule.
576.85	In other words, they have failed.
576.85	"And they are described as ""losers."""
580.159	Now, is there any alternative to this?
582.011	I think the Western tradition shows us one
582.011	glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
586.631	Tragic art, as it developed
586.631	in the theaters of ancient Greece,
589.877	in the fifth century B.C.,
589.877	was essentially an art form
592.671	devoted to tracing how people fail,
595.16	and also according them
595.16	a level of sympathy,
599.567	which ordinary life would not
599.567	necessarily accord them.
602.867	A few years ago,
602.867	I was thinking about this,
604.931	"and I went to ""The Sunday Sport,"""
606.55	a tabloid newspaper I don't
606.55	recommend you start reading
609.184	if you're not familiar with it already.
611.105	(Laughter)
612.137	And I went to talk to them
613.403	about certain of the great
613.403	tragedies of Western art.
616.168	I wanted to see how they would seize
616.168	the bare bones of certain stories,
619.777	if they came in as a news item
619.777	at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.
623.761	I mentioned Othello; they'd not
623.761	heard of it but were fascinated.
626.909	(Laughter)
627.941	I asked them to write
627.941	a headline for the story.
630.267	"They came up with ""Love-Crazed"
630.267	"Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."""
633.73	Splashed across the headline.
635.16	I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
637.184	Again, a book they were
637.184	enchanted to discover.
639.399	"And they wrote ""Shopaholic Adulteress"
639.399	"Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."""
644.16	(Laughter)
645.2	And then my favorite --
646.407	they really do have a kind of genius
646.407	of their own, these guys --
649.51	my favorite is Sophocles'
649.51	Oedipus the King:
651.628	"""Sex With Mum Was Blinding."""
654.16	(Laughter)
657.16	(Applause)
659.16	In a way, if you like, at one end
659.16	of the spectrum of sympathy,
662.16	you've got the tabloid newspaper.
663.977	At the other end of the spectrum,
663.977	you've got tragedy and tragic art.
667.192	And I suppose I'm arguing
667.192	that we should learn a little bit
669.99	about what's happening in tragic art.
671.8	It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
674.522	He is not a loser, though he has lost.
676.857	And I think that is the message
676.857	of tragedy to us,
679.518	and why it's so very,
679.518	very important, I think.
682.16	The other thing about modern society
682.16	and why it causes this anxiety,
686.16	is that we have nothing at its center
686.16	that is non-human.
689.16	We are the first society
689.16	to be living in a world
691.772	where we don't worship
691.772	anything other than ourselves.
694.288	We think very highly of ourselves,
694.288	and so we should;
696.757	we've put people on the Moon,
696.757	done all sorts of extraordinary things.
700.074	And so we tend to worship ourselves.
700.074	Our heroes are human heroes.
703.391	That's a very new situation.
704.978	Most other societies have had,
704.978	right at their center,
707.509	the worship of something transcendent:
707.509	a god, a spirit, a natural force,
710.954	the universe, whatever it is --
710.954	something else that is being worshiped.
714.328	We've slightly lost
714.328	the habit of doing that,
716.424	which is, I think, why we're
716.424	particularly drawn to nature.
719.216	Not for the sake of our health,
719.216	though it's often presented that way,
722.496	but because it's an escape
722.496	from the human anthill.
725.16	It's an escape from our own competition,
727.16	and our own dramas.
729.16	And that's why we enjoy looking
729.16	at glaciers and oceans,
731.804	and contemplating the Earth
731.804	from outside its perimeters, etc.
735.779	We like to feel in contact
735.779	with something that is non-human,
739.382	and that is so deeply important to us.
743.16	What I think I've been talking
743.16	about really is success and failure.
746.375	And one of the interesting
746.375	things about success
748.828	is that we think we know what it means.
750.836	If I said that there's somebody
750.836	behind the screen who's very successful,
754.257	certain ideas would
754.257	immediately come to mind.
756.658	You'd think that person
756.658	might have made a lot of money,
759.332	achieved renown in some field.
761.264	My own theory of success --
762.617	I'm somebody who's
762.617	very interested in success,
764.8	I really want to be successful,
766.305	always thinking,
766.305	how can I be more successful?
768.511	But as I get older, I'm also very nuanced
768.511	"about what that word ""success"" might mean."
772.865	Here's an insight
772.865	that I've had about success:
775.103	You can't be successful at everything.
777.008	We hear a lot of talk
777.008	about work-life balance.
779.295	Nonsense.
780.47	You can't have it all. You can't.
782.16	So any vision of success
782.16	has to admit what it's losing out on,
786.659	where the element of loss is.
788.36	And I think any wise life will accept,
790.908	as I say, that there is going to be
790.908	an element where we're not succeeding.
794.708	And the thing about a successful life
794.708	is that a lot of the time,
797.74	our ideas of what it would mean
797.74	to live successfully are not our own.
801.654	They're sucked in from other people;
803.393	chiefly, if you're a man, your father,
803.393	and if you're a woman, your mother.
807.021	Psychoanalysis has been drumming home
807.021	this message for about 80 years.
810.41	No one's quite listening hard enough,
810.41	but I very much believe it's true.
813.941	And we also suck in messages
813.941	from everything from the television,
817.083	to advertising, to marketing, etc.
818.893	These are hugely powerful forces
821.16	that define what we want
821.16	and how we view ourselves.
825.16	When we're told that banking
825.16	is a very respectable profession,
828.16	a lot of us want to go into banking.
830.16	When banking is no longer so respectable,
830.16	we lose interest in banking.
833.518	We are highly open to suggestion.
836.6	So what I want to argue for
836.6	is not that we should give up
839.521	on our ideas of success,
841.16	but we should make sure
841.16	that they are our own.
843.375	We should focus in on our ideas,
845.16	and make sure that we own them;
847.915	that we are truly the authors
847.915	of our own ambitions.
850.36	Because it's bad enough
850.36	not getting what you want,
853.185	but it's even worse to have
853.185	an idea of what it is you want,
856.296	and find out, at the end of the journey,
858.36	that it isn't, in fact,
858.36	what you wanted all along.
861.548	So, I'm going to end it there.
863.16	But what I really want to stress is:
863.16	by all means, success, yes.
868.16	But let's accept the strangeness
868.16	of some of our ideas.
870.756	Let's probe away
870.756	at our notions of success.
873.525	Let's make sure our ideas of success
873.525	are truly our own.
877.16	Thank you very much.
879.16	(Applause)
894.858	Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.
896.699	But how do you reconcile this idea
902.16	of it being bad to think
902.16	"of someone as a ""loser,"""
904.954	with the idea that a lot of people like,
904.954	of seizing control of your life,
909.816	and that a society that encourages that,
912.745	perhaps has to have
912.745	some winners and losers?
915.16	Alain De Botton: Yes, I think
915.16	it's merely the randomness
917.835	of the winning and losing process
917.835	that I want to stress,
920.525	because the emphasis nowadays is so much
920.525	on the justice of everything,
924.16	and politicians always talk about justice.
926.185	Now I'm a firm believer in justice,
926.185	I just think that it's impossible.
929.617	So we should do everything
929.617	we can to pursue it,
933.244	but we should always remember
933.244	that whoever is facing us,
936.704	whatever has happened in their lives,
938.871	there will be a strong
938.871	element of the haphazard.
941.16	That's what I'm trying to leave room for;
943.4	otherwise, it can get
943.4	quite claustrophobic.
945.49	CA: I mean, do you believe
945.49	that you can combine
947.739	your kind of kinder,
947.739	gentler philosophy of work
950.048	with a successful economy?
953.16	Or do you think that you can't,
954.966	but it doesn't matter that much that we're
954.966	putting too much emphasis on that?
958.664	AB: The nightmare thought
960.16	is that frightening people
960.16	is the best way to get work out of them,
964.16	and that somehow
964.16	the crueler the environment,
967.596	the more people will rise
967.596	to the challenge.
969.985	You want to think, who would you like
969.985	as your ideal dad?
972.954	And your ideal dad is somebody
972.954	who is tough but gentle.
976.16	And it's a very hard line to make.
978.397	We need fathers, as it were,
978.397	the exemplary father figures in society,
982.16	avoiding the two extremes,
984.607	which is the authoritarian
984.607	disciplinarian on the one hand,
988.16	and on the other,
988.16	the lax, no-rules option.
992.985	CA: Alain De Botton.
994.382	AB: Thank you very much.
996.161	(Applause)
