12.869	Four years ago,
14.62	a security researcher,
16.422	or, as most people would call it, a hacker,
20.671	found a way to literally
22.838	make ATMs throw money at him.
26.041	His name was Barnaby Jack,
29.382	"and this technique was later called ""jackpotting"""
33.041	in his honor.
34.95	I'm here today because I think
36.799	we actually need hackers.
39.85	Barnaby Jack
41.712	could have easily turned
43.199	into a career criminal or James Bond villain
47.397	with his knowledge,
48.893	but he chose to show the world
51.381	his research instead.
54.07	He believed that sometimes
55.923	you have to demo a threat
57.963	to spark a solution.
60.88	And I feel the same way.
62.81	That's why I'm here today.
64.66	We are often terrified and fascinated
67.938	by the power hackers now have.
71.399	They scare us.
73.131	But the choices they make
75.116	have dramatic outcomes
77.286	that influence us all.
80.274	So I am here today because I think we need hackers,
83.609	and in fact, they just might be
87.192	the immune system for the information age.
91.532	Sometimes they make us sick,
93.565	but they also find those hidden threats
96.92	in our world,
98.244	and they make us fix it.
101.089	I knew that I might get hacked
103.447	for giving this talk,
105.855	so let me save you the effort.
108.328	In true TED fashion,
110.162	here is my most embarrassing picture.
114.135	But it would be difficult for you to find me in it,
117.005	because I'm the one who looks like a boy
120.743	standing to the side.
122.548	I was such a nerd back then
124.93	that even the boys on the
124.93	Dungeons and Dragons team
127.532	wouldn't let me join.
129.729	This is who I was,
131.714	but this is who I wanted to be:
135.829	Angelina Jolie.
137.727	She portrayed Acid Burn
139.282	"in the '95 film ""Hackers."""
141.776	She was pretty and she could rollerblade,
144.954	but being a hacker, that made her powerful.
149.063	And I wanted to be just like her,
151.523	so I started spending a lot of time
153.889	on hacker chat rooms and online forums.
156.774	I remember one late night
159.107	I found a bit of PHP code.
161.368	I didn't really know what it did,
162.99	but I copy-pasted it
164.615	and used it anyway
166.329	to get into a password-protected site
168.802	like that.
170.606	Open Sesame.
172.009	It was a simple trick,
173.531	and I was just a script kiddie back then,
176.536	but to me, that trick,
177.974	it felt like this,
180.189	like I had discovered limitless potential
182.633	at my fingertips.
184.424	This is the rush of power that hackers feel.
187.733	It's geeks just like me
190.637	discovering they have access to superpower,
193.869	one that requires the skill and tenacity
196.496	of their intellect,
198.004	but thankfully no radioactive spiders.
201.565	But with great power
203.406	comes great responsibility,
205.71	and you all like to think that if we had such powers,
209.374	we would only use them for good.
211.653	But what if you could read your ex's emails,
215	or add a couple zeros to your bank account.
218.112	What would you do then?
220.132	Indeed, many hackers do not resist
222.369	those temptations,
224.357	and so they are responsible in one way or another
227.482	to billions of dollars lost each year
229.886	to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,
233.147	which is a serious issue.
235.025	But there are other hackers,
237.01	hackers who just like to break things,
239.772	and it is precisely those hackers
242.48	that can find the weaker elements in our world
245.773	and make us fix it.
247.45	This is what happened last year
249.37	when another security researcher
251.379	called Kyle Lovett
252.944	discovered a gaping hole
254.501	in the design of certain wireless routers
257.461	like you might have in your home or office.
260	He learned that anyone could remotely connect
262.645	to these devices over the Internet
264.967	and download documents from hard drives
267.728	attached to those routers,
269.903	no password needed.
271.75	He reported it to the company, of course,
274.087	but they ignored his report.
276.401	Perhaps they thought universal access
278.265	was a feature, not a bug,
281.25	until two months ago
283.105	when a group of hackers used it
284.538	to get into people's files.
286.992	But they didn't steal anything.
289.393	They left a note:
291.41	Your router and your documents
293.288	can be accessed by anyone in the world.
295.447	Here's what you should do to fix it.
297.715	We hope we helped.
300.093	By getting into people's files like that,
302.623	yeah, they broke the law,
304.083	but they also forced that company
306.551	to fix their product.
308.532	Making vulnerabilities known to the public
310.7	is a practice called full disclosure
313.445	in the hacker community,
315.047	and it is controversial,
317.081	but it does make me think of how hackers
319.613	have an evolving effect on technologies we use
322.599	every day.
324.095	This is what Khalil did.
326.373	Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,
328.988	and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook
332.997	which he attempted to report
334.847	through the company's bug bounty program.
337.837	These are usually great arrangements for companies
340.494	to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities
343.671	they find in their code.
345.36	Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,
348.91	his report was not acknowledged.
351.946	Frustrated with the exchange,
353.791	he took to use his own discovery
357.068	to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.
360.203	This got their attention, all right,
362.97	and they fixed the bug,
366.265	but because he hadn't reported it properly,
369.12	he was denied the bounty usually paid out
371.345	for such discoveries.
373.349	Thankfully for Khalil,
375.338	a group of hackers were watching out for him.
378.224	In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars
382.033	to reward him for this discovery,
384.111	raising a vital discussion in the technology industry
387.311	about how we come up with incentives
390.37	for hackers to do the right thing.
392.96	But I think there's a greater story here still.
395.98	Even companies founded by hackers,
398.915	like Facebook was,
401.302	still have a complicated relationship
403.885	when it comes to hackers.
405.689	And so for more conservative organizations,
408.52	it is going to take time and adapting
412.038	in order to embrace hacker culture
414.62	and the creative chaos that it brings with it.
417.741	But I think it's worth the effort,
420.183	because the alternative,
422.163	to blindly fight all hackers,
425.993	is to go against the power you cannot control
428.581	at the cost of stifling innovation
431.882	and regulating knowledge.
434.076	These are things that will come back and bite you.
438.37	It is even more true
439.848	if we go after hackers
441.927	that are willing to risk their own freedom
444.964	for ideals like the freedom of the web,
447.867	especially in times like this, like today even,
451.93	as governments and corporates
454.55	fight to control the Internet.
457.776	I find it astounding
460.1	that someone from the shadowy
460.1	corners of cyberspace
463.113	can become its voice of opposition,
465.928	its last line of defense even,
468.57	perhaps someone like Anonymous,
471.987	the leading brand of global hacktivism.
475.84	This universal hacker movement
478.1	needs no introduction today,
479.706	but six years ago
481.809	they were not much more than an Internet subculture
485.238	dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats
488.157	and Internet trolling campaigns.
491.587	Their moment of transformation was in early 2008
496.429	when the Church of Scientology
498.079	attempted to remove certain leaked videos
501.146	from appearing on certain websites.
505.549	This is when Anonymous was forged
507.989	out of the seemingly random collection
510.62	of Internet dwellers.
512.363	It turns out,
514.817	the Internet doesn't like it
516.146	when you try to remove things from it,
518.769	and it will react with cyberattacks
521.739	and elaborate pranks
523.84	and with a series of organized protests
526.489	all around the world,
527.834	from my hometown of Tel Aviv
529.822	to Adelaide, Australia.
532.066	This proved that Anonymous and this idea
535.196	can rally the masses from the keyboards
538.279	to the streets,
539.855	and it laid the foundations
541.802	for dozens of future operations
544.02	against perceived injustices
545.96	to their online and offline world.
549.316	Since then, they've gone after many targets.
551.341	They've uncovered corruption, abuse.
554.13	They've hacked popes and politicians,
556.95	and I think their effect is larger
558.627	than simple denial of service attacks
561.424	that take down websites
562.8	or even leak sensitive documents.
566.438	I think that, like Robin Hood,
569.48	they are in the business of redistribution,
573.38	but what they are after isn't your money.
576.112	It's not your documents. It's your attention.
580.842	They grab the spotlight for causes they support,
585.382	forcing us to take note,
588.013	acting as a global magnifying glass
590.478	for issues that we are not as aware of
592.622	but perhaps we should be.
594.731	They have been called many names
596.584	from criminals to terrorists,
598.355	and I cannot justify their illegal means,
601.801	but the ideas they fight for
603.942	are ones that matter to us all.
607.968	The reality is,
609.951	hackers can do a lot more than break things.
612.756	They can bring people together.
615.229	And if the Internet doesn't like it
617.552	when you try to remove things from it,
620.199	just watch what happens
621.1	when you try to shut the Internet down.
623.929	This took place in Egypt in January 2011,
628.521	and as President Hosni Mubarak
631.737	attempted a desperate move
633.791	to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,
637.633	he sent his personal troops
639.503	down to Egypt's Internet service providers
643.146	and had them physically kill the switch
645.617	on the country's connection to the world overnight.
649.862	For a government to do a thing like that
651.477	was unprecedented,
653.196	and for hackers, it made it personal.
656.66	Hackers like the Telecomix group
658.748	were already active on the ground,
660.621	helping Egyptians bypass censorship
663.439	using clever workarounds like Morse code
665.929	and ham radio.
667.957	It was high season for low tech,
670.086	which the government couldn't block,
672.65	but when the Net went completely down,
675.892	Telecomix brought in the big guns.
678.83	They found European service providers
681.001	that still had 20-year-old
683.31	analog dial-up access infrastructure.
685.89	They opened up 300 of those lines
689.292	for Egyptians to use,
691.766	serving slow but sweet Internet connection
694.603	for Egyptians.
696.004	This worked.
697.299	It worked so well, in fact,
699.092	one guy even used it to download an episode
701.372	"of ""How I Met Your Mother."""
705.71	But while Egypt's future is still uncertain,
709.631	when the same thing happened in Syria
712.284	just one year later,
713.804	Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,
717.539	and Anonymous,
718.708	they were perhaps the first international group
720.954	to officially denounce the actions
722.658	of the Syrian military
724.571	by defacing their website.
727.375	But with this sort of power,
730.867	it really depends on where you stand,
733.213	because one man's hero
736.722	can be another's villain,
738.969	and so the Syrian Electronic Army
741.367	is a pro-Assad group of hackers
743.838	who support his contentious regime.
746.503	They've taken down multiple high-profile targets
749.185	in the past few years,
750.82	including the Associated Press's Twitter account,
754.203	in which they posted a message
757.219	about an attack on the White House
759.375	injuring President Obama.
762.638	This tweet was fake, of course,
764.783	but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index
767.722	that day was most certainly not,
771.099	and a lot of people lost a lot of money.
774.361	This sort of thing is happening
774.361	all over the world right now.
778.267	In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula
781.214	to Latin America,
783.576	from Europe to the United States,
785.88	hackers are a force for social,
788.937	political and military influence.
792.703	As individuals or in groups,
794.954	volunteers or military conflicts,
797.594	there are hackers everywhere.
800.235	They come from all walks of life,
802.33	ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.
807.254	They are now shaping the world's stage.
811.053	Hackers represent an exceptional force for change
813.898	in the 21st century.
816.062	This is because access to information
818.599	is a critical currency of power,
821.912	one which governments would like to control,
824.878	a thing they attempt to do by setting up
827.339	all-you-can-eat surveillance programs,
830.999	a thing they need hackers for, by the way.
833.737	And so the establishment has long had
836.384	a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,
840.091	because the same people who demonize hacking
842.849	also utilize it at large.
847.931	Two years ago,
849.179	I saw General Keith Alexander.
851.952	He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,
856.17	but instead of his four star general uniform,
859.878	he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
862.174	This was at DEF CON,
863.918	the world's largest hacker conference.
867.023	Perhaps like me, General Alexander
868.95	didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.
872.77	I think he saw untapped potential.
875.881	In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.
879.254	"""In this room right here,"" he said,"
881.894	"""is the talent our nation needs."""
884.284	Well, hackers in the back row replied,
887.664	"""Then stop arresting us."""
889.79	(Applause)
893.224	Indeed, for years,
895.803	hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,
898.619	but in light of what we know now,
901.527	who is more watchful of our online world?
905.8	The rules of the game are not that clear anymore,
908.806	but hackers are perhaps the only ones
912.218	still capable of challenging
912.218	overreaching governments
916.101	and data-hoarding corporates
918.316	on their own playing field.
920.794	To me, that represents hope.
923.914	For the past three decades,
925.238	hackers have done a lot of things,
926.789	but they have also impacted civil liberties,
930.006	innovation and Internet freedom,
932.376	so I think it's time we take a good look
935.305	at how we choose to portray them,
937.435	because if we keep expecting
937.435	them to be the bad guys,
941.019	how can they be the heroes too?
944.489	My years in the hacker world
946.5	have made me realize
948.142	both the problem and the beauty about hackers:
953.875	They just can't see something broken in the world
957.033	and leave it be.
958.68	They are compelled
960.36	to either exploit it or try and change it,
963.89	and so they find the vulnerable aspects
967.806	in our rapidly changing world.
969.94	They make us, they force us to fix things
974.282	or demand something better,
976.001	and I think we need them
977.995	to do just that,
980.201	because after all, it is not information
983.47	that wants to be free, it's us.
986.575	Thank you very much.
989.937	Thank you. (Applause)
992.295	Hack the planet!
