28	Thank you very much.
30	Now, I've got a story for you.
33	When I arrived off the plane,
36	after a very long journey from the West of England,
39	my computer, my beloved laptop,
42	had gone mad,
45	and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --
48	and the display on it --
51	anyway, the whole thing had burst.
54	And I went to the IT guys here
58	and a gentleman mended my computer,
62	"and then he said, ""What are you doing here?"""
65	"and I said ""I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"""
68	"and he said, ""Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."""
71	"And I said, ""Do you really?"""
74	Anyway, so you're in for a treat,
76	because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.
78	(Applause)
81	I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.
86	(Applause)
89	"This song is called ""Farther than the Sun."""
95	(Music)
124	♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫
128	♫ but you did not hear ... ♫
135	♫ And you're a plant that needs poor soil ♫
141	♫ and I have treated you too well ♫
144	♫ to give up flowers ... ♫
147	♫ Oh, I have been too rich for you ... ♫
159	♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫
165	♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫
171	♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫
174	♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫
178	♫ You are not worthy ♫
181	♫ You are not worthy ... ♫
186	♫ With your calculating eyes ♫
190	♫ spinning figures ♫
193	♫ you cannot see me ♫
196	♫ You cannot see me ... ♫
199	♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫
205	♫ I'll believe it ♫
208	♫ You are not worthy ♫
218	♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫
222	♫ to trap the light ♫
230	♫ And I'm in love with being in love ♫
235	♫ and you were never quite the one ♫
240	♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫
243	♫ Fragments of what you've become ♫
265	♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫
269	♫ believe electric light is bright ♫
272	♫ You are not worthy ♫
275	♫ You are not worthy ♫
280	♫ With your calculating eyes ♫
284	♫ Spinning figures ♫
287	♫ You cannot see me, no ♫
293	♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫
298	♫ I'll believe it ♫
302	♫ You are not worthy ♫
333	♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫
340	♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫
346	♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫
350	♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫
353	♫ You are not worthy ♫
356	♫ You are not worthy ♫
362	♫ With your calculating eyes ♫
365	♫ Spinning figures ♫
368	♫ You cannot see me, no ... ♫
375	♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫
460	(Applause)
463	Thank you very much.
