12.746	The first time I cried underwater
15.194	was in 2008,
16.761	the island of Curaçao,
18.362	way down in the southern Caribbean.
20.668	It's beautiful there.
22.344	I was studying these corals for my PhD,
25.294	and after days and days
25.294	of diving on the same reef,
27.7	I had gotten to know them as individuals.
29.753	I had made friends with coral colonies --
32.248	totally a normal thing to do.
35.08	Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
35.08	and ripped off their skin,
39.8	leaving little bits of wounded tissue
39.8	that would have a hard time healing,
44.313	and big patches of dead skeleton
44.313	that would get overgrown by algae.
48.201	When I saw this damage for the first time,
50.249	stretching all the way down the reef,
52.083	I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear
53.964	and I cried.
55.384	If a coral could die that fast,
57.765	how could a reef ever survive?
60.174	And why was I making it my job
60.174	to try to fight for them?
63.672	I never heard another scientist
63.672	tell that kind of story
66.728	until last year.
68.623	A scientist in Guam wrote,
70.652	"""I cried right into my mask,"""
72.223	seeing the damage on the reefs.
75.469	Then a scientist in Australia wrote,
77.434	"""I showed my students"
77.434	the results of our coral surveys,
80.455	"and we wept."""
82.716	Crying about corals
82.716	is having a moment, guys.
85.388	(Laughter)
86.546	And that's because reefs in the Pacific
88.514	are losing corals faster
88.514	than we've ever seen before.
91.689	Because of climate change,
92.985	the water is so hot for so long
92.985	in the summers,
95.818	that these animals
95.818	can't function normally.
98.494	They're spitting out the colored algae
98.494	that lives in their skin,
101.546	and the clear bleached tissue
101.546	that's left usually starves to death
106.635	and then rots away.
108.944	Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.
111.781	This is happening
111.781	over an unbelievable scale.
114.128	The Northern Great Barrier Reef
114.128	lost two-thirds of its corals last year
118.288	over a distance of hundreds of miles,
120.867	then bleached again this year,
122.693	and the bleaching stretched further south.
125.824	Reefs in the Pacific
125.824	are in a nosedive right now,
128.162	and no one knows
128.162	how bad it's going to get,
130.725	except ...
132.118	over in the Caribbean where I work,
134.081	we've already been through the nosedive.
136.519	Reefs there have suffered
136.519	through centuries of intense human abuse.
140.764	We kind of already know
140.764	how the story goes.
143.283	And we might be able to help predict
143.283	what happens next.
147.774	Let's consult a graph.
152.442	Since the invention of scuba,
153.847	scientists have measured
153.847	the amount of coral on the seafloor,
156.852	and how it's changed through time.
159.216	And after centuries
159.216	of ratcheting human pressure,
161.701	Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.
164.774	Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.
169.065	Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,
172.533	but kind of ended up in the same place.
175.55	OK, so far this is not going very well.
178.064	But some reefs in the Caribbean --
180.351	the ones best protected
182.268	and the ones a little
182.268	further from humans --
185.006	they managed to hold onto their corals.
189.227	Give us a challenge.
191.909	And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.
196.11	The second time I cried underwater
198.62	was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.
202.054	It was the calmest day of the year,
203.762	but it's always pretty
203.762	sketchy diving there.
206.155	My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.
208.275	I watched my compass
208.275	so we could find our way back out,
210.973	and he watched for sharks,
212.627	and after 20 minutes of swimming
212.627	that felt like an hour,
215.507	we finally dropped down to the reef,
217.247	and I was so shocked,
218.83	and I was so happy
220.5	that my eyes filled with tears.
223.219	There were corals 1,000 years old
223.219	lined up one after another.
228.996	They had survived the entire history
228.996	of European colonialism in the Caribbean,
233.706	and for centuries before that.
237.465	I never knew what a coral could do
237.465	when it was given a chance to thrive.
242.66	The truth is that even
242.66	as we lose so many corals,
246.067	even as we go through
246.067	this massive coral die-off,
249.147	some reefs will survive.
251.732	Some will be ragged on the edge,
253.41	some will be beautiful.
255.911	And by protecting shorelines
255.911	and giving us food to eat
258.626	and supporting tourism,
260.399	they will still be worth
260.399	billions and billions of dollars a year.
264.043	The best time to protect a reef
264.043	was 50 years ago,
266.658	but the second-best time is right now.
271.115	Even as we go through bleaching events,
273.09	more frequent and in more places,
275.657	some corals will be able to recover.
278.792	We had a bleaching event
278.792	in 2010 in the Caribbean
281.668	that took off big patches of skin
281.668	on boulder corals like these.
286.172	This coral lost half of its skin.
288.809	But if you look at the side
288.809	of this coral a few years later,
293.06	this coral is actually healthy again.
295.432	It's doing what a healthy coral does.
297.753	It's making copies of its polyps,
299.875	it's fighting back the algae
301.354	and it's reclaiming its territory.
304.195	If a few polyps survive,
305.384	a coral can regrow;
306.581	it just needs time and protection
306.581	and a reasonable temperature.
311.188	Some corals can regrow in 10 years --
313.021	others take a lot longer.
314.768	But the more stresses
314.768	we take off them locally --
317.443	things like overfishing,
317.443	sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,
321.461	dredging, coastal construction --
323.93	the better they can hang on
323.93	as we stabilize the climate,
326.824	and the faster they can regrow.
329.766	And as we go through the long,
329.766	tough and necessary process
333.528	of stabilizing the climate
333.528	of planet Earth,
336.157	some new corals will still be born.
339.143	This is what I study in my research.
341.498	We try to understand
341.498	how corals make babies,
344.069	and how those babies
344.069	find their way to the reef,
346.767	and we invent new methods
346.767	to help them survive
349.093	those early, fragile life stages.
351.904	One of my favorite
351.904	coral babies of all time
354.929	showed up right after Hurricane Omar.
356.963	It's the same species
356.963	I was studying before the storm,
359.678	but you almost never see
359.678	babies of this species --
362.134	it's really rare.
363.373	This is actually an endangered species.
366.219	In this photo, this little baby coral,
366.219	this little circle of polyps,
369.739	is a few years old.
371.616	Like its cousins that bleach,
373.109	it's fighting back the algae.
374.969	And like its cousins on the north shore,
376.918	it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.
381.018	What's happening in the world
381.018	and in the ocean
383.892	has changed our time horizon.
386.457	We can be incredibly pessimistic
386.457	on the short term,
389.52	and mourn what we lost
390.859	and what we really took for granted.
394.028	But we can still be optimistic
394.028	on the long term,
396.802	and we can still be ambitious
396.802	about what we fight for
399.304	and what we expect from our governments,
402.426	from our planet.
404.364	Corals have been living on planet Earth
404.364	for hundreds of millions of years.
408.118	They survived the extinction
408.118	of the dinosaurs.
410.335	They're badasses.
412.189	(Laughter)
413.69	An individual coral can go through
413.69	tremendous trauma and fully recover
418.253	if it's given a chance
418.253	and it's given protection.
422.042	Corals have always
422.042	been playing the long game,
425.539	and now so are we.
427.612	Thanks very much.
428.789	(Applause)
