12.039	Over the last two decades, India has become
15.013	a global hub for software development
18.052	and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,
22.079	and what we were interested in finding out was that
27.099	because of this huge industry that has started
31.039	over the last two decades in India,
33.05	offshoring software development and back office services,
36.041	there's been a flight of white collar jobs
38.064	from the developed world to India.
42.015	When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs
45.071	to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst
49.001	amongst the Western populations.
52.089	In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining
55.051	trend for support for free trade in the West.
60.087	Now, the Western elites, however, have said
63.086	this fear is misplaced.
65.086	For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you
68.008	have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman
71.04	"called ""The World Is Flat,"" he said, basically, in his book"
74.074	that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong
78.093	because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption
81.067	that everything that can be invented has been invented.
85.051	In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West
88.037	ahead of the developing world,
90.01	with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done
93.052	in the developed world, and the less sophisticated,
96.025	shall we say, drudge work being done
97.083	in the developing world.
100.099	Now, what we were trying to understand was,
104.031	is this true?
107.007	Could India become a source, or a global hub,
110.086	of innovation, just like it's become a global hub
114.003	for back office services and software development?
117.09	And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam
121.072	and I spent investigating this topic.
125.002	Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,
129.002	in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting
131.043	the Western innovative model, say,
133.069	"""Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,"
136.027	"if the Indians are so bloody smart?"" (Laughter)"
140.053	So initially, when we started our research, we went
142.088	and met several executives, and we asked them,
144.098	"""What do you think? Will India go from being a favored"
147.027	destination for software services and back office services
150.027	"to a destination for innovation?"""
153.037	They laughed. They dismissed us.
155.023	"They said, ""You know what? Indians don't do innovation."""
158.03	"The more polite ones said, ""Well, you know, Indians"
160.06	make good software programmers and accountants,
163.067	"but they can't do the creative stuff."""
166.017	Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,
170.083	"and people said, ""You know, it's nothing to do with Indians."
173.033	It's really the rule-based, regimented education system
176.094	"in India that is responsible for killing all creativity."""
181.032	They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,
183.086	go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies
185.085	like Google, Microsoft, Intel.
188.051	So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labs
191.005	of Silicon Valley.
193.057	Well, interestingly, what you find there is,
195.071	usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab
198.064	or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it,
200.061	and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)
204.024	"So I immediately said, ""Well, but you could not have been"
207.027	educated in India, right?
208.062	"You must have gotten your education here."""
210.018	It turned out, in every single case,
214.004	they came out of the Indian educational system.
218.026	So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,
220.075	and the right question is, really, can Indians
223.062	based out of India do innovative work?
227.042	So off we went to India. We made, I think,
229.07	about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,
232.092	Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine
235.011	what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.
240.036	And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,
242.094	was, that we were asking really the wrong question.
245.09	"When you ask, ""Where are the Indian Googles,"
247.065	"iPods and Viagras?"" you are taking a particular perspective"
251.099	on innovation, which is innovation for end users,
256.015	visible innovation.
257.078	Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you
261.047	may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,
263.048	"he said, ""Innovation is novelty"
265.055	"in how value is created and distributed."""
269.031	It could be new products and services,
271.044	but it could also be new ways of producing products.
273.077	It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
276.091	Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,
280.077	the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
284.077	When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,
287.038	what we found was, India is well represented
290.072	in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India
294.006	is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was
297.026	"we called it ""invisible innovation."""
299.091	And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation
302.078	that are coming out of India.
304.098	The first type of invisible innovation out of India
307.068	is what we call innovation for business customers,
310.057	which is led by the multinational corporations,
313.042	which have -- in the last two decades, there have been
322.064	employing more than 400,000 professionals.
326.086	Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,
331.012	the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company
334.029	was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin
338.098	of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers
342.088	of multinational corporations in India
345.025	is truly a remarkable figure.
347.082	When we went and talked to the people in those innovation
350.005	centers and asked them what are they working on,
352.066	"they said, ""We are working on global products."""
354.076	They were not working on localizing global products
357.039	for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D.
361.011	They were working on truly global products,
363.061	and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,
367.037	General Electric, Philips, have already answered
370.024	in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore
373.072	and Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produce
377.067	products and services for the world.
380.069	But of course, as an end user, you don't see that,
383.036	because you only see the name of the company,
384.087	not where it was developed.
388.064	"The other thing we were told then was, ""Yes, but, you know,"
391.048	the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center
393.072	cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out
395.075	"of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers."""
398.01	So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be
399.071	one of the smartest people I know, said
402.008	he's going to do a study.
403.053	What he did was he looked at those companies
406.019	that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India,
409.09	and then he looked at a patent that was filed
412.047	out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same
415.018	company's subsidiary in India,
417.068	so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers
420.076	in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company
424.077	to find out what is the quality of the patents filed
427.007	out of the Indian centers and how do they compare
428.094	with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?
431.073	Interestingly, what he finds is
433.094	— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent
436.065	is what we call forward citations: How many times
439.055	does a future patent reference the older patent? —
443.072	he finds something very interesting.
446.023	What we find is that the data says
448.091	that the number of forward citations of a patent filed
452.01	out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number
455.051	of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary
459.023	of the same company within that company.
461.044	So within the company, there's no difference in the forward
464.035	citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus
466.086	their U.S. subsidiaries.
467.096	So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.
471.078	The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
474.033	is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,
478.003	where many companies today are contracting
481.005	Indian companies to do a major part of their product
484.097	development work for their global products
489.038	which are going to be sold to the entire world.
491.069	For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules
493.091	are being developed, but you see a major part of that work
496.051	is being sent to India.
499.006	For example, XCL Technologies,
502.007	they developed two of the mission critical systems
504.099	for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,
508.019	one to avoid collisions in the sky,
510.091	and another to allow landing in zero visibility.
514.015	But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,
516.078	you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation
519.016	out of India.
520.043	The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India
523.044	is what we call process innovations, because of an injection
526.043	of intelligence by Indian firms.
529.016	Process innovation is different from product innovation.
533.042	It's about how do you create a new product or develop
536.063	a new product or manufacture a new product,
538.063	but not a new product itself?
540.067	Only in India do millions of young people dream
545.077	of working in a call center.
549.096	What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West,
552.098	what high school dropouts do.
555.031	What happens when you put hundreds of thousands
558.043	of smart, young, ambitious kids
561.059	on a call center job?
563.089	Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,
568.079	and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and
572.009	out of this process innovation comes product innovations,
575.03	which are then marketed around the world.
577.003	For example, 24/7 Customer,
579.042	traditional call center company, used to be a traditional
581.071	call center company. Today they're developing
583.055	analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before
587	you pick up the phone, you can guess
590.005	or predict what this phone call is about.
596.078	It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process
599.028	which was considered dead for a long time in the West.
602.01	And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation
605.041	coming out of India is what we call management innovation.
608.002	It's not a new product or a new process
609.075	but a new way to organize work,
612.01	and the most significant management innovation to come
614.059	out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry
618.015	is what we call the global delivery model.
620.08	What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you
623.009	to take previously geographically core-located tasks,
626.059	break them up into parts, send them around the world
629.06	where the expertise and the cost structure exists,
631.061	and then specify the means for reintegrating them.
634.044	Without that, you could not have any of the other
636.057	invisible innovations today.
638.085	So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding
641.049	in our research is, that if products for end users
646.012	is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,
649.041	India is well represented in the invisible, large,
653.033	submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.
658.057	Now, this has, of course, some implications,
663.053	and so we developed three implications of this research.
667.077	The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,
671.001	and now I'm going to go back to where I started my
673.073	conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.
676.095	Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,
680.008	decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D,
682.09	what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the
686.034	bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,
689.042	just like Tom Friedman would predict.
692.063	Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung
695.035	of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work,
700.017	at some stage in the very near future you are going to have
703.04	to confront a problem,
705.054	which is where does the next step
707.043	of the ladder people come from within your company?
710.069	So you have two choices then:
713.059	Either you bring the people from India into
715.077	the developed world to take positions in the next step
718.068	of the ladder — immigration —
721.042	or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step
723.086	of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,
726.05	why don't we move the next step to India?
730.073	What we are trying to say is
732.068	that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --
737.091	it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,
740.061	and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that
743.034	you can't be an investment banker
745.049	without having been an analyst once.
747.048	You can't be a professor without having been a student.
749.075	You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.
752.061	So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,
755.02	at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.
759.047	The second thing we bring up is what we call
761.032	the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.
764.068	If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of India
767.032	and China, and the largest growth markets
769.056	are going to be based out of India and China,
771.08	you have to confront the problem that
773.053	your top management of the future
775.015	is going to have to come out of India and China,
778.016	because that's where the product leadership is,
779.099	that's where the important market leadership is.
782.015	Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,
784.093	which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.
788.036	India has the youngest growing population in the world.
792.042	This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,
796.072	there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.
799.011	Indian institutes and educational system,
802.004	with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students
804.097	in the quantity and quality needed
807.047	to keep this innovation engine going,
810.001	so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,
813.022	but in the end it does not absolve the government
815.082	of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.
820.029	So finally, I want to conclude
823.062	by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.
826.094	As many of you know, IBM has always been considered
829.031	for the last hundred years to be one of the most
831.029	innovative companies.
832.056	In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,
835.031	I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies
837.071	in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.
841.041	Here is the profile of employees of
843.091	IBM over the last decade.
847.084	In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,
850.059	or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000
854.068	were in America, 9,000 were in India.
858.027	In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time
863.03	the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,
865.087	whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.
869.014	Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal
872.016	this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates
874.048	based on various sources.
875.088	Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying
878.052	this is the exact number, it's my best guess.
879.098	It gives you a sense of the trend.
881.06	There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which
888.083	and 150,000 are in India.
892.039	So you tell me, is IBM an American company,
895.051	or an Indian company? (Laughter)
899.057	Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)
