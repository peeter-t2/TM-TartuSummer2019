15.704	We are losing our listening.
18.759	We spend roughly 60 percent
18.759	of our communication time listening,
22.704	but we're not very good at it.
24.26	We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
26.791	Now -- not you, not this talk,
28.317	but that is generally true.
29.866	(Laughter)
31.285	Let's define listening
31.285	as making meaning from sound.
34.892	It's a mental process,
36.495	and it's a process of extraction.
39.145	We use some pretty cool
39.145	techniques to do this.
41.33	One of them is pattern recognition.
43.093	(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail
43.093	party like this,
45.469	"if I say, ""David, Sara, pay attention"" --"
45.469	some of you just sat up.
49.778	We recognize patterns
49.778	to distinguish noise from signal,
53.471	and especially our name.
55.511	Differencing is another technique we use.
57.574	If I left this pink noise on
57.574	for more than a couple of minutes,
60.754	(Pink noise) you would literally
60.754	cease to hear it.
63.352	We listen to differences;
63.352	we discount sounds that remain the same.
68.312	And then there is a whole
68.312	range of filters.
71.125	These filters take us from all sound
73.601	down to what we pay attention to.
75.696	Most people are entirely
75.696	unconscious of these filters.
79.779	But they actually create
79.779	our reality in a way,
82.353	because they tell us what
82.353	we're paying attention to right now.
85.384	I'll give you one example of that.
87.174	Intention is very important
87.174	in sound, in listening.
90.494	When I married my wife,
92.26	I promised her I would listen
92.26	to her every day
94.944	as if for the first time.
97.23	Now that's something
97.23	I fall short of on a daily basis.
100.51	(Laughter)
101.547	But it's a great intention
101.547	to have in a relationship.
104.169	(Laughter)
105.878	But that's not all.
107.053	Sound places us in space and in time.
110.029	If you close your eyes
110.029	right now in this room,
112.982	you're aware of the size of the room
115.013	from the reverberation and the bouncing
115.013	of the sound off the surfaces;
118.855	you're aware of how many
118.855	people are around you,
121.146	because of the micro-noises
121.146	you're receiving.
123.765	And sound places us in time as well,
126.372	because sound always has
126.372	time embedded in it.
129.856	In fact, I would suggest
129.856	that our listening is the main way
132.802	that we experience the flow of time
134.972	from past to future.
137.069	"So, ""Sonority is time"
137.069	"and meaning"" -- a great quote."
140.019	I said at the beginning,
140.019	we're losing our listening.
142.484	Why did I say that?
143.918	Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.
145.976	First of all, we invented
145.976	ways of recording --
148.205	first writing, then audio recording
148.205	and now video recording as well.
151.971	The premium on accurate and careful
151.971	listening has simply disappeared.
156.675	Secondly, the world is now so noisy,
159.26	(Noise) with this cacophony
159.26	going on visually and auditorily,
164.26	it's just hard to listen;
166.26	it's tiring to listen.
168.426	Many people take refuge in headphones,
170.899	but they turn big,
170.899	public spaces like this,
173.976	shared soundscapes,
175.396	into millions of tiny,
175.396	little personal sound bubbles.
179.83	In this scenario,
179.83	nobody's listening to anybody.
183.147	We're becoming impatient.
185.218	We don't want oratory anymore;
185.218	we want sound bites.
188.26	And the art of conversation is being
188.26	replaced -- dangerously, I think --
192.729	by personal broadcasting.
194.74	I don't know how much listening
194.74	there is in this conversation,
198.231	which is sadly very common,
198.231	especially in the UK.
201.715	We're becoming desensitized.
203.41	Our media have to scream at us
203.41	with these kinds of headlines
206.889	in order to get our attention.
208.881	And that means it's harder
208.881	for us to pay attention
211.336	to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.
215.587	This is a serious problem
215.587	that we're losing our listening.
218.532	This is not trivial,
220.523	because listening is our access
220.523	to understanding.
224.226	Conscious listening
224.226	always creates understanding,
227.711	and only without conscious listening
230.365	can these things happen.
232.26	A world where we don't listen
232.26	to each other at all
235.246	is a very scary place indeed.
239.014	So I'd like to share with you
239.014	five simple exercises,
242.36	tools you can take away with you,
244.074	to improve your own conscious listening.
246.29	Would you like that?
247.47	Audience: Yes!
248.66	Good. The first one is silence.
251.612	Just three minutes a day of silence
251.612	is a wonderful exercise
255.26	to reset your ears and to recalibrate,
257.996	so that you can hear the quiet again.
260.123	If you can't get absolute silence,
261.822	go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.
264.823	"Second, I call this ""the mixer."""
267.52	(Noise) So even if you're
267.52	in a noisy environment like this --
271.033	and we all spend a lot of time
271.033	in places like this --
273.782	listen in the coffee bar
273.782	to how many channels of sound can I hear?
277.878	How many individual channels
277.878	in that mix am I listening to?
280.86	You can do it in a beautiful place
280.86	as well, like in a lake.
284.098	How many birds am I hearing?
285.609	Where are they? Where are those ripples?
287.839	It's a great exercise for improving
287.839	the quality of your listening.
292.456	"Third, this exercise I call ""savoring,"""
292.456	and this is a beautiful exercise.
296.26	It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
298.26	This, for example, is my tumble dryer.
301.513	(Dryer)
302.635	It's a waltz -- one, two, three;
302.635	one, two, three; one, two, three.
307.141	I love it!
308.387	Or just try this one on for size.
310.583	(Coffee grinder)
319.713	Wow!
321.26	So, mundane sounds
321.26	can be really interesting --
323.663	if you pay attention.
324.88	"I call that the ""hidden choir"" --"
324.88	it's around us all the time.
328.394	The next exercise is probably
328.394	the most important of all of these,
332.241	if you just take one thing away.
333.936	This is listening positions --
335.581	the idea that you can move
335.581	your listening position
339.06	to what's appropriate
339.06	to what you're listening to.
341.899	This is playing with those filters.
343.669	Remember I gave you those filters?
345.347	It's starting to play with them as levers,
347.398	to get conscious about them
347.398	and to move to different places.
350.299	These are just some
350.299	of the listening positions,
352.562	or scales of listening
352.562	positions, that you can use.
354.993	There are many.
356.183	Have fun with that. It's very exciting.
358.685	And finally, an acronym.
360.811	You can use this in listening,
360.811	in communication.
363.73	If you're in any one of those roles --
365.97	and I think that probably is everybody
365.97	who's listening to this talk --
369.765	the acronym is RASA,
371.472	which is the Sanskrit word
371.472	"for ""juice"" or ""essence."""
375.503	"And RASA stands for ""Receive,"""
375.503	which means pay attention to the person;
380.336	"""Appreciate,"" making little noises"
380.336	"like ""hmm,"" ""oh,"" ""OK"";"
383.762	"""Summarize"" -- the word ""so"""
383.762	is very important in communication;
387.173	"and ""Ask,"" ask questions afterwards."
390.26	Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
392.576	I wrote a whole book about it.
392.576	So I live to listen.
395.134	That's too much to ask for most people.
398.014	But I believe that every human being
398.014	needs to listen consciously
401.985	in order to live fully --
404.115	connected in space and in time
404.115	to the physical world around us,
407.829	connected in understanding to each other,
410.379	not to mention spiritually connected,
412.225	because every spiritual path
412.225	I know of has listening and contemplation
416.061	at its heart.
417.91	That's why we need to teach listening
417.91	in our schools as a skill.
423.777	Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
426.174	And if we can teach listening
426.174	in our schools,
428.657	we can take our listening
428.657	off that slippery slope
431.419	to that dangerous, scary world
431.419	that I talked about,
433.989	and move it to a place where everybody
433.989	is consciously listening all the time,
437.741	or at least capable of doing it.
439.545	Now, I don't know how to do that,
441.45	but this is TED,
443.447	and I think the TED community
443.447	is capable of anything.
446.541	So I invite you to connect with me,
446.541	connect with each other,
449.825	take this mission out.
451.054	And let's get listening taught in schools,
453.131	and transform the world in one generation
455.153	to a conscious, listening world --
455.153	a world of connection,
457.899	a world of understanding
459.26	and a world of peace.
460.91	Thank you for listening to me today.
462.689	(Applause)
