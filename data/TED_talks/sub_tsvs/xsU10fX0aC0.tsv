12.55	For the past few years,
14.04	I've been spending my summers
14.04	in the marine biological laboratory
18.393	in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
20.931	And there, what I've been doing
20.931	is essentially renting a boat.
25.117	What I would like to do is ask you
27.741	to come on a boat ride with me tonight.
31.836	So, we ride off from Eel Pond
31.836	into Vineyard Sound,
36.753	right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,
39.288	equipped with a drone
39.288	to identify potential spots
42.649	from which to peer into the Atlantic.
45.15	Earlier, I was going to say
45.15	into the depths of the Atlantic,
48.453	but we don't have to go too deep
48.453	to reach the unknown.
52.311	Here, barely two miles away
54.906	from what is arguably the greatest
54.906	marine biology lab in the world,
59.476	we lower a simple
59.476	plankton net into the water
62.721	and bring up to the surface
64.566	things that humanity rarely
64.566	pays any attention to,
67.99	and oftentimes has never seen before.
71.26	Here's one of the organisms
71.26	that we caught in our net.
74.228	This is a jellyfish.
75.881	But look closely,
77.217	and living inside of this animal
77.217	is another organism
80.232	that is very likely
80.232	entirely new to science.
82.961	A complete new species.
85.117	Or how about this other transparent beauty
87.844	with a beating heart,
89.408	asexually growing on top of its head,
92.86	progeny that will move on
92.86	to reproduce sexually.
96.547	Let me say that again:
98.058	this animal is growing asexually
98.058	on top of its head,
101.768	progeny that is going to reproduce
101.768	sexually in the next generation.
106.96	A weird jellyfish?
108.796	Not quite.
110.13	This is an ascidian.
111.772	This is a group of animals
113.08	that now we know we share
113.08	extensive genomic ancestry with,
116.851	and it is perhaps the closest
116.851	invertebrate species to our own.
122.376	Meet your cousin,
123.769	Thalia democratica.
125.223	(Laughter)
127.205	I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot
127.205	at your last family reunion
131.219	for Thalia,
132.675	but let me tell you,
134.351	these animals are profoundly related to us
137.703	in ways that we're just
137.703	beginning to understand.
142.164	So, next time you hear anybody
142.164	derisively telling you
146.313	that this type of research
146.313	is a simple fishing expedition,
150.234	I hope that you'll remember
150.234	the trip that we just took.
153.675	Today, many of the biological
153.675	sciences only see value
157.539	in studying deeper what we already know --
160.112	in mapping already-discovered continents.
163.099	But some of us are much more
163.099	interested in the unknown.
166.849	We want to discover
166.849	completely new continents,
170.817	and gaze at magnificent
170.817	vistas of ignorance.
174.674	We crave the experience
174.674	of being completely baffled
178.794	by something we've never seen before.
180.992	And yes, I agree
182.286	there's a lot of little ego satisfaction
182.286	in being able to say,
186.11	"""Hey, I was the first one"
186.11	"to discover that."""
189.102	But this is not
189.102	a self-aggrandizing enterprise,
192.031	because in this type
192.031	of discovery research,
194.755	if you don't feel like a complete
194.755	idiot most of the time,
198.397	you're just not sciencing hard enough.
200.702	(Laughter)
204.014	So every summer I bring onto the deck
204.014	of this little boat of ours
210.021	more and more things
210.021	that we know very little about.
214.816	I would like tonight
214.816	to tell you a story about life
218.328	that rarely gets told
218.328	in an environment like this.
222.915	From the vantage point of our 21st-century
222.915	biological laboratories,
228.274	we have begun to illuminate
228.274	many mysteries of life with knowledge.
232.869	We sense that after centuries
232.869	of scientific research,
236.53	we're beginning to make
236.53	significant inroads
238.661	into understanding some of the most
238.661	fundamental principles of life.
243.223	Our collective optimism is reflected
243.223	by the growth of biotechnology
248.248	across the globe,
250.326	striving to utilize scientific knowledge
250.326	to cure human diseases.
255.685	Things like cancer, aging,
255.685	degenerative diseases;
260.547	these are but some
260.547	of the undesirables we wish to tame.
265.817	I often wonder:
267.285	Why is it that we are having
267.285	so much trouble
270.47	trying to solve the problem of cancer?
273.096	Is it that we're trying to solve
273.096	the problem of cancer,
276.374	and not trying to understand life?
279.657	Life on this planet
279.657	shares a common origin,
282.869	and I can summarize 3.5 billion years
282.869	of the history of life on this planet
287.946	in a single slide.
289.45	What you see here are representatives
289.45	of all known species in our planet.
293.321	In this immensity of life
293.321	and biodiversity,
296.756	we occupy a rather unremarkable position.
299.947	(Laughter)
300.987	Homo sapiens.
303.016	The last of our kind.
305.57	And though I don't really want
305.57	to disparage at all
308.705	the accomplishments of our species,
310.7	as much as we wish it to be so
310.7	and often pretend that it is,
315.71	we are not the measure of all things.
319.311	We are, however, the measurers
319.311	of many things.
323.311	We relentlessly quantify,
323.311	analyze and compare,
327.081	and some of this is absolutely invaluable
327.081	and indeed necessary.
331.661	But this emphasis today on forcing
331.661	biological research to specialize
338.072	and to produce practical outcomes
340.644	is actually restricting our ability
340.644	to interrogate life
344.222	to unacceptably narrow confines
344.222	and unsatisfying depths.
349.007	We are measuring an astonishingly
349.007	narrow sliver of life,
354.072	and hoping that those numbers
354.072	will save all of our lives.
358.425	How narrow do you ask?
359.842	Well, let me give you a number.
361.47	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
361.47	Administration recently estimated
366.013	that about 95 percent of our oceans
366.013	remain unexplored.
370.674	Now let that sink in for a second.
	remain unexplored.
377.712	I think it's very safe to say
379.901	that we don't even know
379.901	how much about life we do not know.
385.81	So, it's not surprising
385.81	that every week in my field
388.759	we begin to see the addition
388.759	of more and more new species
391.994	to this amazing tree of life.
394.277	This one for example --
395.698	discovered earlier this summer,
397.628	new to science,
398.865	and now occupying its lonely branch
398.865	in our family tree.
402.973	What is even more tragic
404.148	is that we know about a bunch
404.148	of other species of animals out there,
407.807	but their biology remains
407.807	sorely under-studied.
411.392	I'm sure some of you
411.392	have heard about the fact
413.75	that a starfish can actually
413.75	regenerate its arm after it's lost.
417.97	But some of you might not know
419.436	that the arm itself can actually
419.436	regenerate a complete starfish.
424.759	And there are animals out there
424.759	that do truly astounding things.
429.461	I'm almost willing to bet
431.195	that many of you have never heard
431.195	of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.
436.423	This little guy right here
438.546	does things that essentially
438.546	just blow my mind.
442.131	You can grab one of these animals
442.131	and cut it into 18 different fragments,
446.159	and each and every one of those fragments
446.159	will go on to regenerate
449.945	a complete animal
451.287	in under two weeks.
458.348	For the past decade and a half or so,
460.768	I've been trying to figure out
460.768	how these little dudes do what they do,
464.502	and how they pull this magic trick off.
466.725	But like all good magicians,
468.463	they're not really releasing
468.463	their secrets readily to me.
471.342	(Laughter)
472.572	So here we are,
473.754	after 20 years of essentially
473.754	studying these animals,
478.233	genome mapping, chin scratching,
480.564	and thousands of amputations
480.564	and thousands of regenerations,
483.807	we still don't fully understand
483.807	how these animals do what they do.
488.028	Each planarian an ocean unto itself,
491.648	full of unknowns.
494.476	One of the common characteristics
496.184	of all of these animals
496.184	I've been talking to you about
498.82	is that they did not appear
498.82	to have received the memo
501.607	that they need to behave
501.607	according to the rules
504.298	that we have derived from a handful
504.298	of randomly selected animals
508.491	that currently populate the vast majority
511.237	of biomedical laboratories
511.237	across the world.
514.117	Meet our Nobel Prize winners.
516.371	Seven species, essentially,
518.397	that have produced for us the brunt
518.397	of our understanding
522.023	of biological behavior today.
525.172	This little guy right here --
526.988	three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.
530.204	And yet, after all the attention
530.204	they have garnered,
532.984	and all the knowledge they have generated,
535.068	as well as the lion's share
535.068	of the funding,
537.117	here we are standing [before] the same
537.117	litany of intractable problems
541.014	and many new challenges.
543.22	And that's because, unfortunately,
545.059	these seven animals essentially correspond
547.697	to 0.0009 percent of all of the species
547.697	that inhabit the planet.
555.962	So I'm beginning to suspect
558.372	that our specialization is beginning
558.372	to impede our progress at best,
563.157	and at worst, is leading us astray.
566.235	That's because life
566.235	on this planet and its history
569.333	is the history of rule breakers.
571.433	Life started on the face of this planet
571.433	as single-cell organisms,
574.804	swimming for millions
574.804	of years in the ocean,
577.15	until one of those creatures decided,
579.46	"""I'm going to do things differently today;"
581.543	today I would like to invent
581.543	something called multicellularity,
584.575	"and I'm going to do this."""
585.872	And I'm sure it wasn't a popular
585.872	decision at the time --
588.548	(Laughter)
589.599	but somehow, it managed to do it.
591.229	And then, multicellular
591.229	organisms began to populate
593.819	all these ancestral oceans,
595.219	and they thrived.
596.431	And we have them here today.
598.789	Land masses began to emerge
598.789	from the surface of the oceans,
601.81	and another creature thought,
603.288	"""Hey, that looks like a really nice"
603.288	piece of real estate.
606.101	"I'd like to move there."""
607.376	"""Are you crazy?"
608.559	You're going to desiccate out there.
608.559	"Nothing can live out of water."""
611.867	But life found a way,
613.048	and there are organisms
613.048	now that live on land.
615.395	Once on land, they may have
615.395	looked up into the sky
617.817	"and said, ""It would be nice"
617.817	to go to the clouds,
620.1	"I'm going to fly."""
621.275	"""You can't break the law of gravity,"
621.275	"there's no way you can fly."""
624.374	And yet, nature has invented --
626.683	multiple and independent times --
628.714	ways to fly.
630.368	I love to study these animals
630.368	that break the rules,
632.909	because every time they break a rule,
632.909	they invent something new
636.562	that made it possible for us
636.562	to be able to be here today.
640.624	These animals did not get the memo.
642.918	They break the rules.
644.642	So if we're going to study animals
644.642	that break the rules,
647.461	shouldn't how we study them
647.461	also break the rules?
651.666	I think we need to renew
651.666	our spirit of exploration.
655.44	Rather than bring nature
655.44	into our laboratories
657.948	and interrogate it there,
659.287	we need to bring our science
661.017	into the majestic laboratory
661.017	that is nature,
663.946	and there, with our modern
663.946	technological armamentarium,
667.881	interrogate every new form
667.881	of life we find,
670.731	and any new biological attribute
670.731	that we may find.
674.486	We actually need to bring
674.486	all of our intelligence
678.664	to becoming stupid again --
680.78	clueless [before] the immensity
680.78	of the unknown.
685.116	Because after all,
686.501	science is not really about knowledge.
688.684	Science is about ignorance.
691.449	That's what we do.
692.838	Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,
695.993	"""If you want to build a ship,"
697.818	don't drum up people to collect wood
699.786	and don't assign them tasks and work,
702.112	but rather teach them to long
702.112	"for the endless immensity of the sea ..."""
706.646	As a scientist and a teacher,
708.374	I like to paraphrase this to read
710.359	that we scientists need
710.359	to teach our students
713.541	to long for the endless
713.541	immensity of the sea
716.016	that is our ignorance.
718.768	We Homo sapiens are the only
718.768	species we know of
722.657	that is driven to scientific inquiry.
725.645	We, like all other species on this planet,
727.803	are inextricably woven
727.803	into the history of life on this planet.
732.989	And I think I'm a little wrong
732.989	when I say that life is a mystery,
736.18	because I think that life
736.18	is actually an open secret
738.915	that has been beckoning our species
738.915	for millennia to understand it.
743.344	So I ask you:
744.969	Aren't we the best chance
744.969	that life has to know itself?
749.053	And if so,
750.228	what the heck are we waiting for?
752.368	Thank you.
753.593	(Applause)
