12.648	As an Arab female photographer,
14.785	I have always found ample inspiration
14.785	for my projects in personal experiences.
19.917	The passion I developed for knowledge,
21.849	which allowed me to break barriers
21.849	towards a better life
25.25	was the motivation 
25.25	for my project I Read I Write.
29.599	Pushed by my own experience,
31.331	as I was not allowed initially
31.331	to pursue my higher education,
35.306	I decided to explore and document
35.306	stories of other women
39.483	who changed their lives through education,
42.316	while exposing and questioning
42.316	the barriers they face.
46.147	I covered a range of topics
46.147	that concern women's education,
49.833	keeping in mind the differences
49.833	among Arab countries
52.451	due to economic and social factors.
55.569	These issues include female illiteracy,
55.569	which is quite high in the region;
59.734	educational reforms;
59.734	programs for dropout students;
64.141	and political activism
64.141	among university students.
68.11	As I started this work,
69.512	it was not always easy 
69.512	to convince the women to participate.
73.072	Only after explaining to them
74.987	how their stories
74.987	might influence other women's lives,
77.841	how they would become role models
77.841	for their own community, did some agree.
82.647	Seeking a collaborative
82.647	and reflexive approach,
85.828	I asked them to write
85.828	their own words and ideas
89.032	on prints of their own images.
91.261	Those images were then shared
91.261	in some of the classrooms,
94.071	and worked to inspire
94.071	and motivate other women
97.321	going through similar educations 
97.321	and situations.
102.273	Aisha, a teacher from Yemen, wrote,
105.1	"""I sought education in order"
105.1	to be independent
108.234	"and to not count on men with everything."""
111.663	One of my first subjects
111.663	was Umm El-Saad from Egypt.
115.358	When we first met, she was
115.358	barely able to write her name.
118.799	She was attending
118.799	a nine-month literacy program
121.051	run by a local NGO in the Cairo suburbs.
124	Months later, she was joking
124	that her husband
126.229	had threatened to pull her
126.229	out of the classes,
128.76	as he found out that his now literate wife
130.989	was going through his phone text messages.
133.777	(Laughter)
135.237	Naughty Umm El-Saad.
136.985	Of course, that's not why
136.985	Umm El-Saad joined the program.
141.139	I saw how she was longing to gain
141.139	control over her simple daily routines,
145.855	small details that we take for granted,
147.764	from counting money at the market
147.764	to helping her kids in homework.
151.962	Despite her poverty
151.962	and her community's mindset,
154.957	which belittles women's education,
157.042	Umm El-Saad, along with
157.042	her Egyptian classmates,
159.768	was eager to learn how to read and write.
164.175	In Tunisia, I met Asma,
166.729	one of the four activist women
166.729	I interviewed.
169.771	The secular bioengineering student
169.771	is quite active on social media.
174.235	Regarding her country, which treasured
174.235	what has been called the Arab Spring,
179.917	"she said, ""I've always dreamt"
179.917	of discovering a new bacteria.
182.843	Now, after the revolution,
182.843	"we have a new one every single day."""
186.603	Asma was referring to the rise
186.603	of religious fundamentalism in the region,
191.179	which is another obstacle
191.179	to women in particular.
195.363	Out of all the women I met,
195.363	Fayza from Yemen affected me the most.
200.229	Fayza was forced to drop out of school
200.229	at the age of eight when she was married.
205.114	That marriage lasted for a year.
208.361	At 14, she became the third wife
208.361	of a 60-year-old man,
212.229	and by the time she was 18,
212.229	she was a divorced mother of three.
216.919	Despite her poverty,
219.39	despite her social status as a divorc√©e
219.39	in an ultra-conservative society,
224.66	and despite the opposition of her parents
224.66	to her going back to school,
228.538	Fayza knew that her only way
228.538	to control her life was through education.
233.71	She is now 26.
235.48	She received a grant from a local NGO
237.64	to fund her business studies
237.64	at the university.
240.519	Her goal is to find a job,
240.519	rent a place to live in,
243.979	and bring her kids back with her.
247.158	The Arab states are going through
247.158	tremendous change,
251.455	and the struggles women face
251.455	are overwhelming.
254.216	Just like the women I photographed,
256.458	I had to overcome many barriers
256.458	to becoming the photographer I am today,
260.89	many people along the way
260.89	telling me what I can and cannot do.
265.387	Umm El-Saad, Asma and Fayza,
265.387	and many women across the Arab world,
270.693	show that it is possible
270.693	to overcome barriers to education,
274.651	which they know is the best means
274.651	to a better future.
278.83	And here I would like to end
278.83	with a quote by Yasmine,
282.197	one of the four activist women
282.197	I interviewed in Tunisia.
285.463	Yasmine wrote,
287.034	"""Question your convictions."
289.414	Be who you to want to be,
289.414	not who they want you to be.
293.156	Don't accept their enslavement,
293.156	"for your mother birthed you free."""
296.732	Thank you.
298.961	(Applause)
