12.294	I've spent my life working on sustainability.
15.047	I set up a climate change NGO
17.102	called The Climate Group.
18.422	I worked on forestry issues in WWF.
21.813	I worked on development and agriculture issues
23.889	in the U.N. system.
25.624	About 25 years in total,
27.548	and then three years ago, I found myself talking to
30.271	IKEA's CEO about joining his team.
33.556	Like many people here, well,
35.582	I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,
39.517	so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.
44.203	But first, let's just take three numbers.
47.01	The first number is three:
49.081	three billion people.
50.641	This is the number of people joining
52.452	the global middle class by 2030,
54.504	coming out of poverty.
55.813	It's fantastic for them and their families,
58.054	but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,
61.097	and this swells that number to five,
63.394	a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.
66.724	The second number is six:
68.601	This is six degrees centigrade,
70.746	what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.
73.31	We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees
75.361	or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.
77.709	And if you think about it, all of the weird weather
80.398	we've been having the last few years,
82.241	much of that is due to just one degree warming,
84.823	and we need CO2 emissions to peak
87.118	by the end of this decade globally
89.35	and then come down.
91.078	It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.
95.149	The third number is 12:
96.91	That's the number of cities in the world
98.403	that had a million or more people
100.194	when my grandmother was born.
101.627	You can see my grandmother there.
103.247	That was in the beginning of the last century.
105.29	So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,
107.306	the ninth largest city in the world.
109.327	Now there are 500 cities, nearly,
112.032	with a million people or more in them.
114.463	And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,
117.807	that's the century when we build all the world's cities,
121.551	the century that we're in the middle of right now.
123.961	Every other century was kind of practice,
126.807	and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.
131.625	So think about it.
133.38	We're building cities like never before,
136.15	bringing people out of poverty like never before,
138.676	and changing the climate like never before.
141.051	Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do
144.111	to a must-do.
145.776	it's about what we do right here, right now,
148.609	and for the rest of our working lives.
152.29	So I'm going to talk a little bit about
154.322	what business can do
155.695	and what a business like IKEA can do,
157.997	and we have a sustainability strategy
160.664	"called ""people and planet positive"""
162.661	to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.
166.308	Why would we not want to have a positive impact
168.443	on the world as a business?
171.031	Other companies have sustainability strategies.
173.519	I'm going to refer to some of those as well,
175.357	and I'm just going to mention a few
176.894	of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.
179.49	But first, let's think of customers.
181.506	We know from asking people from China to the U.S.
185.331	that the vast majority of people care about sustainability
188.659	after the day-to-day issues,
190.541	the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?
193.118	Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?
195.097	Then they care about big issues like climate change.
198.559	But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,
202.991	and they expect business to help,
204.983	and they're a little bit disappointed today.
207.777	So take your mind back and think
210.411	of the first sustainable products.
211.998	We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.
215.911	We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs
218.965	that took five minutes to warm up
220.812	and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.
223.883	And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.
227.251	So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,
229.983	or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,
232.089	or sometimes all three together,
233.758	you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.
237.203	It wasn't a great start.
240.101	Today we have choices.
242.389	We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,
245.686	sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,
250.487	functional or useless.
252.35	So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,
255.215	sustainable products.
257.535	Let's take the LED.
259.831	The LED is the next best thing to daylight.
263.245	The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --
266.426	I'm not going to ask for a show of hands
267.934	of how many of you still have them in your homes,
270.223	wasting energy every time you switch them on --
273.045	change them after this --
274.482	or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --
278.175	but those old incandescent light bulbs
281.966	really should have been sold as heaters.
284.988	They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.
286.965	They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.
289.407	Now we have lights that produce light
291.479	and a little bit of heat on the side.
293.171	You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED
295.997	that you would have done in an old incandescent.
298.04	And the best thing is, they'll also last
299.775	for more than 20 years.
301.354	So think about that.
302.61	You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,
305.106	probably more if you're in this audience.
307.182	You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.
309.792	Your kids could go to school, go to college,
312.344	go away and have kids of their own, come back,
314.299	bring the grandkids,
315.725	you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.
319.611	So LEDs are fantastic.
322.45	What we decided to do
323.976	was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high
326.929	and continue to push all the old bulbs,
329.155	the halogens and the CFLs.
331.146	We decided, over the next two years,
334.076	we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.
336.591	We will go all in.
337.959	And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,
339.668	go 100 percent,
341.112	because then you stop investing in the old stuff,
342.703	you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,
344.857	you use your supply chain and your creativity
347.186	and you get the prices down so everybody can afford
349.943	the best lights so they can save energy.
352.894	(Applause)
357.044	It's not just about products in people's homes.
360.173	We've got to think about the raw materials
361.817	that produce our products.
363.999	Obviously there's fantastic opportunities
365.826	with recycled materials,
367.32	and we can and will go zero waste.
370.163	And there's opportunities in a circular economy.
372.151	But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.
375.593	Let's take cotton.
377.383	Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people
379.112	are wearing cotton right now.
380.523	It's a brilliant textile in use.
382.057	It's really dirty in production.
383.624	It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.
387.758	So we've worked with others,
389.378	with other businesses and NGOs,
390.98	on the Better Cotton Initiative,
392.836	working right back down to the farm,
395.005	and there you can halve the amount of water
396.84	and halve the chemical inputs,
398.671	the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs
401.567	of running many of these farms
403.236	with farmers with low incomes
405.28	can be chemical imports.
406.983	Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.
409.128	Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.
412.003	Already hundreds of thousands of farmers
413.73	have been reached,
415.32	and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.
417.984	Again, we're going all-in.
419.326	By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.
422.476	Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.
425.462	People sometimes think that
428.599	and we've had the conversation in the business.
430.37	Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do
432.212	than 90 percent or 50 percent.
434.199	If you have a 90 percent target,
435.631	everyone in the business finds a reason
437.052	to be in the 10 percent.
438.857	When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,
442.427	and businesspeople like clarity,
445.317	because then you just get the job done.
447.982	So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.
450.73	You've got illegal logging
452.324	and deforestation still on a very large scale,
455.149	or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry
457.849	that we can be proud of.
459.984	It's a simple choice, so we've worked
462.066	for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,
464.61	with literally hundreds of other organizations,
466.98	and there's a point here about collaboration.
469.42	So hundreds of others, of NGOs,
471.315	of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,
473.897	have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,
475.569	which sets standards for forestry
477.351	and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.
479.873	Now together, through our supply chain,
482.116	with partners, we've managed to certify
486.86	That's about the size of Germany.
489.397	And we've decided in the next three years,
491.185	we will double the volume of certified material
493.22	we put through our business.
495.358	So be decisive on these issues.
497.998	Use your supply chain to drive good.
499.969	But then it comes to your operations.
501.995	Some things are certain, I think.
504.645	We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.
507.66	We know the sun will be shining somewhere,
510.583	and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.
513.675	So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?
516.327	And why not take control of it ourselves?
518.555	So we're going 100 percent renewable.
520.915	By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy
523.671	than the energy we consume as a business.
525.691	For all of our stores, our own factories,
527.667	our distribution centers,
529.045	we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,
531.499	and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate
534.873	in six countries, and we're not done yet.
537.5	But think of a solar panel.
539.284	A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.
541.463	The electricity is free.
542.956	Every time the sun comes out after that,
544.761	the electricity is free.
546.196	So this is a good thing for the CFO,
548.213	not just the sustainability guy.
550.156	Every business can do things like this.
553.19	But then we've got to look beyond our operations,
556.169	and I think everybody would agree
557.918	that now business has to take full responsibility
560.29	for the impacts of your supply chain.
562.494	Many businesses now, fortunately,
564.81	have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,
566.817	but not every business. Far from it.
568.863	And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.
571.377	We found there was a risk
573.118	of child labor in the supply chain,
575.12	and people in the business were shocked.
577.63	And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.
580.954	So a code of conduct was developed,
583.098	and now we have 80 auditors out in the world
586.049	every day making sure all our factories
588.08	secure good working conditions
590.364	and protect human rights
591.913	and make sure there is no child labor.
594.174	But it's not just as simple as making sure
596.334	there's no child labor.
598.366	You've got to say that's not enough today.
600.566	I think we'd all agree that children
602.614	are the most important people in the world
604.81	and the most vulnerable.
606.707	So what can a business do today
608.955	to actually use your total value chain
610.839	to support a better quality of life
613.118	and protect child rights?
614.706	We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children
617.003	on developing some new business principles
619.478	with children's rights.
620.943	Increasing numbers of businesses
622.76	are signing up to these,
624.28	but actually in a survey, many business leaders
626.743	said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.
629.61	So what we decided to do was, we will look
633.109	and ask ourselves the tough questions
634.67	with partners who know more than us,
636.734	what can we do to go beyond our business
639.691	to help improve the lives of children?
641.533	We also have a foundation
643.352	that's committed to work through partners
645.247	and help improve the lives and protect the rights
647.87	of 100 million children by 2015.
650.737	You know the phrase,
652.413	you can manage what you measure?
655.791	Well, you should measure what you care about.
660.441	If you're not measuring things,
661.99	you don't care and you don't know.
664.734	So let's take an example, measure the things
666.903	that are important in your business.
669.06	Isn't it about time that businesses
671.343	were led equally by men and women?
674.321	(Applause)
677.304	So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA
682.446	that 47 percent are women today,
685.41	but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap
687.806	and follow it all the way through to senior management.
690.093	And we do not want to wait another hundred years.
692.939	So we've launched a women's open network
695.898	this week in IKEA,
697.423	and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.
699.599	So the message here is,
701.014	measure what you care about and lead the change,
703.398	and don't wait a hundred years.
706.401	So we've gone from sustainability
708.838	being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.
714.074	It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.
717.226	And everybody can do something on this as an individual.
722.161	Be a discerning consumer.
724.357	Vote with your wallets.
726.055	Search out the companies
728.235	that are acting on this.
730.93	But also, there are other businesses already acting.
733.977	I mentioned renewable energy.
736.122	You go to Google or Lego,
738.44	they're going 100 percent renewable too,
740.7	in the same way that we are.
742.067	On having really good sustainability strategies,
745.193	there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,
748.437	Timberland, Marks &amp; Spencer.
750.591	But I don't think any of those businesses would say
752.749	they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.
755.014	We'll make mistakes going forward,
757.38	but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,
759.897	having a dialogue with the right partners,
761.586	and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.
766.102	So if you're a business leader,
768.901	if you're not already weaving sustainability
771.856	right into the heart of your business model,
774.264	I'd urge you to do so.
776.155	And together, we can help create
778.13	a sustainable world,
780.13	and, if we get it right,
782.259	we can make sustainability
783.748	affordable for the many people,
785.37	not a luxury for the few.
787.067	Thank you.
788.424	(Applause)
