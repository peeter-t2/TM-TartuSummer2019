25	On simplicity. What a great way to start.
30	First of all, I've been watching this trend
32	"where we have these books like such and such ""For Dummies."""
35	"Do you know these books, these such and such ""For Dummies?"""
37	My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.
41	(Laughter)
44	But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
48	"You know, there's also something called the ""Complete Idiot's Guide?"""
51	There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
54	We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
57	"But I really like that, so I wrote a book called ""The Laws of Simplicity."""
61	I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
64	It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
68	Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?
71	Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.
75	"After I wrote ""The Laws of Simplicity,"""
77	I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
80	And so in my life, I've discovered that
82	vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.
85	Because your companies will always take away your life,
88	but they can never take away your vacation -- in theory.
91	(Laughter)
92	So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,
95	and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
97	So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,
99	"and unfortunately, their branding was all about ""Keep It Simple."""
103	(Laughter)
105	I opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,
107	"""Business Takes Simplicity."""
109	"I develop photographs, and Kodak said, ""Keep It Simple."""
112	So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.
115	So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,
118	but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.
122	"And she has this show, ""The Simple Life."""
124	So I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.
128	(Laughter)
130	So, I looked for a different show to watch.
132	So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,
134	"and on the E! channel, this ""Simple Life"" show is very popular."
137	They'll play it over, and over, and over.
139	(Laughter)
140	So it was traumatizing, actually.
142	So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.
147	And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.
152	And when you drive, these signs are very important.
154	"It's a very simple sign, it says, ""road"" and ""road approaching."""
158	So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.
162	(Laughter)
164	So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,
166	"so I thought, ""Ah, simplicity. Very important."""
169	"But then I thought, ""Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?"
173	"What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"""
177	I mean that simplicity sky.
179	But in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.
184	You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.
187	We're human beings: we love complex things.
189	We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.
192	I'm at this place called the Media Lab.
194	Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.
196	It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.
200	Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.
204	(Laughter)
206	And some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.
209	Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.
214	You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.
217	See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.
221	Last year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.
224	I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.
227	This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,
230	in addition to my previous titles.
232	"Another ""Associate Director of Research."""
234	And this also happened, so I have five daughters now.
238	(Laughter)
239	That's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.
241	And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,
244	but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.
248	But looking way back, when I was a child --
250	you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
252	Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,
255	but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.
257	It's very hard work to make tofu.
260	As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.
266	My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.
270	So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.
275	We were a great model. So, I loved going to school.
279	School was great, and maybe going to school
281	helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.
283	(Laughter)
285	Thank you.
287	But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me
291	because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,
293	and I discovered design later on in my life.
296	And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.
298	Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
300	Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.
303	And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,
307	she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.
310	And she's very important in my life,
312	because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.
315	It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.
319	She passed away in 1994,
321	and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.
326	This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
328	When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan --
331	I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.
336	Some of you guys know Paul Rand,
338	the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.
340	The great graphic designer Paul Rand
342	designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
344	"He basically said, ""I've designed everything."""
347	And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life --
351	the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,
356	like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.
359	When you have mentors -- and yesterday,
361	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,
363	these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.
367	This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,
369	because you can remember them in their pure form.
372	I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.
376	When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,
378	the mentors calm us down.
380	And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.
385	Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.
387	"The T doesn't stand for ""human,"" it stands for ""technology."""
390	And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
393	"So, I've always been Googling this word, ""human,"""
395	to find out how many hits I get.
397	"And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for ""computer,"""
401	because computers are against humans a bit,
403	I have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.
406	So, if you sort of compare that, like this,
408	you'll see that computer versus human --
411	I've been tracking this for the last year --
413	computer versus human over the last year has changed.
416	It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.
419	Very good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.
422	In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.
424	So if you compare complexities to simplicity,
428	it's also catching up in a way, too.
430	So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.
436	I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.
439	I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
442	Lots of complex stuff.
444	I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
448	I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.
451	And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.
454	So, I hid in a time dimension.
456	I built things in a time-graphics dimension.
459	I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
462	This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,
465	and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,
470	because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,
473	you're cooler for some reason.
475	This is why they have fireworks in the summer.
477	A very extreme culture.
480	Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,
482	because I have so many leaves in my yard.
484	So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.
486	And so I made a lot of these types of things.
490	I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,
493	and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.
496	I feel kind of bad about that.
498	Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.
501	She has this show right now at MoMA,
503	where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.
507	If you're in New York, please go and see that.
509	But I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff
513	"and people say, ""Oh, I know your work."
516	"You're the guy that makes eye candy."""
518	And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.
520	"""Eye candy"" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?"
523	"So, I say, ""No, I make eye meat,"" instead."
525	(Laughter)
526	And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,
529	something more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?
533	I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.
537	Computer programs are essentially trees,
539	and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.
542	Whenever you make art with a computer program,
544	you're always on the tree, and the paradox is that
547	for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.
551	So, this is sort of a complication I've found.
554	So, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.
558	I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
562	This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.
566	You can't type very much on this.
569	I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions
573	and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.
579	And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing --
582	"that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, ""whack,"" like that."
585	"But I thought, ""This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"""
588	So I have a crash test.
590	(Laughter)
591	And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,
593	just to sort of understand what these things are.
596	(Laughter)
598	Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.
601	I was concerned with contemporary art
603	that was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,
605	and so I wanted to think about something happy.
607	So I focused on food as my area --
609	these sort of clementine peel things.
611	In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel
614	just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?
617	Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.
619	It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,
621	actually, in different forms.
623	If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,
626	and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
629	So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,
633	and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,
638	and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.
643	And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,
645	"""Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"""
649	so I made this amber waves image.
651	It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.
654	And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,
658	so I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.
661	So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.
663	I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.
667	Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.
669	(Laughter)
671	I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.
674	And with these Cheetos, I began to think,
676	"""What can I make with these Cheetos?"""
678	And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.
683	I was looking for some kind of form,
685	and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?
688	(Laughter)
690	And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.
693	People ask me how they make the antenna.
696	Sometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.
698	My hair's clean -- it's okay.
700	I'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.
703	It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday
706	and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.
709	End of story.
711	(Laughter)
712	But I realized that life could be very boring,
714	so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera --
716	my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.
721	The car is so big, the camera is so small,
723	yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.
727	It doesn't make any sense.
729	(Laughter)
731	"So, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word ""simplicity,"""
734	and I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,
737	that I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?
740	"In the words ""simplicity"" and ""complexity,"" M, I, T occur in perfect sequence."
744	It's a bit eerie, isn't it?
746	So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
749	"And I wrote this book, ""The Laws of Simplicity."""
751	It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
756	The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,
759	and also that's why it's on the Web for free.
761	But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.
765	In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.
767	You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.
770	People hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.
773	The three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.
777	So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.
782	Because I want to simplify them for you.
784	Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.
786	So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,
789	I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.
792	Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid
794	a big cookie or a small cookie,
796	which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.
799	You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,
802	but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.
805	But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,
809	the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?
812	Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.
817	You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.
820	When you want less, it's because it's about work.
823	And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life
827	with more enjoyment and less pain.
829	I think this is sort of simple more versus less.
831	Basically, it always depends.
835	This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.
837	I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.
839	And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,
841	because you're trying to simplify your life.
844	And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.
847	By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.
850	And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.
854	Like everything you see, every time you wake up.
856	It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
860	From everything from a weird hotel lobby,
862	to Saran wrap placed over your window,
865	to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,
869	and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.
872	And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,
876	because life is finite.
878	This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
881	He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are --
884	twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old --
888	and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,
894	and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.
898	Also, if you look at your physical strength.
900	You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,
903	"""Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,"
906	"but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."""
909	OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
912	And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
915	As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,
919	and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,
922	and your vision goes after that.
924	(Laughter)
928	Your social responsibility is very interesting.
930	So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.
933	And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more --
937	that's very good, too.
939	But if any of you people ask,
941	"""What actually goes up? Does anything go up?"
943	"What's the positive part of this, you know?"" I think wisdom always goes up."
946	I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.
949	They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,
951	and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here.
953	And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
957	This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.
961	And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.
964	And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
