12.841	I have a confession to make.
16.968	But first, I want you to make
16.968	a little confession to me.
23.779	In the past year,
23.779	I want you to just raise your hand
26.557	if you've experienced
26.557	relatively little stress.
29.971	Anyone?
32.604	How about a moderate amount of stress?
35.84	Who has experienced a lot of stress?
38.441	Yeah. Me too.
40.849	But that is not my confession.
42.997	My confession is this:
44.782	I am a health psychologist,
46.803	and my mission is to help people
46.803	be happier and healthier.
51.699	But I fear that something
51.699	I've been teaching
54.926	for the last 10 years
54.926	is doing more harm than good,
59.254	and it has to do with stress.
61.826	For years I've been telling people,
61.826	stress makes you sick.
64.853	It increases the risk of everything
64.853	from the common cold
67.748	to cardiovascular disease.
70.134	Basically, I've turned stress
70.134	into the enemy.
74.383	But I have changed my mind about stress,
77.095	and today, I want to change yours.
81.01	Let me start with the study
81.01	that made me rethink
83.39	my whole approach to stress.
86.004	This study tracked 30,000 adults
86.004	in the United States for eight years,
90.663	and they started by asking people,
93.19	"""How much stress have you"
93.19	"experienced in the last year?"""
97.088	They also asked,
98.652	"""Do you believe that stress"
98.652	"is harmful for your health?"""
104.43	And then they used public death records
104.43	to find out who died.
108.01	(Laughter)
109.215	Okay.
111.037	Some bad news first.
113.211	People who experienced a lot of stress
113.211	in the previous year
116.636	had a 43 percent increased risk of dying.
120.612	But that was only true for the people
124.395	who also believed that stress
124.395	is harmful for your health.
128.056	(Laughter)
130.84	People who experienced a lot of stress
133.14	but did not view stress as harmful
135.104	were no more likely to die.
136.805	In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying
140.372	of anyone in the study,
141.696	including people
141.696	who had relatively little stress.
144.896	Now the researchers estimated
144.896	that over the eight years
147.54	they were tracking deaths,
152.334	not from stress,
153.796	but from the belief
153.796	that stress is bad for you.
157.001	(Laughter)
158.257	That is over 20,000 deaths a year.
161.931	Now, if that estimate is correct,
164.759	that would make
164.759	believing stress is bad for you
167.022	the 15th largest cause of death
167.022	in the United States last year,
171.117	killing more people than skin cancer,
171.117	HIV/AIDS and homicide.
177.172	(Laughter)
179.311	You can see why this study freaked me out.
182.136	Here I've been spending
182.136	so much energy telling people
186.209	stress is bad for your health.
189.09	So this study got me wondering:
190.786	Can changing how you think
190.786	about stress make you healthier?
194.882	And here the science says yes.
196.726	When you change your mind about stress,
198.808	you can change
198.808	your body's response to stress.
202.084	Now to explain how this works,
204.441	I want you all to pretend
204.441	that you are participants
207.322	in a study designed to stress you out.
209.929	It's called the social stress test.
212.613	You come into the laboratory,
214.667	and you're told you have to give
216.662	a five-minute impromptu speech
216.662	on your personal weaknesses
221.301	to a panel of expert evaluators
221.301	sitting right in front of you,
224.958	and to make sure you feel the pressure,
226.84	there are bright lights
226.84	and a camera in your face,
229.811	kind of like this.
231.294	(Laughter)
232.476	And the evaluators have been trained
235.38	to give you discouraging,
235.38	non-verbal feedback,
239.096	like this.
245.334	(Exhales)
246.359	(Laughter)
249.264	Now that you're sufficiently demoralized,
251.356	time for part two: a math test.
254.156	And unbeknownst to you,
256.257	the experimenter has been trained
256.257	to harass you during it.
260.285	Now we're going to all do this together.
262.659	It's going to be fun.
264.404	For me.
265.451	Okay.
266.492	(Laughter)
267.723	I want you all to count backwards from 996
271.746	in increments of seven.
273.138	You're going to do this out loud,
274.766	as fast as you can,
276.774	starting with 996.
278.89	Go!
279.952	(Audience counting)
281.333	Go faster. Faster please.
284.146	You're going too slow.
285.536	(Audience counting)
286.598	Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
288.114	That guy made a mistake.
289.544	We are going to have to start
289.544	all over again.
291.766	(Laughter)
292.791	You're not very good at this, are you?
295.027	Okay, so you get the idea.
296.501	If you were actually in this study,
298.34	you'd probably be a little stressed out.
300.286	Your heart might be pounding,
301.825	you might be breathing faster,
301.825	maybe breaking out into a sweat.
305.229	And normally, we interpret
305.229	these physical changes as anxiety
309.825	or signs that we aren't coping
309.825	very well with the pressure.
313.142	But what if you viewed them instead
315.015	as signs that your body was energized,
317.362	was preparing you to meet this challenge?
321.064	Now that is exactly
321.064	what participants were told
323.65	in a study conducted
323.65	at Harvard University.
326.596	Before they went
326.596	through the social stress test,
329.417	they were taught to rethink
329.417	their stress response as helpful.
332.623	That pounding heart
332.623	is preparing you for action.
336.408	If you're breathing faster,
336.408	it's no problem.
338.761	It's getting more oxygen to your brain.
341.846	And participants who learned to view
341.846	the stress response
344.543	as helpful for their performance,
346.78	well, they were less stressed out,
346.78	less anxious, more confident,
350.287	but the most fascinating finding to me
352.38	was how their physical
352.38	stress response changed.
355.906	Now, in a typical stress response,
357.655	your heart rate goes up,
359.471	and your blood vessels
359.471	constrict like this.
364.343	And this is one of the reasons
364.343	that chronic stress
366.95	is sometimes associated
366.95	with cardiovascular disease.
369.809	It's not really healthy to be
369.809	in this state all the time.
373.518	But in the study,
374.63	when participants viewed
374.63	their stress response as helpful,
377.661	their blood vessels
377.661	stayed relaxed like this.
381.176	Their heart was still pounding,
382.977	but this is a much healthier
382.977	cardiovascular profile.
385.728	It actually looks a lot like what happens
388.383	in moments of joy and courage.
393.391	Over a lifetime of stressful experiences,
395.935	this one biological change
399.125	could be the difference
400.429	between a stress-induced
400.429	heart attack at age 50
403.433	and living well into your 90s.
406.356	And this is really what the new
406.356	science of stress reveals,
409.441	that how you think about stress matters.
413.197	So my goal as a health
413.197	psychologist has changed.
416.11	I no longer want
416.11	to get rid of your stress.
418.272	I want to make you better at stress.
421.23	And we just did a little intervention.
423.935	If you raised your hand and said
425.483	you'd had a lot of stress
425.483	in the last year,
427.552	we could have saved your life,
429.395	because hopefully the next time
429.395	your heart is pounding from stress,
432.946	you're going to remember this talk
434.793	and you're going to think to yourself,
436.955	this is my body helping me
436.955	rise to this challenge.
442.129	And when you view stress in that way,
444.468	your body believes you,
446.525	and your stress response
446.525	becomes healthier.
450.204	Now I said I have over a decade
450.204	of demonizing stress
454.38	to redeem myself from,
456.354	so we are going to do
456.354	one more intervention.
458.964	I want to tell you
460.092	about one of the most under-appreciated
460.092	aspects of the stress response,
463.987	and the idea is this:
465.846	Stress makes you social.
469.266	To understand this side of stress,
471.05	we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin,
473.917	and I know oxytocin has already gotten
473.917	as much hype as a hormone can get.
478.865	It even has its own cute nickname,
478.865	the cuddle hormone,
482.204	because it's released
482.204	when you hug someone.
484.89	But this is a very small part
484.89	of what oxytocin is involved in.
489.572	Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone.
491.87	It fine-tunes
491.87	your brain's social instincts.
495.978	It primes you to do things
497.975	that strengthen close relationships.
501.486	Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact
501.486	with your friends and family.
506.334	It enhances your empathy.
507.92	It even makes you more willing
507.92	to help and support
510.628	the people you care about.
513.672	Some people have even suggested
513.672	we should snort oxytocin...
519.179	to become more compassionate and caring.
523.34	But here's what most people
523.34	don't understand about oxytocin.
528.164	It's a stress hormone.
531.13	Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out
534.248	as part of the stress response.
535.796	It's as much a part
535.796	of your stress response
538.047	as the adrenaline that makes
538.047	your heart pound.
542.271	And when oxytocin is released
542.271	in the stress response,
544.969	it is motivating you to seek support.
548.33	Your biological stress response
550.383	is nudging you to tell
550.383	someone how you feel,
553.926	instead of bottling it up.
556.306	Your stress response wants
556.306	to make sure you notice
559.41	when someone else
559.41	in your life is struggling
561.729	so that you can support each other.
564.299	When life is difficult,
565.983	your stress response wants you
565.983	to be surrounded
570.594	by people who care about you.
573.158	Okay, so how is knowing this side
573.158	of stress going to make you healthier?
577.686	Well, oxytocin doesn't only act
577.686	on your brain.
580.271	It also acts on your body,
582.662	and one of its main roles in your body
584.861	is to protect your cardiovascular system
584.861	from the effects of stress.
589.956	It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
592.524	It also helps your blood vessels
592.524	stay relaxed during stress.
595.969	But my favorite effect on the body
595.969	is actually on the heart.
599.366	Your heart has receptors for this hormone,
603.328	and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate
606.806	and heal from any stress-induced damage.
610.774	This stress hormone
610.774	strengthens your heart.
615.591	And the cool thing
615.591	is that all of these physical benefits
618.857	of oxytocin are enhanced
618.857	by social contact and social support.
623.907	So when you reach out
623.907	to others under stress,
626.826	either to seek support
626.826	or to help someone else,
630.099	you release more of this hormone,
632.107	your stress response becomes healthier,
634.369	and you actually recover
634.369	faster from stress.
637.658	I find this amazing,
639.801	that your stress response
639.801	has a built-in mechanism
643.729	for stress resilience,
646.634	and that mechanism is human connection.
651.174	I want to finish by telling you
651.174	about one more study.
654.398	And listen up, because this study
654.398	could also save a life.
658.651	This study tracked about 1,000 adults
658.651	in the United States,
661.93	and they ranged in age from 34 to 93,
666.093	and they started the study by asking,
668.362	"""How much stress have you"
668.362	"experienced in the last year?"""
672.779	They also asked,
674.304	"""How much time have you spent"
674.304	helping out friends, neighbors,
678.963	"people in your community?"""
682.133	And then they used public records
682.133	for the next five years
684.908	to find out who died.
687.531	Okay, so the bad news first:
690.212	For every major stressful life experience,
693.171	like financial difficulties
693.171	or family crisis,
696.22	that increased the risk
696.22	of dying by 30 percent.
700.451	But -- and I hope you
700.451	"are expecting a ""but"" by now --"
704.445	but that wasn't true for everyone.
706.876	People who spent time caring for others
710.538	showed absolutely no stress-related
710.538	increase in dying.
715.065	Zero.
716.738	Caring created resilience.
720.233	And so we see once again
721.716	that the harmful effects
721.716	of stress on your health
724.354	are not inevitable.
726.578	How you think and how you act
729.038	can transform your experience of stress.
732.998	When you choose to view
732.998	your stress response as helpful,
737.936	you create the biology of courage.
742.547	And when you choose to connect
742.547	with others under stress,
745.988	you can create resilience.
749.606	Now I wouldn't necessarily ask
749.606	for more stressful experiences in my life,
755.16	but this science has given me
755.16	a whole new appreciation for stress.
761.237	Stress gives us access to our hearts.
765.897	The compassionate heart
765.897	that finds joy and meaning
769.58	in connecting with others,
771.118	and yes, your pounding physical heart,
774.68	working so hard to give you
774.68	strength and energy.
779.945	And when you choose to view
779.945	stress in this way,
783.288	you're not just getting better at stress,
785.8	you're actually making
785.8	a pretty profound statement.
789.627	You're saying that you can trust yourself
789.627	to handle life's challenges.
795.928	And you're remembering
795.928	that you don't have to face them alone.
801.659	Thank you.
802.733	(Applause)
812.014	Chris Anderson: This is kind
812.014	of amazing, what you're telling us.
815.086	It seems amazing to me
815.086	that a belief about stress
819.017	can make so much difference
819.017	to someone's life expectancy.
823.5	How would that extend to advice,
825.726	like, if someone is making
825.726	a lifestyle choice
827.893	between, say, a stressful job
827.893	and a non-stressful job,
831.772	does it matter which way they go?
834.453	It's equally wise to go
834.453	for the stressful job
836.982	so long as you believe
836.982	that you can handle it, in some sense?
839.919	KM: Yeah, and one thing
839.919	we know for certain
842.203	is that chasing meaning
842.203	is better for your health
844.611	than trying to avoid discomfort.
846.215	And so I would say that's really
846.215	the best way to make decisions,
849.287	is go after what it is
849.287	that creates meaning in your life
852.034	and then trust yourself to handle
852.034	the stress that follows.
855.758	CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.
855.758	It's pretty cool.
858.154	(Applause)
