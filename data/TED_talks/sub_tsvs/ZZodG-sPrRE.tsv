17.855	Dannielle Hadley: Life
17.855	in Pennsylvania means just that:
22.61	life without the possibility of parole.
26.302	For us lifers,
28.182	as we call ourselves,
30.411	our only chance for release
32.455	is through commutation,
34.684	which has only been granted
34.684	to two women since 1989,
39.304	close to 30 years ago.
42.105	"Our song, ""This Is Not Our Home,"""
45.959	it tells of our experiences
47.887	while doing life without
47.887	the possibility of parole.

72.29	Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman.
75.3	I'm a grandmother.
78.327	I'm a daughter.
81.206	I have a son.
84.123	I'm not an angel.
86.77	I'm not the devil.
89.928	I came to jail
92.711	when I was so young.
102.482	I spend my time here
107.292	inside these prison walls.
113.283	Lost friends to death,
116.851	saw some go home.
123.267	Watch years pass,
127.09	people come and go,
131.254	while I do life without parole.
145.103	I am a prisoner
145.103	for the wrong I've done.
150.378	I'm doing time here.
153.373	This is not my home.
155.254	Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.
160.316	Will I see
164.449	my family
168.187	or die alone?
178.728	As the years go by,
182.211	I hold back my tears,
187.83	because if I cry I'd give in to fear.
196.305	I must be strong, have to hold on.
204.11	Gotta get through
208.029	another year.
212.378	I am a prisoner
212.378	for the wrong I've done.
217.881	I'm doing time here.
217.881	This is not my home.
221.573	Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.
226.658	Will I see
231.13	my family
234.25	or die alone?
244.397	I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,
248.669	I'm not saying that I shouldn't pay.
253.244	All I'm asking is for forgiveness.
256.982	Gotta have hope I'll be free someday.
268.731	Is there a place for me
274.605	in the world out there?
278.901	Will they ever know or care
278.901	that I'm chained?
287.246	Is there redemption for the sin
287.246	of my younger days?
294.363	Because I've changed.
298.308	Lord knows I've changed.
302.39	I am a prisoner
302.39	for the wrong I've done.
307.596	I'm doing time here.
