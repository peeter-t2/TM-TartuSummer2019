15.26	What do I know
17.26	that would cause me,
19.26	a reticent, Midwestern scientist,
21.26	to get myself arrested
24.26	in front of the White House protesting?
27.26	And what would you do
29.26	if you knew what I know?
31.26	Let's start with how I got to this point.
35.26	I was lucky to grow up
37.26	at a time when it was not difficult
40.26	for the child of a tenant farmer
42.26	to make his way to the state university.
44.26	And I was really lucky
47.26	to go to the University of Iowa
49.26	where I could study under Professor James Van Allen
52.26	who built instruments
54.26	for the first U.S. satellites.
56.26	Professor Van Allen told me
59.26	about observations of Venus,
62.26	that there was intense microwave radiation.
64.26	Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
67.26	Or was Venus extremely hot?
69.26	The right answer,
71.26	confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,
76.26	was that Venus was very hot --
81.26	And it was kept hot
83.26	by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
86.26	I was fortunate to join NASA
88.26	and successfully propose
90.26	an experiment to fly to Venus.
92.26	Our instrument took this image
95.26	of the veil of Venus,
97.26	which turned out to be
99.26	a smog of sulfuric acid.
102.26	But while our instrument was being built,
105.26	I became involved in calculations
107.26	of the greenhouse effect
109.26	here on Earth,
111.26	because we realized
113.26	that our atmospheric composition was changing.
116.26	Eventually, I resigned
118.26	as principal investigator
120.26	on our Venus experiment
122.26	because a planet changing before our eyes
125.26	is more interesting and important.
127.26	Its changes will affect all of humanity.
130.26	The greenhouse effect had been well understood
132.26	for more than a century.
134.26	British physicist John Tyndall,
136.26	in the 1850's,
138.26	made laboratory measurements
140.26	of the infrared radiation,
142.26	which is heat.
144.26	And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,
147.26	thus acting like a blanket
150.26	warming Earth's surface.
152.26	I worked with other scientists
154.26	to analyze Earth climate observations.
158.26	In 1981,
160.26	we published an article in Science magazine
163.26	concluding that observed warming
165.26	of 0.4 degrees Celsius
167.26	in the prior century
169.26	was consistent with the greenhouse effect
171.26	of increasing CO2.
173.26	That Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,
176.26	and warming would exceed
178.26	the noise level of random weather
180.26	by the end of the century.
182.26	We also said that the 21st century
185.26	would see shifting climate zones,
187.26	creation of drought-prone regions
189.26	in North America and Asia,
191.26	erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels
194.26	and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.
197.26	All of these impacts
199.26	have since either happened
201.26	or are now well under way.
203.26	That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times
207.26	and led to me testifying to Congress
209.26	in the 1980's,
211.26	testimony in which I emphasized
214.26	that global warming increases both extremes
217.26	of the Earth's water cycle.
220.26	Heatwaves and droughts on one hand,
222.26	directly from the warming,
224.26	but also, because a warmer atmosphere
226.26	holds more water vapor
228.26	with its latent energy,
230.26	rainfall will become
232.26	in more extreme events.
234.26	There will be stronger storms and greater flooding.
237.26	Global warming hoopla
240.26	became time-consuming
242.26	and distracted me from doing science --
244.26	partly because I had complained
246.26	that the White House altered my testimony.
249.26	So I decided to go back
251.26	to strictly doing science
253.26	and leave the communication to others.
257.26	By 15 years later,
260.26	evidence of global warming was much stronger.
263.26	Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper
266.26	were facts.
268.26	I had the privilege to speak twice
271.26	to the president's climate task force.
273.26	But energy policies continued to focus
276.26	on finding more fossil fuels.
279.26	By then we had two grandchildren,
282.26	Sophie and Connor.
284.26	I decided
286.26	that I did not want them in the future
288.26	"to say, ""Opa understood what was happening,"
290.26	"but he didn't make it clear."""
292.26	So I decided to give a public talk
295.26	criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.
298.26	I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004
301.26	and at the 2005 meeting
304.26	of the American Geophysical Union.
307.26	This led to calls
309.26	from the White House to NASA headquarters
311.26	and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media
314.26	without prior explicit approval
317.26	by NASA headquarters.
320.26	After I informed the New York Times
322.26	about these restrictions,
324.26	NASA was forced to end the censorship.
327.26	But there were consequences.
329.26	I had been using the first line
331.26	of the NASA mission statement,
333.26	"""To understand and protect the home planet,"""
336.26	to justify my talks.
338.26	Soon the first line of the mission statement
340.26	was deleted, never to appear again.
344.26	Over the next few years
346.26	I was drawn more and more
348.26	into trying to communicate the urgency
351.26	of a change in energy policies,
354.26	while still researching the physics of climate change.
357.26	Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics --
360.26	first, from Earth's energy balance
363.26	and, second, from Earth's climate history.
367.26	Adding CO2 to the air
369.26	is like throwing another blanket on the bed.
372.26	It reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,
375.26	so there's a temporary energy imbalance.
378.26	More energy is coming in
380.26	than going out,
382.26	until Earth warms up enough
384.26	to again radiate to space
386.26	as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.
388.26	So the key quantity
390.26	is Earth's energy imbalance.
393.26	Is there more energy coming in
395.26	than going out?
397.26	If so, more warming is in the pipeline.
400.26	It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.
404.26	Now finally,
406.26	we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely
410.26	by measuring the heat content
412.26	in Earth's heat reservoirs.
415.26	The biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,
418.26	until more than 3,000 Argo floats
421.26	were distributed around the world's ocean.
424.26	These floats reveal
426.26	that the upper half of the ocean
428.26	is gaining heat at a substantial rate.
431.26	The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,
434.26	and energy is going
436.26	into the net melting of ice all around the planet.
439.26	And the land, to depths of tens of meters,
442.26	is also warming.
444.26	The total energy imbalance now
447.26	is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
451.26	That may not sound like much,
453.26	but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
456.26	It's about 20 times greater
459.26	than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
462.26	It's equivalent to exploding
473.26	That's how much extra energy
475.26	Earth is gaining each day.
477.26	This imbalance,
479.26	if we want to stabilize climate,
482.26	means that we must reduce CO2
484.26	from 391 ppm, parts per million,
487.26	back to 350 ppm.
490.26	That is the change needed to restore energy balance
493.26	and prevent further warming.
495.26	Climate change deniers argue
498.26	that the Sun is the main cause of climate change.
501.26	But the measured energy imbalance occurred
504.26	during the deepest solar minimum in the record,
508.26	when the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.
512.26	Yet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
515.26	This shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate
518.26	is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,
521.26	mainly from burning fossil fuels.
524.26	Now consider Earth's climate history.
527.26	These curves for global temperature,
529.26	atmospheric CO2 and sea level
532.26	were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,
535.26	from ocean sediments and snowflakes
537.26	that piled up year after year
540.26	over 800,000 years
542.26	forming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
544.26	As you see, there's a high correlation
547.26	between temperature, CO2 and sea level.
550.26	Careful examination shows
552.26	that the temperature changes
554.26	slightly lead the CO2 changes
556.26	by a few centuries.
559.26	Climate change deniers like to use this fact
562.26	to confuse and trick the public
565.26	"by saying, ""Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,"
568.26	"not vice versa."""
570.26	But that lag
572.26	is exactly what is expected.
575.26	Small changes in Earth's orbit
578.26	that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years
581.26	alter the distribution
583.26	of sunlight on Earth.
585.26	When there is more sunlight
587.26	at high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
590.26	Shrinking ice sheets
592.26	make the planet darker,
594.26	so it absorbs more sunlight
596.26	and becomes warmer.
598.26	A warmer ocean releases CO2,
600.26	just as a warm Coca-Cola does.
603.26	And more CO2 causes more warming.
606.26	So CO2, methane, and ice sheets
609.26	were feedbacks
611.26	that amplified global temperature change
614.26	causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,
617.26	even though the climate change was initiated
620.26	by a very weak forcing.
622.26	The important point
624.26	is that these same amplifying feedbacks
626.26	will occur today.
628.26	The physics does not change.
630.26	As Earth warms,
632.26	now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,
635.26	ice will melt,
637.26	and CO2 and methane will be released
639.26	by warming ocean and melting permafrost.
642.26	While we can't say exactly how fast
645.26	these amplifying feedbacks will occur,
648.26	it is certain they will occur,
651.26	unless we stop the warming.
653.26	There is evidence
655.26	that feedbacks are already beginning.
658.26	Precise measurements
660.26	by GRACE, the gravity satellite,
662.26	reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica
665.26	are now losing mass,
667.26	several hundred cubic kilometers per year.
670.26	And the rate has accelerated
672.26	since the measurements began
674.26	nine years ago.
676.26	Methane is also beginning
678.26	to escape from the permafrost.
681.26	What sea level rise
683.26	can we look forward to?
685.26	The last time CO2 was 390 ppm,
688.26	today's value,
690.26	sea level was higher
692.26	by at least 15 meters, 50 feet.
695.26	Where you are sitting now
697.26	would be under water.
699.26	Most estimates are that, this century,
702.26	we will get at least one meter.
704.26	I think it will be more
706.26	if we keep burning fossil fuels,
708.26	perhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,
711.26	this century or shortly thereafter.
714.26	The important point
716.26	is that we will have started a process
719.26	that is out of humanity's control.
722.26	Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.
725.26	There would be no stable shoreline.
727.26	The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.
730.26	Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations
734.26	around the world.
736.26	What may be more reprehensible,
738.26	if climate denial continues,
740.26	is extermination of species.
742.26	The monarch butterfly
744.26	could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species
749.26	that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates
752.26	will be ticketed for extinction
754.26	by the end of the century
756.26	if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.
760.26	Global warming is already affecting people.
763.26	The Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico
765.26	heatwave and drought last year,
768.26	Moscow the year before
770.26	and Europe in 2003,
772.26	were all exceptional events,
775.26	more than three standard deviations outside the norm.
779.26	Fifty years ago,
781.26	such anomalies
783.26	covered only two- to three-tenths
785.26	of one percent of the land area.
787.26	In recent years,
789.26	because of global warming,
791.26	they now cover about 10 percent --
793.26	an increase by a factor of 25 to 50.
796.26	So we can say with a high degree of confidence
799.26	that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves
801.26	were not natural;
803.26	they were caused by global warming.
806.26	An important impact,
808.26	if global warming continues,
810.26	will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,
813.26	the Midwest and Great Plains,
815.26	which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,
818.26	worse than the Dust Bowl,
820.26	within just a few decades,
822.26	if we let global warming continue.
826.26	How did I get dragged deeper and deeper
829.26	into an attempt to communicate,
831.26	giving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,
834.26	burning up the vacation time
836.26	that I had accumulated over 30 years?
840.26	More grandchildren helped me along.
843.26	Jake is a super-positive,
845.26	enthusiastic boy.
848.26	Here at age two and a half years,
850.26	he thinks he can protect
852.26	his two and a half-day-old little sister.
855.26	It would be immoral
857.26	to leave these young people
859.26	with a climate system
861.26	spiraling out of control.
863.26	Now the tragedy about climate change
866.26	is that we can solve it
868.26	with a simple, honest approach
870.26	of a gradually rising carbon fee
873.26	collected from fossil fuel companies
875.26	and distributed 100 percent electronically
879.26	every month to all legal residents
881.26	on a per capita basis,
883.26	with the government not keeping one dime.
887.26	Most people would get more in the monthly dividend
890.26	than they'd pay in increased prices.
892.26	This fee and dividend
894.26	would stimulate the economy
896.26	and innovations,
898.26	creating millions of jobs.
900.26	It is the principal requirement
902.26	for moving us rapidly
905.26	to a clean energy future.
907.26	Several top economists
909.26	are coauthors on this proposition.
912.26	Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection
915.26	describes it thusly:
917.26	"""Transparent. Market-based."
919.26	Does not enlarge government.
921.26	Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.
924.26	"Sounds like a conservative climate plan."""
928.26	But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions
932.26	to make fossil fuels pay
935.26	their true cost to society,
937.26	our governments are forcing the public
940.26	to subsidize fossil fuels
943.26	by 400 to 500 billion dollars
946.26	per year worldwide,
948.26	thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel --
951.26	mountaintop removal,
953.26	longwall mining, fracking,
955.26	tar sands, tar shale,
957.26	deep ocean Arctic drilling.
960.26	This path, if continued,
962.26	guarantees that we will pass tipping points
965.26	leading to ice sheet disintegration
967.26	that will accelerate out of control of future generations.
971.26	A large fraction of species
973.26	will be committed to extinction.
975.26	And increasing intensity of droughts and floods
977.26	will severely impact breadbaskets of the world,
980.26	causing massive famines
982.26	and economic decline.
986.26	Imagine a giant asteroid
989.26	on a direct collision course with Earth.
993.26	That is the equivalent
995.26	of what we face now.
997.26	Yet, we dither,
999.26	taking no action
1001.26	to divert the asteroid,
1003.26	even though the longer we wait,
1005.26	the more difficult and expensive it becomes.
1009.26	If we had started in 2005,
1011.26	it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year
1014.26	to restore planetary energy balance
1017.26	and stabilize climate this century.
1020.26	If we start next year,
1022.26	it is six percent per year.
1024.26	If we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year --
1027.26	extremely difficult and expensive,
1029.26	perhaps impossible.
1032.26	But we aren't even starting.
1034.26	So now you know what I know
1037.26	that is moving me to sound this alarm.
1040.26	Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.
1043.26	The science is clear.
1046.26	I need your help
1048.26	to communicate the gravity and the urgency
1050.26	of this situation
1052.26	and its solutions
1054.26	more effectively.
1056.26	We owe it to our children and grandchildren.
1058.26	Thank you.
1060.26	(Applause)
