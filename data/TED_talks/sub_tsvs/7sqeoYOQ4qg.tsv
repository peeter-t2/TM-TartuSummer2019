12.759	So we all have our own biases.
15.133	For example, some of us tend to think
17.808	that it's very difficult to transform
17.808	failing government systems.
21.871	When we think of government systems,
23.642	we tend to think that they're archaic,
23.642	set in their ways,
27.257	and perhaps, the leadership
27.257	is just too bureaucratic
29.977	to be able to change things.
32.097	Well, today, I want
32.097	to challenge that theory.
35.886	I want to tell you a story
35.886	of a very large government system
39.979	that has not only put itself
39.979	on the path of reform
43.447	but has also shown
43.447	fairly spectacular results
46.66	in less than three years.
48.746	This is what a classroom
48.746	in a public school in India looks like.
53.05	There are 1 million such schools in India.
55.878	And even for me,
55.878	who's lived in India all her life,
59.034	walking into one of these schools
59.034	is fairly heartbreaking.
63.106	By the time kids are 11,
	so far behind in their education
69.255	that they have no hope to recover.
74.428	they cannot construct
74.428	a grammatically correct sentence.
77.779	These are things that you and I
77.779	would expect an 8-year-old
81.066	to be able to do.
82.672	By the time kids are 13 or 14,
85.493	they tend to drop out of schools.
88.313	In India, public schools
88.313	not only offer free education --
91.611	they offer free textbooks,
91.611	free workbooks, free meals,
95.048	sometimes even cash scholarships.
97.691	And yet, 40 percent of the parents today
100.7	are choosing to pull their children
100.7	out of public schools
103.904	and pay out of their pockets
103.904	to put them in private schools.
107.445	As a comparison,
107.445	in a far richer country, the US,
111.134	that number is only 10 percent.
113.377	That's a huge statement on how broken
113.377	the Indian public education system is.
119.431	So it was with that background
119.431	that I got a call in the summer of 2013
123.931	from an absolutely brilliant lady
123.931	called Surina Rajan.
127.778	She was, at that time, the head
127.778	of the Department of School Education
131.919	in a state called Haryana in India.
134.209	"So she said to us, ""Look, I've been"
134.209	heading this department
137.304	for the last two years.
138.554	I've tried a number of things,
138.554	and nothing seems to work.
142.008	"Can you possibly help?"""
144.852	Let me describe Haryana
144.852	a little bit to you.
147.69	Haryana is a state
147.69	which has 30 million people.
151.721	It has 15,000 public schools
154.916	and 2 million plus
154.916	children in those public schools.
158.119	So basically, with that phone call,
160.587	I promised to help a state and system
163.033	which was as large as that of Peru
163.033	or Canada transform itself.
168.591	As I started this project,
168.591	I was very painfully aware of two things.
172.192	One, that I had never done
172.192	anything like this before.
175.427	And two, many others had,
175.427	perhaps without too much success.
180.247	As my colleagues and I
180.247	looked across the country
183.033	and across the world,
184.365	we couldn't find another example
186.257	that we could just pick up
186.257	and replicate in Haryana.
189.107	We knew that we had to craft
189.107	our own journey.
192.692	But anyway, we jumped right in
192.692	and as we jumped in,
195.77	all sorts of ideas started flying at us.
198.533	"People said, ""Let's change"
198.533	the way we recruit teachers,
201.595	let's hire new principals and train them
204.363	and send them on international
204.363	learning tours,
206.605	"let's put technology inside classrooms."""
209.128	By the end of week one,
209.128	we had 50 ideas on the table,
211.758	all amazing, all sounded right.
214.01	There was no way we were
214.01	going to be able to implement 50 things.
219.103	"So I said, ""Hang on, stop."
221.175	Let's first at least decide
221.175	"what is it we're trying to achieve."""
224.448	So with a lot of push and pull and debate,
227.246	Haryana set itself a goal
227.246	which said: by 2020,
231.157	we want 80 percent of our children
231.157	to be at grade-level knowledge.
235.59	Now the specifics of the goal
235.59	don't matter here,
238.497	but what matters
238.497	is how specific the goal is.
241.786	Because it really allowed us
241.786	to take all those ideas
244.782	which were being thrown at us
246.231	and say which ones
246.231	we were going to implement.
248.629	Does this idea support this goal?
248.629	If yes, let's keep it.
252.972	But if it doesn't or we're not sure,
252.972	then let's put it aside.
256.276	As simple as it sounds,
256.276	having a very specific goal right up front
260.924	has really allowed us to be
260.924	very sharp and focused
264.164	in our transformation journey.
265.816	And looking back over
265.816	the last two and a half years,
268.458	that has been a huge positive for us.
271.488	So we had the goal,
272.676	and now we needed to figure out
272.676	what are the issues, what is broken.
277.001	Before we went into schools,
277.001	a lot of people told us
279.752	that education quality is poor
281.842	because either the teachers are lazy,
281.842	they don't come into schools,
285.74	or they're incapable,
285.74	they actually don't know how to teach.
289.427	Well, when we went inside schools,
289.427	we found something completely different.
293.734	On most days, most teachers
293.734	were actually inside schools.
297.771	And when you spoke with them,
299.374	you realized they were perfectly capable
299.374	of teaching elementary classes.
303.952	But they were not teaching.
306.702	I went to a school
308.125	where the teachers were getting
308.125	the construction of a classroom
311.233	and a toilet supervised.
313.645	I went to another school
315.311	where two of the teachers
315.311	had gone to a nearby bank branch
318.226	to deposit scholarship money
318.226	into kids' accounts.
321.452	At lunchtime, most teachers
321.452	were spending all of their time
325.767	getting the midday meal cooking,
325.767	supervised and served to the students.
330.907	So we asked the teachers,
332.135	"""What's going on,"
332.135	"why are you not teaching?"""
335.196	"And they said, ""This is"
335.196	what's expected of us.
338.5	When a supervisor comes to visit us,
340.835	these are exactly the things
340.835	that he checks.
343.248	Has the toilet been made,
343.248	has the meal been served.
345.952	When my principal
345.952	goes to a meeting at headquarters,
349.086	these are exactly the things
349.086	"which are discussed."""
352.481	You see, what had happened was,
352.481	over the last two decades,
356.529	India had been fighting the challenge
356.529	of access, having enough schools,
360.383	and enrollment, bringing children
360.383	into the schools.
363.178	So the government
363.178	launched a whole host of programs
366.632	to address these challenges,
368.515	and the teachers became
368.515	the implicit executors of these programs.
373.296	Not explicitly, but implicitly.
376.652	And now, what was actually needed
376.652	was not to actually train teachers further
381.692	or to monitor their attendance
383.615	but to tell them
383.615	that what is most important
387.51	is for them to go back
387.51	inside classrooms and teach.
390.134	They needed to be monitored
390.134	and measured and awarded
394.012	on the quality of teaching
395.384	and not on all sorts of other things.
398.018	So as we went through
398.018	the education system,
400.502	as we delved into it deeper,
400.502	we found a few such core root causes
405.786	which were determining, which were
405.786	shaping how people behaved in the system.
409.942	And we realized that unless we change
409.942	those specific things,
413.649	we could do a number of other things.
415.626	We could train, we could put
415.626	technology into schools,
418.493	but the system wouldn't change.
420.497	And addressing these non-obvious
420.497	core issues
423.578	became a key part of the program.
426.678	So, we had the goal and we had the issues,
429.654	and now we needed to figure out
429.654	what the solutions were.
432.888	We obviously did not want
432.888	to recreate the wheel,
435.35	"so we said, ""Let's look around"
435.35	"and see what we can find."""
438.49	And we found these beautiful,
438.49	small pilot experiments
443.411	all over the country
443.411	and all over the world.
446.146	Small things being done by NGOs,
446.146	being done by foundations.
450.138	But what was also interesting
450.138	was that none of them actually scaled.
454.119	All of them were limited
454.119	to 50, 100 or 500 schools.
457.681	And here, we were looking
457.681	for a solution for 15,000 schools.
461.18	So we looked into why,
462.908	if these things actually work,
462.908	why don't they actually scale?
466.572	What happens is that
466.572	when a typical NGO comes in,
469.831	they not only bring in their expertise
472.268	but they also bring in
472.268	additional resources.
474.807	So they might bring in money,
476.588	they might bring in people,
477.933	they might bring in technology.
479.651	And in the 50 or 100 schools
479.651	that they actually operate in,
484.064	those additional resources
484.064	actually create a difference.
487.476	But now imagine that the head of this NGO
490.032	goes to the head
490.032	of the School Education Department
492.811	"and says, ""Hey, now let's do this"
492.811	"for 15,000 schools."""
496.1	Where is that guy or girl
496.1	going to find the money
499.577	to actually scale this up
499.577	to 15,000 schools?
502.305	He doesn't have the additional money,
504.091	he doesn't have the resources.
505.712	And hence, innovations don't scale.
508.938	So right at the beginning
508.938	of the project, what we said was,
512.365	"""Whatever we have to do"
512.365	has to be scalable,
515.035	"it has to work in all 15,000 schools."""
518.346	And hence, it has to work
518.346	within the existing budgets
522.162	and resources that the state actually has.
525.552	Much easier said than done.
527.451	(Laughter)
528.864	I think this was definitely
528.864	the point in time
531.044	when my team hated me.
532.912	We spent a lot of long hours
532.912	in office, in cafés,
538.114	sometimes even in bars,
539.433	scratching out heads and saying,
541.12	"""Where are the solutions,"
541.12	"how are we going to solve this problem?"""
544.41	In the end, I think we did
544.41	find solutions to many of the issues.
548.214	I'll give you an example.
550.111	In the context of effective learning,
552.077	one of the things people talk about
552.077	is hands-on learning.
555.386	Children shouldn't memorize
555.386	things from books,
557.678	they should do activities,
559.291	and that's a more effective way to learn.
561.314	Which basically means
561.314	giving students things
563.636	like beads, learning rods, abacuses.
567.082	But we did not have
567.082	the budgets to give that
569.56	to 15,000 schools, 2 million children.
572.199	We needed another solution.
574.446	We couldn't think of anything.
576.368	One day, one of our team members
576.368	went to a school
579.221	and saw a teacher pick up sticks
579.221	and stones from the garden outside
583.611	and take them into the classroom
585.456	and give them to the students.
587.726	That was a huge eureka moment for us.
591.617	So what happens now
591.617	in the textbooks in Haryana
594.524	is that after every concept,
594.524	we have a little box
597.29	which are instructions
597.29	for the teachers which say,
599.702	"""To teach this concept,"
599.702	here's an activity that you can do.
603.882	And by the way, in order
603.882	to actually do this activity,
606.993	here are things that you can use
606.993	from your immediate environment,
610.196	whether it be the garden outside
610.196	or the classroom inside,
613.241	which can be used
613.241	"as learning aids for kids."""
616.194	And we see teachers all over Haryana
618.664	using lots of innovative things
618.664	to be able to teach students.
622.617	So in this way, whatever we designed,
626.226	we were actually able to implement it
628.328	across all 15,000 schools from day one.
632.304	Now, this brings me to my last point.
634.514	How do you implement something
634.514	across 15,000 schools
637.811	and 100,000 teachers?
640.357	The department used to have a process
642.403	which is very interesting.
643.701	"I like to call it ""The Chain of Hope."""
648.24	They would write a letter
648.24	from the headquarters
650.624	and send it to the next level,
652.273	which was the district offices.
654.186	They would hope that in each
654.186	of these district offices,
656.867	an officer would get the letter,
656.867	would open it, read it
660.866	and then forward it to the next level,
662.984	which was the block offices.
665.015	And then you would hope
665.015	that at the block office,
668.804	somebody else got the letter,
670.311	opened it, read it and forwarded it
670.311	eventually to the 15,000 principals.
674.354	And then one would hope
674.354	that the principals
677.037	got the letter, received it,
677.037	understood it
679.708	and started implementing it.
681.662	It was a little bit ridiculous.
684.684	Now, we knew technology was the answer,
687.169	but we also knew
687.169	that most of these schools
689.334	don't have a computer or email.
692.497	However, what the teachers do have
692.497	are smartphones.
695.604	They're constantly on SMS,
695.604	on Facebook and on WhatsApp.
700.65	So what now happens in Haryana is,
702.919	all principals and teachers are divided
702.919	into hundreds of WhatsApp groups
707.563	and anytime something needs
707.563	to be communicated,
710.409	it's just posted across
710.409	all WhatsApp groups.
713.486	It spreads like wildfire.
715.711	You can immediately check
715.711	who has received it,
718.728	who has read it.
720.042	Teachers can ask clarification
720.042	questions instantaneously.
723.926	And what's interesting is,
725.191	it's not just the headquarters
725.191	who are answering these questions.
728.573	Another teacher from
728.573	a completely different part of the state
731.486	will stand up and answer the question.
733.903	Everybody's acting
733.903	as everybody's peer group,
736.607	and things are getting implemented.
739.784	So today, when you go
739.784	to a school in Haryana,
742.091	things look different.
743.702	The teachers are back inside classrooms,
746.156	they're teaching.
747.484	Often with innovative techniques.
749.74	When a supervisor
749.74	comes to visit the classroom,
752.866	he or she not only checks
752.866	the construction of the toilet
756.757	but also what is the quality of teaching.
760.092	Once a quarter,
760.092	all students across the state
763.232	are assessed on their learning outcomes
765.421	and schools which are
765.421	doing well are rewarded.
768.303	And schools which are not doing so well
770.796	find themselves having
770.796	difficult conversations.
773.568	Of course, they also get
773.568	additional support
775.671	to be able to do better in the future.
779.232	In the context of education,
780.88	it's very difficult
780.88	to see results quickly.
783.63	When people talk about systemic,
783.63	large-scale change,
786.629	they talk about periods
786.629	of 7 years and 10 years.
790.232	But not in Haryana.
792.153	In the last one year, there have been
792.153	three independent studies,
796.129	all measuring student learning outcomes,
798.732	which indicate that something fundamental,
801.063	something unique is happening in Haryana.
803.622	Learning levels of children
803.622	have stopped declining,
806.654	and they have started going up.
808.481	Haryana is one of the few
808.481	states in the country
811.715	which is showing an improvement,
813.318	and certainly the one that is showing
813.318	the fastest rate of improvement.
818.005	These are still early signs,
819.397	there's a long way to go,
820.615	but this gives us a lot of hope
820.615	for the future.
824.859	I recently went to a school,
826.446	and as I was leaving,
828.413	I ran into a lady,
829.588	her name was Parvati,
830.763	she was the mother of a child,
832.225	and she was smiling.
833.828	"And I said, ""Why are you smiling,"
833.828	"what's going on?"""
836.761	"And she said, ""I don't know"
836.761	what's going on,
839.531	but what I do know
839.531	is that my children are learning,
842.642	they're having fun,
844.117	and for the time being, I'll stop
844.117	my search for a private school
847.336	"to send them to."""
849.523	So I go back to where I started:
851.547	Can government systems transform?
854.163	I certainly believe so.
855.687	I think if you give them the right levers,
857.805	they can move mountains.
859.735	Thank you.
860.91	(Applause)
