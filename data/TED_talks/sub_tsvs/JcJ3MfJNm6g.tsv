12	I always wanted to become
12	a walking laboratory of social engagement:
18.313	to resonate other people's feelings,
18.313	thoughts, intentions, motivations,
23.707	in the act of being with them.
26.999	As a scientist, I always wanted
26.999	to measure that resonance,
32.776	that sense of the other
32.776	that happens so quickly,
35.418	in the blink of an eye.
37.682	We intuit other people's feelings;
40.032	we know the meaning of their actions
40.032	even before they happen.
43.959	We're always in this stance
45.729	of being the object
45.729	of somebody else's subjectivity.
48.835	We do that all the time.
48.835	We just can't shake it off.
52.025	It's so important that the very tools
52.025	we use to understand ourselves,
55.748	to understand the world around us,
57.599	are shaped by that stance.
60.226	We are social to the core.
63.572	So my journey in autism really started
66.047	when I lived in a residential unit
66.047	for adults with autism.
70.068	Most of those individuals
70.068	had spent most of their lives
73.183	in long-stay hospitals.
74.692	This is a long time ago.
77.021	And for them, autism was devastating.
81.395	They had profound
81.395	intellectual disabilities.
84.558	They didn't talk.
86.31	But most of all,
88.217	they were extraordinarily isolated
88.217	from the world around them,
93.17	from their environment
95.031	and from the people.
97.392	In fact, at the time,
97.392	if you walked into a school
100.243	for individuals with autism,
102.055	you'd hear a lot of noise,
104.392	plenty of commotion, actions,
104.392	people doing things.
109.73	But they're always doing
109.73	things by themselves.
113.405	So they may be looking
113.405	at a light in the ceiling,
117.527	or they may be isolated in the corner,
120.936	or they might be engaged
120.936	in these repetitive movements,
124.495	in self-stimulatory movements
124.495	that led them nowhere.
128.558	Extremely, extremely isolated.
132.625	Well, now we know that autism
132.625	is this disruption,
138.229	the disruption of this resonance
138.229	that I am telling you about.
141.77	These are survival skills.
143.728	These are survival skills
143.728	that we inherited
146.638	over many, many hundreds
146.638	of thousands of years of evolution.
150.845	You see, babies are born
150.845	in a state of utter fragility.
156.032	Without the caregiver,
156.032	they wouldn't survive,
158.185	so it stands to reason
158.185	that nature would endow them
160.715	with these mechanisms of survival.
164.169	They orient to the caregiver.
166.525	From the first days and weeks of life,
169.94	babies prefer to hear human sounds,
172.698	rather than just sounds
172.698	in the environment.
174.846	They prefer to look at people
174.846	rather than at things,
177.347	and even as they're looking at people,
177.347	they look at people's eyes,
181.747	because the eye is the window
181.747	to the other person's experiences,
185.979	so much so that they even prefer
185.979	to look at people
188.461	who are looking at them
188.461	rather than people who are looking away.
192.525	Well, they orient to the caregiver.
195.131	The caregiver seeks the baby.
197.272	And it's out of this mutually
197.272	reinforcing choreography
201.085	that a lot that is of importance
201.085	to the emergence of mind --
204.904	the social mind, the social
204.904	brain -- depends on.
209.587	We always think about autism
212.683	as something that happens
212.683	later on in life.
217.347	It doesn't; it begins
217.347	with the beginning of life.
222.901	As babies engage with caregivers,
222.901	they soon realize that, well,
228.52	there is something between the ears
228.52	that is very important --
232.666	it's invisible, you can't see it,
232.666	but it's really critical.
236.849	And that thing is called attention.
238.8	And they learn soon enough,
240.157	even before they can utter one word,
242.769	that they can take that attention
242.769	and move somewhere
246.273	in order to get things they want.
249.555	They also learn to follow
249.555	other people's gazes,
252.679	because whatever people are looking at
252.679	is what they are thinking about.
258.704	And soon enough, they start to learn
258.704	about the meaning of things,
262.374	because when somebody
262.374	is looking at something
264.771	or somebody is pointing at something,
267.013	they're not just getting
267.013	a directional cue.
269.752	They are getting the other
269.752	person's meaning of that thing,
273.459	the attitude.
274.693	And soon enough, they start
274.693	building this body of meanings,
279.488	but meanings that were acquired
279.488	within the realm of social interaction.
284.11	Those are meanings that are acquired
286.049	as part of their shared
286.049	experiences with others.
290.086	Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl,
297.512	and she has autism.
300.594	And I am coming so close to her
300.594	that I am maybe two inches from her face,
306.406	and she's quite oblivious to me.
308.265	Imagine if I did that to you,
308.265	came two inches from your face.
311.717	You'd do probably
311.717	two things, wouldn't you?
313.946	You would recoil.
313.946	You would call the police.
316.568	(Laughter)
317.766	You would do something,
318.943	because it's literally impossible
318.943	to penetrate somebody's physical space
323.025	and not get that reaction.
324.452	We do so, remember,
324.452	intuitively, effortlessly.
327.931	This is our body wisdom;
329.12	it's not something mediated
329.12	by our language.
331.342	Our body just knows that.
334.269	And we've known that for a long time.
336.661	And this is not something
336.661	that happens to humans only.
339.6	It happens to some
339.6	of our phyletic cousins,
342.824	because if you're a monkey,
342.824	and you look at another monkey,
346.914	and that monkey has a higher
346.914	hierarchy position than you,
350.932	and that is considered
350.932	to be a signal or threat,
354.485	well, you are not going
354.485	to be alive for long.
357.365	So something that in other species
357.365	are survival mechanisms,
362.221	without which they
362.221	wouldn't basically live,
365.352	we bring into the context of human beings,
367.907	and this is what we need
367.907	to simply act, socially.
372.18	Now, she is oblivious to me
372.18	and I'm so close to her,
374.973	and you think, maybe she can see you,
376.971	maybe she can hear you.
378.506	Well, a few minutes later,
380.152	she goes to the corner of the room,
382.117	and she finds a tiny little piece
382.117	of candy, an M&amp;M.
386.859	So I could not attract her attention,
391.4	but something -- a thing -- did.
393.93	Now, most of us make a big dichotomy
396.471	between the world of things
396.471	and the world of people.
400.882	Now, for this girl,
400.882	that division line is not so clear,
405.397	and the world of people
405.397	is not attracting her
408.527	as much as we would like.
410.01	Now, remember that we learn a great deal
410.01	by sharing experiences.
414.445	What she is doing right now
414.445	is that her path of learning is diverging,
420.33	moment by moment,
422.095	as she is isolating herself
422.095	further and further.
425.913	So we feel sometimes
425.913	that the brain is deterministic,
428.879	the brain determines
428.879	who we're going to be.
431.429	But, in fact, the brain
431.429	also becomes who we are,
434.241	and at the same time
434.241	that her behaviors are taking away
438.254	from the realm of social interaction,
440.44	this is what's happening with her mind,
442.489	and this is what's happening
442.489	with her brain.
447.143	Well, autism is the most strongly
447.143	genetic condition
452.367	of all developmental disorders.
456.461	And it's a brain disorder.
458.695	It's a disorder that begins
458.695	much prior to the time
461.948	that the child is born.
464.217	We now know that there is a very
464.217	broad spectrum of autism.
468.222	There are those individuals
468.222	who are profoundly intellectually disabled
471.715	but there are those that are gifted.
473.696	There are those individuals
473.696	who don't talk at all;
476.114	there are those individuals
476.114	who talk too much.
478.526	There are those individuals
478.526	that if you observe them in their school,
482.047	you see them running the periphery fence
482.047	all the school day if you let them,
485.741	to those individuals
485.741	who cannot stop coming to you
488.126	and trying to engage you
488.126	repeatedly, relentlessly,
491.091	but often in an awkward fashion,
494.232	without that immediate resonance.
497.812	Well, this is much more prevalent
497.812	than we thought at the time.
501.582	When I started in this field,
503.017	we thought there were four individuals
503.017	with autism per 10,000 --
506.129	a very rare condition.
507.861	Well, now we know it's more
507.861	like one in 100.
511.957	There are millions of individuals
511.957	with autism all around us.
517.216	The societal cost
517.216	of this condition is huge,
520.585	in the US alone,
520.585	maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.
523.557	And you know what?
524.769	Most of those funds are associated
524.769	with adolescents and particularly adults
529.43	who are severely disabled,
531.205	individuals who need
531.205	wraparound services --
533.39	services that are very, very intensive.
535.67	And those services can cost in excess
535.67	of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.
540.536	Those are individuals who did not
540.536	benefit from early treatment,
544.474	because now we know
544.474	that autism creates itself
548.636	as individuals diverge in that pathway
548.636	of learning that I mentioned to you.
553.2	Were we to be able
553.2	to identify this condition
555.797	at an earlier point,
555.797	and intervene and treat --
559.812	I can tell you, this has been probably
559.812	something that has changed my life
563.89	in the past 10 years,
565.21	this notion that we can absolutely
565.21	attenuate this condition.
570.922	Also, we have a window of opportunity,
573.301	because the brain
573.301	is malleable for just so long,
576.437	and that window of opportunity
576.437	happens in the first three years of life.
579.974	It's not that that window
579.974	closes; it doesn't.
583.621	But it diminishes considerably.
586.899	And yet, the median age
586.899	of diagnosis in this country
590.021	is still about five years,
591.957	and in disadvantaged populations,
594.076	the populations that don't have
594.076	access to clinical services,
597.229	rural populations, minorities,
600.338	the age of diagnosis is later still,
603.071	which is almost as if I were to tell you
605.12	that we are condemning those communities
605.12	to have individuals with autism
608.911	whose condition is going
608.911	to be more severe.
612.162	So I feel that we have
612.162	a bioethical imperative.
615.168	The science is there.
618.025	But no science is of relevance
620.169	if it doesn't have an impact
620.169	on the community.
623.727	And we just can't afford
623.727	that missed opportunity,
626.705	because children with autism
626.705	become adults with autism.
630.412	And we feel that those things we can do
634.44	for these children,
634.44	for those families, early on,
636.842	will have lifetime consequences --
639.043	for the child, for the family,
639.043	and for the community at large.
643.075	So this is our view of autism.
646.145	There are over a hundred genes
646.145	that are associated with autism.
649.491	In fact, we believe there are going to be
651.474	something between 300 and 600
651.474	genes associated with autism,
655.303	and genetic anomalies,
655.303	much more than just genes.
659.46	And we actually have
659.46	a bit of a question here,
663.644	because if there are so many
663.644	different causes of autism,
666.953	how do you go from those liabilities
666.953	to the actual syndrome?
671.245	Because people like myself,
673.53	when we walk into a playroom,
675.791	we recognize a child as having autism.
678.835	So how do you go from multiple causes
681.087	to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?
684.491	And the answer is what lies in between,
687.753	which is development.
689.66	And in fact, we are very interested
689.66	in those first two years of life,
694.457	because those liabilities
694.457	don't necessarily convert into autism.
698.269	Autism creates itself.
700.812	Were we to be able to intervene
700.812	during those years of life,
705.569	we might attenuate for some, and God
705.569	knows, maybe even prevent for others.
711.975	So how do we do that?
713.837	How do we enter that feeling of resonance,
716.753	how do we enter another person's being?
721.137	I remember when I interacted
721.137	with that 15-month-old,
724.276	the thing that came to my mind was,
726.438	"""How do you come into her world?"
729.41	Is she thinking about me?
729.41	"Is she thinking about others?"""
733.91	Well, it's hard to do that,
736.784	so we had to create the technologies.
738.986	We had to basically step inside a body.
741.479	We had to see the world through her eyes.
745.192	And so in the past many years,
747.528	we've been building these new technologies
749.948	that are based on eye tracking.
751.553	We can see, moment by moment,
751.553	what children are engaging with.
758.046	This is my colleague, Warren Jones,
759.834	with whom we've been building
759.834	these methods, these studies,
763.152	for the past 12 years.
764.879	And you see there a happy five-month-old,
768.789	a five-month little boy
768.789	who is going to watch things
773.88	that are brought from his world:
776.596	his mom, the caregiver,
778.853	but also experiences that he would have
778.853	were he to be in his daycare.
783.884	What we want is to embrace that world
783.884	and bring it into our laboratory,
787.748	but in order for us to do that,
789.806	we had to create
789.806	these very sophisticated measures,
794.085	measures of how people, how little babies,
797.59	how newborns, engage
797.59	with the world, moment by moment.
802.128	What is important and what is not.
805.163	Well, we created those measures,
807.798	and here, what you see
807.798	is what we call a funnel of attention.
811.826	You're watching a video --
813.739	those frames are separated
813.739	by about a second --
816.494	through the eyes of 35 typically
816.494	developing two-year-olds.
820.837	And we freeze one frame,
823.908	and this is what the typical
823.908	children are doing.
827.02	In this scan pass, in green here,
827.02	are two-year-olds with autism.
831.461	So on that frame, the children
831.461	who are typical are watching this,
838.039	the emotion of expression
838.039	of that little boy
840.588	as he's fighting a little bit
840.588	with the little girl.
843.338	What are the children with autism doing?
845.399	They are focusing on the revolving door,
849.304	opening and shutting.
851.542	Well, I can tell you that this divergence
851.542	that you're seeing here
854.915	doesn't happen only
854.915	in our five-minute experiment.
857.751	It happens moment by moment
857.751	in their real lives,
861.82	and their minds are being formed
861.82	and their brains are being specialized
866.077	in something other than what is happening
866.077	with their typical peers.
870.807	Well, we took a construct
870.807	from our pediatrician friends,
877.35	the concept of growth charts --
878.893	you know, when you take
878.893	a child to the pediatrician,
881.394	and you have physical height and weight.
885.066	Well, we decided we were going
885.066	to create growth charts
888.024	of social engagement.
890.354	We sought children
890.354	from the time they're born.
893.574	What you see here on the x-axis
896.973	is two, three, four, five,
896.973	six months and nine,
901.182	until about the age of 24 months.
902.969	This is the percent of their viewing time
905.764	that they're focusing on people's eyes,
907.699	and this is their growth chart.
910.144	They start over here --
910.144	they love people's eyes --
912.641	and it remains quite stable.
915.35	It sort of goes up a little bit
915.35	in those initial months.
919.319	Now, let's see what's happening
919.319	with babies who became autistic.
923.771	It's something very different.
926.004	It starts way up here,
926.004	but then it's a free fall.
929.799	It's very much like they brought
929.799	into this world the reflex
933.694	that orients them to people,
933.694	but it has no traction.
937.511	It's almost as if that stimulus -- you --
940.54	you're not exerting
940.54	influence on what happens
943.554	as they navigate their daily lives.
947.236	Now, we thought those data
947.236	were so powerful, in a way,
954.686	that we wanted to see what happened
954.686	in the first six months of life,
957.96	because if you interact
957.96	with a two- and a three-month-old,
961.192	you'd be surprised
961.192	by how social those babies are.
965.513	And what we see
965.513	in the first six months of life
968.394	is that those two groups
968.394	can be segregated very easily.
974.159	And using these kinds
974.159	of measures and many others,
977.3	what we found out
977.3	is that our science could, in fact,
980.977	identify this condition early on.
983.749	We didn't have to wait
983.749	for the behaviors of autism
986.934	to emerge in the second year of life.
990.156	If we measured things that are,
990.156	evolutionarily, highly conserved,
994.707	and developmentally very early-emerging --
997.054	things that are online
997.054	from the first weeks of life --
999.755	we could push the detection of autism
1001.741	all the way to those first months,
1004.293	and that's what we are doing now.
1008.618	Now, we can create
1008.618	the very best technologies
1011.799	and the very best methods
1011.799	to identify the children,
1015.591	but this would be for naught
1015.591	if we didn't have an impact
1018.529	on what happens in their reality
1018.529	in the community.
1021.68	Now we want those devices, of course,
1023.986	to be deployed by those
1023.986	who are in the trenches --
1026.839	our colleagues, the primary care
1026.839	physicians, who see every child --
1032.067	and we need to transform
1032.067	those technologies
1034.454	into something that is going
1034.454	to add value to their practice,
1037.48	because they have to see so many children.
1039.69	And we want to do that universally
1039.69	so that we don't miss any child.
1043.791	But this would be immoral
1046.529	if we also did not have an infrastructure
1046.529	for intervention, for treatment.
1052.487	We need to be able to work
1052.487	with the families, support the families,
1056.403	to manage those first years with them.
1060.384	We need to be able to really go
1062.806	from universal screening
1062.806	to universal access to treatment,
1066.752	because those treatments
1066.752	are going to change
1069.765	these children's
1069.765	and those families' lives.
1074.45	Now, when we think about what we [can]
1074.45	do in those first years,
1080.912	I can tell you, having been
1080.912	in this field for so long,
1086.077	one feels really rejuvenated.
1088.832	There is a sense that the science
1088.832	that one worked on
1093.578	can actually have an impact on realities,
1096.371	preventing, in fact, those experiences
1099.972	that I really started
1099.972	in my journey in this field.
1103.343	I thought at the time
1103.343	that this was an intractable condition.
1106.777	No longer. We can do
1106.777	a great deal of things.
1110.707	And the idea is not to cure autism.
1113.14	That's not the idea.
1115.791	What we want is to make sure
1117.889	that those individuals
1117.889	with autism can be free
1120.465	from the devastating consequences
1120.465	that come with it at times,
1124.876	the profound intellectual disabilities,
1124.876	the lack of language,
1127.961	the profound, profound isolation.
1131.563	We feel that individuals
1131.563	with autism, in fact,
1133.833	have a very special
1133.833	perspective on the world,
1136.323	and we need diversity.
1138.44	And they can work extremely well
1138.44	in some areas of strength:
1142.09	predictable situations,
1142.09	situations that can be defined.
1145.493	Because after all,
1145.493	they learn about the world
1148.475	almost, like, about it,
1150.381	rather than learning
1150.381	how to function in it.
1153.202	But this is a strength if you're working,
1153.202	for example, in technology.
1158.081	And there are those individuals
1158.081	who have incredible artistic abilities.
1161.936	We want them to be free to do that.
1164.293	We want that the next generations
1164.293	of individuals with autism
1167.436	will be able not only
1167.436	to express their strengths,
1170.538	but to fulfill their promise.
1172.952	Well, thank you for listening to me.
1174.723	(Applause)
