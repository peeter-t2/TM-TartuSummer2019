16.291	My students often ask me,
16.291	"""What is sociology?"""
20.818	And I tell them it's the study of the way
20.818	in which human beings are shaped
25.194	by things that they don't see.
27.761	"And they say, ""So,"
27.761	how can I be a sociologist?
31.92	How can I understand
31.92	"those invisible forces?"""
34.062	"And I say, ""Empathy."
35.614	Start with empathy.
37.738	It all begins with empathy.
40.544	Take yourself out of your shoes,
42.324	put yourself into the shoes
42.324	"of another person."""
44.992	Here, I'll give you an example.
47.523	So I imagine my life
47.523	if, a hundred years ago,
50.951	China had been the most powerful
50.951	nation in the world
53.825	and they came to the United States
53.825	in search of coal.
57.336	And they found it, and, in fact,
57.336	they found lots of it right here.
60.551	And pretty soon,
60.551	they began shipping that coal,
64.101	ton by ton,
65.901	railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,
69.363	back to China and elsewhere
69.363	around the world.
73.329	And they got fabulously
73.329	wealthy in doing so.
75.603	And they built beautiful cities
77.96	all powered on that coal.
82.872	And back here in the United States,
86.317	we saw economic despair, deprivation.
88.488	This is what I saw.
89.96	I saw people struggling to get by,
92.615	not knowing what was what
92.615	and what was next.
95.734	And I asked myself the question:
98.025	How is it possible that we could
98.025	be so poor here in the United States,
101.379	because coal is such a wealthy
101.379	resource; it's so much money?
105.108	And I realize:
106.292	because the Chinese ingratiated themselves
109.721	with a small ruling class
109.721	here in the United States,
112.504	who stole all of that money
112.504	and all of that wealth for themselves.
116.69	And the rest of us,
116.69	the vast majority of us,
118.88	struggle to get by.
120.649	And the Chinese
120.649	gave this small ruling elite
123.777	loads of military weapons
123.777	and sophisticated technology
127.17	in order to ensure that people like me
129.96	would not speak out
129.96	against this relationship.
133.833	Does this sound familiar?
136.705	And they did things like train Americans
136.705	to help protect the coal.
140.316	And everywhere, there were
140.316	symbols of the Chinese --
143.578	everywhere, a constant reminder.
147.191	And back in China,
149.358	what do they say in China?
150.708	Nothing! They don't talk about us.
150.708	They don't talk about the coal.
154.331	If you ask them,
155.545	"they'll say, ""Well, you know,"
155.545	we need the coal.
157.96	I mean, come on, I'm not going
157.96	to turn down my thermostat.
161.682	"You can't expect that."""
163.634	And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,
166.833	as do lots of average people.
169.17	And we fight back,
169.17	and it gets really ugly.
171.736	And the Chinese respond
171.736	in a very ugly way.
175.88	And before we know it,
175.88	they send in the tanks
178.299	and they send in the troops.
180.642	And lots of people are dying.
182.96	And it's a very, very difficult situation.
187.936	Can you imagine what you would feel
191.007	if you were in my shoes?
193.196	Can you imagine
193.196	walking out of this building
195.545	and seeing a tank sitting out there,
197.387	or a truck full of soldiers?
201.16	Just imagine what you would feel,
201.16	because you know why they're here;
204.404	you know what they're doing here.
206.074	And you just feel the anger
206.074	and you feel the fear.
209.634	If you can, that's empathy.
209.634	That's empathy.
212.424	You've left your shoes,
212.424	and you've stood in mine.
216.398	And you've got to feel that.
218.237	OK, so that's the warm-up.
220.316	That's the warm-up.
221.512	Now we're going to have
221.512	the real radical experiment.
225.27	So, for the remainder of my talk,
225.27	what I want you to do
228.96	is put yourselves in the shoes
228.96	of an ordinary Arab Muslim
233.572	living in the Middle East --
235.325	in particular, in Iraq.
239.603	And so to help you,
241.531	perhaps you're a member
241.531	of this middle-class family in Baghdad.
245.864	What you want is the best for your kids.
248.582	You want your kids to have a better life.
250.583	And you watch the news, you pay attention.
252.694	You read the newspaper, you go down
252.694	to the coffee shop with your friends,
256.272	you read the newspapers
256.272	from around the world.
258.517	Sometimes you even watch satellite,
258.517	CNN, from the United States.
261.577	You have a sense of what
261.577	the Americans are thinking.
264.088	But really, you just want
264.088	a better life for yourself.
267.16	That's what you want.
268.705	You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
271.793	You want a better life for yourself.
273.564	So here, let me help you.
274.802	Let me help you with some things
274.802	that you might be thinking.
278.317	Number one:
279.61	this incursion into your land
279.61	these past 20 years and before --
283.96	the reason anyone
283.96	is interested in your land,
286.103	and particularly
286.103	the United States, is oil.
288.271	It's all about oil; you know that,
288.271	everybody knows that.
291.404	People back in the United States
291.404	know it's about oil.
294.719	It's because somebody else
294.719	has a design for your resource.
299.841	It's your resource --
299.841	it's not somebody else's.
302.418	It's your land; it's your resource.
305.42	Somebody else has a design for it.
308.038	And you know why they have a design?
309.915	You know why they have
309.915	their eyes set on it?
312.036	Because they have
312.036	an entire economic system
314.134	that's dependent
314.134	on that oil -- foreign oil,
317.367	oil from other parts of the world
317.367	that they don't own.
320.507	And what else do you think
320.507	about these people?
323.098	The Americans, they're rich.
324.53	Come on, they live in big houses,
324.53	they have big cars.
327.075	They all have blond hair,
327.075	blue eyes. They're happy.
329.499	You think that. It's not true, of course,
329.499	but that's the media impression.
333.032	And that's what you get.
334.252	And they have big cities,
335.484	and the cities are all dependent on oil.
339.96	And back home, what do you see?
341.96	Poverty, despair, struggle.
344.476	Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.
346.892	I mean -- this is Iraq.
350.535	This is what you see.
352.472	You see people struggling to get by.
355.133	It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
357.226	And you feel something about this.
358.917	These people have designs
358.917	for your resource,
361.038	and this is what you see?
363.242	Something else you see
363.242	that you talk about --
365.378	Americans don't talk
365.378	about this, but you do --
367.612	there's this thing,
367.612	this militarization of the world,
370.163	and it's centered
370.163	right in the United States.
372.331	And the United States is responsible
374.229	for almost one half
374.229	of the world's military spending.
379.524	Four percent of the world's population!
381.54	And you feel it; you see it every day.
384.108	It's part of your life.
385.454	And you talk about it with your friends.
388.256	You read about it.
389.868	And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,
393.746	the Americans didn't care
393.746	about his crimes.
396.671	When he was gassing
396.671	the Kurds and gassing Iran,
399.112	they didn't care about it.
400.611	When oil was at stake,
402.714	somehow, suddenly, things mattered.
407.745	And what you see, something else:
410.171	the United States,
411.981	the hub of democracy around the world --
414.114	they don't seem to really be supporting
414.114	democratic countries
417.777	all around the world.
419.688	There are a lot of countries,
419.688	oil-producing countries,
422.431	that aren't very democratic,
422.431	but supported by the United States.
426.39	That's odd.
427.577	Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,
430.402	the 10 years of sanctions,
432.738	the eight years of occupation,
436.433	the insurgency that's been
436.433	unleashed on your people,
440.111	the tens of thousands,
440.111	the hundreds of thousands
442.96	of civilian deaths?
448.174	All because of oil.
450.888	You can't help but think that.
452.848	You talk about it.
454.96	It's in the forefront
454.96	of your mind, always.
457.96	"You say, ""How is that possible?"""
460.467	And this man, he's everyman --
463.96	your grandfather, your uncle,
466.035	your father, your son, your neighbor,
468.122	your professor, your student.
470.352	Once a life of happiness and joy
473.255	and suddenly, pain and sorrow.
477.36	Everyone in your country
477.36	has been touched by the violence,
483.598	the bloodshed, the pain,
483.598	the horror -- everybody.
486.707	Not a single person in your country
486.707	has not been touched.
492.384	But there's something else.
493.96	There's something else about these people,
493.96	these Americans who are there.
497.96	There's something else
497.96	about them that you see
500.185	that they don't see themselves.
501.783	And what do you see? They're Christians!
503.959	They're Christians.
505.451	They worship the Christian God,
505.451	they have crosses, they carry Bibles.
508.976	Their Bibles have a little insignia
511.158	"that says ""US Army"" on them."
514.96	And their leaders, their leaders:
517.96	before they send their sons and daughters
517.96	off to war in your country --
522.277	and you know the reason --
523.639	before they send them off,
525.23	they go to a Christian church,
525.23	and they pray to their Christian God,
528.556	and they ask for protection
528.556	and guidance from that god.
531.364	Why?
532.565	Well, obviously,
532.565	when people die in the war,
536.642	they are Muslims, they are Iraqis --
536.642	they're not Americans.
541.245	You don't want Americans to die --
541.245	"""Protect Our Troops."""
544.089	And you feel something about that --
546.444	of course you do.
547.671	And they do wonderful things.
549.622	You read about it, you hear about it.
551.46	They're there to build schools
551.46	and help people.
553.702	That's what they want to do.
555.095	They do wonderful things,
555.095	but they also do the bad things,
557.887	and you can't tell the difference.
559.546	And this guy, you get a guy
559.546	like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.
562.337	Here's a guy who says
562.337	that your god is a false god.
564.858	Your god's an idol;
564.858	his god is the true god.
566.96	The solution to the problem
566.96	in the Middle East, according to him,
570.08	is to convert you all to Christianity --
572.038	just get rid of your religion.
573.96	And you know that.
573.96	Americans don't read about this guy.
576.695	They don't know anything
576.695	about him, but you do.
578.96	You pass it around.
578.96	You pass his words around.
581.175	I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.
583.771	He was one of the leading commanders
583.771	in the second invasion of Iraq.
587.035	And you're thinking,
587.035	"""My God, if this guy is saying that,"
589.773	then all the soldiers
589.773	"must be saying that."""
592.372	And this word here --
593.881	George Bush called this war a crusade.
595.818	Man, the Americans,
595.818	"they're just like, ""Ah, crusade."
598.32	"Whatever. I don't know what that means."""
600.29	You know what it means --
600.29	it's a holy war against Muslims.
603.339	Look, invade, subdue them,
603.339	take their resources.
607.192	If they won't submit, kill them.
609.465	That's what this is about.
610.84	"And you're thinking, ""My God,"
610.84	"these Christians are coming to kill us."""
614.492	This is frightening.
615.96	You feel frightened.
615.96	Of course you feel frightened.
618.738	And this man, Terry Jones:
621.459	I mean here's a guy
621.459	who wants to burn Qurans, right?
624.23	And the Americans:
624.23	"""Ah, he's a knucklehead."
626.907	He's a former hotel manager; he's got
626.907	"three dozen members of his church ..."""
630.56	They laugh him off.
631.751	You don't laugh him off,
631.751	because in the context of everything else,
634.961	all the pieces fit.
636.136	Of course this is how Americans think.
638.044	So people all over the Middle East,
638.044	not just in your country,
641.071	are protesting.
642.251	"""He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book."
644.206	These Christians --
644.206	who are these Christians?
646.358	They're so evil, they're so mean --
646.358	"this is what they're about?"""
649.797	This is what you're thinking
649.797	as an Arab Muslim,
652.436	as an Iraqi.
653.869	Of course you're going to think this.
655.87	And then your cousin says,
655.87	"""Hey coz, check out this website."
659.818	You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.
662.116	These Christians are nuts!
663.418	They're training their little kids
663.418	to be soldiers for Jesus.
666.309	They take little kids
666.309	and run them through these things
668.918	till they teach them
668.918	how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'
671.244	and things like 'grenade toss'
671.244	and 'weapons care and maintenance.'
674.38	And go to the website --
674.38	it says 'US Army' right on it.
677.436	I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.
679.37	How can they do this
679.37	"to their little kids?"""
681.404	And you're reading this website.
682.959	And of course, Christians
682.959	in the United States, or anybody,
685.804	"says, ""This is some little church"
685.804	"in the middle of nowhere."""
688.709	You don't know that.
689.884	For you, this is like, all Christians.
692.317	"It's all over the Web: ""Bible Boot Camp."""
694.643	And look at this.
696.417	They even teach their kids --
697.836	they train them in the same way
697.836	the US Marines train.
701.167	Isn't that interesting.
702.658	And it scares you, and it frightens you.
704.96	So these guys, you see them.
706.96	You see, I, Sam Richards --
706.96	I know who these guys are.
710.168	They're my students, my friends;
710.168	I know what they're thinking.
713.125	You don't know.
714.357	When you see them, they're something else.
717.686	They're something else.
719.39	That's what they are to you.
722.168	We don't see it that way
722.168	in the United States,
724.659	but you see it that way.
729.96	So here.
731.761	Of course, you've got it wrong.
733.817	You're generalizing. It's wrong.
736.324	You don't understand the Americans.
738.635	It's not a Christian invasion.
740.339	We're not just there for oil;
740.339	we're there for lots of reasons.
743.336	You have it wrong. You've missed it.
745.373	And of course, most of you
745.373	don't support the insurgency;
748.174	you don't support killing Americans;
749.956	you don't support the terrorists.
751.96	Of course you don't. Very few people do.
753.96	But -- some of you do.
757.232	And this is a perspective.
759.041	OK. So now, here's what we're going to do.
761.797	Step outside of your shoes
761.797	that you're in right now,
765.782	and step back into your normal shoes.
767.596	So everyone's back in the room. OK?
770.525	Now here comes the radical experiment.
772.45	So we're all back home.
774.476	This photo: this woman --
776.592	man, I feel her.
778.489	I feel her.
780.086	She's my sister,
781.59	my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.
784.798	She's anybody to me.
786.218	These guys standing there,
786.218	everybody in the photo --
788.949	I feel this photo, man.
792.092	So here's what I want you to do.
793.751	Let's go back to my first
793.751	example, of the Chinese.
797.76	I want you to go there.
799.606	It's all about coal, and the Chinese
799.606	are here in the United States.
802.86	What I want you to do is picture her
804.63	as a Chinese woman
804.63	receiving a Chinese flag
807.582	because her loved one has died
807.582	in America in the coal uprising.
812.872	And the soldiers are Chinese,
814.525	and everybody else is Chinese.
816.88	As an American, how do you feel
816.88	about this picture?
822.19	What do you think about that scene?
826.96	OK, try this. Bring it back.
829.506	This is the scene here.
830.96	It's an American, American soldiers,
832.85	American woman who lost
832.85	her loved one in the Middle East,
835.929	in Iraq or Afghanistan.
838.156	Now, put yourself in the shoes,
840.156	go back to the shoes
840.156	of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
846.265	What are you feeling and thinking
846.265	about this photo,
851.087	about this woman?
861.261	OK,
862.96	now follow me on this,
864.96	because I'm taking a big risk here.
867.115	And so I'm going to invite you
867.115	to take a risk with me.
869.878	These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.
871.879	They were caught by the American soldiers,
871.879	trying to kill Americans.
875.912	And maybe they succeeded.
875.912	Maybe they succeeded.
879.346	Put yourself in the shoes
879.346	of the Americans who caught them.
884.467	Can you feel the rage?
886.571	Can you feel that you just want
886.571	to take these guys
888.977	and wring their necks?
890.451	Can you go there?
892.595	It shouldn't be that difficult.
894.649	You just -- oh, man.
898.534	Now, put yourself in their shoes.
906.031	Are they brutal killers
908.032	or patriotic defenders?
911.961	Which one?
913.751	Can you feel their anger,
916.96	their fear,
918.415	their rage
921.084	at what has happened in their country?
923.305	Can you imagine that maybe
923.305	one of them, in the morning,
927.732	bent down to their child
927.732	and hugged their child
930.888	"and said, ""Dear, I'll be back later."
934.889	I'm going out to defend
934.889	your freedom, your lives.
938.242	I'm going out to look out for us,
941.729	"the future of our country."""
944.34	Can you imagine that?
945.661	Can you imagine saying that?
948.388	Can you go there?
952.96	What do you think they're feeling?
962.983	You see, that's empathy.
965.142	It's also understanding.
966.61	[understand]
968.262	Now, you might ask,
969.594	"""OK, Sam, so why do you"
969.594	do this sort of thing?
972.885	Why would you use
972.885	"this example of all examples?"""
975.269	And I say, because.
977.96	You're allowed to hate these people.
979.785	You're allowed to just hate them
979.785	with every fiber of your being.
984.96	And if I can get you
984.96	to step into their shoes
988.761	and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --
993.14	then imagine the kind
993.14	of sociological analysis
995.878	that you can do in all other
995.878	aspects of your life.
1000.528	You can walk a mile
1001.96	when it comes to understanding why
1001.96	that person's driving 40 miles per hour
1007.055	in the passing lane;
1009.253	or your teenage son;
1011.634	or your neighbor who annoys you
1011.634	by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.
1015.301	Whatever it is, you can go so far.
1018.761	And this is what I tell my students:
1020.88	step outside of your tiny, little world.
1024.396	Step inside of the tiny,
1024.396	little world of somebody else.
1029.149	And then do it again
1030.614	and do it again and do it again.
1032.337	And suddenly, all these tiny,
1032.337	little worlds,
1034.47	they come together in this complex web.
1036.746	And they build a big, complex world.
1039.84	And suddenly, without realizing it,
1042.243	you're seeing the world differently.
1044.444	Everything has changed.
1046.231	Everything in your life has changed.
1049.081	And that's, of course, what this is about.
1052.178	Attend to other lives,
1055.324	other visions.
1056.706	Listen to other people,
1059.155	enlighten ourselves.
1061.769	I'm not saying that I support
1061.769	the terrorists in Iraq.
1066.039	But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:
1069.96	I understand.
1073.96	And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too.
1078.212	Thank you.
1079.388	(Applause)
